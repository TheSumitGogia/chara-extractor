ULYSSES
*NL*
*NL*
by
James
Joyce
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Stately
,
plump
Buck
Mulligan
came
from
the
stairhead
,
bearing
a
bowl
of
*NL*
lather
on
which
a
mirror
and
a
razor
lay
crossed
.
A
yellow
dressinggown
,
*NL*
ungirdled
,
was
sustained
gently
behind
him
on
the
mild
morning
air
.
He
*NL*
held
the
bowl
aloft
and
intoned
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Introibo
ad
altare
Dei
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Halted
,
he
peered
down
the
dark
winding
stairs
and
called
out
coarsely
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
up
,
Kinch
!
Come
up
,
you
fearful
jesuit
!
*NL*
*NL*
Solemnly
he
came
forward
and
mounted
the
round
gunrest
.
He
faced
about
*NL*
and
blessed
gravely
thrice
the
tower
,
the
surrounding
land
and
the
*NL*
awaking
mountains
.
Then
,
catching
sight
of
Stephen
Dedalus
,
he
bent
*NL*
towards
him
and
made
rapid
crosses
in
the
air
,
gurgling
in
his
throat
*NL*
and
shaking
his
head
.
Stephen
Dedalus
,
displeased
and
sleepy
,
leaned
*NL*
his
arms
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
looked
coldly
at
the
shaking
*NL*
gurgling
face
that
blessed
him
,
equine
in
its
length
,
and
at
the
light
*NL*
untonsured
hair
,
grained
and
hued
like
pale
oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
peeped
an
instant
under
the
mirror
and
then
covered
the
*NL*
bowl
smartly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Back
to
barracks
!
he
said
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
in
a
preacher
's
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
this
,
O
dearly
beloved
,
is
the
genuine
Christine
:
body
and
soul
*NL*
and
blood
and
ouns
.
Slow
music
,
please
.
Shut
your
eyes
,
gents
.
One
*NL*
moment
.
A
little
trouble
about
those
white
corpuscles
.
Silence
,
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
peered
sideways
up
and
gave
a
long
slow
whistle
of
call
,
then
paused
*NL*
awhile
in
rapt
attention
,
his
even
white
teeth
glistening
here
and
there
*NL*
with
gold
points
.
Chrysostomos
.
Two
strong
shrill
whistles
answered
*NL*
through
the
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thanks
,
old
chap
,
he
cried
briskly
.
That
will
do
nicely
.
Switch
off
*NL*
the
current
,
will
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
skipped
off
the
gunrest
and
looked
gravely
at
his
watcher
,
gathering
*NL*
about
his
legs
the
loose
folds
of
his
gown
.
The
plump
shadowed
face
and
*NL*
sullen
oval
jowl
recalled
a
prelate
,
patron
of
arts
in
the
middle
ages
.
*NL*
A
pleasant
smile
broke
quietly
over
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
mockery
of
it
!
he
said
gaily
.
Your
absurd
name
,
an
ancient
Greek
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
his
finger
in
friendly
jest
and
went
over
to
the
parapet
,
*NL*
laughing
to
himself
.
Stephen
Dedalus
stepped
up
,
followed
him
wearily
*NL*
halfway
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
gunrest
,
watching
him
still
as
*NL*
he
propped
his
mirror
on
the
parapet
,
dipped
the
brush
in
the
bowl
and
*NL*
lathered
cheeks
and
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
's
gay
voice
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
name
is
absurd
too
:
Malachi
Mulligan
,
two
dactyls
.
But
it
has
a
*NL*
Hellenic
ring
,
has
n't
it
?
Tripping
and
sunny
like
the
buck
himself
.
*NL*
We
must
go
to
Athens
.
Will
you
come
if
I
can
get
the
aunt
to
fork
out
*NL*
twenty
quid
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
the
brush
aside
and
,
laughing
with
delight
,
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
he
come
?
The
jejune
jesuit
!
*NL*
*NL*
Ceasing
,
he
began
to
shave
with
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
me
,
Mulligan
,
Stephen
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
my
love
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
long
is
Haines
going
to
stay
in
this
tower
?
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
showed
a
shaven
cheek
over
his
right
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
,
is
n't
he
dreadful
?
he
said
frankly
.
A
ponderous
Saxon
.
He
thinks
*NL*
you
're
not
a
gentleman
.
God
,
these
bloody
English
!
Bursting
with
money
*NL*
and
indigestion
.
Because
he
comes
from
Oxford
.
You
know
,
Dedalus
,
you
*NL*
have
the
real
Oxford
manner
.
He
ca
n't
make
you
out
.
O
,
my
name
for
you
*NL*
is
the
best
:
Kinch
,
the
knife-blade
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shaved
warily
over
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
was
raving
all
night
about
a
black
panther
,
Stephen
said
.
Where
is
*NL*
his
guncase
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
woful
lunatic
!
Mulligan
said
.
Were
you
in
a
funk
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
,
Stephen
said
with
energy
and
growing
fear
.
Out
here
in
the
dark
*NL*
with
a
man
I
do
n't
know
raving
and
moaning
to
himself
about
shooting
a
*NL*
black
panther
.
You
saved
men
from
drowning
.
I
'm
not
a
hero
,
however
.
If
*NL*
he
stays
on
here
I
am
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
frowned
at
the
lather
on
his
razorblade
.
He
hopped
down
*NL*
from
his
perch
and
began
to
search
his
trouser
pockets
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Scutter
!
he
cried
thickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
over
to
the
gunrest
and
,
thrusting
a
hand
into
Stephen
's
upper
*NL*
pocket
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lend
us
a
loan
of
your
noserag
to
wipe
my
razor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
suffered
him
to
pull
out
and
hold
up
on
show
by
its
corner
a
*NL*
dirty
crumpled
handkerchief
.
Buck
Mulligan
wiped
the
razorblade
neatly
.
*NL*
Then
,
gazing
over
the
handkerchief
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
bard
's
noserag
!
A
new
art
colour
for
our
Irish
poets
:
snotgreen
.
*NL*
You
can
almost
taste
it
,
ca
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
to
the
parapet
again
and
gazed
out
over
Dublin
bay
,
his
fair
*NL*
oakpale
hair
stirring
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
!
he
said
quietly
.
Is
n't
the
sea
what
Algy
calls
it
:
a
grey
*NL*
sweet
mother
?
The
snotgreen
sea
.
The
scrotumtightening
sea
.
_
Epi
oinopa
*NL*
ponton
_
.
Ah
,
Dedalus
,
the
Greeks
!
I
must
teach
you
.
You
must
read
them
*NL*
in
the
original
.
_
Thalatta
!
Thalatta
_
!
She
is
our
great
sweet
mother
.
*NL*
Come
and
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
stood
up
and
went
over
to
the
parapet
.
Leaning
on
it
he
looked
*NL*
down
on
the
water
and
on
the
mailboat
clearing
the
harbourmouth
of
*NL*
Kingstown
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
mighty
mother
!
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
abruptly
his
grey
searching
eyes
from
the
sea
to
Stephen
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
aunt
thinks
you
killed
your
mother
,
he
said
.
That
's
why
she
wo
n't
*NL*
let
me
have
anything
to
do
with
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Someone
killed
her
,
Stephen
said
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
could
have
knelt
down
,
damn
it
,
Kinch
,
when
your
dying
mother
*NL*
asked
you
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
I
'm
hyperborean
as
much
as
you
.
But
to
*NL*
think
of
your
mother
begging
you
with
her
last
breath
to
kneel
down
and
*NL*
pray
for
her
.
And
you
refused
.
There
is
something
sinister
in
you
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
and
lathered
again
lightly
his
farther
cheek
.
A
tolerant
*NL*
smile
curled
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
a
lovely
mummer
!
he
murmured
to
himself
.
Kinch
,
the
loveliest
*NL*
mummer
of
them
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
shaved
evenly
and
with
care
,
in
silence
,
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
an
elbow
rested
on
the
jagged
granite
,
leaned
his
palm
against
*NL*
his
brow
and
gazed
at
the
fraying
edge
of
his
shiny
black
coat-sleeve
.
*NL*
Pain
,
that
was
not
yet
the
pain
of
love
,
fretted
his
heart
.
Silently
,
in
*NL*
a
dream
she
had
come
to
him
after
her
death
,
her
wasted
body
within
its
*NL*
loose
brown
graveclothes
giving
off
an
odour
of
wax
and
rosewood
,
her
*NL*
breath
,
that
had
bent
upon
him
,
mute
,
reproachful
,
a
faint
odour
of
*NL*
wetted
ashes
.
Across
the
threadbare
cuffedge
he
saw
the
sea
hailed
as
a
*NL*
great
sweet
mother
by
the
wellfed
voice
beside
him
.
The
ring
of
bay
*NL*
and
skyline
held
a
dull
green
mass
of
liquid
.
A
bowl
of
white
china
had
*NL*
stood
beside
her
deathbed
holding
the
green
sluggish
bile
which
she
had
*NL*
torn
up
from
her
rotting
liver
by
fits
of
loud
groaning
vomiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
wiped
again
his
razorblade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
poor
dogsbody
!
he
said
in
a
kind
voice
.
I
must
give
you
a
shirt
*NL*
and
a
few
noserags
.
How
are
the
secondhand
breeks
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
fit
well
enough
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
attacked
the
hollow
beneath
his
underlip
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
mockery
of
it
,
he
said
contentedly
.
Secondleg
they
should
be
.
God
*NL*
knows
what
poxy
bowsy
left
them
off
.
I
have
a
lovely
pair
with
a
hair
*NL*
stripe
,
grey
.
You
'll
look
spiffing
in
them
.
I
'm
not
joking
,
Kinch
.
You
*NL*
look
damn
well
when
you
're
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thanks
,
Stephen
said
.
I
ca
n't
wear
them
if
they
are
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
ca
n't
wear
them
,
Buck
Mulligan
told
his
face
in
the
mirror
.
*NL*
Etiquette
is
etiquette
.
He
kills
his
mother
but
he
ca
n't
wear
grey
*NL*
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
his
razor
neatly
and
with
stroking
palps
of
fingers
felt
the
*NL*
smooth
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
his
gaze
from
the
sea
and
to
the
plump
face
with
its
*NL*
smokeblue
mobile
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
fellow
I
was
with
in
the
Ship
last
night
,
said
Buck
Mulligan
,
*NL*
says
you
have
g.p.i.
He
's
up
in
Dottyville
with
Connolly
Norman
.
General
*NL*
paralysis
of
the
insane
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
swept
the
mirror
a
half
circle
in
the
air
to
flash
the
tidings
abroad
*NL*
in
sunlight
now
radiant
on
the
sea
.
His
curling
shaven
lips
laughed
and
*NL*
the
edges
of
his
white
glittering
teeth
.
Laughter
seized
all
his
strong
*NL*
wellknit
trunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
yourself
,
he
said
,
you
dreadful
bard
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
bent
forward
and
peered
at
the
mirror
held
out
to
him
,
cleft
by
*NL*
a
crooked
crack
.
Hair
on
end
.
As
he
and
others
see
me
.
Who
chose
this
*NL*
face
for
me
?
This
dogsbody
to
rid
of
vermin
.
It
asks
me
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
pinched
it
out
of
the
skivvy
's
room
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
It
does
her
*NL*
all
right
.
The
aunt
always
keeps
plainlooking
servants
for
Malachi
.
Lead
*NL*
him
not
into
temptation
.
And
her
name
is
Ursula
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laughing
again
,
he
brought
the
mirror
away
from
Stephen
's
peering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
rage
of
Caliban
at
not
seeing
his
face
in
a
mirror
,
he
said
.
If
*NL*
Wilde
were
only
alive
to
see
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
Drawing
back
and
pointing
,
Stephen
said
with
bitterness
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
a
symbol
of
Irish
art
.
The
cracked
looking-glass
of
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
suddenly
linked
his
arm
in
Stephen
's
and
walked
with
him
*NL*
round
the
tower
,
his
razor
and
mirror
clacking
in
the
pocket
where
he
*NL*
had
thrust
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
not
fair
to
tease
you
like
that
,
Kinch
,
is
it
?
he
said
kindly
.
*NL*
God
knows
you
have
more
spirit
than
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Parried
again
.
He
fears
the
lancet
of
my
art
as
I
fear
that
of
his
.
The
*NL*
cold
steelpen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cracked
lookingglass
of
a
servant
!
Tell
that
to
the
oxy
chap
*NL*
downstairs
and
touch
him
for
a
guinea
.
He
's
stinking
with
money
and
*NL*
thinks
you
're
not
a
gentleman
.
His
old
fellow
made
his
tin
by
selling
*NL*
jalap
to
Zulus
or
some
bloody
swindle
or
other
.
God
,
Kinch
,
if
you
and
I
*NL*
could
only
work
together
we
might
do
something
for
the
island
.
Hellenise
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cranly
's
arm
.
His
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
to
think
of
your
having
to
beg
from
these
swine
.
I
'm
the
only
one
*NL*
that
knows
what
you
are
.
Why
do
n't
you
trust
me
more
?
What
have
you
*NL*
up
your
nose
against
me
?
Is
it
Haines
?
If
he
makes
any
noise
here
I
'll
*NL*
bring
down
Seymour
and
we
'll
give
him
a
ragging
worse
than
they
gave
*NL*
Clive
Kempthorpe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
shouts
of
moneyed
voices
in
Clive
Kempthorpe
's
rooms
.
Palefaces
:
*NL*
they
hold
their
ribs
with
laughter
,
one
clasping
another
.
O
,
I
shall
*NL*
expire
!
Break
the
news
to
her
gently
,
Aubrey
!
I
shall
die
!
With
slit
*NL*
ribbons
of
his
shirt
whipping
the
air
he
hops
and
hobbles
round
the
*NL*
table
,
with
trousers
down
at
heels
,
chased
by
Ades
of
Magdalen
with
the
*NL*
tailor
's
shears
.
A
scared
calf
's
face
gilded
with
marmalade
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
be
debagged
!
Do
n't
you
play
the
giddy
ox
with
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
Shouts
from
the
open
window
startling
evening
in
the
quadrangle
.
A
deaf
*NL*
gardener
,
aproned
,
masked
with
Matthew
Arnold
's
face
,
pushes
his
mower
*NL*
on
the
sombre
lawn
watching
narrowly
the
dancing
motes
of
grasshalms
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
ourselves
...
new
paganism
...
omphalos
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
him
stay
,
Stephen
said
.
There
's
nothing
wrong
with
him
except
at
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
what
is
it
?
Buck
Mulligan
asked
impatiently
.
Cough
it
up
.
I
'm
*NL*
quite
frank
with
you
.
What
have
you
against
me
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
,
looking
towards
the
blunt
cape
of
Bray
Head
that
lay
on
the
*NL*
water
like
the
snout
of
a
sleeping
whale
.
Stephen
freed
his
arm
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
what
is
it
?
Buck
Mulligan
answered
.
I
do
n't
remember
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
in
Stephen
's
face
as
he
spoke
.
A
light
wind
passed
his
brow
,
*NL*
fanning
softly
his
fair
uncombed
hair
and
stirring
silver
points
of
*NL*
anxiety
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
depressed
by
his
own
voice
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
remember
the
first
day
I
went
to
your
house
after
my
mother
's
*NL*
death
?
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
frowned
quickly
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Where
?
I
ca
n't
remember
anything
.
I
remember
only
ideas
and
*NL*
sensations
.
Why
?
What
happened
in
the
name
of
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
were
making
tea
,
Stephen
said
,
and
went
across
the
landing
to
*NL*
get
more
hot
water
.
Your
mother
and
some
visitor
came
out
of
the
*NL*
drawingroom
.
She
asked
you
who
was
in
your
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
?
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
What
did
I
say
?
I
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
said
,
Stephen
answered
,
_
O
,
it
's
only
Dedalus
whose
mother
is
*NL*
beastly
dead
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
which
made
him
seem
younger
and
more
engaging
rose
to
Buck
*NL*
Mulligan
's
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
I
say
that
?
he
asked
.
Well
?
What
harm
is
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
constraint
from
him
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
is
death
,
he
asked
,
your
mother
's
or
yours
or
my
own
?
You
*NL*
saw
only
your
mother
die
.
I
see
them
pop
off
every
day
in
the
Mater
and
*NL*
Richmond
and
cut
up
into
tripes
in
the
dissectingroom
.
It
's
a
beastly
*NL*
thing
and
nothing
else
.
It
simply
does
n't
matter
.
You
would
n't
kneel
*NL*
down
to
pray
for
your
mother
on
her
deathbed
when
she
asked
you
.
Why
?
*NL*
Because
you
have
the
cursed
jesuit
strain
in
you
,
only
it
's
injected
the
*NL*
wrong
way
.
To
me
it
's
all
a
mockery
and
beastly
.
Her
cerebral
lobes
*NL*
are
not
functioning
.
She
calls
the
doctor
sir
Peter
Teazle
and
picks
*NL*
buttercups
off
the
quilt
.
Humour
her
till
it
's
over
.
You
crossed
her
*NL*
last
wish
in
death
and
yet
you
sulk
with
me
because
I
do
n't
whinge
like
*NL*
some
hired
mute
from
Lalouette
's
.
Absurd
!
I
suppose
I
did
say
it
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
mean
to
offend
the
memory
of
your
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
himself
into
boldness
.
Stephen
,
shielding
the
gaping
*NL*
wounds
which
the
words
had
left
in
his
heart
,
said
very
coldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
not
thinking
of
the
offence
to
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
what
then
?
Buck
Mulligan
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
the
offence
to
me
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
swung
round
on
his
heel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
an
impossible
person
!
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
off
quickly
round
the
parapet
.
Stephen
stood
at
his
post
,
*NL*
gazing
over
the
calm
sea
towards
the
headland
.
Sea
and
headland
now
grew
*NL*
dim
.
Pulses
were
beating
in
his
eyes
,
veiling
their
sight
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
the
fever
of
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
within
the
tower
called
loudly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
up
there
,
Mulligan
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
coming
,
Buck
Mulligan
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
Stephen
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
the
sea
.
What
does
it
care
about
offences
?
Chuck
Loyola
,
*NL*
Kinch
,
and
come
on
down
.
The
Sassenach
wants
his
morning
rashers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
halted
again
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
level
*NL*
with
the
roof
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
mope
over
it
all
day
,
he
said
.
I
'm
inconsequent
.
Give
up
the
*NL*
moody
brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
vanished
but
the
drone
of
his
descending
voice
boomed
out
of
*NL*
the
stairhead
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
And
no
more
turn
aside
and
brood
*NL*
Upon
love
's
bitter
mystery
*NL*
For
Fergus
rules
the
brazen
cars
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Woodshadows
floated
silently
by
through
the
morning
peace
from
the
*NL*
stairhead
seaward
where
he
gazed
.
Inshore
and
farther
out
the
mirror
of
*NL*
water
whitened
,
spurned
by
lightshod
hurrying
feet
.
White
breast
of
*NL*
the
dim
sea
.
The
twining
stresses
,
two
by
two
.
A
hand
plucking
the
*NL*
harpstrings
,
merging
their
twining
chords
.
Wavewhite
wedded
words
*NL*
shimmering
on
the
dim
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cloud
began
to
cover
the
sun
slowly
,
wholly
,
shadowing
the
bay
in
*NL*
deeper
green
.
It
lay
beneath
him
,
a
bowl
of
bitter
waters
.
Fergus
'
song
:
*NL*
I
sang
it
alone
in
the
house
,
holding
down
the
long
dark
chords
.
Her
*NL*
door
was
open
:
she
wanted
to
hear
my
music
.
Silent
with
awe
and
pity
*NL*
I
went
to
her
bedside
.
She
was
crying
in
her
wretched
bed
.
For
those
*NL*
words
,
Stephen
:
love
's
bitter
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Her
secrets
:
old
featherfans
,
tasselled
dancecards
,
powdered
with
musk
,
*NL*
a
gaud
of
amber
beads
in
her
locked
drawer
.
A
birdcage
hung
in
the
sunny
*NL*
window
of
her
house
when
she
was
a
girl
.
She
heard
old
Royce
sing
in
the
*NL*
pantomime
of
Turko
the
Terrible
and
laughed
with
others
when
he
sang
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
I
am
the
boy
*NL*
That
can
enjoy
*NL*
Invisibility
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Phantasmal
mirth
,
folded
away
:
muskperfumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
And
no
more
turn
aside
and
brood
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Folded
away
in
the
memory
of
nature
with
her
toys
.
Memories
beset
his
*NL*
brooding
brain
.
Her
glass
of
water
from
the
kitchen
tap
when
she
had
*NL*
approached
the
sacrament
.
A
cored
apple
,
filled
with
brown
sugar
,
*NL*
roasting
for
her
at
the
hob
on
a
dark
autumn
evening
.
Her
shapely
*NL*
fingernails
reddened
by
the
blood
of
squashed
lice
from
the
children
's
*NL*
shirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
dream
,
silently
,
she
had
come
to
him
,
her
wasted
body
within
its
*NL*
loose
graveclothes
giving
off
an
odour
of
wax
and
rosewood
,
her
breath
,
*NL*
bent
over
him
with
mute
secret
words
,
a
faint
odour
of
wetted
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
glazing
eyes
,
staring
out
of
death
,
to
shake
and
bend
my
soul
.
On
me
*NL*
alone
.
The
ghostcandle
to
light
her
agony
.
Ghostly
light
on
the
tortured
*NL*
face
.
Her
hoarse
loud
breath
rattling
in
horror
,
while
all
prayed
on
*NL*
their
knees
.
Her
eyes
on
me
to
strike
me
down
.
_

*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
's
voice
sang
from
within
the
tower
.
It
came
nearer
up
the
*NL*
staircase
,
calling
again
.
Stephen
,
still
trembling
at
his
soul
's
cry
,
*NL*
heard
warm
running
sunlight
and
in
the
air
behind
him
friendly
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
,
come
down
,
like
a
good
mosey
.
Breakfast
is
ready
.
Haines
is
*NL*
apologising
for
waking
us
last
night
.
It
's
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
coming
,
Stephen
said
,
turning
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
,
for
Jesus
'
sake
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
For
my
sake
and
for
all
our
*NL*
sakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
disappeared
and
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
told
him
your
symbol
of
Irish
art
.
He
says
it
's
very
clever
.
Touch
*NL*
him
for
a
quid
,
will
you
?
A
guinea
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
get
paid
this
morning
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
school
kip
?
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
How
much
?
Four
quid
?
Lend
us
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
you
want
it
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Four
shining
sovereigns
,
Buck
Mulligan
cried
with
delight
.
We
'll
*NL*
have
a
glorious
drunk
to
astonish
the
druidy
druids
.
Four
omnipotent
*NL*
sovereigns
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
up
his
hands
and
tramped
down
the
stone
stairs
,
singing
out
of
*NL*
tune
with
a
Cockney
accent
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
O
,
wo
n't
we
have
a
merry
time
,
*NL*
Drinking
whisky
,
beer
and
wine
!
*NL*
On
coronation
,
*NL*
Coronation
day
!
*NL*
O
,
wo
n't
we
have
a
merry
time
*NL*
On
coronation
day
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Warm
sunshine
merrying
over
the
sea
.
The
nickel
shavingbowl
shone
,
*NL*
forgotten
,
on
the
parapet
.
Why
should
I
bring
it
down
?
Or
leave
it
there
*NL*
all
day
,
forgotten
friendship
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
over
to
it
,
held
it
in
his
hands
awhile
,
feeling
its
coolness
,
*NL*
smelling
the
clammy
slaver
of
the
lather
in
which
the
brush
was
stuck
.
*NL*
So
I
carried
the
boat
of
incense
then
at
Clongowes
.
I
am
another
now
and
*NL*
yet
the
same
.
A
servant
too
.
A
server
of
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
gloomy
domed
livingroom
of
the
tower
Buck
Mulligan
's
gowned
form
*NL*
moved
briskly
to
and
fro
about
the
hearth
,
hiding
and
revealing
its
*NL*
yellow
glow
.
Two
shafts
of
soft
daylight
fell
across
the
flagged
floor
*NL*
from
the
high
barbacans
:
and
at
the
meeting
of
their
rays
a
cloud
of
*NL*
coalsmoke
and
fumes
of
fried
grease
floated
,
turning
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
'll
be
choked
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
Haines
,
open
that
door
,
will
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
laid
the
shavingbowl
on
the
locker
.
A
tall
figure
rose
from
the
*NL*
hammock
where
it
had
been
sitting
,
went
to
the
doorway
and
pulled
open
*NL*
the
inner
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
the
key
?
a
voice
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
has
it
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
Janey
Mack
,
I
'm
choked
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
howled
,
without
looking
up
from
the
fire
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Kinch
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
in
the
lock
,
Stephen
said
,
coming
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
key
scraped
round
harshly
twice
and
,
when
the
heavy
door
had
been
*NL*
set
ajar
,
welcome
light
and
bright
air
entered
.
Haines
stood
at
the
*NL*
doorway
,
looking
out
.
Stephen
haled
his
upended
valise
to
the
table
and
*NL*
sat
down
to
wait
.
Buck
Mulligan
tossed
the
fry
on
to
the
dish
beside
*NL*
him
.
Then
he
carried
the
dish
and
a
large
teapot
over
to
the
table
,
set
*NL*
them
down
heavily
and
sighed
with
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
melting
,
he
said
,
as
the
candle
remarked
when
...
But
,
hush
!
Not
a
*NL*
word
more
on
that
subject
!
Kinch
,
wake
up
!
Bread
,
butter
,
honey
.
Haines
,
*NL*
come
in
.
The
grub
is
ready
.
Bless
us
,
O
Lord
,
and
these
thy
gifts
.
*NL*
Where
's
the
sugar
?
O
,
jay
,
there
's
no
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
fetched
the
loaf
and
the
pot
of
honey
and
the
buttercooler
from
*NL*
the
locker
.
Buck
Mulligan
sat
down
in
a
sudden
pet
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
sort
of
a
kip
is
this
?
he
said
.
I
told
her
to
come
after
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
can
drink
it
black
,
Stephen
said
thirstily
.
There
's
a
lemon
in
the
*NL*
locker
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
damn
you
and
your
Paris
fads
!
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
I
want
Sandycove
*NL*
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
came
in
from
the
doorway
and
said
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
woman
is
coming
up
with
the
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
blessings
of
God
on
you
!
Buck
Mulligan
cried
,
jumping
up
from
his
*NL*
chair
.
Sit
down
.
Pour
out
the
tea
there
.
The
sugar
is
in
the
bag
.
Here
,
*NL*
I
ca
n't
go
fumbling
at
the
damned
eggs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hacked
through
the
fry
on
the
dish
and
slapped
it
out
on
three
*NL*
plates
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
In
nomine
Patris
et
Filii
et
Spiritus
Sancti
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
sat
down
to
pour
out
the
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
giving
you
two
lumps
each
,
he
said
.
But
,
I
say
,
Mulligan
,
you
do
*NL*
make
strong
tea
,
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
,
hewing
thick
slices
from
the
loaf
,
said
in
an
old
woman
's
*NL*
wheedling
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
I
makes
tea
I
makes
tea
,
as
old
mother
Grogan
said
.
And
when
I
*NL*
makes
water
I
makes
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
Jove
,
it
is
tea
,
Haines
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
went
on
hewing
and
wheedling
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
So
I
do
,
Mrs
Cahill
,
_
says
she
.
_
Begob
,
ma'am
,
_
says
Mrs
Cahill
,
_
God
*NL*
send
you
do
n't
make
them
in
the
one
pot
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
He
lunged
towards
his
messmates
in
turn
a
thick
slice
of
bread
,
impaled
*NL*
on
his
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
folk
,
he
said
very
earnestly
,
for
your
book
,
Haines
.
Five
*NL*
lines
of
text
and
ten
pages
of
notes
about
the
folk
and
the
fishgods
of
*NL*
Dundrum
.
Printed
by
the
weird
sisters
in
the
year
of
the
big
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Stephen
and
asked
in
a
fine
puzzled
voice
,
lifting
his
*NL*
brows
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
recall
,
brother
,
is
mother
Grogan
's
tea
and
water
pot
spoken
*NL*
of
in
the
Mabinogion
or
is
it
in
the
Upanishads
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
doubt
it
,
said
Stephen
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
now
?
Buck
Mulligan
said
in
the
same
tone
.
Your
reasons
,
pray
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
fancy
,
Stephen
said
as
he
ate
,
it
did
not
exist
in
or
out
of
the
*NL*
Mabinogion
.
Mother
Grogan
was
,
one
imagines
,
a
kinswoman
of
Mary
Ann
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
's
face
smiled
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Charming
!
he
said
in
a
finical
sweet
voice
,
showing
his
white
teeth
*NL*
and
blinking
his
eyes
pleasantly
.
Do
you
think
she
was
?
Quite
charming
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
suddenly
overclouding
all
his
features
,
he
growled
in
a
hoarsened
*NL*
rasping
voice
as
he
hewed
again
vigorously
at
the
loaf
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
For
old
Mary
Ann
*NL*
She
does
n't
care
a
damn
.
*NL*
But
,
hising
up
her
petticoats
...
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
crammed
his
mouth
with
fry
and
munched
and
droned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doorway
was
darkened
by
an
entering
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
milk
,
sir
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
in
,
ma'am
,
Mulligan
said
.
Kinch
,
get
the
jug
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
woman
came
forward
and
stood
by
Stephen
's
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
lovely
morning
,
sir
,
she
said
.
Glory
be
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
whom
?
Mulligan
said
,
glancing
at
her
.
Ah
,
to
be
sure
!
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
reached
back
and
took
the
milkjug
from
the
locker
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
islanders
,
Mulligan
said
to
Haines
casually
,
speak
frequently
of
*NL*
the
collector
of
prepuces
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
much
,
sir
?
asked
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
quart
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
pour
into
the
measure
and
thence
into
the
jug
rich
white
*NL*
milk
,
not
hers
.
Old
shrunken
paps
.
She
poured
again
a
measureful
and
*NL*
a
tilly
.
Old
and
secret
she
had
entered
from
a
morning
world
,
maybe
*NL*
a
messenger
.
She
praised
the
goodness
of
the
milk
,
pouring
it
out
.
*NL*
Crouching
by
a
patient
cow
at
daybreak
in
the
lush
field
,
a
witch
on
her
*NL*
toadstool
,
her
wrinkled
fingers
quick
at
the
squirting
dugs
.
They
lowed
*NL*
about
her
whom
they
knew
,
dewsilky
cattle
.
Silk
of
the
kine
and
poor
old
*NL*
woman
,
names
given
her
in
old
times
.
A
wandering
crone
,
lowly
form
of
*NL*
an
immortal
serving
her
conqueror
and
her
gay
betrayer
,
their
common
*NL*
cuckquean
,
a
messenger
from
the
secret
morning
.
To
serve
or
to
upbraid
,
*NL*
whether
he
could
not
tell
:
but
scorned
to
beg
her
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
indeed
,
ma'am
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
,
pouring
milk
into
their
cups
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Taste
it
,
sir
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
at
her
bidding
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
we
could
live
on
good
food
like
that
,
he
said
to
her
somewhat
*NL*
loudly
,
we
would
n't
have
the
country
full
of
rotten
teeth
and
rotten
*NL*
guts
.
Living
in
a
bogswamp
,
eating
cheap
food
and
the
streets
paved
with
*NL*
dust
,
horsedung
and
consumptives
'
spits
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
a
medical
student
,
sir
?
the
old
woman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
,
ma'am
,
Buck
Mulligan
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
that
now
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
listened
in
scornful
silence
.
She
bows
her
old
head
to
a
voice
*NL*
that
speaks
to
her
loudly
,
her
bonesetter
,
her
medicineman
:
me
she
*NL*
slights
.
To
the
voice
that
will
shrive
and
oil
for
the
grave
all
there
*NL*
is
of
her
but
her
woman
's
unclean
loins
,
of
man
's
flesh
made
not
in
*NL*
God
's
likeness
,
the
serpent
's
prey
.
And
to
the
loud
voice
that
now
bids
*NL*
her
be
silent
with
wondering
unsteady
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
understand
what
he
says
?
Stephen
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
French
you
are
talking
,
sir
?
the
old
woman
said
to
Haines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
spoke
to
her
again
a
longer
speech
,
confidently
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Irish
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
Is
there
Gaelic
on
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
it
was
Irish
,
she
said
,
by
the
sound
of
it
.
Are
you
from
the
*NL*
west
,
sir
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
an
Englishman
,
Haines
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
English
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
,
and
he
thinks
we
ought
to
speak
*NL*
Irish
in
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sure
we
ought
to
,
the
old
woman
said
,
and
I
'm
ashamed
I
do
n't
speak
*NL*
the
language
myself
.
I
'm
told
it
's
a
grand
language
by
them
that
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Grand
is
no
name
for
it
,
said
Buck
Mulligan
.
Wonderful
entirely
.
Fill
*NL*
us
out
some
more
tea
,
Kinch
.
Would
you
like
a
cup
,
ma'am
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
,
the
old
woman
said
,
slipping
the
ring
of
the
*NL*
milkcan
on
her
forearm
and
about
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
your
bill
?
We
had
better
pay
her
,
Mulligan
,
had
n't
we
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
filled
again
the
three
cups
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bill
,
sir
?
she
said
,
halting
.
Well
,
it
's
seven
mornings
a
pint
at
*NL*
twopence
is
seven
twos
is
a
shilling
and
twopence
over
and
these
three
*NL*
mornings
a
quart
at
fourpence
is
three
quarts
is
a
shilling
.
That
's
a
*NL*
shilling
and
one
and
two
is
two
and
two
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
sighed
and
,
having
filled
his
mouth
with
a
crust
thickly
*NL*
buttered
on
both
sides
,
stretched
forth
his
legs
and
began
to
search
his
*NL*
trouser
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pay
up
and
look
pleasant
,
Haines
said
to
him
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
filled
a
third
cup
,
a
spoonful
of
tea
colouring
faintly
the
*NL*
thick
rich
milk
.
Buck
Mulligan
brought
up
a
florin
,
twisted
it
round
in
*NL*
his
fingers
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
miracle
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
it
along
the
table
towards
the
old
woman
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ask
nothing
more
of
me
,
sweet
.
All
I
can
give
you
I
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
laid
the
coin
in
her
uneager
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
'll
owe
twopence
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Time
enough
,
sir
,
she
said
,
taking
the
coin
.
Time
enough
.
Good
*NL*
morning
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
curtseyed
and
went
out
,
followed
by
Buck
Mulligan
's
tender
chant
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Heart
of
my
heart
,
were
it
more
,
*NL*
More
would
be
laid
at
your
feet
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Stephen
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Seriously
,
Dedalus
.
I
'm
stony
.
Hurry
out
to
your
school
kip
and
bring
*NL*
us
back
some
money
.
Today
the
bards
must
drink
and
junket
.
Ireland
*NL*
expects
that
every
man
this
day
will
do
his
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
reminds
me
,
Haines
said
,
rising
,
that
I
have
to
visit
your
*NL*
national
library
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
swim
first
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Stephen
and
asked
blandly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
this
the
day
for
your
monthly
wash
,
Kinch
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
to
Haines
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
unclean
bard
makes
a
point
of
washing
once
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
Ireland
is
washed
by
the
gulfstream
,
Stephen
said
as
he
let
honey
*NL*
trickle
over
a
slice
of
the
loaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
from
the
corner
where
he
was
knotting
easily
a
scarf
about
the
*NL*
loose
collar
of
his
tennis
shirt
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
intend
to
make
a
collection
of
your
sayings
if
you
will
let
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
to
me
.
They
wash
and
tub
and
scrub
.
Agenbite
of
inwit
.
*NL*
Conscience
.
Yet
here
's
a
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
one
about
the
cracked
lookingglass
of
a
servant
being
the
symbol
*NL*
of
Irish
art
is
deuced
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
kicked
Stephen
's
foot
under
the
table
and
said
with
warmth
*NL*
of
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wait
till
you
hear
him
on
Hamlet
,
Haines
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
I
mean
it
,
Haines
said
,
still
speaking
to
Stephen
.
I
was
just
*NL*
thinking
of
it
when
that
poor
old
creature
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Would
I
make
any
money
by
it
?
Stephen
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
laughed
and
,
as
he
took
his
soft
grey
hat
from
the
holdfast
of
*NL*
the
hammock
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
strolled
out
to
the
doorway
.
Buck
Mulligan
bent
across
to
Stephen
and
*NL*
said
with
coarse
vigour
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
put
your
hoof
in
it
now
.
What
did
you
say
that
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
?
Stephen
said
.
The
problem
is
to
get
money
.
From
whom
?
From
the
*NL*
milkwoman
or
from
him
.
It
's
a
toss
up
,
I
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
blow
him
out
about
you
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
,
and
then
you
come
along
*NL*
with
your
lousy
leer
and
your
gloomy
jesuit
jibes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
see
little
hope
,
Stephen
said
,
from
her
or
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
sighed
tragically
and
laid
his
hand
on
Stephen
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
From
me
,
Kinch
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
suddenly
changed
tone
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
tell
you
the
God
's
truth
I
think
you
're
right
.
Damn
all
else
they
*NL*
are
good
for
.
Why
do
n't
you
play
them
as
I
do
?
To
hell
with
them
all
.
*NL*
Let
us
get
out
of
the
kip
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
,
gravely
ungirdled
and
disrobed
himself
of
his
gown
,
saying
*NL*
resignedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mulligan
is
stripped
of
his
garments
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
emptied
his
pockets
on
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
your
snotrag
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
putting
on
his
stiff
collar
and
rebellious
tie
he
spoke
to
them
,
*NL*
chiding
them
,
and
to
his
dangling
watchchain
.
His
hands
plunged
and
*NL*
rummaged
in
his
trunk
while
he
called
for
a
clean
handkerchief
.
God
,
*NL*
we
'll
simply
have
to
dress
the
character
.
I
want
puce
gloves
and
*NL*
green
boots
.
Contradiction
.
Do
I
contradict
myself
?
Very
well
then
,
I
*NL*
contradict
myself
.
Mercurial
Malachi
.
A
limp
black
missile
flew
out
of
*NL*
his
talking
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
there
's
your
Latin
quarter
hat
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
.
Haines
called
to
them
from
the
*NL*
doorway
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
coming
,
you
fellows
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
ready
,
Buck
Mulligan
answered
,
going
towards
the
door
.
Come
out
,
*NL*
Kinch
.
You
have
eaten
all
we
left
,
I
suppose
.
Resigned
he
passed
out
*NL*
with
grave
words
and
gait
,
saying
,
wellnigh
with
sorrow
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
going
forth
he
met
Butterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
taking
his
ashplant
from
its
leaningplace
,
followed
them
out
*NL*
and
,
as
they
went
down
the
ladder
,
pulled
to
the
slow
iron
door
and
*NL*
locked
it
.
He
put
the
huge
key
in
his
inner
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
foot
of
the
ladder
Buck
Mulligan
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
bring
the
key
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
it
,
Stephen
said
,
preceding
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
.
Behind
him
he
heard
Buck
Mulligan
club
with
his
heavy
*NL*
bathtowel
the
leader
shoots
of
ferns
or
grasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Down
,
sir
!
How
dare
you
,
sir
!
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
pay
rent
for
this
tower
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Twelve
quid
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
the
secretary
of
state
for
war
,
Stephen
added
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
while
Haines
surveyed
the
tower
and
said
at
last
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Rather
bleak
in
wintertime
,
I
should
say
.
Martello
you
call
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Billy
Pitt
had
them
built
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
,
when
the
French
were
on
*NL*
the
sea
.
But
ours
is
the
_
omphalos
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
your
idea
of
Hamlet
?
Haines
asked
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
no
,
Buck
Mulligan
shouted
in
pain
.
I
'm
not
equal
to
Thomas
Aquinas
*NL*
and
the
fiftyfive
reasons
he
has
made
out
to
prop
it
up
.
Wait
till
I
*NL*
have
a
few
pints
in
me
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Stephen
,
saying
,
as
he
pulled
down
neatly
the
peaks
of
his
*NL*
primrose
waistcoat
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
could
n't
manage
it
under
three
pints
,
Kinch
,
could
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
has
waited
so
long
,
Stephen
said
listlessly
,
it
can
wait
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
pique
my
curiosity
,
Haines
said
amiably
.
Is
it
some
paradox
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pooh
!
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
We
have
grown
out
of
Wilde
and
paradoxes
.
*NL*
It
's
quite
simple
.
He
proves
by
algebra
that
Hamlet
's
grandson
is
*NL*
Shakespeare
's
grandfather
and
that
he
himself
is
the
ghost
of
his
own
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Haines
said
,
beginning
to
point
at
Stephen
.
He
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
slung
his
towel
stolewise
round
his
neck
and
,
bending
in
*NL*
loose
laughter
,
said
to
Stephen
's
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
shade
of
Kinch
the
elder
!
Japhet
in
search
of
a
father
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
're
always
tired
in
the
morning
,
Stephen
said
to
Haines
.
And
it
is
*NL*
rather
long
to
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
,
walking
forward
again
,
raised
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
sacred
pint
alone
can
unbind
the
tongue
of
Dedalus
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
to
say
,
Haines
explained
to
Stephen
as
they
followed
,
this
*NL*
tower
and
these
cliffs
here
remind
me
somehow
of
Elsinore
.
_
That
beetles
*NL*
o'er
his
base
into
the
sea
,
_
is
n't
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
turned
suddenly
for
an
instant
towards
Stephen
but
did
*NL*
not
speak
.
In
the
bright
silent
instant
Stephen
saw
his
own
image
in
*NL*
cheap
dusty
mourning
between
their
gay
attires
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
a
wonderful
tale
,
Haines
said
,
bringing
them
to
halt
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eyes
,
pale
as
the
sea
the
wind
had
freshened
,
paler
,
firm
and
prudent
.
*NL*
The
seas
'
ruler
,
he
gazed
southward
over
the
bay
,
empty
save
for
the
*NL*
smokeplume
of
the
mailboat
vague
on
the
bright
skyline
and
a
sail
*NL*
tacking
by
the
Muglins
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
read
a
theological
interpretation
of
it
somewhere
,
he
said
bemused
.
*NL*
The
Father
and
the
Son
idea
.
The
Son
striving
to
be
atoned
with
the
*NL*
Father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
at
once
put
on
a
blithe
broadly
smiling
face
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
them
,
his
wellshaped
mouth
open
happily
,
his
eyes
,
from
which
he
had
*NL*
suddenly
withdrawn
all
shrewd
sense
,
blinking
with
mad
gaiety
.
He
moved
*NL*
a
doll
's
head
to
and
fro
,
the
brims
of
his
Panama
hat
quivering
,
and
*NL*
began
to
chant
in
a
quiet
happy
foolish
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
I
'm
the
queerest
young
fellow
that
ever
you
heard
.
*NL*
My
mother
's
a
jew
,
my
father
's
a
bird
.
*NL*
With
Joseph
the
joiner
I
can
not
agree
.
*NL*
So
here
's
to
disciples
and
Calvary
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
up
a
forefinger
of
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
If
anyone
thinks
that
I
am
n't
divine
*NL*
He
'll
get
no
free
drinks
when
I
'm
making
the
wine
*NL*
But
have
to
drink
water
and
wish
it
were
plain
*NL*
That
i
make
when
the
wine
becomes
water
again
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
tugged
swiftly
at
Stephen
's
ashplant
in
farewell
and
,
running
forward
*NL*
to
a
brow
of
the
cliff
,
fluttered
his
hands
at
his
sides
like
fins
or
*NL*
wings
of
one
about
to
rise
in
the
air
,
and
chanted
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Goodbye
,
now
,
goodbye
!
Write
down
all
I
said
*NL*
And
tell
Tom
,
Dick
and
Harry
I
rose
from
the
dead
.
*NL*
What
's
bred
in
the
bone
can
not
fail
me
to
fly
*NL*
And
Olivet
's
breezy
...
Goodbye
,
now
,
goodbye
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
capered
before
them
down
towards
the
fortyfoot
hole
,
fluttering
his
*NL*
winglike
hands
,
leaping
nimbly
,
Mercury
's
hat
quivering
in
the
fresh
*NL*
wind
that
bore
back
to
them
his
brief
birdsweet
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
,
who
had
been
laughing
guardedly
,
walked
on
beside
Stephen
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
ought
n't
to
laugh
,
I
suppose
.
He
's
rather
blasphemous
.
I
'm
not
a
*NL*
believer
myself
,
that
is
to
say
.
Still
his
gaiety
takes
the
harm
out
of
*NL*
it
somehow
,
does
n't
it
?
What
did
he
call
it
?
Joseph
the
Joiner
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
ballad
of
joking
Jesus
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
Haines
said
,
you
have
heard
it
before
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
times
a
day
,
after
meals
,
Stephen
said
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
not
a
believer
,
are
you
?
Haines
asked
.
I
mean
,
a
believer
in
*NL*
the
narrow
sense
of
the
word
.
Creation
from
nothing
and
miracles
and
a
*NL*
personal
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
only
one
sense
of
the
word
,
it
seems
to
me
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
stopped
to
take
out
a
smooth
silver
case
in
which
twinkled
a
*NL*
green
stone
.
He
sprang
it
open
with
his
thumb
and
offered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you
,
Stephen
said
,
taking
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
helped
himself
and
snapped
the
case
to
.
He
put
it
back
in
his
*NL*
sidepocket
and
took
from
his
waistcoatpocket
a
nickel
tinderbox
,
sprang
*NL*
it
open
too
,
and
,
having
lit
his
cigarette
,
held
the
flaming
spunk
*NL*
towards
Stephen
in
the
shell
of
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
of
course
,
he
said
,
as
they
went
on
again
.
Either
you
believe
*NL*
or
you
do
n't
,
is
n't
it
?
Personally
I
could
n't
stomach
that
idea
of
a
*NL*
personal
God
.
You
do
n't
stand
for
that
,
I
suppose
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
behold
in
me
,
Stephen
said
with
grim
displeasure
,
a
horrible
*NL*
example
of
free
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
,
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
,
trailing
his
ashplant
by
his
*NL*
side
.
Its
ferrule
followed
lightly
on
the
path
,
squealing
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
My
familiar
,
after
me
,
calling
,
Steeeeeeeeeeeephen
!
A
wavering
line
*NL*
along
the
path
.
They
will
walk
on
it
tonight
,
coming
here
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
He
wants
that
key
.
It
is
mine
.
I
paid
the
rent
.
Now
I
eat
his
salt
*NL*
bread
.
Give
him
the
key
too
.
All
.
He
will
ask
for
it
.
That
was
in
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
all
,
Haines
began
...
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
and
saw
that
the
cold
gaze
which
had
measured
him
was
not
*NL*
all
unkind
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
all
,
I
should
think
you
are
able
to
free
yourself
.
You
are
your
*NL*
own
master
,
it
seems
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
a
servant
of
two
masters
,
Stephen
said
,
an
English
and
an
*NL*
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Italian
?
Haines
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crazy
queen
,
old
and
jealous
.
Kneel
down
before
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
a
third
,
Stephen
said
,
there
is
who
wants
me
for
odd
jobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Italian
?
Haines
said
again
.
What
do
you
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
imperial
British
state
,
Stephen
answered
,
his
colour
rising
,
and
*NL*
the
holy
Roman
catholic
and
apostolic
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
detached
from
his
underlip
some
fibres
of
tobacco
before
he
*NL*
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
can
quite
understand
that
,
he
said
calmly
.
An
Irishman
must
think
*NL*
like
that
,
I
daresay
.
We
feel
in
England
that
we
have
treated
you
rather
*NL*
unfairly
.
It
seems
history
is
to
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
proud
potent
titles
clanged
over
Stephen
's
memory
the
triumph
*NL*
of
their
brazen
bells
:
_
et
unam
sanctam
catholicam
et
apostolicam
*NL*
ecclesiam
:
_
the
slow
growth
and
change
of
rite
and
dogma
like
his
own
*NL*
rare
thoughts
,
a
chemistry
of
stars
.
Symbol
of
the
apostles
in
the
*NL*
mass
for
pope
Marcellus
,
the
voices
blended
,
singing
alone
loud
in
*NL*
affirmation
:
and
behind
their
chant
the
vigilant
angel
of
the
church
*NL*
militant
disarmed
and
menaced
her
heresiarchs
.
A
horde
of
heresies
*NL*
fleeing
with
mitres
awry
:
Photius
and
the
brood
of
mockers
of
*NL*
whom
Mulligan
was
one
,
and
Arius
,
warring
his
life
long
upon
the
*NL*
consubstantiality
of
the
Son
with
the
Father
,
and
Valentine
,
spurning
*NL*
Christ
's
terrene
body
,
and
the
subtle
African
heresiarch
Sabellius
who
*NL*
held
that
the
Father
was
Himself
His
own
Son
.
Words
Mulligan
had
spoken
*NL*
a
moment
since
in
mockery
to
the
stranger
.
Idle
mockery
.
The
void
*NL*
awaits
surely
all
them
that
weave
the
wind
:
a
menace
,
a
disarming
and
a
*NL*
worsting
from
those
embattled
angels
of
the
church
,
Michael
's
host
,
*NL*
who
defend
her
ever
in
the
hour
of
conflict
with
their
lances
and
their
*NL*
shields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hear
,
hear
!
Prolonged
applause
.
_
Zut
!
Nom
de
Dieu
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
I
'm
a
Britisher
,
Haines
's
voice
said
,
and
I
feel
as
one
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
see
my
country
fall
into
the
hands
of
German
jews
either
.
*NL*
That
's
our
national
problem
,
I
'm
afraid
,
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
men
stood
at
the
verge
of
the
cliff
,
watching
:
businessman
,
boatman
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
's
making
for
Bullock
harbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boatman
nodded
towards
the
north
of
the
bay
with
some
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
five
fathoms
out
there
,
he
said
.
It
'll
be
swept
up
that
way
*NL*
when
the
tide
comes
in
about
one
.
It
's
nine
days
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
that
was
drowned
.
A
sail
veering
about
the
blank
bay
waiting
*NL*
for
a
swollen
bundle
to
bob
up
,
roll
over
to
the
sun
a
puffy
face
,
*NL*
saltwhite
.
Here
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
followed
the
winding
path
down
to
the
creek
.
Buck
Mulligan
stood
on
*NL*
a
stone
,
in
shirtsleeves
,
his
unclipped
tie
rippling
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
A
young
man
clinging
to
a
spur
of
rock
near
him
,
moved
slowly
frogwise
*NL*
his
green
legs
in
the
deep
jelly
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
the
brother
with
you
,
Malachi
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Down
in
Westmeath
.
With
the
Bannons
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Still
there
?
I
got
a
card
from
Bannon
.
Says
he
found
a
sweet
young
*NL*
thing
down
there
.
Photo
girl
he
calls
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Snapshot
,
eh
?
Brief
exposure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
sat
down
to
unlace
his
boots
.
An
elderly
man
shot
up
near
*NL*
the
spur
of
rock
a
blowing
red
face
.
He
scrambled
up
by
the
stones
,
*NL*
water
glistening
on
his
pate
and
on
its
garland
of
grey
hair
,
water
*NL*
rilling
over
his
chest
and
paunch
and
spilling
jets
out
of
his
black
*NL*
sagging
loincloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
made
way
for
him
to
scramble
past
and
,
glancing
at
Haines
*NL*
and
Stephen
,
crossed
himself
piously
with
his
thumbnail
at
brow
and
lips
*NL*
and
breastbone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Seymour
's
back
in
town
,
the
young
man
said
,
grasping
again
his
spur
of
*NL*
rock
.
Chucked
medicine
and
going
in
for
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
go
to
God
!
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Going
over
next
week
to
stew
.
You
know
that
red
Carlisle
girl
,
Lily
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Spooning
with
him
last
night
on
the
pier
.
The
father
is
rotto
with
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
she
up
the
pole
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Better
ask
Seymour
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Seymour
a
bleeding
officer
!
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
to
himself
as
he
drew
off
his
trousers
and
stood
up
,
saying
*NL*
tritely
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Redheaded
women
buck
like
goats
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
in
alarm
,
feeling
his
side
under
his
flapping
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
twelfth
rib
is
gone
,
he
cried
.
I
'm
the
_
Uebermensch
.
_
Toothless
*NL*
Kinch
and
I
,
the
supermen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
struggled
out
of
his
shirt
and
flung
it
behind
him
to
where
his
*NL*
clothes
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
going
in
here
,
Malachi
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
Make
room
in
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
shoved
himself
backward
through
the
water
and
reached
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
creek
in
two
long
clean
strokes
.
Haines
sat
down
on
a
*NL*
stone
,
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
not
coming
in
?
Buck
Mulligan
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Later
on
,
Haines
said
.
Not
on
my
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
going
,
Mulligan
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
that
key
,
Kinch
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
,
to
keep
my
chemise
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
handed
him
the
key
.
Buck
Mulligan
laid
it
across
his
heaped
*NL*
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
twopence
,
he
said
,
for
a
pint
.
Throw
it
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
threw
two
pennies
on
the
soft
heap
.
Dressing
,
undressing
.
Buck
*NL*
Mulligan
erect
,
with
joined
hands
before
him
,

turning

up

at

*NL*
A
voice
,
sweettoned
and
sustained
,
called
to
him
from
the
sea
.
Turning
*NL*
the
curve
he
waved
his

.
It
called
again
.
A

The

asked
the

*NL*
Fabled

And
yet
it

in

it

A

then

of

thud

I

the

Yes

said

*NL*
That

A
bag
of
figrolls
lay
snugly
in
Armstrong
's

.
He
curled
them
*NL*
between
his

at

swallowed

softly

Pyrrhus

All
laughed
.
Mirthless
high
malicious
laughter
.
Armstrong
looked
round
*NL*
at
his

,
silly
glee
in

.
In

moment
they
will
laugh
*NL*
more
loudly

aware

Tell

now

Stephen
said
,
poking
the
boy
's
shoulder
with
the
book
,
*NL*
what
is
a

*NL*
*NL*
--
A
pier

Armstrong
said

A
thing
out
in

A
kind
of

*NL*
bridge

Kingstown

*NL*
*NL*
Some
laughed
again
:
mirthless
but
with
meaning
.
Two
in

back

*NL*
whispered
.
Yes

They
knew

With
envy
he
watched

Their
*NL*
likes
:
their

too

sweetened
with

their

tittering
in
the
struggle

*NL*
*NL*

Kingstown

Stephen
said

Yes

a
disappointed

*NL*
*NL*
The
words
troubled
their
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
,

Comyn
asked
.
A
bridge
is
across
a
river

*NL*
*NL*
For
Haines
's
chapbook
.
No-one
here
to
hear
.
Tonight
deftly
amid
wild
*NL*
drink
and
talk
,
to
pierce
the
polished
mail
of
his
mind
.
What
then
?
A
*NL*
jester
at
the
court
of
his
master
,
indulged
and
disesteemed
,
winning
a
*NL*
clement
master
's
praise
.
Why
had
they
chosen
all
that
part
?
Not
wholly
*NL*
for
the
smooth
caress
.
For
them
too
history
was
a
tale
like
any
other
*NL*
too
often
heard
,
their
land
a
pawnshop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Pyrrhus
not
fallen
by
a
beldam

hand
in
Argos
or
Julius
Caesar
not
*NL*
been
knifed
to
death
.
They
are
not
to
be
thought
away

Time
has
*NL*
branded
them
and
fettered
they
are
lodged
in
the
room
of
the
infinite
*NL*
possibilities
they
have
ousted
.
But
can
those
have
been
possible
seeing
*NL*
that
they
never
were
?
Or
was
that
only
possible
which
came
to
pass
?

A
swarthy
boy
opened
a
book
and
propped
it
nimbly
under
the
breastwork
*NL*
of
his
satchel
.
He
recited
jerks
of
verse
with
odd
glances
at
the
text
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Weep
no

For
Lycidas

dead
,
*NL*
Sunk
though
he
be
beneath
the
watery
floor
...
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
a
movement
then
,
an
actuality
of
the
possible
as
possible
.
*NL*
Aristotle
's
phrase
formed
itself
within
the
gabbled
verses
and
floated
*NL*
out
into
the
studious
silence
of
the
library
of
Saint
Genevieve
where
he
*NL*
had
read
,
sheltered
from
the
sin
of
Paris
,
night
by
night
.
By
his
elbow
*NL*
a
delicate
Siamese
conned
a
handbook
of
strategy
.
Fed
and
feeding
brains
*NL*
about
me
:
under
glowlamps
,
impaled
,
with
faintly
beating
feelers
:
and
*NL*
in
my
mind
's
darkness
a
sloth
of
the
underworld
,
reluctant
,
shy
of
*NL*
brightness
,
shifting
her
dragon
scaly
folds
.
Thought
is
the
thought
of
*NL*
thought
.
Tranquil
brightness
.
The
soul
is
in
a
manner
all
that
is
:
the
*NL*
soul
is
the
form
of

Tranquility
sudden
,
vast
,
candescent

form

Talbot
repeated
:

Stephen
said
quietly
.
I
do

anything

*NL*
*NL*
--
What
,

Talbot
asked
simply
,
bending
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
turned
the
page
over
.
He
leaned
back
and
went
on
again
,
having
*NL*
just
remembered
.
Of
him
that
walked
the
waves
.
Here
also
over
these
*NL*
craven
hearts
his
shadow
lies
and
on
the
scoffer
's
heart
and
lips
and
*NL*
on
mine
.
It
lies
upon
their
eager
faces
who
offered
him
a
coin
of
the
*NL*
tribute
.
To
Caesar
what
is
Caesar
's

to
God
what
is
God

A
long
*NL*
look
from
dark
eyes

a

sentence
to

woven

woven
on

slid

book
into

Stephen
asked

*NL*
--
Who
can
answer
a
riddle
?
Stephen
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
bundled
their
books
away
,
pencils
clacking
,
pages
rustling
.
*NL*
Crowding
together
they
strapped
and
buckled
their
satchels
,
all
gabbling
*NL*
gaily
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
riddle
,
sir
?
Ask
me
,

*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
ask
me
,
sir

*NL*
*NL*
--
A
hard
one
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
is
the
riddle
,
Stephen
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
The
cock
crew
,
*NL*
The
sky
was
blue
:
*NL*
The
bells
in
heaven
*NL*
Were
striking
eleven
.
*NL*
'T
is
time
for
this
poor
soul
*NL*
To
go
to
heaven
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
,
sir
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Again
,
sir
.
We
did
n't
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
grew
bigger
as
the
lines
were
repeated
.
After
a
silence
*NL*
Cochrane
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
it
,
sir
?
We
give
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
his
throat
itching
,
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
fox
burying
his
grandmother
under
a
hollybush
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
and
gave
a
shout
of
nervous
laughter
to
which
their
cries
*NL*
echoed
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stick
struck
the
door
and
a
voice
in
the
corridor
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hockey
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
broke
asunder
,
sidling
out
of
their
benches
,
leaping
them
.
Quickly
*NL*
they
were
gone
and
from
the
lumberroom
came
the
rattle
of
sticks
and
*NL*
clamour
of
their
boots
and
tongues
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sargent
who
alone
had
lingered
came
forward
slowly
,
showing
an
open
*NL*
copybook
.
His
thick
hair
and
scraggy
neck
gave
witness
of
unreadiness
*NL*
and
through
his
misty
glasses
weak
eyes
looked
up
pleading
.
On
his
*NL*
cheek
,
dull
and
bloodless
,
a
soft
stain
of
ink
lay
,
dateshaped
,
recent
*NL*
and
damp
as
a
snail
's
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
copybook
.
The
word
_
Sums
_
was
written
on
the
headline
.
*NL*
Beneath
were
sloping
figures
and
at
the
foot
a
crooked
signature
with
*NL*
blind
loops
and
a
blot
.
Cyril
Sargent
:
his
name
and
seal
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Deasy
told
me
to
write
them
out
all
again
,
he
said
,
and
show
them
*NL*
to
you
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
touched
the
edges
of
the
book
.
Futility
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
understand
how
to
do
them
now
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Numbers
eleven
to
fifteen
,
Sargent
answered
.
Mr
Deasy
said
I
was
to
*NL*
copy
them
off
the
board
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Can
you
do
them
yourself
?
Stephen
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ugly
and
futile
:
lean
neck
and
thick
hair
and
a
stain
of
ink
,
a
snail
's
*NL*
bed
.
Yet
someone
had
loved
him
,
borne
him
in
her
arms
and
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
But
for
her
the
race
of
the
world
would
have
trampled
him
underfoot
,
*NL*
a
squashed
boneless
snail
.
She
had
loved
his
weak
watery
blood
drained
*NL*
from
her
own
.
Was
that
then
real
?
The
only
true
thing
in
life
?
His
*NL*
mother
's
prostrate
body
the
fiery
Columbanus
in
holy
zeal
bestrode
.
*NL*
She
was
no
more
:
the
trembling
skeleton
of
a
twig
burnt
in
the
fire
,
*NL*
an
odour
of
rosewood
and
wetted
ashes
.
She
had
saved
him
from
being
*NL*
trampled
underfoot
and
had
gone
,
scarcely
having
been
.
A
poor
soul
*NL*
gone
to
heaven
:
and
on
a
heath
beneath
winking
stars
a
fox
,
red
reek
*NL*
of
rapine
in
his
fur
,
with
merciless
bright
eyes
scraped
in
the
earth
,
*NL*
listened
,
scraped
up
the
earth
,
listened
,
scraped
and
scraped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
at
his
side
Stephen
solved
out
the
problem
.
He
proves
by
algebra
*NL*
that
Shakespeare
's
ghost
is
Hamlet
's
grandfather
.
Sargent
peered
askance
*NL*
through
his
slanted
glasses
.
Hockeysticks
rattled
in
the
lumberroom
:
the
*NL*
hollow
knock
of
a
ball
and
calls
from
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
page
the
symbols
moved
in
grave
morrice
,
in
the
mummery
of
*NL*
their
letters
,
wearing
quaint
caps
of
squares
and
cubes
.
Give
hands
,
*NL*
traverse
,
bow
to
partner
:
so
:
imps
of
fancy
of
the
Moors
.
Gone
too
from
*NL*
the
world
,
Averroes
and
Moses
Maimonides
,
dark
men
in
mien
and
movement
,
*NL*
flashing
in
their
mocking
mirrors
the
obscure
soul
of
the
world
,
a
*NL*
darkness
shining
in
brightness
which
brightness
could
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
understand
now
?
Can
you
work
the
second
for
yourself
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
long
shaky
strokes
Sargent
copied
the
data
.
Waiting
always
for
a
word
*NL*
of
help
his
hand
moved
faithfully
the
unsteady
symbols
,
a
faint
hue
of
*NL*
shame
flickering
behind
his
dull
skin
.
_
Amor
matris
:
_
subjective
and
*NL*
objective
genitive
.
With
her
weak
blood
and
wheysour
milk
she
had
fed
*NL*
him
and
hid
from
sight
of
others
his
swaddling
bands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
him
was
I
,
these
sloping
shoulders
,
this
gracelessness
.
My
*NL*
childhood
bends
beside
me
.
Too
far
for
me
to
lay
a
hand
there
once
or
*NL*
lightly
.
Mine
is
far
and
his
secret
as
our
eyes
.
Secrets
,
silent
,
stony
*NL*
sit
in
the
dark
palaces
of
both
our
hearts
:
secrets
weary
of
their
*NL*
tyranny
:
tyrants
,
willing
to
be
dethroned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sum
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
very
simple
,
Stephen
said
as
he
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
.
Thanks
,
Sargent
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dried
the
page
with
a
sheet
of
thin
blottingpaper
and
carried
his
*NL*
copybook
back
to
his
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
had
better
get
your
stick
and
go
out
to
the
others
,
Stephen
said
*NL*
as
he
followed
towards
the
door
the
boy
's
graceless
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
corridor
his
name
was
heard
,
called
from
the
playfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sargent
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Run
on
,
Stephen
said
.
Mr
Deasy
is
calling
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
the
porch
and
watched
the
laggard
hurry
towards
the
scrappy
*NL*
field
where
sharp
voices
were
in
strife
.
They
were
sorted
in
teams
and
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
came
away
stepping
over
wisps
of
grass
with
gaitered
feet
.
When
*NL*
he
had
reached
the
schoolhouse
voices
again
contending
called
to
him
.
He
*NL*
turned
his
angry
white
moustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
it
now
?
he
cried
continually
without
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cochrane
and
Halliday
are
on
the
same
side
,
sir
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
you
wait
in
my
study
for
a
moment
,
Mr
Deasy
said
,
till
I
restore
*NL*
order
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
stepped
fussily
back
across
the
field
his
old
man
's
voice
*NL*
cried
sternly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
the
matter
?
What
is
it
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
Their
sharp
voices
cried
about
him
on
all
sides
:
their
many
forms
closed
*NL*
round
him
,
the
garish
sunshine
bleaching
the
honey
of
his
illdyed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stale
smoky
air
hung
in
the
study
with
the
smell
of
drab
abraded
leather
*NL*
of
its
chairs
.
As
on
the
first
day
he
bargained
with
me
here
.
As
it
was
*NL*
in
the
beginning
,
is
now
.
On
the
sideboard
the
tray
of
Stuart
coins
,
*NL*
base
treasure
of
a
bog
:
and
ever
shall
be
.
And
snug
in
their
spooncase
*NL*
of
purple
plush
,
faded
,
the
twelve
apostles
having
preached
to
all
the
*NL*
gentiles
:
world
without
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hasty
step
over
the
stone
porch
and
in
the
corridor
.
Blowing
out
his
*NL*
rare
moustache
Mr
Deasy
halted
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
First
,
our
little
financial
settlement
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
out
of
his
coat
a
pocketbook
bound
by
a
leather
thong
.
It
*NL*
slapped
open
and
he
took
from
it
two
notes
,
one
of
joined
halves
,
and
*NL*
laid
them
carefully
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Two
,
he
said
,
strapping
and
stowing
his
pocketbook
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
his
strongroom
for
the
gold
.
Stephen
's
embarrassed
hand
moved
*NL*
over
the
shells
heaped
in
the
cold
stone
mortar
:
whelks
and
money
*NL*
cowries
and
leopard
shells
:
and
this
,
whorled
as
an
emir
's
turban
,
and
*NL*
this
,
the
scallop
of
saint
James
.
An
old
pilgrim
's
hoard
,
dead
treasure
,
*NL*
hollow
shells
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sovereign
fell
,
bright
and
new
,
on
the
soft
pile
of
the
tablecloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
,
Mr
Deasy
said
,
turning
his
little
savingsbox
about
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
These
are
handy
things
to
have
.
See
.
This
is
for
sovereigns
.
This
is
for
*NL*
shillings
.
Sixpences
,
halfcrowns
.
And
here
crowns
.
See
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shot
from
it
two
crowns
and
two
shillings
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
twelve
,
he
said
.
I
think
you
'll
find
that
's
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you
,
sir
,
Stephen
said
,
gathering
the
money
together
with
shy
*NL*
haste
and
putting
it
all
in
a
pocket
of
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
thanks
at
all
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
You
have
earned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
's
hand
,
free
again
,
went
back
to
the
hollow
shells
.
Symbols
too
*NL*
of
beauty
and
of
power
.
A
lump
in
my
pocket
:
symbols
soiled
by
greed
and
*NL*
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
carry
it
like
that
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
You
'll
pull
it
out
somewhere
*NL*
and
lose
it
.
You
just
buy
one
of
these
machines
.
You
'll
find
them
very
*NL*
handy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Answer
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mine
would
be
often
empty
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
room
and
hour
,
the
same
wisdom
:
and
I
the
same
.
Three
times
*NL*
now
.
Three
nooses
round
me
here
.
Well
?
I
can
break
them
in
this
instant
*NL*
if
I
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
you
do
n't
save
,
Mr
Deasy
said
,
pointing
his
finger
.
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
yet
what
money
is
.
Money
is
power
.
When
you
have
lived
as
long
as
I
*NL*
have
.
I
know
,
I
know
.
If
youth
but
knew
.
But
what
does
Shakespeare
say
?
*NL*
_
Put
but
money
in
thy
purse
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
--
Iago
,
Stephen
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
his
gaze
from
the
idle
shells
to
the
old
man
's
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
knew
what
money
was
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
He
made
money
.
A
poet
,
yes
,
but
*NL*
an
Englishman
too
.
Do
you
know
what
is
the
pride
of
the
English
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
what
is
the
proudest
word
you
will
ever
hear
from
an
Englishman
's
*NL*
mouth
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
seas
'
ruler
.
His
seacold
eyes
looked
on
the
empty
bay
:
it
seems
*NL*
history
is
to
blame
:
on
me
and
on
my
words
,
unhating
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
on
his
empire
,
Stephen
said
,
the
sun
never
sets
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ba
!
Mr
Deasy
cried
.
That
's
not
English
.
A
French
Celt
said
that
.
He
*NL*
tapped
his
savingsbox
against
his
thumbnail
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
tell
you
,
he
said
solemnly
,
what
is
his
proudest
boast
.
_
I
paid
*NL*
my

.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Good

*NL*
*NL*
_
--
I
paid
my
way
.
I
never
borrowed
a

in
my

_
Can
you
feel

that
?

I

*NL*
*NL*
--
For
the
moment
,
no
,
Stephen
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
laughed
with
rich
delight
,
putting
back
his
savingsbox
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
knew
you
could
n't
,
he
said
joyously
.
But
one
day
you
must
feel
it
.
*NL*
We
are
a
generous
people
but
we
must
also
be
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
fear
those
big
words
,
Stephen
said
,
which
make
us
so
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
stared
sternly
for
some
moments
over
the
mantelpiece
at
the
*NL*
shapely
bulk
of
a
man
in
tartan
filibegs
:
Albert
Edward
,
prince
of
*NL*
Wales
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
think
me
an
old
fogey
and
an
old
tory
,
his
thoughtful
voice
said
.
*NL*
I
saw
three
generations
since
O'Connell
's
time
.
I
remember
the
famine
in
*NL*
'
46
.
Do
you
know
that
the
orange
lodges
agitated
for
repeal
of
the
*NL*
union
twenty
years
before
O'Connell
did
or
before
the
prelates
of
your
*NL*
communion
denounced
him
as
a
demagogue
?
You
fenians
forget
some
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glorious

Stephen
sketched
a
brief
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
rebel
blood
in

too
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
On
the
spindle
side
.
But
*NL*
I
am
descended
from
sir
John
Blackwood
who
voted
for
the
union

We

Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Per

Mr
Deasy
said
firmly
,
was
his
motto
.
He
voted
for
*NL*
it
and
put
on
his
topboots
to
ride
to

You

Mr

*NL*
with

I

Sit

He
went
to
the
desk
near
the
window
,
pulled
in
his
chair
twice
and
read
*NL*
off
some
words
from

Sit

he
said
over
his

,
_
the
dictates
of

_
Just

.
*NL*
*NL*
He
peered
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
at
the
manuscript
by
his
elbow
*NL*
and
,
muttering
,
began
to
prod
the

slowly

*NL*
sometimes

he
screwed
up

to
erase

Stephen
seated
himself
noiselessly
before

Framed

around

images

in

Mr

bade
his

But
prompt

*NL*

Mr

said

It

about

Just
look

He
raised
his
forefinger
and
beat
the
air
oldly
before
his
voice
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mark
my
words
,
Mr
Dedalus
,
he
said
.
England
is
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
jews
.
In
all
the
highest
places
:
her
finance
,
her
press
.
And
they
are
*NL*
the
signs
of
a
nation
's
decay
.
Wherever
they
gather
they
eat
up
the
*NL*
nation
's
vital
strength
.
I
have
seen
it
coming
these
years
.
As
sure
*NL*
as
we
are
standing
here
the
jew
merchants
are
already
at
their
work
of
*NL*
destruction
.
Old
England
is
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
swiftly
off
,
his
eyes
coming
to
blue
life
as
they
passed
a
*NL*
broad
sunbeam
.
He
faced
about
and
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dying
,
he
said
again
,
if
not
dead
by
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
The
harlot
's
cry
from
street
to
street
*NL*
Shall
weave
old
England
's
windingsheet
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
open
wide
in
vision
stared
sternly
across
the
sunbeam
in
which
*NL*
he
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
merchant
,
Stephen
said
,
is
one
who
buys
cheap
and
sells
dear
,
jew
or
*NL*
gentile
,
is
he
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
sinned
against
the
light
,
Mr
Deasy
said
gravely
.
And
you
can
see
*NL*
the
darkness
in
their
eyes
.
And
that
is
why
they
are
wanderers
on
the
*NL*
earth
to
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
steps
of
the
Paris
stock
exchange
the
goldskinned
men
quoting
*NL*
prices
on
their
gemmed
fingers
.
Gabble
of
geese
.
They
swarmed
loud
,
*NL*
uncouth
about
the
temple
,
their
heads
thickplotting
under
maladroit
silk
*NL*
hats
.
Not
theirs
:
these
clothes
,
this
speech
,
these
gestures
.
Their
full
*NL*
slow
eyes
belied
the
words
,
the
gestures
eager
and
unoffending
,
but
*NL*
knew
the
rancours
massed
about
them
and
knew
their
zeal
was
vain
.
Vain
*NL*
patience
to
heap
and
hoard
.
Time
surely
would
scatter
all
.
A
hoard
*NL*
heaped
by
the
roadside
:
plundered
and
passing
on
.
Their
eyes
knew
their
*NL*
years
of
wandering
and
,
patient
,
knew
the
dishonours
of
their
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
has
not
?
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
do
you
mean
?
Mr
Deasy
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
forward
a
pace
and
stood
by
the
table
.
His
underjaw
fell
*NL*
sideways
open
uncertainly
.
Is
this
old
wisdom
?
He
waits
to
hear
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
History
,
Stephen
said
,
is
a
nightmare
from
which
I
am
trying
to
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
playfield
the
boys
raised
a
shout
.
A
whirring
whistle
:
goal
.
*NL*
What
if
that
nightmare
gave
you
a
back
kick
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
ways
of
the
Creator
are
not
our
ways
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
All
human
*NL*
history
moves
towards
one
great
goal
,
the
manifestation
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
jerked
his
thumb
towards
the
window
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
is
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hooray
!
Ay
!
Whrrwhee
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Mr
Deasy
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
shout
in
the
street
,
Stephen
answered
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
looked
down
and
held
for
awhile
the
wings
of
his
nose
tweaked
*NL*
between
his
fingers
.
Looking
up
again
he
set
them
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
happier
than
you
are
,
he
said
.
We
have
committed
many
errors
and
*NL*
many
sins
.
A
woman
brought
sin
into
the
world
.
For
a
woman
who
was
no
*NL*
better
than
she
should
be
,
Helen
,
the
runaway
wife
of
Menelaus
,
ten
*NL*
years
the
Greeks
made
war
on
Troy
.
A
faithless
wife
first
brought
the
*NL*
strangers
to
our
shore
here
,
MacMurrough
's
wife
and
her
leman
,
O'Rourke
,
*NL*
prince
of
Breffni
.
A
woman
too
brought
Parnell
low
.
Many
errors
,
many
*NL*
failures
but
not
the
one
sin
.
I
am
a
struggler
now
at
the
end
of
my
*NL*
days
.
But
I
will
fight
for
the
right
till
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
For
Ulster
will
fight
*NL*
And
Ulster
will
be
right
.

Stephen
raised
the
sheets
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
sir
,
he
began
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
foresee
,
Mr
Deasy
said
,
that
you
will
not
remain
here
very
long
*NL*
at
this
work
.
You
were
not
born
to
be
a
teacher
,
I
think
.
Perhaps
I
am
*NL*
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
learner
rather
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
what
will
you
learn
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
knows
?
he
said
.
To
learn
one
must
be
humble
.
But
life
is
the
great
*NL*
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
rustled
the
sheets
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
regards
these
,
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
You
have
two
copies
there
.
If
you
can
have
them
*NL*
published
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
try
,
Stephen
said
,
and
let
you
know
tomorrow
.
I
know
two
*NL*
editors
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
will
do
,
Mr
Deasy
said
briskly
.
I
wrote
last
night
to
Mr
Field
,
*NL*
M.P.
.
There
is
a
meeting
of
the
cattletraders
'
association
today
at
the
*NL*
City
Arms
hotel
.
I
asked
him
to
lay
my
letter
before
the
meeting
.
You
*NL*
see
if
you
can
get
it
into
your
two
papers
.
What
are
they
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
The
Evening
Telegraph
...
_
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
will
do
,
Mr
Deasy
said
.
There
is
no
time
to
lose
.
Now
I
have
to
*NL*
answer
that
letter
from
my
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
morning
,
sir
,
Stephen
said
,
putting
the
sheets
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
Thank
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
at
all
,
Mr
Deasy
said
as
he
searched
the
papers
on
his
desk
.
I
*NL*
like
to
break
a
lance
with
you
,
old
as
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
morning
,
sir
,
Stephen
said
again
,
bowing
to
his
bent
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
by
the
open
porch
and
down
the
gravel
path
under
the
trees
,
*NL*
hearing
the
cries
of
voices
and
crack
of
sticks
from
the
playfield
.
*NL*
The
lions
couchant
on
the
pillars
as
he
passed
out
through
the
gate
:
*NL*
toothless
terrors
.
Still
I
will
help
him
in
his
fight
.
Mulligan
will
dub
*NL*
me
a
new
name
:
the
bullockbefriending
bard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Dedalus
!
*NL*
*NL*
Running
after
me
.
No
more
letters
,
I
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Just
one
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
,
Stephen
said
,
turning
back
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Deasy
halted
,
breathing
hard
and
swallowing
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
just
wanted
to
say
,
he
said
.
Ireland
,
they
say
,
has
the
honour
of
*NL*
being
the
only
country
which
never
persecuted
the
jews
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
that
?
No
.
And
do
you
know
why
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
sternly
on
the
bright
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
sir
?
Stephen
asked
,
beginning
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
she
never
let
them
in
,
Mr
Deasy
said
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
coughball
of
laughter
leaped
from
his
throat
dragging
after
it
a
*NL*
rattling
chain
of
phlegm
.
He
turned
back
quickly
,
coughing
,
laughing
,
*NL*
his
lifted
arms
waving
to
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
never
let
them
in
,
he
cried
again
through
his
laughter
as
he
*NL*
stamped
on
gaitered
feet
over
the
gravel
of
the
path
.
That
's
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
wise
shoulders
through
the
checkerwork
of
leaves
the
sun
flung
*NL*
spangles
,
dancing
coins
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ineluctable
modality
of
the
visible
:
at
least
that
if
no
more
,
thought
*NL*
through
my
eyes
.
Signatures
of
all

I
am
here

But
he
adds
:

.
*NL*
Then
he
was
aware
of
them
bodies
before
of
them
coloured
.
How
?
By
*NL*
knocking
his
sconce
against
them
,
sure
.
Go

Bald

was

Stephen
closed
his
eyes
to
hear
his
boots
crush
crackling
wrack
and
*NL*
shells
.
You

ambled
about

dwindling
sand
,
trotting
,
sniffing
on
*NL*
all
sides
.
Looking
for
something
lost
in
a
past
life

Suddenly
he
made
*NL*
off
like
a
bounding
hare
,
ears
flung
back
,
chasing
the
shadow
of
a
*NL*
lowskimming
gull
.
The
man
's
shrieked
whistle
struck
his
limp
ears
.
He
*NL*
turned
,
bounded
back
,
came
nearer
,
trotted
on
twinkling
shanks
.
On

*NL*
field
tenney
a
buck
,
trippant
,
proper
,
unattired
.
At
the
lacefringe
of

he
halted
with
stiff
forehoofs
,
seawardpointed
ears
.
His
*NL*
snout
lifted
barked
at
the
wavenoise
,
herds
of
seamorse
.
They
serpented
*NL*
towards
his
feet
,
curling
,
unfurling
many
crests
,
every
ninth
,
breaking

*NL*
plashing

waded

in

water
and

stooping
,
*NL*
soused
their
bags
and
,
lifting
them
again
,
waded
out

The
dog
yelped
*NL*
running
to
them
,
reared
up
and
pawed
them
,
dropping
on
all
fours
,
again
*NL*
reared
up
at
them
with
mute
bearish
fawning
.
Unheeded
he
kept
by
them
as
*NL*
they
came
towards
the
drier
sand
,
a
rag
of
wolf
's
tongue
redpanting
from
*NL*
his
jaws
.
His
speckled
body
ambled
ahead
of
them
and
then
loped
off
at
a
*NL*
calf
's
gallop
.
The
carcass
lay
on
his
path
.
He
stopped
,
sniffed
,
stalked
*NL*
round
it

,
nosing
closer
,
went
round
it

sniffling

*NL*
The
cry
brought
him
skulking
back
to
his
master
and
a
blunt
bootless
*NL*
kick
sent
him
unscathed
across
a
spit
of
sand
,
crouched
in
flight
.
He
*NL*
slunk
back
in
a
curve
.
Does
n't
see
me
.
Along
by
the
edge
of
the
mole
he
*NL*
lolloped
,
dawdled
,
smelt
a
rock
and
from
under
a
cocked
hindleg
pissed
*NL*
against
it
.
He
trotted
forward
and
,
lifting
again
his
hindleg

pissed
*NL*
quick
short
at
an
unsmelt
rock

The
simple

His
*NL*
hindpaws
then
scattered
the
sand
:
then
his
forepaws
dabbled
and
delved
.
*NL*
Something
he
buried
there
,
his
grandmother
.
He
rooted
in
the
sand
,
*NL*
dabbling
,
delving
and
stopped
to
listen
to
the
air
,
scraped
up
the
sand
*NL*
again

fury
of

Turning
his
back
to
the

he
bent
over
far
to
a
table
of
rock
and
*NL*
scribbled
words
.
That

I

to
take

His
shadow
lay
over

bent

ending

Why
not
endless
till

the

Darkly
they

there
behind
this

darkness
*NL*
shining
in

Me
sits
there
*NL*
with
his

of

,
in
borrowed

,
by

beside
a
livid
*NL*
sea
,
unbeheld
,
in

night
walking
beneath
a
reign
of
uncouth
stars
.
*NL*
I
throw
this

shadow
from

,
manshape
ineluctable
,
call
it
back

*NL*
Endless
,
would
it
be
mine

Who
watches
me
here

Who
*NL*
ever

will
read
these
written

Signs
on
a
white
field
.
*NL*
Somewhere
to
someone
in
your
flutiest
voice

The
good
bishop
of
Cloyne
*NL*
took
the
veil
of
the
temple
out
of
his
shovel
hat
:
veil
of
space
with
*NL*
coloured
emblems
hatched
on
its
field
.
Hold
hard
.
Coloured
on
a
flat
:
*NL*
yes

that
's

Flat
I

Ah

Falls
back
suddenly

frozen

stereoscope

Click
does
the

.
You
find
my

dark
.
Darkness
is
*NL*
in
our

do
you
not
think
?
Flutier
.
Our
souls
,
shamewounded
by
our
*NL*
sins
,
cling
to
us
yet
more
,
a

to
her
lover
clinging

the
more
the
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
trusts
me
,
her
hand
gentle
,
the
longlashed
eyes
.
Now
where
the
blue
*NL*
hell
am
I
bringing
her
beyond
the
veil
?
Into
the
ineluctable
modality
of
*NL*
the
ineluctable
visuality
.
She
,
she
,
she
.
What
she
?
The
virgin
at
Hodges

Figgis
'
window
on
Monday
looking
in
for
one
of
the
alphabet
books
you
*NL*
were
going
to
write
.
Keen
glance
you
gave
her
.
Wrist
through
the
*NL*
braided
jesse
of
her
sunshade
.
She
lives
in
Leeson
park
with
a
grief
*NL*
and
kickshaws
,
a
lady
of
letters
.
Talk
that
to
someone
else

Stevie
:
a

Bet
she
wears
those
curse
of
God
stays
suspenders
and
*NL*
yellow
stockings
,
darned
with
lumpy

Talk
about
apple

*NL*
_

.
Where
are
your

?
*NL*
*NL*
Touch
me
.
Soft

Soft

I
am
lonely
here

O

*NL*

What
is
that

known
to
all

I

Sad

Touch

*NL*
He
lay
back
at
full
stretch
over
the
sharp
rocks
,
cramming
the
scribbled
*NL*
note
and
pencil
into
a
pock
his
hat
.
His
hat
down
on
his

.
That
is
*NL*
Kevin

made

nodding

Welcome

*NL*
in

Under
its
leaf
he
watched
through
peacocktwittering
lashes
the
*NL*
southing
sun
.
I
am
caught
in
this
burning
scene
.
Pan
's
hour
,
the
faunal
*NL*
noon
.
Among
gumheavy
serpentplants
,
milkoozing

,
where
on
the
*NL*
tawny
waters
leaves
lie
wide

Pain

His

brooded

a

nebeneinander

He
counted
the
creases
of
rucked
leather
wherein
*NL*
another

foot
had
nested
warm
.
The
foot
that
beat
the
ground
in

foot
I
dislove

But

In

the

Mr
Leopold
Bloom
ate
with
relish
the
inner
organs
of
beasts
and
fowls
.
*NL*
He
liked
thick
giblet
soup

nutty
gizzards
,
a
stuffed
roast
heart
,
*NL*
liverslices
fried
with
crustcrumbs
,
fried
hencods

roes
.
Most
of
all
*NL*
he
liked
grilled
mutton
kidneys
which
gave
to
his
palate
a
fine
tang
of
*NL*
faintly
scented
urine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kidneys
were
in
his
mind
as
he
moved
about
the
kitchen
softly
,
righting
*NL*
her
breakfast
things
on
the
humpy
tray
.
Gelid
light
and
air
were
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
but
out
of
doors
gentle
summer
morning
everywhere

Made
him
feel
*NL*
a

peckish

He
turned
from
the
tray
,
lifted
the
kettle
off
*NL*
the
hob
and
set
it
sideways
on
the
fire
.
It
sat
there

dull
and
squat
,
*NL*

spout
stuck
out

The

mewed
in

stalked
again

round

mewing

sleek
hide
,
the

under

butt
of

tail

bent
down

his

She
blinked
up
out
of
her
avid
shameclosing
eyes
,
mewing
plaintively
*NL*
and
long
,
showing
him
her
milkwhite
teeth

He
watched
the
dark
eyeslits
*NL*
narrowing
with
greed
till
her
eyes
were
green
stones
.
Then
he
went
to
*NL*
the
dresser
,
took
the
jug
Hanlon

milkman
had
just
filled
for
him
,
*NL*
poured
warmbubbled

on

He
watched

three

licked
lightly

n't
mouse
after
.
Why
?
They
shine
in
the
dark
,
perhaps
,
the
tips
.
Or
*NL*
kind
of
feelers
in
the
dark
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
her
licking
lap
.
Ham
and
eggs
,
no
.
No
good
eggs
with
this
*NL*
drouth
.
Want
pure
fresh
water
.
Thursday
:
not
a
good
day
either
for
a
*NL*
mutton
kidney
at
Buckley
's
.
Fried
with
butter
,
a
shake
of
pepper
.
Better
*NL*
a
pork
kidney
at
Dlugacz
's
.
While
the
kettle
is
boiling
.
She
lapped
*NL*
slower
,
then
licking
the
saucer
clean
.
Why
are
their
tongues
so
rough
?
*NL*
To
lap
better
,
all
porous
holes
.
Nothing
she
can
eat
?
He
glanced
round
*NL*
him
.
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
quietly
creaky
boots
he
went
up
the
staircase
to
the
hall
,
paused
by
*NL*
the
bedroom
door
.
She
might
like
something
tasty
.
Thin
bread
and
butter
*NL*
she
likes
in
the
morning
.
Still
perhaps
:
once
in
a
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
softly
in
the
bare
hall
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
going
round
the
corner
.
Be
back
in
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
had
heard
his
voice
say
it
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
do
n't
want
anything
for
breakfast
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
sleepy
soft
grunt
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mn
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
She
did
n't
want
anything
.
He
heard
then
a
warm
heavy
sigh
,
softer
,
*NL*
as
she
turned
over
and
the
loose
brass
quoits
of
the
bedstead
jingled
.
*NL*
Must
get
those
settled
really
.
Pity
.
All
the
way
from
Gibraltar
.
*NL*
Forgotten
any
little
Spanish
she
knew
.
Wonder
what
her
father
gave
for
*NL*
it
.
Old
style
.
Ah
yes
!
of
course
.
Bought
it
at
the
governor
's
auction
.
*NL*
Got
a
short
knock
.
Hard
as
nails
at
a
bargain
,
old
Tweedy
.
Yes
,
sir
.
At
*NL*
Plevna
that
was
.
I
rose
from
the
ranks
,
sir
,
and
I
'm
proud
of
it
.
*NL*
Still
he
had
brains
enough
to
make
that
corner
in
stamps
.
Now
that
was
*NL*
farseeing
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
took
his
hat
from
the
peg
over
his
initialled
heavy
overcoat
*NL*
and
his
lost
property
office
secondhand
waterproof
.
Stamps
:
stickyback
*NL*
pictures
.
Daresay
lots
of
officers
are
in
the
swim
too
.
Course
they
do
.
*NL*
The
sweated
legend
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
told
him
mutely
:
Plasto
's
*NL*
high
grade
ha
.
He
peeped
quickly
inside
the
leather
headband
.
White
slip
*NL*
of
paper
.
Quite
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
doorstep
he
felt
in
his
hip
pocket
for
the
latchkey
.
Not
there
.
*NL*
In
the
trousers
I
left
off
.
Must
get
it
.
Potato
I
have
.
Creaky
wardrobe
.
*NL*
No
use
disturbing
her
.
She
turned
over
sleepily
that
time
.
He
pulled
*NL*
the
halldoor
to
after
him
very
quietly
,
more
,
till
the
footleaf
dropped
*NL*
gently
over
the
threshold
,
a
limp
lid
.
Looked
shut
.
All
right
till
I
*NL*
come
back
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
to
the
bright
side
,
avoiding
the
loose
cellarflap
of
number
*NL*
seventyfive
.
The
sun
was
nearing
the
steeple
of
George
's
church
.
Be
a
*NL*
warm
day
I
fancy
.
Specially
in
these
black
clothes
feel
it
more
.
Black
*NL*
conducts
,
reflects
,
-LRB-
refracts
is
it
?
-RRB-
,
the
heat
.
But
I
could
n't
go
in
*NL*
that
light
suit
.
Make
a
picnic
of
it
.
His
eyelids
sank
quietly
often
as
*NL*
he
walked
in
happy
warmth
.
Boland
's
breadvan
delivering
with
trays
our
*NL*
daily
but
she
prefers
yesterday
's
loaves
turnovers
crisp
crowns
hot
.
*NL*
Makes
you
feel
young
.
Somewhere
in
the
east
:
early
morning
:
set
off
at
*NL*
dawn
.
Travel
round
in
front
of
the
sun
,
steal
a
day
's
march
on
him
.
Keep
*NL*
it
up
for
ever
never
grow
a
day
older
technically
.
Walk
along
a
strand
,
*NL*
strange
land
,
come
to
a
city
gate
,
sentry
there
,
old
ranker
too
,
old
*NL*
Tweedy
's
big

,
leaning
on
a
long
kind
of
a
spear
.
Wander
*NL*
through
awned
streets
.
Turbaned
faces
going
by
.
Dark
caves
of
carpet
*NL*
shops
,
big
man
,
Turko
the
terrible
,
seated
crosslegged
,
smoking
a
coiled
*NL*
pipe
.
Cries
of
sellers
in
the
streets
.
Drink
water
scented
with
fennel
,
*NL*
sherbet
.
Dander
along
all
day
.
Might
meet
a
robber
or
two
.
Well
,
*NL*
meet
him
.
Getting
on
to
sundown
.
The
shadows
of
the
mosques
among
the
*NL*
pillars
:
priest
with
a
scroll
rolled
up
.
A
shiver
of
the
trees
,
signal
,
*NL*
the
evening
wind
.
I
pass
on
.
Fading
gold
sky
.
A
mother
watches
me
from
*NL*
her
doorway
.
She
calls
her
children
home
in
their
dark
language
.
High
*NL*
wall
:
beyond

twanged
.
Night

,

,
violet
,
colour
of
Molly

*NL*

Strings

Listen
.
A

playing
one
of
those
instruments
*NL*
what
do
you
call
them
:
dulcimers
.
I
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
not
a
bit
like
it
really
.
Kind
of
stuff
you
read
:
in
the
track
*NL*
of
the
sun
.
Sunburst
on
the
titlepage
.
He
smiled
,
pleasing
himself
.
What
*NL*
Arthur
Griffith
said
about
the
headpiece
over
the
_
Freeman
_
leader
:
a
*NL*
homerule
sun
rising
up
in
the
northwest
from
the
laneway
behind
the
bank
*NL*
of
Ireland
.
He
prolonged
his
pleased
smile
.
Ikey
touch
that
:
homerule
*NL*
sun
rising
up
in
the
north-west
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
Larry
O'Rourke
's
.
From
the
cellar
grating
floated
up
the
*NL*
flabby
gush
of
porter
.
Through
the
open
doorway
the
bar
squirted
out
*NL*
whiffs
of
ginger
,
teadust
,
biscuitmush
.
Good
house
,
however
:
just
the
*NL*
end
of
the
city
traffic
.
For
instance
M'Auley
's
down
there
:
n.
g.
as
*NL*
position
.
Of
course
if
they
ran
a
tramline
along
the
North
Circular
from
*NL*
the
cattlemarket
to
the
quays
value
would
go
up
like
a
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Baldhead
over
the
blind
.
Cute
old
codger
.
No
use
canvassing
him
for
an
*NL*
ad
.
Still
he
knows
his
own
business
best
.
There
he
is
,
sure
enough
,
my
*NL*
bold
Larry
,
leaning
against
the
sugarbin
in
his
shirtsleeves
watching
*NL*
the
aproned
curate
swab
up
with

and
bucket
.
Simon
Dedalus
takes
him
*NL*
off
to
a

screwed

Do
you
know
what
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
tell
you
?
What
's
that
,
Mr
O'Rourke
?
Do
you
know
what
?
The
Russians
,
*NL*
they
'd
only
be
an
eight
o'clock
breakfast
for
the
Japanese
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stop
and
say
a
word
:
about
the
funeral
perhaps
.
Sad
thing
about
poor
*NL*
Dignam
,
Mr
O'Rourke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
into
Dorset
street
he
said
freshly
in
greeting
through
the
*NL*
doorway
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
day
,
Mr
O'Rourke
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good

to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lovely

*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
do
they
get
the
money
?
Coming
up
redheaded
curates
from
the
county
*NL*
Leitrim
,
rinsing
empties
and
old
man
in
the
cellar
.
Then
,
lo
and
behold
,
*NL*
they
blossom
out
as
Adam
Findlaters
or
Dan
Tallons
.
Then
thin
of
the
*NL*
competition
.
General
thirst
.
Good
puzzle
would
be
cross
Dublin
without
*NL*
passing
a
pub
.
Save
it
they
ca
n't
.
Off
the
drunks
perhaps
.
Put
down
*NL*
three
and
carry
five
.
What
is
that
,
a
bob
here
and
there
,
dribs
and
*NL*
drabs
.
On
the
wholesale
orders
perhaps
.
Doing
a
double
shuffle
with
the
*NL*
town
travellers
.
Square
it
you
with
the
boss
and
we
'll
split
the
job
,
*NL*
see
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
much
would
that
tot
to
off
the
porter
in

?
Say
ten

*NL*
of

.
Say
he
got
ten

O

He
passed

He
halted
before

,
staring
at
the
hanks
of
sausages
,
*NL*
polonies
,
black
and
white
.
Fifteen
multiplied
by

The
figures
whitened
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
unsolved
:
displeased
,
he
let
them
fade
.
The
shiny
links
,
*NL*
packed
with
forcemeat
,
fed
his
gaze
and
he
breathed
in
tranquilly
the
*NL*
lukewarm
breath
of
cooked
spicy
pigs
'
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
kidney
oozed

on
the

:
the

He
*NL*
stood
by
the
nextdoor
girl
at
the
counter
.
Would
she
buy
it
too
,
calling
*NL*
the
items
from
a
slip
in
her
hand
?
Chapped
:
washingsoda
.
And
a
pound
and
*NL*
a
half
of
Denny
's
sausages
.
His
eyes
rested
on
her
vigorous
hips
.
*NL*
Woods
his

Wonder
what
he
does
.
Wife

The

folded
the

had
snipped

blotchy

Sound
meat
there
:
like

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a

up
from
the
pile
of
cut
sheets
:

He
held
the

from

:

*NL*
read
it
nearer
,
the

,
the
blurred
cropping

,
the

rustling

A

Those

in
the
cattlemarket
,
the
*NL*
beasts
lowing
in
their

,
branded

,
flop
and
fall
of

,
the
*NL*
breeders
in
hobnailed

trudging
through

,
slapping
a

*NL*
on
a
ripemeated
hindquarter
,
there
's
a
prime
one
,
unpeeled

in
*NL*

He
held
the

aslant
patiently
,
bending
his
senses
and
*NL*
his
will
,
his
soft
subject
gaze
at
rest
.
The

swinging

*NL*

The
porkbutcher
snapped
two
sheets
from
the
pile
,
wrapped
up
her
prime
*NL*
sausages
and
made
a
red
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now

my

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tendered
a

smiling
boldly

holding

out

*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank

And
one

For
you
,
*NL*
please
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
pointed
quickly
.
To
catch
up
and
walk
behind
her
if
she
went
*NL*
slowly
,
behind
her
moving
hams
.
Pleasant
to
see
first
thing
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
Hurry
up
,
damn
it

Make
hay
while
the
sun
shines

She
stood
*NL*
outside
the
shop
in
sunlight
and
sauntered
lazily
to
the
right
.
He
*NL*
sighed
down
his
nose
:
they
never
understand
.
Sodachapped
hands
.
Crusted
*NL*
toenails
too
.
Brown
scapulars
in

,
defending
her
both

*NL*
The
sting
of
disregard
glowed
to
weak
pleasure
within
his
breast
.
For
*NL*
another
:
a

off

cuddling
her

*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
accepted
the
moist
tender
gland
and
slid
it
into
a
sidepocket
.
*NL*
Then
it
fetched
up
three
coins
from
his
trousers
'
pocket
and
laid
them
*NL*
on
the
rubber
prickles
.
They
lay
,
were
read
quickly
and
quickly
slid
,
*NL*
disc
by

,
into
the

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you

Another

*NL*
*NL*
A
speck
of
eager
fire
from

thanked
him
.
He
withdrew
his
gaze
*NL*
after
an
instant
.
No
:
better
not
:
another

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good

he
said

He
walked

we
had
then
.
Molly
in
Citron
's
*NL*
basketchair
.
Nice
to
hold
,
cool
waxen
fruit
,
hold
in
the
hand
,
lift
it
*NL*
to
the
nostrils
and
smell
the
perfume
.
Like
that
,
heavy
,
sweet
,
wild
*NL*
perfume
.
Always
the
same
,
year
after
year
.
They
fetched
high
prices
too
,
*NL*
Moisel
told
me
.
Arbutus
place
:
Pleasants
street
:
pleasant
old
times
.
*NL*
Must
be
without
a
flaw
,
he
said
.
Coming
all
that
way
:
Spain
,
Gibraltar
,
*NL*
Mediterranean
,
the
Levant
.
Crates
lined
up
on
the
quayside
at
Jaffa
,
*NL*
chap
ticking
them
off
in
a
book
,
navvies
handling
them
barefoot
in
*NL*
soiled
dungarees
.
There
's
whatdoyoucallhim
out
of
.
How
do
you
?
Does
n't
*NL*
see
.
Chap
you
know
just
to
salute
bit
of
a
bore
.
His
back
is
like
that
*NL*
Norwegian
captain
's
.
Wonder
if
I
'll
meet
him
today
.
Watering
cart
.
To
*NL*
provoke
the
rain
.
On
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cloud
began
to
cover
the
sun
slowly
,
wholly
.
Grey
.
Far
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
not
like
that
.
A
barren
land
,
bare
waste
.
Vulcanic
lake
,
the
dead
*NL*
sea
:
no
fish
,
weedless
,
sunk
deep
in
the
earth
.
No
wind
could
lift
those
*NL*
waves
,
grey
metal
,
poisonous
foggy
waters
.
Brimstone
they
called
it
*NL*
raining
down
:
the
cities
of
the
plain
:
Sodom
,
Gomorrah
,
Edom
.
All
dead
*NL*
names
.
A
dead
sea
in
a
dead
land
,
grey
and
old
.
Old
now
.
It
bore
the
*NL*
oldest
,
the
first
race
.
A
bent
hag
crossed
from
Cassidy
's
,
clutching
a
*NL*
naggin
bottle
by
the
neck
.
The
oldest
people
.
Wandered
far
away
over
*NL*
all
the
earth
,
captivity
to
captivity
,
multiplying
,
dying
,
being
born
*NL*
everywhere
.
It
lay
there
now
.
Now
it
could
bear
no
more
.
Dead
:
an
old
*NL*
woman
's
:
the
grey
sunken
cunt
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey
horror
seared
his
flesh
.
Folding
the
page
into
his
pocket
he
turned
*NL*
into
Eccles
street
,
hurrying
homeward
.
Cold
oils
slid
along
his
veins
,
*NL*
chilling
his
blood
:
age
crusting
him
with
a
salt
cloak
.
Well
,
I
am
here
*NL*
now
.
Yes
,
I
am
here
now
.
Morning
mouth
bad
images
.
Got
up
wrong
side
of
*NL*
the
bed
.
Must
begin
again
those
Sandow
's
exercises
.
On
the
hands
down
.
*NL*
Blotchy
brown
brick
houses
.
Number
eighty
still
unlet
.
Why
is
that
?
*NL*
Valuation
is
only
twenty-eight
.
Towers
,
Battersby
,
North
,
MacArthur
:
*NL*
parlour
windows
plastered
with
bills
.
Plasters
on
a
sore
eye
.
To
smell
*NL*
the
gentle
smoke
of
tea
,
fume
of
the
pan
,
sizzling
butter
.
Be
near
her
*NL*
ample
bedwarmed
flesh
.
Yes
,
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quick
warm
sunlight
came
running
from
Berkeley
road
,
swiftly
,
in
slim
*NL*
sandals
,
along
the
brightening
footpath
.
Runs
,
she
runs
to
meet
me
,
a
*NL*
girl
with
gold
hair
on
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
letters
and
a
card
lay
on
the
hallfloor
.
He
stooped
and
gathered
*NL*
them
.
Mrs
Marion
Bloom
.
His
quickened
heart
slowed
at
once
.
Bold
hand
.
*NL*
Mrs
Marion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Poldy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
the
bedroom
he
halfclosed
his
eyes
and
walked
through
warm
*NL*
yellow
twilight
towards
her
tousled
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
are
the
letters
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
them
.
Mullingar
.
Milly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
letter
for
me
from
Milly
,
he
said
carefully
,
and
a
card
to
you
.
And
*NL*
a
letter
for
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
her
card
and
letter
on
the
twill
bedspread
near
the
curve
of
her
*NL*
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
want
the
blind
up
?
*NL*
*NL*
Letting
the
blind
up
by
gentle
tugs
halfway
his
backward
eye
saw
her
*NL*
glance
at
the
letter
and
tuck
it
under
her
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
do
?
he
asked
,
turning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
reading
the
card
,
propped
on
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
got
the
things
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
till
she
had
laid
the
card
aside
and
curled
herself
back
*NL*
slowly
with
a
snug
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hurry
up
with
that
tea
,
she
said
.
I
'm
parched
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
kettle
is
boiling
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
delayed
to
clear
the
chair
:
her
striped
petticoat
,
tossed
soiled
*NL*
linen
:
and
lifted
all
in
an
armful
on
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
down
the
kitchen
stairs
she
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Poldy
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Scald
the
teapot
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
boil
sure
enough
:
a
plume
of
steam
from
the
spout
.
He
scalded
and
*NL*
rinsed
out
the
teapot
and
put
in
four
full
spoons
of
tea
,
tilting
the
*NL*
kettle
then
to
let
the
water
flow
in
.
Having
set
it
to
draw
he
took
off
*NL*
the
kettle
,
crushed
the
pan
flat
on
the
live
coals
and
watched
the
lump
*NL*
of
butter
slide
and
melt
.
While
he
unwrapped
the
kidney
the
cat
mewed
*NL*
hungrily
against
him
.
Give
her
too
much
meat
she
wo
n't
mouse
.
Say
they
*NL*
wo
n't
eat
pork
.
Kosher
.
Here
.
He
let
the
bloodsmeared
paper
fall
to
*NL*
her
and
dropped
the
kidney
amid
the
sizzling
butter
sauce
.
Pepper
.
He
*NL*
sprinkled
it
through
his
fingers
ringwise
from
the
chipped
eggcup
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
slit
open
his
letter
,
glancing
down
the
page
and
over
.
Thanks

The

was

He
filled

smiling

Silly
Milly
's
birthday
gift
.
Only
five
she
was
then
.
No
,
*NL*
wait
:
four
.
I
gave
her
the
amberoid
necklace
she
broke
.
Putting
pieces
*NL*
of
folded
brown
paper
in
the
letterbox
for
her
.
He
smiled
,
pouring
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
O
,
Milly
Bloom
,
you
are
my
darling
.
*NL*
You
are
my
lookingglass
from
night
to
morning
.
*NL*
I
'd
rather
have
you

Than

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
professor
Goodwin
.
Dreadful
old
case
.
Still
he
was
a
courteous
*NL*
old
chap
.
Oldfashioned
way
he
used
to
bow
Molly
off
the
platform
.
And
*NL*
the
little
mirror
in
his
silk
hat
.
The
night
Milly
brought
it
into
*NL*
the
parlour
.
O
,
look
what
I
found
in
professor
Goodwin
's
hat
!
All
we
*NL*
laughed
.
Sex
breaking
out
even
then
.
Pert
little
piece
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
prodded
a
fork
into
the
kidney
and
slapped
it
over
:
then
fitted
the
*NL*
teapot
on
the
tray
.
Its
hump
bumped
as
he
took
it
up
.
Everything
on
*NL*
it
?
Bread
and
butter
,
four
,
sugar
,
spoon
,
her
cream
.
Yes
.
He
carried
it
*NL*
upstairs
,
his
thumb
hooked
in
the
teapot
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nudging
the
door
open
with
his
knee
he
carried
the
tray
in
and
set
it
on
*NL*
the
chair
by
the
bedhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
a
time
you
were
!
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
the
brasses
jingling
as
she
raised
herself
briskly
,
an
elbow
on
*NL*
the
pillow
.
He
looked
calmly
down
on
her
bulk
and
between
her
large
soft
*NL*
bubs
,
sloping
within
her
nightdress
like
a
shegoat
's
udder
.
The
warmth
*NL*
of
her
couched
body
rose
on
the
air
,
mingling
with
the
fragrance
of
the
*NL*
tea
she
poured
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strip
of
torn
envelope
peeped
from
under
the
dimpled
pillow
.
In
the
*NL*
act
of
going
he
stayed
to
straighten
the
bedspread
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
was
the
letter
from
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bold
hand
.
Marion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
Boylan
,
she
said
.
He
's
bringing
the
programme
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
are
you
singing
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
La
ci
darem
_
with
J.
C.
Doyle
,
she
said
,
and
_
Love
's
Old
Sweet
Song
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
full
lips
,
drinking
,
smiled
.
Rather
stale
smell
that
incense
leaves
*NL*
next
day
.
Like
foul
flowerwater
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Would
you
like
the
window
open
a
little
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
doubled
a
slice
of
bread
into
her
mouth
,
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
time
is
the
funeral
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Eleven
,
I
think
,
he
answered
.
I
did
n't
see
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
the
pointing
of
her
finger
he
took
up
a
leg
of
her
soiled
*NL*
drawers
from
the
bed
.
No
?
Then
,
a
twisted
grey
garter
looped
round
a
*NL*
stocking
:
rumpled
,
shiny
sole
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
:
that
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
stocking
.
Her
petticoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
must
have
fell
down
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
here
and
there
.
_
Voglio
e
non
vorrei
_
.
Wonder
if
she
pronounces
*NL*
that
right
:
_
voglio
_
.
Not
in
the
bed
.
Must
have
slid
down
.
He
stooped
*NL*
and
lifted
the
valance
.
The
book
,
fallen
,
sprawled
against
the
bulge
of
*NL*
the
orangekeyed
chamberpot
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Show
here
,
she
said
.
I
put
a
mark
in
it
.
There
's
a
word
I
wanted
to
*NL*
ask
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
swallowed
a
draught
of
tea
from
her
cup
held
by
nothandle
and
,
*NL*
having
wiped
her
fingertips
smartly
on
the
blanket
,
began
to
search
the
*NL*
text
with
the
hairpin
till
she
reached
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Met
him
what
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
,
she
said
.
What
does
that
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
downward
and
read
near
her
polished
thumbnail
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Metempsychosis
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
Who
's
he
when
he
's
at
home
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Metempsychosis
,
he
said
,
frowning
.
It
's
Greek
:
from
the
Greek
.
That
*NL*
means
the
transmigration
of
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
rocks
!
she
said
.
Tell
us
in
plain
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
glancing
askance
at
her
mocking
eyes
.
The
same
young
eyes
.
*NL*
The
first
night
after
the
charades
.
Dolphin

He
turned
over

Did

he
asked

*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes

she
said

There
's
nothing

in
it

Is
she
in

She
poured

watching

Reincarnation

*NL*

Some

he
said
,
that
we
go
on
living
in
another
body
*NL*
after
death
,
that
we
lived
before
.
They
call
it
reincarnation

That
*NL*
we
all
lived
before
on
the
earth
thousands
of
years
ago
or
some
other
*NL*

They
say

Not

down

*NL*
I
gave
for
the

She
said
it
would
look
nice

Naked

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
the
pages
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Metempsychosis
,
he
said
,
is
what
the
ancient
Greeks
called
it
.
They
*NL*
used
to
believe
you
could
be
changed
into
an
animal

a

,
for

instance

What
they
called

,
for

*NL*
Her

ceased
to
stir
up
the

She
gazed
straight
before

,
*NL*
inhaling
through
her
arched
nostrils
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
a
smell
of
burn
,
she
said
.
Did
you
leave
anything
on
the
fire
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
kidney
!
he
cried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fitted
the
book
roughly
into
his
inner
pocket
and
,
stubbing
his
toes
*NL*
against
the
broken
commode
,
hurried
out
towards
the
smell
,
stepping
*NL*
hastily
down
the
stairs
with
a
flurried
stork
's
legs
.
Pungent
smoke
shot
*NL*
up
in
an
angry
jet
from
a
side
of
the
pan
.
By
prodding
a
prong
of
the
*NL*
fork
under
the
kidney
he
detached
it
and
turned
it
turtle
on
its
back
.
*NL*
Only
a
little
burnt
.
He
tossed
it
off
the
pan
on
to
a
plate
and
let
the
*NL*
scanty
brown
gravy
trickle
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cup
of
tea
now
.
He
sat
down
,
cut
and
buttered
a
slice
of
the
loaf
.
*NL*
He
shore
away
the
burnt
flesh
and
flung
it
to
the
cat
.
Then
he
put
a
*NL*
forkful
into
his
mouth
,
chewing
with
discernment
the
toothsome
pliant
*NL*
meat
.
Done
to
a
turn
.
A
mouthful
of
tea
.
Then
he
cut
away
dies
of
bread
,
*NL*
sopped
one
in
the
gravy
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
.
What
was
that
about
*NL*
some
young
student
and
a
picnic
?
He
creased
out
the
letter
at
his
side
,
*NL*
reading
it
slowly
as
he
chewed
,
sopping
another
die
of
bread
in
the
*NL*
gravy
and
raising
it
to
his
mouth
.

The

having

returned

*NL*
nosed
at

stalked
to

She
looked

mewing

Wants

*NL*
He
felt
heavy

full
:
then
a
gentle
loosening
of
his

He
stood
up

*NL*
undoing
the

The

mewed

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tabledrawer
he
found
an
old
number
of
_
Titbits
_
.
He
folded
it
*NL*
under
his
armpit
,
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
The
cat
went
up
in
*NL*
soft
bounds
.
Ah

wanted
to
go
upstairs
,
curl
up
in
a
ball
on

*NL*
Listening

he
heard
her
voice
:

Come

*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
through

backdoor
into
the
garden
:
stood
to
listen

towards
the
next
garden

No

Perhaps
hanging

out

*NL*
The

was
in

Fine

*NL*
He
bent
down

*NL*
Make

Must

Funny

Better

He
went
in

bowing
his

*NL*
under
the
low
lintel
.
Leaving
the
door
ajar
,
amid
the
stench
of
mouldy
*NL*
limewash
and
stale
cobwebs
he
undid
his
braces

Before
sitting
down
he
*NL*
peered
through

up

Quietly

yielding

began
the

Midway
,
his
last
resistance

he
*NL*
allowed
his
bowels
to
ease
themselves
quietly
as
he
read

reading
still
*NL*
patiently
that
slight
constipation
of

He
glanced
back
through
what
he
had
read
and
,
while
feeling
his
water
*NL*
flow
quietly
,
he
envied
kindly

He
tore
away
half

sharply
and
wiped
himself
with
it

*NL*
Then
he
girded
up
his
trousers

braced
and
buttoned
himself
.
He
pulled
*NL*
back
the
jerky
shaky
door
of
the
jakes
and
came
forth

In

And

He
turned
*NL*
from
the
morning
noises
of
the
quayside
and
walked
through
Lime
street
.
*NL*
By
Brady
's
cottages
a
boy
for
the
skins
lolled
,
his
bucket
of
offal
*NL*
linked
,
smoking
a
chewed
fagbutt
.
A
smaller
girl
with
scars
of
eczema
*NL*
on
her
forehead
eyed
him
,
listlessly
holding
her
battered
caskhoop
.
Tell
*NL*
him
if
he
smokes
he
wo
n't
grow
.
O
let
him
!
His
life
is
n't
such
a
bed
of
*NL*
roses
.
Waiting
outside

to
bring

Come

Slack

He
crossed
Townsend

,
passed
*NL*
the
frowning
face
of
Bethel
.
El

yes
:
house
of

Aleph

And
past
*NL*
Nichols
'
the

At

it

Time
enough
.
Daresay
Corny
*NL*
Kelleher
bagged
the
job
for
O'Neill

Singing
with
his

shut
.
*NL*
Corny
.
Met
her
once
in
the
park
.
In
the
dark
.
What
a
lark
.
Police
tout
.
*NL*
Her
name
and
address
she
then
told
with
my
tooraloom
tooraloom
tay
.
*NL*
O

he
bagged
it

Bury

*NL*
*NL*
In
Westland
row
he
halted
before
the
window
of
the
Belfast
and
Oriental
*NL*
Tea
Company
and
read
the
legends
of
leadpapered
packets
:
choice

,
*NL*
finest
quality
,
family
tea
.
Rather
warm
.
Tea
.
Must
get
some
from
Tom
*NL*
Kernan
.
Could
n't
ask
him
at
a
funeral
,
though
.
While
his
eyes
still
read
*NL*
blandly
he
took
off
his
hat
quietly
inhaling
his
hairoil
and
sent
his
*NL*
right
hand
with
slow
grace
over
his
brow
and
hair
.
Very
warm
morning
.
*NL*
Under
their
dropped
lids
his
eyes
found
the
tiny
bow
of
the
leather
*NL*
headband
inside
his
high
grade
ha
.
Just
there
.
His
right
hand
came
down
*NL*
into
the
bowl
of
his
hat
.
His
fingers
found
quickly
a
card
behind
the
*NL*
headband
and
transferred
it
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
warm
.
His
right
hand
once
more
more
slowly
went
over
his
brow
and
*NL*
hair
.
Then
he
put
on
his
hat
again
,
relieved
:
and
read
again
:
choice
*NL*
blend
,
made
of
the
finest
Ceylon
brands
.
The
far
east
.
Lovely
spot
it
*NL*
must
be
:
the
garden
of
the
world
,
big
lazy
leaves
to
float
about
on
,
*NL*
cactuses
,
flowery
meads
,
snaky
lianas
they
call
them
.
Wonder
is
it
like
*NL*
that
.
Those
Cinghalese
lobbing
about
in
the
sun
in
_
dolce
far
niente
_
,
*NL*
not
doing
a
hand
's
turn
all
day
.
Sleep
six
months
out
of
twelve
.
Too
hot
*NL*
to
quarrel
.
Influence
of
the
climate
.
Lethargy
.
Flowers
of
idleness
.
The
*NL*
air
feeds
most
.
Azotes
.
Hothouse
in
Botanic
gardens
.
Sensitive
plants
.
*NL*
Waterlilies
.
Petals
too
tired
to
.
Sleeping
sickness
in
the
air
.
Walk
on
*NL*
roseleaves
.
Imagine
trying
to
eat
tripe
and
cowheel
.
Where
was
the
chap
*NL*
I
saw
in
that
picture
somewhere
?
Ah
yes
,
in
the
dead
sea
floating
on
his
*NL*
back
,
reading
a
book
with
a
parasol
open
.
Could
n't
sink
if
you
tried
:
so
*NL*
thick
with
salt
.
Because
the
weight
of
the
water
,
no
,
the
weight
of
*NL*
the
body
in
the
water
is
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
what
?
Or
is
it
the
*NL*
volume
is
equal
to
the
weight
?
It
's
a
law
something
like
that
.
Vance
in
*NL*
High
school
cracking
his
fingerjoints
,
teaching
.
The
college
curriculum

*NL*
Cracking

What
is
weight
really
when
you
say
the
weight
?
*NL*
Thirtytwo
feet
per

per

.
Law
of
falling
bodies
:
per
second
*NL*
per
second
.
They
all
fall
to
the
ground
.
The
earth
.
It
's
the
force
of
*NL*
gravity
of
the
earth
is
the
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
and
sauntered
across
the
road
.
How
did
she
walk
with
her
*NL*
sausages
?
Like
that
something
.
As
he
walked
he
took
the
folded
_
Freeman
_
*NL*
from
his
sidepocket
,
unfolded
it
,
rolled
it
lengthwise
in
a
baton
and
*NL*
tapped
it
at
each
sauntering
step
against
his
trouserleg
.
Careless
air
:
*NL*
just
drop
in
to
see
.
Per
second
per
second
.
Per
second
for
every
second
*NL*
it
means
.
From
the
curbstone
he
darted
a
keen
glance
through
the
door
of
*NL*
the
postoffice
.
Too
late
box
.
Post
here
.
No-one
.
In

*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
the
card
through
the
brass
grill
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
there
any
letters
for
me
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
postmistress
searched
a
pigeonhole
he
gazed
at
the
recruiting
*NL*
poster
with
soldiers
of
all
arms
on
parade
:
and
held
the
tip
of
his
*NL*
baton
against
his
nostrils
,
smelling
freshprinted
rag
paper
.
No
answer
*NL*
probably
.
Went
too
far
last
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postmistress
handed
him
back
through
the
grill
his
card
with
a
*NL*
letter
.
He
thanked
her
and
glanced
rapidly
at
the
typed
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*

Answered

He
slipped
card
and
letter
into
his
sidepocket
,
*NL*
reviewing
again
the
soldiers
on
parade
.
Where
's

Tweedy

*NL*
Castoff

There
:

No

Pointed

.
There
he
is
:
royal
Dublin

Redcoats

*NL*
Too
showy

That
must
be
why
the
women
go
after
them

Uniform

Easier
to
*NL*
enlist
and
drill

Maud

about

off

at

*NL*
*NL*
He
strolled
out
of
the
postoffice
and
turned
to
the
right
.
Talk
:
as
if
*NL*
that
would
mend
matters
.
His
hand
went
into
his
pocket
and
a
forefinger
*NL*
felt
its
way
under
the
flap
of
the
envelope
,
ripping
it
open
in
jerks
.
*NL*
Women
will
pay
a
lot
of

do

His
fingers
drew
forth
the
*NL*
letter
the
letter
and
crumpled
the
envelope
in
his
pocket
.
Something
*NL*
pinned
on

No

*NL*
*NL*
His

on

he
asked
with
low
respect
:

Mr

gazed
across

outsider
drawn
up
before

of
the
Grosvenor

The
porter
hoisted
the
valise
up
on

She
*NL*
stood
still
,
waiting
,
while
the

like

*NL*
searched
his

for
change

Stylish
kind
of
coat
with
that

*NL*
collar
,
warm
for

like
this

looks

Careless

Like

Having

Drawing
back
his

and
gazing
far
from

*NL*
his
vailed
eyelids
he
saw
the
bright
fawn
skin
shine
in

the

braided

Clearly
I
can
see

Moisture

And
he
said

What
Paddy

I
*NL*
said

_
Poor

*NL*
Off

I
said

I

's
a
*NL*
drowning
case
at
Sandycove
may
turn
up
and
then
the
coroner
and
myself
*NL*
would
have
to
go
down
if
the
body
is
found
.
You
just
shove
in
my
name
if
*NL*
I
'm
not
there
,
will
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
do
that
,
Mr
Bloom
said
,
moving
to
get
off
.
That
'll
be
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Right
,
M'Coy
said
brightly
.
Thanks
,
old
man
.
I
'd
go
if
I
possibly
*NL*
could
.
Well
,
tolloll
.
Just
C.
P.
M'Coy
will
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
will
be
done
,
Mr
Bloom
answered
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
n't
catch
me
napping
that
wheeze
.
The
quick
touch
.
Soft
mark
.
I
'd
*NL*
like
my
job
.
Valise
I
have
a
particular
fancy
for
.
Leather
.
Capped
*NL*
corners
,
rivetted
edges
,
double

Bob
Cowley
lent
him
*NL*
his
for
the
Wicklow
regatta
concert
last
year
and
never
heard
tidings
of
*NL*
it
from
that
good
day
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
,
strolling
towards
Brunswick
street
,
smiled
.
My
missus
has
just
*NL*
got
an
.
Reedy
freckled
soprano
.
Cheeseparing
nose
.
Nice
enough
in
its
*NL*
way
:
for
a
little
ballad
.
No
guts
in
it
.
You
and
me
,
do
n't
you
know
:
*NL*
in
the
same
boat
.
Softsoaping
.
Give
you
the
needle
that
would
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
he
hear
the
difference
?
Think
he
's
that
way
inclined
a
bit
.
Against
*NL*
my
grain
somehow
.
Thought
that
Belfast
would
fetch
him
.
I
hope
that
*NL*
smallpox
up
there
does
n't
get
worse
.
Suppose
she
would
n't
let
herself
be
*NL*
vaccinated
again
.
Your
wife
and
my
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wonder
is
he
pimping
after
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
stood
at
the
corner
,
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
multicoloured
*NL*
hoardings
.
Cantrell
and
Cochrane
's
Ginger
Ale
-LRB-
Aromatic
-RRB-
.
Clery

No

he
's
going
on
straight
.
Hello

_
Leah
_
tonight

Mrs
Bandmann
*NL*
Palmer
.
Like
to
see
her
again
in
that
.
_
Hamlet
_
she
played
last
night
.
*NL*
Male
impersonator
.
Perhaps
he
was
a
woman
.
Why
Ophelia
committed
*NL*
suicide
.
Poor
papa
!
How
he
used
to
talk
of
Kate
Bateman
in
that
.
Outside
*NL*
the
Adelphi
in
London
waited
all
the
afternoon
to
get
in
.
Year
before
*NL*
I
was
born
that
was
:
sixtyfive
.
And
Ristori
in
Vienna
.
What
is
this
the
*NL*
right
name
is
?
By
Mosenthal
it
is
.
Rachel
,
is
it
?
No
.
The
scene
he
was
*NL*
always
talking
about
where
the
old
blind
Abraham
recognises
the
voice
*NL*
and
puts
his
fingers
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nathan
's
voice
!
His
son
's
voice
!
I
hear
the
voice
of
Nathan
who
left
his
*NL*
father
to
die
of
grief
and
misery
in
my
arms
,
who
left
the
house
of
his
*NL*
father
and
left
the
God
of
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
word
is
so
deep
,
Leopold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
papa
!
Poor
man
!
I
'm
glad
I
did
n't
go
into
the
room
to
look
at
his
*NL*
face
.
That
day
!
O
,
dear
!
O
,
dear
!
Ffoo
!
Well
,
perhaps
it
was
best
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
went
round
the
corner
and
passed
the
drooping
nags
of
the
*NL*
hazard
.
No
use
thinking
of
it
any
more
.
Nosebag
time
.
Wish
I
had
n't
met
*NL*
that
M'Coy
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
nearer
and
heard
a
crunching
of
gilded
oats
,
the
gently
champing
*NL*
teeth
.
Their
full
buck
eyes
regarded
him
as
he
went
by
,
amid
the
sweet
*NL*
oaten
reek
of
horsepiss
.
Their
Eldorado
.
Poor
jugginses
!
Damn
all
they
*NL*
know
or
care
about
anything
with
their
long
noses
stuck
in
nosebags
.
*NL*
Too
full
for
words
.
Still
they
get
their
feed
all
right
and
their
doss
.
*NL*
Gelded
too
:
a
stump
of
black
guttapercha
wagging
limp
between
their
*NL*
haunches
.
Might
be
happy
all
the
same
that
way
.
Good
poor
brutes
they
*NL*
look
.
Still
their
neigh
can
be
very
irritating
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
folded
it
into
the
newspaper
he
*NL*
carried
.
Might
just
walk
into
her
here
.
The
lane
is
safer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
the
cabman
's
shelter
.
Curious
the
life
of
drifting
cabbies
.
*NL*
All
weathers
,
all
places
,
time
or
setdown
,
no
will
of
their
own
.

Voglio

Like
to
give
them
an
odd
cigarette
.
Sociable
.
Shout
a
few
flying
*NL*
syllables
as
they
pass

He
hummed
:

*NL*

He
turned
into
Cumberland
street
and
,
going
on
some
paces
,
halted
in
the
*NL*
lee
of
the
station
wall
.
No-one
.
Meade
's
timberyard
.
Piled
balks
.
Ruins
*NL*
and
tenements
.
With
careful
tread
he
passed
over
a
hopscotch
court
with
*NL*
its
forgotten
pickeystone
.
Not
a
sinner
.
Near
the
timberyard
a
squatted
*NL*
child
at
marbles
,
alone
,
shooting
the
taw
with
a
cunnythumb
.
A
wise
*NL*
tabby
,
a
blinking
sphinx
,
watched
from
her
warm
sill
.
Pity
to
disturb
*NL*
them
.
Mohammed
cut
a
piece
out
of
his
mantle
not
to
wake

Open
it

*NL*
And
once
I
played
marbles
when
I
went
to
that
old
dame
's
school
.
She
*NL*
liked
mignonette

Mrs
Ellis

And
Mr

He
opened
the
letter
within
the
*NL*
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flower
.
I
think
it
's
a
.
A
yellow
flower
with
flattened
petals
.
Not
*NL*
annoyed
then
?
What
does
she
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Henry
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
your
last
letter
to
me
and
thank
you
very
much
for
it
.
I
am
sorry
*NL*
you
did
not
like
my
last
letter
.
Why
did
you
enclose
the
stamps
?
I
am
*NL*
awfully
angry
with
you
.
I
do
wish
I
could
punish
you
for
that
.
I
called
*NL*
you
naughty
boy
because
I
do
not
like
that
other
world
.
Please
tell
me
*NL*
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
that
word
?
Are
you
not
happy
in
your
home
*NL*
you
poor
little
naughty
boy
?
I
do
wish
I
could
do
something
for
you
.
*NL*
Please
tell
me
what
you
think
of
poor
me
.
I
often
think
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
name
you
have
.
Dear
Henry
,
when
will
we
meet
?
I
think
of
you
so
often
*NL*
you
have
no
idea
.
I
have
never
felt
myself
so
much
drawn
to
a
man
as
*NL*
you
.
I
feel
so
bad
about
.
Please
write
me
a
long
letter
and
tell
me
*NL*
more
.
Remember
if
you
do
not
I
will
punish
you
.
So
now
you
know
what
I
*NL*
will
do
to
you
,
you
naughty
boy
,
if
you
do
not
wrote
.
O
how
I
long
to
*NL*
meet
you

Henry
dear
,
do
not
deny
my
request
before
my
patience

*NL*
exhausted

Then
I
will
tell
you
all

Goodbye

P.

Do
tell
me

know

*NL*
He
tore
the
flower
gravely
from
its
pinhold
smelt
its
almost
no
smell
*NL*
and
placed
it
in
his
heart
pocket

Language
of
flowers
.
They
like
it
*NL*
because
no-one
can
hear
.
Or
a
poison
bouquet
to
strike
him
down
.
Then
*NL*
walking
slowly
forward
he
read
the
letter
again
,
murmuring
here
and
*NL*
there
a
word
.
Angry

meet

*NL*
Having
read
it
all
he
took
it
from
the
newspaper
and
put
it
back
in
his
*NL*
sidepocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weak
joy
opened
his
lips
.
Changed
since
the
first
letter

Wonder
did
she
*NL*
wrote
it
herself

Doing
the
indignant

*NL*

Could
meet

Thank

Then
running
round

*NL*
Bad

Cigar

Narcotic

Go

Naughty

Try

A

*NL*
*NL*
Fingering
still
the
letter
in
his
pocket
he
drew
the
pin
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Common
pin
,
eh
?
He
threw
it
on
the
road
.
Out
of
her

somewhere
:
*NL*
pinned
together

Queer

No

Flat

Nice

She
listens
with

Tell

Then
a

silence

Long

Going
under

arch
he
took
out
the
envelope

tore
it
swiftly
*NL*
in
shreds
and
scattered
them
towards
the
road

The
shreds
fluttered

away

sank
in

a

Something
going

Nice

some

Who
is
my

Jammed
by

to
slow

music

That
woman
at
midnight
mass
.
Seventh

Women
knelt
in
the
*NL*
benches
with
crimson
halters
round
their
necks
,
heads
bowed
.
A
batch
*NL*
knelt
at
the
altarrails
.
The
priest
went
along
by
them
,
murmuring
,
*NL*
holding
the
thing
in
his
hands
.
He
stopped
at
each
,
took
out
a
*NL*
communion
,
shook
a
drop
or
two
-LRB-
are
they
in
water
?
-RRB-
off
it
and
put
it
*NL*
neatly
into
her
mouth
.
Her
hat
and
head
sank
.
Then
the
next
one
.
Her
hat
*NL*
sank
at
once
.
Then
the
next
one
:
a
small
old
woman
.
The
priest
bent
down
*NL*
to
put
it
into
her
mouth
,
murmuring
all
the
time
.
Latin
.
The
next
one
.
*NL*
Shut
your
eyes
and
open

What

They

only

it
down

Rum
idea
:
eating
bits
of
a
*NL*

Why

cotton

*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
aside
watching
their
blind
masks
pass
down
the
aisle
,
one
by
*NL*
one
,
and
seek
their
places
.
He
approached
a
bench
and
seated
himself
in
*NL*
its
corner
,
nursing
his
hat
and
newspaper
.
These
pots
we
have
to
wear
.
*NL*
We
ought
to
have
hats
modelled
on
our

They
were
about
him
here
*NL*
and
there
,
with
heads
still
bowed
in
their
crimson
halters
,
waiting
for
*NL*
it
to
melt
in
their
stomachs
.
Something
like
those
mazzoth
:
it
's
that
*NL*
sort
of
bread
:
unleavened

.
Look
at
them

Now
I
bet
it
makes
*NL*
them
feel
happy

Yes

He
saw
the

stow
the

cup
away
,
well
in

and
kneel
an
*NL*
instant
before
it

showing
a
large

And

And
plotting

Those

*NL*
now
that
's
a

there
's
always
something
shiftylooking

Mr

Not

*NL*
Who

I
wonder

Old

knew
how
to
make
that

the

:
fifty

say
he
had

Could
hear

I
told
her
to
pitch

against

I
could
feel
the

in

Must

He
saw
the
priest
bend
down
and
kiss
the
altar
and
then
face
about

*NL*
bless
all
the

All
crossed

Mr

stood

looking

Then
all
settled
down
on

again
*NL*
and
he
sat
back
quietly
in
his
bench

The
priest
came
down
from
the
*NL*
altar
,
holding
the
thing
out
from
him
,
and
he
and
the
massboy
answered
*NL*
each

in
Latin

Then
the
priest
knelt
down
and
began
to
read
off
a

card
:

*NL*
He
strolled
out

the

under

,
the

in

At

said

his

said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I

Mr

answered
.
I
was
going

away
*NL*
that
moment

*NL*
*NL*
Bantam
Lyons
doubted
an

,
leering
:
then
thrust
the
outspread

back
on
Mr

.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
He
sped

God

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

folded
the
sheets
again
to
a

lodged
the

in
it

smiling

*NL*
He
foresaw
his
pale
body
reclined
in
it
at
full
,
naked
,
in
a
womb
of
*NL*
warmth
,
oiled
by
scented
melting
soap
,
softly
laved
.
He
saw
his
*NL*
trunk
and
limbs
riprippled
over
and
sustained
,
buoyed
lightly
upward
,
*NL*
lemonyellow
:
his
navel
,
bud
of

:
and
saw
the
dark
tangled
curls
of
*NL*
his
bush
floating
,
floating
hair
of
the
stream
around
the
limp
father
of
*NL*
thousands

a

*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
,
first
,
poked
his
silkhatted
head
into
the
creaking
*NL*
carriage
and
,
entering
deftly
,
seated
himself
.
Mr
Power
stepped
in
after
*NL*
him
,
curving
his
height
with
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
on

Simon

After

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

covered
himself
quickly
and
got
in
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
we
all
here
now
?
Martin
Cunningham
asked
.
Come
along
,
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
entered
and
sat
in
the
vacant
place
.
He
pulled
the
door
to
*NL*
after
him
and
slammed
it
twice
till
it
shut
tight
.
He
passed
an
arm
*NL*
through
the
armstrap
and
looked
seriously
from
the
open
carriagewindow
*NL*
at
the
lowered
blinds
of
the
avenue
.
One
dragged
aside
:
an
old
woman
*NL*
peeping
.
Nose
whiteflattened
against
the
pane
.
Thanking
her
stars
she
*NL*
was
passed
over
.
Extraordinary
the
interest
they
take
in
a
corpse
.
Glad
*NL*
to
see
us
go
we
give
them
such
trouble
coming

Job

*NL*
Huggermugger
in

Slop
about
in

he
'd

wake

Then

Laying

Pull

Never

Wash

I

*NL*
All
waited
.
Nothing
was
said
.
Stowing
in
the
wreaths
probably
.
I
am
*NL*
sitting
on
something
hard
.
Ah
,
that
soap
:
in
my
hip
pocket
.
Better
shift
*NL*
it
out
of
that
.
Wait
for
an
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
waited
.
Then
wheels
were
heard
from
in
front
,
turning
:
then
nearer
:
*NL*
then
horses
'
hoofs
.
A
jolt
.
Their
carriage
began
to
move
,
creaking
and
*NL*
swaying
.
Other
hoofs
and
creaking
wheels
started
behind
.
The
blinds
of
*NL*
the
avenue
passed
and
number
nine
with
its
craped
knocker
,
door
ajar
.
At
*NL*
walking
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
still
,
their
knees
jogging
,
till
they
had
turned
and
were
*NL*
passing
along
the
tramtracks
.
Tritonville
road
.
Quicker
.
The
wheels
*NL*
rattled
rolling
over
the
cobbled
causeway
and
the
crazy
glasses
shook
*NL*
rattling
in
the
doorframes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
way
is
he
taking
us
?
Mr
Power
asked
through
both
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Irishtown
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
Ringsend
.
Brunswick
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
nodded
,
looking
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
fine
old
custom
,
he
said
.
I
am
glad
to
see
it
has
not
died
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
watched
awhile
through
their
windows
caps
and
hats
lifted
by
*NL*
passers
.
Respect
.
The
carriage
swerved
from
the
tramtrack
to
the
*NL*
smoother
road
past
Watery
lane
.
Mr
Bloom
at
gaze
saw
a
lithe
young
man
,
*NL*
clad
in
mourning
,
a
wide
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
a
friend
of
yours
gone
by
,
Dedalus
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Your
son
and
heir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
is
he
?
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
stretching
over
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
,
passing
the
open
drains
and
mounds
of
rippedup
roadway
*NL*
before
the
tenement
houses
,
lurched
round
the
corner
and
,
swerving
back
*NL*
to
the
tramtrack
,
rolled
on
noisily
with
chattering
wheels
.
Mr
Dedalus
*NL*
fell
back
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Was
that
Mulligan
cad
with
him
?
His
_
fidus
Achates
_
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
He
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Down
with
his
aunt
Sally
,
I
suppose
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
the
Goulding
*NL*
faction
,
the
drunken
little
costdrawer
and
Crissie
,
papa
's
little
lump
*NL*
of
dung
,
the
wise
child
that
knows
her
own
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr

smiled
joylessly
on
Ringsend
road
.
Wallace
Bros
:
the
*NL*
bottleworks
:
Dodder
bridge

*NL*
*NL*
Richie
Goulding
and
the

.
Goulding
,
Collis
and
Ward
he
calls
*NL*
the

.
His
jokes
are
getting
a
bit
damp
.
Great
card
he
was
.
Waltzing
*NL*
in
Stamer
street
with
Ignatius
Gallaher
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
the
*NL*
landlady
's
two
hats
pinned
on
his
head
.
Out
on
the
rampage
all
night
.
*NL*
Beginning
to
tell
on
him
now
:
that
backache
of
his
,
I
fear
.
Wife
ironing
*NL*
his
back
.
Thinks
he
'll
cure
it
with
pills
.
All
breadcrumbs
they
are
.
*NL*
About
six
hundred
per
cent
profit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
in
with
a
lowdown
crowd
,
Mr
Dedalus
snarled
.
That
Mulligan
is
a
*NL*
contaminated
bloody
doubledyed
ruffian
by
all
accounts
.
His
name
stinks
*NL*
all
over
Dublin
.
But
with
the
help
of
God
and
His
blessed
mother
I
'll
*NL*
make
it
my
business
to
write
a
letter
one
of
those
days
to
his
mother
*NL*
or
his
aunt
or
whatever
she
is
that
will
open
her
eye
as
wide
as
a
gate
.
*NL*
I
'll
tickle
his
catastrophe
,
believe
you
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cried
above
the
clatter
of
the
wheels
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wo
n't
have
her
bastard
of
a
nephew
ruin

A

Selling

M'Swiney

Not

*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
.
Mr
Bloom
glanced
from
his
angry
moustache
to
Mr
Power
's
mild
*NL*
face
and
Martin
Cunningham
's
eyes
and
beard
,
gravely
shaking
.
Noisy
*NL*
selfwilled
man
.
Full
of
his
son
.
He
is
right

Something
to
hand
on
.
If
*NL*
little
Rudy
had
lived
.
See
him
grow
up
.
Hear
his
voice
in
the
house
.
*NL*
Walking
beside
Molly
in
an
Eton
suit
.
My
son
.
Me
in
his
eyes
.
Strange
*NL*
feeling
it
would
be
.
From
me
.
Just
a
chance
.
Must
have
been
that
morning
*NL*
in
Raymond
terrace
she
was
at
the

watching
the
two

at

by
*NL*
the

of

And
the

grinning
up

She
had
*NL*
that

never
stitched

Give

God

How

*NL*
*NL*
Got
big

Had
to
refuse
the

My

*NL*
I
could

helped
him

I

Make

Mr

asked

said

looking

The

heeled
over

back
,
their
four
trunks
swaying

*NL*
*NL*
--
Corny
might
have
given

a

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*

Mr

said
,
if
he
had

that
squint
troubling
him

Do
*NL*
you
follow
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his

Martin
Cunningham
began
to
brush
away

crustcrumbs
from
under
his

in

*NL*
*NL*
--
Someone
seems
to
have
been
making
a
picnic
party
here
lately
,
Mr
Power
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
raised
their
thighs
and
eyed
with
disfavour
the
mildewed
buttonless
*NL*
leather
of
the
seats
.
Mr
Dedalus
,
twisting
his
nose
,
frowned
downward
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Unless
I
'm
greatly
mistaken
.
What
do
you
think
,
Martin
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
struck
me
too
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
set
his
thigh
down
.
Glad
I
took
that
bath
.
Feel
my
feet
quite
*NL*
clean
.
But
I
wish
Mrs
Fleming
had
darned
these
socks
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
sighed
resignedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
all
,
he
said
,
it
's
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
Tom
Kernan
turn
up
?
Martin
Cunningham
asked
,
twirling
the
peak
of
*NL*
his
beard
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Bloom
answered
.
He
's
behind
with
Ned
Lambert
and
Hynes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
Corny
Kelleher
himself
?
Mr
Power
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
At
the
cemetery
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
met
M'Coy
this
morning
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
He
said
he
'd
try
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
halted
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
wrong
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
're
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
are
we
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
grand
canal
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gasworks
.
Whooping
cough
they
say
it
cures
.
Good
job
Milly
never
got
*NL*
it
.
Poor
children
!
Doubles
them
up
black
and
blue
in
convulsions
.
Shame
*NL*
really
.
Got
off
lightly
with
illnesses
compared
.
Only
measles
.
Flaxseed
*NL*
tea
.
Scarlatina
,
influenza
epidemics
.
Canvassing
for

.
Do
n't
miss
*NL*
this
chance

Dogs

Poor

Athos
!
Be
good
to

,
*NL*
Leopold
,
is
my
last
wish
.
Thy
will
be
done
.
We
obey
them
in
the
grave
.
*NL*
A
dying
scrawl
.
He
took
it
to
heart
,
pined
away
.
Quiet
brute
.
Old
men
's
*NL*
dogs
usually
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
raindrop
spat
on
his
hat
.
He
drew
back
and
saw
an
instant
of
shower
*NL*
spray
dots
over
the
grey
flags
.
Apart
.
Curious
.
Like
through
a
colander
.
*NL*
I
thought
it
would
.
My
boots
were
creaking
I
remember
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
weather
is
changing
,
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
pity
it
did
not
keep
up
fine
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wanted
for
the
country
,
Mr
Power
said
.
There
's
the
sun
again
coming
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
,
peering
through
his
glasses
towards
the
veiled
sun
,
hurled
a
*NL*
mute
curse
at
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
as
uncertain
as
a
child
's
bottom
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
're
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
turned
again
its
stiff
wheels
and
their
trunks
swayed
*NL*
gently
.
Martin
Cunningham
twirled
more
quickly
the
peak
of
his
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tom
Kernan
was
immense
last
night
,
he
said
.
And
Paddy
Leonard
taking
*NL*
him
off
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
draw
him
out
,
Martin
,
Mr
Power
said
eagerly
.
Wait
till
you
hear
*NL*
him
,
Simon
,
on
Ben
Dollard
's
singing
of
_
The
Croppy
Boy
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Immense
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
pompously
.
_
His
singing
of
that
simple
*NL*
ballad
,
Martin
,
is
the
most
trenchant
rendering
I
ever
heard
in
the
*NL*
whole
course
of
my
experience
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
--
Trenchant
,
Mr
Power
said
laughing
.
He
's
dead
nuts
on
that
.
And
the
*NL*
retrospective
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
read
Dan
Dawson
's
speech
?
Martin
Cunningham
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
not
then
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
Where
is
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
the

this
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
took
the
paper
from
his
inside
pocket

That

I
must
change
*NL*
for

*NL*
*NL*
--
No

Mr
Dedalus
said
quickly
.
Later
on

*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
's
glance
travelled
down
the
edge
of
the

,
scanning

It

To

up

While

weeps
and
mourns
his

Hoping
some

to
meet
him
*NL*
on

_
*NL*
*NL*
I
tore
up
the
envelope

Yes

Where
did
I
put
her
letter
after
I
read
it
*NL*
in

?
He
patted

There
all

Too

The

An

I
was
passing

The

*NL*
A
pointsman

straightened
itself
upright
suddenly
against
a
*NL*
tramway
standard
by
Mr
Bloom
's
window
.
Could
n't
they
invent
something
*NL*
automatic
so
that
the
wheel
itself
much
handier
?
Well
but
that
fellow
*NL*
would
lose

Well

then

Antient

Nothing

A

Not

there

Quarter

*NL*
They
went

Martin
Cunningham
said
,
raising
his

to
his
brow
in
*NL*
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
does
n't
see

Mr

said

Yes

he
does
.
How
do
you
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
?
Mr

asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Blazes
Boylan
,
Mr
Power
said
.
There
he
is
airing
his
quiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
that
moment
I
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr

bent
across
to

From
the
door
of
the
Red
Bank
the
*NL*
white
disc
of
a
straw
hat
flashed
reply
:
spruce
figure
:
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
reviewed
the
nails
of
his
left
hand
,
then
those
of
his
right
*NL*
hand
.
The
nails
,
yes
.
Is
there
anything
more
in
him
that
they
she
sees
?
*NL*
Fascination
.
Worst
man
in
Dublin
.
That
keeps
him
alive
.
They
sometimes
*NL*
feel
what
a
person
is
.
Instinct
.
But
a
type
like
that
.
My
nails
.
I
*NL*
am
just
looking
at
them
:
well
pared
.
And
after
:
thinking
alone
.
Body
*NL*
getting
a
bit
softy
.
I
would
notice
that
:
from
remembering
.
What
causes
*NL*
that
?
I
suppose
the
skin
ca
n't
contract
quickly
enough
when
the
flesh
*NL*
falls
off
.
But
the
shape
is
there
.
The
shape
is
there
still

Shoulders

*NL*

Plump

Night

He
clasped

between

and
,
satisfied
,
sent
his
vacant
*NL*
glance
over
their

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
How

getting
on

?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
very
well

Mr

said
.
I
hear
great
accounts
of

It
's
a
good
*NL*
idea
,
you
see
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
going
yourself
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
no
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
In
point
of
fact
I
have
to
go
down
to
the
*NL*
county
Clare
on
some
private
business
.
You
see
the
idea
is
to
tour
the
*NL*
chief
towns
.
What
you
lose
on
one
you
can
make
up
on
the
other
.
*NL*

Quite

Last

Mr

unclasped

Who

Not

Yet

told

there

You

Yes

it

Crofton

him
one
evening
bringing
her

a

What
is

Barmaid

Or

They

*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
nudged
Mr

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
blackbearded
figure
,
bent
on
a
stick
,
stumping
round
the
corner
*NL*
of
Elvery
's
Elephant
house
,
showed
them
a
curved
hand
open
on
his
spine
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
all
his
pristine
beauty
,
Mr

said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
looked
after
the
stumping
figure
and
said
mildly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
devil
break
the
hasp
of
your

!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Power
,
collapsing
in
laughter
,
shaded
his
face
from
the
window
as
the
*NL*
carriage
passed
Gray
's
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
have
all
been
there
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
broadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
met
Mr

's
eyes
.
He
caressed
his
beard
,
adding
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
nearly
all
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
began
to
speak
with
sudden
eagerness
to
his
companions
'
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
an
awfully
good
one
that
's
going
the
rounds
about
Reuben
J
and
*NL*
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
About
the
boatman

Mr

asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
Is
n't
it
awfully
good
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
that
?
Mr
Dedalus
asked
.
I
did
n't
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
was
a
girl
in
the
case
,
Mr
Bloom
began
,
and
he
determined
to
*NL*
send
him
to
the
Isle
of
Man
out
of
harm
's
way
but
when
they
were
both
*NL*
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Mr
Dedalus
asked
.
That
confirmed
bloody
hobbledehoy
is
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
They
were
both
on
the
way
to
the
boat
and
he
tried
*NL*
to
drown
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Drown
Barabbas
!
Mr
Dedalus
cried
.
I
wish
to
Christ
he
did
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Power
sent
a
long
laugh
down
his
shaded
nostrils

*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Mr
Bloom
said
,
the
son
himself
...
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
thwarted
his
speech
rudely
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Reuben
and
the
son
were
piking
it
down
the
quay
next
the
river
on
*NL*
their
way
to
the
Isle
of
Man
boat
and
the
young
chiseller
suddenly
got
*NL*
loose
and
over
the
wall
with
him
into
the
Liffey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
God
's
sake
!
Mr
Dedalus
exclaimed
in
fright
.
Is
he
dead
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dead
!
Martin
Cunningham
cried
.
Not
he
!
A
boatman
got
a
pole
and
fished
*NL*
him
out
by
the
slack
of
the
breeches
and
he
was
landed
up
to
the
father
*NL*
on
the
quay
more
dead
than
alive
.
Half
the
town
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
But
the
funny
part
is
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
Reuben
J
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
gave
the
boatman
a
florin
for
*NL*
saving
his
son
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stifled
sigh
came
from
under
Mr
Power
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
he
did
,
Martin
Cunningham
affirmed
.
Like
a
hero
.
A
silver
florin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
n't
it
awfully
good
?
Mr
Bloom
said
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
and
eightpence
too
much
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
drily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Power
's
choked
laugh
burst
quietly
in
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nelson
's
pillar
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Eight
plums
a
penny
!
Eight
for
a
penny
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
had
better
look
a
little
serious
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
then
indeed
,
he
said
,
poor
little
Paddy
would
n't
grudge
us
a
laugh
.
*NL*
Many
a
good
one
he
told
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
Lord
forgive
me
!
Mr
Power
said
,
wiping
his
wet
eyes
with
his
*NL*
fingers
.
Poor
Paddy
!
I
little
thought
a
week
ago
when
I
saw
him
last
and
*NL*
he
was
in
his
usual
health
that
I
'd
be
driving
after
him
like
this
.
He
's
*NL*
gone
from
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
decent
a
little
man
as
ever
wore
a
hat
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
He
went
*NL*
very
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Breakdown

Martin
Cunningham
said
.
Heart

*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
his

sadly

*NL*
*NL*
Blazing

Cure

*NL*

.
A

of
money
he
spent
*NL*
colouring
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Power
gazed
at
the
passing
houses
with
rueful
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
had
a
sudden
death
,
poor
fellow
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
best
death
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
wide
open
eyes
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
suffering
,
he
said
.
A
moment
and
all
is
over
.
Like
dying
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
No-one

Mr

said

It
's
well
out

*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
climbed
more
slowly
the

of
Rutland

.
Rattle
his

Over

Only
a

Nobody

*NL*
*NL*
--
In

midst
of

,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
the
worst
of
all
,
Mr
Power
said
,
is
the
man
who
takes
his
own
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
drew
out
his
watch
briskly
,
coughed
and
put
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
greatest
disgrace
to
have
in
the
family
,
Mr
Power
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Temporary
insanity
,
of
course
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
decisively
.
We
*NL*
must
take
a
charitable
view
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
say
a
man
who
does
it
is
a
coward
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
not
for
us
to
judge
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
,
about
to
speak
,
closed
his
lips
again
.
Martin
Cunningham
's
*NL*
large
eyes
.
Looking
away
now
.
Sympathetic
human
man
he
is
.
Intelligent
.
*NL*
Like

Always
a
good
word
to
say
.
They
have
no
mercy
*NL*
on
that
here
or
infanticide
.
Refuse
christian
burial
.
They
used
to
drive
*NL*
a
stake
of
wood
through
his
heart
in
the
grave
.
As
if
it
was
n't
broken
*NL*
already
.
Yet
sometimes
they
repent
too
late
.
Found
in
the
riverbed
*NL*
clutching
rushes
.
He
looked
at
me
.
And
that
awful
drunkard
of
a

*NL*
of
his
.
Setting
up
house
for
her
time
after

and
then
pawning
the
*NL*
furniture
on

every

almost
.
Leading
him
the

the
*NL*
damned
.
Wear
the

Monday

Lord
,
she
must
have
looked

*NL*
that
night
Dedalus
told
me
he
was
in
there

Drunk
about
the
place
and
*NL*
capering
with
Martin
's
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
And
they
call
me
the

of

*NL*
Of

*NL*
The

_
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
from

He
knows

Rattle
his
bones
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
of
the
inquest
.
The
redlabelled

on

.
The
*NL*

in
the

with

Stuffy
it
was

Sunlight
through

The

big

Boots
giving

Thought
he
was

Then
saw

yellow

on

Had
slipped
down

No

*NL*
The

rattled
swiftly
along
Blessington
street
.
Over
the
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
going
the
pace
,
I
think
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
grant
he
does
n't
upset
us
on
the
road
,
Mr
Power
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
hope
not
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
That
will
be
a
great
race
tomorrow
*NL*
in
Germany
.
The
Gordon
Bennett
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
by

Mr
Dedalus
said

That
will
be
worth
seeing
,
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
turned
into
Berkeley
street
a
streetorgan
near
the
Basin
sent
*NL*
over
and
after
them
a
rollicking
rattling
song
of

Her

Then
the

round

Nice

He

told

From

The
*NL*
carriage
galloped
round
a
corner
:
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
wrong
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
divided
drove
of
branded
cattle
passed
the
windows
,
lowing
,
slouching
*NL*
by
on
padded
hoofs
,
whisking
their
tails
slowly
on
their
clotted
bony
*NL*
croups
.
Outside
them
and
through
them
ran
raddled
sheep
bleating
their
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Emigrants

Mr
Power
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Huuuh

the
drover
's
voice
cried
,
his
switch
sounding
on

*NL*
*NL*
Huuuh

out

Cuffe
sold

about

For

Roastbeef

England
.
They
buy
up
all
the
juicy

And
then
the
fifth
quarter
*NL*
lost
:
all
that
raw
stuff
,
hide

horns
.
Comes
to
a
big
thing
in

year

Dead
meat
trade

Byproducts

Wonder
if
that
dodge
works
now
getting
dicky
meat
off
*NL*
the
train
at
Clonsilla

*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
moved
on
through
the
drove
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
ca
n't
make
out
why
the
corporation
does
n't
run
a
tramline
from
the
*NL*
parkgate
to
the
quays
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
All
those
animals
could
be
taken
*NL*
in
trucks
down
to
the
boats
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Instead
of
blocking
up
the
thoroughfare
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
Quite
*NL*
right
.
They
ought
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Bloom
said
,
and
another
thing
I
often
thought
,
is
to
have
*NL*
municipal
funeral
trams
like
they
have
in
Milan
,
you
know
.
Run
the
line
*NL*
out
to
the
cemetery
gates
and
have
special
trams
,
hearse
and
carriage
*NL*
and
all
.
Do
n't
you
see
what
I
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
that
be
damned
for

Mr
Dedalus
said

Pullman
car

*NL*
*NL*
--
A
poor
lookout
for

,
Mr
Power
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
?
Mr
Bloom
asked
,
turning
to
Mr
Dedalus
.
Would
n't
it
be
more
decent
*NL*
than
galloping
two
abreast
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
there
's
something
in
that
,
Mr
Dedalus
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
we
would
n't
have
scenes
like
that
when
*NL*
the
hearse
capsized
round
Dunphy
's
and
upset
the
coffin
on
to
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
was
terrible
,
Mr
Power
's
shocked
face
said
,
and
the
corpse
fell
*NL*
about
the
road
.
Terrible
!
*NL*
*NL*

First

Mr

Asking
what
's
up
now

*NL*
Quite
right
to
close
it
.
Looks
horrid
open

Then
the
insides
decompose
*NL*
quickly
.
Much
better
to
close
up
all
the

Yes

also

With

*NL*
The

loose

Expect
we
'll
pull
up

here

way
back
to
drink
his
health
.
Pass
round
the
consolation
.
*NL*
Elixir
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suppose
now
it
did
happen
.
Would
he
bleed
if
a
nail
say
cut
him
*NL*
in
the
knocking
about
?
He
would
and
he
would
n't
,
I
suppose
.
Depends
on
*NL*
where
.
The
circulation
stops
.
Still
some
might
ooze
out

It
*NL*
would
be
better
to
bury
them
in
red

a

*NL*
In
silence
they
drove
along

An

On

coastward
over

drawn
by

I
wonder
how
is
our

Fogarty
getting
on
,
Mr

said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Better
ask
Tom
Kernan
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
is
that
?
Martin

said

Left

weeping

I

Though

The

The

Crowded
on

of

silent

appeared

white

sorrowful
,
holding
out
calm

*NL*
knelt
in

On

That

So
it

Mr

A

Murdered

The

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*

Only

Martin
Cunningham
added

That
's
the
maxim
of
the

law
.
Better
for
ninetynine
guilty
to
escape
than
for
one
innocent
person
*NL*
to
be

*NL*
They

put

out

shoved

He
stepped
out

Mr

and
Mr

followed

*NL*
*NL*
Change

Mr

unbuttoned
his

swiftly
*NL*

transferred

Beyond

Corny

stood

out

He
handed

*NL*
*NL*
Where

*NL*
*NL*
A
team
of
horses
passed
from
Finglas
with
toiling
plodding
tread
,
*NL*
dragging
through
the
funereal
silence
a
creaking
waggon
on
which
lay
a

granite
block
.
The
waggoner
marching
at

saluted

*NL*
*NL*
Coffin

Got

on
a

something

Do
they
know
what
they
cart
out
here
*NL*
every

?
Must
be
twenty

thirty
funerals
every

Then
Mount

Funerals
all

Shovelling

*NL*
*NL*
Mourners
came
out
through

:

Leanjawed

*NL*
hard

at

The

shouldered

bore

in

So
*NL*
much
dead

Felt
heavier
myself
stepping
out

First
*NL*
the

:
then
the

.
Corny
Kelleher
and
the
*NL*

followed
with
their

Who
is
that
beside

Ah

the

brother-in-law

*NL*
All

*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
in
mortal
agony
with
you
talking
of
suicide
before
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Mr
Power
whispered
.
How
so
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
His
father
poisoned
himself
,
Martin
Cunningham
whispered
.
Had
the
*NL*
Queen
's
hotel
in
Ennis
.
You
heard
him
say
he
was
going
to
Clare
.
*NL*
Anniversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
God
!
Mr
Power
whispered
.
First
I
heard
of
it
.
Poisoned
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
behind
him
to
where
a
face
with
dark
thinking
eyes
followed
*NL*
towards
the
cardinal
's
mausoleum
.
Speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Was
he
insured
?
Mr
Bloom
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
believe
so
,
Mr
Kernan
answered
.
But
the
policy
was
heavily
*NL*
mortgaged
.
Martin
is
trying
to
get
the
youngster
into
Artane
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
many
children
did
he
leave
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Five
.
Ned
Lambert
says
he
'll
try
to
get
one
of
the
girls
into
Todd
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
sad
case
,
Mr
Bloom
said
gently
.
Five
young
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
great
blow
to
the
poor
wife
,
Mr
Kernan
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Indeed
yes
,
Mr
Bloom
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Has
the
laugh
at
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
down
at
the
boots
he
had
blacked
and
polished
.
She
had
*NL*
outlived
him
.
Lost
her
husband
.
More
dead
for
her
than
for
me
.
One
must
*NL*
outlive
the
other
.
Wise
men
say
.
There
are
more
women
than
men
in

*NL*
world
.
Condole
with
her
.
Your
terrible
loss
.
I
hope
you
'll
soon
follow
*NL*
him
.
For
Hindu
widows
only
.
She
would
marry
another
.
Him
?
No
.
Yet
who
*NL*
knows
after
.
Widowhood
not
the

the
old
queen
died

But
*NL*
in

she
put
a
few
violets
in

.
Vain
in
her
heart
of
*NL*
hearts
.
All
for
a
shadow
.
Consort
not
even
a

Her
son
was
the

substance
.
Something
new
to
hope
for
not
like
the
past
she
wanted
back
,
*NL*
waiting
.
It
never
comes
.
One
must
go
first
:
alone
,
under
the
ground
:
and
*NL*
lie
no
more
in
her
warm
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
are
you
,
Simon
?
Ned
Lambert
said
softly
,
clasping
hands
.
Have
n't
*NL*
seen
you
for
a
month
of
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Never
better
.
How
are
all
in
Cork
's
own
town
?
*NL*
*NL*

I
was
down
there
for
the
Cork
park
races
on
Easter
Monday
,
Ned
Lambert
*NL*
said

Same
old

eightpence

Stopped
with
Dick
Tivy
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
how
is
Dick
,
the
solid
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nothing
between
himself
and
heaven
,
Ned
Lambert
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
the
holy
Paul
!
Mr
Dedalus
said
in
subdued
wonder
.
Dick
Tivy
bald
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Martin
is
going
to
get
up
a
whip
for
the
youngsters
,
Ned
Lambert
said
,
*NL*
pointing
ahead
.
A
few
bob
a
skull
.
Just
to
keep
them
going
till
the
*NL*
insurance
is
cleared
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
dubiously
.
Is
that
the
eldest
boy
in
front
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Ned
Lambert
said
,
with
the
wife
's
brother
.
John
Henry
Menton
is
*NL*
behind
.
He
put
down
his
name
for
a
quid
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
engage
he
did
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
I
often
told
poor
Paddy
he
ought
*NL*
to
mind
that
job
.
John
Henry
is
not
the
worst
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
did
he
lose
it
?
Ned
Lambert
asked
.
Liquor
,
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Many
a
good
man
's
fault
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
about
the
door
of
the
mortuary
chapel
.
Mr
Bloom
stood
behind
*NL*
the
boy
with
the
wreath
looking
down
at
his
sleekcombed
hair
and
at
the
*NL*
slender
furrowed
neck
inside
his
brandnew
collar
.
Poor
boy
!
Was
he
there
*NL*
when
the
father
?
Both
unconscious
.
Lighten
up
at
the
last
moment
*NL*
and
recognise
for
the
last
time
.
All
he
might
have
done
.
I
owe
three
*NL*
shillings
to
O'Grady
.
Would
he
understand
?
The
mutes
bore
the
coffin
*NL*
into
the
chapel
.
Which
end
is
his
head
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
he
followed
the
others
in
,
blinking
in
the
screened
*NL*
light
.
The
coffin
lay
on
its
bier
before
the
chancel
,
four
tall
yellow
*NL*
candles
at
its
corners
.
Always
in

of
us
.
Corny
Kelleher
,
laying
a
*NL*
wreath
at
each
fore
corner
,
beckoned
to
the
boy
to
kneel
.
The
mourners
*NL*
knelt
here
and
there
in
prayingdesks
.
Mr
Bloom
stood
behind
near
the
*NL*
font
and
,
when
all
had
knelt
,
dropped
carefully
his
unfolded
newspaper
*NL*
from
his
pocket
and
knelt
his
right
knee
upon
it
.
He
fitted
his
black
*NL*
hat
gently
on
his
left
knee
and
,
holding
its
brim
,
bent
over
piously
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
server
bearing
a
brass
bucket
with
something
in
it
came
out
through

door

The

came
after
him
,
tidying
his
stole
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
balancing
with
the
other
a
little
book
against
his
toad

belly

*NL*
Who
'll
read
the
book
?
I

said
the
rook
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
by
the
bier
and
the
priest
began
to
read
out
of
his
book
*NL*
with
a
fluent
croak

The

took
a

with
a
knob
at
the
end
of
it
out
of
the
boy
's
*NL*
bucket
and
shook
it
over

Then
he
walked
to
the
other

and
*NL*
shook
it
again
.
Then
he
came
back
and
put
it
back
in
the
bucket
.
As
you

were

It

that
job
,
shaking
that
thing
over
all
the
corpses
they
trot
up
.
*NL*
What
harm
if
he
could
see
what
he
was
shaking
it
over
.
Every
mortal
*NL*
day
a
fresh
batch
:
middleaged
men
,
old
women
,
children
,
women
dead
in
*NL*
childbirth
,
men
with
beards
,
baldheaded
businessmen
,
consumptive
girls
*NL*
with
little
sparrows
'
breasts
.
All
the
year
round
he
prayed
the
same
*NL*
thing
over
them
all
and
shook
water
on
top
of
them
:
sleep
.
On
Dignam
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
In
paradisum

*NL*
*NL*
Said
he
was
going
to
paradise
or
is
in
paradise
.
Says
that
over
*NL*
everybody
.
Tiresome
kind
of
a
job
.
But
he
has
to
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
closed
his
book
and
went
off
,
followed
by
the
server
.
Corny
*NL*
Kelleher
opened
the
sidedoors
and
the
gravediggers
came
in
,
hoisted
the
*NL*
coffin
again
,
carried
it
out
and
shoved
it
on
their
cart
.
Corny
Kelleher
*NL*
gave
one
wreath
to
the
boy
and
one
to
the
brother-in-law
.
All
followed
*NL*
them
out
of
the
sidedoors
into
the
mild
grey
air
.
Mr
Bloom
came
last
*NL*
folding
his
paper
again
into
his
pocket
.
He
gazed
gravely
at
the
ground
*NL*
till
the
coffincart
wheeled
off
to
the
left
.
The
metal
wheels
ground
the
*NL*
gravel
with
a
sharp
grating
cry
and
the
pack
of
blunt
boots
followed
the
*NL*
trundled
barrow
along
a
lane
of
sepulchres
.
*NL*
*NL*
The

I
must

lilt

*NL*
*NL*
--
The
O'Connell
circle
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Power
's
soft
eyes
went
up
to
the
apex
of
the
lofty
cone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
at
rest
,
he
said
,
in
the
middle
of
his
people
,
old
Dan
O
'
.
But
*NL*
his
heart
is
buried
in
Rome
.
How
many
broken
hearts
are
buried
here
,
*NL*
Simon
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Her
grave
is
over
there
,
Jack
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
I
'll
soon
be
stretched
*NL*
beside
her
.
Let
Him
take
me
whenever
He
likes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breaking
down
,
he
began
to
weep
to
himself
quietly
,
stumbling
a
little
*NL*
in
his
walk
.
Mr
Power
took
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
's
better
where
she
is
,
he
said
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
suppose
so
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
with
a
weak
gasp
.
I
suppose
she
is
in
*NL*
heaven
if
there
is
a
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corny
Kelleher
stepped
aside
from
his
rank
and
allowed
the
mourners
to
*NL*
plod
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sad
occasions
,
Mr
Kernan
began
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
closed
his
eyes
and
sadly
twice
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
others
are
putting
on
their
hats
,
Mr
Kernan
said
.
I
suppose
we
can
*NL*
do
so
too
.
We
are
the
last
.
This
cemetery
is
a
treacherous
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
covered
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
reverend
gentleman
read
the
service
too
quickly
,
do
n't
you
think
?
*NL*
Mr
Kernan
said
with
reproof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
nodded
gravely
looking
in
the
quick
bloodshot
eyes
.
Secret
*NL*
eyes
,
secretsearching
.
Mason
,
I
think
:
not
sure
.
Beside
him
again
.
We
*NL*
are
the
last
.
In
the
same
boat
.
Hope
he
'll
say
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Kernan
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
service
of
the
Irish
church
used
in
Mount
Jerome
is
simpler
,
more
*NL*
impressive
I
must
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
gave
prudent
assent
.
The
language
of
course
was
another
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Kernan
said
with
solemnity
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
_
.
That
touches
a
man
's
inmost
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
does
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
heart
perhaps
but
what
price
the
fellow
in
the
six
feet
by
two
*NL*
with
his
toes
to
the
daisies
?
No
touching
that
.
Seat
of
the
affections
.
*NL*
Broken
heart
.
A
pump
after
all
,
pumping
thousands
of
gallons
of
blood
*NL*
every
day
.
One
fine
day
it
gets
bunged
up
:
and
there
you
are
.
Lots
of
*NL*
them
lying
around
here
:
lungs
,
hearts
,
livers
.
Old
rusty
pumps
:
damn
*NL*
the
thing
else
.
The
resurrection
and
the
life
.
Once
you
are
dead
you
are
*NL*
dead
.
That
last
day
idea
.
Knocking
them
all
up
out
of
their
graves
.
Come
*NL*
forth
,
Lazarus
!
And
he
came
fifth
and
lost
the
job
.
Get
up

Last
day
!
*NL*
Then
every
fellow
mousing
around
for
his
liver
and
his

and
the
*NL*
rest

Find

Corny
Kelleher
fell
into
step
at
their
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Everything
went
off
A1
,
he
said
.
What
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
on
them
from
his
drawling
eye
.
Policeman
's
shoulders
.
With
*NL*
your
tooraloom
tooraloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
it
should
be
,
Mr
Kernan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
Eh
?
Corny
Kelleher
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Kernan
assured
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
that
chap
behind
with
Tom
Kernan
?
John
Henry
Menton
asked
.
I
*NL*
know
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Lambert
glanced
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bloom
,
he
said
,
Madame
Marion
Tweedy
that
was
,
is
,
I
mean
,
the
*NL*
soprano
.
She
's
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
to
be
sure
,
John
Henry
Menton
said
.
I
have
n't
seen
her
for
some
*NL*
time
.
He
was
a
finelooking
woman
.
I
danced
with
her
,
wait
,
fifteen
*NL*
seventeen
golden
years
ago
,
at
Mat
Dillon
's
in
Roundtown
.
And
a
good
*NL*
armful
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
behind
through
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
he
?
he
asked
.
What
does
he
do
?
Was
n't
he
in
the
stationery
*NL*
line
?
I
fell
foul
of
him
one
evening
,
I
remember
,
at
bowls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Lambert
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
he
was
,
he
said
,
in
Wisdom
Hely
's
.
A
traveller
for
blottingpaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
God
's
name
,
John
Henry
Menton
said
,
what
did
she
marry
a
coon
like
*NL*
that
for
?
She
had
plenty
of
game
in
her
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Has
still
,
Ned
Lambert
said
.
He
does
some
canvassing
for
ads
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Henry
Menton
's
large
eyes
stared
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barrow
turned
into
a
side
lane
.
A
portly
man
,
ambushed
among
the
*NL*
grasses
,
raised
his
hat
in
homage
.
The
gravediggers
touched
their
caps
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
John
O'Connell
,
Mr
Power
said
pleased
.
He
never
forgets
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
O'Connell
shook
all
their
hands
in
silence
.
Mr
Dedalus
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
come
to
pay
you
another
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
dear
Simon
,
the
caretaker
answered
in
a
low
voice
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
your
custom
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saluting
Ned
Lambert
and
John
Henry
Menton
he
walked
on
at
Martin
*NL*
Cunningham
's
side
puzzling
two
long
keys
at
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
hear
that
one
,
he
asked
them
,
about
Mulcahy
from
the
Coombe
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
did
not
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
bent
their
silk
hats
in
concert
and
Hynes
inclined
his
ear
.
The
*NL*
caretaker
hung
his
thumbs
in
the
loops
of
his
gold
watchchain
and
spoke
*NL*
in
a
discreet
tone
to
their
vacant
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
tell
the
story
,
he
said
,
that
two
drunks
came
out
here
one
foggy
*NL*
evening
to
look
for
the
grave
of
a
friend
of
theirs
.
They
asked
for
*NL*
Mulcahy
from
the
Coombe
and
were
told
where
he
was
buried
.
After
*NL*
traipsing
about
in
the
fog
they
found
the
grave
sure
enough
.
One
of
the
*NL*
drunks
spelt
out
the
name
:
Terence
Mulcahy
.
The
other
drunk
was
blinking
*NL*
up
at
a
statue
of
Our
Saviour
the
widow
had
got
put
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
caretaker
blinked
up
at
one
of
the
sepulchres
they
passed
.
He
*NL*
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
,
after
blinking
up
at
the
sacred
figure
,
_
Not
a
bloody
bit
like
*NL*
the
man
_
,
says
he
.
_
That
's
not
Mulcahy
_
,
says
he
,
_
whoever
done
it
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rewarded
by
smiles
he
fell
back
and
spoke
with
Corny
Kelleher
,
accepting
*NL*
the
dockets
given
him
,
turning
them
over
and
scanning
them
as
he
walked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
all
done
with
a
purpose
,
Martin
Cunningham
explained
to
Hynes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
,
Hynes
said
.
I
know
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
cheer
a
fellow
up
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
It
's
pure
*NL*
goodheartedness
:
damn
the
thing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
admired
the
caretaker
's
prosperous
bulk
.
All
want
to
be
on
good
*NL*
terms
with
him
.
Decent
fellow
,
John
O'Connell
,
real
good
sort
.
Keys
:
*NL*
like
Keyes
's
ad
:
no
fear
of
anyone
getting
out
.
No
passout
checks
.
*NL*
_
Habeas
corpus
_
.
I
must
see
about
that
ad
after
the
funeral
.
Did
I
*NL*
write
Ballsbridge
on
the
envelope
I
took
to
cover
when
she
disturbed
me
*NL*
writing
to
Martha
?
Hope
it
's
not
chucked
in
the
dead
letter
office
.
Be
*NL*
the
better
of
a
shave
.
Grey
sprouting
beard
.
That
's
the
first
sign
when
*NL*
the
hairs
come
out
grey
.
And
temper
getting
cross
.
Silver
threads
among
*NL*
the
grey
.
Fancy
being
his
wife
.
Wonder
he
had
the
gumption
to
propose
to
*NL*
any
girl
.
Come
out
and
live
in
the
graveyard
.
Dangle
that
before
her
.
It
*NL*
might
thrill
her
first
.
Courting
death
...
Shades
of
night
hovering
*NL*
here
with
all
the
dead
stretched
about
.
The
shadows
of
the
tombs
when
*NL*
churchyards
yawn
and
Daniel
O'Connell
must
be
a
descendant
I
suppose
*NL*
who
is
this
used
to
say
he
was
a
queer
breedy
man
great
catholic
all
the
*NL*
same
like
a
big
giant
in
the
dark
.
Will
o
'
the
wisp
.
Gas
of
graves
.
*NL*
Want
to
keep
her
mind
off
it
to
conceive
at
all
.
Women
especially
are
so
*NL*
touchy
.
Tell
her
a
ghost
story
in
bed
to
make
her
sleep
.
Have
you
ever
*NL*
seen
a
ghost
?
Well
,
I
have
.
It
was
a
pitchdark
night
.
The
clock
was
on
*NL*
the
stroke
of
twelve
.
Still
they
'd
kiss
all
right
if
properly
keyed
up
.
*NL*
Whores
in
Turkish
graveyards
.
Learn
anything
if
taken
young
.
You
might
*NL*
pick
up
a
young
widow
here
.
Men
like
that
.
Love
among
the
tombstones
.
*NL*
Romeo
.
Spice
of
pleasure
.
In
the
midst
of
death
we
are
in
life
.
Both
*NL*
ends
meet
.
Tantalising
for
the
poor
dead
.
Smell
of
grilled
beefsteaks
to
*NL*
the
starving
.
Gnawing
their
vitals
.
Desire
to
grig
people
.
Molly
wanting
*NL*
to
do
it
at
the
window
.
Eight
children
he
has
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
seen
a
fair
share
go
under
in
his
time
,
lying
around
him
field
*NL*
after
field
.
Holy
fields
.
More
room
if
they
buried
them
standing
.
*NL*
Sitting
or
kneeling
you
could
n't
.
Standing
?
His
head
might
come
up
some
*NL*
day
above
ground
in
a
landslip
with
his
hand
pointing
.
All
honeycombed
*NL*
the
ground
must
be
:
oblong
cells
.
And
very
neat
he
keeps
it
too
:
trim
*NL*
grass
and
edgings
.
His
garden
Major
Gamble
calls
Mount
Jerome
.
Well
,
*NL*
so
it
is
.
Ought
to
be
flowers
of
sleep
.
Chinese
cemeteries
with
giant
*NL*
poppies
growing
produce
the
best
opium
Mastiansky
told
me
.
The
Botanic
*NL*
Gardens
are
just
over
there
.
It
's
the
blood
sinking
in
the
earth
gives
*NL*
new
life
.
Same
idea
those
jews
they
said
killed
the
christian
boy
.
Every
*NL*
man
his
price
.
Well
preserved
fat
corpse
,
gentleman
,
epicure
,
invaluable
*NL*
for
fruit
garden

A
bargain
.
By
carcass
of
William
Wilkinson
,
auditor
*NL*
and
accountant
,
lately
deceased
,
three
pounds
thirteen
and
six

With
*NL*
thanks

*NL*
*NL*
I
daresay
the

would
be
quite
fat
with
corpsemanure
,
bones
,
flesh
,
*NL*
nails
.
Charnelhouses
.
Dreadful
.
Turning
green
and
pink
decomposing
.
Rot
*NL*
quick
in
damp
earth
.
The
lean
old
ones
tougher
.
Then
a
kind
of
a
tallowy
*NL*
kind
of
a
cheesy
.
Then
begin
to
get
black
,
black
treacle
oozing
out
of
*NL*
them
.
Then
dried
up
.
Deathmoths
.
Of
course
the
cells
or
whatever
they
*NL*
are
go
on
living
.
Changing
about
.
Live
for
ever
practically
.
Nothing

*NL*
feed
on
feed
on
themselves

*NL*
*NL*
But
they
must
breed
a
devil

a

maggots

Soil
must
be
simply
*NL*
swirling
with
them
.
Your
head
it
simply
swurls

Those
pretty
little
*NL*
seaside
gurls
.
He
looks
cheerful
enough
over
it
.
Gives
him
a
sense
of
*NL*
power
seeing
all
the
others
go
under
first
.
Wonder
how
he
looks
at
life
.
*NL*
Cracking
his
jokes
too
:
warms
the
cockles
of
his
heart

's
in
*NL*
fashion

A
juicy
pear
or
ladies
'
punch
,
hot
,
strong
and
sweet
.
Keep
*NL*
out
the
damp
.
You
must
laugh
sometimes
so
better
do
it
that
way
.
*NL*
Gravediggers
in
_
Hamlet
_
.
Shows
the
profound
knowledge
of
the
human
*NL*
heart
.
Dare
n't
joke
about
the
dead
for
two
years
at
least
.
_
De
mortuis
*NL*
nil

.
Go
out
of
mourning
first
.
Hard
to
imagine
his
funeral
.
*NL*
Seems
a
sort
of
a
joke
.
Read
your
own
obituary
notice
they
say
you
live
*NL*
longer
.
Gives
you
second
wind
.
New
lease
of
life

*NL*
*NL*
--
How
many
have-you
for
tomorrow
?
the
caretaker
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Two
,
Corny
Kelleher
said
.
Half
ten
and
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
caretaker
put
the
papers
in
his
pocket
.
The
barrow
had
ceased
to
*NL*
trundle
.
The
mourners
split
and
moved
to
each
side
of
the
hole
,
stepping
*NL*
with
care
round
the
graves
.
The
gravediggers
bore
the
coffin
and
set
its
*NL*
nose
on
the
brink
,
looping
the
bands
round
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burying
him
.
We
come
to
bury
Caesar
.
His
ides
of
March
or
June
.
He
*NL*
does
n't
know
who
is
here
nor
care
.
Now
who
is
that
lankylooking
galoot
*NL*
over
there
in
the
macintosh
?
Now
who
is
he
I
'd
like
to
know
?
Now
I
'd
*NL*
give
a
trifle
to
know
who
he
is
.
Always
someone
turns
up
you
never
*NL*
dreamt
of
.
A
fellow
could
live
on
his
lonesome
all
his
life
.
Yes
,
he
*NL*
could
.
Still
he
'd
have
to
get
someone
to
sod
him
after
he
died
though
he
*NL*
could
dig
his
own
grave
.
We
all
do
.
Only
man
buries
.
No
,
ants
too
.
First
*NL*
thing
strikes
anybody
.
Bury
the
dead
.
Say
Robinson
Crusoe
was
true
to
*NL*
life
.
Well
then
Friday
buried
him
.
Every
Friday
buries
a
Thursday
if
you
*NL*
come
to
look
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
O
,
poor
Robinson
Crusoe
!
*NL*
How
could
you
possibly
do
so
?
_
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dignam
!
His
last
lie
on
the
earth
in
his
box
.
When
you
think
of
*NL*
them
all
it
does
seem
a
waste
of
wood
.
All
gnawed
through
.
They
could
*NL*
invent
a
handsome
bier
with
a
kind
of
panel
sliding
,
let
it
down
that
*NL*
way
.
Ay
but
they
might
object
to
be
buried
out
of
another
fellow
's
.
*NL*
They
're
so
particular
.
Lay
me
in
my
native
earth
.
Bit
of
clay
from
*NL*
the
holy
land
.
Only
a
mother
and
deadborn
child
ever
buried
in
the
one
*NL*
coffin
.
I
see
what
it
means
.
I
see
.
To
protect
him
as
long
as
possible
*NL*
even
in
the
earth
.
The
Irishman
's
house
is
his
coffin

Embalming
in

catacombs

mummies
the
same
idea

*NL*
Mr
Bloom
stood
far
back

his
hat
in

,
counting
the
bared
heads

*NL*
Twelve

I
'm
thirteen

No

The

in
the
macintosh
is

Death

number

Where
the
deuce
did
he
pop
out
of
?
He
was
n't
in
the
chapel
,
that
*NL*
I
'll
swear

Silly
superstition
that
about
thirteen

*NL*
*NL*
Nice
soft

Ned
Lambert
has
in

Tinge
of

I
had
*NL*
one
like
that
when
we
lived
in
Lombard
street
west
.
Dressy
fellow
he
was
*NL*
once
.
Used
to
change
three
suits
in
the
day

Must
get
that
grey
suit
*NL*
of
mine
turned
by
Mesias
.
Hello
.
It
's
dyed
.
His
wife
I
forgot
he
's
not
*NL*
married
or
his
landlady
ought
to
have
picked
out
those
threads
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffin
dived
out
of
sight
,
eased
down
by
the
men
straddled
on
the
*NL*
gravetrestles
.
They
struggled
up
and
out
:
and
all
uncovered
.
Twenty

*NL*
*NL*
Pause

*NL*
*NL*
If
we
were
all
suddenly
somebody
else

*NL*
*NL*
Far
away
a
donkey
brayed

Rain

No
such
ass
.
Never
see
a
dead
one
,
they
*NL*
say
.
Shame
of
death
.
They
hide
.
Also
poor
papa
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentle
sweet
air
blew
round
the
bared
heads
in
a
whisper
.
Whisper
.
The
*NL*
boy
by
the
gravehead
held
his
wreath
with
both
hands
staring
quietly
in
*NL*
the
black
open
space
.
Mr
Bloom
moved
behind
the
portly
kindly
caretaker
.
*NL*
Wellcut
frockcoat
.
Weighing
them
up
perhaps
to
see
which
will
go
next
.
*NL*
Well
,
it
is
a
long
rest
.
Feel
no
more

It
's
the
moment
you
feel

Must
be
*NL*
damned
unpleasant

Ca
n't
believe
it
at

Mistake
must
be
:
someone
*NL*
else

Try
the

Wait

I
wanted

I
have

Then

Light
they
want

Whispering
around

Would
you

like
to
see
a

Then
rambling
and
wandering
.
Delirium
all
you
hid
*NL*
all
your
life
.
The
death
struggle
.
His
sleep
is
not
natural

Press
his
*NL*
lower
eyelid
.
Watching
is
his
nose
pointed
is
his
jaw
sinking
are
the
*NL*
soles
of
his

yellow

Pull
the
pillow
away

finish
it
off

Devil

Bam

He
expires

Gone
at

People
*NL*
talk
about
you
a
bit
:
forget
you

Do
n't
forget
to
pray
for
him
.
Remember
*NL*
him
in
your
prayers

Even
Parnell

Ivy

dying
out
.
Then
they
follow
:
*NL*
dropping
into
a
hole
,
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
praying
now
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
.
Hoping
you
're
well
and
*NL*
not
in
hell
.
Nice
change
of
air
.
Out
of
the
fryingpan
of
life
into
the
*NL*
fire
of
purgatory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
he
ever
think
of
the
hole
waiting
for
himself
?
They
say
you
do
when
*NL*
you
shiver
in
the
sun

Someone

*NL*
The
gravediggers
took
up
their
spades
and
flung
heavy
clods
of
clay
in
*NL*
on
the
coffin
.
Mr
Bloom
turned
away
his
face
.
And
if
he
was
alive
all
*NL*
the
time
?
Whew
!
By
jingo
,
that
would
be
awful
!
No
,
no
:
he
is
dead
,
of
*NL*
course
.
Of
course
he
is
dead
.
Monday
he
died
.
They
ought
to
have
*NL*
some
law
to
pierce
the
heart
and
make
sure
or
an
electric
clock
or
*NL*
a
telephone
in
the
coffin
and
some
kind
of
a
canvas
airhole

Flag
of

distress

Three
days

Rather
long
to
keep
them
in

Just
as
well
*NL*
to
get
shut
of
them
as
soon
as
you
are
sure
there
's
no

*NL*
*NL*
The
clay
fell
softer

Begin
to
be
forgotten
.
Out
of

,
out
of
mind

*NL*
*NL*
The
caretaker
moved
away
a
few
paces
and
put
on
his
hat
.
Had
enough
of
*NL*
it
.
The
mourners
took
heart
of
grace
,
one
by
one
,
covering
themselves
*NL*
without
show
.
Mr
Bloom
put
on
his
hat
and
saw
the
portly
figure
make
its
*NL*
way
deftly
through
the
maze
of
graves
.
Quietly
,
sure
of
his
ground
,
he
*NL*
traversed
the
dismal
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hynes
jotting
down
something
in
his
notebook

Ah
,
the
names

But
he
*NL*
knows
them
all

No
:
coming
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
just
taking
the
names
,
Hynes
said
below
his
breath
.
What
is
your
*NL*
christian
name
?
I
'm
not
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
L
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
Leopold
.
And
you
might
put
down
M'Coy
's
name
too
.
He
*NL*
asked
me
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Charley
,
Hynes
said
writing
.
I
know
.
He
was
on
the
_
Freeman
_
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
was
before
he
got
the
job
in
the
morgue
under
Louis
Byrne
.
Good
*NL*
idea
a
postmortem
for
doctors
.
Find
out
what
they
imagine
they
know
.
*NL*
He
died
of
a
Tuesday
.
Got
the
run
.
Levanted
with
the
cash
of
a
few
ads
.
*NL*
Charley
,
you
're
my
darling
.
That
was
why
he
asked
me
to
.
O
well
,
does
*NL*
no
harm
.
I
saw
to
that
,
M'Coy
.
Thanks
,
old
chap
:
much
obliged
.
Leave
him
*NL*
under
an
obligation
:
costs
nothing

*NL*
*NL*

And
tell
us

Hynes
said
,
do
you
know
that
fellow
in

fellow
was
*NL*
over
there
in

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
around

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

I
saw
him

Mr
Bloom
said

Where
is
he
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
M'Intosh
,
Hynes
said
scribbling
.
I
do
n't
know
who
he
is
.
Is
that
his
*NL*
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
away
,
looking
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Mr
Bloom
began
,
turning
and
stopping
.
I
say
,
Hynes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Did
n't
hear
.
What
?
Where
has
he
disappeared
to
?
Not
a
sign
.
Well
of
all
*NL*
the
.
Has
anybody
here
seen

Kay
ee

Become

Good
*NL*
Lord
,
what
became
of
him

*NL*
*NL*
A
seventh
gravedigger
came
beside
Mr
Bloom
to
take
up
an
idle
spade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
excuse
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
aside
nimbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clay
,
brown
,
damp
,
began
to
be
seen
in
the
hole
.
It
rose
.
Nearly
over
.
*NL*
A
mound
of
damp
clods
rose
more
,
rose
,
and
the
gravediggers
rested
their
*NL*
spades
.
All
uncovered
again
for
a
few
instants
.
The
boy
propped
*NL*
his
wreath
against
a
corner
:
the
brother-in-law
his
on
a
lump
.
The
*NL*
gravediggers
put
on
their
caps
and
carried
their
earthy
spades
towards
*NL*
the
barrow
.
Then
knocked
the
blades
lightly
on
the
turf
:
clean
.
One
bent
*NL*
to
pluck
from
the
haft
a
long
tuft
of
grass
.
One
,
leaving
his
mates
,
*NL*
walked
slowly
on
with
shouldered
weapon
,
its
blade
blueglancing

Silently
at
the
gravehead
another
coiled
the
coffinband

His
navelcord
.
*NL*
The
brother-in-law
,
turning
away
,
placed
something
in
his
free
hand
.
*NL*
Thanks
in
silence
.
Sorry
,
sir
:
trouble

Headshake

I
know
that

For
*NL*
yourselves
just

*NL*
The
mourners
moved
away
slowly
without
aim
,
by
devious
paths
,
staying
at
*NL*
whiles
to
read
a
name
on
a
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
go
round
by
the
chief
's
grave

Hynes
said

We
have
time

*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
us
,
Mr
Power
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
to
the
right
,
following
their
slow
thoughts
.
With
awe
Mr
*NL*
Power
's
blank
voice
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Some
say
he
is
not
in
that
grave
at
all
.
That
the
coffin
was
filled
*NL*
with
stones
.
That
one
day
he
will
come
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hynes
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Parnell
will
never
come
again
,
he
said
.
He
's
there
,
all
that
was
*NL*
mortal
of
him
.
Peace
to
his
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
walked
unheeded
along
his
grove
by
saddened
angels
,
crosses
,
*NL*
broken
pillars
,
family
vaults
,
stone
hopes
praying
with
upcast
eyes
,
*NL*
old
Ireland
's
hearts
and
hands
.
More
sensible
to
spend
the
money
on
some
*NL*
charity
for
the
living
.
Pray
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of

Does
anybody
*NL*
really
?
Plant
him
and
have
done
with
him
.
Like
down
a
coalshoot

Then
*NL*
lump
them
together
to
save
time
.
All
souls

Twentyseventh
I
'll
be
*NL*
at

Ten

As

Got

Who
kicked

More

they
told
you
what
they
were

So

So

*NL*
wheelwright

I
travelled
for
cork

I
paid
five

pound

I
cooked

Eulogy

Better

The

Heart
on

Ought

Ireland
was

dedicated

or
whatever
that

Seems
anything

pleased

Why
this

?
Would
birds
come
then

peck
like
the

the

but
he
said
no
because
they

Have

*NL*
And
even
scraping

I
read

There

No

The

,
without
answering
,
scribbled
press
on
a
corner
of
the
sheet
*NL*
and
made
a
sign
to
a
typesetter
.
He
handed
the
sheet
silently
over
the

dirty

screen
.
*NL*
*NL*

Hynes

Mr

*NL*

If

pointing
backward

*NL*
*NL*

Did
you

Hynes
asked

*NL*
*NL*

Mr

said

Look

Thanks

Hynes
said

Mr

laid
his
cutting
on
Mr

desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Excuse

said

This

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

considered
the
cutting
awhile
and
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
wants
it
in
for
July
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
foreman
moved
his
pencil
towards
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
wait
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
He
wants
it
changed
.
Keyes
,
you

He
wants
*NL*
two

at

*NL*
*NL*
Hell

He

Maybe

.
*NL*
*NL*
The
foreman
turned
round
to
hear
patiently
and
,
lifting
an
elbow
,
began
*NL*
to
scratch
slowly
in
the
armpit
of
his
alpaca
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Like
that
,
Mr
Bloom
said
,
crossing
his
forefingers
at
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
take
that
in
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
,
glancing
sideways
up
from
the
cross
he
had
made
,
saw
the
*NL*
foreman

sallow
face
,
think
he
has
a

*NL*
*NL*
Slipping
his

deftly
into
the

of
the

he
drew
*NL*
swiftly
on

Then
round

*NL*
in

the

You
see

Do
you
think
that
's
a
good
idea
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
foreman
moved
his
scratching
hand
to
his
lower
ribs
and
scratched
*NL*
there
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
idea
,
Mr

said
,
is
the

*NL*
*NL*
I
could
ask
him
perhaps
about
how
to
pronounce
that
_

_
But
then
*NL*
if
he
did
n't
know
only
make
it
awkward
for
him
.
Better
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
can
do
that
,
the
foreman
said
.
Have
you
the
design
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
can
get
it
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
It
was
in
a
Kilkenny
paper
.
He
has
a
*NL*
house
there
too
.
I
'll
just
run
out
and
ask
him
.
Well

you
can
do

The

he
said

*NL*
A

brought
him
a
limp

He
began
to
check
it
*NL*
silently
.
Mr

stood
by

watching

J.

asked

looking
towards

*NL*
*NL*
--
Very

professor
MacHugh
said

*NL*
J.
J.
O'Molloy
strolled
to
the

and
began
to
turn
back
the

pink
pages
of

*NL*
*NL*
Practice

Their

Funny
the

Hot

Would

One

Go

taking
anything

forgot

That
mantles
the

far

wide
and
wait
till
the

O

Mr

cried

giving

Shite

That

Ned

He
took
off

blowing
out
impatiently
his

moustache
,
welshcombed
his

with

*NL*
Ned
Lambert
tossed
the

aside

chuckling
with
delight

An
*NL*
instant
after
a
hoarse
bark
of

burst
over
professor
MacHugh

*NL*
unshaven
blackspectacled

cried

All

fine

at

He
was

Why

Feathered

The

violently
and
a
scarlet
beaked
face
,
crested
*NL*
by
a
comb
of
feathery

thrust
itself
in

The
bold

stared

about

asked

Ned

sidled
down
from

roved

towards

shadowed

asked
with

at

shouted

He
took
a

of

from

,
breaking

off

twanged
it
smartly

tossed

Screams

Professor
MacHugh
strode
across
the
room
and
seized
the
cringing
urchin
*NL*
by
the
collar
as
the
others
scampered
out
of
the
hall
and
down
the
*NL*
steps

The
tissues
rustled
up
in
the
draught
,
floated
softly
in

blue
scrawls
and
under
the
table
came
to

Lenehan
began
to
paw
the

up
from

floor

grunting
as
he
*NL*
stooped
twice

pointed

The

whirred
again
as

rang
off

He
came
in
quickly
and
bumped
*NL*
against
Lenehan
who
was
struggling
up
with
the
second
tissue
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Pardon

Lenehan
said
,
clutching
him
for
an

and
*NL*
making
a
grimace
.

made

whined

rubbing
his

He
went
to

door
and
,
holding
it
ajar
,
paused
.
J.
J.
O'Molloy
slapped
*NL*
the
heavy
pages
over

The
noise
of
two
shrill
voices
,
a
mouthorgan
,
*NL*
echoed
in
the
bare
hallway
from
the
newsboys
squatted
on
the
doorsteps

They
tell

He
looked
indecisively
for
a

at
their

The
editor
who
,
*NL*
leaning
against
the
mantelshelf
,
had
propped
his
head
on
his
hand
,
*NL*
suddenly
stretched
forth
an
arm
amply
.

Begone

said

The

hurrying
out

J.
J.
O'Molloy
took
the
tissues
from
Lenehan

hand
and
read
them

*NL*
blowing
them
apart
gently
,
without
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
'll
get
that
advertisement

the
professor
said
,
staring
through
his
*NL*
blackrimmed
spectacles
over
the
crossblind
.
Look
at
the
young
scamps
*NL*
after
him
.
*NL*

Lenehan
cried
,
running
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
A

CORTEGE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Both
smiled
over
the
crossblind
at
the
file
of
capering
newsboys
in
Mr
*NL*
Bloom
's
wake
,
the
last
zigzagging
white
on
the
breeze
a
mocking
kite
,
a
*NL*
tail
of
white
bowknots
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
at
the
young
guttersnipe
behind
him
hue
and
cry

Lenehan
said
,
*NL*
and
you
'll
kick

O

my

risible

Taking
off
his
flat
spaugs
and
the
*NL*
walk
.
Small
nines

Steal
upon

*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
mazurka
in
swift
caricature
across
the
floor
on
sliding
*NL*
feet
past
the
fireplace
to
J.
J.
O'Molloy
who
placed
the
tissues
in
his
*NL*
receiving
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
that

Myles
Crawford
said
with
a
start
.
Where
are
the
other
two
*NL*
gone
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who

the
professor
said
,
turning
.
They
're
gone
round
to
the
Oval
for
a
*NL*
drink
.
Paddy
Hooper

there
with

Came

Come

Myles
Crawford
said
.
Where
's
my

?
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
jerkily
into
the
office
behind
,
parting
the
vent
of
his
*NL*
jacket
,
jingling
his
keys
in
his
back
pocket
.
They
jingled
then
in
the
*NL*
air
and
against
the
wood
as
he
locked
his
desk
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's

well
on

professor
MacHugh
said
in
a
low
voice

Seems

J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
,
taking
out
a
cigarettecase
in
*NL*
murmuring
meditation
,
but
it
is
not
always
as
it
seems
.
Who
has
the
most
*NL*
matches
?
*NL*
*NL*
THE
CALUMET
OF

He
offered
a
cigarette
to
the
professor
and
took
one
himself
.
Lenehan
*NL*
promptly
struck
a
match
for
them
and
lit
their
cigarettes
in
turn
.
J.
J.
*NL*
O'Molloy
opened
his
case
again
and
offered
it

*NL*
*NL*
--

Thanky

Lenehan
said
,
helping
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
editor
came
from
the
inner
office
,
a
straw
hat
awry
on
his
brow
.
He
*NL*
declaimed
in
song
,
pointing
sternly
at
professor
MacHugh
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
'T

that
tempted
thee

'T

The

grinned
,
locking
his
long
lips

*NL*
*NL*

Eh

He
took
a
cigarette
from

Lenehan
,
lighting
it
for
him
*NL*
with
quick
grace
,
said
:

Silence

_
Imperium

_
,
J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
gently
.
It
sounds
nobler
than
*NL*
British
or
Brixton
.
The
word
reminds
one
somehow
of
fat
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Myles
Crawford
blew
his
first
puff
violently
towards
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
it
,
he
said
.
We
are
the
fat

You
and
I
are

*NL*
We

THE
GRANDEUR
THAT
WAS
ROME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wait
a
moment
,
professor
MacHugh
said
,
raising
two
quiet
claws
.
We
*NL*
must
n't
be
led
away
by
words
,
by
sounds
of
words
.
We
think
of
Rome
,
*NL*
imperial
,
imperious

*NL*
*NL*
He
extended
elocutionary
arms
from
frayed
stained
shirtcuffs
,
pausing
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
was
their
civilisation
?
Vast

I
allow
:

vile

Cloacae

*NL*
The
Jews
in
the
wilderness
and
on
the
mountaintop
said
:
_
It
is
meet
*NL*
to
be
here

Let
us
build
an
altar
to
Jehovah
_
.
The
Roman
,
like
the
*NL*
Englishman
who
follows
in
his
footsteps
,
brought
to
every
new
shore
on
*NL*
which
he
set
his
foot
-LRB-
on
our
shore
he
never
set
it
-RRB-
only
his
cloacal
*NL*
obsession
.
He
gazed
about
him
in
his
toga
and
he
said
:
_
It
is
meet
to
be
*NL*
here
.
Let
us
construct
a
watercloset
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
--
Which
they
accordingly
did
do
,
Lenehan
said
.
Our
old
ancient
*NL*
ancestors
,
as
we
read
in
the
first
chapter
of
Guinness
's
,
were
partial
*NL*
to
the
running

*NL*
*NL*

They
were

J.
J.
O'Molloy
murmured

But
we
have
*NL*
also
Roman
law

J.
J.
O'Molloy
asked

*NL*
It
was

Everything

*NL*
Mr

asked
me
to

*NL*
*NL*
--
O

I

Myles

said
,
and
I
knew
his

The

bloodiest
old

God
ever
made

By
Jesus
,
she
had

The

she
threw

Oho

quietly

*NL*
*NL*

I

NOBLE

MENTIONED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
were
always
loyal
to
lost
causes
,
the
professor
said
.
Success
for
*NL*
us
is
the
death
of
the
intellect
and
of
the
imagination
.
We
were
never
*NL*
loyal
to

We
serve
them

I
teach
the
blatant
Latin
*NL*
language

I
speak

A

brightened
his

lengthened
his

lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The

he
said
again
.
_
Kyrios
!
_
Shining

!
The

*NL*
Semite
and
the
Saxon
know
not

_
Kyrie

_
The

.
*NL*
I
ought

the

.
_
Kyrie

!
_
The
*NL*
closetmaker
and
the
cloacamaker
will
never

We
*NL*
are
liege
subjects
of
the
catholic
chivalry
of
Europe
that
foundered
at
*NL*
Trafalgar
and
of
the
empire

,
not
an

imperium
,
_
that
*NL*
went
under
with
the
Athenian

at
Aegospotami
.
Yes

yes

They
went
*NL*
under

Pyrrhus
,
misled

strode
away
from

*NL*
*NL*
--
They

Mr

Burke
said
greyly
,
but
they

always
fell

*NL*
*NL*

Boohoo

Lenehan
wept
with
a
little
noise

Owing

Lenehan
extended
his

in

But

he
said
.
What

Mr

reriddled

*NL*
*NL*
He
poked
Mr

Burke
mildly
in
the
spleen

Mr
O'Madden
Burke
fell
*NL*
back
with
grace
on
his
umbrella
,
feigning
a

he
sighed

I

*NL*

Lenehan

rising
to

fanned
his

rapidly
with

The

returning

The

J.
J.
O'Molloy
turned
to

said
quietly

slowly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
of
the
most
polished
periods
I
think
I
ever
listened
to
in
my
life
*NL*
fell
from
the
lips
of
Seymour
Bushe
.
It
was
in
that
case
of
fratricide
,
*NL*
the
Childs
murder
case
.
Bushe
defended
him
.

And
in

pour

By

asked

He
spoke
on

said
,
of
Roman
justice
*NL*
as
contrasted
with
the
earlier
Mosaic
code
,

*NL*
Messenger
took
out

thoughtfully
and
lit

*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
thought
since
on
looking
back
over
that
strange
time
that
*NL*
it
was
that
small
act
,
trivial
in
itself
,
that
striking

*NL*
that
determined
the

J.

O'Molloy
resumed

moulding
his
words

He
said
of
it
:
_
that
stony
effigy
in
frozen
music
,
horned
and
*NL*
terrible
,
of
the
human
form
divine
,
that
eternal
symbol
of
wisdom
and
*NL*
of
prophecy
which
,
if
aught
that
the
imagination
or
the
hand
of
sculptor
*NL*
has
wrought
in
marble

A
MAN
OF
HIGH
MORALE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
Professor
Magennis
was
speaking
to
me
about
you
,
J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
*NL*
to
Stephen
.
What
do
you
think
really
of
that
hermetic
crowd
,
the
opal
*NL*
hush
poets
:
A.
E.
the
mastermystic
?
That
Blavatsky
woman
started
it
.
*NL*
She
was
a
nice
old
bag
of
tricks
.
A.
E.
has
been
telling
some
yankee
*NL*
interviewer
that
you
came
to
him
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
to
*NL*
ask
him
about
planes
of
consciousness
.
Magennis
thinks
you
must
have
*NL*
been
pulling
A.
E.
's
leg
.
He
is
a
man
of
the
very
highest
morale
,
*NL*
Magennis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
about
me
.
What
did
he
say
?
What
did
he
say
?
What
did
he
say
*NL*
about
me
?
Do
n't
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
thanks
,
professor
MacHugh
said
,
waving
the
cigarettecase
aside
.
*NL*
Wait
a
moment
.
Let
me
say
one
thing
.
The
finest
display
of
oratory
I
*NL*
ever
heard
was
a
speech
made
by
John
F
Taylor
at
the
college
historical
*NL*
society
.
Mr
Justice
Fitzgibbon
,
the
present
lord
justice
of
appeal
,
had
*NL*
spoken
and
the
paper
under
debate
was
an
essay
-LRB-
new
for
those
days
-RRB-
,
*NL*
advocating
the
revival
of
the
Irish
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
towards
Myles
Crawford
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
know
Gerald
Fitzgibbon
.
Then
you
can
imagine
the
style
of
his
*NL*
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
sitting
with
Tim
Healy
,
J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
,
rumour
has
it
,
on
*NL*
the
Trinity
college
estates
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
sitting
with
a
sweet
thing
,
Myles
Crawford
said
,
in
a
child
's
*NL*
frock
.
Go
on
.
Well
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
was
the
speech
,
mark
you
,
the
professor
said
,
of
a
finished
orator
,
*NL*
full
of
courteous
haughtiness
and
pouring
in
chastened
diction
I
will
*NL*
not
say
the
vials
of
his
wrath
but
pouring
the
proud
man
's
contumely
*NL*
upon
the
new
movement
.
It
was
then
a
new
movement
.
We
were
weak
,
*NL*
therefore
worthless
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
long
thin
lips
an
instant
but
,
eager
to
be
on
,
raised
*NL*
an
outspanned
hand
to
his
spectacles
and
,
with
trembling
thumb
and
*NL*
ringfinger
touching
lightly
the
black
rims
,
steadied
them
to
a
new
*NL*
focus
.
*NL*
*NL*
IMPROMPTU
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
ferial
tone
he
addressed
J.
J.
O'Molloy
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Taylor
had
come
there
,
you
must
know
,
from
a
sickbed
.
That
he
*NL*
had
prepared
his
speech
I
do
not
believe
for
there
was
not
even
one
*NL*
shorthandwriter
in
the
hall
.
His
dark
lean
face
had
a
growth
of
shaggy
*NL*
beard
round
it
.
He
wore
a
loose
white
silk
neckcloth
and
altogether
he
*NL*
looked
-LRB-
though
he
was
not
-RRB-
a
dying
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
gaze
turned
at
once
but
slowly
from
J.
J.
O'Molloy
's
towards
*NL*
Stephen
's
face
and
then
bent
at
once
to
the
ground
,
seeking
.
His
*NL*
unglazed
linen
collar
appeared
behind
his
bent
head
,
soiled
by
his
*NL*
withering
hair
.
Still
seeking
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
Fitzgibbon
's
speech
had
ended
John
F
Taylor
rose
to
reply
.
*NL*
Briefly
,
as
well
as
I
can
bring
them
to
mind
,
his
words
were
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
head
firmly
.
His
eyes
bethought
themselves
once
more
.
*NL*
Witless
shellfish
swam
in
the
gross
lenses
to
and
fro
,
seeking
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Mr
Chairman
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
:
Great
was
my
admiration
in
*NL*
listening
to
the
remarks
addressed
to
the
youth
of
Ireland
a
moment
*NL*
since
by
my
learned
friend
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
had
been
transported
*NL*
into
a
country
far
away
from
this
country
,
into
an
age
remote
from
*NL*
this
age
,
that
I
stood
in
ancient
Egypt
and
that
I
was
listening
to
the
*NL*
speech
of
some
highpriest
of
that
land
addressed
to
the
youthful
Moses
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
His
listeners
held
their
cigarettes
poised
to
hear
,
their
smokes
*NL*
ascending
in
frail
stalks
that
flowered
with
his
speech
.
_
And
let
our
*NL*
crooked
smokes
.
_
Noble
words
coming
.
Look
out
.
Could
you
try
your
hand
*NL*
at
it
yourself
?

And
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
heard
the
voice
of
that
Egyptian
*NL*
highpriest
raised
in
a
tone

haughtiness

like
pride

I
heard

neither

You

we
are

You
*NL*
have
no

our

our
galleys

trireme

laden
with
all

merchandise
*NL*
furrow
the

of
the

You
have

emerged
from

lagging

drew
a
chunk
of
bread
from
under
his

foreboard
,
crammed
it
into
his
mouth
and
munched
as
he
walked

Our
*NL*
staple
food
.
Three
bob
a
day
,
walking
along
the

,
street

Just
keep

*NL*
I
suggested
to
him
about
a
transparent
showcart
with
two
smart
girls
*NL*
sitting
inside
writing
letters
,
copybooks
,
envelopes
,
blottingpaper
.
I
*NL*
bet
that
would
have
caught
on
.
Smart
girls
writing
something
catch
the
*NL*
eye
at
once
.
Everyone
dying
to
know
what
she
's
writing
.
Get
twenty

*NL*
them
round
you
if
you
stare
at
nothing

Have
a

in
the

.
Women
*NL*
too

Curiosity
.
Pillar
of
salt
.
Would
n't
have
it
of
course
because
he
*NL*
did
n't
think
of
it
himself
first
.
Or
the
inkbottle
I
suggested
with
a
*NL*
false
stain
of

Very

of
a

I
disturbed

She

I
think
she
knew
by
the
way
she
.
If
she
had
*NL*
married
she
would
have
changed
.
I
suppose
they
really
were
short
of
*NL*
money
.
Fried
everything

No

Mr

*NL*
His

A
bony

strode
along
the
curbstone
from
the
river
staring
with
a
*NL*
rapt
gaze
into
the
sunlight
through
a
heavystringed
glass
.
Tight
as
a
*NL*
skullpiece
a
tiny
hat
gripped
his
head
.
From
his
arm
a
folded
dustcoat
,
*NL*
a
stick
and
an
umbrella
dangled
to
his
stride
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Watch

Mr

said
.
He
always
walks
outside

*NL*
Watch

*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
he
if
it
's

Mrs

asked

Is

dotty
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
His

is
Cashel
Boyle
O'Connor
Fitzmaurice

Mr

she
said

*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
off
suddenly

*NL*
*NL*
--
There
he

she
said

I

Goodbye

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
dodge
through

towards
the
shopfronts
.
Denis
Breen
*NL*

skimpy
frockcoat
and
blue
canvas

shuffled
out
of

*NL*
hugging
two
heavy
tomes
to
his
ribs
.
Blown
in
from
the
bay
.
Like
old
*NL*
times
.
He
suffered
her
to
overtake
him
without
surprise
and
thrust
*NL*
his
dull
grey
beard
towards
her
,
his
loose
jaw
wagging
as
he
spoke
*NL*
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meshuggah

Off

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

walked
on

easily

seeing
ahead
of
him
in

the
*NL*
tight
skullpiece

the
dangling
stickumbrelladustcoat

Going

Drop

Now
that
's
really
a
coincidence

second

Coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before

With
the
approval

Why
do
they
call
that
thing
they
gave
me
*NL*
nutsteak
?
Nutarians

Fruitarians

To
give
you
the
idea
you
are
eating

Absurd

Salty

They

Those
literary

people
they
are
all
.
Dreamy
,
cloudy
,
*NL*
symbolistic
.
Esthetes
they
are

I
would
n't
be
surprised
if
it
was
that
*NL*
kind
of
food
you
see
produces
the
like
waves
of
the
brain
the
poetical
.
*NL*
For
example
one
of
those
policemen
sweating
Irish
stew
into
their
shirts
*NL*
you
could
n't
squeeze
a
line
of
poetry
out

drop

Incredible

There

He
faced

,
standing
between
the
awnings

held
out
his
right
*NL*
hand
at
arm

length
towards
the
sun

Wanted
to
try
that
often

Yes
:
*NL*
completely
.
The
tip
of
his

blotted
out

Must

Is

*NL*

He

I

said

Is

Nosey

said

Not

Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
noticed

was

*NL*
*NL*

Was
he

Nosey
Flynn
said

So
he
was
,
faith
.
I
asked
him
how
was
all
at

home
.
You
're
right
,
by
God
.
So
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
broach
the
subject
,
Davy
Byrne
said
humanely
,
if
I
see
a
*NL*
gentleman
is
in
trouble
that
way
.
It
only
brings
it
up
fresh
in
their

minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
not

anyhow
,
Nosey
Flynn
said

I
met

Davy

said

*NL*
*NL*
Nosey
Flynn
pursed
his

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
does

buy

picks
up

You

*NL*
*NL*

How
so

Davy

asked

coming
from

*NL*
*NL*
Nosey
Flynn
made
swift
passes
in

with

He
*NL*
winked

*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
in

he
said

*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
tell
me
so
?
Davy
Byrne
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
much
so

Nosey
Flynn
said

Ancient
free

He
's

Light

They
give
him

I
was

by

well
,
I
wo
n't
say
who
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
a
fact
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
it
's
a
fine
order
,
Nosey
Flynn
said
.
They
stick
to
you
when
you
're
*NL*
down
.
I
know
a
fellow
was
trying
to
get
into
it
.
But
they
're
as
close
as
*NL*
damn
it
.
By
God
they
did
right
to
keep
the

out

Davy

--
There
was
one

,
Nosey
Flynn
said
,
hid
herself
in
a
clock
to
find
*NL*
out
what
they
do
be
doing

But
be
damned
but
they
smelt
her
out

swore

Davy
Byrne
,
sated
after
his
yawn
,
said
with
tearwashed
eyes
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
is
that
a
fact
?
Decent
quiet
man
he
is
.
I
often
saw
him
in
here
*NL*
and
I
never
once
saw
him
--
you
know
,
over
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
Almighty
could
n't
make
him
drunk
,
Nosey
Flynn
said
firmly
.
Slips
*NL*
off
when
the
fun
gets
too
hot
.
Did
n't
you
see
him
look
at
his
watch
?
Ah
,
*NL*
you
were
n't
there
.
If
you
ask
him
to
have
a
drink
first
thing
he
does
*NL*
he
outs
with
the
watch
to
see
what
he
ought
to
imbibe
.
Declare
to
God
he
*NL*
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
are
some
like
that
,
Davy
Byrne
said
.
He
's
a
safe
man
,
I
'd
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
not
too
bad
,
Nosey
Flynn
said
,
snuffling
it
up
.
He
's
been
known
*NL*
to
put
his
hand
down
too
to
help
a
fellow
.
Give
the
devil
his
due
.
O
,
*NL*
Bloom
has
his
good
points
.
But
there
's
one
thing
he
'll
never
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
scrawled
a
dry
pen
signature
beside
his
grog
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know

Davy
Byrne
said

*NL*
*NL*

Nothing

*NL*
Paddy
Leonard
and
Bantam
Lyons
came
in

Tom
Rochford
followed
frowning
,
*NL*
a
plaining
hand
on
his
claret
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

Paddy

asked

*NL*
*NL*
--
I

Nosey

answered

*NL*
*NL*

Well

what
'll
it
be

Paddy
Leonard
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
take

ginger
,
Bantam
Lyons
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
much

Paddy
Leonard
cried
.
Since
when
,
for
God

sake

What
's
*NL*
yours
,
Tom
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
How

Nosey
Flynn
asked
,
sipping
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
Tom
Rochford
pressed
his
hand
to
his
breastbone
and
*NL*
hiccupped
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Would
I
trouble
you
for
a
glass
of
fresh
water
,
Mr
Byrne
?
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly

*NL*
*NL*
Paddy
Leonard
eyed
his
alemates
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lord
love
a
duck
,
he
said
.
Look
at
what
I
'm
standing
drinks
to
!
Cold
*NL*
water
and
gingerpop
!
Two
fellows
that
would
suck
whisky
off
a
sore
leg
.
*NL*
He
has
some
bloody
horse
up
his
sleeve
for
the
Gold
cup
.
A
dead
snip
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Zinfandel
is
it
?
Nosey
Flynn
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Rochford
spilt
powder
from
a
twisted
paper
into
the
water
set
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
cursed
dyspepsia
,
he
said
before
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Breadsoda
is
very
good
,
Davy
Byrne
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Rochford
nodded
and
drank
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
Zinfandel
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Say
nothing
!
Bantam
Lyons
winked
.
I
'm
going
to
plunge
five
bob
on
my
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
if
you
're
worth
your
salt
and
be
damned
to
you
,
Paddy
Leonard
*NL*
said
.
Who
gave
it
to
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
on
his
way
out
raised
three
fingers
in
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
long
!
Nosey
Flynn
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
the
man
now
that
gave
it
to
me
,
Bantam
Lyons
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Prrwht

Paddy
Leonard
said
with
scorn
.
Mr
Byrne
,

we
'll
take

*NL*
Mr

walked
towards
Dawson
street
,
his
tongue
brushing
his
teeth
*NL*
smooth
.
Something
green
it
would
have
to
be

say
.
Then

At

coasted

His

Their

*NL*
Wonder
if
Tom
Rochford
will
do
anything
with
that
invention
of
his
?
*NL*
Wasting
time
explaining
it
to
Flynn
's
mouth
.
Lean
people
long

.
*NL*
Ought
to
be
a
hall
or
a
place
where

could
go
in

invent
*NL*

.
Course
then
you
'd
have
all

He
hummed

A

stood
tapping
the
curbstone
with
his
slender
cane
.
No

in

Wants

*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
want

cross
?
Mr

asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
stripling
did
not
answer
.
His
wallface
frowned
weakly
.
He
*NL*
moved
his
head
uncertainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
in
Dawson
street
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
Molesworth
street
is
opposite

*NL*
Do
you
want
to
cross
?
There
's
nothing
in
the
way

*NL*
*NL*
The
cane
moved
out
trembling
to
the
left
.
Mr
Bloom
's
eye
followed
its
*NL*
line
and
saw
again
the
dyeworks
'
van
drawn
up
before
Drago
's
.
Where
I
*NL*
saw
his
brillantined
hair
just
when
I
was

in

*NL*

Do

answered

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
the
thin
elbow
gently
:
then
took
the
limp
seeing
hand
to
*NL*
guide
it
forward

*NL*
*NL*
Say
something
to

Better

his

Milly

Sizing
me
up
I

from

Wonder
*NL*
if

Keep

*NL*
The
blind
stripling
tapped
the
curbstone
and
went
on
his
way
,
drawing
*NL*
his
cane
back
,
feeling
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
walked
behind
the
eyeless
feet
,
a
flatcut
suit
of
herringbone
*NL*
tweed
.
Poor
young
fellow
!
How
on
earth
did
he
know
that
van
was
there
?
*NL*
Must
have
felt
it
.
See
things
in
their
forehead
perhaps
:
kind
of
sense
*NL*
of
volume
.
Weight
or
size
of
it
,
something
blacker
than
the
dark
.
Wonder
*NL*
would
he
feel
it
if
something
was
removed
.
Feel
a
gap
.
Queer
idea
of
*NL*
Dublin
he
must
have
,
tapping
his
way
round
by
the
stones
.
Could
he
walk
*NL*
in
a
beeline
if
he
had
n't
that
cane
?
Bloodless
pious
face
like
a
fellow
*NL*
going
in
to
be
a
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Penrose

That
was
that
chap

*NL*
*NL*
Look
at
all
the

they
can
learn
to
do
.
Read
with
their
fingers
.
*NL*
Tune
pianos
.
Or
we
are
surprised
they
have
any
brains
.
Why
we
think
a
*NL*
deformed
person
or
a
hunchback
clever
if
he
says
something
we
might
say
.
*NL*
Of
course
the
other
senses
are
more
.
Embroider
.
Plait

People
*NL*

could

Might
take
an
objection
.
Dark

call

*NL*
*NL*
Sense
of

must
be
stronger
too
.
Smells
on
all

,
bunched
*NL*
together

Each
street
different
smell
.
Each
person
too
.
Then
the
spring
,
*NL*
the
summer
:
smells
.
Tastes
?
They
say
you
ca
n't
taste
wines
with
your
*NL*
eyes
shut
or
a
cold
in
the
head
.
Also
smoke
in
the
dark
they
say
get
no
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
woman
,
for
instance
.
More
shameless
not
seeing
.
That
girl
*NL*
passing
the
Stewart
institution
,
head
in
the
air
.
Look
at
me
.
I
have
*NL*
them
all
on
.
Must
be
strange
not
to
see
her
.
Kind
of
a
form
in
his
*NL*
mind
's
eye
.
The
voice
,
temperatures
:
when
he
touches
her
with
his
*NL*
fingers
must
almost
see
the
lines
,
the
curves
.
His
hands
on
her
hair
,
*NL*
for
instance
.
Say
it
was
black
,
for
instance
.
Good
.
We
call
it
black
.
*NL*
Then
passing
over
her
white
skin
.
Different
feel
perhaps
.
Feeling
of
*NL*
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
Postoffice

Must
answer

's
just

*NL*
too
.
Wait
.
Think
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
gentle
finger
he
felt
ever
so
slowly
the
hair
combed
back
above
*NL*
his
ears
.
Again
.
Fibres
of
fine
fine
straw
.
Then
gently
his
finger
felt
*NL*
the
skin
of
his
right
cheek
.
Downy
hair
there
too
.
Not
smooth
enough
.
*NL*
The
belly
is
the
smoothest
.
No-one
about

There
he
goes

Perhaps

academy

Might
be
settling
*NL*
my

*NL*
*NL*
Walking
by
Doran

publichouse
he
slid
his
hand
between
his
waistcoat
*NL*
and
trousers
and
,
pulling
aside
his
shirt
gently
,
felt
a
slack
fold
of
*NL*
his
belly
.
But
I
know
it
's
whitey
yellow

Want
to
try

*NL*
*NL*
He
withdrew
his

and
pulled
his

to

*NL*
*NL*
Poor

Quite

Terrible

Really

What

All

.
The
supreme
question
about
a
*NL*
work
of
art
is
out
of
how
deep
a
life
does
it
spring
.
The
painting
of

is
the
painting
of

.
The

For

the

What
is
a
ghost
?
Stephen
said
with
tingling
energy
.
One
who
has
faded
*NL*
into
impalpability
through
death
,
through
absence
,
through
change
of
*NL*
manners
.
Elizabethan
London
lay
as
far
from
Stratford
as
corrupt
Paris
*NL*
lies
from
virgin
Dublin
.
Who
is
the
ghost
from
_
limbo
patrum
_
,
returning
*NL*
to
the
world
that
has
forgotten
him
?
Who
is
King
Hamlet
?
*NL*
*NL*
John
Eglinton
shifted
his
spare
body
,
leaning
back
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lifted
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
this
hour
of
a
day
in
mid
June
,
Stephen
said
,
begging
with
*NL*
a
swift
glance
their
hearing
.
The
flag
is
up
on
the
playhouse
by
the
*NL*
bankside
.
The
bear
Sackerson
growls
in
the
pit
near
it
,
Paris
garden
.
*NL*
Canvasclimbers
who
sailed
with
Drake
chew
their
sausages
among
the
*NL*
groundlings

*NL*

all
you

*NL*
*NL*
--
Shakespeare
has
left
the
huguenot
's
house
in
Silver
street
and
walks
*NL*
by
the
swanmews
along
the
riverbank
.
But
he
does
not
stay
to
feed
the
*NL*
pen
chivying
her
game
of
cygnets
towards
the
rushes
.
The
swan
of
Avon
*NL*
has
other
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Composition
of

.
Ignatius
Loyola
,
make
haste
to
help
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
play
begins
.
A
player
comes
on
under
the
shadow
,
made
up
in
the
*NL*
castoff
mail
of
a
court
buck
,
a
wellset
man
with
a
bass
voice
.
It
is
the
*NL*
ghost
,
the
king
,
a
king
and
no
king
,
and
the
player
is
Shakespeare
who
*NL*
has
studied
_
Hamlet
_
all
the
years
of
his
life
which
were
not
vanity
in
*NL*
order
to
play
the
part
of
the
spectre
.
He
speaks
the
words
to
Burbage
,
*NL*
the
young
player
who
stands
before
him
beyond
the
rack
of
cerecloth
,
*NL*
calling
him
by
a
name
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Hamlet
,
I
am
thy
father
's
spirit
,
_
*NL*
*NL*
bidding
him
list
.
To
a
son
he
speaks
,
the
son
of
his
soul
,
the
prince
,
*NL*
young
Hamlet
and
to
the
son
of
his
body
,
Hamnet
Shakespeare
,
who
has
*NL*
died
in
Stratford
that
his
namesake
may
live
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
possible
that
that
player
Shakespeare
,
a
ghost
by
absence
,
and
in
*NL*
the
vesture
of
buried
Denmark
,
a
ghost
by
death
,
speaking
his
own
words
*NL*
to
his
own
son
's
name
-LRB-
had
Hamnet
Shakespeare
lived
he
would
have
been
*NL*
prince
Hamlet
's
twin
-RRB-
,
is
it
possible
,
I
want
to
know
,
or
probable
that
*NL*
he
did
not
draw
or
foresee
the
logical
conclusion
of
those
premises
:
you
*NL*
are
the
dispossessed
son
:
I
am
the
murdered
father
:
your
mother
is
the
*NL*
guilty
queen
,
Ann
Shakespeare
,
born
Hathaway
?
*NL*
*NL*

But
this
prying
into
the
family
life
of

began
*NL*
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
--
Interesting
only
to
the

clerk

I
mean

we
have
the

.
I
*NL*
mean
when
we
read
the
poetry
of
_
King
Lear
_
what
is
it
to
us
how
the
*NL*
poet
lived
?
As

John
Eglinton
's
carping
voice
asked
.
Her
ghost
at
least
has
been
laid
*NL*
for
ever
.
She
died
,
for
literature
at

,
before
she
was

*NL*
*NL*
--
She
died
,
Stephen
retorted
,
sixtyseven
years
after
she
was
born
.
She
*NL*
saw
him
into
and
out
of
the
world
.
She
took
his
first
embraces
.
She
bore
*NL*
his
children
and
she
laid
pennies
on
his
eyes
to
keep
his
eyelids
closed

lay
on

John
Eglinton
looked
in
the
tangled
glowworm
of
his
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
world
believes
that
Shakespeare
made
a
mistake
,
he
said
,
and
got
*NL*
out
of
it
as
quickly
and
as
best
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bosh
!
Stephen
said
rudely
.
A
man
of
genius
makes
no
mistakes
.
His
*NL*
errors
are
volitional
and
are
the
portals
of
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Portals
of
discovery
opened
to
let
in
the
quaker
librarian
,
*NL*
softcreakfooted
,
bald
,
eared
and
assiduous
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
shrew
,
John
Eglinton
said
shrewdly
,
is
not
a
useful
portal
of
*NL*
discovery
,
one
should
imagine
.
What
useful
discovery
did
Socrates
learn
*NL*
from
Xanthippe
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dialectic
,
Stephen
answered
:
and
from
his
mother
how
to
bring
thoughts
*NL*
into
the
world
.
What
he
learnt
from
his
other
wife
Myrto

_
absit

_
-RRB-
,
Socratididion
's
Epipsychidion
,
no
man
,
not
a
woman
,
will
ever
*NL*
know
.
But
neither
the
midwife
's
lore
nor
the
caudlelectures
saved
him
*NL*
from
the
archons
of
Sinn
Fein
and
their
naggin
of
hemlock
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
Ann
Hathaway
?
Mr
Best
's
quiet
voice
said
forgetfully
.
Yes
,
we
seem
*NL*
to
be
forgetting
her
as
Shakespeare
himself
forgot
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
look
went
from
brooder
's
beard
to
carper
's
skull
,
to
remind
,
to
*NL*
chide
them
not
unkindly
,
then
to
the
baldpink
lollard
costard
,
guiltless
*NL*
though
maligned
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
had
a
good
groatsworth
of
wit
,
Stephen
said
,
and
no
truant
memory
.
*NL*
He
carried
a
memory
in
his
wallet
as
he
trudged
to
Romeville
whistling
*NL*
_
The
girl
I
left
behind
me

_
If
the
earthquake
did
not
time
it
we
should
*NL*
know
where
to
place
poor
Wat
,
sitting
in
his
form
,
the
cry
of
hounds
,
*NL*
the
studded
bridle
and
her
blue
windows
.
That
memory
,
_
Venus
and
*NL*
Adonis
_
,
lay
in
the
bedchamber
of
every
light-of-love
in
London
.
*NL*
Is
Katharine

Hortensio

Do
you
think
the
writer
of
_
Antony
and
Cleopatra
_
,
a
*NL*
passionate
pilgrim
,
had
his
eyes
in
the
back
of
his
head
that
he
chose
*NL*
the
ugliest
doxy
in
all
Warwickshire
to
lie
withal
?
Good
:
he
left
her
*NL*
and
gained
the
world
of
men
.
But
his
boywomen
are
the
women
of
a

.
*NL*
Their
life
,

,
speech
are
lent
them
by

.
He
chose
badly
?
He
*NL*
was
chosen
,
it
seems
to
me
.
If
others
have
their
will
Ann
hath
a
way
.
*NL*
By

she
was

She

He
creaked
to

,
tiptoing
up
nearer
heaven
by
the
altitude
of
a
*NL*
chopine
,
and
,
covered
by
the
noise
of
outgoing
,
said
low
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
your
view
,
then
,
that
she
was
not
faithful
to
the
poet
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alarmed
face
asks
me
.
Why
did
he
come
?
Courtesy
or
an
inward
light
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
there
is
a
reconciliation
,
Stephen
said
,
there
must
have
been
*NL*
first
a
sundering
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christfox
in
leather
trews
,
hiding
,
a
runaway
in
blighted
treeforks
,
*NL*
from
hue
and
cry
.
Knowing
no
vixen
,
walking
lonely
in
the
chase
.
Women
*NL*
he
won
to
him
,
tender
people
,
a
whore
of
Babylon
,
ladies
of

,
*NL*
bully
tapsters
'
wives
.
Fox
and

.
And
in
New
Place
a
slack
*NL*
dishonoured
body
that
once
was
comely
,
once
as
sweet
,
as
fresh
as
*NL*
cinnamon
,
now
her
leaves
falling
,
all
,
bare
,
frighted
of
the
narrow
*NL*
grave
and
unforgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
.
So
you
think
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
closed
behind
the
outgoer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rest
suddenly
possessed
the
discreet
vaulted
cell
,
rest
of
warm
and
*NL*
brooding
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
vestal

.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
ponders
things
that
were
not
:
what
Caesar
would
have
lived
to
do
*NL*
had
he
believed
the
soothsayer
:
what
might
have
been
:
possibilities
of
*NL*
the
possible
as
possible
:
things
not
known
:
what
name
Achilles
bore
when
*NL*
he
lived
among
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coffined
thoughts
around

,
in

embalmed
in

of

.
*NL*
Thoth
,

,
a

,

.
And
I
heard
the
*NL*
voice
of
that
Egyptian
highpriest
.
_
In
painted
chambers
loaded
with
*NL*
tilebooks
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
still
.
Once
quick
in
the
brains
of
men
.
Still
:
but
an
itch
of
*NL*
death
is
in
them
,
to
tell
me
in
my
ear
a
maudlin
tale
,
urge
me
to
wreak
*NL*
their
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly
,
John
Eglinton
mused
,
of
all
great
men
he
is
the
most
*NL*
enigmatic
.
We
know
nothing
but
that
he
lived
and
suffered
.
Not
even
so
*NL*
much
.
Others
abide
our
question
.
A
shadow
hangs
over
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
_
Hamlet
_
is
so
personal
,
is
n't
it
?
Mr
Best
pleaded
.
I
mean
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
private
paper
,
do
n't
you
know
,
of
his
private
life

I
mean
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
a

,
do
n't
you
know
,
who
is
killed
or
who
is
guilty
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
rested
an
innocent
book
on
the
edge
of
the
desk
,
smiling
his
*NL*
defiance
.
His
private
papers
in

Eglinton
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
prepared
for
paradoxes
from
what
Malachi
Mulligan
told
us
but
*NL*
I
may
as
well
warn
you
that
if
you
want
to
shake
my
belief
that
*NL*
Shakespeare
is
Hamlet
you
have
a
stern
task
before
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bear
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
withstood
the
bane
of
miscreant
eyes
glinting
stern
under
*NL*
wrinkled
brows
.
A
basilisk
.
_
E

Messer
*NL*
Brunetto
,
I
thank
thee
for
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
we
,
or
mother
Dana
,
weave
and
unweave
our
bodies
,
Stephen
said
,
*NL*
from
day
to
day
,
their
molecules
shuttled
to
and
fro
,
so
does
the
artist
*NL*
weave
and
unweave
his
image
.
And
as
the
mole
on
my
right
breast
is
where
*NL*
it
was
when
I
was
born
,
though
all
my
body
has
been
woven
of
new
stuff
*NL*
time
after
time
,
so
through
the
ghost
of
the
unquiet
father
the
image
*NL*
of
the
unliving
son
looks
forth
.
In
the
intense
instant
of
imagination
,
*NL*
when
the
mind
,
Shelley
says
,
is
a
fading
coal
,
that
which
I
was
is
that
*NL*
which
I
am
and
that
which
in
possibility
I
may
come
to
be
.
So
in
the
*NL*
future
,
the
sister
of
the
past
,
I
may
see
myself
as
I
sit
here
now
but
*NL*
by
reflection
from
that
which
then
I
shall
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drummond
of
Hawthornden
helped
you
at
that
stile
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mr
Best
said
youngly
.
I
feel
Hamlet
quite
young
.
The
bitterness
*NL*
might
be
from
the
father
but
the
passages
with
Ophelia
are
surely
from
*NL*
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Has
the
wrong
sow
by
the
lug
.
He
is
in
my
father
.
I
am
in
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
mole
is
the
last
to
go
,
Stephen
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Eglinton
made
a
nothing
pleasing
mow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
that
were
the
birthmark
of
genius
,
he
said
,
genius
would
be
a
*NL*
drug
in
the
market
.
The
plays
of
Shakespeare
's
later
years
which
Renan
*NL*
admired
so
much
breathe
another
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
spirit
of
reconciliation
,
the
quaker
librarian
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
can
be
no
reconciliation
,
Stephen
said
,
if
there
has
not
been
a
*NL*
sundering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Said
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
you
want
to
know
what
are
the
events
which
cast
their
shadow

King

lifts

What

His

image
to
a
man
with
that
queer
thing
genius
is
the
standard
of
*NL*
all
experience
,
material
and
moral
.
Such
an
appeal
will
touch
him
.
The
*NL*
images
of
other
males
of
his
blood
will
repel
him
.
He
will
see
in
them
*NL*
grotesque
attempts
of
nature
to
foretell
or
to
repeat
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
benign
forehead
of
the
quaker
librarian
enkindled
rosily
with
hope

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
hope
Mr
Dedalus
will
work
out
his
theory
for
the
enlightenment
of
*NL*
the
public
.
And
we
ought
to
mention
another
Irish
commentator
,
Mr
George
*NL*
Bernard
Shaw
.
Nor
should
we
forget
Mr
Frank
Harris
.
His
articles
on
*NL*
Shakespeare
in
the
_
Saturday
Review
_
were
surely
brilliant
.
Oddly
*NL*
enough
he
too
draws
for
us
an
unhappy
relation
with
the
dark
lady
of
the
*NL*
sonnets
.
The
favoured
rival
is
William
Herbert
,
earl
of
Pembroke
.
I
own
*NL*
that
if
the
poet
must
be
rejected
such
a
rejection
would
seem
more
in
*NL*
harmony
with
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
our
notions
of
what
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felicitously
he
ceased
and
held
a
meek
head
among
them

auk

prize
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
--
That
may
be
too
,
Stephen
said
.
There
's
a
saying
of
Goethe
's
which
Mr
*NL*
Magee
likes
to
quote
.
Beware
of
what
you
wish
for
in
youth
because
*NL*
you
will
get
it
in
middle
life
.
Why
does
he
send
to
one
who
is
*NL*
a
_
buonaroba
,
_
a
bay
where
all
men
ride
,
a
maid
of
honour
with
a
*NL*
scandalous
girlhood
,
a
lordling
to
woo
for
him
?
He
was
himself
a
lord
*NL*
of
language
and
had
made
himself
a
coistrel
gentleman
and
he
had
written
*NL*
_
Romeo
and
Juliet
_
.
Why
?
Belief
in
himself
has
been
untimely
killed
.
He
*NL*
was
overborne
in
a
cornfield
first
-LRB-
ryefield
,
I
should
say
-RRB-
and
he
will
*NL*
never
be
a
victor
in
his
own
eyes
after
nor
play
victoriously
the
game
*NL*
of
laugh
and
lie
down
.
Assumed
dongiovannism
will
not
save
him
.
No
later
*NL*
undoing
will
undo
the
first
undoing
.
The
tusk
of
the
boar
has
wounded
*NL*
him
there
where
love
lies
ableeding
.
If
the
shrew
is
worsted
yet
there
*NL*
remains
to
her
woman
's
invisible
weapon
.
There
is
,
I
feel
in
the
words
,
*NL*
some
goad
of
the
flesh
driving
him
into
a
new
passion
,
a
darker
shadow
*NL*
of
the
first
,
darkening
even
his
own
understanding
of
himself
.
A
like
*NL*
fate
awaits
him
and
the
two
rages
commingle
in
a
whirlpool
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
list
.
And
in
the
porches
of
their
ears
I
pour
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
soul
has
been
before
stricken
mortally
,
a
poison
poured
in
the
*NL*
porch
of
a
sleeping
ear
.
But
those
who
are
done
to
death
in
sleep
can
not
*NL*
know
the
manner
of
their
quell
unless
their
Creator
endow
their
souls
*NL*
with
that
knowledge
in
the
life
to
come
.
The
poisoning
and
the
beast
*NL*
with
two
backs
that
urged
it
King
Hamlet
's
ghost
could
not
know
of
were
*NL*
he
not
endowed
with
knowledge
by
his
creator
.
That
is
why
the
speech
*NL*
-LRB-
his
lean
unlovely
English
-RRB-
is
always
turned
elsewhere
,
backward
.
*NL*
Ravisher
and
ravished
,
what
he
would
but
would
not
,
go
with
him
from
*NL*
Lucrece
's
bluecircled
ivory
globes
to
Imogen
's
breast
,
bare
,
with
its
*NL*
mole
cinquespotted
.
He
goes
back
,
weary
of
the
creation
he
has
piled
up
*NL*
to
hide
him
from
himself
,
an
old
dog
licking
an
old
sore
.
But
,
because
*NL*
loss
is
his
gain
,
he
passes
on
towards
eternity
in
undiminished
*NL*
personality
,
untaught
by
the
wisdom
he
has
written
or
by
the
laws
he
*NL*
has
revealed
.
His
beaver
is
up
.
He
is
a
ghost
,
a
shadow
now
,
the
wind
by
*NL*
Elsinore
's
rocks
or
what
you
will
,
the

's
voice
,
a
voice
heard
*NL*
only
in
the
heart
of
him
who

the

of

the

*NL*
consubstantial

I
'll
be
bound
,
has
his
theory
too
of
the
play
and
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
.
All
sides
of
life
should
be
represented
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
on
all
sides
equally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
thought
,
puzzled
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Shakespeare
?
he
said
.
I
seem
to
know
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flying
sunny
smile
rayed
in
his
loose
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
be
sure
,
he
said
,
remembering
brightly
.
The
chap
that
writes
like
*NL*
Synge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Best
turned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Haines
missed
you
,
he
said
.
Did
you
meet
him
?
He
'll
see
you
after
at
*NL*
the

B.
C.
He
's
gone

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
came
through
the
museum
,
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
Was
he
here
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
bard
's
fellowcountrymen
,
John
Eglinton
answered
,
are
rather
tired
*NL*
perhaps
of
our
brilliancies
of
theorising
.
I
hear
that
an
actress
played
*NL*
Hamlet
for
the
fourhundredandeighth
time
last
night
in
Dublin
.
Vining
*NL*
held
that
the
prince
was
a
woman
.
Has
no-one
made
him
out
to
be
an
*NL*
Irishman
?
Judge
Barton
,
I
believe
,
is
searching
for
some
clues
.
He
*NL*
swears
-LRB-
His
Highness
not
His
Lordship
-RRB-
by
saint
Patrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
most
brilliant
of
all
is
that
story
of
Wilde
's
,
Mr
Best
said
,
*NL*
lifting
his
brilliant
notebook
.
That
_
Portrait
of
Mr
W.
H.
_
where
he
*NL*
proves
that
the
sonnets
were
written
by
a
Willie
Hughes
,
a
man
all
hues
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
Willie
Hughes
,
is
it
not
?
the
quaker
librarian
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
Hughie
Wills
?
Mr
William
Himself
.
W.
H.
:
who
am
I
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
,
for
Willie
Hughes
,
Mr
Best
said
,
amending
his
gloss
easily
.
Of
*NL*
course
it
's
all
paradox
,
do
n't
you
know
,
Hughes
and
hews
and
hues
,
*NL*
the
colour
,
but
it
's
so
typical
the
way
he
works
it
out
.
It
's
the
very
*NL*
essence
of
Wilde
,
do
n't
you
know
.
The
light
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
glance
touched
their
faces
lightly
as
he
smiled
,
a
blond

*NL*
Tame

of

Do

it
is

a

?
the
quaker

was
asking
.
*NL*
The

never

is

*NL*
*NL*
They

*NL*
Buck

awhile

Then
,
his

wagging
,
he
came

drew
a

His

Joyfully
he
thrust

into

keened
in

*NL*
*NL*

I
found
him

Twenty

lived

that
time
,
he
drew
a
salary

equal

that
of

His
life
was
rich

His

But
she

did
not
break

Two

are
rank
in

a

her

In

in

royal
London
to

she
had
to
borrow
forty

from

Explain

then

Eglinton

You

But
that
has
been
explained

I

by

*NL*
She
was
entitled
to
her

At

And
therefore
he
left

*NL*
For

for

in

And
therefore
when
he
was
urged
,
*NL*
As
I
believe
,
to
name
her
*NL*
He
left
her

He

*NL*
William

in

a

He

it

Like

What
's
in

*NL*
That
is
what
we
ask
ourselves
in

we
write
the
name
that
*NL*
we
are
told
is
ours
.
A

a

rose

*NL*
It
shone
by

brighter

by

it
shone
over

,
the
recumbent
*NL*
constellation
which
is
the
signature
of

among

His

watched
it

lowlying

*NL*
--
You
will
say
those
names
were
already
in
the
chronicles
from
which
he
*NL*
took
the
stuff
of
his
plays
.
Why
did
he
take
them
rather
than
others
?
*NL*
Richard
,
a
whoreson
crookback

*NL*
-LRB-
what

-RRB-

,
a

.
Richard
*NL*
the
conqueror
,
third
brother
,
came
after
William
the
conquered
.
The
*NL*
other
four
acts
of
that
play
hang
limply
from
that
first
.
Of
all
his
*NL*
kings
Richard
is
the
only
king
unshielded
by
Shakespeare
's
reverence
,
*NL*
the
angel
of
the
world
.
Why
is
the
underplot
of
_
King
Lear
_
in
which
*NL*
Edmund
figures
lifted
out
of
Sidney
's
_
Arcadia
_
and
spatchcocked
on
to
a
*NL*
Celtic
legend
older
than
history
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
was
Will
's
way
,
John
Eglinton
defended
.
We
should
not
now
combine
*NL*
a
Norse
saga
with
an
excerpt
from
a
novel
by
George
Meredith
.
_
Que
*NL*
voulez-vous

_
Moore
would
say
.
He
puts
Bohemia
on
the
seacoast
and
makes
*NL*
Ulysses
quote
Aristotle
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
?
Stephen
answered
himself
.
Because
the
theme
of
the
false
or
*NL*
the
usurping
or
the
adulterous
brother
or
all
three
in
one
is
to
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
what
the
poor
are
not
,
always
with
him
.
The
note
of
*NL*
banishment
,
banishment
from
the
heart
,
banishment
from
home
,
sounds
*NL*
uninterruptedly
from
_
The
Two
Gentlemen
of
Verona
_
onward
till
Prospero
*NL*
breaks
his
staff
,
buries
it
certain
fathoms
in
the
earth
and
drowns
his
*NL*
book
.
It
doubles
itself
in
the
middle
of
his
life
,
reflects
itself
in
*NL*
another
,
repeats
itself
,
protasis
,
epitasis
,
catastasis
,
catastrophe
.
*NL*
It
repeats
itself
again
when
he
is
near
the
grave
,
when
his
married
*NL*
daughter
Susan
,
chip
of
the
old
block
,
is
accused
of
adultery
.
But
it
*NL*
was
the
original
sin
that
darkened
his
understanding
,
weakened
his
will
*NL*
and
left
in
him
a
strong
inclination
to
evil
.
The
words
are
those
of
*NL*
my
lords
bishops
of
Maynooth
.
An
original
sin
and
,
like
original
sin
,
*NL*
committed
by
another
in
whose
sin
he
too
has
sinned
.
It
is
between
the
*NL*
lines
of
his
last
written
words
,
it
is
petrified
on
his
tombstone
under
*NL*
which
her
four
bones
are
not
to
be
laid
.
Age
has
not
withered
it
.
Beauty
*NL*
and
peace
have
not
done
it
away
.
It
is
in
infinite
variety
everywhere
in
*NL*
the
world
he
has
created
,
in
_
Much
Ado
about
Nothing
_
,
twice
in
_
As
you
*NL*
like
It
_
,
in
_
The

_
,

,
_
in

Measure

--
and

He
laughed

free
his

*NL*
Judge
Eglinton
summed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
truth
is
midway

he
affirmed
.
He
is
the
ghost
and
the
prince
.
He
*NL*
is
all
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is

Stephen
said
.
The

of

is

of

five
.
*NL*
All
in

.
In

in

_
he
is

cuckold
.
He
acts

is

on

Lover
of
an
ideal
or
a
perversion
,
like

he
*NL*
kills

His

is

Stephen
said

He
returns
after

a

to

of

where
he
was
born
,
where
he
has

he

taken
off

justice
to
the

place
where
the

go

Strong
curtain

He

*NL*

says

If

Every

The

*NL*
who
wrote

and
wrote
it
badly
-LRB-
He
gave
us
light
*NL*
first
and
the

two

later
-RRB-
,
the

of

as
they
are
whom
*NL*
the
most
Roman
of

call
_

_
,
hangman

,
is
doubtless
*NL*
all

all
in
all

,
ostler

,
and
would
be
bawd
and
*NL*
cuckold
too
but
that
in
the
economy

,
foretold
by

,
there
*NL*

no

You

John

to

You

No

Stephen
said
promptly

*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
going

Mr

asked
.
You
ought
to
make
it
a

dialogue
,
do

wrote

*NL*
*NL*
John

doubly

he
said

I
do

why
you
should
expect

for
it
since
you
do

Dowden
believes
there
is
*NL*
some

will
say
no

Herr

,
the

met

who

He
is

Piper
says
,
and
prove

wrote

It
will
come
as
a

to

But
he
*NL*
believes

I

O

That

*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
crossed
to
Mountjoy
square
.
He
thought
,
but
not
for
long
,
*NL*
of
soldiers
and
sailors
,
whose
legs
had
been
shot
off
by
cannonballs
,
*NL*
ending
their
days
in
some
pauper
ward
,
and
of
cardinal
Wolsey
's
words
:
*NL*
_
If
I
had
served
my
God
as
I
have
served
my
king
He
would
not
have
*NL*
abandoned
me
in
my
old
days
.
_
He
walked
by
the
treeshade
of
sunnywinking
*NL*
leaves
:
and
towards
him
came
the
wife
of
Mr
David
Sheehy
M.P.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
well
,
indeed
,
father
.
And
you
,
father
?
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
was
wonderfully
well
indeed
.
He
would
go
to
Buxton
*NL*
probably
for
the
waters
.
And
her
boys
,
were
they
getting
on
well
at
*NL*
Belvedere
?
Was
that
so
?
Father
Conmee
was
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
that
.
*NL*
And
Mr
Sheehy
himself
?
Still
in
London
.
The
house
was
still
sitting
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
it
was
.
Beautiful
weather
it
was
,
delightful
indeed
.
Yes
,
it
was
*NL*
very
probable
that
Father
Bernard
Vaughan
would
come
again
to
preach
.
O
,
*NL*
yes
:
a
very
great
success
.
A
wonderful
man
really
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
was
very
glad
to
see
the
wife
of
Mr
David
Sheehy
M.P.
*NL*
Iooking
so
well
and
he
begged
to
be
remembered
to
Mr
David
Sheehy
M.P.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
would
certainly
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
afternoon
,
Mrs
Sheehy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
doffed
his
silk
hat
and
smiled
,
as
he
took
leave
,
at
the
*NL*
jet
beads
of
her
mantilla
inkshining
in
the
sun
.
And
smiled
yet
again
,
*NL*
in
going
.
He
had
cleaned
his
teeth
,
he
knew
,
with
arecanut
paste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
walked
and
,
walking
,
smiled
for
he
thought
on
Father
*NL*
Bernard
Vaughan
's
droll
eyes
and
cockney
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pilate
!
Wy
do
n't
you
old
back
that
owlin
mob
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
zealous
man
,
however
.
Really
he
was
.
And
really
did
great
good
in
his
*NL*
way
.
Beyond
a
doubt
.
He
loved
Ireland
,
he
said
,
and
he
loved
the
Irish
.
*NL*
Of
good
family
too
would
one
think
it
?
Welsh
,
were
they
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
lest
he
forget
.
That
letter
to
father
provincial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
stopped
three
little
schoolboys
at
the
corner
of
Mountjoy
*NL*
square
.
Yes
:
they
were
from
Belvedere
.
The
little
house
.
Aha
.
And
were
*NL*
they
good
boys
at
school
?
O
.
That
was
very
good
now
.
And
what
was
his
*NL*
name
?
Jack
Sohan
.
And
his
name
?
Ger
.
Gallaher
.
And
the
other
little
man
?
*NL*
His
name
was
Brunny
Lynam
.
O
,
that
was
a
very
nice
name
to
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
gave
a
letter
from
his
breast
to
Master
Brunny
Lynam
and
*NL*
pointed
to
the
red
pillarbox
at
the
corner
of
Fitzgibbon
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
mind
you
do
n't
post
yourself
into
the
box
,
little
man
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
sixeyed
Father
Conmee
and
laughed
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
let
me
see
if
you
can
post
a
letter
,
Father
Conmee
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Brunny
Lynam
ran
across
the
road
and
put
Father
Conmee
's
letter
*NL*
to
father
provincial
into
the
mouth
of
the
bright
red
letterbox
.
Father
*NL*
Conmee
smiled
and
nodded
and
smiled
and
walked
along
Mountjoy
square
*NL*
east
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Denis
J
Maginni
,
professor
of
dancing
&
c
,
in
silk
hat
,
slate
*NL*
frockcoat
with
silk
facings
,
white
kerchief
tie
,
tight
lavender
*NL*
trousers
,
canary
gloves
and
pointed
patent
boots
,
walking
with
grave
*NL*
deportment
most
respectfully
took
the
curbstone
as
he
passed
lady
*NL*
Maxwell
at
the
corner
of
Dignam
's
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
that
not
Mrs
M'Guinness
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
M'Guinness
,
stately
,
silverhaired
,
bowed
to
Father
Conmee
from
the
*NL*
farther
footpath
along
which
she
sailed
.
And
Father
Conmee
smiled
and
*NL*
saluted
.
How
did
she
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
carriage
she
had
.
Like
Mary
,
queen
of
Scots
,
something
.
And
to
*NL*
think
that
she
was
a
pawnbroker
!
Well
,
now
!
Such
a.
.
.
what
should
he
*NL*
say
?
...
such
a
queenly
mien
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
walked
down
Great
Charles
street
and
glanced
at
the
shutup
*NL*
free
church
on
his
left
.
The
reverend
T.
R.
Greene
B.A.
will
-LRB-
D.V.
-RRB-
*NL*
speak
.
The
incumbent
they
called
him
.
He
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
say
*NL*
a
few
words
.
But
one
should
be
charitable
.
Invincible
ignorance
.
They
*NL*
acted
according
to
their
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
turned
the
corner
and
walked
along
the
North
Circular
*NL*
road
.
It
was
a
wonder
that
there
was
not
a
tramline
in
such
an
important
*NL*
thoroughfare
.
Surely
,
there
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
band
of
satchelled
schoolboys
crossed
from
Richmond
street
.
All
*NL*
raised
untidy
caps
.
Father
Conmee
greeted
them
more
than
once
benignly
.
*NL*
Christian
brother
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
smelt
incense
on
his
right
hand
as
he
walked
.
Saint
*NL*
Joseph
's
church
,
Portland
row
.
For
aged
and
virtuous
females
.
*NL*
Father
Conmee
raised
his
hat
to
the
Blessed
Sacrament
.
Virtuous
:
but
*NL*
occasionally
they
were
also
badtempered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
Aldborough
house
Father
Conmee
thought
of
that
spendthrift
*NL*
nobleman
.
And
now
it
was
an
office
or
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
began
to
walk
along
the
North
Strand
road
and
was
saluted
*NL*
by
Mr
William
Gallagher
who
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
.
Father
*NL*
Conmee
saluted
Mr
William
Gallagher
and
perceived
the
odours
that
came
*NL*
from
baconflitches
and
ample
cools
of
butter
.
He
passed
Grogan
's
the
*NL*
Tobacconist
against
which
newsboards
leaned
and
told
of
a
dreadful
*NL*
catastrophe
in
New
York
.
In
America
those
things
were
continually
*NL*
happening
.
Unfortunate
people
to
die
like
that
,
unprepared
.
Still
,
an
*NL*
act
of
perfect
contrition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
went
by
Daniel
Bergin
's
publichouse
against
the
window
of
*NL*
which
two
unlabouring
men
lounged
.
They
saluted
him
and
were
saluted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
passed
H.
J.
O'Neill
's
funeral
establishment
where
Corny
*NL*
Kelleher
totted
figures
in
the
daybook
while
he
chewed
a
blade
of
hay
.
*NL*
A
constable
on
his
beat
saluted
Father
Conmee
and
Father
Conmee
saluted
*NL*
the
constable
.
In
Youkstetter
's
,
the
porkbutcher
's
,
Father
Conmee
*NL*
observed
pig
's
puddings
,
white
and
black
and
red
,
lie
neatly
curled
in
*NL*
tubes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moored
under
the
trees
of
Charleville
Mall
Father
Conmee
saw
a
*NL*
turfbarge
,
a
towhorse
with
pendent
head
,
a
bargeman
with
a
hat
of
dirty
*NL*
straw
seated
amidships
,
smoking
and
staring
at
a
branch
of
poplar
above
*NL*
him
.
It
was
idyllic
:
and
Father
Conmee
reflected
on
the
providence
of
*NL*
the
Creator
who
had
made
turf
to
be
in
bogs
whence
men
might
dig
it
*NL*
out
and
bring
it
to
town
and
hamlet
to
make
fires
in
the
houses
of
poor
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Newcomen
bridge
the
very
reverend
John
Conmee
S.J.
of
saint
Francis
*NL*
Xavier
's
church
,
upper
Gardiner
street
,
stepped
on
to
an
outward
bound
*NL*
tram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Off
an
inward
bound
tram
stepped
the
reverend
Nicholas
Dudley
C.
C.
of
*NL*
saint
Agatha
's
church
,
north
William
street
,
on
to
Newcomen
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Newcomen
bridge
Father
Conmee
stepped
into
an
outward
bound
tram
for
*NL*
he
disliked
to
traverse
on
foot
the
dingy
way
past
Mud
Island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
tramcar
,
a
blue
ticket
tucked
with
*NL*
care
in
the
eye
of
one
plump
kid
glove
,
while
four
shillings
,
a
sixpence
*NL*
and
five
pennies
chuted
from
his
other
plump
glovepalm
into
his
purse
.
*NL*
Passing
the
ivy
church
he
reflected
that
the
ticket
inspector
usually
*NL*
made
his
visit
when
one
had
carelessly
thrown
away
the
ticket
.
The
*NL*
solemnity
of
the
occupants
of
the
car
seemed
to
Father
Conmee
excessive
*NL*
for
a
journey
so
short
and
cheap
.
Father
Conmee
liked
cheerful
decorum
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
peaceful
day
.
The
gentleman
with
the
glasses
opposite
Father
*NL*
Conmee
had
finished
explaining
and
looked
down
.
His
wife
,
Father
Conmee
*NL*
supposed
.
A
tiny
yawn
opened
the
mouth
of
the
wife
of
the
gentleman
with
*NL*
the
glasses
.
She
raised
her
small
gloved
fist
,
yawned
ever
so
gently
,
*NL*
tiptapping
her
small
gloved
fist
on
her
opening
mouth
and
smiled
tinily
,
*NL*
sweetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
perceived
her
perfume
in
the
car
.
He
perceived
also
that
*NL*
the
awkward
man
at
the
other
side
of
her
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
at
the
altarrails
placed
the
host
with
difficulty
in
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
awkward
old
man
who
had
the
shaky
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Annesley
bridge
the
tram
halted
and
,
when
it
was
about
to
go
,
an
old
*NL*
woman
rose
suddenly
from
her
place
to
alight
.
The
conductor
pulled
the
*NL*
bellstrap
to
stay
the
car
for
her
.
She
passed
out
with
her
basket
and
*NL*
a
marketnet
:
and
Father
Conmee
saw
the
conductor
help
her
and
net
and
*NL*
basket
down
:
and
Father
Conmee
thought
that
,
as
she
had
nearly
passed
*NL*
the
end
of
the
penny
fare
,
she
was
one
of
those
good
souls
who
had
*NL*
always
to
be
told
twice
_
bless
you
,
my
child
,
_
that
they
have
been
*NL*
absolved
,
_
pray
for
me
.
_
But
they
had
so
many
worries
in
life
,
so
many
*NL*
cares
,
poor
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
hoardings
Mr
Eugene
Stratton
grimaced
with
thick
niggerlips
at
*NL*
Father
Conmee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
thought
of
the
souls
of
black
and
brown
and
yellow
men
and
*NL*
of
his
sermon
on
saint
Peter
Claver
S.J.
and
the
African
mission
and
of
*NL*
the
propagation
of
the
faith
and
of
the
millions
of
black
and
brown
and
*NL*
yellow
souls
that
had
not
received
the
baptism
of
water
when
their
last
*NL*
hour
came
like
a
thief
in
the
night
.
That
book
by
the
Belgian
jesuit
,
*NL*
_
Le
Nombre
des
Elus
,
_
seemed
to
Father
Conmee
a
reasonable
plea
.
Those
*NL*
were
millions
of
human
souls
created
by
God
in
His
Own
likeness
to
*NL*
whom
the
faith
had
not
-LRB-
D.V.
-RRB-
been
brought
.
But
they
were
God
's
souls
,
*NL*
created
by
God
.
It
seemed
to
Father
Conmee
a
pity
that
they
should
all
*NL*
be
lost
,
a
waste
,
if
one
might
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Howth
road
stop
Father
Conmee
alighted
,
was
saluted
by
the
*NL*
conductor
and
saluted
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Malahide
road
was
quiet
.
It
pleased
Father
Conmee
,
road
and
name
.
*NL*
The
joybells
were
ringing
in
gay
Malahide
.
Lord
Talbot
de
Malahide
,
*NL*
immediate
hereditary
lord
admiral
of
Malahide
and
the
seas
adjoining
.
*NL*
Then
came
the
call
to
arms
and
she
was
maid
,
wife
and
widow
in
one
day
.
*NL*
Those
were
old
worldish
days
,
loyal
times
in
joyous
townlands
,
old
times
*NL*
in
the
barony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
,
walking
,
thought
of
his
little
book
_
Old
Times
in
the
*NL*
Barony
_
and
of
the
book
that
might
be
written
about
jesuit
houses
and
of
*NL*
Mary
Rochfort
,
daughter
of
lord
Molesworth
,
first
countess
of
Belvedere
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
listless
lady
,
no
more
young
,
walked
alone
the
shore
of
lough
Ennel
,
*NL*
Mary
,
first
countess
of
Belvedere
,
listlessly
walking
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
not
startled
when
an
otter
plunged
.
Who
could
know
the
truth
?
Not
the
*NL*
jealous
lord
Belvedere
and
not
her
confessor
if
she
had
not
committed
*NL*
adultery
fully
,
_
eiaculatio
seminis
inter
vas
naturale
mulieris
,
_
with
*NL*
her
husband
's
brother
?
She
would
half
confess
if
she
had
not
all
sinned
*NL*
as
women
did
.
Only
God
knew
and
she
and
he
,
her
husband
's
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
thought
of
that
tyrannous
incontinence
,
needed
however
for
*NL*
man
's
race
on
earth
,
and
of
the
ways
of
God
which
were
not
our
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
Don
John
Conmee
walked
and
moved
in
times
of
yore
.
He
was
humane
and
*NL*
honoured
there
.
He
bore
in
mind
secrets
confessed
and
he
smiled
at
*NL*
smiling
noble
faces
in
a
beeswaxed
drawingroom
,
ceiled
with
full
fruit
*NL*
clusters
.
And
the
hands
of
a
bride
and
of
a
bridegroom
,
noble
to
noble
,
*NL*
were
impalmed
by
Don
John
Conmee
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
charming
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lychgate
of
a
field
showed
Father
Conmee
breadths
of
cabbages
,
*NL*
curtseying
to
him
with
ample
underleaves
.
The
sky
showed
him
a
flock
of
*NL*
small
white
clouds
going
slowly
down
the
wind
.
_
Moutonner
,
_
the
French
*NL*
said
.
A
just
and
homely
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
,
reading
his
office
,
watched
a
flock
of
muttoning
clouds
*NL*
over
Rathcoffey
.
His
thinsocked
ankles
were
tickled
by
the
stubble
of
*NL*
Clongowes
field
.
He
walked
there
,
reading
in
the
evening
,
and
heard
*NL*
the
cries
of
the
boys
'
lines
at
their
play
,
young
cries
in
the
quiet
*NL*
evening
.
He
was
their
rector
:
his
reign
was
mild
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Conmee
drew
off
his
gloves
and
took
his
rededged
breviary
out
.
An
*NL*

A
flushed
young
man
came
from
a
gap
of
a
hedge
and
after
him
came
a
*NL*
young
woman
with
wild
nodding
daisies
in
her
hand

The

man
raised
*NL*
his

abruptly
:
the

abruptly
bent
and
with
slow
care
*NL*
detached
from

a

Corny

closed
his

and
glanced
with
his
drooping
eye
*NL*
at
a
pine
coffinlid
sentried
in
a
corner
.
He
pulled
himself
erect
,
*NL*
went
to
it
and
,
spinning
it
on
its
axle
,
viewed
its
shape
and
brass
*NL*
furnishings
.
Chewing
his
blade
of
hay
he
laid
the
coffinlid
by
and
came
*NL*
to
the
doorway
.
There
he
tilted
his
hatbrim
to
give
shade
to
his

and
leaned
against

,
looking

out

Corny

sped

jet
of

arching
from

*NL*
while
a

from

window
in
Eccles

flung
forth
a

A

jerked

up

He
swung
himself
violently
forward
past

J.
J.
O'Molloy

was
told
that

*NL*
*NL*
A

stopped
,
took
a
copper
coin
from
her
purse
and
dropped
it
*NL*
into
the

held
out
to
her

The
sailor
grumbled
thanks
,
glanced
sourly
*NL*
at
the
unheeding
windows
,
sank
his
head
and
swung
himself
forward
four
*NL*
strides

Two

halted
near

gaping
at

He
swung
himself
forward
in

halted

lifted
his
head
*NL*
towards
a
window
and
bayed
deeply
:
*NL*
*NL*
--

*NL*
The
gay
sweet
chirping
whistling
within
went
on
a

two
,
ceased

*NL*
The
blind
of
the

was
drawn
aside

A

*NL*
slipped
from

A

A

One

ran
to

up

Boody

*NL*
Maggy
at

rammed
down
a

*NL*
twice
with

*NL*

she
asked

*NL*
*NL*
Katey
,
lifting

in

of

asked
:

what

*NL*
*NL*
A
heavy

gushed
in

Maggy
said

*NL*
*NL*

Where

The

Boody
sat
down
at
the

and
said
hungrily
:

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Maggy
poured
yellow
thick
soup
from
the
kettle
into
a
bowl
.
Katey
,
*NL*
sitting
opposite
Boody
,
said
quietly
,
as
her
fingertip
lifted
to
her
*NL*
mouth
random
crumbs
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A

Where

*NL*
Boody
,
breaking
big

of

into

added
:

He
turned
suddenly
from

drew
a
gold

from

his

held
it
at

Can

A

What

Blazes

He
took

a

the

*NL*

five
.
Only
*NL*
those
two
,
sir
,
for
Belfast
and
Liverpool
.
All
right
,
sir
.
Then
I
can
go
*NL*
after
six
if
you
're
not
back
.
A
quarter
after
.
Yes
,
sir
.
Twentyseven
and
*NL*
six
.
I
'll
tell
him

Yes
:
one

*NL*
*NL*
She
scribbled
three
figures
on
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr
Boylan
!
Hello
!
That
gentleman
from
SPORT
was
in
looking
for
you
.
Mr
*NL*
Lenehan
,
yes
.
He
said
he
'll
be
in
the
Ormond
at
four
.
No
,
sir
.
Yes
,
sir
.
*NL*
I
'll
ring
them
up
after
five
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
pink
faces
turned
in
the
flare
of
the
tiny
torch
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
's
that
?
Ned
Lambert
asked
.
Is
that
Crotty
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ringabella
and
Crosshaven
,
a
voice
replied
groping
for
foothold
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hello
,
Jack
,
is
that
yourself
?
Ned
Lambert
said
,
raising
in
salute
his
*NL*
pliant
lath
among
the
flickering
arches
.
Come
on
.
Mind
your
steps
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vesta
in
the
clergyman
's
uplifted
hand
consumed
itself
in
a
long
*NL*
soft
flame
and
was
let
fall
.
At
their
feet
its
red
speck
died
:
and
*NL*
mouldy
air
closed
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
interesting
!
a
refined
accent
said
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
,
Ned
Lambert
said
heartily
.
We
are
standing
in
the
historic
*NL*
council
chamber
of
saint
Mary
's
abbey
where
silken
Thomas
proclaimed
*NL*
himself
a
rebel
in
1534
.
This
is
the
most
historic
spot
in
all
Dublin
.
*NL*
O'Madden
Burke
is
going
to
write
something
about
it
one
of
these
days
.
*NL*
The
old
bank
of
Ireland
was
over
the
way
till
the
time
of
the
union
and
*NL*
the
original
jews
'
temple
was
here
too
before
they
built
their
synagogue
*NL*
over
in
Adelaide
road
.
You
were
never
here
before
,
Jack
,
were
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Ned
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
rode
down
through
Dame
walk
,
the
refined
accent
said
,
if
my
memory
*NL*
serves
me
.
The
mansion
of
the
Kildares
was
in
Thomas
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
right
,
Ned
Lambert
said
.
That
's
quite
right
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
you
will
be
so
kind
then
,
the
clergyman
said
,
the
next
time
to
*NL*
allow
me
perhaps
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly
,
Ned
Lambert
said
.
Bring
the
camera
whenever
you
like
.
I
'll
*NL*
get
those
bags
cleared
away
from
the
windows
.
You
can
take
it
from
here
*NL*
or
from
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
still
faint
light
he
moved
about
,
tapping
with
his
lath
the
piled
*NL*
seedbags
and
points
of
vantage
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
long
face
a
beard
and
gaze
hung
on
a
chessboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
deeply
obliged
,
Mr
Lambert
,
the
clergyman
said
.
I
wo
n't
trespass
*NL*
on
your
valuable
time
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
welcome
,
sir
,
Ned
Lambert
said
.
Drop
in
whenever
you
like
.
Next
*NL*
week
,
say
.
Can
you
see
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
yes
.
Good
afternoon
,
Mr
Lambert
.
Very
pleased
to
have
met
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pleasure
is
mine
,
sir
,
Ned
Lambert
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
his
guest
to
the
outlet
and
then
whirled
his
lath
away
among
*NL*
the
pillars
.
With
J.
J.
O'Molloy
he
came
forth
slowly
into
Mary
's
abbey
*NL*
where
draymen
were
loading
floats
with
sacks
of
carob
and
palmnut
meal
,
*NL*
O'Connor
,
Wexford
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
to
read
the
card
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
reverend
Hugh
C.
Love
,
Rathcoffey
.
Present
address
:
Saint
*NL*
Michael
's
,
Sallins
.
Nice
young
chap
he
is
.
He
's
writing
a
book
about
the
*NL*
Fitzgeralds
he
told
me
.
He
's
well
up
in
history
,
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
with
slow
care
detached
from
her
light
skirt
a
clinging
*NL*
twig
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
you
were
at
a
new
gunpowder
plot
,
J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Lambert
cracked
his
fingers
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
!
he
cried
.
I
forgot
to
tell
him
that
one
about
the
earl
of
Kildare
*NL*
after
he
set
fire
to
Cashel
cathedral
.
You
know
that
one
?
_
I
'm
bloody
*NL*
sorry
I
did
it
,
_
says
he
,
_
but
I
declare
to
God
I
thought
the
archbishop
*NL*
was
inside
.
_
He
might
n't
like
it
,
though
.
What
?
God
,
I
'll
tell
him
*NL*
anyhow
.
That
was
the
great
earl
,
the
Fitzgerald
Mor
.
Hot
members
they
*NL*
were
all
of
them
,
the
Geraldines
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
he
passed
started
nervously
under
their
slack
harness
.
He
*NL*
slapped
a
piebald
haunch
quivering
near
him
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Woa
,
sonny
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
J.
J.
O'Molloy
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
Jack
.
What
is
it
?
What
's
the
trouble
?
Wait
awhile
.
Hold
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
gaping
mouth
and
head
far
back
he
stood
still
and
,
after
an
*NL*
instant
,
sneezed
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Chow
!
he
said
.
Blast
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
dust
from
those
sacks
,
J.
J.
O'Molloy
said
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Ned
Lambert
gasped
,
I
caught
a.
.
.
cold
night
before
...
blast
*NL*
your
soul
...
night
before
last
...
and
there
was
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
*NL*
draught
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
his
handkerchief
ready
for
the
coming
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
...
Glasnevin
this
morning
...
poor
little
...
what
do
you
call
*NL*
him
...
Chow
!
...
Mother
of
Moses
!
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Rochford
took
the
top
disk
from
the
pile
he
clasped
against
his
*NL*
claret
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
See
?
he
said
.
Say
it
's
turn
six
.
In
here
,
see
.
Turn
Now
On
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slid
it
into
the
left
slot
for
them
.
It
shot
down
the
groove
,
wobbled
*NL*
a
while
,
ceased
,
ogling
them
:
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lawyers
of
the
past
,
haughty
,
pleading
,
beheld
pass
from
the
*NL*
consolidated
taxing
office
to
Nisi
Prius
court
Richie
Goulding
carrying
*NL*
the
costbag
of
Goulding
,
Collis
and
Ward
and
heard
rustling
from
the
*NL*
admiralty
division
of
king
's
bench
to
the
court
of
appeal
an
elderly
*NL*
female
with
false
teeth
smiling
incredulously
and
a
black
silk
skirt
of
*NL*
great
amplitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
See
?
he
said
.
See
now
the
last
one
I
put
in
is
over
here
:
Turns
Over
.
*NL*
The
impact
.
Leverage
,
see
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
them
the
rising
column
of
disks
on
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Smart
idea
,
Nosey
Flynn
said
,
snuffling
.
So
a
fellow
coming
in
late
*NL*
can
see
what
turn
is
on
and
what
turns
are
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
See
?
Tom
Rochford
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slid
in
a
disk
for
himself
:
and
watched
it
shoot
,
wobble
,
ogle
,
stop
:
*NL*
four
.
Turn
Now
On
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
see
him
now
in
the
Ormond
,
Lenehan
said
,
and
sound
him
.
One
good
*NL*
turn
deserves
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
,
Tom
Rochford
said
.
Tell
him
I
'm
Boylan
with
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Goodnight
,
M'Coy
said
abruptly
.
When
you
two
begin
*NL*
*NL*
Nosey
Flynn
stooped
towards
the
lever
,
snuffling
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
how
does
it
work
here
,
Tommy
?
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tooraloo
,
Lenehan
said
.
See
you
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
M'Coy
out
across
the
tiny
square
of
Crampton
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
a
hero
,
he
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
,
M'Coy
said
.
The
drain
,
you
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Drain
?
Lenehan
said
.
It
was
down
a
manhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
Dan
Lowry
's
musichall
where
Marie
Kendall
,
charming
*NL*
soubrette
,
smiled
on
them
from
a
poster
a
dauby
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
down
the
path
of
Sycamore
street
beside
the
Empire
musichall
*NL*
Lenehan
showed
M'Coy
how
the
whole
thing
was
.
One
of
those
manholes
like
*NL*
a
bloody
gaspipe
and
there
was
the
poor
devil
stuck
down
in
it
,
half
*NL*
choked
with
sewer
gas
.
Down
went
Tom
Rochford
anyhow
,
booky
's
vest
and
*NL*
all
,
with
the
rope
round
him
.
And
be
damned
but
he
got
the
rope
round
*NL*
the
poor
devil
and
the
two
were
hauled
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
act
of
a
hero
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Dolphin
they
halted
to
allow
the
ambulance
car
to
gallop
past
*NL*
them
for
Jervis
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
way
,
he
said
,
walking
to
the
right
.
I
want
to
pop
into
Lynam
's
*NL*
to
see
Sceptre
's
starting
price
.
What
's
the
time
by
your
gold
watch
and
*NL*
chain
?
*NL*
*NL*
M'Coy
peered
into
Marcus
Tertius
Moses
'
sombre
office
,
then
at
O'Neill
's
*NL*
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
three
,
he
said
.
Who
's
riding
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O.
Madden
,
Lenehan
said
.
And
a
game
filly
she
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
waited
in
Temple
bar
M'Coy
dodged
a
banana
peel
with
gentle
*NL*
pushes
of
his
toe
from
the
path
to
the
gutter
.
Fellow
might
damn
easy
*NL*
get
a
nasty
fall
there
coming
along
tight
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gates
of
the
drive
opened
wide
to
give
egress
to
the
viceregal
*NL*
cavalcade
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Even
money
,
Lenehan
said
returning
.
I
knocked
against
Bantam
Lyons
*NL*
in
there
going
to
back
a
bloody
horse
someone
gave
him
that
has
n't
an
*NL*
earthly
.
Through
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
up
the
steps
and
under
Merchants
'
arch
.
A
darkbacked
figure
*NL*
scanned
books
on
the
hawker
's
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
he
is
,
Lenehan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wonder
what
he
's
buying
,
M'Coy
said
,
glancing
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Leopoldo
or
the
Bloom
is
on
the
Rye
,
_
Lenehan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
dead
nuts
on
sales
,
M'Coy
said
.
I
was
with
him
one
day
and
he
*NL*
bought
a
book
from
an
old
one
in
Liffey
street
for
two
bob
.
There
were
*NL*
fine
plates
in
it
worth
double
the
money
,
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
*NL*
comets
with
long
tails
.
Astronomy
it
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
tell
you
a
damn
good
one
about
comets
'
tails
,
he
said
.
Come
over
*NL*
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
to
the
metal
bridge
and
went
along
Wellington
quay
by
the
*NL*
riverwall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Patrick
Aloysius
Dignam
came
out
of
Mangan
's
,
late
Fehrenbach
's
,
*NL*
carrying
a
pound
and
a
half
of
porksteaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
was
a
long
spread
out
at
Glencree
reformatory
,
Lenehan
said
*NL*
eagerly
.
The
annual
dinner
,
you
know
.
Boiled
shirt
affair
.
The
lord
*NL*
mayor
was
there
,
Val
Dillon
it
was
,
and
sir
Charles
Cameron
and
Dan
*NL*
Dawson
spoke
and
there
was
music
.
Bartell
d'Arcy
sang
and
Benjamin
*NL*
Dollard
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
,
M'Coy
broke
in
.
My
missus
sang
there
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
she
?
Lenehan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
card
_
Unfurnished
Apartments
_
reappeared
on
the
windowsash
of
number
7
*NL*
Eccles
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
checked
his
tale
a
moment
but
broke
out
in
a
wheezy
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
wait
till
I
tell
you
,
he
said
.
Delahunt
of
Camden
street
had
the
*NL*
catering
and
yours
truly
was
chief
bottlewasher
.
Bloom
and
the
wife
were
*NL*
there
.
Lashings
of
stuff
we
put
up
:
port
wine
and
sherry
and
curacao
to
*NL*
which
we
did
ample
justice
.
Fast
and
furious
it
was
.
After
liquids
came
*NL*
solids
.
Cold
joints
galore
and
mince
pies
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
,
M'Coy
said
.
The
year
the
missus
was
there
...
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
linked
his
arm
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
wait
till
I
tell
you
,
he
said
.
We
had
a
midnight
lunch
too
after
*NL*
all
the
jollification
and
when
we
sallied
forth
it
was
blue
o'clock
the
*NL*
morning
after
the
night
before
.
Coming
home
it
was
a
gorgeous
winter
's
*NL*
night
on
the
Featherbed
Mountain
.
Bloom
and
Chris
Callinan
were
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
car
and
I
was
with
the
wife
on
the
other
.
We
started
singing
*NL*
glees
and
duets
:
_
Lo
,
the
early
beam
of
morning
_
.
She
was
well
primed
*NL*
with
a
good
load
of
Delahunt
's
port
under
her
bellyband
.
Every
jolt
the
*NL*
bloody
car
gave
I
had
her
bumping
up
against
me
.
Hell
's
delights
!
She
*NL*
has
a
fine
pair
,
God
bless
her
.
Like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
his
caved
hands
a
cubit
from
him
,
frowning
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
tucking
the
rug
under
her
and
settling
her
boa
all
the
time
.
*NL*
Know
what
I
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
hands
moulded
ample
curves
of
air
.
He
shut
his
eyes
tight
in
*NL*
delight
,
his
body
shrinking
,
and
blew
a
sweet
chirp
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
lad
stood
to
attention
anyhow
,
he
said
with
a
sigh
.
She
's
a
gamey
*NL*
mare
and
no
mistake
.
Bloom
was
pointing
out
all
the
stars
and
the
comets
*NL*
in
the
heavens
to
Chris
Callinan
and
the
jarvey
:
the
great
bear
and
*NL*
Hercules
and
the
dragon
,
and
the
whole
jingbang
lot
.
But
,
by
God
,
I
was
*NL*
lost
,
so
to
speak
,
in
the
milky
way
.
He
knows
them
all
,
faith
.
At
last
*NL*
she
spotted
a
weeny
weeshy
one
miles
away
.
_
And
what
star
is
that
,
*NL*
Poldy
?
_
says
she
.
By
God
,
she
had
Bloom
cornered
.
_
That
one
,
is
it
?
_
*NL*
says
Chris
Callinan
,
_
sure
that
's
only
what
you
might
call
a
pinprick
.
_
*NL*
By
God
,
he
was
n't
far
wide
of
the
mark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lenehan
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
riverwall
,
panting
with
soft
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
weak
,
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
M'Coy
's
white
face
smiled
about
it
at
instants
and
grew
grave
.
Lenehan
*NL*
walked
on
again
.
He
lifted
his
yachtingcap
and
scratched
his
hindhead
*NL*
rapidly
.
He
glanced
sideways
in
the
sunlight
at
M'Coy
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
a
cultured
allroundman
,
Bloom
is
,
he
said
seriously
.
He
's
not
one
*NL*
of
your
common
or
garden
...
you
know
...
There
's
a
touch
of
the
artist
*NL*
about
old
Bloom
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
turned
over
idly
pages

Lots
of

this

He
laid
both

aside
and
glanced
at
the
third
:

*NL*
*NL*

he
said
,
pushing
it
by

*NL*
*NL*
The
shopman
let
two
volumes
fall
on
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Them
are
two
good
ones
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Onions
of
his
breath
came
across
the
counter
out
of
his
ruined
mouth
.
*NL*
He
bent
to
make
a
bundle
of
the
other
books
,
hugged
them
against
his
*NL*
unbuttoned
waistcoat
and
bore
them
off
behind
the
dingy
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
O'Connell
bridge
many
persons
observed
the
grave
deportment
and
gay

apparel
of
Mr
Denis
J
Maginni
,
professor
of

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

alone

looked
at

the

He
opened

Thought

*NL*
*NL*
A

behind

Listen

*NL*
*NL*
No

He
read
the

Let

*NL*
*NL*
He
read
where
his
finger
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
All
the
dollarbills
her
husband
gave
her
were
spent
in
the

wondrous

Her

glued
on

in
a
luscious
voluptuous

while
his

*NL*
felt
for

_
*NL*
*NL*
Yes

Take

The

*NL*
*NL*

You

he
spoke
hoarsely
,
eying
her
with
a
suspicious
glare
.
*NL*
The
beautiful
woman
threw
off
her
sabletrimmed
wrap
,
displaying
her
*NL*
queenly
shoulders
and
heaving
embonpoint

An
imperceptible

played
*NL*
round
her
perfect
lips
as
she
turned
to
him
calmly

Mr

An

left

Phlegmy

shook
the
air
of
the

bulging
out
the

curtains

The
shopman
's
uncombed
grey
head
came
out
and
his
unshaven
*NL*
reddened
face
,
coughing
.
He
raked
his
throat
rudely
,
puked
phlegm
on
the
*NL*
floor

He
put
his
boot
on
what
he
had
spat
,
wiping
his

along
it

*NL*
and
bent
,
showing
a

scantily

*NL*
*NL*
Mr

beheld
it

*NL*
*NL*
Mastering
his

he
said
:

The

lifted

bleared

The
lacquey
by
the

Dillon

shook
his

*NL*
twice
again
and
viewed
himself
in
the
chalked
mirror
of

*NL*
*NL*
Dilly
Dedalus
,
loitering
by

heard
the
beats
of
the

bell
,
the

the

within

Four

Those

*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
,
tugging
a
long
moustache
,
came
round
from
Williams
's
row
.
He
*NL*
halted
near
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stand
up

Mr

said

*NL*
Are

the

,
head

?
Melancholy
God
!
*NL*
*NL*
Dilly
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
Mr
Dedalus
placed
his
hands
on
them
and
*NL*
held
them
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stand
up
straight
,
girl
,
he
said
.
You
'll
get
curvature
of
the
spine
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
what
you
look
like
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
his
head
sink
suddenly
down
and
forward
,
hunching
his
shoulders
*NL*
and
dropping
his
underjaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
it
up
,

,
Dilly
said
.
All
the
people
are
looking
at

*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
drew
himself
upright
and
tugged
again
at
his
moustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
get
any
money
?
Dilly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
would
I
get
money
?
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
There
is
no-one
in
Dublin
*NL*
would
lend
me
fourpence
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
got
some
,
Dilly
said
,
looking
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
do
you
know
that
?
Mr
Dedalus
asked
,
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Kernan
,
pleased
with
the
order
he
had
booked
,
walked
boldly
along
*NL*
James
's
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
you
did
,
Dilly
answered
.
Were
you
in
the
Scotch
house
now
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
was
not
,
then
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
smiling
.
Was
it
the
little
nuns
*NL*
taught
you
to
be
so
saucy
?
Here
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
her
a
shilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
See
if
you
can
do
anything
with
that
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
suppose
you
got
five
,
Dilly
said
.
Give
me
more
than
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wait
awhile
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
threateningly
.
You
're
like
the
rest
of
*NL*
them
,
are
you
?
An
insolent
pack
of
little
bitches
since
your
poor
mother
*NL*
died
.
But
wait
awhile
.
You
'll
all
get
a
short
shrift
and
a
long
day
from
*NL*
me
.
Low
blackguardism
!
I
'm
going
to

Would
n't
care

I
*NL*
was
stretched
out
stiff
.
He
's
dead

The
man
upstairs

*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
and
walked
on
.
Dilly
followed
quickly
and
pulled
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
what
is
it
?
he
said
,
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lacquey
rang
his
bell
behind
their
backs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Barang
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Curse
your
bloody
blatant
soul
,
Mr
Dedalus
cried
,
turning
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lacquey
,
aware
of
comment
,
shook
the
lolling
clapper
of
his
bell
but
*NL*
feebly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bang
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
stared
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Watch
him
,
he
said
.
It
's
instructive
.
I
wonder
will
he
allow
us
to
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
got
more
than
that
,
father
,
Dilly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
going
to
show
you
a
little
trick
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
.
I
'll
leave
*NL*
you
all
where
Jesus
left
the
jews
.
Look
,
there
's
all
I
have
.
I
got
*NL*
two
shillings
from
Jack
Power
and
I
spent
twopence
for
a
shave
for
the
*NL*
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
forth
a
handful
of
copper
coins
,
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ca
n't
you
look
for
some
money
somewhere
?
Dilly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
thought
and
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
,
he
said
gravely
.
I
looked
all
along
the
gutter
in
O'Connell
*NL*
street
.
I
'll
try
this
one
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
very
funny
,
Dilly
said
,
grinning
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
handing
her
two
pennies
.
Get
a
glass
of
milk
*NL*
for
yourself
and
a
bun
or
a
something
.
I
'll
be
home
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
other
coins
in
his
pocket
and
started
to
walk
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
viceregal
cavalcade
passed
,
greeted
by
obsequious
policemen
,
out
of
*NL*
Parkgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
sure
you
have
another
shilling
,
Dilly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lacquey
banged
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
amid
the
din
walked
off
,
murmuring
to
himself
with
a
pursing
*NL*
mincing
mouth
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
little
nuns
!
Nice
little
things
!
O
,
sure
they
would
n't
do
*NL*
anything

O

sure
they
would
n't
really
!
Is
it
little
sister
Monica

*NL*
*NL*
From
the
sundial
towards
James
's
gate
walked
Mr
Kernan
,
pleased
with
the
*NL*
order
he
had
booked
for
Pulbrook
Robertson
,
boldly
along
James
's
street
,
*NL*
past
Shackleton
's
offices
.
Got
round
him
all
right
.
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
*NL*
Crimmins
?
First
rate
,
sir
.
I
was
afraid
you
might
be
up
in
your
other
*NL*
establishment
in
Pimlico
.
How
are
things
going
?
Just
keeping
alive
.
*NL*
Lovely
weather
we
're
having
.
Yes
,
indeed
.
Good
for
the
country
.
Those
*NL*
farmers
are
always
grumbling
.
I
'll
just
take
a
thimbleful
of
your
best
*NL*
gin
,
Mr
Crimmins
.
A
small
gin
,
sir
.
Yes
,
sir
.
Terrible
affair
that
*NL*
General
Slocum
explosion
.
Terrible
,
terrible
!
A
thousand
casualties
.
And
*NL*
heartrending
scenes
.
Men
trampling
down
women
and
children
.
Most
brutal
*NL*
thing
.
What
do
they
say
was
the
cause
?
Spontaneous
combustion
.
Most
*NL*
scandalous
revelation
.
Not
a
single
lifeboat
would
float
and
the
*NL*
firehose
all
burst
.
What
I
ca
n't
understand
is
how
the
inspectors
ever
*NL*
allowed
a
boat
like
that
...
Now
,
you
're
talking
straight
,
Mr
Crimmins
.
*NL*
You
know
why
?
Palm
oil
.
Is
that
a
fact
?
Without
a
doubt
.
Well
now
,
look
*NL*
at
that
.
And
America
they
say
is
the
land
of
the
free
.
I
thought
we
were
*NL*
bad
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
smiled
at
him
.
_
America
,
_
I
said
quietly
,
just
like
that
.
_
What
is
*NL*
it
?
The
sweepings
of
every
country
including
our
own
.
Is
n't
that
true
?
_
*NL*
That
's
a
fact

*NL*
*NL*
Graft
,
my
dear

Well
,
of

,
where
there
's
money
going
there
's
*NL*
always
someone
to
pick
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saw
him
looking
at

Dress
does
it

Mr

himself

Well

I
gave
Neary
for
it
.
Never

*NL*
under

Fits

down

Some

John
Mulligan
,
the

of
the
Hibernian

gave
me
a
very
sharp
eye
yesterday
on
Carlisle
bridge
as
if
he
*NL*
remembered
me

*NL*
*NL*
Aham

Must

And
now
,
Mr
Crimmins

may
we
have
the
honour
of
your

*NL*

The

Grizzled

Returned

Bravely
he
bore

Is

Ned

Yes

He

Damn

*NL*
Aham

Hot
spirit
of
juniper
juice
warmed
his
vitals
and
his
breath
.
Good
*NL*
drop
of
gin
,
that
was
.
His
frocktails
winked
in
bright
sunshine
to
his
*NL*
fat
strut

*NL*
Down

Corpse

In

barricaded

prowling

asked

Simon

Father

answered

Reuben
of
that
ilk

I
'm
just
*NL*
waiting
for
Ben
Dollard

He
's
going
to
say
a

long
John
to
get
*NL*
him
to
take
those
two
men
off
.
All
I
want
is
a
little
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
with
vague
hope
up
and
down
the
quay
,
a
big
apple
bulging
in
*NL*
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know

Mr
Dedalus
said
,
nodding
.
Poor
old
bockedy
Ben
!
He
's
always
*NL*
doing
a
good
turn
for
someone
.
Hold
hard
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
on
his
glasses
and
gazed
towards
the
metal
bridge
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
he
is
,
by
God
,
he
said
,
arse
and
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Dollard
's
loose
blue
cutaway
and
square
hat
above
large
slops
*NL*
crossed
the
quay
in
full
gait
from
the
metal
bridge
.
He
came
towards
*NL*
them
at
an
amble
,
scratching
actively
behind
his
coattails
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
came
near
Mr
Dedalus
greeted
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hold
that
fellow
with
the
bad
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hold
him
now
,
Ben
Dollard
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dedalus
eyed
with
cold
wandering
scorn
various
points
of
Ben
*NL*
Dollard
's
figure
.
Then
,
turning
to
Father
Cowley
with
a
nod
,
he
muttered
*NL*
sneeringly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
pretty
garment
,
is
n't
it
,
for
a
summer
's
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
God
eternally
curse
your
soul
,
Ben
Dollard
growled
furiously
,
I
*NL*
threw
out
more
clothes
in
my
time
than
you
ever
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
beside
them
beaming
,
on
them
first
and
on
his
roomy
clothes
*NL*
from
points
of
which
Mr
Dedalus
flicked
fluff
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
were
made
for
a
man
in
his
health
,
Ben
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bad
luck
to
the
jewman
that
made
them
,
Ben
Dollard
said
.
Thanks
be
to
*NL*
God

's
not
paid
yet

Ben
Dollard
frowned
and
,
making
suddenly
a
chanter
's
mouth
,
gave
forth
a
*NL*
deep
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aw
!
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
the
style
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
nodding
to
its
drone
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
about
that
?
Ben
Dollard
said
.
Not
too
dusty
?
What
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
'll
do
,
Father
Cowley
said
,
nodding
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reverend
Hugh
C.
Love
walked
from
the
old
chapterhouse
of
saint
*NL*
Mary
's
abbey
past
James
and
Charles
Kennedy
's
,
rectifiers
,
attended
by
*NL*
Geraldines
tall
and
personable
,
towards
the
Tholsel
beyond
the
ford
of
*NL*
hurdles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Dollard
with
a
heavy
list
towards
the
shopfronts
led
them
forward
,
*NL*
his
joyful
fingers
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
along
with
me
to
the
subsheriff
's
office
,
he
said
.
I
want
to
*NL*
show
you
the
new
beauty
Rock
has
for
a
bailiff
.
He
's
a
cross
between
*NL*
Lobengula
and
Lynchehaun
.
He
's
well
worth
seeing
,
mind
you
.
Come
along
.
*NL*
I
saw
John
Henry
Menton
casually
in
the
Bodega
just
now
and
it
will
cost
*NL*
me
a
fall
if
I
do
n't
...
Wait
awhile
...
We
're
on
the
right
lay
,
Bob
,
*NL*
believe
you
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
a
few
days
tell
him
,
Father
Cowley
said
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Dollard
halted
and
stared
,
his
loud
orifice
open
,
a
dangling
button
*NL*
of
his
coat
wagging
brightbacked
from
its
thread
as
he
wiped
away
the
*NL*
heavy
shraums
that
clogged
his
eyes
to
hear
aright
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
few
days
?
he
boomed
.
Has
n't
your
landlord
distrained
for
rent
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
has
,
Father
Cowley
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
our
friend
's
writ
is
not
worth
the
paper
it
's
printed
on
,
Ben
*NL*
Dollard
said
.
The
landlord
has
the
prior
claim
.
I
gave
him
all
the
*NL*
particulars
.
29
Windsor
avenue
.
Love
is
the
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
right
,
Father
Cowley
said
.
The
reverend
Mr
Love
.
He
's
a
*NL*
minister
in
the
country
somewhere
.
But
are
you
sure
of
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
can
tell
Barabbas
from
me
,
Ben
Dollard
said
,
that
he
can
put
that
*NL*
writ
where
Jacko
put
the
nuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
Father
Cowley
boldly
forward
,
linked
to
his
bulk
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Filberts
I
believe
they
were
,
Mr
Dedalus
said
,
as
he
dropped
his
*NL*
glasses
on
his
coatfront
,
following
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
youngster
will
be
all
right
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
as
they
*NL*
passed
out
of
the
Castleyard
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policeman
touched
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
bless
you
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
cheerily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
signed
to
the
waiting
jarvey
who
chucked
at
the
reins
and
set
on
*NL*
towards
Lord
Edward
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bronze

Miss
Kennedy

Miss
Douce

appeared
above
*NL*
the
crossblind
of
the
Ormond
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
fingering
his
beard
.
I
wrote
to
Father
*NL*
Conmee
and
laid
the
whole
case
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
could
try
our
friend
,
Mr
Power
suggested
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Boyd
?
Martin
Cunningham
said
shortly
.
Touch
me
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Wyse
Nolan
,
lagging
behind
,
reading
the
list
,
came
after
them
*NL*
quickly
down
Cork
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
steps
of
the
City
hall
Councillor
Nannetti
,
descending
,
hailed
*NL*
Alderman
Cowley
and
Councillor
Abraham
Lyon
ascending
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
castle
car
wheeled
empty
into
upper
Exchange
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Look
here
,
Martin
,
John
Wyse
Nolan
said
,
overtaking
them
at
the
_
Mail
_
*NL*
office
.
I
see
Bloom
put
his
name
down
for
five
shillings
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quite
right
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
taking
the
list
.
And
put
down
the
*NL*
five
shillings
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Without
a
second
word
either
,
Mr
Power
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Strange
but
true
,
Martin
Cunningham
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Wyse
Nolan
opened
wide
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
say
there
is
much
kindness
in
the
jew
,
he
quoted
,
elegantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
Parliament
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
Jimmy
Henry
,
Mr
Power
said
,
just
heading
for
Kavanagh
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Righto
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
Here
goes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
_
la
Maison
Claire
_
Blazes
Boylan
waylaid
Jack
Mooney
's
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
humpy
,
tight
,
making
for
the
liberties
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Wyse
Nolan
fell
back
with
Mr
Power
,
while
Martin
Cunningham
took
*NL*
the
elbow
of
a
dapper
little
man
in
a
shower
of
hail
suit
,
who
walked
*NL*
uncertainly
,
with
hasty
steps
past
Micky
Anderson
's
watches
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
assistant
town
clerk
's
corns
are
giving
him
some
trouble
,
John
*NL*
Wyse
Nolan
told
Mr
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
followed
round
the
corner
towards
James
Kavanagh
's
winerooms
.
The
*NL*
empty
castle
car
fronted
them
at
rest
in
Essex
gate
.
Martin
Cunningham
,
*NL*
speaking
always
,
showed
often
the
list
at
which
Jimmy
Henry
did
not
*NL*
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
long
John
Fanning
is
here
too
,
John
Wyse
Nolan
said
,
as
large
as
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
form
of
long
John
Fanning
filled
the
doorway
where
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
day
,
Mr
Subsheriff
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
,
as
all
halted
and
*NL*
greeted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
Fanning
made
no
way
for
them
.
He
removed
his
large
Henry
Clay
*NL*
decisively
and
his
large
fierce
eyes
scowled
intelligently
over
all
*NL*
their
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
the
conscript
fathers
pursuing
their
peaceful
deliberations
?
he
*NL*
said
with
rich
acrid
utterance
to
the
assistant
town
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hell
open
to
christians
they
were
having
,
Jimmy
Henry
said
pettishly
,
*NL*
about
their
damned
Irish
language
.
Where
was
the
marshal
,
he
wanted
*NL*
to
know
,
to
keep
order
in
the
council
chamber
.
And
old
Barlow
the
*NL*
macebearer
laid
up
with
asthma
,
no
mace
on
the
table
,
nothing
in
order
,
*NL*
no
quorum
even
,
and
Hutchinson
,
the
lord
mayor
,
in
Llandudno
and
little
*NL*
Lorcan
Sherlock
doing
_
locum
tenens
_
for
him
.
Damned
Irish
language
,
*NL*
language
of
our
forefathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
Fanning
blew
a
plume
of
smoke
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
spoke
by
turns
,
twirling
the
peak
of
his
beard
,
to
the
*NL*
assistant
town
clerk
and
the
subsheriff
,
while
John
Wyse
Nolan
held
his
*NL*
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
Dignam
was
that
?
long
John
Fanning
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmy
Henry
made
a
grimace
and
lifted
his
left
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
my
corns
!
he
said
plaintively
.
Come
upstairs
for
goodness
'
sake
*NL*
till
I
sit
down
somewhere
.
Uff
!
Ooo
!
Mind
!
*NL*
*NL*
Testily
he
made
room
for
himself
beside
long
John
Fanning
's
flank
and
*NL*
passed
in
and
up
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
on
up
,
Martin
Cunningham
said
to
the
subsheriff
.
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
you
knew
him
or
perhaps
you
did
,
though
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
John
Wyse
Nolan
Mr
Power
followed
them
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Decent
little
soul
he
was
,
Mr
Power
said
to
the
stalwart
back
of
long
*NL*
John
Fanning
ascending
towards
long
John
Fanning
in
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Rather
lowsized
.
Dignam
of
Menton
's
office
that
was
,
Martin
Cunningham
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
Fanning
could
not
remember
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clatter
of
horsehoofs
sounded
from
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
that
?
Martin
Cunningham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
turned
where
they
stood
.
John
Wyse
Nolan
came
down
again
.
From
the
*NL*
cool
shadow
of
the
doorway
he
saw
the
horses
pass
Parliament
street
,
*NL*
harness
and
glossy
pasterns
in
sunlight
shimmering
.
Gaily
they
went
past
*NL*
before
his
cool
unfriendly
eyes
,
not
quickly
.
In
saddles
of
the
leaders
,
*NL*
leaping
leaders
,
rode
outriders
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
was
it
?
Martin
Cunningham
asked
,
as
they
went
on
up
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
lord
lieutenantgeneral
and
general
governor
of
Ireland
,
John
Wyse
*NL*
Nolan
answered
from
the
stairfoot
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
trod
across
the
thick
carpet
Buck
Mulligan
whispered
behind
his
*NL*
Panama
to
Haines
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Parnell
's
brother
.
There
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
chose
a
small
table
near
the
window
,
opposite
a
longfaced
man
whose
*NL*
beard
and
gaze
hung
intently
down
on
a
chessboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
he
?
Haines
asked
,
twisting
round
in
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Mulligan
said
.
That
's
John
Howard
,
his
brother
,
our
city
marshal
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Howard
Parnell
translated
a
white
bishop
quietly
and
his
grey
claw
*NL*
went
up
again
to
his
forehead
whereat
it
rested
.
An
instant
after
,
under
*NL*
its
screen
,
his
eyes
looked
quickly
,
ghostbright
,
at
his
foe
and
fell
*NL*
once
more
upon
a
working
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
take
a
_
melange
,
_
Haines
said
to
the
waitress
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Two
_
melanges
,
_
Buck
Mulligan
said
.
And
bring
us
some
scones
and
*NL*
butter
and
some
cakes
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
gone
he
said
,
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
call
it
D.B.C.
because
they
have
damn
bad
cakes
.
O
,
but
you
missed
*NL*
Dedalus
on
_
Hamlet
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Haines
opened
his
newbought
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
sorry
,
he
said
.
Shakespeare
is
the
happy
huntingground
of
all
*NL*
minds
that
have
lost
their
balance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
onelegged
sailor
growled
at
the
area
of
14
Nelson
street
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
England
expects
_
...
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
's
primrose
waistcoat
shook
gaily
to
his
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
should
see
him
,
he
said
,
when
his
body
loses
its
balance
.
*NL*
Wandering
Aengus
I
call
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
sure
he
has
an
_
idee
fixe
,
_
Haines
said
,
pinching
his
chin
*NL*
thoughtfully
with
thumb
and
forefinger
.
Now
I
am
speculating
what
it
*NL*
would
be
likely
to
be
.
Such
persons
always
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
bent
across
the
table
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
drove
his
wits
astray
,
he
said
,
by
visions
of
hell
.
He
will
never
*NL*
capture
the
Attic
note
.
The
note
of
Swinburne
,
of
all
poets
,
the
white
*NL*
death
and
the
ruddy
birth
.
That
is
his
tragedy
.
He
can
never
be
a
poet
.
*NL*
The
joy
of
creation
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Eternal
punishment
,
Haines
said
,
nodding
curtly
.
I
see
.
I
tackled
him
*NL*
this
morning
on
belief
.
There
was
something
on
his
mind
,
I
saw
.
*NL*
It
's
rather
interesting
because
professor
Pokorny
of
Vienna
makes
an
*NL*
interesting
point
out
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
's
watchful
eyes
saw
the
waitress
come
.
He
helped
her
to
*NL*
unload
her
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
can
find
no
trace
of
hell
in
ancient
Irish
myth
,
Haines
said
,
amid
*NL*
the
cheerful
cups
.
The
moral
idea
seems
lacking
,
the
sense
of
destiny
,
*NL*
of
retribution
.
Rather
strange
he
should
have
just
that
fixed
idea
.
Does
*NL*
he
write
anything
for
your
movement
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
two
lumps
of
sugar
deftly
longwise
through
the
whipped
cream
.
*NL*
Buck
Mulligan
slit
a
steaming
scone
in
two
and
plastered
butter
over
its
*NL*
smoking
pith
.
He
bit
off
a
soft
piece
hungrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ten
years
,
he
said
,
chewing
and
laughing
.
He
is
going
to
write
*NL*
something
in
ten
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Seems
a
long
way
off
,
Haines
said
,
thoughtfully
lifting
his
spoon
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
did
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tasted
a
spoonful
from
the
creamy
cone
of
his
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
is
real
Irish
cream
I
take
it
,
he
said
with
forbearance
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
be
imposed
on
.

Elijah

*NL*
Behind

Cashel

Tisdall
Farrell
,
with

shunned
the

before
Mr

Smith

house
and
,
crossing
,
walked
along
Merrion
square
.
Distantly
behind
him
a
*NL*
blind
stripling
tapped
his
way
by
the
wall
of
College
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cashel

walked

then
turned

strode
back
along

Merrion

,
his
stickumbrelladustcoat
dangling
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
Wilde

he
halted
,
frowned
at
Elijah

name
*NL*
announced
on
the
Metropolitan

,
frowned
at
the
distant
pleasance
of

His

flashed
frowning
in

With
ratsteeth
*NL*
bared
he
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Coactus

*NL*
*NL*
He
strode
on
for
Clare
street
,
grinding
his
fierce
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
strode
past
Mr
Bloom
's
dental
windows
the
sway
of
his
dustcoat
*NL*
brushed
rudely
from
its
angle
a
slender
tapping
cane
and
swept
onwards
,
*NL*
having
buffeted
a
thewless
body
.
The
blind
stripling
turned
his
sickly
*NL*
face
after
the
striding
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
's
curse
on
you
,
he
said
sourly
,
whoever
you

You

Opposite

Dignam
,
pawing
the

a

porksteaks
he
had
been
*NL*
sent
for
,
went
along
warm
Wicklow
street
dawdling
.
It
was
too
blooming
*NL*
dull
sitting
in
the
parlour
with
Mrs
Stoer
and
Mrs
Quigley
and
Mrs
*NL*
MacDowell
and
the
blind
down
and
they
all
at
their
sniffles
and
sipping
*NL*
sups
of
the
superior
tawny
sherry
uncle
Barney
brought
from
Tunney
's
.
*NL*
And
they
eating
crumbs
of
the
cottage
fruitcake
,
jawing
the
whole
*NL*
blooming
time
and
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Wicklow
lane
the
window
of
Madame
Doyle
,
courtdress
milliner
,
*NL*
stopped
him
.
He
stood
looking
in
at
the
two
puckers
stripped
to
their
*NL*
pelts
and
putting
up
their
props
.
From
the
sidemirrors
two
mourning
*NL*
Masters
Dignam
gaped
silently
.
Myler

the
Portobello

sparring
out

I
could
easy
do
a

on

.
Master
*NL*
Dignam
on
his
left
turned
as
he
turned
.
That
's
me
in
mourning
.
When
*NL*
is
it
?
May
the
twentysecond
.
Sure
,
the
blooming
thing
is
all
over
.
He
*NL*
turned
to
the
right
and
on
his
right
Master
Dignam
turned
,
his
cap
awry
,
*NL*
his
collar
sticking
up
.
Buttoning
it
down
,
his
chin
lifted
,
he
saw
the
*NL*
image
of
Marie
Kendall
,
charming
soubrette
,
beside
the
two
puckers
.
One
*NL*
of
them
mots
that
do
be
in
the
packets
of
fags
Stoer
smokes
that
his
old
*NL*
fellow
welted
hell
out
of
him
for
one
time
he
found
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Dignam
got
his
collar
down
and
dawdled
on
.
The
best
pucker
going
*NL*
for
strength
was
Fitzsimons
.
One
puck
in
the
wind
from
that
fellow
would
*NL*
knock
you
into
the
middle
of
next
week
,
man
.
But
the
best
pucker
for
*NL*
science
was
Jem
Corbet
before
Fitzsimons
knocked
the
stuffings
out
of
*NL*
him
,
dodging
and
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Grafton
street
Master
Dignam
saw
a
red
flower
in
a
toff
's
mouth
and
*NL*
a
swell
pair
of
kicks
on
him
and
he
listening
to
what
the
drunk
was
*NL*
telling
him
and
grinning
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
Sandymount
tram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Dignam
walked
along
Nassau
street
,
shifted
the
porksteaks
to
*NL*
his
other
hand
.
His
collar
sprang
up
again
and
he
tugged
it
down
.
The
*NL*
blooming
stud
was
too
small
for
the
buttonhole
of
the
shirt
,
blooming
*NL*
end
to
it
.
He
met
schoolboys
with
satchels
.
I
'm
not
going
tomorrow
*NL*
either
,
stay
away
till
Monday
.
He
met
other
schoolboys
.
Do
they
notice
*NL*
I
'm
in
mourning
?
Uncle
Barney
said
he
'd
get
it
into
the
paper
tonight
.
*NL*
Then
they
'll
all
see
it
in
the
paper
and
read
my
name
printed
and
pa
's
*NL*
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
got
all
grey
instead
of
being
red
like
it
was
and
there
was
a
*NL*
fly
walking
over
it
up
to
his
eye
.
The
scrunch
that
was
when
they
*NL*
were
screwing
the
screws
into
the
coffin
:
and
the
bumps
when
they
were
*NL*
bringing
it
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pa
was
inside
it
and
ma
crying
in
the
parlour
and
uncle
Barney
telling
*NL*
the
men
how
to
get
it
round
the
bend
.
A
big
coffin
it
was
,
and
high
and
*NL*
heavylooking
.
How
was
that
?
The
last
night
pa
was
boosed
he
was
standing
*NL*
on
the
landing
there
bawling
out
for
his
boots
to
go
out
to
Tunney
's
for
*NL*
to
boose
more
and
he
looked
butty
and
short
in
his
shirt
.
Never
see
him
*NL*
again
.
Death
,
that
is
.
Pa
is
dead
.
My
father
is
dead
.
He
told
me
to
be
*NL*
a
good
son
to
ma
.
I
could
n't
hear
the
other
things
he
said
but
I
saw
*NL*
his
tongue
and
his
teeth
trying
to
say
it
better
.
Poor
pa
.
That
was
*NL*
Mr
Dignam
,
my
father
.
I
hope
he
's
in
purgatory
now
because
he
went
to
*NL*
confession
to
Father
Conroy
on

The

cordially
greeted
on

At

at

stroking
his

with

his

,
undecided
whether

should
arrive
at

*NL*
more
quickly
by

of

a

an

her

smiled
credulously
*NL*
on

From

From

knew
by

*NL*
it
was
the
lord
and
lady
lieutenant
but
she
could
n't
see
what
Her

Well

With

she
tapped
a

Forth

Mr

He
blew
through

two

*NL*
*NL*
--
By
Jove

he
mused
,
I
often

Must

*NL*
No

To

She
took

while

read
by

a

for

,
plappering
flatly
:
*NL*
*NL*

Ah

He

He

I

Have

*NL*
He

After

I

Mr

said

*NL*
*NL*
He

From

at

corner

there
and
be
damned
but
a
bloody
sweep
came
along
*NL*
and
he
near
drove
his
gear
into
my
eye
.
I
turned
around
to
let
him
have
*NL*
the
weight
of
my
tongue
when
who
should
I
see
dodging
along
Stony

*NL*
only
Joe

*NL*
*NL*

Lo

Joe

How

Did
you
see

near
shove
my

out

*NL*

Who

you
were
talking

?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Old
Troy
,
says
I
,
was
in

force

I
'm
on
two
minds
not
to
give
that
*NL*
fellow
in

for
obstructing
the
thoroughfare
with
his
brooms

There
's
a
bloody
big
foxy
thief
beyond

at

about

A

I

And
there

is
seen
*NL*
by
mariners

traverse
the

and
culls
and
sowpigs
and
baconhogs
and
the
*NL*
various
different
varieties
of
highly
distinguished
swine
and
Angus
*NL*
heifers
and
polly
bulllocks
of
immaculate
pedigree
together
with
prime
*NL*
premiated
milchcows
and
beeves
:
and
there
is
ever
heard
a
trampling
,
*NL*
cackling
,
roaring
,
lowing
,
bleating
,
bellowing
,
rumbling
,
grunting
,
*NL*
champing
,
chewing
,
of
sheep
and
pigs
and
heavyhooved
kine
from
*NL*
pasturelands
of
Lusk
and
Rush
and
Carrickmines
and
from
the
streamy
*NL*
vales
of
Thomond
,
from
the
M'Gillicuddy
's
reeks
the
inaccessible
and
*NL*
lordly
Shannon
the
unfathomable
,
and
from
the
gentle
declivities
of
the
*NL*
place
of
the
race
of
Kiar
,
their
udders
distended
with
superabundance
of
*NL*
milk
and
butts
of
butter
and
rennets
of
cheese
and
farmer
's
firkins
and
*NL*
targets
of
lamb
and
crannocks
of
corn
and
oblong
eggs
in
great
hundreds
,
*NL*
various
in
size
,
the
agate
with
this
dun
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
turned
into
Barney
Kiernan
's
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
was
the
*NL*
citizen
up
in
the
corner
having
a
great
confab
with
himself
and
that
*NL*
bloody
mangy
mongrel
,
Garryowen
,
and
he
waiting
for
what
the
sky
would
*NL*
drop
in
the
way
of
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
he
is
,
says
I
,
in
his
gloryhole
,
with
his
cruiskeen
lawn
and
his
*NL*
load
of
papers
,
working
for
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bloody
mongrel
let
a
grouse
out
of
him
would
give
you
the
creeps
.
Be
*NL*
a
corporal
work
of
mercy
if
someone
would
take
the
life
of
that
bloody
*NL*
dog
.
I
'm
told
for
a
fact
he
ate
a
good
part
of
the
breeches
off
a
*NL*
constabulary
man
in
Santry
that
came
round
one
time
with
a
blue
paper
*NL*
about
a
licence
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stand
and
deliver
,
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
all
right
,
citizen
,
says
Joe
.
Friends
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pass
,
friends
,
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
rubs
his
hand
in
his
eye
and
says
he
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
your
opinion
of
the
times
?
*NL*
*NL*
Doing
the
rapparee
and
Rory
of
the
hill
.
But
,
begob
,
Joe
was
equal
to
*NL*
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
the
markets
are
on
a
rise
,
says
he
,
sliding
his
hand
down
his
*NL*
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
begob
the
citizen
claps
his
paw
on
his
knee
and
he
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Foreign
wars
is
the
cause
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
Joe
,
sticking
his
thumb
in
his
pocket
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
the
Russians
wish
to
tyrannise
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Arrah
,
give
over
your
bloody
codding
,
Joe
,
says
I.
I
've
a
thirst
on
me
*NL*
I
would
n't
sell
for
half
a
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
it
a
name
,
citizen
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wine
of
the
country
,
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
yours
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ditto
MacAnaspey
,
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Three
pints
,
Terry
,
says
Joe
.
And
how
's
the
old
heart
,
citizen
?
says
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Never
better
,
_
a
chara
_
,
says
he
.
What
Garry
?
Are
we
going
to
win
?
Eh
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
took
the
bloody
old
towser
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
*NL*
and
,
by
Jesus
,
he
near
throttled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
seated
on
a
large
boulder
at
the
foot
of
a
round
tower
was
*NL*
that
of
a
broadshouldered
deepchested
stronglimbed
frankeyed
redhaired
*NL*
freelyfreckled
shaggybearded
widemouthed
largenosed
longheaded
*NL*
deepvoiced
barekneed
brawnyhanded
hairylegged
ruddyfaced
sinewyarmed
*NL*
hero
.
From
shoulder
to
shoulder
he
measured
several
ells
and
his
*NL*
rocklike
mountainous
knees
were
covered
,
as
was
likewise
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
body
wherever
visible
,
with
a
strong
growth
of
tawny
prickly
hair
in
*NL*
hue
and
toughness
similar
to
the
mountain
gorse
-LRB-
_
Ulex
Europeus
_
-RRB-
.
*NL*
The
widewinged
nostrils
,
from
which
bristles
of
the
same
tawny
hue
*NL*
projected
,
were
of
such
capaciousness
that
within
their
cavernous
*NL*
obscurity
the
fieldlark
might
easily
have
lodged
her
nest
.
The
eyes
*NL*
in
which
a
tear
and
a
smile
strove
ever
for
the
mastery
were
of
the
*NL*
dimensions
of
a
goodsized
cauliflower
.
A
powerful
current
of
warm
breath
*NL*
issued
at
regular
intervals
from
the
profound
cavity
of
his
mouth
*NL*
while
in
rhythmic
resonance
the
loud
strong
hale
reverberations
of
his
*NL*
formidable
heart
thundered
rumblingly
causing
the
ground
,
the
summit
of
*NL*
the
lofty
tower
and
the
still
loftier
walls
of
the
cave
to
vibrate
and
*NL*
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wore
a
long
unsleeved
garment
of
recently
flayed
oxhide
reaching
*NL*
to
the
knees
in
a
loose
kilt
and
this
was
bound
about
his
middle
by
*NL*
a
girdle
of
plaited
straw
and
rushes
.
Beneath
this
he
wore
trews
of
*NL*
deerskin
,
roughly
stitched
with
gut
.
His
nether
extremities
were
encased
*NL*
in
high
Balbriggan
buskins
dyed
in
lichen
purple
,
the
feet
being
shod
*NL*
with
brogues
of
salted
cowhide
laced
with
the
windpipe
of
the
same
*NL*
beast
.
From
his
girdle
hung
a
row
of
seastones
which
jangled
at
every
*NL*
movement
of
his
portentous
frame
and
on
these
were
graven
with
rude
*NL*
yet
striking
art
the
tribal
images
of
many
Irish
heroes
and

A

acuminated
granite
rested
by
him
while
at
his
feet
reposed
a
savage
*NL*
animal
of
the
canine
tribe
whose
stertorous
gasps
announced
that
he
was
*NL*
sunk
in
uneasy
slumber
,
a
supposition
confirmed
by
hoarse
growls
and
*NL*
spasmodic
movements
which
his
master
repressed
from
time
to

*NL*
by
tranquilising
blows
of
a
mighty
cudgel
rudely
fashioned
out
of

*NL*
*NL*
So
anyhow
Terry
brought
the
three
pints
Joe
was
standing
and
begob
the

sight
nearly
left
my

when
I
saw
him
land
out

says

*NL*
*NL*

I
saw
him
before

met
you

says
I
,
sloping
around
by
Pill

*NL*
Greek
street
with
his
cod

counting
up
all
the
guts
of

*NL*

Ah

Do

I
was
blue
mouldy
for
the
want
of
that
pint

*NL*
Declare
to
God
I
could
hear
it
hit
the
pit
of
my
stomach
with
a
click
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
lo
,
as
they
quaffed
their
cup
of
joy
,
a
godlike
messenger
came
*NL*
swiftly
in
,
radiant
as
the
eye
of
heaven
,
a
comely
youth
and
behind
him
*NL*
there
passed
an
elder
of
noble
gait
and
countenance
,
bearing
the
sacred
*NL*
scrolls
of
law
and
with
him
his
lady
wife
a
dame
of
peerless
lineage
,
*NL*
fairest
of

.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Alf
Bergan
popped
in
round
the
door
and
hid
behind
Barney
's
*NL*
snug
,
squeezed
up
with
the
laughing
.
And
who
was
sitting
up
there
in
*NL*
the
corner
that
I
had
n't
seen
snoring
drunk
blind
to
the
world
only
Bob
*NL*
Doran
.
I
did
n't
know
what
was
up
and
Alf
kept
making
signs
out
of
the
*NL*
door
.
And
begob
what
was
it
only
that
bloody
old
pantaloon
Denis
Breen
*NL*
in
his
bathslippers
with
two
bloody
big
books
tucked
under
his
oxter
and
*NL*
the

hotfoot
after
him
,
unfortunate
wretched

,
trotting
like
a

.
I

Alf
would

*NL*

Look

Breen

He

The
bloody

began
to
growl
that

put
the
fear

He

he

then

sent
him

O

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
started
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
are
you
laughing
at
?
says
Bob
Doran
.
Is
that
Bergan
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hurry
up
,
Terry
boy
,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terence
O'Ryan
heard
him
and
straightway
brought
him
a
crystal
cup
*NL*
full
of
the
foamy
ebon
ale
which
the
noble
twin
brothers
Bungiveagh
and
*NL*
Bungardilaun
brew
ever
in
their
divine
alevats
,
cunning
as
the
sons
of
*NL*
deathless
Leda
.
For
they
garner
the
succulent
berries
of
the
hop
and
*NL*
mass
and
sift
and
bruise
and
brew
them
and
they
mix
therewith
sour
*NL*
juices
and
bring
the
must
to
the
sacred
fire
and
cease
not
night
or
day
*NL*
from
their
toil
,
those
cunning
brothers
,
lords
of
the
vat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
did
you
,
chivalrous
Terence
,
hand
forth
,
as
to
the
manner
born
,
*NL*
that
nectarous
beverage
and
you
offered
the
crystal
cup
to
him
that
*NL*
thirsted
,
the
soul
of
chivalry
,
in
beauty
akin
to
the
immortals
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
,
the
young
chief
of
the
O'Bergan
's
,
could
ill
brook
to
be
outdone
*NL*
in
generous
deeds
but
gave
therefor
with
gracious
gesture
a
testoon
of
*NL*
costliest
bronze
.
Thereon
embossed
in
excellent
smithwork
was
seen
*NL*
the
image
of
a
queen
of
regal
port
,
scion
of
the
house
of
Brunswick
,
*NL*
Victoria
her
name
,
Her
Most
Excellent
Majesty
,
by
grace
of
God
of
the
*NL*
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
and
of
the
British
dominions
*NL*
beyond
the
sea
,
queen
,
defender
of
the
faith
,
Empress
of
India
,
even
*NL*
she
,
who
bore
rule
,
a
victress
over
many
peoples
,
the
wellbeloved
,
for
*NL*
they
knew
and
loved
her
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
the
going
down
*NL*
thereof
,
the
pale
,
the
dark
,
the
ruddy
and
the
ethiop
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
that
bloody
freemason
doing
,
says
the
citizen
,
prowling
up
and
*NL*
down
outside
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
that
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
you
are
,
says
Alf
,
chucking
out
the
rhino
.
Talking
about
hanging
,
*NL*
I
'll
show
you
something
you
never
saw
.
Hangmen
's
letters
.
Look
at
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
took
a
bundle
of
wisps
of
letters
and
envelopes
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
codding
?
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Honest
injun
,
says
Alf
.
Read
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Joe
took
up
the
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
are
you
laughing
at
?
says
Bob
Doran
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
saw
there
was
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
dust
Bob
's
a
queer
chap
when
*NL*
the
porter
's
up
in
him
so
says
I
just
to
make
talk
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
's
Willy
Murray
those
times
,
Alf
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
do
n't
know
,
says
Alf
I
saw
him
just
now
in
Capel
street
with
Paddy
*NL*
Dignam
.
Only
I
was
running
after
that
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
what
?
says
Joe
,
throwing
down
the
letters
.
With
who
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
Dignam
,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
Paddy
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
says
Alf
.
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
n't
you
know
he
's
dead
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Paddy
Dignam
dead
!
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sure
I
'm
after
seeing
him
not
five
minutes
ago
,
says
Alf
,
as
plain
as
*NL*
a
pikestaff
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
's
dead
?
says
Bob
Doran
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
saw
his
ghost
then
,
says
Joe
,
God
between
us
and
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
says
Alf
.
Good
Christ
,
only
five
...
What
?
...
And
Willy
Murray
*NL*
with
him
,
the
two
of
them
there
near
whatdoyoucallhim
's
...
What
?
Dignam
*NL*
dead
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
about
Dignam
?
says
Bob
Doran
.
Who
's
talking
about
...
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dead
!
says
Alf
.
He
's
no
more
dead
than
you
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Maybe
so
,
says
Joe
.
They
took
the
liberty
of
burying
him
this
morning
*NL*
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Paddy
?
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
says
Joe
.
He
paid
the
debt
of
nature
,
God
be
merciful
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
Christ
!
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Begob
he
was
what
you
might
call
flabbergasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
spirit
hands
were
felt
to
flutter
and
when
prayer
by
*NL*
tantras
had
been
directed
to
the
proper
quarter
a
faint
but
increasing
*NL*
luminosity
of
ruby
light
became
gradually
visible
,
the
apparition
of
*NL*
the
etheric
double
being
particularly
lifelike
owing
to
the
discharge
*NL*
of
jivic
rays
from
the
crown
of
the
head
and
face
.
Communication
was
*NL*
effected
through
the
pituitary
body
and
also
by
means
of
the
orangefiery
*NL*
and
scarlet
rays
emanating
from
the
sacral
region
and
solar
plexus
.
*NL*
Questioned
by
his
earthname
as
to
his
whereabouts
in
the
heavenworld
he
*NL*
stated
that
he
was
now
on
the
path
of
pr
l
ya
or
return
but
was
still
*NL*
submitted
to
trial
at
the
hands
of
certain
bloodthirsty
entities
on
the
*NL*
lower
astral
levels
.
In
reply
to
a
question
as
to
his
first
sensations
*NL*
in
the
great
divide
beyond
he
stated
that
previously
he
had
seen
as
in
a
*NL*
glass
darkly
but
that
those
who
had
passed
over
had
summit
possibilities
*NL*
of
atmic
development
opened
up
to
them
.
Interrogated
as
to
whether
life
*NL*
there
resembled
our
experience
in
the
flesh
he
stated
that
he
had
heard
*NL*
from
more
favoured
beings
now
in
the
spirit
that
their
abodes
were
*NL*
equipped
with
every
modern
home
comfort
such
as
talafana
,
alavatar
,
*NL*
hatakalda
,
wataklasat
and
that
the
highest
adepts
were
steeped
in
*NL*
waves
of
volupcy
of
the
very
purest
nature
.
Having
requested
a
quart
of
*NL*
buttermilk
this
was
brought
and
evidently
afforded
relief
.
Asked
if
he
*NL*
had
any
message
for
the
living
he
exhorted
all
who
were
still
at
the
*NL*
wrong
side
of
Maya
to
acknowledge
the
true
path
for
it
was
reported
*NL*
in
devanic
circles
that
Mars
and
Jupiter
were
out
for
mischief
on
the
*NL*
eastern
angle
where
the
ram
has
power
.
It
was
then
queried
whether
there
*NL*
were
any
special
desires
on
the
part
of
the
defunct
and
the
reply
was
:
*NL*
_
We
greet
you
,
friends
of
earth
,
who
are
still
in
the
body
.
Mind
C.
K.
*NL*
does
n't
pile
it
on
.
_
It
was
ascertained
that
the
reference
was
to
Mr
*NL*
Cornelius
Kelleher
,
manager
of
Messrs
H.
J.
O'Neill
's
popular
*NL*
funeral
establishment
,
a
personal
friend
of
the
defunct
,
who
had
been
*NL*
responsible
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
interment
arrangements
.
Before
*NL*
departing
he
requested
that
it
should
be
told
to
his
dear
son
Patsy
that
*NL*
the
other
boot
which
he
had
been
looking
for
was
at
present
under
the
*NL*
commode
in
the
return
room
and
that
the
pair
should
be
sent
to
Cullen
's
*NL*
to
be
soled
only
as
the
heels
were
still
good
.
He
stated
that
this
had
*NL*
greatly
perturbed
his
peace
of
mind
in
the
other
region
and
earnestly
*NL*
requested
that
his
desire
should
be
made
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Assurances
were
given
that
the
matter
would
be
attended
to
and
it
was
*NL*
intimated
that
this
had
given
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
gone
from
mortal
haunts
:
O'Dignam
,
sun
of
our
morning
.
Fleet
was
*NL*
his
foot
on
the
bracken
:
Patrick
of
the
beamy
brow
.
Wail
,
Banba
,
with
*NL*
your
wind
:
and
wail
,
O
ocean
,
with
your
whirlwind
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
he
is
again
,
says
the
citizen
,
staring
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
?
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bloom
,
says
he
.
He
's
on
point
duty
up
and
down
there
for
the
last
ten
*NL*
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
begob
,
I
saw
his
physog
do
a
peep
in
and
then
slidder
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Alf
was
knocked
bawways
.
Faith
,
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Good
Christ
!
says
he
.
I
could
have
sworn
it
was
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
Bob
Doran
,
with
the
hat
on
the
back
of
his
poll
,
lowest
*NL*
blackguard
in
Dublin
when
he
's
under
the
influence
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
said
Christ
is
good
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
beg
your
parsnips
,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
a
good
Christ
,
says
Bob
Doran
,
to
take
away
poor
little
Willy
*NL*
Dignam
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
well
,
says
Alf
,
trying
to
pass
it
off
.
He
's
over
all
his
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Bob
Doran
shouts
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
a
bloody
ruffian
,
I
say
,
to
take
away
poor
little
Willy
Dignam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terry
came
down
and
tipped
him
the
wink
to
keep
quiet
,
that
they
did
n't
*NL*
want
that
kind
of
talk
in
a
respectable
licensed
premises
.
And
Bob
Doran
*NL*
starts
doing
the
weeps
about
Paddy
Dignam
,
true
as
you
're
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
finest
man
,
says
he
,
snivelling
,
the
finest
purest
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tear
is
bloody
near
your
eye
.
Talking
through
his
bloody
hat
.
Fitter
*NL*
for
him
go
home
to
the
little
sleepwalking
bitch
he
married
,
Mooney
,
the
*NL*
bumbailiff
's
daughter
,
mother
kept
a
kip
in
Hardwicke
street
,
that
*NL*
used
to
be
stravaging
about
the
landings
Bantam
Lyons
told
me
that
was
*NL*
stopping
there
at
two
in
the
morning
without
a
stitch
on
her
,
exposing
*NL*
her
person
,
open
to
all
comers
,
fair
field
and
no
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
noblest
,
the
truest
,
says
he
.
And
he
's
gone
,
poor
little
Willy
,
*NL*
poor
little
Paddy
Dignam
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
mournful
and
with
a
heavy
heart
he
bewept
the
extinction
of
that
*NL*
beam
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Garryowen
started
growling
again
at
Bloom
that
was
skeezing
round
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
in
,
come
on
,
he
wo
n't
eat
you
,
says
the
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Bloom
slopes
in
with
his
cod
's
eye
on
the
dog
and
he
asks
Terry
was
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O

says
Joe
,
reading
one
of

Listen

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
starts
reading

*NL*
*NL*

And
a

says
the
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
the
dirty
scrawl
of
the
wretch
,
says
Joe
.
Here
,
says
he
,
take
them
*NL*
to
hell
out
of
my
sight
,
Alf
.
Hello
,
Bloom
,
says
he
,
what
will
you
have
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
started
arguing
about
the
point
,
Bloom
saying
he
would
n't
and
he
*NL*
could
n't
and
excuse
him
no
offence
and
all
to
that
and
then
he
said
well
*NL*
he
'd
just
take
a
cigar
.
Gob
,
he
's
a
prudent
member
and
no
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
one
of
your
prime
stinkers
,
Terry
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Alf
was
telling
us
there
was
one
chap
sent
in
a
mourning
card
with
a
*NL*
black
border
round
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
're
all
barbers
,
says
he
,
from
the
black
country
that
would
hang
*NL*
their
own
fathers
for
five
quid
down
and
travelling
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
telling
us
there
's
two
fellows
waiting
below
to
pull
his
*NL*
heels
down
when
he
gets
the
drop
and
choke
him
properly
and
then
they
*NL*
chop
up
the
rope
after
and
sell
the
bits
for
a
few
bob
a
skull
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dark
land
they
bide
,
the
vengeful
knights
of
the
razor
.
Their
*NL*
deadly
coil
they
grasp
:
yea
,
and
therein
they
lead
to
Erebus
whatsoever
*NL*
wight
hath
done
a
deed
of
blood
for
I
will
on
nowise
suffer
it
even
so
*NL*
saith
the
Lord
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
started
talking
about
capital
punishment
and
of
course
Bloom
*NL*
comes
out
with
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
all
the
codology
of
the
*NL*
business
and
the
old
dog
smelling
him
all
the
time
I
'm
told
those
jewies
*NL*
does
have
a
sort
of
a
queer
odour
coming
off
them
for
dogs
about
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
all
deterrent
effect
and
so
forth
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
one
thing
it
has
n't
a
deterrent
effect
on
,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
that
?
says
Joe

*NL*
*NL*
--
The
poor
bugger
's
tool
that
's
being
hanged
,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
so
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
's
truth
,
says
Alf
.
I
heard
that
from
the
head
warder
that
was
in
*NL*
*NL*
Kilmainham
when
they
hanged
Joe
Brady
,
the
invincible
.
He
told
me
when
*NL*
they
cut
him
down
after
the
drop
it
was
standing
up
in
their
faces
like
*NL*
a
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ruling
passion
strong
in
death
,
says
Joe
,
as
someone
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
can
be
explained
by
science
,
says
Bloom
.
It
's
only
a
natural
*NL*
phenomenon
,
do
n't
you
see
,
because
on
account
of
the
...
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
starts
with
his
jawbreakers
about
phenomenon
and
science
and
*NL*
this
phenomenon
and
the
other
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
distinguished
scientist
Herr
Professor
Luitpold
Blumenduft
tendered
*NL*
medical
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
instantaneous
fracture
of
the
*NL*
cervical
vertebrae
and
consequent
scission
of
the
spinal
cord
would
,
*NL*
according
to
the
best
approved
tradition
of
medical
science
,
be
*NL*
calculated
to
inevitably
produce
in
the
human
subject
a
violent
*NL*
ganglionic
stimulus
of
the
nerve
centres
of
the
genital
apparatus
,
*NL*
thereby
causing
the
elastic
pores
of
the
_
corpora
cavernosa
_
to
rapidly
*NL*
dilate
in
such
a
way
as
to
instantaneously
facilitate
the
flow
of
blood
*NL*
to
that
part
of
the
human
anatomy
known
as
the
penis
or
male
organ
*NL*
resulting
in
the
phenomenon
which
has
been
denominated
by
the
faculty
*NL*
a
morbid
upwards
and
outwards
philoprogenitive
erection
_
in
articulo
*NL*
mortis
per
diminutionem
capitis
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
So
of
course
the
citizen
was
only
waiting
for
the
wink
of
the
word
and
*NL*
he
starts
gassing
out
of
him
about
the
invincibles
and
the
old
guard
and
*NL*
the
men
of
sixtyseven
and
who
fears
to
speak
of
ninetyeight
and
Joe
with
*NL*
him
about
all
the
fellows
that
were
hanged
,
drawn
and
transported
for
*NL*
the
cause
by
drumhead
courtmartial
and
a
new
Ireland
and
new
this
,
that
*NL*
and
the
other
.
Talking
about
new
Ireland
he
ought
to
go
and
get
a
new
*NL*
dog
so
he
ought
.
Mangy
ravenous
brute
sniffing
and
sneezing
all
round
*NL*
the
place
and
scratching
his
scabs
.
And
round
he
goes
to
Bob
Doran
that
*NL*
was
standing
Alf
a
half
one
sucking
up
for
what
he
could
get
.
So
of
*NL*
course
Bob
Doran
starts
doing
the
bloody
fool
with
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
the
paw
!
Give
the
paw
,
doggy
!
Good
old
doggy
!
Give
the
paw
*NL*
here
!
Give
us
the
paw
!
*NL*
*NL*
Arrah
,
bloody
end
to
the
paw
he
'd
paw
and
Alf
trying
to
keep
him
from
*NL*
tumbling
off
the
bloody
stool
atop
of
the
bloody
old
dog
and
he
talking
*NL*
all
kinds
of
drivel
about
training
by
kindness
and
thoroughbred
dog
and
*NL*
intelligent
dog
:
give
you
the
bloody
pip
.
Then
he
starts
scraping
a
few
*NL*
bits
of
old
biscuit
out
of
the
bottom
of
a
Jacobs
'
tin
he
told
Terry
to
*NL*
bring
.
Gob
,
he
golloped
it
down
like
old
boots
and
his
tongue
hanging
*NL*
out
of
him
a
yard
long
for
more
.
Near
ate
the
tin
and
all
,
hungry
bloody
*NL*
mongrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
citizen
and
Bloom
having
an
argument
about
the
point
,
the
*NL*
brothers
Sheares
and
Wolfe
Tone
beyond
on
Arbour
Hill
and
Robert
Emmet
*NL*
and
die
for
your
country
,
the
Tommy
Moore
touch
about
Sara
Curran
and
*NL*
she
's
far
from
the
land
.
And
Bloom
,
of
course
,
with
his
knockmedown
*NL*
cigar
putting
on
swank
with
his
lardy
face
.
Phenomenon
!
The
fat
heap
he
*NL*
married
is
a
nice
old
phenomenon
with
a
back
on
her
like
a
ballalley
.
*NL*
Time
they
were
stopping
up
in
the
_
City
Arms
_
pisser
Burke
told
me
there
*NL*
was
an
old
one
there
with
a
cracked
loodheramaun
of
a
nephew
and
Bloom
*NL*
trying
to
get
the
soft
side
of
her
doing
the
mollycoddle
playing
bezique
*NL*
to
come
in
for
a
bit
of
the
wampum
in
her
will
and
not
eating
meat
of
a
*NL*
Friday
because
the
old
one
was
always
thumping
her
craw
and
taking
the
*NL*
lout
out
for
a
walk
.
And
one
time
he
led
him
the
rounds
of
Dublin
and
,
*NL*
by
the
holy
farmer
,
he
never
cried
crack
till
he
brought
him
home
as
*NL*
drunk
as
a
boiled
owl
and
he
said
he
did
it
to
teach
him
the
evils
of
*NL*
alcohol
and
by
herrings
,
if
the
three
women
did
n't
near
roast
him
,
it
's
*NL*
a
queer
story
,
the
old
one
,
Bloom
's
wife
and
Mrs
O'Dowd
that
kept
the
*NL*
hotel
.
Jesus
,
I
had
to
laugh
at
pisser
Burke
taking
them
off
chewing
*NL*
the
fat
.
And
Bloom
with
his
_
but
do
n't
you
see
?
_
and
_
but
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
_
.
And
sure
,
more
be
token
,
the
lout
I
'm
told
was
in
Power
's
after
,
*NL*
the
blender
's
,
round
in
Cope
street
going
home
footless
in
a
cab
five
*NL*
times
in
the
week
after
drinking
his
way
through
all
the
samples
in
the
*NL*
bloody
establishment
.
Phenomenon
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
memory
of
the
dead
,
says
the
citizen
taking
up
his
pintglass
and
*NL*
glaring
at
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
ay
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
do
n't
grasp
my
point
,
says
Bloom
.
What
I
mean
is
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Sinn
Fein
!
_
says
the
citizen
.
_
Sinn
Fein
amhain
!
_
The
friends
we
love
*NL*
are
by
our
side
and
the
foes
we
hate
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
farewell
was
affecting
in
the
extreme
.
From
the
belfries
far
*NL*
and
near
the
funereal
deathbell
tolled
unceasingly
while
all
around
the
*NL*
gloomy
precincts
rolled
the
ominous
warning
of
a
hundred
muffled
drums
*NL*
punctuated
by
the
hollow
booming
of
pieces
of
ordnance
.
The
deafening
*NL*
claps
of
thunder
and
the
dazzling
flashes
of
lightning
which
lit
up
*NL*
the
ghastly
scene
testified
that
the
artillery
of
heaven
had
lent
its
*NL*
supernatural
pomp
to
the
already
gruesome
spectacle
.
A
torrential
rain
*NL*
poured
down
from
the
floodgates
of
the
angry
heavens
upon
the
*NL*
bared
heads
of
the
assembled
multitude
which
numbered
at
the
*NL*
lowest
computation
five
hundred
thousand
persons
.
A
posse
of
Dublin
*NL*
Metropolitan
police
superintended
by
the
Chief
Commissioner
in
person
*NL*
maintained
order
in
the
vast
throng
for
whom
the
York
street
brass
and
*NL*
reed
band
whiled
away
the
intervening
time
by
admirably
rendering
on
*NL*
their
blackdraped
instruments
the
matchless
melody
endeared
to
us
from
*NL*
the
cradle
by
Speranza
's
plaintive
muse
.
Special
quick
excursion
trains
*NL*
and
upholstered
charabancs
had
been
provided
for
the
comfort
of
our
*NL*
country
cousins
of
whom
there
were
large
contingents
.
Considerable
*NL*
amusement
was
caused
by
the
favourite
Dublin
streetsingers
L-n-h-n
and
*NL*
M-ll-g-n
who
sang
_
The
Night
before
Larry
was
stretched
_
in
their
usual
*NL*
mirth-provoking
fashion
.
Our
two
inimitable
drolls
did
a
roaring
trade
*NL*
with
their
broadsheets
among
lovers
of
the
comedy
element
and
nobody
*NL*
who
has
a
corner
in
his
heart
for
real
Irish
fun
without
vulgarity
*NL*
will
grudge
them
their
hardearned
pennies
.
The
children
of
the
Male
and
*NL*
Female
Foundling
Hospital
who
thronged
the
windows
overlooking
the
scene
*NL*
were
delighted
with
this
unexpected
addition
to
the
day
's
entertainment
*NL*
and
a
word
of
praise
is
due
to
the
Little
Sisters
of
the
Poor
for
their
*NL*
excellent
idea
of
affording
the
poor
fatherless
and
motherless
children
*NL*
a
genuinely
instructive
treat
.
The
viceregal
houseparty
which
included
*NL*
many
wellknown
ladies
was
chaperoned
by
Their
Excellencies
to
the
most
*NL*
favourable
positions
on
the
grandstand
while
the
picturesque
foreign
*NL*
delegation
known
as
the
Friends
of
the
Emerald
Isle
was
accommodated
*NL*
on
a
tribune
directly
opposite
.
The
delegation
,
present
in
full
force
,
*NL*
consisted
of
Commendatore
Bacibaci
Beninobenone
-LRB-
the
semiparalysed
*NL*
_
doyen
_
of
the
party
who
had
to

All
the
*NL*
delegates
without
exception
expressed
themselves
in
the
strongest
*NL*
possible
heterogeneous
terms
concerning
the
nameless
barbarity
which
*NL*
they
had
been
called
upon
to
witness
.
An
animated
altercation
-LRB-
in
which
*NL*
all
took
part
-RRB-
ensued
among
the
F.
O.
T.
E.
I.
as
to
whether
the
eighth
*NL*
or
the
ninth
of
March
was
the
correct
date
of
the
birth
of
Ireland
's
*NL*
patron
saint
.
In
the
course
of
the
argument
cannonballs
,
scimitars
,
*NL*
boomerangs
,
blunderbusses
,
stinkpots
,
meatchoppers
,
umbrellas
,
*NL*
catapults
,
knuckledusters
,
sandbags
,
lumps
of
pig
iron
were
resorted
to
*NL*
and
blows
were
freely
exchanged
.
The
baby
policeman
,
Constable
*NL*
MacFadden
,
summoned
by
special
courier
from
Booterstown
,
quickly
*NL*
restored
order
and
with
lightning
promptitude
proposed
the
seventeenth
*NL*
of
the
month
as
a
solution
equally
honourable
for
both
contending
*NL*
parties
.
The
readywitted
ninefooter
's
suggestion
at
once
appealed
to
all
*NL*
and
was
unanimously
accepted
.
Constable
MacFadden
was
heartily
*NL*
congratulated
by
all
the
F.O.T.E.I.
,
several
of
whom
were
bleeding
*NL*
profusely
.
Commendatore
Beninobenone
having
been
extricated
from
*NL*
underneath
the
presidential
armchair
,
it
was
explained
by
his
legal
*NL*
adviser
Avvocato
Pagamimi
that
the
various
articles
secreted
in
his
*NL*
thirtytwo
pockets
had
been
abstracted
by
him
during
the
affray
from
the
*NL*
pockets
of
his
junior
colleagues
in
the
hope
of
bringing
them
to
their
*NL*
senses
.
The
objects
-LRB-
which
included
several
hundred
ladies
'
and
*NL*
gentlemen
's
gold
and
silver
watches
-RRB-
were
promptly
restored
to
their
*NL*
rightful
owners
and
general
harmony
reigned
supreme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quietly
,
unassumingly
Rumbold
stepped
on
to
the
scaffold
in
faultless
*NL*
morning
dress
and
wearing
his
favourite
flower
,
the
_
Gladiolus
*NL*
Cruentus
_
.
He
announced
his
presence
by
that
gentle
Rumboldian
cough
*NL*
which
so
many
have
tried
-LRB-
unsuccessfully
-RRB-
to
imitate
--
short
,
*NL*
painstaking
yet
withal
so
characteristic
of
the
man
.
The
arrival
of
the
*NL*
worldrenowned
headsman
was
greeted
by
a
roar
of
acclamation
from
the
*NL*
huge
concourse
,
the
viceregal
ladies
waving
their
handkerchiefs
in
*NL*
their
excitement
while
the
even
more
excitable
foreign
delegates
*NL*
cheered
vociferously
in
a
medley
of
cries
,
_
hoch
,
banzai
,
eljen
,
zivio
,
*NL*
chinchin
,

Allah
_
,
amid
which
the
ringing
*NL*
_
evviva
_
of
the
delegate
of
the
land
of
song
-LRB-
a
high
double
F
recalling
*NL*
those
piercingly
lovely
notes
with
which
the
eunuch
Catalani
beglamoured
*NL*
our
greatgreatgrandmothers
-RRB-
was
easily
distinguishable
.
It
was
exactly
*NL*
seventeen
o'clock
.
The
signal
for
prayer
was
then
promptly
given
by
*NL*
megaphone
and
in
an
instant
all
heads
were
bared
,
the
commendatore
's
*NL*
patriarchal
sombrero
,
which
has
been
in
the
possession
of
his
family
*NL*
since
the
revolution
of
Rienzi
,
being
removed
by
his
medical
adviser
*NL*
in
attendance
,
Dr
Pippi
.
The
learned
prelate
who
administered
the
last
*NL*
comforts
of
holy
religion
to
the
hero
martyr
when
about
to
pay
the
death
*NL*
penalty
knelt
in
a
most
christian
spirit
in
a
pool
of
rainwater
,
his
*NL*
cassock
above
his
hoary
head
,
and
offered
up
to
the
throne
of
grace
*NL*
fervent
prayers
of
supplication
.
Hand
by
the
block
stood
the
grim
figure
*NL*
of
the
executioner
,
his
visage
being
concealed
in
a
tengallon
pot
*NL*
with
two
circular
perforated
apertures
through
which
his
eyes
glowered
*NL*
furiously
.
As
he
awaited
the
fatal
signal
he
tested
the
edge
of
his
*NL*
horrible
weapon
by
honing
it
upon
his
brawny
forearm
or
decapitated
*NL*
in
rapid
succession
a
flock
of
sheep
which
had
been
provided
by
the
*NL*
admirers
of
his
fell
but
necessary
office
.
On
a
handsome
mahogany
table
*NL*
near
him
were
neatly
arranged
the
quartering
knife
,
the
various
*NL*
finely
tempered
disembowelling
appliances
-LRB-
specially
supplied
by
the
*NL*
worldfamous
firm
of
cutlers
,
Messrs
John
Round
and
Sons
,
Sheffield
-RRB-
,
*NL*
a
terra
cotta
saucepan
for
the
reception
of
the
duodenum
,
colon
,
*NL*
blind
intestine
and
appendix
etc
when
successfully
extracted
and
two
*NL*
commodious
milkjugs
destined
to
receive
the
most
precious
blood
of
the
*NL*
most
precious
victim
.
The
housesteward
of
the
amalgamated
cats
'
and
*NL*
dogs
'
home
was
in
attendance
to
convey
these
vessels
when
replenished
*NL*
to
that
beneficent
institution
.
Quite
an
excellent
repast
consisting
of
*NL*
rashers
and
eggs
,
fried
steak
and
onions
,
done
to
a
nicety
,
delicious
*NL*
hot
breakfast
rolls
and
invigorating
tea
had
been
considerately
provided
*NL*
by
the
authorities
for
the
consumption
of
the
central
figure
of
the
*NL*
tragedy
who
was
in
capital
spirits
when
prepared
for
death
and
evinced
*NL*
the
keenest
interest
in
the
proceedings
from
beginning
to
end
but
he
,
*NL*
with
an
abnegation
rare
in
these
our
times
,
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
*NL*
and
expressed
the
dying
wish
-LRB-
immediately
acceded
to
-RRB-
that
the
meal
*NL*
should
be
divided
in
aliquot
parts
among
the
members
of
the
sick
and
*NL*
indigent
roomkeepers
'
association
as
a
token
of
his
regard
and
esteem
.
*NL*
The
_
nec
_
and
_
non
plus
ultra
_
of
emotion
were
reached
when
the
blushing
*NL*
bride
elect
burst
her
way
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
bystanders
*NL*
and
flung
herself
upon
the
muscular
bosom
of
him
who
was
about
to
be
*NL*
launched
into
eternity
for
her
sake
.
The
hero
folded
her
willowy
form
in
*NL*
a
loving
embrace
murmuring
fondly
_
Sheila
,
my
own
_
.
Encouraged
by
*NL*
this
use
of
her
christian
name
she
kissed
passionately
all
the
various
*NL*
suitable
areas
of
his
person
which
the
decencies
of
prison
garb
*NL*
permitted
her
ardour
to
reach
.
She
swore
to
him
as
they
mingled
the
salt
*NL*
streams
of
their
tears
that
she
would
ever
cherish
his
memory
,
that
she
*NL*
would
never
forget
her
hero
boy
who
went
to
his
death
with
a
song
on
his
*NL*
lips
as
if
he
were
but
going
to
a
hurling
match
in
Clonturk
park
.
She
*NL*
brought
back
to
his
recollection
the
happy
days
of
blissful
childhood
*NL*
together
on
the
banks
of
Anna
Liffey
when
they
had
indulged
in
the
*NL*
innocent
pastimes
of
the
young
and
,
oblivious
of
the
dreadful
present
,
*NL*
they
both
laughed
heartily
,
all
the
spectators
,
including
the
venerable
*NL*
pastor
,
joining
in
the
general
merriment
.
That
monster
audience
simply
*NL*
rocked
with
delight
.
But
anon
they
were
overcome
with
grief
and
clasped
*NL*
their
hands
for
the
last
time
.
A
fresh
torrent
of
tears
burst
from
their
*NL*
lachrymal
ducts
and
the
vast
concourse
of
people
,
touched
to
the
inmost
*NL*
core
,
broke
into
heartrending
sobs
,
not
the
least
affected
being
the
*NL*
aged
prebendary
himself
.
Big
strong
men
,
officers
of
the
peace
and
*NL*
genial
giants
of
the
royal
Irish
constabulary
,
were
making
frank
use
of
*NL*
their
handkerchiefs
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
*NL*
in
that
record
assemblage
.
A
most
romantic
incident
occurred
when
a
*NL*
handsome
young
Oxford
graduate
,
noted
for
his
chivalry
towards
the
fair
*NL*
sex
,
stepped
forward
and
,
presenting
his
visiting
card
,
bankbook
*NL*
and
genealogical
tree
,
solicited
the
hand
of
the
hapless
young
lady
,
*NL*
requesting
her
to
name
the
day
,
and
was
accepted
on
the
spot
.
Every
lady
*NL*
in
the
audience
was
presented
with
a
tasteful
souvenir
of
the
occasion
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
a
skull
and
crossbones
brooch
,
a
timely
and
generous
*NL*
act
which
evoked
a
fresh
outburst
of
emotion
:
and
when
the
gallant
young
*NL*
Oxonian
-LRB-
the
bearer
,
by
the
way
,
of
one
of
the
most
timehonoured
names
*NL*
in
Albion
's
history
-RRB-
placed
on
the
finger
of
his
blushing
_
fiancee
_
an
*NL*
expensive
engagement
ring
with
emeralds
set
in
the
form
of
a
*NL*
fourleaved
shamrock
the
excitement
knew
no
bounds
.
Nay
,
even
the
*NL*
ster
provostmarshal
,
lieutenantcolonel
Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan
*NL*
Tomlinson
,
who
presided
on
the
sad
occasion
,
he
who
had
blown
a
*NL*
considerable
number
of
sepoys
from
the
cannonmouth
without
flinching
,
*NL*
could
not
now
restrain
his
natural
emotion
.
With
his
mailed
gauntlet
*NL*
he
brushed
away
a
furtive
tear
and
was
overheard
,
by
those
privileged
*NL*
burghers
who
happened
to
be
in
his
immediate
_
entourage
,
_
to
murmur
to
*NL*
himself
in
a
faltering
undertone
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
blimey
if
she
aint
a
clinker
,
that
there
bleeding
tart
.
Blimey
it
*NL*
makes
me
kind
of
bleeding
cry
,
straight
,
it
does
,
when
I
sees
her
cause
*NL*
I
thinks
of
my
old
mashtub
what
's
waiting
for
me
down
Limehouse
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
the
citizen
begins
talking
about
the
Irish
language
and
the
*NL*
corporation
meeting
and
all
to
that
and
the
shoneens
that
ca
n't
speak
*NL*
their
own
language
and
Joe
chipping
in
because
he
stuck
someone
for
a
*NL*
quid
and
Bloom
putting
in
his
old
goo
with
his
twopenny
stump
that
*NL*
he
cadged
off
of
Joe
and
talking
about
the
Gaelic
league
and
the
*NL*
antitreating
league
and
drink
,
the
curse
of
Ireland
.
Antitreating
is
*NL*
about
the
size
of
it
.
Gob
,
he
'd
let
you
pour
all
manner
of
drink
down
*NL*
his
throat
till
the
Lord
would
call
him
before
you
'd
ever
see
the
froth
*NL*
of
his
pint
.
And
one
night
I
went
in
with
a
fellow
into
one
of
their
*NL*
musical
evenings
,
song
and
dance
about
she
could
get
up
on
a
truss
of
*NL*
hay
she
could
my
Maureen
Lay
and
there
was
a
fellow
with
a
Ballyhooly
*NL*
blue
ribbon
badge
spiffing
out
of
him
in
Irish
and
a
lot
of
colleen
*NL*
bawns
going
about
with
temperance
beverages
and
selling
medals
*NL*
and
oranges
and
lemonade
and
a
few
old
dry
buns
,
gob
,
flahoolagh
*NL*
entertainment
,
do
n't
be
talking
.
Ireland
sober
is
Ireland
free
.
And
*NL*
then
an
old
fellow
starts
blowing
into
his
bagpipes
and
all
the
gougers
*NL*
shuffling
their
feet
to
the
tune
the
old
cow
died
of
.
And
one
or
two
*NL*
sky
pilots
having
an
eye
around
that
there
was
no
goings
on
with
the
*NL*
females
,
hitting
below
the
belt
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
howandever
,
as
I
was
saying
,
the
old
dog
seeing
the
tin
was
empty
*NL*
starts
mousing
around
by
Joe
and
me
.
I
'd
train
him
by
kindness
,
so
I
*NL*
would
,
if
he
was
my
dog
.
Give
him
a
rousing
fine
kick
now
and
again
*NL*
where
it
would
n't
blind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Afraid
he
'll
bite
you
?
says
the
citizen
,
jeering
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
says
I
.
But
he
might
take
my
leg
for
a
lamppost
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
calls
the
old
dog
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
on
you
,
Garry
?
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
starts
hauling
and
mauling
and
talking
to
him
in
Irish
and
the
*NL*
old
towser
growling
,
letting
on
to
answer
,
like
a
duet
in
the
opera
.
*NL*
Such
growling
you
never
heard
as
they
let
off
between
them
.
Someone
that
*NL*
has
nothing
better
to
do
ought
to
write
a
letter
_
pro
bono
publico
_
to
*NL*
the
papers
about
the
muzzling
order
for
a
dog
the
like
of
that
.
Growling
*NL*
and
grousing
and
his
eye
all
bloodshot
from
the
drouth
is
in
it
and
the
*NL*
hydrophobia
dropping
out
of
his
jaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
who
are
interested
in
the
spread
of
human
culture
among
the
*NL*
lower
animals
-LRB-
and
their
name
is
legion
-RRB-
should
make
a
point
of
not
*NL*
missing
the
really
marvellous
exhibition
of
cynanthropy
given
by
the
*NL*
famous
old
Irish
red
setter
wolfdog
formerly
known
by
the
_
sobriquet
_
of
*NL*
Garryowen
and
recently
rechristened
by
his
large
circle
of
friends
and
*NL*
acquaintances
Owen
Garry
.
The
exhibition
,
which
is
the
result
of
years
*NL*
of
training
by
kindness
and
a
carefully
thoughtout
dietary
system
,
*NL*
comprises
,
among
other
achievements
,
the
recitation
of
verse
.
Our
*NL*
greatest
living
phonetic
expert
-LRB-
wild
horses
shall
not
drag
it
from
us
!
-RRB-
*NL*
has
left
no
stone
unturned
in
his
efforts
to
delucidate
and
compare
*NL*
the
verse
recited
and
has
found
it
bears
a
_
striking
_
resemblance
-LRB-
the
*NL*
italics
are
ours
-RRB-
to
the
ranns
of
ancient
Celtic
bards
.
We
are
not
*NL*
speaking
so
much
of
those
delightful
lovesongs
with
which
the
writer
who
*NL*
conceals
his
identity
under
the
graceful
pseudonym
of
the
Little
*NL*
Sweet
Branch
has
familiarised
the
bookloving
world
but
rather
-LRB-
as
*NL*
a
contributor
D.
O.
C.
points
out
in
an
interesting
communication
*NL*
published
by
an
evening
contemporary
-RRB-
of
the
harsher
and
more
personal
*NL*
note
which
is
found
in
the
satirical
effusions
of
the
famous
Raftery
and
*NL*
of
Donal
MacConsidine
to
say
nothing
of
a
more
modern
lyrist
at
present
*NL*
very
much
in
the
public
eye
.
We
subjoin
a
specimen
which
has
been
*NL*
rendered
into
English
by
an
eminent
scholar
whose
name
for
the
moment
we
*NL*
are
not
at
liberty
to
disclose
though
we
believe
that
our
readers
will
*NL*
find
the
topical
allusion
rather
more
than
an
indication
.
The
metrical
*NL*
system
of
the
canine
original
,
which
recalls
the
intricate
alliterative
*NL*
and
isosyllabic
rules
of
the
Welsh
englyn
,
is
infinitely
more
*NL*
complicated
but
we
believe
our
readers
will
agree
that
the
spirit
has
*NL*
been
well
caught
.
Perhaps
it
should
be
added
that
the
effect
is
greatly
*NL*
increased
if
Owen
's
verse
be
spoken
somewhat
slowly
and
indistinctly
in
*NL*
a
tone
suggestive
of
suppressed
rancour
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
The
curse
of
my
curses
*NL*
Seven
days
every
day
*NL*
And
seven
dry
Thursdays
*NL*
On
you
,
Barney
Kiernan
,
*NL*
Has
no

*NL*
To

my

,
*NL*
And
my

red
roaring
*NL*
After
Lowry
's

.
_
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
told
Terry
to
bring
some
water
for
the
dog
and
,
gob
,
you
could
*NL*
hear
him
lapping
it
up
a
mile
off
.
And
Joe
asked
him
would
he
have
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
will
,
says
he
,
_
a
chara
_
,
to
show
there
's
no
ill
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gob
,
he
's
not
as
green
as
he
's
cabbagelooking
.
Arsing
around
from
one
*NL*
pub
to
another
,
leaving
it
to
your
own
honour
,
with
old
Giltrap
's
dog
*NL*
and
getting
fed
up
by
the
ratepayers
and
corporators
.
Entertainment
for
*NL*
man
and
beast
.
And
says
Joe
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Could
you
make
a
hole
in
another
pint
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Could
a
swim
duck
?
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Same
again
,
Terry
,
says
Joe
.
Are
you
sure
you
wo
n't
have
anything
in
*NL*
the
way
of
liquid
refreshment
?
says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you
,
no
,
says
Bloom
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
just
wanted
to
meet
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
,
do
n't
you
see
,
about
this
insurance
of
poor
Dignam
's
.
*NL*
Martin
asked
me
to
go
to
the
house
.
You
see
,
he
,
Dignam
,
I
mean
,
did
n't
*NL*
serve
any
notice
of
the
assignment
on
the
company
at
the
time
and
*NL*
nominally
under
the
act
the
mortgagee
ca
n't
recover
on
the
policy
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Holy
Wars
,
says
Joe
,
laughing
,
that
's
a
good
one
if
old
Shylock
is
*NL*
landed
.
So
the
wife
comes
out
top
dog
,
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
that
's
a
point
,
says
Bloom
,
for
the
wife
's
admirers
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Whose
admirers
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
wife
's
advisers
,
I
mean
,
says
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
starts
all
confused
mucking
it
up
about
mortgagor
under
the
act
*NL*
like
the
lord
chancellor
giving
it
out
on
the
bench
and
for
the
benefit
*NL*
of
the
wife
and
that
a
trust
is
created
but
on
the
other
hand
that
*NL*
Dignam
owed
Bridgeman
the
money
and
if
now
the
wife
or
the
widow
*NL*
contested
the
mortgagee
's
right
till
he
near
had
the
head
of
me
addled
*NL*
with
his
mortgagor
under
the
act
.
He
was
bloody
safe
he
was
n't
run
in
*NL*
himself
under
the
act
that
time
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
only
he
had
a
*NL*
friend
in
court
.
Selling
bazaar
tickets
or
what
do
you
call
it
royal
*NL*
Hungarian
privileged
lottery
.
True
as
you
're
there
.
O
,
commend
me
to
an
*NL*
israelite
!
Royal
and
privileged
Hungarian
robbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Bob
Doran
comes
lurching
around
asking
Bloom
to
tell
Mrs
Dignam
he
*NL*
was
sorry
for
her
trouble
and
he
was
very
sorry
about
the
funeral
and
*NL*
to
tell
her
that
he
said
and
everyone
who
knew
him
said
that
there
was
*NL*
never
a
truer
,
a
finer
than
poor
little
Willy
that
's
dead
to
tell
her
.
*NL*
Choking
with
bloody
foolery
.
And
shaking
Bloom
's
hand
doing
the
tragic
*NL*
to
tell
her
that
.
Shake
hands
,
brother
.
You
're
a
rogue
and
I
'm
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
me
,
said
he
,
so
far
presume
upon
our
acquaintance
which
,
however
*NL*
slight
it
may
appear
if
judged
by
the
standard
of
mere
time
,
is
founded
,
*NL*
as
I
hope
and
believe
,
on
a
sentiment
of
mutual
esteem
as
to
request
of
*NL*
you
this
favour
.
But
,
should
I
have
overstepped
the
limits
of
reserve
*NL*
let
the
sincerity
of
my
feelings
be
the
excuse
for
my
boldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
rejoined
the
other
,
I
appreciate
to
the
full
the
motives
which
*NL*
actuate
your
conduct
and
I
shall
discharge
the
office
you
entrust
to
*NL*
me
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
,
though
the
errand
be
one
of
sorrow
,
*NL*
this
proof
of
your
confidence
sweetens
in
some
measure
the
bitterness
of
*NL*
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
suffer
me
to
take
your
hand
,
said
he
.
The
goodness
of
your
heart
,
*NL*
I
feel
sure
,
will
dictate
to
you
better
than
my
inadequate
words
*NL*
the
expressions
which
are
most
suitable
to
convey
an
emotion
whose
*NL*
poignancy
,
were
I
to
give
vent
to
my
feelings
,
would
deprive
me
even
of
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
off
with
him
and
out
trying
to
walk
straight
.
Boosed
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
.
Night
he
was
near
being
lagged
only
Paddy
Leonard
knew
the
*NL*
bobby
,
14A
.
Blind
to
the
world
up
in
a
shebeen
in
Bride
street
after
*NL*
closing
time
,
fornicating
with
two
shawls
and
a
bully
on
guard
,
drinking
*NL*
porter
out
of
teacups
.
And
calling
himself
a
Frenchy
for
the
shawls
,
*NL*
Joseph
Manuo
,
and
talking
against
the
Catholic
religion
,
and
he
serving
*NL*
mass
in
Adam
and
Eve
's
when
he
was
young
with
his
eyes
shut
,
who
wrote
*NL*
the
new

,
and
the
old

,
and
hugging
and
smugging
.
And
*NL*
the
two
shawls
killed
with
the
laughing
,
picking
his
pockets
,
the
bloody
*NL*
fool
and
he
spilling
the
porter
all
over
the
bed
and
the
two
shawls
*NL*
screeching
laughing
at
one
another
.
_
How
is
your
testament
?
Have
you
got
*NL*
an
old
testament
?
_
Only
Paddy
was
passing
there
,
I
tell
you
what
.
Then
*NL*
see
him
of
a
Sunday
with
his
little
concubine
of
a
wife
,
and
she
wagging
*NL*
her
tail
up
the
aisle
of
the
chapel
with
her
patent
boots
on
her
,
no
*NL*
less
,
and
her
violets
,
nice
as
pie
,
doing
the
little
lady
.
Jack
Mooney
's
*NL*
sister
.
And
the
old
prostitute
of
a
mother
procuring
rooms
to
street
*NL*
couples
.
Gob
,
Jack
made
him
toe
the
line
.
Told
him
if
he
did
n't
patch
up
*NL*
the
pot
,
Jesus
,
he
'd
kick
the
shite
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Terry
brought
the
three

Good

he
had
his

half

down
the

already
.
Want
a
small

fortune
to
keep
him
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
the
long
fellow
running
for
the
mayoralty
,
Alf
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Friend

says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nannan

says
Joe

The

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wo
n't
mention
any

,
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
so
,
says
Joe
.
I
saw
him
up
at
that
meeting
now
with
William
*NL*
Field
,
M.
P.
,
the
cattle
traders
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hairy

says
the

,
that
exploded
volcano
,
the
darling
of
*NL*
all
countries
and
the
idol
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Joe
starts
telling
the
citizen
about
the
foot
and
mouth
disease
*NL*
and
the
cattle
traders
and
taking
action
in
the
matter
and
the
citizen
*NL*
sending
them
all
to
the
rightabout
and
Bloom
coming
out
with
his
*NL*
sheepdip
for
the
scab
and
a
hoose
drench
for
coughing
calves
and
the
*NL*
guaranteed
remedy
for

tongue
.
Because
he
was
up
one
time
in
a
*NL*
knacker
's
yard
.
Walking
about
with
his
book
and
pencil
here
's
my

*NL*

my

are
coming
till
Joe
Cuffe
gave
him
the

*NL*
for

.
Mister

Teach

Pisser
Burke
was
telling
me
in

the

*NL*
to
be
in

of

some
times
with
Mrs
O'Dowd
crying
her
eyes
out
*NL*
with
her
eight
inches

all
over

Could
n't
loosen

*NL*
strings
but
old

was
waltzing
around
her
showing
her
how

*NL*
it
.
What
's
your

today
?
Ay

Humane

Because
the
poor

suffer
and
experts
say
and
the
best

remedy
that
does
n't
*NL*
cause
pain
to

on

administer
gently

Anyhow

says

*NL*
*NL*

Are

says

the

I

him

as
it
happens

*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
he
's
going
off
by
the

,
says
Joe
,
tonight
.
*NL*
*NL*

That
's
too
bad

says
Bloom

I
wanted
particularly
.
Perhaps
only
Mr

is
going

I
could
n't
phone

No

You
're

*NL*
*NL*

Nannan

The

him
to

*NL*
tomorrow
about

Arising
out
of
the

of
*NL*
my
honourable
friend
,
the
member
for
Shillelagh
,
may
I
ask
the

whether
the

has
issued
orders
that
these
*NL*
animals
shall
be
slaughtered
though
no

I
feel
I

not
usefully

The

to

Mr

There
's
the
man
,
says
Joe
,
that
made
the
Gaelic
sports
revival
.
There
*NL*
he
is
sitting
there
.
The
man
that
got
away
James

The
champion
*NL*
of
all
Ireland
at
putting
the
sixteen

shot
.
What
was
your

*NL*
throw
,
citizen
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Na
bacleis
_
,
says
the
citizen
,
letting
on
to
be
modest
.
There
was
a
*NL*
time
I
was
as
good
as
the
next
fellow
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Put
it
there
,
citizen
,
says
Joe
.
You
were
and
a
bloody
sight
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
really
a
fact
?
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
says
Bloom
.
That
's
well
known
.
Did
you
not
know
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
off
they
started
about
Irish
sports
and
shoneen
games
the
like
of
*NL*
lawn
tennis
and
about
hurley
and
putting
the
stone
and
racy
of
the
soil
*NL*
and
building
up
a
nation
once
again
and
all
to
that
.
And
of
course
Bloom
*NL*
had
to
have
his
say
too
about
if
a
fellow
had
a
rower
's
heart
violent
*NL*
exercise
was
bad
.
I
declare
to
my
antimacassar
if
you
took
up
a
straw
*NL*
from
the
bloody
floor
and
if
you
said
to
Bloom
:
_
Look
at
,
Bloom
.
Do
you
*NL*
see
that
straw
?
That
's
a
straw
_
.
Declare
to
my
aunt
he
'd
talk
about
it
*NL*
for
an
hour
so
he
would
and
talk
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
most
interesting
discussion
took
place
in
the
ancient
hall
of
_
Brian
*NL*
O'ciarnain
's
_
in
_
Sraid
na
Bretaine
Bheag
_
,
under
the
auspices
of
*NL*
_
Sluagh
na
h-Eireann
_
,
on
the
revival
of
ancient
Gaelic
sports
and
the
*NL*
importance
of
physical
culture
,
as
understood
in
ancient
Greece
and
*NL*
ancient
Rome
and
ancient
Ireland
,
for
the
development
of
the
race
.
*NL*
The
venerable
president
of
the
noble
order
was
in
the
chair
and
the
*NL*
attendance
was
of
large
dimensions
.
After
an
instructive
discourse
by
*NL*
the
chairman
,
a
magnificent
oration
eloquently
and
forcibly
expressed
,
*NL*
a
most
interesting
and
instructive
discussion
of
the
usual
high
standard
*NL*
of
excellence
ensued
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
revivability
of
*NL*
the
ancient
games
and
sports
of
our
ancient
Panceltic
forefathers
.
The
*NL*
wellknown
and
highly
respected
worker
in
the
cause
of
our
old
tongue
,
Mr
*NL*
Joseph
M'Carthy
Hynes
,
made
an
eloquent
appeal
for
the
resuscitation
of
*NL*
the
ancient
Gaelic
sports
and
pastimes
,
practised
morning
and
evening
*NL*
by
Finn
MacCool
,
as
calculated
to
revive
the
best
traditions
of
manly
*NL*
strength
and
prowess
handed
down
to
us
from
ancient
ages
.
L.
Bloom
,
who
*NL*
met
with
a
mixed
reception
of
applause
and
hisses
,
having
espoused
the
*NL*
negative
the
vocalist
chairman
brought
the
discussion
to
a
close
,
in
*NL*
response
to
repeated
requests
and
hearty
plaudits
from
all
parts
of
*NL*
a
bumper
house
,
by
a
remarkably
noteworthy
rendering
of
the
immortal
*NL*
Thomas
Osborne
Davis
'
evergreen
verses
-LRB-
happily
too
familiar
to
need
*NL*
recalling
here
-RRB-
_
A
nation
once
again
_
in
the
execution
of
which
the
*NL*
veteran
patriot
champion
may
be
said
without
fear
of
contradiction
*NL*
to
have
fairly
excelled
himself
.
The
Irish
Caruso-Garibaldi
was
in
*NL*
superlative
form
and
his
stentorian
notes
were
heard
to
the
greatest
*NL*
advantage
in
the
timehonoured
anthem
sung
as
only
our
citizen
can
sing
*NL*
it
.
His
superb
highclass
vocalism
,
which
by
its
superquality
greatly
*NL*
enhanced
his
already
international
reputation
,
was
vociferously
*NL*
applauded
by
the
large
audience
among
which
were
to
be
noticed
many
*NL*
prominent
members
of
the
clergy
as
well
as
representatives
of
the
press
*NL*
and
the
bar
and
the
other

over

--

?
Blazes
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
Bloom
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
I
meant
about
tennis
,
for
example
,
is
the
agility
and
training
*NL*
the
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
Blazes
,
says
Alf
.
He
let
out
that
Myler
was
on
the
beer
to
run
up
*NL*
the
odds
and
he
swatting
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
know
him
,
says
the
citizen
.
The
traitor
's
son
.
We
know
what
put
*NL*
English
gold
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
True
for
you
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Bloom
cuts
in
again
about
lawn
tennis
and
the
circulation
of
the
*NL*
blood
,
asking
Alf
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
,
Bergan
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Myler
dusted
the
floor
with
him
,
says
Alf
.
Heenan
and
Sayers
was
only
*NL*
a
bloody
fool
to
it
.
Handed
him
the
father
and
mother
of
a
beating
.
See
*NL*
the
little
kipper
not
up
to
his
navel
and
the
big
fellow
swiping
.
God
,
*NL*
he
gave
him
one
last
puck
in
the
wind
,
Queensberry
rules
and
all
,
made
*NL*
him
puke
what
he
never
ate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
historic
and
a
hefty
battle
when
Myler
and
Percy
were
scheduled
*NL*
to
don
the
gloves
for
the
purse
of
fifty
sovereigns
.
Handicapped
as
he
*NL*
was
by
lack
of
poundage
,
Dublin
's
pet
lamb
made
up
for
it
by
superlative
*NL*
skill
in
ringcraft
.
The
final
bout
of
fireworks
was
a
gruelling
for
both
*NL*
champions
.
The
welterweight
sergeantmajor
had
tapped
some
lively
claret
*NL*
in
the
previous
mixup
during
which
Keogh
had
been
receivergeneral
of
*NL*
rights
and
lefts
,
the
artilleryman
putting
in
some
neat
work
on
the
*NL*
pet
's
nose
,
and
Myler
came
on
looking
groggy
.
The
soldier
got
to
*NL*
business
,
leading
off
with
a
powerful
left
jab
to
which
the
Irish
*NL*
gladiator
retaliated
by
shooting
out
a
stiff
one
flush
to
the
point
of
*NL*
Bennett
's
jaw
.
The
redcoat
ducked
but
the
Dubliner
lifted
him
with
a
*NL*
left
hook
,
the
body
punch
being
a
fine
one
.
The
men
came
to
handigrips
.
*NL*
Myler
quickly
became
busy
and
got
his
man
under
,
the
bout
ending
with
*NL*
the
bulkier
man
on
the
ropes
,
Myler
punishing
him
.
The
Englishman
,
whose
*NL*
right
eye
was
nearly
closed
,
took
his
corner
where
he
was
liberally
*NL*
drenched
with
water
and
when
the
bell
went
came
on
gamey
and
brimful
of
*NL*
pluck
,
confident
of
knocking
out
the
fistic
Eblanite
in
jigtime
.
It
was
*NL*
a
fight
to
a
finish
and
the
best
man
for
it
.
The
two
fought
like
tigers
*NL*
and
excitement
ran
fever
high
.
The
referee
twice
cautioned
Pucking
Percy
*NL*
for
holding
but
the
pet
was
tricky
and
his
footwork
a
treat
to
watch
.
*NL*
After
a
brisk
exchange
of
courtesies
during
which
a
smart
upper
cut
of
*NL*
the
military
man
brought
blood
freely
from
his
opponent
's
mouth
the
*NL*
lamb
suddenly
waded
in
all
over
his
man
and
landed
a
terrific
left
to
*NL*
Battling
Bennett
's
stomach
,
flooring
him
flat
.
It
was
a
knockout
clean
*NL*
and
clever
.
Amid
tense
expectation
the
Portobello
bruiser
was
being
*NL*
counted
out
when
Bennett
's
second
Ole
Pfotts
Wettstein
threw
in
the
*NL*
towel
and
the
Santry
boy
was
declared
victor
to
the
frenzied
cheers
of
*NL*
the
public
who
broke
through
the
ringropes
and
fairly
mobbed
him
with
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
knows
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
,
says
Alf
.
I
hear
he
's
*NL*
running
a
concert
tour
now
up
in
the
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
,
says
Joe
.
Is
n't
he
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
?
says
Bloom
.
Ah
,
yes
.
That
's
quite
true
.
Yes
,
a
kind
of
summer
*NL*
tour
,
you
see
.
Just
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mrs
B.
is
the
bright
particular
star
,
is
n't
she
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
wife

says
Bloom

She
's
singing

yes

I
think
it
will
be
a
success
*NL*
too

*NL*
*NL*
He

an
excellent
man
to
organise
.
Excellent

*NL*
Hoho

I

That
explains
the

the
*NL*
cocoanut

Blazes

Twixt

*NL*
*NL*
Pride
of

the
ravenhaired
daughter
of
Tweedy
.
There
*NL*
grew
she
to
peerless
beauty
where
loquat
and
almond
scent
the
air
.
The
*NL*
gardens
of
Alameda
knew
her
step
:
the
garths
of
olives
knew
and
bowed
.
*NL*
The
chaste
spouse
of
Leopold

she
:
Marion
of

bountiful

*NL*
*NL*
And
lo
,
there
entered
one
of
the
clan
of
the
O'Molloy

,
a
comely
hero
*NL*
of
white
face
yet
withal
somewhat
ruddy
,
his
majesty

learned
*NL*
in

with
him
the

Half

*NL*
*NL*
So
J.

Were

Yes

He

Hope

says
Ned

*NL*
*NL*
Now
what
were
those
two
at
?
J.
J.
getting
him
off
the
grand
jury
list
*NL*
and
the
other
give
him
a
leg
over
the
stile
.
With
his
name
in
Stubbs

*NL*
Playing
cards
,
hobnobbing
with
flash
toffs
with
a
swank
glass
in
their
*NL*
eye
,
adrinking
fizz
and
he
half
smothered
in
writs
and
garnishee
orders
.
*NL*
Pawning
his
gold
watch
in
Cummins
of
Francis
street
where
no-one
would
*NL*
know
him
in
the
private
office
when
I
was
there
with
Pisser
releasing
*NL*
his
boots
out
of
the
pop
.
What
's
your
name
,
sir

Dunne

says
he

Ay

and
*NL*
done
says
I.
Gob
,
he
'll
come
home
by
weeping
cross
one
of
those
days
,
*NL*
I
'm
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
you
see
that
bloody
lunatic
Breen
round
there
?
says
Alf

U.
p

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

says
J.
J.
Looking
for
a
private
detective
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
says
Ned
.
And
he
wanted
right
go
wrong
to
address
the
court
only
*NL*
Corny
Kelleher
got
round
him
telling
him
to
get
the
handwriting
examined
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ten
thousand
pounds
,
says
Alf
,
laughing
.
God
,
I
'd
give
anything
to
*NL*
hear
him
before
a
judge
and
jury
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Was
it
you
did
it
,
Alf
?
says
Joe
.
The
truth
,
the
whole
truth
and
*NL*
nothing
but
the
truth
,
so
help
you
Jimmy
Johnson
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Me
?
says
Alf
.
Do
n't
cast
your
nasturtiums
on
my
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Whatever
statement
you
make
,
says
Joe
,
will
be
taken
down
in
evidence
*NL*
against
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
an
action
would
lie
,
says
J.
J
.
It
implies
that
he
is
not
*NL*
_
compos

.
U.
p

*NL*
*NL*

Compos

your

says
Alf

laughing
.
Do
you
know
that
he
's
balmy
?
*NL*
Look
at
his
head
.
Do
you
know
that
some
mornings
he
has
to
get
his
hat
*NL*
on
with
a
shoehorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
says
J.
J.
,
but
the
truth
of
a
libel
is
no
defence
to
an
*NL*
indictment
for
publishing
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ha
ha
,
Alf
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Still
,
says
Bloom
,
on
account
of
the
poor
woman
,
I
mean
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pity
about
her
,
says
the
citizen
.
Or
any
other
woman
marries
a
half
*NL*
and
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
half
and
half
?
says
Bloom
.
Do
you
mean
he
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
Half
and
half
I
mean
,
says
the
citizen
.
A
fellow
that
's
neither
fish
*NL*
nor
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nor
good
red
herring
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
what
's
I
mean
,
says
the
citizen
.
A
pishogue
,
if
you
know
what
*NL*
that
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
Begob
I
saw
there
was
trouble
coming
.
And
Bloom
explaining
he
meant
on
*NL*
account
of
it
being
cruel
for
the
wife
having
to
go
round
after
the
*NL*
old
stuttering
fool
.
Cruelty
to
animals
so
it
is
to
let
that
bloody
*NL*
povertystricken
Breen
out
on
grass
with
his
beard
out
tripping
him
,
*NL*
bringing
down
the
rain
.
And
she
with
her
nose
cockahoop
after
she
*NL*
married
him
because
a
cousin
of
his
old
fellow

was
pewopener
to
the
*NL*
pope
.
Picture

*NL*
Holy
Father

has
left
the
quay
and
gone
to
Moss
street

And
who
was
*NL*
he
,
tell
us
?
A
nobody
,
two
pair
back
and
passages
,
at
seven
shillings
a
*NL*
week
,
and
he
covered
with
all
kinds
of
breastplates
bidding
defiance
to
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
moreover
,
says
J.
J.
,
a
postcard
is
publication
.
It
was
held
to
*NL*
be
sufficient
evidence
of
malice
in
the
testcase
Sadgrove
v.
Hole
.
In
my
*NL*
opinion
an
action
might
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
and
eightpence

please

Who
wants
your
opinion
?
Let
us
drink
our

and
Corny
Kelleher
with
his

looking

talking
to

like

trying

What

Do

Swindled

Poor

*NL*
*NL*

Heart

Tell
him

of
woe
about

*NL*
of

and
a
sick

a

and

Reuben

*NL*
the

taking
off
the

letting

How

*NL*
Ten

And

Scandalous

Leave
the

No

How

and
ask

to
make
an

A
poor
hardworking
*NL*
industrious

I
dismiss
the

*NL*
*NL*
And
whereas
on
the
sixteenth
day
of
the
month
of

oxeyed
goddess
and
*NL*
in
the
third
week
after
the
feastday
of
the
Holy

Undivided

*NL*
the
daughter
of

,
the
virgin
moon
being
then
in
her
first
*NL*
quarter
,
it
came
to
pass
that
those
learned
judges
repaired
them
to
the
*NL*
halls
of
law
.
There
master
Courtenay
,
sitting
in
his
own
chamber

gave
*NL*
his
rede
and
master
Justice
Andrews
,
sitting
without
a
jury
in
the
*NL*
probate
court
,
weighed
well
and
pondered
the
claim
of
the
first
*NL*
chargeant
upon
the
property
in
the
matter
of
the
will
propounded
and
*NL*
final
testamentary

the

Halliday
,
vintner

deceased

versus
Livingstone

*NL*
an
infant

of
unsound
mind
,
and
another
.
And
to
the
solemn
court
of
*NL*
Green
street
there
came
sir
Frederick
the
Falconer
.
And
he
sat
him
there
*NL*
about
the
hour
of
five
o'clock
to
administer
the
law
of
the
brehons
at
*NL*
the
commission
for
all
that
and
those
parts
to
be
holden
in
and
for
the
*NL*
county
of
the
city
of
Dublin
.
And
there
sat
with
him
the
high
sinhedrim
*NL*
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
Iar
,
for
every
tribe
one
man
,
of
the
tribe
of
*NL*
Patrick
and
of
the
tribe
of
Hugh
and
of
the
tribe
of
Owen
and
of
the
*NL*
tribe
of
Conn
and
of
the
tribe
of
Oscar
and
of
the
tribe
of
Fergus
and
*NL*
of
the
tribe
of
Finn
and
of
the
tribe
of
Dermot
and
of
the
tribe
of
*NL*
Cormac
and
of
the
tribe
of
Kevin
and
of
the
tribe
of
Caolte
and
of
the
*NL*
tribe
of
Ossian
,
there
being
in
all
twelve
good
men
and
true
.
And
he
*NL*
conjured
them
by
Him
who
died
on
rood
that
they
should
well
and
*NL*
truly
try
and
true
deliverance
make
in
the
issue
joined
between
their
*NL*
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
true
verdict
*NL*
give
according
to
the
evidence
so
help
them
God
and
kiss
the
book
.
And
*NL*
they
rose
in
their
seats
,
those
twelve
of
Iar
,
and
they
swore
by
*NL*
the
name
of
Him
Who
is
from
everlasting
that
they
would
do
His
*NL*
rightwiseness
.
And
straightway
the
minions
of
the
law
led
forth
from
*NL*
their
donjon
keep
one
whom
the
sleuthhounds
of
justice
had
apprehended
*NL*
in
consequence
of
information
received
.
And
they
shackled
him
hand
and
*NL*
foot
and
would
take
of
him
ne
bail
ne
mainprise
but
preferred
a
charge
*NL*
against
him
for
he
was
a
malefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*

Those
are
nice
things

lets
on
he
heard
nothing
and
he
starts
talking
with
Joe
,
*NL*
telling
him
he
need
n't
trouble
about
that
little
matter
till
the
first
*NL*
but
if
he
would
just
say
a
word
to
Mr
Crawford
.
And
so
Joe
swore
high
*NL*
and
holy
by
this
and
by
that
he
'd
do
the
devil
and
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
,
you
see
,
says
Bloom
,
for
an
advertisement
you
must
have
*NL*
repetition
.
That
's
the
whole
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Rely
on
me
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Swindling
the
peasants
,
says
the
citizen
,
and
the
poor
of
Ireland
.
We
*NL*
want
no
more
strangers
in
our
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
I
'm
sure
that
will
be
all
right
,
Hynes
,
says
Bloom
.
It
's
just
that
*NL*
Keyes
,
you
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Consider
that
done
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Very
kind
of
you
,
says
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
strangers
,
says
the
citizen
.
Our
own
fault
.
We
let
them
come
in
.
*NL*
We
brought
them
in
.
The
adulteress
and
her
paramour
brought
the
Saxon
*NL*

here

_
says
J.
J.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Bloom
letting
on
to
be
awfully
deeply
interested
in
nothing
,
a
*NL*
spider
's
web
in
the
corner
behind
the
barrel
,
and
the
citizen
scowling
*NL*
after
him
and
the
old
dog
at
his
feet
looking
up
to
know
who
to
bite
and
*NL*
when
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
dishonoured
wife
,
says
the
citizen
,
that
's
what
's
the
cause
of
all
*NL*
our
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
here
she
is
,
says
Alf
,
that
was
giggling
over
the
_
Police
Gazette
_
*NL*
with
Terry
on
the
counter
,
in
all
her
warpaint
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
a
squint
at
her
,
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
was
it
only
one
of
the
smutty
yankee
pictures
Terry
borrows
off
*NL*
of
Corny
Kelleher

Secrets

Norman

and

*NL*
and
Norman

Tupper
bouncing

just

after
she
doing

with

*NL*
*NL*
--
O

says
Joe

*NL*

There

says
I.
Get

off

*NL*
*NL*
So
anyhow
in
came
John
Wyse
Nolan
and
Lenehan
with
him
with
a
face
on
*NL*
him
as
long
as
a

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
says
the
citizen
,
what
's
the
latest
from
the
scene
of
action
?
*NL*
What
did
those
tinkers
in
the
city
hall
at
their
caucus
meeting
decide
*NL*
about
the
Irish
language
?
*NL*
*NL*
O'Nolan
,
clad
in
shining
armour
,
low
bending
made
obeisance
to
the
*NL*
puissant
and
high
and
mighty
chief
of
all
Erin
and
did
him
to
wit
of
*NL*
that
which
had
befallen
,
how
that
the
grave
elders
of
the
most
obedient
*NL*
city
,
second
of
the
realm
,
had
met
them
in
the
tholsel
,
and
there
,
after
*NL*
due
prayers
to
the
gods
who
dwell
in
ether
supernal
,
had
taken
solemn
*NL*
counsel
whereby
they
might
,
if
so
be
it
might
be
,
bring
once
more
into
*NL*
honour
among
mortal
men
the
winged
speech
of
the

Gael
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
on
the
march
,
says
the
citizen
.
To
hell
with
the
bloody
brutal
*NL*
Sassenachs
and
their
_
patois
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
So
J.
J.
puts
in
a
word
,
doing
the
toff
about
one
story
was
good
till
*NL*
you
heard
another
and
blinking
facts
and
the
Nelson
policy
,
putting
your
*NL*
blind
eye
to
the
telescope
and
drawing
up
a
bill
of
attainder
to
impeach
*NL*
a
nation
,
and
Bloom
trying
to
back
him
up
moderation
and
botheration
and
*NL*
their
colonies
and
their
civilisation
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Their
syphilisation
,
you
mean
,
says
the
citizen
.
To
hell
with
*NL*
them
!
The

of

God
light
sideways

No

says
J.
J.
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
're
not
European
,
says
the
citizen
.
I
was
in
Europe
with
Kevin
*NL*
Egan
of
Paris
.
You
would
n't
see
a
trace
of
them
or
their

*NL*
anywhere
in
Europe
except
in
a
_
cabinet
d'aisance
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
John
Wyse
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Full
many
a

is
born
to

unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
Lenehan
that
knows
a
bit
of
the
lingo
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Conspuez
les
Anglais
!
Perfide
Albion
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
and
then
lifted
he
in
his
rude
great
brawny
strengthy
hands
the
*NL*
medher
of
dark
strong
foamy
ale
and
,
uttering
his
tribal
slogan
_
Lamh
*NL*
Dearg
Abu
_
,
he
drank
to
the
undoing
of
his
foes
,
a
race
of
mighty
*NL*
valorous
heroes
,
rulers
of
the
waves
,
who
sit
on
thrones
of
alabaster
*NL*
silent
as
the
deathless

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
up
with
you
,
says
I
to
Lenehan
.
You
look
like
a
fellow
that
had
*NL*
lost
a
bob
and
found
a
tanner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Gold

says
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who

Mr

says
Terry

*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Throwaway

says
he
,
at
twenty

.
A
rank
outsider
.
And
the
rest
*NL*
nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
Bass

?
says
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Still
running

says
he
.
We
're
all

Boylan

two

*NL*

*NL*
--
I

Takes

So
he
went
over

left
to
see

there
was

could

arguing

with

*NL*
sticking

*NL*
*NL*

There

And

And

for
grabbing
the
*NL*
holding
of
an
evicted
tenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hear
,
hear
to
that
,
says
John
Wyse
.
What
will
you
have
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
An
imperial
yeomanry
,
says
Lenehan
,
to
celebrate
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Half
one
,
Terry
,
says
John
Wyse
,
and
a
hands
up
.
Terry
!
Are
you
*NL*
asleep
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
,
says
Terry
.
Small
whisky
and
bottle
of
Allsop
.
Right
,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hanging
over
the
bloody
paper
with
Alf
looking
for
spicy
bits
instead
of
*NL*
attending
to
the
general
public
.
Picture
of
a
butting
match
,
trying
to
*NL*
crack
their
bloody
skulls
,
one
chap
going
for
the
other
with
his
head
*NL*
down
like
a
bull
at
a
gate
.
And
another
one
:
_
Black
Beast
Burned
in
*NL*
Omaha
,
Ga
_
.
A
lot
of
Deadwood
Dicks
in
slouch
hats
and
they
firing
at
a
*NL*
Sambo
strung
up
in
a
tree
with
his
tongue
out
and
a
bonfire
under
*NL*
him
.
Gob
,
they
ought
to
drown
him
in
the
sea
after
and
electrocute
and
*NL*
crucify
him
to
make
sure
of
their
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
what
about
the
fighting
navy
,
says
Ned
,
that
keeps
our
foes
at
*NL*
bay
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
tell
you
what
about
it
,
says
the
citizen
.
Hell
upon
earth
it
is
.
*NL*
Read
the
revelations
that
's
going
on
in
the
papers
about
flogging
on
*NL*
the
training
ships
at
Portsmouth
.
A
fellow
writes
that
calls
himself
*NL*
_
Disgusted
One
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
starts
telling
us
about
corporal
punishment
and
about
the
crew
*NL*
of
tars
and
officers
and
rearadmirals
drawn
up
in
cocked
hats
and
the
*NL*
parson
with
his
protestant
bible
to
witness
punishment
and
a
young
lad
*NL*
brought
out
,
howling
for
his
ma
,
and
they
tie
him
down
on
the
buttend
of
*NL*
a
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
rump
and
dozen
,
says
the
citizen
,
was
what
that
old
ruffian
sir
John
*NL*
Beresford
called
it
but
the
modern
God
's
Englishman
calls
it
caning
on
*NL*
the
breech
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
John
Wyse
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
a
custom
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
telling
us
the
master
at
arms
comes
along
with
a
long
cane
*NL*
and
he
draws
out
and
he
flogs
the
bloody
backside
off
of
the
poor
lad
*NL*
till
he
yells
meila
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
your
glorious
British
navy
,
says
the
citizen
,
that
bosses
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellows
that
never
will
be
slaves
,
with
the
only
hereditary
chamber
*NL*
on
the
face
of
God
's
earth
and
their
land
in
the
hands
of
a
dozen
*NL*
gamehogs
and
cottonball
barons
.
That
's
the
great
empire
they
boast
about
*NL*
of
drudges
and
whipped
serfs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
On
which
the
sun
never
rises
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
the
tragedy
of
it
is
,
says
the
citizen
,
they
believe
it
.
The
*NL*
unfortunate
yahoos
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
believe
in
rod
,
the
scourger
almighty
,
creator
of
hell
upon
earth
,
*NL*
and
in
Jacky
Tar
,
the
son
of
a
gun
,
who
was
conceived
of
unholy
boast
,
*NL*
born
of
the
fighting
navy
,
suffered
under
rump
and
dozen
,
was
scarified
,
*NL*
flayed
and
curried
,
yelled
like
bloody
hell
,
the
third
day
he
arose
*NL*
again
from
the
bed
,
steered
into
haven
,
sitteth
on
his
beamend
till
*NL*
further
orders
whence
he
shall
come
to
drudge
for
a
living
and
be
paid
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
,
says
Bloom
,
is
n't
discipline
the
same
everywhere
.
I
mean
would
n't
*NL*
it
be
the
same
here
if
you
put
force
against
force
?
*NL*
*NL*
Did
n't
I
tell
you
?
As
true
as
I
'm
drinking
this
porter
if
he
was
at
his
*NL*
last
gasp
he
'd
try
to
downface
you
that
dying
was
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
'll
put
force
against
force
,
says
the
citizen
.
We
have
our
greater
*NL*
Ireland
beyond
the
sea
.
They
were
driven
out
of
house
and
home
in
the
*NL*
black
47
.
Their
mudcabins
and
their
shielings
by
the
roadside
were
laid
*NL*
low
by
the
batteringram
and
the
_
Times
_
rubbed
its
hands
and
told
the
*NL*
whitelivered
Saxons
there
would
soon
be
as
few
Irish
in
Ireland
as
*NL*
redskins
in
America
.
Even
the
Grand
Turk
sent
us
his
piastres
.
But
the
*NL*
Sassenach
tried
to
starve
the
nation
at
home
while
the
land
was
full
*NL*
of
crops
that
the
British
hyenas
bought
and
sold
in
Rio
de
Janeiro
.
Ay
,
*NL*
they
drove
out
the
peasants
in
hordes
.
Twenty
thousand
of
them
died
in
*NL*
the
coffinships
.
But
those
that
came
to
the
land
of
the
free
remember
*NL*
the
land
of
bondage
.
And
they
will
come
again
and
with
a
vengeance
,
no
*NL*
cravens
,
the
sons
of
Granuaile
,
the
champions
of
Kathleen
ni
Houlihan
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Perfectly
true
,
says
Bloom
.
But
my
point
was
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
are
a
long
time
waiting
for
that
day
,
citizen
,
says
Ned
.
Since
the
*NL*
poor
old
woman
told
us
that
the
French
were
on
the
sea
and
landed
at
*NL*
Killala
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
says
John
Wyse
.
We
fought
for
the
royal
Stuarts
that
reneged
us
*NL*
against
the
Williamites
and
they
betrayed
us
.
Remember
Limerick
and
the
*NL*
broken
treatystone
.
We
gave
our
best
blood
to
France
and
Spain
,
the
*NL*
wild
geese
.
Fontenoy
,
eh
?
And
Sarsfield
and
O'Donnell
,
duke
of
Tetuan
*NL*
in
Spain
,
and
Ulysses
Browne
of
Camus
that
was
fieldmarshal
to
Maria
*NL*
Teresa
.
But
what
did
we
ever
get
for
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
French
!
says
the
citizen
.
Set
of
dancing
masters
!
Do
you
know
*NL*
what
it
is
?
They
were
never
worth
a
roasted
fart
to
Ireland
.
Are
n't
they
*NL*
trying
to
make
an
_
Entente
cordiale
_
now
at
Tay
Pay
's
dinnerparty
with
*NL*
perfidious
Albion
?
Firebrands
of
Europe
and
they
always
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Conspuez
les
Francais
_
,
says
Lenehan
,
nobbling
his
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
as
for
the
Prooshians
and
the
Hanoverians
,
says
Joe
,
have
n't
we
*NL*
had
enough
of
those
sausageeating
bastards
on
the
throne
from
George
the
*NL*
elector
down
to
the
German
lad
and
the
flatulent
old
bitch
that
's
dead
?
*NL*
*NL*
Jesus
,
I
had
to
laugh
at
the
way
he
came
out
with
that
about
the
old
one
*NL*
with
the
winkers
on
her
,
blind
drunk
in
her
royal
palace
every
night
of
*NL*
God
,
old
Vic
,
with
her
jorum
of
mountain
dew
and
her
coachman
carting
*NL*
her
up
body
and
bones
to
roll
into
bed
and
she
pulling
him
by
the
*NL*
whiskers
and
singing
him
old
bits
of
songs
about
_
Ehren
on
the
Rhine
_
*NL*
and
come
where
the
boose
is
cheaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
says
J.
J
.
We
have
Edward
the
peacemaker
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
that
to
a
fool
,
says
the
citizen
.
There
's
a
bloody
sight
more
pox
*NL*
than
pax
about
that
boyo
.
Edward
Guelph-Wettin
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
do
you
think
,
says
Joe
,
of
the
holy
boys
,
the
priests
*NL*
and
bishops
of
Ireland
doing
up
his
room
in
Maynooth
in
His
Satanic
*NL*
Majesty
's
racing
colours
and
sticking
up
pictures
of
all
the
horses
his
*NL*
jockeys
rode
.
The
earl
of
Dublin
,
no
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
ought
to
have
stuck
up
all
the
women
he
rode
himself
,
says
little
*NL*
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
says
J.
J.
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Considerations
of
space
influenced
their
lordships
'
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Will
you
try
another
,
citizen
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
sir
,
says
he
.
I
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
?
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Beholden
to
you
,
Joe
,
says
I.
May
your
shadow
never
grow
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Repeat
that
dose
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bloom
was
talking
and
talking
with
John
Wyse
and
he
quite
excited
with
*NL*
his
dunducketymudcoloured
mug
on
him
and
his
old
plumeyes
rolling
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Persecution
,
says
he
,
all
the
history
of
the
world
is
full
of
it
.
*NL*
Perpetuating
national
hatred
among
nations
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
do
you
know
what
a
nation
means
?
says
John
Wyse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
says
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
it
?
says
John
Wyse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
nation
?
says
Bloom
.
A
nation
is
the
same
people
living
in
the
same
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
By
God
,
then
,
says
Ned
,
laughing
,
if
that
's
so
I
'm
a
nation
for
I
'm
*NL*
living
in
the
same
place
for
the
past
five
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
of
course
everyone
had
the
laugh
at
Bloom
and
says
he
,
trying
to
muck
*NL*
out
of
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Or
also
living
in
different
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
covers
my
case
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
your
nation
if
I
may
ask
?
says
the
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ireland
,
says
Bloom
.
I
was
born
here
.
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
citizen
said
nothing
only
cleared
the
spit
out
of
his
gullet
and
,
*NL*
gob
,
he
spat
a
Red
bank
oyster
out
of
him
right
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
you
with
the
push
,
Joe
,
says
he
,
taking
out
his
handkerchief
to
*NL*
swab
himself
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
you
are
,
citizen
,
says
Joe
.
Take
that
in
your
right
hand
and
*NL*
repeat
after
me
the
following
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
muchtreasured
and
intricately
embroidered
ancient
Irish
facecloth
*NL*
attributed
to
Solomon
of
Droma
and
Manus
Tomaltach
og
MacDonogh
,
authors
*NL*
of
the
Book
of
Ballymote
,
was
then
carefully
produced
and
called
forth
*NL*
prolonged
admiration
.
No
need
to
dwell
on
the
legendary
beauty
of
the
*NL*
cornerpieces
,
the
acme
of
art
,
wherein
one
can
distinctly
discern
each
*NL*
of
the
four
evangelists
in
turn
presenting
to
each
of
the
four
masters
*NL*
his
evangelical
symbol
,
a

,
a
North

said

*NL*

*NL*

text

_
*NL*
pasted

The

Did

that
skit
*NL*
in
the
_
United
Irishman
_
today
about
that
Zulu

that

visiting
*NL*
England
?
*NL*

What
's
that
?
says

.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
citizen
takes
up
one
of
his
paraphernalia
papers
and
he
starts
*NL*
reading
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
delegation
of
the
chief
cotton
magnates
of
Manchester
was
presented
*NL*
yesterday
to
His
Majesty
the
Alaki
of
Abeakuta
by
Gold
Stick
in
Waiting
,
*NL*
Lord
Walkup
of
Walkup
on
Eggs
,
to
tender
to
His
Majesty
the
heartfelt
*NL*
thanks
of
British
traders
for
the
facilities
afforded
them
in
his
*NL*
dominions
.
The
delegation
partook
of
luncheon
at
the
conclusion
of
which
*NL*
the
dusky
potentate
,
in
the
course
of
a
happy
speech
,
freely
translated
*NL*
by
the
British
chaplain
,
the
reverend
Ananias
Praisegod
Barebones
,
*NL*
tendered
his
best
thanks
to
Massa
Walkup
and
emphasised
the
cordial
*NL*
relations
existing
between
Abeakuta
and
the
British
empire
,
stating
that
*NL*
he
treasured
as
one
of
his
dearest
possessions
an
illuminated
bible
,
*NL*
the
volume
of
the
word
of
God
and
the
secret
of
England
's
greatness
,
*NL*
graciously
presented
to
him
by
the
white
chief
woman
,
the
great
squaw
*NL*
Victoria
,
with
a
personal
dedication
from
the
august
hand
of
the
Royal
*NL*
Donor
.
The
Alaki
then
drank
a
lovingcup
of
firstshot
usquebaugh
to
the
*NL*
toast
_
Black
and
White
_
from
the
skull
of
his
immediate
predecessor
in
*NL*
the
dynasty
Kakachakachak
,
surnamed
Forty
Warts
,
after
which
he
visited
*NL*
the
chief
factory
of
Cottonopolis
and
signed
his
mark
in
the
visitors
'
*NL*
book
,
subsequently
executing
a
charming
old
Abeakutic
wardance
,
in
the
*NL*
course
of
which
he
swallowed
several
knives
and
forks
,
amid
hilarious
*NL*
applause
from
the
girl
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Widow
woman
,
says
Ned
.
I
would
n't
doubt
her
.
Wonder
did
he
put
that
*NL*
bible
to
the
same
use
as
I
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Same
only
more
so
,
says
Lenehan
.
And
thereafter
in
that
fruitful
land
*NL*
the
broadleaved
mango
flourished
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
by
Griffith
?
says
John
Wyse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
says
the
citizen
.
It
's
not
signed
Shanganagh
.
It
's
only
*NL*
initialled
:
P.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
a
very
good
initial
too
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
how
it
's
worked
,
says
the
citizen
.
Trade
follows
the
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
says
J.
J.
,
if
they
're
any
worse
than
those
Belgians
in
the
*NL*
Congo
Free
State
they
must
be
bad
.
Did
you
read
that
report
by
a
man
*NL*
what
's
this
his
name
is
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Casement
,
says
the
citizen
.
He
's
an
Irishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
that
's
the
man
,
says
J.
J.
Raping
the
women
and
girls
and
*NL*
flogging
the
natives
on
the
belly
to
squeeze
all
the
red
rubber
they
can
*NL*
out
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
where
he
's
gone
,
says
Lenehan
,
cracking
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
?
says
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bloom
,
says
he
.
The
courthouse
is
a
blind
.
He
had
a
few
bob
on
*NL*
_
Throwaway
_
and
he
's
gone
to
gather
in
the
shekels
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
it
that
whiteeyed
kaffir
?
says
the
citizen
,
that
never
backed
a
*NL*
horse
in
anger
in
his
life
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
where
he
's
gone
,
says
Lenehan
.
I
met
Bantam
Lyons
going
to
back
*NL*
that
horse
only
I
put
him
off
it
and
he
told
me
Bloom
gave
him
the
tip
.
*NL*
Bet
you
what
you
like
he
has
a
hundred
shillings
to
five
on
.
He
's
the
*NL*
only
man
in
Dublin
has
it
.
A
dark
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
a
bloody
dark
horse
himself
,
says
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mind
,
Joe
,
says
I.
Show
us
the
entrance
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
you
are
,
says
Terry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Goodbye
Ireland
I
'm
going
to
Gort
.
So
I
just
went
round
the
back
of
*NL*
the
yard
to
pumpship
and
begob
-LRB-
hundred
shillings
to
five
-RRB-
while
I
was
*NL*
letting
off
my
_
-LRB-
Throwaway
_
twenty
to
-RRB-
letting
off
my
load
gob
says
I
*NL*
to
myself
I
knew
he
was
uneasy
in
his
-LRB-
two
pints
off
of
Joe
and
one
in
*NL*
Slattery
's
off
-RRB-
in
his
mind
to
get
off
the
mark
to
-LRB-
hundred
shillings
*NL*
is
five
quid
-RRB-
and
when
they
were
in
the
-LRB-
dark
horse
-RRB-
pisser
Burke
was
*NL*
telling
me
card
party
and
letting
on
the
child
was
sick
-LRB-
gob
,
must
have
*NL*
done
about
a
gallon
-RRB-
flabbyarse
of
a
wife
speaking
down
the
tube
_
she
's
*NL*
better
_
or
_
she
's
_
-LRB-
ow
!
-RRB-
all
a
plan
so
he
could
vamoose
with
the
pool
if
*NL*
he
won
or
-LRB-
Jesus
,
full
up
I
was
-RRB-
trading
without
a
licence

*NL*
the
last
of
it
-RRB-
Jerusalem
-LRB-
ah

-RRB-
cuckoos
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
anyhow
when
I
got
back
they
were
at
it
dingdong
,
John
Wyse
saying
it
*NL*
was
Bloom
gave
the
ideas
for
Sinn
Fein
to
Griffith
to
put
in
his
paper
*NL*
all
kinds
of
jerrymandering
,
packed
juries
and
swindling
the
taxes
off
*NL*
of
the
government
and
appointing
consuls
all
over
the
world
to
walk
*NL*
about
selling
Irish
industries
.
Robbing
Peter
to
pay
Paul
.
Gob
,
that
*NL*
puts
the
bloody
kybosh
on
it
if
old
sloppy
eyes
is
mucking
up
the
show
.
*NL*
Give
us
a
bloody
chance
.
God
save
Ireland
from
the
likes
of
that
bloody
*NL*
mouseabout
.
Mr
Bloom
with
his
argol
bargol
.
And
his
old
fellow
before
*NL*
him
perpetrating
frauds
,
old
Methusalem
Bloom
,
the
robbing
bagman
,
that
*NL*
poisoned
himself
with
the
prussic
acid
after
he
swamping
the
country
*NL*
with
his
baubles
and
his
penny
diamonds
.
Loans
by
post
on
easy
terms
.
*NL*
Any
amount
of
money
advanced
on
note
of
hand
.
Distance
no
object
.
No
*NL*
security
.
Gob
,
he
's
like
Lanty
MacHale
's
goat
that
'd
go
a
piece
of
the
*NL*
road
with
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
it
's
a
fact
,
says
John
Wyse
.
And
there
's
the
man
now
that
'll
*NL*
tell
you
all
about
it
,
Martin
Cunningham
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
the
castle
car
drove
up
with
Martin
on
it
and
Jack
Power
*NL*
with
him
and
a
fellow
named
Crofter
or
Crofton
,
pensioner
out
of
*NL*
the
collector
general
's
,
an
orangeman
Blackburn
does
have
on
the
*NL*
registration
and
he
drawing
his
pay
or
Crawford
gallivanting
around
the
*NL*
country
at
the
king
's
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
reached
the
rustic
hostelry
and
alighted
from
their
*NL*
palfreys
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ho
,
varlet
!
cried
he
,
who
by
his
mien
seemed
the
leader
of
the
party
.
*NL*
Saucy
knave
!
To
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
knocked
loudly
with
his
swordhilt
upon
the
open
lattice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mine
host
came
forth
at
the
summons
,
girding
him
with
his
tabard
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
you
good
den
,
my
masters
,
said
he
with
an
obsequious
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bestir
thyself
,
sirrah
!
cried
he
who
had
knocked
.
Look
to
our
steeds
.
*NL*
And
for
ourselves
give
us
of
your
best
for
ifaith
we
need
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Lackaday
,
good
masters
,
said
the
host
,
my
poor
house
has
but
a
bare
*NL*
larder
.
I
know
not
what
to
offer
your
lordships
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
now
,
fellow
?
cried
the
second
of
the
party
,
a
man
of
pleasant
*NL*
countenance
,
So
servest
thou
the
king
's
messengers
,
master
Taptun
?
*NL*
*NL*
An
instantaneous
change
overspread
the
landlord
's
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Cry
you
mercy
,
gentlemen
,
he
said
humbly
.
An
you
be
the
king
's
*NL*
messengers
-LRB-
God
shield
His
Majesty
!
-RRB-
you
shall
not
want
for
aught
.
The
*NL*
king
's
friends
-LRB-
God
bless
His
Majesty
!
-RRB-
shall
not
go
afasting
in
my
*NL*
house
I
warrant
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
about
!
cried
the
traveller
who
had
not
spoken
,
a
lusty
*NL*
trencherman
by
his
aspect
.
Hast
aught
to
give
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mine
host
bowed
again
as
he
made
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
say
you
,
good
masters
,
to
a
squab
pigeon
pasty
,
some
collops
of
*NL*
venison
,
a
saddle
of
veal
,
widgeon
with
crisp
hog
's
bacon
,
a
boar
's
head
*NL*
with
pistachios
,
a
bason
of
jolly
custard
,
a
medlar
tansy
and
a
flagon
*NL*
of
old
Rhenish
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Gadzooks
!
cried
the
last
speaker
.
That
likes
me
well
.
Pistachios
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Aha
!
cried
he
of
the
pleasant
countenance
.
A
poor
house
and
a
bare
*NL*
larder
,
quotha
!
'T
is
a
merry
rogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
comes
Martin
asking
where
was
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
is
he
?
says
Lenehan
.
Defrauding
widows
and
orphans
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
n't
that
a
fact
,
says
John
Wyse
,
what
I
was
telling
the
citizen
*NL*
about
Bloom
and
the
Sinn
Fein
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
so
,
says
Martin
.
Or
so
they
allege
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
made
those
allegations
?
says
Alf
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
,
says
Joe
.
I
'm
the
alligator
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
after
all
,
says
John
Wyse
,
why
ca
n't
a
jew
love
his
country
like
*NL*
the
next
fellow
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
not
?
says
J.
J.
,
when
he
's
quite
sure
which
country
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
he
a
jew
or
a
gentile
or
a
holy
Roman
or
a
swaddler
or
what
the
*NL*
hell
is
he
?
says
Ned
.
Or
who
is
he
?
No
offence
,
Crofton
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
is
Junius
?
says
J.
J.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
do
n't
want
him
,
says
Crofter
the
Orangeman
or
presbyterian
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
a
perverted
jew
,
says
Martin
,
from
a
place
in
Hungary
and
it
was
*NL*
he
drew
up
all
the
plans
according
to
the
Hungarian
system
.
We
know
that
*NL*
in
the
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
n't
he
a
cousin
of
Bloom
the
dentist
?
says
Jack
Power
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
at
all
,
says
Martin
.
Only
namesakes
.
His
name
was
Virag
,
the
*NL*
father
's
name
that
poisoned
himself
.
He
changed
it
by
deedpoll
,
the
*NL*
father
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
the
new
Messiah
for
Ireland
!
says
the
citizen
.
Island
of
saints
*NL*
and
sages
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
they
're
still
waiting
for
their
redeemer
,
says
Martin
.
For
that
*NL*
matter
so
are
we
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
says
J.
J.
,
and
every
male
that
's
born
they
think
it
may
be
their
*NL*
Messiah
.
And
every
jew
is
in
a
tall
state
of
excitement
,
I
believe
,
till
*NL*
he
knows
if
he
's
a
father
or
a
mother

O

by

says
Ned

you
should
have
seen
Bloom
before
that
son
of
his
*NL*
that
died

born
.
I
met
him
one
day
in
the
south

markets
buying
a
*NL*
tin
of
Neave
's
food
six
weeks
before

Do

I

*NL*
*NL*

Well

two

suspect

*NL*
*NL*
Gob

there

spoken
in

One
of

mixed
*NL*
middlings
he
is
.
Lying
up
in
the
hotel
Pisser
was
telling
me
once
a
*NL*
month
with
headache
like
a
totty
with
her
courses
.
Do
you
know
what
I
'm
*NL*
telling
you
?
It
'd
be
an
act
of
God
to
take
a
hold
of
a
fellow
the
like
*NL*
of
that
and
throw
him
in
the
bloody
sea
.
Justifiable
homicide
,
so
it
*NL*
would
.
Then
sloping
off
with
his
five
quid
without
putting
up
a
pint
of
*NL*
stuff
like
a
man
.
Give
us
your
blessing

Not

much
as
would
blind
your
*NL*
eye

tossed

rising

the

stood
off
forward

set

to

A

drew
*NL*
nigh
to
starboard
and
to
larboard
and
,
clinging
to
the
sides
of
*NL*
the
noble
bark
,
they
linked
their
shining
forms
as
doth
the
cunning
*NL*
wheelwright
when
he
fashions
about
the
heart
of
his
wheel
the
*NL*
equidistant
rays
whereof
each
one
is
sister
to
another
and
he
binds
them

set
them

laughed

sporting
in

the

clave

waves

But

A
large
and
appreciative
gathering
of
friends
and
acquaintances
from
*NL*
the
metropolis
and
greater
Dublin
assembled
in
their
thousands
to
bid
*NL*
farewell
to
Nagyasagos
uram
Lipoti
Virag
,
late
of
Messrs
Alexander
*NL*
Thom
's
,
printers
to
His
Majesty
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
departure
*NL*
for
the
distant
clime
of
Szazharminczbrojugulyas-Dugulas
-LRB-
Meadow
of
*NL*
Murmuring
Waters
-RRB-
.
The
ceremony
which
went
off
with
great
_
eclat
_
was
*NL*
characterised
by
the
most
affecting
cordiality
.
An
illuminated
scroll
*NL*
of
ancient
Irish
vellum
,
the
work
of
Irish
artists
,
was
presented
to
*NL*
the
distinguished
phenomenologist
on
behalf
of
a
large
section
of
the
*NL*
community
and
was
accompanied
by
the
gift
of
a
silver
casket
,
tastefully
*NL*
executed
in
the
style
of
ancient
Celtic
ornament
,
a
work
which
reflects
*NL*
every
credit
on
the
makers
,
Messrs
Jacob
_
agus
_
Jacob
.
The
departing
*NL*
guest
was
the
recipient
of
a
hearty
ovation
,
many
of
those
who
were
*NL*
present
being
visibly
moved
when
the
select
orchestra
of
Irish
pipes
*NL*
struck
up
the
wellknown
strains
of
_
Come
back
to
Erin
_
,
followed
*NL*
immediately
by
_
Rakoczsy
's
March
_
.
Tarbarrels
and
bonfires
were
lighted
*NL*
along
the
coastline
of
the
four
seas
on
the
summits
of
the
Hill
of
*NL*
Howth
,
Three
Rock
Mountain
,
Sugarloaf
,
Bray
Head
,
the
mountains
of
*NL*
Mourne
,
the
Galtees
,
the
Ox
and
Donegal
and
Sperrin
peaks
,
the
Nagles
*NL*
and
the

the

hills
,
the
reeks
of
M
Gillicuddy
,
Slieve
*NL*
Aughty
,
Slieve
Bernagh
and
Slieve
Bloom
.
Amid
cheers
that
rent
the
*NL*
welkin
,
responded
to
by
answering
cheers
from
a
big
muster
of
*NL*
henchmen
on
the
distant
Cambrian
and
Caledonian
hills
,
the
mastodontic
*NL*
pleasureship
slowly
moved
away
saluted
by
a
final
floral
tribute
from
*NL*
the
representatives
of
the
fair
sex
who
were
present
in
large
numbers
*NL*
while
,
as
it
proceeded
down
the
river
,
escorted
by
a
flotilla
of
barges
,
*NL*
the
flags
of
the
Ballast
office
and
Custom
House
were
dipped
in
salute
*NL*
as
were
also
those
of
the
electrical
power
station
at
the
*NL*
Pigeonhouse
and
the
Poolbeg
Light

Gob
,
the
devil
would
n't
stop
him
till
he
got
hold
of
the
bloody
tin
*NL*
anyhow
and
out
with
him
and
little
Alf
hanging
on
to
his
elbow
and
he
*NL*
shouting
like
a
stuck
pig
,
as
good
as
any
bloody
play
in
the
Queen
's
*NL*
royal
theatre
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Where
is
he
till
I
murder
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
Ned
and

paralysed
with
the
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bloody

,
says
I
,
I
'll
be
in
for
the
last
gospel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
luck
would
have
it
the
jarvey
got
the
nag
's
head
round
the
other
*NL*
way
and
off
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Hold
on
,
citizen
,
says
Joe
.
Stop
!
*NL*
*NL*
Begob
he
drew
his
hand
and
made
a
swipe
and
let
fly
.
Mercy
of
God
the
*NL*
sun
was
in
his
eyes
or
he
'd
have
left
him
for
dead
.
Gob
,
he
near
sent
it
*NL*
into
the
county
Longford
.
The
bloody
nag
took
fright
and
the
old
*NL*
mongrel
after
the
car
like
bloody
hell
and
all
the
populace
shouting
and
*NL*
laughing
and
the
old
tinbox
clattering
along
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
catastrophe
was
terrific
and
instantaneous
in
its
effect
.
The
*NL*
observatory
of
Dunsink
registered
in
all
eleven
shocks
,
all
of
the
fifth
*NL*
grade
of
Mercalli
's
scale
,
and
there
is
no
record
extant
of
a
similar
*NL*
seismic
disturbance
in
our
island
since
the
earthquake
of
1534
,
the
year
*NL*
of
the
rebellion
of
Silken
Thomas
.
The
epicentre
appears
to
have
been
*NL*
that
part
of
the
metropolis
which
constitutes
the
Inn
's
Quay
ward
and
*NL*
parish
of
Saint
Michan
covering
a
surface
of
fortyone
acres
,
two
roods
*NL*
and
one
square
pole
or
perch
.
All
the
lordly
residences
in
the
vicinity
*NL*
of
the
palace
of
justice
were
demolished
and
that
noble
edifice
itself
,
*NL*
in
which
at
the
time
of
the
catastrophe
important
legal
debates
were
in
*NL*
progress
,
is
literally
a
mass
of
ruins
beneath
which
it
is
to
be
*NL*
feared
all
the
occupants
have
been
buried
alive
.
From
the
reports
of
*NL*
eyewitnesses
it
transpires
that
the
seismic
waves
were
accompanied
by
*NL*
a
violent
atmospheric
perturbation
of
cyclonic
character
.
An
article
of
*NL*
headgear
since
ascertained
to
belong
to
the
much
respected
clerk
of
the
*NL*
crown
and
peace
Mr
George
Fottrell
and
a
silk
umbrella
with
gold
handle
*NL*
with
the
engraved
initials
,
crest
,
coat
of

number
of
*NL*
the
erudite
and
worshipful
chairman
of
quarter
sessions
sir
Frederick
*NL*
Falkiner
,
recorder
of
Dublin
,
have
been
discovered
by
search
parties
*NL*
in
remote
parts
of
the
island
respectively
,
the
former
on
the
third
*NL*
basaltic
ridge
of
the
giant
's
causeway
,
the
latter
embedded
to
the
*NL*
extent
of
one
foot
three
inches
in
the
sandy
beach
of
Holeopen
bay
near
*NL*
the
old
head
of
Kinsale
.
Other
eyewitnesses
depose
that
they
observed
*NL*
an
incandescent
object
of
enormous
proportions
hurtling
through
the
*NL*
atmosphere
at
a
terrifying
velocity
in
a
trajectory
directed
southwest
*NL*
by
west
.
Messages
of
condolence
and
sympathy
are
being
hourly
received
*NL*
from
all
parts
of
the
different
continents
and
the
sovereign
pontiff
has
*NL*
been
graciously
pleased
to
decree
that
a
special
_
missa
pro

_
*NL*
shall
be
celebrated
simultaneously
by
the

You
never

like

it
in

your
born
puff

Gob
,
if
he
got
that
*NL*
lottery
ticket
on
the
side
of
his
poll
he
'd
remember
the
gold
cup
,
he
*NL*
would
so
,
but
begob
the
citizen
would
have
been
lagged
for
assault
and
*NL*
battery
and
Joe
for
aiding
and
abetting
.
The
jarvey
saved
his
life
by
*NL*
furious
driving
as
sure
as
God
made
Moses
.
What
?
O
,
Jesus
,
he
did
.
And
*NL*
he
let
a
volley
of
oaths
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
I
kill
him
,
says
he
,
or
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
shouting
to
the
bloody
dog
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
After
him
,
Garry
!
After
him
,
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
last
we
saw
was
the
bloody
car
rounding
the
corner
and
old
*NL*
sheepsface
on
it
gesticulating
and
the
bloody
mongrel
after
it
with
his
*NL*
lugs
back
for
all
he
was
bloody
well
worth
to
tear
him
limb
from
limb
.
*NL*
Hundred
to
five
!
Jesus
,
he
took
the
value
of
it
out
of
him
,
I
promise
*NL*
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
lo
,
there
came
about
them
all
a
great
brightness
and
they
beheld
*NL*
the
chariot
wherein
He
stood
ascend
to
heaven
.
And
they
beheld
Him
in
*NL*
the
chariot
,
clothed
upon
in
the
glory
of
the
brightness
,
having
raiment
*NL*
as
of
the
sun
,
fair
as
the
moon
and
terrible
that
for
awe
they
durst
not
*NL*
look
upon
Him
.
And
there
came
a
voice
out
of
heaven
,
calling
:
_
Elijah
!
*NL*
Elijah
!
_
And
He
answered
with
a
main
cry
:
_
Abba
!
Adonai
!
_
And
they
*NL*
beheld
Him
even
Him
,
ben
Bloom
Elijah
,
amid
clouds
of
angels
ascend
*NL*
to
the
glory
of
the
brightness
at
an
angle
of
fortyfive
degrees
over
*NL*
Donohoe
's
in
Little
Green
street
like
a
shot
off
a
shovel

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
evening
had
begun
to
fold
the
world
in
its
mysterious
*NL*
embrace
.
Far
away
in
the
west
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
last
glow
of
*NL*
all
too
fleeting
day
lingered
lovingly
on
sea
and
strand
,
on
the
proud
*NL*
promontory
of
dear
old
Howth
guarding
as
ever
the
waters
of
the
bay
,
on
*NL*
the
weedgrown
rocks
along
Sandymount
shore
and
,
last
but
not
least
,
on
*NL*
the
quiet
church
whence
there
streamed
forth
at
times
upon
the
stillness
*NL*
the
voice
of
prayer
to
her
who
is
in
her
pure
radiance
a
beacon
ever
to
*NL*
the
stormtossed
heart
of
man
,
Mary
,
star
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
girl
friends
were
seated
on
the
rocks
,
enjoying
the
evening
*NL*
scene
and
the
air
which
was
fresh
but
not
too
chilly
.
Many
a
time
and
*NL*
oft
were
they
wont
to
come
there
to
that
favourite
nook
to
have
a
cosy
*NL*
chat
beside
the
sparkling
waves
and
discuss
matters
feminine
,
Cissy
*NL*
Caffrey
and
Edy
Boardman
with
the
baby
in
the
pushcar
and
Tommy
and
*NL*
Jacky
Caffrey
,
two
little
curlyheaded
boys
,
dressed
in
sailor
suits
with
*NL*
caps
to
match
and
the
name
H.M.S.
Belleisle
printed
on
both
.
For
Tommy
*NL*
and
Jacky
Caffrey
were
twins
,
scarce
four
years
old
and
very
noisy
and
*NL*
spoiled
twins
sometimes
but
for
all
that
darling
little
fellows
with
*NL*
bright
merry
faces
and
endearing
ways
about
them
.
They
were
dabbling
in
*NL*
the
sand
with
their
spades
and
buckets
,
building
castles
as
children
do
,
*NL*
or
playing
with
their
big
coloured
ball
,
happy
as
the
day
was
long
.
And
*NL*
Edy
Boardman
was
rocking
the
chubby
baby
to
and
fro
in
the
pushcar
while
*NL*
that
young
gentleman
fairly
chuckled
with
delight
.
He
was
but
eleven
*NL*
months
and
nine
days
old
and
,
though
still
a
tiny
toddler
,
was
just
*NL*
beginning
to
lisp
his
first
babyish
words
.
Cissy
Caffrey
bent
over
to
*NL*
him
to
tease
his
fat
little
plucks
and
the
dainty
dimple
in
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
baby
,
Cissy
Caffrey
said
.
Say
out
big
,
big
.
I
want
a
drink
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
baby
prattled
after
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
jink
a
jink
a
jawbo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
Caffrey
cuddled
the
wee
chap
for
she
was
awfully
fond
of
children
,
*NL*
so
patient
with
little
sufferers
and
Tommy
Caffrey
could
never
be
got
to
*NL*
take
his
castor
oil
unless
it
was
Cissy
Caffrey
that
held
his
nose
and
*NL*
promised
him
the
scatty
heel
of
the
loaf
or
brown
bread
with
golden
*NL*
syrup
on
.
What
a
persuasive
power
that
girl
had
!
But
to
be
sure
baby
*NL*
Boardman
was
as
good
as
gold
,
a
perfect
little
dote
in
his
new
fancy
*NL*
bib
.
None
of
your
spoilt
beauties
,
Flora
MacFlimsy
sort
,
was
Cissy
*NL*
Caffrey
.
A
truerhearted
lass
never
drew
the
breath
of
life
,
always
with
*NL*
a
laugh
in
her
gipsylike
eyes
and
a
frolicsome
word
on
her
cherryripe
*NL*
red
lips
,
a
girl
lovable
in
the
extreme
.
And
Edy
Boardman
laughed
too
at
*NL*
the
quaint
language
of
little
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
then
there
was
a
slight
altercation
between
Master
Tommy
and
*NL*
Master
Jacky
.
Boys
will
be
boys
and
our
two
twins
were
no
exception
*NL*
to
this
golden
rule
.
The
apple
of
discord
was
a
certain
castle
of
sand
*NL*
which
Master
Jacky
had
built
and
Master
Tommy
would
have
it
right
go
*NL*
wrong
that
it
was
to
be
architecturally
improved
by
a
frontdoor
like
the
*NL*
Martello
tower
had
.
But
if
Master
Tommy
was
headstrong
Master
Jacky
was
*NL*
selfwilled
too
and
,
true
to
the
maxim
that
every
little
Irishman
's
house
*NL*
is
his
castle
,
he
fell
upon
his
hated
rival
and
to
such
purpose
that
the
*NL*
wouldbe
assailant
came
to
grief
and
-LRB-
alas
to
relate
!
-RRB-
the
coveted
castle
*NL*
too
.
Needless
to
say
the
cries
of
discomfited
Master
Tommy
drew
the
*NL*
attention
of
the
girl
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
here
,
Tommy
,
his
sister
called
imperatively
.
At
once
!
And
you
,
*NL*
Jacky
,
for
shame
to
throw
poor
Tommy
in
the
dirty
sand
.
Wait
till
I
*NL*
catch
you
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
misty
with
unshed
tears
Master
Tommy
came
at
her
call
for
their
*NL*
big
sister
's
word
was
law
with
the
twins
.
And
in
a
sad
plight
he
was
*NL*
too
after
his
misadventure
.
His
little
man-o
'
-
war
top
and
unmentionables
*NL*
were
full
of
sand
but
Cissy
was
a
past
mistress
in
the
art
of
smoothing
*NL*
over
life
's
tiny
troubles
and
very
quickly
not
one
speck
of
sand
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
on
his
smart
little
suit
.
Still
the
blue
eyes
were
glistening
*NL*
with
hot
tears
that
would
well
up
so
she
kissed
away
the
hurtness
and
*NL*
shook
her
hand
at
Master
Jacky
the
culprit
and
said
if
she
was
near
him
*NL*
she
would
n't
be
far
from
him
,
her
eyes
dancing
in
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nasty
bold
Jacky
!
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
an
arm
round
the
little
mariner
and
coaxed
winningly
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
your
name
?
Butter
and
cream
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
us
who
is
your
sweetheart
,
spoke
Edy
Boardman
.
Is
Cissy
your
*NL*
sweetheart
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nao
,
tearful
Tommy
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
Edy
Boardman
your
sweetheart
?
Cissy
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nao
,
Tommy
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
know
,
Edy
Boardman
said
none
too
amiably
with
an
arch
glance
from
*NL*
her
shortsighted
eyes
.
I
know
who
is
Tommy
's
sweetheart
.
Gerty
is
*NL*
Tommy
's
sweetheart
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nao
,
Tommy
said
on
the
verge
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
's
quick
motherwit
guessed
what
was
amiss
and
she
whispered
to
*NL*
Edy
Boardman
to
take
him
there
behind
the
pushcar
where
the
gentleman
*NL*
could
n't
see
and
to
mind
he
did
n't
wet
his
new
tan
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
who
was
Gerty
?
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
MacDowell
who
was
seated
near
her
companions
,
lost
in
thought
,
*NL*
gazing
far
away
into
the
distance
was
,
in
very
truth
,
as
fair
a
specimen
*NL*
of
winsome
Irish
girlhood
as
one
could
wish
to
see
.
She
was
pronounced
*NL*
beautiful
by
all
who
knew
her
though
,
as
folks
often
said
,
she
was
*NL*
more
a
Giltrap
than
a
MacDowell
.
Her
figure
was
slight
and
graceful
,
*NL*
inclining
even
to
fragility
but
those
iron
jelloids
she
had
been
taking
*NL*
of
late
had
done
her
a
world
of
good
much
better
than
the
Widow
Welch
's
*NL*
female
pills
and
she
was
much
better
of
those
discharges
she
used
to
*NL*
get
and
that
tired
feeling
.
The
waxen
pallor
of
her
face
was
almost
*NL*
spiritual
in
its
ivorylike
purity
though
her
rosebud
mouth
was
a
genuine
*NL*
Cupid
's
bow
,
Greekly
perfect
.
Her
hands
were
of
finely
veined
alabaster
*NL*
with
tapering
fingers
and
as
white
as
lemonjuice
and
queen
of
ointments
*NL*
could
make
them
though
it
was
not
true
that
she
used
to
wear
kid
gloves
*NL*
in
bed
or
take
a
milk
footbath
either
.
Bertha
Supple
told
that
once
to
*NL*
Edy
Boardman
,
a
deliberate
lie
,
when
she
was
black
out
at
daggers
drawn
*NL*
with
Gerty
-LRB-
the
girl
chums
had
of
course
their
little
tiffs
from
time
to
*NL*
time
like
the
rest
of
mortals
-RRB-
and
she
told
her
not
to
let
on
whatever
*NL*
she
did
that
it
was
her
that
told
her
or
she
'd
never
speak
to
her
*NL*
again
.
No
.
Honour
where
honour
is
due
.
There
was
an
innate
refinement
,
*NL*
a
languid
queenly
_
hauteur
_
about
Gerty
which
was
unmistakably
evidenced
*NL*
in
her
delicate
hands
and
higharched
instep
.
Had
kind
fate
but
willed
*NL*
her
to
be
born
a
gentlewoman
of
high
degree
in
her
own
right
and
had
*NL*
she
only
received
the
benefit
of
a
good
education
Gerty
MacDowell
might
*NL*
easily
have
held
her
own
beside
any
lady
in
the
land
and
have
seen
*NL*
herself
exquisitely
gowned
with
jewels
on
her
brow
and
patrician
suitors
*NL*
at
her
feet
vying
with
one
another
to
pay
their
devoirs
to
her
.
*NL*
Mayhap
it
was
this
,
the
love
that
might
have
been
,
that
lent
to
her
*NL*
softlyfeatured
face
at
whiles
a
look
,
tense
with
suppressed
meaning
,
*NL*
that
imparted
a
strange
yearning
tendency
to
the
beautiful
eyes
,
a
charm
*NL*
few
could
resist
.
Why
have
women
such
eyes
of
witchery
?
Gerty
's
were
of
*NL*
the
bluest
Irish
blue
,
set
off
by
lustrous
lashes
and
dark
expressive
*NL*
brows
.
Time
was
when
those
brows
were
not
so
silkily
seductive
.
It
*NL*
was
Madame
Vera
Verity
,
directress
of
the
Woman
Beautiful
page
of
the
*NL*
Princess
Novelette
,
who
had
first
advised
her
to
try
eyebrowleine
which
*NL*
gave
that
haunting
expression
to
the
eyes
,
so
becoming
in
leaders
*NL*
of
fashion
,
and
she
had
never
regretted
it
.
Then
there
was
blushing
*NL*
scientifically
cured
and
how
to
be
tall
increase
your
height
and
you
*NL*
have
a
beautiful
face
but
your
nose
?
That
would
suit
Mrs
Dignam
because
*NL*
she
had
a
button
one
.
But
Gerty
's
crowning
glory
was
her
wealth
of
*NL*
wonderful
hair
.
It
was
dark
brown
with
a
natural
wave
in
it
.
She
had
cut
*NL*
it
that
very
morning
on
account
of
the
new
moon
and
it
nestled
about
*NL*
her
pretty
head
in
a
profusion
of
luxuriant
clusters
and
pared
her
nails
*NL*
too
,
Thursday
for
wealth
.
And
just
now
at
Edy
's
words
as
a
telltale
*NL*
flush
,
delicate
as
the
faintest
rosebloom
,
crept
into
her
cheeks
she
*NL*
looked
so
lovely
in
her
sweet
girlish
shyness
that
of
a
surety
God
's
*NL*
fair
land
of
Ireland
did
not
hold
her
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
she
was
silent
with
rather
sad
downcast
eyes
.
She
*NL*
was
about
to
retort
but
something
checked
the
words
on
her
tongue
.
*NL*
Inclination
prompted
her
to
speak
out
:
dignity
told
her
to
be
silent
.
*NL*
The
pretty
lips
pouted
awhile
but
then
she
glanced
up
and
broke
out
into
*NL*
a
joyous
little
laugh
which
had
in
it
all
the
freshness
of
a
young
May
*NL*
morning
.
She
knew
right
well
,
no-one
better
,
what
made
squinty
Edy
*NL*
say
that
because
of
him
cooling
in
his
attentions
when
it
was
simply
a
*NL*
lovers
'
quarrel
.
As
per
usual
somebody
's
nose
was
out
of
joint
about
the
*NL*
boy
that
had
the
bicycle
off
the
London
bridge
road
always
riding
up
*NL*
and
down
in
front
of
her
window
.
Only
now
his
father
kept
him
in
in
the
*NL*
evenings
studying
hard
to
get
an
exhibition
in
the
intermediate
that
was
*NL*
on
and
he
was
going
to
go
to
Trinity
college
to
study
for
a
doctor
when
*NL*
he
left
the
high
school
like
his
brother
W.
E.
Wylie
who
was
racing
*NL*
in
the
bicycle
races
in
Trinity
college
university
.
Little
recked
he
*NL*
perhaps
for
what
she
felt
,
that
dull
aching
void
in
her
heart
sometimes
,
*NL*
piercing
to
the
core
.
Yet
he
was
young
and
perchance
he
might
learn
*NL*
to
love
her
in
time
.
They
were
protestants
in
his
family
and
of
course
*NL*
Gerty
knew
Who
came
first
and
after
Him
the
Blessed
Virgin
and
then
*NL*
Saint
Joseph
.
But
he
was
undeniably
handsome
with
an
exquisite
nose
and
*NL*
he
was
what
he
looked
,
every
inch
a
gentleman
,
the
shape
of
his
head
too
*NL*
at
the
back
without
his
cap
on
that
she
would
know
anywhere
something
*NL*
off
the
common
and
the
way
he
turned
the
bicycle
at
the
lamp
with
his
*NL*
hands
off
the
bars
and
also
the
nice
perfume
of
those
good
cigarettes
*NL*
and
besides
they
were
both
of
a
size
too
he
and
she
and
that
was
why
Edy
*NL*
Boardman
thought
she
was
so
frightfully
clever
because
he
did
n't
go
and
*NL*
ride
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
bit
of
a
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
was
dressed
simply
but
with
the
instinctive
taste
of
a
votary
of
*NL*
Dame
Fashion
for
she
felt
that
there
was
just
a
might
that
he
might
be
*NL*
out
.
A
neat
blouse
of
electric
blue
selftinted
by
dolly
dyes
-LRB-
because
it
*NL*
was
expected
in
the
_
Lady
's
Pictorial
_
that
electric
blue
would
be
worn
-RRB-
*NL*
with
a
smart
vee
opening
down
to
the
division
and
kerchief
pocket
-LRB-
in
*NL*
which
she
always
kept
a
piece
of
cottonwool
scented
with
her
*NL*
favourite
perfume
because
the
handkerchief
spoiled
the
sit
-RRB-
and
a
navy
*NL*
threequarter
skirt
cut
to
the
stride
showed
off
her
slim
graceful
figure
*NL*
to
perfection
.
She
wore
a
coquettish
little
love
of
a
hat
of
wideleaved
*NL*
nigger
straw
contrast
trimmed
with
an
underbrim
of
eggblue
chenille
and
*NL*
at
the
side
a
butterfly
bow
of
silk
to
tone
.
All
Tuesday
week
afternoon
*NL*
she
was
hunting
to
match
that
chenille
but
at
last
she
found
what
she
*NL*
wanted
at
Clery
's
summer
sales
,
the
very
it
,
slightly
shopsoiled
but
you
*NL*
would
never
notice
,
seven
fingers
two
and
a
penny
.
She
did
it
up
all
by
*NL*
herself
and
what
joy
was
hers
when
she
tried
it
on
then
,
smiling
at
the
*NL*
lovely
reflection
which
the
mirror
gave
back
to
her
!
And
when
she
put
*NL*
it
on
the
waterjug
to
keep
the
shape
she
knew
that
that
would
take
the
*NL*
shine
out
of
some
people
she
knew
.
Her
shoes
were
the
newest
thing
in
*NL*
footwear
-LRB-
Edy
Boardman
prided
herself
that
she
was
very
_
petite
_
but
she
*NL*
never
had
a
foot
like
Gerty
MacDowell
,
a
five
,
and
never
would
ash
,
*NL*
oak
or
elm
-RRB-
with
patent
toecaps
and
just
one
smart
buckle
over
*NL*
her
higharched
instep
.
Her
wellturned
ankle
displayed
its
perfect
*NL*
proportions
beneath
her
skirt
and
just
the
proper
amount
and
no
more
of
*NL*
her
shapely
limbs
encased
in
finespun
hose
with
highspliced
heels
and
*NL*
wide
garter
tops
.
As
for
undies
they
were
Gerty
's
chief
care
and
who
*NL*
that
knows
the
fluttering
hopes
and
fears
of
sweet
seventeen
-LRB-
though
*NL*
Gerty
would
never
see
seventeen
again
-RRB-
can
find
it
in
his
heart
to
*NL*
blame
her
?
She
had
four
dinky
sets
with
awfully
pretty
stitchery
,
*NL*
three
garments
and
nighties
extra
,
and
each
set
slotted
with
different
*NL*
coloured
ribbons
,
rosepink
,
pale
blue
,
mauve
and
peagreen
,
and
she
aired
*NL*
them
herself
and
blued
them
when
they
came
home
from
the
wash
and
ironed
*NL*
them
and
she
had
a
brickbat
to
keep
the
iron
on
because
she
would
n't
*NL*
trust
those
washerwomen
as
far
as
she
'd
see
them
scorching
the
things
.
*NL*
She
was
wearing
the
blue
for
luck
,
hoping
against
hope
,
her
own
colour
*NL*
and
lucky
too
for
a
bride
to
have
a
bit
of
blue
somewhere
on
her
because
*NL*
the
green
she
wore
that
day
week
brought
grief
because
his
father
*NL*
brought
him
in
to
study
for
the
intermediate
exhibition
and
because
*NL*
she
thought
perhaps
he
might
be
out
because
when
she
was
dressing
that
*NL*
morning
she
nearly
slipped
up
the
old
pair
on
her
inside
out
and
that
*NL*
was
for
luck
and
lovers
'
meeting
if
you
put
those
things
on
inside
*NL*
out
or
if
they
got
untied
that
he
was
thinking
about
you
so
long
as
it
*NL*
was
n't
of
a
Friday
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
and
yet
!
That
strained
look
on
her
face
!
A
gnawing
sorrow
is
*NL*
there
all
the
time
.
Her
very
soul
is
in
her
eyes
and
she
would
give
*NL*
worlds
to
be
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
familiar
chamber
where
,
*NL*
giving
way
to
tears
,
she
could
have
a
good
cry
and
relieve
her
pentup
*NL*
feelingsthough
not
too
much
because
she
knew
how
to
cry
nicely
before
*NL*
the
mirror
.
You
are
lovely
,
Gerty
,
it
said
.
The
paly
light
of
evening
*NL*
falls
upon
a
face
infinitely
sad
and
wistful
.
Gerty
MacDowell
yearns
*NL*
in
vain
.
Yes
,
she
had
known
from
the
very
first
that
her
daydream
of
a
*NL*
marriage
has
been
arranged
and
the
weddingbells
ringing
for
Mrs
Reggy
*NL*
Wylie
T.
C.
D.
-LRB-
because
the
one
who
married
the
elder
brother
would
be
*NL*
Mrs
Wylie
-RRB-
and
in
the
fashionable
intelligence
Mrs
Gertrude
Wylie
was
*NL*
wearing
a
sumptuous
confection
of
grey
trimmed
with
expensive
blue
fox
*NL*
was
not
to
be
.
He
was
too
young
to
understand
.
He
would
not
believe
in
*NL*
love
,
a
woman
's
birthright
.
The
night
of
the
party
long
ago
in
Stoer
's
*NL*
-LRB-
he
was
still
in
short
trousers
-RRB-
when
they
were
alone
and
he
stole
*NL*
an
arm
round
her
waist
she
went
white
to
the
very
lips
.
He
called
her
*NL*
little
one
in
a
strangely
husky
voice
and
snatched
a
half
kiss
-LRB-
the
*NL*
first
!
-RRB-
but
it
was
only
the
end
of
her
nose
and
then
he
hastened
from
*NL*
the
room
with
a
remark
about
refreshments
.
Impetuous
fellow
!
Strength
of
*NL*
character
had
never
been
Reggy
Wylie
's
strong
point
and
he
who
would
*NL*
woo
and
win
Gerty
MacDowell
must
be
a
man
among
men
.
But
waiting
,
always
*NL*
waiting
to
be
asked
and
it
was
leap
year
too
and
would
soon
be
over
.
No
*NL*
prince
charming
is
her
beau
ideal
to
lay
a
rare
and
wondrous
love
at
her
*NL*
feet
but
rather
a
manly
man
with
a
strong
quiet
face
who
had
not
found
*NL*
his
ideal
,
perhaps
his
hair
slightly
flecked
with
grey
,
and
who
would
*NL*
understand
,
take
her
in
his
sheltering
arms
,
strain
her
to
him
in
all
*NL*
the
strength
of
his
deep
passionate
nature
and
comfort
her
with
a
long
*NL*
long
kiss
.
It
would
be
like
heaven
.
For
such
a
one
she
yearns
this
balmy
*NL*
summer
eve
.
With
all
the
heart
of
her
she
longs
to
be
his
only
,
his
*NL*
affianced
bride
for
riches
for
poor
,
in
sickness
in
health
,
till
death
*NL*
us
two
part
,
from
this
to
this
day
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
Edy
Boardman
was
with
little
Tommy
behind
the
pushcar
she
was
*NL*
just
thinking
would
the
day
ever
come
when
she
could
call
herself
his
*NL*
little
wife
to
be
.
Then
they
could
talk
about
her
till
they
went
blue
in
*NL*
the
face
,
Bertha
Supple
too
,
and
Edy
,
little
spitfire
,
because
she
would
*NL*
be
twentytwo
in
November
.
She
would
care
for
him
with
creature
comforts
*NL*
too
for
Gerty
was
womanly
wise
and
knew
that
a
mere
man
liked
that
*NL*
feeling
of
hominess
.
Her
griddlecakes
done
to
a
goldenbrown
hue
and
*NL*
queen
Ann
's
pudding
of
delightful
creaminess
had
won
golden
opinions
*NL*
from
all
because
she
had
a
lucky
hand
also
for
lighting
a
fire
,
dredge
*NL*
in
the
fine
selfraising
flour
and
always
stir
in
the
same
direction
,
*NL*
then
cream
the
milk
and
sugar
and
whisk
well
the
white
of
eggs
though
*NL*
she
did
n't
like
the
eating
part
when
there
were
any
people
that
made
her
*NL*
shy
and
often
she
wondered
why
you
could
n't
eat
something
poetical
like
*NL*
violets
or
roses
and
they
would
have
a
beautifully
appointed
drawingroom
*NL*
with
pictures
and
engravings
and
the
photograph
of
grandpapa
Giltrap
's
*NL*
lovely
dog
Garryowen
that
almost
talked
it
was
so
human
and
chintz
*NL*
covers
for
the
chairs
and
that
silver
toastrack
in
Clery
's
summer
*NL*
jumble
sales
like
they
have
in
rich
houses
.
He
would
be
tall
with
*NL*
broad
shoulders
-LRB-
she
had
always
admired
tall
men
for
a
husband
-RRB-
with
*NL*
glistening
white
teeth
under
his
carefully
trimmed
sweeping
moustache
*NL*
and
they
would
go
on
the
continent
for
their
honeymoon
-LRB-
three
wonderful
*NL*
weeks
!
-RRB-
and
then
,
when
they
settled
down
in
a
nice
snug
and
cosy
little
*NL*
homely
house
,
every
morning
they
would
both
have
brekky
,
simple
but
*NL*
perfectly
served
,
for
their
own
two
selves
and
before
he
went
out
to
*NL*
business
he
would
give
his
dear
little
wifey
a
good
hearty
hug
and
gaze
*NL*
for
a
moment
deep
down
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edy
Boardman
asked
Tommy
Caffrey
was
he
done
and
he
said
yes
so
then
she
*NL*
buttoned
up
his
little
knickerbockers
for
him
and
told
him
to
run
off
*NL*
and
play
with
Jacky
and
to
be
good
now
and
not
to
fight
.
But
Tommy
said
*NL*
he
wanted
the
ball
and
Edy
told
him
no
that
baby
was
playing
with
the
*NL*
ball
and
if
he
took
it
there
'd
be
wigs
on
the
green
but
Tommy
said
it
*NL*
was
his
ball
and
he
wanted
his
ball
and
he
pranced
on
the
ground
,
if
*NL*
you
please
.
The
temper
of
him
!
O
,
he
was
a
man
already
was
little
Tommy
*NL*
Caffrey
since
he
was
out
of
pinnies
.
Edy
told
him
no
,
no
and
to
be
off
*NL*
now
with
him
and
she
told
Cissy
Caffrey
not
to
give
in
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
're
not
my
sister
,
naughty
Tommy
said
.
It
's
my
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Cissy
Caffrey
told
baby
Boardman
to
look
up
,
look
up
high
at
her
*NL*
finger
and
she
snatched
the
ball
quickly
and
threw
it
along
the
sand
and
*NL*
Tommy
after
it
in
full
career
,
having
won
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Anything
for
a
quiet
life
,
laughed
Ciss
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
tickled
tiny
tot
's
two
cheeks
to
make
him
forget
and
played
*NL*
here
's
the
lord
mayor
,
here
's
his
two
horses
,
here
's
his
gingerbread
*NL*
carriage
and
here
he
walks
in
,
chinchopper
,
chinchopper
,
chinchopper
*NL*
chin
.
But
Edy
got
as
cross
as
two
sticks
about
him
getting
his
own
way
*NL*
like
that
from
everyone
always
petting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'd
like
to
give
him
something
,
she
said
,
so
I
would
,
where
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
On
the
beeoteetom
,
laughed
Cissy
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
MacDowell
bent
down
her
head
and
crimsoned
at
the
idea
of
Cissy
*NL*
saying
an
unladylike
thing
like
that
out
loud
she
'd
be
ashamed
of
her
*NL*
life
to
say
,
flushing
a
deep
rosy
red
,
and
Edy
Boardman
said
she
was
*NL*
sure
the
gentleman
opposite
heard
what
she
said
.
But
not
a
pin
cared
*NL*
Ciss
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
him
!
she
said
with
a
pert
toss
of
her
head
and
a
piquant
tilt
of
*NL*
her
nose
.
Give
it
to
him
too
on
the
same
place
as
quick
as
I
'd
look
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madcap
Ciss
with
her
golliwog
curls
.
You
had
to
laugh
at
her
sometimes
.
*NL*
For
instance
when
she
asked
you
would
you
have
some
more
Chinese
tea
and
*NL*
jaspberry
ram
and
when
she
drew
the
jugs
too
and
the
men
's
faces
on
her
*NL*
nails
with
red
ink
make
you
split
your
sides
or
when
she
wanted
to
go
*NL*
where
you
know
she
said
she
wanted
to
run
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
Miss
*NL*
White
.
That
was
just
like
Cissycums
.
O
,
and
will
you
ever
forget
her
the
*NL*
evening
she
dressed
up
in
her
father
's
suit
and
hat
and
the
burned
cork
*NL*
moustache
and
walked
down
Tritonville
road
,
smoking
a
cigarette
.
There
*NL*
was
none
to
come
up
to
her
for
fun
.
But
she
was
sincerity
itself
,
one
of
*NL*
the
bravest
and
truest
hearts
heaven
ever
made
,
not
one
of
your
twofaced
*NL*
things
,
too
sweet
to
be
wholesome
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
there
came
out
upon
the
air
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
pealing
*NL*
anthem
of
the
organ
.
It
was
the
men
's
temperance
retreat
conducted
*NL*
by
the
missioner
,
the
reverend
John
Hughes
S.
J.
,
rosary
,
sermon
and
*NL*
benediction
of
the
Most
Blessed
Sacrament
.
They
were
there
gathered
*NL*
together
without
distinction
of
social
class
-LRB-
and
a
most
edifying
*NL*
spectacle
it
was
to
see
-RRB-
in
that
simple
fane
beside
the
waves
,
after
the
*NL*
storms
of
this
weary
world
,
kneeling
before
the
feet
of
the
immaculate
,
*NL*
reciting
the
litany
of
Our
Lady
of
Loreto
,
beseeching
her
to
intercede
*NL*
for
them
,
the
old
familiar
words
,
holy
Mary
,
holy
virgin
of
virgins
.
How
*NL*
sad
to
poor
Gerty
's
ears
!
Had
her
father
only
avoided
the
clutches
of
*NL*
the
demon
drink
,
by
taking
the
pledge
or
those
powders
the
drink
habit
*NL*
cured
in
Pearson
's
Weekly
,
she
might
now
be
rolling
in
her
carriage
,
*NL*
second
to
none
.
Over
and
over
had
she
told
herself
that
as
she
mused
by
*NL*
the
dying
embers
in
a
brown
study
without
the
lamp
because
she
hated
two
*NL*
lights
or
oftentimes
gazing
out
of
the
window
dreamily
by
the
hour
at
*NL*
the
rain
falling
on
the
rusty
bucket
,
thinking
.
But
that
vile
decoction
*NL*
which
has
ruined
so
many
hearths
and
homes
had
cist
its
shadow
over
her
*NL*
childhood
days
.
Nay
,
she
had
even
witnessed
in
the
home
circle
deeds
of
*NL*
violence
caused
by
intemperance
and
had
seen
her
own
father
,
a
prey
to
*NL*
the
fumes
of
intoxication
,
forget
himself
completely
for
if
there
was
*NL*
one
thing
of
all
things
that
Gerty
knew
it
was
that
the
man
who
lifts
*NL*
his
hand
to
a
woman
save
in
the
way
of
kindness
,
deserves
to
be
branded
*NL*
as
the
lowest
of
the
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
the
voices
sang
in
supplication
to
the
Virgin
most
powerful
,
*NL*
Virgin
most
merciful
.
And
Gerty
,
rapt
in
thought
,
scarce
saw
or
heard
*NL*
her
companions
or
the
twins
at
their
boyish
gambols
or
the
gentleman
*NL*
off
Sandymount
green
that
Cissy
Caffrey
called
the
man
that
was
so
like
*NL*
himself
passing
along
the
strand
taking
a
short
walk
.
You
never
saw
him
*NL*
any
way
screwed
but
still
and
for
all
that
she
would
not
like
him
for
a
*NL*
father
because
he
was
too
old
or
something
or
on
account
of
his
face
*NL*
-LRB-
it
was
a
palpable
case
of
Doctor
Fell
-RRB-
or
his
carbuncly
nose
with
the
*NL*
pimples
on
it
and
his
sandy
moustache
a
bit
white
under
his
nose
.
Poor
*NL*
father
!
With
all
his
faults
she
loved
him
still
when
he
sang
_
Tell
me
,
*NL*
Mary
,
how
to
woo
thee
_
or
_
My
love
and
cottage
near
Rochelle
_
and
they
*NL*
had
stewed
cockles
and
lettuce
with
Lazenby
's
salad
dressing
for
*NL*
supper
and
when
he
sang
_
The
moon
hath
raised
_
with
Mr
Dignam
that
*NL*
died
suddenly
and
was
buried
,
God
have
mercy
on
him
,
from
a
stroke
.
Her
*NL*
mother
's
birthday
that
was
and
Charley
was
home
on
his
holidays
and
Tom
*NL*
and
Mr
Dignam
and
Mrs
and
Patsy
and
Freddy
Dignam
and
they
were
to
have
*NL*
had
a
group
taken
.
No-one
would
have
thought
the
end
was
so
near
.
Now
he
*NL*
was
laid
to
rest
.
And
her
mother
said
to
him
to
let
that
be
a
warning
to
*NL*
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
and
he
could
n't
even
go
to
the
funeral
on
*NL*
account
of
the
gout
and
she
had
to
go
into
town
to
bring
him
the
*NL*
letters
and
samples
from
his
office
about
Catesby
's
cork
lino
,
artistic
,
*NL*
standard
designs
,
fit
for
a
palace
,
gives
tiptop
wear
and
always
bright
*NL*
and
cheery
in
the
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sterling
good
daughter
was
Gerty
just
like
a
second
mother
in
the
*NL*
house
,
a
ministering
angel
too
with
a
little
heart
worth
its
weight
in
*NL*
gold
.
And
when
her
mother
had
those
raging
splitting
headaches
who
was
*NL*
it
rubbed
the
menthol
cone
on
her
forehead
but
Gerty
though
she
did
n't
*NL*
like
her
mother
's
taking
pinches
of
snuff
and
that
was
the
only
single
*NL*
thing
they
ever
had
words
about
,
taking
snuff
.
Everyone
thought
the
*NL*
world
of
her
for
her
gentle
ways
.
It
was
Gerty
who
turned
off
the
gas
at
*NL*
the
main
every
night
and
it
was
Gerty
who
tacked
up
on
the
wall
of
that
*NL*
place
where
she
never
forgot
every
fortnight
the
chlorate
of
lime
Mr
*NL*
Tunney
the
grocer
's
christmas
almanac
,
the
picture
of
halcyon
days
*NL*
where
a
young
gentleman
in
the
costume
they
used
to
wear
then
with
a
*NL*
threecornered
hat
was
offering
a
bunch
of
flowers
to
his
ladylove
with
*NL*
oldtime
chivalry
through
her
lattice
window
.
You
could
see
there
was
a
*NL*
story
behind
it
.
The
colours
were
done
something
lovely
.
She
was
in
*NL*
a
soft
clinging
white
in
a
studied
attitude
and
the
gentleman
was
in
*NL*
chocolate
and
he
looked
a
thorough
aristocrat
.
She
often
looked
at
them
*NL*
dreamily
when
she
went
there
for
a
certain
purpose
and
felt
her
own
*NL*
arms
that
were
white
and
soft
just
like
hers
with
the
sleeves
back
*NL*
and
thought
about
those
times
because
she
had
found
out
in
Walker
's
*NL*
pronouncing
dictionary
that
belonged
to
grandpapa
Giltrap
about
the
*NL*
halcyon
days
what
they
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
were
now
playing
in
the
most
approved
brotherly
fashion
*NL*
till
at
last
Master
Jacky
who
was
really
as
bold
as
brass
there
was
*NL*
no
getting
behind
that
deliberately
kicked
the
ball
as
hard
as
ever
he
*NL*
could
down
towards
the
seaweedy
rocks
.
Needless
to
say
poor
Tommy
was
*NL*
not
slow
to
voice
his
dismay
but
luckily
the
gentleman
in
black
who
was
*NL*
sitting
there
by
himself
came
gallantly
to
the
rescue
and
intercepted
*NL*
the
ball
.
Our
two
champions
claimed
their
plaything
with
lusty
cries
and
*NL*
to
avoid
trouble
Cissy
Caffrey
called
to
the
gentleman
to
throw
it
to
*NL*
her
please
.
The
gentleman
aimed
the
ball
once
or
twice
and
then
threw
*NL*
it
up
the
strand
towards
Cissy
Caffrey
but
it
rolled
down
the
slope
and
*NL*
stopped
right
under
Gerty
's
skirt
near
the
little
pool
by
the
rock
.
The
*NL*
twins
clamoured
again
for
it
and
Cissy
told
her
to
kick
it
away
and
*NL*
let
them
fight
for
it
so
Gerty
drew
back
her
foot
but
she
wished
their
*NL*
stupid
ball
had
n't
come
rolling
down
to
her
and
she
gave
a
kick
but
she
*NL*
missed
and
Edy
and
Cissy
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
you
fail
try
again
,
Edy
Boardman
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
smiled
assent
and
bit
her
lip
.
A
delicate
pink
crept
into
her
*NL*
pretty
cheek
but
she
was
determined
to
let
them
see
so
she
just
lifted
*NL*
her
skirt
a
little
but
just
enough
and
took
good
aim
and
gave
the
ball
a
*NL*
jolly
good
kick
and
it
went
ever
so
far
and
the
two
twins
after
it
down
*NL*
towards
the
shingle
.
Pure
jealousy
of
course
it
was
nothing
else
to
draw
*NL*
attention
on
account
of
the
gentleman
opposite
looking
.
She
felt
the
*NL*
warm
flush
,
a
danger
signal
always
with
Gerty
MacDowell
,
surging
and
*NL*
flaming
into
her
cheeks
.
Till
then
they
had
only
exchanged
glances
of
*NL*
the
most
casual
but
now
under
the
brim
of
her
new
hat
she
ventured
a
*NL*
look
at
him
and
the
face
that
met
her
gaze
there
in
the
twilight
,
wan
*NL*
and
strangely
drawn
,
seemed
to
her
the
saddest
she
had
ever
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
open
window
of
the
church
the
fragrant
incense
was
wafted
*NL*
and
with
it
the
fragrant
names
of
her
who
was
conceived
without
stain
of
*NL*
original
sin
,
spiritual
vessel
,
pray
for
us
,
honourable
vessel
,
pray
*NL*
for
us
,
vessel
of
singular
devotion
,
pray
for
us
,
mystical
rose
.
And
*NL*
careworn
hearts
were
there
and
toilers
for
their
daily
bread
and
many
*NL*
who
had
erred
and
wandered
,
their
eyes
wet
with
contrition
but
for
all
*NL*
that
bright
with
hope
for
the
reverend
father
Father
Hughes
had
told
*NL*
them
what
the
great
saint
Bernard
said
in
his
famous
prayer
of
Mary
,
the
*NL*
most
pious
Virgin
's
intercessory
power
that
it
was
not
recorded
in
any
*NL*
age
that
those
who
implored
her
powerful
protection
were
ever
abandoned
*NL*
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
were
now
playing
again
right
merrily
for
the
troubles
of
*NL*
childhood
are
but
as
fleeting
summer
showers
.
Cissy
Caffrey
played
with
*NL*
baby
Boardman
till
he
crowed
with
glee
,
clapping
baby
hands
in
air
.
Peep
*NL*
she
cried
behind
the
hood
of
the
pushcar
and
Edy
asked
where
was
Cissy
*NL*
gone
and
then
Cissy
popped
up
her
head
and
cried
ah
!
and
,
my
word
,
*NL*
did
n't
the
little
chap
enjoy
that
!
And
then
she
told
him
to
say
papa
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Say
papa
,
baby
.
Say
pa
pa
pa
pa
pa
pa
pa
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
baby
did
his
level
best
to
say
it
for
he
was
very
intelligent
for
*NL*
eleven
months
everyone
said
and
big
for
his
age
and
the
picture
of
*NL*
health
,
a
perfect
little
bunch
of
love
,
and
he
would
certainly
turn
out
*NL*
to
be
something
great
,
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Haja
ja
ja
haja
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
wiped
his
little
mouth
with
the
dribbling
bib
and
wanted
him
to
*NL*
sit
up
properly
and
say
pa
pa
pa
but
when
she
undid
the
strap
she
cried
*NL*
out
,
holy
saint
Denis
,
that
he
was
possing
wet
and
to
double
the
half
*NL*
blanket
the
other
way
under
him
.
Of
course
his
infant
majesty
was
most
*NL*
obstreperous
at
such
toilet
formalities
and
he
let
everyone
know
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Habaa
baaaahabaaa
baaaa
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
two
great
big
lovely
big
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
.
It
was
all
*NL*
no
use
soothering
him
with
no
,
nono
,
baby
,
no
and
telling
him
about
the
*NL*
geegee
and
where
was
the
puffpuff
but
Ciss
,
always
readywitted
,
gave
*NL*
him
in
his
mouth
the
teat
of
the
suckingbottle
and
the
young
heathen
was
*NL*
quickly
appeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
wished
to
goodness
they
would
take
their
squalling
baby
home
out
*NL*
of
that
and
not
get
on
her
nerves
,
no
hour
to
be
out
,
and
the
little
*NL*
brats
of
twins
.
She
gazed
out
towards
the
distant
sea
.
It
was
like
the
*NL*
paintings
that
man
used
to
do
on
the
pavement
with
all
the
coloured
*NL*
chalks
and
such
a
pity
too
leaving
them
there
to
be
all
blotted
out
,
the
*NL*
evening
and
the
clouds
coming
out
and
the
Bailey
light
on
Howth
and
to
*NL*
hear
the
music
like
that
and
the
perfume
of
those
incense
they
burned
*NL*
in
the
church
like
a
kind
of
waft
.
And
while
she
gazed
her
heart
went
*NL*
pitapat
.
Yes
,
it
was
her
he
was
looking
at
,
and
there
was
meaning
in
his
*NL*
look
.
His
eyes
burned
into
her
as
though
they
would
search
her
through
*NL*
and
through
,
read
her
very
soul
.
Wonderful
eyes
they
were
,
superbly
*NL*
expressive
,
but
could
you
trust
them
?
People
were
so
queer
.
She
could
*NL*
see
at
once
by
his
dark
eyes
and
his
pale
intellectual
face
that
he
*NL*
was
a
foreigner
,
the
image
of
the
photo
she
had
of
Martin
Harvey
,
the
*NL*
matinee
idol
,
only
for
the
moustache
which
she
preferred
because
she
*NL*
was
n't
stagestruck
like
Winny
Rippingham
that
wanted
they
two
to
always
*NL*
dress
the
same
on
account
of
a
play
but
she
could
not
see
whether
he
had
*NL*
an
aquiline
nose
or
a
slightly
_
retrousse
_
from
where
he
was
sitting
.
*NL*
He
was
in
deep
mourning
,
she
could
see
that
,
and
the
story
of
a
haunting
*NL*
sorrow
was
written
on
his
face
.
She
would
have
given
worlds
to
know
what
*NL*
it
was
.
He
was
looking
up
so
intently
,
so
still
,
and
he
saw
her
kick
the
*NL*
ball
and
perhaps
he
could
see
the
bright
steel
buckles
of
her
shoes
if
*NL*
she
swung
them
like
that
thoughtfully
with
the
toes
down
.
She
was
glad
*NL*
that
something
told
her
to
put
on
the
transparent
stockings
thinking
*NL*
Reggy
Wylie
might
be
out
but
that
was
far
away
.
Here
was
that
of
which
*NL*
she
had
so
often
dreamed
.
It
was
he
who
mattered
and
there
was
joy
on
*NL*
her
face
because
she
wanted
him
because
she
felt
instinctively
that
he
*NL*
was
like
no-one
else
.
The
very
heart
of
the
girlwoman
went
out
to
him
,
*NL*
her
dreamhusband
,
because
she
knew
on
the
instant
it
was
him
.
If
he
had
*NL*
suffered
,
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
,
or
even
,
even
,
if
he
had
*NL*
been
himself
a
sinner
,
a
wicked
man
,
she
cared
not
.
Even
if
he
was
a
*NL*
protestant
or
methodist
she
could
convert
him
easily
if
he
truly
loved
*NL*
her
.
There
were
wounds
that
wanted
healing
with
heartbalm
.
She
was
a
*NL*
womanly
woman
not
like
other
flighty
girls
unfeminine
he
had
known
,
*NL*
those
cyclists
showing
off
what
they
had
n't
got
and
she
just
yearned
to
*NL*
know
all
,
to
forgive
all
if
she
could
make
him
fall
in
love
with
her
,
*NL*
make
him
forget
the
memory
of
the
past
.
Then
mayhap
he
would
embrace
her
*NL*
gently
,
like
a
real
man
,
crushing
her
soft
body
to
him
,
and
love
her
,
*NL*
his
ownest
girlie
,
for
herself
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Refuge
of
sinners
.
Comfortress
of
the
afflicted
.
_
Ora
pro
nobis
_
.
Well
*NL*
has
it
been
said
that
whosoever
prays
to
her
with
faith
and
constancy
*NL*
can
never
be
lost
or
cast
away
:
and
fitly
is
she
too
a
haven
of
refuge
*NL*
for
the
afflicted
because
of
the
seven
dolours
which
transpierced
*NL*
her
own
heart
.
Gerty
could
picture
the
whole
scene
in
the
church
,
the
*NL*
stained
glass
windows
lighted
up
,
the
candles
,
the
flowers
and
the
blue
*NL*
banners
of
the
blessed
Virgin
's
sodality
and
Father
Conroy
was
helping
*NL*
Canon
O'Hanlon
at
the
altar
,
carrying
things
in
and
out
with
his
eyes
*NL*
cast
down
.
He
looked
almost
a
saint
and
his
confessionbox
was
so
quiet
*NL*
and
clean
and
dark
and
his
hands
were
just
like
white
wax
and
if
ever
*NL*
she
became
a
Dominican
nun
in
their
white
habit
perhaps
he
might
come
to
*NL*
the
convent
for
the
novena
of
Saint
Dominic
.
He
told
her
that
time
when
*NL*
she
told
him
about
that
in
confession
,
crimsoning
up
to
the
roots
of
her
*NL*
hair
for
fear
he
could
see
,
not
to
be
troubled
because
that
was
only
the
*NL*
voice
of
nature
and
we
were
all
subject
to
nature
's
laws
,
he
said
,
in
*NL*
this
life
and
that
that
was
no
sin
because
that
came
from
the
nature
of
*NL*
woman
instituted
by
God
,
he
said
,
and
that
Our
Blessed
Lady
herself
said
*NL*
to
the
archangel
Gabriel
be
it
done
unto
me
according
to
Thy
Word
.
He
*NL*
was
so
kind
and
holy
and
often
and
often
she
thought
and
thought
could
*NL*
she
work
a
ruched
teacosy
with
embroidered
floral
design
for
him
as
a
*NL*
present
or
a
clock
but
they
had
a
clock
she
noticed
on
the
mantelpiece
*NL*
white
and
gold
with
a
canarybird
that
came
out
of
a
little
house
to
tell
*NL*
the
time
the
day
she
went
there
about
the
flowers
for
the
forty
hours
'
*NL*
adoration
because
it
was
hard
to
know
what
sort
of
a
present
to
give
or
*NL*
perhaps
an
album
of
illuminated
views
of
Dublin
or
some
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exasperating
little
brats
of
twins
began
to
quarrel
again
and
Jacky
*NL*
threw
the
ball
out
towards
the
sea
and
they
both
ran
after
it
.
Little
*NL*
monkeys
common
as
ditchwater
.
Someone
ought
to
take
them
and
give
them
*NL*
a
good
hiding
for
themselves
to
keep
them
in
their
places
,
the
both
of
*NL*
them
.
And
Cissy
and
Edy
shouted
after
them
to
come
back
because
they
*NL*
were
afraid
the
tide
might
come
in
on
them
and
be
drowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Jacky
!
Tommy
!
*NL*
*NL*
Not
they
!
What
a
great
notion
they
had
!
So
Cissy
said
it
was
the
very
*NL*
last
time
she
'd
ever
bring
them
out
.
She
jumped
up
and
called
them
and
*NL*
she
ran
down
the
slope
past
him
,
tossing
her
hair
behind
her
which
had
*NL*
a
good
enough
colour
if
there
had
been
more
of
it
but
with
all
the
*NL*
thingamerry
she
was
always
rubbing
into
it
she
could
n't
get
it
to
grow
*NL*
long
because
it
was
n't
natural
so
she
could
just
go
and
throw
her
hat
at
*NL*
it
.
She
ran
with
long
gandery
strides
it
was
a
wonder
she
did
n't
rip
up
*NL*
her
skirt
at
the
side
that
was
too
tight
on
her
because
there
was
a
lot
*NL*
of
the
tomboy
about
Cissy
Caffrey
and
she
was
a
forward
piece
whenever
*NL*
she
thought
she
had
a
good
opportunity
to
show
and
just
because
she
was
*NL*
a
good
runner
she
ran
like
that
so
that
he
could
see
all
the
end
of
her
*NL*
petticoat
running
and
her
skinny
shanks
up
as
far
as
possible
.
It
*NL*
would
have
served
her
just
right
if
she
had
tripped
up
over
something
*NL*
accidentally
on
purpose
with
her
high
crooked
French
heels
on
her
to
*NL*
make
her
look
tall
and
got
a
fine
tumble
.
_
Tableau
!
_
That
would
have
*NL*
been
a
very
charming
expose
for
a
gentleman
like
that
to
witness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Queen
of
angels
,
queen
of
patriarchs
,
queen
of
prophets
,
of
all
saints
,
*NL*
they
prayed
,
queen
of
the
most
holy
rosary
and
then
Father
Conroy
handed
*NL*
the
thurible
to
Canon
O'Hanlon
and
he
put
in
the
incense
and
censed
the
*NL*
Blessed
Sacrament
and
Cissy
Caffrey
caught
the
two
twins
and
she
was
*NL*
itching
to
give
them
a
ringing
good
clip
on
the
ear
but
she
did
n't
*NL*
because
she
thought
he
might
be
watching
but
she
never
made
a
bigger
*NL*
mistake
in
all
her
life
because
Gerty
could
see
without
looking
that
*NL*
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
of
her
and
then
Canon
O'Hanlon
handed
the
*NL*
thurible
back
to
Father
Conroy
and
knelt
down
looking
up
at
the
Blessed
*NL*
Sacrament
and
the
choir
began
to
sing
the
_
Tantum
ergo
_
and
she
just
*NL*
swung
her
foot
in
and
out
in
time
as
the
music
rose
and
fell
to
*NL*
the
_
Tantumer
gosa
cramen
tum
_
.
Three
and
eleven
she
paid
for
those
*NL*
stockings
in
Sparrow
's
of
George
's
street
on
the
Tuesday
,
no
the
Monday
*NL*
before
Easter
and
there
was
n't
a
brack
on
them
and
that
was
what
he
*NL*
was
looking
at
,
transparent
,
and
not
at
her
insignificant
ones
that
had
*NL*
neither
shape
nor
form
-LRB-
the
cheek
of
her
!
-RRB-
because
he
had
eyes
in
his
*NL*
head
to
see
the
difference
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
came
up
along
the
strand
with
the
two
twins
and
their
ball
with
*NL*
her
hat
anyhow
on
her
to
one
side
after
her
run
and
she
did
look
a
*NL*
streel
tugging
the
two
kids
along
with
the
flimsy
blouse
she
bought
only
*NL*
a
fortnight
before
like
a
rag
on
her
back
and
a
bit
of
her
petticoat
*NL*
hanging
like
a
caricature
.
Gerty
just
took
off
her
hat
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
settle
her
hair
and
a
prettier
,
a
daintier
head
of
nutbrown
tresses
was
*NL*
never
seen
on
a
girl
's
shoulders
--
a
radiant
little
vision
,
in
sooth
,
*NL*
almost
maddening
in
its
sweetness
.
You
would
have
to
travel
many
a
long
*NL*
mile
before
you
found
a
head
of
hair
the
like
of
that
.
She
could
almost
*NL*
see
the
swift
answering
flash
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
that
set
her
*NL*
tingling
in
every
nerve
.
She
put
on
her
hat
so
that
she
could
see
from
*NL*
underneath
the
brim
and
swung
her
buckled
shoe
faster
for
her
breath
*NL*
caught
as
she
caught
the
expression
in
his
eyes
.
He
was
eying
her
as
a
*NL*
snake
eyes
its
prey
.
Her
woman
's
instinct
told
her
that
she
had
raised
*NL*
the
devil
in
him
and
at
the
thought
a
burning
scarlet
swept
from
throat
*NL*
to
brow
till
the
lovely
colour
of
her
face
became
a
glorious
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edy
Boardman
was
noticing
it
too
because
she
was
squinting
at
Gerty
,
*NL*
half
smiling
,
with
her
specs
like
an
old
maid
,
pretending
to
nurse
the
*NL*
baby
.
Irritable
little
gnat
she
was
and
always
would
be
and
that
was
why
*NL*
no-one
could
get
on
with
her
poking
her
nose
into
what
was
no
concern
of
*NL*
hers
.
And
she
said
to
Gerty
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
penny
for
your
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
?
replied
Gerty
with
a
smile
reinforced
by
the
whitest
of
teeth
.
I
*NL*
was
only
wondering
was
it
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
she
wished
to
goodness
they
'd
take
the
snottynosed
twins
and
*NL*
their
babby
home
to
the
mischief
out
of
that
so
that
was
why
she
just
*NL*
gave
a
gentle
hint
about
its
being
late
.
And
when
Cissy
came
up
Edy
*NL*
asked
her
the
time
and
Miss
Cissy
,
as
glib
as
you
like
,
said
it
was
half
*NL*
past
kissing
time
,
time
to
kiss
again
.
But
Edy
wanted
to
know
because
*NL*
they
were
told
to
be
in
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Wait
,
said
Cissy
,
I
'll
run
ask
my
uncle
Peter
over
there
what
's
the
*NL*
time
by
his
conundrum
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
over
she
went
and
when
he
saw
her
coming
she
could
see
him
take
his
*NL*
hand
out
of
his
pocket
,
getting
nervous
,
and
beginning
to
play
with
his
*NL*
watchchain
,
looking
up
at
the
church
.
Passionate
nature
though
he
was
*NL*
Gerty
could
see
that
he
had
enormous
control
over
himself
.
One
moment
he
*NL*
had
been
there
,
fascinated
by
a
loveliness
that
made
him
gaze
,
and
the
*NL*
next
moment
it
was
the
quiet
gravefaced
gentleman
,
selfcontrol
expressed
*NL*
in
every
line
of
his
distinguishedlooking
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
said
to
excuse
her
would
he
mind
please
telling
her
what
was
the
*NL*
right
time
and
Gerty
could
see
him
taking
out
his
watch
,
listening
to
it
*NL*
and
looking
up
and
clearing
his
throat
and
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
his
*NL*
watch
was
stopped
but
he
thought
it
must
be
after
eight
because
the
*NL*
sun
was
set
.
His
voice
had
a
cultured
ring
in
it
and
though
he
spoke
in
*NL*
measured
accents
there
was
a
suspicion
of
a
quiver
in
the
mellow
tones
.
*NL*
Cissy
said
thanks
and
came
back
with
her
tongue
out
and
said
uncle
said
*NL*
his
waterworks
were
out
of
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
_
Tantum
ergo
_
and
Canon
O'Hanlon
*NL*
got
up
again
and
censed
the
Blessed
Sacrament
and
knelt
down
and
he
told
*NL*
Father
Conroy
that
one
of
the
candles
was
just
going
to
set
fire
to
the
*NL*
flowers
and
Father
Conroy
got
up
and
settled
it
all
right
and
she
could
*NL*
see
the
gentleman
winding
his
watch
and
listening
to
the
works
and
she
*NL*
swung
her
leg
more
in
and
out
in
time
.
It
was
getting
darker
but
he
*NL*
could
see
and
he
was
looking
all
the
time
that
he
was
winding
the
watch
*NL*
or
whatever
he
was
doing
to
it
and
then
he
put
it
back
and
put
his
hands
*NL*
back
into
his
pockets
.
She
felt
a
kind
of
a
sensation
rushing
all
over
*NL*
her
and
she
knew
by
the
feel
of
her
scalp
and
that
irritation
against
*NL*
her
stays
that
that
thing
must
be
coming
on
because
the
last
time
too
*NL*
was
when
she
clipped
her
hair
on
account
of
the
moon
.
His
dark
eyes
*NL*
fixed
themselves
on
her
again
drinking
in
her
every
contour
,
literally
*NL*
worshipping
at
her
shrine
.
If
ever
there
was
undisguised
admiration
in
a
*NL*
man
's
passionate
gaze
it
was
there
plain
to
be
seen
on
that
man
's
face
.
*NL*
It
is
for
you
,
Gertrude
MacDowell
,
and
you
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edy
began
to
get
ready
to
go
and
it
was
high
time
for
her
and
Gerty
*NL*
noticed
that
that
little
hint
she
gave
had
had
the
desired
effect
*NL*
because
it
was
a
long
way
along
the
strand
to
where
there
was
the
place
*NL*
to
push
up
the
pushcar
and
Cissy
took
off
the
twins
'
caps
and
tidied
*NL*
their
hair
to
make
herself
attractive
of
course
and
Canon
O'Hanlon
stood
*NL*
up
with
his
cope
poking
up
at
his
neck
and
Father
Conroy
handed
him
the
*NL*
card
to
read
off
and
he
read
out
_
Panem
de
coelo
praestitisti
eis
_
and
*NL*
Edy
and
Cissy
were
talking
about
the
time
all
the
time
and
asking
her
*NL*
but
Gerty
could
pay
them
back
in
their
own
coin
and
she
just
answered
*NL*
with
scathing
politeness
when
Edy
asked
her
was
she
heartbroken
about
*NL*
her
best
boy
throwing
her
over
.
Gerty
winced
sharply
.
A
brief
cold
blaze
*NL*
shone
from
her
eyes
that
spoke
volumes
of
scorn
immeasurable
.
It
hurt
--
O
*NL*
yes
,
it
cut
deep
because
Edy
had
her
own
quiet
way
of
saying
things
*NL*
like
that
she
knew
would
wound
like
the
confounded
little
cat
she
was
.
*NL*
Gerty
's
lips
parted
swiftly
to
frame
the
word
but
she
fought
back
*NL*
the
sob
that
rose
to
her
throat
,
so
slim
,
so
flawless
,
so
beautifully
*NL*
moulded
it
seemed
one
an
artist
might
have
dreamed
of
.
She
had
loved
him
*NL*
better
than
he
knew
.
Lighthearted
deceiver
and
fickle
like
all
his
sex
*NL*
he
would
never
understand
what
he
had
meant
to
her
and
for
an
instant
*NL*
there
was
in
the
blue
eyes
a
quick
stinging
of
tears
.
Their
eyes
were
*NL*
probing
her
mercilessly
but
with
a
brave
effort
she
sparkled
back
in
*NL*
sympathy
as
she
glanced
at
her
new
conquest
for
them
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
responded
Gerty
,
quick
as
lightning
,
laughing
,
and
the
proud
head
*NL*
flashed
up
.
I
can
throw
my
cap
at
who
I
like
because
it
's
leap
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
words
rang
out
crystalclear
,
more
musical
than
the
cooing
of
the
*NL*
ringdove
,
but
they
cut
the
silence
icily
.
There
was
that
in
her
young
*NL*
voice
that
told
that
she
was
not
a
one
to
be
lightly
trifled
with
.
As
*NL*
for
Mr
Reggy
with
his
swank
and
his
bit
of
money
she
could
just
chuck
*NL*
him
aside
as
if
he
was
so
much
filth
and
never
again
would
she
cast
as
*NL*
much
as
a
second
thought
on
him
and
tear
his
silly
postcard
into
a
dozen
*NL*
pieces
.
And
if
ever
after
he
dared
to
presume
she
could
give
him
one
*NL*
look
of
measured
scorn
that
would
make
him
shrivel
up
on
the
spot
.
Miss
*NL*
puny
little
Edy
's
countenance
fell
to
no
slight
extent
and
Gerty
could
*NL*
see
by
her
looking
as
black
as
thunder
that
she
was
simply
in
a
towering
*NL*
rage
though
she
hid
it
,
the
little
kinnatt
,
because
that
shaft
had
*NL*
struck
home
for
her
petty
jealousy
and
they
both
knew
that
she
was
*NL*
something
aloof
,
apart
,
in
another
sphere
,
that
she
was
not
of
them
and
*NL*
never
would
be
and
there
was
somebody
else
too
that
knew
it
and
saw
it
*NL*
so
they
could
put
that
in
their
pipe
and
smoke
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edy
straightened
up
baby
Boardman
to
get
ready
to
go
and
Cissy
tucked
in
*NL*
the
ball
and
the
spades
and
buckets
and
it
was
high
time
too
because
the
*NL*
sandman
was
on
his
way
for
Master
Boardman
junior
.
And
Cissy
told
him
*NL*
too
that
billy
winks
was
coming
and
that
baby
was
to
go
deedaw
and
baby
*NL*
looked
just
too
ducky
,
laughing
up
out
of
his
gleeful
eyes
,
and
Cissy
*NL*
poked
him
like
that
out
of
fun
in
his
wee
fat
tummy
and
baby
,
without
as
*NL*
much
as
by
your
leave
,
sent
up
his
compliments
to
all
and
sundry
on
to
*NL*
his
brandnew
dribbling
bib
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
my
!
Puddeny
pie
!
protested
Ciss
.
He
has
his
bib
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slight
_
contretemps
_
claimed
her
attention
but
in
two
twos
she
set
*NL*
that
little
matter
to
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
stifled
a
smothered
exclamation
and
gave
a
nervous
cough
and
Edy
*NL*
asked
what
and
she
was
just
going
to
tell
her
to
catch
it
while
it
was
*NL*
flying
but
she
was
ever
ladylike
in
her
deportment
so
she
simply
passed
*NL*
it
off
with
consummate
tact
by
saying
that
that
was
the
benediction
*NL*
because
just
then
the
bell
rang
out
from
the
steeple
over
the
quiet
*NL*
seashore
because
Canon
O'Hanlon
was
up
on
the
altar
with
the
veil
that
*NL*
Father
Conroy
put
round
his
shoulders
giving
the
benediction
with
the
*NL*
Blessed
Sacrament
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
moving
the
scene
there
in
the
gathering
twilight
,
the
last
glimpse
*NL*
of
Erin
,
the
touching
chime
of
those
evening
bells
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
a
bat
flew
forth
from
the
ivied
belfry
through
the
dusk
,
hither
,
*NL*
thither
,
with
a
tiny
lost
cry
.
And
she
could
see
far
away
the
lights
of
*NL*
the
lighthouses
so
picturesque
she
would
have
loved
to
do
with
a
box
of
*NL*
paints
because
it
was
easier
than
to
make
a
man
and
soon
the
lamplighter
*NL*
would
be
going
his
rounds
past
the
presbyterian
church
grounds
and
along
*NL*
by
shady
Tritonville
avenue
where
the
couples
walked
and
lighting
the
*NL*
lamp
near
her
window
where
Reggy
Wylie
used
to
turn
his
freewheel
like
*NL*
she
read
in
that
book
_
The
Lamplighter
_
by
Miss
Cummins
,
author
of
*NL*
_
Mabel
Vaughan
_
and
other
tales
.
For
Gerty
had
her
dreams
that
no-one
*NL*
knew
of
.
She
loved
to
read
poetry
and
when
she
got
a
keepsake
from
*NL*
Bertha
Supple
of
that
lovely
confession
album
with
the
coralpink
cover
*NL*
to
write
her
thoughts
in
she
laid
it
in
the
drawer
of
her
toilettable
*NL*
which
,
though
it
did
not
err
on
the
side
of
luxury
,
was
scrupulously
*NL*
neat
and
clean
.
It
was
there
she
kept
her
girlish
treasure
trove
,
the
*NL*
tortoiseshell
combs
,
her
child
of
Mary
badge
,
the
whiterose
scent
,
the
*NL*
eyebrowleine
,
her
alabaster
pouncetbox
and
the
ribbons
to
change
*NL*
when
her
things
came
home
from
the
wash
and
there
were
some
beautiful
*NL*
thoughts
written
in
it
in
violet
ink
that
she
bought
in
Hely
's
of
Dame
*NL*
Street
for
she
felt
that
she
too
could
write
poetry
if
she
could
only
*NL*
express
herself
like
that
poem
that
appealed
to
her
so
deeply
that
*NL*
she
had
copied
out
of
the
newspaper
she
found
one
evening
round
the
*NL*
potherbs
.
_
Art
thou
real
,
my
ideal
?
_
it
was
called
by
Louis
J
Walsh
,
*NL*
Magherafelt
,
and
after
there
was
something
about
_
twilight
,
wilt
thou
*NL*
ever
?
_
and
ofttimes
the
beauty
of
poetry
,
so
sad
in
its
transient
*NL*
loveliness
,
had
misted
her
eyes
with
silent
tears
for
she
felt
that
*NL*
the
years
were
slipping
by
for
her
,
one
by
one
,
and
but
for
that
one
*NL*
shortcoming
she
knew
she
need
fear
no
competition
and
that
was
an
*NL*
accident
coming
down
Dalkey
hill
and
she
always
tried
to
conceal
it
.
*NL*
But
it
must
end
,
she
felt
.
If
she
saw
that
magic
lure
in
his
eyes
there
*NL*
would
be
no
holding
back
for
her
.
Love
laughs
at
locksmiths
.
She
*NL*
would
make
the
great
sacrifice
.
Her
every
effort
would
be
to
share
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
Dearer
than
the
whole
world
would
she
be
to
him
and
gild
his
*NL*
days
with
happiness
.
There
was
the
allimportant
question
and
she
was
*NL*
dying
to
know
was
he
a
married
man
or
a
widower
who
had
lost
his
wife
*NL*
or
some
tragedy
like
the
nobleman
with
the
foreign
name
from
the
land
*NL*
of
song
had
to
have
her
put
into
a
madhouse
,
cruel
only
to
be
kind
.
*NL*
But
even
if
--
what
then
?
Would
it
make
a
very
great
difference
?
From
*NL*
everything
in
the
least
indelicate
her
finebred
nature
instinctively
*NL*
recoiled
.
She
loathed
that
sort
of
person
,
the
fallen
women
off
the
*NL*
accommodation
walk
beside
the
Dodder
that
went
with
the
soldiers
and
*NL*
coarse
men
with
no
respect
for
a
girl
's
honour
,
degrading
the
sex
and
*NL*
being
taken
up
to
the
police
station
.
No
,
no
:
not
that
.
They
would
be
*NL*
just
good
friends
like
a
big
brother
and
sister
without
all
that
other
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
conventions
of
Society
with
a
big
ess
.
Perhaps
it
was
*NL*
an
old
flame
he
was
in
mourning
for
from
the
days
beyond
recall
.
She
*NL*
thought
she
understood
.
She
would
try
to
understand
him
because
men
were
*NL*
so
different
.
The
old
love
was
waiting
,
waiting
with
little
white
*NL*
hands
stretched
out
,
with
blue
appealing
eyes
.
Heart
of
mine
!
She
would
*NL*
follow
,
her
dream
of
love
,
the
dictates
of
her
heart
that
told
her
he
*NL*
was
her
all
in
all
,
the
only
man
in
all
the
world
for
her
for
love
was
*NL*
the
master
guide
.
Nothing
else
mattered
.
Come
what
might
she
would
be
*NL*
wild
,
untrammelled
,
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Canon
O'Hanlon
put
the
Blessed
Sacrament
back
into
the
tabernacle
and
*NL*
genuflected
and
the
choir
sang
_
Laudate
Dominum
omnes
gentes
_
and
then
*NL*
he
locked
the
tabernacle
door
because
the
benediction
was
over
and
*NL*
Father
Conroy
handed
him
his
hat
to
put
on
and
crosscat
Edy
asked
was
n't
*NL*
she
coming
but
Jacky
Caffrey
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
,
look
,
Cissy
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
all
looked
was
it
sheet
lightning
but
Tommy
saw
it
too
over
the
*NL*
trees
beside
the
church
,
blue
and
then
green
and
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
fireworks
,
Cissy
Caffrey
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
all
ran
down
the
strand
to
see
over
the
houses
and
the
church
,
*NL*
helterskelter
,
Edy
with
the
pushcar
with
baby
Boardman
in
it
and
Cissy
*NL*
holding
Tommy
and
Jacky
by
the
hand
so
they
would
n't
fall
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
on
,
Gerty
,
Cissy
called
.
It
's
the
bazaar
fireworks
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Gerty
was
adamant
.
She
had
no
intention
of
being
at
their
beck
and
*NL*
call
.
If
they
could
run
like
rossies
she
could
sit
so
she
said
she
could
*NL*
see
from
where
she
was
.
The
eyes
that
were
fastened
upon
her
set
her
*NL*
pulses
tingling
.
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
meeting
his
glance
,
and
*NL*
a
light
broke
in
upon
her
.
Whitehot
passion
was
in
that
face
,
passion
*NL*
silent
as
the
grave
,
and
it
had
made
her
his
.
At
last
they
were
left
*NL*
alone
without
the
others
to
pry
and
pass
remarks
and
she
knew
he
could
*NL*
be
trusted
to
the
death
,
steadfast
,
a
sterling
man
,
a
man
of
inflexible
*NL*
honour
to
his
fingertips
.
His
hands
and
face
were
working
and
a
tremour
*NL*
went
over
her
.
She
leaned
back
far
to
look
up
where
the
fireworks
were
*NL*
and
she
caught
her
knee
in
her
hands
so
as
not
to
fall
back
looking
up
*NL*
and
there
was
no-one
to
see
only
him
and
her
when
she
revealed
all
her
*NL*
graceful
beautifully
shaped
legs
like
that
,
supply
soft
and
delicately
*NL*
rounded
,
and
she
seemed
to
hear
the
panting
of
his
heart
,
his
hoarse
*NL*
breathing
,
because
she
knew
too
about
the
passion
of
men
like
that
,
*NL*
hotblooded
,
because
Bertha
Supple
told
her
once
in
dead
secret
and
made
*NL*
her
swear
she
'd
never
about
the
gentleman
lodger
that
was
staying
with
*NL*
them
out
of
the
Congested
Districts
Board
that
had
pictures
cut
out
of
*NL*
papers
of
those
skirtdancers
and
highkickers
and
she
said
he
used
to
do
*NL*
something
not
very
nice
that
you
could
imagine
sometimes
in
the
bed
.
But
*NL*
this
was
altogether
different
from
a
thing
like
that
because
there
was
*NL*
all
the
difference
because
she
could
almost
feel
him
draw
her
face
to
*NL*
his
and
the
first
quick
hot
touch
of
his
handsome
lips
.
Besides
there
*NL*
was
absolution
so
long
as
you
did
n't
do
the
other
thing
before
being
*NL*
married
and
there
ought
to
be
women
priests
that
would
understand
*NL*
without
your
telling
out
and
Cissy
Caffrey
too
sometimes
had
that
dreamy
*NL*
kind
of
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
so
that
she
too
,
my
dear
,
and
Winny
*NL*
Rippingham
so
mad
about
actors
'
photographs
and
besides
it
was
on
*NL*
account
of
that
other
thing
coming
on
the
way
it
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jacky
Caffrey
shouted
to
look
,
there
was
another
and
she
leaned
back
*NL*
and
the
garters
were
blue
to
match
on
account
of
the
transparent
and
*NL*
they
all
saw
it
and
they
all
shouted
to
look
,
look
,
there
it
was
and
*NL*
she
leaned
back
ever
so
far
to
see
the
fireworks
and
something
queer
was
*NL*
flying
through
the
air
,
a
soft
thing
,
to
and
fro
,
dark
.
And
she
saw
a
*NL*
long
Roman
candle
going
up
over
the
trees
,
up
,
up
,
and
,
in
the
tense
*NL*
hush
,
they
were
all
breathless
with
excitement
as
it
went
higher
and
*NL*
higher
and
she
had
to
lean
back
more
and
more
to
look
up
after
it
,
high
,
*NL*
high
,
almost
out
of
sight
,
and
her
face
was
suffused
with
a
divine
,
an
*NL*
entrancing
blush
from
straining
back
and
he
could
see
her
other
things
*NL*
too
,
nainsook
knickers
,
the
fabric
that
caresses
the
skin
,
better
than
*NL*
those
other
pettiwidth
,
the
green
,
four
and
eleven
,
on
account
of
being
*NL*
white
and
she
let
him
and
she
saw
that
he
saw
and
then
it
went
so
high
*NL*
it
went
out
of
sight
a
moment
and
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
from
*NL*
being
bent
so
far
back
that
he
had
a
full
view
high
up
above
her
knee
*NL*
where
no-one
ever
not
even
on
the
swing
or
wading
and
she
was
n't
ashamed
*NL*
and
he
was
n't
either
to
look
in
that
immodest
way
like
that
because
he
*NL*
could
n't
resist
the
sight
of
the
wondrous
revealment
half
offered
like
*NL*
those
skirtdancers
behaving
so
immodest
before
gentlemen
looking
and
he
*NL*
kept
on
looking
,
looking
.
She
would
fain
have
cried
to
him
chokingly
,
*NL*
held
out
her
snowy
slender
arms
to
him
to
come
,
to
feel
his
lips
laid
on
*NL*
her
white
brow
,
the
cry
of
a
young
girl
's
love
,
a
little
strangled
cry
,
*NL*
wrung
from
her
,
that
cry
that
has
rung
through
the
ages
.
And
then
a
*NL*
rocket
sprang
and
bang
shot
blind
blank
and
O
!
then
the
Roman
candle
*NL*
burst
and
it
was
like
a
sigh
of
O
!
and
everyone
cried
O
!
O
!
in
raptures
*NL*
and
it
gushed
out
of
it
a
stream
of
rain
gold
hair
threads
and
they
*NL*
shed
and
ah
!
they
were
all
greeny
dewy
stars
falling
with
golden
,
O
so
*NL*
lovely
,
O
,
soft
,
sweet
,
soft
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
melted
away
dewily
in
the
grey
air
:
all
was
silent
.
Ah
!
She
*NL*
glanced
at
him
as
she
bent
forward
quickly
,
a
pathetic
little
glance
of
*NL*
piteous
protest
,
of
shy
reproach
under
which
he
coloured
like
a
girl
He
*NL*
was
leaning
back
against
the
rock
behind
.
Leopold
Bloom
-LRB-
for
it
is
he
-RRB-
*NL*
stands
silent
,
with
bowed
head
before
those
young
guileless
eyes
.
What
a
*NL*
brute
he
had
been
!
At
it
again
?
A
fair
unsullied
soul
had
called
to
him
*NL*
and
,
wretch
that
he
was
,
how
had
he
answered
?
An
utter
cad
he
had
been
!
*NL*
He
of
all
men
!
But
there
was
an
infinite
store
of
mercy
in
those
eyes
,
*NL*
for
him
too
a
word
of
pardon
even
though
he
had
erred
and
sinned
and
*NL*
wandered
.
Should
a
girl
tell
?
No
,
a
thousand
times
no
.
That
was
their
*NL*
secret
,
only
theirs
,
alone
in
the
hiding
twilight
and
there
was
none
to
*NL*
know
or
tell
save
the
little
bat
that
flew
so
softly
through
the
evening
*NL*
to
and
fro
and
little
bats
do
n't
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cissy
Caffrey
whistled
,
imitating
the
boys
in
the
football
field
to
show
*NL*
what
a
great
person
she
was
:
and
then
she
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Gerty
!
Gerty
!
We
're
going
.
Come
on
.
We
can
see
from
farther
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerty
had
an
idea
,
one
of
love
's
little
ruses
.
She
slipped
a
hand
into
*NL*
her
kerchief
pocket
and
took
out
the
wadding
and
waved
in
reply
of
*NL*
course
without
letting
him
and
then
slipped
it
back
.
Wonder
if
he
's
too
*NL*
far
to
.
She
rose
.
Was
it
goodbye
?
No
.
She
had
to
go
but
they
would
meet
*NL*
again
,
there
,
and
she
would
dream
of
that
till
then
,
tomorrow
,
of
her
*NL*
dream
of
yester
eve
.
She
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
.
Their
souls
*NL*
met
in
a
last
lingering
glance
and
the
eyes
that
reached
her
heart
,
full
*NL*
of
a
strange
shining
,
hung
enraptured
on
her
sweet
flowerlike
face
.
She
*NL*
half
smiled
at
him
wanly
,
a
sweet
forgiving
smile
,
a
smile
that
verged
*NL*
on
tears
,
and
then
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
,
without
looking
back
she
went
down
the
uneven
strand
to
Cissy
,
*NL*
to
Edy
to
Jacky
and
Tommy
Caffrey
,
to
little
baby
Boardman
.
It
was
*NL*
darker
now
and
there
were
stones
and
bits
of
wood
on
the
strand
and
*NL*
slippy
seaweed
.
She
walked
with
a
certain
quiet
dignity
characteristic
*NL*
of
her
but
with
care
and
very
slowly
because
--
because
Gerty
MacDowell
*NL*
was
...
*NL*
*NL*
Tight
boots
?
No
.
She
's
lame
!
O
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
watched
her
as
she
limped
away
.
Poor
girl
!
That
's
why
she
's
*NL*
left
on
the
shelf
and
the
others
did
a
sprint
.
Thought
something
was
*NL*
wrong
by
the
cut
of
her
jib
.
Jilted
beauty
.
A
defect
is
ten
times
worse
*NL*
in
a
woman
.
But
makes
them
polite
.
Glad
I
did
n't
know
it
when
she
was
on
*NL*
show
.
Hot
little
devil
all
the
same
.
I
would
n't
mind
.
Curiosity
like
a
*NL*
nun
or
a
negress
or
a
girl
with
glasses
.
That
squinty
one
is
delicate
.
*NL*
Near
her
monthlies
,
I
expect
,
makes
them
feel
ticklish
.
I
have
such
*NL*
a
bad
headache
today
.
Where
did
I
put
the
letter
?
Yes
,
all
right
.
All
*NL*
kinds
of
crazy
longings
.
Licking
pennies
.
Girl
in
Tranquilla
convent
*NL*
that
nun
told
me
liked
to
smell
rock
oil
.
Virgins
go
mad
in
the
end
I
*NL*
suppose
.
Sister
?
How
many
women
in
Dublin
have
it
today
?
Martha
,
she
.
*NL*
Something
in
the
air
.
That
's
the
moon
.
But
then
why
do
n't
all
women
*NL*
menstruate
at
the
same
time
with
the
same
moon
,
I
mean
?
Depends
on
the
*NL*
time
they
were
born
I
suppose
.
Or
all
start
scratch
then
get
out
of
*NL*
step
.
Sometimes
Molly
and
Milly
together
.
Anyhow
I
got
the
best
of
that
.
*NL*
Damned
glad
I
did
n't
do
it
in
the
bath
this
morning
over
her
silly
I
*NL*
will
punish
you
letter
.
Made
up
for
that
tramdriver
this
morning
.
That
*NL*
gouger
M'Coy
stopping
me
to
say
nothing
.
And
his
wife
engagement
in
the
*NL*
country
valise
,
voice
like
a
pickaxe
.
Thankful
for
small
mercies
.
*NL*
Cheap
too
.
Yours
for
the
asking
.
Because
they
want
it
themselves
.
Their
*NL*
natural
craving
.
Shoals
of
them
every
evening
poured
out
of
offices
.
*NL*
Reserve
better
.
Do
n't
want
it
they
throw
it
at
you
.
Catch
em
alive
,
O.
*NL*
Pity
they
ca
n't
see
themselves
.
A
dream
of
wellfilled
hose
.
Where
was
*NL*
that
?
Ah
,
yes
.
Mutoscope
pictures
in
Capel
street
:
for
men
only
.
Peeping
*NL*
Tom
.
Willy
's
hat
and
what
the
girls
did
with
it
.
Do
they
snapshot
those
*NL*
girls
or
is
it
all
a
fake
?
_
Lingerie

Felt

_
Excites
them
also
when
they
're
.
I
'm
all
clean
*NL*
come
and
dirty
me
.
And
they
like
dressing
one
another
for
the
sacrifice
.
*NL*
Milly
delighted
with
Molly
's
new
blouse
.
At
first
.
Put
them
all
on
to
*NL*
take
them
all
off
.
Molly
.
Why
I
bought
her
the
violet
garters
.
Us
too
:
*NL*
the
tie
he
wore
,
his
lovely
socks
and
turnedup
trousers
.
He
wore
a
pair
*NL*
of
gaiters
the
night
that
first
we
met
.
His
lovely
shirt
was
shining
*NL*
beneath
his
what
?
of
jet
.
Say
a
woman
loses
a
charm
with
every
pin
she
*NL*
takes
out
.
Pinned
together
.
O
,
Mairy
lost
the
pin
of
her
.
Dressed
up
to
*NL*
the
nines
for
somebody
.
Fashion
part
of
their
charm
.
Just
changes
when
*NL*
you
're
on
the
track
of
the
secret
.
Except
the
east
:
Mary
,
Martha
:
now
as
*NL*
then
.
No
reasonable
offer
refused
.
She
was
n't
in
a
hurry
either
.
Always
*NL*
off
to
a
fellow
when
they
are
.
They
never
forget
an
appointment
.
Out
on
*NL*
spec
probably
.
They
believe
in
chance
because
like
themselves
.
And
the
*NL*
others
inclined
to
give
her
an
odd
dig
.
Girl
friends
at
school
,
arms
*NL*
round
each
other
's
necks
or
with
ten
fingers
locked
,
kissing
and
*NL*
whispering
secrets
about
nothing
in
the
convent
garden
.
Nuns
with
*NL*
whitewashed
faces
,
cool
coifs
and
their
rosaries
going
up
and
down
,
*NL*
vindictive
too
for
what
they
ca
n't
get
.
Barbed
wire
.
Be
sure
now
and
*NL*
write
to
me
.
And
I
'll
write
to
you
.
Now
wo
n't
you
?
Molly
and
Josie

Till
Mr
Right
comes
along

O

look

it
is
for
the
love
of
God
!
How
are
you
at
all
?
*NL*
What
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
?
Kiss
and
delighted
to
,
kiss
,
*NL*
to
see
you

Picking
holes
in
each

You
're
looking
*NL*
splendid
.
Sister

Showing
their

at

How
many
*NL*
have
you
left
?
Would
n't
lend
each
other
a
pinch
of
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
*NL*
*NL*
Devils
they
are
when
that
's
coming
on
them
.
Dark
devilish
appearance
.
*NL*
Molly
often
told
me
feel
things
a
ton
weight
.
Scratch
the
sole
of
my
*NL*
foot
.
O
that
way
!
O
,
that
's
exquisite
!
Feel
it
myself
too
.
Good
to
rest
*NL*
once
in
a
way
.
Wonder
if
it
's
bad
to
go
with
them
then
.
Safe
in
one
way
.
*NL*
Turns
milk
,
makes
fiddlestrings
snap
.
Something
about
withering
plants
I
*NL*
read
in
a
garden
.
Besides
they
say
if
the
flower
withers
she
wears
she
's
*NL*
a
flirt
.
All
are

Daresay

felt

.
When
you
feel
like
that
you
often
*NL*
meet
what
you
feel
.
Liked
me
or
what
?
Dress
they
look
at
.
Always
know
a
*NL*
fellow
courting
:
collars
and
cuffs
.
Well
cocks
and
lions
do
the
same
*NL*
and
stags
.
Same
time
might
prefer
a
tie
undone
or
something
.
Trousers
?
*NL*
Suppose
I
when
I
was
?
No
.
Gently
does
it
.
Dislike
rough
and
tumble
.
Kiss
*NL*
in
the
dark
and
never
tell
.
Saw
something
in
me
.
Wonder
what
.
Sooner
*NL*
have
me
as
I
am
than
some
poet
chap
with
bearsgrease
plastery
hair
,
*NL*
lovelock
over
his
dexter
optic
.
To
aid
gentleman
in
literary
.
Ought
to
*NL*
attend
to
my
appearance
my
age
.
Did
n't
let
her
see
me
in
profile
.
Still
,
*NL*
you
never
know
.
Pretty
girls
and
ugly
men
marrying
.
Beauty
and
the
*NL*
beast
.
Besides
I
ca
n't
be
so
if
Molly
.
Took
off
her
hat
to
show
her
*NL*
hair
.
Wide
brim
.
Bought
to
hide
her
face
,
meeting
someone
might
know
*NL*
her
,
bend
down
or
carry
a
bunch
of
flowers
to
smell
.
Hair
strong
in

*NL*
Ten
bob
I
got
for
Molly
's
combings
when
we
were
on
the
rocks
in
Holles
*NL*
street
.
Why
not
?
Suppose
he
gave
her
money
.
Why
not
?
All
a
prejudice
.
*NL*
She
's
worth
ten
,
fifteen
,
more
,
a
pound
.
What
?
I
think
so
.
All
that
for
*NL*
nothing
.
Bold
hand
:
Mrs
Marion
.
Did
I
forget
to
write
address
on
*NL*
that
letter
like
the
postcard
I
sent
to
Flynn
?
And
the
day
I
went
to
*NL*
Drimmie
's
without
a
necktie
.
Wrangle
with
Molly
it
was
put
me
off

No

Ah

Mr

recomposed
his

O
Lord
,
that
little
*NL*
limping
devil
.
Begins
to
feel
cold
and
clammy
.
Aftereffect
not
pleasant
.
*NL*
Still
you
have
to
get
rid
of
it
someway
.
They
do
n't
care
.
Complimented
*NL*
perhaps
.
Go
home
to

milky

say
night

Well

good
evening
,
and
you
see
she
's
on
for
it
:
good
evening
.
O
*NL*
but
the
dark
evening
in
the
Appian
way
I
nearly
spoke
to
Mrs
Clinch
O
*NL*
thinking
she
was
.
Whew
!
Girl
in
Meath
street
that
night
.
All
the
dirty
*NL*
things
I
made
her
say
.
All
wrong
of
course
.
My
arks
she
called
it
.
It
's
*NL*
so
hard
to
find
one
who
.
Aho
!
If
you
do
n't
answer
when
they
solicit
must
*NL*
be
horrible
for
them
till
they
harden
.
And
kissed
my
hand
when
I
gave
*NL*
her
the
extra
two
shillings
.
Parrots
.
Press
the
button
and
the
bird
will
*NL*
squeak
.
Wish
she
had
n't
called
me
sir
.
O
,
her
mouth
in
the
dark
!
And
you
*NL*
a
married
man
with
a
single
girl
!
That
's
what
they
enjoy
.
Taking
a
man
*NL*
from
another
woman
.
Or
even
hear
of
it
.
Different
with
me
.
Glad
to
get
*NL*
away
from
other
chap
's
wife
.
Eating
off
his
cold
plate
.
Chap
in
the
*NL*
Burton
today
spitting
back
gumchewed
gristle
.
French
letter
still
in
*NL*
my
pocketbook
.
Cause
of
half
the
trouble
.
But
might
happen
sometime
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
.
Come
in
,
all
is
prepared
.
I
dreamt
.
What
?
Worst
is
*NL*
beginning
.
How
they
change
the
venue
when
it
's
not
what
they
like
.
Ask
*NL*
you
do
you
like
mushrooms
because
she
once
knew
a
gentleman
who
.
Or
ask
*NL*
you
what
someone
was
going
to
say
when
he
changed
his
mind
and
stopped
.
*NL*
Yet
if
I
went
the
whole
hog
,
say
:
I
want
to
,
something
like
that
.
*NL*
Because
I
did
.
She
too
.
Offend
her
.
Then
make
it
up
.
Pretend
to
want
*NL*
something
awfully
,
then
cry
off
for
her
sake
.
Flatters
them
.
She
must
*NL*
have
been
thinking
of
someone
else
all
the
time
.
What
harm
?
Must
since
*NL*
she
came
to
the
use
of
reason
,
he
,
he
and
he
.
First
kiss
does
the
trick
.
*NL*
The
propitious
moment
.
Something
inside
them
goes
pop
.
Mushy
like
,
tell
*NL*
by
their
eye
,
on
the
sly
.
First
thoughts
are
best
.
Remember
that
till
*NL*
their
dying
day
.
Molly
,
lieutenant
Mulvey
that
kissed
her
under
the
*NL*
Moorish
wall
beside
the
gardens
.
Fifteen
she
told
me
.
But
her
breasts
*NL*
were
developed
.
Fell
asleep
then
.
After
Glencree
dinner
that
was
when
we
*NL*
drove
home
.
Featherbed
mountain
.
Gnashing
her
teeth
in
sleep
.
Lord
mayor
*NL*
had
his
eye
on
her
too
.
Val
Dillon
.
Apoplectic
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
is
with
them
down
there
for
the
fireworks
.
My
fireworks
.
Up
*NL*
like
a
rocket
,
down
like
a
stick
.
And
the
children
,
twins
they
must
*NL*
be
,
waiting
for
something
to
happen
.
Want
to
be
grownups
.
Dressing
in
*NL*
mother
's
clothes
.
Time
enough
,
understand
all
the
ways
of
the
world
.
And
*NL*
the
dark
one
with
the
mop
head
and
the
nigger
mouth
.
I
knew
she
could
*NL*
whistle
.
Mouth
made
for
that
.
Like
Molly
.
Why
that
highclass
whore
in
*NL*
Jammet
's
wore
her
veil
only
to
her
nose
.
Would
you
mind
,
please
,
telling
*NL*
me
the
right
time
?
I
'll
tell
you
the
right
time
up
a
dark
lane
.
*NL*
Say
prunes
and
prisms
forty
times
every
morning
,
cure
for
fat
lips
.
*NL*
Caressing
the
little
boy
too
.
Onlookers
see
most
of
the
game
.
Of
course
*NL*
they
understand
birds
,
animals
,
babies
.
In
their
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
n't
look
back
when
she
was
going
down
the
strand
.
Would
n't
give
that
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Those
girls
,
those
girls
,
those
lovely
seaside
girls
.
Fine
*NL*
eyes
she
had
,
clear
.
It
's
the
white
of
the
eye
brings
that
out
not
so
*NL*
much
the
pupil
.
Did
she
know
what
I
?
Course
.
Like
a
cat
sitting
beyond
*NL*
a
dog
's
jump
.
Women
never
meet
one
like
that
Wilkins
in
the
high
school
*NL*
drawing
a
picture
of
Venus
with
all
his
belongings
on
show
.
Call
that
*NL*
innocence
?
Poor
idiot
!
His
wife
has
her
work
cut
out
for
her
.
Never
see
*NL*
them
sit
on
a
bench
marked
_
Wet
Paint
_
.
Eyes
all
over
them
.
Look
under
*NL*
the
bed
for
what
's
not
there
.
Longing
to
get
the
fright
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
Sharp
as
needles
they
are
.
When
I
said
to
Molly
the
man
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Cuffe
street
was
goodlooking
,
thought
she
might
like
,
twigged
at
once
he
*NL*
had
a
false
arm
.
Had
,
too
.
Where
do
they
get
that
?
Typist
going
up
Roger
*NL*
Greene
's
stairs
two
at
a
time
to
show
her
understandings
.
Handed
down
*NL*
from
father
to
,
mother
to
daughter
,
I
mean
.
Bred
in
the
bone
.
Milly
for
*NL*
example
drying
her
handkerchief
on
the
mirror
to
save
the
ironing
.
Best
*NL*
place
for
an
ad
to
catch
a
woman
's
eye
on
a
mirror
.
And
when
I
sent
*NL*
her
for
Molly
's
Paisley
shawl
to
Prescott
's
by
the
way
that
ad
I
must
,
*NL*
carrying
home
the
change
in
her
stocking
!
Clever
little
minx
.
I
never
*NL*
told
her
.
Neat
way
she
carries
parcels
too
.
Attract
men
,
small
thing
*NL*
like
that
.
Holding
up
her
hand
,
shaking
it
,
to
let
the
blood
flow
back
*NL*
when
it
was
red
.
Who
did
you
learn
that
from
?
Nobody
.
Something
the
*NL*
nurse
taught
me
.
O
,
do
n't
they
know
!
Three
years
old
she
was
in
front
of
*NL*
Molly
's
dressingtable
,
just
before
we
left
Lombard
street
west
.
Me
have
*NL*
a
nice
pace
.
Mullingar
.
Who
knows
?
Ways
of
the
world
.
Young
student
.
*NL*
Straight
on
her
pins
anyway
not
like
the
other
.
Still
she
was
game
.
*NL*
Lord
,
I
am
wet
.
Devil
you
are
.
Swell
of
her
calf
.
Transparent
stockings
,
*NL*
stretched
to
breaking
point
.
Not
like
that
frump
today
.
A.
E.
Rumpled
*NL*
stockings
.
Or
the
one
in
Grafton
street
.
White
.
Wow
!
Beef
to
the
heel
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
monkey
puzzle
rocket
burst
,
spluttering
in
darting
crackles
.
Zrads
and
*NL*
zrads
,
zrads
,
zrads
.
And
Cissy
and
Tommy
and
Jacky
ran
out
to
see
and
*NL*
Edy
after
with
the
pushcar
and
then
Gerty
beyond
the
curve
of
the
rocks
.
*NL*
Will
she
?
Watch
!
Watch
!
See
!
Looked
round
.
She
smelt
an
onion
.
Darling
,
*NL*
I
saw
,
your
.
I
saw
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
!
*NL*
*NL*
Did
me
good
all
the
same
.
Off
colour
after
Kiernan
's
,
Dignam
's
.
For
*NL*
this
relief
much
thanks
.
In
_
Hamlet
,
_
that
is
.
Lord
!
It
was
all
things
*NL*
combined
.
Excitement
.
When
she
leaned
back
,
felt
an
ache
at
the
butt
*NL*
of
my
tongue
.
Your
head
it
simply
swirls
.
He
's
right
.
Might
have
made
a
*NL*
worse
fool
of
myself
however
.
Instead
of
talking
about
nothing
.
Then
*NL*
I
will
tell
you
all
.
Still
it
was
a
kind
of
language
between
us
.
It
*NL*
could
n't
be
?
No
,
Gerty
they
called
her
.
Might
be
false
name
however
like
*NL*
my
name
and
the
address
Dolphin
's
barn
a
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Her
maiden
name
was
Jemina
Brown
And
she
lived
with
her
mother
in
*NL*
Irishtown
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Place
made
me
think
of
that
I
suppose
.
All
tarred
with
the
same
brush
*NL*
Wiping
pens
in
their
stockings
.
But
the
ball
rolled
down
to
her
as
if
*NL*
it
understood
.
Every
bullet
has
its
billet
.
Course
I
never
could
throw
*NL*
anything
straight
at
school
.
Crooked
as
a
ram
's
horn
.
Sad
however
*NL*
because
it
lasts
only
a
few
years
till
they
settle
down
to
potwalloping
*NL*
and
papa
's
pants
will
soon
fit
Willy
and
fuller
's
earth
for
the
baby
*NL*
when
they
hold
him
out
to
do
ah
ah
.
No
soft
job
.
Saves
them
.
Keeps
*NL*
them
out
of
harm
's
way
.
Nature
.
Washing
child
,
washing
corpse
.
Dignam
.
*NL*
Children
's
hands
always
round
them
.
Cocoanut
skulls
,
monkeys
,
not
even
*NL*
closed
at
first
,
sour
milk
in
their
swaddles
and
tainted
curds
.
Ought
n't
*NL*
to
have
given
that
child
an
empty
teat
to
suck
.
Fill
it
up
with
wind
.
*NL*
Mrs
Beaufoy
,
Purefoy
.
Must
call
to
the
hospital
.
Wonder
is
nurse
Callan
*NL*
there
still
.
She
used
to
look
over
some
nights
when
Molly
was
in
the
*NL*
Coffee
Palace
.
That
young
doctor
O'Hare
I
noticed
her
brushing
his
coat
.
*NL*
And
Mrs
Breen
and
Mrs
Dignam
once
like
that
too
,
marriageable
.
Worst
*NL*
of
all
at
night
Mrs
Duggan
told
me
in
the
City
Arms
.
Husband
rolling
in
*NL*
drunk
,
stink
of
pub
off
him
like
a
polecat
.
Have
that
in
your
nose
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
whiff
of
stale
boose
.
Then
ask
in
the
morning
:
was
I
drunk
*NL*
last
night
?
Bad
policy
however
to
fault
the
husband
.
Chickens
come
home
*NL*
to
roost
.
They
stick
by
one
another
like
glue
.
Maybe
the
women
's
fault
*NL*
also
.
That
's
where
Molly
can
knock
spots
off
them
.
It
's
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
south
.
Moorish
.
Also
the
form
,
the
figure
.
Hands
felt
for
the
opulent
.
*NL*
Just
compare
for
instance
those
others
.
Wife
locked
up
at
home
,
skeleton
*NL*
in
the
cupboard
.
Allow
me
to
introduce
my
.
Then
they
trot
you
out
some
*NL*
kind
of
a
nondescript
,
would
n't
know
what
to
call
her
.
Always
see
a
*NL*
fellow
's
weak
point
in
his
wife
.
Still
there
's
destiny
in
it
,
falling
*NL*
in
love
.
Have
their
own
secrets
between
them
.
Chaps
that
would
go
to
the
*NL*
dogs
if
some
woman
did
n't
take
them
in
hand
.
Then
little
chits
of
girls
,
*NL*
height
of
a
shilling
in
coppers
,
with
little
hubbies
.
As
God
made
them
*NL*
he
matched
them
.
Sometimes
children
turn
out
well
enough
.
Twice
nought
*NL*
makes
one
.
Or
old
rich
chap
of
seventy
and
blushing
bride
.
Marry
in
May
*NL*
and
repent
in
December
.
This
wet
is
very
unpleasant
.
Stuck
.
Well
the
*NL*
foreskin
is
not
back
.
Better
detach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ow
!
*NL*
*NL*
Other
hand
a
sixfooter
with
a
wifey
up
to
his
watchpocket
.
Long
and
*NL*
the
short
of
it
.
Big
he
and
little
she
.
Very
strange
about
my
watch
.
*NL*
Wristwatches
are
always
going
wrong
.
Wonder
is
there
any
magnetic
*NL*
influence
between
the
person
because
that
was
about
the
time
he
.
Yes
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
at
once
.
Cat
's
away
,
the
mice
will
play
.
I
remember
looking
*NL*
in
Pill
lane
.
Also
that
now
is
magnetism
.
Back
of
everything
magnetism
.
*NL*
Earth
for
instance
pulling
this
and
being
pulled
.
That
causes
movement
.
*NL*
And
time
,
well
that
's
the
time
the
movement
takes
.
Then
if
one
thing
*NL*
stopped
the
whole
ghesabo
would
stop
bit
by
bit
.
Because
it
's
all
*NL*
arranged
.
Magnetic
needle
tells
you
what
's
going
on
in
the
sun
,
the
*NL*
stars
.
Little
piece
of
steel
iron
.
When
you
hold
out
the
fork
.
Come
.
*NL*
Come
.
Tip
.
Woman
and
man
that
is
.
Fork
and
steel
.
Molly
,
he
.
Dress
up
*NL*
and
look
and
suggest
and
let
you
see
and
see
more
and
defy
you
if
you
're
*NL*
a
man
to
see
that
and
,
like
a
sneeze
coming
,
legs
,
look
,
look
and
if
you
*NL*
have
any
guts
in
you
.
Tip
.
Have
to
let
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wonder
how
is
she
feeling
in
that
region
.
Shame
all
put
on
before
third
*NL*
person
.
More
put
out
about
a
hole
in
her
stocking
.
Molly
,
her
underjaw
*NL*
stuck
out
,
head
back
,
about
the
farmer
in
the
ridingboots
and
spurs
at
*NL*
the
horse
show
.
And
when
the
painters
were
in
Lombard
street
west
.
*NL*
Fine
voice
that
fellow
had
.
How
Giuglini
began
.
Smell
that
I
did
.
Like
*NL*
flowers
.
It
was
too
.
Violets
.
Came
from
the
turpentine
probably
in
the
*NL*
paint
.
Make
their
own
use
of
everything
.
Same
time
doing
it
scraped
her
*NL*
slipper
on
the
floor
so
they
would
n't
hear
.
But
lots
of
them
ca
n't
kick
*NL*
the
beam
,
I
think
.
Keep
that
thing
up
for
hours
.
Kind
of
a
general
all
*NL*
round
over
me
and
half
down
my
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wait
.
Hm
.
Hm
.
Yes
.
That
's
her
perfume
.
Why
she
waved
her
hand
.
I
leave
*NL*
you
this
to
think
of
me
when
I
'm
far
away
on
the
pillow
.
What
is
it
?
*NL*
Heliotrope
?
No
.
Hyacinth
?
Hm
.
Roses
,
I
think
.
She
'd
like
scent
of
that
*NL*
kind
.
Sweet
and
cheap
:
soon
sour
.
Why
Molly
likes
opoponax
.
Suits
her
,
*NL*
with
a
little
jessamine
mixed
.
Her
high
notes
and
her
low
notes
.
At
the
*NL*
dance
night
she
met
him
,
dance
of
the
hours
.
Heat
brought
it
out
.
She
*NL*
was
wearing
her
black
and
it
had
the
perfume
of
the
time
before
.
Good
*NL*
conductor
,
is
it
?
Or
bad
?
Light
too
.
Suppose
there
's
some
connection
.
*NL*
For
instance
if
you
go
into
a
cellar
where
it
's
dark
.
Mysterious
thing
*NL*
too
.
Why
did
I
smell
it
only
now
?
Took
its
time
in
coming
like
herself
,
*NL*
slow
but
sure
.
Suppose
it
's
ever
so
many
millions
of
tiny
grains
*NL*
blown
across
.
Yes
,
it
is
.
Because
those
spice
islands
,
Cinghalese
this
*NL*
morning
,
smell
them
leagues
off
.
Tell
you
what
it
is
.
It
's
like
a
fine
*NL*
fine
veil
or
web
they
have
all
over
the
skin
,
fine
like
what
do
you
*NL*
call
it
gossamer
,
and
they
're
always
spinning
it
out
of
them
,
fine
as
*NL*
anything
,
like
rainbow
colours
without
knowing
it
.
Clings
to
everything
*NL*
she
takes
off
.
Vamp
of
her
stockings
.
Warm
shoe
.
Stays
.
Drawers
:
little
*NL*
kick
,
taking
them
off
.
Byby
till
next
time
.
Also
the
cat
likes
to
sniff
*NL*
in
her
shift
on
the
bed
.
Know
her
smell
in
a
thousand
.
Bathwater
too
.
*NL*
Reminds
me
of
strawberries
and
cream
.
Wonder
where
it
is
really
.
There
*NL*
or
the
armpits
or
under
the
neck
.
Because
you
get
it
out
of
all
holes
*NL*
and
corners
.
Hyacinth
perfume
made
of
oil
of
ether
or
something
.
*NL*
Muskrat
.
Bag
under
their
tails
.
One
grain
pour
off

for

.
Dogs
*NL*
at
each
other
behind
.
Good
evening
.
Evening
.
How
do
you
sniff
?
Hm
.
Hm
.
*NL*
Very
well
,
thank
you
.
Animals
go
by
that
.
Yes
now
,
look
at
it
that
way
.
*NL*
We
're
the
same
.
Some
women
,
instance
,
warn
you
off
when
they
have
their
*NL*
period
.
Come
near
.
Then
get
a
hogo
you
could
hang
your
hat
on
.
Like
*NL*
what
?
Potted
herrings
gone
stale
or
.
Boof
!
Please
keep
off
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
they
get
a
man
smell
off
us
.
What
though
?
Cigary
gloves
long
*NL*
John
had
on
his
desk
the
other
day
.
Breath
?
What
you
eat
and
drink
gives
*NL*
that
.
No
.
Mansmell
,
I
mean
.
Must
be
connected
with
that
because
priests
*NL*
that
are
supposed
to
be
are
different
.
Women
buzz
round
it
like
flies
*NL*
round
treacle
.
Railed
off
the
altar
get
on
to
it
at
any
cost
.
The
tree
*NL*
of
forbidden
priest
.
O
,
father
,
will
you
?
Let
me
be
the
first
to
.
That
*NL*
diffuses
itself
all
through
the
body
,
permeates
.
Source
of
life
.
And
*NL*
it
's
extremely
curious
the
smell
.
Celery
sauce
.
Let
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
inserted
his
nose
.

Into

No

it
is

Ah
no
,
that
's
the
soap
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
by
the
by
that
lotion
.
I
knew
there
was
something
on
my
mind
.
Never
*NL*
went
back
and
the
soap
not
paid
.
Dislike
carrying
bottles
like
that
hag
*NL*
this
morning
.
Hynes
might
have
paid
me
that
three
shillings
.
I
could
*NL*
mention
Meagher
's
just
to
remind
him
.
Still
if
he
works
that
paragraph
.
*NL*
Two
and
nine
.
Bad
opinion
of
me
he
'll
have
.
Call
tomorrow
.
How
much
do
*NL*
I
owe
you
?
Three
and
nine
?
Two
and
nine
,
sir
.
Ah
.
Might
stop
him
giving
*NL*
credit
another
time
.
Lose
your
customers
that
way
.
Pubs
do
.
Fellows
run
*NL*
up
a
bill
on
the
slate
and
then
slinking
around
the
back
streets
into

somewhere
else

*NL*
Here
's
this
nobleman
passed
before
.
Blown
in
from
the
bay
.
Just
went
as
*NL*
far
as
turn
back
.
Always
at
home
at
dinnertime
.
Looks
mangled
out
:
had
a
*NL*
good
tuck
in
.
Enjoying
nature
now
.
Grace
after
meals
.
After
supper
walk
*NL*
a
mile
.
Sure
he
has
a
small
bank
balance
somewhere
,
government
sit
.
Walk
*NL*
after
him
now
make
him
awkward
like
those
newsboys
me
today
.
Still
you
*NL*
learn
something
.
See
ourselves
as
others
see
us
.
So
long
as
women
do
n't
*NL*
mock
what
matter
?
That
's
the
way
to
find
out
.
Ask
yourself
who
is
he

now

your

Molly

And
the

partial
to
his
drop

Curious
she
an
only

,
I
an
*NL*
only
child
.
So
it
returns

Think
you
're
escaping
and
run
into
yourself

*NL*
Longest
way

And
just
when

leaned

Twenty

What
is
that
flying
about
?
Swallow
?
Bat
probably
.
Thinks
I
'm
a

,
*NL*
so
blind
.
Have

Metempsychosis

They
believed
you

be

into

from
grief

Weeping
willow
.
Ba
.
There
he
goes
.
*NL*
Funny
little
beggar
.
Wonder
where
he
lives
.
Belfry
up
there
.
Very
*NL*
likely
.
Hanging
by
his
heels
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
.
Bell
scared
him
*NL*
out
,
I
suppose
.
Mass
seems
to
be
over

Could
hear
them
all
at
it

Pray
*NL*
for

And
pray
for

And
pray
for
us

Good
idea
the
repetition

Same
*NL*
thing
with
ads

Buy
from

And
buy
from
us
.
Yes
,
there
's
the
light
in
*NL*
the
priest
's
house
.
Their
frugal
meal
.
Remember
about
the
mistake
in
the
*NL*
valuation
when
I
was
in
Thom

Twentyeight
it
is
.
Two
houses
they
have
.
*NL*
Gabriel
Conroy
's
brother
is
curate
.
Ba
.
Again
.
Wonder
why
they
come
out
*NL*
at
night
like
mice
.
They
're
a
mixed
breed
.
Birds
are
like
hopping
mice
.
*NL*
What
frightens
them
,
light
or
noise
?
Better
sit
still
.
All
instinct
*NL*
like
the
bird
in
drouth
got
water
out
of
the
end
of
a
jar
by
throwing
*NL*
in
pebbles
.
Like
a
little
man
in
a
cloak
he
is
with
tiny
hands
.
Weeny
*NL*
bones
.
Almost
see
them
shimmering
,
kind
of
a
bluey
white
.
Colours
depend
*NL*
on
the
light
you
see
.
Stare
the
sun
for
example
like
the
eagle
then
look
*NL*
at
a
shoe
see
a
blotch
blob
yellowish
.
Wants
to
stamp
his
trademark
on
*NL*
everything
.
Instance
,
that
cat
this
morning
on
the
staircase
.
Colour
of
*NL*
brown
turf
.
Say
you
never
see
them
with
three
colours
.
Not
true
.
That
*NL*
half

tortoiseshell
in

_
City

with
the

Body
fifty

*NL*
Glass

That
's
how
that
wise
man
what
's
his
name
with
the
*NL*
burning
glass
.
Then
the
heather
goes
on
fire
.
It
ca
n't
be

'
*NL*
matches
.
What
?
Perhaps
the
sticks
dry
rub
together
in
the
wind
and

light
.
Or
broken

Who
knows

they
're
always
flying
for

Insects
?
That
bee
last
*NL*
week
got
into
the
room
playing
with
his
shadow
on
the
ceiling
.
Might
*NL*
be
the
one
bit
me
,
come
back
to
see
.
Birds
too
.
Never
find
out
.
Or
what
*NL*
they
say
.
Like
our
small
talk
.
And
says
she
and
says
he
.
Nerve
they
have
*NL*
to
fly
over
the
ocean
and
back
.
Lots
must
be
killed
in
storms
,
telegraph
*NL*
wires
.
Dreadful
life
sailors
have
too
.
Big
brutes
of
oceangoing
steamers
*NL*
floundering
along
in

lowing
out
like

_
Faugh

Ballagh
!
_
Out
of

bloody
curse
to

Others
in

,
bit
of
*NL*
a
handkerchief
sail
,
pitched
about
like
snuff
at
a
wake
when
the
stormy
*NL*
winds
do
blow
.
Married
too
.
Sometimes
away
for
years
at
the
ends
of
the
*NL*
earth
somewhere
.
No
ends
really
because
it
's
round
.
Wife
in
every
port

they
say
.
She
has
a
good
job

she
minds
it
till
Johnny
comes
marching
*NL*
home
again
.
If
ever
he
does

Smelling
the
tail
end
of
ports
.
How
can
*NL*
they
like
the
sea
?
Yet
they
do
.
The
anchor
's
weighed
.
Off
he
sails
with
*NL*
a
scapular
or
a
medal
on
him
for
luck
.
Well
.
And
the
tephilim
no
what
's
*NL*
this
they
call
it
poor
papa

father
had
on
his
door
to
touch
.
That
*NL*
brought
us
out
of
the
land
of
Egypt
and
into
the
house
of
bondage
.
*NL*
Something
in
all
those
superstitions
because
when
you
go
out
never
know
*NL*
what
dangers
.
Hanging
on
to
a
plank
or
astride
of
a
beam
for
grim
life
,
*NL*
lifebelt
round
him
,
gulping
salt
water
,
and
that
's
the
last
of
his
nibs
*NL*
till
the
sharks
catch
hold
of
him
.
Do
fish
ever
get
seasick
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
you
have
a

of

white

They
floated

fell
:
they
faded
.
The
*NL*
shepherd
's
hour
:
the
hour
of
folding
:
hour
of
tryst
.
From
house
to
*NL*
house
,
giving
his
everwelcome
double
knock
,
went
the
nine
o'clock
*NL*
postman
,
the
glowworm
's
lamp
at
his
belt
gleaming
here
and
there
through
*NL*
the
laurel
hedges
.
And
among
the
five
young
trees
a
hoisted
lintstock
*NL*
lit
the
lamp
at
Leahy
's
terrace
.
By
screens
of
lighted
windows
,
by
equal
*NL*
gardens
a
shrill
voice
went
crying
,
wailing
:
_

Gold
Cup

_
and
from
the
door
of
*NL*
Dignam
's
house
a
boy
ran
out
and
called
.
Twittering
the
bat
flew
here
,
*NL*
flew
there
.
Far
out
over
the
sands
the
coming
surf
crept
,
grey
.
Howth
*NL*
settled
for
slumber
,
tired
of
long
days
,
of
yumyum
rhododendrons
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
old
-RRB-
and
felt
gladly
the
night
breeze
lift
,
ruffle
his
fell
of
ferns
.
*NL*
He
lay
but
opened
a
red
eye
unsleeping
,
deep
and
slowly
breathing
,
*NL*
slumberous
but
awake
.
And
far
on
Kish
bank
the
anchored
lightship
*NL*
twinkled
,
winked
at
Mr
Bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
those
chaps
out
there
must
have
,
stuck
in
the
same
spot
.
Irish
*NL*
Lights
board
.
Penance
for
their
sins
.
Coastguards
too
.
Rocket
and
*NL*
breeches
buoy
and
lifeboat
.
Day
we
went
out
for
the
pleasure
cruise
in
*NL*
the
Erin
's
King
,
throwing
them
the
sack
of
old
papers
.
Bears
in
the
zoo
.
*NL*
Filthy
trip
.
Drunkards
out
to
shake
up
their
livers
.
Puking
overboard
*NL*
to
feed
the
herrings
.
Nausea
.
And
the
women
,
fear
of
God
in
their
faces
.
*NL*
Milly
,
no
sign
of
funk
.
Her
blue
scarf
loose
,
laughing
.
Do
n't
know
what
*NL*
death
is
at
that
age
.
And
then
their
stomachs
clean
.
But
being
lost
they
*NL*
fear
.
When
we
hid
behind
the
tree
at
Crumlin
.
I
did
n't
want
to
.
Mamma
!
*NL*
Mamma
!
Babes
in
the
wood
.
Frightening
them
with
masks
too
.
Throwing
them
*NL*
up
in
the
air
to
catch
them
.
I
'll
murder
you
.
Is
it
only
half
fun
?
Or
*NL*
children
playing
battle
.
Whole
earnest
.
How
can
people
aim
guns
at
each
*NL*
other
.
Sometimes
they
go
off
.
Poor

Only

Calomel

I
got
her
for
that
.
After
getting
better
*NL*
asleep
with
Molly
.
Very
same
teeth

has
.
What
do
they
love
?
Another
*NL*
themselves
?
But
the
morning
she
chased
her
with
the
umbrella
.
Perhaps
so
*NL*
as
not
to
hurt
.
I
felt
her
pulse
.
Ticking
.
Little
hand
it
was
:
now
big
.
*NL*
Dearest
Papli
.
All
that
the
hand
says
when
you
touch
.
Loved
to
count
*NL*
my
waistcoat
buttons
.
Her
first
stays
I
remember
.
Made
me
laugh
to
see
.
*NL*
Little
paps
to
begin
with
.
Left
one
is
more
sensitive
,
I
think
.
Mine
*NL*
too
.
Nearer
the
heart
?
Padding
themselves
out
if
fat
is
in
fashion
.
Her
*NL*
growing
pains
at
night
,
calling
,
wakening
me
.
Frightened
she
was
when
*NL*
her
nature
came
on
her
first
.
Poor
child
!
Strange
moment
for
the
mother
*NL*
too
.
Brings
back
her
girlhood
.
Gibraltar
.
Looking
from
Buena
Vista
.
*NL*
O'Hara

tower
.
The
seabirds
screaming
.
Old
Barbary
ape
that
gobbled
all
*NL*
his
family
.
Sundown
,
gunfire
for
the
men
to
cross
the
lines
.
Looking
*NL*
out
over
the
sea
she
told
me
.
Evening
like
this
,
but
clear
,
no

.
*NL*
I
always
thought
I
'd

Better
not

This

Call

Then
that

Got

Drunken

him

Mistake

Or

No

*NL*
Ought
to
go
home
and
laugh
at
themselves

Always
want
to
be
swilling
in
*NL*
company
.
Afraid
to
be
alone
like
a
child
of

.
Suppose
he
hit
me
.
Look
*NL*
at
it
other
way
round

Not
so
bad
then

Perhaps
not
to

meant

*NL*
Three

for

Three
cheers
for
the
sister-in-law
he
hawked
*NL*
about

three
fangs
in

mouth
.
Same
style
of
beauty
.
Particularly
nice
*NL*
old
party
for

cup
of
tea
.
The
sister
of
the
wife
of
the
wild
man
of

Borneo
has
just
come
to

Imagine
that
in

early
morning
at
close

range

Everyone
to

taste
as
Morris
said
when
he
kissed
the
cow

But
*NL*
Dignam

put
the
boots
on

Houses
of
mourning
so
depressing
because
*NL*
you
never
know

Anyhow
she
wants
the
money
.
Must
call
to
those
Scottish
*NL*
Widows
as
I
promised

Strange
name

Takes
it
for

we
're
going

pop
off
first

That
widow
on
Monday
was
it
outside
Cramer

*NL*
looked
at

Buried
the
poor

progressing

Her

Well

What
do

wheedle

along

Poor

Mr

Universally

concerning

held
as
most
profitably
by

the

by

high

deserving

constantly
maintain
*NL*
when
by

they
affirm
that
other

being

equal
by
no

is
the

more

For
who
is
there
who
anything
of

has

apprehended
but
is
conscious
that
that
exterior

may
be
the

on

anyone

unilluminated

not
to

that
as
no

*NL*

contend
against

so
it
behoves
every
most
just

to
become
the
exhortator

admonisher
of

*NL*
to
tremble
lest
what

excellently

commenced
might
be
in

not
with

traduced

the

to
that
thither
of

profundity
that
that
one
was
audacious
excessively
who
would
have
the

hardihood
to
rise
affirming
that
no

can
for

On

living
with
dear
wife
and
lovesome
daughter
that
then
over
land
*NL*
and

nine
years
had
long
outwandered
.
Once

in

*NL*
*NL*
As

she
feared

Glad
*NL*
after
she
was
that
ere

was
.
Her
he
asked
if
O'Hare
Doctor
tidings
*NL*
sent
from
far
coast
and
she
with
grameful
sigh
him
answered
that
O'Hare
*NL*
Doctor
in
heaven
was
.
Sad
was
the
man
that
word
to
hear
that
him
so
*NL*
heavied
in
bowels
ruthful
.
All
she
there
told
him
,
ruing
death
for
*NL*
friend
so
young
,
algate
sore
unwilling
God
's
rightwiseness
to

*NL*
She
said
that
he
had
a
fair
sweet
death
through
God
His
goodness
with
*NL*
masspriest
to
be
shriven
,
holy
housel
and
sick
men
's
oil
to
his

.
*NL*
The
man
then
right
earnest
asked
the
nun
of
which
death
the
dead
man
was
*NL*
died
and
the
nun
answered
him
and
said
that
he
was
died
in
Mona
Island
*NL*
through
bellycrab
three
year
agone
come
Childermas
and
she
prayed
to
God
*NL*
the
Allruthful
to
have
his
dear
soul
in
his
undeathliness
.
He
heard
her
*NL*
sad
words
,
in
held
hat
sad
staring
.
So
stood
they
there
both
awhile
in
*NL*
wanhope
sorrowing
one
with
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
everyman
,
look
to
that
last
end
that
is
thy
death
and
the
*NL*
dust
that
gripeth
on
every
man
that
is
born
of
woman
for
as
he
came
*NL*
naked
forth
from
his
mother
's
womb
so
naked
shall
he
wend
him
at
the
*NL*
last
for
to
go
as
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
that
was
come
in
to
the
house
then
spoke
to
the
nursingwoman
and
*NL*
he
asked
her
how
it
fared
with
the
woman
that
lay
there
in
childbed
.
*NL*
The
nursingwoman
answered
him
and
said
that
that
woman
was
in
throes
*NL*
now
full
three
days
and
that
it
would
be
a
hard
birth
unneth
to
bear
*NL*
but
that
now
in
a
little
it
would
be
.
She
said
thereto
that
she
had
*NL*
seen
many
births
of
women
but
never
was
none
so
hard
as
was
that
woman
's
*NL*
birth
.
Then
she
set
it
all
forth
to
him
for
because
she
knew
the
man
*NL*
that
time
was
had
lived
nigh
that
house
.
The
man
hearkened
to
her
words
*NL*
for
he
felt
with
wonder
women
's
woe
in
the
travail
that
they
have
of
*NL*
motherhood
and
he
wondered
to
look
on
her
face
that
was
a
fair
face
for
*NL*
any
man
to
see
but
yet
was
she
left
after
long
years
a
handmaid
.
Nine
*NL*
twelve
bloodflows
chiding
her
childless
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
whiles
they
spake
the
door
of
the
castle
was
opened
and
there
nighed
*NL*
them
a
mickle
noise
as
of
many
that
sat
there
at
meat
.
And
there
came
*NL*
against
the
place
as
they
stood
a
young
learningknight
yclept
Dixon
.
And
*NL*
the
traveller
Leopold
was
couth
to
him
sithen
it
had
happed
that
they
*NL*
had
had
ado
each
with
other
in
the
house
of
misericord
where
this
*NL*
learningknight
lay
by
cause
the
traveller
Leopold
came
there
to
be
*NL*
healed
for
he
was
sore
wounded
in
his
breast
by
a
spear
wherewith
a
*NL*
horrible
and
dreadful
dragon
was
smitten
him
for
which
he
did
do
make
*NL*
a
salve
of
volatile
salt
and
chrism
as
much
as
he
might
suffice
.
And
he
*NL*
said
now
that
he
should
go
in
to
that
castle
for
to
make
merry
with
*NL*
them
that
were
there
.
And
the
traveller
Leopold
said
that
he
should
go
*NL*
otherwhither
for
he
was
a
man
of
cautels
and
a
subtile
.
Also
the
lady
*NL*
was
of
his
avis
and
repreved
the
learningknight
though
she
trowed
well
*NL*
that
the
traveller
had
said
thing
that
was
false
for
his
subtility
.
But
*NL*
the
learningknight
would
not
hear
say
nay
nor
do
her
mandement
ne
have
*NL*
him
in
aught
contrarious
to
his
list
and
he
said
how
it
was
a
marvellous
*NL*
castle
.
And
the
traveller
Leopold
went
into
the
castle
for
to
rest
him
*NL*
for
a
space
being
sore
of
limb
after
many
marches
environing
in
divers
*NL*
lands
and
sometime
venery
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
castle
was
set
a
board
that
was
of
the
birchwood
of
Finlandy
*NL*
and
it
was
upheld
by
four
dwarfmen
of
that
country
but
they
durst
not
*NL*
move
more
for
enchantment
.
And
on
this
board
were
frightful
swords
and
*NL*
knives
that
are
made
in
a
great
cavern
by
swinking
demons
out
of
white
*NL*
flames
that
they
fix
then
in
the
horns
of
buffalos
and
stags
that
there
*NL*
abound
marvellously
.
And
there
were
vessels
that
are
wrought
by
magic
of
*NL*
Mahound
out
of
seasand
and
the
air
by
a
warlock
with
his
breath
that
he
*NL*
blases
in
to
them
like
to
bubbles
.
And
full
fair
cheer
and
rich
was
on
*NL*
the
board
that
no
wight
could
devise
a
fuller
ne
richer
.
And
there
was
*NL*
a
vat
of
silver
that
was
moved
by
craft
to
open
in
the
which
lay
strange
*NL*
fishes
withouten
heads
though
misbelieving
men
nie
that
this
be
possible
*NL*
thing
without
they
see
it
natheless
they
are
so
.
And
these
fishes
lie
*NL*
in
an
oily
water
brought
there
from
Portugal
land
because
of
the
fatness
*NL*
that
therein
is
like
to
the
juices
of
the
olivepress
.
And
also
it
was
*NL*
a
marvel
to
see
in
that
castle
how
by
magic
they
make
a
compost
out
of
*NL*
fecund
wheatkidneys
out
of
Chaldee
that
by
aid
of
certain
angry
spirits
*NL*
that
they
do
in
to
it
swells
up
wondrously
like
to
a
vast
mountain
.
And
*NL*
they
teach
the
serpents
there
to
entwine
themselves
up
on
long
sticks
*NL*
out
of
the
ground
and
of
the
scales
of
these
serpents
they
brew
out
a
*NL*
brewage
like
to
mead
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
learning
knight
let
pour
for
childe
Leopold
a
draught
and
halp
*NL*
thereto
the
while
all
they
that
were
there
drank
every
each
.
And
childe
*NL*
Leopold
did
up
his
beaver
for
to
pleasure
him
and
took
apertly
somewhat
*NL*
in
amity
for
he
never
drank
no
manner
of
mead
which
he
then
put
by
and
*NL*
anon
full
privily
he
voided
the
more
part
in
his
neighbour
glass
and
*NL*
his
neighbour
nist
not
of
this
wile
.
And
he
sat
down
in
that
castle
with
*NL*
them
for
to
rest
him
there
awhile
.
Thanked
be
Almighty
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
meanwhile
this
good
sister
stood
by
the
door
and
begged
them
at
the
*NL*
reverence
of
Jesu
our
alther
liege
Lord
to
leave
their
wassailing
for
*NL*
there
was
above
one
quick
with
child
,
a
gentle
dame
,
whose
time
hied
*NL*
fast
.
Sir
Leopold
heard
on
the
upfloor
cry
on
high
and
he
wondered
what
*NL*
cry
that
it
was
whether
of
child
or
woman
and
I
marvel
,
said
he
,
that
it
*NL*
be
not
come
or
now
.
Meseems
it
dureth
overlong
.
And
he
was
ware
and
saw
*NL*
a
franklin
that
hight
Lenehan
on
that
side
the
table
that
was
older
than
*NL*
any
of
the
tother
and
for
that
they
both
were
knights
virtuous
in
the
*NL*
one
emprise
and
eke
by
cause
that
he
was
elder
he
spoke
to
him
full
*NL*
gently
.
But
,
said
he
,
or
it
be
long
too
she
will
bring
forth
by
God
His
*NL*
bounty
and
have
joy
of
her
childing
for
she
hath
waited
marvellous
long
.
*NL*
And
the
franklin
that
had
drunken
said
,
Expecting
each
moment
to
be
her
*NL*
next
.
Also
he
took
the
cup
that
stood
tofore
him
for
him
needed
never
*NL*
none
asking
nor
desiring
of
him
to
drink
and
,
Now
drink
,
said
he
,
fully
*NL*
delectably
,
and
he
quaffed
as
far
as
he
might
to
their
both
's
health
for
*NL*
he
was
a
passing
good
man
of
his
lustiness
.
And
sir
Leopold
that
was
the
*NL*
goodliest
guest
that
ever
sat
in
scholars
'
hall
and
that
was
the
meekest
*NL*
man
and
the
kindest
that
ever
laid
husbandly
hand
under
hen
and
that
was
*NL*
the
very
truest
knight
of
the
world
one
that
ever
did
minion
service
*NL*
to
lady
gentle
pledged
him
courtly
in
the
cup
.
Woman
's
woe
with
wonder
*NL*
pondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
let
us
speak
of
that
fellowship
that
was
there
to
the
intent
to
be
*NL*
drunken
an
they
might
.
There
was
a
sort
of
scholars
along
either
side
*NL*
the
board
,
that
is
to
wit
,
Dixon
yclept
junior
of
saint
Mary
Merciable
's
*NL*
with
other
his
fellows
Lynch
and
Madden
,
scholars
of
medicine
,
and
the
*NL*
franklin
that
hight
Lenehan
and
one
from
Alba
Longa
,
one
Crotthers
,
and
*NL*
young
Stephen
that
had
mien
of
a
frere
that
was
at
head
of
the
board
*NL*
and
Costello
that
men
clepen
Punch
Costello
all
long
of
a
mastery
of
*NL*
him
erewhile
gested
-LRB-
and
of
all
them
,
reserved
young
Stephen
,
he
was
the
*NL*
most
drunken
that
demanded
still
of
more
mead
-RRB-
and
beside
the
meek
sir
*NL*
Leopold
.
But
on
young
Malachi
they
waited
for
that
he
promised
to
have
*NL*
come
and
such
as
intended
to
no
goodness
said
how
he
had
broke
his
avow
.
*NL*
And
sir
Leopold
sat
with
them
for
he
bore
fast
friendship
to
sir
Simon
*NL*
and
to
this
his
son
young
Stephen
and
for
that
his
languor
becalmed
him
*NL*
there
after
longest
wanderings
insomuch
as
they
feasted
him
for
that
*NL*
time
in
the
honourablest
manner
.
Ruth
red
him
,
love
led
on
with
will
to
*NL*
wander
,
loth
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
they
were
right
witty
scholars
.
And
he
heard
their
aresouns
each
gen
*NL*
other
as
touching
birth
and
righteousness
,
young
Madden
maintaining
that
*NL*
put
such
case
it
were
hard
the
wife
to
die
-LRB-
for
so
it
had
fallen
out
a
*NL*
matter
of
some
year
agone
with
a
woman
of
Eblana
in
Horne
's
house
that
*NL*
now
was
trespassed
out
of
this
world
and
the
self
night
next
before
her
*NL*
death
all
leeches
and
pothecaries
had
taken
counsel
of
her
case
-RRB-
.
And
*NL*
they
said
farther
she
should
live
because
in
the
beginning
,
they
said
,
*NL*
the
woman
should
bring
forth
in
pain
and
wherefore
they
that
were
of
*NL*
this
imagination
affirmed
how
young
Madden
had
said
truth
for
he
had
*NL*
conscience
to
let
her
die
.
And
not
few
and
of
these
was
young
Lynch
*NL*
were
in
doubt
that
the
world
was
now
right
evil
governed
as
it
was
never
*NL*
other
howbeit
the
mean
people
believed
it
otherwise
but
the
law
nor
his
*NL*
judges
did
provide
no
remedy
.
A
redress
God
grant
.
This
was
scant
said
*NL*
but
all
cried
with
one
acclaim
nay
,
by
our
Virgin
Mother
,
the
wife
*NL*
should
live
and
the
babe
to
die
.
In
colour
whereof
they
waxed
hot
*NL*
upon
that
head
what
with
argument
and
what
for
their
drinking
but
the
*NL*
franklin
Lenehan
was
prompt
each
when
to
pour
them
ale
so
that
at
the
*NL*
least
way
mirth
might
not
lack
.
Then
young
Madden
showed
all
the
whole
*NL*
affair
and
said
how
that
she
was
dead
and
how
for
holy
religion
sake
by
*NL*
rede
of
palmer
and
bedesman
and
for
a
vow
he
had
made
to
Saint
Ultan
of
*NL*
Arbraccan
her
goodman
husband
would
not
let
her
death
whereby
they
were
*NL*
all
wondrous
grieved
.
To
whom
young
Stephen
had
these
words
following
:
*NL*
Murmur
,
sirs
,
is
eke
oft
among
lay
folk
.
Both
babe
and
parent
now
*NL*
glorify
their
Maker
,
the
one
in
limbo
gloom
,
the
other
in
purgefire
.
*NL*
But
,
gramercy
,
what
of
those
Godpossibled
souls
that
we
nightly
*NL*
impossibilise
,
which
is
the
sin
against
the
Holy
Ghost
,
Very
God
,
Lord
*NL*
and
Giver
of
Life
?
For
,
sirs
,
he
said
,
our
lust
is
brief
.
We
are
means
*NL*
to
those
small
creatures
within
us
and
nature
has
other
ends
than
we
.
*NL*
Then
said
Dixon
junior
to
Punch
Costello
wist
he
what
ends
.
But
he
had
*NL*
overmuch
drunken
and
the
best
word
he
could
have
of
him
was
that
he
*NL*
would
ever
dishonest
a
woman
whoso
she
were
or
wife
or
maid
or
leman
if
*NL*
it
so
fortuned
him
to
be
delivered
of
his
spleen
of
lustihead
.
Whereat
*NL*
Crotthers
of
Alba
Longa
sang
young
Malachi
's
praise
of
that
beast
the
*NL*
unicorn
how
once
in
the
millennium
he
cometh
by
his
horn
,
the
other
all
*NL*
this
while
,
pricked
forward
with
their
jibes
wherewith
they
did
malice
*NL*
him
,
witnessing
all
and
several
by
saint
Foutinus
his
engines
that
*NL*
he
was
able
to
do
any
manner
of
thing
that
lay
in
man
to
do
.
Thereat
*NL*
laughed
they
all
right
jocundly
only
young
Stephen
and
sir
Leopold
which
*NL*
never
durst
laugh
too
open
by
reason
of
a
strange
humour
which
he
would
*NL*
not
bewray
and
also
for
that
he
rued
for
her
that
bare
whoso
she
might
*NL*
be
or
wheresoever
.
Then
spake
young
Stephen
orgulous
of
mother
Church
*NL*
that
would
cast
him
out
of
her
bosom
,
of
law
of
canons
,
of
Lilith
,
*NL*
patron
of
abortions
,
of
bigness
wrought
by
wind
of
seeds
of
brightness
*NL*
or
by
potency
of
vampires
mouth
to
mouth
or
,
as
Virgilius
saith
,
by
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
occident
or
by
the
reek
of
moonflower
or
an
she
lie
*NL*
with
a
woman
which
her
man
has
but
lain
with
,
_
effectu
secuto
_
,
or
*NL*
peradventure
in
her
bath
according
to
the
opinions
of
Averroes
and
Moses
*NL*
Maimonides
.
He
said
also
how
at
the
end
of
the
second
month
a
human
soul
*NL*
was
infused
and
how
in
all
our
holy
mother
foldeth
ever
souls
for
God
's
*NL*
greater
glory
whereas
that
earthly
mother
which
was
but
a
dam
to
bear
*NL*
beastly
should
die
by
canon
for
so
saith
he
that
holdeth
the
fisherman
's
*NL*
seal
,
even
that
blessed
Peter
on
which
rock
was
holy
church
for
all
ages
*NL*
founded
.
All
they
bachelors
then
asked
of
sir
Leopold
would
he
in
like
*NL*
case
so
jeopard
her
person
as
risk
life
to
save
life
.
A
wariness
of
*NL*
mind
he
would
answer
as
fitted
all
and
,
laying
hand
to
jaw
,
he
said
*NL*
dissembling
,
as
his
wont
was
,
that
as
it
was
informed
him
,
who
had
ever
*NL*
loved
the
art
of
physic
as
might
a
layman
,
and
agreeing
also
with
his
*NL*
experience
of
so
seldomseen
an
accident
it
was
good
for
that
mother
*NL*
Church
belike
at
one
blow
had
birth
and
death
pence
and
in
such
sort
*NL*
deliverly
he
scaped
their
questions
.
That
is
truth
,
pardy
,
said
Dixon
,
*NL*
and
,
or
I
err
,
a
pregnant
word
.
Which
hearing
young
Stephen
was
a
*NL*
marvellous
glad
man
and
he
averred
that
he
who
stealeth
from
the
poor
*NL*
lendeth
to
the
Lord
for
he
was
of
a
wild
manner
when
he
was
drunken
and
*NL*
that
he
was
now
in
that
taking
it
appeared
eftsoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
sir
Leopold
was
passing
grave
maugre
his
word
by
cause
he
still
had
*NL*
pity
of
the
terrorcausing
shrieking
of
shrill
women
in
their
labour
*NL*
and
as
he
was
minded
of
his
good
lady
Marion
that
had
borne
him
an
only
*NL*
manchild
which
on
his
eleventh
day
on
live
had
died
and
no
man
of
art
*NL*
could
save
so
dark
is
destiny
.
And
she
was
wondrous
stricken
of
heart
*NL*
for
that
evil
hap
and
for
his
burial
did
him
on
a
fair
corselet
of
*NL*
lamb
's
wool
,
the
flower
of
the
flock
,
lest
he
might
perish
utterly
and
*NL*
lie
akeled
-LRB-
for
it
was
then
about
the
midst
of
the
winter
-RRB-
and
now
Sir
*NL*
Leopold
that
had
of
his
body
no
manchild
for
an
heir
looked
upon
him
his
*NL*
friend
's
son
and
was
shut
up
in
sorrow
for
his
forepassed
happiness
and
*NL*
as
sad
as
he
was
that
him
failed
a
son
of
such
gentle
courage
-LRB-
for
all
*NL*
accounted
him
of
real
parts
-RRB-
so
grieved
he
also
in
no
less
measure
*NL*
for
young
Stephen
for
that
he
lived
riotously
with
those
wastrels
and
*NL*
murdered
his
goods
with
whores
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
that
present
time
young
Stephen
filled
all
cups
that
stood
empty
*NL*
so
as
there
remained
but
little
mo
if
the
prudenter
had
not
shadowed
*NL*
their
approach
from
him
that
still
plied
it
very
busily
who
,
praying
for
*NL*
the
intentions
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
,
he
gave
them
for
a
pledge
the
*NL*
vicar
of
Christ
which
also
as
he
said
is
vicar
of
Bray
.
Now
drink
we
,
*NL*
quod
he
,
of
this
mazer
and
quaff
ye
this
mead
which
is
not
indeed
parcel
*NL*
of
my
body
but
my
soul
's
bodiment
.
Leave
ye
fraction
of
bread
to
them
*NL*
that
live
by
bread
alone
.
Be
not
afeard
neither
for
any
want
for
this
*NL*
will
comfort
more
than
the
other
will
dismay
.
See
ye
here
.
And
he
showed
*NL*
them
glistering
coins
of
the
tribute
and
goldsmith
notes
the
worth
of
*NL*
two
pound
nineteen
shilling
that
he
had
,
he
said
,
for
a
song
which
he
*NL*
writ
.
They
all
admired
to
see
the
foresaid
riches
in
such
dearth
of
*NL*
money
as
was
herebefore
.
His
words
were
then
these
as
followeth
:
Know
*NL*
all
men
,
he
said
,
time
's
ruins
build
eternity
's
mansions
.
What
means
*NL*
this
?
Desire
's
wind
blasts
the
thorntree
but
after
it
becomes
from
a
*NL*
bramblebush
to
be
a
rose
upon
the
rood
of
time
.
Mark
me
now
.
In
woman
's
*NL*
womb
word
is
made
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
of
the
maker
all
flesh
*NL*
that
passes
becomes
the
word
that
shall
not
pass
away
.
This
is
the
*NL*
postcreation
.
_
Omnis
caro
ad
te
veniet
_
.
No
question
but
her
name
is
*NL*
puissant
who
aventried
the
dear
corse
of
our
Agenbuyer
,
Healer
and
Herd
,
*NL*
our
mighty
mother
and
mother
most
venerable
and
Bernardus
saith
aptly
*NL*
that
She
hath
an
_
omnipotentiam
deiparae
supplicem
_
,
that
is
to
wit
,
an
*NL*
almightiness
of
petition
because
she
is
the
second
Eve
and
she
won
*NL*
us
,
saith
Augustine
too
,
whereas
that
other
,
our
grandam
,
which
we
are
*NL*
linked
up
with
by
successive
anastomosis
of
navelcords
sold
us
all
,
*NL*
seed
,
breed
and
generation
,
for
a
penny
pippin
.
But
here
is
the
matter
*NL*
now
.
Or
she
knew
him
,
that
second
I
say
,
and
was
but
creature
of
her
*NL*
creature
,
_
vergine
madre
,
figlia
di
tuo
figlio
_
,
or
she
knew
him
not
and
*NL*
then
stands
she
in
the
one
denial
or
ignorancy
with
Peter
Piscator
who
*NL*
lives
in
the
house
that
Jack
built
and
with
Joseph
the
joiner
patron
of
*NL*
the
happy
demise
of
all
unhappy
marriages
,
_

M.
Leo

Entweder
_
transubstantiality
ODER
*NL*
consubstantiality
but
in
no
case
subsubstantiality
.
And
all
cried
out
*NL*
upon
it
for
a
very
scurvy
word
.
A
pregnancy
without
joy
,
he
said
,
a
*NL*
birth
without
pangs
,
a
body
without
blemish
,
a
belly
without
bigness
.
*NL*
Let

lewd

fervour

*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
Punch
Costello
dinged
with
his
fist
upon
the
board
and
would
*NL*
sing
a
bawdy
catch
_
Staboo
Stabella
_
about
a
wench
that
was
put
in
pod
*NL*
of
a
jolly
swashbuckler
in
Almany
which
he
did
straightways
now
attack
:
*NL*
_
The
first
three
months
she
was
not
well
,
Staboo
,
_
when
here
nurse
*NL*
Quigley
from
the
door
angerly
bid
them
hist
ye
should
shame
you
nor
*NL*
was
it
not
meet
as
she
remembered
them
being
her
mind
was
to
have
all
*NL*
orderly
against
lord
Andrew
came
for
because
she
was
jealous
that
*NL*
no
gasteful
turmoil
might
shorten
the
honour
of
her
guard
.
It
was
an
*NL*
ancient
and
a
sad
matron
of
a
sedate
look
and
christian
walking
,
*NL*
in
habit
dun
beseeming
her
megrims
and
wrinkled
visage
,
nor
did
her
*NL*
hortative
want
of
it
effect
for
incontinently
Punch
Costello
was
of
them
*NL*
all
embraided
and
they
reclaimed
the
churl
with
civil
rudeness
some
and
*NL*
shaked
him
with
menace
of
blandishments
others
whiles
they
all
chode
*NL*
with
him
,
a
murrain
seize
the
dolt
,
what
a
devil
he
would
be
at
,
thou
*NL*

thou
chitterling

*NL*
thou
spawn
of

,
thou
dykedropt
,
thou
abortion
thou
,
to
shut
up
*NL*
his
drunken
drool
out
of
that
like
a
curse
of
God
ape
,
the
good
sir
*NL*
Leopold
that
had
for
his
cognisance
the
flower
of
quiet
,
margerain
*NL*
gentle
,
advising
also
the
time
's
occasion
as
most
sacred
and
most
worthy
*NL*
to
be
most
sacred
.
In
Horne
's
house
rest
should
reign
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
short
this
passage
was
scarce
by
when
Master
Dixon
of
Mary
in
*NL*
Eccles
,
goodly
grinning
,
asked
young
Stephen
what
was
the
reason
why
he
*NL*
had
not
cided
to
take
friar
's
vows
and
he
answered
him
obedience
in
the
*NL*
womb
,
chastity
in
the
tomb
but
involuntary
poverty
all
his
days
.
Master
*NL*
Lenehan
at
this
made
return
that
he
had
heard
of
those
nefarious
deeds
*NL*
and
how
,
as
he
heard
hereof
counted
,
he
had
besmirched
the
lily
virtue
*NL*
of
a
confiding
female
which
was
corruption
of
minors
and
they
all
*NL*
intershowed
it
too
,
waxing
merry
and
toasting
to
his
fathership
.
But
he
*NL*
said
very
entirely
it
was
clean
contrary
to
their
suppose
for
he
was
*NL*
the
eternal
son
and
ever
virgin
.
Thereat
mirth
grew
in
them
the
more
and
*NL*
they
rehearsed
to
him
his
curious
rite
of
wedlock
for
the
disrobing
and
*NL*
deflowering
of
spouses
,
as
the
priests
use
in
Madagascar
island
,
she
*NL*
to
be
in
guise
of
white
and
saffron
,
her
groom
in
white
and
grain
,
with
*NL*
burning
of
nard
and
tapers
,
on
a
bridebed
while
clerks
sung
kyries
and
*NL*
the
anthem
_
Ut
novetur
sexus
omnis
corporis
mysterium
_
till
she
was
*NL*
there
unmaided
.
He
gave
them
then
a
much
admirable
hymen
minim
by
those
*NL*
delicate
poets
Master
John
Fletcher
and
Master
Francis
Beaumont
that
is
*NL*
in
their
_
Maid
's
Tragedy
_
that
was
writ
for
a
like
twining
of
lovers
:
*NL*
_
To
bed
,
to
bed
_
was
the
burden
of
it
to
be
played
with
accompanable
*NL*
concent
upon
the
virginals
.
An
exquisite
dulcet
epithalame
of
most
*NL*
mollificative
suadency
for
juveniles
amatory
whom
the
odoriferous
*NL*
flambeaus
of
the
paranymphs
have
escorted
to
the
quadrupedal
proscenium
*NL*
of
connubial
communion
.
Well
met
they
were
,
said
Master
Dixon
,
joyed
,
*NL*
but
,
harkee
,
young
sir
,
better
were
they
named
Beau
Mount
and
Lecher
*NL*
for
,
by
my
troth
,
of
such
a
mingling
much
might
come
.
Young
Stephen
said
*NL*
indeed
to
his
best
remembrance
they
had
but
the
one
doxy
between
them
*NL*
and
she
of
the
stews
to
make
shift
with
in
delights
amorous
for
life
ran
*NL*
very
high
in
those
days
and
the
custom
of
the
country
approved
with
it
.
*NL*
Greater
love
than
this
,
he
said
,
no
man
hath
that
a
man
lay
down
his
*NL*
wife
for
his
friend
.
Go
thou
and
do
likewise
.
Thus
,
or
words
to
that
*NL*
effect
,
saith

Remember
,
Erin
,
thy
*NL*
generations
and
thy
days
of
old
,
how
thou
settedst
little
by
me
and
by
*NL*
my
word
and
broughtedst
in
a
stranger
to
my
gates
to
commit
fornication
*NL*
in
my
sight
and
to
wax
fat
and
kick
like
Jeshurum
.
Therefore
hast
thou
*NL*
sinned
against
my
light
and
hast
made
me
,
thy
lord
,
to
be
the
slave
of
*NL*
servants
.
Return
,

Clan
Milly
:
forget
me
not
,
O
Milesian
.
Why
*NL*
hast
thou
done
this
abomination
before
me
that
thou
didst
spurn
me
for
*NL*
a
merchant
of
jalaps
and
didst
deny
me
to
the
Roman
and
to
the
Indian
of
*NL*
dark
speech
with
whom
thy
daughters
did
lie
luxuriously
?
Look
forth
now
,
*NL*
my
people
,
upon
the
land
of
behest
,
even
from
Horeb
and
from
Nebo
and
*NL*
from
Pisgah
and
from
the
Horns
of
Hatten
unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
*NL*
and
money
.
But
thou
hast
suckled
me
with
a
bitter
milk
:
my
moon
and
my
*NL*
sun
thou
hast
quenched
for
ever
.
And
thou
hast
left
me
alone
for
ever
*NL*
in
the
dark
ways
of
my
bitterness
:
and
with
a
kiss
of
ashes
hast
thou
*NL*
kissed
my
mouth
.
This
tenebrosity
of
the

proceeded
to
say

*NL*
hath
not
been
illumined
by
the
wit

And
as

accord
in

with
their

that

concordance
which
leads
forth
growth

accomplishing
by
a
retrogressive
metamorphosis
that
minishing
*NL*

it

_
*NL*
*NL*
A
black
crack
of
noise
in
the
street
here
,
alack
,
bawled
back
.
Loud
on
*NL*
left
Thor
thundered
:
in
anger
awful
the
hammerhurler
.
Came
now
the
storm
*NL*
that
hist
his
heart
.
And
Master
Lynch
bade
him
have
a
care
to
flout
and
*NL*
witwanton
as
the
god
self
was
angered
for
his
hellprate
and
paganry
.
And
*NL*
he
that
had
erst
challenged
to
be
so
doughty
waxed
wan
as
they
might
all
*NL*
mark
and
shrank
together
and
his
pitch
that
was
before
so
haught
uplift
*NL*
was
now
of
a
sudden
quite
plucked
down
and
his
heart
shook
within
the
*NL*
cage
of
his
breast
as
he
tasted
the
rumour
of
that
storm
.
Then
did
some
*NL*
mock
and
some
jeer
and
Punch
Costello
fell
hard
again
to
his
yale
which
*NL*
Master
Lenehan
vowed
he
would
do
after
and
he
was
indeed
but
a
word
and
*NL*
a
blow
on
any
the
least
colour
.
But
the
braggart
boaster
cried
that
an
*NL*
old
Nobodaddy
was
in
his
cups
it
was
muchwhat
indifferent
and
he
would
*NL*
not
lag
behind
his
lead
.
But
this
was
only
to
dye
his
desperation
as
*NL*
cowed
he
crouched
in
Horne
's
hall
.
He
drank
indeed
at
one
draught
to
*NL*
pluck
up
a
heart
of
any
grace
for
it
thundered
long
rumblingly
over
all
*NL*
the
heavens
so
that
Master
Madden
,
being
godly
certain
whiles
,
knocked
*NL*
him
on
his
ribs
upon
that
crack
of
doom
and
Master
Bloom
,
at
the
*NL*
braggart
's
side
,
spoke
to
him
calming
words
to
slumber
his
great
fear
,
*NL*
advertising
how
it
was
no
other
thing
but
a
hubbub
noise
that
he
heard
,
*NL*
the
discharge
of
fluid
from
the
thunderhead
,
look
you
,
having
taken
*NL*
place
,
and
all
of
the
order
of
a
natural
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
was
young
Boasthard
's
fear
vanquished
by
Calmer
's
words
?
No
,
for
he
*NL*
had
in
his
bosom
a
spike
named
Bitterness
which
could
not
by
words
be
*NL*
done
away
.
And
was
he
then
neither
calm
like
the
one
nor
godly
like
the
*NL*
other
?
He
was
neither
as
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
be
either
.
But
*NL*
could
he
not
have
endeavoured
to
have
found
again
as
in
his
youth
the
*NL*
bottle
Holiness
that
then
he
lived
withal
?
Indeed
no
for
Grace
was
not
*NL*
there
to
find
that
bottle
.
Heard
he
then
in
that
clap
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
god
Bringforth
or
,
what
Calmer
said
,
a
hubbub
of
Phenomenon
?
Heard
?
*NL*
Why
,
he
could
not
but
hear
unless
he
had
plugged
him
up
the
tube
*NL*
Understanding
-LRB-
which
he
had
not
done
-RRB-
.
For
through
that
tube
he
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
in
the
land
of
Phenomenon
where
he
must
for
a
certain
one
day
die
*NL*
as
he
was
like
the
rest
too
a
passing
show
.
And
would
he
not
accept
to
*NL*
die
like
the
rest
and
pass
away
?
By
no
means
would
he
though
he
must
nor
*NL*
would
he
make
more
shows
according
as
men
do
with
wives
which
Phenomenon
*NL*
has
commanded
them
to
do
by
the
book
Law
.
Then
wotted
he
nought
of
that
*NL*
other
land
which
is
called
Believe-on-Me
,
that
is
the
land
of
promise
*NL*
which
behoves
to
the
king
Delightful
and
shall
be
for
ever
where
there
*NL*
is
no
death
and
no
birth
neither
wiving
nor
mothering
at
which
all
shall
*NL*
come
as
many
as
believe
on
it
?
Yes
,
Pious
had
told
him
of
that
land
and
*NL*
Chaste
had
pointed
him
to
the
way
but
the
reason
was
that
in
the
way
he
*NL*
fell
in
with
a
certain
whore
of
an
eyepleasing
exterior
whose
name
,
she
*NL*
said
,
is
Bird-in-the-Hand
and
she
beguiled
him
wrongways
from
the
true
*NL*
path
by
her
flatteries
that
she
said
to
him
as
,
Ho
,
you
pretty
man
,
turn
*NL*
aside
hither
and
I
will
show
you
a
brave
place
,
and
she
lay
at
him
so
*NL*
flatteringly
that
she
had
him
in
her
grot
which
is
named
Two-in-the-Bush
*NL*
or
,
by
some
learned
,
Carnal
Concupiscence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
it
what
all
that
company
that
sat
there
at
commons
in
Manse
*NL*
of
Mothers
the
most
lusted
after
and
if
they
met
with
this
whore
*NL*
Bird-in-the-Hand
-LRB-
which
was
within
all
foul
plagues
,
monsters
and
a
*NL*
wicked
devil
-RRB-
they
would
strain
the
last
but
they
would
make
at
her
and
*NL*
know
her
.
For
regarding
Believe-on-Me
they
said
it
was
nought
else
*NL*
but
notion
and
they
could
conceive
no
thought
of
it
for
,
first
,
*NL*
Two-in-the-Bush
whither
she
ticed
them
was
the
very
goodliest
grot
and
*NL*
in
it
were
four
pillows
on
which
were
four
tickets
with
these
words
*NL*
printed
on
them
,
Pickaback
and
Topsyturvy
and
Shameface
and
Cheek
by
*NL*
Jowl
and
,
second
,
for
that
foul
plague
Allpox
and
the
monsters
they
*NL*
cared
not
for
them
for
Preservative
had
given
them
a
stout
shield
of
*NL*
oxengut
and
,
third
,
that
they
might
take
no
hurt
neither
from
Offspring
*NL*
that
was
that
wicked
devil
by
virtue
of
this
same
shield
which
was
*NL*
named
Killchild
.
So
were
they
all
in
their
blind
fancy
,
Mr
Cavil
and
Mr
*NL*
Sometimes
Godly
,
Mr
Ape
Swillale
,
Mr
False
Franklin
,
Mr
Dainty
Dixon
,
*NL*
Young
Boasthard
and
Mr
Cautious
Calmer
.
Wherein
,
O
wretched
company
,
*NL*
were
ye
all
deceived
for
that
was
the
voice
of
the
god
that
was
in
a
*NL*
very
grievous
rage
that
he
would
presently
lift
his
arm
up
and
*NL*
spill
their
souls
for
their
abuses
and
their
spillings
done
by
them
*NL*
contrariwise
to
his
word
which
forth
to
bring
brenningly
biddeth

In
sum
*NL*
an
infinite
great
fall
of
rain
and
all
refreshed
and
will
much
increase
*NL*
the
harvest
yet
those
in
ken
say
after
wind
and
water
fire
shall
come
*NL*
for
a
prognostication
of
Malachi
's
almanac
-LRB-
and
I
hear
that
Mr
Russell
*NL*
has
done
a
prophetical
charm
of
the
same
gist
out
of
the
Hindustanish
*NL*
for
his
farmer
's
gazette
-RRB-
to
have
three
things
in
all
but
this
a
mere
*NL*
fetch
without
bottom
of
reason
for
old
crones
and
bairns
yet
sometimes
*NL*
they
are
found
in
the
right
guess
with
their
queerities
no
telling
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
came
up
Lenehan
to
the
feet
of
the
table
to
say
how
the
letter
*NL*
was
in
that
night
's
gazette
and
he
made
a
show
to
find
it
about
him
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
swore
with
an
oath
that
he
had
been
at
pains
about
it
-RRB-
but
on
*NL*
Stephen
's
persuasion
he
gave
over
the
search
and
was
bidden
to
sit
near
*NL*
by
which
he
did
mighty
brisk
.
He
was
a
kind
of
sport
gentleman
that
*NL*
went
for
a
merryandrew
or
honest
pickle
and
what
belonged
of
women
,
*NL*
horseflesh
or
hot
scandal
he
had
it
pat
.
To
tell
the
truth
he
was
mean
*NL*
in
fortunes
and
for
the
most
part
hankered
about
the
coffeehouses
*NL*
and
low
taverns
with
crimps
,
ostlers
,
bookies
,
Paul
's
men
,
runners
,
*NL*
flatcaps
,
waistcoateers
,
ladies
of
the
bagnio
and
other
rogues
of
the
*NL*
game
or
with
a
chanceable
catchpole
or
a
tipstaff
often
at
nights
*NL*
till
broad
day
of
whom
he
picked
up
between
his
sackpossets
much
loose
*NL*
gossip
.
He
took
his
ordinary
at
a
boilingcook
's
and
if
he
had
but
gotten
*NL*
into
him
a
mess
of
broken
victuals
or
a
platter
of
tripes
with
a
bare
*NL*
tester
in
his
purse
he
could
always
bring
himself
off
with
his
tongue
,
*NL*
some
randy
quip
he
had
from
a
punk
or
whatnot
that
every
mother
's
son
of
*NL*
them
would
burst
their
sides
.
The
other
,
Costello
that
is
,
hearing
this
*NL*
talk
asked
was
it
poetry
or
a
tale
.
Faith
,
no
,
he
says
,
Frank
-LRB-
that
was
*NL*
his
name
-RRB-
,
't
is
all
about
Kerry
cows
that
are
to
be
butchered
along
of
*NL*
the
plague
.
But
they
can
go
hang
,
says
he
with
a
wink
,
for
me
with
their
*NL*
bully
beef
,
a
pox
on
it
.
There
's
as
good
fish
in
this
tin
as
ever
came
*NL*
out
of
it
and
very
friendly
he
offered
to
take
of
some
salty
sprats
that
*NL*
stood
by
which
he
had
eyed
wishly
in
the
meantime
and
found
the
place
*NL*
which
was
indeed
the
chief
design
of
his
embassy
as
he
was
sharpset
.
*NL*
_
Mort
aux
vaches
_
,
says
Frank
then
in
the
French
language
that
had
been
*NL*
indentured
to
a
brandyshipper
that
has
a
winelodge
in
Bordeaux
and
he
*NL*
spoke
French
like
a
gentleman
too
.
From
a
child
this
Frank
had
been
*NL*
a
donought
that
his
father
,
a
headborough
,
who
could
ill
keep
him
to
*NL*
school
to
learn
his
letters
and
the
use
of
the
globes
,
matriculated
at
*NL*
the
university
to
study
the
mechanics
but
he
took
the
bit
between
his
*NL*
teeth
like
a
raw
colt
and
was
more
familiar
with
the
justiciary
and
the
*NL*
parish
beadle
than
with
his
volumes
.
One
time
he
would
be
a
playactor
,
*NL*
then
a
sutler
or
a
welsher
,
then
nought
would
keep
him
from
the
bearpit
*NL*
and
the
cocking
main
,
then
he
was
for
the
ocean
sea
or
to
hoof
it
on
*NL*
the
roads
with
the
romany
folk
,
kidnapping
a
squire
's
heir
by
favour
of
*NL*
moonlight
or
fecking
maids
'
linen
or
choking
chicken
behind
a
hedge
.
He
*NL*
had
been
off
as
many
times
as
a
cat
has
lives
and
back
again
with
naked
*NL*
pockets
as
many
more
to
his
father
the
headborough
who
shed
a
pint
*NL*
of
tears
as
often
as
he
saw
him
.
What
,
says
Mr
Leopold
with
his
hands
*NL*
across
,
that
was
earnest
to
know
the
drift
of
it
,
will
they
slaughter
*NL*
all
?
I
protest
I
saw
them
but
this
day
morning
going
to
the
Liverpool
*NL*
boats
,
says
he
.
I
can
scarce
believe
't
is
so
bad
,
says
he
.
And
he
had
*NL*
experience
of
the
like
brood
beasts
and
of
springers
,
greasy
hoggets
and
*NL*
wether
wool
,
having
been
some
years
before
actuary
for
Mr
Joseph
Cuffe
,
*NL*
a
worthy
salesmaster
that
drove
his
trade
for
live
stock
and
meadow
*NL*
auctions
hard
by
Mr
Gavin
Low
's
yard
in
Prussia
street
.
I
question
with
*NL*
you
there
,
says
he
.
More
like
't
is
the
hoose
or
the
timber
tongue
.
Mr
*NL*
Stephen
,
a
little
moved
but
very
handsomely
told
him
no
such
matter
and
*NL*
that
he
had
dispatches
from
the
emperor
's
chief
tailtickler
thanking
*NL*
him
for
the
hospitality
,
that
was
sending
over
Doctor
Rinderpest
,
the
*NL*
bestquoted
cowcatcher
in
all
Muscovy
,
with
a
bolus
or
two
of
physic
to
*NL*
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
.
Come
,
come
,
says
Mr
Vincent
,
plain
dealing
.
*NL*
He
'll
find
himself
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
if
he
meddles
with
a
*NL*
bull
that
's
Irish
,
says
he
.
Irish
by
name
and
irish
by
nature
,
says
Mr
*NL*
Stephen
,
and
he
sent
the
ale
purling
about
,
an
Irish
bull
in
an
English
*NL*
chinashop
.
I
conceive
you
,
says
Mr
Dixon
.
It
is
that
same
bull
that
was
*NL*
sent
to
our
island
by
farmer
Nicholas
,
the
bravest
cattlebreeder
of
them
*NL*
all
,
with
an
emerald
ring
in
his
nose
.
True
for
you
,
says
Mr
Vincent
*NL*
cross
the
table
,
and
a
bullseye
into
the
bargain
,
says
he
,
and
a
plumper
*NL*
and
a
portlier
bull
,
says
he
,
never
shit
on
shamrock
.
He
had
horns
*NL*
galore
,
a
coat
of
cloth
of
gold
and
a
sweet
smoky
breath
coming
out
of
*NL*
his
nostrils
so
that
the
women
of
our
island
,
leaving
doughballs
and
*NL*
rollingpins
,
followed
after
him
hanging
his
bulliness
in
daisychains
.
*NL*
What
for
that
,
says
Mr
Dixon
,
but
before
he
came
over
farmer
Nicholas
*NL*
that
was
a
eunuch
had
him
properly
gelded
by
a
college
of
doctors
who
*NL*
were
no
better
off
than
himself
.
So
be
off
now
,
says
he
,
and
do
all
my
*NL*
cousin
german
the
lord
Harry
tells
you
and
take
a
farmer
's
blessing
,
and
*NL*
with
that
he
slapped
his
posteriors
very
soundly
.
But
the
slap
and
the
*NL*
blessing
stood
him
friend
,
says
Mr
Vincent
,
for
to
make
up
he
taught
him
*NL*
a
trick
worth
two
of
the
other
so
that
maid
,
wife
,
abbess
and
widow
to
*NL*
this
day
affirm
that
they
would
rather
any
time
of
the
month
whisper
*NL*
in
his
ear
in
the
dark
of
a
cowhouse
or
get
a
lick
on
the
nape
from
his
*NL*
long
holy
tongue
than
lie
with
the
finest
strapping
young
ravisher
in
*NL*
the
four
fields
of
all
Ireland
.
Another
then
put
in
his
word
:
And
they
*NL*
dressed
him
,
says
he
,
in
a
point
shift
and
petticoat
with
a
tippet
and
*NL*
girdle
and
ruffles
on
his
wrists
and
clipped
his
forelock
and
rubbed
him
*NL*
all
over
with
spermacetic
oil
and
built
stables
for
him
at
every
turn
of
*NL*
the
road
with
a
gold
manger
in
each
full
of
the
best
hay
in
the
market
*NL*
so
that
he
could
doss
and
dung
to
his
heart
's
content
.
By
this
time
the
*NL*
father
of
the
faithful
-LRB-
for
so
they
called
him
-RRB-
was
grown
so
heavy
that
*NL*
he
could
scarce
walk
to
pasture
.
To
remedy
which
our
cozening
dames
and
*NL*
damsels
brought
him
his
fodder
in
their
apronlaps
and
as
soon
as
his
*NL*
belly
was
full
he
would
rear
up
on
his
hind
uarters
to
show
their
*NL*
ladyships
a
mystery
and
roar
and
bellow
out
of
him
in
bulls
'
language
*NL*
and
they
all
after
him
.
Ay
,
says
another
,
and
so
pampered
was
he
that
he
*NL*
would
suffer
nought
to
grow
in
all
the
land
but
green
grass
for
himself
*NL*
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
only
colour
to
his
mind
-RRB-
and
there
was
a
board
put
up
*NL*
on
a
hillock
in
the
middle
of
the
island
with
a
printed
notice
,
saying
:
*NL*
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
Green
is
the
grass
that
grows
on
the
ground
.
And
,
*NL*
says
Mr
Dixon
,
if
ever
he
got
scent
of
a
cattleraider
in
Roscommon
or
*NL*
the
wilds
of
Connemara
or
a
husbandman
in
Sligo
that
was
sowing
as
much
*NL*
as
a
handful
of
mustard
or
a
bag
of
rapeseed
out
he
'd
run
amok
over
half
*NL*
the
countryside
rooting
up
with
his
horns
whatever
was
planted
and
all
*NL*
by
lord
Harry
's
orders
.
There
was
bad
blood
between
them
at
first
,
says
*NL*
Mr
Vincent
,
and
the
lord
Harry
called
farmer
Nicholas
all
the
old
Nicks
*NL*
in
the
world
and
an
old
whoremaster
that
kept
seven
trulls
in
his
house
*NL*
and
I
'll
meddle
in
his
matters
,
says
he
.
I
'll
make
that
animal
smell
*NL*
hell
,
says
he
,
with
the
help
of
that
good
pizzle
my
father
left
me
.
But
*NL*
one
evening
,
says
Mr
Dixon
,
when
the
lord
Harry
was
cleaning
his
royal
*NL*
pelt
to
go
to
dinner
after
winning
a
boatrace
-LRB-
he
had
spade
oars
for
*NL*
himself
but
the
first
rule
of
the
course
was
that
the
others
were
to
row
*NL*
with
pitchforks
-RRB-
he
discovered
in
himself
a
wonderful
likeness
to
a
bull
*NL*
and
on
picking
up
a
blackthumbed
chapbook
that
he
kept
in
the
pantry
*NL*
he
found
sure
enough
that
he
was
a
lefthanded
descendant
of
the
famous
*NL*
champion
bull
of
the
Romans
,
_
Bos
Bovum
_
,
which
is
good
bog
Latin
for
*NL*
boss
of
the
show
.
After
that
,
says
Mr
Vincent
,
the
lord
Harry
put
his
*NL*
head
into
a
cow
's
drinkingtrough
in
the
presence
of
all
his
courtiers
*NL*
and
pulling
it
out
again
told
them
all
his
new
name
.
Then
,
with
the
*NL*
water
running
off
him
,
he
got
into
an
old
smock
and
skirt
that
had
*NL*
belonged
to
his
grandmother
and
bought
a
grammar
of
the
bulls
'
language
*NL*
to
study
but
he
could
never
learn
a
word
of
it
except
the
first
personal
*NL*
pronoun
which
he
copied
out
big
and
got
off
by
heart
and
if
ever
he
went
*NL*
out
for
a
walk
he
filled
his
pockets
with
chalk
to
write
it
upon
what
*NL*
took
his
fancy
,
the
side
of
a
rock
or
a
teahouse
table
or
a
bale
of
*NL*
cotton
or
a
corkfloat
.
In
short
,
he
and
the
bull
of
Ireland
were
soon
as
*NL*
fast
friends
as
an
arse
and
a
shirt
.
They
were
,
says
Mr
Stephen
,
and
*NL*
the
end
was
that
the
men
of
the
island
seeing
no
help
was
toward
,
as
*NL*
the
ungrate
women
were
all
of
one
mind
,
made
a
wherry
raft
,
loaded
*NL*
themselves
and
their
bundles
of
chattels
on
shipboard
,
set
all
masts
*NL*
erect
,
manned
the
yards
,
sprang
their
luff
,
heaved
to
,
spread
three
*NL*
sheets
in
the
wind
,
put
her
head
between
wind
and
water
,
weighed
anchor
,
*NL*
ported
her
helm
,
ran
up
the
jolly
Roger
,
gave
three
times
three
,
let
the
*NL*
bullgine
run
,
pushed
off
in
their
bumboat
and
put
to
sea
to
recover
*NL*
the
main
of
America
.
Which
was
the
occasion
,
says
Mr
Vincent
,
of
the
*NL*
composing
by
a
boatswain
of
that
rollicking
chanty
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Pope
Peter
's
but
a
pissabed
.
*NL*
A
man
's
a
man
for
a
'
that
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Our
worthy
acquaintance
Mr
Malachi
Mulligan
now
appeared
in
the
doorway
*NL*
as
the
students
were
finishing
their
apologue
accompanied
with
a
friend
*NL*
whom
he
had
just
rencountered
,
a
young
gentleman
,
his
name
Alec
Bannon
,
*NL*
who
had
late
come
to
town
,
it
being
his
intention
to
buy
a
colour
or
a
*NL*
cornetcy
in
the
fencibles
and
list
for
the
wars
.
Mr
Mulligan
was
civil
*NL*
enough
to
express
some
relish
of
it
all
the
more
as
it
jumped
with
a
*NL*
project
of
his
own
for
the
cure
of
the
very
evil
that
had
been
touched
*NL*
on
.
Whereat
he
handed
round
to
the
company
a
set
of
pasteboard
cards
*NL*
which
he
had
had
printed
that
day
at
Mr
Quinnell
's
bearing
a
legend
*NL*
printed
in
fair
italics
:
_
Mr
Malachi
Mulligan
.
Fertiliser
and
Incubator
.
*NL*
Lambay
Island
_
.
His
project
,
as
he
went
on
to
expound
,
was
to
withdraw
*NL*
from
the
round
of
idle
pleasures
such
as
form
the
chief
business
of
sir
*NL*
Fopling
Popinjay
and
sir
Milksop
Quidnunc
in
town
and
to
devote
himself
*NL*
to
the
noblest
task
for
which
our
bodily
organism
has
been
framed
.
Well
,
*NL*
let
us
hear
of
it
,
good
my
friend
,
said
Mr
Dixon
.
I
make
no
doubt
it
*NL*
smacks
of
wenching
.
Come
,
be
seated
,
both
.
'T
is
as
cheap
sitting
as
*NL*
standing
.
Mr
Mulligan
accepted
of
the
invitation
and
,
expatiating
upon
*NL*
his
design
,
told
his
hearers
that
he
had
been
led
into
this
thought
by
*NL*
a
consideration
of
the
causes
of
sterility
,
both
the
inhibitory
and
the
*NL*
prohibitory
,
whether
the
inhibition
in
its
turn
were
due
to
conjugal
*NL*
vexations
or
to
a
parsimony
of
the
balance
as
well
as
whether
the
*NL*
prohibition
proceeded
from
defects
congenital
or
from
proclivities
*NL*
acquired
.
It
grieved
him
plaguily
,
he
said
,
to
see
the
nuptial
couch
*NL*
defrauded
of
its
dearest
pledges
:
and
to
reflect
upon
so
many
agreeable
*NL*
females
with
rich
jointures
,
a
prey
to
the
vilest
bonzes
,
who
hide
their
*NL*
flambeau
under
a
bushel
in
an
uncongenial
cloister
or
lose
their
womanly
*NL*
bloom
in
the
embraces
of
some
unaccountable
muskin
when
they
might
*NL*
multiply
the
inlets
of
happiness
,
sacrificing
the
inestimable
jewel
of
*NL*
their
sex
when
a
hundred
pretty
fellows
were
at
hand
to
caress
,
this
,
he
*NL*
assured
them
,
made
his
heart
weep
.
To
curb
this
inconvenient
-LRB-
which
*NL*
he
concluded
due
to
a
suppression
of
latent
heat
-RRB-
,
having
advised
with
*NL*
certain
counsellors
of
worth
and
inspected
into
this
matter
,
he
had
*NL*
resolved
to
purchase
in
fee
simple
for
ever
the
freehold
of
Lambay
*NL*
island
from
its
holder
,
lord
Talbot
de
Malahide
,
a
Tory
gentleman
of
*NL*
note
much
in
favour
with
our
ascendancy
party
.
He
proposed
to
set
up
*NL*
there
a
national
fertilising
farm
to
be
named
_
Omphalos
_
with
an
obelisk
*NL*
hewn
and
erected
after
the
fashion
of
Egypt
and
to
offer
his
dutiful
*NL*
yeoman
services
for
the
fecundation
of
any
female
of
what
grade
of
life
*NL*
soever
who
should
there
direct
to
him
with
the
desire
of
fulfilling
the
*NL*
functions
of
her
natural
.
Money
was
no
object
,
he
said
,
nor
would
he
*NL*
take
a
penny
for
his
pains
.
The
poorest
kitchenwench
no
less
than
the
*NL*
opulent
lady
of
fashion
,
if
so
be
their
constructions
and
their
tempers
*NL*
were
warm
persuaders
for
their
petitions
,
would
find
in
him
their
man
.
*NL*
For
his
nutriment
he
shewed
how
he
would
feed
himself
exclusively
upon
a
*NL*
diet
of
savoury
tubercles
and
fish
and
coneys
there
,
the
flesh
of
these
*NL*
latter
prolific
rodents
being
highly
recommended
for
his
purpose
,
both
*NL*
broiled
and
stewed
with
a
blade
of
mace
and
a
pod
or
two
of
capsicum
*NL*
chillies
.
After
this
homily
which
he
delivered
with
much
warmth
of
*NL*
asseveration
Mr
Mulligan
in
a
trice
put
off
from
his
hat
a
kerchief
with
*NL*
which
he
had
shielded
it
.
They
both
,
it
seems
,
had
been
overtaken
by
the
*NL*
rain
and
for
all
their
mending
their
pace
had
taken
water
,
as
might
be
*NL*
observed
by
Mr
Mulligan
's
smallclothes
of
a
hodden
grey
which
was
now
*NL*
somewhat
piebald
.
His
project
meanwhile
was
very
favourably
entertained
*NL*
by
his
auditors
and
won
hearty
eulogies
from
all
though
Mr
Dixon
of
*NL*
Mary
's
excepted
to
it
,
asking
with
a
finicking
air
did
he
purpose
also
*NL*
to
carry
coals
to
Newcastle
.
Mr
Mulligan
however
made
court
to
the
*NL*
scholarly
by
an
apt
quotation
from
the
classics
which
,
as
it
dwelt
*NL*
upon
his
memory
,
seemed
to
him
a
sound
and
tasteful
support
of
his
*NL*
contention
:
_
Talis
ac
tanta
depravatio
hujus
seculi
,
O
quirites
,
*NL*
ut
matresfamiliarum
nostrae
lascivas
cujuslibet
semiviri
libici
*NL*
titillationes
testibus
ponderosis
atque
excelsis
erectionibus
*NL*
centurionum
Romanorum
magnopere
anteponunt
_
,
while
for
those
of
ruder
*NL*
wit
he
drove
home
his
point
by
analogies
of
the
animal
kingdom
more
*NL*
suitable
to
their
stomach
,
the
buck
and
doe
of
the
forest
glade
,
the
*NL*
farmyard
drake
and
duck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valuing
himself
not
a
little
upon
his
elegance
,
being
indeed
a
proper
*NL*
man
of
person
,
this
talkative
now
applied
himself
to
his
dress
with
*NL*
animadversions
of
some
heat
upon
the
sudden
whimsy
of
the
atmospherics
*NL*
while
the
company
lavished
their
encomiums
upon
the
project
he
had
*NL*
advanced
.
The
young
gentleman
,
his
friend
,
overjoyed
as
he
was
at
a
*NL*
passage
that
had
late
befallen
him
,
could
not
forbear
to
tell
it
his
*NL*
nearest
neighbour
.
Mr
Mulligan
,
now
perceiving
the
table
,
asked
for
whom
*NL*
were
those
loaves
and
fishes
and
,
seeing
the
stranger
,
he
made
him
*NL*
a
civil
bow
and
said
,
Pray
,
sir
,
was
you
in
need
of
any
professional
*NL*
assistance
we
could
give
?
Who
,
upon
his
offer
,
thanked
him
very
*NL*
heartily
,
though
preserving
his
proper
distance
,
and
replied
that
he
was
*NL*
come
there
about
a
lady
,
now
an
inmate
of
Horne
's
house
,
that
was
in
an
*NL*
interesting
condition
,
poor
body
,
from
woman
's
woe
-LRB-
and
here
he
fetched
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
-RRB-
to
know
if
her
happiness
had
yet
taken
place
.
Mr
Dixon
,
*NL*
to
turn
the
table
,
took
on
to
ask
of
Mr
Mulligan
himself
whether
*NL*
his
incipient
ventripotence
,
upon
which
he
rallied
him
,
betokened
an
*NL*
ovoblastic
gestation
in
the
prostatic
utricle
or
male
womb
or
was
due
,
*NL*
as
with
the
noted
physician
,
Mr
Austin
Meldon
,
to
a
wolf
in
the
stomach
.
*NL*
For
answer
Mr
Mulligan
,
in
a
gale
of
laughter
at
his
smalls
,
smote
*NL*
himself
bravely
below
the
diaphragm
,
exclaiming
with
an
admirable
droll
*NL*
mimic
of
Mother
Grogan
-LRB-
the
most
excellent
creature
of
her
sex
though
*NL*
't
is
pity
she
's
a
trollop
-RRB-
:
There
's
a
belly
that
never
bore
a
bastard
.
*NL*
This
was
so
happy
a
conceit
that
it
renewed
the
storm
of
mirth
and
threw
*NL*
the
whole
room
into
the
most
violent
agitations
of
delight
.
The
spry
*NL*
rattle
had
run
on
in
the
same
vein
of
mimicry
but
for
some
larum
in
the
*NL*
antechamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
listener
who
was
none
other
than
the
Scotch
student
,
a
little
*NL*
fume
of
a
fellow
,
blond
as
tow
,
congratulated
in
the
liveliest
fashion
*NL*
with
the
young
gentleman
and
,
interrupting
the
narrative
at
a
salient
*NL*
point
,
having
desired
his
visavis
with
a
polite
beck
to
have
the
*NL*
obligingness
to
pass
him
a
flagon
of
cordial
waters
at
the
same
time
by
*NL*
a
questioning
poise
of
the
head
-LRB-
a
whole
century
of
polite
breeding
had
*NL*
not
achieved
so
nice
a
gesture
-RRB-
to
which
was
united
an
equivalent
but
*NL*
contrary
balance
of
the
bottle
asked
the
narrator
as
plainly
as
was
ever
*NL*
done
in
words
if
he
might
treat
him
with
a
cup
of
it
.
_
Mais
bien
sur
_
,
*NL*
noble
stranger
,
said
he
cheerily
,
_
et
mille
compliments
_
.
That
you
may
*NL*
and
very
opportunely
.
There
wanted
nothing
but
this
cup
to
crown
my
*NL*
felicity
.
But
,
gracious
heaven
,
was
I
left
with
but
a
crust
in
my
wallet
*NL*
and
a
cupful
of
water
from
the
well
,
my
God
,
I
would
accept
of
them
and
*NL*
find
it
in
my
heart
to
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
and
give
thanks
to
*NL*
the
powers
above
for
the
happiness
vouchsafed
me
by
the
Giver
of
good
*NL*
things
.
With
these
words
he
approached
the
goblet
to
his
lips
,
took
a
*NL*
complacent
draught
of
the
cordial
,
slicked
his
hair
and
,
opening
his
*NL*
bosom
,
out
popped
a
locket
that
hung
from
a
silk
riband
,
that
very
*NL*
picture
which
he
had
cherished
ever
since
her
hand
had
wrote
therein
.
*NL*
Gazing
upon
those
features
with
a
world
of
tenderness
,
Ah
,
Monsieur
,
he
*NL*
said
,
had
you
but
beheld
her
as
I
did
with
these
eyes
at
that
affecting
*NL*
instant
with
her
dainty
tucker
and
her
new
coquette
cap
-LRB-
a
gift
for
her
*NL*
feastday
as
she
told
me
prettily
-RRB-
in
such
an
artless
disorder
,
of
so
*NL*
melting
a
tenderness
,
`
pon
my
conscience
,
even
you
,
Monsieur
,
had
been
*NL*
impelled
by
generous
nature
to
deliver
yourself
wholly
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
such
an
enemy
or
to
quit
the
field
for
ever
.
I
declare
,
I
was
never
so
*NL*
touched
in
all
my
life
.
God
,
I
thank
thee
,
as
the
Author
of
my
days
!
*NL*
Thrice
happy
will
he
be
whom
so
amiable
a
creature
will
bless
with
her
*NL*
favours
.
A
sigh
of
affection
gave
eloquence
to
these
words
and
,
having
*NL*
replaced
the
locket
in
his
bosom
,
he
wiped
his
eye
and
sighed
again
.
*NL*
Beneficent
Disseminator
of
blessings
to
all
Thy
creatures
,
how
great
*NL*
and
universal
must
be
that
sweetest
of
Thy
tyrannies
which
can
hold
in
*NL*
thrall
the
free
and
the
bond
,
the
simple
swain
and
the
polished
coxcomb
,
*NL*
the
lover
in
the
heyday
of
reckless
passion
and
the
husband
of
maturer
*NL*
years
.
But
indeed
,
sir
,
I
wander
from
the
point
.
How
mingled
and
*NL*
imperfect
are
all
our
sublunary
joys
.
Maledicity
!
he
exclaimed
in
*NL*
anguish
.
Would
to
God
that
foresight
had
but
remembered
me
to
take
my
*NL*
cloak
along
!
I
could
weep
to
think
of
it
.
Then
,
though
it
had
poured
*NL*
seven
showers
,
we
were
neither
of
us
a
penny
the
worse
.
But
beshrew
me
,
*NL*
he
cried
,
clapping
hand
to
his
forehead
,
tomorrow
will
be
a
new
day
and
,
*NL*
thousand
thunders
,
I
know
of
a
_
marchand
de
capotes
_
,
Monsieur
Poyntz
,
*NL*
from
whom
I
can
have
for
a
livre
as
snug
a
cloak
of
the
French
fashion
*NL*
as
ever
kept
a
lady
from
wetting
.
Tut
,
tut
!
cries
Le
Fecondateur
,
*NL*
tripping
in
,
my
friend
Monsieur
Moore
,
that
most
accomplished
traveller
*NL*
-LRB-
I
have
just
cracked
a
half
bottle
AVEC
LUI
in
a
circle
of
the
best
wits
*NL*
of
the
town
-RRB-
,
is
my
authority
that
in
Cape
Horn
,
_
ventre
biche
_
,
they
*NL*
have
a
rain
that
will
wet
through
any
,
even
the
stoutest
cloak
.
A
*NL*
drenching
of
that
violence
,
he
tells
me
,
_
sans
blague
_
,
has
sent
more
*NL*
than
one
luckless
fellow
in
good
earnest
posthaste
to
another
world
.
*NL*
Pooh
!
A
_
livre
!
_
cries
Monsieur
Lynch
.
The
clumsy
things
are
dear
at
a
*NL*
sou
.
One
umbrella
,
were
it
no
bigger
than
a
fairy
mushroom
,
is
worth
ten
*NL*
such
stopgaps
.
No
woman
of
any
wit
would
wear
one
.
My
dear
Kitty
told
me
*NL*
today
that
she
would
dance
in
a
deluge
before
ever
she
would
starve
in
*NL*
such
an
ark
of
salvation
for
,
as
she
reminded
me
-LRB-
blushing
piquantly
and
*NL*
whispering
in
my
ear
though
there
was
none
to
snap
her
words
but
giddy
*NL*
butterflies
-RRB-
,
dame
Nature
,
by
the
divine
blessing
,
has
implanted
it
in
*NL*
our
hearts
and
it
has
become
a
household
word
that
_
il
y
a
deux
choses
_
*NL*
for
which
the
innocence
of
our
original
garb
,
in
other
circumstances
a
*NL*
breach
of
the
proprieties
,
is
the
fittest
,
nay
,
the
only
garment
.
The
*NL*
first
,
said
she
-LRB-
and
here
my
pretty
philosopher
,
as
I
handed
her
to
her
*NL*
tilbury
,
to
fix
my
attention
,
gently
tipped
with
her
tongue
the
outer
*NL*
chamber
of
my
ear
-RRB-
,
the
first
is
a
bath
...
But
at
this
point
a
bell
*NL*
tinkling
in
the
hall
cut
short
a
discourse
which
promised
so
bravely
for
*NL*
the
enrichment
of
our
store
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
general
vacant
hilarity
of
the
assembly
a
bell
rang
and
,
while
*NL*
all
were
conjecturing
what
might
be
the
cause
,
Miss
Callan
entered
and
,
*NL*
having
spoken
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
to
young
Mr
Dixon
,
retired
with
*NL*
a
profound
bow
to
the
company
.
The
presence
even
for
a
moment
among
a
*NL*
party
of
debauchees
of
a
woman
endued
with
every
quality
of
modesty
and
*NL*
not
less
severe
than
beautiful
refrained
the
humourous
sallies
even
of
*NL*
the
most
licentious
but
her
departure
was
the
signal
for
an
outbreak
of
*NL*
ribaldry
.
Strike
me
silly
,
said
Costello
,
a
low
fellow
who
was
fuddled
.
*NL*
A
monstrous
fine
bit
of
cowflesh
!
I
'll
be
sworn
she
has
rendezvoused
*NL*
you
.
What
,
you
dog
?
Have
you
a
way
with
them
?
Gad
's
bud
,
immensely
*NL*
so
,
said
Mr
Lynch
.
The
bedside
manner
it
is
that
they
use
in
the
Mater
*NL*
hospice
.
Demme
,
does
not
Doctor
O'Gargle
chuck
the
nuns
there
under
the
*NL*
chin
.
As
I
look
to
be
saved
I
had
it
from
my
Kitty
who
has
been
wardmaid
*NL*
there
any
time
these
seven
months
.
Lawksamercy
,
doctor
,
cried
the
young
*NL*
blood
in
the
primrose
vest
,
feigning
a
womanish
simper
and
with
immodest
*NL*
squirmings
of
his
body
,
how
you
do
tease
a
body
!
Drat
the
man
!
Bless
*NL*
me
,
I
'm
all
of
a
wibbly
wobbly
.
Why
,
you
're
as
bad
as
dear
little
Father
*NL*
Cantekissem
,
that
you
are
!
May
this
pot
of
four
half
choke
me
,
cried
*NL*
Costello
,
if
she
aint
in
the
family
way
.
I
knows
a
lady
what
's
got
a
*NL*
white
swelling
quick
as
I
claps
eyes
on
her
.
The
young
surgeon
,
however
,
*NL*
rose
and
begged
the
company
to
excuse
his
retreat
as
the
nurse
had
just
*NL*
then
informed
him
that
he
was
needed
in
the
ward
.
Merciful
providence
*NL*
had
been
pleased
to
put
a
period
to
the
sufferings
of
the
lady
who
was
*NL*
_
enceinte
_
which
she
had
borne
with
a
laudable
fortitude
and
she
had
*NL*
given
birth
to
a
bouncing
boy
.
I
want
patience
,
said
he
,
with
those
*NL*
who
,
without
wit
to
enliven
or
learning
to
instruct
,
revile
an
ennobling
*NL*
profession
which
,
saving
the
reverence
due
to
the
Deity
,
is
the
greatest
*NL*
power
for
happiness
upon
the
earth
.
I
am
positive
when
I
say
that
if
*NL*
need
were
I
could
produce
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
the
excellence
of
*NL*
her
noble
exercitations
which
,
so
far
from
being
a
byword
,
should
be
a
*NL*
glorious
incentive
in
the
human
breast
.
I
can
not
away
with
them
.
What
?
*NL*
Malign
such
an
one
,
the
amiable
Miss
Callan
,
who
is
the
lustre
of
*NL*
her
own
sex
and
the
astonishment
of
ours
?
And
at
an
instant
the
most
*NL*
momentous
that
can
befall
a
puny
child
of
clay
?
Perish
the
thought
!
I
*NL*
shudder
to
think
of
the
future
of
a
race
where
the
seeds
of
such
malice
*NL*
have
been
sown
and
where
no
right
reverence
is
rendered
to
mother
and
*NL*
maid
in
house
of
Horne
.
Having
delivered
himself
of
this
rebuke
he
*NL*
saluted
those
present
on
the
by
and
repaired
to
the
door
.
A
murmur
*NL*
of
approval
arose
from
all
and
some
were
for
ejecting
the
low
soaker
*NL*
without
more
ado
,
a
design
which
would
have
been
effected
nor
would
*NL*
he
have
received
more
than
his
bare
deserts
had
he
not
abridged
his
*NL*
transgression
by
affirming
with
a
horrid
imprecation
-LRB-
for
he
swore
a
*NL*
round
hand
-RRB-
that
he
was
as
good
a
son
of
the
true
fold
as
ever
drew
*NL*
breath
.
Stap
my
vitals
,
said
he
,
them
was
always
the
sentiments
of
*NL*
honest
Frank
Costello
which
I
was
bred
up
most
particular
to
honour
thy
*NL*
father
and
thy
mother
that
had
the
best
hand
to
a
rolypoly
or
a
hasty
*NL*
pudding
as
you
ever
see
what
I
always
looks
back
on
with
a
loving
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
revert
to
Mr
Bloom
who
,
after
his
first
entry
,
had
been
conscious
of
*NL*
some
impudent
mocks
which
he
however
had
borne
with
as
being
the
fruits
*NL*
of
that
age
upon
which
it
is
commonly
charged
that
it
knows
not
*NL*
pity
.
The
young
sparks
,
it
is
true
,
were
as
full
of
extravagancies
*NL*
as
overgrown
children
:
the
words
of
their
tumultuary
discussions
*NL*
were
difficultly
understood
and
not
often
nice
:
their
testiness
and
*NL*
outrageous
_
mots
_
were
such
that
his
intellects
resiled
from
:
nor
were
*NL*
they
scrupulously
sensible
of
the
proprieties
though
their
fund
of
*NL*
strong
animal
spirits
spoke
in
their
behalf
.
But
the
word
of
Mr
Costello
*NL*
was
an
unwelcome
language
for
him
for
he
nauseated
the
wretch
that
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
cropeared
creature
of
a
misshapen
gibbosity
,
born
out
*NL*
of
wedlock
and
thrust
like
a
crookback
toothed
and
feet
first
into
the
*NL*
world
,
which
the
dint
of
the
surgeon
's
pliers
in
his
skull
lent
indeed
*NL*
a
colour
to
,
so
as
to
put
him
in
thought
of
that
missing
link
of
*NL*
creation
's
chain
desiderated
by
the
late
ingenious
Mr
Darwin
.
It
was
now
*NL*
for
more
than
the
middle
span
of
our
allotted
years
that
he
had
passed
*NL*
through
the
thousand
vicissitudes
of
existence
and
,
being
of
a
wary
*NL*
ascendancy
and
self
a
man
of
rare
forecast
,
he
had
enjoined
his
heart
*NL*
to
repress
all
motions
of
a
rising
choler
and
,
by
intercepting
them
*NL*
with
the
readiest
precaution
,
foster
within
his
breast
that
plenitude
*NL*
of
sufferance
which
base
minds
jeer
at
,
rash
judgers
scorn
and
all
find
*NL*
tolerable
and
but
tolerable
.
To
those
who
create
themselves
wits
at
the
*NL*
cost
of
feminine
delicacy
-LRB-
a
habit
of
mind
which
he
never
did
hold
*NL*
with
-RRB-
to
them
he
would
concede
neither
to
bear
the
name
nor
to
herit
*NL*
the
tradition
of
a
proper
breeding
:
while
for
such
that
,
having
lost
*NL*
all
forbearance
,
can
lose
no
more
,
there
remained
the
sharp
antidote
of
*NL*
experience
to
cause
their
insolency
to
beat
a
precipitate
and
inglorious
*NL*
retreat
.
Not
but
what
he
could
feel
with
mettlesome
youth
which
,
caring
*NL*
nought
for
the
mows
of
dotards
or
the
gruntlings
of
the
severe
,
is
ever
*NL*
-LRB-
as
the
chaste
fancy
of
the
Holy
Writer
expresses
it
-RRB-
for
eating
of
the
*NL*
tree
forbid
it
yet
not
so
far
forth
as
to
pretermit
humanity
upon
any
*NL*
condition
soever
towards
a
gentlewoman
when
she
was
about
her
lawful
*NL*
occasions
.
To
conclude
,
while
from
the
sister
's
words
he
had
reckoned
*NL*
upon
a
speedy
delivery
he
was
,
however
,
it
must
be
owned
,
not
a
little
*NL*
alleviated
by
the
intelligence
that
the
issue
so
auspicated
after
an
*NL*
ordeal
of
such
duress
now
testified
once
more
to
the
mercy
as
well
as
to
*NL*
the
bounty
of
the
Supreme
Being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
he
broke
his
mind
to
his
neighbour
,
saying
that
,
to
express
*NL*
his
notion
of
the
thing
,
his
opinion
-LRB-
who
ought
not
perchance
to
express
*NL*
one
-RRB-
was
that
one
must
have
a
cold
constitution
and
a
frigid
genius
not
*NL*
to
be
rejoiced
by
this
freshest
news
of
the
fruition
of
her
confinement
*NL*
since
she
had
been
in
such
pain
through
no
fault
of
hers
.
The
dressy
*NL*
young
blade
said
it
was
her
husband
's
that
put
her
in
that
expectation
*NL*
or
at
least
it
ought
to
be
unless
she
were
another
Ephesian
matron
.
I
*NL*
must
acquaint
you
,
said
Mr
Crotthers
,
clapping
on
the
table
so
as
to
*NL*
evoke
a
resonant
comment
of
emphasis
,
old
Glory
Allelujurum
was
round
*NL*
again
today
,
an
elderly
man
with
dundrearies
,
preferring
through
his
*NL*
nose
a
request
to
have
word
of
Wilhelmina
,
my
life
,
as
he
calls
her
.
I
*NL*
bade
him
hold
himself
in
readiness
for
that
the
event
would
burst
anon
.
*NL*
`
Slife
,
I
'll
be
round
with
you
.
I
can
not
but
extol
the
virile
potency
of
*NL*
the
old
bucko
that
could
still
knock
another
child
out
of
her
.
All
fell
*NL*
to
praising
of
it
,
each
after
his
own
fashion
,
though
the
same
young
*NL*
blade
held
with
his
former
view
that
another
than
her
conjugial
had
*NL*
been
the
man
in
the
gap
,
a
clerk
in
orders
,
a
linkboy
-LRB-
virtuous
-RRB-
or
*NL*
an
itinerant
vendor
of
articles
needed
in
every
household
.
Singular
,
*NL*
communed
the
guest
with
himself
,
the
wonderfully
unequal
faculty
of
*NL*
metempsychosis
possessed
by
them
,
that
the
puerperal
dormitory
and
the
*NL*
dissecting
theatre
should
be
the
seminaries
of
such
frivolity
,
that
the
*NL*
mere
acquisition
of
academic
titles
should
suffice
to
transform
in
a
*NL*
pinch
of
time
these
votaries
of
levity
into
exemplary
practitioners
of
*NL*
an
art
which
most
men
anywise
eminent
have
esteemed
the
noblest
.
But
,
*NL*
he
further
added
,
it
is
mayhap
to
relieve
the
pentup
feelings
that
in
*NL*
common
oppress
them
for
I
have
more
than
once
observed
that
birds
of
a
*NL*
feather
laugh
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
what
fitness
,
let
it
be
asked
of
the
noble
lord
,
his
patron
,
*NL*
has
this
alien
,
whom
the
concession
of
a
gracious
prince
has
admitted
*NL*
to
civic
rights
,
constituted
himself
the
lord
paramount
of
our
*NL*
internal
polity
?
Where
is
now
that
gratitude
which
loyalty
should
have
*NL*
counselled
?
During
the
recent
war
whenever
the
enemy
had
a
temporary
*NL*
advantage
with
his
granados
did
this
traitor
to
his
kind
not
seize
that
*NL*
moment
to
discharge
his
piece
against
the
empire
of
which
he
is
a
tenant
*NL*
at
will
while
he
trembled
for
the
security
of
his
four
per
cents
?
Has
he
*NL*
forgotten
this
as
he
forgets
all
benefits
received
?
Or
is
it
that
from
*NL*
being
a
deluder
of
others
he
has
become
at
last
his
own
dupe
as
he
is
,
*NL*
if
report
belie
him
not
,
his
own
and
his
only
enjoyer
?
Far
be
it
from
*NL*
candour
to
violate
the
bedchamber
of
a
respectable
lady
,
the
daughter
of
*NL*
a
gallant
major
,
or
to
cast
the
most
distant
reflections
upon
her
*NL*
virtue
but
if
he
challenges
attention
there
-LRB-
as
it
was
indeed
highly
his
*NL*
interest
not
to
have
done
-RRB-
then
be
it
so
.
Unhappy
woman
,
she
has
been
*NL*
too
long
and
too
persistently
denied
her
legitimate
prerogative
to
*NL*
listen
to
his
objurgations
with
any
other
feeling
than
the
derision
of
*NL*
the
desperate
.
He
says
this
,
a
censor
of
morals
,
a
very
pelican
in
his
*NL*
piety
,
who
did
not
scruple
,
oblivious
of
the
ties
of
nature
,
to
attempt
*NL*
illicit
intercourse
with
a
female
domestic
drawn
from
the
lowest
strata
*NL*
of
society
!
Nay
,
had
the
hussy
's
scouringbrush
not
been
her
tutelary
*NL*
angel
,
it
had
gone
with
her
as
hard
as
with
Hagar
,
the
Egyptian
!
In
the
*NL*
question
of
the
grazing
lands
his
peevish
asperity
is
notorious
and
in
*NL*
Mr
Cuffe
's
hearing
brought
upon
him
from
an
indignant
rancher
a
scathing
*NL*
retort
couched
in
terms
as
straightforward
as
they
were
bucolic
.
It
ill
*NL*
becomes
him
to
preach
that
gospel
.
Has
he
not
nearer
home
a
seedfield
*NL*
that
lies
fallow
for
the
want
of
the
ploughshare
?
A
habit
reprehensible
*NL*
at
puberty
is
second
nature
and
an
opprobrium
in
middle
life
.
If
he
must
*NL*
dispense
his
balm
of
Gilead
in
nostrums
and
apothegms
of
dubious
taste
*NL*
to
restore
to
health
a
generation
of
unfledged
profligates
let
his
*NL*
practice
consist
better
with
the
doctrines
that
now
engross
him
.
His
*NL*
marital
breast
is
the
repository
of
secrets
which
decorum
is
reluctant
*NL*
to
adduce
.
The
lewd
suggestions
of
some
faded
beauty
may
console
him
for
*NL*
a
consort
neglected
and
debauched
but
this
new
exponent
of
morals
and
*NL*
healer
of
ills
is
at
his
best
an
exotic
tree
which
,
when
rooted
in
*NL*
its
native
orient
,
throve
and
flourished
and
was
abundant
in
balm
*NL*
but
,
transplanted
to
a
clime
more
temperate
,
its
roots
have
lost
their
*NL*
quondam
vigour
while
the
stuff
that
comes
away
from
it
is
stagnant
,
acid
*NL*
and
inoperative
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
was
imparted
with
a
circumspection
recalling
the
ceremonial
*NL*
usage
of
the
Sublime
Porte
by
the
second
female
infirmarian
to
the
*NL*
junior
medical
officer
in
residence
,
who
in
his
turn
announced
to
the
*NL*
delegation
that
an
heir
had
been
born
,
When
he
had
betaken
himself
*NL*
to
the
women
's
apartment
to
assist
at
the
prescribed
ceremony
of
the
*NL*
afterbirth
in
the
presence
of
the
secretary
of
state
for
domestic
*NL*
affairs
and
the
members
of
the
privy
council
,
silent
in
unanimous
*NL*
exhaustion
and
approbation
the
delegates
,
chafing
under
the
length
and
*NL*
solemnity
of
their
vigil
and
hoping
that
the
joyful
occurrence
would
*NL*
palliate
a
licence
which
the
simultaneous
absence
of
abigail
and
*NL*
obstetrician
rendered
the
easier
,
broke
out
at
once
into
a
strife
of
*NL*
tongues
.
In
vain
the
voice
of
Mr
Canvasser
Bloom
was
heard
endeavouring
*NL*
to
urge
,
to
mollify
,
to
refrain
.
The
moment
was
too
propitious
for
the
*NL*
display
of
that
discursiveness
which
seemed
the
only
bond
of
union
among
*NL*
tempers
so
divergent
.
Every
phase
of
the
situation
was
successively
*NL*
eviscerated
:
the
prenatal
repugnance
of
uterine
brothers
,
the
Caesarean
*NL*
section
,
posthumity
with
respect
to
the
father
and
,
that
rarer
form
,
*NL*
with
respect
to
the
mother
,
the
fratricidal
case
known
as
the
Childs
*NL*
Murder
and
rendered
memorable
by
the
impassioned
plea
of
Mr
Advocate
*NL*
Bushe
which
secured
the
acquittal
of
the
wrongfully
accused
,
the
*NL*
rights
of
primogeniture
and
king
's
bounty
touching
twins
and
triplets
,
*NL*
miscarriages
and
infanticides
,
simulated
or
dissimulated
,
the
acardiac
*NL*
_
foetus
in
foetu
_
and
aprosopia
due
to
a
congestion
,
the
agnathia
*NL*
of
certain
chinless
Chinamen
-LRB-
cited
by
Mr
Candidate
Mulligan
-RRB-
in
*NL*
consequence
of
defective
reunion
of
the
maxillary
knobs
along
the
medial
*NL*
line
so
that
-LRB-
as
he
said
-RRB-
one
ear
could
hear
what
the
other
spoke
,
the
*NL*
benefits
of
anesthesia
or
twilight
sleep
,
the
prolongation
of
labour
*NL*
pains
in
advanced
gravidancy
by
reason
of
pressure
on
the
vein
,
the
*NL*
premature
relentment
of
the
amniotic
fluid
-LRB-
as
exemplified
in
the
*NL*
actual
case
-RRB-
with
consequent
peril
of
sepsis
to
the
matrix
,
artificial
*NL*
insemination
by
means
of
syringes
,
involution
of
the
womb
consequent
*NL*
upon
the
menopause
,
the
problem
of
the
perpetration
of
the
species
in
*NL*
the
case
of
females
impregnated
by
delinquent
rape
,
that
distressing
*NL*
manner
of
delivery
called
by
the
Brandenburghers
_
Sturzgeburt
,
_
the
*NL*
recorded
instances
of
multiseminal
,
twikindled
and
monstrous
births
*NL*
conceived
during
the
catamenic
period
or
of
consanguineous
parents
--
in
*NL*
a
word
all
the
cases
of
human
nativity
which
Aristotle
has
classified
*NL*
in
his
masterpiece
with
chromolithographic
illustrations
.
The
gravest
*NL*
problems
of
obstetrics
and
forensic
medicine
were
examined
with
as
much
*NL*
animation
as
the
most
popular
beliefs
on
the
state
of
pregnancy
such
as
*NL*
the
forbidding
to
a
gravid
woman
to
step
over
a
countrystile
lest
,
*NL*
by
her
movement
,
the
navelcord
should
strangle
her
creature
and
*NL*
the
injunction
upon
her
in
the
event
of
a
yearning
,
ardently
and
*NL*
ineffectually
entertained
,
to
place
her
hand
against
that
part
of
her
*NL*
person
which
long
usage
has
consecrated
as
the
seat
of
castigation
.
*NL*
The
abnormalities
of
harelip
,
breastmole
,
supernumerary
digits
,
negro
's
*NL*
inkle
,
strawberry
mark
and
portwine
stain
were
alleged
by
one
as
a
*NL*
_
prima
facie
_
and
natural
hypothetical
explanation
of
those
swineheaded
*NL*
-LRB-
the
case
of
Madame
Grissel
Steevens
was
not
forgotten
-RRB-
or
doghaired
*NL*
infants
occasionally
born
.
The
hypothesis
of
a
plasmic
memory
,
advanced
*NL*
by
the
Caledonian
envoy
and
worthy
of
the
metaphysical
traditions
of
*NL*
the
land
he
stood
for
,
envisaged
in
such
cases
an
arrest
of
embryonic
*NL*
development
at
some
stage
antecedent
to
the
human
.
An
outlandish
*NL*
delegate
sustained
against
both
these
views
,
with
such
heat
as
almost
*NL*
carried
conviction
,
the
theory
of
copulation
between
women
and
the
males
*NL*
of
brutes
,
his
authority
being
his
own
avouchment
in
support
of
fables
*NL*
such
as
that
of
the
Minotaur
which
the
genius
of
the
elegant
Latin
poet
*NL*
has
handed
down
to
us
in
the
pages
of
his
Metamorphoses
.
The
impression
*NL*
made
by
his
words
was
immediate
but
shortlived
.
It
was
effaced
as
easily
*NL*
as
it
had
been
evoked
by
an
allocution
from
Mr
Candidate
Mulligan
in
*NL*
that
vein
of
pleasantry
which
none
better
than
he
knew
how
to
affect
,
*NL*
postulating
as
the
supremest
object
of
desire
a
nice
clean
old
man
.
*NL*
Contemporaneously
,
a
heated
argument
having
arisen
between
Mr
Delegate
*NL*
Madden
and
Mr
Candidate
Lynch
regarding
the
juridical
and
theological
*NL*
dilemma
created
in
the
event
of
one
Siamese
twin
predeceasing
the
other
,
*NL*
the
difficulty
by
mutual
consent
was
referred
to
Mr
Canvasser
Bloom
*NL*
for
instant
submittal
to
Mr
Coadjutor
Deacon
Dedalus
.
Hitherto
silent
,
*NL*
whether
the
better
to
show
by
preternatural
gravity
that
curious
dignity
*NL*
of
the
garb
with
which
he
was
invested
or
in
obedience
to
an
inward
*NL*
voice
,
he
delivered
briefly
and
,
as
some
thought
,
perfunctorily
the
*NL*
ecclesiastical
ordinance
forbidding
man
to
put
asunder
what
God
has
*NL*
joined
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Malachias
'
tale
began
to
freeze
them
with
horror
.
He
conjured
up
the
*NL*
scene
before
them
.
The
secret
panel
beside
the
chimney
slid
back
and
*NL*
in
the
recess
appeared
...
Haines
!
Which
of
us
did
not
feel
his
flesh
*NL*
creep
!
He
had
a
portfolio
full
of
Celtic
literature
in
one
hand
,
in
the
*NL*
other
a
phial
marked
_
Poison
.
_
Surprise
,
horror
,
loathing
were
depicted
*NL*
on
all
faces
while
he
eyed
them
with
a
ghostly
grin
.
I
anticipated
some
*NL*
such
reception
,
he
began
with
an
eldritch
laugh
,
for
which
,
it
seems
,
*NL*
history
is
to
blame
.
Yes
,
it
is
true
.
I
am
the
murderer
of
Samuel
*NL*
Childs
.
And
how
I
am
punished
!
The
inferno
has
no
terrors
for
me
.
This
*NL*
is
the
appearance
is
on
me
.
Tare
and
ages
,
what
way
would
I
be
resting
*NL*
at
all
,
he
muttered
thickly
,
and
I
tramping
Dublin
this
while
back
*NL*
with
my
share
of
songs
and
himself
after
me
the
like
of
a
soulth
or
a
*NL*
bullawurrus
?
My
hell
,
and
Ireland
's
,
is
in
this
life
.
It
is
what
I
tried
*NL*
to
obliterate
my
crime
.
Distractions
,
rookshooting
,
the
Erse
language
*NL*
-LRB-
he
recited
some
-RRB-
,
laudanum
-LRB-
he
raised
the
phial
to
his
lips
-RRB-
,
camping
*NL*
out
.
In
vain
!
His
spectre
stalks
me
.
Dope
is
my
only
hope
...
Ah
!
*NL*
Destruction
!
The
black
panther
!
With
a
cry
he
suddenly
vanished
and
the
*NL*
panel
slid
back
.
An
instant
later
his
head
appeared
in
the
door
opposite
*NL*
and
said
:
Meet
me
at
Westland
Row
station
at
ten
past
eleven
.
He
was
*NL*
gone
.
Tears
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
the
dissipated
host
.
The
seer
*NL*
raised
his
hand
to
heaven
,
murmuring
:
The
vendetta
of
Mananaun
!
The
*NL*
sage
repeated
:
_
Lex
talionis
_
.
The
sentimentalist
is
he
who
would
enjoy
*NL*
without
incurring
the
immense
debtorship
for
a
thing
done
.
Malachias
,
*NL*
overcome
by
emotion
,
ceased
.
The
mystery
was
unveiled
.
Haines
was
the
*NL*
third
brother
.
His
real
name
was
Childs
.
The
black
panther
was
himself
*NL*
the
ghost
of
his
own
father
.
He
drank
drugs
to
obliterate
.
For
this
*NL*
relief
much
thanks
.
The
lonely
house
by
the
graveyard
is
uninhabited
.
*NL*
No
soul
will
live
there
.
The
spider
pitches
her
web
in
the
solitude
.
*NL*
The
nocturnal
rat
peers
from
his
hole
.
A
curse
is
on
it
.
It
is
haunted
.
*NL*
Murderer
's
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
the
age
of
the
soul
of
man
?
As
she
hath
the
virtue
of
the
*NL*
chameleon
to
change
her
hue
at
every
new
approach
,
to
be
gay
with
the
*NL*
merry
and
mournful
with
the
downcast
,
so
too
is
her
age
changeable
as
*NL*
her
mood
.
No
longer
is
Leopold
,
as
he
sits
there
,
ruminating
,
chewing
*NL*
the
cud
of
reminiscence
,
that
staid
agent
of
publicity
and
holder
of
a
*NL*
modest
substance
in
the
funds
.
A
score
of
years
are
blown
away
.
He
is
*NL*
young
Leopold
.
There
,
as
in
a
retrospective
arrangement
,
a
mirror
within
*NL*
a
mirror
-LRB-
hey
,
presto
!
-RRB-
,
he
beholdeth
himself
.
That
young
figure
of
then
*NL*
is
seen
,
precociously
manly
,
walking
on
a
nipping
morning
from
the
old
*NL*
house
in
Clanbrassil
street
to
the
high
school
,
his
booksatchel
on
*NL*
him
bandolierwise
,
and
in
it
a
goodly
hunk
of
wheaten
loaf
,
a
mother
's
*NL*
thought
.
Or
it
is
the
same
figure
,
a
year
or
so
gone
over
,
in
his
first
*NL*
hard
hat
-LRB-
ah
,
that
was
a
day
!
-RRB-
,
already
on
the
road
,
a
fullfledged
*NL*
traveller
for
the
family
firm
,
equipped
with
an
orderbook
,
a
scented
*NL*
handkerchief
-LRB-
not
for
show
only
-RRB-
,
his
case
of
bright
trinketware
-LRB-
alas
!
*NL*
a
thing
now
of
the
past
!
-RRB-
and
a
quiverful
of
compliant
smiles
for
this
*NL*
or
that
halfwon
housewife
reckoning
it
out
upon
her
fingertips
or
for
*NL*
a
budding
virgin
,
shyly
acknowledging
-LRB-
but
the
heart
?
tell
me
!
-RRB-
his
*NL*
studied
baisemoins
.
The
scent
,
the
smile
,
but
,
more
than
these
,
the
dark
*NL*
eyes
and
oleaginous
address
,
brought
home
at
duskfall
many
a
commission
*NL*
to
the
head
of
the
firm
,
seated
with
Jacob
's
pipe
after
like
labours
in
*NL*
the
paternal
ingle
-LRB-
a
meal
of
noodles
,
you
may
be
sure
,
is
aheating
-RRB-
,
*NL*
reading
through
round
horned
spectacles
some
paper
from
the
Europe
of
a
*NL*
month
before
.
But
hey
,
presto
,
the
mirror
is
breathed
on
and
the
young
*NL*
knighterrant
recedes
,
shrivels
,
dwindles
to
a
tiny
speck
within
the
*NL*
mist
.
Now
he
is
himself
paternal
and
these
about
him
might
be
his
*NL*
sons
.
Who
can
say
?
The
wise
father
knows
his
own
child
.
He
thinks
of
a
*NL*
drizzling
night
in
Hatch
street
,
hard
by
the
bonded
stores
there
,
the
*NL*
first
.
Together
-LRB-
she
is
a
poor
waif
,
a
child
of
shame
,
yours
and
mine
*NL*
and
of
all
for
a
bare
shilling
and
her
luckpenny
-RRB-
,
together
they
hear
*NL*
the
heavy
tread
of
the
watch
as
two
raincaped
shadows
pass
the
new
royal
*NL*
university
.
Bridie
!
Bridie
Kelly
!
He
will
never
forget
the
name
,
ever
*NL*
remember
the
night
:
first
night
,
the
bridenight
.
They
are
entwined
*NL*
in
nethermost
darkness
,
the
willer
with
the
willed
,
and
in
an
instant
*NL*
-LRB-
_
fiat
_
!
-RRB-
light
shall
flood
the
world
.
Did
heart
leap
to
heart
?
Nay
,
*NL*
fair
reader
.
In
a
breath
't
was
done
but
--
hold
!
Back
!
It
must
not
be
!
In
*NL*
terror
the
poor
girl
flees
away
through
the
murk
.
She
is
the
bride
of
*NL*
darkness
,
a
daughter
of
night
.
She
dare
not
bear
the
sunnygolden
babe
*NL*
of
day
.
No
,
Leopold
.
Name
and
memory
solace
thee
not
.
That
youthful
*NL*
illusion
of
thy
strength
was
taken
from
thee
--
and
in
vain
.
No
son
of
thy
*NL*
loins
is
by
thee
.
There
is
none
now
to
be
for
Leopold
,
what
Leopold
was
*NL*
for
Rudolph
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voices
blend
and
fuse
in
clouded
silence
:
silence
that
is
the
*NL*
infinite
of
space
:
and
swiftly
,
silently
the
soul
is
wafted
over
regions
*NL*
of
cycles
of
generations
that
have
lived
.
A
region
where
grey
twilight
*NL*
ever
descends
,
never
falls
on
wide
sagegreen
pasturefields
,
shedding
her
*NL*
dusk
,
scattering
a
perennial
dew
of
stars
.
She
follows
her
mother
with
*NL*
ungainly
steps
,
a
mare
leading
her
fillyfoal
.
Twilight
phantoms
*NL*
are
they
,
yet
moulded
in
prophetic
grace
of
structure
,
slim
shapely
*NL*
haunches
,
a
supple
tendonous
neck
,
the
meek
apprehensive
skull
.
They
*NL*
fade
,
sad
phantoms
:
all
is
gone
.
Agendath
is
a
waste
land
,
a
home
of
*NL*
screechowls
and
the
sandblind
upupa
.
Netaim
,
the
golden
,
is
no
more
.
And
*NL*
on
the
highway
of
the
clouds
they
come
,
muttering
thunder
of
rebellion
,
*NL*
the
ghosts
of
beasts
.
Huuh
!
Hark
!
Huuh
!
Parallax
stalks
behind
and
goads
*NL*
them
,
the
lancinating
lightnings
of
whose
brow
are
scorpions
.
Elk
and
*NL*
yak
,
the
bulls
of
Bashan
and
of
Babylon
,
mammoth
and
mastodon
,
they
come
*NL*
trooping
to
the
sunken
sea
,
_
Lacus
Mortis
_
.
Ominous
revengeful
zodiacal
*NL*
host
!
They
moan
,
passing
upon
the
clouds
,
horned
and
capricorned
,
the
*NL*
trumpeted
with
the
tusked
,
the
lionmaned
,
the
giantantlered
,
snouter
*NL*
and
crawler
,
rodent
,
ruminant
and
pachyderm
,
all
their
moving
moaning
*NL*
multitude
,
murderers
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Onward
to
the
dead
sea
they
tramp
to
drink
,
unslaked
and
with
horrible
*NL*
gulpings
,
the
salt
somnolent
inexhaustible
flood
.
And
the
equine
portent
*NL*
grows
again
,
magnified
in
the
deserted
heavens
,
nay
to
heaven
's
own
*NL*
magnitude
,
till
it
looms
,
vast
,
over
the
house
of
Virgo
.
And
lo
,
wonder
*NL*
of
metempsychosis
,
it
is
she
,
the
everlasting
bride
,
harbinger
of
the
*NL*
daystar
,
the
bride
,
ever
virgin
.
It
is
she
,
Martha
,
thou
lost
one
,
*NL*
Millicent
,
the
young
,
the
dear
,
the
radiant
.
How
serene
does
she
now
*NL*
arise
,
a
queen
among
the
Pleiades
,
in
the
penultimate
antelucan
hour
,
*NL*
shod
in
sandals
of
bright
gold
,
coifed
with
a
veil
of
what
do
you
call
*NL*
it
gossamer
.
It
floats
,
it
flows
about
her
starborn
flesh
and
loose
it
*NL*
streams
,
emerald
,
sapphire
,
mauve
and
heliotrope
,
sustained
on
currents
*NL*
of
the
cold
interstellar
wind
,
winding
,
coiling
,
simply
swirling
,
*NL*
writhing
in
the
skies
a
mysterious
writing
till
,
after
a
myriad
*NL*
metamorphoses
of
symbol
,
it
blazes
,
Alpha
,
a
ruby
and
triangled
sign
*NL*
upon
the
forehead
of
Taurus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Francis
was
reminding
Stephen
of
years
before
when
they
had
been
at
*NL*
school
together
in
Conmee
's
time
.
He
asked
about
Glaucon
,
Alcibiades
,
*NL*
Pisistratus
.
Where
were
they
now
?
Neither
knew
.
You
have
spoken
of
the
*NL*
past
and
its
phantoms
,
Stephen
said
.
Why
think
of
them
?
If
I
call
them
*NL*
into
life
across
the
waters
of
Lethe
will
not
the
poor
ghosts
troop
to
*NL*
my
call
?
Who
supposes
it
?
I
,
Bous
Stephanoumenos
,
bullockbefriending
*NL*
bard
,
am
lord
and
giver
of
their
life
.
He
encircled
his
gadding
hair
*NL*
with
a
coronal
of
vineleaves
,
smiling
at
Vincent
.
That
answer
and
those
*NL*
leaves
,
Vincent
said
to
him
,
will
adorn
you
more
fitly
when
something
*NL*
more
,
and
greatly
more
,
than
a
capful
of
light
odes
can
call
your
genius
*NL*
father
.
All
who
wish
you
well
hope
this
for
you
.
All
desire
to
see
*NL*
you
bring
forth
the
work
you
meditate
,
to
acclaim
you
Stephaneforos
.
I
*NL*
heartily
wish
you
may
not
fail
them
.
O
no
,
Vincent
Lenehan
said
,
laying
*NL*
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
near
him
.
Have
no
fear
.
He
could
not
leave
his
*NL*
mother
an
orphan
.
The
young
man
's
face
grew
dark
.
All
could
see
how
hard
*NL*
it
was
for
him
to
be
reminded
of
his
promise
and
of
his
recent
loss
.
He
*NL*
would
have
withdrawn
from
the
feast
had
not
the
noise
of
voices
allayed
*NL*
the
smart
.
Madden
had
lost
five
drachmas
on
Sceptre
for
a
whim
of
the
*NL*
rider
's
name
:
Lenehan
as
much
more
.
He
told
them
of
the
race
.
The
flag
*NL*
fell
and
,
huuh
!
off
,
scamper
,
the
mare
ran
out
freshly
with
0
.
Madden
*NL*
up
.
She
was
leading
the
field
.
All
hearts
were
beating
.
Even
Phyllis
*NL*
could
not
contain
herself
.
She
waved
her
scarf
and
cried
:
Huzzah
!
*NL*
Sceptre
wins
!
But
in
the
straight
on
the
run
home
when
all
were
in
close
*NL*
order
the
dark
horse
Throwaway
drew
level
,
reached
,
outstripped
her
.
All
*NL*
was
lost
now
.
Phyllis
was
silent
:
her
eyes
were
sad
anemones
.
Juno
,
she
*NL*
cried
,
I
am
undone
.
But
her
lover
consoled
her
and
brought
her
a
bright
*NL*
casket
of
gold
in
which
lay
some
oval
sugarplums
which
she
partook
.
A
*NL*
tear
fell
:
one
only
.
A
whacking
fine
whip
,
said
Lenehan
,
is
W.
Lane
.
*NL*
Four
winners
yesterday
and
three
today
.
What
rider
is
like
him
?
Mount
*NL*
him
on
the
camel
or
the
boisterous
buffalo
the
victory
in
a
hack
canter
*NL*
is
still
his
.
But
let
us
bear
it
as
was
the
ancient
wont
.
Mercy
on
the
*NL*
luckless
!
Poor
Sceptre
!
he
said
with
a
light
sigh
.
She
is
not
the
filly
*NL*
that
she
was
.
Never
,
by
this
hand
,
shall
we
behold
such
another
.
By
gad
,
*NL*
sir
,
a
queen
of
them
.
Do
you
remember
her
,
Vincent
?
I
wish
you
could
*NL*
have
seen
my
queen
today
,
Vincent
said
.
How
young
she
was
and
radiant
*NL*
-LRB-
Lalage
were
scarce
fair
beside
her
-RRB-
in
her
yellow
shoes
and
frock
of
*NL*
muslin
,
I
do
not
know
the
right
name
of
it
.
The
chestnuts
that
shaded
*NL*
us
were
in
bloom
:
the
air
drooped
with
their
persuasive
odour
and
with
*NL*
pollen
floating
by
us
.
In
the
sunny
patches
one
might
easily
have
*NL*
cooked
on
a
stone
a
batch
of
those
buns
with
Corinth
fruit
in
them
that
*NL*
Periplipomenes
sells
in
his
booth
near
the
bridge
.
But
she
had
nought
*NL*
for
her
teeth
but
the
arm
with
which
I
held
her
and
in
that
she
nibbled
*NL*
mischievously
when
I
pressed
too
close
.
A
week
ago
she
lay
ill
,
four
*NL*
days
on
the
couch
,
but
today
she
was
free
,
blithe
,
mocked
at
peril
.
*NL*
She
is
more
taking
then
.
Her
posies
tool
Mad
romp
that
she
is
,
she
had
*NL*
pulled
her
fill
as
we
reclined
together
.
And
in
your
ear
,
my
friend
,
you
*NL*
will
not
think
who
met
us
as
we
left
the
field
.
Conmee
himself
!
He
was
*NL*
walking
by
the
hedge
,
reading
,
I
think
a
brevier
book
with
,
I
doubt
not
,
*NL*
a
witty
letter
in
it
from
Glycera
or
Chloe
to
keep
the
page
.
The
sweet
*NL*
creature
turned
all
colours
in
her
confusion
,
feigning
to
reprove
a
*NL*
slight
disorder
in
her
dress
:
a
slip
of
underwood
clung
there
for
the
*NL*
very
trees
adore
her
.
When
Conmee
had
passed
she
glanced
at
her
lovely
*NL*
echo
in
that
little
mirror
she
carries
.
But
he
had
been
kind
.
In
going
*NL*
by
he
had
blessed
us
.
The
gods
too
are
ever
kind
,
Lenehan
said
.
If
I
had
*NL*
poor
luck
with
Bass
's
mare
perhaps
this
draught
of
his
may
serve
me
more
*NL*
propensely
.
He
was
laying
his
hand
upon
a
winejar
:
Malachi
saw
it
and
*NL*
withheld
his
act
,
pointing
to
the
stranger
and
to
the
scarlet
label
.
*NL*
Warily
,
Malachi
whispered
,
preserve
a
druid
silence
.
His
soul
is
far
*NL*
away
.
It
is
as
painful
perhaps
to
be
awakened
from
a
vision
as
to
be
*NL*
born
.
Any
object
,
intensely
regarded
,
may
be
a
gate
of
access
to
the
*NL*
incorruptible
eon
of
the
gods
.
Do
you
not
think
it
,
Stephen
?
Theosophos
*NL*
told
me
so
,
Stephen
answered
,
whom
in
a
previous
existence
Egyptian
*NL*
priests
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
karmic
law
.
The
lords
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
Theosophos
told
me
,
an
orangefiery
shipload
from
planet
Alpha
*NL*
of
the
lunar
chain
would
not
assume
the
etheric
doubles
and
these
*NL*
were
therefore
incarnated
by
the
rubycoloured
egos
from
the
second
*NL*
constellation
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
,
the
preposterous
surmise
about
him
*NL*
being
in
some
description
of
a
doldrums
or
other
or
mesmerised
which
*NL*
was
entirely
due
to
a
misconception
of
the
shallowest
character
,
was
*NL*
not
the
case
at
all
.
The
individual
whose
visual
organs
while
the
above
*NL*
was
going
on
were
at
this
juncture
commencing
to
exhibit
symptoms
of
*NL*
animation
was
as
astute
if
not
astuter
than
any
man
living
and
anybody
*NL*
that
conjectured
the
contrary
would
have
found
themselves
pretty
*NL*
speedily
in
the
wrong
shop
.
During
the
past
four
minutes
or
thereabouts
*NL*
he
had
been
staring
hard
at
a
certain
amount
of
number
one
Bass
bottled
*NL*
by
Messrs
Bass
and
Co
at
Burton-on-Trent
which
happened
to
be
situated
*NL*
amongst
a
lot
of
others
right
opposite
to
where
he
was
and
which
was
*NL*
certainly
calculated
to
attract
anyone
's
remark
on
account
of
its
*NL*
scarlet
appearance
.
He
was
simply
and
solely
,
as
it
subsequently
*NL*
transpired
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
,
which
put
quite
an
*NL*
altogether
different
complexion
on
the
proceedings
,
after
the
moment
*NL*
before
's
observations
about
boyhood
days
and
the
turf
,
recollecting
two
*NL*
or
three
private
transactions
of
his
own
which
the
other
two
were
as
*NL*
mutually
innocent
of
as
the
babe
unborn
.
Eventually
,
however
,
both
*NL*
their
eyes
met
and
as
soon
as
it
began
to
dawn
on
him
that
the
other
was
*NL*
endeavouring
to
help
himself
to
the
thing
he
involuntarily
determined
*NL*
to
help
him
himself
and
so
he
accordingly
took
hold
of
the
neck
of
the
*NL*
mediumsized
glass
recipient
which
contained
the
fluid
sought
after
and
*NL*
made
a
capacious
hole
in
it
by
pouring
a
lot
of
it
out
with
,
also
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
however
,
a
considerable
degree
of
attentiveness
in
order
not
*NL*
to
upset
any
of
the
beer
that
was
in
it
about
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
debate
which
ensued
was
in
its
scope
and
progress
an
epitome
of
the
*NL*
course
of
life
.
Neither
place
nor
council
was
lacking
in
dignity
.
The
*NL*
debaters
were
the
keenest
in
the
land
,
the
theme
they
were
engaged
on
*NL*
the
loftiest
and
most
vital
.
The
high
hall
of
Horne
's
house
had
never
*NL*
beheld
an
assembly
so
representative
and
so
varied
nor
had
the
*NL*
old
rafters
of
that
establishment
ever
listened
to
a
language
so
*NL*
encyclopaedic
.
A
gallant
scene
in
truth
it
made
.
Crotthers
was
there
at
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
table
in
his
striking
Highland
garb
,
his
face
glowing
*NL*
from
the
briny
airs
of
the
Mull
of
Galloway
.
There
too
,
opposite
to
him
,
*NL*
was
Lynch
whose
countenance
bore
already
the
stigmata
of
early
depravity
*NL*
and
premature
wisdom
.
Next
the
Scotchman
was
the
place
assigned
to
*NL*
Costello
,
the
eccentric
,
while
at
his
side
was
seated
in
stolid
repose
*NL*
the
squat
form
of
Madden
.
The
chair
of
the
resident
indeed
stood
vacant
*NL*
before
the
hearth
but
on
either
flank
of
it
the
figure
of
Bannon
in
*NL*
explorer
's
kit
of
tweed
shorts
and
salted
cowhide
brogues
contrasted
*NL*
sharply
with
the
primrose
elegance
and
townbred
manners
of
Malachi
*NL*
Roland
St
John
Mulligan
.
Lastly
at
the
head
of
the
board
was
the
young
*NL*
poet
who
found
a
refuge
from
his
labours
of
pedagogy
and
metaphysical
*NL*
inquisition
in
the
convivial
atmosphere
of
Socratic
discussion
,
while
*NL*
to
right
and
left
of
him
were
accommodated
the
flippant
prognosticator
,
*NL*
fresh
from
the
hippodrome
,
and
that
vigilant
wanderer
,
soiled
by
the
*NL*
dust
of
travel
and
combat
and
stained
by
the
mire
of
an
indelible
*NL*
dishonour
,
but
from
whose
steadfast
and
constant
heart
no
lure
or
peril
*NL*
or
threat
or
degradation
could
ever
efface
the
image
of
that
voluptuous
*NL*
loveliness
which
the
inspired
pencil
of
Lafayette
has
limned
for
ages
*NL*
yet
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
better
be
stated
here
and
now
at
the
outset
that
the
perverted
*NL*
transcendentalism
to
which
Mr
S.
Dedalus
'
-LRB-
Div
.
Scep
.
-RRB-
contentions
*NL*
would
appear
to
prove
him
pretty
badly
addicted
runs
directly
counter
to
*NL*
accepted
scientific
methods
.
Science
,
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
,
*NL*
deals
with
tangible
phenomena
.
The
man
of
science
like
the
man
in
the
*NL*
street
has
to
face
hardheaded
facts
that
can
not
be
blinked
and
explain
*NL*
them
as
best
he
can
.
There
may
be
,
it
is
true
,
some
questions
which
*NL*
science
can
not
answer
--
at
present
--
such
as
the
first
problem
submitted
*NL*
by
Mr
L.
Bloom
-LRB-
Pubb
.
Canv
.
-RRB-
regarding
the
future
determination
of
sex
.
*NL*
Must
we
accept
the
view
of
Empedocles
of
Trinacria
that
the
right
ovary
*NL*
-LRB-
the
postmenstrual
period
,
assert
others
-RRB-
is
responsible
for
the
birth
*NL*
of
males
or
are
the
too
long
neglected
spermatozoa
or
nemasperms
the
*NL*
differentiating
factors
or
is
it
,
as
most
embryologists
incline
to
*NL*
opine
,
such
as
Culpepper
,
Spallanzani
,
Blumenbach
,
Lusk
,
Hertwig
,
*NL*
Leopold
and
Valenti
,
a
mixture
of
both
?
This
would
be
tantamount
to
*NL*
a
cooperation
-LRB-
one
of
nature
's
favourite
devices
-RRB-
between
the
_
nisus
*NL*
formativus
_
of
the
nemasperm
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
a
happily
*NL*
chosen
position
,
_
succubitus
felix
_
of
the
passive
element
.
The
other
*NL*
problem
raised
by
the
same
inquirer
is
scarcely
less
vital
:
infant
*NL*
mortality
.
It
is
interesting
because
,
as
he
pertinently
remarks
,
we
*NL*
are
all
born
in
the
same
way
but
we
all
die
in
different
ways
.
Mr
M.
*NL*
Mulligan
-LRB-
Hyg
.
et
Eug
.
Doc
.
-RRB-
blames
the
sanitary
conditions
in
which
*NL*
our
greylunged
citizens
contract
adenoids
,
pulmonary
complaints
etc.
by
*NL*
inhaling
the
bacteria
which
lurk
in
dust
.
These
factors
,
he
alleged
,
*NL*
and
the
revolting
spectacles
offered
by
our
streets
,
hideous
publicity
*NL*
posters
,
religious
ministers
of
all
denominations
,
mutilated
soldiers
*NL*
and
sailors
,
exposed
scorbutic
cardrivers
,
the
suspended
carcases
of
*NL*
dead
animals
,
paranoic
bachelors
and
unfructified
duennas
--
these
,
he
*NL*
said
,
were
accountable
for
any
and
every
fallingoff
in
the
calibre
of
*NL*
the
race
.
Kalipedia
,
he
prophesied
,
would
soon
be
generally
adopted
*NL*
and
all
the
graces
of
life
,
genuinely
good
music
,
agreeable
literature
,
*NL*
light
philosophy
,
instructive
pictures
,
plastercast
reproductions
of
*NL*
the
classical
statues
such
as
Venus
and
Apollo
,
artistic
coloured
*NL*
photographs
of
prize
babies
,
all
these
little
attentions
would
enable
*NL*
ladies
who
were
in
a
particular
condition
to
pass
the
intervening
months
*NL*
in
a
most
enjoyable
manner
.
Mr
J.
Crotthers
-LRB-
Disc
.
Bacc
.
-RRB-
attributes
*NL*
some
of
these
demises
to
abdominal
trauma
in
the
case
of
women
workers
*NL*
subjected
to
heavy
labours
in
the
workshop
and
to
marital
discipline
in
*NL*
the
home
but
by
far
the
vast
majority
to
neglect
,
private
or
official
,
*NL*
culminating
in
the
exposure
of
newborn
infants
,
the
practice
of
criminal
*NL*
abortion
or
in
the
atrocious
crime
of
infanticide
.
Although
the
former
*NL*
-LRB-
we
are
thinking
of
neglect
-RRB-
is
undoubtedly
only
too
true
the
case
he
*NL*
cites
of
nurses
forgetting
to
count
the
sponges
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
*NL*
is
too
rare
to
be
normative
.
In
fact
when
one
comes
to
look
into
it
the
*NL*
wonder
is
that
so
many
pregnancies
and
deliveries
go
off
so
well
as
they
*NL*
do
,
all
things
considered
and
in
spite
of
our
human
shortcomings
which
*NL*
often
baulk
nature
in
her
intentions
.
An
ingenious
suggestion
is
*NL*
that
thrown
out
by
Mr
V.
Lynch
-LRB-
Bacc
.
Arith
.
-RRB-
that
both
natality
and
*NL*
mortality
,
as
well
as
all
other
phenomena
of
evolution
,
tidal
movements
,
*NL*
lunar
phases
,
blood
temperatures
,
diseases
in
general
,
everything
,
in
*NL*
fine
,
in
nature
's
vast
workshop
from
the
extinction
of
some
remote
sun
*NL*
to
the
blossoming
of
one
of
the
countless
flowers
which
beautify
our
*NL*
public
parks
is
subject
to
a
law
of
numeration
as
yet
unascertained
.
*NL*
Still
the
plain
straightforward
question
why
a
child
of
normally
healthy
*NL*
parents
and
seemingly
a
healthy
child
and
properly
looked
after
succumbs
*NL*
unaccountably
in
early
childhood
-LRB-
though
other
children
of
the
same
*NL*
marriage
do
not
-RRB-
must
certainly
,
in
the
poet
's
words
,
give
us
pause
.
*NL*
Nature
,
we
may
rest
assured
,
has
her
own
good
and
cogent
reasons
for
*NL*
whatever
she
does
and
in
all
probability
such
deaths
are
due
to
some
law
*NL*
of
anticipation
by
which
organisms
in
which
morbous
germs
have
taken
*NL*
up
their
residence
-LRB-
modern
science
has
conclusively
shown
that
only
the
*NL*
plasmic
substance
can
be
said
to
be
immortal
-RRB-
tend
to
disappear
at
an
*NL*
increasingly
earlier
stage
of
development
,
an
arrangement
which
,
though
*NL*
productive
of
pain
to
some
of
our
feelings
-LRB-
notably
the
maternal
-RRB-
,
is
*NL*
nevertheless
,
some
of
us
think
,
in
the
long
run
beneficial
to
the
*NL*
race
in
general
in
securing
thereby
the
survival
of
the
fittest

it

perhaps
be
stated
that

the

let

out

give

life
,
as
he
phrased
it

*NL*
to
save
her

At
the
risk
of
her

was
the
telling
rejoinder
of

his
interlocutor
,
none
the
less
effective
for
the
moderate
and
measured
*NL*
tone
in
which
it
was
delivered

*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
skill
and
patience
of
the
physician
had
brought
about
a
*NL*
happy
_
accouchement

It
had
been
a
weary

while
both
for
patient

All
that
surgical
skill
could
do
was
done

the

had
manfully

are

too

Reverently
look
at

she
reclines
there
with
the

that

breathing

clay
,
the
fruit
of
their
lawful
embraces
.
He
is
older
now
*NL*
-LRB-
you
and
I
may
whisper
it
-RRB-
and
a
trifle
stooped
in
the
shoulders
yet
*NL*
in
the
whirligig
of
years
a
grave
dignity
has
come
to
the
conscientious
*NL*
second
accountant
of
the
Ulster
bank
,
College
Green
branch
.
O
Doady
,
*NL*
loved
one
of
old
,
faithful
lifemate
now
,
it
may
never
be
again
,
that
*NL*
faroff
time
of
the
roses
!
With
the
old
shake
of
her
pretty
head
she
*NL*
recalls
those
days
.
God
!
How
beautiful
now
across
the
mist
of
years
!
But
*NL*
their
children
are
grouped
in
her
imagination
about
the
bedside
,
hers
*NL*
and
his
,
Charley
,
Mary
Alice
,
Frederick
Albert
-LRB-
if
he
had
lived
-RRB-
,
Mamy
,
*NL*
Budgy
-LRB-
Victoria
Frances
-RRB-
,
Tom
,
Violet
Constance
Louisa
,
darling
little
*NL*
Bobsy
-LRB-
called
after
our
famous
hero
of
the
South
African
war
,
lord
Bobs
*NL*
of
Waterford
and
Candahar
-RRB-
and
now
this
last
pledge
of
their
union
,
a
*NL*
Purefoy
if
ever
there
was
one
,
with
the
true
Purefoy
nose
.
Young
hopeful
*NL*
will
be
christened
Mortimer
Edward
after
the
influential
third
cousin
of
*NL*
Mr
Purefoy
in
the
Treasury
Remembrancer
's
office
,
Dublin
Castle
.
And
so
*NL*
time
wags
on
:
but
father
Cronion
has
dealt
lightly
here
.
No
,
let
no
sigh
*NL*
break
from
that
bosom
,
dear
gentle
Mina
.
And
Doady
,
knock
the
ashes
from
*NL*
your
pipe
,
the
seasoned
briar
you
still
fancy
when
the
curfew
rings
for
*NL*
you
-LRB-
may
it
be
the
distant
day
!
-RRB-
and
dout
the
light
whereby
you
read
*NL*
in
the
Sacred
Book
for
the
oil
too
has
run
low
,
and
so
with
a
tranquil
*NL*
heart
to
bed
,
to
rest
.
He
knows
and
will
call
in
His
own
good
time
.
You
*NL*
too
have
fought
the
good
fight
and
played
loyally
your
man
's
part
.
Sir
,
*NL*
to
you
my
hand
.
Well
done
,
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
sins
or
-LRB-
let
us
call
them
as
the
world
calls
them
-RRB-
evil
*NL*
memories
which
are
hidden
away
by
man
in
the
darkest
places
of
the
heart
*NL*
but
they
abide
there
and
wait
.
He
may
suffer
their
memory
to
grow
dim
,
*NL*
let
them
be
as
though
they
had
not
been
and
all
but
persuade
himself
*NL*
that
they
were
not
or
at
least
were
otherwise
.
Yet
a
chance
word
will
*NL*
call
them
forth
suddenly
and
they
will
rise
up
to
confront
him
in
the
*NL*
most
various
circumstances
,
a
vision
or
a
dream
,
or
while
timbrel
*NL*
and
harp
soothe
his
senses
or
amid
the
cool
silver
tranquility
of
the
*NL*
evening
or
at
the
feast
,
at
midnight
,
when
he
is
now
filled
with
wine
.
*NL*
Not
to
insult
over
him
will
the
vision
come
as
over
one
that
lies
under
*NL*
her
wrath
,
not
for
vengeance
to
cut
him
off
from
the
living
but
shrouded
*NL*
in
the
piteous
vesture
of
the
past
,
silent
,
remote
,
reproachful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
still
regarded
on
the
face
before
him
a
slow
recession
of
*NL*
that
false
calm
there
,
imposed
,
as
it
seemed
,
by
habit
or
some
studied
*NL*
trick
,
upon
words
so
embittered
as
to
accuse
in
their
speaker
an
*NL*
unhealthiness
,
a
_
flair
,
_
for
the
cruder
things
of
life
.
A
scene
*NL*
disengages
itself
in
the
observer
's
memory
,
evoked
,
it
would
seem
,
by
*NL*
a
word
of
so
natural
a
homeliness
as
if
those
days
were
really
present
*NL*
there
-LRB-
as
some
thought
-RRB-
with
their
immediate
pleasures
.
A
shaven
space
*NL*
of
lawn
one
soft
May
evening
,
the
wellremembered
grove
of
lilacs
at
*NL*
Roundtown
,
purple
and
white
,
fragrant
slender
spectators
of
the
game
but
*NL*
with
much
real
interest
in
the
pellets
as
they
run
slowly
forward
over
*NL*
the
sward
or
collide
and
stop
,
one
by
its
fellow
,
with
a
brief
alert
*NL*
shock
.
And
yonder
about
that
grey
urn
where
the
water
moves
at
times
*NL*
in
thoughtful
irrigation
you
saw
another
as
fragrant
sisterhood
,
Floey
,
*NL*
Atty
,
Tiny
and
their
darker
friend
with
I
know
not
what
of
arresting
in
*NL*
her
pose
then
,
Our
Lady
of
the
Cherries
,
a
comely
brace
of
them
pendent
*NL*
from
an
ear
,
bringing
out
the
foreign
warmth
of
the
skin
so
daintily
*NL*
against
the
cool
ardent
fruit
.
A
lad
of
four
or
five
in
linseywoolsey
*NL*
-LRB-
blossomtime
but
there
will
be
cheer
in
the
kindly
hearth
when
ere
long
*NL*
the
bowls
are
gathered
and
hutched
-RRB-
is
standing
on
the
urn
secured
by
*NL*
that
circle
of
girlish
fond
hands
.
He
frowns
a
little
just
as
this
young
*NL*
man
does
now
with
a
perhaps
too
conscious
enjoyment
of
the
danger
but
*NL*
must
needs
glance
at
whiles
towards
where
his
mother
watches
from
the
*NL*
PIAZZETTA
giving
upon
the
flowerclose
with
a
faint
shadow
of
remoteness
*NL*
or
of
reproach
-LRB-
_
alles
Vergangliche
_
-RRB-
in
her
glad
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mark
this
farther
and
remember
.
The
end
comes
suddenly
.
Enter
that
*NL*
antechamber
of
birth
where
the
studious
are
assembled
and
note
their
*NL*
faces
.
Nothing
,
as
it
seems
,
there
of
rash
or
violent
.
Quietude
of
*NL*
custody
,
rather
,
befitting
their
station
in
that
house
,
the
vigilant
*NL*
watch
of
shepherds
and
of
angels
about
a
crib
in
Bethlehem
of
Juda
long
*NL*
ago
.
But
as
before
the
lightning
the
serried
stormclouds
,
heavy
with
*NL*
preponderant
excess
of
moisture
,
in
swollen
masses
turgidly
distended
,
*NL*
compass
earth
and
sky
in
one
vast
slumber
,
impending
above
parched
field
*NL*
and
drowsy
oxen
and
blighted
growth
of
shrub
and
verdure
till
in
an
*NL*
instant
a
flash
rives
their
centres
and
with
the
reverberation
of
the
*NL*
thunder
the
cloudburst
pours
its
torrent
,
so
and
not
otherwise
was
the
*NL*
transformation
,
violent
and
instantaneous
,
upon
the
utterance
of
the
*NL*
word
.

He

down

,
though
*NL*
branded
as

,
if

so

he

memory
of
the

in

purely
sisterly
way
and
return
to
*NL*
nature
as
a
purely

animal

A

child
,
he
had
been
*NL*
carefully
brought
up
and
nurtured
by
an
aged
bedridden
parent
.
There
*NL*
might
have
been
lapses

he
wanted

_
This
is
no
place
for
indecent
levity
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
an
erring
mortal
disguised
in
liquor
.
We
are
not
in
a
*NL*
beargarden
nor
at
an
Oxford
rag
nor
is
this
a
travesty
of
justice
.
My
*NL*
client
is
an
infant
,
a
poor
foreign
immigrant
who
started
scratch
as
*NL*
a
stowaway
and
is
now
trying
to
turn
an
honest
penny
.
The
trumped
up
*NL*
misdemeanour
was
due
to
a
momentary
aberration
of
heredity
,
brought
on
*NL*
by
hallucination
,
such
familiarities
as
the
alleged
guilty
occurrence
*NL*
being
quite
permitted
in
my
client
's
native
place
,
the
land
of
the
*NL*
Pharaoh
.
_
Prima
facie
_
,
I
put
it
to
you
that
there
was
no
attempt
at
*NL*
carnally
knowing
.
Intimacy
did
not
occur
and
the
offence
complained
of
*NL*
by
Driscoll
,
that
her
virtue
was
solicited
,
was
not
repeated
.
I
would
*NL*
deal
in
especial
with
atavism
.
There
have
been
cases
of
shipwreck
and
*NL*
somnambulism
in
my
client
's
family
.
If
the
accused
could
speak
he
could
*NL*
a
tale
unfold
--
one
of
the
strangest
that
have
ever
been
narrated
between
*NL*
the
covers
of
a
book
.
He
himself
,
my
lord
,
is
a
physical
wreck
from
*NL*
cobbler
's
weak
chest
.
His
submission
is
that
he
is
of
Mongolian
*NL*
extraction
and
irresponsible
for
his
actions
.

MRS
BELLINGHAM
:
He
addressed
me
in
several
handwritings
with
fulsome
*NL*
compliments
as
a
Venus
in
furs
and
alleged
profound
pity
for
my
*NL*
frostbound
coachman
Palmer
while
in
the
same
breath
he
expressed
himself
*NL*
as
envious
of
his
earflaps
and
fleecy
sheepskins
and
of
his
fortunate
*NL*
proximity
to
my
person
,
when
standing
behind
my
chair
wearing
my
livery
*NL*
and
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
Bellingham
escutcheon
garnished
sable
,
*NL*
a
buck
's
head
couped
or
.
He
lauded
almost
extravagantly
my
nether
*NL*
extremities
,
my
swelling
calves
in
silk
hose
drawn
up
to
the
limit
,
and
*NL*
eulogised
glowingly
my
other
hidden
treasures
in
priceless
lace
which
,
*NL*
he
said
,
he
could
conjure
up
.
He
urged
me
-LRB-
stating
that
he
felt
it
*NL*
his
mission
in
life
to
urge
me
-RRB-
to
defile
the
marriage
bed
,
to
commit
*NL*
adultery
at

observed
me

an
obscene

such

insulting

He
urged
me
*NL*
to

likewise

He
*NL*

an
unspeakable
manner

to
chastise
*NL*
him
as
he
richly
deserves

to

to
give

perversely

In

him

be
more

example

new

His
moral
nature

simple

lovable

*NL*
Many
have
found
him
a
dear
man

a

He
is
a
rather
quaint
*NL*
fellow
on
the
whole
,
coy
though
not
feebleminded
in
the
medical
sense

*NL*
He
has
written
a

beautiful
letter

a

to
the
court
*NL*
missionary
of

Reformed
Priests
'

Society
which
clears
up
*NL*

He
is
practically
a
total

I
can
affirm
that
*NL*
he
sleeps
on
a
straw
litter
and
eats
the
most
Spartan
food
,
cold
dried
*NL*
grocer

He
wears
a
hairshirt
of
pure
Irish
manufacture
winter
and
*NL*
summer
and
scourges
himself
every
Saturday
.
He
was
,
I
understand
,
at
one
*NL*
time
a
firstclass
misdemeanant
in
Glencree
reformatory
.
Another
report
*NL*
states
that
he
was

I
appeal

clemency

drinking
purposes
hit
upon
an
*NL*
expedient
by
suggesting
,
off
the
reel
,
the
propriety
of
the
cabman
's
*NL*
shelter
,
as
it
was
called
,
hardly
a
stonesthrow
away
near
Butt
bridge
*NL*
where
they
might
hit
upon
some
drinkables
in
the
shape
of
a
milk
and
*NL*
soda
or
a
mineral
.
But
how
to
get
there
was
the
rub
.
For
the
nonce
he
*NL*
was
rather
nonplussed
but
inasmuch
as
the
duty
plainly
devolved
upon
him
*NL*
to
take
some
measures
on
the
subject
he
pondered
suitable
ways
and
means
*NL*
during
which
Stephen
repeatedly
yawned
.
So
far
as
he
could
see
he
was
*NL*
rather
pale
in
the
face
so
that
it
occurred
to
him
as
highly
advisable
*NL*
to
get
a
conveyance
of
some
description
which
would
answer
in
their
*NL*
then
condition
,
both
of
them
being
e.d.ed
,
particularly
Stephen
,
always
*NL*
assuming
that
there
was
such
a
thing
to
be
found
.
Accordingly
after
a
*NL*
few
such
preliminaries
as
brushing
,
in
spite
of
his
having
forgotten
*NL*
to
take
up
his
rather
soapsuddy
handkerchief
after
it
had
done
yeoman
*NL*
service
in
the
shaving
line
,
they
both
walked
together
along
Beaver
*NL*
street
or
,
more
properly
,
lane
as
far
as
the
farrier
's
and
the
*NL*
distinctly
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
livery
stables
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Montgomery
street
where
they
made
tracks
to
the
left
from
thence
*NL*
debouching
into
Amiens
street
round
by
the
corner
of
Dan
Bergin
's
.
But
*NL*
as
he
confidently
anticipated
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
Jehu
plying
for
*NL*
hire
anywhere
to
be
seen
except
a
fourwheeler
,
probably
engaged
by
some
*NL*
fellows
inside
on
the
spree
,
outside
the
North
Star
hotel
and
there
was
*NL*
no
symptom
of
its
budging
a
quarter
of
an
inch
when
Mr
Bloom
,
who
was
*NL*
anything
but
a
professional
whistler
,
endeavoured
to
hail
it
by
emitting
*NL*
a
kind
of
a
whistle
,
holding
his
arms
arched
over
his
head
,
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
quandary
but
,
bringing
common
sense
to
bear
on
it
,
evidently
*NL*
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
foot
it
*NL*
which
they
accordingly
did
.
So
,
bevelling
around
by
Mullett
's
and
the
*NL*
Signal
House
which
they
shortly
reached
,
they
proceeded
perforce
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
Amiens
street
railway
terminus
,
Mr
Bloom
being
handicapped
*NL*
by
the
circumstance
that
one
of
the
back
buttons
of
his
trousers
had
,
*NL*
to
vary
the
timehonoured
adage
,
gone
the
way
of
all
buttons
though
,
*NL*
entering
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
,
he
heroically
made
*NL*
light
of
the
mischance
.
So
as
neither
of
them
were
particularly
pressed
*NL*
for
time
,
as
it
happened
,
and
the
temperature
refreshing
since
it
*NL*
cleared
up
after
the
recent
visitation
of
Jupiter
Pluvius
,
they
dandered
*NL*
along
past
by
where
the
empty
vehicle
was
waiting
without
a
fare
or
a
*NL*
jarvey
.
As
it
so
happened
a
Dublin
United
Tramways
Company
's
sandstrewer
*NL*
happened
to
be
returning
and
the
elder
man
recounted
to
his
companion
_
a
*NL*
propos
_
of
the
incident
his
own
truly
miraculous
escape
of
some
little
*NL*
while
back
.
They
passed
the
main
entrance
of
the
Great
Northern
railway
*NL*
station
,
the
starting
point
for
Belfast
,
where
of
course
all
traffic
was
*NL*
suspended
at
that
late
hour
and
passing
the
backdoor
of
the
morgue
*NL*
-LRB-
a
not
very
enticing
locality
,
not
to
say
gruesome
to
a
degree
,
more
*NL*
especially
at
night
-RRB-
ultimately
gained
the
Dock
Tavern
and
in
due
course
*NL*
turned
into
Store
street
,
famous
for
its
C
division
police
station
.
*NL*
Between
this
point
and
the
high
at
present
unlit
warehouses
of
Beresford
*NL*
place
Stephen
thought
to
think
of
Ibsen
,
associated
with
Baird
's
the
*NL*
stonecutter
's
in
his
mind
somehow
in
Talbot
place
,
first
turning
on
the
*NL*
right
,
while
the
other
who
was
acting
as
his
_
fidus
Achates
_
inhaled
*NL*
with
internal
satisfaction
the
smell
of
James
Rourke
's
city
bakery
,
*NL*
situated
quite
close
to
where
they
were
,
the
very
palatable
odour
indeed
*NL*
of
our
daily
bread
,
of
all
commodities
of
the
public
the
primary
and
*NL*
most
indispensable
.
Bread
,
the
staff
of
life
,
earn
your
bread
,
O
tell
me
*NL*
where
is
fancy
bread
,
at
Rourke
's
the
baker
's
it
is
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
En
route
_
to
his
taciturn
and
,
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
,
not
*NL*
yet
perfectly
sober
companion
Mr
Bloom
who
at
all
events
was
in
complete
*NL*
possession
of
his
faculties
,
never
more
so
,
in
fact
disgustingly
sober
,
*NL*
spoke
a
word
of
caution
re
the
dangers
of
nighttown
,
women
of
ill
fame
*NL*
and
swell
mobsmen
,
which
,
barely
permissible
once
in
a
while
though
not
*NL*
as
a
habitual
practice
,
was
of
the
nature
of
a
regular
deathtrap
for
*NL*
young
fellows
of
his
age
particularly
if
they
had
acquired
drinking
*NL*
habits
under
the
influence
of
liquor
unless
you
knew
a
little
jiujitsu
*NL*
for
every
contingency
as
even
a
fellow
on
the
broad
of
his
back
could
*NL*
administer
a
nasty
kick
if
you
did
n't
look
out
.
Highly
providential
*NL*
was
the
appearance
on
the
scene
of
Corny
Kelleher
when
Stephen
was
*NL*
blissfully
unconscious
but
for
that
man
in
the
gap
turning
up
at
the
*NL*
eleventh
hour
the
finis
might
have
been
that
he
might
have
been
a
*NL*
candidate
for
the
accident
ward
or
,
failing
that
,
the
bridewell
and
*NL*
an
appearance
in
the
court
next
day
before
Mr
Tobias
or
,
he
being
the
*NL*
solicitor
rather
,
old
Wall
,
he
meant
to
say
,
or
Mahony
which
simply
*NL*
spelt
ruin
for
a
chap
when
it
got
bruited
about
.
The
reason
he
mentioned
*NL*
the
fact
was
that
a
lot
of
those
policemen
,
whom
he
cordially
disliked
,
*NL*
were
admittedly
unscrupulous
in
the
service
of
the
Crown
and
,
as
Mr
*NL*
Bloom
put
it
,
recalling
a
case
or
two
in
the
A
division
in
Clanbrassil
*NL*
street
,
prepared
to
swear
a
hole
through
a
ten
gallon
pot
.
Never
on
*NL*
the
spot
when
wanted
but
in
quiet
parts
of
the
city
,
Pembroke
road
for
*NL*
example
,
the
*NL*
*NL*
guardians
of
the
law
were
well
in
evidence
,
the
obvious
reason
being
*NL*
they
were
paid
to
protect
the
upper
classes
.
Another
thing
he
commented
*NL*
on
was
equipping
soldiers
with
firearms
or
sidearms
of
any
description
*NL*
liable
to
go
off
at
any
time
which
was
tantamount
to
inciting
them
*NL*
against
civilians
should
by
any
chance
they
fall
out
over
anything
.
You
*NL*
frittered
away
your
time
,
he
very
sensibly
maintained
,
and
health
and
*NL*
also
character
besides
which
,
the
squandermania
of
the
thing
,
fast
women
*NL*
of
the
_
demimonde
_
ran
away
with
a
lot
of
l
s.
d.
into
the
bargain
and
*NL*
the
greatest
danger
of
all
was
who
you
got
drunk
with
though
,
touching
*NL*
the
much
vexed
question
of
stimulants
,
he
relished
a
glass
of
choice
old
*NL*
wine
in
season
as
both
*NL*
*NL*
nourishing
and
bloodmaking
and
possessing
aperient
virtues
-LRB-
notably
a
*NL*
good
burgundy
which
he
was
a
staunch
believer
in
-RRB-
still
never
beyond
*NL*
a
certain
point
where
he
invariably
drew
the
line
as
it
simply
led
to
*NL*
trouble
all
round
to
say
nothing
of
your
being
at
the
tender
mercy
of
*NL*
others
practically
.
Most
of
all
he
commented
adversely
on
the
desertion
*NL*
of
Stephen
by
all
his
pubhunting
_
confreres
_
but
one
,
a
most
glaring
*NL*
piece
of
ratting
on
the
part
of
his
brother
medicos
under
all
the
circs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
that
one
was
Judas
,
Stephen
said
,
who
up
to
then
had
said
nothing
*NL*
whatsoever
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Discussing
these
and
kindred
topics
they
made
a
beeline
across
the
back
*NL*
of
the
Customhouse
and
passed
under
the
Loop
Line
bridge
where
a
brazier
*NL*
of
coke
burning
in
front
of
a
sentrybox
or
something
like
one
attracted
*NL*
their
rather
lagging
footsteps
.
Stephen
of
his
own
accord
stopped
for
*NL*
no
special
reason
to
look
at
the
heap
of
barren
cobblestones
and
by
*NL*
the
light
emanating
from
the
brazier
he
could
just
make
out
the
darker
*NL*
figure
of
the
corporation
watchman
inside
the
gloom
of
the
sentrybox
.
He
*NL*
began
to
remember
that
this
had
happened
or
had
been
mentioned
as
having
*NL*
happened
before
but
it
cost
him
no
small
effort
before
he
remembered
*NL*
that
he
recognised
in
the
sentry
a
quondam
friend
of
his
father
's
,
*NL*
Gumley
.
To
avoid
a
meeting
he
drew
nearer
to
the
pillars
of
the
railway
*NL*
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Someone
saluted
you
,
Mr
Bloom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
figure
of
middle
height
on
the
prowl
evidently
under
the
arches
*NL*
saluted
again
,
calling
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Night
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
of
course
started
rather
dizzily
and
stopped
to
return
the
*NL*
compliment
.
Mr
Bloom
actuated
by
motives
of
inherent
delicacy
inasmuch
*NL*
as
he
always
believed
in
minding
his
own
business
moved
off
but
*NL*
nevertheless
remained
on
the
_
qui
vive
_
with
just
a
shade
of
anxiety
*NL*
though
not
funkyish
in
the
least
.
Though
unusual
in
the
Dublin
area
he
*NL*
knew
that
it
was
not
by
any
means
unknown
for
desperadoes
who
had
next
*NL*
to
nothing
to
live
on
to
be
abroad
waylaying
and
generally
terrorising
*NL*
peaceable
pedestrians
by
placing
a
pistol
at
their
head
in
some
*NL*
secluded
spot
outside
the
city
proper
,
famished
loiterers
of
the
*NL*
Thames
embankment
category
they
might
be
hanging
about
there
or
simply
*NL*
marauders
ready
to
decamp
with
whatever
boodle
they
could
in
one
fell
*NL*
swoop
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
your
money
or
your
life
,
leaving
you
there
*NL*
to
point
a
moral
,
gagged
and
garrotted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
that
is
when
the
accosting
figure
came
to
close
quarters
,
*NL*
though
he
was
not
in
an
over
sober
state
himself
recognised
Corley
's
*NL*
breath
redolent
of
rotten
cornjuice
.
Lord
John
Corley
some
called
him
*NL*
and
his
genealogy
came
about
in
this
wise
.
He
was
the
eldest
son
of
*NL*
inspector
Corley
of
the
G
division
,
lately
deceased
,
who
had
married
*NL*
a
certain
Katherine
Brophy
,
the
daughter
of
a
Louth
farmer
.
His
*NL*
grandfather
Patrick
Michael
Corley
of
New
Ross
had
married
the
widow
*NL*
of
a
publican
there
whose
maiden
name
had
been
Katherine
-LRB-
also
-RRB-
Talbot
.
*NL*
Rumour
had
it
-LRB-
though
not
proved
-RRB-
that
she
descended
from
the
house
of
*NL*
the
lords
Talbot
de
Malahide
in
whose
mansion
,
really
an
unquestionably
*NL*
fine
residence
of
its
kind
and
well
worth
seeing
,
her
mother
or
aunt
or
*NL*
some
relative
,
a
woman
,
as
the
tale
went
,
of
extreme
beauty
,
had
enjoyed
*NL*
the
distinction
of
being
in
service
in
the
washkitchen
.
This
therefore
*NL*
was
the
reason
why
the
still
comparatively
young
though
dissolute
*NL*
man
who
now
addressed
Stephen
was
spoken
of
by
some
with
facetious
*NL*
proclivities
as
Lord
John
Corley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
Stephen
on
one
side
he
had
the
customary
doleful
ditty
to
tell
.
*NL*
Not
as
much
as
a
farthing
to
purchase
a
night
's
lodgings
.
His
friends
*NL*
had
all
deserted
him
.
Furthermore
he
had
a
row
with
Lenehan
and
called
*NL*
him
to
Stephen
a
mean
bloody
swab
with
a
sprinkling
of
a
number
of
other
*NL*
uncalledfor
expressions
.
He
was
out
of
a
job
and
implored
of
Stephen
to
*NL*
tell
him
where
on
God
's
earth
he
could
get
something
,
anything
at
all
,
*NL*
to
do
.
No
,
it
was
the
daughter
of
the
mother
in
the
washkitchen
that
*NL*
was
fostersister
to
the
heir
of
the
house
or
else
they
were
connected
*NL*
through
the
mother
in
some
way
,
both
occurrences
happening
at
the
same
*NL*
time
if
the
whole
thing
was
n't
a
complete
fabrication
from
start
to
*NL*
finish
.
Anyhow
he
was
all
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
n't
ask
you
only
,
pursued
he
,
on
my
solemn
oath
and
God
knows
*NL*
I
'm
on
the
rocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
'll
be
a
job
tomorrow
or
next
day
,
Stephen
told
him
,
in
a
boys
'
*NL*
school
at
Dalkey
for
a
gentleman
usher
.
Mr
Garrett
Deasy
.
Try
it
.
You
*NL*
may
mention
my
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
God
,
Corley
replied
,
sure
I
could
n't
teach
in
a
school
,
man
.
I
was
*NL*
never
one
of
your
bright
ones
,
he
added
with
a
half
laugh
.
I
got
stuck
*NL*
twice
in
the
junior
at
the
christian
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
no
place
to
sleep
myself
,
Stephen
informed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corley
at
the
first
go-off
was
inclined
to
suspect
it
was
something
to
*NL*
do
with
Stephen
being
fired
out
of
his
digs
for
bringing
in
a
bloody
*NL*
tart
off
the
street
.
There
was
a
dosshouse
in
Marlborough
street
,
Mrs
*NL*
Maloney
's
,
but
it
was
only
a
tanner
touch
and
full
of
undesirables
but
*NL*
M'Conachie
told
him
you
got
a
decent
enough
do
in
the
Brazen
Head
over
*NL*
in
Winetavern
street
-LRB-
which
was
distantly
suggestive
to
the
person
*NL*
addressed
of
friar
Bacon
-RRB-
for
a
bob
.
He
was
starving
too
though
he
*NL*
had
n't
said
a
word
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
every
other
night
or
very
near
it
*NL*
still
Stephen
's
feelings
got
the
better
of
him
in
a
sense
though
he
knew
*NL*
that
Corley
's
brandnew
rigmarole
on
a
par
with
the
others
was
hardly
*NL*
deserving
of
much
credence
.
However
_
haud
ignarus
malorum
miseris
*NL*
succurrere
disco
_
etcetera
as
the
Latin
poet
remarks
especially
as
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
he
got
paid
his
screw
after
every
middle
of
the
month
on
*NL*
the
sixteenth
which
was
the
date
of
the
month
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
*NL*
a
good
bit
of
the
wherewithal
was
demolished
.
But
the
cream
of
the
joke
*NL*
was
nothing
would
get
it
out
of
Corley
's
head
that
he
was
living
in
*NL*
affluence
and
had
n't
a
thing
to
do
but
hand
out
the
needful
.
Whereas
.
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
in
a
pocket
anyhow
not
with
the
idea
of
finding
any
food
*NL*
there
but
thinking
he
might
lend
him
anything
up
to
a
bob
or
so
in
lieu
*NL*
so
that
he
might
endeavour
at
all
events
and
get
sufficient
to
eat
but
*NL*
the
result
was
in
the
negative
for
,
to
his
chagrin
,
he
found
his
cash
*NL*
missing
.
A
few
broken
biscuits
were
all
the
result
of
his
investigation
.
*NL*
He
tried
his
hardest
to
recollect
for
the
moment
whether
he
had
lost
*NL*
as
well
he
might
have
or
left
because
in
that
contingency
it
was
not
a
*NL*
pleasant
lookout
,
very
much
the
reverse
in
fact
.
He
was
altogether
too
*NL*
fagged
out
to
institute
a
thorough
search
though
he
tried
to
recollect
.
*NL*
About
biscuits
he
dimly
remembered
.
Who
now
exactly
gave
them
he
*NL*
wondered
or
where
was
or
did
he
buy
.
However
in
another
pocket
he
came
*NL*
across
what
he
surmised
in
the
dark
were
pennies
,
erroneously
however
,
*NL*
as
it
turned
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Those
are
halfcrowns
,
man
,
Corley
corrected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
in
point
of
fact
they
turned
out
to
be
.
Stephen
anyhow
lent
him
*NL*
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thanks
,
Corley
answered
,
you
're
a
gentleman
.
I
'll
pay
you
back
one
*NL*
time
.
Who
's
that
with
you
?
I
saw
him
a
few
times
in
the
Bleeding
Horse
*NL*
in
Camden
street
with
Boylan
,
the
billsticker
.
You
might
put
in
a
good
*NL*
word
for
us
to
get
me
taken
on
there
.
I
'd
carry
a
sandwichboard
only
*NL*
the
girl
in
the
office
told
me
they
're
full
up
for
the
next
three
weeks
,
*NL*
man
.
God
,
you
've
to
book
ahead
,
man
,
you
'd
think
it
was
for
the
Carl
*NL*
Rosa
.
I
do
n't
give
a
shite
anyway
so
long
as
I
get
a
job
,
even
as
a
*NL*
crossing
sweeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Subsequently
being
not
quite
so
down
in
the
mouth
after
the
two
and
six
*NL*
he
got
he
informed
Stephen
about
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
Bags
Comisky
*NL*
that
he
said
Stephen
knew
well
out
of
Fullam
's
,
the
shipchandler
's
,
*NL*
bookkeeper
there
that
used
to
be
often
round
in
Nagle
's
back
with
O'Mara
*NL*
and
a
little
chap
with
a
stutter
the
name
of
Tighe
.
Anyhow
he
was
lagged
*NL*
the
night
before
last
and
fined
ten
bob
for
a
drunk
and
disorderly
and
*NL*
refusing
to
go
with
the
constable
.
*NL*
*NL*
210
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
in
the
meanwhile
kept
dodging
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
cobblestones
near
the
brazier
of
coke
in
front
of
the
corporation
*NL*
watchman
's
sentrybox
who
evidently
a
glutton
for
work
,
it
struck
him
,
*NL*
was
having
a
quiet
forty
winks
for
all
intents
and
purposes
on
his
own
*NL*
private
account
while
Dublin
slept
.
He
threw
an
odd
eye
at
the
same
time
*NL*
now
and
then
at
Stephen
's
anything
but
immaculately
attired
interlocutor
*NL*
as
if
he
had
seen
that
nobleman
somewhere
or
other
though
where
he
was
*NL*
not
in
a
position
to
truthfully
state
nor
had
he
the
remotest
idea
when
.
*NL*
Being
a
levelheaded
individual
who
could
give
points
to
not
a
few
in
*NL*
point
of
shrewd
observation
he
also
remarked
on
his
very
dilapidated
*NL*
hat
and
slouchy
wearing
apparel
generally
testifying
to
a
chronic
*NL*
impecuniosity
.
Palpably
he
was
one
of
his
hangerson
but
for
the
*NL*
matter
of
that
it
was
merely
a
question
of
one
preying
on
his
nextdoor
*NL*
neighbour
all
round
,
in
every
deep
,
so
to
put
it
,
a
deeper
depth
and
for
*NL*
the
matter
of
that
if
the
man
in
the
street
chanced
to
be
in
the
dock
*NL*
himself
penal
servitude
with
or
without
the
option
of
a
fine
would
be
*NL*
a
very
rara
avis
altogether
.
In
any
case
he
had
a
consummate
amount
of
*NL*
cool
assurance
intercepting
people
at
that
hour
of
the
night
or
morning
.
*NL*
Pretty
thick
that
was
certainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pair
parted
company
and
Stephen
rejoined
Mr
Bloom
who
,
with
his
*NL*
practised
eye
,
was
not
without
perceiving
that
he
had
succumbed
to
the
*NL*
blandiloquence
of
the
other
parasite
.
Alluding
to
the
encounter
he
said
,
*NL*
laughingly
,
Stephen
,
that
is
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
down
on
his
luck
.
He
asked
me
to
ask
you
to
ask
somebody
named
*NL*
Boylan
,
a
billsticker
,
to
give
him
a
job
as
a
sandwichman
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
intelligence
,
in
which
he
seemingly
evinced
little
interest
,
Mr
*NL*
Bloom
gazed
abstractedly
for
the
space
of
a
half
a
second
or
so
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
a
bucketdredger
,
rejoicing
in
the
farfamed
name
of
Eblana
,
*NL*
moored
alongside
Customhouse
quay
and
quite
possibly
out
of
repair
,
*NL*
whereupon
he
observed
evasively
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Everybody
gets
their
own
ration
of
luck
,
they
say
.
Now
you
mention
it
*NL*
his
face
was
familiar
to
me
.
But
,
leaving
that
for
the
moment
,
how
much
*NL*
did
you
part
with
,
he
queried
,
if
I
am
not
too
inquisitive
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Half
a
crown
,
Stephen
responded
.
I
daresay
he
needs
it
to
sleep
*NL*
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Needs
!
Mr
Bloom
ejaculated
,
professing
not
the
least
surprise
at
*NL*
the
intelligence
,
I
can
quite
credit
the
assertion
and
I
guarantee
he
*NL*
invariably
does
.
Everyone
according
to
his
needs
or
everyone
according
*NL*
to
his
deeds
.
But
,
talking
about
things
in
general
,
where
,
added
he
with
*NL*
a
smile
,
will
you
sleep
yourself
?
Walking
to
Sandycove
is
out
of
*NL*
the
question
.
And
even
supposing
you
did
you
wo
n't
get
in
after
what
*NL*
occurred
at
Westland
Row
station
.
Simply
fag
out
there
for
nothing
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
presume
to
dictate
to
you
in
the
slightest
degree
but
why
*NL*
did
you
leave
your
father
's
house
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
seek
misfortune
,
was
Stephen
's
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
met
your
respected
father
on
a
recent
occasion
,
Mr
Bloom
*NL*
diplomatically
returned
,
today
in
fact
,
or
to
be
strictly
accurate
,
on
*NL*
yesterday
.
Where
does
he
live
at
present
?
I
gathered
in
the
course
of
*NL*
conversation
that
he
had
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
believe
he
is
in
Dublin
somewhere
,
Stephen
answered
unconcernedly
.
*NL*
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
gifted
man
,
Mr
Bloom
said
of
Mr
Dedalus
senior
,
in
more
respects
*NL*
than
one
and
a
born
_
raconteur
_
if
ever
there
was
one
.
He
takes
great
*NL*
pride
,
quite
legitimate
,
out
of
you
.
You
could
go
back
perhaps
,
he
*NL*
hasarded
,
still
thinking
of
the
very
unpleasant
scene
at
Westland
Row
*NL*
terminus
when
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
other
two
,
Mulligan
,
*NL*
that
is
,
and
that
English
tourist
friend
of
his
,
who
eventually
euchred
*NL*
their
third
companion
,
were
patently
trying
as
if
the
whole
bally
*NL*
station
belonged
to
them
to
give
Stephen
the
slip
in
the
confusion
,
*NL*
which
they
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
response
forthcoming
to
the
suggestion
however
,
such
as
it
*NL*
was
,
Stephen
's
mind
's
eye
being
too
busily
engaged
in
repicturing
his
*NL*
family
hearth
the
last
time
he
saw
it
with
his
sister
Dilly
sitting
by
*NL*
the
ingle
,
her
hair
hanging
down
,
waiting
for
some
weak
Trinidad
shell
*NL*
cocoa
that
was
in
the
sootcoated
kettle
to
be
done
so
that
she
and
he
*NL*
could
drink
it
with
the
oatmealwater
for
milk
after
the
Friday
herrings
*NL*
they
had
eaten
at
two
a
penny
with
an
egg
apiece
for
Maggy
,
Boody
and
*NL*
Katey
,
the
cat
meanwhile
under
the
mangle
devouring
a
mess
of
eggshells
*NL*
and
charred
fish
heads
and
bones
on
a
square
of
brown
paper
,
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
third
precept
of
the
church
to
fast
and
abstain
*NL*
on
the
days
commanded
,
it
being
quarter
tense
or
if
not
,
ember
days
or
*NL*
something
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
Mr
Bloom
repeated
again
,
I
would
n't
personally
repose
much
trust
*NL*
in
that
boon
companion
of
yours
who
contributes
the
humorous
element
,
Dr
*NL*
Mulligan
,
as
a
guide
,
philosopher
and
friend
if
I
were
in
your
shoes
.
He
*NL*
knows
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
on
though
in
all
probability
he
*NL*
never
realised
what
it
is
to
be
without
regular
meals
.
Of
course
you
*NL*
did
n't
notice
as
much
as
I
did
.
But
it
would
n't
occasion
me
the
least
*NL*
surprise
to
learn
that
a
pinch
of
tobacco
or
some
narcotic
was
put
in
*NL*
your
drink
for
some
ulterior
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
however
from
all
he
heard
that
Dr
Mulligan
was
a
versatile
*NL*
allround
man
,
by
no
means
confined
to
medicine
only
,
who
was
rapidly
*NL*
coming
to
the
fore
in
his
line
and
,
if
the
report
was
verified
,
bade
*NL*
fair
to
enjoy
a
flourishing
practice
in
the
not
too
distant
future
as
*NL*
a
tony
medical
practitioner
drawing
a
handsome
fee
for
his
services
*NL*
in
addition
to
which
professional
status
his
rescue
of
that
man
from
*NL*
certain
drowning
by
artificial
respiration
and
what
they
call
first
*NL*
aid
at
Skerries
,
or
Malahide
was
it
?
,
was
,
he
was
bound
to
admit
,
an
*NL*
exceedingly
plucky
deed
which
he
could
not
too
highly
praise
,
so
that
*NL*
frankly
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
fathom
what
earthly
reason
could
be
*NL*
at
the
back
of
it
except
he
put
it
down
to
sheer
cussedness
or
jealousy
,
*NL*
pure
and
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Except
it
simply
amounts
to
one
thing
and
he
is
what
they
call
picking
*NL*
your
brains
,
he
ventured
to
throw
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guarded
glance
of
half
solicitude
half
curiosity
augmented
by
*NL*
friendliness
which
he
gave
at
Stephen
's
at
present
morose
expression
*NL*
of
features
did
not
throw
a
flood
of
light
,
none
at
all
in
fact
on
the
*NL*
problem
as
to
whether
he
had
let
himself
be
badly
bamboozled
to
judge
by
*NL*
two
or
three
lowspirited
remarks
he
let
drop
or
the
other
way
about
saw
*NL*
through
the
affair
and
for
some
reason
or
other
best
known
to
himself
*NL*
allowed
matters
to
more
or
less
.
Grinding
poverty
did
have
that
effect
*NL*
and
he
more
than
conjectured
that
,
high
educational
abilities
though
he
*NL*
possessed
,
he
experienced
no
little
difficulty
in
making
both
ends
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adjacent
to
the
men
's
public
urinal
they
perceived
an
icecream
car
round
*NL*
which
a
group
of
presumably
Italians
in
heated
altercation
were
getting
*NL*
rid
of
voluble
expressions
in
their
vivacious
language
in
a
particularly
*NL*
animated
way
,
there
being
some
little
differences
between
the
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
--

*NL*
Mr
Bloom
and
Stephen
entered
the
cabman
's
shelter
,
an
unpretentious
*NL*
wooden
structure
,
where
,
prior
to
then
,
he
had
rarely
if
ever
been
*NL*
before
,
the
former
having
previously
whispered
to
the
latter
a
few
*NL*
hints
anent
the
keeper
of
it
said
to
be
the
once
famous
Skin-the-Goat
*NL*
Fitzharris
,
the
invincible
,
though
he
could
not
vouch
for
the
actual
*NL*
facts
which
quite
possibly
there
was
not
one
vestige
of
truth
in
.
A
few
*NL*
moments
later
saw
our
two
noctambules
safely
seated
in
a
discreet
corner
*NL*
only
to
be
greeted
by
stares
from
the
decidedly
miscellaneous
collection
*NL*
of
waifs
and
strays
and
other
nondescript
specimens
of
the
genus
_
homo
_
*NL*
already
there
engaged
in
eating
and
drinking
diversified
by
conversation
*NL*
for
whom
they
seemingly
formed
an
object
of
marked
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
touching
a
cup
of
coffee
,
Mr
Bloom
ventured
to
plausibly
suggest
*NL*
to
break
the
ice
,
it
occurs
to
me
you
ought
to
sample
something
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
solid
food
,
say
,
a
roll
of
some
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
his
first
act
was
with
characteristic
_
sangfroid
_
to
order
*NL*
these
commodities
quietly
.
The
_
hoi
polloi
_
of
jarvies
or
stevedores
*NL*
or
whatever
they
were
after
a
cursory
examination
turned
their
eyes
*NL*
apparently
dissatisfied
,
away
though
one
redbearded
bibulous
individual
*NL*
portion
of
whose
hair
was
greyish
,
a
sailor
probably
,
still
stared
for
*NL*
some
appreciable
time
before
transferring
his
rapt
attention
to
the
*NL*
floor
.
Mr
Bloom
,
availing
himself
of
the
right
of
free
speech
,
he
having
*NL*
just
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
language
in
dispute
,
though
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
rather
in
a
quandary
over
_
voglio
_
,
remarked
to
his
_
protege
_
in
*NL*
an
audible
tone
of
voice
_
a
propos
_
of
the
battle
royal
in
the
street
*NL*
which
was
still
raging
fast
and
furious
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
beautiful
language
.
I
mean
for
singing
purposes
.
Why
do
you
not
*NL*
write
your
poetry
in
that
language
?
_
Bella
Poetria
_
!
It
is
so
melodious
*NL*
and
full
.
_
Belladonna

Voglio

*NL*
Stephen
,
who
was
trying
his
dead
best
to
yawn
if
he
could
,
suffering
*NL*
from
lassitude
generally
,
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
fill
the
ear
of
a
cow
elephant
.
They
were
haggling
over
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Is
that
so
?
Mr
Bloom
asked
.
Of
course
,
he
subjoined
pensively
,
at
the
*NL*
inward
reflection
of
there
being
more
languages
to
start
with
than
were
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
,
it
may
be
only
the
southern
glamour
that
surrounds
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
keeper
of
the
shelter
in
the
middle
of
this
_
tete-a-tete
_
put
a
*NL*
boiling
swimming
cup
of
a
choice
concoction
labelled
coffee
on
the
table
*NL*
and
a
rather
antediluvian
specimen
of
a
bun
,
or
so
it
seemed
.
After
*NL*
which
he
beat
a
retreat
to
his
counter
,
Mr
Bloom
determining
to
have
*NL*
a
good
square
look
at
him
later
on
so
as
not
to
appear
to
.
For
which
*NL*
reason
he
encouraged
Stephen
to
proceed
with
his
eyes
while
he
did
*NL*
the
honours
by
surreptitiously
pushing
the
cup
of
what
was
temporarily
*NL*
supposed
to
be
called
coffee
gradually
nearer
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Sounds
are
impostures
,
Stephen
said
after
a
pause
of
some
little
time
,
*NL*
like
names
.
Cicero
,
Podmore
.
Napoleon
,
Mr
Goodbody
.
Jesus
,
Mr
Doyle
.
*NL*
Shakespeares
were
as
common
as
Murphies
.
What
's
in
a
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
Mr
Bloom
unaffectedly
concurred
.
Of
course
.
Our
name
*NL*
was
changed
too
,
he
added
,
pushing
the
socalled
roll
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
redbearded
sailor
who
had
his
weather
eye
on
the
newcomers
boarded
*NL*
Stephen
,
whom
he
had
singled
out
for
attention
in
particular
,
squarely
*NL*
by
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
might
your
name
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
Just
in
the
nick
of
time
Mr
Bloom
touched
his
companion
's
boot
but
*NL*
Stephen
,
apparently
disregarding
the
warm
pressure
from
an
unexpected
*NL*
quarter
,
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Dedalus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
stared
at
him
heavily
from
a
pair
of
drowsy
baggy
eyes
,
*NL*
rather
bunged
up
from
excessive
use
of
boose
,
preferably
good
old
*NL*
Hollands
and
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
know
Simon
Dedalus
?
he
asked
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
've
heard
of
him
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
was
all
at
sea
for
a
moment
,
seeing
the
others
evidently
*NL*
eavesdropping
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
's
Irish
,
the
seaman
bold
affirmed
,
staring
still
in
much
the
same
*NL*
way
and
nodding
.
All
Irish
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
All
too
Irish
,
Stephen
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Mr
Bloom
he
could
neither
make
head
or
tail
of
the
whole
business
*NL*
and
he
was
just
asking
himself
what
possible
connection
when
the
sailor
*NL*
of
his
own
accord
turned
to
the
other
occupants
of
the
shelter
with
the
*NL*
remark
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
seen
him
shoot
two
eggs
off
two
bottles
at
fifty
yards
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
The
lefthand
dead
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
slightly
hampered
by
an
occasional
stammer
and
his
*NL*
gestures
being
also
clumsy
as
it
was
still
he
did
his
best
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Bottles
out
there
,
say
.
Fifty
yards
measured
.
Eggs
on
the
bottles
.
*NL*
Cocks
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
.
Aims
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
body
half
round
,
shut
up
his
right
eye
completely
.
Then
he
*NL*
screwed
his
features
up
someway
sideways
and
glared
out
into
the
night
*NL*
with
an
unprepossessing
cast
of
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pom
!
he
then
shouted
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entire
audience
waited
,
anticipating
an
additional
detonation
,
there
*NL*
being
still
a
further
egg
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pom
!
he
shouted
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Egg
two
evidently
demolished
,
he
nodded
and
winked
,
adding
*NL*
bloodthirstily
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Buffalo
Bill
shoots
to
kill
,
Never
missed
nor
he
never
will
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
ensued
till
Mr
Bloom
for
agreeableness
'
sake
just
felt
like
*NL*
asking
him
whether
it
was
for
a
marksmanship
competition
like
the
*NL*
Bisley
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Beg
pardon
,
the
sailor
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Long
ago
?
Mr
Bloom
pursued
without
flinching
a
hairsbreadth
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
the
sailor
replied
,
relaxing
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
magic
*NL*
influence
of
diamond
cut
diamond
,
it
might
be
a
matter
of
ten
years
.
He
*NL*
toured
the
wide
world
with
Hengler
's
Royal
Circus
.
I
seen
him
do
that
in
*NL*
Stockholm
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Curious
coincidence
,
Mr
Bloom
confided
to
Stephen
unobtrusively
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Murphy
's
my
name
,
the
sailor
continued
.
D.
B.
Murphy
of
Carrigaloe
.
*NL*
Know
where
that
is
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
Queenstown
harbour
,
Stephen
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
right
,
the
sailor
said
.
Fort
Camden
and
Fort
Carlisle
.
That
's
*NL*
where
I
hails
from
.
I
belongs
there
.
That
's
where
I
hails
from
.
My
*NL*
little
woman
's
down
there
.
She
's
waiting
for
me
,
I
know
.
_
For
England
,
*NL*
home
and
beauty
_
.
She
's
my
own
true
wife
I
have
n't
seen
for
seven
years
*NL*
now
,
sailing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
could
easily
picture
his
advent
on
this
scene
,
the
homecoming
*NL*
to
the
mariner
's
roadside
shieling
after
having
diddled
Davy
Jones
,
*NL*
a
rainy
night
with
a
blind
moon
.
Across
the
world
for
a
wife
.
Quite
a
*NL*
number
of
stories
there
were
on
that
particular
Alice
Ben
Bolt
topic
,
*NL*
Enoch
Arden
and
Rip
van
Winkle
and
does
anybody
hereabouts
remember
Caoc
*NL*
O'Leary
,
a
favourite
and
most
trying
declamation
piece
by
the
way
of
*NL*
poor
John
Casey
and
a
bit
of
perfect
poetry
in
its
own
small
way
.
*NL*
Never
about
the
runaway
wife
coming
back
,
however
much
devoted
to
the
*NL*
absentee
.
The
face
at
the
window
!
Judge
of
his
astonishment
when
he
*NL*
finally
did
breast
the
tape
and
the
awful
truth
dawned
upon
him
anent
*NL*
his
better
half
,
wrecked
in
his
affections
.
You
little
expected
me
but
*NL*
I
've
come
to
stay
and
make
a
fresh
start
.
There
she
sits
,
a
grasswidow
,
*NL*
at
the
selfsame
fireside
.
Believes
me
dead
,
rocked
in
the
cradle
of
the
*NL*
deep
.
And
there
sits
uncle
Chubb
or
Tomkin
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
the
*NL*
publican
of
the
Crown
and
Anchor
,
in
shirtsleeves
,
eating
rumpsteak
and
*NL*
onions
.
No
chair
for
father
.
Broo
!
The
wind
!
Her
brandnew
arrival
is
on
*NL*
her
knee
,
_
post
mortem
_
child
.
With
a
high
ro
!
and
a
randy
ro
!
and
my
*NL*
galloping
tearing
tandy
,
O
!
Bow
to
the
inevitable
.
Grin
and
bear
it
.
I
*NL*
remain
with
much
love
your
brokenhearted
husband
D
B
Murphy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
,
who
scarcely
seemed
to
be
a
Dublin
resident
,
turned
to
one
*NL*
of
the
jarvies
with
the
request
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
do
n't
happen
to
have
such
a
thing
as
a
spare
chaw
about
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
jarvey
addressed
as
it
happened
had
not
but
the
keeper
took
a
die
of
*NL*
plug
from
his
good
jacket
hanging
on
a
nail
and
the
desired
object
was
*NL*
passed
from
hand
to
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thank
you
,
the
sailor
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
deposited
the
quid
in
his
gob
and
,
chewing
and
with
some
slow
*NL*
stammers
,
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
come
up
this
morning
eleven
o'clock
.
The
threemaster
_
Rosevean
_
*NL*
from
Bridgwater
with
bricks
.
I
shipped
to
get
over
.
Paid
off
this
*NL*
afternoon
.
There
's
my
discharge
.
See
?
D.
B.
Murphy

A.
B.
S
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
confirmation
of
which
statement
he
extricated
from
an
inside
pocket
*NL*
and
handed
to
his
neighbour
a
not
very
cleanlooking
folded
document
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
must
have
seen
a
fair
share
of
the
world
,
the
keeper
remarked
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
the
sailor
answered
upon
reflection
upon
it
,
I
've
circumnavigated
*NL*
a
bit
since
I
first
joined
on
.
I
was
in
the
Red
Sea
.
I
was
in
China
and
*NL*
North
America
and
South
America
.
We
was
chased
by
pirates
one
voyage
.
*NL*
I
seen
icebergs
plenty
,
growlers
.
I
was
in
Stockholm
and
the
Black
Sea
,
*NL*
the
Dardanelles
under
Captain
Dalton
,
the
best
bloody
man
that
ever
*NL*
scuttled
a
ship
.
I
seen
Russia
.
_
Gospodi
pomilyou
_
.
That
's
how
the
*NL*
Russians
prays
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
seen
queer
sights
,
do
n't
be
talking
,
put
in
a
jarvey
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
the
sailor
said
,
shifting
his
partially
chewed
plug
.
I
seen
*NL*
queer
things
too
,
ups
and
downs
.
I
seen
a
crocodile
bite
the
fluke
of
an
*NL*
anchor
same
as
I
chew
that
quid
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
out
of
his
mouth
the
pulpy
quid
and
,
lodging
it
between
his
*NL*
teeth
,
bit
ferociously
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Khaan
!
Like
that
.
And
I
seen
maneaters
in
Peru
that
eats
corpses
and
*NL*
the
livers
of
horses
.
Look
here
.
Here
they
are
.
A
friend
of
mine
sent
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumbled
out
a
picture
postcard
from
his
inside
pocket
which
seemed
to
*NL*
be
in
its
way
a
species
of
repository
and
pushed
it
along
the
table
.
The
*NL*
printed
matter
on
it
stated
:
_
Choza
de
Indios
.
Beni
,
Bolivia
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
All
focussed
their
attention
at
the
scene
exhibited
,
a
group
of
savage
*NL*
women
in
striped
loincloths
,
squatted
,
blinking
,
suckling
,
frowning
,
*NL*
sleeping
amid
a
swarm
of
infants
-LRB-
there
must
have
been
quite
a
score
of
*NL*
them
-RRB-
outside
some
primitive
shanties
of
osier
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Chews
coca
all
day
,
the
communicative
tarpaulin
added
.
Stomachs
*NL*
like
breadgraters
.
Cuts
off
their
diddies
when
they
ca
n't
bear
no
more
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
See
them
sitting
there
stark
ballocknaked
eating
a
dead
horse
's
liver
*NL*
raw
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
postcard
proved
a
centre
of
attraction
for
Messrs
the
greenhorns
for
*NL*
several
minutes
if
not
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Know
how
to
keep
them
off
?
he
inquired
generally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
volunteering
a
statement
he
winked
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Glass
.
That
boggles
'em
.
Glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
,
without
evincing
surprise
,
unostentatiously
turned
over
the
*NL*
card
to
peruse
the
partially
obliterated
address
and
postmark
.
It
ran
*NL*
as
follows
:
_
Tarjeta
Postal
,
Senor
A
Boudin
,
Galeria
Becche
,
Santiago
,
*NL*
Chile
.
_
There
was
no
message
evidently
,
as
he
took
particular
notice
.
*NL*
Though
not
an
implicit
believer
in
the
lurid
story
narrated
-LRB-
or
the
*NL*
eggsniping
transaction
for
that
matter
despite
William
Tell
and
the
*NL*
Lazarillo-Don
Cesar
de
Bazan
incident
depicted
in
_
Maritana
_
on
which
*NL*
occasion
the
former
's
ball
passed
through
the
latter
's
hat
-RRB-
having
*NL*
detected
a
discrepancy
between
his
name
-LRB-
assuming
he
was
the
person
*NL*
he
represented
himself
to
be
and
not
sailing
under
false
colours
*NL*
after
having
boxed
the
compass
on
the
strict
q.t.
somewhere
-RRB-
and
*NL*
the
fictitious
addressee
of
the
missive
which
made
him
nourish
some
*NL*
suspicions
of
our
friend
's
_
bona
fides
_
nevertheless
it
reminded
him
in
*NL*
a
way
of
a
longcherished
plan
he
meant
to
one
day
realise
some
Wednesday
*NL*
or
Saturday
of
travelling
to
London
via
long
sea
not
to
say
that
he
had
*NL*
ever
travelled
extensively
to
any
great
extent
but
he
was
at
heart
a
*NL*
born
adventurer
though
by
a
trick
of
fate
he
had
consistently
remained
*NL*
a
landlubber
except
you
call
going
to
Holyhead
which
was
his
longest
.
*NL*
Martin
Cunningham
frequently
said
he
would
work
a
pass
through
Egan
but
*NL*
some
deuced
hitch
or
other
eternally
cropped
up
with
the
net
result
that
*NL*
the
scheme
fell
through
.
But
even
suppose
it
did
come
to
planking
*NL*
down
the
needful
and
breaking
Boyd
's
heart
it
was
not
so
dear
,
purse
*NL*
permitting
,
a
few
guineas
at
the
outside
considering
the
fare
to
*NL*
Mullingar
where
he
figured
on
going
was
five
and
six
,
there
and
back
.
*NL*
The
trip
would
benefit
health
on
account
of
the
bracing
ozone
and
be
in
*NL*
every
way
thoroughly
pleasurable
,
especially
for
a
chap
whose
liver
was
*NL*
out
of
order
,
seeing
the
different
places
along
the
route
,
Plymouth
,
*NL*
Falmouth
,
Southampton
and
so
on
culminating
in
an
instructive
tour
of
*NL*
the
sights
of
the
great
metropolis
,
the
spectacle
of
our
modern
Babylon
*NL*
where
doubtless
he
would
see
the
greatest
improvement
,
tower
,
abbey
,
*NL*
wealth
of
Park
lane
to
renew
acquaintance
with
.
Another
thing
just
*NL*
struck
him
as
a
by
no
means
bad
notion
was
he
might
have
a
gaze
around
*NL*
on
the
spot
to
see
about
trying
to
make
arrangements
about
a
concert
*NL*
tour
of
summer
music
embracing
the
most
prominent
pleasure
resorts
,
*NL*
Margate
with
mixed
bathing
and
firstrate
hydros
and
spas
,
Eastbourne
,
*NL*
Scarborough
,
Margate
and
so
on
,
beautiful
Bournemouth
,
the
Channel
*NL*
islands
and
similar
bijou
spots
,
which
might
prove
highly
remunerative
.
*NL*
Not
,
of
course
,
with
a
hole
and
corner
scratch
company
or
local
ladies
*NL*
on
the
job
,
witness
Mrs
C
P
M'Coy
type
lend
me
your
valise
and
I
'll
post
*NL*
you
the
ticket
.
No
,
something
top
notch
,
an
all
star
Irish
caste
,
the
*NL*
Tweedy-Flower
grand
opera
company
with
his
own
legal
consort
as
leading
*NL*
lady
as
a
sort
of
counterblast
to
the
Elster
Grimes
and
Moody-Manners
,
*NL*
perfectly
simple
matter
and
he
was
quite
sanguine
of
success
,
providing
*NL*
puffs
in
the
local
papers
could
be
managed
by
some
fellow
with
a
bit
of
*NL*
bounce
who
could
pull
the
indispensable
wires
and
thus
combine
business
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
But
who
?
That
was
the
rub
.
Also
,
without
being
actually
*NL*
positive
,
it
struck
him
a
great
field
was
to
be
opened
up
in
the
line
*NL*
of
opening
up
new
routes
to
keep
pace
with
the
times
_
apropos
_
of
the
*NL*
Fishguard-Rosslare
route
which
,
it
was
mooted
,
was
once
more
on
the
*NL*
_
tapis
_
in
the
circumlocution
departments
with
the
usual
quantity
of
red
*NL*
tape
and
dillydallying
of
effete
fogeydom
and
dunderheads
generally
.
A
*NL*
great
opportunity
there
certainly
was
for
push
and
enterprise
to
meet
*NL*
the
travelling
needs
of
the
public
at
large
,
the
average
man
,
i.e.
*NL*
Brown
,
Robinson
and
Co.
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
subject
of
regret
and
absurd
as
well
on
the
face
of
it
and
no
*NL*
small
blame
to
our
vaunted
society
that
the
man
in
the
street
,
when
the
*NL*
system
really
needed
toning
up
,
for
the
matter
of
a
couple
of
paltry
*NL*
pounds
was
debarred
from
seeing
more
of
the
world
they
lived
in
instead
*NL*
of
being
always
and
ever
cooped
up
since
my
old
stick-in-the-mud
took
me
*NL*
for
a
wife
.
After
all
,
hang
it
,
they
had
their
eleven
and
more
humdrum
*NL*
months
of
it
and
merited
a
radical
change
of
_
venue
_
after
the
grind
*NL*
of
city
life
in
the
summertime
for
choice
when
dame
Nature
is
at
her
*NL*
spectacular
best
constituting
nothing
short
of
a
new
lease
of
life
.
*NL*
There
were
equally
excellent
opportunities
for
vacationists
in
the
home
*NL*
island
,
delightful
sylvan
spots
for
rejuvenation
,
offering
a
plethora
*NL*
of
attractions
as
well
as
a
bracing
tonic
for
the
system
in
and
around
*NL*
Dublin
and
its
picturesque
environs
even
,
Poulaphouca
to
which
there
was
*NL*
a
steamtram
,
but
also
farther
away
from
the
madding
crowd
in
Wicklow
,
*NL*
rightly
termed
the
garden
of
Ireland
,
an
ideal
neighbourhood
for
elderly
*NL*
wheelmen
so
long
as
it
did
n't
come
down
,
and
in
the
wilds
of
Donegal
*NL*
where
if
report
spoke
true
the
_
coup
d'oeil
_
was
exceedingly
grand
*NL*
though
the
lastnamed
locality
was
not
easily
getatable
so
that
the
*NL*
influx
of
visitors
was
not
as
yet
all
that
it
might
be
considering
the
*NL*
signal
benefits
to
be
derived
from
it
while
Howth
with
its
historic
*NL*
associations
and
otherwise
,
Silken
Thomas
,
Grace
O'Malley
,
George
IV
,
*NL*
rhododendrons
several
hundred
feet
above
sealevel
was
a
favourite
haunt
*NL*
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
especially
in
the
spring
when
young
*NL*
men
's
fancy
,
though
it
had
its
own
toll
of
deaths
by
falling
off
the
*NL*
cliffs
by
design
or
accidentally
,
usually
,
by
the
way
,
on
their
left
*NL*
leg
,
it
being
only
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
's
run
from
the
*NL*
pillar
.
Because
of
course
uptodate
tourist
travelling
was
as
yet
merely
*NL*
in
its
infancy
,
so
to
speak
,
and
the
accommodation
left
much
to
be
*NL*
desired
.
Interesting
to
fathom
it
seemed
to
him
from
a
motive
of
*NL*
curiosity
,
pure
and
simple
,
was
whether
it
was
the
traffic
that
created
*NL*
the
route
or
viceversa
or
the
two
sides
in
fact
.
He
turned
back
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
card
,
picture
,
and
passed
it
along
to
Stephen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
seen
a
Chinese
one
time
,
related
the
doughty
narrator
,
that
had
*NL*
little
pills
like
putty
and
he
put
them
in
the
water
and
they
opened
and
*NL*
every
pill
was
something
different
.
One
was
a
ship
,
another
was
a
house
,
*NL*
another
was
a
flower
.
Cooks
rats
in
your
soup
,
he
appetisingly
added
,
*NL*
the
chinks
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
perceiving
an
expression
of
dubiosity
on
their
faces
the
*NL*
globetrotter
went
on
,
adhering
to
his
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
I
seen
a
man
killed
in
Trieste
by
an
Italian
chap
.
Knife
in
his
*NL*
back
.
Knife
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
speaking
he
produced
a
dangerouslooking
claspknife
quite
in
*NL*
keeping
with
his
character
and
held
it
in
the
striking
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
a
knockingshop
it
was
count
of
a
tryon
between
two
smugglers
.
*NL*
Fellow
hid
behind
a
door
,
come
up
behind
him
.
Like
that
.
_
Prepare
to
*NL*
meet
your
God
_
,
says
he
.
Chuk
!
It
went
into
his
back
up
to
the
butt
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heavy
glance
drowsily
roaming
about
kind
of
defied
their
further
*NL*
questions
even
should
they
by
any
chance
want
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
a
good
bit
of
steel
,
repeated
he
,
examining
his
formidable
*NL*
_
stiletto
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
which
harrowing
_
denouement
_
sufficient
to
appal
the
stoutest
he
*NL*
snapped
the
blade
to
and
stowed
the
weapon
in
question
away
as
before
in
*NL*
his
chamber
of
horrors
,
otherwise
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
're
great
for
the
cold
steel
,
somebody
who
was
evidently
quite
in
*NL*
the
dark
said
for
the
benefit
of
them
all
.
That
was
why
they
thought
*NL*
the
park
murders
of
the
invincibles
was
done
by
foreigners
on
account
of
*NL*
them
using
knives
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
remark
passed
obviously
in
the
spirit
of
_
where
ignorance
*NL*
is
bliss
_
Mr
B.
and
Stephen
,
each
in
his
own
particular
way
,
both
*NL*
instinctively
exchanged
meaning
glances
,
in
a
religious
silence
of
the
*NL*
strictly
_
entre
nous
_
variety
however
,
towards
where
Skin-the-Goat
,
*NL*
_
alias
_
the
keeper
,
not
turning
a
hair
,
was
drawing
spurts
of
liquid
*NL*
from
his
boiler
affair
.
His
inscrutable
face
which
was
really
a
work
*NL*
of
art
,
a
perfect
study
in
itself
,
beggaring
description
,
conveyed
*NL*
the
impression
that
he
did
n't
understand
one
jot
of
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
Funny
,
very
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
ensued
a
somewhat
lengthy
pause
.
One
man
was
reading
in
fits
and
*NL*
starts
a
stained
by
coffee
evening
journal
,
another
the
card
with
the
*NL*
natives
_
choza
de
_
,
another
the
seaman
's
discharge
.
Mr
Bloom
,
so
far
*NL*
as
he
was
personally
concerned
,
was
just
pondering
in
pensive
mood
.
He
*NL*
vividly
recollected
when
the
occurrence
alluded
to
took
place
as
well
*NL*
as
yesterday
,
roughly
some
score
of
years
previously
in
the
days
of
the
*NL*
land
troubles
,
when
it
took
the
civilised
world
by
storm
,
figuratively
*NL*
speaking
,
early
in
the
eighties
,
eightyone
to
be
correct
,
when
he
was
*NL*
just
turned
fifteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
boss
,
the
sailor
broke
in
.
Give
us
back
them
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
request
being
complied
with
he
clawed
them
up
with
a
scrape
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
you
seen
the
rock
of
Gibraltar
?
Mr
Bloom
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
grimaced
,
chewing
,
in
a
way
that
might
be
read
as
yes
,
ay
or
*NL*
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ah
,
you
've
touched
there
too
,
Mr
Bloom
said
,
Europa
point
,
thinking
he
*NL*
had
,
in
the
hope
that
the
rover
might
possibly
by
some
reminiscences
but
*NL*
he
failed
to
do
so
,
simply
letting
spirt
a
jet
of
spew
into
the
sawdust
,
*NL*
and
shook
his
head
with
a
sort
of
lazy
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
year
would
that
be
about
?
Mr
B
interrogated
.
Can
you
recall
the
*NL*
boats
?
*NL*
*NL*
Our
_
soi-disant
_
sailor
munched
heavily
awhile
hungrily
before
*NL*
answering
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'm
tired
of
all
them
rocks
in
the
sea
,
he
said
,
and
boats
and
ships
.
*NL*
Salt
junk
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tired
seemingly
,
he
ceased
.
His
questioner
perceiving
that
he
was
not
*NL*
likely
to
get
a
great
deal
of
change
out
of
such
a
wily
old
customer
,
*NL*
fell
to
woolgathering
on
the
enormous
dimensions
of
the
water
about
the
*NL*
globe
,
suffice
it
to
say
that
,
as
a
casual
glance
at
the
map
revealed
,
*NL*
it
covered
fully
three
fourths
of
it
and
he
fully
realised
accordingly
*NL*
what
it
meant
to
rule
the
waves
.
On
more
than
one
occasion
,
a
dozen
*NL*
at
the
lowest
,
near
the
North
Bull
at
Dollymount
he
had
remarked
a
*NL*
superannuated
old
salt
,
evidently
derelict
,
seated
habitually
near
the
*NL*
not
particularly
redolent
sea
on
the
wall
,
staring
quite
obliviously
at
*NL*
it
and
it
at
him
,
dreaming
of
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
as
someone
*NL*
somewhere
sings
.
And
it
left
him
wondering
why
.
Possibly
he
had
tried
to
*NL*
find
out
the
secret
for
himself
,
floundering
up
and
down
the
antipodes
*NL*
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
over
and
under
,
well
,
not
exactly
under
,
*NL*
tempting
the
fates
.
And
the
odds
were
twenty
to
nil
there
was
really
no
*NL*
secret
about
it
at
all
.
Nevertheless
,
without
going
into
the
_
minutiae
_
*NL*
of
the
business
,
the
eloquent
fact
remained
that
the
sea
was
there
in
*NL*
all
its
glory
and
in
the
natural
course
of
things
somebody
or
other
had
*NL*
to
sail
on
it
and
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
though
it
merely
went
*NL*
to
show
how
people
usually
contrived
to
load
that
sort
of
onus
on
to
the
*NL*
other
fellow
like
the
hell
idea
and
the
lottery
and
insurance
which
were
*NL*
run
on
identically
the
same
lines
so
that
for
that
very
reason
if
no
*NL*
other
lifeboat
Sunday
was
a
highly
laudable
institution
to
which
the
*NL*
public
at
large
,
no
matter
where
living
inland
or
seaside
,
as
the
case
*NL*
might
be
,
having
it
brought
home
to
them
like
that
should
extend
its
*NL*
gratitude
also
to
the
harbourmasters
and
coastguard
service
who
had
*NL*
to
man
the
rigging
and
push
off
and
out
amid
the
elements
whatever
the
*NL*
season
when
duty
called
_
Ireland
expects
that
every
man
_
and
so
on
and
*NL*
sometimes
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
in
the
wintertime
not
forgetting
the
*NL*
Irish
lights
,
Kish
and
others
,
liable
to
capsize
at
any
moment
,
rounding
*NL*
which
he
once
with
his
daughter
had
experienced
some
remarkably
choppy
,
*NL*
not
to
say
stormy
,
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
was
a
fellow
sailed
with
me
in
the
Rover
,
the
old
seadog
,
*NL*
himself
a
rover
,
proceeded
,
went
ashore
and
took
up
a
soft
job
as
*NL*
gentleman
's
valet
at
six
quid
a
month
.
Them
are
his
trousers
I
've
on
*NL*
me
and
he
gave
me
an
oilskin
and
that
jackknife
.
I
'm
game
for
that
job
,
*NL*
shaving
and
brushup
.
I
hate
roaming
about
.
There
's
my
son
now
,
Danny
,
*NL*
run
off
to
sea
and
his
mother
got
him
took
in
a
draper
's
in
Cork
where
*NL*
he
could
be
drawing
easy
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
age
is
he
?
queried
one
hearer
who
,
by
the
way
,
seen
from
the
*NL*
side
,
bore
a
distant
resemblance
to
Henry
Campbell
,
the
townclerk
,
away
*NL*
from
the
carking
cares
of
office
,
unwashed
of
course
and
in
a
seedy
*NL*
getup
and
a
strong
suspicion
of
nosepaint
about
the
nasal
appendage
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
the
sailor
answered
with
a
slow
puzzled
utterance
,
my
son
,
Danny
?
*NL*
He
'd
be
about
eighteen
now
,
way
I
figure
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Skibbereen
father
hereupon
tore
open
his
grey
or
unclean
anyhow
*NL*
shirt
with
his
two
hands
and
scratched
away
at
his
chest
on
which
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
an
image
tattooed
in
blue
Chinese
ink
intended
to
represent
an
*NL*
anchor
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
was
lice
in
that
bunk
in
Bridgwater
,
he
remarked
,
sure
as
nuts
.
*NL*
I
must
get
a
wash
tomorrow
or
next
day
.
It
's
them
black
lads
I
objects
*NL*
to
.
I
hate
those
buggers
.
Suck
your
blood
dry
,
they
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
they
were
all
looking
at
his
chest
he
accommodatingly
dragged
*NL*
his
shirt
more
open
so
that
on
top
of
the
timehonoured
symbol
of
the
*NL*
mariner
's
hope
and
rest
they
had
a
full
view
of
the
figure
16
and
a
*NL*
young
man
's
sideface
looking
frowningly
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tattoo
,
the
exhibitor
explained
.
That
was
done
when
we
were
Iying
*NL*
becalmed
off
Odessa
in
the
Black
Sea
under
Captain
Dalton
.
Fellow
,
the
*NL*
name
of
Antonio
,
done
that
.
There
he
is
himself
,
a
Greek
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
it
hurt
much
doing
it
?
one
asked
the
sailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
worthy
,
however
,
was
busily
engaged
in
collecting
round
the
.
*NL*
Someway
in
his
.
Squeezing
or
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
See
here
,
he
said
,
showing
Antonio
.
There
he
is
cursing
the
mate
.
And
*NL*
there
he
is
now
,
he
added
,
the
same
fellow
,
pulling
the
skin
with
his
*NL*
fingers
,
some
special
knack
evidently
,
and
he
laughing
at
a
yarn
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
point
of
fact
the
young
man
named
Antonio
's
livid
face
did
*NL*
actually
look
like
forced
smiling
and
the
curious
effect
excited
the
*NL*
unreserved
admiration
of
everybody
including
Skin-the-Goat
,
who
this
*NL*
time
stretched
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
ay
,
sighed
the
sailor
,
looking
down
on
his
manly
chest
.
He
's
gone
*NL*
too
.
Ate
by
sharks
after
.
Ay
,
ay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
go
of
the
skin
so
that
the
profile
resumed
the
normal
expression
*NL*
of
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Neat
bit
of
work
,
one
longshoreman
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
what
's
the
number
for
?
loafer
number
two
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Eaten
alive
?
a
third
asked
the
sailor
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Ay
,
ay
,
sighed
again
the
latter
personage
,
more
cheerily
this
*NL*
time
with
some
sort
of
a
half
smile
for
a
brief
duration
only
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
questioner
about
the
number
.
Ate
.
A
Greek
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
added
with
rather
gallowsbird
humour
considering
his
alleged
*NL*
end
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
As
bad
as
old
Antonio
,
For
he
left
me
on
my
ownio
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
a
streetwalker
glazed
and
haggard
under
a
black
straw
hat
*NL*
peered
askew
round
the
door
of
the
shelter
palpably
reconnoitring
on
*NL*
her
own
with
the
object
of
bringing
more
grist
to
her
mill
.
Mr
*NL*
Bloom
,
scarcely
knowing
which
way
to
look
,
turned
away
on
the
moment
*NL*
flusterfied
but
outwardly
calm
,
and
,
picking
up
from
the
table
the
pink
*NL*
sheet
of
the
Abbey
street
organ
which
the
jarvey
,
if
such
he
was
,
had
*NL*
laid
aside
,
he
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
the
pink
of
the
paper
though
*NL*
why
pink
.
His
reason
for
so
doing
was
he
recognised
on
the
moment
*NL*
round
the
door
the
same
face
he
had
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
that
*NL*
afternoon
on
Ormond
quay
,
the
partially
idiotic
female
,
namely
,
of
the
*NL*
lane
who
knew
the
lady
in
the
brown
costume
does
be
with
you
-LRB-
Mrs
B.
-RRB-
*NL*
and
begged
the
chance
of
his
washing
.
Also
why
washing
which
seemed
*NL*
rather
vague
than
not
,
your
washing
.
Still
candour
compelled
him
to
*NL*
admit
he
had
washed
his
wife
's
undergarments
when
soiled
in
Holles
*NL*
street
and
women
would
and
did
too
a
man
's
similar
garments
initialled
*NL*
with
Bewley
and
Draper
's
marking
ink
-LRB-
hers
were
,
that
is
-RRB-
if
they
really
*NL*
loved
him
,
that
is
to
say
,
love
me
,
love
my
dirty
shirt
.
Still
just
*NL*
then
,
being
on
tenterhooks
,
he
desired
the
female
's
room
more
than
her
*NL*
company
so
it
came
as
a
genuine
relief
when
the
keeper
made
her
a
rude
*NL*
sign
to
take
herself
off
.
Round
the
side
of
the
Evening
Telegraph
he
*NL*
just
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
her
face
round
the
side
of
the
door
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
demented
glassy
grin
showing
that
she
was
not
exactly
all
*NL*
there
,
viewing
with
evident
amusement
the
group
of
gazers
round
skipper
*NL*
Murphy
's
nautical
chest
and
then
there
was
no
more
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
gunboat
,
the
keeper
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
beats
me
,
Mr
Bloom
confided
to
Stephen
,
medically
I
am
speaking
,
*NL*
how
a
wretched
creature
like
that
from
the
Lock
hospital
reeking
with
*NL*
disease
can
be
barefaced
enough
to
solicit
or
how
any
man
in
his
sober
*NL*
senses
,
if
he
values
his
health
in
the
least
.
Unfortunate
creature
!
Of
*NL*
course
I
suppose
some
man
is
ultimately
responsible
for
her
condition
.
*NL*
Still
no
matter
what
the
cause
is
from
...
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
had
not
noticed
her
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
merely
*NL*
remarking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
this
country
people
sell
much
more
than
she
ever
had
and
do
a
*NL*
roaring
trade
.
Fear
not
them
that
sell
the
body
but
have
not
power
to
*NL*
buy
the
soul
.
She
is
a
bad
merchant
.
She
buys
dear
and
sells
cheap
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
man
,
though
not
by
any
manner
of
means
an
old
maid
or
a
prude
,
*NL*
said
it
was
nothing
short
of
a
crying
scandal
that
ought
to
be
put
a
*NL*
stop
to
_
instanter
_
to
say
that
women
of
that
stamp
-LRB-
quite
apart
from
*NL*
any
oldmaidish
squeamishness
on
the
subject
-RRB-
,
a
necessary
evil
,
w
ere
*NL*
not
licensed
and
medically
inspected
by
the
proper
authorities
,
a
thing
,
*NL*
he
could
truthfully
state
,
he
,
as
a
_
paterfamilias
_
,
was
a
stalwart
*NL*
advocate
of
from
the
very
first
start
.
Whoever
embarked
on
a
policy
of
*NL*
the
sort
,
he
said
,
and
ventilated
the
matter
thoroughly
would
confer
a
*NL*
lasting
boon
on
everybody
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
as
a
good
catholic
,
he
observed
,
talking
of
body
and
soul
,
believe
*NL*
in
the
soul
.
Or
do
you
mean
the
intelligence
,
the
brainpower
as
such
,
*NL*
as
distinct
from
any
outside
object
,
the
table
,
let
us
say
,
that
cup
.
I
*NL*
believe
in
that
myself
because
it
has
been
explained
by
competent
men
as
*NL*
the
convolutions
of
the
grey
matter
.
Otherwise
we
would
never
have
such
*NL*
inventions
as
X
rays
,
for
instance
.
Do
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
cornered
,
Stephen
had
to
make
a
superhuman
effort
of
memory
to
try
*NL*
and
concentrate
and
remember
before
he
could
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
tell
me
on
the
best
authority
it
is
a
simple
substance
and
*NL*
therefore
incorruptible
.
It
would
be
immortal
,
I
understand
,
but
for
the
*NL*
possibility
of
its
annihilation
by
its
First
Cause
Who
,
from
all
I
*NL*
can
hear
,
is
quite
capable
of
adding
that
to
the
number
of
His
other
*NL*
practical
jokes
,
_
corruptio
per
se
_
and
_
corruptio
per
accidens
_
both
*NL*
being
excluded
by
court
etiquette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
thoroughly
acquiesced
in
the
general
gist
of
this
though
the
*NL*
mystical
finesse
involved
was
a
bit
out
of
his
sublunary
depth
still
*NL*
he
felt
bound
to
enter
a
demurrer
on
the
head
of
simple
,
promptly
*NL*
rejoining
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Simple
?
I
should
n't
think
that
is
the
proper
word
.
Of
course
,
I
grant
*NL*
you
,
to
concede
a
point
,
you
do
knock
across
a
simple
soul
once
in
a
*NL*
blue
moon
.
But
what
I
am
anxious
to
arrive
at
is
it
is
one
thing
for
*NL*
instance
to
invent
those
rays
Rontgen
did
or
the
telescope
like
Edison
,
*NL*
though
I
believe
it
was
before
his
time
Galileo
was
the
man
,
I
mean
,
*NL*
and
the
same
applies
to
the
laws
,
for
example
,
of
a
farreaching
natural
*NL*
phenomenon
such
as
electricity
but
it
's
a
horse
of
quite
another
colour
*NL*
to
say
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
supernatural
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
that
,
Stephen
expostulated
,
has
been
proved
conclusively
by
several
*NL*
of
the
bestknown
passages
in
Holy
Writ
,
apart
from
circumstantial
*NL*
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
knotty
point
however
the
views
of
the
pair
,
poles
apart
as
they
*NL*
were
both
in
schooling
and
everything
else
with
the
marked
difference
in
*NL*
their
respective
ages
,
clashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Has
been
?
the
more
experienced
of
the
two
objected
,
sticking
to
his
*NL*
original
point
with
a
smile
of
unbelief
.
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
that
.
*NL*
That
's
a
matter
for
everyman
's
opinion
and
,
without
dragging
in
the
*NL*
sectarian
side
of
the
business
,
I
beg
to
differ
with
you
_
in
toto
_
*NL*
there
.
My
belief
is
,
to
tell
you
the
candid
truth
,
that
those
bits
were
*NL*
genuine
forgeries
all
of
them
put
in
by
monks
most
probably
or
it
's
the
*NL*
big
question
of
our
national
poet
over
again
,
who
precisely
wrote
them
*NL*
like
_
Hamlet
_
and
Bacon
,
as
,
you
who
know
your
Shakespeare
infinitely
*NL*
better
than
I
,
of
course
I
need
n't
tell
you
.
Ca
n't
you
drink
that
*NL*
coffee
,
by
the
way
?
Let
me
stir
it
.
And
take
a
piece
of
that
bun
.
It
's
*NL*
like
one
of
our
skipper
's
bricks
disguised
.
Still
no-one
can
give
what
*NL*
he
has
n't
got
.
Try
a
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Could
n't
,
Stephen
contrived
to
get
out
,
his
mental
organs
for
the
*NL*
moment
refusing
to
dictate
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Faultfinding
being
a
proverbially
bad
hat
Mr
Bloom
thought
well
to
stir
*NL*
or
try
to
the
clotted
sugar
from
the
bottom
and
reflected
with
something
*NL*
approaching
acrimony
on
the
Coffee
Palace
and
its
temperance
-LRB-
and
*NL*
lucrative
-RRB-
work
.
To
be
sure
it
was
a
legitimate
object
and
beyond
yea
or
*NL*
nay
did
a
world
of
good
,
shelters
such
as
the
present
one
they
were
in
*NL*
run
on
teetotal
lines
for
vagrants
at
night
,
concerts
,
dramatic
evenings
*NL*
and
useful
lectures
-LRB-
admittance
free
-RRB-
by
qualified
men
for
the
lower
*NL*
orders
.
On
the
other
hand
he
had
a
distinct
and
painful
recollection
*NL*
they
paid
his
wife
,
Madam
Marion
Tweedy
who
had
been
prominently
*NL*
associated
with
it
at
one
time
,
a
very
modest
remuneration
indeed
for
*NL*
her
pianoplaying
.
The
idea
,
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
believe
,
was
*NL*
to
do
good
and
net
a
profit
,
there
being
no
competition
to
speak
*NL*
of
.
Sulphate
of
copper
poison
SO4
or
something
in
some
dried
peas
he
*NL*
remembered
reading
of
in
a
cheap
eatinghouse
somewhere
but
he
could
n't
*NL*
remember
when
it
was
or
where
.
Anyhow
inspection
,
medical
inspection
,
*NL*
of
all
eatables
seemed
to
him
more
than
ever
necessary
which
possibly
*NL*
accounted
for
the
vogue
of
Dr
Tibble
's
Vi-Cocoa
on
account
of
the
*NL*
medical
analysis
involved
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Have
a
shot
at
it
now
,
he
ventured
to
say
of
the
coffee
after
being
*NL*
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
prevailed
on
to
at
any
rate
taste
it
Stephen
lifted
the
heavy
mug
*NL*
from
the
brown
puddle
it
clopped
out
of
when
taken
up
by
the
handle
and
*NL*
took
a
sip
of
the
offending
beverage
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Still
it
's
solid
food
,
his
good
genius
urged
,
I
'm
a
stickler
for
solid
*NL*
food
,
his
one
and
only
reason
being
not
gormandising
in
the
least
but
*NL*
regular
meals
as
the
_
sine
qua
non
_
for
any
kind
of
proper
work
,
mental
*NL*
or
manual
.
You
ought
to
eat
more
solid
food
.
You
would
feel
a
different
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Liquids
I
can
eat
,
Stephen
said
.
But
O
,
oblige
me
by
taking
away
that
*NL*
knife
.
I
ca
n't
look
at
the
point
of
it
.
It
reminds
me
of
Roman
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Bloom
promptly
did
as
suggested
and
removed
the
incriminated
article
,
*NL*
a
blunt
hornhandled
ordinary
knife
with
nothing
particularly
Roman
or
*NL*
antique
about
it
to
the
lay
eye
,
observing
that
the
point
was
the
least
*NL*
conspicuous
point
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
mutual
friend
's
stories
are
like
himself
,
Mr
Bloom
_
apropos
_
of
*NL*
knives
remarked
to
his
_
confidante
sotto
voce
_
.
Do
you
think
they
are
*NL*
genuine
?
He
could
spin
those
yarns
for
hours
on
end
all
night
long
and
*NL*
lie
like
old
boots
.
Look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
still
though
his
eyes
were
thick
with
sleep
and
sea
air
life
was
*NL*
full
of
a
host
of
things
and
coincidences
of
a
terrible
nature
and
it
*NL*
was
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
it
was
not
an
*NL*
entire
fabrication
though
at
first
blush
there
was
not
much
inherent
*NL*
probability
in
all
the
spoof
he
got
off
his
chest
being
strictly
*NL*
accurate
gospel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
meantime
taking
stock
of
the
individual
in
front
of
him
and
*NL*
Sherlockholmesing
him
up
ever
since
he
clapped
eyes
on
him
.
Though
a
*NL*
wellpreserved
man
of
no
little
stamina
,
if
a
trifle
prone
to
baldness
,
*NL*
there
was
something
spurious
in
the
cut
of
his
jib
that
suggested
a
jail
*NL*
delivery
and
it
required
no
violent
stretch
of
imagination
to
associate
*NL*
such
a
weirdlooking
specimen
with
the
oakum
and
treadmill
fraternity
.
He
*NL*
might
even
have
done
for
his
man
supposing
it
was
his
own
case
he
told
,
*NL*
as
people
often
did
about
others
,
namely
,
that
he
killed
him
himself
*NL*
and
had
served
his
four
or
five
goodlooking
years
in
durance
vile
to
say
*NL*
nothing
of
the
Antonio
personage
-LRB-
no
relation
to
the
dramatic
personage
*NL*
of
identical
name
who
sprang
from
the
pen
of
our
national
poet
-RRB-
who
*NL*
expiated
his
crimes
in
the
melodramatic
manner
above
described
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
he
might
be
only
bluffing
,
a
pardonable
weakness
because
*NL*
meeting
unmistakable
mugs
,
Dublin
residents
,
like
those
jarvies
waiting
*NL*
news
from
abroad
would
tempt
any
ancient
mariner
who
sailed
the
ocean
*NL*
seas
to
draw
the
long
bow
about
the
schooner
_
Hesperus
_
and
etcetera
.
*NL*
And
when
all
was
said
and
done
the
lies
a
fellow
told
about
himself
*NL*
could
n't
probably
hold
a
proverbial
candle
to
the
wholesale
whoppers
*NL*
other
fellows
coined
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mind
you
,
I
'm
not
saying
that
it
's
all
a
pure
invention
,
he
resumed
.
*NL*
Analogous
scenes
are
occasionally
,
if
not
often
,
met
with
.
Giants
,
*NL*
though
that
is
rather
a
far
cry
,
you
see
once
in
a
way
,
Marcella
the
*NL*
midget
queen
.
In
those
waxworks
in
Henry
street
I
myself
saw
some
*NL*
Aztecs
,
as
they
are
called
,
sitting
bowlegged
,
they
could
n't
straighten
*NL*
their
legs
if
you
paid
them
because
the
muscles
here
,
you
see
,
he
*NL*
proceeded
,
indicating
on
his
companion
the
brief
outline
of
the
sinews
*NL*
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
them
behind
the
right
knee
,
were
utterly
*NL*
powerless
from
sitting
that
way
so
long
cramped
up
,
being
adored
as
*NL*
gods
.
There
's
an
example
again
of
simple
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
reverting
to
friend
Sinbad
and
his
horrifying
adventures
-LRB-
who
*NL*
reminded
him
a
bit
of
Ludwig
,
_
alias
_
Ledwidge
,
when
he
occupied
*NL*
the
boards
of
the
Gaiety
when
Michael
Gunn
was
identified
with
the
*NL*
management
in
the
_
Flying
Dutchman
_
,
a
stupendous
success
,
and
his
host
*NL*
of
admirers
came
in
large
numbers
,
everyone
simply
flocking
to
hear
him
*NL*
though
ships
of
any
sort
,
phantom
or
the
reverse
,
on
the
stage
usually
*NL*
fell
a
bit
flat
as
also
did
trains
-RRB-
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
*NL*
incompatible
about
it
,
he
conceded
.
On
the
contrary
that
stab
in
the
*NL*
back
touch
was
quite
in
keeping
with
those
italianos
though
candidly
he
*NL*
was
none
the
less
free
to
admit
those
icecreamers
and
friers
in
the
fish
*NL*
way
not
to
mention
the
chip
potato
variety
and
so
forth
over
in
little
*NL*
Italy
there
near
the
Coombe
were
sober
thrifty
hardworking
fellows
*NL*
except
perhaps
a
bit
too
given
to
pothunting
the
harmless
necessary
*NL*
animal
of
the
feline
persuasion
of
others
at
night
so
as
to
have
a
good
*NL*
old
succulent
tuckin
with
garlic
_
de
rigueur
_
off
him
or
her
next
day
on
*NL*
the
quiet
and
,
he
added
,
on
the
cheap
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Spaniards
,
for
instance
,
he
continued
,
passionate
temperaments
like
*NL*
that
,
impetuous
as
Old
Nick
,
are
given
to
taking
the
law
into
their
own
*NL*
hands
and
give
you
your
quietus
doublequick
with
those
poignards
they
*NL*
carry
in
the
abdomen
.
It
comes
from
the
great
heat
,
climate
generally
.
*NL*
My
wife
is
,
so
to
speak
,
Spanish
,
half
that
is
.
Point
of
fact
she
could
*NL*
actually
claim
Spanish
nationality
if
she
wanted
,
having
been
born
in
*NL*
-LRB-
technically
-RRB-
Spain
,
i.e.
Gibraltar
.
She
has
the
Spanish
type
.
Quite
*NL*
dark
,
regular
brunette
,
black
.
I
for
one
certainly
believe
climate
*NL*
accounts
for
character
.
That
's
why
I
asked
you
if
you
wrote
your
poetry
*NL*
in
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
temperaments
at
the
door
,
Stephen
interposed
with
,
were
very
*NL*
passionate
about
ten
shillings
.
_
Roberto
ruba
roba
sua
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Quite
so
,
Mr
Bloom
dittoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
,
Stephen
said
staring
and
rambling
on
to
himself
or
some
unknown
*NL*
listener
somewhere
,
we
have
the
impetuosity
of
Dante
and
the
isosceles
*NL*
triangle
miss
Portinari
he
fell
in
love
with
and
Leonardo
and
san
*NL*
Tommaso
Mastino
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
's
in
the
blood
,
Mr
Bloom
acceded
at
once
.
All
are
washed
in
the
*NL*
blood
of
the
sun
.
Coincidence
I
just
happened
to
be
in
the
Kildare
*NL*
street
museum
890
today
,
shortly
prior
to
our
meeting
if
I
can
so
call
*NL*
it
,
and
I
was
just
looking
at
those
antique
statues
there
.
The
splendid
*NL*
proportions
of
hips
,
bosom
.
You
simply
do
n't
knock
against
those
kind
of
*NL*
women
here
.
An
exception
here
and
there
.
Handsome
yes
,
pretty
in
a
way
*NL*
you
find
but
what
I
'm
talking
about
is
the
female
form
.
Besides
they
*NL*
have
so
little
taste
in
dress
,
most
of
them
,
which
greatly
enhances
a
*NL*
woman
's
natural
beauty
,
no
matter
what
you
say
.
Rumpled
stockings
,
it
*NL*
may
be
,
possibly
is
,
a
foible
of
mine
but
still
it
's
a
thing
I
simply
*NL*
hate
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Interest
,
however
,
was
starting
to
flag
somewhat
all
round
and
then
the
*NL*
others
got
on
to
talking
about
accidents
at
sea
,
ships
lost
in
a
fog
,
*NL*
goo
collisions
with
icebergs
,
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
Shipahoy
of
course
*NL*
had
his
own
say
to
say
.
He
had
doubled
the
cape
a
few
odd
times
and
*NL*
weathered
a
monsoon
,
a
kind
of
wind
,
in
the
China
seas
and
through
all
*NL*
those
perils
of
the
deep
there
was
one
thing
,
he
declared
,
stood
to
him
*NL*
or
words
to
that
effect
,
a
pious
medal
he
had
that
saved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
after
that
they
drifted
on
to
the
wreck
off
Daunt
's
rock
,
wreck
*NL*
of
that
illfated
Norwegian
barque
nobody
could
think
of
her
name
for
*NL*
the
moment
till
the
jarvey
who
had
really
quite
a
look
of
Henry
Campbell
*NL*
remembered
it
_
Palme
_
on
Booterstown
strand
.
That
was
the
talk
of
the
*NL*
town
that
year
-LRB-
Albert
William
Quill
wrote
a
fine
piece
of
original
*NL*
verse
of
910
distinctive
merit
on
the
topic
for
the
Irish
_
Times
_
-RRB-
,
*NL*
breakers
running
over
her
and
crowds
and
crowds
on
the
shore
in
*NL*
commotion
petrified
with
horror
.
Then
someone
said
something
about
the
*NL*
case
of
the
s.
s.
_
Lady
Cairns
_
of
Swansea
run
into
by
the
_
Mona
_
which
*NL*
was
on
an
opposite
tack
in
rather
muggyish
weather
and
lost
with
all
*NL*
hands
on
deck
.
No
aid
was
given
.
Her
master
,
the
_
Mona
's
_
,
said
he
*NL*
was
afraid
his
collision
bulkhead
would
give
way
.
She
had
no
water
,
it
*NL*
appears
,
in
her
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
stage
an
incident
happened
.
It
having
become
necessary
for
him
*NL*
to
unfurl
a
reef
the
sailor
vacated
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
me
cross
your
bows
mate
,
he
said
to
his
neighbour
who
was
just
*NL*
gently
dropping
off
into
a
peaceful
doze
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
tracks
heavily
,
slowly
with
a
dumpy
sort
of
a
gait
to
the
door
,
*NL*
stepped
heavily
down
the
one
step
there
was
out
of
the
shelter
and
bore
*NL*
due
left
.
While
he
was
in
the
act
of
getting
his
bearings
Mr
Bloom
who
*NL*
noticed
when
he
stood
up
that
he
had
two
flasks
of
presumably
ship
's
*NL*
rum
sticking
one
out
of
each
pocket
for
the
private
consumption
of
his
*NL*
burning
interior
,
saw
him
produce
a
bottle
and
uncork
it
or
unscrew
and
,
*NL*
applying
its
nozz1e
to
his
lips
,
take
a
good
old
delectable
swig
out
of
*NL*
it
with
a
gurgling
noise
.
The
irrepressible
Bloom
,
who
also
had
a
*NL*
shrewd
suspicion
that
the
old
stager
went
out
on
a
manoeuvre
after
the
*NL*
counterattraction
in
the
shape
of
a
female
who
however
had
disappeared
*NL*
to
all
intents
and
purposes
,
could
by
straining
just
perceive
him
,
when
*NL*
duly
refreshed
by
his
rum
puncheon
exploit
,
gaping
up
at
the
piers
and
*NL*
girders
of
the
Loop
line
rather
out
of
his
depth
as
of
course
it
was
all
*NL*
radically
altered
since
his
last
visit
and
greatly
improved
.
Some
person
*NL*
or
persons
invisible
directed
him
to
the
male
urinal
erected
by
the
*NL*
cleansing
committee
all
over
the
place
for
the
purpose
but
after
a
brief
*NL*
space
of
time
during
which
silence
reigned
supreme
the
sailor
,
evidently
*NL*
giving
it
a
wide
berth
,
eased
himself
closer
at
hand
,
the
noise
of
his
*NL*
bilgewater
some
little
time
subsequently
splashing
on
the
ground
where
*NL*
it
apparently
awoke
a
horse
of
the
cabrank
.
A
hoof
scooped
anyway
for
*NL*
new
foothold
after
sleep
and
harness
jingled
.
Slightly
disturbed
in
his
*NL*
sentrybox
by
the
brazier
of
live
coke
the
watcher
of
the
corporation
*NL*
stones
who
,
though
now
broken
down
and
fast
breaking
up
,
was
none
other
*NL*
in
stern
reality
than
the
Gumley
aforesaid
,
now
practically
on
the
*NL*
parish
rates
,
given
the
temporary
job
by
Pat
Tobin
in
all
human
*NL*
probability
from
dictates
of
humanity
knowing
him
before
shifted
about
*NL*
and
shuffled
in
his
box
before
composing
his
limbs
again
in
to
the
arms
*NL*
of
Morpheus
,
a
truly
amazing
piece
of
hard
lines
in
its
most
virulent
*NL*
form
on
a
fellow
most
respectably
connected
and
familiarised
with
decent
*NL*
home
comforts
all
his
life
who
came
in
for
a
cool
100
pounds
a
year
*NL*
at
one
time
which
of
course
the
doublebarrelled
ass
proceeded
to
make
*NL*
general
ducks
and
drakes
of
.
And
there
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
*NL*
after
having
often
painted
the
town
tolerably
pink
without
a
beggarly
*NL*
stiver
.
He
drank
needless
to
be
told
and
it
pointed
only
once
more
a
*NL*
moral
when
he
might
quite
easily
be
in
a
large
way
of
business
if
--
a
*NL*
big
if
,
however
--
he
had
contrived
to
cure
himself
of
his
particular
*NL*
partiality
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
meantime
were
loudly
lamenting
the
falling
off
in
Irish
shipping
,
*NL*
coastwise
and
foreign
as
well
,
which
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
A
Palgrave
Murphy
boat
was
put
off
the
ways
at
Alexandra
basin
,
*NL*
the
only
launch
that
year
.
Right
enough
the
harbours
were
there
only
no
*NL*
ships
ever
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
wrecks
and
wreckers
,
the
keeper
said
,
who
was
evidently
_
au
*NL*
fait
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
wanted
to
ascertain
was
why
that
ship
ran
bang
against
the
only
*NL*
rock
in
Galway
bay
when
the
Galway
harbour
scheme
was
mooted
by
a
Mr
*NL*
Worthington
or
some
name
like
that
,
eh
?
Ask
the
then
captain
,
he
advised
*NL*
them
,
how
much
palmoil
the
British
government
gave
him
for
that
day
's
*NL*
work
,
Captain
John
Lever
of
the
Lever
Line
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Am
I
right
,
skipper
?
he
queried
of
the
sailor
,
now
returning
after
his
*NL*
private
potation
and
the
rest
of
his
exertions
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
worthy
picking
up
the
scent
of
the
fagend
of
the
song
or
words
*NL*
growled
in
wouldbe
music
but
with
great
vim
some
kind
of
chanty
or
other
*NL*
in
seconds
or
thirds
.
Mr
Bloom
's
sharp
ears
heard
him
then
expectorate
*NL*
the
plug
probably
-LRB-
which
it
was
-RRB-
,
so
that
he
must
have
lodged
it
for
the
*NL*
time
being
in
his
fist
while
he
did
the
drinking
and
making
water
jobs
*NL*
and
found
it
a
bit
sour
after
the
liquid
fire
in
question
.
Anyhow
in
*NL*
he
rolled
after
his
successful
libation
-
_
cum
_
-
potation
,
introducing
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
drink
into
the
_
soiree
_
,
boisterously
trolling
,
like
a
*NL*
veritable
son
of
a
seacook
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
The
biscuits
was
as
hard
as
brass
*NL*
And
the
beef
as
salt
as
Lot
's
wife
's
arse
.
*NL*
O
,
Johnny
Lever
!
*NL*
Johnny
Lever
,
O
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
After
which
effusion
the
redoubtable
specimen
duly
arrived
on
the
scene
*NL*
and
regaining
his
seat
he
sank
rather
than
sat
heavily
on
the
form
*NL*
provided
.
Skin-the-Goat
,
assuming
he
was
he
,
evidently
with
an
axe
to
*NL*
grind
,
was
airing
his
grievances
in
a
forcible-feeble
philippic
anent
*NL*
the
natural
resources
of
Ireland
or
something
of
that
sort
which
he
*NL*
described
in
his
lengthy
dissertation
as
the
richest
country
bar
none
on
*NL*
the
face
of
God
's
earth
,
far
and
away
superior
to
England
,
with
coal
in
*NL*
large
quantities
,
six
million
pounds
worth
of
pork
exported
every
year
,
*NL*
ten
millions
between
butter
and
eggs
and
all
the
riches
drained
out
of
*NL*
it
by
England
levying
taxes
on
the
poor
people
that
paid
through
the
*NL*
nose
always
and
gobbling
up
the
best
meat
in
the
market
and
a
lot
more
*NL*
surplus
steam
in
the
same
vein
.
Their
conversation
accordingly
became
*NL*
general
and
all
agreed
that
that
was
a
fact
.
You
could
grow
any
mortal
*NL*
thing
in
Irish
soil
,
he
stated
,
and
there
was
that
colonel
Everard
down
*NL*
there
in
Navan
growing
tobacco
.
Where
would
you
find
anywhere
the
like
*NL*
of
Irish
bacon
?
But
a
day
of
reckoning
,
he
stated
_
crescendo
_
with
no
*NL*
uncertain
voice
,
thoroughly
monopolising
all
the
conversation
,
was
in
*NL*
store
for
mighty
England
,
despite
her
power
of
pelf
on
account
of
her
*NL*
crimes
.
There
would
be
a
fall
and
the
greatest
fall
in
history
.
*NL*
The
Germans
and
the
Japs
were
going
to
have
their
little
lookin
,
he
*NL*
affirmed
.
The
Boers
were
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
Brummagem
England
was
*NL*
toppling
already
and
her
downfall
would
be
Ireland
,
her
Achilles
heel
,
*NL*
which
he
explained
to
them
about
the
vulnerable
point
of
Achilles
,
the
*NL*
Greek
hero
,
a
point
his
auditors
at
once
seized
as
he
completely
gripped
*NL*
their
attention
by
showing
the
tendon
referred
to
on
his
boot
.
His
*NL*
advice
to
every
Irishman
was
:
stay
in
the
land
of
your
birth
and
work
*NL*
for
Ireland
and
live
for
Ireland
.
Ireland
,
Parnell
said
,
could
not
spare
*NL*
a
single
one
of
her
sons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
all
round
marked
the
termination
of
his
_
finale
_
.
The
impervious
*NL*
navigator
heard
these
lurid
tidings
,
undismayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Take
a
bit
of
doing
,
boss
,
retaliated
that
rough
diamond
palpably
a
*NL*
bit
peeved
in
response
to
the
foregoing
truism
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
cold
douche
referring
to
downfall
and
so
on
the
keeper
*NL*
concurred
but
nevertheless
held
to
his
main
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Who
's
the
best
troops
in
the
army
?
the
grizzled
old
veteran
irately
*NL*
interrogated
.
And
the
best
jumpers
and
racers
?
And
the
best
admirals
and
*NL*
generals
we
've
got
?
Tell
me
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
Irish
,
for
choice
,
retorted
the
cabby
like
Campbell
,
facial
*NL*
blemishes
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
's
right
,
the
old
tarpaulin
corroborated
.
The
Irish
catholic
*NL*
peasant
.
He
's
the
backbone
of
our
empire
.
You
know
Jem
Mullins
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
allowing
him
his
individual
opinions
as
everyman
the
keeper
added
*NL*
he
cared
nothing
for
any
empire
,
ours
or
his
,
and
considered
no
Irishman
*NL*
worthy
of
his
salt
that
served
it
.
Then
they
began
to
have
a
few
*NL*
irascible
words
when
it
waxed
hotter
,
both
,
needless
to
say
,
appealing
*NL*
to
the
listeners
who
followed
the
passage
of
arms
with
interest
so
long
*NL*
as
they
did
n't
indulge
in
recriminations
and
come
to
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
inside
information
extending
over
a
series
of
years
Mr
Bloom
was
*NL*
rather
inclined
to
poohpooh
the
suggestion
as
egregious
balderdash
for
,
*NL*
pending
that
consummation
devoutly
to
be
or
not
to
be
wished
for
,
he
was
*NL*
fully
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
their
neighbours
across
the
channel
,
*NL*
unless
they
were
much
bigger
fools
than
he
took
them
for
,
rather
*NL*
concealed
their
strength
than
the
opposite
.
It
was
quite
on
a
par
with
*NL*
the
quixotic
idea
in
certain
quarters
that
in
a
hundred
million
years
*NL*
the
coal
seam
of
the
sister
island
would
be
played
out
and
if
,
as
*NL*
time
went
on
,
that
turned
out
to
be
how
the
cat
jumped
all
he
could
*NL*
personally
say
on
the
matter
was
that
as
a
host
of
contingencies
,
*NL*
equally
relevant
to
the
issue
,
might
occur
ere
then
it
was
highly
*NL*
advisable
in
the
interim
to
try
to
make
the
most
of
both
countries
even
*NL*
though
poles
apart
.
Another
little
interesting
point
,
the
amours
of
*NL*
whores
and
chummies
,
to
put
it
in
common
parlance
,
reminded
him
Irish
*NL*
soldiers
had
as
often
fought
for
England
as
against
her
,
more
so
,
in
*NL*
fact
.
And
now
,
why
?
So
the
scene
between
the
pair
of
them
,
the
licensee
*NL*
of
the
place
rumoured
to
be
or
have
been
Fitzharris
,
the
famous
*NL*
invincible
,
and
the
other
,
obviously
bogus
,
reminded
him
forcibly
as
*NL*
being
on
all
fours
with
the
confidence
trick
,
supposing
,
that
is
,
it
was
*NL*
prearranged
as
the
lookeron
,
a
student
of
the
human
soul
if
anything
,
*NL*
the
others
seeing
least
of
the
game
.
And
as
for
the
lessee
or
keeper
,
*NL*
who
probably
was
n't
the
other
person
at
all
,
he
-LRB-
B.
-RRB-
could
n't
help
*NL*
feeling
and
most
properly
it
was
better
to
give
people
like
that
the
*NL*
goby
unless
you
were
a
blithering
idiot
altogether
and
refuse
to
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
them
as
a
golden
rule
in
private
life
and
their
*NL*
felonsetting
,
there
always
being
the
offchance
of
a
Dannyman
coming
*NL*
forward
and
turning
queen
's
evidence
or
king
's
now
like
Denis
or
Peter
*NL*
Carey
,
an
idea
he
utterly
repudiated
.
Quite
apart
from
that
he
disliked
*NL*
those
careers
of
wrongdoing
and
crime
on
principle
.
Yet
,
though
such
*NL*
criminal
propensities
had
never
been
an
inmate
of
his
bosom
in
any
*NL*
shape
or
form
,
he
certainly
did
feel
and
no
denying
it
-LRB-
while
inwardly
*NL*
remaining
what
he
was
-RRB-
a
certain
kind
of
admiration
for
a
man
who
*NL*
had
actually
brandished
a
knife
,
cold
steel
,
with
the
courage
of
his
*NL*
political
convictions
-LRB-
though
,
personally
,
he
would
never
be
a
party
to
*NL*
any
such
thing
-RRB-
,
off
the
same
bat
as
those
love
vendettas
of
the
south
,
*NL*
have
her
or
swing
for
her
,
when
the
husband
frequently
,
after
some
words
*NL*
passed
between
the
two
concerning
her
relations
with
the
other
lucky
*NL*
mortal
-LRB-
he
having
had
the
pair
watched
-RRB-
,
inflicted
fatal
injuries
on
*NL*
his
adored
one
as
a
result
of
an
alternative
postnuptial
_
liaison
_
*NL*
by
plunging
his
knife
into
her
,
until
it
just
struck
him
that
*NL*
Fitz
,
nicknamed
Skin-the-Goat
,
merely
drove
the
car
for
the
actual
*NL*
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
and
so
was
not
,
if
he
was
reliably
informed
,
*NL*
actually
party
to
the
ambush
which
,
in
point
of
fact
,
was
the
plea
some
*NL*
legal
luminary
saved
his
skin
on
.
In
any
case
that
was
very
ancient
*NL*
history
by
now
and
as
for
our
friend
,
the
pseudo
Skin-the-etcetera
,
he
*NL*
had
transparently
outlived
his
welcome
.
He
ought
to
have
either
died
*NL*
naturally
or
on
the
scaffold
high
.
Like
actresses
,
always
farewell
*NL*
positively
last
performance
then
come
up
smiling
again
.
Generous
to
a
*NL*
fault
of
course
,
temperamental
,
no
economising
or
any
idea
of
the
sort
,
*NL*
always
snapping
at
the
bone
for
the
shadow
.
So
similarly
he
had
a
very
*NL*
shrewd
suspicion
that
Mr
Johnny
Lever
got
rid
of
some
l
s
d.
in
the
*NL*
course
of
his
perambulations
round
the
docks
in
the
congenial
atmosphere
*NL*
of
the
_
Old
Ireland
_
tavern
,
come
back
to
Erin
and
so
on
.
Then
as
for
*NL*
the
other
he
had
heard
not
so
long
before
the
same
identical
lingo
as
he
*NL*
told
Stephen
how
he
simply
but
effectually
silenced
the
offender
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
took
umbrage
at
something
or
other
,
that
muchinjured
but
on
the
*NL*
whole
eventempered
person
declared
,
I
let
slip
.
He
called
me
a
jew
and
*NL*
in
a
heated
fashion
offensively
.
So
I
without
deviating
from
plain
facts
*NL*
in
the
least
told
him
his
God
,
I
mean
Christ
,
was
a
jew
too
and
all
his
*NL*
family
like
me
though
in
reality
I
'm
not
.
That
was
one
for
him
.
A
soft
*NL*
answer
turns
away
wrath
.
He
had
n't
a
word
to
say
for
himself
as
everyone
*NL*
saw
.
Am
I
not
right
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
a
long
you
are
wrong
gaze
on
Stephen
of
timorous
dark
pride
*NL*
at
the
soft
impeachment
with
a
glance
also
of
entreaty
for
he
seemed
to
*NL*
glean
in
a
kind
of
a
way
that
it
was
n't
all
exactly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Ex
quibus
_
,
Stephen
mumbled
in
a
noncommittal
accent
,
their
two
or
*NL*
four
eyes
conversing
,
_
Christus
_
or
Bloom
his
name
is
or
after
all
any
*NL*
other
,
_
secundum
carnem
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
course
,
Mr
B.
proceeded
to
stipulate
,
you
must
look
at
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
question
.
It
is
hard
to
lay
down
any
hard
and
fast
rules
as
to
*NL*
right
and
wrong
but
room
for
improvement
all
round
there
certainly
is
*NL*
though
every
country
,
they
say
,
our
own
distressful
included
,
has
the
*NL*
government
it
deserves
.
But
with
a
little
goodwill
all
round
.
It
's
all
*NL*
very
fine
to
boast
of
mutual
superiority
but
what
about
mutual
equality
.
*NL*
I
resent
violence
and
intolerance
in
any
shape
or
form
.
It
never
*NL*
reaches
anything
or
stops
anything
.
A
revolution
must
come
on
the
due
*NL*
instalments
plan
.
It
's
a
patent
absurdity
on
the
face
of
it
to
hate
*NL*
people
because
they
live
round
the
corner
and
speak
another
vernacular
,
*NL*
in
the
next
house
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Memorable
bloody
bridge
battle
and
seven
minutes
'
war
,
Stephen
*NL*
assented
,
between
Skinner
's
alley
and
Ormond
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
Mr
Bloom
thoroughly
agreed
,
entirely
endorsing
the
remark
,
that
*NL*
was
overwhelmingly
right
.
And
the
whole
world
was
full
of
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
just
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
,
he
said
.
A
hocuspocus
of
*NL*
conflicting
evidence
that
candidly
you
could
n't
remotely
...
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
wretched
quarrels
,
in
his
humble
opinion
,
stirring
up
*NL*
bad
blood
,
from
some
bump
of
combativeness
or
gland
of
some
kind
,
*NL*
erroneously
supposed
to
be
about
a
punctilio
of
honour
and
a
flag
,
were
*NL*
very
largely
a
question
of
the
money
question
which
was
at
the
back
of
*NL*
everything
greed
and
jealousy
,
people
never
knowing
when
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
accuse
,
remarked
he
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
from
the
others
who
probably
and
spoke
nearer
to
,
so
as
*NL*
the
others
in
case
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Jews
,
he
softly
imparted
in
an
aside
in
Stephen
's
ear
,
are
accused
of
*NL*
ruining
.
Not
a
vestige
of
truth
in
it
,
I
can
safely
say
.
History
,
would
*NL*
you
be
surprised
to
learn
,
proves
up
to
the
hilt
Spain
decayed
when
the
*NL*
inquisition
hounded
the
jews
out
and
England
prospered
when
Cromwell
,
*NL*
an
uncommonly
able
ruffian
who
in
other
respects
has
much
to
answer
for
,
*NL*
imported
them
.
Why
?
Because
they
are
imbued
with
the
proper
spirit
.
They
*NL*
are
practical
and
are
proved
to
be
so
.
I
do
n't
want
to
indulge
in
any
*NL*
because
you
know
the
standard
works
on
the
subject
and
then
orthodox
as
*NL*
you
are
.
But
in
the
economic
,
not
touching
religion
,
domain
the
priest
*NL*
spells
poverty
.
Spain
again
,
you
saw
in
the
war
,
compared
with
goahead
*NL*
America
.
Turks
.
It
's
in
the
dogma
.
Because
if
they
did
n't
believe
they
'd
*NL*
go
straight
to
heaven
when
they
die
they
'd
try
to
live
better
,
at
least
*NL*
so
I
think
.
That
's
the
juggle
on
which
the
p.p
's
raise
the
wind
on
false
*NL*
pretences
.
I
'm
,
he
resumed
with
dramatic
force
,
as
good
an
Irishman
*NL*
as
that
rude
person
I
told
you
about
at
the
outset
and
I
want
to
see
*NL*
everyone
,
concluded
he
,
all
creeds
and
classes
_
pro
rata
_
having
a
*NL*
comfortable
tidysized
income
,
in
no
niggard
fashion
either
,
something
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
of
300
pounds
per
annum
.
That
's
the
vital
issue
*NL*
at
stake
and
it
's
feasible
and
would
be
provocative
of
friendlier
*NL*
intercourse
between
man
and
man
.
At
least
that
's
my
idea
for
what
it
's
*NL*
worth
.
I
call
that
patriotism
.
_
Ubi
patria
_
,
as
we
learned
a
smattering
*NL*
of
in
our
classical
days
in
_
Alma
Mater
,
vita
bene
_
.
Where
you
can
live
*NL*
well
,
the
sense
is
,
if
you
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
his
untastable
apology
for
a
cup
of
coffee
,
listening
to
this
*NL*
synopsis
of
things
in
general
,
Stephen
stared
at
nothing
in
particular
.
*NL*
He
could
hear
,
of
course
,
all
kinds
of
words
changing
colour
like
those
*NL*
crabs
about
Ringsend
in
the
morning
burrowing
quickly
into
all
colours
*NL*
of
different
sorts
of
the
same
sand
where
they
had
a
home
somewhere
*NL*
beneath
or
seemed
to
.
Then
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
eyes
that
said
or
*NL*
did
n't
say
the
words
the
voice
he
heard
said
,
if
you
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Count
me
out
,
he
managed
to
remark
,
meaning
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
were
surprised
at
this
observation
because
as
he
,
the
person
*NL*
who
owned
them
pro
tem
.
observed
or
rather
his
voice
speaking
did
,
all
*NL*
must
work
,
have
to
,
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
,
of
course
,
the
other
hastened
to
affirm
,
work
in
the
widest
*NL*
possible
sense
.
Also
literary
labour
not
merely
for
the
kudos
of
*NL*
the
thing
.
Writing
for
the
newspapers
which
is
the
readiest
channel
*NL*
nowadays
.
That
's
work
too
.
Important
work
.
After
all
,
from
the
little
*NL*
I
know
of
you
,
after
all
the
money
expended
on
your
education
you
are
*NL*
entitled
to
recoup
yourself
and
command
your
price
.
You
have
every
bit
*NL*
as
much
right
to
live
by
your
pen
in
pursuit
of
your
philosophy
as
the
*NL*
peasant
has
.
What
?
You
both
belong
to
Ireland
,
the
brain
and
the
brawn
.
*NL*
Each
is
equally
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
suspect
,
Stephen
retorted
with
a
sort
of
a
half
laugh
,
that
I
may
*NL*
be
important
because
I
belong
to
the
_
faubourg
Saint
Patrice
_
called
*NL*
Ireland
for
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
go
a
step
farther
,
Mr
Bloom
insinuated
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
I
suspect
,
Stephen
interrupted
,
that
Ireland
must
be
important
*NL*
because
it
belongs
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
belongs
,
queried
Mr
Bloom
bending
,
fancying
he
was
perhaps
under
*NL*
some
misapprehension
.
Excuse
me
.
Unfortunately
,
I
did
n't
catch
the
*NL*
latter
portion
.
What
was
it
you
...
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
patently
crosstempered
,
repeated
and
shoved
aside
his
mug
of
*NL*
coffee
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
none
too
politely
,
adding
:
1170
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
ca
n't
change
the
country
.
Let
us
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
pertinent
suggestion
Mr
Bloom
,
to
change
the
subject
,
looked
*NL*
down
but
in
a
quandary
,
as
he
could
n't
tell
exactly
what
construction
*NL*
to
put
on
belongs
to
which
sounded
rather
a
far
cry
.
The
rebuke
of
some
*NL*
kind
was
clearer
than
the
other
part
.
Needless
to
say
the
fumes
of
*NL*
his
recent
orgy
spoke
then
with
some
asperity
in
a
curious
bitter
way
*NL*
foreign
to
his
sober
state
.
Probably
the
homelife
to
which
Mr
B
attached
*NL*
the
utmost
importance
had
not
been
all
that
was
needful
or
he
had
n't
*NL*
been
familiarised
with
the
right
sort
of
people
.
With
a
touch
of
fear
*NL*
for
the
young
man
beside
him
whom
he
furtively
scrutinised
with
an
air
*NL*
of
some
consternation
remembering
he
had
just
come
back
from
Paris
,
*NL*
the
eyes
more
especially
reminding
him
forcibly
of
father
and
sister
,
*NL*
failing
to
throw
much
light
on
the
subject
,
however
,
he
brought
to
mind
*NL*
instances
of
cultured
fellows
that
promised
so
brilliantly
nipped
in
the
*NL*
bud
of
premature
decay
and
nobody
to
blame
but
themselves
.
For
instance
*NL*
there
was
the
case
of
O'Callaghan
,
for
one
,
the
halfcrazy
faddist
,
*NL*
respectably
connected
though
of
inadequate
means
,
with
his
mad
vagaries
*NL*
among
whose
other
gay
doings
when
rotto
and
making
himself
a
nuisance
*NL*
to
everybody
all
round
he
was
in
the
habit
of
ostentatiously
sporting
in
*NL*
public
a
suit
of
brown
paper
-LRB-
a
fact
-RRB-
.
And
then
the
usual
_
denouement
_
*NL*
after
the
fun
had
gone
on
fast
and
furious
he
got
1190
landed
into
hot
*NL*
water
and
had
to
be
spirited
away
by
a
few
friends
,
after
a
strong
hint
*NL*
to
a
blind
horse
from
John
Mallon
of
Lower
Castle
Yard
,
so
as
not
to
*NL*
be
made
amenable
under
section
two
of
the
criminal
law
amendment
act
,
*NL*
certain
names
of
those
subpoenaed
being
handed
in
but
not
divulged
*NL*
for
reasons
which
will
occur
to
anyone
with
a
pick
of
brains
.
Briefly
,
*NL*
putting
two
and
two
together
,
six
sixteen
which
he
pointedly
turned
a
*NL*
deaf
ear
to
,
Antonio
and
so
forth
,
jockeys
and
esthetes
and
the
tattoo
*NL*
which
was
all
the
go
in
the
seventies
or
thereabouts
even
in
the
house
*NL*
of
lords
because
early
in
life
the
occupant
of
the
throne
,
then
heir
*NL*
apparent
,
the
other
members
of
the
upper
ten
and
other
high
personages
*NL*
simply
following
in
the
footsteps
of
the
head
of
the
state
,
he
reflected
*NL*
about
the
errors
of
notorieties
and
crowned
heads
running
counter
to
*NL*
morality
such
as
the
Cornwall
case
a
number
of
years
before
under
their
*NL*
veneer
in

Mrs
Grundy
,
*NL*
as
the
law
stands
,
was
terribly
down
on
though
not
for
the
reason
they
*NL*
thought
they
were
probably
whatever
it
was
except
women
chiefly
who
were
*NL*
always
fiddling
more
or
less
at
one
another
it
being
largely
a
matter
of
*NL*
dress
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
Ladies
who
like
distinctive
underclothing
*NL*
should
,
and
every
welltailored
man
must
,
trying
to
make
the
gap
wider
*NL*
between
them
by
innuendo
and
give
more
of
a
genuine
filip
to
acts
of

impropriety
between
the
two
,
she
unbuttoned
his
and
then
he
untied
her
,
*NL*
mind
the
pin
,
whereas
savages
in
the
cannibal
islands
,
say
,
at
ninety
*NL*
degrees
in
the
shade
not
caring
a
continental

However
,
reverting
to
the
*NL*
original
,
there
were
on
the
other
hand
others
who
had
forced
their
way
*NL*
to
the
top
from
the
lowest
rung
by
the
aid
of
their

.
Sheer
*NL*
force

,
that
.
With

,
sir
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
and
further
reasons
he
felt
it
was
his
interest
and
duty
even
*NL*
to
wait
on
and
profit
by
the
unlookedfor
occasion
though
why
he
could
*NL*
not
exactly
tell
being
as
it
was
already
several
shillings
to
the
*NL*
bad
having
in
fact
let
himself
in
for
it
.
Still
to
cultivate
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
someone
of
no
uncommon
calibre
who
could
provide
food
*NL*
for
reflection
would
amply
repay
any
small
.
Intellectual
stimulation
,
*NL*
as
such
,
was
,
he
felt
,
from
time
to
time
a
firstrate
tonic
for
the
mind
.
*NL*
Added
to
which
was
the
coincidence
of
meeting

,

,

,
*NL*
old

of
the

,

loafers
,
the
*NL*
whole
galaxy
of

,
all
went
to
make
up
a
miniature
cameo
of
the
*NL*
world
we
live
in
especially
as
the
lives
of
the
submerged
tenth
,
viz
.
*NL*
coalminers
,
divers
,
scavengers
etc.
,
were
very
much
under
the
microscope
*NL*
lately
.
To
improve
the
shining
hour
he
wondered
whether
he
might
meet
*NL*
with
anything
approaching
the
same
luck
as
Mr
Philip
Beaufoy
if
taken
*NL*
down
in

suppose
he
were
to
pen
something
out

turned
out
the

had

on

*NL*
One
morning
you
would
open
the
paper
,
the
cabman
affirmed
,
and
read
:
*NL*
_
Return
of
Parnell
_
.
He
bet
them
what
they
liked
.
A
Dublin
fusilier
was
*NL*
in
that
shelter
one
night
and
said
he
saw
him
in
South
Africa
.
Pride
it
*NL*
was
killed
him
.
He
ought
to
have
done
away
with
himself
or
lain
low
for
*NL*
a
time
after
committee
room
no
15
until
he
was
his
old
self
again
with
*NL*
no-one
to
point
a
finger
at
him
.
Then
they
would
all
to
a
man
have
gone
*NL*
down
on
their
marrowbones
to
him
to
come
back
when
he
had
recovered
*NL*
his
senses
.
Dead
he
was
n't
.
Simply
absconded
somewhere
.
The
coffin
they
*NL*
brought
over
was
full
of
stones
.
He
changed
his
name
to
De
Wet
,
the
Boer
*NL*
general
.
He
made
a
mistake
to
fight
the
priests
.
And
so
forth
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
same
Bloom
-LRB-
properly
so
dubbed
-RRB-
was
rather
surprised
at
their
*NL*
memories
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
was
a
case
of
tarbarrels
and
*NL*
not
singly
but
in
their
thousands
and
then
complete
oblivion
because
it
*NL*
was
twenty
odd
years
.
Highly
unlikely
of
course
there
was
even
a
shadow
*NL*
of
truth
in
the
stones
and
,
even
supposing
,
he
thought
a
return
highly
*NL*
inadvisable
,
all
things
considered
.
Something
evidently
riled
them
in
*NL*
his
death
.
Either
he
petered
out
too
tamely
of
acute
pneumonia
just
when
*NL*
his
various
different
political
arrangements
were
nearing
completion
*NL*
or
whether
it
transpired
he
owed
his
death
to
his
having
neglected
to
*NL*
change
his
boots
and
clothes-after
a
wetting
when
a
cold
resulted
and
*NL*
failing
to
consult
a
specialist
he
being
confined
to
his
room
till
he
*NL*
eventually
died
of
it
amid
widespread
regret
before
a
fortnight
was
at
*NL*
an
end
or
quite
possibly
they
were
distressed
to
find
the
job
was
taken
*NL*
out
of
their
hands
.
Of
course
nobody
being
acquainted
with
his
movements
*NL*
even
before
there
was
absolutely
no
clue
as
to
his
whereabouts
which
*NL*
were
decidedly
of
the
_
Alice
,
where
art
thou
_
order
even
prior
to
his
*NL*
starting
to
go
under
several
aliases
such
as
Fox
and
Stewart
so
the
*NL*
remark
which
emanated
from
friend
cabby
might
be
within
the
bounds
of
*NL*
possibility
.
Naturally
then
it
would
prey
on
his
mind
as
a
born
leader
*NL*
of
men
which
undoubtedly
he
was
and
a
commanding
figure
,
a
sixfooter
*NL*
or
at
any
rate
five
feet
ten
or
eleven
in
his
stockinged
feet
,
whereas
*NL*
Messrs
So
and
So
who
,
though
they
were
n't
even
a
patch
on
the
former
*NL*
man
,
ruled
the
roost
after
their
redeeming
features
were
very
few
and
*NL*
far
between
.
It
certainly
pointed
a
moral
,
the
idol
with
feet
of
clay
,
*NL*
and
then
seventytwo
of
his
trusty
henchmen
rounding
on
him
with
mutual
*NL*
mudslinging
.
And
the
identical
same
with
murderers
.
You
had
to
come
*NL*
back
.
That
haunting
sense
kind
of
drew
you
.
To
show
the
understudy
in
*NL*
the
title
_
role
_
how
to
.
He
saw
him
once
on
the
auspicious
occasion
*NL*
when
they
broke
up
the
type
in
the
_
Insuppressible
_
or
was
it
_
United
*NL*
Ireland
_
,
a
privilege
he
keenly
appreciated
,
and
,
in
point
of
fact
,
*NL*
handed
him
his
silk
hat
when
it
was
knocked
off
and
he
said
_
Thank
you
_
,
*NL*
excited
as
he
undoubtedly
was
under
his
frigid
exterior
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
little
misadventure
mentioned
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
:
what
's
*NL*
bred
in
the
bone
.
Still
as
regards
return
.
You
were
a
lucky
dog
if
*NL*
they
did
n't
set
the
terrier
at
you
directly
you
got
back
.
Then
a
lot
of
*NL*
shillyshally
usually
followed
,
Tom
for
and
Dick
and
Harry
against
.
And
*NL*
then
,
number
one
,
you
came
up
against
the
man
in
possession
and
had
to
*NL*
produce
your
credentials
like
the
claimant
in
the
Tichborne
case
,
*NL*
Roger
Charles
Tichborne
,
_
Bella
_
was
the
boat
's
name
to
the
best
of
his
*NL*
recollection
he
,
the
heir
,
went
down
in
as
the
evidence
went
to
show
*NL*
and
there
was
a
tattoo
mark
too
in
Indian
ink
,
lord
Bellew
was
it
,
as
he
*NL*
might
very
easily
have
picked
up
the
details
from
some
pal
on
board
ship
*NL*
and
then
,
when
got
up
to
tally
with
the
description
given
,
introduce
*NL*
himself
with
:
_
Excuse
me
,
my
name
is
So
and
So
_
or
some
such
commonplace
*NL*
remark
.
A
more
prudent
course
,
as
Bloom
said
to
the
not
over
effusive
,
*NL*
in
fact
like
the
distinguished
personage
under
discussion
beside
him
,
*NL*
would
have
been
to
sound
the
lie
of
the
land
first
.
*NL*
*NL*

bitch
,
that
English

did

,
the

*NL*
commented

was
and
a
cottonball
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gratuitous
contribution
of
a
humorous
character
occasioned
a
fair
*NL*
amount
of
laughter
among
his
_
entourage
_
.
As
regards
Bloom
he
,
without
*NL*
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
smile
,
merely
gazed
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
door
and
reflected
upon
the
historic
story
which
had
aroused
*NL*
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time
when
the
facts
,
to
make
matters
*NL*
worse
,
were
made
public
with
the
usual
affectionate
letters
that
passed
*NL*
between
them
full
of
sweet
nothings
.
First
it
was
strictly
Platonic
till
*NL*
nature
intervened
and
an
attachment
sprang
up
between
them
till
bit
by
*NL*
bit
matters
came
to
a
climax
and
the
matter
became
the
talk
of
the
town
*NL*
till
the
staggering
blow
came
as
a
welcome
intelligence
to
not
a
few
*NL*
evildisposed
,
however
,
who
were
resolved
upon
encompassing
his
downfall
*NL*
though
the
thing
was
public
property
all
along
though
not
to
anything
*NL*
like
the
sensational
extent
that
it
subsequently
blossomed
into
.
Since
*NL*
their
names
were
coupled
,
though
,
since
he
was
her
declared
favourite
,
*NL*
where
was
the
particular
necessity
to
proclaim
it
to
the
rank
and
file
*NL*
from
the
housetops
,
the
fact
,
namely
,
that
he
had
shared
her
bedroom
*NL*
which
came
out
in
the
witnessbox
on
oath
when
a
thrill
went
through
the
*NL*
packed
court
literally
electrifying
everybody
in
the
shape
of
witnesses
*NL*
swearing
to
having
witnessed
him
on
such
and
such
a
particular
date
in
*NL*
the
act
of
scrambling
out
of
an
upstairs
apartment
with
the
assistance
*NL*
of
a
ladder
in
night
apparel
,
having
gained
admittance
in
the
same
*NL*
fashion
,
a
fact
the
weeklies
,
addicted
to
the
lubric
a
little
,
simply
*NL*
coined
shoals
of
money
out
of
.
Whereas
the
simple
fact
of
the
case
was
*NL*
it
was
simply
a
case
of
the
husband
not
being
up
to
the
scratch
,
with
*NL*
nothing
in
common
between
them
beyond
the
name
,
and
then
a
real
man
*NL*
arriving
on
the
scene
,
strong
to
the
verge
of
weakness
,
falling
a
victim
*NL*
to
her
siren
charms
and
forgetting
home
ties
,
the
usual
sequel
,
to
bask
*NL*
in
the
loved
one
's
smiles
.
The
eternal
question
of
the
life
connubial
,
*NL*
needless
to
say
,
cropped
up
.
Can
real
love
,
supposing
there
happens
to
*NL*
be
another
chap
in
the
case
,
exist
between
married
folk
?
Poser
.
*NL*
Though
it
was
no
concern
of
theirs
absolutely
if
he
regarded
her
with
*NL*
affection
,
carried
away
by
a
wave
of
folly
.
A
magnificent
specimen
of
*NL*
manhood
he
was
truly
augmented
obviously
by
gifts
of
a
high
order
,
as
*NL*
compared
with
the
other
military
supernumerary
that
is
-LRB-
who
was
just
the
*NL*
usual
everyday
_
farewell
,
my
gallant
captain
_
kind
of
an
individual
in
*NL*
the
light
dragoons
,
the
18th
hussars
to
be
accurate
-RRB-
and
inflammable
*NL*
doubtless
-LRB-
the
fallen
leader
,
that
is
,
not
the
other
-RRB-
in
his
own
*NL*
peculiar
way
which
she
of
course
,
woman
,
quickly
perceived
as
highly
*NL*
likely
to
carve
his
way
to
fame
which
he
almost
bid
fair
to
do
till
the
*NL*
priests
and
ministers
of
the
gospel
as
a
whole
,
his
erstwhile
staunch
*NL*
adherents
,
and
his
beloved
evicted
tenants
for
whom
he
had
done
yeoman
*NL*
service
in
the
rural
parts
of
the
country
by
taking
up
the
cudgels
on
*NL*
their
behalf
in
a
way
that
exceeded
their
most
sanguine
expectations
,
*NL*
very
effectually
cooked
his
matrimonial
goose
,
thereby
heaping
coals
of
*NL*
fire
on
his
head
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
fabled
ass
's
kick
.
Looking
*NL*
back
now
in
a
retrospective
kind
of
arrangement
all
seemed
a
kind
of
*NL*
dream
.
And
then
coming
back
was
the
worst
thing
you
ever
did
because
it
*NL*
went
without
saying
you
would
feel
out
of
place
as
things
always
moved
*NL*
with
the
times
.
Why
,
as
he
reflected
,
Irishtown
strand
,
a
locality
he
*NL*
had
not
been
in
for
quite
a
number
of
years
looked
different
somehow
*NL*
since
,
as
it
happened
,
he
went
to
reside
on
the
north
side
.
North
or
*NL*
south
,
however
,
it
was
just
the
wellknown
case
of
hot
passion
,
pure
and
*NL*
simple
,
upsetting
the
applecart
with
a
vengeance
and
just
bore
out
the
*NL*
very
thing
he
was
saying
as
she
also
was
Spanish
or
half
so
,
types
that
*NL*
would
n't
do
things
by
halves
,
passionate
abandon
of
the
south
,
casting
*NL*
every
shred
of
decency
to
the
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Just
bears
out
what
I
was
saying
,
he
,
with
glowing
bosom
said
to
*NL*
Stephen
,
about
blood
and
the
sun
.
And
,
if
I
do
n't
greatly
mistake
she
*NL*
was
Spanish
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
king
of
Spain
's
daughter
,
Stephen
answered
,
adding
something
or
*NL*
other
rather
muddled
about
farewell
and
adieu
to
you
Spanish
onions
and
*NL*
the
first
land
called
the
Deadman
and
from
Ramhead
to
Scilly
was
so
and
*NL*
so
many
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Was
she
?
Bloom
ejaculated
,
surprised
though
not
astonished
by
any
*NL*
means
,
I
never
heard
that
rumour
before
.
Possible
,
especially
there
,
it
*NL*
was
as
she
lived
there
.
So
,
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carefully
avoiding
a
book
in
his
pocket
_
Sweets
of
_
,
which
reminded
him
*NL*
by
the
by
of
that
Cap
l
street
library
book
out
of
date
,
he
took
out
his
*NL*
pocketbook
and
,
turning
over
the
various
contents
it
contained
rapidly
*NL*
finally
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Do
you
consider
,
by
the
by
,
he
said
,
thoughtfully
selecting
a
faded
*NL*
photo
which
he
laid
on
the
table
,
that
a
Spanish
type
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
,
obviously
addressed
,
looked
down
on
the
photo
showing
a
large
*NL*
sized
lady
with
her
fleshy
charms
on
evidence
in
an
open
fashion
as
she
*NL*
was
in
the
full
bloom
of
womanhood
in
evening
dress
cut
ostentatiously
*NL*
low
for
the
occasion
to
give
a
liberal
display
of
bosom
,
with
more
than
*NL*
vision
of
breasts
,
her
full
lips
parted
and
some
perfect
teeth
,
standing
*NL*
near
,
ostensibly
with
gravity
,
a
piano
on
the
rest
of
which
was
_
In
Old
*NL*
Madrid
_
,
a
ballad
,
pretty
in
its
way
,
which
was
then
all
the
vogue
.
Her
*NL*
-LRB-
the
lady
's
-RRB-
eyes
,
dark
,
large
,
looked
at
Stephen
,
about
to
smile
about
*NL*
something
to
be
admired
,
Lafayette
of
Westmoreland
street
,
Dublin
's
*NL*
premier
photographic
artist
,
being
responsible
for
the
esthetic
*NL*
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mrs
Bloom
,
my
wife
the
_
prima
donna
_
Madam
Marion
Tweedy
,
Bloom
*NL*
indicated
.
Taken
a
few
years
since
.
In
or
about
ninety
six
.
Very
like
*NL*
her
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
the
young
man
he
looked
also
at
the
photo
of
the
lady
now
his
*NL*
1440
legal
wife
who
,
he
intimated
,
was
the
accomplished
daughter
of
*NL*
Major
Brian
Tweedy
and
displayed
at
an
early
age
remarkable
proficiency
*NL*
as
a
singer
having
even
made
her
bow
to
the
public
when
her
years
*NL*
numbered
barely
sweet
sixteen
.
As
for
the
face
it
was
a
speaking
*NL*
likeness
in
expression
but
it
did
not
do
justice
to
her
figure
which
*NL*
came
in
for
a
lot
of
notice
usually
and
which
did
not
come
out
to
the
*NL*
best
advantage
in
that
getup
.
She
could
without
difficulty
,
he
said
,
*NL*
have
posed
for
the
ensemble
,
not
to
dwell
on
certain
opulent
curves
of
*NL*
the
.
He
dwelt
,
being
a
bit
of
an
artist
in
his
spare
time
,
on
the
female
*NL*
form
in
general
developmentally
because
,
as
it
so
happened
,
no
later
*NL*
than
that
afternoon
he
had
seen
those
Grecian
statues
,
1450
perfectly
*NL*
developed
as
works
of
art
,
in
the
National
Museum
.
Marble
could
give
*NL*
the
original
,
shoulders
,
back
,
all
the
symmetry
,
all
the
rest
.
Yes
,
*NL*
puritanisme
,
it
does
though
Saint
Joseph
's
sovereign
thievery
alors
*NL*
-LRB-
Bandez

-RRB-
Figne

trop
.
Whereas
no
photo
could
because
it
simply
*NL*
was
n't
art
in
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
moving
him
he
would
much
have
liked
to
follow
Jack
Tar
's
good
*NL*
example
and
leave
the
likeness
there
for
a
very
few
minutes
to
speak
for
*NL*
itself
on
the
plea
he
so
that
the
other
could
drink
in
the
beauty
for
*NL*
himself
,
her
stage
presence
being
,
frankly
,
a
treat
in
itself
which
the
*NL*
camera
could
not
at
all
do
justice
to
.
But
it
was
scarcely
professional
*NL*
etiquette
so
.
Though
it
was
a
warm
pleasant
sort
of
a
night
now
yet
*NL*
wonderfully
cool
for
the
season
considering
,
for
sunshine
after
storm
.
*NL*
And
he
did
feel
a
kind
of
need
there
and
then
to
follow
suit
like
a
*NL*
kind
of
inward
voice
and
satisfy
a
possible
need
by
moving
a
motion
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
he
sat
tight
just
viewing
the
slightly
soiled
photo
creased
*NL*
by
opulent
curves
,
none
the
worse
for
wear
however
,
and
looked
away
*NL*
thoughtfully
with
the
intention
of
not
further
increasing
the
*NL*
other
's
possible
embarrassment
while
gauging
her
symmetry
of
heaving
*NL*
_
embonpoint
_
.
In
fact
the
slight
soiling
was
only
an
added
charm
like
*NL*
the
case
of
linen
slightly
soiled
,
good
as
new
,
much
better
in
fact
*NL*
with
the
starch
out
.
Suppose
she
was
gone
when
he
?
I
looked
for
the
lamp
*NL*
which
she
told
me
came
into
his
mind
but
merely
as
a
passing
fancy
of
*NL*
his
because
he
then
recollected
the
morning
littered
bed
etcetera
and
*NL*
the
book
about
Ruby
with
met
him
pike
hoses
-LRB-
_
sic
_
-RRB-
in
it
which
must
*NL*
have
fell
down
sufficiently
appropriately
beside
the
domestic
chamberpot
*NL*
with
apologies
to
Lindley
Murray
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicinity
of
the
young
man
he
certainly
relished
,
educated
,
*NL*
_
distingue
_
and
impulsive
into
the
bargain
,
far
and
away
the
pick
of
the
*NL*
bunch
though
you
would
n't
think
he
had
it
in
him
yet
you
would
.
Besides
*NL*
he
said
the
picture
was
handsome
which
,
say
what
you
like
,
it
was
though
*NL*
at
the
moment
she
was
distinctly
stouter
.
And
why
not
?
An
awful
lot
of
*NL*
makebelieve
went
on
about
that
sort
of
thing
involving
a
lifelong
slur
*NL*
with
the
usual
splash
page
of
gutterpress
about
the
same
old
matrimonial
*NL*
tangle
alleging
misconduct
with
professional
golfer
or
the
newest
*NL*
stage
favourite
instead
of
being
honest
and
aboveboard
about
the
whole
*NL*
business
.
How
they
were
fated
to
meet
and
an
attachment
sprang
up
*NL*
between
the
two
so
that
their
names
were
coupled
in
the
public
eye
*NL*
was
told
in
court
with
letters
containing
the
habitual
mushy
and
*NL*
compromising
expressions
leaving
no
loophole
to
show
that
they
openly
*NL*
cohabited
two
or
three
times
a
week
at
some
wellknown
seaside
hotel
and
*NL*
relations
,
when
the
thing
ran
its
normal
course
,
became
in
due
course
*NL*
intimate
.
Then
the
decree
_
nisi
_
and
the
King
's
proctor
tries
to
show
*NL*
cause
why
and
,
he
failing
to
quash
it
,
_
nisi
_
was
made
absolute
.
But
as
*NL*
for
that
the
two
misdemeanants
,
wrapped
up
as
they
largely
were
in
one
*NL*
another
,
could
safely
afford
to
ignore
it
as
they
very
largely
did
till
*NL*
the
matter
was
put
in
the
hands
of
a
solicitor
who
filed
a
petition
for
*NL*
the
party
wronged
in
due
course
.
He
,
B
,
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
*NL*
close
to
Erin
's
uncrowned
king
in
the
flesh
when
the
thing
occurred
on
*NL*
the
historic
_
fracas
_
when
the
fallen
leader
's
,
who
notoriously
stuck
to
*NL*
his
guns
to
the
last
drop
even
when
clothed
in
the
mantle
of
adultery
,
*NL*
-LRB-
leader
's
-RRB-
trusty
henchmen
to
the
number
of
ten
or
a
dozen
or
*NL*
possibly
even
more
than
that
penetrated
into
the
printing
works
of
the
*NL*
_
Insuppressible
_
or
no
it
was
_
United
Ireland
_
-LRB-
a
by
no
means
by
the
*NL*
by
appropriate
appellative
-RRB-
and
broke
up
the
typecases
with
hammers
or
*NL*
something
like
that
all
on
account
of
some
scurrilous
effusions
from
*NL*
the
facile
pens
of
the
O'Brienite
scribes
at
the
usual
mudslinging
*NL*
occupation
reflecting
on
the
erstwhile
tribune
's
private
morals
.
Though
*NL*
palpably
a
radically
altered
man
he
was
still
a
commanding
figure
though
*NL*
carelessly
garbed
as
usual
with
that
look
of
settled
purpose
which
went
*NL*
a
long
way
with
the
shillyshallyers
till
they
discovered
to
their
vast
*NL*
discomfiture
that
their
idol
had
feet
of
clay
after
placing
him
upon
a
*NL*
pedestal
which
she
,
however
,
was
the
first
to
perceive
.
As
those
were
*NL*
particularly
hot
times
in
the
general
hullaballoo
Bloom
sustained
a
*NL*
minor
injury
from
a
nasty
prod
of
some
chap
's
elbow
in
the
crowd
that
*NL*
of
course
congregated
lodging
some
place
about
the
pit
of
the
stomach
,
*NL*
fortunately
not
of
a
grave
character
.
His
hat
-LRB-
Parnell
's
-RRB-
a
silk
one
was
*NL*
inadvertently
knocked
off
and
,
as
a
matter
of
strict
history
,
Bloom
was
*NL*
the
man
who
picked
it
up
in
the
crush
after
witnessing
the
occurrence
*NL*
meaning
to
return
it
to
him
-LRB-
and
return
it
to
him
he
did
with
the
utmost
*NL*
celerity
-RRB-
who
panting
and
hatless
and
whose
thoughts
were
miles
away
*NL*
from
his
hat
at
the
time
all
the
same
being
a
gentleman
born
with
a
*NL*
stake
in
the
country
he
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
having
gone
into
it
more
*NL*
for
the
kudos
of
the
thing
than
anything
else
,
what
's
bred
in
the
bone
*NL*
instilled
into
him
in
infancy
at
his
mother
's
knee
in
the
shape
of
*NL*
knowing
what
good
form
was
came
out
at
once
because
he
turned
round
to
*NL*
the
donor
and
thanked
him
with
perfect
_
aplomb
_
,
saying
:
_
Thank
you
,
*NL*
sir
_
,
though
in
a
very
different
tone
of
voice
from
the
ornament
of
the
*NL*
legal
profession
whose
headgear
Bloom
also
set
to
rights
earlier
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
day
,
history
repeating
itself
with
a
difference
,
after
*NL*
the
burial
of
a
mutual
friend
when
they
had
left
him
alone
in
his
glory
*NL*
after
the
grim
task
of
having
committed
his
remains
to
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
what
incensed
him
more
inwardly
was
the
blatant
jokes
*NL*
of
the
cabman
and
so
on
who
passed
it
all
off
as
a
jest
,
laughing
1530
*NL*
immoderately
,
pretending
to
understand
everything
,
the
why
and
the
*NL*
wherefore
,
and
in
reality
not
knowing
their
own
minds
,
it
being
a
case
*NL*
for
the
two
parties
themselves
unless
it
ensued
that
the
legitimate
*NL*
husband
happened
to
be
a
party
to
it
owing
to
some
anonymous
letter
from
*NL*
the
usual
boy
Jones
,
who
happened
to
come
across
them
at
the
crucial
*NL*
moment
in
a
loving
position
locked
in
one
another
's
arms
,
drawing
*NL*
attention
to
their
illicit
proceedings
and
leading
up
to
a
domestic
*NL*
rumpus
and
the
erring
fair
one
begging
forgiveness
of
her
lord
and
*NL*
master
upon
her
knees
and
promising
to
sever
the
connection
and
not
*NL*
receive
his
visits
any
more
if
only
the
aggrieved
husband
would
overlook
*NL*
the
matter
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
with
tears
in
her
eyes
though
*NL*
possibly
with
her
tongue
in
her
fair
cheek
at
the
same
time
as
quite
*NL*
possibly
there
were
several
others
.
He
personally
,
being
of
a
sceptical
*NL*
bias
,
believed
and
did
n't
make
the
smallest
bones
about
saying
so
either
*NL*
that
man
or
men
in
the
plural
were
always
hanging
around
on
the
waiting
*NL*
list
about
a
lady
,
even
supposing
she
was
the
best
wife
in
the
world
*NL*
and
they
got
on
fairly
well
together
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
when
,
*NL*
neglecting
her
duties
,
she
chose
to
be
tired
of
wedded
life
and
was
on
*NL*
for
a
little
flutter
in
polite
debauchery
to
press
their
attentions
on
*NL*
her
with
improper
intent
,
the
upshot
being
that
her
affections
centred
*NL*
on
another
,
the
cause
of
many
_
liaisons
_
between
still
attractive
*NL*
married
women
getting
on
for
fair
and
forty
and
younger
men
,
no
doubt
as
*NL*
several
famous
cases
of
feminine
infatuation
proved
up
to
the
hilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
thousand
pities
a
young
fellow
,
blessed
with
an
allowance
of
*NL*
brains
as
his
neighbour
obviously
was
,
should
waste
his
valuable
time
*NL*
with
profligate
women
who
might
present
him
with
a
nice
dose
to
last
him
*NL*
his
lifetime
.
In
the
nature
of
single
blessedness
he
would
one
day
take
*NL*
unto
himself
a
wife
when
Miss
Right
came
on
the
scene
but
in
the
interim
*NL*
ladies
'
society
was
a
_
conditio
sine
qua
non
_
though
he
had
the
gravest
*NL*
possible
doubts
,
not
that
he
wanted
in
the
smallest
to
pump
Stephen
*NL*
about
Miss
Ferguson
-LRB-
who
was
very
possibly
the
particular
lodestar
who
*NL*
brought
him
down
to
Irishtown
so
early
in
the
morning
-RRB-
,
as
to
whether
he
*NL*
would
find
much
satisfaction
basking
in
the
boy
and
girl
courtship
idea
*NL*
and
the
company
of
smirking
misses
without
a
penny
to
their
names
bi
or
*NL*
triweekly
with
the
orthodox
preliminary
canter
of
complimentplaying
and
*NL*
walking
out
leading
up
to
fond
lovers
'
ways
and
flowers
and
chocs
.
To
*NL*
think
of
him
house
and
homeless
,
rooked
by
some
landlady
worse
than
any
*NL*
stepmother
,
was
really
too
bad
at
his
age
.
The
queer
suddenly
things
*NL*
he
popped
out
with
attracted
the
elder
man
who
was
several
years
the
*NL*
other
's
senior
or
like
his
father
but
something
substantial
he
certainly
*NL*
ought
to
eat
even
were
it
only
an
eggflip
made
on
unadulterated
maternal
*NL*
nutriment
or
,
failing
that
,
the
homely
Humpty
Dumpty
boiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
At
what
o'clock
did
you
dine
?
he
questioned
of
the
slim
form
and
tired
*NL*
though
unwrinkled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Some
time
yesterday
,
Stephen
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yesterday
!
exclaimed
Bloom
till
he
remembered
it
was
already
tomorrow
*NL*
Friday
.
Ah
,
you
mean
it
's
after
twelve
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
day
before
yesterday
,
Stephen
said
,
improving
on
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Literally
astounded
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
Bloom
reflected
.
*NL*
Though
they
did
n't
see
eye
to
eye
in
everything
a
certain
analogy
there
*NL*
somehow
was
as
if
both
their
minds
were
travelling
,
so
to
speak
,
in
the
*NL*
one
train
of
thought
.
At
his
age
when
dabbling
in
politics
roughly
*NL*
some
score
of
years
previously
when
he
had
been
a
_
quasi
_
aspirant
to
*NL*
parliamentary
honours
in
the
Buckshot
Foster
days
he
too
recollected
in
*NL*
retrospect
-LRB-
which
was
a
source
of
keen
satisfaction
in
itself
-RRB-
he
had
*NL*
a
sneaking
regard
for
those
same
ultra
ideas
.
For
instance
when
the
*NL*
evicted
tenants
question
,
then
at
its
first
inception
,
bulked
largely
in
*NL*
people
's
mind
though
,
it
goes
without
saying
,
not
contributing
a
copper
*NL*
or
pinning
his
faith
absolutely
to
its
dictums
,
some
of
which
would
n't
*NL*
exactly
hold
water
,
he
at
the
outset
in
principle
at
all
events
was
in
*NL*
thorough
sympathy
with
peasant
possession
as
voicing
the
trend
of
modern
*NL*
opinion
-LRB-
a
partiality
,
however
,
which
,
realising
his
mistake
,
he
was
*NL*
subsequently
partially
cured
of
-RRB-
and
even
was
twitted
with
going
a
*NL*
step
farther
than
Michael
Davitt
in
the
striking
views
he
at
one
time
*NL*
inculcated
as
a
backtothelander
,
which
was
one
reason
he
strongly
*NL*
resented
the
innuendo
put
upon
him
in
so
barefaced
a
fashion
by
our
*NL*
friend
at
the
gathering
of
the
clans
in
Barney
Kiernan
's
so
that
he
,
*NL*
though
often
considerably
misunderstood
and
the
least
pugnacious
of
*NL*
mortals
,
be
it
repeated
,
departed
from
his
customary
habit
to
give
*NL*
him
-LRB-
metaphorically
-RRB-
one
in
the
gizzard
though
,
so
far
as
politics
*NL*
themselves
were
concerned
,
he
was
only
too
conscious
of
the
casualties
*NL*
invariably
resulting
from
propaganda
and
displays
of
mutual
animosity
*NL*
and
the
misery
and
suffering
it
entailed
as
a
foregone
conclusion
on
*NL*
fine
young
fellows
,
chiefly
,
destruction
of
the
fittest
,
in
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
upon
weighing
up
the
pros
and
cons
,
getting
on
for
one
,
as
it
*NL*
was
,
it
was
high
time
to
be
retiring
for
the
night
.
The
crux
was
it
*NL*
was
a
bit
risky
to
bring
him
home
as
eventualities
might
possibly
ensue
*NL*
-LRB-
somebody
having
a
temper
of
her
own
sometimes
-RRB-
and
spoil
the
hash
*NL*
altogether
as
on
the
night
he
misguidedly
brought
home
a
dog
-LRB-
breed
*NL*
unknown
-RRB-
with
a
lame
paw
-LRB-
not
that
the
cases
were
either
identical
or
*NL*
the
reverse
though
he
had
hurt
his
hand
too
-RRB-
to
Ontario
Terrace
as
he
*NL*
very
distinctly
remembered
,
having
been
there
,
so
to
speak
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
it
was
altogether
far
and
away
too
late
for
the
Sandymount
*NL*
or
Sandycove
suggestion
so
that
he
was
in
some
perplexity
as
to
which
of
*NL*
the
two
alternatives
.
Everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
it
behoved
him
*NL*
to
avail
himself
to
the
full
of
the
opportunity
,
all
things
considered
.
*NL*
His
initial
impression
was
he
was
a
shade
standoffish
or
not
over
*NL*
effusive
but
it
grew
on
him
someway
.
For
one
thing
he
might
n't
what
you
*NL*
call
jump
at
the
idea
,
if
approached
,
and
what
mostly
worried
him
was
*NL*
he
did
n't
know
how
to
lead
up
to
it
or
word
it
exactly
,
supposing
he
*NL*
did
entertain
the
proposal
,
as
it
would
afford
him
very
great
personal
*NL*
pleasure
if
he
would
allow
him
to
help
to
put
coin
in
his
way
or
some
*NL*
wardrobe
,
if
found
suitable
.
At
all
events
he
wound
up
by
concluding
,
*NL*
eschewing
for
the
nonce
hidebound
precedent
,
a
cup
of
Epps
's
cocoa
and
*NL*
a
shakedown
for
the
night
plus
the
use
of
a
rug
or
two
and
overcoat
*NL*
doubled
into
a
pillow
at
least
he
would
be
in
safe
hands
and
as
warm
as
*NL*
a
toast
on
a
trivet
he
failed
to
perceive
any
very
vast
amount
of
harm
*NL*
in
that
always
with
the
proviso
no
rumpus
of
any
sort
was
kicked
up
.
*NL*
A
move
had
to
be
made
because
that
merry
old
soul
,
the
grasswidower
*NL*
in
question
who
appeared
to
be
glued
to
the
spot
,
did
n't
appear
in
any
*NL*
particular
hurry
to
wend
his
way
home
to
his
dearly
beloved
Queenstown
*NL*
and
it
was
highly
likely
some
sponger
's
bawdyhouse
of
retired
beauties
*NL*
where
age
was
no
bar
off
Sheriff
street
lower
would
be
the
best
clue
*NL*
to
that
equivocal
character
's
whereabouts
for
a
few
days
to
come
,
*NL*
alternately
racking
their
feelings
-LRB-
the
mermaids
'
-RRB-
with
sixchamber
*NL*
revolver
anecdotes
verging
on
the
tropical
calculated
to
freeze
*NL*
the
marrow
of
anybody
's
bones
and
mauling
their
largesized
charms
*NL*
betweenwhiles
with
rough
and
tumble
gusto
to
the
accompaniment
of
large
*NL*
potations
of
potheen
and
the
usual
blarney
about
himself
for
as
to
who
*NL*
he
in
reality
was
let
x
equal
my
right
name
and
address
,
as
Mr
Algebra
*NL*
remarks
_
passim
_
.
At
the
same
time
he
inwardly
chuckled
over
his
gentle
*NL*
repartee
to
the
blood
and
ouns
champion
about
his
god
being
a
jew
.
*NL*
People
could
put
up
with
being
bitten
by
a
wolf
but
what
properly
riled
*NL*
them
was
a
bite
from
a
sheep
.
The
most
vulnerable
point
too
of
tender
*NL*
Achilles
.
Your
god
was
a
jew
.
Because
mostly
they
appeared
to
imagine
he
*NL*
came
from
Carrick-on-Shannon
or
somewhereabouts
in
the
county
Sligo
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
propose
,
our
hero
eventually
suggested
after
mature
reflection
while
*NL*
prudently
pocketing
her
photo
,
as
it
's
rather
stuffy
here
you
just
come
*NL*
home
with
me
and
talk
things
over
.
My
diggings
are
quite
close
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
.
You
ca
n't
drink
that
stuff
.
Do
you
like
cocoa
?
Wait
.
I
'll
just
*NL*
pay
this
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
plan
clearly
being
to
clear
out
,
the
remainder
being
plain
*NL*
sailing
,
he
beckoned
,
while
prudently
pocketing
the
photo
,
to
the
keeper
*NL*
of
the
shanty
who
did
n't
seem
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
that
's
the
best
,
he
assured
Stephen
to
whom
for
the
matter
of
*NL*
that
Brazen
Head
or
him
or
anywhere
else
was
all
more
or
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
kinds
of
Utopian
plans
were
flashing
through
his
-LRB-
B
's
-RRB-
busy
brain
,
*NL*
education
-LRB-
the
genuine
article
-RRB-
,
literature
,
journalism
,
prize
titbits
,
*NL*
up
to
date
billing
,
concert
tours
in
English
watering
resorts
packed
*NL*
with
hydros
and
seaside
theatres
,
turning
money
away
,
duets
in
Italian
*NL*
with
the
accent
perfectly
true
to
nature
and
a
quantity
of
other
*NL*
things
,
no
necessity
,
of
course
,
to
tell
the
world
and
his
wife
from
the
*NL*
housetops
about
it
,
and
a
slice
of
luck
.
An
opening
was
all
was
wanted
.
*NL*
Because
he
more
than
suspected
he
had
his
father
's
voice
to
bank
his
*NL*
hopes
on
which
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
he
had
so
it
would
be
just
as
*NL*
well
,
by
the
way
no
harm
,
to
trail
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
that
particular
red
herring
just
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabby
read
out
of
the
paper
he
had
got
hold
of
that
the
former
*NL*
viceroy
,
earl
Cadogan
,
had
presided
at
the
cabdrivers
'
association
*NL*
dinner
in
London
somewhere
.
Silence
with
a
yawn
or
two
accompanied
this
*NL*
thrilling
announcement
.
Then
the
old
specimen
in
the
corner
who
appeared
*NL*
to
have
some
spark
of
vitality
left
read
out
that
sir
Anthony
MacDonnell
*NL*
had
left
Euston
for
the
chief
secretary
's
lodge
or
words
to
that
effect
.
*NL*
To
which
absorbing
piece
of
intelligence
echo
answered
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Give
us
a
squint
at
that
literature
,
grandfather
,
the
ancient
mariner
*NL*
put
in
,
manifesting
some
natural
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
welcome
,
answered
the
elderly
party
thus
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sailor
lugged
out
from
a
case
he
had
a
pair
of
greenish
goggles
*NL*
which
he
very
slowly
hooked
over
his
nose
and
both
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Are
you
bad
in
the
eyes
?
the
sympathetic
personage
like
the
townclerk
*NL*
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
answered
the
seafarer
with
the
tartan
beard
,
who
seemingly
was
*NL*
a
bit
of
a
literary
cove
in
his
own
small
way
,
staring
out
of
seagreen
*NL*
portholes
as
you
might
well
describe
them
as
,
I
uses
goggles
reading
.
*NL*
Sand
in
the
Red
Sea
done
that
.
One
time
I
could
read
a
book
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
manner
of
speaking
.
_
The
Arabian
Nights
Entertainment

was
my
favourite
*NL*
and
_
Red
as
a
Rose
is
She
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
he
pawed
the
journal
open
and
pored
upon
Lord
only
knows
what
,
*NL*
found
drowned
or
the
exploits
of
King
Willow
,
Iremonger
having
made
a
*NL*
hundred
and
something
second
wicket
not
out
for
Notts
,
during
which
*NL*
time
-LRB-
completely
regardless
of
Ire
-RRB-
the
keeper
was
intensely
occupied
*NL*
loosening
an
apparently
new
or
secondhand
boot
which
manifestly
pinched
*NL*
him
as
he
muttered
against
whoever
it
was
sold
it
,
all
of
them
who
were
*NL*
sufficiently
awake
enough
to
be
picked
out
by
their
facial
expressions
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
either
simply
looking
on
glumly
or
passing
a
trivial
*NL*
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
cut
a
long
story
short
Bloom
,
grasping
the
situation
,
was
the
first
*NL*
to
rise
from
his
seat
so
as
not
to
outstay
their
welcome
having
first
*NL*
and
foremost
,
being
as
good
as
his
word
that
he
would
foot
the
bill
for
*NL*
the
occasion
,
taken
the
wise
precaution
to
unobtrusively
motion
to
mine
*NL*
host
as
a
parting
shot
a
scarcely
perceptible
sign
when
the
others
were
*NL*
not
looking
to
the
effect
that
the
amount
due
was
forthcoming
,
making
a
*NL*
grand
total
of
fourpence
-LRB-
the
amount
he
deposited
unobtrusively
in
*NL*
four
coppers
,
literally
the
last
of
the
Mohicans
-RRB-
,
he
having
previously
*NL*
spotted
on
the
printed
pricelist
for
all
who
ran
to
read
opposite
him
*NL*
in
unmistakable
figures
,
coffee
2d
,
confectionery
do
,
and
honestly
well
*NL*
worth
twice
the
money
once
in
a
way
,
as
Wetherup
used
to
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Come
,
he
counselled
to
close
the
_
seance
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
the
ruse
worked
and
the
coast
was
clear
they
left
the
*NL*
shelter
or
shanty
together
and
the
_
elite
_
society
of
oilskin
and
*NL*
company
whom
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
would
move
out
of
their
*NL*
_
dolce
far
niente
_
.
Stephen
,
who
confessed
to
still
feeling
poorly
and
*NL*
fagged
out
,
paused
at
the
,
for
a
moment
,
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
thing
I
never
understood
,
he
said
to
be
original
on
the
spur
of
*NL*
the
moment
.
Why
they
put
tables
upside
down
at
night
,
I
mean
chairs
*NL*
upside
down
,
on
the
tables
in
cafes
.
To
which
impromptu
the
neverfailing
*NL*
Bloom
replied
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
saying
straight
off
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
sweep
the
floor
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
he
skipped
around
,
nimbly
considering
,
frankly
at
the
same
*NL*
time
apologetic
to
get
on
his
companion
's
right
,
a
habit
of
his
,
by
the
*NL*
bye
,
his
right
side
being
,
in
classical
idiom
,
his
tender
Achilles
.
The
*NL*
night
air
was
certainly
now
a
treat
to
breathe
though
Stephen
was
a
bit
*NL*
weak
on
his
pins
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
will
-LRB-
the
air
-RRB-
do
you
good
,
Bloom
said
,
meaning
also
the
walk
,
in
*NL*
a
moment
.
The
only
thing
is
to
walk
then
you
'll
feel
a
different
man
.
*NL*
Come
.
It
's
not
far
.
Lean
on
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
he
passed
his
left
arm
in
Stephen
's
right
and
led
him
on
*NL*
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Stephen
said
uncertainly
because
he
thought
he
felt
a
strange
*NL*
kind
of
flesh
of
a
different
man
approach
him
,
sinewless
and
wobbly
and
*NL*
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyhow
they
passed
the
sentrybox
with
stones
,
brazier
etc.
where
*NL*
the
municipal
supernumerary
,
ex
Gumley
,
was
still
to
all
intents
and
*NL*
purposes
wrapped
in
the
arms
of
Murphy
,
as
the
adage
has
it
,
dreaming
*NL*
of
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
.
And
_
apropos
_
of
coffin
of
stones
the
*NL*
analogy
was
not
at
all
bad
as
it
was
in
fact
a
stoning
to
death
on
the
*NL*
part
of
seventytwo
out
of
eighty
odd
constituencies
that
ratted
at
the
*NL*
time
of
the
split
and
chiefly
the
belauded
peasant
class
,
probably
the
*NL*
selfsame
evicted
tenants
he
had
put
in
their
holdings
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
turned
on
to
chatting
about
music
,
a
form
of
art
for
which
*NL*
Bloom
,
as
a
pure
amateur
,
possessed
the
greatest
love
,
as
they
made
*NL*
tracks
arm
in
arm
across
Beresford
place
.
Wagnerian
music
,
though
*NL*
confessedly
grand
in
its
way
,
was
a
bit
too
heavy
for
Bloom
and
hard
to
*NL*
follow
at
the
first
go-off
but
the
music
of
Mercadante
's
_
Huguenots
_
,
*NL*
Meyerbeer
's
_
Seven
Last
Words
on
the
Cross
_
and
Mozart
's
_
Twelfth
Mass
_
*NL*
he
simply
revelled
in
,
the
_
Gloria
_
in
that
being
,
to
his
mind
,
the
acme
*NL*
of
first
class
music
as
such
,
literally
knocking
everything
else
into
*NL*
a
cocked
hat
.
He
infinitely
preferred
the
sacred
music
of
the
catholic
*NL*
church
to
anything
the
opposite
shop
could
offer
in
that
line
such
as
*NL*
those
Moody
and
Sankey
hymns
or
_
Bid
me
to
live
and
i
will
live
*NL*
thy
protestant
to
be
_
.
He
also
yielded
to
none
in
his
admiration
of
*NL*
Rossini
's
_
Stabat
Mater
_
,
a
work
simply
abounding
in
immortal
numbers
,
*NL*
in
which
his
wife
,
Madam
Marion
Tweedy
,
made
a
hit
,
a
veritable
*NL*
sensation
,
he
might
safely
say
,
greatly
adding
to
her
other
laureis
and
*NL*
putting
the
others
totally
in
the
shade
,
in
the
jesuit
fathers
'
church
*NL*
in
upper
Gardiner
street
,
the
sacred
edifice
being
thronged
to
the
*NL*
doors
to
hear
her
with
virtuosos
,
or
_
virtuosi
_
rather
.
There
was
the
*NL*
unanimous
opinion
that
there
was
none
to
come
up
to
her
and
suffice
it
*NL*
to
say
in
a
place
of
worship
for
music
of
a
sacred
character
there
was
*NL*
a
generally
voiced
desire
for
an
encore
.
On
the
whole
though
favouring
*NL*
preferably
light
opera
of
the
_
Don
Giovanni
_
description
and
_
Martha
_
,
*NL*
a
gem
in
its
line
,
he
had
a
_
penchant
_
,
though
with
only
a
surface
*NL*
knowledge
,
for
the
severe
classical
school
such
as
Mendelssohn
.
And
*NL*
talking
of
that
,
taking
it
for
granted
he
knew
all
about
the
old
*NL*
favourites
,
he
mentioned
_
par
excellence
_
Lionel
's
air
in
_
Martha
,
*NL*
M'appari
_
,
which
,
curiously
enough
,
he
had
heard
or
overheard
,
to
be
*NL*
more
accurate
,
on
yesterday
,
a
privilege
he
keenly
appreciated
,
from
the
*NL*
lips
of
Stephen
's
respected
father
,
sung
to
perfection
,
a
study
of
the
*NL*
number
,
in
fact
,
which
made
all
the
others
take
a
back
seat
.
Stephen
,
in
*NL*
reply
to
a
politely
put
query
,
said
he
did
n't
sing
it
but
launched
*NL*
out
into
praises
of
Shakespeare
's
songs
,
at
least
of
in
or
about
that
*NL*
period
,
the
lutenist
Dowland
who
lived
in
Fetter
lane
near
Gerard
the
*NL*
herbalist
,
who
_
anno
ludendo
hausi
,
Doulandus
_
,
an
instrument
he
was
*NL*
contemplating
purchasing
from
Mr
Arnold
Dolmetsch
,
whom
B.
did
not
quite
*NL*
recall
though
the
name
certainly
sounded
familiar
,
for
sixtyfive
guineas
*NL*
and
Farnaby
and
son
with
their
_
dux
_
and
_
comes
_
conceits
and
Byrd
*NL*
-LRB-
William
-RRB-
who
played
the
virginals
,
he
said
,
in
the
Queen
's
chapel
or
*NL*
anywhere
else
he
found
them
and
one
Tomkins
who
made
toys
or
airs
and
*NL*
John
Bull
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
roadway
which
they
were
approaching
whilst
still
speaking
beyond
*NL*
the
swingchains
a
horse
,
dragging
a
sweeper
,
paced
on
the
paven
ground
,
*NL*
brushing
a
long
swathe
of
mire
up
so
that
with
the
noise
Bloom
was
not
*NL*
perfectly
certain
whether
he
had
caught
aright
the
allusion
to
sixtyfive
*NL*
guineas
and
John
Bull
.
He
inquired
if
it
was
John
Bull
the
political
*NL*
celebrity
of
that
ilk
,
as
it
struck
him
,
the
two
identical
names
,
as
a
*NL*
striking
coincidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
chains
the
horse
slowly
swerved
to
turn
,
which
perceiving
,
Bloom
,
*NL*
who
was
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
as
usual
,
plucked
the
other
's
sleeve
*NL*
gently
,
jocosely
remarking
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Our
lives
are
in
peril
tonight
.
Beware
of
the
steamroller
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
thereupon
stopped
.
Bloom
looked
at
the
head
of
a
horse
not
worth
*NL*
anything
like
sixtyfive
guineas
,
suddenly
in
evidence
in
the
dark
quite
*NL*
near
so
that
it
seemed
new
,
a
different
grouping
of
bones
and
even
flesh
*NL*
because
palpably
it
was
a
fourwalker
,
a
hipshaker
,
a
blackbuttocker
,
a
*NL*
taildangler
,
a
headhanger
putting
his
hind
foot
foremost
the
while
the
*NL*
lord
of
his
creation
sat
on
the
perch
,
busy
with
his
thoughts
.
But
such
*NL*
a
good
poor
brute
he
was
sorry
he
had
n't
a
lump
of
sugar
but
,
as
he
*NL*
wisely
reflected
,
you
could
scarcely
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
*NL*
that
might
crop
up
.
He
was
just
a
big
nervous
foolish
noodly
kind
of
a
*NL*
horse
,
without
a
second
care
in
the
world
.
But
even
a
dog
,
he
reflected
,
*NL*
take
that
mongrel
in
Barney
Kiernan
's
,
of
the
same
size
,
would
be
a
holy
*NL*
horror
to
face
.
But
it
was
no
animal
's
fault
in
particular
if
he
was
*NL*
built
that
way
like
the
camel
,
ship
of
the
desert
,
distilling
grapes
*NL*
into
potheen
in
his
hump
.
Nine
tenths
of
them
all
could
be
caged
or
*NL*
trained
,
nothing
beyond
the
art
of
man
barring
the
bees
.
Whale
with
a
*NL*
harpoon
hairpin
,
alligator
tickle
the
small
of
his
back
and
he
sees
the
*NL*
joke
,
chalk
a
circle
for
a
rooster
,
tiger
my
eagle
eye
.
These
timely
*NL*
reflections
anent
the
brutes
of
the
field
occupied
his
mind
somewhat
*NL*
distracted
from
Stephen
's
words
while
the
ship
of
the
street
was
*NL*
manoeuvring
and
Stephen
went
on
about
the
highly
interesting
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
's
this
I
was
saying
?
Ah
,
yes
!
My
wife
,
he
intimated
,
plunging
*NL*
_
in
medias
res
_
,
would
have
the
greatest
of
pleasure
in
making
your
*NL*
acquaintance
as
she
is
passionately
attached
to
music
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
sideways
in
a
friendly
fashion
at
the
sideface
of
Stephen
,
*NL*
image
of
his
mother
,
which
was
not
quite
the
same
as
the
usual
handsome
*NL*
blackguard
type
they
unquestionably
had
an
insatiable
hankering
after
as
*NL*
he
was
perhaps
not
that
way
built
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
supposing
he
had
his
father
's
gift
as
he
more
than
suspected
,
*NL*
it
opened
up
new
vistas
in
his
mind
such
as
Lady
Fingall
's
Irish
*NL*
industries
,
concert
on
the
preceding
Monday
,
and
aristocracy
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exquisite
variations
he
was
now
describing
on
an
air
_
Youth
here
has
*NL*
End
_
by
Jans
Pieter
Sweelinck
,
a
Dutchman
of
Amsterdam
where
the
frows
*NL*
come
from
.
Even
more
he
liked
an
old
German
song
of
_
Johannes
Jeep
_
*NL*
about
the
clear
sea
and
the
voices
of
sirens
,
sweet
murderers
of
men
,
*NL*
which
boggled
Bloom
a
bit
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Von
der
Sirenen
Listigkeit
*NL*
Tun
die
Poeten
dichten
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
These
opening
bars
he
sang
and
translated
_
extempore
_
.
Bloom
,
nodding
,
*NL*
said
he
perfectly
understood
and
begged
him
to
go
on
by
all
means
which
*NL*
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
phenomenally
beautiful
tenor
voice
like
that
,
the
rarest
of
boons
,
*NL*
which
Bloom
appreciated
at
the
very
first
note
he
got
out
,
could
easily
,
*NL*
if
properly
handled
by
some
recognised
authority
on
voice
production
*NL*
such
as
Barraclough
and
being
able
to
read
music
into
the
bargain
,
*NL*
command
its
own
price
where
baritones
were
ten
a
penny
and
procure
for
*NL*
its
fortunate
possessor
in
the
near
future
an
_
entree
_
into
fashionable
*NL*
houses
in
the
best
residential
quarters
of
financial
magnates
in
a
large
*NL*
way
of
business
and
titled
people
where
with
his
university
degree
of
*NL*
B.
A.
-LRB-
a
huge
ad
in
its
way
-RRB-
and
gentlemanly
bearing
to
all
the
more
*NL*
influence
the
good
impression
he
would
infallibly
score
a
distinct
*NL*
success
,
being
blessed
with
brains
which
also
could
be
utilised
for
the
*NL*
purpose
and
other
requisites
,
if
his
clothes
were
properly
attended
*NL*
to
so
as
to
the
better
worm
his
way
into
their
good
graces
as
he
,
a
*NL*
youthful
tyro
in
--
society
's
sartorial
niceties
,
hardly
understood
how
a
*NL*
little
thing
like
that
could
militate
against
you
.
It
was
in
fact
only
a
*NL*
matter
of
months
and
he
could
easily
foresee
him
participating
in
their
*NL*
musical
and
artistic
_
conversaziones
_
during
the
festivities
of
the
*NL*
Christmas
season
,
for
choice
,
causing
a
slight
flutter
in
the
dovecotes
*NL*
of
the
fair
sex
and
being
made
a
lot
of
by
ladies
out
for
sensation
,
*NL*
cases
of
which
,
as
he
happened
to
know
,
were
on
record
--
in
fact
,
without
*NL*
giving
the
show
away
,
he
himself
once
upon
a
time
,
if
he
cared
to
,
could
*NL*
easily
have
.
Added
to
which
of
course
would
be
the
pecuniary
emolument
*NL*
by
no
means
to
be
sneezed
at
,
going
hand
in
hand
with
his
tuition
*NL*
fees
.
Not
,
he
parenthesised
,
that
for
the
sake
of
filthy
lucre
he
need
*NL*
necessarily
embrace
the
lyric
platform
as
a
walk
in
life
for
any
lengthy
*NL*
space
of
time
.
But
a
step
in
the
required
direction
it
was
beyond
yea
or
*NL*
nay
and
both
monetarily
and
mentally
it
contained
no
reflection
on
his
*NL*
dignity
in
the
smallest
and
it
often
turned
in
uncommonly
handy
to
*NL*
be
handed
a
cheque
at
a
muchneeded
moment
when
every
little
helped
.
*NL*
Besides
,
though
taste
latterly
had
deteriorated
to
a
degree
,
original
*NL*
music
like
that
,
different
from
the
conventional
rut
,
would
rapidly
*NL*
have
a
great
vogue
as
it
would
be
a
decided
novelty
for
Dublin
's
musical
*NL*
world
after
the
usual
hackneyed
run
of
catchy
tenor
solos
foisted
on
a
*NL*
confiding
public
by
Ivan
St
Austell
and
Hilton
St
Just
and
their
_
genus
*NL*
omne
_
.
Yes
,
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
could
with
all
the
cards
in
*NL*
his
hand
and
he
had
a
capital
opening
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
win
*NL*
a
high
place
in
the
city
's
esteem
where
he
could
command
a
stiff
figure
*NL*
and
,
booking
ahead
,
give
a
grand
concert
for
the
patrons
of
the
King
*NL*
street
house
,
given
a
backerup
,
if
one
were
forthcoming
to
kick
him
*NL*
upstairs
,
so
to
speak
,
a
big
_
if
_
,
however
,
with
some
impetus
of
the
*NL*
goahead
sort
to
obviate
the
inevitable
procrastination
which
often
*NL*
tripped-up
a
too
much
feted
prince
of
good
fellows
.
And
it
need
not
*NL*
detract
from
the

by

as
,
being
his
own
master
,
he
would
*NL*
have
heaps
of
time
to
practise
literature
in
his
spare
moments
when
*NL*
desirous
of
so
doing
without
its
clashing
with
his
vocal
career
or
*NL*
containing
anything
derogatory
whatsoever
as
it
was
a
matter
for
himself
*NL*
alone
.
In
fact
,
he
had
the
ball
at
his
feet
and
that
was
the
very
reason
*NL*
why
the
other
,
possessed
of
a
remarkably
sharp
nose
for
smelling
a
rat
*NL*
of
any
sort
,
hung
on
to
him
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
was
just
then
.
And
later
on
at
a
propitious
opportunity
he
*NL*
purposed
-LRB-
Bloom
did
-RRB-
,
without
anyway
prying
into
his
private
affairs
on
*NL*
the
_
fools
step
in
where
angels
_
principle
,
advising
him
to
sever
his
*NL*
connection
with
a
certain
budding
practitioner
who
,
he
noticed
,
was
*NL*
prone
to
disparage
and
even
to
a
slight
extent
with
some
hilarious
*NL*
pretext
when
not
present
,
deprecate
him
,
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
*NL*
which
in
Bloom
's
humble
opinion
threw
a
nasty
sidelight
on
that
side
of
*NL*
a
person
's
character
,
no
pun
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
having
reached
the
end
of
his
tether
,
so
to
speak
,
halted
and
,
*NL*
rearing
high
a
proud
feathering
tail
,
added
his
quota
by
letting
fall
on
*NL*
the
floor
which
the
brush
would
soon
brush
up
and
polish
,
three
smoking
*NL*
globes
of
turds
.
Slowly
three
times
,
one
after
another
,
from
a
full
*NL*
crupper
he
mired
.
And
humanely
his
driver
waited
till
he
-LRB-
or
she
-RRB-
had
*NL*
ended
,
patient
in
his
scythed
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
Side
by
side
Bloom
,
profiting
by
the
_
contretemps
_
,
with
Stephen
passed
*NL*
through
the
gap
of
the
chains
,
divided
by
the
upright
,
and
,
stepping
*NL*
over
a
strand
of
mire
,
went
across
towards
Gardiner
street
lower
,
*NL*
Stephen
singing
more
boldly
,
but
not
loudly
,
the
end
of
the
ballad

The
driver
never
said
a
word
,
good
,
bad
or
indifferent
,
but
merely
*NL*
watched
the
two
figures
,
as
he
sat
on
his
lowbacked
car
,
both
black
,
*NL*
one
full
,
one

towards
the
railway
bridge
,
_
to
be
married
by
*NL*
Father
Maher

.
As
they
walked
they
at
times
stopped
and
walked
again
*NL*
continuing
their
_
tete-a-tete
_
-LRB-
which
,
of
course
,
he
was
utterly
out
*NL*
of
-RRB-
about
sirens
enemies
of
man
's
reason
,
mingled
with
a
number
of
other
*NL*
topics
of
the
same
category
,
usurpers
,
historical
cases
of
the
kind
*NL*
while
the
man
in
the
sweeper
car
or
you
might
as
well
call
it
in
the
*NL*
sleeper
car
who
in
any
case
could
n't
possibly
hear
because
they
were
too
*NL*
far
simply
sat
in
his
seat
near
the
end
of
lower
Gardiner
street
_
and
*NL*
looked
after
their
lowbacked
car
_
.

*NL*
*NL*
What
parallel
courses
did
Bloom
and
Stephen
follow
returning
?
*NL*
*NL*
Starting
united
both
at
normal
walking
pace
from
Beresford
place
they
*NL*
followed
in
the
order
named
Lower
and
Middle
Gardiner
streets
and
*NL*
Mountjoy
square
,
west
:
then
,
at
reduced
pace
,
each
bearing
left
,
*NL*
Gardiner
's
place
by
an
inadvertence
as
far
as
the
farther
corner
of
*NL*
Temple
street
:
then
,
at
reduced
pace
with
interruptions
of
halt
,
bearing
*NL*
right
,
Temple
street
,
north
,
as
far
as
Hardwicke
place
.
Approaching
,
*NL*
disparate
,
at
relaxed
walking
pace
they
crossed
both
the
circus
before
*NL*
George
's
church
diametrically
,
the
chord
in
any
circle
being
less
than
*NL*
the
arc
which
it
subtends
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
did
the
duumvirate
deliberate
during
their
itinerary
?
*NL*
*NL*
Music
,
literature
,
Ireland
,
Dublin
,
Paris
,
friendship
,
woman
,
*NL*
prostitution

,
the

,
the

,
the
maleficent
influence
of
the
*NL*
presabbath
,
Stephen
's
collapse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Bloom
discover
common
factors
of
similarity
between
their
respective
*NL*
like
and
unlike
reactions
to
experience
?
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
sensitive
to
artistic
impressions
,
musical
in
preference
to
*NL*
plastic
or
pictorial
.
Both
preferred
a
continental
to
an
insular
manner
*NL*
of
life
,
a
cisatlantic
to
a
transatlantic
place
of
residence
.
Both
*NL*
indurated
by
early
domestic
training
and
an
inherited
tenacity
of
*NL*
heterodox
resistance
professed
their
disbelief
in
many
orthodox
*NL*
religious
,
national
,
social
and
ethical
doctrines
.
Both
admitted
*NL*
the
alternately
stimulating
and
obtunding
influence
of
heterosexual
*NL*
magnetism
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Were
their
views
on
some
points
divergent
?
*NL*
*NL*
Stephen
dissented
openly
from
Bloom
's
views
on
the
importance
of
dietary
*NL*
and
civic
selfhelp
while
Bloom
dissented
tacitly
from
Stephen
's
views
*NL*
on
the
eternal
affirmation
of
the
spirit
of
man
in
literature
.
Bloom
*NL*
assented
covertly
to
Stephen
's
rectification
of
the
anachronism
*NL*
involved
in
assigning
the
date
of
the
conversion
of
the
Irish
nation
to
*NL*
christianity
from
druidism
by
Patrick
son
of
Calpornus
,
son
of
Potitus
,
*NL*
son
of
Odyssus
,
sent
by
pope
Celestine
I
in
the

in
the
reign
of
*NL*
Leary
to
the

260
or
thereabouts
in
the
reign
of
Cormac
MacArt
-LRB-
died
*NL*
266
A.D.
-RRB-
,
suffocated
by
imperfect
deglutition
of
aliment
at
Sletty
*NL*
and
interred
at
Rossnaree
.
The
collapse
which
Bloom
ascribed
to
*NL*
gastric
inanition
and
certain
chemical
compounds
of
varying
degrees
of
*NL*
adulteration
and
alcoholic
strength
,
accelerated
by
mental
exertion
and
*NL*
the
velocity
of
rapid
circular
motion
in
a
relaxing
atmosphere
,
Stephen
*NL*
attributed
to
the
reapparition
of
a
matutinal
cloud
-LRB-
perceived
by
both
*NL*
from
two
different
points
of
observation
Sandycove
and
Dublin
-RRB-
at
first
*NL*
no
bigger
than
a
woman
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
one
point
on
which
their
views
were
equal
and
negative
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
influence
of
gaslight
or
electric
light
on
the
growth
of
adjoining
*NL*
paraheliotropic
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Bloom
discussed
similar
subjects
during
nocturnal
perambulations
in
*NL*
the
past
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
1884
with
Owen
Goldberg
and
Cecil
Turnbull
at
night
on
public
*NL*
thoroughfares
between
Longwood
avenue
and
Leonard
's
corner
and
Leonard
's
*NL*
corner
and
Synge
street
and
Synge
street
and
Bloomfield
avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1885
with
Percy
Apjohn
in
the
evenings
,
reclined
against
the
wall
*NL*
between
Gibraltar
villa
and
Bloomfield
house
in
Crumlin
,
barony
*NL*
of
Uppercross
.
In
1886
occasionally
with
casual
acquaintances
and
*NL*
prospective
purchasers
on
doorsteps
,
in
front
parlours
,
in
third
class
*NL*
railway
carriages
of
suburban
lines
.
In
1888
frequently
with
major
Brian
*NL*
Tweedy
and
his
daughter
Miss
Marion
Tweedy
,
together
and
separately
on
*NL*
the
lounge
in
Matthew
Dillon
's
house
in
Roundtown
.
Once
in
1892
and
once
*NL*
in
1893
with
Julius
-LRB-
Juda
-RRB-
Mastiansky
,
on
both
occasions
in
the
parlour
*NL*
of
his
-LRB-
Bloom

-RRB-
house
in
Lombard
street
,

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
reflection
concerning
the
irregular
sequence
of
dates
1884
,
1885
,
*NL*
1886
,
1888
,
1892
,
1893
,
1904
did
Bloom
make
before
their
arrival
at
*NL*
their
destination
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
that
the
progressive
extension
of
the
field
of
individual
*NL*
development
and
experience
was
regressively
accompanied
by
a
restriction
*NL*
of
the
converse
domain
of
interindividual
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
in
what
ways
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
inexistence
to
existence
he
came
to
many
and
was
as
one
received
:
*NL*
existence
with
existence
he
was
with
any
as
any
with
any
:
from
existence
*NL*
to
nonexistence
gone
he
would
be
by
all
as
none
perceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
act
did
Bloom
make
on
their
arrival
at
their
destination
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
housesteps
of
the
4th
Of
the
equidifferent
uneven
numbers
,
number
*NL*
7
Eccles
street
,
he
inserted
his
hand
mechanically
into
the
back
pocket
*NL*
of
his
trousers
to
obtain
his
latchkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
corresponding
pocket
of
the
trousers
which
he
had
worn
on
*NL*
the
day
but
one
preceding
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
was
he
doubly
irritated
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
he
had
forgotten
and
because
he
remembered
that
he
had
reminded
*NL*
himself
twice
not
to
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
then
the
alternatives
before
the
,
premeditatedly
*NL*
-LRB-
respectively
-RRB-
and
inadvertently
,
keyless
couple
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
enter
or
not

To
knock

*NL*
*NL*
Bloom
's
decision
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
stratagem
.
Resting
his
feet
on
the
dwarf
wall
,
he
climbed
over
the
*NL*
area
railings
,
compressed
his
hat
on
his
head
,
grasped
two
points
at
*NL*
the
lower
union
of
rails
and
stiles
,
lowered
his
body
gradually
by
its
*NL*
length
of
five
feet
nine
inches
and
a
half
to
within
two
feet
ten
inches
*NL*
of
the

pavement
and
allowed
his
body
to
move
freely
in

by
*NL*
separating
himself
from
the
railings
and
crouching
in
preparation
for
*NL*
the
impact
of
the
fall
.

*NL*
*NL*
Did
he
fall

Regaining

he
rose
uninjured

the

raised

by

at

gained

ignited

set

inflammable

lit
a

which
,
*NL*
by
regulating

he
reduced
to
quiescent
candescence
and
lit
finally
a
*NL*
portable
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
discrete
succession
of
images
did
Stephen
meanwhile
perceive
?
*NL*
*NL*
Reclined
against
the
area
railings
he
perceived
through
the
transparent
*NL*
kitchen
panes
a
man
regulating
a
gasflame
of
14
CP
,
a
man
lighting
a
*NL*
candle
of

,
a
man
removing
in

each

his
two
boots
,
a
man
*NL*
leaving
the
kitchen
holding
a
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
the
man
reappear
elsewhere
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
lapse
of
four
minutes
the
glimmer
of
his
candle
was
discernible
*NL*
through
the
semitransparent
semicircular
glass
fanlight
over
the
*NL*
halldoor
.
The
halldoor
turned
gradually
on
its
hinges
.
In
the
open
space
*NL*
of
the
doorway
the
man
reappeared
without
his
hat
,
with
his
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Stephen
obey
his
sign
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
entering
softly
,
he
helped
to
close
and
chain
the
door
and
followed
*NL*
softly
along
the
hallway
the
man
's
back
and
listed
feet
and
lighted
*NL*
candle
past
a
lighted
crevice
of
doorway
on
the
left
and
carefully
down
*NL*
a
turning
staircase
of
more
than
five
steps
into
the
kitchen
of
Bloom
's
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
Bloom
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
extinguished
the
candle
by
a
sharp
expiration
of
breath
upon
its
*NL*
flame
,
drew
two
spoonseat
deal
chairs
to
the
hearthstone
,
one
for
*NL*
Stephen
with
its
back
to
the
area
window
,
the
other
for
himself
when
*NL*
necessary
,
knelt
on
one
knee
,
composed
in
the
grate
a
pyre
of
crosslaid
*NL*
resintipped
sticks
and
various
coloured
papers
and

*NL*
of

a

from
the
yard
of
Messrs
*NL*
Flower

street
,
kindled
it
at
three
projecting
*NL*
points
of
paper
with
one
ignited
lucifer
match
,
thereby
releasing
*NL*
the
potential
energy
contained
in
the

allowing
its

hydrogen
elements
to
enter
into

did
Stephen
think
?

What
did
Bloom
do
at

?
*NL*
*NL*
He
removed
the

to
the

,
rose
and
carried
the

in
order
to
tap
the

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
it
flow
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
From
Roundwood
reservoir
in
county
Wicklow
of
a
cubic
capacity
of
*NL*
2400
million

,
percolating
through
a
subterranean
aqueduct
of
*NL*

of
single

constructed
at
an
initial
*NL*

by

by
a
gradient
of
250
feet
to
the
city
boundary
at
*NL*
Eustace
bridge
,
upper

,
though
from
prolonged
summer
drouth
*NL*
and
daily
supply
of
12 1/2
million

the
water
had
fallen
below
*NL*
the

which
reason
the

waterworks
engineer
,
Mr
Spencer
Harty
,
C.
E.
,
on
the
instructions
of
*NL*
the
waterworks
committee
had
prohibited
the
use
of
municipal
water
for
*NL*
purposes
other
than
those
of

-LRB-
envisaging
the
possibility
of

recourse
being

to
the

of
the
Grand

Royal
canals
*NL*
as
in
1893
-RRB-
particularly
as
the
South
Dublin

,
notwithstanding
*NL*
their
ration
of
15
gallons
per

per
pauper
supplied
through
a

,
had
been
convicted
of
a

of
20,000

by
*NL*
a

of
their
meter
on
the
affirmation
of
the
law
agent
of
*NL*
the

Mr

thereby
acting

indisputable

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Having

on

,
why
did
he
*NL*
return
to

*NL*
To

*NL*
*NL*
What
reason
did
Stephen
give
for
declining
Bloom
's
offer
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
was
hydrophobe
,
hating
partial
contact
by
immersion
or
total
by
*NL*
submersion
in
cold
water
,
-LRB-
his
last
bath
having
taken
place
in
the

*NL*
of
October
of
the
preceding

-RRB-
,
disliking
the
aqueous
substances
of
*NL*
glass
and
crystal
,
distrusting
aquacities
of
thought
and
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
impeded
Bloom
from
giving
Stephen
counsels
of
hygiene
and
*NL*
prophylactic
to
which
should
be
added
suggestions
concerning
a
*NL*
preliminary
wetting
of
the
head
and
contraction
of
the
muscles
with
*NL*
rapid
splashing
of
the
face
and
neck
and
thoracic
and
epigastric
region
*NL*
in
case
of
sea
or
river
bathing
,
the
parts
of
the
human
anatomy
most
*NL*
sensitive
to
cold
being
the
nape
,
stomach
and
thenar
or
sole
of

?
*NL*
*NL*
The
incompatibility
of
aquacity
with
the
erratic
originality
of
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
additional
didactic
counsels
did
he
similarly
repress
?
*NL*
*NL*
Dietary
:
concerning
the
respective
percentage
of
protein
and
caloric
*NL*
energy
in
bacon
,
salt
ling
and
butter
,
the
absence
of
the
former
in
the
*NL*
lastnamed
and
the
abundance
of
the
latter
in
the
firstnamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Which
seemed
to
the
host
to
be
the
predominant
qualities
of
his
guest
?
*NL*
*NL*
Confidence
in
himself
,
an
equal
and
opposite
power
of
abandonment
and
*NL*
recuperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
concomitant
phenomenon
took
place
in
the
vessel
of
liquid
by
the
*NL*
agency
of
fire
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
phenomenon
of
ebullition
.
Fanned
by
a
constant
updraught
of
*NL*
ventilation
between
the
kitchen
and
the
chimneyflue
,
ignition
was
*NL*
communicated
from
the
faggots
of
precombustible
fuel
to
polyhedral
*NL*
masses
of
bituminous
coal
,
containing
in
compressed
mineral
form
the
*NL*
foliated
fossilised
decidua
of
primeval
forests
which
had
in
turn
*NL*
derived
their
vegetative
existence
from
the
sun
,
primal
source
of
heat
*NL*
-LRB-
radiant
-RRB-
,
transmitted
through
omnipresent
luminiferous
diathermanous
*NL*
ether
.
Heat
-LRB-
convected
-RRB-
,
a
mode
of
motion
developed
by
such
*NL*
combustion
,
was
constantly
and
increasingly
conveyed
from
the
source
*NL*
of
calorification
to
the
liquid
contained
in
the
vessel
,
being
radiated
*NL*
through
the
uneven
unpolished
dark
surface
of
the
metal
iron
,
in
part
*NL*
reflected
,
in
part
absorbed
,
in
part
transmitted
,
gradually
raising
*NL*
the
temperature
of
the
water
from
normal
to
boiling
point
,
a
rise
in
*NL*
temperature
expressible
as
the
result
of
an
expenditure
of
72
thermal
*NL*
units
needed
to
raise
1
pound
of
water
from
50
degrees
to
212
degrees
*NL*
Fahrenheit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
announced
the
accomplishment
of
this
rise
in
temperature
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
double
falciform
ejection
of
water
vapour
from
under
the
kettlelid
at
*NL*
both
sides
simultaneously
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
what
personal
purpose
could
Bloom
have
applied
the
water
so
boiled
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
shave
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
advantages
attended
shaving
by
night
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
softer
beard
:
a
softer
brush
if
intentionally
allowed
to
remain
from
*NL*
shave
to
shave
in
its
agglutinated
lather
:
a
softer
skin
if
unexpectedly
*NL*
encountering
female
acquaintances
in
remote
places
at
incustomary
hours
:
*NL*
quiet
reflections
upon
the
course
of
the
day
:
a
cleaner
sensation
when
*NL*
awaking
after
a
fresher
sleep
since
matutinal
noises
,
premonitions
and
*NL*
perturbations
,
a
clattered
milkcan
,
a
postman
's
double
knock
,
a
paper
*NL*
read
,
reread
while
lathering
,
relathering
the
same
spot
,
a
shock
,
a
*NL*
shoot
,
with
thought
of
aught
he
sought
though
fraught
with
nought
might
*NL*
cause
a
faster
rate
of
shaving
and
a
nick
on
which
incision
plaster
with
*NL*
precision
cut
and
humected
and
applied
adhered
:
which
was
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
absence
of
light
disturb
him
less
than
presence
of
noise
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
of
the
surety
of
the
sense
of
touch
in
his
firm
full
masculine
*NL*
feminine
passive
active
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
quality
did
it
-LRB-
his
hand
-RRB-
possess
but
with
what
counteracting
*NL*
influence
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
operative
surgical
quality
but
that
he
was
reluctant
to
shed
human
*NL*
blood
even
when
the
end
justified
the
means
,
preferring
,
in
their
*NL*
natural
order
,
heliotherapy
,
psychophysicotherapeutics
,
osteopathic
*NL*

.

*NL*

the

in

*NL*
*NL*
What
qualifying
considerations
allayed
his
perturbations
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
difficulties
of
interpretation
since
the
significance
of

*NL*
followed
its
occurrence
as
variably
as
the

followed

He

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
satisfied
him

To

*NL*
How
did
Bloom
prepare
a

for

*NL*
*NL*
He
poured
into
two
teacups
two

spoonfuls
,
four
in

,
of

*NL*

*NL*
What
supererogatory
marks

did
the

show
his

?

*NL*
Relinquishing

*NL*
he
substituted
a

identical

served
*NL*
extraordinarily
to
his

,
in

to

the

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
the
guest
conscious
of
and
did
he
acknowledge
these
marks
of
*NL*
hospitality
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
attention
was
directed
to
them
by
his
host
jocosely
,
and
he
accepted
*NL*
them
seriously
as
they
drank
in

*NL*

Were
there
marks

contemplated

suppressed

reserving
them

complete
the
act
begun

*NL*
The

of

*NL*
Who
drank
more
quickly
?
*NL*
*NL*
Bloom
,
having
the
advantage
of
ten
seconds
at
the
initiation
and
taking
,
*NL*
from

of

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
cerebration
accompanied
his
frequentative
act
?
*NL*
*NL*
Concluding
by
inspection
but
erroneously
that
his
silent
companion
was
*NL*
engaged
in
mental
composition
he
reflected
on
the
pleasures
derived
from
*NL*
literature
of
instruction
rather
than
of
amusement
as
he
himself
had
*NL*
applied
to
the
works
of
William
Shakespeare
more
than
once
for
the
*NL*
solution
of
difficult
problems
in
imaginary
or
real
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
found
their
solution
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
careful
and
repeated
reading
of
certain
classical
passages
,
*NL*
aided
by
a
glossary
,
he
had
derived
imperfect
conviction
from
the
text
,
*NL*
the
answers
not
bearing
in
all
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What

What
relation
existed
between
their
ages
?
*NL*
*NL*
16
years
before
in
1888
when
Bloom
was
of
Stephen
's
present
age
Stephen
*NL*
was
6

16
years
after
in
1920
when
Stephen
would
be
of
Bloom
's
present
*NL*
age
Bloom
would
be
54
.
In
1936
when
Bloom
would
be
70
and
Stephen
54
*NL*
their
ages
initially
in
the
ratio
of
16
to
0
would
be
as
17 1/2
to
13
*NL*
1/2
,
the
proportion
increasing

diminishing

*NL*
as
arbitrary
future

were

for
if
the
proportion
existing

1883
had

conceiving
that
to

,
till
then
*NL*
1904
when

Bloom
would
be
374
and
in

when

would
be

,
as

attained
the
maximum
postdiluvian
age
of
70
Bloom
,
*NL*
being
1190
years
alive
having
been

antediluvian
age

that

*NL*
969
years

if
Stephen
would
continue
to
live
until
he
would
*NL*
attain
that
age
in

3072
A.D.

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
events
might
nullify
these
calculations
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
cessation
of
existence
of
both

either
,
the
inauguration
of
a
*NL*
new
era
or
calendar
,
the
annihilation
of

extermination
of
the
human
species
,
inevitable
but
impredictable
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

many
previous
encounters
proved
their

acquaintance
?

*NL*
Two
.

first
in
the
lilacgarden
of
Matthew
Dillon
's
house
,
Medina
*NL*
Villa
,
Kimmage
road
,
Roundtown
,
in
1887
,
in
the
company
of
Stephen
's
*NL*
mother
,
Stephen
being
then
of
the
age
of
5
and
reluctant
to
give
his
*NL*
hand
in
salutation
.
The
second
in
the
coffeeroom
of
Breslin
's
hotel
on
a
*NL*
rainy
Sunday
in
the
January
of
1892
,
in
the
company
of
Stephen
's
father
*NL*
and
Stephen
's
granduncle
,
Stephen
being
then
5
years
older
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Bloom
accept
the
invitation
to
dinner
given
then
by
the
son
and
*NL*
afterwards
seconded
by
the
father
?
*NL*
*NL*
Very
gratefully
,
with
grateful
appreciation
,
with
sincere
appreciative
*NL*
gratitude
,
in
appreciatively
grateful
sincerity
of
regret
,
he
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
their
conversation
on
the
subject
of
these
reminiscences
reveal
a
*NL*
third
connecting
link
between
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Riordan
-LRB-
Dante
-RRB-
,
a
widow
of
independent
means
,
had
resided
in
the
*NL*
house
of
Stephen
's
parents
from
1
September
1888
to
29
December
1891
and
*NL*
had
also
resided
during
the
years
1892
,
1893
and
1894
in
the
City
Arms
*NL*
Hotel
owned
by
Elizabeth
O'Dowd
of
54
Prussia
street
where
,
during
parts
*NL*
of
the
years
1893
and
1894
,
she
had
been
a
constant
informant
of
Bloom
*NL*
who
resided
also
in
the
same
hotel
,
being
at
that
time
a
clerk
in
the
*NL*
employment
of
Joseph
Cuffe
of
5
Smithfield
for
the
superintendence
of
*NL*
sales
in
the
adjacent
Dublin
Cattle
market
on
the
North
Circular
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
performed
any
special
corporal
work
of
mercy
for
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sometimes
propelled
her
on
warm
summer
evenings
,
an
infirm
widow
*NL*
of
independent
,
if
limited
,
means
,
in
her
convalescent
bathchair
*NL*
with
slow
revolutions
of
its
wheels
as
far
as
the
corner
of
the
North
*NL*
Circular
road
opposite
Mr
Gavin
Low
's
place
of
business
where
she
had
*NL*
remained
for
a
certain
time
scanning
through
his
onelensed
binocular
*NL*
fieldglasses
unrecognisable
citizens
on
tramcars
,
roadster
bicycles
*NL*
equipped
with
inflated
pneumatic
tyres
,
hackney
carriages
,
tandems
,
*NL*
private
and
hired
landaus
,
dogcarts
,
ponytraps
and
brakes
passing
from
*NL*
the
city
to
the
Phoenix
Park
and
vice
versa
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
could
he
then
support
that
his
vigil
with
the
greater
equanimity
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
in
middle
youth
he
had
often
sat
observing
through
a
rondel
*NL*
of
bossed
glass
of
a
multicoloured
pane
the
spectacle
offered
with
*NL*
continual
changes
of
the
thoroughfare
without
,
pedestrians
,
quadrupeds
,
*NL*
velocipedes
,
vehicles
,
passing
slowly
,
quickly
,
evenly
,
round
and
round
*NL*
and
round
the
rim
of
a
round
and
round
precipitous
globe
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
distinct
different
memories
had
each
of
her
now
eight
years
*NL*
deceased
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
older
,
her
bezique
cards
and
counters
,
her
Skye
terrier
,
her
*NL*
suppositious
wealth
,
her
lapses
of
responsiveness
and
incipient
*NL*
catarrhal
deafness
:
the
younger
,
her
lamp
of
colza
oil
before
the
statue
*NL*

Did

Substituting

*NL*
Why
did
Bloom
refrain
from
stating
that
he
had
frequented
the
university
*NL*
of
life
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
of
his
fluctuating
incertitude
as
to
whether
this
observation
*NL*
had

had
not
been
already
made
by
him
to
Stephen

by

to
him

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
two
temperaments
did
they
individually
represent
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
scientific
.
The
artistic
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
proofs
did
Bloom
adduce
to
prove
that
his
tendency
was
towards
*NL*
applied
,
rather
than
towards
pure
,
science
?
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
possible
inventions
of
which
he
had
cogitated
when
reclining
*NL*
in
a
state
of
supine
repletion
to
aid
digestion
,
stimulated
by
his
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
inventions
now
common
but
once
*NL*
revolutionary
,
for
example
,
the
aeronautic
parachute
,
the
reflecting
*NL*
telescope
,
the
spiral

the

,
the

the

*NL*
*NL*

What

One

victim
predestined

Once
by

abandoned

challenges
him
reluctant
and
,
as
an
apparition
of
hope
*NL*

youth

holds
him
unresisting

It
leads
him

habitation

apartment

there

implacable

immolates

should
by

not
be

Why
was
the
host

secret
infidel
-RRB-
silent
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
weighed
the
possible
evidences
for
and
against
ritual
murder
:
the
*NL*
incitations
of
the
hierarchy
,
the
superstition
of
the
populace
,
the
*NL*
propagation
of
rumour
in
continued
fraction

veridicity
,
the
envy
of

opulence
,
the
influence

the
sporadic
reappearance

atavistic
delinquency

suggestion

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
which
-LRB-
if
any
-RRB-
of
these
mental
or
physical
disorders
was
he
not
*NL*
totally
immune
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
hypnotic
suggestion
:
once
,
waking
,
he
had
not
recognised
his

sleeping
apartment
:
more
than
once

waking
,
he
had
been
for
an
*NL*
indefinite
time
incapable
of
moving
or
uttering
sounds
.
From
*NL*
somnambulism
:
once
,
sleeping

his
body
had
risen

crouched

*NL*
crawled

A

*NL*
*NL*
Why
similarly

why

*NL*
*NL*
Similarly

Differently
,
*NL*
because
of
different
possible

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
other
respects
were
their

similar

*NL*
*NL*
In
passivity
,
in

,
in
the
instinct
of

,
in
*NL*
unexpectedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As

Inasmuch

Again
,
in

to
remember
the

*NL*
of
a
famous

she
pulled
a

Furthermore
,

she
dreamed
of

an
unspoken

with
a

whose

Hence

in
*NL*
passivity
,
in

in
the

in

*NL*
their

the

*NL*
*NL*
In
what
manners
did
she
reciprocate
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
:
on

she
presented
to

at

thereabouts

been
made
by

showed

attentive

necessities
,
anticipating
his

.
She
admired
:
a
natural
phenomenon
*NL*
having
been
explained
by

to

she
expressed
the
immediate

What

did
Bloom

diambulist
,
father
of

make
*NL*
to
Stephen

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
various
advantages
would

might
have
resulted
from
a
prolongation
*NL*
of
such
an
extemporisation
?
*NL*
*NL*
For

Why

these

eventuality

Because

What
rendered
problematic
for
Bloom
the
realisation
of
these
mutually
*NL*
selfexcluding
propositions
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
irreparability
of
the
past
:
once
at
a
performance
of
Albert
*NL*
Hengler
's
circus
in
the
Rotunda
,
Rutland
square
,
Dublin
,
an
intuitive
*NL*
particoloured
clown
in
quest
of
paternity
had
penetrated
from
the
ring
*NL*
to
a
place
in
the
auditorium
where
Bloom
,
solitary
,
was
seated
and
had
*NL*
publicly
declared
to
an
exhilarated
audience
that
he
-LRB-
Bloom
-RRB-
was
his
*NL*
-LRB-
the
clown
's
-RRB-
papa
.
The
imprevidibility
of
the
future
:
once
in
the
*NL*
summer
of
1898
he
-LRB-
Bloom
-RRB-
had
marked
a
florin
-LRB-
2
/

-RRB-
with
three
notches
*NL*
on
the
milled
edge
and
tendered
it
m
payment
of
an

due
to

*NL*
received
by
J.
and
T.
Davy
,
family
grocers
,
1
Charlemont
Mall
,
Grand
*NL*
Canal
,
for
circulation
on
the
waters
of
civic
finance
,
for
possible
,
*NL*
circuitous
or
direct
,
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
the
clown
Bloom
's
son
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Bloom
's
coin
returned
?
*NL*
*NL*
Never
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
would
a
recurrent
frustration
the
more
depress
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
at
the
critical
turningpoint
of
human
existence
he
desired
to
*NL*
amend
many
social
conditions
,
the
product
of
inequality
and
avarice
and
*NL*
international
animosity
.
He
believed
then
that
human
life
was
infinitely
*NL*
perfectible
,
eliminating
these
conditions
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
remained
the
generic
conditions
imposed
by
natural
,
as
distinct
*NL*
from
human
law
,
as
integral
parts
of
the
human
whole
:
the
necessity
of
*NL*
destruction
to
procure
alimentary
sustenance
:
the
painful
character
of
*NL*
the
ultimate
functions
of
separate
existence
,
the
agonies
of
birth
and
*NL*
death
:
the
monotonous
menstruation
of
simian
and
-LRB-
particularly
-RRB-
human
*NL*
females
extending
from
the
age
of
puberty
to
the
menopause
:
inevitable
*NL*
accidents
at
sea
,
in
mines
and
factories
:
certain
very
painful
maladies
*NL*
and
their
resultant
surgical
operations
,
innate
lunacy
and
congenital
*NL*
criminality
,
decimating
epidemics
:
catastrophic
cataclysms
which
make
*NL*
terror
the
basis
of
human
mentality
:
seismic
upheavals
the
epicentres
*NL*
of
which
are
located
in
densely
populated
regions
:
the
fact
of
vital
*NL*
growth
,
through
convulsions
of
metamorphosis
,
from
infancy
through
*NL*
maturity
to
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
desist
from
speculation
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
it
was
a
task
for
a
superior
intelligence
to
substitute
other
*NL*
more
acceptable
phenomena
in
the
place
of
the
less
acceptable
phenomena
*NL*
to
be
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Stephen
participate
in
his
dejection
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
affirmed
his
significance
as
a
conscious
rational
animal
proceeding
*NL*
syllogistically
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
and
a
conscious
rational
*NL*
reagent
between
a
micro
and
a
macrocosm
ineluctably
constructed
upon
the
*NL*
incertitude
of
the
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
this
affirmation
apprehended
by
Bloom
?
*NL*
*NL*
Not
verbally
.
Substantially
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
comforted
his
misapprehension
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
as
a
competent
keyless
citizen
he
had
proceeded
energetically
from
*NL*
the
unknown
to
the
known
through
the
incertitude
of
the
void
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
order
of
precedence
,
with
what
attendant
ceremony
was
the
exodus
*NL*
from
the
house
of
bondage
to
the
wilderness
of
inhabitation
effected
?

What
did
each
do
at

*NL*
*NL*
Bloom
set
the

on

Stephen
put

For

a

?
*NL*
*NL*
For

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
spectacle
confronted
them
when
they
,
first
the

,
then
the
*NL*
guest
,
emerged
silently
,
doubly
dark
,
from
obscurity
by
a

from

*NL*
*NL*
The

of

hung
with

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
meditations
did
Bloom
accompany
his
demonstration
to
his
*NL*
companion
of
various
constellations
?
*NL*
*NL*
Meditations
of
evolution
increasingly
vaster
:
of
the
moon
invisible
in
*NL*
incipient
lunation
,
approaching
perigee
:
of
the
infinite
lattiginous
*NL*
scintillating
uncondensed
milky
way
,
discernible
by

by
an
*NL*
observer
placed
at
the

of
a

sunk

distant
*NL*
and
in

900

the

of
our

:
of
Arcturus
:
of
the
*NL*
precession
of

:
of
Orion
with
belt
and
sextuple
sun
theta
and
*NL*
nebula
in
which
100
of
our
solar
systems
could
be
contained
:
of
moribund
*NL*
and
of
nascent
new
stars
such
as
Nova
in
1901
:
of
our
system
plunging
*NL*
towards
the
constellation
of
Hercules
:
of
the
parallax
or
parallactic
*NL*
drift
of
socalled
fixed
stars
,
in
reality
evermoving
wanderers
from
*NL*
immeasurably
remote
eons
to
infinitely
remote
futures
in
comparison
with
*NL*
which
the
years
,
threescore
and
ten
,
of
allotted
human
life
formed
a
*NL*
parenthesis
of
infinitesimal
brevity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Were
there
obverse
meditations
of
involution
increasingly
less
vast
?
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
eons
of
geological
periods
recorded
in
the
stratifications
of
the
*NL*
earth
:
of
the
myriad
minute
entomological
organic
existences
concealed
*NL*
in

of

beneath
removable

,
in

,
*NL*
of

of
the
incalculable
*NL*
trillions
of
billions
of

of

contained
*NL*
by
cohesion
of
molecular
affinity
in
a

*NL*
of
human

constellated
with
red

white
bodies
,
themselves
*NL*
universes
of
void
space
constellated
with
other
bodies
,
each
,
in
*NL*
continuity
,
its
universe
of
divisible
component
bodies
of
which
each
was
*NL*
again
divisible
in
divisions
of
redivisible

,
dividends
*NL*
and

ever
diminishing
without

if
the
*NL*
progress
were
carried
far
enough
,
nought
nowhere
was
never
reached

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
he
not
elaborate
these
calculations
to
a
more
precise
result
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
some
years
previously
in
1886
when
occupied
with
the
problem
*NL*
of
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
he
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
a
*NL*
number
computed
to
a
relative
degree
of
accuracy
to
be
of
such
magnitude
*NL*
and
of
so
many
places
,
e.g.
,
the
9th
power
of
the
9th

of

,
that
,
*NL*
the

having
been
obtained

33
closely

*NL*

Did

find
the

of
the

by

easier
of

*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
different
order
of
difficulty
.
Conscious
that
the
human
organism
,
*NL*
normally
capable
of
sustaining
an
atmospheric
pressure
of
19
tons
,
*NL*
when
elevated
to
a
considerable

in
the
terrestrial

*NL*
suffered
with
arithmetical
progression
of

according

*NL*
the

of

between

was
*NL*
approximated
from
nasal
hemorrhage
,
impeded
respiration
and
vertigo
,
*NL*
when
proposing
this
problem
for
solution
,
he
had
conjectured
as
a
*NL*
working
hypothesis
which
could
not
be
proved
impossible
that
a
more
*NL*
adaptable
and
differently
anatomically
constructed
race
of

might

subsist
otherwise
under
Martian

Mercurial

Saturnian

*NL*
Neptunian
or
Uranian
sufficient

equivalent
conditions

though
*NL*
an
apogean
humanity
of

created
in
varying
forms
with
finite
*NL*
differences
resulting
similar
to
the
whole
and
to
one
another
would
*NL*
probably
there
as
here
remain
inalterably
and
inalienably
attached
to
*NL*
vanities
,
to
vanities
of

and
to
all
that
is
vanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the

of
possible

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
-LRB-
Bloom
's
-RRB-
logical
conclusion
,
having
weighed
the
matter
and
allowing
*NL*
for
possible
error
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
it
was
not
a
heaventree
,
not
a
heavengrot
,
not
a
heavenbeast
,
not
*NL*
a
heavenman
.
That
it
was
a
Utopia
,
there
being
no
known
method
from
*NL*
the
known
to
the
unknown
:
an
infinity
renderable
equally
finite
by
the
*NL*
suppositious
apposition
of
one
or
more
bodies
equally
of
the
same
and
of
*NL*
different
magnitudes
:
a
mobility
of
illusory
forms
immobilised
in
space
,
*NL*
remobilised
in
air
:
a
past
which
possibly
had
ceased
to
exist
as
a
*NL*
present
before
its
probable
spectators
had
entered
actual
present
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Was
he
more
convinced
of
the
esthetic
value
of
the
spectacle
?
*NL*
*NL*
Indubitably
in
consequence
of
the
reiterated
examples
of
poets
in
the
*NL*
delirium
of
the
frenzy
of
attachment
or
in
the
abasement
of
rejection
*NL*
invoking
ardent
sympathetic
constellations
or
the
frigidity
of
the
*NL*
satellite
of
their
planet
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
he
then
accept
as
an
article
of
belief
the
theory
of
astrological
*NL*
influences
upon
sublunary
disasters
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
as
possible
of
proof
as
of
confutation
and
the
*NL*
nomenclature
employed
in
its
selenographical
charts
as
attributable
to
*NL*
verifiable
intuition
as
to
fallacious
analogy
:
the
lake
of
dreams
,
the
*NL*
sea
of
rains
,
the
gulf
of
dews
,
the
ocean
of
fecundity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
special
affinities
appeared
to
him
to
exist
between
the
moon
and
*NL*
woman
?
*NL*
*NL*
Her
antiquity
in
preceding
and
surviving
successive
tellurian
*NL*
generations
:
her
nocturnal
predominance
:
her
satellitic
dependence
:
*NL*
her
luminary
reflection
:
her
constancy
under
all
her
phases
,
rising
*NL*
and
setting
by
her
appointed
times
,
waxing
and
waning
:
the
forced
*NL*
invariability
of
her
aspect
:
her
indeterminate
response
to
inaffirmative
*NL*
interrogation
:
her
potency
over
effluent
and
refluent
waters
:
her
power
*NL*
to
enamour
,
to
mortify
,
to
invest
with
beauty
,
to
render
insane
,
to
*NL*
incite
to
and
aid
delinquency
:
the
tranquil
inscrutability
of
her
*NL*
visage
:
the
terribility
of
her
isolated
dominant
implacable
resplendent
*NL*
propinquity
:
her
omens
of
tempest
and
of
calm
:
the
stimulation
of
her
*NL*
light
,
her
motion
and
her
presence
:
the
admonition
of
her
craters
,
her
*NL*
arid
seas
,
her
silence
:
her
splendour
,
when
visible
:
her
attraction
,
*NL*
when
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
visible
luminous
sign
attracted
Bloom
's
,
who
attracted
Stephen
's
,
*NL*
gaze
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
storey
-LRB-
rere
-RRB-
of
his
-LRB-

the

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
he
elucidate
the
mystery
of
an
invisible
attractive
person
,
his
*NL*
wife
Marion
-LRB-
Molly
-RRB-
Bloom
,
denoted
by
a
visible
splendid
sign
,
a
lamp
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
indirect
and
direct
verbal
allusions
or
affirmations
:
with
subdued
*NL*
affection
and
admiration
:
with
description
:
with
impediment
:
with
*NL*
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Both
then
were
silent
?
*NL*
*NL*
Silent
,
each
contemplating
the
other
in
both
mirrors
of
the
reciprocal
*NL*
flesh
of
theirhisnothis
fellowfaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Were
they
indefinitely
inactive
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
Stephen
's
suggestion
,
at
Bloom
's
instigation
both
,
first
Stephen
,
*NL*
then
Bloom
,
in
penumbra
urinated
,
their
sides
contiguous
,
their
organs
*NL*
of
micturition
reciprocally
rendered
invisible
by
manual
circumposition
,
*NL*
their
gazes
,
first
Bloom
's
,
then
Stephen
's
,
elevated
to
the
projected
*NL*
luminous
and
semiluminous
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Similarly
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
trajectories
of
their
,
first
sequent
,
then
simultaneous
,
urinations
*NL*
were
dissimilar
:
Bloom
's
longer
,
less
irruent
,
in
the
incomplete
form
of
*NL*
the
bifurcated
penultimate
alphabetical
letter
,
who
in
his
ultimate
*NL*
year
at
High
School
-LRB-
1880
-RRB-
had
been
capable
of
attaining
the
point
*NL*
of
greatest
altitude
against
the
whole
concurrent
strength
of
the
*NL*
institution
,
210
scholars
:
Stephen
's
higher
,
more
sibilant
,
who
in
the
*NL*
ultimate
hours
of
the
previous
day
had
augmented
by
diuretic
consumption
*NL*
an
insistent
vesical
pressure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
different
problems
presented
themselves
to
each
concerning
the
*NL*
invisible
audible
collateral
organ
of
the
other
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
Bloom
:
the
problems
of
irritability
,
tumescence
,
rigidity
,
*NL*
reactivity
,
dimension
,
sanitariness
,
pilosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Stephen
:
the
problem
of
the
sacerdotal
integrity
of
Jesus
circumcised
*NL*
-LRB-
I
January
,
holiday
of
obligation
to
hear
mass
and
abstain
from
*NL*
unnecessary
servile
work
-RRB-
and
the
problem
as
to
whether
the
divine
*NL*
prepuce
,
the
carnal
bridal
ring
of
the
holy
Roman
catholic
apostolic
*NL*
church
,
conserved
in
Calcata
,
were
deserving
of
simple
hyperduly
or
of
*NL*
the
fourth
degree
of
latria
accorded
to
the
abscission
of
such
divine
*NL*
excrescences
as
hair
and
toenails
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
celestial
sign
was
by
both
simultaneously
observed
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
star
precipitated
with
great
apparent
velocity
across
the
firmament
*NL*
from
Vega
in
the
Lyre
above
the
zenith
beyond
the
stargroup
of
the
Tress
*NL*
of
Berenice
towards
the
zodiacal
sign
of
Leo
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
the
centripetal
remainer
afford
egress
to
the
centrifugal
*NL*
departer
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
inserting
the
barrel
of
an
arruginated
male
key
in
the
hole
of
an
*NL*
unstable
female
lock
,
obtaining
a
purchase
on
the
bow
of
the
key
and
*NL*
turning
its
wards
from
right
to
left
,
withdrawing
a
bolt
from
its
*NL*
staple
,
pulling
inward
spasmodically
an
obsolescent
unhinged
door
and
*NL*
revealing
an
aperture
for
free
egress
and
free
ingress
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
they
take
leave
,
one
of
the
other
,
in
separation
?
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
perpendicular
at
the
same
door
and
on
different
sides
of
its
*NL*
base
,
the
lines
of
their
valedictory
arms
,
meeting
at
any
point
and
*NL*
forming
any
angle
less
than
the
sum
of
two
right
angles
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
sound
accompanied
the
union
of
their
tangent
,
the
disunion
of
their
*NL*
-LRB-
respectively
-RRB-
centrifugal
and
centripetal
hands
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of

peal
of

*NL*
in
the

inclined

The

the

the

More

a

ecclesiastical
clocks
at

various

,
avine

the

tread
of
an

*NL*
the

of
an

the
*NL*
first
golden
limb
of
the
resurgent
sun
perceptible
low
on

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Did
he
remain
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
deep
inspiration
he
returned
,
retraversing
the
garden
,
reentering
*NL*
the
passage
,
reclosing
the

.
With
brief
suspiration
he
reassumed
the

candle
,
reascended
the

reapproached
the

of
the

*NL*
What
suddenly
arrested
his
ingress
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
right
temporal
lobe
of
the
hollow
sphere
of
his
cranium
came
into
*NL*
contact
with
a
solid
timber
angle
where
,
an
infinitesimal
but
sensible
*NL*
fraction
of
a
second
later

a
painful
sensation
was
located
in
*NL*
consequence

to

near
the

furled
Union

-LRB-
an
*NL*
alteration
which
he
had
frequently
intended
to
execute
-RRB-
:
the

inlaid
majolicatopped

*NL*
-LRB-
a
projecting
angle

momentarily
arrested
his

-RRB-
had

been
moved
from

to
a
more

but
*NL*
more
perilous
position

two

*NL*
*NL*
Describe
them

*NL*
*NL*
One
:
a
squat
stuffed
easychair
,
with
stout
arms
extended
and
back
*NL*
slanted
to
the
rere
,
which
,
repelled
in

,
had
then
upturned
an
*NL*
irregular
fringe
of
a
rectangular
rug
and
now
displayed
on
its
amply
*NL*
upholstered
seat
a
centralised
diffusing
and
diminishing
discolouration
.
*NL*
The
other
:
a
slender
splayfoot
chair
of
glossy
cane
curves
,
placed
*NL*
directly
opposite
the
former
,
its
frame
from
top
to
seat
and
from
seat
*NL*
to
base
being
varnished
dark

its
seat
being
a

white

With
what
sensations
did
Bloom
contemplate
in
rotation
these
objects
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
strain
,
elevating
a
candlestick
:
with
pain
,
feeling
on
his
right
*NL*
temple
a
contused
tumescence
:
with
attention
,
focussing
his
gaze
on
*NL*
a
large
dull
passive
and
a
slender
bright
active
:
with
solicitation
,
*NL*
bending
and
downturning
the
upturned
rugfringe
:
with
amusement
,
*NL*
remembering
Dr
Malachi
Mulligan
's
scheme
of
colour
containing
the
*NL*
gradation
of
green
:
with
pleasure
,
repeating
the
words
and
antecedent
*NL*
act
and
perceiving
through
various
channels
of
internal
sensibility
*NL*
the
consequent
and
concomitant
tepid
pleasant
diffusion
of
gradual
*NL*
discolouration
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
next
proceeding
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
an
open
box
on
the
majolicatopped
table
he
extracted
a
black
*NL*
diminutive
cone
,
one
inch
in
height
,
placed
it
on
its
circular
base
on
*NL*
a
small
tin
plate
,
placed
his
candlestick
on
the
right
corner
of
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
,
produced
from
his
waistcoat
a
folded
page
of
prospectus
*NL*
-LRB-
illustrated
-RRB-
entitled
Agendath
Netaim
,
unfolded
the
same
,
examined
*NL*
it
superficially
,
rolled
it
into
a
thin
cylinder
,
ignited
it
in
the
*NL*
candleflame
,
applied
it
when
ignited
to
the
apex
of
the
cone
till
the
*NL*
latter
reached
the
stage
of
rutilance
,
placed
the
cylinder
in
the
basin
*NL*
of
the
candlestick
disposing
its
unconsumed
part
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
facilitate
total
combustion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
followed
this
operation
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
truncated
conical
crater
summit
of
the
diminutive
volcano
emitted
a
*NL*
vertical
and
serpentine
fume
redolent
of
aromatic
oriental
incense
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
homothetic
objects
,
other
than
the
candlestick
,
stood
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
?
*NL*
*NL*
A

*NL*
What
interchanges
of
looks
took
place
between
these
three
objects
and
*NL*
Bloom
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mirror
of
the
giltbordered
pierglass
the
undecorated
back
of
the
*NL*
dwarf
tree
regarded
the
upright
back
of
the
embalmed
owl
.
Before
*NL*
the
mirror
the
matrimonial
gift
of
Alderman
John
Hooper
with
a
clear
*NL*
melancholy
wise

gaze
regarded
Bloom
*NL*
while
Bloom
with
obscure
tranquil
profound
motionless
compassionated
*NL*
gaze
regarded
the
matrimonial
gift
of
Luke
and
Caroline

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
composite
asymmetrical
image
in
the
mirror
then
attracted
his
*NL*
attention
?
*NL*
*NL*

From

From

he
would
increasingly
resemble
his

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
final
visual
impression
was
communicated
to
him
by
the
mirror
?

The

everything
in

:
the
deficient
appreciation
of

the
incongruity
of

*NL*
*NL*
Firstly
,
in

mnemotechnic
:

,
because

Did
the
process
of
divestiture
continue
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sensible
of
a
benignant
persistent
ache
in
his
footsoles
he
extended
*NL*
his
foot
to
one
side
and
observed
the
creases
,
protuberances
and
salient
*NL*
points
caused
by
foot
pressure
in
the
course
of
walking
repeatedly
in
*NL*
several
different
directions
,
then
,
inclined
,
he
disnoded
the
laceknots
,
*NL*
unhooked
and
loosened
the
laces
,
took
off
each
of
his
two
boots
for
the
*NL*
second
time
,
detached
the
partially
moistened
right
sock
through
the
*NL*
fore
part
of
which
the
nail
of
his
great
toe
had
again
effracted
,
raised
*NL*
his
right
foot
and
,
having
unhooked
a
purple
elastic
sock
suspender
,
*NL*
took
off
his
right
sock
,
placed
his
unclothed
right
foot
on
the
margin
*NL*
of
the
seat
of
his
chair
,
picked
at
and
gently
lacerated
the
protruding
*NL*
part
of
the
great
toenail
,
raised
the
part
lacerated
to
his
nostrils
and
*NL*
inhaled
the
odour
of
the
quick
,
then
,
with
satisfaction
,
threw
away
the
*NL*
lacerated
ungual
fragment
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
with
satisfaction
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
the
odour
inhaled
corresponded
to
other
odours
inhaled
of

fragments
,
picked
and
lacerated
by
Master
Bloom

life
at

2/7
,
viz

20

*NL*
What
did
he
fear
?

*NL*
*NL*
What
were

?

subject

objects
evoke
in

*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
,
widower
,
unkempt
of

,
in

,
with
head
covered

*NL*
sighing
:
an

,
Athos
:
aconite
,
resorted

by
increasing
doses

of

and
scruples
as
a
palliative
of
recrudescent
neuralgia
:
the
*NL*
face
in

of
a
septuagenarian
,
suicide
by
poison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
Bloom
experience
a
sentiment
of
remorse
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
in
immature
impatience
he
had
treated
with
disrespect
certain
*NL*
beliefs
and
practices
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
prohibition

at

meal

hebdomadary

mercantile
coexreligionist
excompatriots
:

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
these
beliefs
and
practices
now
appear
to
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Not
more
rational
than
they
had
then
appeared

not

What
first
reminiscence
had
he
of
Rudolph
Bloom
-LRB-
deceased
-RRB-
?
*NL*
*NL*
Rudolph
Bloom
-LRB-
deceased
-RRB-
narrated
to
his
son
Leopold
Bloom
-LRB-
aged
6
-RRB-
a
*NL*
retrospective
arrangement
of
migrations
and
settlements
in
and
between
*NL*
Dublin
,
London
,
Florence
,
Milan
,
Vienna
,
Budapest
,
Szombathely
with

statements
of
satisfaction
-LRB-
his
grandfather
having
seen
Maria
Theresia
,
*NL*
empress
of
Austria
,
queen
of
Hungary
-RRB-
,
with
commercial
advice
-LRB-
having
*NL*
taken
care
of
pence
,
the
pounds
having
taken
care
of
themselves
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Leopold
Bloom
-LRB-
aged
6
-RRB-
had
accompanied
these
narrations
by
constant
*NL*
consultation
of
a
geographical
map
of
Europe
-LRB-
political
-RRB-
and
by
*NL*
suggestions
for
the
establishment
of
affiliated
business
premises
in
the
*NL*
various
centres
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Had
time
equally
but
differently
obliterated
the
memory
of
these
*NL*
migrations
in
narrator
and
listener
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
narrator
by
the
access
of
years
and
in
consequence
of
the
use
of
*NL*
narcotic
toxin
:
in
listener
by
the
access
of
years
and
in
consequence
of
*NL*
the
action
of
distraction
upon
vicarious
experiences
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
idiosyncracies
of
the
narrator
were
concomitant
products
of
*NL*
amnesia
?
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
he
ate
without
having
previously
removed
his
hat
.
*NL*
Occasionally
he
drank
voraciously
the
juice
of
gooseberry
fool
from
an
*NL*
inclined
plate
.
Occasionally
he
removed
from
his
lips
the
traces
of
food
*NL*
by
means
of
a
lacerated
envelope
or
other
accessible
fragment
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
two
phenomena
of
senescence
were
more
frequent
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
myopic
digital
calculation
of
coins
,
eructation
consequent
upon
*NL*
repletion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
object
offered
partial
consolation
for
these
reminiscences
?
*NL*
*NL*

endowment
policy
,
the
bank
passbook
,
the
certificate
of
the
*NL*
possession
of

be
like
her
a
wonder
*NL*
she
didnt
want
us
to
cover
our
faces
but
she
was
a
welleducated
woman
*NL*
certainly
and
her
gabby
talk
about
Mr
Riordan
here
and
Mr
Riordan
there
*NL*
I
suppose
he
was
glad
to
get
shut
of
her
and
her
dog
smelling
my
fur
and
*NL*
always
edging
to
get
up
under
my
petticoats
especially
then
still
I
like
*NL*
that
in
him
polite
to
old
women
like
that
and
waiters
and
beggars
too
*NL*
hes
not
proud
out
of
nothing
but
not
always
if
ever
he
got
anything
*NL*
really
serious
the
matter
with
him
its
much
better
for
them
to
go
into
*NL*
a
hospital
where
everything
is
clean
but
I
suppose
Id
have
to
dring
it
*NL*
into
him
for
a
month
yes
and
then
wed
have
a
hospital
nurse
next
thing
*NL*
on
the
carpet
have
him
staying
there
till
they
throw
him
out
or
a
nun
*NL*
maybe
like
the
smutty
photo
he
has
shes
as
much
a
nun
as
Im
not
yes
*NL*
because
theyre
so
weak
and
puling
when
theyre
sick
they
want
a
woman
*NL*
to
get
well
if
his
nose
bleeds
youd
think
it
was
O
tragic
and
that
*NL*
dyinglooking
one
off
the
south
circular
when
he
sprained
his
foot
at
*NL*
the
choir
party
at
the
sugarloaf
Mountain
the
day
I
wore
that
dress
*NL*
Miss
Stack
bringing
him
flowers
the
worst
old
ones
she
could
find
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
basket
anything
at
all
to
get
into
a
mans
bedroom
with
*NL*
her
old
maids
voice
trying
to
imagine
he
was
dying
on
account
of
her
to
*NL*
never
see
thy
face
again
though
he
looked
more
like
a
man
with
his
beard
*NL*
a
bit
grown
in
the
bed
father
was
the
same
besides
I
hate
bandaging
and
*NL*
dosing
when
he
cut
his
toe
with
the
razor
paring
his
corns
afraid
hed
*NL*
get
bloodpoisoning
but
if
it
was
a
thing
I
was
sick
then
wed
see
what
*NL*
attention
only
of
course
the
woman
hides
it
not
to
give
all
the
trouble
*NL*
they
do
yes
he
came
somewhere
Im
sure
by
his
appetite
anyway
love
its
*NL*
not
or
hed
be
off
his
feed
thinking
of
her
so
either
it
was
one
of
those
*NL*
night
women
if
it
was
down
there
he
was
really
and
the
hotel
story
he
*NL*
made
up
a
pack
of
lies
to
hide
it
planning
it
Hynes
kept
me
who
did
I
*NL*
meet
ah
yes
I
met
do
you
remember
Menton
and
who
else
who
let
me
see
*NL*
that
big
babbyface
I
saw
him
and
he
not
long
married
flirting
with
a
*NL*
young
girl
at
Pooles
Myriorama
and
turned
my
back
on
him
when
he
slinked
*NL*
out
looking
quite
conscious
what
harm
but
he
had
the
impudence
to
make
*NL*
up
to
me
one
time
well
done
to
him
mouth
almighty
and
his
boiled
eyes
of
*NL*
all
the
big
stupoes
I
ever
met
and
thats
called
a
solicitor
only
for
*NL*
I
hate
having
a
long
wrangle
in
bed
or
else
if
its
not
that
its
some
*NL*
little
bitch
or
other
he
got
in
with
somewhere
or
picked
up
on
the
*NL*
sly
if
they
only
knew
him
as
well
as
I
do
yes
because
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
he
was
scribbling
something
a
letter
when
I
came
into
the
*NL*
front
room
to
show
him
Dignams
death
in
the
paper
as
if
something
told
*NL*
me
and
he
covered
it
up
with
the
blottingpaper
pretending
to
be
thinking
*NL*
about
business
so
very
probably
that
was
it
to
somebody
who
thinks
*NL*
she
has
a
softy
in
him
because
all
men
get
a
bit
like
that
at
his
age
*NL*
especially
getting
on
to
forty
he
is
now
so
as
to
wheedle
any
money
she
*NL*
can
out
of
him
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
and
then
the
usual
kissing
my
*NL*
bottom
was
to
hide
it
not
that
I
care
two
straws
now
who
he
does
it
with
*NL*
or
knew
before
that
way
though
Id
like
to
find
out
so
long
as
I
dont
*NL*
have
the
two
of
them
under
my
nose
all
the
time
like
that
slut
that
Mary
*NL*
we
had
in
Ontario
terrace
padding
out
her
false
bottom
to
excite
him
bad
*NL*
enough
to
get
the
smell
of
those
painted
women
off
him
once
or
twice
*NL*
I
had
a
suspicion
by
getting
him
to
come
near
me
when
I
found
the
*NL*
long
hair
on
his
coat
without
that
one
when
I
went
into
the
kitchen
*NL*
pretending
he
was
drinking
water
1
woman
is
not
enough
for
them
it
was
*NL*
all
his
fault
of
course
ruining
servants
then
proposing
that
she
could
*NL*
eat
at
our
table
on
Christmas
day
if
you
please
O
no
thank
you
not
in
my
*NL*
house
stealing
my
potatoes
and
the
oysters
2/6
per
doz
going
out
to
see
*NL*
her
aunt
if
you
please
common
robbery
so
it
was
but
I
was
sure
he
had
*NL*
something
on
with
that
one
it
takes
me
to
find
out
a
thing
like
that
he
*NL*
said
you
have
no
proof
it
was
her
proof
O
yes
her
aunt
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
oysters
but
I
told
her
what
I
thought
of
her
suggesting
me
to
go
out
to
*NL*
be
alone
with
her
I
wouldnt
lower
myself
to
spy
on
them
the
garters
I
*NL*
found
in
her
room
the
Friday
she
was
out
that
was
enough
for
me
a
little
*NL*
bit
too
much
her
face
swelled
up
on
her
with
temper
when
I
gave
her
her
*NL*
weeks
notice
I
saw
to
that
better
do
without
them
altogether
do
out
the
*NL*
rooms
myself
quicker
only
for
the
damn
cooking
and
throwing
out
the
dirt
*NL*
I
gave
it
to
him
anyhow
either
she
or
me
leaves
the
house
I
couldnt
even
*NL*
touch
him
if
I
thought
he
was
with
a
dirty
barefaced
liar
and
sloven
*NL*
like
that
one
denying
it
up
to
my
face
and
singing
about
the
place
in
*NL*
the
W
C
too
because
she
knew
she
was
too
well
off
yes
because
he
couldnt
*NL*
possibly
do
without
it
that
long
so
he
must
do
it
somewhere
and
the
last
*NL*
time
he
came
on
my
bottom
when
was
it
the
night
Boylan
gave
my
hand
a
*NL*
great
squeeze
going
along
by
the
Tolka
in
my
hand
there
steals
another
*NL*
I
just
pressed
the
back
of
his
like
that
with
my
thumb
to
squeeze
back
*NL*
singing
the
young
May
moon
shes
beaming
love
because
he
has
an
idea
*NL*
about
him
and
me
hes
not
such
a
fool
he
said
Im
dining
out
and
going
to
*NL*
the
Gaiety
though
Im
not
going
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
in
any
case
*NL*
God
knows
hes
a
change
in
a
way
not
to
be
always
and
ever
wearing
the
*NL*
same
old
hat
unless
I
paid
some
nicelooking
boy
to
do
it
since
I
cant
do
*NL*
it
myself
a
young
boy
would
like
me
Id
confuse
him
a
little
alone
with
*NL*
him
if
we
were
Id
let
him
see
my
garters
the
new
ones
and
make
him
turn
*NL*
red
looking
at
him
seduce
him
I
know
what
boys
feel
with
that
down
*NL*
on
their
cheek
doing
that
frigging
drawing
out
the
thing
by
the
hour
*NL*
question
and
answer
would
you
do
this
that
and
the
other
with
the
*NL*
coalman
yes
with
a
bishop
yes
I
would
because
I
told
him
about
some
dean
*NL*
or
bishop
was
sitting
beside
me
in
the
jews
temples
gardens
when
I
was
*NL*
knitting
that
woollen
thing
a
stranger
to
Dublin
what
place
was
it
and
*NL*
so
on
about
the
monuments
and
he
tired
me
out
with
statues
encouraging
*NL*
him
making
him
worse
than
he
is
who
is
in
your
mind
now
tell
me
who
are
*NL*
you
thinking
of
who
is
it
tell
me
his
name
who
tell
me
who
the
german
*NL*
Emperor
is
it
yes
imagine
Im
him
think
of
him
can
you
feel
him
trying
to
*NL*
make
a
whore
of
me
what
he
never
will
he
ought
to
give
it
up
now
at
this
*NL*
age
of
his
life
simply
ruination
for
any
woman
and
no
satisfaction
in
it
*NL*
pretending
to
like
it
till
he
comes
and
then
finish
it
off
myself
anyway
*NL*
and
it
makes
your
lips
pale
anyhow
its
done
now
once
and
for
all
with
*NL*
all
the
talk
of
the
world
about
it
people
make
its
only
the
first
time
*NL*
after
that
its
just
the
ordinary
do
it
and
think
no
more
about
it
why
*NL*
cant
you
kiss
a
man
without
going
and
marrying
him
first
you
sometimes
*NL*
love
to
wildly
when
you
feel
that
way
so
nice
all
over
you
you
cant
help
*NL*
yourself
I
wish
some
man
or
other
would
take
me
sometime
when
hes
there
*NL*
and
kiss
me
in
his
arms
theres
nothing
like
a
kiss
long
and
hot
down
to
*NL*
your
soul
almost
paralyses
you
then
I
hate
that
confession
when
I
used
*NL*
to
go
to
Father
Corrigan
he
touched
me
father
and
what
harm
if
he
did
*NL*
where
and
I
said
on
the
canal
bank
like
a
fool
but
whereabouts
on
your
*NL*
person
my
child
on
the
leg
behind
high
up
was
it
yes
rather
high
up
was
*NL*
it
where
you
sit
down
yes
O
Lord
couldnt
he
say
bottom
right
out
and
*NL*
have
done
with
it
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
and
did
you
whatever
*NL*
way
he
put
it
I
forget
no
father
and
I
always
think
of
the
real
father
*NL*
what
did
he
want
to
know
for
when
I
already
confessed
it
to
God
he
had
*NL*
a
nice
fat
hand
the
palm
moist
always
I
wouldnt
mind
feeling
it
neither
*NL*
would
he
Id
say
by
the
bullneck
in
his
horsecollar
I
wonder
did
he
know
*NL*
me
in
the
box
I
could
see
his
face
he
couldnt
see
mine
of
course
hed
*NL*
never
turn
or
let
on
still
his
eyes
were
red
when
his
father
died
theyre
*NL*
lost
for
a
woman
of
course
must
be
terrible
when
a
man
cries
let
alone
*NL*
them
Id
like
to
be
embraced
by
one
in
his
vestments
and
the
smell
of
*NL*
incense
off
him
like
the
pope
besides
theres
no
danger
with
a
priest
if
*NL*
youre
married
hes
too
careful
about
himself
then
give
something
to
H
*NL*
H
the
pope
for
a
penance
I
wonder
was
he
satisfied
with
me
one
thing
I
*NL*
didnt
like
his
slapping
me
behind
going
away
so
familiarly
in
the
hall
*NL*
though
I
laughed
Im
not
a
horse
or
an
ass
am
I
I
suppose
he
was
thinking
*NL*
of
his
fathers
I
wonder
is
he
awake
thinking
of
me
or
dreaming
am
I
in
*NL*
it
who
gave
him
that
flower
he
said
he
bought
he
smelt
of
some
kind
of
*NL*
drink
not
whisky
or
stout
or
perhaps
the
sweety
kind
of
paste
they
stick
*NL*
their
bills
up
with
some
liqueur
Id
like
to
sip
those
richlooking
green
*NL*
and
yellow
expensive
drinks
those
stagedoor
johnnies
drink
with
the
*NL*
opera
hats
I
tasted
once
with
my
finger
dipped
out
of
that
American
that
*NL*
had
the
squirrel
talking
stamps
with
father
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
*NL*
keep
himself
from
falling
asleep
after
the
last
time
after
we
took
the
*NL*
port
and
potted
meat
it
had
a
fine
salty
taste
yes
because
I
felt
lovely
*NL*
and
tired
myself
and
fell
asleep
as
sound
as
a
top
the
moment
I
popped
*NL*
straight
into
bed
till
that
thunder
woke
me
up
God
be
merciful
to
us
*NL*
I
thought
the
heavens
were
coming
down
about
us
to
punish
us
when
I
*NL*
blessed
myself
and
said
a
Hail
Mary
like
those
awful
thunderbolts
in
*NL*
Gibraltar
as
if
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
and
then
they
come
and
*NL*
tell
you
theres
no
God
what
could
you
do
if
it
was
running
and
rushing
*NL*
about
nothing
only
make
an
act
of
contrition
the
candle
I
lit
that
*NL*
evening
in
Whitefriars
street
chapel
for
the
month
of
May
see
it
brought
*NL*
its
luck
though
hed
scoff
if
he
heard
because
he
never
goes
to
church
*NL*
mass
or
meeting
he
says
your
soul
you
have
no
soul
inside
only
grey
*NL*
matter
because
he
doesnt
know
what
it
is
to
have
one
yes
when
I
lit
the
*NL*
lamp
because
he
must
have
come
3
or
4
times
with
that
tremendous
big
red
*NL*
brute
of
a
thing
he
has
I
thought
the
vein
or
whatever
the
dickens
they
*NL*
call
it
was
going
to
burst
though
his
nose
is
not
so
big
after
I
took
*NL*
off
all
my
things
with
the
blinds
down
after
my
hours
dressing
and
*NL*
perfuming
and
combing
it
like
iron
or
some
kind
of
a
thick
crowbar
*NL*
standing
all
the
time
he
must
have
eaten
oysters
I
think
a
few
dozen
he
*NL*
was
in
great
singing
voice
no
I
never
in
all
my
life
felt
anyone
had
*NL*
one
the
size
of
that
to
make
you
feel
full
up
he
must
have
eaten
a
whole
*NL*
sheep
after
whats
the
idea
making
us
like
that
with
a
big
hole
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
us
or
like
a
Stallion
driving
it
up
into
you
because
thats
all
*NL*
they
want
out
of
you
with
that
determined
vicious
look
in
his
eye
I
had
*NL*
to
halfshut
my
eyes
still
he
hasnt
such
a
tremendous
amount
of
spunk
in
*NL*
him
when
I
made
him
pull
out
and
do
it
on
me
considering
how
big
it
is
*NL*
so
much
the
better
in
case
any
of
it
wasnt
washed
out
properly
the
last
*NL*
time
I
let
him
finish
it
in
me
nice
invention
they
made
for
women
for
*NL*
him
to
get
all
the
pleasure
but
if
someone
gave
them
a
touch
of
it
*NL*
themselves
theyd
know
what
I
went
through
with
Milly
nobody
would
*NL*
believe
cutting
her
teeth
too
and
Mina
Purefoys
husband
give
us
a
swing
*NL*
out
of
your
whiskers
filling
her
up
with
a
child
or
twins
once
a
year
*NL*
as
regular
as
the
clock
always
with
a
smell
of
children
off
her
the
one
*NL*
they
called
budgers
or
something
like
a
nigger
with
a
shock
of
hair
on
*NL*
it
Jesusjack
the
child
is
a
black
the
last
time
I
was
there
a
squad
of
*NL*
them
falling
over
one
another
and
bawling
you
couldnt
hear
your
ears
*NL*
supposed
to
be
healthy
not
satisfied
till
they
have
us
swollen
out
like
*NL*
elephants
or
I
dont
know
what
supposing
I
risked
having
another
not
off
*NL*
him
though
still
if
he
was
married
Im
sure
hed
have
a
fine
strong
child
*NL*
but
I
dont
know
Poldy
has
more
spunk
in
him
yes
thatd
be
awfully
jolly
*NL*
I
suppose
it
was
meeting
Josie
Powell
and
the
funeral
and
thinking
about
*NL*
me
and
Boylan
set
him
off
well
he
can
think
what
he
likes
now
if
thatll
*NL*
do
him
any
good
I
know
they
were
spooning
a
bit
when
I
came
on
the
scene
*NL*
he
was
dancing
and
sitting
out
with
her
the
night
of
Georgina
Simpsons
*NL*
housewarming
and
then
he
wanted
to
ram
it
down
my
neck
it
was
on
account
*NL*
of
not
liking
to
see
her
a
wallflower
that
was
why
we
had
the
standup
*NL*
row
over
politics
he
began
it
not
me
when
he
said
about
Our
Lord
being
a
*NL*
carpenter
at
last
he
made
me
cry
of
course
a
woman
is
so
sensitive
about
*NL*
everything
I
was
fuming
with
myself
after
for
giving
in
only
for
I
knew
*NL*
he
was
gone
on
me
and
the
first
socialist
he
said
He
was
he
annoyed
me
*NL*
so
much
I
couldnt
put
him
into
a
temper
still
he
knows
a
lot
of
mixedup
*NL*
things
especially
about
the
body
and
the
inside
I
often
wanted
to
study
*NL*
up
that
myself
what
we
have
inside
us
in
that
family
physician
I
could
*NL*
always
hear
his
voice
talking
when
the
room
was
crowded
and
watch
him
*NL*
after
that
I
pretended
I
had
a
coolness
on
with
her
over
him
because
he
*NL*
used
to
be
a
bit
on
the
jealous
side
whenever
he
asked
who
are
you
going
*NL*
to
and
I
said
over
to
Floey
and
he
made
me
the
present
of
Byron
's
poems
*NL*
and
the
three
pairs
of
gloves
so
that
finished
that
I
could
quite
easily
*NL*
get
him
to
make
it
up
any
time
I
know
how
Id
even
supposing
he
got
in
*NL*
with
her
again
and
was
going
out
to
see
her
somewhere
Id
know
if
he
*NL*
refused
to
eat
the
onions
I
know
plenty
of
ways
ask
him
to
tuck
down
the
*NL*
collar
of
my
blouse
or
touch
him
with
my
veil
and
gloves
on
going
out
I
*NL*
kiss
then
would
send
them
all
spinning
however
alright
well
see
then
let
*NL*
him
go
to
her
she
of
course
would
only
be
too
delighted
to
pretend
shes
*NL*
mad
in
love
with
him
that
I
wouldnt
so
much
mind
Id
just
go
to
her
and
*NL*
ask
her
do
you
love
him
and
look
her
square
in
the
eyes
she
couldnt
fool
*NL*
me
but
he
might
imagine
he
was
and
make
a
declaration
to
her
with
his
*NL*
plabbery
kind
of
a
manner
like
he
did
to
me
though
I
had
the
devils
own
*NL*
job
to
get
it
out
of
him
though
I
liked
him
for
that
it
showed
he
could
*NL*
hold
in
and
wasnt
to
be
got
for
the
asking
he
was
on
the
pop
of
asking
*NL*
me
too
the
night
in
the
kitchen
I
was
rolling
the
potato
cake
theres
*NL*
something
I
want
to
say
to
you
only
for
I
put
him
off
letting
on
I
was
*NL*
in
a
temper
with
my
hands
and
arms
full
of
pasty
flour
in
any
case
I
let
*NL*
out
too
much
the
night
before
talking
of
dreams
so
I
didnt
want
to
let
*NL*
him
know
more
than
was
good
for
him
she
used
to
be
always
embracing
me
*NL*
Josie
whenever
he
was
there
meaning
him
of
course
glauming
me
over
and
*NL*
when
I
said
I
washed
up
and
down
as
far
as
possible
asking
me
and
did
*NL*
you
wash
possible
the
women
are
always
egging
on
to
that
putting
it
on
*NL*
thick
when
hes
there
they
know
by
his
sly
eye
blinking
a
bit
putting
on
*NL*
the
indifferent
when
they
come
out
with
something
the
kind
he
is
what
*NL*
spoils
him
I
dont
wonder
in
the
least
because
he
was
very
handsome
at
*NL*
that
time
trying
to
look
like
Lord
Byron
I
said
I
liked
though
he
*NL*
was
too
beautiful
for
a
man
and
he
was
a
little
before
we
got
engaged
*NL*
afterwards
though
she
didnt
like
it
so
much
the
day
I
was
in
fits
of
*NL*
laughing
with
the
giggles
I
couldnt
stop
about
all
my
hairpins
falling
*NL*
out
one
after
another
with
the
mass
of
hair
I
had
youre
always
in
great
*NL*
humour
she
said
yes
because
it
grigged
her
because
she
knew
what
it
*NL*
meant
because
I
used
to
tell
her
a
good
bit
of
what
went
on
between
us
*NL*
not
all
but
just
enough
to
make
her
mouth
water
but
that
wasnt
my
fault
*NL*
she
didnt
darken
the
door
much
after
we
were
married
I
wonder
what
shes
*NL*
got
like
now
after
living
with
that
dotty
husband
of
hers
she
had
her
*NL*
face
beginning
to
look
drawn
and
run
down
the
last
time
I
saw
her
she
*NL*
must
have
been
just
after
a
row
with
him
because
I
saw
on
the
moment
she
*NL*
was
edging
to
draw
down
a
conversation
about
husbands
and
talk
about
him
*NL*
to
run
him
down
what
was
it
she
told
me
O
yes
that
sometimes
he
used
to
*NL*
go
to
bed
with
his
muddy
boots
on
when
the
maggot
takes
him
just
imagine
*NL*
having
to
get
into
bed
with
a
thing
like
that
that
might
murder
you
*NL*
any
moment
what
a
man
well
its
not
the
one
way
everyone
goes
mad
Poldy
*NL*
anyhow
whatever
he
does
always
wipes
his
feet
on
the
mat
when
he
comes
*NL*
in
wet
or
shine
and
always
blacks
his
own
boots
too
and
he
always
takes
*NL*
off
his
hat
when
he
comes
up
in
the
street
like
then
and
now
hes
going
*NL*
about
in
his
slippers
to
look
for
10000
pounds
for
a
postcard
U
p
up
*NL*
O
sweetheart
May
wouldnt
a
thing
like
that
simply
bore
you
stiff
to
*NL*
extinction
actually
too
stupid
even
to
take
his
boots
off
now
what
*NL*
could
you
make
of
a
man
like
that
Id
rather
die
20
times
over
than
marry
*NL*
another
of
their
sex
of
course
hed
never
find
another
woman
like
me
to
*NL*
put
up
with
him
the
way
I
do
know
me
come
sleep
with
me
yes
and
he
knows
*NL*
that
too
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
take
that
Mrs
Maybrick
that
poisoned
*NL*
her
husband
for
what
I
wonder
in
love
with
some
other
man
yes
it
was
*NL*
found
out
on
her
wasnt
she
the
downright
villain
to
go
and
do
a
thing
*NL*
like
that
of
course
some
men
can
be
dreadfully
aggravating
drive
you
mad
*NL*
and
always
the
worst
word
in
the
world
what
do
they
ask
us
to
marry
them
*NL*
for
if
were
so
bad
as
all
that
comes
to
yes
because
they
cant
get
on
*NL*
without
us
white
Arsenic
she
put
in
his
tea
off
flypaper
wasnt
it
I
*NL*
wonder
why
they
call
it
that
if
I
asked
him
hed
say
its
from
the
Greek
*NL*
leave
us
as
wise
as
we
were
before
she
must
have
been
madly
in
love
with
*NL*
the
other
fellow
to
run
the
chance
of
being
hanged
O
she
didnt
care
if
*NL*
that
was
her
nature
what
could
she
do
besides
theyre
not
brutes
enough
*NL*
to
go
and
hang
a
woman
surely
are
they
*NL*
*NL*
theyre
all
so
different
Boylan
talking
about
the
shape
of
my
foot
he
*NL*
noticed
at
once
even
before
he
was
introduced
when
I
was
in
the
D
B
C
*NL*
with
Poldy
laughing
and
trying
to
listen
I
was
waggling
my
foot
we
both
*NL*
ordered
2
teas
and
plain
bread
and
butter
I
saw
him
looking
with
his
*NL*
two
old
maids
of
sisters
when
I
stood
up
and
asked
the
girl
where
it
was
*NL*
what
do
I
care
with
it
dropping
out
of
me
and
that
black
closed
breeches
*NL*
he
made
me
buy
takes
you
half
an
hour
to
let
them
down
wetting
all
*NL*
myself
always
with
some
brandnew
fad
every
other
week
such
a
long
one
I
*NL*
did
I
forgot
my
suede
gloves
on
the
seat
behind
that
I
never
got
after
*NL*
some
robber
of
a
woman
and
he
wanted
me
to
put
it
in
the
Irish
times
*NL*
lost
in
the
ladies
lavatory
D
B
C
Dame
street
finder
return
to
Mrs
*NL*
Marion
Bloom
and
I
saw
his
eyes
on
my
feet
going
out
through
the
turning
*NL*
door
he
was
looking
when
I
looked
back
and
I
went
there
for
tea
2
days
*NL*
after
in
the
hope
but
he
wasnt
now
how
did
that
excite
him
because
I
was
*NL*
crossing
them
when
we
were
in
the
other
room
first
he
meant
the
shoes
*NL*
that
are
too
tight
to
walk
in
my
hand
is
nice
like
that
if
I
only
had
a
*NL*
ring
with
the
stone
for
my
month
a
nice
aquamarine
Ill
stick
him
for
one
*NL*
and
a
gold
bracelet
I
dont
like
my
foot
so
much
still
I
made
him
spend
*NL*
once
with
my
foot
the
night
after
Goodwins
botchup
of
a
concert
so
cold
*NL*
and
windy
it
was
well
we
had
that
rum
in
the
house
to
mull
and
the
fire
*NL*
wasnt
black
out
when
he
asked
to
take
off
my
stockings
lying
on
the
*NL*
hearthrug
in
Lombard
street
west
and
another
time
it
was
my
muddy
boots
*NL*
hed
like
me
to
walk
in
all
the
horses
dung
I
could
find
but
of
course
*NL*
hes
not
natural
like
the
rest
of
the
world
that
I
what
did
he
say
I
*NL*
could
give
9
points
in
10
to
Katty
Lanner
and
beat
her
what
does
that
*NL*
mean
I
asked
him
I
forget
what
he
said
because
the
stoppress
edition
*NL*
just
passed
and
the
man
with
the
curly
hair
in
the
Lucan
dairy
thats
so
*NL*
polite
I
think
I
saw
his
face
before
somewhere
I
noticed
him
when
I
was
*NL*
tasting
the
butter
so
I
took
my
time
Bartell
dArcy
too
that
he
used
to
*NL*
make
fun
of
when
he
commenced
kissing
me
on
the
choir
stairs
after
I
*NL*
sang
Gounods
_
Ave
Maria
_
what
are
we
waiting
for
O
my
heart
kiss
me
*NL*
straight
on
the
brow
and
part
which
is
my
brown
part
he
was
pretty
hot
*NL*
for
all
his
tinny
voice
too
my
low
notes
he
was
always
raving
about
if
*NL*
you
can
believe
him
I
liked
the
way
he
used
his
mouth
singing
then
he
*NL*
said
wasnt
it
terrible
to
do
that
there
in
a
place
like
that
I
dont
see
*NL*
anything
so
terrible
about
it
Ill
tell
him
about
that
some
day
not
now
*NL*
and
surprise
him
ay
and
Ill
take
him
there
and
show
him
the
very
place
*NL*
too
we
did
it
so
now
there
you
are
like
it
or
lump
it
he
thinks
nothing
*NL*
can
happen
without
him
knowing
he
hadnt
an
idea
about
my
mother
till
we
*NL*
were
engaged
otherwise
hed
never
have
got
me
so
cheap
as
he
did
he
was
*NL*
lo
times
worse
himself
anyhow
begging
me
to
give
him
a
tiny
bit
cut
off
*NL*
my
drawers
that
was
the
evening
coming
along
Kenilworth
square
he
kissed
*NL*
me
in
the
eye
of
my
glove
and
I
had
to
take
it
off
asking
me
questions
*NL*
is
it
permitted
to
enquire
the
shape
of
my
bedroom
so
I
let
him
keep
it
*NL*
as
if
I
forgot
it
to
think
of
me
when
I
saw
him
slip
it
into
his
pocket
*NL*
of
course
hes
mad
on
the
subject
of
drawers
thats
plain
to
be
seen
*NL*
always
skeezing
at
those
brazenfaced
things
on
the
bicycles
with
their
*NL*
skirts
blowing
up
to
their
navels
even
when
Milly
and
I
were
out
with
*NL*
him
at
the
open
air
fete
that
one
in
the
cream
muslin
standing
right
*NL*
against
the
sun
so
he
could
see
every
atom
she
had
on
when
he
saw
me
*NL*
from
behind
following
in
the
rain
I
saw
him
before
he
saw
me
however
*NL*
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
Harolds
cross
road
with
a
new
raincoat
on
*NL*
him
with
the
muffler
in
the
Zingari
colours
to
show
off
his
complexion
*NL*
and
the
brown
hat
looking
slyboots
as
usual
what
was
he
doing
there
*NL*
where
hed
no
business
they
can
go
and
get
whatever
they
like
from
*NL*
anything
at
all
with
a
skirt
on
it
and
were
not
to
ask
any
questions
but
*NL*
they
want
to
know
where
were
you
where
are
you
going
I
could
feel
him
*NL*
coming
along
skulking
after
me
his
eyes
on
my
neck
he
had
been
keeping
*NL*
away
from
the
house
he
felt
it
was
getting
too
warm
for
him
so
I
*NL*
halfturned
and
stopped
then
he
pestered
me
to
say
yes
till
I
took
off
my
*NL*
glove
slowly
watching
him
he
said
my
openwork
sleeves
were
too
cold
for
*NL*
the
rain
anything
for
an
excuse
to
put
his
hand
anear
me
drawers
drawers
*NL*
the
whole
blessed
time
till
I
promised
to
give
him
the
pair
off
my
doll
*NL*
to
carry
about
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
_
O
Maria
Santisima
_
he
did
look
*NL*
a
big
fool
dreeping
in
the
rain
splendid
set
of
teeth
he
had
made
me
*NL*
hungry
to
look
at
them
and
beseeched
of
me
to
lift
the
orange
petticoat
*NL*
I
had
on
with
the
sunray
pleats
that
there
was
nobody
he
said
hed
kneel
*NL*
down
in
the
wet
if
I
didnt
so
persevering
he
would
too
and
ruin
his
new
*NL*
raincoat
you
never
know
what
freak
theyd
take
alone
with
you
theyre
so
*NL*
savage
for
it
if
anyone
was
passing
so
I
lifted
them
a
bit
and
touched
*NL*
his
trousers
outside
the
way
I
used
to
Gardner
after
with
my
ring
hand
*NL*
to
keep
him
from
doing
worse
where
it
was
too
public
I
was
dying
to
find
*NL*
out
was
he
circumcised
he
was
shaking
like
a
jelly
all
over
they
want
*NL*
to
do
everything
too
quick
take
all
the
pleasure
out
of
it
and
father
*NL*
waiting
all
the
time
for
his
dinner
he
told
me
to
say
I
left
my
purse
in
*NL*
the
butchers
and
had
to
go
back
for
it
what
a
Deceiver
then
he
wrote
me
*NL*
that
letter
with
all
those
words
in
it
how
could
he
have
the
face
to
any
*NL*
woman
after
his
company
manners
making
it
so
awkward
after
when
we
met
*NL*
asking
me
have
I
offended
you
with
my
eyelids
down
of
course
he
saw
I
*NL*
wasnt
he
had
a
few
brains
not
like
that
other
fool
Henny
Doyle
he
was
*NL*
always
breaking
or
tearing
something
in
the
charades
I
hate
an
unlucky
*NL*
man
and
if
I
knew
what
it
meant
of
course
I
had
to
say
no
for
form
sake
*NL*
dont
understand
you
I
said
and
wasnt
it
natural
so
it
is
of
course
*NL*
it
used
to
be
written
up
with
a
picture
of
a
womans
on
that
wall
in
*NL*
Gibraltar
with
that
word
I
couldnt
find
anywhere
only
for
children
*NL*
seeing
it
too
young
then
writing
every
morning
a
letter
sometimes
twice
*NL*
a
day
I
liked
the
way
he
made
love
then
he
knew
the
way
to
take
a
woman
*NL*
when
he
sent
me
the
8
big
poppies
because
mine
was
the
8th
then
I
wrote
*NL*
the
night
he
kissed
my
heart
at
Dolphins
barn
I
couldnt
describe
it
*NL*
simply
it
makes
you
feel
like
nothing
on
earth
but
he
never
knew
how
to
*NL*
embrace
well
like
Gardner
I
hope
hell
come
on
Monday
as
he
said
at
the
*NL*
same
time
four
I
hate
people
who
come
at
all
hours
answer
the
door
you
*NL*
think
its
the
vegetables
then
its
somebody
and
you
all
undressed
or
*NL*
the
door
of
the
filthy
sloppy
kitchen
blows
open
the
day
old
frostyface
*NL*
Goodwin
called
about
the
concert
in
Lombard
street
and
I
just
after
*NL*
dinner
all
flushed
and
tossed
with
boiling
old
stew
dont
look
at
me
*NL*
professor
I
had
to
say
Im
a
fright
yes
but
he
was
a
real
old
gent
in
his
*NL*
way
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
respectful
nobody
to
say
youre
out
you
*NL*
have
to
peep
out
through
the
blind
like
the
messengerboy
today
I
thought
*NL*
it
was
a
putoff
first
him
sending
the
port
and
the
peaches
first
and
I
*NL*
was
just
beginning
to
yawn
with
nerves
thinking
he
was
trying
to
make
a
*NL*
fool
of
me
when
I
knew
his
tattarrattat
at
the
door
he
must
have
been
*NL*
a
bit
late
because
it
was
l/4
after
3
when
I
saw
the
2
Dedalus
girls
*NL*
coming
from
school
I
never
know
the
time
even
that
watch
he
gave
me
*NL*
never
seems
to
go
properly
Id
want
to
get
it
looked
after
when
I
threw
*NL*
the
penny
to
that
lame
sailor
for
England
home
and
beauty
when
I
was
*NL*
whistling
there
is
a
charming
girl
I
love
and
I
hadnt
even
put
on
my
*NL*
clean
shift
or
powdered
myself
or
a
thing
then
this
day
week
were
to
go
*NL*
to
Belfast
just
as
well
he
has
to
go
to
Ennis
his
fathers
anniversary
*NL*
the
27th
it
wouldnt
be
pleasant
if
he
did
suppose
our
rooms
at
the
hotel
*NL*
were
beside
each
other
and
any
fooling
went
on
in
the
new
bed
I
couldnt
*NL*
tell
him
to
stop
and
not
bother
me
with
him
in
the
next
room
or
perhaps
*NL*
some
protestant
clergyman
with
a
cough
knocking
on
the
wall
then
hed
*NL*
never
believe
the
next
day
we
didnt
do
something
its
all
very
well
a
*NL*
husband
but
you
cant
fool
a
lover
after
me
telling
him
we
never
did
*NL*
anything
of
course
he
didnt
believe
me
no
its
better
hes
going
where
*NL*
he
is
besides
something
always
happens
with
him
the
time
going
to
the
*NL*
Mallow
concert
at
Maryborough
ordering
boiling
soup
for
the
two
of
*NL*
us
then
the
bell
rang
out
he
walks
down
the
platform
with
the
soup
*NL*
splashing
about
taking
spoonfuls
of
it
hadnt
he
the
nerve
and
the
waiter
*NL*
after
him
making
a
holy
show
of
us
screeching
and
confusion
for
the
*NL*
engine
to
start
but
he
wouldnt
pay
till
he
finished
it
the
two
gentlemen
*NL*
in
the
3rd
class
carriage
said
he
was
quite
right
so
he
was
too
hes
so
*NL*
pigheaded
sometimes
when
he
gets
a
thing
into
his
head
a
good
job
he
was
*NL*
able
to
open
the
carriage
door
with
his
knife
or
theyd
have
taken
us
on
*NL*
to
Cork
I
suppose
that
was
done
out
of
revenge
on
him
O
I
love
jaunting
*NL*
in
a
train
or
a
car
with
lovely
soft
cushions
I
wonder
will
he
take
*NL*
a
1st
class
for
me
he
might
want
to
do
it
in
the
train
by
tipping
the
*NL*
guard
well
O
I
suppose
therell
be
the
usual
idiots
of
men
gaping
at
*NL*
us
with
their
eyes
as
stupid
as
ever
they
can
possibly
be
that
was
an
*NL*
exceptional
man
that
common
workman
that
left
us
alone
in
the
carriage
*NL*
that
day
going
to
Howth
Id
like
to
find
out
something
about
him
l
or
2
*NL*
tunnels
perhaps
then
you
have
to
look
out
of
the
window
all
the
nicer
*NL*
then
coming
back
suppose
I
never
came
back
what
would
they
say
eloped
*NL*
with
him
that
gets
you
on
on
the
stage
the
last
concert
I
sang
at
where
*NL*
its
over
a
year
ago
when
was
it
St
Teresas
hall
Clarendon
St
little
*NL*
chits
of
missies
they
have
now
singing
Kathleen
Kearney
and
her
like
*NL*
on
account
of
father
being
in
the
army
and
my
singing
the
absentminded
*NL*
beggar
and
wearing
a
brooch
for
Lord
Roberts
when
I
had
the
map
of
it
*NL*
all
and
Poldy
not
Irish
enough
was
it
him
managed
it
this
time
I
wouldnt
*NL*
put
it
past
him
like
he
got
me
on
to
sing
in
the
_
Stabat
Mater
_
by
going
*NL*
around
saying
he
was
putting
Lead
Kindly
Light
to
music
I
put
him
up
to
*NL*
that
till
the
jesuits
found
out
he
was
a
freemason
thumping
the
piano
*NL*
lead
Thou
me
on
copied
from
some
old
opera
yes
and
he
was
going
about
*NL*
with
some
of
them
Sinner
Fein
lately
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
*NL*
talking
his
usual
trash
and
nonsense
he
says
that
little
man
he
showed
*NL*
me
without
the
neck
is
very
intelligent
the
coming
man
Griffiths
is
he
*NL*
well
he
doesnt
look
it
thats
all
I
can
say
still
it
must
have
been
him
*NL*
he
knew
there
was
a
boycott
I
hate
the
mention
of
their
politics
after
*NL*
the
war
that
Pretoria
and
Ladysmith
and
Bloemfontein
where
Gardner
lieut
*NL*
Stanley
G
8th
Bn
2nd
East
Lancs
Rgt
of
enteric
fever
he
was
a
lovely
*NL*
fellow
in
khaki
and
just
the
right
height
over
me
Im
sure
he
was
brave
*NL*
too
he
said
I
was
lovely
the
evening
we
kissed
goodbye
at
the
canal
lock
*NL*
my
Irish
beauty
he
was
pale
with
excitement
about
going
away
or
wed
be
*NL*
seen
from
the
road
he
couldnt
stand
properly
and
I
so
hot
as
I
never
*NL*
felt
they
could
have
made
their
peace
in
the
beginning
or
old
oom
Paul
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
the
other
old
Krugers
go
and
fight
it
out
between
them
*NL*
instead
of
dragging
on
for
years
killing
any
finelooking
men
there
were
*NL*
with
their
fever
if
he
was
even
decently
shot
it
wouldnt
have
been
so
*NL*
bad
I
love
to
see
a
regiment
pass
in
review
the
first
time
I
saw
the
*NL*
Spanish
cavalry
at
La
Roque
it
was
lovely
after
looking
across
the
bay
*NL*
from
Algeciras
all
the
lights
of
the
rock
like
fireflies
or
those
sham
*NL*
battles
on
the
15
acres
the
Black
Watch
with
their
kilts
in
time
at
the
*NL*
march
past
the
10th
hussars
the
prince
of
Wales
own
or
the
lancers
O
the
*NL*
lancers
theyre
grand
or
the
Dublins
that
won
Tugela
his
father
made
his
*NL*
money
over
selling
the
horses
for
the
cavalry
well
he
could
buy
me
a
*NL*
nice
present
up
in
Belfast
after
what
I
gave
him
theyve
lovely
linen
up
*NL*
there
or
one
of
those
nice
kimono
things
I
must
buy
a
mothball
like
I
*NL*
had
before
to
keep
in
the
drawer
with
them
it
would
be
exciting
going
*NL*
round
with
him
shopping
buying
those
things
in
a
new
city
better
leave
*NL*
this
ring
behind
want
to
keep
turning
and
turning
to
get
it
over
the
*NL*
knuckle
there
or
they
might
bell
it
round
the
town
in
their
papers
or
*NL*
tell
the
police
on
me
but
theyd
think
were
married
O
let
them
all
go
and
*NL*
smother
themselves
for
the
fat
lot
I
care
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
hes
*NL*
not
a
marrying
man
so
somebody
better
get
it
out
of
him
if
I
could
find
*NL*
out
whether
he
likes
me
I
looked
a
bit
washy
of
course
when
I
looked
*NL*
close
in
the
handglass
powdering
a
mirror
never
gives
you
the
expression
*NL*
besides
scrooching
down
on
me
like
that
all
the
time
with
his
big
*NL*
hipbones
hes
heavy
too
with
his
hairy
chest
for
this
heat
always
having
*NL*
to
lie
down
for
them
better
for
him
put
it
into
me
from
behind
the
way
*NL*
Mrs
Mastiansky
told
me
her
husband
made
her
like
the
dogs
do
it
and
*NL*
stick
out
her
tongue
as
far
as
ever
she
could
and
he
so
quiet
and
mild
*NL*
with
his
tingating
cither
can
you
ever
be
up
to
men
the
way
it
takes
*NL*
them
lovely
stuff
in
that
blue
suit
he
had
on
and
stylish
tie
and
socks
*NL*
with
the
skyblue
silk
things
on
them
hes
certainly
well
off
I
know
by
*NL*
the
cut
his
clothes
have
and
his
heavy
watch
but
he
was
like
a
perfect
*NL*
devil
for
a
few
minutes
after
he
came
back
with
the
stoppress
tearing
up
*NL*
the
tickets
and
swearing
blazes
because
he
lost
20
quid
he
said
he
lost
*NL*
over
that
outsider
that
won
and
half
he
put
on
for
me
on
account
of
*NL*
Lenehans
tip
cursing
him
to
the
lowest
pits
that
sponger
he
was
making
*NL*
free
with
me
after
the
Glencree
dinner
coming
back
that
long
joult
over
*NL*
the
featherbed
mountain
after
the
lord
Mayor
looking
at
me
with
his
*NL*
dirty
eyes
Val
Dillon
that
big
heathen
I
first
noticed
him
at
dessert
*NL*
when
I
was
cracking
the
nuts
with
my
teeth
I
wished
I
could
have
picked
*NL*
every
morsel
of
that
chicken
out
of
my
fingers
it
was
so
tasty
*NL*
and
browned
and
as
tender
as
anything
only
for
I
didnt
want
to
eat
*NL*
everything
on
my
plate
those
forks
and
fishslicers
were
hallmarked
*NL*
silver
too
I
wish
I
had
some
I
could
easily
have
slipped
a
couple
into
*NL*
my
muff
when
I
was
playing
with
them
then
always
hanging
out
of
them
for
*NL*
money
in
a
restaurant
for
the
bit
you
put
down
your
throat
we
have
to
*NL*
be
thankful
for
our
mangy
cup
of
tea
itself
as
a
great
compliment
to
be
*NL*
noticed
the
way
the
world
is
divided
in
any
case
if
its
going
to
go
on
I
*NL*
want
at
least
two
other
good
chemises
for
one
thing
and
but
I
dont
know
*NL*
what
kind
of
drawers
he
likes
none
at
all
I
think
didnt
he
say
yes
and
*NL*
half
the
girls
in
Gibraltar
never
wore
them
either
naked
as
God
made
*NL*
them
that
Andalusian
singing
her
Manola
she
didnt
make
much
secret
of
*NL*
what
she
hadnt
yes
and
the
second
pair
of
silkette
stockings
is
laddered
*NL*
after
one
days
wear
I
could
have
brought
them
back
to
Lewers
this
*NL*
morning
and
kicked
up
a
row
and
made
that
one
change
them
only
not
to
*NL*
upset
myself
and
run
the
risk
of
walking
into
him
and
ruining
the
whole
*NL*
thing
and
one
of
those
kidfitting
corsets
Id
want
advertised
cheap
in
*NL*
the
Gentlewoman
with
elastic
gores
on
the
hips
he
saved
the
one
I
have
*NL*
but
thats
no
good
what
did
they
say
they
give
a
delightful
figure
line
*NL*
11/6
obviating
that
unsightly
broad
appearance
across
the
lower
back
to
*NL*
reduce
flesh
my
belly
is
a
bit
too
big
Ill
have
to
knock
off
the
*NL*
stout
at
dinner
or
am
I
getting
too
fond
of
it
the
last
they
sent
from
*NL*
ORourkes
was
as
flat
as
a
pancake
he
makes
his
money
easy
Larry
they
*NL*
call
him
the
old
mangy
parcel
he
sent
at
Xmas
a
cottage
cake
and
a
*NL*
bottle
of
hogwash
he
tried
to
palm
off
as
claret
that
he
couldnt
get
*NL*
anyone
to
drink
God
spare
his
spit
for
fear
hed
die
of
the
drouth
or
*NL*
I
must
do
a
few
breathing
exercises
I
wonder
is
that
antifat
any
good
*NL*
might
overdo
it
the
thin
ones
are
not
so
much
the
fashion
now
garters
*NL*
that
much
I
have
the
violet
pair
I
wore
today
thats
all
he
bought
me
*NL*
out
of
the
cheque
he
got
on
the
first
O
no
there
was
the
face
lotion
*NL*
I
finished
the
last
of
yesterday
that
made
my
skin
like
new
I
told
him
*NL*
over
and
over
again
get
that
made
up
in
the
same
place
and
dont
forget
*NL*
it
God
only
knows
whether
he
did
after
all
I
said
to
him
111
know
by
*NL*
the
bottle
anyway
if
not
I
suppose
111
only
have
to
wash
in
my
piss
like
*NL*
beeftea
or
chickensoup
with
some
of
that
opoponax
and
violet
I
thought
*NL*
it
was
beginning
to
look
coarse
or
old
a
bit
the
skin
underneath
is
much
*NL*
finer
where
it
peeled
off
there
on
my
finger
after
the
burn
its
a
pity
*NL*
it
isnt
all
like
that
and
the
four
paltry
handkerchiefs
about
6
/
-
in
all
*NL*
sure
you
cant
get
on
in
this
world
without
style
all
going
in
food
and
*NL*
rent
when
I
get
it
Ill
lash
it
around
I
tell
you
in
fine
style
I
always
*NL*
want
to
throw
a
handful
of
tea
into
the
pot
measuring
and
mincing
if
*NL*
I
buy
a
pair
of
old
brogues
itself
do
you
like
those
new
shoes
yes
how
*NL*
much
were
they
Ive
no
clothes
at
all
the
brown
costume
and
the
skirt
and
*NL*
jacket
and
the
one
at
the
cleaners
3
whats
that
for
any
woman
cutting
*NL*
up
this
old
hat
and
patching
up
the
other
the
men
wont
look
at
you
and
*NL*
women
try
to
walk
on
you
because
they
know
youve

with
all
*NL*
the
things

the
4
years

of

*NL*
I

beautys
on
the
wane
she
was
a
lovely
woman
*NL*
magnificent
head
of
hair
on
her
down
to
her
waist
tossing
it
back
like
*NL*
that
like
Kitty
OShea
in
Grantham
street
1st
thing
I
did
every
morning
*NL*
to
look
across
see
her
combing
it
as
if
she
loved
it
and
was
full
of
it
*NL*
pity

day
before

left
and
that
Mrs
Langtry
*NL*
the
jersey
lily
the
prince
of
Wales

for
the
name
of
a
king

all
*NL*
made

one
way

black

the
jealous
old
husband
what
*NL*
was
it
at
all
and
an
oyster
knife
he
went
no
he
made
her
wear
a
kind
*NL*
of
a
tin
thing
round
her
and
the
prince
of
Wales
yes
he
had
the
oyster
*NL*
knife
cant
be
true
a
thing
like
that
like
some
of
those
books
he
brings
*NL*
me
the
works
of
Master
Francois
Somebody
supposed
to
be
a
priest
about
*NL*
a
child
born
out
of
her
ear
because
her
bumgut
fell
out
a
nice
word
for
*NL*
any
priest
to
write
and
her
a
--
e
as
if
any
fool
wouldnt
know
what
that
*NL*
meant
I
hate
that
pretending
of
all
things
with
that
old
blackguards
*NL*
face
on
him
anybody
can
see
its
not
true
and
that
Ruby
and
Fair
Tyrants
*NL*
he
brought
me
that
twice
I
remember
when
I
came
to
page
5
o
the
part
*NL*
about
where
she
hangs
him
up
out
of
a
hook
with
a
cord
flagellate
*NL*
sure
theres
nothing
for
a
woman
in
that
all
invention
made
up
about
he
*NL*
drinking
the
champagne
out
of
her
slipper
after
the
ball
was
over
like
*NL*
the
infant
Jesus
in
the
crib
at
Inchicore
in
the
Blessed
Virgins
arms
*NL*
sure
no
woman
could
have
a
child
that
big
taken
out
of
her
and
I
thought
*NL*
first
it
came
out
of
her
side
because
how
could
she
go
to
the
chamber
*NL*
when
she
wanted
to
and
she
a
rich
lady
of
course
she
felt
honoured
H
R
H
*NL*
he
was
in
Gibraltar
the
year
I
was
born
I
bet
he
found
lilies
there
too
*NL*
where
he
planted
the
tree
he
planted
more
than
that
in
his
time
he
might
*NL*
have
planted
me
too
if
hed
come
a
bit
sooner
then
I
wouldnt
be
here
as
*NL*
I
am
he
ought
to
chuck
that
Freeman
with
the
paltry
few
shillings
*NL*
he
knocks
out
of
it
and
go
into
an
office
or
something
where
hed
get
*NL*
regular
pay
or
a
bank
where
they
could
put
him
up
on
a
throne
to
count
*NL*
the
money
all
the
day
of
course
he
prefers
plottering
about
the
house
*NL*
so
you
cant
stir
with
him
any
side
whats
your
programme
today
I
wish
hed
*NL*
even
smoke
a
pipe
like
father
to
get
the
smell
of
a
man
or
pretending
*NL*
to
be
mooching
about
for
advertisements
when
he
could
have
been
in
Mr
*NL*
Cuffes
still
only
for
what
he
did
then
sending
me
to
try
and
patch
it
up
*NL*
I
could
have
got
him
promoted
there
to
be
the
manager
he
gave
me
a
great
*NL*
mirada
once
or
twice
first
he
was
as
stiff
as
the
mischief
really
and
*NL*
truly
Mrs
Bloom
only
I
felt
rotten
simply
with
the
old
rubbishy
dress
*NL*
that
I
lost
the
leads
out
of
the
tails
with
no
cut
in
it
but
theyre
*NL*
coming
into
fashion
again
I
bought
it
simply
to
please
him
I
knew
it
was
*NL*
no
good
by
the
finish
pity
I
changed
my
mind
of
going
to
Todd
and
Bums
*NL*
as
I
said
and
not
Lees
it
was
just
like
the
shop
itself
rummage
sale
a
*NL*
lot
of
trash
I
hate
those
rich
shops
get
on
your
nerves
nothing
kills
me
*NL*
altogether
only
he
thinks
he
knows
a
great
lot
about
a
womans
dress
and
*NL*
cooking
mathering
everything
he
can
scour
off
the
shelves
into
it
if
*NL*
I
went
by
his
advices
every
blessed
hat
I
put
on
does
that
suit
me
yes
*NL*
take
that
thats
alright
the
one
like
a
weddingcake
standing
up
miles
*NL*
off
my
head
he
said
suited
me
or
the
dishcover
one
coming
down
on
my
*NL*
backside
on
pins
and
needles
about
the
shopgirl
in
that
place
in
Grafton
*NL*
street
I
had
the
misfortune
to
bring
him
into
and
she
as
insolent
as
*NL*
ever
she
could
be
with
her
smirk
saying
Im
afraid
were
giving
you
too
*NL*
much
trouble
what
shes
there
for
but
I
stared
it
out
of
her
yes
he
was
*NL*
awfully
stiff
and
no
wonder
but
he
changed
the
second
time
he
looked
*NL*
Poldy
pigheaded
as
usual
like
the
soup
but
I
could
see
him
looking
very
*NL*
hard
at
my
chest
when
he
stood
up
to
open
the
door
for
me
it
was
nice
of
*NL*
him
to
show
me
out
in
any
case
Im
extremely
sorry
Mrs
Bloom
believe
me
*NL*
without
making
it
too
marked
the
first
time
after
him
being
insulted
and
*NL*
me
being
supposed
to
be
his
wife
I
just
half
smiled
I
know
my
chest
was
*NL*
out
that
way
at
the
door
when
he
said
Im
extremely
sorry
and
Im
sure
you
*NL*
were
*NL*
*NL*
yes
I
think
he
made
them
a
bit
firmer
sucking
them
like
that
so
long
he
*NL*
made
me
thirsty
titties
he
calls
them
I
had
to
laugh
yes
this
one
anyhow
*NL*
stiff
the
nipple
gets
for
the
least
thing
Ill
get
him
to
keep
that
up
*NL*
and
Ill
take
those
eggs
beaten
up
with
marsala
fatten
them
out
for
him
*NL*
what
are
all
those
veins
and
things
curious
the
way
its
made
2
the
same
*NL*
in
case
of
twins
theyre
supposed
to
represent
beauty
placed
up
there
*NL*
like
those
statues
in
the
museum
one
of
them
pretending
to
hide
it
with
*NL*
her
hand
are
they
so
beautiful
of
course
compared
with
what
a
man
looks
*NL*
like
with
his
two
bags
full
and
his
other
thing
hanging
down
out
of
*NL*
him
or
sticking
up
at
you
like
a
hatrack
no
wonder
they
hide
it
with
a
*NL*
cabbageleaf
that
disgusting
Cameron
highlander
behind
the
meat
market
or
*NL*
that
other
wretch
with
the
red
head
behind
the
tree
where
the
statue
*NL*
of
the
fish
used
to
be
when
I
was
passing
pretending
he
was
pissing
*NL*
standing
out
for
me
to
see
it
with
his
babyclothes
up
to
one
side
the
*NL*
Queens
own
they
were
a
nice
lot
its
well
the
Surreys
relieved
them
*NL*
theyre
always
trying
to
show
it
to
you
every
time
nearly
I
passed
*NL*
outside
the
mens
greenhouse
near
the
Harcourt
street
station
just
to
*NL*
try
some
fellow
or
other
trying
to
catch
my
eye
as
if
it
was
I
of
the
*NL*
7
wonders
of
the
world
O
and
the
stink
of
those
rotten
places
the
night
*NL*
coming
home
with
Poldy
after
the
Comerfords
party
oranges
and
lemonade
*NL*
to
make
you
feel
nice
and
watery
I
went
into
r
of
them
it
was
so
biting
*NL*
cold
I
couldnt
keep
it
when
was
that
93
the
canal
was
frozen
yes
it
was
*NL*
a
few
months
after
a
pity
a
couple
of
the
Camerons
werent
there
to
see
*NL*
me
squatting
in
the
mens
place
meadero
I
tried
to
draw
a
picture
of
*NL*
it
before
I
tore
it
up
like
a
sausage
or
something
I
wonder
theyre
not
*NL*
afraid
going
about
of
getting
a
kick
or
a
bang
of
something
there
the
*NL*
woman
is
beauty
of
course
thats
admitted
when
he
said
I
could
pose
for
a
*NL*
picture
naked
to
some
rich
fellow
in
Holles
street
when
he
lost
the
*NL*
job
in
Helys
and
I
was
selling
the
clothes
and
strumming
in
the
coffee
*NL*
palace
would
I
be
like
that
bath
of
the
nymph
with
my
hair
down
yes
only
*NL*
shes
younger
or
Im
a
little
like
that
dirty
bitch
in
that
Spanish
photo
*NL*
he
has
nymphs
used
they
go
about
like
that
I
asked
him
about
her
and
*NL*
that
word
met
something
with
hoses
in
it
and
he
came
out
with
some
*NL*
jawbreakers
about
the
incarnation
he
never
can
explain
a
thing
simply
*NL*
the
way
a
body
can
understand
then
he
goes
and
burns
the
bottom
out
of
*NL*
the
pan
all
for
his
Kidney
this
one
not
so
much
theres
the
mark
of
his
*NL*
teeth
still
where
he
tried
to
bite
the
nipple
I
had
to
scream
out
arent
*NL*
they
fearful
trying
to
hurt
you
I
had
a
great
breast
of
milk
with
Milly
*NL*
enough
for
two
what
was
the
reason
of
that
he
said
I
could
have
got
a
*NL*
pound
a
week
as
a
wet
nurse
all
swelled
out
the
morning
that
delicate
*NL*
looking
student
that
stopped
in
no
28
with
the
Citrons
Penrose
nearly
*NL*
caught
me
washing
through
the
window
only
for
I
snapped
up
the
towel
to
*NL*
my
face
that
was
his
studenting
hurt
me
they
used
to
weaning
her
till
he
*NL*
got
doctor
Brady
to
give
me
the
belladonna
prescription
I
had
to
get
him
*NL*
to
suck
them
they
were
so
hard
he
said
it
was
sweeter
and
thicker
than
*NL*
cows
then
he
wanted
to
milk
me
into
the
tea
well
hes
beyond
everything
I
*NL*
declare
somebody
ought
to
put
him
in
the
budget
if
I
only
could
remember
*NL*
the
I
half
of
the
things
and
write
a
book
out
of
it
the
works
of
Master
*NL*
Poldy
yes
and
its
so
much
smoother
the
skin
much
an
hour
he
was
at
them
*NL*
Im
sure
by
the
clock
like
some
kind
of
a
big
infant
I
had
at
me
they
*NL*
want
everything
in
their
mouth
all
the
pleasure
those
men
get
out
of
a
*NL*
woman
I
can
feel
his
mouth
O
Lord
I
must
stretch
myself
I
wished
he
was
*NL*
here
or
somebody
to
let
myself
go
with
and
come
again
like
that
I
feel
*NL*
all
fire
inside
me
or
if
I
could
dream
it
when
he
made
me
spend
the
2nd
*NL*
time
tickling
me
behind
with
his
finger
I
was
coming
for
about
5
minutes
*NL*
with
my
legs
round
him
I
had
to
hug
him
after
O
Lord
I
wanted
to
shout
*NL*
out
all
sorts
of
things
fuck
or
shit
or
anything
at
all
only
not
to
look
*NL*
ugly
or
those
lines
from
the
strain
who
knows
the
way
hed
take
it
you
*NL*
want
to
feel
your
way
with
a
man
theyre
not
all
like
him
thank
God
some
*NL*
of
them
want
you
to
be
so
nice
about
it
I
noticed
the
contrast
he
does
*NL*
it
and
doesnt
talk
I
gave
my
eyes
that
look
with
my
hair
a
bit
loose
*NL*
from
the
tumbling
and
my
tongue
between
my
lips
up
to
him
the
savage
*NL*
brute

in
them
like
big
giants
and
the
water
rolling
all
over
and
out
of
*NL*
them

the
poor

*NL*
that

from
their
wives

*NL*
roasting
engines
stifling
it

today

half
of
*NL*
those
old
Freemans
and
Photo
Bits
leaving
things

up
in
the
W

Januarys
paper
and
all
those
old
overcoats
I
bundled
out
of
the
hall
*NL*
making
the
place
hotter
than
it
is
that
rain
was
lovely
and
refreshing
*NL*
just
after
my
beauty
sleep
I
thought
it
was
going
to
get
like
Gibraltar
*NL*
my
goodness
the
heat
there
before
the
levanter
came
on
black
as
night
*NL*
and
the
glare
of
the
rock
standing
up
in
it
like
a
big
giant
compared
*NL*
with
their
3
Rock
mountain
they
think
is
so
great
with
the
red
sentries
*NL*
here
and
there
the
poplars
and
they
all
whitehot
and
the
smell
of
the
*NL*
rainwater
in
those
tanks
watching
the
sun
all
the
time
weltering
down
on
*NL*
you
faded
all
that
lovely
frock
fathers
friend

of
those
exercises
he

of

the
least
thing

affly
Hester
x
*NL*
x
x
x
x
she
didnt
look
a
bit
married
just
like
a
girl
he
was
years
older
*NL*
than
her
wogger
he
was
awfully
fond
of
me
when
he
held
down
the
wire
*NL*
with
his
foot
for
me
to
step
over
at
the
bullfight
at
La
Linea
when
*NL*
that
matador
Gomez
was
given
the
bulls
ear
these
clothes
we
have
to
wear
*NL*
whoever
invented
them
expecting
you
to
walk
up
Killiney
hill
then
for
*NL*
example
at
that
picnic
all
staysed
up
you
cant
do
a
blessed
thing
in
*NL*
them
in
a
crowd
run
or
jump
out
of
the
way
thats
why
I
was
afraid
when
*NL*
that
other
ferocious
old
Bull
began
to
charge
the
banderilleros
with
*NL*
the
sashes
and
the
2
things
in
their
hats
and
the
brutes
of
men
shouting
*NL*
bravo
toro
sure
the
women
were
as
bad
in
their
nice
white
mantillas
*NL*
ripping
all
the
whole
insides
out
of
those
poor
horses
I
never
heard
of
*NL*
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
yes
he
used
to
break
his
heart
at
me
taking
*NL*
off
the
dog
barking
in
bell
lane
poor
brute
and
it
sick
what
became
*NL*
of
them
ever
I
suppose
theyre
dead
long
ago
the
2
of
them
its
like
all
*NL*
through
a
mist
makes
you
feel
so
old
I
made
the
scones
of
course
I
had
*NL*
everything
all
to
myself
then
a
girl
Hester
we
used
to
compare
our
hair
*NL*
mine
was
thicker
than
hers
she
showed
me
how
to
settle
it
at
the
back
*NL*
when
I
put
it
up
and
whats
this
else
how
to
make
a
knot
on
a
thread
with
*NL*
the
one
hand
we
were
like
cousins
what
age
was
I
then
the
night
of
the
*NL*
storm
I
slept
in
her
bed
she
had
her
arms
round
me
then
we
were
fighting
*NL*
in
the
morning
with
the
pillow
what
fun
he
was
watching
me
whenever
he
*NL*
got
an
opportunity
at
the
band
on
the
Alameda
esplanade
when
I
was
with
*NL*
father
and
captain
Grove
I
looked
up
at
the
church
first
and
then
at
the
*NL*
windows
then
down
and
our
eyes
met
I
felt
something
go
through
me
like
*NL*
all
needles
my
eyes
were
dancing
I
remember
after
when
I
looked
*NL*
at
myself
in
the
glass
hardly
recognised
myself
the
change
he
was
*NL*
attractive
to
a
girl
in
spite
of
his
being
a
little
bald
intelligent
*NL*
looking
disappointed
and
gay
at
the
same
time
he
was
like
Thomas
in
*NL*
the
shadow
of
Ashlydyat
I
had
a
splendid
skin
from
the
sun
and
the
*NL*
excitement
like
a
rose
I
didnt
get
a
wink
of
sleep
it
wouldnt
have
been
*NL*
nice
on
account
of
her
but
I
could
have
stopped
it
in
time
she
gave
me
*NL*
the
Moonstone
to
read
that
was
the
first
I
read
of
Wilkie
Collins
East
*NL*
Lynne
I
read
and
the
shadow
of
Ashlydyat
Mrs
Henry
Wood
Henry
Dunbar
by
*NL*
that
other
woman
I
lent
him
afterwards
with
Mulveys
photo
in
it
so
as
he
*NL*
see
I
wasnt
without
and
Lord
Lytton
Eugene
Aram
Molly
bawn
she
gave
me
*NL*
by
Mrs
Hungerford
on
account
of
the
name
I
dont
like
books
with
a
Molly
*NL*
in
them
like
that
one
he
brought
me
about
the
one
from
Flanders
a
whore
*NL*
always
shoplifting
anything
she
could
cloth
and
stuff
and
yards
of
it
*NL*
O
this
blanket
is
too
heavy
on
me
thats
better
I
havent
even
one
decent
*NL*
nightdress
this
thing
gets
all
rolled
under
me
besides
him
and
his
*NL*
fooling
thats
better
I
used
to
be
weltering
then
in
the
heat
my
shift
*NL*
drenched
with
the
sweat
stuck
in
the
cheeks
of
my
bottom
on
the
chair
*NL*
when
I
stood
up
they
were
so
fattish
and
firm
when
I
got
up
on
the
sofa
*NL*
cushions
to
see
with
my
clothes
up
and
the
bugs
tons
of
them
at
night
*NL*
and
the
mosquito
nets
I
couldnt
read
a
line
Lord
how
long
ago
it
seems
*NL*
centuries
of
course
they
never
came
back
and
she
didnt
put
her
address
*NL*
right
on
it
either
she
may
have
noticed
her
wogger
people
were
always
*NL*
going
away
and
we
never
I
remember
that
day
with
the
waves
and
the
*NL*
boats
with
their
high
heads
rocking
and
the
smell
of
ship
those
Officers
*NL*
uniforms
on
shore
leave
made
me
seasick
he
didnt
say
anything
he
was
*NL*
very
serious
I
had
the
high
buttoned
boots
on
and
my
skirt
was
blowing
*NL*
she
kissed
me
six
or
seven
times
didnt
I
cry
yes
I
believe
I
did
or
near
*NL*
it
my
lips
were
taittering
when
I
said
goodbye
she
had
a
Gorgeous
wrap
*NL*
of
some
special
kind
of
blue
colour
on
her
for
the
voyage
made
very
*NL*
peculiarly
to
one
side
like
and
it
was
extremely
pretty
it
got
as
dull
*NL*
as
the
devil
after
they
went
I
was
almost
planning
to
run
away
mad
out
*NL*
of
it
somewhere
were
never
easy
where
we
are
father
or
aunt
or
marriage
*NL*
waiting
always
waiting
to
guiiiide
him
toooo
me
waiting
nor
speeeed
*NL*
his
flying
feet
their
damn
guns
bursting
and
booming
all
over
the
shop
*NL*
especially
the
Queens
birthday
and
throwing
everything
down
in
all
*NL*
directions
if
you
didnt
open
the
windows
when
general
Ulysses
Grant
*NL*
whoever
he
was
or
did
supposed
to
be
some
great
fellow
landed
off
the
*NL*
ship
and
old
Sprague
the
consul
that
was
there
from
before
the
flood
*NL*
dressed
up
poor
man
and
he
in
mourning
for
the
son
then
the
same
old
*NL*
bugles
for
reveille
in
the
morning
and
drums
rolling
and
the
unfortunate
*NL*
poor
devils
of
soldiers
walking
about
with
messtins
smelling
the
place
*NL*
more
than
the
old
longbearded
jews
in
their
jellibees
and
levites
*NL*
assembly
and
sound
clear
and
gunfire
for
the
men
to
cross
the
lines
and
*NL*
the
warden
marching
with
his
keys
to
lock
the
gates
and
the
bagpipes
and
*NL*
only
captain
Groves
and
father
talking
about
Rorkes
drift
and
Plevna
and
*NL*
sir
Garnet
Wolseley
and
Gordon
at
Khartoum
lighting
their
pipes
for
*NL*
them
everytime
they
went
out
drunken
old
devil
with
his
grog
on
the
*NL*
windowsill
catch
him
leaving
any
of
it
picking
his
nose
trying
to
think
*NL*
of
some
other
dirty
story
to
tell
up
in
a
corner
but
he
never
forgot
*NL*
himself
when
I
was
there
sending
me
out
of
the
room
on
some
blind
excuse
*NL*
paying
his
compliments
the
Bushmills
whisky
talking
of
course
but
hed
*NL*
do
the
same
to
the
next
woman
that
came
along
I
suppose
he
died
of
*NL*
galloping
drink
ages
ago
the
days
like
years
not
a
letter
from
a
living
*NL*
soul
except
the
odd
few
I
posted
to
myself
with
bits
of
paper
in
them
so
*NL*
bored
sometimes
I
could
fight
with
my
nails
listening
to
that
old
Arab
*NL*
with
the
one
eye
and
his
heass
of
an
instrument
singing
his
heah
heah
*NL*
aheah
all
my
compriments
on
your
hotchapotch
of
your
heass
as
bad
as
now
*NL*
with
the
hands
hanging
off
me
looking
out
of
the
window
if
there
was
a
*NL*
nice
fellow
even
in
the
opposite
house
that
medical
in
Holles
street
the
*NL*
nurse
was
after
when
I
put
on
my
gloves
and
hat
at
the
window
to
show
*NL*
I
was
going
out
not
a
notion
what
I
meant
arent
they
thick
never
*NL*
understand
what
you
say
even
youd
want
to
print
it
up
on
a
big
poster
*NL*
for
them
not
even
if
you
shake
hands
twice
with
the
left
he
didnt
*NL*
recognise
me
either
when
I
half
frowned
at
him
outside
Westland
row
*NL*
chapel
where
does
their
great
intelligence
come
in
Id
like
to
know
*NL*
grey
matter
they
have
it
all
in
their
tail
if
you
ask
me
those
country
*NL*
gougers
up
in
the
City
Arms
intelligence
they
had
a
damn
sight
less
than
*NL*
the
bulls
and
cows
they
were
selling
the
meat
and
the
coalmans
bell
that
*NL*
noisy
bugger
trying
to
swindle
me
with
the
wrong
bill
he
took
out
of
his
*NL*
hat
what
a
pair
of
paws
and
pots
and
pans
and
kettles
to
mend
any
broken
*NL*
bottles
for
a
poor
man
today
and
no
visitors
or
post
ever
except
his
*NL*
cheques
or
some
advertisement
like
that
wonderworker
they
sent
him
*NL*
addressed
dear
Madam
only
his
letter
and
the
card
from
Milly
this
*NL*
morning

madrileno
Floey
Dillon
since

to
say

married
to
a
very
rich
architect
if
Im
to
*NL*
believe
all
I
hear
with
a
villa
and
eight
rooms
her
father

an
*NL*
awfully
nice
man

near
seventy

solid
silver
*NL*

mahogany
sideboard

far
*NL*
away
I
hate
people
that
have
always
their
poor
story
to
tell
everybody
*NL*
has
their
own
troubles
that
poor
Nancy
Blake
died
a
month
ago
of
acute
*NL*
neumonia
well
I
didnt
know
her
so
well
as
all
that
she
was
Floeys
friend
*NL*
more
than
mine
poor
Nancy
its
a
bother
having
to
answer
he
always
tells
*NL*
me
the
wrong
things
and
no
stops
to
say
like
making
a
speech
your
sad
*NL*
bereavement

always
make
that
mistake
and
newphew
with

*NL*
double
yous

longer
letter

O

some
heart
up
into
me
youve
no
*NL*
chances

this
place
like

write
*NL*

Hugh

old
Madrid
stuff

truth

it
true

up
your
whole
day
and
life
*NL*
always
something
to
think
about
every
moment
and
see
it
all
round
you
*NL*
like
a
new
world
I
could
write
the
answer
in
bed
to
let
him
imagine
me
*NL*
short
just
a
few
words
not
those
long
crossed
letters
Atty
Dillon
used
*NL*
to
write
to
the
fellow
that
was
something
in
the
four
courts
that
jilted
*NL*
her
after
out
of
the
ladies
letterwriter
when
I
told
her
to
say
a
few
*NL*
simple
words
he
could
twist
how
he
liked
not
acting
with
precipat
precip
*NL*
itancy
with
equal
candour
the
greatest
earthly
happiness
answer
to
a
*NL*
gentlemans
proposal
affirmatively
my
goodness
theres
nothing
else
its
*NL*
all
very
fine
for
them
but
as
for
being
a
woman
as
soon
as
youre
old
*NL*
they
might
as
well
throw
you
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
ashpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mulveys
was
the
first
when
I
was
in
bed
that
morning
and
Mrs
Rubio
*NL*
brought
it
in
with
the
coffee
she
stood
there
standing
when
I
asked
her
*NL*
to
hand
me
and
I
pointing
at
them
I
couldnt
think
of
the
word
a
hairpin
*NL*
to
open
it
with
ah
horquilla
disobliging
old
thing
and
it
staring
her
*NL*
in
the
face
with
her
switch
of
false
hair
on
her
and
vain
about
her
*NL*
appearance
ugly
as
she
was
near
80
or
a
loo
her
face
a
mass
of
wrinkles
*NL*
with
all
her
religion
domineering
because
she
never
could
get
over
the
*NL*
Atlantic
fleet
coming
in
half
the
ships
of
the
world
and
the
Union
Jack
*NL*
flying
with
all
her
carabineros
because
4
drunken
English
sailors
took
*NL*
all
the
rock
from
them
and
because
I
didnt
run
into
mass
often
enough
in
*NL*
Santa
Maria
to
please
her
with
her
shawl
up
on
her
except
when
there
was
*NL*
a
marriage
on
with
all
her
miracles
of
the
saints
and
her
black
blessed
*NL*
virgin
with
the
silver
dress
and
the
sun
dancing
3
times
on
Easter
*NL*
Sunday
morning
and
when
the
priest
was
going
by
with
the
bell
bringing
*NL*
the
vatican
to
the
dying
blessing
herself
for
his
Majestad
an
admirer
*NL*
he
signed
it
I
near
jumped
out
of
my
skin
I
wanted
to
pick
him
up
when
*NL*
I
saw
him
following
me
along
the
Calle
Real
in
the
shop
window
then
*NL*
he
tipped
me
just
in
passing
but
I
never
thought
hed
write
making
an
*NL*
appointment
I
had
it
inside
my
petticoat
bodice
all
day
reading
it
up
*NL*
in
every
hole
and
corner
while
father
was
up
at
the
drill
instructing
to
*NL*
find
out
by
the
handwriting
or
the
language
of
stamps
singing
I
remember
*NL*
shall
I
wear
a
white
rose
and
I
wanted
to
put
on
the
old
stupid
clock
to
*NL*
near
the
time
he
was
the
first
man
kissed
me
under
the
Moorish
wall
my
*NL*
sweetheart
when
a
boy
it
never
entered
my
head
what
kissing
meant
till
*NL*
he
put
his
tongue
in
my
mouth
his
mouth
was
sweetlike
young
I
put
my
*NL*
knee
up
to
him
a
few
times
to
learn
the
way
what
did
I
tell
him
I
was
*NL*
engaged
for
for
fun
to
the
son
of
a
Spanish
nobleman
named
Don
Miguel
de
*NL*
la
Flora
and
he
believed
me
that
I
was
to
be
married
to
him
in
3
years
*NL*
time
theres
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
there
is
a
flower
that
*NL*
bloometh
a
few
things
I
told
him
true
about
myself
just
for
him
to
be
*NL*
imagining
the
Spanish
girls
he
didnt
like
I
suppose
one
of
them
wouldnt
*NL*
have
him
I
got
him
excited
he
crushed
all
the
flowers
on
my
bosom
he
*NL*
brought
me
he
couldnt
count
the
pesetas
and
the
perragordas
till
I
*NL*
taught
him
Cappoquin
he
came
from
he
said
on
the
black
water
but
it
was
*NL*
too
short
then
the
day
before
he
left
May
yes
it
was
May
when
the
infant
*NL*
king
of
Spain
was
born
Im
always
like
that
in
the
spring
Id
like
a
new
*NL*
fellow
every
year
up
on
the
tiptop
under
the
rockgun
near
OHaras
tower
*NL*
I
told
him
it
was
struck
by
lightning
and
all
about
the
old
Barbary
apes
*NL*
they
sent
to
Clapham
without
a
tail
careering
all
over
the
show
on
each
*NL*
others
back
Mrs
Rubio
said
she
was
a
regular
old
rock
scorpion
robbing
*NL*
the
chickens
out
of
Inces
farm
and
throw
stones
at
you
if
you
went
anear
*NL*
he
was
looking
at
me
I
had
that
white
blouse
on
open
in
the
front
to
*NL*
encourage
him
as
much
as
I
could
without
too
openly
they
were
just
*NL*
beginning
to
be
plump
I
said
I
was
tired
we
lay
over
the
firtree
cove
*NL*
a
wild
place
I
suppose
it
must
be
the
highest
rock
in
existence
the
*NL*
galleries
and
casemates
and
those
frightful
rocks
and
Saint
Michaels
*NL*
cave
with
the
icicles
or
whatever
they
call
them
hanging
down
and
*NL*
ladders
all
the
mud
plotching
my
boots
Im
sure
thats
the
way
down
the
*NL*
monkeys
go
under
the
sea
to
Africa
when
they
die
the
ships
out
far
like
*NL*
chips
that
was
the
Malta
boat
passing
yes
the
sea
and
the
sky
you
could
*NL*
do
what
you
liked
lie
there
for
ever
he
caressed
them
outside
they
love
*NL*
doing
that
its
the
roundness
there
I
was
leaning
over
him
with
my
white
*NL*
ricestraw
hat
to
take
the
newness
out
of
it
the
left
side
of
my
face
the
*NL*
best
my
blouse
open
for
his
last
day
transparent
kind
of
shirt
he
had
I
*NL*
could
see
his
chest
pink
he
wanted
to
touch
mine
with
his
for
a
moment
*NL*
but
I
wouldnt
lee
him
he
was
awfully
put
out
first
for
fear
you
never
*NL*
know
consumption
or
leave
me
with
a
child
embarazada
that
old
servant
*NL*
Ines
told
me
that
one
drop
even
if
it
got
into
you
at
all
after
I
tried
*NL*
with
the
Banana
but
I
was
afraid
it
might
break
and
get
lost
up
in
me
*NL*
somewhere
because
they
once
took
something
down
out
of
a
woman
that
was
*NL*
up
there
for
years
covered
with
limesalts
theyre
all
mad
to
get
in
there
*NL*
where
they
come
out
of
youd
think
they
could
never
go
far
enough
up
and
*NL*
then
theyre
done
with
you
in
a
way
till
the
next
time
yes
because
theres
*NL*
a
wonderful
feeling
there
so
tender
all
the
time
how
did
we
finish
it
*NL*
off
yes
O
yes
I
pulled
him
off
into
my
handkerchief
pretending
not
to
*NL*
be
excited
but
I
opened
my
legs
I
wouldnt
let
him
touch
me
inside
my
*NL*
petticoat
because
I
had
a
skirt
opening
up
the
side
I
tormented
the
*NL*
life
out
of
him
first
tickling
him
I
loved
rousing
that
dog
in
the
hotel
*NL*
rrrsssstt
awokwokawok
his
eyes
shut
and
a
bird
flying
below
us
he
was
*NL*
shy
all
the
same
I
liked
him
like
that
moaning
I
made
him
blush
a
little
*NL*
when
I
got
over
him
that
way
when
I
unbuttoned
him
and
took
his
out
and
*NL*
drew
back
the
skin
it
had
a
kind
of
eye
in
it
theyre
all
Buttons
men
*NL*
down
the
middle
on
the
wrong
side
of
them
Molly
darling
he
called
me
*NL*
what
was
his
name
Jack
Joe
Harry
Mulvey
was
it
yes
I
think
a
lieutenant
*NL*
he
was
rather
fair
he
had
a
laughing
kind
of
a
voice
so
I
went
round
to
*NL*
the
whatyoucallit
everything
was
whatyoucallit
moustache
had
he
he
said
*NL*
hed
come
back
Lord
its
just
like
yesterday
to
me
and
if
I
was
married
*NL*
hed
do
it
to
me
and
I
promised
him
yes
faithfully
Id
let
him
block
me
*NL*
now
flying
perhaps
hes
dead
or
killed
or
a
captain
or
admiral
its
nearly
*NL*
20
years
if
I
said
firtree
cove
he
would
if
he
came
up
behind
me
and
*NL*
put
his
hands
over
my
eyes
to
guess
who
I
might
recognise
him
hes
young
*NL*
still
about
40
perhaps
hes
married
some
girl
on
the
black
water
and
is
*NL*
quite
changed
they
all
do
they
havent
half
the
character
a
woman
has
she
*NL*
little
knows
what
I
did
with
her
beloved
husband
before
he
ever
dreamt
*NL*
of
her
in
broad
daylight
too
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
world
you
might
*NL*
say
they
could
have
put
an
article
about
it
in
the
Chronicle
I
was
a
bit
*NL*
wild
after
when
I
blew
out
the
old
bag
the
biscuits
were
in
from
Benady
*NL*
Bros
and
exploded
it
Lord
what
a
bang
all
the
woodcocks
and
pigeons
*NL*
screaming
coming
back
the
same
way
that
we
went
over
middle
hill
round
*NL*
by
the
old
guardhouse
and
the
jews
burialplace
pretending
to
read
out
*NL*
the
Hebrew
on
them
I
wanted
to
fire
his
pistol
he
said
he
hadnt
one
he
*NL*
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
me
with
his
peak
cap
on
that
he
always
wore
*NL*
crooked
as
often
as
I
settled
it
straight
H
M
S
Calypso
swinging
my
hat
*NL*
that
old
Bishop
that
spoke
off
the
altar
his
long
preach
about
womans
*NL*
higher
functions
about
girls
now
riding
the
bicycle
and
wearing
peak
*NL*
caps
and
the
new
woman
bloomers
God
send
him
sense
and
me
more
money
I
*NL*
suppose
theyre
called
after
him
I
never
thought
that
would
be
my
*NL*
name
Bloom
when
I
used
to
write
it
in
print
to
see
how
it
looked
on
a
*NL*
visiting
card
or
practising
for
the
butcher
and
oblige
M
Bloom
youre
*NL*
looking
blooming
Josie
used
to
say
after
I
married
him
well
its
better
*NL*
than
Breen
or
Briggs
does
brig
or
those
awful
names
with
bottom
in
them
*NL*
Mrs
Ramsbottom
or
some
other
kind
of
a
bottom
Mulvey
I
wouldnt
go
mad
*NL*
about
either
or
suppose
I
divorced
him
Mrs
Boylan
my
mother
whoever
she
*NL*
was
might
have
given
me
a
nicer
name
the
Lord
knows
after
the
lovely
*NL*
one
she
had
Lunita
Laredo
the
fun
we
had
running
along
Williss
road
to
*NL*
Europa
point
twisting
in
and
out
all
round
the
other
side
of
Jersey
they
*NL*
were
shaking
and
dancing
about
in
my
blouse
like
Millys
little
ones
now
*NL*
when
she
runs
up
the
stairs
I
loved
looking
down
at
them
I
was
jumping
*NL*
up
at
the
pepper
trees
and
the
white
poplars
pulling
the
leaves
off
and
*NL*
throwing
them
at
him
he
went
to
India
he
was
to
write
the
voyages
those
*NL*
men
have
to
make
to
the
ends
of
the
world
and
back
its
the
least
they
*NL*
might
get
a
squeeze
or
two
at
a
woman
while
they
can
going
out
to
be
*NL*
drowned
or
blown
up
somewhere
I
went
up
Windmill
hill
to
the
flats
*NL*
that
Sunday
morning
with
captain
Rubios
that
was
dead
spyglass
like
the
*NL*
sentry
had
he
said
hed
have
one
or
two
from
on
board
I
wore
that
frock
*NL*
from
the
B
Marche
paris
and
the
coral
necklace
the
straits
shining
I
*NL*
could
see
over
to
Morocco
almost
the
bay
of
Tangier
white
and
the
Atlas
*NL*
mountain
with
snow
on
it
and
the
straits
like
a
river
so
clear
Harry
*NL*
Molly
darling
I
was
thinking
of
him
on
the
sea
all
the
time
after
at
*NL*
mass
when
my
petticoat
began
to
slip
down
at
the
elevation
weeks
and
*NL*
weeks
I
kept
the
handkerchief
under
my
pillow
for
the
smell
of
him
there
*NL*
was
no
decent
perfume
to
be
got
in
that
Gibraltar
only
that
cheap
peau
*NL*
dEspagne
that
faded
and
left
a
stink
on
you
more
than
anything
else
I
*NL*
wanted
to
give
him
a
memento
he
gave
me
that
clumsy
Claddagh
ring
for
*NL*
luck
that
I
gave
Gardner
going
to
south
Africa
where
those
Boers
killed
*NL*
him
with
their
war
and
fever
but
they
were
well
beaten
all
the
same
as
*NL*
if
it
brought
its
bad
luck
with
it
like
an
opal
or
pearl
still
it
must
*NL*
have
been
pure
18
carrot
gold
because
it
was
very
heavy
but
what
could
*NL*
you
get
in
a
place
like
that
the
sandfrog
shower
from
Africa
and
that
*NL*
derelict
ship
that
came
up
to
the
harbour
Marie

some
wind
in
me

him
have
*NL*
him
at
it
again
slobbering
after
washing
every
bit
of
myself
back
belly
*NL*
and
sides
if

even
a
bath

or

to

a
bit
on
my
side
piano
quietly
sweeeee

more
song
*NL*
*NL*
that
was
a
relief
wherever
you
be
let
your
wind
go
free
who
knows
if
*NL*
that
pork
chop
I
took
with
my
cup
of
tea
after
was
quite
good
with
the
*NL*
heat
I
couldnt
smell
anything
off
it
Im
sure
that
queerlooking
man
in
*NL*
the
porkbutchers
is
a
great
rogue
I
hope
that
lamp
is
not
smoking
fill
*NL*
my
nose
up
with
smuts
better
than
having
him
leaving
the
gas
on
all
*NL*
night
I
couldnt
rest
easy
in
my
bed
in
Gibraltar
even
getting
up
to
see
*NL*
why
am
I
so
damned
nervous
about
that
though
I
like
it
in
the
winter
its
*NL*
more
company
O
Lord
it
was
rotten
cold
too
that
winter
when
I
was
*NL*
only
about
ten
was
I
yes
I
had
the
big
doll
with
all
the
funny
clothes
*NL*
dressing
her
up
and
undressing
that
icy
wind
skeeting
across
from
those
*NL*
mountains
the
something
Nevada
sierra
nevada
standing
at
the
fire
with
*NL*
the
little
bit
of
a
short
shift
I
had
up
to
heat
myself
I
loved
dancing
*NL*
about
in
it
then
make
a
race
back
into
bed
Im
sure
that
fellow
opposite
*NL*
used
to
be
there
the
whole
time
watching
with
the
lights
out
in
the
*NL*
summer
and
I
in
my
skin
hopping
around
I
used
to
love
myself
then
*NL*
stripped
at
the
washstand
dabbing
and
creaming
only
when
it
came
to
the
*NL*
chamber
performance
I
put
out
the
light
too
so
then
there
were
2
of
us
*NL*
goodbye
to
my
sleep
for
this
night
anyhow
I
hope
hes
not
going
to
get
in
*NL*
with
those
medicals
leading
him
astray
to
imagine
hes
young
again
coming
*NL*
in
at
4
in
the
morning
it
must
be
if
not
more
still
he
had
the
manners
*NL*
not
to
wake
me
what
do
they
find
to
gabber
about
all
night
squandering
*NL*
money
and
getting
drunker
and
drunker
couldnt
they
drink
water
then
he
*NL*
starts
giving
us
his
orders
for
eggs
and
tea
and
Findon
haddy
and
hot
*NL*
buttered
toast
I
suppose
well
have
him
sitting
up
like
the
king
of
*NL*
the
country
pumping
the
wrong
end
of
the
spoon
up
and
down
in
his
egg
*NL*
wherever
he
learned
that
from
and
I
love
to
hear
him
falling
up
the
*NL*
stairs
of
a
morning
with
the
cups
rattling
on
the
tray
and
then
play
*NL*
with
the
cat
she
rubs
up
against
you
for
her
own
sake
I
wonder
has
she
*NL*
fleas
shes
as
bad
as
a
woman
always
licking
and
lecking
but
I
hate
their
*NL*
claws
I
wonder
do
they
see
anything
that
we
cant
staring
like
that
when
*NL*
she
sits
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
so
long
and
listening
as
I
wait
always
*NL*
what
a
robber
too
that
lovely
fresh
place
I
bought
I
think
Ill
get
a
bit
*NL*
of
fish
tomorrow
or
today
is
it
Friday
yes
I
will
with
some
blancmange
*NL*
with
black
currant
jam
like
long
ago

2
lb
pots
of
mixed
plum
*NL*
and
apple
from
the
London
and
Newcastle
Williams
and
Woods
goes
twice
as
*NL*
far
only
for
the
bones
I
hate
those
eels
cod
yes
Ill
get
a
nice
piece
*NL*
of
cod
Im
always
getting
enough
for
3
forgetting
anyway
Im
sick
of
that
*NL*
everlasting
butchers
meat
from
Buckleys
loin
chops
and
leg
beef
and
rib
*NL*
steak
and
scrag
of
mutton
and
calfs
pluck
the
very
name
is
enough
or
*NL*
a
picnic
suppose
we
all
gave
5
/
-
each
and
or
let
him
pay
it
and
invite
*NL*
some
other
woman
for
him
who
Mrs
Fleming
and
drove
out
to
the
furry
glen
*NL*
or
the
strawberry
beds
wed
have
him
examining
all
the
horses
toenails
*NL*
first
like
he
does
with
the
letters
no
not
with
Boylan
there
yes
with
*NL*
some
cold
veal
and
ham
mixed
sandwiches
there
are
little
houses
down
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
the
banks
there
on
purpose
but
its
as
hot
as
blazes
he
*NL*
says
not
a
bank
holiday
anyhow
I
hate
those
ruck
of
Mary
Ann
coalboxes
*NL*
out
for
the
day
Whit
Monday
is
a
cursed
day
too
no
wonder
that
bee
bit
*NL*
him
better
the
seaside
but
Id
never
again
in
this
life
get
into
a
boat
*NL*
with
him
after
him
at
Bray
telling
the
boatman
he
knew
how
to
row
if
*NL*
anyone
asked
could
he
ride
the
steeplechase
for
the
gold
cup
hed
say
*NL*
yes
then
it
came
on
to
get
rough
the
old
thing
crookeding
about
and
the
*NL*
weight
all
down
my
side
telling
me
pull
the
right
reins
now
pull
the
*NL*
left
and
the
tide
all
swamping
in
floods
in
through
the
bottom
and
his
*NL*
oar
slipping
out
of
the
stirrup
its
a
mercy
we
werent
all
drowned
he
can
*NL*
swim
of
course
me
no
theres
no
danger
whatsoever
keep
yourself
calm
in
*NL*
his
flannel
trousers
Id
like
to
have
tattered
them
down
off
him
before
*NL*
all
the
people
and
give
him
what
that
one
calls
flagellate
till
he
was
*NL*
black
and
blue
do
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
only
for
that
longnosed
*NL*
chap
I
dont
know
who
he
is
with
that
other
beauty
Burke
out
of
the
City
*NL*
Arms
hotel
was
there
spying
around
as
usual
on
the
slip
always
where
he
*NL*
wasnt
wanted
if
there
was
a
row
on
youd
vomit
a
better
face
there
was
no
*NL*
love
lost
between
us
thats
1
consolation
I
wonder
what
kind
is
that
book
*NL*
he
brought
me
Sweets
of
Sin
by
a
gentleman
of
fashion
some
other
Mr
de
*NL*
Kock
I
suppose
the
people
gave
him
that
nickname
going
about
with
his
*NL*
tube
from
one
woman
to
another
I
couldnt
even
change
my
new
white
shoes
*NL*
all
ruined
with
the
saltwater
and
the
hat
I
had
with
that
feather
all
*NL*
blowy
and
tossed
on
me
how
annoying
and
provoking
because
the
smell
of
*NL*
the
sea
excited
me
of
course
the
sardines
and
the
bream
in
Catalan
bay
*NL*
round
the
back
of
the
rock
they
were
fine
all
silver
in
the
fishermens
*NL*
baskets
old
Luigi
near
a
hundred
they
said
came
from
Genoa
and
the
tall
*NL*
old
chap
with
the
earrings
I
dont
like
a
man
you
have
to
climb
up
to
to
*NL*
get
at
I
suppose
theyre
all
dead
and
rotten
long
ago
besides
I
dont
like
*NL*
being
alone
in
this
big
barracks
of
a
place
at
night
I
suppose
Ill
have
*NL*
to
put
up
with
it
I
never
brought
a
bit
of
salt
in
even
when
we
moved
*NL*
in
the
confusion
musical
academy
he
was
going
to
make
on
the
first
floor
*NL*
drawingroom
with
a
brassplate
or
Blooms
private
hotel
he
suggested
go
*NL*
and
ruin
himself
altogether
the
way
his
father
did
down
in
Ennis
like
*NL*
all
the
things
he
told
father
he
was
going
to
do
and
me
but
I
saw
*NL*
through
him
telling
me
all
the
lovely
places
we
could
go
for
the
*NL*
honeymoon
Venice
by
moonlight
with
the
gondolas
and
the
lake
of
Como
he
*NL*
had
a
picture
cut
out
of
some
paper
of
and
mandolines
and
lanterns
O
*NL*
how
nice
I
said
whatever
I
liked
he
was
going
to
do
immediately
if
*NL*
not
sooner
will
you
be
my
man
will
you
carry
my
can
he
ought
to
get
a
*NL*
leather
medal
with
a
putty
rim
for
all
the
plans
he
invents
then
leaving
*NL*
us
here
all
day
youd
never
know
what
old
beggar
at
the
door
for
a
crust
*NL*
with
his
long
story
might
be
a
tramp
and
put
his
foot
in
the
way
to
*NL*
prevent
me
shutting
it
like
that
picture
of
that
hardened
criminal
he
*NL*
was
called
in
Lloyds
Weekly
news
20
years
in
jail
then
he
comes
out
and
*NL*
murders
an
old
woman
for
her
money
imagine
his
poor
wife
or
mother
or
*NL*
whoever
she
is
such
a
face
youd
run
miles
away
from
I
couldnt
rest
easy
*NL*
till
I
bolted
all
the
doors
and
windows
to
make
sure
but
its
worse
again
*NL*
being
locked
up
like
in
a
prison
or
a
madhouse
they
ought
to
be
all
shot
*NL*
or
the
cat
of
nine
tails
a
big
brute
like
that
that
would
attack
a
poor
*NL*
old
woman
to
murder
her
in
her
bed
Id
cut
them
off
him
so
I
would
not
*NL*
that
hed
be
much
use
still
better
than
nothing
the
night
I
was
sure
*NL*
I
heard
burglars
in
the
kitchen
and
he
went
down
in
his
shirt
with
a
*NL*
candle
and
a
poker
as
if
he
was
looking
for
a
mouse
as
white
as
a
sheet
*NL*
frightened
out
of
his
wits
making
as
much
noise
as
he
possibly
could
*NL*
for
the
burglars
benefit
there
isnt
much
to
steal
indeed
the
Lord
knows
*NL*
still
its
the
feeling
especially
now
with
Milly
away
such
an
idea
for
*NL*
him
to
send
the
girl
down
there
to
learn
to
take
photographs
on
account
*NL*
of
his
grandfather
instead
of
sending
her
to
Skerrys
academy
where
shed
*NL*
have
to
learn
not
like
me
getting
all
IS
at
school
only
hed
do
a
thing
*NL*
like
that
all
the
same
on
account
of
me
and
Boylan
thats
why
he
did
*NL*
it
Im
certain
the
way
he
plots
and
plans
everything
out
I
couldnt
turn
*NL*
round
with
her
in
the
place
lately
unless
I
bolted
the
door
first
gave
*NL*
me
the
fidgets
coming
in
without
knocking
first
when
I
put
the
chair
*NL*
against
the
door
just
as
I
was
washing
myself
there
below
with
the
glove
*NL*
get
on
your
nerves
then
doing
the
loglady
all
day
put
her
in
a
glasscase
*NL*
with
two
at
a
time
to
look
at
her
if
he
knew
she
broke
off
the
hand
off
*NL*
that
little
gimcrack
statue
with
her
roughness
and
carelessness
before
*NL*
she
left
that
I
got
that
little
Italian
boy
to
mend
so
that
you
cant
*NL*
see
the
join
for
2
shillings
wouldnt
even
teem
the
potatoes
for
you
of
*NL*
course
shes
right
not
to
ruin
her
hands
I
noticed
he
was
always
talking
*NL*
to
her
lately
at
the
table
explaining
things
in
the
paper
and
she
*NL*
pretending
to
understand
sly
of
course
that
comes
from
his
side
of
the
*NL*
house
he
cant
say
I
pretend
things
can
he
Im
too
honest
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
and
helping
her
into
her
coat
but
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
*NL*
her
its
me
shed
tell
not
him
I
suppose
he
thinks
Im
finished
out
and
*NL*
laid
on
the
shelf
well
Im
not
no
nor
anything
like
it
well
see
well
see
*NL*
now
shes
well
on
for
flirting
too
with
Tom
Devans
two
sons
imitating
*NL*
me
whistling
with
those
romps
of
Murray
girls
calling
for
her
can
Milly
*NL*
come
out
please
shes
in
great
demand
to
pick
what
they
can
out
of
her
*NL*
round
in
Nelson
street
riding
Harry
Devans
bicycle
at
night
its
as
well
*NL*
he
sent
her
where
she
is
she
was
just
getting
out
of
bounds
wanting
to
*NL*
go
on
the
skatingrink
and
smoking
their
cigarettes
through
their
nose
I
*NL*
smelt
it
off
her
dress
when
I
was
biting
off
the
thread
of
the
button
*NL*
I
sewed
on
to
the
bottom
of
her
jacket
she
couldnt
hide
much
from
me
I
*NL*
tell
you
only
I
oughtnt
to
have
stitched
it
and
it
on
her
it
brings
a
*NL*
parting
and
the
last
plumpudding
too
split
in
2
halves
see
it
comes
out
*NL*
no
matter
what
they
say
her
tongue
is
a
bit
too
long
for
my
taste
*NL*
your
blouse
is
open
too
low
she
says
to
me
the
pan
calling
the
kettle
*NL*
blackbottom
and
I
had
to
tell
her
not
to
cock
her
legs
up
like
that
on
*NL*
show
on
the
windowsill
before
all
the
people
passing
they
all
look
at
*NL*
her
like
me
when
I
was
her
age
of
course
any
old
rag
looks
well
on
*NL*
you
then
a
great
touchmenot
too
in
her
own
way
at
the
Only
Way
in
the
*NL*
Theatre
royal
take
your
foot
away
out
of
that
I
hate
people
touching
*NL*
me
afraid
of
her
life
Id
crush
her
skirt
with
the
pleats
a
lot
of
that
*NL*
touching
must
go
on
in
theatres
in
the
crush
in
the
dark
theyre
always
*NL*
trying
to
wiggle
up
to
you
that
fellow
in
the
pit
at
the
Gaiety
for
*NL*
Beerbohm
Tree
in
Trilby
the
last
time
Ill
ever
go
there
to
be
squashed
*NL*
like
that
for
any
Trilby
or
her
barebum
every
two
minutes
tipping
me
*NL*
there
and
looking
away
hes
a
bit
daft
I
think
I
saw
him
after
trying
to
*NL*
get
near
two
stylishdressed
ladies
outside
Switzers
window
at
the
same
*NL*
little
game
I
recognised
him
on
the
moment
the
face
and
everything
but
*NL*
he
didnt
remember
me
yes
and
she
didnt
even
want
me
to
kiss
her
at
the
*NL*
Broadstone
going
away
well
I
hope
shell
get
someone
to
dance
attendance
*NL*
on
her
the
way
I
did
when
she
was
down
with
the
mumps
and
her
glands
*NL*
swollen
wheres
this
and
wheres
that
of
course
she
cant
feel
anything
*NL*
deep
yet
I
never
came
properly
till
I
was
what
22
or
so
it
went
into
the
*NL*
wrong
place
always
only
the
usual
girls
nonsense
and
giggling
that
*NL*
Conny
Connolly
writing
to
her
in
white
ink
on
black
paper
sealed
with
*NL*
sealingwax
though
she
clapped
when
the
curtain
came
down
because
he
*NL*
looked
so
handsome
then
we
had
Martin
Harvey
for
breakfast
dinner
and
*NL*
supper
I
thought
to
myself
afterwards
it
must
be
real
love
if
a
man
*NL*
gives
up
his
life
for
her
that
way
for
nothing
I
suppose
there
are
a
*NL*
few
men
like
that
left
its
hard
to
believe
in
it
though
unless
it
really
*NL*
happened
to
me
the
majority
of
them
with
not
a
particle
of
love
in
their
*NL*
natures
to
find
two
people
like
that
nowadays
full
up
of
each
other
that
*NL*
would
feel
the
same
way
as
you
do
theyre
usually
a
bit
foolish
in
the
*NL*
head
his
father
must
have
been
a
bit
queer
to
go
and
poison
himself
*NL*
after
her
still
poor
old
man
I
suppose
he
felt
lost
shes
always
making
*NL*
love
to
my
things
too
the
few
old
rags
I
have
wanting
to
put
her
hair
up
*NL*
at
I
S
my
powder
too
only
ruin
her
skin
on
her
shes
time
enough
for
that
*NL*
all
her
life
after
of
course
shes
restless
knowing
shes
pretty
with
her
*NL*
lips
so
red
a
pity
they
wont
stay
that
way
I
was
too
but
theres
no
use
*NL*
going
to
the
fair
with
the
thing
answering
me
like
a
fishwoman
when
*NL*
I
asked
to
go
for
a
half
a
stone
of
potatoes
the
day
we
met
Mrs
Joe
*NL*
Gallaher
at
the
trottingmatches
and
she
pretended
not
to
see
us
in
her
*NL*
trap
with
Friery
the
solicitor
we
werent
grand
enough
till
I
gave
her
2
*NL*
damn
fine
cracks
across
the
ear
for
herself
take
that
now
for
answering
*NL*
me
like
that
and
that
for
your
impudence
she
had
me
that
exasperated
of
*NL*
course
contradicting
I
was
badtempered
too
because
how
was
it
there
was
*NL*
a
weed
in
the
tea
or
I
didnt
sleep
the
night
before
cheese
I
ate
was
it
*NL*
and
I
told
her
over
and
over
again
not
to
leave
knives
crossed
like
that
*NL*
because
she
has
nobody
to
command
her
as
she
said
herself
well
if
he
*NL*
doesnt
correct
her
faith
I
will
that
was
the
last
time
she
turned
on
the
*NL*
teartap
I
was
just
like
that
myself
they
darent
order
me
about
the
place
*NL*
its
his
fault
of
course
having
the
two
of
us
slaving
here
instead
of
*NL*
getting
in
a
woman
long
ago
am
I
ever
going
to
have
a
proper
servant
*NL*
again
of
course
then
shed
see
him
coming
Id
have
to
let
her
know
or
shed
*NL*
revenge
it
arent
they
a
nuisance
that
old
Mrs
Fleming
you
have
to
be
*NL*
walking
round
after
her
putting
the
things
into
her
hands
sneezing
and
*NL*
farting
into
the
pots
well
of
course
shes
old
she
cant
help
it
a
good
*NL*
job
I
found
that
rotten
old
smelly
dishcloth
that
got
lost
behind
the
*NL*
dresser
I
knew
there
was
something
and
opened
the
area
window
to
let
out
*NL*
the
smell
bringing
in
his
friends
to
entertain
them
like
the
night
he
*NL*
walked
home
with
a
dog
if
you
please
that
might
have
been
mad
especially
*NL*
Simon
Dedalus
son
his
father
such
a
criticiser
with
his
glasses
up
with
*NL*
his
tall
hat
on
him
at
the
cricket
match
and
a
great
big
hole
in
his
*NL*
sock
one
thing
laughing
at
the
other
and
his
son
that
got
all
those
*NL*
prizes
for
whatever
he
won
them
in
the
intermediate
imagine
climbing
*NL*
over
the
railings
if
anybody
saw
him
that
knew
us
I
wonder
he
didnt
tear
*NL*
a
big
hole
in
his
grand
funeral
trousers
as
if
the
one
nature
gave
wasnt
*NL*
enough
for
anybody
hawking
him
down
into
the
dirty
old
kitchen
now
is
he
*NL*
right
in
his
head
I
ask
pity
it
wasnt
washing
day
my
old
pair
of
drawers
*NL*
might
have
been
hanging
up
too
on
the
line
on
exhibition
for
all
hed
*NL*
ever
care
with
the
ironmould
mark
the
stupid
old
bundle
burned
on
them
*NL*
he
might
think
was
something
else
and
she
never
even
rendered
down
the
*NL*
fat
I
told
her
and
now
shes
going
such
as
she
was
on
account
of
her
*NL*
paralysed
husband
getting
worse
theres
always
something
wrong
with
them
*NL*
disease
or
they
have
to
go
under
an
operation
or
if
its
not
that
its
*NL*
drink
and
he
beats
her
Ill
have
to
hunt
around
again
for
someone
every
*NL*
day
I
get
up
theres
some
new
thing
on
sweet
God
sweet
God
well
when
Im
*NL*
stretched
out
dead
in
my
grave
I
suppose
111
have
some
peace
I
want
to
*NL*
get
up
a
minute
if
Im
let
wait
O
Jesus
wait
yes
that
thing
has
come
on
*NL*
me
yes
now
wouldnt
that
afflict
you
of
course
all
the
poking
and
rooting
*NL*
and
ploughing
he
had
up
in
me
now
what
am
I
to
do
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
*NL*
wouldnt
that
pester
the
soul
out
of
a
body
unless
he
likes
it
some
men
*NL*
do
God
knows
theres
always
something
wrong
with
us
5
days
every
3
or
4
*NL*
weeks
usual
monthly
auction
isnt
it
simply
sickening
that
night
it
came
*NL*
on
me
like
that
the
one
and
only
time
we
were
in
a
box
that
Michael
Gunn
*NL*
gave
him
to
see
Mrs
Kendal
and
her
husband
at
the
Gaiety
something
he
*NL*
did
about
insurance
for
him
in
Drimmies
I
was
fit
to
be
tied
though
I
*NL*
wouldnt
give
in
with
that
gentleman
of
fashion
staring
down
at
me
with
*NL*
his
glasses
and
him
the
other
side
of
me
talking
about
Spinoza
and
his
*NL*
soul
thats
dead
I
suppose
millions
of
years
ago
I
smiled
the
best
I
*NL*
could
all
in
a
swamp
leaning
forward
as
if
I
was
interested
having
to
*NL*
sit
it
out
then
to
the
last
tag
I
wont
forget
that
wife
of
Scarli
in
*NL*
a
hurry
supposed
to
be
a
fast
play
about
adultery
that
idiot
in
the
*NL*
gallery
hissing
the
woman
adulteress
he
shouted
I
suppose
he
went
and
*NL*
had
a
woman
in
the
next
lane
running
round
all
the
back
ways
after
*NL*
to
make
up
for
it
I
wish
he
had
what
I
had
then
hed
boo
I
bet
the
cat
*NL*
itself
is
better
off
than
us
have
we
too
much
blood
up
in
us
or
what
O
*NL*
patience
above
its
pouring
out
of
me
like
the
sea
anyhow
he
didnt
make
*NL*
me
pregnant
as
big
as
he
is
I
dont
want
to
ruin
the
clean
sheets
I
just
*NL*
put
on
I
suppose
the
clean
linen
I
wore
brought
it
on
too
damn
it
damn
*NL*
it
and
they
always
want
to
see
a
stain
on
the
bed
to
know
youre
a
virgin
*NL*
for
them
all
thats
troubling
them
theyre
such
fools
too
you
could
be
a
*NL*
widow
or
divorced
40
times
over
a
daub
of
red
ink
would
do
or
blackberry
*NL*
juice
no
thats
too
purply
O
Jamesy

me
up
out
of
this
pooh
sweets
of
*NL*
sin
whoever
suggested
that
business
for
women
what
between
clothes
and
*NL*
cooking
and
children
this
damned
old
bed
too
jingling
like
the
dickens
*NL*
I
suppose
they
could
hear
us
away
over
the
other
side
of
the
park
till
I
*NL*
suggested
to
put
the
quilt
on
the
floor
with
the
pillow
under
my
bottom
*NL*
I
wonder
is
it
nicer
in
the
day
I
think
it
is
easy
I
think
Ill
cut
*NL*
all
this
hair
off
me
there
scalding
me
I
might
look
like
a
young
girl
*NL*
wouldnt
he
get
the
great
suckin
the
next
time
he
turned
up
my
clothes
on
*NL*
me
Id
give
anything
to
see
his
face
wheres
the
chamber
gone
easy
Ive
a
*NL*
holy
horror
of
its
breaking
under
me
after
that
old
commode
I
wonder
*NL*
was
I
too
heavy
sitting
on
his
knee
I
made
him
sit
on
the
easychair
*NL*
purposely
when
I
took
off
only
my
blouse
and
skirt
first
in
the
other
*NL*
room
he
was
so
busy
where
he
oughtnt
to
be
he
never
felt
me
I
hope
my
*NL*
breath
was
sweet
after
those
kissing
comfits
easy
God
I
remember
one
*NL*
time
I
could
scout
it
out
straight
whistling
like
a
man
almost
easy
O
*NL*
Lord
how
noisy
I
hope
theyre
bubbles
on
it
for
a
wad
of
money
from
some
*NL*
fellow
111
have
to
perfume
it
in
the
morning
dont
forget
I
bet
he
*NL*
never
saw
a
better
pair
of
thighs
than
that
look
how
white
they
are
the
*NL*
smoothest
place
is
right
there
between
this
bit
here
how
soft
like
a
*NL*
peach
easy
God
I
wouldnt
mind
being
a
man
and
get
up
on
a
lovely
woman
*NL*
O
Lord
what
a
row
youre
making
like
the
jersey
lily
easy
easy
O
how
the
*NL*
waters
come
down
at
Lahore
*NL*
*NL*
who
knows
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
my
insides
or
have
I
*NL*
something
growing
in
me
getting
that
thing
like
that
every
week
when
was
*NL*
it
last
I
Whit
Monday
yes
its
only
about
3
weeks
I
ought
to
go
to
the
*NL*
doctor
only
it
would
be
like
before
I
married
him
when
I
had
that
white
*NL*
thing
coming
from
me
and
Floey
made
me
go
to
that
dry
old
stick
Dr
*NL*
Collins
for
womens
diseases
on
Pembroke
road
your
vagina
he
called
it
I
*NL*
suppose
thats
how
he
got
all
the
gilt
mirrors
and
carpets
getting
round
*NL*
those
rich
ones
off
Stephens
green
running
up
to
him
for
every
little
*NL*
fiddlefaddle
her
vagina
and
her
cochinchina
theyve
money
of
course
so
*NL*
theyre
all
right
I
wouldnt
marry
him
not
if
he
was
the
last
man
in
*NL*
the
world
besides
theres
something
queer
about
their
children
always
*NL*
smelling
around
those
filthy
bitches
all
sides
asking
me
if
what
I
did
*NL*
had
an
offensive
odour
what
did
he
want
me
to
do
but
the
one
thing
gold
*NL*
maybe
what
a
question
if
I
smathered
it
all
over
his
wrinkly
old
face
*NL*
for
him
with
all
my
compriments
I
suppose
hed
know
then
and
could
you
*NL*
pass
it
easily
pass
what
I
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
rock
of
*NL*
Gibraltar
the
way
he
put
it
thats
a
very
nice
invention
too
by
the
*NL*
way
only
I
like
letting
myself
down
after
in
the
hole
as
far
as
I
can
*NL*
squeeze
and
pull
the
chain
then
to
flush
it
nice
cool
pins
and
needles
*NL*
still
theres
something
in
it
I
suppose
I
always
used
to
know
by
Millys
*NL*
when
she
was
a
child
whether
she
had
worms
or
not
still
all
the
same
*NL*
paying
him
for
that
how
much
is
that
doctor
one
guinea
please
and
asking
*NL*
me
had
I
frequent
omissions
where
do
those
old
fellows
get
all
the
words
*NL*
they
have
omissions
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
on
me
cocked
sideways
I
*NL*
wouldnt
trust
him
too
far
to
give
me
chloroform
or
God
knows
what
else
*NL*
still
I
liked
him
when
he
sat
down
to
write
the
thing
out
frowning
so
*NL*
severe
his
nose
intelligent
like
that
you
be
damned
you
lying
strap
O
*NL*
anything
no
matter
who
except
an
idiot
he
was
clever
enough
to
spot
*NL*
that
of
course
that
was
all
thinking
of
him
and
his
mad
crazy
letters
*NL*
my
Precious
one
everything
connected
with
your
glorious
Body
everything
*NL*
underlined
that
comes
from
it
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
of
joy
for
ever
*NL*
something
he
got
out
of
some
nonsensical
book
that
he
had
me
always
at
*NL*
myself
4
and
5
times
a
day
sometimes
and
I
said
I
hadnt
are
you
sure
*NL*
O
yes
I
said
I
am
quite
sure
in
a
way
that
shut
him
up
I
knew
what
was
*NL*
coming
next
only
natural
weakness
it
was
he
excited
me
I
dont
know
how
*NL*
the
first
night
ever
we
met
when
I
was
living
in
Rehoboth
terrace
we
*NL*
stood
staring
at
one
another
for
about
lo
minutes
as
if
we
met
somewhere
*NL*
I
suppose
on
account
of
my
being
jewess
looking
after
my
mother
he
used
*NL*
to
amuse
me
the
things
he
said
with
the
half
sloothering
smile
on
him
*NL*
and
all
the
Doyles
said
he
was
going
to
stand
for
a
member
of
Parliament
*NL*
O
wasnt
I
the
born
fool
to
believe
all
his
blather
about
home
rule
*NL*
and
the
land
league
sending
me
that
long
strool
of
a
song
out
of
the
*NL*
Huguenots
to
sing
in
French
to
be
more
classy
O
beau
pays
de
la
Touraine
*NL*
that
I
never
even
sang
once
explaining
and
rigmaroling
about
religion
*NL*
and
persecution
he
wont
let
you
enjoy
anything
naturally
then
might
he
*NL*
as
a
great
favour
the
very
1st
opportunity
he
got
a
chance
in
Brighton
*NL*
square
running
into
my
bedroom
pretending
the
ink
got
on
his
hands
to
*NL*
wash
it
off
with
the
Albion
milk
and
sulphur
soap
I
used
to
use
and
the
*NL*
gelatine
still
round
it
O
I
laughed
myself
sick
at
him
that
day
I
better
*NL*
not
make
an
alnight
sitting
on
this
affair
they
ought
to
make
chambers
a
*NL*
natural
size
so
that
a
woman
could
sit
on
it
properly
he
kneels
down
to
*NL*
do
it
I
suppose
there
isnt
in
all
creation
another
man
with
the
habits
*NL*
he
has
look
at
the
way
hes
sleeping
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
how
can
he
*NL*
without
a
hard
bolster
its
well
he
doesnt
kick
or
he
might
knock
out
*NL*
all
my
teeth
breathing
with
his
hand
on
his
nose
like
that
Indian
god
*NL*
he
took
me
to
show
one
wet
Sunday
in
the
museum
in
Kildare
street
all
*NL*
yellow
in
a
pinafore
lying
on
his
side
on
his
hand
with
his
ten
toes
*NL*
sticking
out
that
he
said
was
a
bigger
religion
than
the
jews
and
*NL*
Our
Lords
both
put
together
all
over
Asia
imitating
him
as
hes
always
*NL*
imitating
everybody
I
suppose
he
used
to
sleep
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
*NL*
too
with
his
big
square
feet
up
in
his
wifes
mouth
damn
this
stinking
*NL*
thing
anyway
wheres
this
those
napkins
are
ah
yes
I
know
I
hope
the
old
*NL*
press
doesnt
creak
ah
I
knew
it
would
hes
sleeping
hard
had
a
good
time
*NL*
somewhere
still
she
must
have
given
him
great
value
for
his
money
of
*NL*
course
he
has
to
pay
for
it
from
her
O
this
nuisance
of
a
thing
I
hope
*NL*
theyll
have
something
better
for
us
in
the
other
world
tying
ourselves
*NL*
up
God
help
us
thats
all
right
for
tonight
now
the
lumpy
old
jingly
*NL*
bed
always
reminds
me
of
old
Cohen
I
suppose
he
scratched
himself
in
it
*NL*
often
enough
and
he
thinks
father
bought
it
from
Lord
Napier
that
I
used
*NL*
to
admire
when
I
was
a
little
girl
because
I
told
him
easy
piano
O
*NL*
I
like
my
bed
God
here
we
are
as
bad
as
ever
after
16
years
how
many
*NL*
houses
were
we
in
at
all
Raymond
terrace
and
Ontario
terrace
and
Lombard
*NL*
street
and
Holles
street
and
he
goes
about
whistling
every
time
were
on
*NL*
the
run
again
his
huguenots
or
the
frogs
march
pretending
to
help
the
*NL*
men
with
our
4
sticks
of
furniture
and
then
the
City
Arms
hotel
worse
*NL*
and
worse
says
Warden
Daly
that
charming
place
on
the
landing
always
*NL*
somebody
inside
praying
then
leaving
all
their
stinks
after
them
*NL*
always
know
who
was
in
there
last
every
time
were
just
getting
on
right
*NL*
something
happens
or
he
puts
his
big
foot
in
it
Thoms
and
Helys
and
Mr
*NL*
Cuffes
and
Drimmies
either
hes
going
to
be
run
into
prison
over
his
old
*NL*
lottery
tickets
that
was
to
be
all
our
salvations
or
he
goes
and
gives
*NL*
impudence
well
have
him
coming
home
with
the
sack
soon
out
of
the
*NL*
Freeman
too
like
the
rest
on
account
of
those
Sinner
Fein
or
the
*NL*
freemasons
then
well
see
if
the
little
man
he
showed
me
dribbling
*NL*
along
in
the
wet
all
by
himself
round
by
Coadys
lane
will
give
him
much
*NL*
consolation
that
he
says
is
so
capable
and
sincerely
Irish
he
is
indeed
*NL*
judging
by
the
sincerity
of
the
trousers
I
saw
on
him
wait
theres
*NL*
Georges
church
bells
wait
3
quarters
the
hour
l
wait
2
oclock
well
*NL*
thats
a
nice
hour
of
the
night
for
him
to
be
coming
home
at
to
anybody
*NL*
climbing
down
into
the
area
if
anybody
saw
him
Ill
knock
him
off
that
*NL*
little
habit
tomorrow
first
Ill
look
at
his
shirt
to
see
or
Ill
see
if
*NL*
he
has
that
French
letter
still
in
his
pocketbook
I
suppose
he
thinks
I
*NL*
dont
know
deceitful
men
all
their
20
pockets
arent
enough
for
their
lies
*NL*
then
why
should
we
tell
them
even
if
its
the
truth
they
dont
believe
you
*NL*
then
tucked
up
in
bed
like
those
babies
in
the
Aristocrats
Masterpiece
*NL*
he
brought
me
another
time
as
if
we
hadnt
enough
of
that
in
real
life
*NL*
without
some
old
Aristocrat
or
whatever
his
name
is
disgusting
you
more
*NL*
with
those
rotten
pictures
children
with
two
heads
and
no
legs
thats
the
*NL*
kind
of
villainy
theyre
always
dreaming
about
with
not
another
thing
in
*NL*
their
empty
heads
they
ought
to
get
slow
poison
the
half
of
them
then
*NL*
tea
and
toast
for
him
buttered
on
both
sides
and
newlaid
eggs
I
suppose
*NL*
Im
nothing
any
more
when
I
wouldnt
let
him
lick
me
in
Holles
street
one
*NL*
night
man
man
tyrant
as
ever
for
the
one
thing
he
slept
on
the
floor
*NL*
half
the
night
naked
the
way
the
jews
used
when
somebody
dies
belonged
*NL*
to
them
and
wouldnt
eat
any
breakfast
or
speak
a
word
wanting
to
be
*NL*
petted
so
I
thought
I
stood
out
enough
for
one
time
and
let
him
he
does
*NL*
it
all
wrong
too
thinking
only
of
his
own
pleasure
his
tongue
is
too
*NL*
flat
or
I
dont
know
what
he
forgets
that
wethen
I
dont
Ill
make
him
do
*NL*
it
again
if
he
doesnt
mind
himself
and
lock
him
down
to
sleep
in
the
*NL*
coalcellar
with
the
blackbeetles
I
wonder
was
it
her
Josie
off
her
head
*NL*
with
my
castoffs
hes
such
a
born
liar
too
no
hed
never
have
the
courage
*NL*
with
a
married
woman
thats
why
he
wants
me
and
Boylan
though
as
for
her
*NL*
Denis
as
she
calls
him
that
forlornlooking
spectacle
you
couldnt
call
*NL*
him
a
husband
yes
its
some
little
bitch
hes
got
in
with
even
when
I
was
*NL*
with
him
with
Milly
at
the
College
races
that
Hornblower
with
the
childs
*NL*
bonnet
on
the
top
of
his
nob
let
us
into
by
the
back
way
he
was
throwing
*NL*
his
sheeps
eyes
at
those
two
doing
skirt
duty
up
and
down
I
tried
to
*NL*
wink
at
him
first
no
use
of
course
and
thats
the
way
his
money
goes
this
*NL*
is
the
fruits
of
Mr
Paddy
Dignam
yes
they
were
all
in
great
style
at
the
*NL*
grand
funeral
in
the
paper
Boylan
brought
in
if
they
saw
a
real
officers
*NL*
funeral
thatd
be
something
reversed
arms
muffled
drums
the
poor
horse
*NL*
walking
behind
in
black
L
Boom
and
Tom
Kernan
that
drunken
little
*NL*
barrelly
man
that
bit
his
tongue
off
falling
down
the
mens
W
C
drunk
*NL*
in
some
place
or
other
and
Martin
Cunningham
and
the
two
Dedaluses
and
*NL*
Fanny
MCoys
husband
white
head
of
cabbage
skinny
thing
with
a
turn
in
*NL*
her
eye
trying
to
sing
my
songs
shed
want
to
be
born
all
over
again
and
*NL*
her
old
green
dress
with
the
lowneck
as
she
cant
attract
them
any
other
*NL*
way
like
dabbling
on
a
rainy
day
I
see
it
all
now
plainly
and
they
call
*NL*
that
friendship
killing
and
then
burying
one
another
and
they
all
with
*NL*
their
wives
and
families
at
home
more
especially
Jack
Power
keeping
that
*NL*
barmaid
he
does
of
course
his
wife
is
always
sick
or
going
to
be
sick
*NL*
or
just
getting
better
of
it
and
hes
a
goodlooking
man
still
though
*NL*
hes
getting
a
bit
grey
over
the
ears
theyre
a
nice
lot
all
of
them
well
*NL*
theyre
not
going
to
get
my
husband
again
into
their
clutches
if
I
can
*NL*
help
it
making
fun
of
him
then
behind
his
back
I
know
well
when
he
goes
*NL*
on
with
his
idiotics
because
he
has
sense
enough
not
to
squander
every
*NL*
penny
piece
he
earns
down
their
gullets
and
looks
after
his
wife
and
*NL*
family
goodfornothings
poor
Paddy
Dignam
all
the
same
Im
sorry
in
a
*NL*
way
for
him
what
are
his
wife
and
5
children
going
to
do
unless
he
was
*NL*
insured
comical
little
teetotum
always
stuck
up
in
some
pub
corner
and
*NL*
her
or
her
son
waiting
Bill
Bailey
wont
you
please
come
home
her
widows
*NL*
weeds
wont
improve
her
appearance
theyre
awfully
becoming
though
if
*NL*
youre
goodlooking
what
men
wasnt
he
yes
he
was
at
the
Glencree
dinner
*NL*
and
Ben
Dollard
base
barreltone
the
night
he
borrowed
the
swallowtail
*NL*
to
sing
out
of
in
Holles
street
squeezed
and
squashed
into
them
and
*NL*
grinning
all
over
his
big
Dolly
face
like
a
wellwhipped
childs
botty
*NL*
didnt
he
look
a
balmy
ballocks
sure
enough
that
must
have
been
a
*NL*
spectacle
on
the
stage
imagine
paying
5
/
-
in
the
preserved
seats
for
*NL*
that
to
see
him
trotting
off
in
his
trowlers
and
Simon
Dedalus
too
he
*NL*
was
always
turning
up
half
screwed
singing
the
second
verse
first
the
*NL*
old
love
is
the
new
was
one
of
his
so
sweetly
sang
the
maiden
on
the
*NL*
hawthorn
bough
he
was
always
on
for
flirtyfying
too
when
I
sang
Maritana
*NL*
with
him
at
Freddy
Mayers
private
opera
he
had
a
delicious
glorious
*NL*
voice
Phoebe
dearest
goodbye
_
sweet_heart
sweetheart
he
always
sang
it
*NL*
not
like
Bartell
Darcy
sweet
tart
goodbye
of
course
he
had
the
gift
of
*NL*
the
voice
so
there
was
no
art
in
it
all
over
you
like
a
warm
showerbath
*NL*
O
Maritana
wildwood
flower
we
sang
splendidly
though
it
was
a
bit
too
*NL*
high
for
my
register
even
transposed
and
he
was
married
at
the
time
to
*NL*
May
Goulding
but
then
hed
say
or
do
something
to
knock
the
good
out
of
*NL*
it
hes
a
widower
now
I
wonder
what
sort
is
his
son
he
says
hes
an
author
*NL*
and
going
to
be
a
university
professor
of
Italian
and
Im
to
take
lessons
*NL*
what
is
he
driving
at
now
showing
him
my
photo
its
not
good
of
me
I
*NL*
ought
to
have
got
it
taken
in
drapery
that
never
looks
out
of
fashion
*NL*
still
I
look
young
in
it
I
wonder
he
didnt
make
him
a
present
of
it
*NL*
altogether
and
me
too
after
all
why
not
I
saw
him
driving
down
to
the
*NL*
Kingsbridge
station
with
his
father
and
mother
I
was
in
mourning
thats
*NL*
11
years
ago
now
yes
hed
be
11
though
what
was
the
good
in
going
into
*NL*
mourning
for
what
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
first
cry
was
*NL*
enough
for
me
I
heard
the
deathwatch
too
ticking
in
the
wall
of
course
*NL*
he
insisted
hed
go
into
mourning
for
the
cat
I
suppose
hes
a
man
now
by
*NL*
this
time
he
was
an
innocent
boy
then
and
a
darling
little
fellow
in
his
*NL*
lord
Fauntleroy
suit
and
curly
hair
like
a
prince
on
the
stage
when
I
*NL*
saw
him
at
Mat
Dillons
he
liked
me
too
I
remember
they
all
do
wait
by
*NL*
God
yes
wait
yes
hold
on
he
was
on
the
cards
this
morning
when
I
laid
*NL*
out
the
deck
union
with
a
young
stranger
neither
dark
nor
fair
you
met
*NL*
before
I
thought
it
meant
him
but
hes
no
chicken
nor
a
stranger
either
*NL*
besides
my
face
was
turned
the
other
way
what
was
the
7th
card
after
*NL*
that
the
10
of
spades
for
a
journey
by
land
then
there
was
a
letter
on
*NL*
its
way
and
scandals
too
the
3
queens
and
the
8
of
diamonds
for
a
rise
*NL*
in
society
yes
wait
it
all
came
out
and
2
red
8s
for
new
garments
look
*NL*
at
that
and
didnt
I
dream
something
too
yes
there
was
something
about
*NL*
poetry
in
it
I
hope
he
hasnt
long
greasy
hair
hanging
into
his
eyes
or
*NL*
standing
up
like
a
red
Indian
what
do
they
go
about
like
that
for
only
*NL*
getting
themselves
and
their
poetry
laughed
at
I
always
liked
poetry
*NL*
when
I
was
a
girl
first
I
thought
he
was
a
poet
like
lord
Byron
and
not
*NL*
an
ounce
of
it
in
his
composition
I
thought
he
was
quite
different
I
*NL*
wonder
is
he
too
young
hes
about
wait
88
I
was
married
88
Milly
is
15
*NL*
yesterday
89
what
age
was
he
then
at
Dillons
5
or
6
about
88
I
suppose
*NL*
hes
20
or
more
Im
not
too
old
for
him
if
hes
23
or
24
I
hope
hes
not
*NL*
that
stuckup
university
student
sort
no
otherwise
he
wouldnt
go
sitting
*NL*
down
in
the
old
kitchen
with
him
taking
Eppss
cocoa
and
talking
of
*NL*
course
he
pretended
to
understand
it
all
probably
he
told
him
he
was
*NL*
out
of
Trinity
college
hes
very
young
to
be
a
professor
I
hope
hes
not
*NL*
a
professor
like
Goodwin
was
he
was
a
potent
professor
of
John
Jameson
*NL*
they
all
write
about
some
woman
in
their
poetry
well
I
suppose
he
wont
*NL*
find
many
like
me
where
softly
sighs
of
love
the
light
guitar
where
*NL*
poetry
is
in
the
air
the
blue
sea
and
the
moon
shining
so
beautifully
*NL*
coming
back
on
the
nightboat
from
Tarifa
the
lighthouse
at
Europa
point
*NL*
the
guitar
that
fellow
played
was
so
expressive
will
I
ever
go
back
*NL*
there
again
all
new
faces
two
glancing
eyes
a
lattice
hid
Ill
sing
that
*NL*
for
him
theyre
my
eyes
if
hes
anything
of
a
poet
two
eyes
as
darkly
*NL*
bright
as
loves
own
star
arent
those
beautiful
words
as
loves
young
star
*NL*
itll
be
a
change
the
Lord
knows
to
have
an
intelligent
person
to
talk
*NL*
to
about
yourself
not
always
listening
to
him
and
Billy
Prescotts
ad
*NL*
and
Keyess
ad
and
Tom
the
Devils
ad
then
if
anything
goes
wrong
in
their
*NL*
business
we
have
to
suffer
Im
sure
hes
very
distinguished
Id
like
to
*NL*
meet
a
man
like
that
God
not
those
other
ruck
besides
hes
young
those
*NL*
fine
young
men
I
could
see
down
in
Margate
strand
bathingplace
from
the
*NL*
side
of
the
rock
standing
up
in
the
sun
naked
like
a
God
or
something
*NL*
and
then
plunging
into
the
sea
with
them
why
arent
all
men
like
that
*NL*
thered
be
some
consolation
for
a
woman
like
that
lovely
little
statue
he
*NL*
bought
I
could
look
at
him
all
day
long
curly
head
and
his
shoulders
*NL*
his
finger
up
for
you
to
listen
theres
real
beauty
and
poetry
for
you
*NL*
I
often
felt
I
wanted
to
kiss
him
all
over
also
his
lovely
young
cock
*NL*
there
so
simple
I
wouldnt
mind
taking
him
in
my
mouth
if
nobody
was
*NL*
looking
as
if
it
was
asking
you
to
suck
it
so
clean
and
white
he
looks
*NL*
with
his
boyish
face
I
would
too
in
1/2
a
minute
even
if
some
of
it
went
*NL*
down
what
its
only
like
gruel
or
the
dew
theres
no
danger
besides
hed
*NL*
be
so
clean
compared
with
those
pigs
of
men
I
suppose
never
dream
of
*NL*
washing
it
from
I
years
end
to
the
other
the
most
of
them
only
thats
*NL*
what
gives
the
women
the
moustaches
Im
sure
itll
be
grand
if
I
can
only
*NL*
get
in
with
a
handsome
young
poet
at
my
age
Ill
throw
them
the
1st
thing
*NL*
in
the
morning
till
I
see
if
the
wishcard
comes
out
or
Ill
try
pairing
*NL*
the
lady
herself
and
see
if
he
comes
out
Ill
read
and
study
all
I
can
*NL*
find
or
learn
a
bit
off
by
heart
if
I
knew
who
he
likes
so
he
wont
think
*NL*
me
stupid
if
he
thinks
all
women
are
the
same
and
I
can
teach
him
the
*NL*
other
part
Ill
make
him
feel
all
over
him
till
he
half
faints
under
*NL*
me
then
hell
write
about
me
lover
and
mistress
publicly
too
with
our
2
*NL*
photographs
in
all
the
papers
when
he
becomes
famous
O
but
then
what
am
*NL*
I
going
to
do
about
him
though
*NL*
*NL*
no
thats
no
way
for
him
has
he
no
manners
nor
no
refinement
nor
no
*NL*
nothing
in
his
nature
slapping
us
behind
like
that
on
my
bottom
because
*NL*
I
didnt
call
him
Hugh
the
ignoramus
that
doesnt
know
poetry
from
a
*NL*
cabbage
thats
what
you
get
for
not
keeping
them
in
their
proper
place
*NL*
pulling
off
his
shoes
and
trousers
there
on
the
chair
before
me
so
*NL*
barefaced
without
even
asking
permission
and
standing
out
that
vulgar
*NL*
way
in
the
half
of
a
shirt
they
wear
to
be
admired
like
a
priest
or
a
*NL*
butcher
or
those
old
hypocrites
in
the
time
of
Julius
Caesar
of
course
*NL*
hes
right
enough
in
his
way
to
pass
the
time
as
a
joke
sure
you
might
*NL*
as
well
be
in
bed
with
what
with
a
lion
God
Im
sure
hed
have
something
*NL*
better
to
say
for
himself
an
old
Lion
would
O
well
I
suppose
its
because
*NL*
they
were
so
plump
and
tempting
in
my
short
petticoat
he
couldnt
resist
*NL*
they
excite
myself
sometimes
its
well
for
men
all
the
amount
of
pleasure
*NL*
they
get
off
a
womans
body
were
so
round
and
white
for
them
always
I
*NL*
wished
I
was
one
myself
for
a
change
just
to
try
with
that
thing
they
*NL*
have
swelling
up
on
you
so
hard
and
at
the
same
time
so
soft
when
you
*NL*
touch
it
my
uncle
John
has
a
thing
long
I
heard
those
cornerboys
saying
*NL*
passing
the
comer
of
Marrowbone
lane
my
aunt
Mary
has
a
thing
hairy
*NL*
because
it
was
dark
and
they
knew
a
girl
was
passing
it
didnt
make
me
*NL*
blush
why
should
it
either
its
only
nature
and
he
puts
his
thing
long
*NL*
into
my
aunt
Marys
hairy
etcetera
and
turns
out
to
be
you
put
the
handle
*NL*
in
a
sweepingbrush
men
again
all
over
they
can
pick
and
choose
what
they
*NL*
please
a
married
woman
or
a
fast
widow
or
a
girl
for
their
different
*NL*
tastes
like
those
houses
round
behind
Irish
street
no
but
were
to
be
*NL*
always
chained
up
theyre
not
going
to
be
chaining
me
up
no
damn
fear
*NL*
once
I
start
I
tell
you
for
their
stupid
husbands
jealousy
why
cant
we
*NL*
all
remain
friends
over
it
instead
of
quarrelling
her
husband
found
it
*NL*
out
what
they
did
together
well
naturally
and
if
he
did
can
he
undo
it
*NL*
hes
coronado
anyway
whatever
he
does
and
then
he
going
to
the
other
*NL*
mad
extreme
about
the
wife
in
Fair
Tyrants
of
course
the
man
never
even
*NL*
casts
a
2nd
thought
on
the
husband
or
wife
either
its
the
woman
he
wants
*NL*
and
he
gets
her
what
else
were
we
given
all
those
desires
for
Id
like
to
*NL*
know
I
cant
help
it
if
Im
young
still
can
I
its
a
wonder
Im
not
an
old
*NL*
shrivelled
hag
before
my
time
living
with
him
so
cold
never
embracing
*NL*
me
except
sometimes
when
hes
asleep
the
wrong
end
of
me
not
knowing
I
*NL*
suppose
who
he
has
any
man
thatd
kiss
a
womans
bottom
Id
throw
my
hat
at
*NL*
him
after
that
hed
kiss
anything
unnatural
where
we
havent
I
atom
of
any
*NL*
kind
of
expression
in
us
all
of
us
the
same
2
lumps
of
lard
before
ever
*NL*
Id
do
that
to
a
man
pfooh
the
dirty
brutes
the
mere
thought
is
enough
*NL*
I
kiss
the
feet
of
you
senorita
theres
some
sense
in
that
didnt
he
kiss
*NL*
our
halldoor
yes
he
did
what
a
madman
nobody
understands
his
cracked
*NL*
ideas
but
me
still
of
course
a
woman
wants
to
be
embraced
20
times
a
day
*NL*
almost
to
make
her
look
young
no
matter
by
who
so
long
as
to
be
in
love
*NL*
or
loved
by
somebody
if
the
fellow
you
want
isnt
there
sometimes
by
the
*NL*
Lord
God
I
was
thinking
would
I
go
around
by
the
quays
there
some
dark
*NL*
evening
where
nobodyd
know
me
and
pick
up
a
sailor
off
the
sea
thatd
be
*NL*
hot
on
for
it
and
not
care
a
pin
whose
I
was
only
do
it
off
up
in
a
gate
*NL*
somewhere
or
one
of
those
wildlooking
gipsies
in
Rathfarnham
had
their
*NL*
camp
pitched
near
the
Bloomfield
laundry
to
try
and
steal
our
things
if
*NL*
they
could
I
only
sent
mine
there
a
few
times
for
the
name
model
*NL*
laundry
sending
me
back
over
and
over
some
old
ones
odd
stockings
that
*NL*
blackguardlooking
fellow
with
the
fine
eyes
peeling
a
switch
attack
me
*NL*
in
the
dark
and
ride
me
up
against
the
wall
without
a
word
or
a
murderer
*NL*
anybody
what
they
do
themselves
the
fine
gentlemen
in
their
silk
hats
*NL*
that
K
C
lives
up
somewhere
this
way
coming
out
of
Hardwicke
lane
the
*NL*
night
he
gave
us
the
fish
supper
on
account
of
winning
over
the
boxing
*NL*
match
of
course
it
was
for
me
he
gave
it
I
knew
him
by
his
gaiters
and
*NL*
the
walk
and
when
I
turned
round
a
minute
after
just
to
see
there
was
*NL*
a
woman
after
coming
out
of
it
too
some
filthy
prostitute
then
he
goes
*NL*
home
to
his
wife
after
that
only
I
suppose
the
half
of
those
sailors
are
*NL*
rotten
again
with
disease
O
move
over
your
big
carcass
out
of
that
for
*NL*
the
love
of
Mike
listen
to
him
the
winds
that
waft
my
sighs
to
thee
so
*NL*
well
he
may
sleep
and
sigh
the
great
Suggester
Don
Poldo
de
la
Flora
if
*NL*
he
knew
how
he
came
out
on
the
cards
this
morning
hed
have
something
to
*NL*
sigh
for
a
dark
man
in
some
perplexity
between
2
7s
too
in
prison
for
*NL*
Lord
knows
what
he
does
that
I
dont
know
and
Im
to
be
slooching
around
*NL*
down
in
the
kitchen
to
get
his
lordship
his
breakfast
while
hes
rolled
*NL*
up
like
a
mummy
will
I
indeed
did
you
ever
see
me
running
Id
just
like
*NL*
to
see
myself
at
it
show
them
attention
and
they
treat
you
like
dirt
*NL*
I
dont
care
what
anybody
says
itd
be
much
better
for
the
world
to
be
*NL*
governed
by
the
women
in
it
you
wouldnt
see
women
going
and
killing
one
*NL*
another
and
slaughtering
when
do
you
ever
see
women
rolling
around
drunk
*NL*
like
they
do
or
gambling
every
penny
they
have
and
losing
it
on
horses
*NL*
yes
because
a
woman
whatever
she
does
she
knows
where
to
stop
sure
they
*NL*
wouldnt
be
in
the
world
at
all
only
for
us
they
dont
know
what
it
is
to
*NL*
be
a
woman
and
a
mother
how
could
they
where
would
they
all
of
them
be
*NL*
if
they
hadnt
all
a
mother
to
look
after
them
what
I
never
had
thats
*NL*
why
I
suppose
hes
running
wild
now
out
at
night
away
from
his
books
*NL*
and
studies
and
not
living
at
home
on
account
of
the
usual
rowy
house
I
*NL*
suppose
well
its
a
poor
case
that
those
that
have
a
fine
son
like
that
*NL*
theyre
not
satisfied
and
I
none
was
he
not
able
to
make
one
it
wasnt
my
*NL*
fault
we
came
together
when
I
was
watching
the
two
dogs
up
in
her
behind
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
naked
street
that
disheartened
me
altogether
I
*NL*
suppose
I
oughtnt
to
have
buried
him
in
that
little
woolly
jacket
I
*NL*
knitted
crying
as
I
was
but
give
it
to
some
poor
child
but
I
knew
well
*NL*
Id
never
have
another
our
1st
death
too
it
was
we
were
never
the
same
*NL*
since
O
Im
not
going
to
think
myself
into
the
glooms
about
that
any
*NL*
more
I
wonder
why
he
wouldnt
stay
the
night
I
felt
all
the
time
it
was
*NL*
somebody
strange
he
brought
in
instead
of
roving
around
the
city
meeting
*NL*
God
knows
who
nightwalkers
and
pickpockets
his
poor
mother
wouldnt
*NL*
like
that
if
she
was
alive
ruining
himself
for
life
perhaps
still
its
a
*NL*
lovely
hour
so
silent
I
used
to
love
coming
home
after
dances
the
air
of
*NL*
the
night
they
have
friends
they
can
talk
to
weve
none
either
he
wants
*NL*
what
he
wont
get
or
its
some
woman
ready
to
stick
her
knife
in
you
I
*NL*
hate
that
in
women
no
wonder
they
treat
us
the
way
they
do
we
are
a
*NL*
dreadful
lot
of
bitches
I
suppose
its
all
the
troubles
we
have
makes
us
*NL*
so
snappy
Im
not
like
that
he
could
easy
have
slept
in
there
on
the
sofa
*NL*
in
the
other
room
I
suppose
he
was
as
shy
as
a
boy
he
being
so
young
*NL*
hardly
20
of
me
in
the
next
room
hed
have
heard
me
on
the
chamber
arrah
*NL*
what
harm
Dedalus
I
wonder
its
like
those
names
in
Gibraltar
Delapaz
*NL*
Delagracia
they
had
the
devils
queer
names
there
father
Vilaplana
of
*NL*
Santa
Maria
that
gave
me
the
rosary
Rosales
y
OReilly
in
the
Calle
las
*NL*
Siete
Revueltas
and
Pisimbo
and
Mrs
Opisso
in
Governor
street
O
what
a
*NL*
name
Id
go
and
drown
myself
in
the
first
river
if
I
had
a
name
like
*NL*
her
O
my
and
all
the
bits
of
streets
Paradise
ramp
and
Bedlam
ramp
and
*NL*
Rodgers
ramp
and
Crutchetts
ramp
and
the
devils
gap
steps
well
small
*NL*
blame
to
me
if
I
am
a
harumscarum
I
know
I
am
a
bit
I
declare
to
God
I
*NL*
dont
feel
a
day
older
than
then
I
wonder
could
I
get
my
tongue
round
*NL*
any
of
the
Spanish
como
esta
usted
muy
bien
gracias
y
usted
see
I
havent
*NL*
forgotten
it
all
I
thought
I
had
only
for
the
grammar
a
noun
is
the
*NL*
name
of
any
person
place
or
thing
pity
I
never
tried
to
read
that
novel
*NL*
cantankerous
Mrs
Rubio
lent
me
by
Valera
with
the
questions
in
it
all
*NL*
upside
down
the
two
ways
I
always
knew
wed
go
away
in
the
end
I
can
*NL*
tell
him
the
Spanish
and
he
tell
me
the
Italian
then
hell
see
Im
not
*NL*
so
ignorant
what
a
pity
he
didnt
stay
Im
sure
the
poor
fellow
was
dead
*NL*
tired
and
wanted
a
good
sleep
badly
I
could
have
brought
him
in
his
*NL*
breakfast
in
bed
with
a
bit
of
toast
so
long
as
I
didnt
do
it
on
*NL*
the
knife
for
bad
luck
or
if
the
woman
was
going
her
rounds
with
the
*NL*
watercress
and
something
nice
and
tasty
there
are
a
few
olives
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
he
might
like
I
never
could
bear
the
look
of
them
in
Abrines
*NL*
I
could
do
the
criada
the
room
looks
all
right
since
I
changed
it
the
*NL*
other
way
you
see
something
was
telling
me
all
the
time
Id
have
to
*NL*
introduce
myself
not
knowing
me
from
Adam
very
funny
wouldnt
it
Im
his
*NL*
wife
or
pretend
we
were
in
Spain
with
him
half
awake
without
a
Gods
*NL*
notion
where
he
is
dos
huevos
estrellados
senor
Lord
the
cracked
things
*NL*
come
into
my
head
sometimes
itd
be
great
fun
supposing
he
stayed
with
us
*NL*
why
not
theres
the
room
upstairs
empty
and
Millys
bed
in
the
back
room
*NL*
he
could
do
his
writing
and
studies
at
the
table
in
there
for
all
the
*NL*
scribbling
he
does
at
it
and
if
he
wants
to
read
in
bed
in
the
morning
*NL*
like
me
as
hes
making
the
breakfast
for
I
he
can
make
it
for
2
Im
sure
*NL*
Im
not
going
to
take
in
lodgers
off
the
street
for
him
if
he
takes
*NL*
a
gesabo
of
a
house
like
this
Id
love
to
have
a
long
talk
with
an
*NL*
intelligent
welleducated
person
Id
have
to
get
a
nice
pair
of
red
*NL*
slippers
like
those
Turks
with
the
fez
used
to
sell
or
yellow
and
a
*NL*
nice
semitransparent
morning
gown
that
I
badly
want
or
a
peachblossom
*NL*
dressing
jacket
like
the
one

ago

or
18/6
Ill
*NL*
just
give
him
one
more
chance
Ill
get
up
early
in
the
morning
Im
sick
of
*NL*
Cohens
old
bed
in
any
case
I
might
go
over
to
the
markets
to
see
all
*NL*
the
vegetables
and
cabbages
and
tomatoes
and
carrots
and
all
kinds
of
*NL*
splendid
fruits
all
coming
in
lovely
and
fresh
who
knows
whod
be
the
1st
*NL*
man
Id
meet
theyre
out
looking
for
it
in
the
morning
Mamy
Dillon
used
*NL*
to
say
they
are
and
the
night
too
that
was
her
massgoing
Id
love
a
*NL*
big
juicy
pear
now
to
melt
in
your
mouth
like
when
I
used
to
be
in
the
*NL*
longing
way
then
Ill
throw
him
up
his
eggs
and
tea
in
the
moustachecup
*NL*
she
gave
him
to
make
his
mouth
bigger
I
suppose
hed
like
my
nice
cream
*NL*
too
I
know
what
Ill
do
Ill
go
about
rather
gay
not
too
much
singing
a
*NL*
bit
now
and
then
mi
fa
pieta
Masetto
then
Ill
start
dressing
myself
to
*NL*
go
out
presto
non
son
piu
forte
Ill
put
on
my
best
shift
and
drawers
let
*NL*
him
have
a
good
eyeful
out
of
that
to
make
his
micky
stand
for
him
Ill
*NL*
let
him
know
if
thats
what
he
wanted
that
his
wife
is
I
s
l
o
fucked
yes
*NL*
and
damn
well
fucked
too
up
to
my
neck
nearly
not
by
him
5
or
6
times
*NL*
handrunning
theres
the
mark
of
his
spunk
on
the
clean
sheet
I
wouldnt
*NL*
bother
to
even
iron
it
out
that
ought
to
satisfy
him
if
you
dont
believe
*NL*
me
feel
my
belly
unless
I
made
him
stand
there
and
put
him
into
me
Ive
a
*NL*
mind
to
tell
him
every
scrap
and
make
him
do
it
out
in
front
of
me
serve
*NL*
him
right
its
all
his
own
fault
if
I
am
an
adulteress
as
the
thing
in
*NL*
the
gallery
said
O
much
about
it
if
thats
all
the
harm
ever
we
did
in
*NL*
this
vale
of
tears
God
knows
its
not
much
doesnt
everybody
only
they
*NL*
hide
it
I
suppose
thats
what
a
woman
is
supposed
to
be
there
for
or
*NL*
He
wouldnt
have
made
us
the
way
He
did
so
attractive
to
men
then
if
he
*NL*
wants
to
kiss
my
bottom
Ill
drag
open
my
drawers
and
bulge
it
right
out
*NL*
in
his
face
as
large
as
life
he
can
stick
his
tongue
7
miles
up
my
hole
*NL*
as
hes
there
my
brown
part
then
Ill
tell
him
I
want
LI
or
perhaps
30
/
-
*NL*
Ill
tell
him
I
want
to
buy
underclothes
then
if
he
gives
me
that
well
he
*NL*
wont
be
too
bad
I
dont
want
to
soak
it
all
out
of
him
like
other
women
*NL*
do
I
could
often
have
written
out
a
fine
cheque
for
myself
and
write
his
*NL*
name
on
it
for
a
couple
of
pounds
a
few
times
he
forgot
to
lock
it
up
*NL*
besides
he
wont
spend
it
Ill
let
him
do
it
off
on
me
behind
provided
he
*NL*
doesnt
smear
all
my
good
drawers
O
I
suppose
that
cant
be
helped
Ill
do
*NL*
the
indifferent
l
or
2
questions
Ill
know
by
the
answers
when
hes
like
*NL*
that
he
cant
keep
a
thing
back
I
know
every
turn
in
him
Ill
tighten
my
*NL*
bottom
well
and
let
out
a
few
smutty
words
smellrump
or
lick
my
shit
or
*NL*
the
first
mad
thing
comes
into
my
head
then
Ill
suggest
about
yes
O
wait
*NL*
now
sonny
my
turn
is
coming
Ill
be
quite
gay
and
friendly
over
it
O
*NL*
but
I
was
forgetting
this
bloody
pest
of
a
thing
pfooh
you
wouldnt
know
*NL*
which
to
laugh
or
cry
were
such
a
mixture
of
plum
and
apple
no
Ill
have
*NL*
to
wear
the
old
things
so
much
the
better
itll
be
more
pointed
hell
*NL*
never
know
whether
he
did
it
or
not
there
thats
good
enough
for
you
*NL*
any
old
thing
at
all
then
Ill
wipe
him
off
me
just
like
a
business
his
*NL*
omission
then
Ill
go
out
Ill
have
him
eying
up
at
the
ceiling
where
is
*NL*
she
gone
now
make
him
want
me
thats
the
only
way
a
quarter
after
what
an
*NL*
unearthly
hour
I
suppose
theyre
just
getting
up
in
China
now
combing
out
*NL*
their
pigtails
for
the
day
well
soon
have
the
nuns

nobody

his
night

Lombard
street

much
nicer

*NL*
something

*NL*
I
want
to
do

we
can
have
music
and
cigarettes

can
accompany
him

I
*NL*
must
clean

keys
of
the
piano
with
milk

*NL*
a
white
rose
or
those
fairy
cakes
in
Liptons
I
love
the
smell
of
a
rich
*NL*
big
shop
at
7 1/2
d
a
lb
or
the
other
ones
with
the
cherries
in
them

Id
love
to
have
the
whole
place
swimming
in
*NL*
roses
God
of
heaven
theres
nothing
like
nature
the
wild
mountains
then
*NL*
the
sea
and
the
waves
rushing
then
the
beautiful
country
with
the
fields
*NL*
of
oats
and
wheat
and
all
kinds
of
things
and
all
the
fine
cattle
going
*NL*
about
that
would
do
your
heart
good
to
see
rivers
and
lakes
and
flowers
*NL*
all
sorts
of
shapes
and
smells
and
colours
springing
up
even
out
of
the
*NL*
ditches
primroses
and
violets
nature
it
is
as
for
them
saying
theres
no
*NL*
God
I
wouldnt
give
a
snap
of
my
two
fingers
for
all
their
learning
why
*NL*
dont
they
go
and
create
something
I
often
asked
him
atheists
or
whatever
*NL*
they
call
themselves
go
and
wash
the
cobbles
off
themselves
first
then
*NL*
they
go
howling
for
the
priest
and
they
dying
and
why
why
because
theyre
*NL*
afraid
of
hell
on
account
of
their
bad
conscience
ah
yes
I
know
them
*NL*
well
who
was
the
first
person
in
the
universe
before
there
was
anybody
*NL*
that
made
it
all
who
ah
that
they
dont
know
neither
do
I
so
there
you
*NL*
are
they
might
as
well
try
to
stop
the
sun
from
rising
tomorrow
the
sun
*NL*
shines
for
you
he
said
the
day
we
were
lying
among
the
rhododendrons
on
*NL*
Howth
head
in
the
grey
tweed
suit
and
his
straw
hat
the
day
I
got
him
to
*NL*
propose
to
me
yes
first
I
gave
him
the
bit
of
seedcake
out
of
my
mouth
*NL*
and
it
was
leapyear
like
now
yes
16
years
ago
my
God
after
that
long
*NL*
kiss
I
near
lost
my
breath
yes
he
said
I
was
a
flower
of
the
mountain
*NL*
yes
so
we
are
flowers
all
a
womans
body
yes
that
was
one
true
thing
he
*NL*
said
in
his
life
and
the
sun
shines
for
you
today
yes
that
was
why
I
*NL*
liked
him
because
I
saw
he
understood
or
felt
what
a
woman
is
and
I
knew
*NL*
I
could
always
get
round
him
and
I
gave
him
all
the
pleasure
I
could
*NL*
leading
him
on
till
he
asked
me
to
say
yes
and
I
wouldnt
answer
first
*NL*
only
looked
out
over
the
sea
and
the
sky
I
was
thinking
of
so
many
*NL*
things
he
didnt
know
of
Mulvey
and
Mr
Stanhope
and
Hester
and
father
and
*NL*
old
captain
Groves
and
the
sailors
playing
all
birds
fly
and
I
say
stoop
*NL*
and
washing
up
dishes
they
called
it
on
the
pier
and
the
sentry
in
front
*NL*
of
the
governors
house
with
the
thing
round
his
white
helmet
poor
devil
*NL*
half
roasted
and
the
Spanish
girls
laughing
in
their
shawls
and
their
*NL*
tall
combs
and
the
auctions
in
the
morning
the
Greeks
and
the
jews
and
*NL*
the
Arabs
and
the
devil
knows
who
else
from
all
the
ends
of
Europe
and
*NL*
Duke
street
and
the
fowl
market
all
clucking
outside
Larby
Sharons
*NL*
and
the
poor
donkeys
slipping
half
asleep
and
the
vague
fellows
in
the
*NL*
cloaks
asleep
in
the
shade
on
the
steps
and
the
big
wheels
of
the
carts
*NL*
of
the
bulls
and
the
old
castle
thousands
of
years
old
yes
and
those
*NL*
handsome
Moors
all
in
white
and
turbans
like
kings
asking
you
to
sit
*NL*
down
in
their
little
bit
of
a
shop
and
Ronda
with
the
old
windows
of
the
*NL*
posadas
2
glancing
eyes
a
lattice
hid
for
her
lover
to
kiss
the
iron
*NL*
and
the
wineshops
half
open
at
night
and
the
castanets
and
the
night
we
*NL*
missed
the
boat
at
Algeciras
the
watchman
going
about
serene
with
his
*NL*
lamp
and
O
that
awful
deepdown
torrent
O
and
the
sea
the
sea
crimson
*NL*
sometimes
like
fire
and
the
glorious
sunsets
and
the
figtrees
in
the
*NL*
Alameda
gardens
yes
and
all
the
queer
little
streets
and
the
pink
*NL*
and
blue
and
yellow
houses
and
the
rosegardens
and
the
jessamine
and
*NL*
geraniums
and
cactuses
and
Gibraltar
as
a
girl
where
I
was
a
Flower
*NL*
of
the
mountain
yes
when
I
put
the
rose
in
my
hair
like
the
Andalusian
*NL*
girls
used
or
shall
I
wear
a
red
yes
and
how
he
kissed
me
under
the
*NL*
Moorish
wall
and
I
thought
well
as
well
him
as
another
and
then
I
asked
*NL*
him
with
my
eyes
to
ask
again
yes
and
then
he
asked
me
would
I
yes
to
*NL*
say
yes
my
mountain
flower
and
first
I
put
my
arms
around
him
yes
and
*NL*
drew
him
down
to
me
so
he
could
feel
my
breasts
all
perfume
yes
and
his
*NL*
heart
was
going
like
mad
and
yes
I
said
