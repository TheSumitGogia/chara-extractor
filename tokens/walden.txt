When
I
wrote
the
following
pages
,
or
rather
the
bulk
of
them
,
I
lived
*NL*
alone
,
in
the
woods
,
a
mile
from
any
neighbor
,
in
a
house
which
I
had
*NL*
built
myself
,
on
the
shore
of
Walden
Pond
,
in
Concord
,
Massachusetts
,
*NL*
and
earned
my
living
by
the
labor
of
my
hands
only
.
I
lived
there
two
*NL*
years
and
two
months
.
At
present
I
am
a
sojourner
in
civilized
life
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
not
obtrude
my
affairs
so
much
on
the
notice
of
my
readers
if
*NL*
very
particular
inquiries
had
not
been
made
by
my
townsmen
concerning
*NL*
my
mode
of
life
,
which
some
would
call
impertinent
,
though
they
do
not
*NL*
appear
to
me
at
all
impertinent
,
but
,
considering
the
circumstances
,
*NL*
very
natural
and
pertinent
.
Some
have
asked
what
I
got
to
eat
;
if
I
did
*NL*
not
feel
lonesome
;
if
I
was
not
afraid
;
and
the
like
.
Others
have
been
*NL*
curious
to
learn
what
portion
of
my
income
I
devoted
to
charitable
*NL*
purposes
;
and
some
,
who
have
large
families
,
how
many
poor
children
*NL*
I
maintained
.
I
will
therefore
ask
those
of
my
readers
who
feel
no
*NL*
particular
interest
in
me
to
pardon
me
if
I
undertake
to
answer
some
of
*NL*
these
questions
in
this
book
.
In
most
books
,
the
_
I
_
,
or
first
person
,
is
*NL*
omitted
;
in
this
it
will
be
retained
;
that
,
in
respect
to
egotism
,
is
*NL*
the
main
difference
.
We
commonly
do
not
remember
that
it
is
,
after
all
,
*NL*
always
the
first
person
that
is
speaking
.
I
should
not
talk
so
*NL*
much
about
myself
if
there
were
anybody
else
whom
I
knew
as
well
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
I
am
confined
to
this
theme
by
the
narrowness
of
my
*NL*
experience
.
Moreover
,
I
,
on
my
side
,
require
of
every
writer
,
first
or
*NL*
last
,
a
simple
and
sincere
account
of
his
own
life
,
and
not
merely
what
*NL*
he
has
heard
of
other
men
's
lives
;
some
such
account
as
he
would
send
to
*NL*
his
kindred
from
a
distant
land
;
for
if
he
has
lived
sincerely
,
it
*NL*
must
have
been
in
a
distant
land
to
me
.
Perhaps
these
pages
are
more
*NL*
particularly
addressed
to
poor
students
.
As
for
the
rest
of
my
readers
,
*NL*
they
will
accept
such
portions
as
apply
to
them
.
I
trust
that
none
will
*NL*
stretch
the
seams
in
putting
on
the
coat
,
for
it
may
do
good
service
to
*NL*
him
whom
it
fits
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fain
say
something
,
not
so
much
concerning
the
Chinese
and
*NL*
Sandwich
Islanders
as
you
who
read
these
pages
,
who
are
said
to
live
*NL*
in
New
England
;
something
about
your
condition
,
especially
your
outward
*NL*
condition
or
circumstances
in
this
world
,
in
this
town
,
what
it
is
,
*NL*
whether
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
as
bad
as
it
is
,
whether
it
can
not
*NL*
be
improved
as
well
as
not
.
I
have
travelled
a
good
deal
in
Concord
;
*NL*
and
everywhere
,
in
shops
,
and
offices
,
and
fields
,
the
inhabitants
have
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
doing
penance
in
a
thousand
remarkable
ways
.
What
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
Bramins
sitting
exposed
to
four
fires
and
looking
in
the
*NL*
face
of
the
sun
;
or
hanging
suspended
,
with
their
heads
downward
,
over
*NL*
flames
;
or
looking
at
the
heavens
over
their
shoulders
``
until
it
becomes
*NL*
impossible
for
them
to
resume
their
natural
position
,
while
from
the
*NL*
twist
of
the
neck
nothing
but
liquids
can
pass
into
the
stomach
''
;
or
*NL*
dwelling
,
chained
for
life
,
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
;
or
measuring
with
*NL*
their
bodies
,
like
caterpillars
,
the
breadth
of
vast
empires
;
or
*NL*
standing
on
one
leg
on
the
tops
of
pillars
--
even
these
forms
of
*NL*
conscious
penance
are
hardly
more
incredible
and
astonishing
than
*NL*
the
scenes
which
I
daily
witness
.
The
twelve
labors
of
Hercules
were
*NL*
trifling
in
comparison
with
those
which
my
neighbors
have
undertaken
;
*NL*
for
they
were
only
twelve
,
and
had
an
end
;
but
I
could
never
see
that
*NL*
these
men
slew
or
captured
any
monster
or
finished
any
labor
.
They
have
*NL*
no
friend
Iolaus
to
burn
with
a
hot
iron
the
root
of
the
hydra
's
head
,
*NL*
but
as
soon
as
one
head
is
crushed
,
two
spring
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
young
men
,
my
townsmen
,
whose
misfortune
it
is
to
have
inherited
*NL*
farms
,
houses
,
barns
,
cattle
,
and
farming
tools
;
for
these
are
more
*NL*
easily
acquired
than
got
rid
of
.
Better
if
they
had
been
born
in
the
*NL*
open
pasture
and
suckled
by
a
wolf
,
that
they
might
have
seen
with
*NL*
clearer
eyes
what
field
they
were
called
to
labor
in
.
Who
made
them
*NL*
serfs
of
the
soil
?
Why
should
they
eat
their
sixty
acres
,
when
man
is
*NL*
condemned
to
eat
only
his
peck
of
dirt
?
Why
should
they
begin
digging
*NL*
their
graves
as
soon
as
they
are
born
?
They
have
got
to
live
a
man
's
*NL*
life
,
pushing
all
these
things
before
them
,
and
get
on
as
well
as
they
*NL*
can
.
How
many
a
poor
immortal
soul
have
I
met
well-nigh
crushed
and
*NL*
smothered
under
its
load
,
creeping
down
the
road
of
life
,
pushing
before
*NL*
it
a
barn
seventy-five
feet
by
forty
,
its
Augean
stables
never
cleansed
,
*NL*
and
one
hundred
acres
of
land
,
tillage
,
mowing
,
pasture
,
and
woodlot
!
*NL*
The
portionless
,
who
struggle
with
no
such
unnecessary
inherited
*NL*
encumbrances
,
find
it
labor
enough
to
subdue
and
cultivate
a
few
cubic
*NL*
feet
of
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
men
labor
under
a
mistake
.
The
better
part
of
the
man
is
soon
plowed
*NL*
into
the
soil
for
compost
.
By
a
seeming
fate
,
commonly
called
necessity
,
*NL*
they
are
employed
,
as
it
says
in
an
old
book
,
laying
up
treasures
which
*NL*
moth
and
rust
will
corrupt
and
thieves
break
through
and
steal
.
It
is
*NL*
a
fool
's
life
,
as
they
will
find
when
they
get
to
the
end
of
it
,
if
not
*NL*
before
.
It
is
said
that
Deucalion
and
Pyrrha
created
men
by
throwing
*NL*
stones
over
their
heads
behind
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Inde
genus
durum
sumus
,
experiensque
laborum
,
*NL*
Et
documenta
damus
qua
simus
origine
nati
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
,
as
Raleigh
rhymes
it
in
his
sonorous
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
thence
our
kind
hard-hearted
is
,
enduring
pain
and
care
,
*NL*
Approving
that
our
bodies
of
a
stony
nature
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
for
a
blind
obedience
to
a
blundering
oracle
,
throwing
the
*NL*
stones
over
their
heads
behind
them
,
and
not
seeing
where
they
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
men
,
even
in
this
comparatively
free
country
,
through
mere
*NL*
ignorance
and
mistake
,
are
so
occupied
with
the
factitious
cares
and
*NL*
superfluously
coarse
labors
of
life
that
its
finer
fruits
can
not
be
*NL*
plucked
by
them
.
Their
fingers
,
from
excessive
toil
,
are
too
clumsy
and
*NL*
tremble
too
much
for
that
.
Actually
,
the
laboring
man
has
not
leisure
*NL*
for
a
true
integrity
day
by
day
;
he
can
not
afford
to
sustain
the
*NL*
manliest
relations
to
men
;
his
labor
would
be
depreciated
in
the
market
.
*NL*
He
has
no
time
to
be
anything
but
a
machine
.
How
can
he
remember
well
*NL*
his
ignorance
--
which
his
growth
requires
--
who
has
so
often
to
use
his
*NL*
knowledge
?
We
should
feed
and
clothe
him
gratuitously
sometimes
,
and
*NL*
recruit
him
with
our
cordials
,
before
we
judge
of
him
.
The
finest
*NL*
qualities
of
our
nature
,
like
the
bloom
on
fruits
,
can
be
preserved
only
*NL*
by
the
most
delicate
handling
.
Yet
we
do
not
treat
ourselves
nor
one
*NL*
another
thus
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
you
,
we
all
know
,
are
poor
,
find
it
hard
to
live
,
are
sometimes
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
gasping
for
breath
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
some
of
you
who
*NL*
read
this
book
are
unable
to
pay
for
all
the
dinners
which
you
have
*NL*
actually
eaten
,
or
for
the
coats
and
shoes
which
are
fast
wearing
or
are
*NL*
already
worn
out
,
and
have
come
to
this
page
to
spend
borrowed
or
stolen
*NL*
time
,
robbing
your
creditors
of
an
hour
.
It
is
very
evident
what
mean
*NL*
and
sneaking
lives
many
of
you
live
,
for
my
sight
has
been
whetted
by
*NL*
experience
;
always
on
the
limits
,
trying
to
get
into
business
and
trying
*NL*
to
get
out
of
debt
,
a
very
ancient
slough
,
called
by
the
Latins
_
aes
*NL*
alienum
_
,
another
's
brass
,
for
some
of
their
coins
were
made
of
brass
;
*NL*
still
living
,
and
dying
,
and
buried
by
this
other
's
brass
;
always
*NL*
promising
to
pay
,
promising
to
pay
,
tomorrow
,
and
dying
today
,
*NL*
insolvent
;
seeking
to
curry
favor
,
to
get
custom
,
by
how
many
modes
,
*NL*
only
not
state-prison
offenses
;
lying
,
flattering
,
voting
,
contracting
*NL*
yourselves
into
a
nutshell
of
civility
or
dilating
into
an
atmosphere
of
*NL*
thin
and
vaporous
generosity
,
that
you
may
persuade
your
neighbor
to
let
*NL*
you
make
his
shoes
,
or
his
hat
,
or
his
coat
,
or
his
carriage
,
or
import
*NL*
his
groceries
for
him
;
making
yourselves
sick
,
that
you
may
lay
up
*NL*
something
against
a
sick
day
,
something
to
be
tucked
away
in
an
old
*NL*
chest
,
or
in
a
stocking
behind
the
plastering
,
or
,
more
safely
,
in
the
*NL*
brick
bank
;
no
matter
where
,
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sometimes
wonder
that
we
can
be
so
frivolous
,
I
may
almost
say
,
as
to
*NL*
attend
to
the
gross
but
somewhat
foreign
form
of
servitude
called
Negro
*NL*
Slavery
,
there
are
so
many
keen
and
subtle
masters
that
enslave
both
*NL*
North
and
South
.
It
is
hard
to
have
a
Southern
overseer
;
it
is
worse
to
*NL*
have
a
Northern
one
;
but
worst
of
all
when
you
are
the
slave-driver
*NL*
of
yourself
.
Talk
of
a
divinity
in
man
!
Look
at
the
teamster
on
the
*NL*
highway
,
wending
to
market
by
day
or
night
;
does
any
divinity
stir
*NL*
within
him
?
His
highest
duty
to
fodder
and
water
his
horses
!
What
is
his
*NL*
destiny
to
him
compared
with
the
shipping
interests
?
Does
not
he
drive
*NL*
for
Squire
Make-a-stir
?
How
godlike
,
how
immortal
,
is
he
?
See
how
he
*NL*
cowers
and
sneaks
,
how
vaguely
all
the
day
he
fears
,
not
being
immortal
*NL*
nor
divine
,
but
the
slave
and
prisoner
of
his
own
opinion
of
himself
,
a
*NL*
fame
won
by
his
own
deeds
.
Public
opinion
is
a
weak
tyrant
compared
with
*NL*
our
own
private
opinion
.
What
a
man
thinks
of
himself
,
that
it
is
which
*NL*
determines
,
or
rather
indicates
,
his
fate
.
Self-emancipation
even
in
the
*NL*
West
Indian
provinces
of
the
fancy
and
imagination
--
what
Wilberforce
*NL*
is
there
to
bring
that
about
?
Think
,
also
,
of
the
ladies
of
the
land
*NL*
weaving
toilet
cushions
against
the
last
day
,
not
to
betray
too
green
*NL*
an
interest
in
their
fates
!
As
if
you
could
kill
time
without
injuring
*NL*
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mass
of
men
lead
lives
of
quiet
desperation
.
What
is
called
*NL*
resignation
is
confirmed
desperation
.
From
the
desperate
city
you
*NL*
go
into
the
desperate
country
,
and
have
to
console
yourself
with
the
*NL*
bravery
of
minks
and
muskrats
.
A
stereotyped
but
unconscious
despair
*NL*
is
concealed
even
under
what
are
called
the
games
and
amusements
of
*NL*
mankind
.
There
is
no
play
in
them
,
for
this
comes
after
work
.
But
it
is
*NL*
a
characteristic
of
wisdom
not
to
do
desperate
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
consider
what
,
to
use
the
words
of
the
catechism
,
is
the
chief
*NL*
end
of
man
,
and
what
are
the
true
necessaries
and
means
of
life
,
it
*NL*
appears
as
if
men
had
deliberately
chosen
the
common
mode
of
living
*NL*
because
they
preferred
it
to
any
other
.
Yet
they
honestly
think
there
is
*NL*
no
choice
left
.
But
alert
and
healthy
natures
remember
that
the
sun
*NL*
rose
clear
.
It
is
never
too
late
to
give
up
our
prejudices
.
No
way
of
*NL*
thinking
or
doing
,
however
ancient
,
can
be
trusted
without
proof
.
What
*NL*
everybody
echoes
or
in
silence
passes
by
as
true
to-day
may
turn
out
to
*NL*
be
falsehood
to-morrow
,
mere
smoke
of
opinion
,
which
some
had
trusted
*NL*
for
a
cloud
that
would
sprinkle
fertilizing
rain
on
their
fields
.
What
*NL*
old
people
say
you
can
not
do
,
you
try
and
find
that
you
can
.
Old
deeds
*NL*
for
old
people
,
and
new
deeds
for
new
.
Old
people
did
not
know
enough
*NL*
once
,
perchance
,
to
fetch
fresh
fuel
to
keep
the
fire
a-going
;
new
*NL*
people
put
a
little
dry
wood
under
a
pot
,
and
are
whirled
round
the
*NL*
globe
with
the
speed
of
birds
,
in
a
way
to
kill
old
people
,
as
the
*NL*
phrase
is
.
Age
is
no
better
,
hardly
so
well
,
qualified
for
an
instructor
*NL*
as
youth
,
for
it
has
not
profited
so
much
as
it
has
lost
.
One
may
*NL*
almost
doubt
if
the
wisest
man
has
learned
anything
of
absolute
value
by
*NL*
living
.
Practically
,
the
old
have
no
very
important
advice
to
give
the
*NL*
young
,
their
own
experience
has
been
so
partial
,
and
their
lives
have
*NL*
been
such
miserable
failures
,
for
private
reasons
,
as
they
must
*NL*
believe
;
and
it
may
be
that
they
have
some
faith
left
which
belies
that
*NL*
experience
,
and
they
are
only
less
young
than
they
were
.
I
have
lived
*NL*
some
thirty
years
on
this
planet
,
and
I
have
yet
to
hear
the
first
*NL*
syllable
of
valuable
or
even
earnest
advice
from
my
seniors
.
They
have
*NL*
told
me
nothing
,
and
probably
can
not
tell
me
anything
to
the
purpose
.
*NL*
Here
is
life
,
an
experiment
to
a
great
extent
untried
by
me
;
but
it
does
*NL*
not
avail
me
that
they
have
tried
it
.
If
I
have
any
experience
which
I
*NL*
think
valuable
,
I
am
sure
to
reflect
that
this
my
Mentors
said
nothing
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
farmer
says
to
me
,
``
You
can
not
live
on
vegetable
food
solely
,
for
it
*NL*
furnishes
nothing
to
make
bones
with
''
;
and
so
he
religiously
devotes
a
*NL*
part
of
his
day
to
supplying
his
system
with
the
raw
material
of
*NL*
bones
;
walking
all
the
while
he
talks
behind
his
oxen
,
which
,
with
*NL*
vegetable-made
bones
,
jerk
him
and
his
lumbering
plow
along
in
spite
*NL*
of
every
obstacle
.
Some
things
are
really
necessaries
of
life
in
some
*NL*
circles
,
the
most
helpless
and
diseased
,
which
in
others
are
luxuries
*NL*
merely
,
and
in
others
still
are
entirely
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
ground
of
human
life
seems
to
some
to
have
been
gone
over
by
*NL*
their
predecessors
,
both
the
heights
and
the
valleys
,
and
all
things
to
*NL*
have
been
cared
for
.
According
to
Evelyn
,
``
the
wise
Solomon
prescribed
*NL*
ordinances
for
the
very
distances
of
trees
;
and
the
Roman
prA
|
tors
have
*NL*
decided
how
often
you
may
go
into
your
neighbor
's
land
to
gather
the
*NL*
acorns
which
fall
on
it
without
trespass
,
and
what
share
belongs
to
that
*NL*
neighbor
.
''
Hippocrates
has
even
left
directions
how
we
should
cut
our
*NL*
nails
;
that
is
,
even
with
the
ends
of
the
fingers
,
neither
shorter
nor
*NL*
longer
.
Undoubtedly
the
very
tedium
and
ennui
which
presume
to
have
*NL*
exhausted
the
variety
and
the
joys
of
life
are
as
old
as
Adam
.
But
man
's
*NL*
capacities
have
never
been
measured
;
nor
are
we
to
judge
of
what
he
can
*NL*
do
by
any
precedents
,
so
little
has
been
tried
.
Whatever
have
been
thy
*NL*
failures
hitherto
,
``
be
not
afflicted
,
my
child
,
for
who
shall
assign
to
*NL*
thee
what
thou
hast
left
undone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
try
our
lives
by
a
thousand
simple
tests
;
as
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
that
the
same
sun
which
ripens
my
beans
illumines
at
once
a
system
of
*NL*
earths
like
ours
.
If
I
had
remembered
this
it
would
have
prevented
some
*NL*
mistakes
.
This
was
not
the
light
in
which
I
hoed
them
.
The
stars
are
the
*NL*
apexes
of
what
wonderful
triangles
!
What
distant
and
different
beings
in
*NL*
the
various
mansions
of
the
universe
are
contemplating
the
same
one
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
!
Nature
and
human
life
are
as
various
as
our
several
*NL*
constitutions
.
Who
shall
say
what
prospect
life
offers
to
another
?
Could
*NL*
a
greater
miracle
take
place
than
for
us
to
look
through
each
other
's
*NL*
eyes
for
an
instant
?
We
should
live
in
all
the
ages
of
the
world
in
an
*NL*
hour
;
ay
,
in
all
the
worlds
of
the
ages
.
History
,
Poetry
,
Mythology
!
--
I
*NL*
know
of
no
reading
of
another
's
experience
so
startling
and
informing
as
*NL*
this
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
what
my
neighbors
call
good
I
believe
in
my
soul
*NL*
to
be
bad
,
and
if
I
repent
of
anything
,
it
is
very
likely
to
be
my
good
*NL*
behavior
.
What
demon
possessed
me
that
I
behaved
so
well
?
You
may
say
*NL*
the
wisest
thing
you
can
,
old
man
--
you
who
have
lived
seventy
years
,
not
*NL*
without
honor
of
a
kind
--
I
hear
an
irresistible
voice
which
invites
me
*NL*
away
from
all
that
.
One
generation
abandons
the
enterprises
of
another
*NL*
like
stranded
vessels
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
we
may
safely
trust
a
good
deal
more
than
we
do
.
We
may
*NL*
waive
just
so
much
care
of
ourselves
as
we
honestly
bestow
elsewhere
.
*NL*
Nature
is
as
well
adapted
to
our
weakness
as
to
our
strength
.
The
*NL*
incessant
anxiety
and
strain
of
some
is
a
well-nigh
incurable
form
of
*NL*
disease
.
We
are
made
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
what
work
we
do
;
*NL*
and
yet
how
much
is
not
done
by
us
!
or
,
what
if
we
had
been
taken
sick
?
*NL*
How
vigilant
we
are
!
determined
not
to
live
by
faith
if
we
can
avoid
it
;
*NL*
all
the
day
long
on
the
alert
,
at
night
we
unwillingly
say
our
prayers
*NL*
and
commit
ourselves
to
uncertainties
.
So
thoroughly
and
sincerely
are
*NL*
we
compelled
to
live
,
reverencing
our
life
,
and
denying
the
possibility
*NL*
of
change
.
This
is
the
only
way
,
we
say
;
but
there
are
as
many
ways
as
*NL*
there
can
be
drawn
radii
from
one
centre
.
All
change
is
a
miracle
to
*NL*
contemplate
;
but
it
is
a
miracle
which
is
taking
place
every
instant
.
*NL*
Confucius
said
,
``
To
know
that
we
know
what
we
know
,
and
that
we
do
not
*NL*
know
what
we
do
not
know
,
that
is
true
knowledge
.
''
When
one
man
has
*NL*
reduced
a
fact
of
the
imagination
to
be
a
fact
to
his
understanding
,
I
*NL*
foresee
that
all
men
at
length
establish
their
lives
on
that
basis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
consider
for
a
moment
what
most
of
the
trouble
and
anxiety
which
*NL*
I
have
referred
to
is
about
,
and
how
much
it
is
necessary
that
we
be
*NL*
troubled
,
or
at
least
careful
.
It
would
be
some
advantage
to
live
*NL*
a
primitive
and
frontier
life
,
though
in
the
midst
of
an
outward
*NL*
civilization
,
if
only
to
learn
what
are
the
gross
necessaries
of
life
*NL*
and
what
methods
have
been
taken
to
obtain
them
;
or
even
to
look
over
*NL*
the
old
day-books
of
the
merchants
,
to
see
what
it
was
that
men
most
*NL*
commonly
bought
at
the
stores
,
what
they
stored
,
that
is
,
what
are
the
*NL*
grossest
groceries
.
For
the
improvements
of
ages
have
had
but
little
*NL*
influence
on
the
essential
laws
of
man
's
existence
;
as
our
skeletons
,
*NL*
probably
,
are
not
to
be
distinguished
from
those
of
our
ancestors
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
words
,
_
necessary
of
life
_
,
I
mean
whatever
,
of
all
that
man
*NL*
obtains
by
his
own
exertions
,
has
been
from
the
first
,
or
from
long
use
*NL*
has
become
,
so
important
to
human
life
that
few
,
if
any
,
whether
from
*NL*
savageness
,
or
poverty
,
or
philosophy
,
ever
attempt
to
do
without
it
.
To
*NL*
many
creatures
there
is
in
this
sense
but
one
necessary
of
life
,
Food
.
*NL*
To
the
bison
of
the
prairie
it
is
a
few
inches
of
palatable
grass
,
*NL*
with
water
to
drink
;
unless
he
seeks
the
Shelter
of
the
forest
or
the
*NL*
mountain
's
shadow
.
None
of
the
brute
creation
requires
more
than
Food
*NL*
and
Shelter
.
The
necessaries
of
life
for
man
in
this
climate
may
,
*NL*
accurately
enough
,
be
distributed
under
the
several
heads
of
Food
,
*NL*
Shelter
,
Clothing
,
and
Fuel
;
for
not
till
we
have
secured
these
are
*NL*
we
prepared
to
entertain
the
true
problems
of
life
with
freedom
and
a
*NL*
prospect
of
success
.
Man
has
invented
,
not
only
houses
,
but
clothes
and
*NL*
cooked
food
;
and
possibly
from
the
accidental
discovery
of
the
warmth
of
*NL*
fire
,
and
the
consequent
use
of
it
,
at
first
a
luxury
,
arose
the
present
*NL*
necessity
to
sit
by
it
.
We
observe
cats
and
dogs
acquiring
the
same
*NL*
second
nature
.
By
proper
Shelter
and
Clothing
we
legitimately
retain
*NL*
our
own
internal
heat
;
but
with
an
excess
of
these
,
or
of
Fuel
,
that
*NL*
is
,
with
an
external
heat
greater
than
our
own
internal
,
may
not
*NL*
cookery
properly
be
said
to
begin
?
Darwin
,
the
naturalist
,
says
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Tierra
del
Fuego
,
that
while
his
own
party
,
who
were
well
*NL*
clothed
and
sitting
close
to
a
fire
,
were
far
from
too
warm
,
these
naked
*NL*
savages
,
who
were
farther
off
,
were
observed
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
``
to
*NL*
be
streaming
with
perspiration
at
undergoing
such
a
roasting
.
''
So
,
we
*NL*
are
told
,
the
New
Hollander
goes
naked
with
impunity
,
while
the
European
*NL*
shivers
in
his
clothes
.
Is
it
impossible
to
combine
the
hardiness
of
*NL*
these
savages
with
the
intellectualness
of
the
civilized
man
?
According
*NL*
to
Liebig
,
man
's
body
is
a
stove
,
and
food
the
fuel
which
keeps
up
the
*NL*
internal
combustion
in
the
lungs
.
In
cold
weather
we
eat
more
,
in
warm
*NL*
less
.
The
animal
heat
is
the
result
of
a
slow
combustion
,
and
disease
*NL*
and
death
take
place
when
this
is
too
rapid
;
or
for
want
of
fuel
,
or
*NL*
from
some
defect
in
the
draught
,
the
fire
goes
out
.
Of
course
the
vital
*NL*
heat
is
not
to
be
confounded
with
fire
;
but
so
much
for
analogy
.
It
*NL*
appears
,
therefore
,
from
the
above
list
,
that
the
expression
,
_
animal
*NL*
life
_
,
is
nearly
synonymous
with
the
expression
,
_
animal
heat
_
;
for
while
*NL*
Food
may
be
regarded
as
the
Fuel
which
keeps
up
the
fire
within
us
--
and
*NL*
Fuel
serves
only
to
prepare
that
Food
or
to
increase
the
warmth
of
our
*NL*
bodies
by
addition
from
without
--
Shelter
and
Clothing
also
serve
only
to
*NL*
retain
the
heat
thus
generated
and
absorbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grand
necessity
,
then
,
for
our
bodies
,
is
to
keep
warm
,
to
keep
*NL*
the
vital
heat
in
us
.
What
pains
we
accordingly
take
,
not
only
with
*NL*
our
Food
,
and
Clothing
,
and
Shelter
,
but
with
our
beds
,
which
are
our
*NL*
night-clothes
,
robbing
the
nests
and
breasts
of
birds
to
prepare
this
*NL*
shelter
within
a
shelter
,
as
the
mole
has
its
bed
of
grass
and
leaves
at
*NL*
the
end
of
its
burrow
!
The
poor
man
is
wont
to
complain
that
this
is
a
*NL*
cold
world
;
and
to
cold
,
no
less
physical
than
social
,
we
refer
directly
*NL*
a
great
part
of
our
ails
.
The
summer
,
in
some
climates
,
makes
possible
*NL*
to
man
a
sort
of
Elysian
life
.
Fuel
,
except
to
cook
his
Food
,
is
*NL*
then
unnecessary
;
the
sun
is
his
fire
,
and
many
of
the
fruits
are
*NL*
sufficiently
cooked
by
its
rays
;
while
Food
generally
is
more
various
,
*NL*
and
more
easily
obtained
,
and
Clothing
and
Shelter
are
wholly
or
half
*NL*
unnecessary
.
At
the
present
day
,
and
in
this
country
,
as
I
find
by
*NL*
my
own
experience
,
a
few
implements
,
a
knife
,
an
axe
,
a
spade
,
a
*NL*
wheelbarrow
,
etc.
,
and
for
the
studious
,
lamplight
,
stationery
,
and
*NL*
access
to
a
few
books
,
rank
next
to
necessaries
,
and
can
all
be
obtained
*NL*
at
a
trifling
cost
.
Yet
some
,
not
wise
,
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
globe
,
to
barbarous
and
unhealthy
regions
,
and
devote
themselves
to
*NL*
trade
for
ten
or
twenty
years
,
in
order
that
they
may
live
--
that
is
,
*NL*
keep
comfortably
warm
--
and
die
in
New
England
at
last
.
The
luxuriously
*NL*
rich
are
not
simply
kept
comfortably
warm
,
but
unnaturally
hot
;
as
I
*NL*
implied
before
,
they
are
cooked
,
of
course
_
A
la
mode
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
luxuries
,
and
many
of
the
so-called
comforts
of
life
,
are
*NL*
not
only
not
indispensable
,
but
positive
hindrances
to
the
elevation
*NL*
of
mankind
.
With
respect
to
luxuries
and
comforts
,
the
wisest
have
*NL*
ever
lived
a
more
simple
and
meagre
life
than
the
poor
.
The
ancient
*NL*
philosophers
,
Chinese
,
Hindoo
,
Persian
,
and
Greek
,
were
a
class
than
*NL*
which
none
has
been
poorer
in
outward
riches
,
none
so
rich
in
inward
.
We
*NL*
know
not
much
about
them
.
It
is
remarkable
that
we
know
so
much
of
them
*NL*
as
we
do
.
The
same
is
true
of
the
more
modern
reformers
and
benefactors
*NL*
of
their
race
.
None
can
be
an
impartial
or
wise
observer
of
human
life
*NL*
but
from
the
vantage
ground
of
what
we
should
call
voluntary
poverty
.
*NL*
Of
a
life
of
luxury
the
fruit
is
luxury
,
whether
in
agriculture
,
or
*NL*
commerce
,
or
literature
,
or
art
.
There
are
nowadays
professors
of
*NL*
philosophy
,
but
not
philosophers
.
Yet
it
is
admirable
to
profess
because
*NL*
it
was
once
admirable
to
live
.
To
be
a
philosopher
is
not
merely
to
have
*NL*
subtle
thoughts
,
nor
even
to
found
a
school
,
but
so
to
love
wisdom
as
*NL*
to
live
according
to
its
dictates
,
a
life
of
simplicity
,
independence
,
*NL*
magnanimity
,
and
trust
.
It
is
to
solve
some
of
the
problems
of
life
,
not
*NL*
only
theoretically
,
but
practically
.
The
success
of
great
scholars
and
*NL*
thinkers
is
commonly
a
courtier-like
success
,
not
kingly
,
not
manly
.
*NL*
They
make
shift
to
live
merely
by
conformity
,
practically
as
their
*NL*
fathers
did
,
and
are
in
no
sense
the
progenitors
of
a
noble
race
of
men
.
*NL*
But
why
do
men
degenerate
ever
?
What
makes
families
run
out
?
What
is
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
luxury
which
enervates
and
destroys
nations
?
Are
we
sure
*NL*
that
there
is
none
of
it
in
our
own
lives
?
The
philosopher
is
in
*NL*
advance
of
his
age
even
in
the
outward
form
of
his
life
.
He
is
not
fed
,
*NL*
sheltered
,
clothed
,
warmed
,
like
his
contemporaries
.
How
can
a
man
be
a
*NL*
philosopher
and
not
maintain
his
vital
heat
by
better
methods
than
other
*NL*
men
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
is
warmed
by
the
several
modes
which
I
have
described
,
what
*NL*
does
he
want
next
?
Surely
not
more
warmth
of
the
same
kind
,
as
more
and
*NL*
richer
food
,
larger
and
more
splendid
houses
,
finer
and
more
abundant
*NL*
clothing
,
more
numerous
,
incessant
,
and
hotter
fires
,
and
the
like
.
*NL*
When
he
has
obtained
those
things
which
are
necessary
to
life
,
there
is
*NL*
another
alternative
than
to
obtain
the
superfluities
;
and
that
is
,
to
*NL*
adventure
on
life
now
,
his
vacation
from
humbler
toil
having
commenced
.
*NL*
The
soil
,
it
appears
,
is
suited
to
the
seed
,
for
it
has
sent
its
radicle
*NL*
downward
,
and
it
may
now
send
its
shoot
upward
also
with
confidence
.
Why
*NL*
has
man
rooted
himself
thus
firmly
in
the
earth
,
but
that
he
may
rise
in
*NL*
the
same
proportion
into
the
heavens
above
?
--
for
the
nobler
plants
are
*NL*
valued
for
the
fruit
they
bear
at
last
in
the
air
and
light
,
far
from
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
are
not
treated
like
the
humbler
esculents
,
which
,
*NL*
though
they
may
be
biennials
,
are
cultivated
only
till
they
have
*NL*
perfected
their
root
,
and
often
cut
down
at
top
for
this
purpose
,
so
*NL*
that
most
would
not
know
them
in
their
flowering
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
mean
to
prescribe
rules
to
strong
and
valiant
natures
,
who
will
*NL*
mind
their
own
affairs
whether
in
heaven
or
hell
,
and
perchance
build
*NL*
more
magnificently
and
spend
more
lavishly
than
the
richest
,
without
*NL*
ever
impoverishing
themselves
,
not
knowing
how
they
live
--
if
,
indeed
,
*NL*
there
are
any
such
,
as
has
been
dreamed
;
nor
to
those
who
find
their
*NL*
encouragement
and
inspiration
in
precisely
the
present
condition
of
*NL*
things
,
and
cherish
it
with
the
fondness
and
enthusiasm
of
lovers
--
and
,
*NL*
to
some
extent
,
I
reckon
myself
in
this
number
;
I
do
not
speak
to
those
*NL*
who
are
well
employed
,
in
whatever
circumstances
,
and
they
know
whether
*NL*
they
are
well
employed
or
not
;
--
but
mainly
to
the
mass
of
men
who
are
*NL*
discontented
,
and
idly
complaining
of
the
hardness
of
their
lot
or
of
*NL*
the
times
,
when
they
might
improve
them
.
There
are
some
who
complain
*NL*
most
energetically
and
inconsolably
of
any
,
because
they
are
,
as
they
*NL*
say
,
doing
their
duty
.
I
also
have
in
my
mind
that
seemingly
wealthy
,
*NL*
but
most
terribly
impoverished
class
of
all
,
who
have
accumulated
dross
,
*NL*
but
know
not
how
to
use
it
,
or
get
rid
of
it
,
and
thus
have
forged
their
*NL*
own
golden
or
silver
fetters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
should
attempt
to
tell
how
I
have
desired
to
spend
my
life
in
years
*NL*
past
,
it
would
probably
surprise
those
of
my
readers
who
are
somewhat
*NL*
acquainted
with
its
actual
history
;
it
would
certainly
astonish
those
*NL*
who
know
nothing
about
it
.
I
will
only
hint
at
some
of
the
enterprises
*NL*
which
I
have
cherished
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
weather
,
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
I
have
been
anxious
to
*NL*
improve
the
nick
of
time
,
and
notch
it
on
my
stick
too
;
to
stand
on
the
*NL*
meeting
of
two
eternities
,
the
past
and
future
,
which
is
precisely
the
*NL*
present
moment
;
to
toe
that
line
.
You
will
pardon
some
obscurities
,
*NL*
for
there
are
more
secrets
in
my
trade
than
in
most
men
's
,
and
yet
not
*NL*
voluntarily
kept
,
but
inseparable
from
its
very
nature
.
I
would
gladly
*NL*
tell
all
that
I
know
about
it
,
and
never
paint
``
No
Admittance
''
on
my
*NL*
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
long
ago
lost
a
hound
,
a
bay
horse
,
and
a
turtle
dove
,
and
am
still
*NL*
on
their
trail
.
Many
are
the
travellers
I
have
spoken
concerning
them
,
*NL*
describing
their
tracks
and
what
calls
they
answered
to
.
I
have
met
one
*NL*
or
two
who
had
heard
the
hound
,
and
the
tramp
of
the
horse
,
and
even
*NL*
seen
the
dove
disappear
behind
a
cloud
,
and
they
seemed
as
anxious
to
*NL*
recover
them
as
if
they
had
lost
them
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
anticipate
,
not
the
sunrise
and
the
dawn
merely
,
but
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
Nature
herself
!
How
many
mornings
,
summer
and
winter
,
before
yet
any
*NL*
neighbor
was
stirring
about
his
business
,
have
I
been
about
mine
!
No
*NL*
doubt
,
many
of
my
townsmen
have
met
me
returning
from
this
enterprise
,
*NL*
farmers
starting
for
Boston
in
the
twilight
,
or
woodchoppers
going
*NL*
to
their
work
.
It
is
true
,
I
never
assisted
the
sun
materially
in
his
*NL*
rising
,
but
,
doubt
not
,
it
was
of
the
last
importance
only
to
be
present
*NL*
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
many
autumn
,
ay
,
and
winter
days
,
spent
outside
the
town
,
trying
to
*NL*
hear
what
was
in
the
wind
,
to
hear
and
carry
it
express
!
I
well-nigh
*NL*
sunk
all
my
capital
in
it
,
and
lost
my
own
breath
into
the
bargain
,
*NL*
running
in
the
face
of
it
.
If
it
had
concerned
either
of
the
political
*NL*
parties
,
depend
upon
it
,
it
would
have
appeared
in
the
Gazette
with
the
*NL*
earliest
intelligence
.
At
other
times
watching
from
the
observatory
of
*NL*
some
cliff
or
tree
,
to
telegraph
any
new
arrival
;
or
waiting
at
evening
*NL*
on
the
hill-tops
for
the
sky
to
fall
,
that
I
might
catch
something
,
*NL*
though
I
never
caught
much
,
and
that
,
manna-wise
,
would
dissolve
again
*NL*
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
I
was
reporter
to
a
journal
,
of
no
very
wide
*NL*
circulation
,
whose
editor
has
never
yet
seen
fit
to
print
the
bulk
of
my
*NL*
contributions
,
and
,
as
is
too
common
with
writers
,
I
got
only
my
labor
*NL*
for
my
pains
.
However
,
in
this
case
my
pains
were
their
own
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
years
I
was
self-appointed
inspector
of
snow-storms
and
*NL*
rain-storms
,
and
did
my
duty
faithfully
;
surveyor
,
if
not
of
highways
,
*NL*
then
of
forest
paths
and
all
across-lot
routes
,
keeping
them
open
,
and
*NL*
ravines
bridged
and
passable
at
all
seasons
,
where
the
public
heel
had
*NL*
testified
to
their
utility
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
looked
after
the
wild
stock
of
the
town
,
which
give
a
faithful
*NL*
herdsman
a
good
deal
of
trouble
by
leaping
fences
;
and
I
have
had
an
*NL*
eye
to
the
unfrequented
nooks
and
corners
of
the
farm
;
though
I
did
*NL*
not
always
know
whether
Jonas
or
Solomon
worked
in
a
particular
*NL*
field
to-day
;
that
was
none
of
my
business
.
I
have
watered
the
red
*NL*
huckleberry
,
the
sand
cherry
and
the
nettle-tree
,
the
red
pine
and
*NL*
the
black
ash
,
the
white
grape
and
the
yellow
violet
,
which
might
have
*NL*
withered
else
in
dry
seasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
went
on
thus
for
a
long
time
-LRB-
I
may
say
it
without
*NL*
boasting
-RRB-
,
faithfully
minding
my
business
,
till
it
became
more
and
more
*NL*
evident
that
my
townsmen
would
not
after
all
admit
me
into
the
list
of
*NL*
town
officers
,
nor
make
my
place
a
sinecure
with
a
moderate
allowance
.
*NL*
My
accounts
,
which
I
can
swear
to
have
kept
faithfully
,
I
have
,
indeed
,
*NL*
never
got
audited
,
still
less
accepted
,
still
less
paid
and
settled
.
*NL*
However
,
I
have
not
set
my
heart
on
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
since
,
a
strolling
Indian
went
to
sell
baskets
at
the
house
*NL*
of
a
well-known
lawyer
in
my
neighborhood
.
``
Do
you
wish
to
buy
any
*NL*
baskets
?
''
he
asked
.
``
No
,
we
do
not
want
any
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
What
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
Indian
as
he
went
out
the
gate
,
``
do
you
mean
to
starve
*NL*
us
?
''
Having
seen
his
industrious
white
neighbors
so
well
off
--
that
*NL*
the
lawyer
had
only
to
weave
arguments
,
and
,
by
some
magic
,
wealth
and
*NL*
standing
followed
--
he
had
said
to
himself
:
I
will
go
into
business
;
I
*NL*
will
weave
baskets
;
it
is
a
thing
which
I
can
do
.
Thinking
that
when
he
*NL*
had
made
the
baskets
he
would
have
done
his
part
,
and
then
it
would
be
*NL*
the
white
man
's
to
buy
them
.
He
had
not
discovered
that
it
was
necessary
*NL*
for
him
to
make
it
worth
the
other
's
while
to
buy
them
,
or
at
least
make
*NL*
him
think
that
it
was
so
,
or
to
make
something
else
which
it
would
be
*NL*
worth
his
while
to
buy
.
I
too
had
woven
a
kind
of
basket
of
a
delicate
*NL*
texture
,
but
I
had
not
made
it
worth
any
one
's
while
to
buy
them
.
Yet
*NL*
not
the
less
,
in
my
case
,
did
I
think
it
worth
my
while
to
weave
them
,
*NL*
and
instead
of
studying
how
to
make
it
worth
men
's
while
to
buy
my
*NL*
baskets
,
I
studied
rather
how
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
selling
them
.
*NL*
The
life
which
men
praise
and
regard
as
successful
is
but
one
kind
.
Why
*NL*
should
we
exaggerate
any
one
kind
at
the
expense
of
the
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
that
my
fellow-citizens
were
not
likely
to
offer
me
any
room
in
*NL*
the
court
house
,
or
any
curacy
or
living
anywhere
else
,
but
I
must
shift
*NL*
for
myself
,
I
turned
my
face
more
exclusively
than
ever
to
the
woods
,
*NL*
where
I
was
better
known
.
I
determined
to
go
into
business
at
once
,
and
*NL*
not
wait
to
acquire
the
usual
capital
,
using
such
slender
means
as
I
had
*NL*
already
got
.
My
purpose
in
going
to
Walden
Pond
was
not
to
live
cheaply
*NL*
nor
to
live
dearly
there
,
but
to
transact
some
private
business
with
the
*NL*
fewest
obstacles
;
to
be
hindered
from
accomplishing
which
for
want
of
a
*NL*
little
common
sense
,
a
little
enterprise
and
business
talent
,
appeared
*NL*
not
so
sad
as
foolish
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
always
endeavored
to
acquire
strict
business
habits
;
they
are
*NL*
indispensable
to
every
man
.
If
your
trade
is
with
the
Celestial
Empire
,
*NL*
then
some
small
counting
house
on
the
coast
,
in
some
Salem
harbor
,
will
*NL*
be
fixture
enough
.
You
will
export
such
articles
as
the
country
affords
,
*NL*
purely
native
products
,
much
ice
and
pine
timber
and
a
little
granite
,
*NL*
always
in
native
bottoms
.
These
will
be
good
ventures
.
To
oversee
all
*NL*
the
details
yourself
in
person
;
to
be
at
once
pilot
and
captain
,
and
*NL*
owner
and
underwriter
;
to
buy
and
sell
and
keep
the
accounts
;
to
*NL*
read
every
letter
received
,
and
write
or
read
every
letter
sent
;
to
*NL*
superintend
the
discharge
of
imports
night
and
day
;
to
be
upon
many
*NL*
parts
of
the
coast
almost
at
the
same
time
--
often
the
richest
freight
*NL*
will
be
discharged
upon
a
Jersey
shore
;
--
to
be
your
own
telegraph
,
*NL*
unweariedly
sweeping
the
horizon
,
speaking
all
passing
vessels
bound
*NL*
coastwise
;
to
keep
up
a
steady
despatch
of
commodities
,
for
the
supply
*NL*
of
such
a
distant
and
exorbitant
market
;
to
keep
yourself
informed
of
*NL*
the
state
of
the
markets
,
prospects
of
war
and
peace
everywhere
,
and
*NL*
anticipate
the
tendencies
of
trade
and
civilization
--
taking
advantage
*NL*
of
the
results
of
all
exploring
expeditions
,
using
new
passages
and
all
*NL*
improvements
in
navigation
;
--
charts
to
be
studied
,
the
position
of
reefs
*NL*
and
new
lights
and
buoys
to
be
ascertained
,
and
ever
,
and
ever
,
the
*NL*
logarithmic
tables
to
be
corrected
,
for
by
the
error
of
some
calculator
*NL*
the
vessel
often
splits
upon
a
rock
that
should
have
reached
a
friendly
*NL*
pier
--
there
is
the
untold
fate
of
La
Prouse
;
--
universal
science
to
*NL*
be
kept
pace
with
,
studying
the
lives
of
all
great
discoverers
and
*NL*
navigators
,
great
adventurers
and
merchants
,
from
Hanno
and
the
*NL*
Phoenicians
down
to
our
day
;
in
fine
,
account
of
stock
to
be
taken
from
*NL*
time
to
time
,
to
know
how
you
stand
.
It
is
a
labor
to
task
the
faculties
*NL*
of
a
man
--
such
problems
of
profit
and
loss
,
of
interest
,
of
tare
and
*NL*
tret
,
and
gauging
of
all
kinds
in
it
,
as
demand
a
universal
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
thought
that
Walden
Pond
would
be
a
good
place
for
business
,
*NL*
not
solely
on
account
of
the
railroad
and
the
ice
trade
;
it
offers
*NL*
advantages
which
it
may
not
be
good
policy
to
divulge
;
it
is
a
good
port
*NL*
and
a
good
foundation
.
No
Neva
marshes
to
be
filled
;
though
you
must
*NL*
everywhere
build
on
piles
of
your
own
driving
.
It
is
said
that
a
*NL*
flood-tide
,
with
a
westerly
wind
,
and
ice
in
the
Neva
,
would
sweep
St.
*NL*
Petersburg
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
business
was
to
be
entered
into
without
the
usual
capital
,
it
*NL*
may
not
be
easy
to
conjecture
where
those
means
,
that
will
still
be
*NL*
indispensable
to
every
such
undertaking
,
were
to
be
obtained
.
As
for
*NL*
Clothing
,
to
come
at
once
to
the
practical
part
of
the
question
,
perhaps
*NL*
we
are
led
oftener
by
the
love
of
novelty
and
a
regard
for
the
opinions
*NL*
of
men
,
in
procuring
it
,
than
by
a
true
utility
.
Let
him
who
has
work
to
*NL*
do
recollect
that
the
object
of
clothing
is
,
first
,
to
retain
the
vital
*NL*
heat
,
and
secondly
,
in
this
state
of
society
,
to
cover
nakedness
,
and
*NL*
he
may
judge
how
much
of
any
necessary
or
important
work
may
be
*NL*
accomplished
without
adding
to
his
wardrobe
.
Kings
and
queens
who
wear
*NL*
a
suit
but
once
,
though
made
by
some
tailor
or
dressmaker
to
their
*NL*
majesties
,
can
not
know
the
comfort
of
wearing
a
suit
that
fits
.
They
are
*NL*
no
better
than
wooden
horses
to
hang
the
clean
clothes
on
.
Every
day
our
*NL*
garments
become
more
assimilated
to
ourselves
,
receiving
the
impress
of
*NL*
the
wearer
's
character
,
until
we
hesitate
to
lay
them
aside
without
such
*NL*
delay
and
medical
appliances
and
some
such
solemnity
even
as
our
bodies
.
*NL*
No
man
ever
stood
the
lower
in
my
estimation
for
having
a
patch
in
his
*NL*
clothes
;
yet
I
am
sure
that
there
is
greater
anxiety
,
commonly
,
to
have
*NL*
fashionable
,
or
at
least
clean
and
unpatched
clothes
,
than
to
have
a
*NL*
sound
conscience
.
But
even
if
the
rent
is
not
mended
,
perhaps
the
worst
*NL*
vice
betrayed
is
improvidence
.
I
sometimes
try
my
acquaintances
by
such
*NL*
tests
as
this
--
Who
could
wear
a
patch
,
or
two
extra
seams
only
,
over
*NL*
the
knee
?
Most
behave
as
if
they
believed
that
their
prospects
for
life
*NL*
would
be
ruined
if
they
should
do
it
.
It
would
be
easier
for
them
to
*NL*
hobble
to
town
with
a
broken
leg
than
with
a
broken
pantaloon
.
Often
if
*NL*
an
accident
happens
to
a
gentleman
's
legs
,
they
can
be
mended
;
but
if
a
*NL*
similar
accident
happens
to
the
legs
of
his
pantaloons
,
there
is
no
help
*NL*
for
it
;
for
he
considers
,
not
what
is
truly
respectable
,
but
what
is
*NL*
respected
.
We
know
but
few
men
,
a
great
many
coats
and
breeches
.
Dress
*NL*
a
scarecrow
in
your
last
shift
,
you
standing
shiftless
by
,
who
would
not
*NL*
soonest
salute
the
scarecrow
?
Passing
a
cornfield
the
other
day
,
close
*NL*
by
a
hat
and
coat
on
a
stake
,
I
recognized
the
owner
of
the
farm
.
He
was
*NL*
only
a
little
more
weather-beaten
than
when
I
saw
him
last
.
I
have
*NL*
heard
of
a
dog
that
barked
at
every
stranger
who
approached
his
master
's
*NL*
premises
with
clothes
on
,
but
was
easily
quieted
by
a
naked
thief
.
It
is
*NL*
an
interesting
question
how
far
men
would
retain
their
relative
rank
*NL*
if
they
were
divested
of
their
clothes
.
Could
you
,
in
such
a
case
,
*NL*
tell
surely
of
any
company
of
civilized
men
which
belonged
to
the
most
*NL*
respected
class
?
When
Madam
Pfeiffer
,
in
her
adventurous
travels
round
*NL*
the
world
,
from
east
to
west
,
had
got
so
near
home
as
Asiatic
Russia
,
*NL*
she
says
that
she
felt
the
necessity
of
wearing
other
than
a
travelling
*NL*
dress
,
when
she
went
to
meet
the
authorities
,
for
she
``
was
now
in
a
*NL*
civilized
country
,
where
...
people
are
judged
of
by
their
clothes
.
''
Even
*NL*
in
our
democratic
New
England
towns
the
accidental
possession
of
wealth
,
*NL*
and
its
manifestation
in
dress
and
equipage
alone
,
obtain
for
the
*NL*
possessor
almost
universal
respect
.
But
they
yield
such
respect
,
*NL*
numerous
as
they
are
,
are
so
far
heathen
,
and
need
to
have
a
missionary
*NL*
sent
to
them
.
Beside
,
clothes
introduced
sewing
,
a
kind
of
work
which
*NL*
you
may
call
endless
;
a
woman
's
dress
,
at
least
,
is
never
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
who
has
at
length
found
something
to
do
will
not
need
to
get
a
new
*NL*
suit
to
do
it
in
;
for
him
the
old
will
do
,
that
has
lain
dusty
in
the
*NL*
garret
for
an
indeterminate
period
.
Old
shoes
will
serve
a
hero
longer
*NL*
than
they
have
served
his
valet
--
if
a
hero
ever
has
a
valet
--
bare
feet
*NL*
are
older
than
shoes
,
and
he
can
make
them
do
.
Only
they
who
go
to
*NL*
soirA
-LRB-
C
-RRB-
es
and
legislative
balls
must
have
new
coats
,
coats
to
change
as
*NL*
often
as
the
man
changes
in
them
.
But
if
my
jacket
and
trousers
,
my
hat
*NL*
and
shoes
,
are
fit
to
worship
God
in
,
they
will
do
;
will
they
not
?
Who
*NL*
ever
saw
his
old
clothes
--
his
old
coat
,
actually
worn
out
,
resolved
into
*NL*
its
primitive
elements
,
so
that
it
was
not
a
deed
of
charity
to
bestow
*NL*
it
on
some
poor
boy
,
by
him
perchance
to
be
bestowed
on
some
poorer
*NL*
still
,
or
shall
we
say
richer
,
who
could
do
with
less
?
I
say
,
beware
of
*NL*
all
enterprises
that
require
new
clothes
,
and
not
rather
a
new
wearer
of
*NL*
clothes
.
If
there
is
not
a
new
man
,
how
can
the
new
clothes
be
made
to
*NL*
fit
?
If
you
have
any
enterprise
before
you
,
try
it
in
your
old
clothes
.
*NL*
All
men
want
,
not
something
to
_
do
with
_
,
but
something
to
_
do
_
,
or
rather
*NL*
something
to
_
be
_
.
Perhaps
we
should
never
procure
a
new
suit
,
however
*NL*
ragged
or
dirty
the
old
,
until
we
have
so
conducted
,
so
enterprised
or
*NL*
sailed
in
some
way
,
that
we
feel
like
new
men
in
the
old
,
and
that
to
*NL*
retain
it
would
be
like
keeping
new
wine
in
old
bottles
.
Our
moulting
*NL*
season
,
like
that
of
the
fowls
,
must
be
a
crisis
in
our
lives
.
The
loon
*NL*
retires
to
solitary
ponds
to
spend
it
.
Thus
also
the
snake
casts
its
*NL*
slough
,
and
the
caterpillar
its
wormy
coat
,
by
an
internal
industry
*NL*
and
expansion
;
for
clothes
are
but
our
outmost
cuticle
and
mortal
*NL*
coil
.
Otherwise
we
shall
be
found
sailing
under
false
colors
,
and
be
*NL*
inevitably
cashiered
at
last
by
our
own
opinion
,
as
well
as
that
of
*NL*
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
don
garment
after
garment
,
as
if
we
grew
like
exogenous
plants
by
*NL*
addition
without
.
Our
outside
and
often
thin
and
fanciful
clothes
are
*NL*
our
epidermis
,
or
false
skin
,
which
partakes
not
of
our
life
,
and
may
be
*NL*
stripped
off
here
and
there
without
fatal
injury
;
our
thicker
garments
,
*NL*
constantly
worn
,
are
our
cellular
integument
,
or
cortex
;
but
our
shirts
*NL*
are
our
liber
,
or
true
bark
,
which
can
not
be
removed
without
girdling
*NL*
and
so
destroying
the
man
.
I
believe
that
all
races
at
some
seasons
wear
*NL*
something
equivalent
to
the
shirt
.
It
is
desirable
that
a
man
be
clad
*NL*
so
simply
that
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
himself
in
the
dark
,
and
that
he
*NL*
live
in
all
respects
so
compactly
and
preparedly
that
,
if
an
enemy
*NL*
take
the
town
,
he
can
,
like
the
old
philosopher
,
walk
out
the
gate
*NL*
empty-handed
without
anxiety
.
While
one
thick
garment
is
,
for
most
*NL*
purposes
,
as
good
as
three
thin
ones
,
and
cheap
clothing
can
be
obtained
*NL*
at
prices
really
to
suit
customers
;
while
a
thick
coat
can
be
bought
for
*NL*
five
dollars
,
which
will
last
as
many
years
,
thick
pantaloons
for
two
*NL*
dollars
,
cowhide
boots
for
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pair
,
a
summer
hat
for
*NL*
a
quarter
of
a
dollar
,
and
a
winter
cap
for
sixty-two
and
a
half
cents
,
*NL*
or
a
better
be
made
at
home
at
a
nominal
cost
,
where
is
he
so
poor
that
,
*NL*
clad
in
such
a
suit
,
of
_
his
own
earning
_
,
there
will
not
be
found
wise
*NL*
men
to
do
him
reverence
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
ask
for
a
garment
of
a
particular
form
,
my
tailoress
tells
me
*NL*
gravely
,
``
They
do
not
make
them
so
now
,
''
not
emphasizing
the
``
They
''
at
*NL*
all
,
as
if
she
quoted
an
authority
as
impersonal
as
the
Fates
,
and
I
*NL*
find
it
difficult
to
get
made
what
I
want
,
simply
because
she
can
not
*NL*
believe
that
I
mean
what
I
say
,
that
I
am
so
rash
.
When
I
hear
this
*NL*
oracular
sentence
,
I
am
for
a
moment
absorbed
in
thought
,
emphasizing
to
*NL*
myself
each
word
separately
that
I
may
come
at
the
meaning
of
it
,
that
I
*NL*
may
find
out
by
what
degree
of
consanguinity
_
They
_
are
related
to
_
me
_
,
*NL*
and
what
authority
they
may
have
in
an
affair
which
affects
me
so
*NL*
nearly
;
and
,
finally
,
I
am
inclined
to
answer
her
with
equal
mystery
,
*NL*
and
without
any
more
emphasis
of
the
``
they
''
--
``
It
is
true
,
they
did
not
*NL*
make
them
so
recently
,
but
they
do
now
.
''
Of
what
use
this
measuring
of
*NL*
me
if
she
does
not
measure
my
character
,
but
only
the
breadth
of
my
*NL*
shoulders
,
as
it
were
a
peg
to
hang
the
coat
on
?
We
worship
not
the
*NL*
Graces
,
nor
the
Parcae
,
but
Fashion
.
She
spins
and
weaves
and
cuts
with
*NL*
full
authority
.
The
head
monkey
at
Paris
puts
on
a
traveller
's
cap
,
and
*NL*
all
the
monkeys
in
America
do
the
same
.
I
sometimes
despair
of
getting
*NL*
anything
quite
simple
and
honest
done
in
this
world
by
the
help
of
men
.
*NL*
They
would
have
to
be
passed
through
a
powerful
press
first
,
to
squeeze
*NL*
their
old
notions
out
of
them
,
so
that
they
would
not
soon
get
upon
*NL*
their
legs
again
;
and
then
there
would
be
some
one
in
the
company
with
a
*NL*
maggot
in
his
head
,
hatched
from
an
egg
deposited
there
nobody
knows
*NL*
when
,
for
not
even
fire
kills
these
things
,
and
you
would
have
lost
your
*NL*
labor
.
Nevertheless
,
we
will
not
forget
that
some
Egyptian
wheat
was
*NL*
handed
down
to
us
by
a
mummy
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
I
think
that
it
can
not
be
maintained
that
dressing
has
in
*NL*
this
or
any
country
risen
to
the
dignity
of
an
art
.
At
present
men
make
*NL*
shift
to
wear
what
they
can
get
.
Like
shipwrecked
sailors
,
they
put
on
*NL*
what
they
can
find
on
the
beach
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
whether
of
*NL*
space
or
time
,
laugh
at
each
other
's
masquerade
.
Every
generation
laughs
*NL*
at
the
old
fashions
,
but
follows
religiously
the
new
.
We
are
amused
at
*NL*
beholding
the
costume
of
Henry
VIII
,
or
Queen
Elizabeth
,
as
much
as
if
*NL*
it
was
that
of
the
King
and
Queen
of
the
Cannibal
Islands
.
All
costume
*NL*
off
a
man
is
pitiful
or
grotesque
.
It
is
only
the
serious
eye
peering
*NL*
from
and
the
sincere
life
passed
within
it
which
restrain
laughter
and
*NL*
consecrate
the
costume
of
any
people
.
Let
Harlequin
be
taken
with
a
fit
*NL*
of
the
colic
and
his
trappings
will
have
to
serve
that
mood
too
.
When
*NL*
the
soldier
is
hit
by
a
cannonball
,
rags
are
as
becoming
as
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
childish
and
savage
taste
of
men
and
women
for
new
patterns
keeps
*NL*
how
many
shaking
and
squinting
through
kaleidoscopes
that
they
may
*NL*
discover
the
particular
figure
which
this
generation
requires
today
.
The
*NL*
manufacturers
have
learned
that
this
taste
is
merely
whimsical
.
Of
two
*NL*
patterns
which
differ
only
by
a
few
threads
more
or
less
of
a
particular
*NL*
color
,
the
one
will
be
sold
readily
,
the
other
lie
on
the
shelf
,
though
*NL*
it
frequently
happens
that
after
the
lapse
of
a
season
the
latter
*NL*
becomes
the
most
fashionable
.
Comparatively
,
tattooing
is
not
the
*NL*
hideous
custom
which
it
is
called
.
It
is
not
barbarous
merely
because
*NL*
the
printing
is
skin-deep
and
unalterable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
believe
that
our
factory
system
is
the
best
mode
by
which
men
*NL*
may
get
clothing
.
The
condition
of
the
operatives
is
becoming
every
day
*NL*
more
like
that
of
the
English
;
and
it
can
not
be
wondered
at
,
since
,
*NL*
as
far
as
I
have
heard
or
observed
,
the
principal
object
is
,
not
*NL*
that
mankind
may
be
well
and
honestly
clad
,
but
,
unquestionably
,
that
*NL*
corporations
may
be
enriched
.
In
the
long
run
men
hit
only
what
they
aim
*NL*
at
.
Therefore
,
though
they
should
fail
immediately
,
they
had
better
aim
*NL*
at
something
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
a
Shelter
,
I
will
not
deny
that
this
is
now
a
necessary
of
*NL*
life
,
though
there
are
instances
of
men
having
done
without
it
for
*NL*
long
periods
in
colder
countries
than
this
.
Samuel
Laing
says
that
``
the
*NL*
Laplander
in
his
skin
dress
,
and
in
a
skin
bag
which
he
puts
over
his
*NL*
head
and
shoulders
,
will
sleep
night
after
night
on
the
snow
...
in
a
*NL*
degree
of
cold
which
would
extinguish
the
life
of
one
exposed
to
it
in
*NL*
any
woollen
clothing
.
''
He
had
seen
them
asleep
thus
.
Yet
he
adds
,
``
They
*NL*
are
not
hardier
than
other
people
.
''
But
,
probably
,
man
did
not
live
long
*NL*
on
the
earth
without
discovering
the
convenience
which
there
is
in
a
*NL*
house
,
the
domestic
comforts
,
which
phrase
may
have
originally
signified
*NL*
the
satisfactions
of
the
house
more
than
of
the
family
;
though
these
*NL*
must
be
extremely
partial
and
occasional
in
those
climates
where
the
*NL*
house
is
associated
in
our
thoughts
with
winter
or
the
rainy
season
*NL*
chiefly
,
and
two
thirds
of
the
year
,
except
for
a
parasol
,
is
*NL*
unnecessary
.
In
our
climate
,
in
the
summer
,
it
was
formerly
almost
*NL*
solely
a
covering
at
night
.
In
the
Indian
gazettes
a
wigwam
was
the
*NL*
symbol
of
a
day
's
march
,
and
a
row
of
them
cut
or
painted
on
the
bark
of
*NL*
a
tree
signified
that
so
many
times
they
had
camped
.
Man
was
not
made
*NL*
so
large
limbed
and
robust
but
that
he
must
seek
to
narrow
his
world
*NL*
and
wall
in
a
space
such
as
fitted
him
.
He
was
at
first
bare
and
out
of
*NL*
doors
;
but
though
this
was
pleasant
enough
in
serene
and
warm
weather
,
*NL*
by
daylight
,
the
rainy
season
and
the
winter
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
*NL*
torrid
sun
,
would
perhaps
have
nipped
his
race
in
the
bud
if
he
had
not
*NL*
made
haste
to
clothe
himself
with
the
shelter
of
a
house
.
Adam
and
Eve
,
*NL*
according
to
the
fable
,
wore
the
bower
before
other
clothes
.
Man
wanted
*NL*
a
home
,
a
place
of
warmth
,
or
comfort
,
first
of
warmth
,
then
the
warmth
*NL*
of
the
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
imagine
a
time
when
,
in
the
infancy
of
the
human
race
,
some
*NL*
enterprising
mortal
crept
into
a
hollow
in
a
rock
for
shelter
.
Every
*NL*
child
begins
the
world
again
,
to
some
extent
,
and
loves
to
stay
*NL*
outdoors
,
even
in
wet
and
cold
.
It
plays
house
,
as
well
as
horse
,
having
*NL*
an
instinct
for
it
.
Who
does
not
remember
the
interest
with
which
,
when
*NL*
young
,
he
looked
at
shelving
rocks
,
or
any
approach
to
a
cave
?
It
was
*NL*
the
natural
yearning
of
that
portion
,
any
portion
of
our
most
primitive
*NL*
ancestor
which
still
survived
in
us
.
From
the
cave
we
have
advanced
to
*NL*
roofs
of
palm
leaves
,
of
bark
and
boughs
,
of
linen
woven
and
stretched
,
*NL*
of
grass
and
straw
,
of
boards
and
shingles
,
of
stones
and
tiles
.
At
*NL*
last
,
we
know
not
what
it
is
to
live
in
the
open
air
,
and
our
lives
are
*NL*
domestic
in
more
senses
than
we
think
.
From
the
hearth
the
field
is
a
*NL*
great
distance
.
It
would
be
well
,
perhaps
,
if
we
were
to
spend
more
of
*NL*
our
days
and
nights
without
any
obstruction
between
us
and
the
celestial
*NL*
bodies
,
if
the
poet
did
not
speak
so
much
from
under
a
roof
,
or
the
*NL*
saint
dwell
there
so
long
.
Birds
do
not
sing
in
caves
,
nor
do
doves
*NL*
cherish
their
innocence
in
dovecots
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
if
one
designs
to
construct
a
dwelling-house
,
it
behooves
him
*NL*
to
exercise
a
little
Yankee
shrewdness
,
lest
after
all
he
find
himself
*NL*
in
a
workhouse
,
a
labyrinth
without
a
clue
,
a
museum
,
an
almshouse
,
a
*NL*
prison
,
or
a
splendid
mausoleum
instead
.
Consider
first
how
slight
a
*NL*
shelter
is
absolutely
necessary
.
I
have
seen
Penobscot
Indians
,
in
this
*NL*
town
,
living
in
tents
of
thin
cotton
cloth
,
while
the
snow
was
nearly
a
*NL*
foot
deep
around
them
,
and
I
thought
that
they
would
be
glad
to
have
*NL*
it
deeper
to
keep
out
the
wind
.
Formerly
,
when
how
to
get
my
living
*NL*
honestly
,
with
freedom
left
for
my
proper
pursuits
,
was
a
question
*NL*
which
vexed
me
even
more
than
it
does
now
,
for
unfortunately
I
am
become
*NL*
somewhat
callous
,
I
used
to
see
a
large
box
by
the
railroad
,
six
feet
*NL*
long
by
three
wide
,
in
which
the
laborers
locked
up
their
tools
at
*NL*
night
;
and
it
suggested
to
me
that
every
man
who
was
hard
pushed
might
*NL*
get
such
a
one
for
a
dollar
,
and
,
having
bored
a
few
auger
holes
in
it
,
*NL*
to
admit
the
air
at
least
,
get
into
it
when
it
rained
and
at
night
,
and
*NL*
hook
down
the
lid
,
and
so
have
freedom
in
his
love
,
and
in
his
soul
*NL*
be
free
.
This
did
not
appear
the
worst
,
nor
by
any
means
a
despicable
*NL*
alternative
.
You
could
sit
up
as
late
as
you
pleased
,
and
,
whenever
you
*NL*
got
up
,
go
abroad
without
any
landlord
or
house-lord
dogging
you
for
*NL*
rent
.
Many
a
man
is
harassed
to
death
to
pay
the
rent
of
a
larger
and
*NL*
more
luxurious
box
who
would
not
have
frozen
to
death
in
such
a
box
as
*NL*
this
.
I
am
far
from
jesting
.
Economy
is
a
subject
which
admits
of
being
*NL*
treated
with
levity
,
but
it
can
not
so
be
disposed
of
.
A
comfortable
*NL*
house
for
a
rude
and
hardy
race
,
that
lived
mostly
out
of
doors
,
was
*NL*
once
made
here
almost
entirely
of
such
materials
as
Nature
furnished
*NL*
ready
to
their
hands
.
Gookin
,
who
was
superintendent
of
the
Indians
*NL*
subject
to
the
Massachusetts
Colony
,
writing
in
1674
,
says
,
``
The
best
*NL*
of
their
houses
are
covered
very
neatly
,
tight
and
warm
,
with
barks
of
*NL*
trees
,
slipped
from
their
bodies
at
those
seasons
when
the
sap
is
up
,
*NL*
and
made
into
great
flakes
,
with
pressure
of
weighty
timber
,
when
they
*NL*
are
green
...
The
meaner
sort
are
covered
with
mats
which
they
make
of
*NL*
a
kind
of
bulrush
,
and
are
also
indifferently
tight
and
warm
,
but
not
*NL*
so
good
as
the
former
...
Some
I
have
seen
,
sixty
or
a
hundred
feet
*NL*
long
and
thirty
feet
broad
...
I
have
often
lodged
in
their
wigwams
,
and
*NL*
found
them
as
warm
as
the
best
English
houses
.
''
He
adds
that
they
were
*NL*
commonly
carpeted
and
lined
within
with
well-wrought
embroidered
mats
,
*NL*
and
were
furnished
with
various
utensils
.
The
Indians
had
advanced
so
*NL*
far
as
to
regulate
the
effect
of
the
wind
by
a
mat
suspended
over
the
*NL*
hole
in
the
roof
and
moved
by
a
string
.
Such
a
lodge
was
in
the
first
*NL*
instance
constructed
in
a
day
or
two
at
most
,
and
taken
down
and
put
up
*NL*
in
a
few
hours
;
and
every
family
owned
one
,
or
its
apartment
in
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
savage
state
every
family
owns
a
shelter
as
good
as
the
best
,
and
*NL*
sufficient
for
its
coarser
and
simpler
wants
;
but
I
think
that
I
speak
*NL*
within
bounds
when
I
say
that
,
though
the
birds
of
the
air
have
their
*NL*
nests
,
and
the
foxes
their
holes
,
and
the
savages
their
wigwams
,
in
*NL*
modern
civilized
society
not
more
than
one
half
the
families
own
a
*NL*
shelter
.
In
the
large
towns
and
cities
,
where
civilization
especially
*NL*
prevails
,
the
number
of
those
who
own
a
shelter
is
a
very
small
fraction
*NL*
of
the
whole
.
The
rest
pay
an
annual
tax
for
this
outside
garment
of
*NL*
all
,
become
indispensable
summer
and
winter
,
which
would
buy
a
village
*NL*
of
Indian
wigwams
,
but
now
helps
to
keep
them
poor
as
long
as
they
live
.
*NL*
I
do
not
mean
to
insist
here
on
the
disadvantage
of
hiring
compared
with
*NL*
owning
,
but
it
is
evident
that
the
savage
owns
his
shelter
because
it
*NL*
costs
so
little
,
while
the
civilized
man
hires
his
commonly
because
he
*NL*
can
not
afford
to
own
it
;
nor
can
he
,
in
the
long
run
,
any
better
afford
*NL*
to
hire
.
But
,
answers
one
,
by
merely
paying
this
tax
,
the
poor
civilized
*NL*
man
secures
an
abode
which
is
a
palace
compared
with
the
savage
's
.
An
*NL*
annual
rent
of
from
twenty-five
to
a
hundred
dollars
-LRB-
these
are
the
*NL*
country
rates
-RRB-
entitles
him
to
the
benefit
of
the
improvements
*NL*
of
centuries
,
spacious
apartments
,
clean
paint
and
paper
,
Rumford
*NL*
fire-place
,
back
plastering
,
Venetian
blinds
,
copper
pump
,
spring
lock
,
*NL*
a
commodious
cellar
,
and
many
other
things
.
But
how
happens
it
that
he
*NL*
who
is
said
to
enjoy
these
things
is
so
commonly
a
poor
civilized
*NL*
man
,
while
the
savage
,
who
has
them
not
,
is
rich
as
a
savage
?
If
it
*NL*
is
asserted
that
civilization
is
a
real
advance
in
the
condition
*NL*
of
man
--
and
I
think
that
it
is
,
though
only
the
wise
improve
their
*NL*
advantages
--
it
must
be
shown
that
it
has
produced
better
dwellings
*NL*
without
making
them
more
costly
;
and
the
cost
of
a
thing
is
the
amount
*NL*
of
what
I
will
call
life
which
is
required
to
be
exchanged
for
it
,
*NL*
immediately
or
in
the
long
run
.
An
average
house
in
this
neighborhood
*NL*
costs
perhaps
eight
hundred
dollars
,
and
to
lay
up
this
sum
will
take
*NL*
from
ten
to
fifteen
years
of
the
laborer
's
life
,
even
if
he
is
not
*NL*
encumbered
with
a
family
--
estimating
the
pecuniary
value
of
every
man
's
*NL*
labor
at
one
dollar
a
day
,
for
if
some
receive
more
,
others
receive
*NL*
less
;
--
so
that
he
must
have
spent
more
than
half
his
life
commonly
*NL*
before
his
wigwam
will
be
earned
.
If
we
suppose
him
to
pay
a
rent
*NL*
instead
,
this
is
but
a
doubtful
choice
of
evils
.
Would
the
savage
have
*NL*
been
wise
to
exchange
his
wigwam
for
a
palace
on
these
terms
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
guessed
that
I
reduce
almost
the
whole
advantage
of
holding
*NL*
this
superfluous
property
as
a
fund
in
store
against
the
future
,
so
*NL*
far
as
the
individual
is
concerned
,
mainly
to
the
defraying
of
*NL*
funeral
expenses
.
But
perhaps
a
man
is
not
required
to
bury
himself
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
this
points
to
an
important
distinction
between
the
*NL*
civilized
man
and
the
savage
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
they
have
designs
on
us
for
*NL*
our
benefit
,
in
making
the
life
of
a
civilized
people
an
_
institution
_
,
in
*NL*
which
the
life
of
the
individual
is
to
a
great
extent
absorbed
,
in
order
*NL*
to
preserve
and
perfect
that
of
the
race
.
But
I
wish
to
show
at
what
a
*NL*
sacrifice
this
advantage
is
at
present
obtained
,
and
to
suggest
that
we
*NL*
may
possibly
so
live
as
to
secure
all
the
advantage
without
suffering
*NL*
any
of
the
disadvantage
.
What
mean
ye
by
saying
that
the
poor
ye
have
*NL*
always
with
you
,
or
that
the
fathers
have
eaten
sour
grapes
,
and
the
*NL*
children
's
teeth
are
set
on
edge
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
live
,
saith
the
Lord
God
,
ye
shall
not
have
occasion
any
more
to
*NL*
use
this
proverb
in
Israel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
all
souls
are
mine
;
as
the
soul
of
the
father
,
so
also
the
soul
*NL*
of
the
son
is
mine
:
the
soul
that
sinneth
,
it
shall
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
consider
my
neighbors
,
the
farmers
of
Concord
,
who
are
at
least
*NL*
as
well
off
as
the
other
classes
,
I
find
that
for
the
most
part
they
*NL*
have
been
toiling
twenty
,
thirty
,
or
forty
years
,
that
they
may
become
*NL*
the
real
owners
of
their
farms
,
which
commonly
they
have
inherited
with
*NL*
encumbrances
,
or
else
bought
with
hired
money
--
and
we
may
regard
one
*NL*
third
of
that
toil
as
the
cost
of
their
houses
--
but
commonly
they
have
*NL*
not
paid
for
them
yet
.
It
is
true
,
the
encumbrances
sometimes
outweigh
*NL*
the
value
of
the
farm
,
so
that
the
farm
itself
becomes
one
great
*NL*
encumbrance
,
and
still
a
man
is
found
to
inherit
it
,
being
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
it
,
as
he
says
.
On
applying
to
the
assessors
,
I
am
*NL*
surprised
to
learn
that
they
can
not
at
once
name
a
dozen
in
the
town
who
*NL*
own
their
farms
free
and
clear
.
If
you
would
know
the
history
of
these
*NL*
homesteads
,
inquire
at
the
bank
where
they
are
mortgaged
.
The
man
who
*NL*
has
actually
paid
for
his
farm
with
labor
on
it
is
so
rare
that
every
*NL*
neighbor
can
point
to
him
.
I
doubt
if
there
are
three
such
men
in
*NL*
Concord
.
What
has
been
said
of
the
merchants
,
that
a
very
large
*NL*
majority
,
even
ninety-seven
in
a
hundred
,
are
sure
to
fail
,
is
equally
*NL*
true
of
the
farmers
.
With
regard
to
the
merchants
,
however
,
one
of
them
*NL*
says
pertinently
that
a
great
part
of
their
failures
are
not
genuine
*NL*
pecuniary
failures
,
but
merely
failures
to
fulfil
their
engagements
,
*NL*
because
it
is
inconvenient
;
that
is
,
it
is
the
moral
character
that
*NL*
breaks
down
.
But
this
puts
an
infinitely
worse
face
on
the
matter
,
and
*NL*
suggests
,
beside
,
that
probably
not
even
the
other
three
succeed
in
*NL*
saving
their
souls
,
but
are
perchance
bankrupt
in
a
worse
sense
than
*NL*
they
who
fail
honestly
.
Bankruptcy
and
repudiation
are
the
springboards
*NL*
from
which
much
of
our
civilization
vaults
and
turns
its
somersets
,
but
*NL*
the
savage
stands
on
the
unelastic
plank
of
famine
.
Yet
the
Middlesex
*NL*
Cattle
Show
goes
off
here
with
_
A
-LRB-
C
-RRB-
clat
_
annually
,
as
if
all
the
joints
of
*NL*
the
agricultural
machine
were
suent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
is
endeavoring
to
solve
the
problem
of
a
livelihood
by
a
*NL*
formula
more
complicated
than
the
problem
itself
.
To
get
his
shoestrings
*NL*
he
speculates
in
herds
of
cattle
.
With
consummate
skill
he
has
set
his
*NL*
trap
with
a
hair
spring
to
catch
comfort
and
independence
,
and
then
,
as
*NL*
he
turned
away
,
got
his
own
leg
into
it
.
This
is
the
reason
he
is
poor
;
*NL*
and
for
a
similar
reason
we
are
all
poor
in
respect
to
a
thousand
savage
*NL*
comforts
,
though
surrounded
by
luxuries
.
As
Chapman
sings
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
false
society
of
men
--
*NL*
--
for
earthly
greatness
*NL*
All
heavenly
comforts
rarefies
to
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
the
farmer
has
got
his
house
,
he
may
not
be
the
richer
but
the
*NL*
poorer
for
it
,
and
it
be
the
house
that
has
got
him
.
As
I
understand
*NL*
it
,
that
was
a
valid
objection
urged
by
Momus
against
the
house
which
*NL*
Minerva
made
,
that
she
``
had
not
made
it
movable
,
by
which
means
a
bad
*NL*
neighborhood
might
be
avoided
''
;
and
it
may
still
be
urged
,
for
our
*NL*
houses
are
such
unwieldy
property
that
we
are
often
imprisoned
rather
*NL*
than
housed
in
them
;
and
the
bad
neighborhood
to
be
avoided
is
our
own
*NL*
scurvy
selves
.
I
know
one
or
two
families
,
at
least
,
in
this
town
,
who
,
*NL*
for
nearly
a
generation
,
have
been
wishing
to
sell
their
houses
in
*NL*
the
outskirts
and
move
into
the
village
,
but
have
not
been
able
to
*NL*
accomplish
it
,
and
only
death
will
set
them
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Granted
that
the
majority
are
able
at
last
either
to
own
or
hire
the
*NL*
modern
house
with
all
its
improvements
.
While
civilization
has
been
*NL*
improving
our
houses
,
it
has
not
equally
improved
the
men
who
are
to
*NL*
inhabit
them
.
It
has
created
palaces
,
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
create
*NL*
noblemen
and
kings
.
And
_
if
the
civilized
man
's
pursuits
are
no
worthier
*NL*
than
the
savage
's
,
if
he
is
employed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
*NL*
obtaining
gross
necessaries
and
comforts
merely
,
why
should
he
have
a
*NL*
better
dwelling
than
the
former
?
_
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
do
the
poor
minority
fare
?
Perhaps
it
will
be
found
that
just
in
*NL*
proportion
as
some
have
been
placed
in
outward
circumstances
above
the
*NL*
savage
,
others
have
been
degraded
below
him
.
The
luxury
of
one
class
*NL*
is
counterbalanced
by
the
indigence
of
another
.
On
the
one
side
is
the
*NL*
palace
,
on
the
other
are
the
almshouse
and
``
silent
poor
.
''
The
myriads
*NL*
who
built
the
pyramids
to
be
the
tombs
of
the
Pharaohs
were
fed
on
*NL*
garlic
,
and
it
may
be
were
not
decently
buried
themselves
.
The
mason
who
*NL*
finishes
the
cornice
of
the
palace
returns
at
night
perchance
to
a
hut
*NL*
not
so
good
as
a
wigwam
.
It
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
,
in
a
country
*NL*
where
the
usual
evidences
of
civilization
exist
,
the
condition
of
a
very
*NL*
large
body
of
the
inhabitants
may
not
be
as
degraded
as
that
of
savages
.
*NL*
I
refer
to
the
degraded
poor
,
not
now
to
the
degraded
rich
.
To
know
this
*NL*
I
should
not
need
to
look
farther
than
to
the
shanties
which
everywhere
*NL*
border
our
railroads
,
that
last
improvement
in
civilization
;
where
I
see
*NL*
in
my
daily
walks
human
beings
living
in
sties
,
and
all
winter
with
an
*NL*
open
door
,
for
the
sake
of
light
,
without
any
visible
,
often
imaginable
,
*NL*
wood-pile
,
and
the
forms
of
both
old
and
young
are
permanently
*NL*
contracted
by
the
long
habit
of
shrinking
from
cold
and
misery
,
and
the
*NL*
development
of
all
their
limbs
and
faculties
is
checked
.
It
certainly
*NL*
is
fair
to
look
at
that
class
by
whose
labor
the
works
which
distinguish
*NL*
this
generation
are
accomplished
.
Such
too
,
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
,
*NL*
is
the
condition
of
the
operatives
of
every
denomination
in
England
,
*NL*
which
is
the
great
workhouse
of
the
world
.
Or
I
could
refer
you
to
*NL*
Ireland
,
which
is
marked
as
one
of
the
white
or
enlightened
spots
on
the
*NL*
map
.
Contrast
the
physical
condition
of
the
Irish
with
that
of
the
North
*NL*
American
Indian
,
or
the
South
Sea
Islander
,
or
any
other
savage
race
*NL*
before
it
was
degraded
by
contact
with
the
civilized
man
.
Yet
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
that
that
people
's
rulers
are
as
wise
as
the
average
of
civilized
*NL*
rulers
.
Their
condition
only
proves
what
squalidness
may
consist
with
*NL*
civilization
.
I
hardly
need
refer
now
to
the
laborers
in
our
Southern
*NL*
States
who
produce
the
staple
exports
of
this
country
,
and
are
*NL*
themselves
a
staple
production
of
the
South
.
But
to
confine
myself
to
*NL*
those
who
are
said
to
be
in
_
moderate
_
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
men
appear
never
to
have
considered
what
a
house
is
,
and
are
*NL*
actually
though
needlessly
poor
all
their
lives
because
they
think
that
*NL*
they
must
have
such
a
one
as
their
neighbors
have
.
As
if
one
were
*NL*
to
wear
any
sort
of
coat
which
the
tailor
might
cut
out
for
him
,
or
,
*NL*
gradually
leaving
off
palm-leaf
hat
or
cap
of
woodchuck
skin
,
complain
*NL*
of
hard
times
because
he
could
not
afford
to
buy
him
a
crown
!
It
is
*NL*
possible
to
invent
a
house
still
more
convenient
and
luxurious
than
we
*NL*
have
,
which
yet
all
would
admit
that
man
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
.
*NL*
Shall
we
always
study
to
obtain
more
of
these
things
,
and
not
sometimes
*NL*
to
be
content
with
less
?
Shall
the
respectable
citizen
thus
gravely
*NL*
teach
,
by
precept
and
example
,
the
necessity
of
the
young
man
's
*NL*
providing
a
certain
number
of
superfluous
glow-shoes
,
and
umbrellas
,
and
*NL*
empty
guest
chambers
for
empty
guests
,
before
he
dies
?
Why
should
not
*NL*
our
furniture
be
as
simple
as
the
Arab
's
or
the
Indian
's
?
When
I
think
*NL*
of
the
benefactors
of
the
race
,
whom
we
have
apotheosized
as
messengers
*NL*
from
heaven
,
bearers
of
divine
gifts
to
man
,
I
do
not
see
in
my
mind
any
*NL*
retinue
at
their
heels
,
any
carload
of
fashionable
furniture
.
Or
what
*NL*
if
I
were
to
allow
--
would
it
not
be
a
singular
allowance
?
--
that
our
*NL*
furniture
should
be
more
complex
than
the
Arab
's
,
in
proportion
as
we
*NL*
are
morally
and
intellectually
his
superiors
!
At
present
our
houses
are
*NL*
cluttered
and
defiled
with
it
,
and
a
good
housewife
would
sweep
out
*NL*
the
greater
part
into
the
dust
hole
,
and
not
leave
her
morning
's
work
*NL*
undone
.
Morning
work
!
By
the
blushes
of
Aurora
and
the
music
of
Memnon
,
*NL*
what
should
be
man
's
_
morning
work
_
in
this
world
?
I
had
three
pieces
of
*NL*
limestone
on
my
desk
,
but
I
was
terrified
to
find
that
they
required
to
*NL*
be
dusted
daily
,
when
the
furniture
of
my
mind
was
all
undusted
still
,
*NL*
and
threw
them
out
the
window
in
disgust
.
How
,
then
,
could
I
have
a
*NL*
furnished
house
?
I
would
rather
sit
in
the
open
air
,
for
no
dust
gathers
*NL*
on
the
grass
,
unless
where
man
has
broken
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
luxurious
and
dissipated
who
set
the
fashions
which
the
herd
*NL*
so
diligently
follow
.
The
traveller
who
stops
at
the
best
houses
,
so
*NL*
called
,
soon
discovers
this
,
for
the
publicans
presume
him
to
be
a
*NL*
Sardanapalus
,
and
if
he
resigned
himself
to
their
tender
mercies
he
*NL*
would
soon
be
completely
emasculated
.
I
think
that
in
the
railroad
car
*NL*
we
are
inclined
to
spend
more
on
luxury
than
on
safety
and
convenience
,
*NL*
and
it
threatens
without
attaining
these
to
become
no
better
than
a
*NL*
modern
drawing-room
,
with
its
divans
,
and
ottomans
,
and
sun-shades
,
*NL*
and
a
hundred
other
oriental
things
,
which
we
are
taking
west
with
us
,
*NL*
invented
for
the
ladies
of
the
harem
and
the
effeminate
natives
of
the
*NL*
Celestial
Empire
,
which
Jonathan
should
be
ashamed
to
know
the
names
*NL*
of
.
I
would
rather
sit
on
a
pumpkin
and
have
it
all
to
myself
than
be
*NL*
crowded
on
a
velvet
cushion
.
I
would
rather
ride
on
earth
in
an
ox
*NL*
cart
,
with
a
free
circulation
,
than
go
to
heaven
in
the
fancy
car
of
an
*NL*
excursion
train
and
breathe
a
_
malaria
_
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
simplicity
and
nakedness
of
man
's
life
in
the
primitive
ages
*NL*
imply
this
advantage
,
at
least
,
that
they
left
him
still
but
a
sojourner
*NL*
in
nature
.
When
he
was
refreshed
with
food
and
sleep
,
he
contemplated
*NL*
his
journey
again
.
He
dwelt
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
tent
in
this
world
,
and
*NL*
was
either
threading
the
valleys
,
or
crossing
the
plains
,
or
climbing
*NL*
the
mountain-tops
.
But
lo
!
men
have
become
the
tools
of
their
tools
.
The
*NL*
man
who
independently
plucked
the
fruits
when
he
was
hungry
is
become
a
*NL*
farmer
;
and
he
who
stood
under
a
tree
for
shelter
,
a
housekeeper
.
We
*NL*
now
no
longer
camp
as
for
a
night
,
but
have
settled
down
on
earth
and
*NL*
forgotten
heaven
.
We
have
adopted
Christianity
merely
as
an
improved
*NL*
method
of
_
agri
_
-
culture
.
We
have
built
for
this
world
a
family
mansion
,
*NL*
and
for
the
next
a
family
tomb
.
The
best
works
of
art
are
the
expression
*NL*
of
man
's
struggle
to
free
himself
from
this
condition
,
but
the
effect
*NL*
of
our
art
is
merely
to
make
this
low
state
comfortable
and
that
higher
*NL*
state
to
be
forgotten
.
There
is
actually
no
place
in
this
village
for
a
*NL*
work
of
_
fine
_
art
,
if
any
had
come
down
to
us
,
to
stand
,
for
our
lives
,
*NL*
our
houses
and
streets
,
furnish
no
proper
pedestal
for
it
.
There
is
not
*NL*
a
nail
to
hang
a
picture
on
,
nor
a
shelf
to
receive
the
bust
of
a
hero
*NL*
or
a
saint
.
When
I
consider
how
our
houses
are
built
and
paid
for
,
or
*NL*
not
paid
for
,
and
their
internal
economy
managed
and
sustained
,
I
wonder
*NL*
that
the
floor
does
not
give
way
under
the
visitor
while
he
is
admiring
*NL*
the
gewgaws
upon
the
mantelpiece
,
and
let
him
through
into
the
cellar
,
*NL*
to
some
solid
and
honest
though
earthy
foundation
.
I
can
not
but
perceive
*NL*
that
this
so-called
rich
and
refined
life
is
a
thing
jumped
at
,
and
I
*NL*
do
not
get
on
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
fine
arts
which
adorn
it
,
my
*NL*
attention
being
wholly
occupied
with
the
jump
;
for
I
remember
that
the
*NL*
greatest
genuine
leap
,
due
to
human
muscles
alone
,
on
record
,
is
that
of
*NL*
certain
wandering
Arabs
,
who
are
said
to
have
cleared
twenty-five
feet
*NL*
on
level
ground
.
Without
factitious
support
,
man
is
sure
to
come
to
*NL*
earth
again
beyond
that
distance
.
The
first
question
which
I
am
tempted
*NL*
to
put
to
the
proprietor
of
such
great
impropriety
is
,
Who
bolsters
*NL*
you
?
Are
you
one
of
the
ninety-seven
who
fail
,
or
the
three
who
succeed
?
*NL*
Answer
me
these
questions
,
and
then
perhaps
I
may
look
at
your
bawbles
*NL*
and
find
them
ornamental
.
The
cart
before
the
horse
is
neither
beautiful
*NL*
nor
useful
.
Before
we
can
adorn
our
houses
with
beautiful
objects
the
*NL*
walls
must
be
stripped
,
and
our
lives
must
be
stripped
,
and
beautiful
*NL*
housekeeping
and
beautiful
living
be
laid
for
a
foundation
:
now
,
a
taste
*NL*
for
the
beautiful
is
most
cultivated
out
of
doors
,
where
there
is
no
*NL*
house
and
no
housekeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Johnson
,
in
his
``
Wonder-Working
Providence
,
''
speaking
of
the
first
*NL*
settlers
of
this
town
,
with
whom
he
was
contemporary
,
tells
us
that
*NL*
``
they
burrow
themselves
in
the
earth
for
their
first
shelter
under
some
*NL*
hillside
,
and
,
casting
the
soil
aloft
upon
timber
,
they
make
a
smoky
*NL*
fire
against
the
earth
,
at
the
highest
side
.
''
They
did
not
``
provide
them
*NL*
houses
,
''
says
he
,
``
till
the
earth
,
by
the
Lord
's
blessing
,
brought
forth
*NL*
bread
to
feed
them
,
''
and
the
first
year
's
crop
was
so
light
that
*NL*
``
they
were
forced
to
cut
their
bread
very
thin
for
a
long
season
.
''
The
*NL*
secretary
of
the
Province
of
New
Netherland
,
writing
in
Dutch
,
in
1650
,
*NL*
for
the
information
of
those
who
wished
to
take
up
land
there
,
states
*NL*
more
particularly
that
``
those
in
New
Netherland
,
and
especially
in
New
*NL*
England
,
who
have
no
means
to
build
farmhouses
at
first
according
to
*NL*
their
wishes
,
dig
a
square
pit
in
the
ground
,
cellar
fashion
,
six
or
*NL*
seven
feet
deep
,
as
long
and
as
broad
as
they
think
proper
,
case
the
*NL*
earth
inside
with
wood
all
round
the
wall
,
and
line
the
wood
with
the
*NL*
bark
of
trees
or
something
else
to
prevent
the
caving
in
of
the
earth
;
*NL*
floor
this
cellar
with
plank
,
and
wainscot
it
overhead
for
a
ceiling
,
*NL*
raise
a
roof
of
spars
clear
up
,
and
cover
the
spars
with
bark
or
green
*NL*
sods
,
so
that
they
can
live
dry
and
warm
in
these
houses
with
their
*NL*
entire
families
for
two
,
three
,
and
four
years
,
it
being
understood
that
*NL*
partitions
are
run
through
those
cellars
which
are
adapted
to
the
size
*NL*
of
the
family
.
The
wealthy
and
principal
men
in
New
England
,
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
colonies
,
commenced
their
first
dwelling-houses
in
*NL*
this
fashion
for
two
reasons
:
firstly
,
in
order
not
to
waste
time
in
*NL*
building
,
and
not
to
want
food
the
next
season
;
secondly
,
in
order
not
*NL*
to
discourage
poor
laboring
people
whom
they
brought
over
in
numbers
*NL*
from
Fatherland
.
In
the
course
of
three
or
four
years
,
when
the
country
*NL*
became
adapted
to
agriculture
,
they
built
themselves
handsome
houses
,
*NL*
spending
on
them
several
thousands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
course
which
our
ancestors
took
there
was
a
show
of
prudence
*NL*
at
least
,
as
if
their
principle
were
to
satisfy
the
more
pressing
wants
*NL*
first
.
But
are
the
more
pressing
wants
satisfied
now
?
When
I
think
of
*NL*
acquiring
for
myself
one
of
our
luxurious
dwellings
,
I
am
deterred
,
for
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
the
country
is
not
yet
adapted
to
_
human
_
culture
,
and
we
are
*NL*
still
forced
to
cut
our
_
spiritual
_
bread
far
thinner
than
our
forefathers
*NL*
did
their
wheaten
.
Not
that
all
architectural
ornament
is
to
be
*NL*
neglected
even
in
the
rudest
periods
;
but
let
our
houses
first
be
*NL*
lined
with
beauty
,
where
they
come
in
contact
with
our
lives
,
like
the
*NL*
tenement
of
the
shellfish
,
and
not
overlaid
with
it
.
But
,
alas
!
I
have
*NL*
been
inside
one
or
two
of
them
,
and
know
what
they
are
lined
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
we
are
not
so
degenerate
but
that
we
might
possibly
live
in
a
*NL*
cave
or
a
wigwam
or
wear
skins
today
,
it
certainly
is
better
to
accept
*NL*
the
advantages
,
though
so
dearly
bought
,
which
the
invention
and
*NL*
industry
of
mankind
offer
.
In
such
a
neighborhood
as
this
,
boards
and
*NL*
shingles
,
lime
and
bricks
,
are
cheaper
and
more
easily
obtained
than
*NL*
suitable
caves
,
or
whole
logs
,
or
bark
in
sufficient
quantities
,
or
*NL*
even
well-tempered
clay
or
flat
stones
.
I
speak
understandingly
on
this
*NL*
subject
,
for
I
have
made
myself
acquainted
with
it
both
theoretically
*NL*
and
practically
.
With
a
little
more
wit
we
might
use
these
materials
so
*NL*
as
to
become
richer
than
the
richest
now
are
,
and
make
our
civilization
*NL*
a
blessing
.
The
civilized
man
is
a
more
experienced
and
wiser
savage
.
*NL*
But
to
make
haste
to
my
own
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
end
of
March
,
1845
,
I
borrowed
an
axe
and
went
down
to
the
*NL*
woods
by
Walden
Pond
,
nearest
to
where
I
intended
to
build
my
house
,
and
*NL*
began
to
cut
down
some
tall
,
arrowy
white
pines
,
still
in
their
youth
,
*NL*
for
timber
.
It
is
difficult
to
begin
without
borrowing
,
but
perhaps
it
*NL*
is
the
most
generous
course
thus
to
permit
your
fellow-men
to
have
an
*NL*
interest
in
your
enterprise
.
The
owner
of
the
axe
,
as
he
released
his
*NL*
hold
on
it
,
said
that
it
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
;
but
I
returned
it
*NL*
sharper
than
I
received
it
.
It
was
a
pleasant
hillside
where
I
worked
,
*NL*
covered
with
pine
woods
,
through
which
I
looked
out
on
the
pond
,
and
a
*NL*
small
open
field
in
the
woods
where
pines
and
hickories
were
springing
*NL*
up
.
The
ice
in
the
pond
was
not
yet
dissolved
,
though
there
were
some
*NL*
open
spaces
,
and
it
was
all
dark-colored
and
saturated
with
water
.
There
*NL*
were
some
slight
flurries
of
snow
during
the
days
that
I
worked
there
;
*NL*
but
for
the
most
part
when
I
came
out
on
to
the
railroad
,
on
my
*NL*
way
home
,
its
yellow
sand
heap
stretched
away
gleaming
in
the
hazy
*NL*
atmosphere
,
and
the
rails
shone
in
the
spring
sun
,
and
I
heard
the
lark
*NL*
and
pewee
and
other
birds
already
come
to
commence
another
year
with
us
.
*NL*
They
were
pleasant
spring
days
,
in
which
the
winter
of
man
's
discontent
*NL*
was
thawing
as
well
as
the
earth
,
and
the
life
that
had
lain
torpid
*NL*
began
to
stretch
itself
.
One
day
,
when
my
axe
had
come
off
and
I
had
cut
*NL*
a
green
hickory
for
a
wedge
,
driving
it
with
a
stone
,
and
had
placed
the
*NL*
whole
to
soak
in
a
pond-hole
in
order
to
swell
the
wood
,
I
saw
a
striped
*NL*
snake
run
into
the
water
,
and
he
lay
on
the
bottom
,
apparently
without
*NL*
inconvenience
,
as
long
as
I
stayed
there
,
or
more
than
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
;
perhaps
because
he
had
not
yet
fairly
come
out
of
the
torpid
*NL*
state
.
It
appeared
to
me
that
for
a
like
reason
men
remain
in
their
*NL*
present
low
and
primitive
condition
;
but
if
they
should
feel
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
spring
of
springs
arousing
them
,
they
would
of
*NL*
necessity
rise
to
a
higher
and
more
ethereal
life
.
I
had
previously
seen
*NL*
the
snakes
in
frosty
mornings
in
my
path
with
portions
of
their
bodies
*NL*
still
numb
and
inflexible
,
waiting
for
the
sun
to
thaw
them
.
On
the
1st
*NL*
of
April
it
rained
and
melted
the
ice
,
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
,
*NL*
which
was
very
foggy
,
I
heard
a
stray
goose
groping
about
over
the
pond
*NL*
and
cackling
as
if
lost
,
or
like
the
spirit
of
the
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
went
on
for
some
days
cutting
and
hewing
timber
,
and
also
studs
*NL*
and
rafters
,
all
with
my
narrow
axe
,
not
having
many
communicable
or
*NL*
scholar-like
thoughts
,
singing
to
myself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
Men
say
they
know
many
things
;
*NL*
But
lo
!
they
have
taken
wings
--
*NL*
The
arts
and
sciences
,
*NL*
And
a
thousand
appliances
;
*NL*
The
wind
that
blows
*NL*
Is
all
that
any
body
knows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hewed
the
main
timbers
six
inches
square
,
most
of
the
studs
on
two
*NL*
sides
only
,
and
the
rafters
and
floor
timbers
on
one
side
,
leaving
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
bark
on
,
so
that
they
were
just
as
straight
and
much
*NL*
stronger
than
sawed
ones
.
Each
stick
was
carefully
mortised
or
tenoned
*NL*
by
its
stump
,
for
I
had
borrowed
other
tools
by
this
time
.
My
days
in
*NL*
the
woods
were
not
very
long
ones
;
yet
I
usually
carried
my
dinner
of
*NL*
bread
and
butter
,
and
read
the
newspaper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
,
at
*NL*
noon
,
sitting
amid
the
green
pine
boughs
which
I
had
cut
off
,
and
to
my
*NL*
bread
was
imparted
some
of
their
fragrance
,
for
my
hands
were
covered
*NL*
with
a
thick
coat
of
pitch
.
Before
I
had
done
I
was
more
the
friend
than
*NL*
the
foe
of
the
pine
tree
,
though
I
had
cut
down
some
of
them
,
having
*NL*
become
better
acquainted
with
it
.
Sometimes
a
rambler
in
the
wood
was
*NL*
attracted
by
the
sound
of
my
axe
,
and
we
chatted
pleasantly
over
the
*NL*
chips
which
I
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
middle
of
April
,
for
I
made
no
haste
in
my
work
,
but
rather
made
*NL*
the
most
of
it
,
my
house
was
framed
and
ready
for
the
raising
.
I
had
*NL*
already
bought
the
shanty
of
James
Collins
,
an
Irishman
who
worked
on
*NL*
the
Fitchburg
Railroad
,
for
boards
.
James
Collins
'
shanty
was
considered
*NL*
an
uncommonly
fine
one
.
When
I
called
to
see
it
he
was
not
at
home
.
I
*NL*
walked
about
the
outside
,
at
first
unobserved
from
within
,
the
window
*NL*
was
so
deep
and
high
.
It
was
of
small
dimensions
,
with
a
peaked
cottage
*NL*
roof
,
and
not
much
else
to
be
seen
,
the
dirt
being
raised
five
feet
all
*NL*
around
as
if
it
were
a
compost
heap
.
The
roof
was
the
soundest
part
,
*NL*
though
a
good
deal
warped
and
made
brittle
by
the
sun
.
Doorsill
there
*NL*
was
none
,
but
a
perennial
passage
for
the
hens
under
the
door
board
.
*NL*
Mrs.
C.
came
to
the
door
and
asked
me
to
view
it
from
the
inside
.
The
*NL*
hens
were
driven
in
by
my
approach
.
It
was
dark
,
and
had
a
dirt
floor
*NL*
for
the
most
part
,
dank
,
clammy
,
and
aguish
,
only
here
a
board
and
there
*NL*
a
board
which
would
not
bear
removal
.
She
lighted
a
lamp
to
show
me
the
*NL*
inside
of
the
roof
and
the
walls
,
and
also
that
the
board
floor
extended
*NL*
under
the
bed
,
warning
me
not
to
step
into
the
cellar
,
a
sort
of
dust
*NL*
hole
two
feet
deep
.
In
her
own
words
,
they
were
``
good
boards
overhead
,
*NL*
good
boards
all
around
,
and
a
good
window
''
--
of
two
whole
squares
*NL*
originally
,
only
the
cat
had
passed
out
that
way
lately
.
There
was
a
*NL*
stove
,
a
bed
,
and
a
place
to
sit
,
an
infant
in
the
house
where
it
*NL*
was
born
,
a
silk
parasol
,
gilt-framed
looking-glass
,
and
a
patent
new
*NL*
coffee-mill
nailed
to
an
oak
sapling
,
all
told
.
The
bargain
was
soon
*NL*
concluded
,
for
James
had
in
the
meanwhile
returned
.
I
to
pay
four
*NL*
dollars
and
twenty-five
cents
tonight
,
he
to
vacate
at
five
tomorrow
*NL*
morning
,
selling
to
nobody
else
meanwhile
:
I
to
take
possession
at
*NL*
six
.
It
were
well
,
he
said
,
to
be
there
early
,
and
anticipate
certain
*NL*
indistinct
but
wholly
unjust
claims
on
the
score
of
ground
rent
and
*NL*
fuel
.
This
he
assured
me
was
the
only
encumbrance
.
At
six
I
passed
*NL*
him
and
his
family
on
the
road
.
One
large
bundle
held
their
all
--
bed
,
*NL*
coffee-mill
,
looking-glass
,
hens
--
all
but
the
cat
;
she
took
to
the
woods
*NL*
and
became
a
wild
cat
,
and
,
as
I
learned
afterward
,
trod
in
a
trap
set
*NL*
for
woodchucks
,
and
so
became
a
dead
cat
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
down
this
dwelling
the
same
morning
,
drawing
the
nails
,
and
*NL*
removed
it
to
the
pond-side
by
small
cartloads
,
spreading
the
boards
*NL*
on
the
grass
there
to
bleach
and
warp
back
again
in
the
sun
.
One
early
*NL*
thrush
gave
me
a
note
or
two
as
I
drove
along
the
woodland
path
.
I
*NL*
was
informed
treacherously
by
a
young
Patrick
that
neighbor
Seeley
,
*NL*
an
Irishman
,
in
the
intervals
of
the
carting
,
transferred
the
still
*NL*
tolerable
,
straight
,
and
drivable
nails
,
staples
,
and
spikes
to
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
then
stood
when
I
came
back
to
pass
the
time
of
day
,
and
*NL*
look
freshly
up
,
unconcerned
,
with
spring
thoughts
,
at
the
devastation
;
*NL*
there
being
a
dearth
of
work
,
as
he
said
.
He
was
there
to
represent
*NL*
spectatordom
,
and
help
make
this
seemingly
insignificant
event
one
with
*NL*
the
removal
of
the
gods
of
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dug
my
cellar
in
the
side
of
a
hill
sloping
to
the
south
,
where
*NL*
a
woodchuck
had
formerly
dug
his
burrow
,
down
through
sumach
and
*NL*
blackberry
roots
,
and
the
lowest
stain
of
vegetation
,
six
feet
square
*NL*
by
seven
deep
,
to
a
fine
sand
where
potatoes
would
not
freeze
in
any
*NL*
winter
.
The
sides
were
left
shelving
,
and
not
stoned
;
but
the
sun
having
*NL*
never
shone
on
them
,
the
sand
still
keeps
its
place
.
It
was
but
two
*NL*
hours
'
work
.
I
took
particular
pleasure
in
this
breaking
of
ground
,
*NL*
for
in
almost
all
latitudes
men
dig
into
the
earth
for
an
equable
*NL*
temperature
.
Under
the
most
splendid
house
in
the
city
is
still
to
be
*NL*
found
the
cellar
where
they
store
their
roots
as
of
old
,
and
long
after
*NL*
the
superstructure
has
disappeared
posterity
remark
its
dent
in
the
*NL*
earth
.
The
house
is
still
but
a
sort
of
porch
at
the
entrance
of
a
*NL*
burrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
in
the
beginning
of
May
,
with
the
help
of
some
of
my
*NL*
acquaintances
,
rather
to
improve
so
good
an
occasion
for
neighborliness
*NL*
than
from
any
necessity
,
I
set
up
the
frame
of
my
house
.
No
man
was
ever
*NL*
more
honored
in
the
character
of
his
raisers
than
I
.
They
are
destined
,
*NL*
I
trust
,
to
assist
at
the
raising
of
loftier
structures
one
day
.
I
began
*NL*
to
occupy
my
house
on
the
4th
of
July
,
as
soon
as
it
was
boarded
and
*NL*
roofed
,
for
the
boards
were
carefully
feather-edged
and
lapped
,
so
that
*NL*
it
was
perfectly
impervious
to
rain
,
but
before
boarding
I
laid
the
*NL*
foundation
of
a
chimney
at
one
end
,
bringing
two
cartloads
of
stones
up
*NL*
the
hill
from
the
pond
in
my
arms
.
I
built
the
chimney
after
my
hoeing
*NL*
in
the
fall
,
before
a
fire
became
necessary
for
warmth
,
doing
my
cooking
*NL*
in
the
meanwhile
out
of
doors
on
the
ground
,
early
in
the
morning
:
which
*NL*
mode
I
still
think
is
in
some
respects
more
convenient
and
agreeable
*NL*
than
the
usual
one
.
When
it
stormed
before
my
bread
was
baked
,
I
fixed
*NL*
a
few
boards
over
the
fire
,
and
sat
under
them
to
watch
my
loaf
,
and
*NL*
passed
some
pleasant
hours
in
that
way
.
In
those
days
,
when
my
hands
*NL*
were
much
employed
,
I
read
but
little
,
but
the
least
scraps
of
paper
*NL*
which
lay
on
the
ground
,
my
holder
,
or
tablecloth
,
afforded
me
as
much
*NL*
entertainment
,
in
fact
answered
the
same
purpose
as
the
Iliad
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
worth
the
while
to
build
still
more
deliberately
than
I
did
,
*NL*
considering
,
for
instance
,
what
foundation
a
door
,
a
window
,
a
cellar
,
*NL*
a
garret
,
have
in
the
nature
of
man
,
and
perchance
never
raising
any
*NL*
superstructure
until
we
found
a
better
reason
for
it
than
our
temporal
*NL*
necessities
even
.
There
is
some
of
the
same
fitness
in
a
man
's
building
*NL*
his
own
house
that
there
is
in
a
bird
's
building
its
own
nest
.
Who
*NL*
knows
but
if
men
constructed
their
dwellings
with
their
own
hands
,
and
*NL*
provided
food
for
themselves
and
families
simply
and
honestly
enough
,
*NL*
the
poetic
faculty
would
be
universally
developed
,
as
birds
universally
*NL*
sing
when
they
are
so
engaged
?
But
alas
!
we
do
like
cowbirds
and
*NL*
cuckoos
,
which
lay
their
eggs
in
nests
which
other
birds
have
built
,
and
*NL*
cheer
no
traveller
with
their
chattering
and
unmusical
notes
.
Shall
we
*NL*
forever
resign
the
pleasure
of
construction
to
the
carpenter
?
What
does
*NL*
architecture
amount
to
in
the
experience
of
the
mass
of
men
?
I
never
*NL*
in
all
my
walks
came
across
a
man
engaged
in
so
simple
and
natural
an
*NL*
occupation
as
building
his
house
.
We
belong
to
the
community
.
It
is
*NL*
not
the
tailor
alone
who
is
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
;
it
is
as
much
the
*NL*
preacher
,
and
the
merchant
,
and
the
farmer
.
Where
is
this
division
of
*NL*
labor
to
end
?
and
what
object
does
it
finally
serve
?
No
doubt
another
*NL*
_
may
_
also
think
for
me
;
but
it
is
not
therefore
desirable
that
he
should
*NL*
do
so
to
the
exclusion
of
my
thinking
for
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
,
there
are
architects
so
called
in
this
country
,
and
I
have
*NL*
heard
of
one
at
least
possessed
with
the
idea
of
making
architectural
*NL*
ornaments
have
a
core
of
truth
,
a
necessity
,
and
hence
a
beauty
,
as
if
*NL*
it
were
a
revelation
to
him
.
All
very
well
perhaps
from
his
point
*NL*
of
view
,
but
only
a
little
better
than
the
common
dilettantism
.
A
*NL*
sentimental
reformer
in
architecture
,
he
began
at
the
cornice
,
not
*NL*
at
the
foundation
.
It
was
only
how
to
put
a
core
of
truth
within
the
*NL*
ornaments
,
that
every
sugarplum
,
in
fact
,
might
have
an
almond
or
*NL*
caraway
seed
in
it
--
though
I
hold
that
almonds
are
most
wholesome
*NL*
without
the
sugar
--
and
not
how
the
inhabitant
,
the
indweller
,
might
*NL*
build
truly
within
and
without
,
and
let
the
ornaments
take
care
of
*NL*
themselves
.
What
reasonable
man
ever
supposed
that
ornaments
were
*NL*
something
outward
and
in
the
skin
merely
--
that
the
tortoise
got
his
*NL*
spotted
shell
,
or
the
shell-fish
its
mother-o
'
-
pearl
tints
,
by
such
a
*NL*
contract
as
the
inhabitants
of
Broadway
their
Trinity
Church
?
But
a
man
*NL*
has
no
more
to
do
with
the
style
of
architecture
of
his
house
than
a
*NL*
tortoise
with
that
of
its
shell
:
nor
need
the
soldier
be
so
idle
as
to
*NL*
try
to
paint
the
precise
color
of
his
virtue
on
his
standard
.
The
enemy
*NL*
will
find
it
out
.
He
may
turn
pale
when
the
trial
comes
.
This
man
seemed
*NL*
to
me
to
lean
over
the
cornice
,
and
timidly
whisper
his
half
truth
*NL*
to
the
rude
occupants
who
really
knew
it
better
than
he
.
What
of
*NL*
architectural
beauty
I
now
see
,
I
know
has
gradually
grown
from
within
*NL*
outward
,
out
of
the
necessities
and
character
of
the
indweller
,
who
is
*NL*
the
only
builder
--
out
of
some
unconscious
truthfulness
,
and
nobleness
,
*NL*
without
ever
a
thought
for
the
appearance
and
whatever
additional
beauty
*NL*
of
this
kind
is
destined
to
be
produced
will
be
preceded
by
a
like
*NL*
unconscious
beauty
of
life
.
The
most
interesting
dwellings
in
this
*NL*
country
,
as
the
painter
knows
,
are
the
most
unpretending
,
humble
*NL*
log
huts
and
cottages
of
the
poor
commonly
;
it
is
the
life
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
whose
shells
they
are
,
and
not
any
peculiarity
in
their
*NL*
surfaces
merely
,
which
makes
them
picturesque
;
and
equally
interesting
*NL*
will
be
the
citizen
's
suburban
box
,
when
his
life
shall
be
as
simple
and
*NL*
as
agreeable
to
the
imagination
,
and
there
is
as
little
straining
after
*NL*
effect
in
the
style
of
his
dwelling
.
A
great
proportion
of
architectural
*NL*
ornaments
are
literally
hollow
,
and
a
September
gale
would
strip
them
*NL*
off
,
like
borrowed
plumes
,
without
injury
to
the
substantials
.
They
can
*NL*
do
without
architecture
who
have
no
olives
nor
wines
in
the
cellar
.
What
*NL*
if
an
equal
ado
were
made
about
the
ornaments
of
style
in
literature
,
*NL*
and
the
architects
of
our
bibles
spent
as
much
time
about
their
cornices
*NL*
as
the
architects
of
our
churches
do
?
So
are
made
the
_
belles-lettres
_
and
*NL*
the
_
beaux-arts
_
and
their
professors
.
Much
it
concerns
a
man
,
forsooth
,
*NL*
how
a
few
sticks
are
slanted
over
him
or
under
him
,
and
what
colors
*NL*
are
daubed
upon
his
box
.
It
would
signify
somewhat
,
if
,
in
any
earnest
*NL*
sense
,
he
slanted
them
and
daubed
it
;
but
the
spirit
having
departed
out
*NL*
of
the
tenant
,
it
is
of
a
piece
with
constructing
his
own
coffin
--
the
*NL*
architecture
of
the
grave
--
and
``
carpenter
''
is
but
another
name
for
*NL*
``
coffin-maker
.
''
One
man
says
,
in
his
despair
or
indifference
to
life
,
*NL*
take
up
a
handful
of
the
earth
at
your
feet
,
and
paint
your
house
that
*NL*
color
.
Is
he
thinking
of
his
last
and
narrow
house
?
Toss
up
a
copper
for
*NL*
it
as
well
.
What
an
abundance
of
leisure
he
must
have
!
Why
do
you
take
*NL*
up
a
handful
of
dirt
?
Better
paint
your
house
your
own
complexion
;
let
*NL*
it
turn
pale
or
blush
for
you
.
An
enterprise
to
improve
the
style
of
*NL*
cottage
architecture
!
When
you
have
got
my
ornaments
ready
,
I
will
wear
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
winter
I
built
a
chimney
,
and
shingled
the
sides
of
my
house
,
*NL*
which
were
already
impervious
to
rain
,
with
imperfect
and
sappy
shingles
*NL*
made
of
the
first
slice
of
the
log
,
whose
edges
I
was
obliged
to
*NL*
straighten
with
a
plane
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
thus
a
tight
shingled
and
plastered
house
,
ten
feet
wide
by
*NL*
fifteen
long
,
and
eight-feet
posts
,
with
a
garret
and
a
closet
,
a
large
*NL*
window
on
each
side
,
two
trap
doors
,
one
door
at
the
end
,
and
a
brick
*NL*
fireplace
opposite
.
The
exact
cost
of
my
house
,
paying
the
usual
price
*NL*
for
such
materials
as
I
used
,
but
not
counting
the
work
,
all
of
which
*NL*
was
done
by
myself
,
was
as
follows
;
and
I
give
the
details
because
very
*NL*
few
are
able
to
tell
exactly

their
houses
cost

any

These
are
all
the
materials
,
excepting
the
timber
,
stones
,
and
sand
,
*NL*
which
I
claimed
by
squatter
's
right
.
I
have
also
a
small
woodshed
*NL*
adjoining
,
made
chiefly
of
the
stuff
which
was
left
after
building
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
intend
to
build
me
a
house
which
will
surpass
any
on
the
main
street
*NL*
in
Concord
in
grandeur
and
luxury
,
as
soon
as
it
pleases
me
as
much
and
*NL*
will
cost
me
no
more
than
my
present
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thus
found
that
the
student
who
wishes
for
a
shelter
can
obtain
one
*NL*
for
a
lifetime
at
an
expense
not
greater
than
the
rent
which
he
now
pays
*NL*
annually
.
If
I
seem
to
boast
more
than
is
becoming
,
my
excuse
is
that
*NL*
I
brag
for
humanity
rather
than
for
myself
;
and
my
shortcomings
and
*NL*
inconsistencies
do
not
affect
the
truth
of
my
statement
.
Notwithstanding
*NL*
much
cant
and
hypocrisy
--
chaff
which
I
find
it
difficult
to
separate
*NL*
from
my
wheat
,
but
for
which
I
am
as
sorry
as
any
man
--
I
will
breathe
*NL*
freely
and
stretch
myself
in
this
respect
,
it
is
such
a
relief
to
both
*NL*
the
moral
and
physical
system
;
and
I
am
resolved
that
I
will
not
through
*NL*
humility
become
the
devil
's
attorney
.
I
will
endeavor
to
speak
a
good
*NL*
word
for
the
truth
.
At
Cambridge
College
the
mere
rent
of
a
student
's
*NL*
room
,
which
is
only
a
little
larger
than
my
own
,
is
thirty
dollars
each
*NL*
year
,
though
the
corporation
had
the
advantage
of
building
thirty-two
*NL*
side
by
side
and
under
one
roof
,
and
the
occupant
suffers
the
*NL*
inconvenience
of
many
and
noisy
neighbors
,
and
perhaps
a
residence
in
*NL*
the
fourth
story
.
I
can
not
but
think
that
if
we
had
more
true
wisdom
*NL*
in
these
respects
,
not
only
less
education
would
be
needed
,
because
,
*NL*
forsooth
,
more
would
already
have
been
acquired
,
but
the
pecuniary
*NL*
expense
of
getting
an
education
would
in
a
great
measure
vanish
.
Those
*NL*
conveniences
which
the
student
requires
at
Cambridge
or
elsewhere
cost
*NL*
him
or
somebody
else
ten
times
as
great
a
sacrifice
of
life
as
they
*NL*
would
with
proper
management
on
both
sides
.
Those
things
for
which
*NL*
the
most
money
is
demanded
are
never
the
things
which
the
student
most
*NL*
wants
.
Tuition
,
for
instance
,
is
an
important
item
in
the
term
bill
,
*NL*
while
for
the
far
more
valuable
education
which
he
gets
by
associating
*NL*
with
the
most
cultivated
of
his
contemporaries
no
charge
is
made
.
The
*NL*
mode
of
founding
a
college
is
,
commonly
,
to
get
up
a
subscription
of
*NL*
dollars
and
cents
,
and
then
,
following
blindly
the
principles
of
a
*NL*
division
of
labor
to
its
extreme
--
a
principle
which
should
never
be
*NL*
followed
but
with
circumspection
--
to
call
in
a
contractor
who
makes
this
*NL*
a
subject
of
speculation
,
and
he
employs
Irishmen
or
other
operatives
*NL*
actually
to
lay
the
foundations
,
while
the
students
that
are
to
be
*NL*
are
said
to
be
fitting
themselves
for
it
;
and
for
these
oversights
*NL*
successive
generations
have
to
pay
.
I
think
that
it
would
be
better
_
than
*NL*
this
_
,
for
the
students
,
or
those
who
desire
to
be
benefited
by
it
,
even
*NL*
to
lay
the
foundation
themselves
.
The
student
who
secures
his
coveted
*NL*
leisure
and
retirement
by
systematically
shirking
any
labor
necessary
to
*NL*
man
obtains
but
an
ignoble
and
unprofitable
leisure
,
defrauding
himself
*NL*
of
the
experience
which
alone
can
make
leisure
fruitful
.
``
But
,
''
says
*NL*
one
,
``
you
do
not
mean
that
the
students
should
go
to
work
with
their
*NL*
hands
instead
of
their
heads
?
''
I
do
not
mean
that
exactly
,
but
I
mean
*NL*
something
which
he
might
think
a
good
deal
like
that
;
I
mean
that
they
*NL*
should
not
_
play
_
life
,
or
_
study
_
it
merely
,
while
the
community
supports
*NL*
them
at
this
expensive
game
,
but
earnestly
live
it
from
beginning
to
*NL*
end
.
How
could
youths
better
learn
to
live
than
by
at
once
trying
the
*NL*
experiment
of
living
?
Methinks
this
would
exercise
their
minds
as
much
*NL*
as
mathematics
.
If
I
wished
a
boy
to
know
something
about
the
arts
and
*NL*
sciences
,
for
instance
,
I
would
not
pursue
the
common
course
,
which
*NL*
is
merely
to
send
him
into
the
neighborhood
of
some
professor
,
where
*NL*
anything
is
professed
and
practised
but
the
art
of
life
;
--
to
survey
the
*NL*
world
through
a
telescope
or
a
microscope
,
and
never
with
his
natural
*NL*
eye
;
to
study
chemistry
,
and
not
learn
how
his
bread
is
made
,
or
*NL*
mechanics
,
and
not
learn
how
it
is
earned
;
to
discover
new
satellites
to
*NL*
Neptune
,
and
not
detect
the
motes
in
his
eyes
,
or
to
what
vagabond
he
*NL*
is
a
satellite
himself
;
or
to
be
devoured
by
the
monsters
that
swarm
all
*NL*
around
him
,
while
contemplating
the
monsters
in
a
drop
of
vinegar
.
Which
*NL*
would
have
advanced
the
most
at
the
end
of
a
month
--
the
boy
who
had
made
*NL*
his
own
jackknife
from
the
ore
which
he
had
dug
and
smelted
,
reading
*NL*
as
much
as
would
be
necessary
for
this
--
or
the
boy
who
had
attended
*NL*
the
lectures
on
metallurgy
at
the
Institute
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
had
*NL*
received
a
Rodgers
'
penknife
from
his
father
?
Which
would
be
most
likely
*NL*
to
cut
his
fingers
?
...
To
my
astonishment
I
was
informed
on
leaving
*NL*
college
that
I
had
studied
navigation
!
--
why
,
if
I
had
taken
one
turn
*NL*
down
the
harbor
I
should
have
known
more
about
it
.
Even
the
poor
student
*NL*
studies
and
is
taught
only
_
political
_
economy
,
while
that
economy
*NL*
of
living
which
is
synonymous
with
philosophy
is
not
even
sincerely
*NL*
professed
in
our
colleges
.
The
consequence
is
,
that
while
he
is
reading
*NL*
Adam
Smith
,
Ricardo
,
and
Say
,
he
runs
his
father
in
debt
irretrievably
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
with
our
colleges
,
so
with
a
hundred
``
modern
improvements
''
;
there
*NL*
is
an
illusion
about
them
;
there
is
not
always
a
positive
advance
.
The
*NL*
devil
goes
on
exacting
compound
interest
to
the
last
for
his
early
share
*NL*
and
numerous
succeeding
investments
in
them
.
Our
inventions
are
wont
to
*NL*
be
pretty
toys
,
which
distract
our
attention
from
serious
things
.
They
*NL*
are
but
improved
means
to
an
unimproved
end
,
an
end
which
it
was
already
*NL*
but
too
easy
to
arrive
at
;
as
railroads
lead
to
Boston
or
New
York
.
*NL*
We
are
in
great
haste
to
construct
a
magnetic
telegraph
from
Maine
*NL*
to
Texas
;
but
Maine
and
Texas
,
it
may
be
,
have
nothing
important
to
*NL*
communicate
.
Either
is
in
such
a
predicament
as
the
man
who
was
*NL*
earnest
to
be
introduced
to
a
distinguished
deaf
woman
,
but
when
he
was
*NL*
presented
,
and
one
end
of
her
ear
trumpet
was
put
into
his
hand
,
had
*NL*
nothing
to
say
.
As
if
the
main
object
were
to
talk
fast
and
not
to
talk
*NL*
sensibly
.
We
are
eager
to
tunnel
under
the
Atlantic
and
bring
the
Old
*NL*
World
some
weeks
nearer
to
the
New
;
but
perchance
the
first
news
that
*NL*
will
leak
through
into
the
broad
,
flapping
American
ear
will
be
that
the
*NL*
Princess
Adelaide
has
the
whooping
cough
.
After
all
,
the
man
whose
horse
*NL*
trots
a
mile
in
a
minute
does
not
carry
the
most
important
messages
;
*NL*
he
is
not
an
evangelist
,
nor
does
he
come
round
eating
locusts
and
wild
*NL*
honey
.
I
doubt
if
Flying
Childers
ever
carried
a
peck
of
corn
to
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
says
to
me
,
``
I
wonder
that
you
do
not
lay
up
money
;
you
love
to
*NL*
travel
;
you
might
take
the
cars
and
go
to
Fitchburg
today
and
see
the
*NL*
country
.
''
But
I
am
wiser
than
that
.
I
have
learned
that
the
swiftest
*NL*
traveller
is
he
that
goes
afoot
.
I
say
to
my
friend
,
Suppose
we
try
*NL*
who
will
get
there
first
.
The
distance
is
thirty
miles
;
the
fare
ninety
*NL*
cents
.
That
is
almost
a
day
's
wages
.
I
remember
when
wages
were
sixty
*NL*
cents
a
day
for
laborers
on
this
very
road
.
Well
,
I
start
now
on
foot
,
*NL*
and
get
there
before
night
;
I
have
travelled
at
that
rate
by
the
week
*NL*
together
.
You
will
in
the
meanwhile
have
earned
your
fare
,
and
arrive
*NL*
there
some
time
tomorrow
,
or
possibly
this
evening
,
if
you
are
lucky
*NL*
enough
to
get
a
job
in
season
.
Instead
of
going
to
Fitchburg
,
you
will
*NL*
be
working
here
the
greater
part
of
the
day
.
And
so
,
if
the
railroad
*NL*
reached
round
the
world
,
I
think
that
I
should
keep
ahead
of
you
;
and
*NL*
as
for
seeing
the
country
and
getting
experience
of
that
kind
,
I
should
*NL*
have
to
cut
your
acquaintance
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
universal
law
,
which
no
man
can
ever
outwit
,
and
with
regard
*NL*
to
the
railroad
even
we
may
say
it
is
as
broad
as
it
is
long
.
To
make
*NL*
a
railroad
round
the
world
available
to
all
mankind
is
equivalent
to
*NL*
grading
the
whole
surface
of
the
planet
.
Men
have
an
indistinct
notion
*NL*
that
if
they
keep
up
this
activity
of
joint
stocks
and
spades
long
*NL*
enough
all
will
at
length
ride
somewhere
,
in
next
to
no
time
,
and
for
*NL*
nothing
;
but
though
a
crowd
rushes
to
the
depot
,
and
the
conductor
*NL*
shouts
``
All
aboard
!
''
when
the
smoke
is
blown
away
and
the
vapor
*NL*
condensed
,
it
will
be
perceived
that
a
few
are
riding
,
but
the
rest
are
*NL*
run
over
--
and
it
will
be
called
,
and
will
be
,
``
A
melancholy
accident
.
''
*NL*
No
doubt
they
can
ride
at
last
who
shall
have
earned
their
fare
,
that
*NL*
is
,
if
they
survive
so
long
,
but
they
will
probably
have
lost
their
*NL*
elasticity
and
desire
to
travel
by
that
time
.
This
spending
of
the
*NL*
best
part
of
one
's
life
earning
money
in
order
to
enjoy
a
questionable
*NL*
liberty
during
the
least
valuable
part
of
it
reminds
me
of
the
*NL*
Englishman
who
went
to
India
to
make
a
fortune
first
,
in
order
that
he
*NL*
might
return
to
England
and
live
the
life
of
a
poet
.
He
should
have
gone
*NL*
up
garret
at
once
.
``
What
!
''
exclaim
a
million
Irishmen
starting
up
from
*NL*
all
the
shanties
in
the
land
,
``
is
not
this
railroad
which
we
have
built
*NL*
a
good
thing
?
''
Yes
,
I
answer
,
comparatively
good
,
that
is
,
you
might
*NL*
have
done
worse
;
but
I
wish
,
as
you
are
brothers
of
mine
,
that
you
could
*NL*
have
spent
your
time
better
than
digging
in
this
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*

*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
finished
my
house
,
wishing
to
earn
ten
or
twelve
dollars
by
*NL*
some
honest
and
agreeable
method
,
in
order
to
meet
my
unusual
expenses
,
*NL*
I
planted
about
two
acres
and
a
half
of
light
and
sandy
soil
near
it
*NL*
chiefly
with
beans
,
but
also
a
small
part
with
potatoes
,
corn
,
peas
,
and
*NL*
turnips
.
The
whole
lot
contains
eleven
acres
,
mostly
growing
up
to
pines
*NL*
and
hickories
,
and
was
sold
the
preceding
season
for
eight
dollars
and
*NL*
eight
cents
an
acre
.
One
farmer
said
that
it
was
``
good
for
nothing
but
*NL*
to
raise
cheeping
squirrels
on
.
''
I
put
no
manure
whatever
on
this
*NL*
land
,
not
being
the
owner
,
but
merely
a
squatter
,
and
not
expecting
to
*NL*
cultivate
so
much
again
,
and
I
did
not
quite
hoe
it
all
once
.
I
got
out
*NL*
several
cords
of
stumps
in
plowing
,
which
supplied
me
with
fuel
for
*NL*
a
long
time
,
and
left
small
circles
of
virgin
mould
,
easily
*NL*
distinguishable
through
the
summer
by
the
greater
luxuriance
of
the
*NL*
beans
there
.
The
dead
and
for
the
most
part
unmerchantable
wood
behind
*NL*
my
house
,
and
the
driftwood
from
the
pond
,
have
supplied
the
remainder
*NL*
of
my
fuel
.
I
was
obliged
to
hire
a
team
and
a
man
for
the
plowing
,
*NL*
though
I
held
the
plow
myself
.
My
farm
outgoes
for
the
first
season
*NL*
were
,
for
implements
,
seed
,
work
,
etc.
,
$
14.72-1
/
2
.
The
seed
corn
was
given
*NL*
me
.
This
never
costs
anything
to
speak
of
,
unless
you
plant
more
than
*NL*
enough
.
I
got
twelve
bushels
of
beans
,
and
eighteen
bushels
of
potatoes
,
*NL*
beside
some
peas
and
sweet
corn
.
The
yellow
corn
and
turnips
were
too
*NL*
late
to
come
to
anything
.
My
whole
income
from
the
farm
was
*NL*
*NL*
$
23.44
*NL*
Deducting
the
outgoes

*NL*
*NL*
beside
produce
consumed
and
on
hand
at
the
time
this
estimate
was
made
*NL*
of
the
value
of
$
4.50
--
the
amount
on
hand
much
more
than
balancing
a
*NL*
little
grass
which
I
did
not
raise
.
All
things
considered
,
that
is
,
*NL*
considering
the
importance
of
a
man
's
soul
and
of
today
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
short
time
occupied
by
my
experiment
,
nay
,
partly
even
because
of
*NL*
its
transient
character
,
I
believe
that
that
was
doing
better
than
any
*NL*
farmer
in
Concord
did
that
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
year
I
did
better
still
,
for
I
spaded
up
all
the
land
which
I
*NL*
required
,
about
a
third
of
an
acre
,
and
I
learned
from
the
experience
*NL*
of
both
years
,
not
being
in
the
least
awed
by
many
celebrated
works
on
*NL*
husbandry
,
Arthur
Young
among
the
rest
,
that
if
one
would
live
simply
*NL*
and
eat
only
the
crop
which
he
raised
,
and
raise
no
more
than
he
ate
,
*NL*
and
not
exchange
it
for
an
insufficient
quantity
of
more
luxurious
and
*NL*
expensive
things
,
he
would
need
to
cultivate
only
a
few
rods
of
ground
,
*NL*
and
that
it
would
be
cheaper
to
spade
up
that
than
to
use
oxen
to
plow
*NL*
it
,
and
to
select
a
fresh
spot
from
time
to
time
than
to
manure
the
old
,
*NL*
and
he
could
do
all
his
necessary
farm
work
as
it
were
with
his
left
*NL*
hand
at
odd
hours
in
the
summer
;
and
thus
he
would
not
be
tied
to
an
ox
,
*NL*
or
horse
,
or
cow
,
or
pig
,
as
at
present
.
I
desire
to
speak
impartially
*NL*
on
this
point
,
and
as
one
not
interested
in
the
success
or
failure
of
*NL*
the
present
economical
and
social
arrangements
.
I
was
more
independent
*NL*
than
any
farmer
in
Concord
,
for
I
was
not
anchored
to
a
house
or
farm
,
*NL*
but
could
follow
the
bent
of
my
genius
,
which
is
a
very
crooked
one
,
*NL*
every
moment
.
Beside
being
better
off
than
they
already
,
if
my
house
had
*NL*
been
burned
or
my
crops
had
failed
,
I
should
have
been
nearly
as
well
*NL*
off
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
wont
to
think
that
men
are
not
so
much
the
keepers
of
herds
as
*NL*
herds
are
the
keepers
of
men
,
the
former
are
so
much
the
freer
.
Men
and
*NL*
oxen
exchange
work
;
but
if
we
consider
necessary
work
only
,
the
oxen
*NL*
will
be
seen
to
have
greatly
the
advantage
,
their
farm
is
so
much
the
*NL*
larger
.
Man
does
some
of
his
part
of
the
exchange
work
in
his
six
weeks
*NL*
of
haying
,
and
it
is
no
boy
's
play
.
Certainly
no
nation
that
lived
*NL*
simply
in
all
respects
,
that
is
,
no
nation
of
philosophers
,
would
commit
*NL*
so
great
a
blunder
as
to
use
the
labor
of
animals
.
True
,
there
never
was
*NL*
and
is
not
likely
soon
to
be
a
nation
of
philosophers
,
nor
am
I
certain
*NL*
it
is
desirable
that
there
should
be
.
However
,
_
I
_
should
never
have
*NL*
broken
a
horse
or
bull
and
taken
him
to
board
for
any
work
he
might
do
*NL*
for
me
,
for
fear
I
should
become
a
horseman
or
a
herdsman
merely
;
and
if
*NL*
society
seems
to
be
the
gainer
by
so
doing
,
are
we
certain
that
what
is
*NL*
one
man
's
gain
is
not
another
's
loss
,
and
that
the
stable-boy
has
equal
*NL*
cause
with
his
master
to
be
satisfied
?
Granted
that
some
public
works
*NL*
would
not
have
been
constructed
without
this
aid
,
and
let
man
share
the
*NL*
glory
of
such
with
the
ox
and
horse
;
does
it
follow
that
he
could
not
*NL*
have
accomplished
works
yet
more
worthy
of
himself
in
that
case
?
When
*NL*
men
begin
to
do
,
not
merely
unnecessary
or
artistic
,
but
luxurious
and
*NL*
idle
work
,
with
their
assistance
,
it
is
inevitable
that
a
few
do
all
the
*NL*
exchange
work
with
the
oxen
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
become
the
slaves
of
*NL*
the
strongest
.
Man
thus
not
only
works
for
the
animal
within
him
,
but
,
*NL*
for
a
symbol
of
this
,
he
works
for
the
animal
without
him
.
Though
we
*NL*
have
many
substantial
houses
of
brick
or
stone
,
the
prosperity
of
the
*NL*
farmer
is
still
measured
by
the
degree
to
which
the
barn
overshadows
the
*NL*
house
.
This
town
is
said
to
have
the
largest
houses
for
oxen
,
cows
,
and
*NL*
horses
hereabouts
,
and
it
is
not
behindhand
in
its
public
buildings
;
but
*NL*
there
are
very
few
halls
for
free
worship
or
free
speech
in
this
county
.
*NL*
It
should
not
be
by
their
architecture
,
but
why
not
even
by
their
power
*NL*
of
abstract
thought
,
that
nations
should
seek
to
commemorate
themselves
?
*NL*
How
much
more
admirable
the
Bhagvat-Geeta
than
all
the
ruins
of
the
*NL*
East
!
Towers
and
temples
are
the
luxury
of
princes
.
A
simple
and
*NL*
independent
mind
does
not
toil
at
the
bidding
of
any
prince
.
Genius
is
*NL*
not
a
retainer
to
any
emperor
,
nor
is
its
material
silver
,
or
gold
,
or
*NL*
marble
,
except
to
a
trifling
extent
.
To
what
end
,
pray
,
is
so
much
stone
*NL*
hammered
?
In
Arcadia
,
when
I
was
there
,
I
did
not
see
any
hammering
*NL*
stone
.
Nations
are
possessed
with
an
insane
ambition
to
perpetuate
the
*NL*
memory
of
themselves
by
the
amount
of
hammered
stone
they
leave
.
What
if
*NL*
equal
pains
were
taken
to
smooth
and
polish
their
manners
?
One
piece
of
*NL*
good
sense
would
be
more
memorable
than
a
monument
as
high
as
the
moon
.
*NL*
I
love
better
to
see
stones
in
place
.
The
grandeur
of
Thebes
was
a
*NL*
vulgar
grandeur
.
More
sensible
is
a
rod
of
stone
wall
that
bounds
an
*NL*
honest
man
's
field
than
a
hundred-gated
Thebes
that
has
wandered
farther
*NL*
from
the
true
end
of
life
.
The
religion
and
civilization
which
are
*NL*
barbaric
and
heathenish
build
splendid
temples
;
but
what
you
might
call
*NL*
Christianity
does
not
.
Most
of
the
stone
a
nation
hammers
goes
toward
*NL*
its
tomb
only
.
It
buries
itself
alive
.
As
for
the
Pyramids
,
there
is
*NL*
nothing
to
wonder
at
in
them
so
much
as
the
fact
that
so
many
men
could
*NL*
be
found
degraded
enough
to
spend
their
lives
constructing
a
tomb
for
*NL*
some
ambitious
booby
,
whom
it
would
have
been
wiser
and
manlier
to
*NL*
have
drowned
in
the
Nile
,
and
then
given
his
body
to
the
dogs
.
I
might
*NL*
possibly
invent
some
excuse
for
them
and
him
,
but
I
have
no
time
for
it
.
*NL*
As
for
the
religion
and
love
of
art
of
the
builders
,
it
is
much
the
same
*NL*
all
the
world
over
,
whether
the
building
be
an
Egyptian
temple
or
the
*NL*
United
States
Bank
.
It
costs
more
than
it
comes
to
.
The
mainspring
is
*NL*
vanity
,
assisted
by
the
love
of
garlic
and
bread
and
butter
.
Mr.
Balcom
,
*NL*
a
promising
young
architect
,
designs
it
on
the
back
of
his
Vitruvius
,
*NL*
with
hard
pencil
and
ruler
,
and
the
job
is
let
out
to
Dobson
&
Sons
,
*NL*
stonecutters
.
When
the
thirty
centuries
begin
to
look
down
on
it
,
*NL*
mankind
begin
to
look
up
at
it
.
As
for
your
high
towers
and
monuments
,
*NL*
there
was
a
crazy
fellow
once
in
this
town
who
undertook
to
dig
through
*NL*
to
China
,
and
he
got
so
far
that
,
as
he
said
,
he
heard
the
Chinese
pots
*NL*
and
kettles
rattle
;
but
I
think
that
I
shall
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
*NL*
admire
the
hole
which
he
made
.
Many
are
concerned
about
the
monuments
*NL*
of
the
West
and
the
East
--
to
know
who
built
them
.
For
my
part
,
I
should
*NL*
like
to
know
who
in
those
days
did
not
build
them
--
who
were
above
such
*NL*
trifling
.
But
to
proceed
with
my
statistics
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
surveying
,
carpentry
,
and
day-labor
of
various
other
kinds
in
the
*NL*
village
in
the
meanwhile
,
for
I
have
as
many
trades
as
fingers
,
I
had
*NL*
earned

The

sometimes

*NL*
once
I
went
so
far
as
to
slaughter
a
woodchuck
which
ravaged
my
*NL*
bean-field
--

transmigration
,
as
a
Tartar
would
say
--
and
devour
*NL*
him
,
partly
for

sake
;
but
though
it
afforded
me
a
momentary
*NL*
enjoyment
,
notwithstanding
a

I
saw
that

*NL*
on

this
being
very
nearly
the

started
,
and
the
measure
of
expenses
to
be
incurred
--
and
on
the
*NL*
other
,
beside
the
leisure
and
independence
and
health
thus
secured
,
a
*NL*
comfortable
house
for
me
as
long
as
I
choose
to
occupy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
statistics
,
however
accidental
and
therefore
uninstructive
they
*NL*
may
appear
,
as
they
have
a
certain
completeness
,
have
a
certain
value
*NL*
also
.
Nothing
was
given
me
of
which
I
have
not
rendered
some
account
.
*NL*
It
appears
from
the
above
estimate
,
that
my
food
alone
cost
me
in
money
*NL*
about
twenty-seven
cents
a
week
.
It
was
,
for
nearly
two
years
after
*NL*
this
,
rye
and
Indian
meal
without
yeast
,
potatoes
,
rice
,
a
very
little
*NL*
salt
pork
,
molasses
,
and
salt
;
and
my
drink
,
water
.
It
was
fit
that
I
*NL*
should
live
on
rice
,
mainly
,
who
love
so
well
the
philosophy
of
India
.
*NL*
To
meet
the
objections
of
some
inveterate
cavillers
,
I
may
as
well
*NL*
state
,
that
if
I
dined
out
occasionally
,
as
I
always
had
done
,
and
I
*NL*
trust
shall
have
opportunities
to
do
again
,
it
was
frequently
to
the
*NL*
detriment
of
my
domestic
arrangements
.
But
the
dining
out
,
being
,
as
*NL*
I
have
stated
,
a
constant
element
,
does
not
in
the
least
affect
a
*NL*
comparative
statement
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
learned
from
my
two
years
'
experience
that
it
would
cost
incredibly
*NL*
little
trouble
to
obtain
one
's
necessary
food
,
even
in
this
latitude
;
*NL*
that
a
man
may
use
as
simple
a
diet
as
the
animals
,
and
yet
retain
*NL*
health
and
strength
.
I
have
made
a
satisfactory
dinner
,
satisfactory
*NL*
on
several
accounts
,
simply
off
a
dish
of
purslane
-LRB-
_
Portulaca
oleracea
_
-RRB-
*NL*
which
I
gathered
in
my
cornfield
,
boiled
and
salted
.
I
give
the
Latin
on
*NL*
account
of
the
savoriness
of
the
trivial
name
.
And
pray
what
more
can
*NL*
a
reasonable
man
desire
,
in
peaceful
times
,
in
ordinary
noons
,
than
a
*NL*
sufficient
number
of
ears
of
green
sweet
corn
boiled
,
with
the
addition
*NL*
of
salt
?
Even
the
little
variety
which
I
used
was
a
yielding
to
the
*NL*
demands
of
appetite
,
and
not
of
health
.
Yet
men
have
come
to
such
a
pass
*NL*
that
they
frequently
starve
,
not
for
want
of
necessaries
,
but
for
want
*NL*
of
luxuries
;
and
I
know
a
good
woman
who
thinks
that
her
son
lost
his
*NL*
life
because
he
took
to
drinking
water
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
perceive
that
I
am
treating
the
subject
rather
from
an
*NL*
economic
than
a
dietetic
point
of
view
,
and
he
will
not
venture
to
put
*NL*
my
abstemiousness
to
the
test
unless
he
has
a
well-stocked
larder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bread
I
at
first
made
of
pure
Indian
meal
and
salt
,
genuine
hoe-cakes
,
*NL*
which
I
baked
before
my
fire
out
of
doors
on
a
shingle
or
the
end
of
a
*NL*
stick
of
timber
sawed
off
in
building
my
house
;
but
it
was
wont
to
get
*NL*
smoked
and
to
have
a
piny
flavor
.
I
tried
flour
also
;
but
have
at
last
*NL*
found
a
mixture
of
rye
and
Indian
meal
most
convenient
and
agreeable
.
In
*NL*
cold
weather
it
was
no
little
amusement
to
bake
several
small
loaves
of
*NL*
this
in
succession
,
tending
and
turning
them
as
carefully
as
an
Egyptian
*NL*
his
hatching
eggs
.
They
were
a
real
cereal
fruit
which
I
ripened
,
and
*NL*
they
had
to
my
senses
a
fragrance
like
that
of
other
noble
fruits
,
which
*NL*
I
kept
in
as
long
as
possible
by
wrapping
them
in
cloths
.
I
made
a
study
*NL*
of
the
ancient
and
indispensable
art
of
bread-making
,
consulting
such
*NL*
authorities
as
offered
,
going
back
to
the
primitive
days
and
first
*NL*
invention
of
the
unleavened
kind
,
when
from
the
wildness
of
nuts
and
*NL*
meats
men
first
reached
the
mildness
and
refinement
of
this
diet
,
and
*NL*
travelling
gradually
down
in
my
studies
through
that
accidental
souring
*NL*
of
the
dough
which
,
it
is
supposed
,
taught
the
leavening
process
,
and
*NL*
through
the
various
fermentations
thereafter
,
till
I
came
to
``
good
,
*NL*
sweet
,
wholesome
bread
,
''
the
staff
of
life
.
Leaven
,
which
some
deem
the
*NL*
soul
of
bread
,
the
_
spiritus
_
which
fills
its
cellular
tissue
,
which
is
*NL*
religiously
preserved
like
the
vestal
fire
--
some
precious
bottleful
,
*NL*
I
suppose
,
first
brought
over
in
the
Mayflower
,
did
the
business
for
*NL*
America
,
and
its
influence
is
still
rising
,
swelling
,
spreading
,
in
*NL*
cerealian
billows
over
the
land
--
this
seed
I
regularly
and
faithfully
*NL*
procured
from
the
village
,
till
at
length
one
morning
I
forgot
the
*NL*
rules
,
and
scalded
my
yeast
;
by
which
accident
I
discovered
that
even
*NL*
this
was
not
indispensable
--
for
my
discoveries
were
not
by
the
synthetic
*NL*
but
analytic
process
--
and
I
have
gladly
omitted
it
since
,
though
most
*NL*
housewives
earnestly
assured
me
that
safe
and
wholesome
bread
without
*NL*
yeast
might
not
be
,
and
elderly
people
prophesied
a
speedy
decay
of
the
*NL*
vital
forces
.
Yet
I
find
it
not
to
be
an
essential
ingredient
,
and
after
*NL*
going
without
it
for
a
year
am
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
;
and
I
*NL*
am
glad
to
escape
the
trivialness
of
carrying
a
bottleful
in
my
pocket
,
*NL*
which
would
sometimes
pop
and
discharge
its
contents
to
my
discomfiture
.
*NL*
It
is
simpler
and
more
respectable
to
omit
it
.
Man
is
an
animal
who
*NL*
more
than
any
other
can
adapt
himself
to
all
climates
and
circumstances
.
*NL*
Neither
did
I
put
any
sal-soda
,
or
other
acid
or
alkali
,
into
my
bread
.
*NL*
It
would
seem
that
I
made
it
according
to
the
recipe
which
Marcus
*NL*
Porcius
Cato
gave
about
two
centuries
before
Christ
.
``
Panem

thoroughly
.
When
you

*NL*
kneaded

well
,
mould
it
,
and
bake

under

cover
,
''
that
is
,
in
a
*NL*
baking
kettle
.
Not
a
word
about
leaven
.
But
I
did
not
always
use
this
*NL*
staff
of
life
.
At
one
time
,
owing
to
the
emptiness
of
my
purse
,
I
saw
*NL*
none
of
it
for
more
than
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
New
Englander
might
easily
raise
all
his
own
breadstuffs
in
this
*NL*
land
of
rye
and
Indian
corn
,
and
not
depend
on
distant
and
fluctuating
*NL*
markets
for
them
.
Yet
so
far
are
we
from
simplicity
and
independence
*NL*
that
,
in
Concord
,
fresh
and
sweet
meal
is
rarely
sold
in
the
shops
,
and
*NL*
hominy
and
corn
in
a
still
coarser
form
are
hardly
used
by
any
.
For
the
*NL*
most
part
the
farmer
gives
to
his
cattle
and
hogs
the
grain
of
his
own
*NL*
producing
,
and
buys
flour
,
which
is
at
least
no
more
wholesome
,
at
a
*NL*
greater
cost
,
at
the
store
.
I
saw
that
I
could
easily
raise
my
bushel
*NL*
or
two
of
rye
and
Indian
corn
,
for
the
former
will
grow
on
the
poorest
*NL*
land
,
and
the
latter
does
not
require
the
best
,
and
grind
them
in
a
*NL*
hand-mill
,
and
so
do
without
rice
and
pork
;
and
if
I
must
have
some
*NL*
concentrated
sweet
,
I
found
by
experiment
that
I
could
make
a
very
good
*NL*
molasses
either
of
pumpkins
or
beets
,
and
I
knew
that
I
needed
only
to
*NL*
set
out
a
few
maples
to
obtain
it
more
easily
still
,
and
while
these
*NL*
were
growing
I
could
use
various
substitutes
beside
those
which
I
have
*NL*
named
.
``
For
,
''
as
the
Forefathers
sang
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
we
can
make
liquor
to
sweeten
our
lips
*NL*
Of
pumpkins
and
parsnips
and
walnut-tree
chips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
as
for
salt
,
that
grossest
of
groceries
,
to
obtain
this
might
*NL*
be
a
fit
occasion
for
a
visit
to
the
seashore
,
or
,
if
I
did
without
it
*NL*
altogether
,
I
should
probably
drink
the
less
water
.
I
do
not
learn
that
*NL*
the
Indians
ever
troubled
themselves
to
go
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
I
could
avoid
all
trade
and
barter
,
so
far
as
my
food
was
*NL*
concerned
,
and
having
a
shelter
already
,
it
would
only
remain
to
get
*NL*
clothing
and
fuel
.
The
pantaloons
which
I
now
wear
were
woven
in
a
*NL*
farmer
's
family
--
thank
Heaven
there
is
so
much
virtue
still
in
man
;
for
*NL*
I
think
the
fall
from
the
farmer
to
the
operative
as
great
and
memorable
*NL*
as
that
from
the
man
to
the
farmer
;
--
and
in
a
new
country
,
fuel
is
an
*NL*
encumbrance
.
As
for
a
habitat
,
if
I
were
not
permitted
still
to
squat
,
*NL*
I
might
purchase
one
acre
at
the
same
price
for
which
the
land
I
*NL*
cultivated
was
sold
--
namely
,
eight
dollars
and
eight
cents
.
But
as
it
*NL*
was
,
I
considered
that
I
enhanced
the
value
of
the
land
by
squatting
on
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
certain
class
of
unbelievers
who
sometimes
ask
me
such
*NL*
questions
as
,
if
I
think
that
I
can
live
on
vegetable
food
alone
;
and
*NL*
to
strike
at
the
root
of
the
matter
at
once
--
for
the
root
is
faith
--
I
*NL*
am
accustomed
to
answer
such
,
that
I
can
live
on
board
nails
.
If
they
*NL*
can
not
understand
that
,
they
can
not
understand
much
that
I
have
to
say
.
*NL*
For
my
part
,
I
am
glad
to
hear
of
experiments
of
this
kind
being
tried
;
*NL*
as
that
a
young
man
tried
for
a
fortnight
to
live
on
hard
,
raw
corn
on
*NL*
the
ear
,
using
his
teeth
for
all
mortar
.
The
squirrel
tribe
tried
the
*NL*
same
and
succeeded
.
The
human
race
is
interested
in
these
experiments
,
*NL*
though
a
few
old
women
who
are
incapacitated
for
them
,
or
who
own
their
*NL*
thirds
in
mills
,
may
be
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
My
furniture
,
part
of
which
I
made
myself
--
and
the
rest
cost
me
nothing
*NL*
of
which
I
have
not
rendered
an
account
--
consisted
of
a
bed
,
a
table
,
a
*NL*
desk
,
three
chairs
,
a
looking-glass
three
inches
in
diameter
,
a
pair
of
*NL*
tongs
and
andirons
,
a
kettle
,
a
skillet
,
and
a
frying-pan
,
a
dipper
,
a
*NL*
wash-bowl
,
two
knives
and
forks
,
three
plates
,
one
cup
,
one
spoon
,
a
jug
*NL*
for
oil
,
a
jug
for
molasses
,
and
a
japanned
lamp
.
None
is
so
poor
that
*NL*
he
need
sit
on
a
pumpkin
.
That
is
shiftlessness
.
There
is
a
plenty
of
*NL*
such
chairs
as
I
like
best
in
the
village
garrets
to
be
had
for
taking
*NL*
them
away
.
Furniture
!
Thank
God
,
I
can
sit
and
I
can
stand
without
the
*NL*
aid
of
a
furniture
warehouse
.
What
man
but
a
philosopher
would
not
*NL*
be
ashamed
to
see
his
furniture
packed
in
a
cart
and
going
up
country
*NL*
exposed
to
the
light
of
heaven
and
the
eyes
of
men
,
a
beggarly
account
*NL*
of
empty
boxes
?
That
is
Spaulding
's
furniture
.
I
could
never
tell
from
*NL*
inspecting
such
a
load
whether
it
belonged
to
a
so-called
rich
man
or
a
*NL*
poor
one
;
the
owner
always
seemed
poverty-stricken
.
Indeed
,
the
more
*NL*
you
have
of
such
things
the
poorer
you
are
.
Each
load
looks
as
if
it
*NL*
contained
the
contents
of
a
dozen
shanties
;
and
if
one
shanty
is
poor
,
*NL*
this
is
a
dozen
times
as
poor
.
Pray
,
for
what
do
we
_
move
_
ever
but
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
our
furniture
,
our
_
exuviA
|
_
:
at
last
to
go
from
this
world
to
*NL*
another
newly
furnished
,
and
leave
this
to
be
burned
?
It
is
the
same
as
*NL*
if
all
these
traps
were
buckled
to
a
man
's
belt
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
move
over
the
rough
country
where
our
lines
are
cast
without
dragging
*NL*
them
--
dragging
his
trap
.
He
was
a
lucky
fox
that
left
his
tail
in
the
*NL*
trap
.
The
muskrat
will
gnaw
his
third
leg
off
to
be
free
.
No
wonder
man
*NL*
has
lost
his
elasticity
.
How
often
he
is
at
a
dead
set
!
``
Sir
,
if
I
may
*NL*
be
so
bold
,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
dead
set
?
''
If
you
are
a
seer
,
whenever
*NL*
you
meet
a
man
you
will
see
all
that
he
owns
,
ay
,
and
much
that
he
*NL*
pretends
to
disown
,
behind
him
,
even
to
his
kitchen
furniture
and
all
*NL*
the
trumpery
which
he
saves
and
will
not
burn
,
and
he
will
appear
to
be
*NL*
harnessed
to
it
and
making
what
headway
he
can
.
I
think
that
the
man
*NL*
is
at
a
dead
set
who
has
got
through
a
knot-hole
or
gateway
where
his
*NL*
sledge
load
of
furniture
can
not
follow
him
.
I
can
not
but
feel
compassion
*NL*
when
I
hear
some
trig
,
compact-looking
man
,
seemingly
free
,
all
girded
*NL*
and
ready
,
speak
of
his
``
furniture
,
''
as
whether
it
is
insured
or
not
.
*NL*
``
But
what
shall
I
do
with
my
furniture
?
''
--
My
gay
butterfly
is
entangled
*NL*
in
a
spider
's
web
then
.
Even
those
who
seem
for
a
long
while
not
to
*NL*
have
any
,
if
you
inquire
more
narrowly
you
will
find
have
some
stored
*NL*
in
somebody
's
barn
.
I
look
upon
England
today
as
an
old
gentleman
who
is
*NL*
travelling
with
a
great
deal
of
baggage
,
trumpery
which
has
accumulated
*NL*
from
long
housekeeping
,
which
he
has
not
the
courage
to
burn
;
great
*NL*
trunk
,
little
trunk
,
bandbox
,
and
bundle
.
Throw
away
the
first
three
at
*NL*
least
.
It
would
surpass
the
powers
of
a
well
man
nowadays
to
take
up
his
*NL*
bed
and
walk
,
and
I
should
certainly
advise
a
sick
one
to
lay
down
his
*NL*
bed
and
run
.
When
I
have
met
an
immigrant
tottering
under
a
bundle
which
*NL*
contained
his
all
--
looking
like
an
enormous
wen
which
had
grown
out
of
*NL*
the
nape
of
his
neck
--
I
have
pitied
him
,
not
because
that
was
his
all
,
*NL*
but
because
he
had
all
_
that
_
to
carry
.
If
I
have
got
to
drag
my
trap
,
I
*NL*
will
take
care
that
it
be
a
light
one
and
do
not
nip
me
in
a
vital
part
.
*NL*
But
perchance
it
would
be
wisest
never
to
put
one
's
paw
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
observe
,
by
the
way
,
that
it
costs
me
nothing
for
curtains
,
for
*NL*
I
have
no
gazers
to
shut
out
but
the
sun
and
moon
,
and
I
am
willing
that
*NL*
they
should
look
in
.
The
moon
will
not
sour
milk
nor
taint
meat
of
mine
,
*NL*
nor
will
the
sun
injure
my
furniture
or
fade
my
carpet
;
and
if
he
is
*NL*
sometimes
too
warm
a
friend
,
I
find
it
still
better
economy
to
retreat
*NL*
behind
some
curtain
which
nature
has
provided
,
than
to
add
a
single
item
*NL*
to
the
details
of
housekeeping
.
A
lady
once
offered
me
a
mat
,
but
as
*NL*
I
had
no
room
to
spare
within
the
house
,
nor
time
to
spare
within
or
*NL*
without
to
shake
it
,
I
declined
it
,
preferring
to
wipe
my
feet
on
the
*NL*
sod
before
my
door
.
It
is
best
to
avoid
the
beginnings
of
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
since
I
was
present
at
the
auction
of
a
deacon
's
effects
,
for
*NL*
his
life
had
not
been
ineffectual
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
evil
that
men
do
lives
after
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
,
a
great
proportion
was
trumpery
which
had
begun
to
accumulate
*NL*
in
his
father
's
day
.
Among
the
rest
was
a
dried
tapeworm
.
And
now
,
after
*NL*
lying
half
a
century
in
his
garret
and
other
dust
holes
,
these
things
*NL*
were
not
burned
;
instead
of
a
_
bonfire
_
,
or
purifying
destruction
of
*NL*
them
,
there
was
an
_
auction
_
,
or
increasing
of
them
.
The
neighbors
eagerly
*NL*
collected
to
view
them
,
bought
them
all
,
and
carefully
transported
them
*NL*
to
their
garrets
and
dust
holes
,
to
lie
there
till
their
estates
are
*NL*
settled
,
when
they
will
start
again
.
When
a
man
dies
he
kicks
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
customs
of
some
savage
nations
might
,
perchance
,
be
profitably
*NL*
imitated
by
us
,
for
they
at
least
go
through
the
semblance
of
casting
*NL*
their
slough
annually
;
they
have
the
idea
of
the
thing
,
whether
they
*NL*
have
the
reality
or
not
.
Would
it
not
be
well
if
we
were
to
celebrate
*NL*
such
a
``
busk
,
''
or
``
feast
of
first
fruits
,
''
as
Bartram
describes
to
have
*NL*
been
the
custom
of
the
Mucclasse
Indians
?
``
When
a
town
celebrates
the
*NL*
busk
,
''
says
he
,
``
having
previously
provided
themselves
with
new
clothes
,
*NL*
new
pots
,
pans
,
and
other
household
utensils
and
furniture
,
they
collect
*NL*
all
their
worn
out
clothes
and
other
despicable
things
,
sweep
and
*NL*
cleanse
their
houses
,
squares
,
and
the
whole
town
of
their
filth
,
which
*NL*
with
all
the
remaining
grain
and
other
old
provisions
they
cast
together
*NL*
into
one
common
heap
,
and
consume
it
with
fire
.
After
having
taken
*NL*
medicine
,
and
fasted
for
three
days
,
all
the
fire
in
the
town
is
*NL*
extinguished
.
During
this
fast
they
abstain
from
the
gratification
of
*NL*
every
appetite
and
passion
whatever
.
A
general
amnesty
is
proclaimed
;
*NL*
all
malefactors
may
return
to
their
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
fourth
morning
,
the
high
priest
,
by
rubbing
dry
wood
together
,
*NL*
produces
new
fire
in
the
public
square
,
from
whence
every
habitation
in
*NL*
the
town
is
supplied
with
the
new
and
pure
flame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
feast
on
the
new
corn
and
fruits
,
and
dance
and
sing
for
three
*NL*
days
,
``
and
the
four
following
days
they
receive
visits
and
rejoice
with
*NL*
their
friends
from
neighboring
towns
who
have
in
like
manner
purified
*NL*
and
prepared
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mexicans
also
practised
a
similar
purification
at
the
end
of
every
*NL*
fifty-two
years
,
in
the
belief
that
it
was
time
for
the
world
to
come
to
*NL*
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
scarcely
heard
of
a
truer
sacrament
,
that
is
,
as
the
dictionary
*NL*
defines
it
,
``
outward
and
visible
sign
of
an
inward
and
spiritual
grace
,
''
*NL*
than
this
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
they
were
originally
inspired
*NL*
directly
from
Heaven
to
do
thus
,
though
they
have
no
Biblical
record
of
*NL*
the
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
For
more
than
five
years
I
maintained
myself
thus
solely
by
the
labor
*NL*
of
my
hands
,
and
I
found
that
,
by
working
about
six
weeks
in
a
year
,
I
*NL*
could
meet
all
the
expenses
of
living
.
The
whole
of
my
winters
,
as
well
*NL*
as
most
of
my
summers
,
I
had
free
and
clear
for
study
.
I
have
thoroughly
*NL*
tried
school-keeping
,
and
found
that
my
expenses
were
in
proportion
,
or
*NL*
rather
out
of
proportion
,
to
my
income
,
for
I
was
obliged
to
dress
and
*NL*
train
,
not
to
say
think
and
believe
,
accordingly
,
and
I
lost
my
time
*NL*
into
the
bargain
.
As
I
did
not
teach
for
the
good
of
my
fellow-men
,
but
*NL*
simply
for
a
livelihood
,
this
was
a
failure
.
I
have
tried
trade
but
I
*NL*
found
that
it
would
take
ten
years
to
get
under
way
in
that
,
and
that
*NL*
then
I
should
probably
be
on
my
way
to
the
devil
.
I
was
actually
afraid
*NL*
that
I
might
by
that
time
be
doing
what
is
called
a
good
business
.
When
*NL*
formerly
I
was
looking
about
to
see
what
I
could
do
for
a
living
,
some
*NL*
sad
experience
in
conforming
to
the
wishes
of
friends
being
fresh
in
*NL*
my
mind
to
tax
my
ingenuity
,
I
thought
often
and
seriously
of
picking
*NL*
huckleberries
;
that
surely
I
could
do
,
and
its
small
profits
might
*NL*
suffice
--
for
my
greatest
skill
has
been
to
want
but
little
--
so
little
*NL*
capital
it
required
,
so
little
distraction
from
my
wonted
moods
,
I
*NL*
foolishly
thought
.
While
my
acquaintances
went
unhesitatingly
into
trade
*NL*
or
the
professions
,
I
contemplated
this
occupation
as
most
like
theirs
;
*NL*
ranging
the
hills
all
summer
to
pick
the
berries
which
came
in
my
way
,
*NL*
and
thereafter
carelessly
dispose
of
them
;
so
,
to
keep
the
flocks
of
*NL*
Admetus
.
I
also
dreamed
that
I
might
gather
the
wild
herbs
,
or
carry
*NL*
evergreens
to
such
villagers
as
loved
to
be
reminded
of
the
woods
,
even
*NL*
to
the
city
,
by
hay-cart
loads
.
But
I
have
since
learned
that
trade
*NL*
curses
everything
it
handles
;
and
though
you
trade
in
messages
from
*NL*
heaven
,
the
whole
curse
of
trade
attaches
to
the
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
preferred
some
things
to
others
,
and
especially
valued
my
freedom
,
*NL*
as
I
could
fare
hard
and
yet
succeed
well
,
I
did
not
wish
to
spend
*NL*
my
time
in
earning
rich
carpets
or
other
fine
furniture
,
or
delicate
*NL*
cookery
,
or
a
house
in
the
Grecian
or
the
Gothic
style
just
yet
.
If
*NL*
there
are
any
to
whom
it
is
no
interruption
to
acquire
these
things
,
*NL*
and
who
know
how
to
use
them
when
acquired
,
I
relinquish
to
them
the
*NL*
pursuit
.
Some
are
``
industrious
,
''
and
appear
to
love
labor
for
its
own
*NL*
sake
,
or
perhaps
because
it
keeps
them
out
of
worse
mischief
;
to
such
I
*NL*
have
at
present
nothing
to
say
.
Those
who
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
*NL*
more
leisure
than
they
now
enjoy
,
I
might
advise
to
work
twice
as
*NL*
hard
as
they
do
--
work
till
they
pay
for
themselves
,
and
get
their
free
*NL*
papers
.
For
myself
I
found
that
the
occupation
of
a
day-laborer
was
the
*NL*
most
independent
of
any
,
especially
as
it
required
only
thirty
or
forty
*NL*
days
in
a
year
to
support
one
.
The
laborer
's
day
ends
with
the
going
*NL*
down
of
the
sun
,
and
he
is
then
free
to
devote
himself
to
his
chosen
*NL*
pursuit
,
independent
of
his
labor
;
but
his
employer
,
who
speculates
from
*NL*
month
to
month
,
has
no
respite
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
am
convinced
,
both
by
faith
and
experience
,
that
to
maintain
*NL*
one
's
self
on
this
earth
is
not
a
hardship
but
a
pastime
,
if
we
will
*NL*
live
simply
and
wisely
;
as
the
pursuits
of
the
simpler
nations
are
still
*NL*
the
sports
of
the
more
artificial
.
It
is
not
necessary
that
a
man
should
*NL*
earn
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
,
unless
he
sweats
easier
than
I
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
has
inherited
some
acres
,
told
me
*NL*
that
he
thought
he
should
live
as
I
did
,
_
if
he
had
the
means
_
.
I
would
*NL*
not
have
any
one
adopt
_
my
_
mode
of
living
on
any
account
;
for
,
beside
*NL*
that
before
he
has
fairly
learned
it
I
may
have
found
out
another
for
*NL*
myself
,
I
desire
that
there
may
be
as
many
different
persons
in
the
*NL*
world
as
possible
;
but
I
would
have
each
one
be
very
careful
to
find
*NL*
out
and
pursue
_
his
own
_
way
,
and
not
his
father
's
or
his
mother
's
or
his
*NL*
neighbor
's
instead
.
The
youth
may
build
or
plant
or
sail
,
only
let
him
*NL*
not
be
hindered
from
doing
that
which
he
tells
me
he
would
like
to
do
.
*NL*
It
is
by
a
mathematical
point
only
that
we
are
wise
,
as
the
sailor
or
*NL*
the
fugitive
slave
keeps
the
polestar
in
his
eye
;
but
that
is
sufficient
*NL*
guidance
for
all
our
life
.
We
may
not
arrive
at
our
port
within
a
*NL*
calculable
period
,
but
we
would
preserve
the
true
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undoubtedly
,
in
this
case
,
what
is
true
for
one
is
truer
still
for
a
*NL*
thousand
,
as
a
large
house
is
not
proportionally
more
expensive
than
a
*NL*
small
one
,
since
one
roof
may
cover
,
one
cellar
underlie
,
and
one
wall
*NL*
separate
several
apartments
.
But
for
my
part
,
I
preferred
the
solitary
*NL*
dwelling
.
Moreover
,
it
will
commonly
be
cheaper
to
build
the
whole
*NL*
yourself
than
to
convince
another
of
the
advantage
of
the
common
wall
;
*NL*
and
when
you
have
done
this
,
the
common
partition
,
to
be
much
cheaper
,
*NL*
must
be
a
thin
one
,
and
that
other
may
prove
a
bad
neighbor
,
and
also
*NL*
not
keep
his
side
in
repair
.
The
only
co-operation
which
is
commonly
*NL*
possible
is
exceedingly
partial
and
superficial
;
and
what
little
true
*NL*
co-operation
there
is
,
is
as
if
it
were
not
,
being
a
harmony
inaudible
*NL*
to
men
.
If
a
man
has
faith
,
he
will
co-operate
with
equal
faith
*NL*
everywhere
;
if
he
has
not
faith
,
he
will
continue
to
live
like
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
world
,
whatever
company
he
is
joined
to
.
To
co-operate
in
the
*NL*
highest
as
well
as
the
lowest
sense
,
means
_
to
get
our
living
together
_
.
I
*NL*
heard
it
proposed
lately
that
two
young
men
should
travel
together
over
*NL*
the
world
,
the
one
without
money
,
earning
his
means
as
he
went
,
before
*NL*
the
mast
and
behind
the
plow
,
the
other
carrying
a
bill
of
exchange
in
*NL*
his
pocket
.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
they
could
not
long
be
companions
or
*NL*
co-operate
,
since
one
would
not
_
operate
_
at
all
.
They
would
part
at
*NL*
the
first
interesting
crisis
in
their
adventures
.
Above
all
,
as
I
have
*NL*
implied
,
the
man
who
goes
alone
can
start
today
;
but
he
who
travels
with
*NL*
another
must
wait
till
that
other
is
ready
,
and
it
may
be
a
long
time
*NL*
before
they
get
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
is
very
selfish
,
I
have
heard
some
of
my
townsmen
say
.
*NL*
I
confess
that
I
have
hitherto
indulged
very
little
in
philanthropic
*NL*
enterprises
.
I
have
made
some
sacrifices
to
a
sense
of
duty
,
and
among
*NL*
others
have
sacrificed
this
pleasure
also
.
There
are
those
who
have
*NL*
used
all
their
arts
to
persuade
me
to
undertake
the
support
of
some
*NL*
poor
family
in
the
town
;
and
if
I
had
nothing
to
do
--
for
the
devil
finds
*NL*
employment
for
the
idle
--
I
might
try
my
hand
at
some
such
pastime
as
*NL*
that
.
However
,
when
I
have
thought
to
indulge
myself
in
this
respect
,
*NL*
and
lay
their
Heaven
under
an
obligation
by
maintaining
certain
poor
*NL*
persons
in
all
respects
as
comfortably
as
I
maintain
myself
,
and
have
*NL*
even
ventured
so
far
as
to
make
them
the
offer
,
they
have
one
and
all
*NL*
unhesitatingly
preferred
to
remain
poor
.
While
my
townsmen
and
women
are
*NL*
devoted
in
so
many
ways
to
the
good
of
their
fellows
,
I
trust
that
one
*NL*
at
least
may
be
spared
to
other
and
less
humane
pursuits
.
You
must
have
*NL*
a
genius
for
charity
as
well
as
for
anything
else
.
As
for
Doing-good
,
*NL*
that
is
one
of
the
professions
which
are
full
.
Moreover
,
I
have
tried
it
*NL*
fairly
,
and
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
am
satisfied
that
it
does
not
agree
*NL*
with
my
constitution
.
Probably
I
should
not
consciously
and
deliberately
*NL*
forsake
my
particular
calling
to
do
the
good
which
society
demands
of
*NL*
me
,
to
save
the
universe
from
annihilation
;
and
I
believe
that
a
like
*NL*
but
infinitely
greater
steadfastness
elsewhere
is
all
that
now
preserves
*NL*
it
.
But
I
would
not
stand
between
any
man
and
his
genius
;
and
to
him
who
*NL*
does
this
work
,
which
I
decline
,
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
and
life
,
*NL*
I
would
say
,
Persevere
,
even
if
the
world
call
it
doing
evil
,
as
it
is
*NL*
most
likely
they
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
far
from
supposing
that
my
case
is
a
peculiar
one
;
no
doubt
many
of
*NL*
my
readers
would
make
a
similar
defence
.
At
doing
something
--
I
will
not
*NL*
engage
that
my
neighbors
shall
pronounce
it
good
--
I
do
not
hesitate
to
*NL*
say
that
I
should
be
a
capital
fellow
to
hire
;
but
what
that
is
,
it
is
*NL*
for
my
employer
to
find
out
.
What
_
good
_
I
do
,
in
the
common
sense
of
*NL*
that
word
,
must
be
aside
from
my
main
path
,
and
for
the
most
part
wholly
*NL*
unintended
.
Men
say
,
practically
,
Begin
where
you
are
and
such
as
you
*NL*
are
,
without
aiming
mainly
to
become
of
more
worth
,
and
with
kindness
*NL*
aforethought
go
about
doing
good
.
If
I
were
to
preach
at
all
in
this
*NL*
strain
,
I
should
say
rather
,
Set
about
being
good
.
As
if
the
sun
should
*NL*
stop
when
he
had
kindled
his
fires
up
to
the
splendor
of
a
moon
or
*NL*
a
star
of
the
sixth
magnitude
,
and
go
about
like
a
Robin
Goodfellow
,
*NL*
peeping
in
at
every
cottage
window
,
inspiring
lunatics
,
and
tainting
*NL*
meats
,
and
making
darkness
visible
,
instead
of
steadily
increasing
his
*NL*
genial
heat
and
beneficence
till
he
is
of
such
brightness
that
no
mortal
*NL*
can
look
him
in
the
face
,
and
then
,
and
in
the
meanwhile
too
,
going
*NL*
about
the
world
in
his
own
orbit
,
doing
it
good
,
or
rather
,
as
a
truer
*NL*
philosophy
has
discovered
,
the
world
going
about
him
getting
good
.
When
*NL*
Phaeton
,
wishing
to
prove
his
heavenly
birth
by
his
beneficence
,
had
the
*NL*
sun
's
chariot
but
one
day
,
and
drove
out
of
the
beaten
track
,
he
burned
*NL*
several
blocks
of
houses
in
the
lower
streets
of
heaven
,
and
scorched
*NL*
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
and
dried
up
every
spring
,
and
made
the
great
*NL*
desert
of
Sahara
,
till
at
length
Jupiter
hurled
him
headlong
to
the
*NL*
earth
with
a
thunderbolt
,
and
the
sun
,
through
grief
at
his
death
,
did
*NL*
not
shine
for
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
odor
so
bad
as
that
which
arises
from
goodness
tainted
.
It
*NL*
is
human
,
it
is
divine
,
carrion
.
If
I
knew
for
a
certainty
that
a
man
*NL*
was
coming
to
my
house
with
the
conscious
design
of
doing
me
good
,
*NL*
I
should
run
for
my
life
,
as
from
that
dry
and
parching
wind
of
the
*NL*
African
deserts
called
the
simoom
,
which
fills
the
mouth
and
nose
and
*NL*
ears
and
eyes
with
dust
till
you
are
suffocated
,
for
fear
that
I
should
*NL*
get
some
of
his
good
done
to
me
--
some
of
its
virus
mingled
with
my
*NL*
blood
.
No
--
in
this
case
I
would
rather
suffer
evil
the
natural
way
.
*NL*
A
man
is
not
a
good
_
man
_
to
me
because
he
will
feed
me
if
I
should
be
*NL*
starving
,
or
warm
me
if
I
should
be
freezing
,
or
pull
me
out
of
a
ditch
*NL*
if
I
should
ever
fall
into
one
.
I
can
find
you
a
Newfoundland
dog
that
*NL*
will
do
as
much
.
Philanthropy
is
not
love
for
one
's
fellow-man
in
the
*NL*
broadest
sense
.
Howard
was
no
doubt
an
exceedingly
kind
and
worthy
man
*NL*
in
his
way
,
and
has
his
reward
;
but
,
comparatively
speaking
,
what
are
a
*NL*
hundred
Howards
to
_
us
_
,
if
their
philanthropy
do
not
help
us
in
our
*NL*
best
estate
,
when
we
are
most
worthy
to
be
helped
?
I
never
heard
of
a
*NL*
philanthropic
meeting
in
which
it
was
sincerely
proposed
to
do
any
good
*NL*
to
me
,
or
the
like
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jesuits
were
quite
balked
by
those
Indians
who
,
being
burned
at
*NL*
the
stake
,
suggested
new
modes
of
torture
to
their
tormentors
.
Being
*NL*
superior
to
physical
suffering
,
it
sometimes
chanced
that
they
were
*NL*
superior
to
any
consolation
which
the
missionaries
could
offer
;
and
the
*NL*
law
to
do
as
you
would
be
done
by
fell
with
less
persuasiveness
on
the
*NL*
ears
of
those
who
,
for
their
part
,
did
not
care
how
they
were
done
by
,
*NL*
who
loved
their
enemies
after
a
new
fashion
,
and
came
very
near
freely
*NL*
forgiving
them
all
they
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
sure
that
you
give
the
poor
the
aid
they
most
need
,
though
it
be
your
*NL*
example
which
leaves
them
far
behind
.
If
you
give
money
,
spend
yourself
*NL*
with
it
,
and
do
not
merely
abandon
it
to
them
.
We
make
curious
mistakes
*NL*
sometimes
.
Often
the
poor
man
is
not
so
cold
and
hungry
as
he
is
*NL*
dirty
and
ragged
and
gross
.
It
is
partly
his
taste
,
and
not
merely
his
*NL*
misfortune
.
If
you
give
him
money
,
he
will
perhaps
buy
more
rags
with
*NL*
it
.
I
was
wont
to
pity
the
clumsy
Irish
laborers
who
cut
ice
on
the
*NL*
pond
,
in
such
mean
and
ragged
clothes
,
while
I
shivered
in
my
more
tidy
*NL*
and
somewhat
more
fashionable
garments
,
till
,
one
bitter
cold
day
,
one
*NL*
who
had
slipped
into
the
water
came
to
my
house
to
warm
him
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
him
strip
off
three
pairs
of
pants
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
ere
he
got
*NL*
down
to
the
skin
,
though
they
were
dirty
and
ragged
enough
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
and
that
he
could
afford
to
refuse
the
_
extra
_
garments
which
I
offered
*NL*
him
,
he
had
so
many
_
intra
_
ones
.
This
ducking
was
the
very
thing
he
*NL*
needed
.
Then
I
began
to
pity
myself
,
and
I
saw
that
it
would
be
a
*NL*
greater
charity
to
bestow
on
me
a
flannel
shirt
than
a
whole
slop-shop
*NL*
on
him
.
There
are
a
thousand
hacking
at
the
branches
of
evil
to
one
who
*NL*
is
striking
at
the
root
,
and
it
may
be
that
he
who
bestows
the
largest
*NL*
amount
of
time
and
money
on
the
needy
is
doing
the
most
by
his
mode
of
*NL*
life
to
produce
that
misery
which
he
strives
in
vain
to
relieve
.
It
is
*NL*
the
pious
slave-breeder
devoting
the
proceeds
of
every
tenth
slave
to
*NL*
buy
a
Sunday
's
liberty
for
the
rest
.
Some
show
their
kindness
to
the
*NL*
poor
by
employing
them
in
their
kitchens
.
Would
they
not
be
kinder
if
*NL*
they
employed
themselves
there
?
You
boast
of
spending
a
tenth
part
of
*NL*
your
income
in
charity
;
maybe
you
should
spend
the
nine
tenths
so
,
and
*NL*
done
with
it
.
Society
recovers
only
a
tenth
part
of
the
property
then
.
*NL*
Is
this
owing
to
the
generosity
of
him
in
whose
possession
it
is
found
,
*NL*
or
to
the
remissness
of
the
officers
of
justice
?
*NL*
*NL*
Philanthropy
is
almost
the
only
virtue
which
is
sufficiently
appreciated
*NL*
by
mankind
.
Nay
,
it
is
greatly
overrated
;
and
it
is
our
selfishness
*NL*
which
overrates
it
.
A
robust
poor
man
,
one
sunny
day
here
in
Concord
,
*NL*
praised
a
fellow-townsman
to
me
,
because
,
as
he
said
,
he
was
kind
to
the
*NL*
poor
;
meaning
himself
.
The
kind
uncles
and
aunts
of
the
race
are
more
*NL*
esteemed
than
its
true
spiritual
fathers
and
mothers
.
I
once
heard
a
*NL*
reverend
lecturer
on
England
,
a
man
of
learning
and
intelligence
,
*NL*
after
enumerating
her
scientific
,
literary
,
and
political
worthies
,
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
Bacon
,
Cromwell
,
Milton
,
Newton
,
and
others
,
speak
next
of
*NL*
her
Christian
heroes
,
whom
,
as
if
his
profession
required
it
of
him
,
*NL*
he
elevated
to
a
place
far
above
all
the
rest
,
as
the
greatest
of
the
*NL*
great
.
They
were
Penn
,
Howard
,
and
Mrs.
Fry
.
Every
one
must
feel
the
*NL*
falsehood
and
cant
of
this
.
The
last
were
not
England
's
best
men
and
*NL*
women
;
only
,
perhaps
,
her
best
philanthropists
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
subtract
anything
from
the
praise
that
is
due
to
*NL*
philanthropy
,
but
merely
demand
justice
for
all
who
by
their
lives
*NL*
and
works
are
a
blessing
to
mankind
.
I
do
not
value
chiefly
a
man
's
*NL*
uprightness
and
benevolence
,
which
are
,
as
it
were
,
his
stem
and
leaves
.
*NL*
Those
plants
of
whose
greenness
withered
we
make
herb
tea
for
the
sick
*NL*
serve
but
a
humble
use
,
and
are
most
employed
by
quacks
.
I
want
the
*NL*
flower
and
fruit
of
a
man
;
that
some
fragrance
be
wafted
over
from
him
*NL*
to
me
,
and
some
ripeness
flavor
our
intercourse
.
His
goodness
must
not
*NL*
be
a
partial
and
transitory
act
,
but
a
constant
superfluity
,
which
costs
*NL*
him
nothing
and
of
which
he
is
unconscious
.
This
is
a
charity
that
hides
*NL*
a
multitude
of
sins
.
The
philanthropist
too
often
surrounds
mankind
with
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
his
own
castoff
griefs
as
an
atmosphere
,
and
calls
it
*NL*
sympathy
.
We
should
impart
our
courage
,
and
not
our
despair
,
our
health
*NL*
and
ease
,
and
not
our
disease
,
and
take
care
that
this
does
not
spread
*NL*
by
contagion
.
From
what
southern
plains
comes
up
the
voice
of
wailing
?
*NL*
Under
what
latitudes
reside
the
heathen
to
whom
we
would
send
light
?
Who
*NL*
is
that
intemperate
and
brutal
man
whom
we
would
redeem
?
If
anything
ail
*NL*
a
man
,
so
that
he
does
not
perform
his
functions
,
if
he
have
a
pain
in
*NL*
his
bowels
even
--
for
that
is
the
seat
of
sympathy
--
he
forthwith
sets
*NL*
about
reforming
--
the
world
.
Being
a
microcosm
himself
,
he
discovers
--
and
*NL*
it
is
a
true
discovery
,
and
he
is
the
man
to
make
it
--
that
the
world
has
*NL*
been
eating
green
apples
;
to
his
eyes
,
in
fact
,
the
globe
itself
is
*NL*
a
great
green
apple
,
which
there
is
danger
awful
to
think
of
that
the
*NL*
children
of
men
will
nibble
before
it
is
ripe
;
and
straightway
his
*NL*
drastic
philanthropy
seeks
out
the
Esquimau
and
the
Patagonian
,
and
*NL*
embraces
the
populous
Indian
and
Chinese
villages
;
and
thus
,
by
a
few
*NL*
years
of
philanthropic
activity
,
the
powers
in
the
meanwhile
using
him
*NL*
for
their
own
ends
,
no
doubt
,
he
cures
himself
of
his
dyspepsia
,
the
*NL*
globe
acquires
a
faint
blush
on
one
or
both
of
its
cheeks
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
beginning
to
be
ripe
,
and
life
loses
its
crudity
and
is
once
more
sweet
*NL*
and
wholesome
to
live
.
I
never
dreamed
of
any
enormity
greater
than
I
*NL*
have
committed
.
I
never
knew
,
and
never
shall
know
,
a
worse
man
than
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
that
what
so
saddens
the
reformer
is
not
his
sympathy
with
his
*NL*
fellows
in
distress
,
but
,
though
he
be
the
holiest
son
of
God
,
is
*NL*
his
private
ail
.
Let
this
be
righted
,
let
the
spring
come
to
him
,
the
*NL*
morning
rise
over
his
couch
,
and
he
will
forsake
his
generous
companions
*NL*
without
apology
.
My
excuse
for
not
lecturing
against
the
use
of
*NL*
tobacco
is
,
that
I
never
chewed
it
,
that
is
a
penalty
which
reformed
*NL*
tobacco-chewers
have
to
pay
;
though
there
are
things
enough
I
have
*NL*
chewed
which
I
could
lecture
against
.
If
you
should
ever
be
betrayed
*NL*
into
any
of
these
philanthropies
,
do
not
let
your
left
hand
know
what
*NL*
your
right
hand
does
,
for
it
is
not
worth
knowing
.
Rescue
the
drowning
*NL*
and
tie
your
shoestrings
.
Take
your
time
,
and
set
about
some
free
labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
manners
have
been
corrupted
by
communication
with
the
saints
.
Our
*NL*
hymn-books
resound
with
a
melodious
cursing
of
God
and
enduring
Him
*NL*
forever
.
One
would
say
that
even
the
prophets
and
redeemers
had
rather
*NL*
consoled
the
fears
than
confirmed
the
hopes
of
man
.
There
is
nowhere
*NL*
recorded
a
simple
and
irrepressible
satisfaction
with
the
gift
of
*NL*
life
,
any
memorable
praise
of
God
.
All
health
and
success
does
me
good
,
*NL*
however
far
off
and
withdrawn
it
may
appear
;
all
disease
and
failure
*NL*
helps
to
make
me
sad
and
does
me
evil
,
however
much
sympathy
it
may
have
*NL*
with
me
or
I
with
it
.
If
,
then
,
we
would
indeed
restore
mankind
by
truly
*NL*
Indian
,
botanic
,
magnetic
,
or
natural
means
,
let
us
first
be
as
simple
*NL*
and
well
as
Nature
ourselves
,
dispel
the
clouds
which
hang
over
our
own
*NL*
brows
,
and
take
up
a
little
life
into
our
pores
.
Do
not
stay
to
be
an
*NL*
overseer
of
the
poor
,
but
endeavor
to
become
one
of
the
worthies
of
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
in
the
Gulistan
,
or
Flower
Garden
,
of
Sheik
Sadi
of
Shiraz
,
that
*NL*
``
they
asked
a
wise
man
,
saying
:
Of
the
many
celebrated
trees
which
the
*NL*
Most
High
God
has
created
lofty
and
umbrageous
,
they
call
none
azad
,
or
*NL*
free
,
excepting
the
cypress
,
which
bears
no
fruit
;
what
mystery
is
there
*NL*
in
this
?
He
replied
,
Each
has
its
appropriate
produce
,
and
appointed
*NL*
season
,
during
the
continuance
of
which
it
is
fresh
and
blooming
,
and
*NL*
during
their
absence
dry
and
withered
;
to
neither
of
which
states
is
the
*NL*
cypress
exposed
,
being
always
flourishing
;
and
of
this
nature
are
the
*NL*
azads
,
or
religious
independents
.
--
Fix
not
thy
heart
on
that
which
is
*NL*
transitory
;
for
the
Dijlah
,
or
Tigris
,
will
continue
to
flow
through
*NL*
Bagdad
after
the
race
of
caliphs
is
extinct
:
if
thy
hand
has
plenty
,
be
*NL*
liberal
as
the
date
tree
;
but
if
it
affords
nothing
to
give
away
,
be
an
*NL*
azad
,
or
free
man
,
like
the
cypress
.

Where
I
Lived
,
and
What
I
Lived
For
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
certain
season
of
our
life
we
are
accustomed
to
consider
every
spot
*NL*
as
the
possible
site
of
a
house
.
I
have
thus
surveyed
the
country
on
*NL*
every
side
within
a
dozen
miles
of
where
I
live
.
In
imagination
I
have
*NL*
bought
all
the
farms
in
succession
,
for
all
were
to
be
bought
,
and
I
*NL*
knew
their
price
.
I
walked
over
each
farmer
's
premises
,
tasted
his
wild
*NL*
apples
,
discoursed
on
husbandry
with
him
,
took
his
farm
at
his
price
,
at
*NL*
any
price
,
mortgaging
it
to
him
in
my
mind
;
even
put
a
higher
price
on
*NL*
it
--
took
everything
but
a
deed
of
it
--
took
his
word
for
his
deed
,
for
I
*NL*
dearly
love
to
talk
--
cultivated
it
,
and
him
too
to
some
extent
,
I
trust
,
*NL*
and
withdrew
when
I
had
enjoyed
it
long
enough
,
leaving
him
to
carry
it
*NL*
on
.
This
experience
entitled
me
to
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
real-estate
*NL*
broker
by
my
friends
.
Wherever
I
sat
,
there
I
might
live
,
and
the
*NL*
landscape
radiated
from
me
accordingly
.
What
is
a
house
but
a
_
sedes
_
,
a
*NL*
seat
?
--
better
if
a
country
seat
.
I
discovered
many
a
site
for
a
house
*NL*
not
likely
to
be
soon
improved
,
which
some
might
have
thought
too
far
*NL*
from
the
village
,
but
to
my
eyes
the
village
was
too
far
from
it
.
Well
,
*NL*
there
I
might
live
,
I
said
;
and
there
I
did
live
,
for
an
hour
,
a
summer
*NL*
and
a
winter
life
;
saw
how
I
could
let
the
years
run
off
,
buffet
the
*NL*
winter
through
,
and
see
the
spring
come
in
.
The
future
inhabitants
of
*NL*
this
region
,
wherever
they
may
place
their
houses
,
may
be
sure
that
they
*NL*
have
been
anticipated
.
An
afternoon
sufficed
to
lay
out
the
land
into
*NL*
orchard
,
wood-lot
,
and
pasture
,
and
to
decide
what
fine
oaks
or
pines
*NL*
should
be
left
to
stand
before
the
door
,
and
whence
each
blasted
tree
*NL*
could
be
seen
to
the
best
advantage
;
and
then
I
let
it
lie
,
fallow
,
*NL*
perchance
,
for
a
man
is
rich
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
things
which
*NL*
he
can
afford
to
let
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
imagination
carried
me
so
far
that
I
even
had
the
refusal
of
several
*NL*
farms
--
the
refusal
was
all
I
wanted
--
but
I
never
got
my
fingers
burned
*NL*
by
actual
possession
.
The
nearest
that
I
came
to
actual
possession
was
*NL*
when
I
bought
the
Hollowell
place
,
and
had
begun
to
sort
my
seeds
,
and
*NL*
collected
materials
with
which
to
make
a
wheelbarrow
to
carry
it
on
or
*NL*
off
with
;
but
before
the
owner
gave
me
a
deed
of
it
,
his
wife
--
every
man
*NL*
has
such
a
wife
--
changed
her
mind
and
wished
to
keep
it
,
and
he
offered
*NL*
me
ten
dollars
to
release
him
.
Now
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
I
had
but
ten
*NL*
cents
in
the
world
,
and
it
surpassed
my
arithmetic
to
tell
,
if
I
was
*NL*
that
man
who
had
ten
cents
,
or
who
had
a
farm
,
or
ten
dollars
,
or
all
*NL*
together
.
However
,
I
let
him
keep
the
ten
dollars
and
the
farm
too
,
for
*NL*
I
had
carried
it
far
enough
;
or
rather
,
to
be
generous
,
I
sold
him
the
*NL*
farm
for
just
what
I
gave
for
it
,
and
,
as
he
was
not
a
rich
man
,
made
*NL*
him
a
present
of
ten
dollars
,
and
still
had
my
ten
cents
,
and
seeds
,
and
*NL*
materials
for
a
wheelbarrow
left
.
I
found
thus
that
I
had
been
a
rich
*NL*
man
without
any
damage
to
my
poverty
.
But
I
retained
the
landscape
,
and
*NL*
I
have
since
annually
carried
off
what
it
yielded
without
a
wheelbarrow
.
*NL*
With
respect
to
landscapes
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
monarch
of
all
I
_
survey
_
,
*NL*
My
right
there
is
none
to
dispute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
frequently
seen
a
poet
withdraw
,
having
enjoyed
the
most
valuable
*NL*
part
of
a
farm
,
while
the
crusty
farmer
supposed
that
he
had
got
a
few
*NL*
wild
apples
only
.
Why
,
the
owner
does
not
know
it
for
many
years
when
*NL*
a
poet
has
put
his
farm
in
rhyme
,
the
most
admirable
kind
of
invisible
*NL*
fence
,
has
fairly
impounded
it
,
milked
it
,
skimmed
it
,
and
got
all
the
*NL*
cream
,
and
left
the
farmer
only
the
skimmed
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
attractions
of
the
Hollowell
farm
,
to
me
,
were
:
its
complete
*NL*
retirement
,
being
,
about
two
miles
from
the
village
,
half
a
mile
from
*NL*
the
nearest
neighbor
,
and
separated
from
the
highway
by
a
broad
field
;
*NL*
its
bounding
on
the
river
,
which
the
owner
said
protected
it
by
its
fogs
*NL*
from
frosts
in
the
spring
,
though
that
was
nothing
to
me
;
the
gray
color
*NL*
and
ruinous
state
of
the
house
and
barn
,
and
the
dilapidated
fences
,
*NL*
which
put
such
an
interval
between
me
and
the
last
occupant
;
the
hollow
*NL*
and
lichen-covered
apple
trees
,
gnawed
by
rabbits
,
showing
what
kind
of
*NL*
neighbors
I
should
have
;
but
above
all
,
the
recollection
I
had
of
it
*NL*
from
my
earliest
voyages
up
the
river
,
when
the
house
was
concealed
*NL*
behind
a
dense
grove
of
red
maples
,
through
which
I
heard
the
house-dog
*NL*
bark
.
I
was
in
haste
to
buy
it
,
before
the
proprietor
finished
getting
*NL*
out
some
rocks
,
cutting
down
the
hollow
apple
trees
,
and
grubbing
up
*NL*
some
young
birches
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
pasture
,
or
,
in
short
,
had
*NL*
made
any
more
of
his
improvements
.
To
enjoy
these
advantages
I
was
ready
*NL*
to
carry
it
on
;
like
Atlas
,
to
take
the
world
on
my
shoulders
--
I
never
*NL*
heard
what
compensation
he
received
for
that
--
and
do
all
those
things
*NL*
which
had
no
other
motive
or
excuse
but
that
I
might
pay
for
it
and
*NL*
be
unmolested
in
my
possession
of
it
;
for
I
knew
all
the
while
that
it
*NL*
would
yield
the
most
abundant
crop
of
the
kind
I
wanted
,
if
I
could
only
*NL*
afford
to
let
it
alone
.
But
it
turned
out
as
I
have
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
I
could
say
,
then
,
with
respect
to
farming
on
a
large
scale
--
I
*NL*
have
always
cultivated
a
garden
--
was
,
that
I
had
had
my
seeds
ready
.
*NL*
Many
think
that
seeds
improve
with
age
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
time
*NL*
discriminates
between
the
good
and
the
bad
;
and
when
at
last
I
shall
*NL*
plant
,
I
shall
be
less
likely
to
be
disappointed
.
But
I
would
say
to
my
*NL*
fellows
,
once
for
all
,
As
long
as
possible
live
free
and
uncommitted
.
It
*NL*
makes
but
little
difference
whether
you
are
committed
to
a
farm
or
the
*NL*
county
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Cato
,
whose
``
De
Re
RusticAc
''
is
my
``
Cultivator
,
''
says
--
and
the
only
*NL*
translation
I
have
seen
makes
sheer
nonsense
of
the
passage
--
``
When
you
*NL*
think
of
getting
a
farm
turn
it
thus
in
your
mind
,
not
to
buy
greedily
;
*NL*
nor
spare
your
pains
to
look
at
it
,
and
do
not
think
it
enough
to
go
*NL*
round
it
once
.
The
oftener
you
go
there
the
more
it
will
please
you
,
if
*NL*
it
is
good
.
''
I
think
I
shall
not
buy
greedily
,
but
go
round
and
round
it
*NL*
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
be
buried
in
it
first
,
that
it
may
please
me
the
*NL*
more
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
present
was
my
next
experiment
of
this
kind
,
which
I
purpose
to
*NL*
describe
more
at
length
,
for
convenience
putting
the
experience
of
two
*NL*
years
into
one
.
As
I
have
said
,
I
do
not
propose
to
write
an
ode
*NL*
to
dejection
,
but
to
brag
as
lustily
as
chanticleer
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
standing
on
his
roost
,
if
only
to
wake
my
neighbors
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
first
I
took
up
my
abode
in
the
woods
,
that
is
,
began
to
spend
my
*NL*
nights
as
well
as
days
there
,
which
,
by
accident
,
was
on
Independence
*NL*
Day
,
or
the
Fourth
of
July
,
1845
,
my
house
was
not
finished
for
winter
,
*NL*
but
was
merely
a
defence
against
the
rain
,
without
plastering
or
*NL*
chimney
,
the
walls
being
of
rough
,
weather-stained
boards
,
with
wide
*NL*
chinks
,
which
made
it
cool
at
night
.
The
upright
white
hewn
studs
and
*NL*
freshly
planed
door
and
window
casings
gave
it
a
clean
and
airy
look
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
morning
,
when
its
timbers
were
saturated
with
dew
,
so
*NL*
that
I
fancied
that
by
noon
some
sweet
gum
would
exude
from
them
.
To
my
*NL*
imagination
it
retained
throughout
the
day
more
or
less
of
this
auroral
*NL*
character
,
reminding
me
of
a
certain
house
on
a
mountain
which
I
had
*NL*
visited
a
year
before
.
This
was
an
airy
and
unplastered
cabin
,
fit
*NL*
to
entertain
a
travelling
god
,
and
where
a
goddess
might
trail
her
*NL*
garments
.
The
winds
which
passed
over
my
dwelling
were
such
as
sweep
*NL*
over
the
ridges
of
mountains
,
bearing
the
broken
strains
,
or
celestial
*NL*
parts
only
,
of
terrestrial
music
.
The
morning
wind
forever
blows
,
the
*NL*
poem
of
creation
is
uninterrupted
;
but
few
are
the
ears
that
hear
it
.
*NL*
Olympus
is
but
the
outside
of
the
earth
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
house
I
had
been
the
owner
of
before
,
if
I
except
a
boat
,
was
*NL*
a
tent
,
which
I
used
occasionally
when
making
excursions
in
the
summer
,
*NL*
and
this
is
still
rolled
up
in
my
garret
;
but
the
boat
,
after
passing
*NL*
from
hand
to
hand
,
has
gone
down
the
stream
of
time
.
With
this
more
*NL*
substantial
shelter
about
me
,
I
had
made
some
progress
toward
*NL*
settling
in
the
world
.
This
frame
,
so
slightly
clad
,
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
crystallization
around
me
,
and
reacted
on
the
builder
.
It
was
suggestive
*NL*
somewhat
as
a
picture
in
outlines
.
I
did
not
need
to
go
outdoors
to
take
*NL*
the
air
,
for
the
atmosphere
within
had
lost
none
of
its
freshness
.
It
*NL*
was
not
so
much
within
doors
as
behind
a
door
where
I
sat
,
even
in
the
*NL*
rainiest
weather
.
The
Harivansa
says
,
``
An
abode
without
birds
is
like
*NL*
a
meat
without
seasoning
.
''
Such
was
not
my
abode
,
for
I
found
myself
*NL*
suddenly
neighbor
to
the
birds
;
not
by
having
imprisoned
one
,
but
having
*NL*
caged
myself
near
them
.
I
was
not
only
nearer
to
some
of
those
which
*NL*
commonly
frequent
the
garden
and
the
orchard
,
but
to
those
smaller
and
*NL*
more
thrilling
songsters
of
the
forest
which
never
,
or
rarely
,
serenade
*NL*
a
villager
--
the
wood
thrush
,
the
veery
,
the
scarlet
tanager
,
the
field
*NL*
sparrow
,
the
whip-poor-will
,
and
many
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
seated
by
the
shore
of
a
small
pond
,
about
a
mile
and
a
half
south
*NL*
of
the
village
of
Concord
and
somewhat
higher
than
it
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
an
extensive
wood
between
that
town
and
Lincoln
,
and
about
two
miles
*NL*
south
of
that
our
only
field
known
to
fame
,
Concord
Battle
Ground
;
but
*NL*
I
was
so
low
in
the
woods
that
the
opposite
shore
,
half
a
mile
off
,
like
*NL*
the
rest
,
covered
with
wood
,
was
my
most
distant
horizon
.
For
the
first
*NL*
week
,
whenever
I
looked
out
on
the
pond
it
impressed
me
like
a
tarn
high
*NL*
up
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
,
its
bottom
far
above
the
surface
of
other
*NL*
lakes
,
and
,
as
the
sun
arose
,
I
saw
it
throwing
off
its
nightly
clothing
*NL*
of
mist
,
and
here
and
there
,
by
degrees
,
its
soft
ripples
or
its
smooth
*NL*
reflecting
surface
was
revealed
,
while
the
mists
,
like
ghosts
,
were
*NL*
stealthily
withdrawing
in
every
direction
into
the
woods
,
as
at
the
*NL*
breaking
up
of
some
nocturnal
conventicle
.
The
very
dew
seemed
to
*NL*
hang
upon
the
trees
later
into
the
day
than
usual
,
as
on
the
sides
of
*NL*
mountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
small
lake
was
of
most
value
as
a
neighbor
in
the
intervals
of
a
*NL*
gentle
rain-storm
in
August
,
when
,
both
air
and
water
being
perfectly
*NL*
still
,
but
the
sky
overcast
,
mid-afternoon
had
all
the
serenity
of
*NL*
evening
,
and
the
wood
thrush
sang
around
,
and
was
heard
from
shore
to
*NL*
shore
.
A
lake
like
this
is
never
smoother
than
at
such
a
time
;
and
the
*NL*
clear
portion
of
the
air
above
it
being
,
shallow
and
darkened
by
clouds
,
*NL*
the
water
,
full
of
light
and
reflections
,
becomes
a
lower
heaven
itself
*NL*
so
much
the
more
important
.
From
a
hill-top
near
by
,
where
the
wood
had
*NL*
been
recently
cut
off
,
there
was
a
pleasing
vista
southward
across
*NL*
the
pond
,
through
a
wide
indentation
in
the
hills
which
form
the
shore
*NL*
there
,
where
their
opposite
sides
sloping
toward
each
other
suggested
a
*NL*
stream
flowing
out
in
that
direction
through
a
wooded
valley
,
but
stream
*NL*
there
was
none
.
That
way
I
looked
between
and
over
the
near
green
*NL*
hills
to
some
distant
and
higher
ones
in
the
horizon
,
tinged
with
blue
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
by
standing
on
tiptoe
I
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
of
*NL*
the
peaks
of
the
still
bluer
and
more
distant
mountain
ranges
in
the
*NL*
northwest
,
those
true-blue
coins
from
heaven
's
own
mint
,
and
also
of
*NL*
some
portion
of
the
village
.
But
in
other
directions
,
even
from
this
*NL*
point
,
I
could
not
see
over
or
beyond
the
woods
which
surrounded
me
.
It
*NL*
is
well
to
have
some
water
in
your
neighborhood
,
to
give
buoyancy
to
and
*NL*
float
the
earth
.
One
value
even
of
the
smallest
well
is
,
that
when
you
*NL*
look
into
it
you
see
that
earth
is
not
continent
but
insular
.
This
is
*NL*
as
important
as
that
it
keeps
butter
cool
.
When
I
looked
across
the
*NL*
pond
from
this
peak
toward
the
Sudbury
meadows
,
which
in
time
of
flood
*NL*
I
distinguished
elevated
perhaps
by
a
mirage
in
their
seething
valley
,
*NL*
like
a
coin
in
a
basin
,
all
the
earth
beyond
the
pond
appeared
like
*NL*
a
thin
crust
insulated
and
floated
even
by
this
small
sheet
of
*NL*
interverting
water
,
and
I
was
reminded
that
this
on
which
I
dwelt
was
*NL*
but
_
dry
land
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
view
from
my
door
was
still
more
contracted
,
I
did
not
*NL*
feel
crowded
or
confined
in
the
least
.
There
was
pasture
enough
for
my
*NL*
imagination
.
The
low
shrub
oak
plateau
to
which
the
opposite
shore
*NL*
arose
stretched
away
toward
the
prairies
of
the
West
and
the
steppes
of
*NL*
Tartary
,
affording
ample
room
for
all
the
roving
families
of
men
.
*NL*
``
There
are
none
happy
in
the
world
but
beings
who
enjoy
freely
a
*NL*
vast
horizon
''
--
said
Damodara
,
when
his
herds
required
new
and
larger
*NL*
pastures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
place
and
time
were
changed
,
and
I
dwelt
nearer
to
those
parts
of
*NL*
the
universe
and
to
those
eras
in
history
which
had
most
attracted
*NL*
me
.
Where
I
lived
was
as
far
off
as
many
a
region
viewed
nightly
by
*NL*
astronomers
.
We
are
wont
to
imagine
rare
and
delectable
places
in
some
*NL*
remote
and
more
celestial
corner
of
the
system
,
behind
the
constellation
*NL*
of
Cassiopeia
's
Chair
,
far
from
noise
and
disturbance
.
I
discovered
that
*NL*
my
house
actually
had
its
site
in
such
a
withdrawn
,
but
forever
new
and
*NL*
unprofaned
,
part
of
the
universe
.
If
it
were
worth
the
while
to
settle
*NL*
in
those
parts
near
to
the
Pleiades
or
the
Hyades
,
to
Aldebaran
or
*NL*
Altair
,
then
I
was
really
there
,
or
at
an
equal
remoteness
from
the
life
*NL*
which
I
had
left
behind
,
dwindled
and
twinkling
with
as
fine
a
ray
to
*NL*
my
nearest
neighbor
,
and
to
be
seen
only
in
moonless
nights
by
him
.
Such
*NL*
was
that
part
of
creation
where
I
had
squatted
;
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
shepherd
that
did
live
,
*NL*
And
held
his
thoughts
as
high
*NL*
As
were
the
mounts
whereon
his
flocks
*NL*
Did
hourly
feed
him
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
should
we
think
of
the
shepherd
's
life
if
his
flocks
always
*NL*
wandered
to
higher
pastures
than
his
thoughts
?
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
was
a
cheerful
invitation
to
make
my
life
of
equal
*NL*
simplicity
,
and
I
may
say
innocence
,
with
Nature
herself
.
I
have
been
as
*NL*
sincere
a
worshipper
of
Aurora
as
the
Greeks
.
I
got
up
early
and
bathed
*NL*
in
the
pond
;
that
was
a
religious
exercise
,
and
one
of
the
best
things
*NL*
which
I
did
.
They
say
that
characters
were
engraven
on
the
bathing
tub
*NL*
of
King
Tchingthang
to
this
effect
:
``
Renew
thyself
completely
each
*NL*
day
;
do
it
again
,
and
again
,
and
forever
again
.
''
I
can
understand
that
.
*NL*
Morning
brings
back
the
heroic
ages
.
I
was
as
much
affected
by
the
faint
*NL*
hum
of
a
mosquito
making
its
invisible
and
unimaginable
tour
through
*NL*
my
apartment
at
earliest
dawn
,
when
I
was
sitting
with
door
and
windows
*NL*
open
,
as
I
could
be
by
any
trumpet
that
ever
sang
of
fame
.
It
was
*NL*
Homer
's
requiem
;
itself
an
Iliad
and
Odyssey
in
the
air
,
singing
its
own
*NL*
wrath
and
wanderings
.
There
was
something
cosmical
about
it
;
a
standing
*NL*
advertisement
,
till
forbidden
,
of
the
everlasting
vigor
and
fertility
of
*NL*
the
world
.
The
morning
,
which
is
the
most
memorable
season
of
the
day
,
*NL*
is
the
awakening
hour
.
Then
there
is
least
somnolence
in
us
;
and
for
an
*NL*
hour
,
at
least
,
some
part
of
us
awakes
which
slumbers
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
day
and
night
.
Little
is
to
be
expected
of
that
day
,
if
it
can
be
*NL*
called
a
day
,
to
which
we
are
not
awakened
by
our
Genius
,
but
by
the
*NL*
mechanical
nudgings
of
some
servitor
,
are
not
awakened
by
our
own
*NL*
newly
acquired
force
and
aspirations
from
within
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
the
undulations
of
celestial
music
,
instead
of
factory
bells
,
and
a
*NL*
fragrance
filling
the
air
--
to
a
higher
life
than
we
fell
asleep
from
;
*NL*
and
thus
the
darkness
bear
its
fruit
,
and
prove
itself
to
be
good
,
*NL*
no
less
than
the
light
.
That
man
who
does
not
believe
that
each
day
*NL*
contains
an
earlier
,
more
sacred
,
and
auroral
hour
than
he
has
yet
*NL*
profaned
,
has
despaired
of
life
,
and
is
pursuing
a
descending
and
*NL*
darkening
way
.
After
a
partial
cessation
of
his
sensuous
life
,
the
soul
*NL*
of
man
,
or
its
organs
rather
,
are
reinvigorated
each
day
,
and
his
Genius
*NL*
tries
again
what
noble
life
it
can
make
.
All
memorable
events
,
I
should
*NL*
say
,
transpire
in
morning
time
and
in
a
morning
atmosphere
.
The
Vedas
*NL*
say
,
``
All
intelligences
awake
with
the
morning
.
''
Poetry
and
art
,
and
*NL*
the
fairest
and
most
memorable
of
the
actions
of
men
,
date
from
such
an
*NL*
hour
.
All
poets
and
heroes
,
like
Memnon
,
are
the
children
of
Aurora
,
and
*NL*
emit
their
music
at
sunrise
.
To
him
whose
elastic
and
vigorous
thought
*NL*
keeps
pace
with
the
sun
,
the
day
is
a
perpetual
morning
.
It
matters
not
*NL*
what
the
clocks
say
or
the
attitudes
and
labors
of
men
.
Morning
is
when
*NL*
I
am
awake
and
there
is
a
dawn
in
me
.
Moral
reform
is
the
effort
to
*NL*
throw
off
sleep
.
Why
is
it
that
men
give
so
poor
an
account
of
their
day
*NL*
if
they
have
not
been
slumbering
?
They
are
not
such
poor
calculators
.
*NL*
If
they
had
not
been
overcome
with
drowsiness
,
they
would
have
performed
*NL*
something
.
The
millions
are
awake
enough
for
physical
labor
;
but
only
*NL*
one
in
a
million
is
awake
enough
for
effective
intellectual
exertion
,
*NL*
only
one
in
a
hundred
millions
to
a
poetic
or
divine
life
.
To
be
awake
*NL*
is
to
be
alive
.
I
have
never
yet
met
a
man
who
was
quite
awake
.
How
*NL*
could
I
have
looked
him
in
the
face
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
learn
to
reawaken
and
keep
ourselves
awake
,
not
by
mechanical
*NL*
aids
,
but
by
an
infinite
expectation
of
the
dawn
,
which
does
not
forsake
*NL*
us
in
our
soundest
sleep
.
I
know
of
no
more
encouraging
fact
than
*NL*
the
unquestionable
ability
of
man
to
elevate
his
life
by
a
conscious
*NL*
endeavor
.
It
is
something
to
be
able
to
paint
a
particular
picture
,
or
*NL*
to
carve
a
statue
,
and
so
to
make
a
few
objects
beautiful
;
but
it
is
far
*NL*
more
glorious
to
carve
and
paint
the
very
atmosphere
and
medium
through
*NL*
which
we
look
,
which
morally
we
can
do
.
To
affect
the
quality
of
the
*NL*
day
,
that
is
the
highest
of
arts
.
Every
man
is
tasked
to
make
his
life
,
*NL*
even
in
its
details
,
worthy
of
the
contemplation
of
his
most
elevated
*NL*
and
critical
hour
.
If
we
refused
,
or
rather
used
up
,
such
paltry
*NL*
information
as
we
get
,
the
oracles
would
distinctly
inform
us
how
this
*NL*
might
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
to
the
woods
because
I
wished
to
live
deliberately
,
to
front
only
*NL*
the
essential
facts
of
life
,
and
see
if
I
could
not
learn
what
it
had
to
*NL*
teach
,
and
not
,
when
I
came
to
die
,
discover
that
I
had
not
lived
.
I
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
live
what
was
not
life
,
living
is
so
dear
;
nor
did
I
wish
*NL*
to
practise
resignation
,
unless
it
was
quite
necessary
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
live
deep
and
suck
out
all
the
marrow
of
life
,
to
live
so
sturdily
and
*NL*
Spartan-like
as
to
put
to
rout
all
that
was
not
life
,
to
cut
a
broad
*NL*
swath
and
shave
close
,
to
drive
life
into
a
corner
,
and
reduce
it
to
its
*NL*
lowest
terms
,
and
,
if
it
proved
to
be
mean
,
why
then
to
get
the
whole
*NL*
and
genuine
meanness
of
it
,
and
publish
its
meanness
to
the
world
;
or
*NL*
if
it
were
sublime
,
to
know
it
by
experience
,
and
be
able
to
give
a
true
*NL*
account
of
it
in
my
next
excursion
.
For
most
men
,
it
appears
to
me
,
are
*NL*
in
a
strange
uncertainty
about
it
,
whether
it
is
of
the
devil
or
of
God
,
*NL*
and
have
_
somewhat
hastily
_
concluded
that
it
is
the
chief
end
of
man
here
*NL*
to
``
glorify
God
and
enjoy
him
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
we
live
meanly
,
like
ants
;
though
the
fable
tells
us
that
we
were
*NL*
long
ago
changed
into
men
;
like
pygmies
we
fight
with
cranes
;
it
is
*NL*
error
upon
error
,
and
clout
upon
clout
,
and
our
best
virtue
has
for
its
*NL*
occasion
a
superfluous
and
evitable
wretchedness
.
Our
life
is
frittered
*NL*
away
by
detail
.
An
honest
man
has
hardly
need
to
count
more
than
his
ten
*NL*
fingers
,
or
in
extreme
cases
he
may
add
his
ten
toes
,
and
lump
the
rest
.
*NL*
Simplicity
,
simplicity
,
simplicity
!
I
say
,
let
your
affairs
be
as
two
or
*NL*
three
,
and
not
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
;
instead
of
a
million
count
half
*NL*
a
dozen
,
and
keep
your
accounts
on
your
thumb-nail
.
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
this
chopping
sea
of
civilized
life
,
such
are
the
clouds
and
storms
and
*NL*
quicksands
and
thousand-and-one
items
to
be
allowed
for
,
that
a
man
has
*NL*
to
live
,
if
he
would
not
founder
and
go
to
the
bottom
and
not
make
his
*NL*
port
at
all
,
by
dead
reckoning
,
and
he
must
be
a
great
calculator
indeed
*NL*
who
succeeds
.
Simplify
,
simplify
.
Instead
of
three
meals
a
day
,
if
it
*NL*
be
necessary
eat
but
one
;
instead
of
a
hundred
dishes
,
five
;
and
reduce
*NL*
other
things
in
proportion
.
Our
life
is
like
a
German
Confederacy
,
made
*NL*
up
of
petty
states
,
with
its
boundary
forever
fluctuating
,
so
that
even
*NL*
a
German
can
not
tell
you
how
it
is
bounded
at
any
moment
.
The
nation
*NL*
itself
,
with
all
its
so-called
internal
improvements
,
which
,
by
the
way
*NL*
are
all
external
and
superficial
,
is
just
such
an
unwieldy
and
overgrown
*NL*
establishment
,
cluttered
with
furniture
and
tripped
up
by
its
own
traps
,
*NL*
ruined
by
luxury
and
heedless
expense
,
by
want
of
calculation
and
a
*NL*
worthy
aim
,
as
the
million
households
in
the
land
;
and
the
only
cure
for
*NL*
it
,
as
for
them
,
is
in
a
rigid
economy
,
a
stern
and
more
than
Spartan
*NL*
simplicity
of
life
and
elevation
of
purpose
.
It
lives
too
fast
.
Men
*NL*
think
that
it
is
essential
that
the
_
Nation
_
have
commerce
,
and
export
*NL*
ice
,
and
talk
through
a
telegraph
,
and
ride
thirty
miles
an
hour
,
*NL*
without
a
doubt
,
whether
_
they
_
do
or
not
;
but
whether
we
should
live
*NL*
like
baboons
or
like
men
,
is
a
little
uncertain
.
If
we
do
not
get
out
*NL*
sleepers
,
and
forge
rails
,
and
devote
days
and
nights
to
the
work
,
*NL*
but
go
to
tinkering
upon
our
_
lives
_
to
improve
_
them
_
,
who
will
build
*NL*
railroads
?
And
if
railroads
are
not
built
,
how
shall
we
get
to
heaven
*NL*
in
season
?
But
if
we
stay
at
home
and
mind
our
business
,
who
will
want
*NL*
railroads
?
We
do
not
ride
on
the
railroad
;
it
rides
upon
us
.
Did
you
*NL*
ever
think
what
those
sleepers
are
that
underlie
the
railroad
?
Each
one
*NL*
is
a
man
,
an
Irishman
,
or
a
Yankee
man
.
The
rails
are
laid
on
them
,
and
*NL*
they
are
covered
with
sand
,
and
the
cars
run
smoothly
over
them
.
They
*NL*
are
sound
sleepers
,
I
assure
you
.
And
every
few
years
a
new
lot
is
laid
*NL*
down
and
run
over
;
so
that
,
if
some
have
the
pleasure
of
riding
on
a
*NL*
rail
,
others
have
the
misfortune
to
be
ridden
upon
.
And
when
they
run
*NL*
over
a
man
that
is
walking
in
his
sleep
,
a
supernumerary
sleeper
in
the
*NL*
wrong
position
,
and
wake
him
up
,
they
suddenly
stop
the
cars
,
and
make
*NL*
a
hue
and
cry
about
it
,
as
if
this
were
an
exception
.
I
am
glad
to
know
*NL*
that
it
takes
a
gang
of
men
for
every
five
miles
to
keep
the
sleepers
*NL*
down
and
level
in
their
beds
as
it
is
,
for
this
is
a
sign
that
they
may
*NL*
sometime
get
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
we
live
with
such
hurry
and
waste
of
life
?
We
are
determined
*NL*
to
be
starved
before
we
are
hungry
.
Men
say
that
a
stitch
in
time
saves
*NL*
nine
,
and
so
they
take
a
thousand
stitches
today
to
save
nine
tomorrow
.
*NL*
As
for
_
work
_
,
we
have
n't
any
of
any
consequence
.
We
have
the
Saint
Vitus
'
*NL*
dance
,
and
can
not
possibly
keep
our
heads
still
.
If
I
should
only
give
*NL*
a
few
pulls
at
the
parish
bell-rope
,
as
for
a
fire
,
that
is
,
without
*NL*
setting
the
bell
,
there
is
hardly
a
man
on
his
farm
in
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
Concord
,
notwithstanding
that
press
of
engagements
which
was
his
excuse
*NL*
so
many
times
this
morning
,
nor
a
boy
,
nor
a
woman
,
I
might
almost
say
,
*NL*
but
would
forsake
all
and
follow
that
sound
,
not
mainly
to
save
property
*NL*
from
the
flames
,
but
,
if
we
will
confess
the
truth
,
much
more
to
see
*NL*
it
burn
,
since
burn
it
must
,
and
we
,
be
it
known
,
did
not
set
it
on
*NL*
fire
--
or
to
see
it
put
out
,
and
have
a
hand
in
it
,
if
that
is
done
as
*NL*
handsomely
;
yes
,
even
if
it
were
the
parish
church
itself
.
Hardly
a
man
*NL*
takes
a
half-hour
's
nap
after
dinner
,
but
when
he
wakes
he
holds
up
his
*NL*
head
and
asks
,
``
What
's
the
news
?
''
as
if
the
rest
of
mankind
had
stood
*NL*
his
sentinels
.
Some
give
directions
to
be
waked
every
half-hour
,
*NL*
doubtless
for
no
other
purpose
;
and
then
,
to
pay
for
it
,
they
tell
what
*NL*
they
have
dreamed
.
After
a
night
's
sleep
the
news
is
as
indispensable
*NL*
as
the
breakfast
.
``
Pray
tell
me
anything
new
that
has
happened
to
a
man
*NL*
anywhere
on
this
globe
''
--
and
he
reads
it
over
his
coffee
and
rolls
,
that
*NL*
a
man
has
had
his
eyes
gouged
out
this
morning
on
the
Wachito
River
;
*NL*
never
dreaming
the
while
that
he
lives
in
the
dark
unfathomed
mammoth
*NL*
cave
of
this
world
,
and
has
but
the
rudiment
of
an
eye
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
part
,
I
could
easily
do
without
the
post-office
.
I
think
that
*NL*
there
are
very
few
important
communications
made
through
it
.
To
speak
*NL*
critically
,
I
never
received
more
than
one
or
two
letters
in
my
life
--
I
*NL*
wrote
this
some
years
ago
--
that
were
worth
the
postage
.
The
penny-post
*NL*
is
,
commonly
,
an
institution
through
which
you
seriously
offer
a
man
*NL*
that
penny
for
his
thoughts
which
is
so
often
safely
offered
in
jest
.
*NL*
And
I
am
sure
that
I
never
read
any
memorable
news
in
a
newspaper
.
If
we
*NL*
read
of
one
man
robbed
,
or
murdered
,
or
killed
by
accident
,
or
one
house
*NL*
burned
,
or
one
vessel
wrecked
,
or
one
steamboat
blown
up
,
or
one
cow
*NL*
run
over
on
the
Western
Railroad
,
or
one
mad
dog
killed
,
or
one
lot
*NL*
of
grasshoppers
in
the
winter
--
we
never
need
read
of
another
.
One
is
*NL*
enough
.
If
you
are
acquainted
with
the
principle
,
what
do
you
care
for
*NL*
a
myriad
instances
and
applications
?
To
a
philosopher
all
_
news
_
,
as
it
*NL*
is
called
,
is
gossip
,
and
they
who
edit
and
read
it
are
old
women
over
*NL*
their
tea
.
Yet
not
a
few
are
greedy
after
this
gossip
.
There
was
such
*NL*
a
rush
,
as
I
hear
,
the
other
day
at
one
of
the
offices
to
learn
the
*NL*
foreign
news
by
the
last
arrival
,
that
several
large
squares
of
plate
*NL*
glass
belonging
to
the
establishment
were
broken
by
the
pressure
--
news
*NL*
which
I
seriously
think
a
ready
wit
might
write
a
twelve-month
,
or
*NL*
twelve
years
,
beforehand
with
sufficient
accuracy
.
As
for
Spain
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
if
you
know
how
to
throw
in
Don
Carlos
and
the
Infanta
,
*NL*
and
Don
Pedro
and
Seville
and
Granada
,
from
time
to
time
in
the
right
*NL*
proportions
--
they
may
have
changed
the
names
a
little
since
I
saw
the
*NL*
papers
--
and
serve
up
a
bull-fight
when
other
entertainments
fail
,
it
*NL*
will
be
true
to
the
letter
,
and
give
us
as
good
an
idea
of
the
exact
*NL*
state
or
ruin
of
things
in
Spain
as
the
most
succinct
and
lucid
reports
*NL*
under
this
head
in
the
newspapers
:
and
as
for
England
,
almost
the
last
*NL*
significant
scrap
of
news
from
that
quarter
was
the
revolution
of
1649
;
*NL*
and
if
you
have
learned
the
history
of
her
crops
for
an
average
year
,
*NL*
you
never
need
attend
to
that
thing
again
,
unless
your
speculations
are
*NL*
of
a
merely
pecuniary
character
.
If
one
may
judge
who
rarely
looks
into
*NL*
the
newspapers
,
nothing
new
does
ever
happen
in
foreign
parts
,
a
French
*NL*
revolution
not
excepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
news
!
how
much
more
important
to
know
what
that
is
which
was
never
*NL*
old
!
``
Kieou-he-yu
-LRB-
great
dignitary
of
the
state
of
Wei
-RRB-
sent
a
man
to
*NL*
Khoung-tseu
to
know
his
news
.
Khoung-tseu
caused
the
messenger
to
be
*NL*
seated
near
him
,
and
questioned
him
in
these
terms
:
What
is
your
*NL*
master
doing
?
The
messenger
answered
with
respect
:
My
master
desires
*NL*
to
diminish
the
number
of
his
faults
,
but
he
can
not
come
to
the
end
of
*NL*
them
.
The
messenger
being
gone
,
the
philosopher
remarked
:
What
a
worthy
*NL*
messenger
!
What
a
worthy
messenger
!
''
The
preacher
,
instead
of
vexing
the
*NL*
ears
of
drowsy
farmers
on
their
day
of
rest
at
the
end
of
the
week
--
for
*NL*
Sunday
is
the
fit
conclusion
of
an
ill-spent
week
,
and
not
the
fresh
*NL*
and
brave
beginning
of
a
new
one
--
with
this
one
other
draggle-tail
of
*NL*
a
sermon
,
should
shout
with
thundering
voice
,
``
Pause
!
Avast
!
Why
so
*NL*
seeming
fast
,
but
deadly
slow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shams
and
delusions
are
esteemed
for
soundest
truths
,
while
reality
is
*NL*
fabulous
.
If
men
would
steadily
observe
realities
only
,
and
not
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
deluded
,
life
,
to
compare
it
with
such
things
as
we
*NL*
know
,
would
be
like
a
fairy
tale
and
the
Arabian
Nights
'
Entertainments
.
*NL*
If
we
respected
only
what
is
inevitable
and
has
a
right
to
be
,
music
and
*NL*
poetry
would
resound
along
the
streets
.
When
we
are
unhurried
and
wise
,
*NL*
we
perceive
that
only
great
and
worthy
things
have
any
permanent
and
*NL*
absolute
existence
,
that
petty
fears
and
petty
pleasures
are
but
the
*NL*
shadow
of
the
reality
.
This
is
always
exhilarating
and
sublime
.
By
*NL*
closing
the
eyes
and
slumbering
,
and
consenting
to
be
deceived
by
*NL*
shows
,
men
establish
and
confirm
their
daily
life
of
routine
and
*NL*
habit
everywhere
,
which
still
is
built
on
purely
illusory
foundations
.
*NL*
Children
,
who
play
life
,
discern
its
true
law
and
relations
more
clearly
*NL*
than
men
,
who
fail
to
live
it
worthily
,
but
who
think
that
they
are
*NL*
wiser
by
experience
,
that
is
,
by
failure
.
I
have
read
in
a
Hindoo
book
,
*NL*
that
``
there
was
a
king
's
son
,
who
,
being
expelled
in
infancy
from
his
*NL*
native
city
,
was
brought
up
by
a
forester
,
and
,
growing
up
to
maturity
*NL*
in
that
state
,
imagined
himself
to
belong
to
the
barbarous
race
with
*NL*
which
he
lived
.
One
of
his
father
's
ministers
having
discovered
him
,
*NL*
revealed
to
him
what
he
was
,
and
the
misconception
of
his
character
was
*NL*
removed
,
and
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
prince
.
So
soul
,
''
continues
the
*NL*
Hindoo
philosopher
,
``
from
the
circumstances
in
which
it
is
placed
,
*NL*
mistakes
its
own
character
,
until
the
truth
is
revealed
to
it
by
some
*NL*
holy
teacher
,
and
then
it
knows
itself
to
be
Brahme
.
''
I
perceive
that
*NL*
we
inhabitants
of
New
England
live
this
mean
life
that
we
do
because
our
*NL*
vision
does
not
penetrate
the
surface
of
things
.
We
think
that
that
_
is
_
*NL*
which
_
appears
_
to
be
.
If
a
man
should
walk
through
this
town
and
see
only
*NL*
the
reality
,
where
,
think
you
,
would
the
``
Mill-dam
''
go
to
?
If
he
should
*NL*
give
us
an
account
of
the
realities
he
beheld
there
,
we
should
not
*NL*
recognize
the
place
in
his
description
.
Look
at
a
meeting-house
,
or
a
*NL*
court-house
,
or
a
jail
,
or
a
shop
,
or
a
dwelling-house
,
and
say
what
*NL*
that
thing
really
is
before
a
true
gaze
,
and
they
would
all
go
to
pieces
*NL*
in
your
account
of
them
.
Men
esteem
truth
remote
,
in
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
the
system
,
behind
the
farthest
star
,
before
Adam
and
after
the
last
*NL*
man
.
In
eternity
there
is
indeed
something
true
and
sublime
.
But
all
*NL*
these
times
and
places
and
occasions
are
now
and
here
.
God
himself
*NL*
culminates
in
the
present
moment
,
and
will
never
be
more
divine
in
the
*NL*
lapse
of
all
the
ages
.
And
we
are
enabled
to
apprehend
at
all
what
is
*NL*
sublime
and
noble
only
by
the
perpetual
instilling
and
drenching
of
*NL*
the
reality
that
surrounds
us
.
The
universe
constantly
and
obediently
*NL*
answers
to
our
conceptions
;
whether
we
travel
fast
or
slow
,
the
track
is
*NL*
laid
for
us
.
Let
us
spend
our
lives
in
conceiving
then
.
The
poet
or
*NL*
the
artist
never
yet
had
so
fair
and
noble
a
design
but
some
of
his
*NL*
posterity
at
least
could
accomplish
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
spend
one
day
as
deliberately
as
Nature
,
and
not
be
thrown
off
*NL*
the
track
by
every
nutshell
and
mosquito
's
wing
that
falls
on
the
*NL*
rails
.
Let
us
rise
early
and
fast
,
or
break
fast
,
gently
and
without
*NL*
perturbation
;
let
company
come
and
let
company
go
,
let
the
bells
ring
*NL*
and
the
children
cry
--
determined
to
make
a
day
of
it
.
Why
should
we
*NL*
knock
under
and
go
with
the
stream
?
Let
us
not
be
upset
and
overwhelmed
*NL*
in
that
terrible
rapid
and
whirlpool
called
a
dinner
,
situated
in
the
*NL*
meridian
shallows
.
Weather
this
danger
and
you
are
safe
,
for
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
way
is
down
hill
.
With
unrelaxed
nerves
,
with
morning
vigor
,
sail
*NL*
by
it
,
looking
another
way
,
tied
to
the
mast
like
Ulysses
.
If
the
engine
*NL*
whistles
,
let
it
whistle
till
it
is
hoarse
for
its
pains
.
If
the
bell
*NL*
rings
,
why
should
we
run
?
We
will
consider
what
kind
of
music
they
are
*NL*
like
.
Let
us
settle
ourselves
,
and
work
and
wedge
our
feet
downward
*NL*
through
the
mud
and
slush
of
opinion
,
and
prejudice
,
and
tradition
,
and
*NL*
delusion
,
and
appearance
,
that
alluvion
which
covers
the
globe
,
through
*NL*
Paris
and
London
,
through
New
York
and
Boston
and
Concord
,
through
*NL*
Church
and
State
,
through
poetry
and
philosophy
and
religion
,
till
we
*NL*
come
to
a
hard
bottom
and
rocks
in
place
,
which
we
can
call
_
reality
_
,
and
*NL*
say
,
This
is
,
and
no
mistake
;
and
then
begin
,
having
a
_
point
d'appui
_
,
*NL*
below
freshet
and
frost
and
fire
,
a
place
where
you
might
found
a
*NL*
wall
or
a
state
,
or
set
a
lamp-post
safely
,
or
perhaps
a
gauge
,
not
*NL*
a
Nilometer
,
but
a
Realometer
,
that
future
ages
might
know
how
deep
a
*NL*
freshet
of
shams
and
appearances
had
gathered
from
time
to
time
.
If
you
*NL*
stand
right
fronting
and
face
to
face
to
a
fact
,
you
will
see
the
sun
*NL*
glimmer
on
both
its
surfaces
,
as
if
it
were
a
cimeter
,
and
feel
its
*NL*
sweet
edge
dividing
you
through
the
heart
and
marrow
,
and
so
you
will
*NL*
happily
conclude
your
mortal
career
.
Be
it
life
or
death
,
we
crave
only
*NL*
reality
.
If
we
are
really
dying
,
let
us
hear
the
rattle
in
our
throats
*NL*
and
feel
cold
in
the
extremities
;
if
we
are
alive
,
let
us
go
about
our
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
is
but
the
stream
I
go
a-fishing
in
.
I
drink
at
it
;
but
while
I
*NL*
drink
I
see
the
sandy
bottom
and
detect
how
shallow
it
is
.
Its
thin
*NL*
current
slides
away
,
but
eternity
remains
.
I
would
drink
deeper
;
fish
in
*NL*
the
sky
,
whose
bottom
is
pebbly
with
stars
.
I
can
not
count
one
.
I
know
*NL*
not
the
first
letter
of
the
alphabet
.
I
have
always
been
regretting
that
*NL*
I
was
not
as
wise
as
the
day
I
was
born
.
The
intellect
is
a
cleaver
;
it
*NL*
discerns
and
rifts
its
way
into
the
secret
of
things
.
I
do
not
wish
to
*NL*
be
any
more
busy
with
my
hands
than
is
necessary
.
My
head
is
hands
and
*NL*
feet
.
I
feel
all
my
best
faculties
concentrated
in
it
.
My
instinct
tells
*NL*
me
that
my
head
is
an
organ
for
burrowing
,
as
some
creatures
use
their
*NL*
snout
and
fore
paws
,
and
with
it
I
would
mine
and
burrow
my
way
through
*NL*
these
hills
.
I
think
that
the
richest
vein
is
somewhere
hereabouts
;
*NL*
so
by
the
divining-rod
and
thin
rising
vapors
I
judge
;
and
here
I
will
*NL*
begin
to
mine
.

Reading

*NL*
*NL*
With
a
little
more
deliberation
in
the
choice
of
their
pursuits
,
all
men
*NL*
would
perhaps
become
essentially
students
and
observers
,
for
certainly
*NL*
their
nature
and
destiny
are
interesting
to
all
alike
.
In
accumulating
*NL*
property
for
ourselves
or
our
posterity
,
in
founding
a
family
or
a
*NL*
state
,
or
acquiring
fame
even
,
we
are
mortal
;
but
in
dealing
with
*NL*
truth
we
are
immortal
,
and
need
fear
no
change
nor
accident
.
The
oldest
*NL*
Egyptian
or
Hindoo
philosopher
raised
a
corner
of
the
veil
from
the
*NL*
statue
of
the
divinity
;
and
still
the
trembling
robe
remains
raised
,
and
*NL*
I
gaze
upon
as
fresh
a
glory
as
he
did
,
since
it
was
I
in
him
that
was
*NL*
then
so
bold
,
and
it
is
he
in
me
that
now
reviews
the
vision
.
No
dust
*NL*
has
settled
on
that
robe
;
no
time
has
elapsed
since
that
divinity
was
*NL*
revealed
.
That
time
which
we
really
improve
,
or
which
is
improvable
,
is
*NL*
neither
past
,
present
,
nor
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
residence
was
more
favorable
,
not
only
to
thought
,
but
to
serious
*NL*
reading
,
than
a
university
;
and
though
I
was
beyond
the
range
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
circulating
library
,
I
had
more
than
ever
come
within
the
*NL*
influence
of
those
books
which
circulate
round
the
world
,
whose
*NL*
sentences
were
first
written
on
bark
,
and
are
now
merely
copied
from
*NL*
time
to
time
on
to
linen
paper
.

the

n

,
*NL*
``
Being
seated
,
to
run
through
the
region
of
the
spiritual
world
;
I
have
*NL*
had
this
advantage
in
books
.
To
be
intoxicated
by
a
single
glass
of
*NL*
wine
;
I
have
experienced
this
pleasure
when
I
have
drunk
the
liquor
of
*NL*
the
esoteric
doctrines
.
''
I
kept
Homer
's
Iliad
on
my
table
through
the
*NL*
summer
,
though
I
looked
at
his
page
only
now
and
then
.
Incessant
labor
*NL*
with
my
hands
,
at
first
,
for
I
had
my
house
to
finish
and
my
beans
to
*NL*
hoe
at
the
same
time
,
made
more
study
impossible
.
Yet
I
sustained
myself
*NL*
by
the
prospect
of
such
reading
in
future
.
I
read
one
or
two
shallow
*NL*
books
of
travel
in
the
intervals
of
my
work
,
till
that
employment
made
*NL*
me
ashamed
of
myself
,
and
I
asked
where
it
was
then
that
_
I
_
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
student
may
read
Homer
or
A
schylus
in
the
Greek
without
danger
of
*NL*
dissipation
or
luxuriousness
,
for
it
implies
that
he
in
some
measure
*NL*
emulate
their
heroes
,
and
consecrate
morning
hours
to
their
pages
.
The
*NL*
heroic
books
,
even
if
printed
in
the
character
of
our
mother
tongue
,
*NL*
will
always
be
in
a
language
dead
to
degenerate
times
;
and
we
must
*NL*
laboriously
seek
the
meaning
of
each
word
and
line
,
conjecturing
a
*NL*
larger
sense
than
common
use
permits
out
of
what
wisdom
and
valor
and
*NL*
generosity
we
have
.
The
modern
cheap
and
fertile
press
,
with
all
its
*NL*
translations
,
has
done
little
to
bring
us
nearer
to
the
heroic
writers
*NL*
of
antiquity
.
They
seem
as
solitary
,
and
the
letter
in
which
they
*NL*
are
printed
as
rare
and
curious
,
as
ever
.
It
is
worth
the
expense
of
*NL*
youthful
days
and
costly
hours
,
if
you
learn
only
some
words
of
an
*NL*
ancient
language
,
which
are
raised
out
of
the
trivialness
of
the
street
,
*NL*
to
be
perpetual
suggestions
and
provocations
.
It
is
not
in
vain
that
the
*NL*
farmer
remembers
and
repeats
the
few
Latin
words
which
he
has
heard
.
Men
*NL*
sometimes
speak
as
if
the
study
of
the
classics
would
at
length
make
way
*NL*
for
more
modern
and
practical
studies
;
but
the
adventurous
student
will
*NL*
always
study
classics
,
in
whatever
language
they
may
be
written
and
*NL*
however
ancient
they
may
be
.
For
what
are
the
classics
but
the
noblest
*NL*
recorded
thoughts
of
man
?
They
are
the
only
oracles
which
are
not
*NL*
decayed
,
and
there
are
such
answers
to
the
most
modern
inquiry
in
them
*NL*
as
Delphi
and
Dodona
never
gave
.
We
might
as
well
omit
to
study
Nature
*NL*
because
she
is
old
.
To
read
well
,
that
is
,
to
read
true
books
in
a
true
*NL*
spirit
,
is
a
noble
exercise
,
and
one
that
will
task
the
reader
more
than
*NL*
any
exercise
which
the
customs
of
the
day
esteem
.
It
requires
a
training
*NL*
such
as
the
athletes
underwent
,
the
steady
intention
almost
of
the
whole
*NL*
life
to
this
object
.
Books
must
be
read
as
deliberately
and
reservedly
*NL*
as
they
were
written
.
It
is
not
enough
even
to
be
able
to
speak
the
*NL*
language
of
that
nation
by
which
they
are
written
,
for
there
is
a
*NL*
memorable
interval
between
the
spoken
and
the
written
language
,
the
*NL*
language
heard
and
the
language
read
.
The
one
is
commonly
transitory
,
*NL*
a
sound
,
a
tongue
,
a
dialect
merely
,
almost
brutish
,
and
we
learn
*NL*
it
unconsciously
,
like
the
brutes
,
of
our
mothers
.
The
other
is
the
*NL*
maturity
and
experience
of
that
;
if
that
is
our
mother
tongue
,
this
is
*NL*
our
father
tongue
,
a
reserved
and
select
expression
,
too
significant
to
*NL*
be
heard
by
the
ear
,
which
we
must
be
born
again
in
order
to
speak
.
The
*NL*
crowds
of
men
who
merely
spoke
the
Greek
and
Latin
tongues
in
the
Middle
*NL*
Ages
were
not
entitled
by
the
accident
of
birth
to
read
the
works
of
*NL*
genius
written
in
those
languages
;
for
these
were
not
written
in
*NL*
that
Greek
or
Latin
which
they
knew
,
but
in
the
select
language
of
*NL*
literature
.
They
had
not
learned
the
nobler
dialects
of
Greece
and
Rome
,
*NL*
but
the
very
materials
on
which
they
were
written
were
waste
paper
to
*NL*
them
,
and
they
prized
instead
a
cheap
contemporary
literature
.
But
when
*NL*
the
several
nations
of
Europe
had
acquired
distinct
though
rude
written
*NL*
languages
of
their
own
,
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
their
rising
*NL*
literatures
,
then
first
learning
revived
,
and
scholars
were
enabled
to
*NL*
discern
from
that
remoteness
the
treasures
of
antiquity
.
What
the
Roman
*NL*
and
Grecian
multitude
could
not
_
hear
_
,
after
the
lapse
of
ages
a
few
*NL*
scholars
_
read
_
,
and
a
few
scholars
only
are
still
reading
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
much
we
may
admire
the
orator
's
occasional
bursts
of
eloquence
,
*NL*
the
noblest
written
words
are
commonly
as
far
behind
or
above
the
*NL*
fleeting
spoken
language
as
the
firmament
with
its
stars
is
behind
*NL*
the
clouds
.
_
There
_
are
the
stars
,
and
they
who
can
may
read
them
.
*NL*
The
astronomers
forever
comment
on
and
observe
them
.
They
are
not
*NL*
exhalations
like
our
daily
colloquies
and
vaporous
breath
.
What
is
*NL*
called
eloquence
in
the
forum
is
commonly
found
to
be
rhetoric
in
the
*NL*
study
.
The
orator
yields
to
the
inspiration
of
a
transient
occasion
,
and
*NL*
speaks
to
the
mob
before
him
,
to
those
who
can
_
hear
_
him
;
but
the
writer
,
*NL*
whose
more
equable
life
is
his
occasion
,
and
who
would
be
distracted
*NL*
by
the
event
and
the
crowd
which
inspire
the
orator
,
speaks
to
the
*NL*
intellect
and
health
of
mankind
,
to
all
in
any
age
who
can
_
understand
_
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
that
Alexander
carried
the
Iliad
with
him
on
his
expeditions
*NL*
in
a
precious
casket
.
A
written
word
is
the
choicest
of
relics
.
It
is
*NL*
something
at
once
more
intimate
with
us
and
more
universal
than
any
*NL*
other
work
of
art
.
It
is
the
work
of
art
nearest
to
life
itself
.
It
may
*NL*
be
translated
into
every
language
,
and
not
only
be
read
but
actually
*NL*
breathed
from
all
human
lips
;
--
not
be
represented
on
canvas
or
in
marble
*NL*
only
,
but
be
carved
out
of
the
breath
of
life
itself
.
The
symbol
of
*NL*
an
ancient
man
's
thought
becomes
a
modern
man
's
speech
.
Two
thousand
*NL*
summers
have
imparted
to
the
monuments
of
Grecian
literature
,
as
to
her
*NL*
marbles
,
only
a
maturer
golden
and
autumnal
tint
,
for
they
have
carried
*NL*
their
own
serene
and
celestial
atmosphere
into
all
lands
to
protect
them
*NL*
against
the
corrosion
of
time
.
Books
are
the
treasured
wealth
of
the
*NL*
world
and
the
fit
inheritance
of
generations
and
nations
.
Books
,
the
*NL*
oldest
and
the
best
,
stand
naturally
and
rightfully
on
the
shelves
of
*NL*
every
cottage
.
They
have
no
cause
of
their
own
to
plead
,
but
while
they
*NL*
enlighten
and
sustain
the
reader
his
common
sense
will
not
refuse
*NL*
them
.
Their
authors
are
a
natural
and
irresistible
aristocracy
in
*NL*
every
society
,
and
,
more
than
kings
or
emperors
,
exert
an
influence
on
*NL*
mankind
.
When
the
illiterate
and
perhaps
scornful
trader
has
earned
by
*NL*
enterprise
and
industry
his
coveted
leisure
and
independence
,
and
is
*NL*
admitted
to
the
circles
of
wealth
and
fashion
,
he
turns
inevitably
at
*NL*
last
to
those
still
higher
but
yet
inaccessible
circles
of
intellect
and
*NL*
genius
,
and
is
sensible
only
of
the
imperfection
of
his
culture
and
the
*NL*
vanity
and
insufficiency
of
all
his
riches
,
and
further
proves
his
*NL*
good
sense
by
the
pains
which
he
takes
to
secure
for
his
children
that
*NL*
intellectual
culture
whose
want
he
so
keenly
feels
;
and
thus
it
is
that
*NL*
he
becomes
the
founder
of
a
family
.

Those
who
have
not
learned
to
read
the
ancient
classics
in
the
language
*NL*
in
which
they
were
written
must
have
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
history
of
the
human
race
;
for
it
is
remarkable
that
no
transcript
of
*NL*
them
has
ever
been
made
into
any
modern
tongue
,
unless
our
civilization
*NL*
itself
may
be
regarded
as
such
a
transcript
.
Homer
has
never
yet
been
*NL*
printed
in
English
,
nor
A
schylus
,
nor
Virgil
even
--
works
as
refined
,
as
*NL*
solidly
done
,
and
as
beautiful
almost
as
the
morning
itself
;
for
*NL*
later
writers
,
say
what
we
will
of
their
genius
,
have
rarely
,
if
ever
,
*NL*
equalled
the
elaborate
beauty
and
finish
and
the
lifelong
and
heroic
*NL*
literary
labors
of
the
ancients
.
They
only
talk
of
forgetting
them
who
*NL*
never
knew
them
.
It
will
be
soon
enough
to
forget
them
when
we
have
the
*NL*
learning
and
the
genius
which
will
enable
us
to
attend
to
and
appreciate
*NL*
them
.
That
age
will
be
rich
indeed
when
those
relics
which
we
call
*NL*
Classics
,
and
the
still
older
and
more
than
classic
but
even
less
known
*NL*
Scriptures
of
the
nations
,
shall
have
still
further
accumulated
,
when
*NL*
the
Vaticans
shall
be
filled
with
Vedas
and
Zendavestas
and
Bibles
,
with
*NL*
Homers
and
Dantes
and
Shakespeares
,
and
all
the
centuries
to
come
shall
*NL*
have
successively
deposited
their
trophies
in
the
forum
of
the
world
.
By
*NL*
such
a
pile
we
may
hope
to
scale
heaven
at
last
.

*NL*
The
works
of
the
great
poets
have
never
yet
been
read
by
mankind
,
*NL*
for
only
great
poets
can
read
them
.
They
have
only
been
read
as
the
*NL*
multitude
read
the
stars
,
at
most
astrologically
,
not
astronomically
.
*NL*
Most
men
have
learned
to
read
to
serve
a
paltry
convenience
,
as
they
*NL*
have
learned
to
cipher
in
order
to
keep
accounts
and
not
be
cheated
in
*NL*
trade
;
but
of
reading
as
a
noble
intellectual
exercise
they
know
little
*NL*
or
nothing
;
yet
this
only
is
reading
,
in
a
high
sense
,
not
that
which
*NL*
lulls
us
as
a
luxury
and
suffers
the
nobler
faculties
to
sleep
the
*NL*
while
,
but
what
we
have
to
stand
on
tip-toe
to
read
and
devote
our
most
*NL*
alert
and
wakeful
hours
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
having
learned
our
letters
we
should
read
the
best
that
is
*NL*
in
literature
,
and
not
be
forever
repeating
our
a-b-abs
,
and
words
of
*NL*
one
syllable
,
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
classes
,
sitting
on
the
lowest
and
*NL*
foremost
form
all
our
lives
.
Most
men
are
satisfied
if
they
read
or
hear
*NL*
read
,
and
perchance
have
been
convicted
by
the
wisdom
of
one
good
book
,
*NL*
the
Bible
,
and
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
vegetate
and
dissipate
their
*NL*
faculties
in
what
is
called
easy
reading
.
There
is
a
work
in
several
*NL*
volumes
in
our
Circulating
Library
entitled
``
Little
Reading
,
''
which
I
*NL*
thought
referred
to
a
town
of
that
name
which
I
had
not
been
to
.
There
*NL*
are
those
who
,
like
cormorants
and
ostriches
,
can
digest
all
sorts
of
*NL*
this
,
even
after
the
fullest
dinner
of
meats
and
vegetables
,
for
they
*NL*
suffer
nothing
to
be
wasted
.
If
others
are
the
machines
to
provide
*NL*
this
provender
,
they
are
the
machines
to
read
it
.
They
read
the
nine
*NL*
thousandth
tale
about
Zebulon
and
Sophronia
,
and
how
they
loved
as
none
*NL*
had
ever
loved
before
,
and
neither
did
the
course
of
their
true
love
run
*NL*
smooth
--
at
any
rate
,
how
it
did
run
and
stumble
,
and
get
up
again
and
*NL*
go
on
!
how
some
poor
unfortunate
got
up
on
to
a
steeple
,
who
had
better
*NL*
never
have
gone
up
as
far
as
the
belfry
;
and
then
,
having
needlessly
*NL*
got
him
up
there
,
the
happy
novelist
rings
the
bell
for
all
the
world
to
*NL*
come
together
and
hear
,
O
dear
!
how
he
did
get
down
again
!
For
my
part
,
*NL*
I
think
that
they
had
better
metamorphose
all
such
aspiring
heroes
of
*NL*
universal
noveldom
into
man
weather-cocks
,
as
they
used
to
put
heroes
*NL*
among
the
constellations
,
and
let
them
swing
round
there
till
they
are
*NL*
rusty
,
and
not
come
down
at
all
to
bother
honest
men
with
their
pranks
.
*NL*
The
next
time
the
novelist
rings
the
bell
I
will
not
stir
though
the
*NL*
meeting-house
burn
down
.
``
The
Skip
of
the
Tip-Toe-Hop
,
a
Romance
of
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
,
by
the
celebrated
author
of
`
Tittle-Tol-Tan
,
'
to
appear
*NL*
in
monthly
parts
;
a
great
rush
;
do
n't
all
come
together
.
''
All
this
*NL*
they
read
with
saucer
eyes
,
and
erect
and
primitive
curiosity
,
and
with
*NL*
unwearied
gizzard
,
whose
corrugations
even
yet
need
no
sharpening
,
just
*NL*
as
some
little
four-year-old
bencher
his
two-cent
gilt-covered
*NL*
edition
of
Cinderella
--
without
any
improvement
,
that
I
can
see
,
in
the
*NL*
pronunciation
,
or
accent
,
or
emphasis
,
or
any
more
skill
in
extracting
*NL*
or
inserting
the
moral
.
The
result
is
dulness
of
sight
,
a
stagnation
of
*NL*
the
vital
circulations
,
and
a
general
deliquium
and
sloughing
off
of
all
*NL*
the
intellectual
faculties
.
This
sort
of
gingerbread
is
baked
daily
and
*NL*
more
sedulously
than
pure
wheat
or
rye-and-Indian
in
almost
every
oven
,
*NL*
and
finds
a
surer
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
books
are
not
read
even
by
those
who
are
called
good
readers
.
*NL*
What
does
our
Concord
culture
amount
to
?
There
is
in
this
town
,
with
a
*NL*
very
few
exceptions
,
no
taste
for
the
best
or
for
very
good
books
even
*NL*
in
English
literature
,
whose
words
all
can
read
and
spell
.
Even
the
*NL*
college-bred
and
so-called
liberally
educated
men
here
and
elsewhere
*NL*
have
really
little
or
no
acquaintance
with
the
English
classics
;
and
*NL*
as
for
the
recorded
wisdom
of
mankind
,
the
ancient
classics
and
Bibles
,
*NL*
which
are
accessible
to
all
who
will
know
of
them
,
there
are
the
*NL*
feeblest
efforts
anywhere
made
to
become
acquainted
with
them
.
I
know
a
*NL*
woodchopper
,
of
middle
age
,
who
takes
a
French
paper
,
not
for
news
as
he
*NL*
says
,
for
he
is
above
that
,
but
to
``
keep
himself
in
practice
,
''
he
being
*NL*
a
Canadian
by
birth
;
and
when
I
ask
him
what
he
considers
the
best
thing
*NL*
he
can
do
in
this
world
,
he
says
,
beside
this
,
to
keep
up
and
add
to
*NL*
his
English
.
This
is
about
as
much
as
the
college-bred
generally
do
or
*NL*
aspire
to
do
,
and
they
take
an
English
paper
for
the
purpose
.
One
who
*NL*
has
just
come
from
reading
perhaps
one
of
the
best
English
books
will
*NL*
find
how
many
with
whom
he
can
converse
about
it
?
Or
suppose
he
comes
*NL*
from
reading
a
Greek
or
Latin
classic
in
the
original
,
whose
praises
are
*NL*
familiar
even
to
the
so-called
illiterate
;
he
will
find
nobody
at
all
*NL*
to
speak
to
,
but
must
keep
silence
about
it
.
Indeed
,
there
is
hardly
the
*NL*
professor
in
our
colleges
,
who
,
if
he
has
mastered
the
difficulties
of
*NL*
the
language
,
has
proportionally
mastered
the
difficulties
of
the
wit
*NL*
and
poetry
of
a
Greek
poet
,
and
has
any
sympathy
to
impart
to
the
*NL*
alert
and
heroic
reader
;
and
as
for
the
sacred
Scriptures
,
or
Bibles
of
*NL*
mankind
,
who
in
this
town
can
tell
me
even
their
titles
?
Most
men
do
not
*NL*
know
that
any
nation
but
the
Hebrews
have
had
a
scripture
.
A
man
,
any
*NL*
man
,
will
go
considerably
out
of
his
way
to
pick
up
a
silver
dollar
;
but
*NL*
here
are
golden
words
,
which
the
wisest
men
of
antiquity
have
uttered
,
*NL*
and
whose
worth
the
wise
of
every
succeeding
age
have
assured
us
*NL*
of
;
--
and
yet
we
learn
to
read
only
as
far
as
Easy
Reading
,
the
primers
*NL*
and
class-books
,
and
when
we
leave
school
,
the
``
Little
Reading
,
''
and
*NL*
story-books
,
which
are
for
boys
and
beginners
;
and
our
reading
,
our
*NL*
conversation
and
thinking
,
are
all
on
a
very
low
level
,
worthy
only
of
*NL*
pygmies
and
manikins
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
aspire
to
be
acquainted
with
wiser
men
than
this
our
Concord
soil
has
*NL*
produced
,
whose
names
are
hardly
known
here
.
Or
shall
I
hear
the
name
of
*NL*
Plato
and
never
read
his
book
?
As
if
Plato
were
my
townsman
and
I
never
*NL*
saw
him
--
my
next
neighbor
and
I
never
heard
him
speak
or
attended
to
*NL*
the
wisdom
of
his
words
.
But
how
actually
is
it
?
His
Dialogues
,
which
*NL*
contain
what
was
immortal
in
him
,
lie
on
the
next
shelf
,
and
yet
I
never
*NL*
read
them
.
We
are
underbred
and
low-lived
and
illiterate
;
and
in
this
*NL*
respect
I
confess
I
do
not
make
any
very
broad
distinction
between
*NL*
the
illiterateness
of
my
townsman
who
can
not
read
at
all
and
the
*NL*
illiterateness
of
him
who
has
learned
to
read
only
what
is
for
*NL*
children
and
feeble
intellects
.
We
should
be
as
good
as
the
worthies
of
*NL*
antiquity
,
but
partly
by
first
knowing
how
good
they
were
.
We
are
a
race
*NL*
of
tit-men
,
and
soar
but
little
higher
in
our
intellectual
flights
than
*NL*
the
columns
of
the
daily
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
all
books
that
are
as
dull
as
their
readers
.
There
are
*NL*
probably
words
addressed
to
our
condition
exactly
,
which
,
if
we
could
*NL*
really
hear
and
understand
,
would
be
more
salutary
than
the
morning
or
*NL*
the
spring
to
our
lives
,
and
possibly
put
a
new
aspect
on
the
face
of
*NL*
things
for
us
.
How
many
a
man
has
dated
a
new
era
in
his
life
from
the
*NL*
reading
of
a
book
!
The
book
exists
for
us
,
perchance
,
which
will
explain
*NL*
our
miracles
and
reveal
new
ones
.
The
at
present
unutterable
things
we
*NL*
may
find
somewhere
uttered
.
These
same
questions
that
disturb
and
puzzle
*NL*
and
confound
us
have
in
their
turn
occurred
to
all
the
wise
men
;
not
one
*NL*
has
been
omitted
;
and
each
has
answered
them
,
according
to
his
ability
,
*NL*
by
his
words
and
his
life
.
Moreover
,
with
wisdom
we
shall
learn
*NL*
liberality
.
The
solitary
hired
man
on
a
farm
in
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
Concord
,
who
has
had
his
second
birth
and
peculiar
religious
experience
,
*NL*
and
is
driven
as
he
believes
into
the
silent
gravity
and
exclusiveness
*NL*
by
his
faith
,
may
think
it
is
not
true
;
but
Zoroaster
,
thousands
of
*NL*
years
ago
,
travelled
the
same
road
and
had
the
same
experience
;
but
*NL*
he
,
being
wise
,
knew
it
to
be
universal
,
and
treated
his
neighbors
*NL*
accordingly
,
and
is
even
said
to
have
invented
and
established
worship
*NL*
among
men
.
Let
him
humbly
commune
with
Zoroaster
then
,
and
through
the
*NL*
liberalizing
influence
of
all
the
worthies
,
with
Jesus
Christ
himself
,
*NL*
and
let
``
our
church
''
go
by
the
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
boast
that
we
belong
to
the
Nineteenth
Century
and
are
making
the
*NL*
most
rapid
strides
of
any
nation
.
But
consider
how
little
this
village
*NL*
does
for
its
own
culture
.
I
do
not
wish
to
flatter
my
townsmen
,
nor
to
*NL*
be
flattered
by
them
,
for
that
will
not
advance
either
of
us
.
We
need
*NL*
to
be
provoked
--
goaded
like
oxen
,
as
we
are
,
into
a
trot
.
We
have
a
*NL*
comparatively
decent
system
of
common
schools
,
schools
for
infants
only
;
*NL*
but
excepting
the
half-starved
Lyceum
in
the
winter
,
and
latterly
*NL*
the
puny
beginning
of
a
library
suggested
by
the
State
,
no
school
for
*NL*
ourselves
.
We
spend
more
on
almost
any
article
of
bodily
aliment
or
*NL*
ailment
than
on
our
mental
aliment
.
It
is
time
that
we
had
uncommon
*NL*
schools
,
that
we
did
not
leave
off
our
education
when
we
begin
to
be
men
*NL*
and
women
.
It
is
time
that
villages
were
universities
,
and
their
elder
*NL*
inhabitants
the
fellows
of
universities
,
with
leisure
--
if
they
are
,
*NL*
indeed
,
so
well
off
--
to
pursue
liberal
studies
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
Shall
the
world
be
confined
to
one
Paris
or
one
Oxford
forever
?
Can
not
*NL*
students
be
boarded
here
and
get
a
liberal
education
under
the
skies
of
*NL*
Concord
?
Can
we
not
hire
some
Abelard
to
lecture
to
us
?
Alas
!
what
with
*NL*
foddering
the
cattle
and
tending
the
store
,
we
are
kept
from
school
too
*NL*
long
,
and
our
education
is
sadly
neglected
.
In
this
country
,
the
village
*NL*
should
in
some
respects
take
the
place
of
the
nobleman
of
Europe
.
It
*NL*
should
be
the
patron
of
the
fine
arts
.
It
is
rich
enough
.
It
wants
only
*NL*
the
magnanimity
and
refinement
.
It
can
spend
money
enough
on
such
things
*NL*
as
farmers
and
traders
value
,
but
it
is
thought
Utopian
to
propose
*NL*
spending
money
for
things
which
more
intelligent
men
know
to
be
of
*NL*
far
more
worth
.
This
town
has
spent
seventeen
thousand
dollars
on
a
*NL*
town-house
,
thank
fortune
or
politics
,
but
probably
it
will
not
spend
so
*NL*
much
on
living
wit
,
the
true
meat
to
put
into
that
shell
,
in
a
hundred
*NL*
years
.
The
one
hundred
and
twenty-five
dollars
annually
subscribed
for
a
*NL*
Lyceum
in
the
winter
is
better
spent
than
any
other
equal
sum
raised
in
*NL*
the
town
.
If
we
live
in
the
Nineteenth
Century
,
why
should
we
not
enjoy
*NL*
the
advantages
which
the
Nineteenth
Century
offers
?
Why
should
our
life
*NL*
be
in
any
respect
provincial

If
we
will
read
newspapers
,
why
not
*NL*
skip
the
gossip
of
Boston
and
take
the
best
newspaper
in
the
world
at
*NL*
once
?
--
not
be
sucking
the
pap
of
``
neutral
family
''
papers
,
or
browsing
*NL*
``
Olive
Branches
''
here
in
New
England
.
Let
the
reports
of
all
the
learned
*NL*
societies
come
to
us
,
and
we
will
see
if
they
know
anything
.
Why
*NL*
should
we
leave
it
to
Harper
&
Brothers
and
Redding
&
Co.
to
select
*NL*
our
reading
?
As
the
nobleman
of
cultivated
taste
surrounds
himself
*NL*
with
whatever
conduces
to
his
culture
--
genius
--
learning
--
wit
--
books
--
*NL*
paintings
--
statuary
--
music
--
philosophical
instruments
,
and
the
like
;
so
*NL*
let
the
village
do
--
not
stop
short
at
a
pedagogue
,
a
parson
,
a
sexton
,
a
*NL*
parish
library
,
and
three
selectmen
,
because
our
Pilgrim
forefathers
got
*NL*
through
a
cold
winter
once
on
a
bleak
rock
with
these
.
To
act
*NL*
collectively
is
according
to
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
;
and
I
am
*NL*
confident
that
,
as
our
circumstances
are
more
flourishing
,
our
means
are
*NL*
greater
than
the
nobleman
's
.
New
England
can
hire
all
the
wise
men
in
*NL*
the
world
to
come
and
teach
her
,
and
board
them
round
the
while
,
and
not
*NL*
be
provincial
at
all
.
That
is
the
_
uncommon
_
school
we
want
.
Instead
of
*NL*
noblemen
,
let
us
have
noble
villages
of
men
.
If
it
is
necessary
,
omit
*NL*
one
bridge
over
the
river
,
go
round
a
little
there
,
and
throw
one
arch
*NL*
at
least
over
the
darker
gulf
of
ignorance
which
surrounds
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sounds
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
we
are
confined
to
books
,
though
the
most
select
and
classic
,
*NL*
and
read
only
particular
written
languages
,
which
are
themselves
but
*NL*
dialects
and
provincial
,
we
are
in
danger
of
forgetting
the
language
*NL*
which
all
things
and
events
speak
without
metaphor
,
which
alone
is
*NL*
copious
and
standard
.
Much
is
published
,
but
little
printed
.
The
rays
*NL*
which
stream
through
the
shutter
will
be
no
longer
remembered
when
the
*NL*
shutter
is
wholly
removed
.
No
method
nor
discipline
can
supersede
the
*NL*
necessity
of
being
forever
on
the
alert
.
What
is
a
course
of
history
or
*NL*
philosophy
,
or
poetry
,
no
matter
how
well
selected
,
or
the
best
society
,
*NL*
or
the
most
admirable
routine
of
life
,
compared
with
the
discipline
of
*NL*
looking
always
at
what
is
to
be
seen
?
Will
you
be
a
reader
,
a
student
*NL*
merely
,
or
a
seer
?
Read
your
fate
,
see
what
is
before
you
,
and
walk
on
*NL*
into
futurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
read
books
the
first
summer
;
I
hoed
beans
.
Nay
,
I
often
did
*NL*
better
than
this
.
There
were
times
when
I
could
not
afford
to
sacrifice
*NL*
the
bloom
of
the
present
moment
to
any
work
,
whether
of
the
head
or
*NL*
hands
.
I
love
a
broad
margin
to
my
life
.
Sometimes
,
in
a
summer
morning
,
*NL*
having
taken
my
accustomed
bath
,
I
sat
in
my
sunny
doorway
from
sunrise
*NL*
till
noon
,
rapt
in
a
revery
,
amidst
the
pines
and
hickories
and
sumachs
,
*NL*
in
undisturbed
solitude
and
stillness
,
while
the
birds
sing
around
or
*NL*
flitted
noiseless
through
the
house
,
until
by
the
sun
falling
in
at
*NL*
my
west
window
,
or
the
noise
of
some
traveller
's
wagon
on
the
distant
*NL*
highway
,
I
was
reminded
of
the
lapse
of
time
.
I
grew
in
those
seasons
*NL*
like
corn
in
the
night
,
and
they
were
far
better
than
any
work
of
the
*NL*
hands
would
have
been
.
They
were
not
time
subtracted
from
my
life
,
but
*NL*
so
much
over
and
above
my
usual
allowance
.
I
realized
what
the
Orientals
*NL*
mean
by
contemplation
and
the
forsaking
of
works
.
For
the
most
part
,
I
*NL*
minded
not
how
the
hours
went
.
The
day
advanced
as
if
to
light
some
*NL*
work
of
mine
;
it
was
morning
,
and
lo
,
now
it
is
evening
,
and
nothing
*NL*
memorable
is
accomplished
.
Instead
of
singing
like
the
birds
,
I
silently
*NL*
smiled
at
my
incessant
good
fortune
.
As
the
sparrow
had
its
trill
,
*NL*
sitting
on
the
hickory
before
my
door
,
so
had
I
my
chuckle
or
suppressed
*NL*
warble
which
he
might
hear
out
of
my
nest
.
My
days
were
not
days
of
the
*NL*
week
,
bearing
the
stamp
of
any
heathen
deity
,
nor
were
they
minced
into
*NL*
hours
and
fretted
by
the
ticking
of
a
clock
;
for
I
lived
like
the
Puri
*NL*
Indians
,
of
whom
it
is
said
that
``
for
yesterday
,
today
,
and
tomorrow
*NL*
they
have
only
one
word
,
and
they
express
the
variety
of
meaning
by
*NL*
pointing
backward
for
yesterday
forward
for
tomorrow
,
and
overhead
for
*NL*
the
passing
day
.
''
This
was
sheer
idleness
to
my
fellow-townsmen
,
no
*NL*
doubt
;
but
if
the
birds
and
flowers
had
tried
me
by
their
standard
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
been
found
wanting
.
A
man
must
find
his
occasions
in
*NL*
himself
,
it
is
true
.
The
natural
day
is
very
calm
,
and
will
hardly
*NL*
reprove
his
indolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
this
advantage
,
at
least
,
in
my
mode
of
life
,
over
those
who
were
*NL*
obliged
to
look
abroad
for
amusement
,
to
society
and
the
theatre
,
that
*NL*
my
life
itself
was
become
my
amusement
and
never
ceased
to
be
novel
.
*NL*
It
was
a
drama
of
many
scenes
and
without
an
end
.
If
we
were
always
,
*NL*
indeed
,
getting
our
living
,
and
regulating
our
lives
according
to
the
*NL*
last
and
best
mode
we
had
learned
,
we
should
never
be
troubled
with
*NL*
ennui
.
Follow
your
genius
closely
enough
,
and
it
will
not
fail
to
show
*NL*
you
a
fresh
prospect
every
hour
.
Housework
was
a
pleasant
pastime
.
When
*NL*
my
floor
was
dirty
,
I
rose
early
,
and
,
setting
all
my
furniture
out
of
*NL*
doors
on
the
grass
,
bed
and
bedstead
making
but
one
budget
,
dashed
water
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
and
sprinkled
white
sand
from
the
pond
on
it
,
and
then
*NL*
with
a
broom
scrubbed
it
clean
and
white
;
and
by
the
time
the
villagers
*NL*
had
broken
their
fast
the
morning
sun
had
dried
my
house
sufficiently
to
*NL*
allow
me
to
move
in
again
,
and
my
meditations
were
almost
uninterupted
.
*NL*
It
was
pleasant
to
see
my
whole
household
effects
out
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
making
a
little
pile
like
a
gypsy
's
pack
,
and
my
three-legged
table
,
*NL*
from
which
I
did
not
remove
the
books
and
pen
and
ink
,
standing
amid
the
*NL*
pines
and
hickories
.
They
seemed
glad
to
get
out
themselves
,
and
as
if
*NL*
unwilling
to
be
brought
in
.
I
was
sometimes
tempted
to
stretch
an
awning
*NL*
over
them
and
take
my
seat
there
.
It
was
worth
the
while
to
see
the
sun
*NL*
shine
on
these
things
,
and
hear
the
free
wind
blow
on
them
;
so
much
more
*NL*
interesting
most
familiar
objects
look
out
of
doors
than
in
the
house
.
A
*NL*
bird
sits
on
the
next
bough
,
life-everlasting
grows
under
the
table
,
*NL*
and
blackberry
vines
run
round
its
legs
;
pine
cones
,
chestnut
burs
,
and
*NL*
strawberry
leaves
are
strewn
about
.
It
looked
as
if
this
was
the
way
*NL*
these
forms
came
to
be
transferred
to
our
furniture
,
to
tables
,
chairs
,
*NL*
and
bedsteads
--
because
they
once
stood
in
their
midst
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
house
was
on
the
side
of
a
hill
,
immediately
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
larger
wood
,
in
the
midst
of
a
young
forest
of
pitch
pines
and
*NL*
hickories
,
and
half
a
dozen
rods
from
the
pond
,
to
which
a
narrow
*NL*
footpath
led
down
the
hill
.
In
my
front
yard
grew
the
strawberry
,
*NL*
blackberry
,
and
life-everlasting
,
johnswort
and
goldenrod
,
shrub
oaks
*NL*
and
sand
cherry
,
blueberry
and
groundnut
.
Near
the
end
of
May
,
the
sand
*NL*
cherry
-LRB-
_
Cerasus
pumila
_
-RRB-
adorned
the
sides
of
the
path
with
its
delicate
*NL*
flowers
arranged
in
umbels
cylindrically
about
its
short
stems
,
which
*NL*
last
,
in
the
fall
,
weighed
down
with
good-sized
and
handsome
cherries
,
*NL*
fell
over
in
wreaths
like
rays
on
every
side
.
I
tasted
them
out
of
*NL*
compliment
to
Nature
,
though
they
were
scarcely
palatable
.
The
sumach
*NL*
-LRB-
_
Rhus
glabra
_
-RRB-
grew
luxuriantly
about
the
house
,
pushing
up
through
the
*NL*
embankment
which
I
had
made
,
and
growing
five
or
six
feet
the
first
*NL*
season
.
Its
broad
pinnate
tropical
leaf
was
pleasant
though
strange
to
*NL*
look
on
.
The
large
buds
,
suddenly
pushing
out
late
in
the
spring
from
*NL*
dry
sticks
which
had
seemed
to
be
dead
,
developed
themselves
as
by
*NL*
magic
into
graceful
green
and
tender
boughs
,
an
inch
in
diameter
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
,
as
I
sat
at
my
window
,
so
heedlessly
did
they
grow
and
tax
*NL*
their
weak
joints
,
I
heard
a
fresh
and
tender
bough
suddenly
fall
like
*NL*
a
fan
to
the
ground
,
when
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
,
broken
*NL*
off
by
its
own
weight
.
In
August
,
the
large
masses
of
berries
,
which
,
*NL*
when
in
flower
,
had
attracted
many
wild
bees
,
gradually
assumed
their
*NL*
bright
velvety
crimson
hue
,
and
by
their
weight
again
bent
down
and
*NL*
broke
the
tender
limbs
.

As
I
sit
at
my
window
this
summer
afternoon
,
hawks
are
circling
about
my
*NL*
clearing
;
the
tantivy
of
wild
pigeons
,
flying
by
two
and
threes
athwart
*NL*
my
view
,
or
perching
restless
on
the
white
pine
boughs
behind
my
house
,
*NL*
gives
a
voice
to
the
air
;
a
fish
hawk
dimples
the
glassy
surface
of
the
*NL*
pond
and
brings
up
a
fish
;
a
mink
steals
out
of
the
marsh
before
my
door
*NL*
and
seizes
a
frog
by
the
shore
;
the
sedge
is
bending
under
the
weight
of
*NL*
the
reed-birds
flitting
hither
and
thither
;
and
for
the
last
half-hour
I
*NL*
have
heard
the
rattle
of
railroad
cars
,
now
dying
away
and
then
reviving
*NL*
like
the
beat
of
a
partridge
,
conveying
travellers
from
Boston
to
the
*NL*
country
.
For
I
did
not
live
so
out
of
the
world
as
that
boy
who
,
as
I
*NL*
hear
,
was
put
out
to
a
farmer
in
the
east
part
of
the
town
,
but
ere
long
*NL*
ran
away
and
came
home
again
,
quite
down
at
the
heel
and
homesick
.
He
*NL*
had
never
seen
such
a
dull
and
out-of-the-way
place
;
the
folks
were
all
*NL*
gone
off
;
why
,
you
could
n't
even
hear
the
whistle
!
I
doubt
if
there
is
*NL*
such
a
place
in
Massachusetts
now
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth

butt

The
Fitchburg
Railroad
touches
the
pond
about
a
hundred
rods
south
of
*NL*
where
I
dwell
.
I
usually
go
to
the
village
along
its
causeway
,
and
am
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
related
to
society
by
this
link

The
men
on
the
freight
*NL*
trains
,
who
go
over
the
whole
length
of
the
road
,
bow
to
me
as
to
an
old
*NL*
acquaintance
,
they
pass
me
so
often
,
and
apparently
they
take
me
for
an
*NL*
employee
;
and
so
I
am
.
I
too
would
fain
be
a
track-repairer
somewhere
in

The
whistle
of
the
locomotive
penetrates
my
woods
summer
and
winter
,
*NL*
sounding
like
the
scream
of
a
hawk
sailing
over
some
farmer
's
yard
,
*NL*
informing
me
that
many
restless
city
merchants
are
arriving
within
the
*NL*
circle
of
the
town

or
adventurous
country
traders
from
the
other

As
they
come
under
one
horizon

they
shout
their
warning
to
get
off
the

track
to
the
other

heard
sometimes
through
the
circles

two

twenty

With
such
huge

lumbering

the

hands
a

All

know
-RRB-
,
it
seems
as
if
the
earth
had
got
a
*NL*
race
now
worthy
to
inhabit
it
.
If
all
were
as
it
seems
,
and
men
made
the
*NL*
elements
their
servants
for
noble
ends
!
If
the
cloud
that
hangs
over
the
*NL*
engine
were
the
perspiration
of
heroic
deeds
,
or
as
beneficent
as
that
*NL*
which
floats
over
the
farmer
's
fields
,
then
the
elements
and
Nature
*NL*
herself
would
cheerfully
accompany
men
on
their
errands
and
be
their
*NL*
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
watch
the
passage
of
the
morning
cars
with
the
same
feeling
that
I
*NL*
do
the
rising
of
the
sun
,
which
is
hardly
more
regular
.
Their
train
*NL*
of
clouds
stretching
far
behind
and
rising
higher
and
higher
,
going
to
*NL*
heaven
while
the
cars
are
going
to
Boston
,
conceals
the
sun
for
a
minute
*NL*
and
casts
my
distant
field
into
the
shade
,
a
celestial
train
beside
*NL*
which
the
petty
train
of
cars
which
hugs
the
earth
is
but
the
barb
*NL*
of
the
spear
.
The
stabler
of
the
iron
horse
was
up
early
this
winter
*NL*
morning
by
the
light
of
the
stars
amid
the
mountains
,
to
fodder
and
*NL*
harness
his
steed
.
Fire
,
too
,
was
awakened
thus
early
to
put
the
vital
*NL*
heat
in
him
and
get
him
off
.
If
the
enterprise
were
as
innocent
as
it
is
*NL*
early
!
If
the
snow
lies
deep
,
they
strap
on
his
snowshoes
,
and
,
with
the
*NL*
giant
plow
,
plow
a
furrow
from
the
mountains
to
the
seaboard
,
in
which
*NL*
the
cars
,
like
a
following
drill-barrow
,
sprinkle
all
the
restless
men
*NL*
and
floating
merchandise
in
the
country
for
seed
.
All
day
the
fire-steed
*NL*
flies
over
the
country
,
stopping
only
that
his
master
may
rest
,
and
I
am
*NL*
awakened
by
his
tramp
and
defiant
snort
at
midnight
,
when
in
some
remote
*NL*
glen
in
the
woods
he
fronts
the
elements
incased
in
ice
and
snow
;
and
he
*NL*
will
reach
his
stall
only
with
the
morning
star
,
to
start
once
more
on
*NL*
his
travels
without
rest
or
slumber
.
Or
perchance
,
at
evening
,
I
hear
*NL*
him
in
his
stable
blowing
off
the
superfluous
energy
of
the
day
,
that
he
*NL*
may
calm
his
nerves
and
cool
his
liver
and
brain
for
a
few
hours
of
*NL*
iron
slumber
.
If
the
enterprise
were
as
heroic
and
commanding
as
it
is
*NL*
protracted
and
unwearied
!
*NL*
*NL*
Far
through
unfrequented
woods
on
the
confines
of
towns
,
where
once
only
*NL*
the
hunter
penetrated
by
day
,
in
the
darkest
night
dart
these
bright
*NL*
saloons
without
the
knowledge
of
their
inhabitants
;
this
moment
stopping
*NL*
at
some
brilliant
station-house
in
town
or
city
,
where
a
social
crowd
*NL*
is
gathered
,
the
next
in
the
Dismal
Swamp
,
scaring
the
owl
and
fox
.
The
*NL*
startings
and
arrivals
of
the
cars
are
now
the
epochs
in
the
village
*NL*
day
.
They
go
and
come
with
such
regularity
and
precision
,
and
their
*NL*
whistle
can
be
heard
so
far
,
that
the
farmers
set
their
clocks
by
them
,
*NL*
and
thus
one
well-conducted
institution
regulates
a
whole
country
.
*NL*
Have
not
men
improved
somewhat
in
punctuality
since
the
railroad
was
*NL*
invented
?
Do
they
not
talk
and
think
faster
in
the
depot
than
they
did
*NL*
in
the
stage-office
?
There
is
something
electrifying
in
the
atmosphere
*NL*
of
the
former
place
.
I
have
been
astonished
at
the
miracles
it
has
*NL*
wrought
;
that
some
of
my
neighbors
,
who
,
I
should
have
prophesied
,
once
*NL*
for
all
,
would
never
get
to
Boston
by
so
prompt
a
conveyance
,
are
on
*NL*
hand
when
the
bell
rings
.
To
do
things
``
railroad
fashion
''
is
now
the
*NL*
byword
;
and
it
is
worth
the
while
to
be
warned
so
often
and
so
sincerely
*NL*
by
any
power
to
get
off
its
track
.
There
is
no
stopping
to
read
the
*NL*
riot
act
,
no
firing
over
the
heads
of
the
mob
,
in
this
case
.
We
have
*NL*
constructed
a
fate
,
an
_
Atropos
_
,
that
never
turns
aside
.
-LRB-
Let
that
be
*NL*
the
name
of
your
engine
.
-RRB-
Men
are
advertised
that
at
a
certain
hour
and
*NL*
minute
these
bolts
will
be
shot
toward
particular
points
of
the
compass
;
*NL*
yet
it
interferes
with
no
man
's
business
,
and
the
children
go
to
school
*NL*
on
the
other
track
.
We
live
the
steadier
for
it
.
We
are
all
educated
*NL*
thus
to
be
sons
of
Tell
.
The
air
is
full
of
invisible
bolts
.
Every
path
*NL*
but
your
own
is
the
path
of
fate
.
Keep
on
your
own
track
,
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
recommends
commerce
to
me
is
its
enterprise
and
bravery
.
It
does
*NL*
not
clasp
its
hands
and
pray
to
Jupiter
.
I
see
these
men
every
day
go
*NL*
about
their
business
with
more
or
less
courage
and
content
,
doing
more
*NL*
even
than
they
suspect
,
and
perchance
better
employed
than
they
could
*NL*
have
consciously
devised
.
I
am
less
affected
by
their
heroism
who
stood
*NL*
up
for
half
an
hour
in
the
front
line
at
Buena
Vista
,
than
by
the
steady
*NL*
and
cheerful
valor
of
the
men
who
inhabit
the
snowplow
for
their
winter
*NL*
quarters
;
who
have
not
merely
the
three-o
'
-
clock-in-the-morning
courage
,
*NL*
which
Bonaparte
thought
was
the
rarest
,
but
whose
courage
does
not
go
to
*NL*
rest
so
early
,
who
go
to
sleep
only
when
the
storm
sleeps
or
the
sinews
*NL*
of
their
iron
steed
are
frozen
.
On
this
morning
of
the
Great
Snow
,
*NL*
perchance
,
which
is
still
raging
and
chilling
men
's
blood
,
I
bear
the
*NL*
muffled
tone
of
their
engine
bell
from
out
the
fog
bank
of
their
chilled
*NL*
breath
,
which
announces
that
the
cars
_
are
coming
_
,
without
long
delay
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
veto
of
a
New
England
northeast
snow-storm
,
and
*NL*
I
behold
the
plowmen
covered
with
snow
and
rime
,
their
heads
peering
,
*NL*
above
the
mould-board
which
is
turning
down
other
than
daisies
and
the
*NL*
nests
of
field
mice
,
like
bowlders
of
the
Sierra
Nevada
,
that
occupy
an
*NL*
outside
place
in
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Commerce
is
unexpectedly
confident
and
serene
,
alert
,
adventurous
,
and
*NL*
unwearied
.
It
is
very
natural
in
its
methods
withal
,
far
more
so
than
*NL*
many
fantastic
enterprises
and
sentimental
experiments
,
and
hence
its
*NL*
singular
success
.
I
am
refreshed
and
expanded
when
the
freight
train
*NL*
rattles
past
me
,
and
I
smell
the
stores
which
go
dispensing
their
odors
*NL*
all
the
way
from
Long
Wharf
to
Lake
Champlain
,
reminding
me
of
foreign
*NL*
parts
,
of
coral
reefs
,
and
Indian
oceans
,
and
tropical
climes
,
and
the
*NL*
extent
of
the
globe
.
I
feel
more
like
a
citizen
of
the
world
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
palm-leaf
which
will
cover
so
many
flaxen
New
England
heads
*NL*
the
next
summer
,
the
Manilla
hemp
and
cocoanut
husks
,
the
old
junk
,
*NL*
gunny
bags
,
scrap
iron
,
and
rusty
nails
.
This
carload
of
torn
sails
is
*NL*
more
legible
and
interesting
now
than
if
they
should
be
wrought
into
*NL*
paper
and
printed
books
.
Who
can
write
so
graphically
the
history
of
*NL*
the
storms
they
have
weathered
as
these
rents
have
done
?
They
are
*NL*
proof-sheets
which
need
no
correction
.
Here
goes
lumber
from
the
Maine
*NL*
woods
,
which
did
not
go
out
to
sea
in
the
last
freshet
,
risen
four
*NL*
dollars
on
the
thousand
because
of
what
did
go
out
or
was
split
up
;
*NL*
pine
,
spruce
,
cedar
--
first
,
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
qualities
,
*NL*
so
lately
all
of
one
quality
,
to
wave
over
the
bear
,
and
moose
,
and
*NL*
caribou
.
Next
rolls
Thomaston
lime
,
a
prime
lot
,
which
will
get
far
*NL*
among
the
hills
before
it
gets
slacked
.
These
rags
in
bales
,
of
all
hues
*NL*
and
qualities
,
the
lowest
condition
to
which
cotton
and
linen
descend
,
*NL*
the
final
result
of
dress
--
of
patterns
which
are
now
no
longer
cried
up
,
*NL*
unless
it
be
in
Milwaukee
,
as
those
splendid
articles
,
English
,
French
,
*NL*
or
American
prints
,
ginghams
,
muslins
,
etc.
,
gathered
from
all
quarters
*NL*
both
of
fashion
and
poverty
,
going
to
become
paper
of
one
color
or
a
*NL*
few
shades
only
,
on
which
,
forsooth
,
will
be
written
tales
of
real
life
,
*NL*
high
and
low
,
and
founded
on
fact
!
This
closed
car
smells
of
salt
fish
,
*NL*
the
strong
New
England
and
commercial
scent
,
reminding
me
of
the
Grand
*NL*
Banks
and
the
fisheries
.
Who
has
not
seen
a
salt
fish
,
thoroughly
*NL*
cured
for
this
world
,
so
that
nothing
can
spoil
it
,
and
putting
the
*NL*
perseverance
of
the
saints
to
the
blush
?
with
which
you
may
sweep
or
*NL*
pave
the
streets
,
and
split
your
kindlings
,
and
the
teamster
shelter
*NL*
himself
and
his
lading
against
sun
,
wind
,
and
rain
behind
it
--
and
the
*NL*
trader
,
as
a
Concord
trader
once
did
,
hang
it
up
by
his
door
for
a
sign
*NL*
when
he
commences
business
,
until
at
last
his
oldest
customer
can
not
*NL*
tell
surely
whether
it
be
animal
,
vegetable
,
or
mineral
,
and
yet
it
*NL*
shall
be
as
pure
as
a
snowflake
,
and
if
it
be
put
into
a
pot
and
boiled
,
*NL*
will
come
out
an
excellent
dun-fish
for
a
Saturday
's
dinner
.
Next
*NL*
Spanish
hides
,
with
the
tails
still
preserving
their
twist
and
the
angle
*NL*
of
elevation
they
had
when
the
oxen
that
wore
them
were
careering
over
*NL*
the
pampas
of
the
Spanish
Main
--
a
type
of
all
obstinacy
,
and
evincing
*NL*
how
almost
hopeless
and
incurable
are
all
constitutional
vices
.
I
*NL*
confess
,
that
practically
speaking
,
when
I
have
learned
a
man
's
real
*NL*
disposition
,
I
have
no
hopes
of
changing
it
for
the
better
or
worse
*NL*
in
this
state
of
existence
.
As
the
Orientals
say
,
``
A
cur
's
tail
may
be
*NL*
warmed
,
and
pressed
,
and
bound
round
with
ligatures
,
and
after
a
twelve
*NL*
years
'
labor
bestowed
upon
it
,
still
it
will
retain
its
natural
form
.
''
*NL*
The
only
effectual
cure
for
such
inveteracies
as
these
tails
exhibit
is
*NL*
to
make
glue
of
them
,
which
I
believe
is
what
is
usually
done
with
them
,
*NL*
and
then
they
will
stay
put
and
stick
.
Here
is
a
hogshead
of
molasses
*NL*
or
of
brandy
directed
to
John
Smith
,
Cuttingsville
,
Vermont
,
some
*NL*
trader
among
the
Green
Mountains
,
who
imports
for
the
farmers
near
his
*NL*
clearing
,
and
now
perchance
stands
over
his
bulkhead
and
thinks
of
*NL*
the
last
arrivals
on
the
coast
,
how
they
may
affect
the
price
for
him
,
*NL*
telling
his
customers
this
moment
,
as
he
has
told
them
twenty
times
*NL*
before
this
morning
,
that
he
expects
some
by
the
next
train
of
prime
*NL*
quality
.
It
is
advertised
in
the
Cuttingsville
Times
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
things
go
up
other
things
come
down
.
Warned
by
the
whizzing
*NL*
sound
,
I
look
up
from
my
book
and
see
some
tall
pine
,
hewn
on
far
*NL*
northern
hills
,
which
has
winged
its
way
over
the
Green
Mountains
and
*NL*
the
Connecticut
,
shot
like
an
arrow
through
the
township
within
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
and
scarce
another
eye
beholds
it
;
going
*NL*
*NL*
``
to
be
the
mast
*NL*
Of
some
great
ammiral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
hark
!
here
comes
the
cattle-train
bearing
the
cattle
of
a
thousand
*NL*
hills
,
sheepcots
,
stables
,
and
cow-yards
in
the
air
,
drovers
with
their
*NL*
sticks
,
and
shepherd
boys
in
the
midst
of
their
flocks
,
all
but
the
*NL*
mountain
pastures
,
whirled
along
like
leaves
blown
from
the
mountains
by
*NL*
the
September
gales
.
The
air
is
filled
with
the
bleating
of
calves
and
*NL*
sheep
,
and
the
hustling
of
oxen
,
as
if
a
pastoral
valley
were
going
by
.
*NL*
When
the
old
bell-wether
at
the
head
rattles
his
bell
,
the
mountains
*NL*
do
indeed
skip
like
rams
and
the
little
hills
like
lambs
.
A
carload
*NL*
of
drovers
,
too
,
in
the
midst
,
on
a
level
with
their
droves
now
,
their
*NL*
vocation
gone
,
but
still
clinging
to
their
useless
sticks
as
their
badge
*NL*
of
office
.
But
their
dogs
,
where
are
they
?
It
is
a
stampede
to
them
;
*NL*
they
are
quite
thrown
out
;
they
have
lost
the
scent
.
Methinks
I
hear
*NL*
them
barking
behind
the
Peterboro
'
Hills
,
or
panting
up
the
western
*NL*
slope
of
the
Green
Mountains
.
They
will
not
be
in
at
the
death
.
Their
*NL*
vocation
,
too
,
is
gone
.
Their
fidelity
and
sagacity
are
below
par
now
.
*NL*
They
will
slink
back
to
their
kennels
in
disgrace
,
or
perchance
run
wild
*NL*
and
strike
a
league
with
the
wolf
and
the
fox
.
So
is
your
pastoral
life
*NL*
whirled
past
and
away
.
But
the
bell
rings
,
and
I
must
get
off
the
track
*NL*
and
let
the
cars
go
by
;
--
*NL*
*NL*
What
's
the
railroad
to
me
?
*NL*
I
never
go
to
see
*NL*
Where
it
ends
.
*NL*
It
fills
a
few
hollows
,
*NL*
And
makes
banks
for
the
swallows
,
*NL*
It
sets
the
sand
a-blowing
,
*NL*
And
the
blackberries
a-growing
,
*NL*
*NL*
but
I
cross
it
like
a
cart-path
in
the
woods
.
I
will
not
have
my
eyes
*NL*
put
out
and
my
ears
spoiled
by
its
smoke
and
steam
and
hissing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
cars
are
gone
by
and
all
the
restless
world
with
them
,
and
*NL*
the
fishes
in
the
pond
no
longer
feel
their
rumbling
,
I
am
more
alone
*NL*
than
ever
.
For
the
rest
of
the
long
afternoon
,
perhaps
,
my
meditations
*NL*
are
interrupted
only
by
the
faint
rattle
of
a
carriage
or
team
along
the
*NL*
distant
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
on
Sundays
,
I
heard
the
bells
,
the
Lincoln
,
Acton
,
Bedford
,
*NL*
or
Concord
bell
,
when
the
wind
was
favorable
,
a
faint
,
sweet
,
and
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
natural
melody
,
worth
importing
into
the
wilderness
.
At
*NL*
a
sufficient
distance
over
the
woods
this
sound
acquires
a
certain
*NL*
vibratory
hum
,
as
if
the
pine
needles
in
the
horizon
were
the
strings
of
*NL*
a
harp
which
it
swept
.
All
sound
heard
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
*NL*
produces
one
and
the
same
effect
,
a
vibration
of
the
universal
lyre
,
*NL*
just
as
the
intervening
atmosphere
makes
a
distant
ridge
of
earth
*NL*
interesting
to
our
eyes
by
the
azure
tint
it
imparts
to
it
.
There
came
*NL*
to
me
in
this
case
a
melody
which
the
air
had
strained
,
and
which
had
*NL*
conversed
with
every
leaf
and
needle
of
the
wood
,
that
portion
of
the
*NL*
sound
which
the
elements
had
taken
up
and
modulated
and
echoed
from
vale
*NL*
to
vale
.
The
echo
is
,
to
some
extent
,
an
original
sound
,
and
therein
*NL*
is
the
magic
and
charm
of
it
.
It
is
not
merely
a
repetition
of
what
was
*NL*
worth
repeating
in
the
bell
,
but
partly
the
voice
of
the
wood
;
the
same
*NL*
trivial
words
and
notes
sung
by
a
wood-nymph
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
evening
,
the
distant
lowing
of
some
cow
in
the
horizon
beyond
the
*NL*
woods
sounded
sweet
and
melodious
,
and
at
first
I
would
mistake
it
for
*NL*
the
voices
of
certain
minstrels
by
whom
I
was
sometimes
serenaded
,
who
*NL*
might
be
straying
over
hill
and
dale
;
but
soon
I
was
not
unpleasantly
*NL*
disappointed
when
it
was
prolonged
into
the
cheap
and
natural
music
of
*NL*
the
cow
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
satirical
,
but
to
express
my
appreciation
*NL*
of
those
youths
'
singing
,
when
I
state
that
I
perceived
clearly
that
*NL*
it
was
akin
to
the
music
of
the
cow
,
and
they
were
at
length
one
*NL*
articulation
of
Nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regularly
at
half-past
seven
,
in
one
part
of
the
summer
,
after
the
*NL*
evening
train
had
gone
by
,
the
whip-poor-wills
chanted
their
vespers
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
,
sitting
on
a
stump
by
my
door
,
or
upon
the
ridge-pole
of
*NL*
the
house
.
They
would
begin
to
sing
almost
with
as
much
precision
as
a
*NL*
clock
,
within
five
minutes
of
a
particular
time
,
referred
to
the
setting
*NL*
of
the
sun
,
every
evening
.
I
had
a
rare
opportunity
to
become
acquainted
*NL*
with
their
habits
.
Sometimes
I
heard
four
or
five
at
once
in
different
*NL*
parts
of
the
wood
,
by
accident
one
a
bar
behind
another
,
and
so
near
me
*NL*
that
I
distinguished
not
only
the
cluck
after
each
note
,
but
often
that
*NL*
singular
buzzing
sound
like
a
fly
in
a
spider
's
web
,
only
proportionally
*NL*
louder
.
Sometimes
one
would
circle
round
and
round
me
in
the
woods
a
few
*NL*
feet
distant
as
if
tethered
by
a
string
,
when
probably
I
was
near
its
*NL*
eggs
.
They
sang
at
intervals
throughout
the
night
,
and
were
again
as
*NL*
musical
as
ever
just
before
and
about
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
other
birds
are
still
,
the
screech
owls
take
up
the
strain
,
like
*NL*
mourning
women
their
ancient
u-lu-lu
.
Their
dismal
scream
is
truly
Ben
*NL*
Jonsonian
.
Wise
midnight
hags
!
It
is
no
honest
and
blunt
tu-whit
tu-who
*NL*
of
the
poets
,
but
,
without
jesting
,
a
most
solemn
graveyard
ditty
,
the
*NL*
mutual
consolations
of
suicide
lovers
remembering
the
pangs
and
the
*NL*
delights
of
supernal
love
in
the
infernal
groves
.
Yet
I
love
to
hear
*NL*
their
wailing
,
their
doleful
responses
,
trilled
along
the
woodside
;
*NL*
reminding
me
sometimes
of
music
and
singing
birds
;
as
if
it
were
the
*NL*
dark
and
tearful
side
of
music
,
the
regrets
and
sighs
that
would
fain
be
*NL*
sung
.
They
are
the
spirits
,
the
low
spirits
and
melancholy
forebodings
,
*NL*
of
fallen
souls
that
once
in
human
shape
night-walked
the
earth
and
did
*NL*
the
deeds
of
darkness
,
now
expiating
their
sins
with
their
wailing
hymns
*NL*
or
threnodies
in
the
scenery
of
their
transgressions
.
They
give
me
a
*NL*
new
sense
of
the
variety
and
capacity
of
that
nature
which
is
our
common
*NL*
dwelling
.
_
Oh-o-o-o-o
that
I
never
had
been
bor-r-r-r-n
!
_
sighs
one
on
*NL*
this
side
of
the
pond
,
and
circles
with
the
restlessness
of
despair
*NL*
to
some
new
perch
on
the
gray
oaks
.
Then
--
_
that
I
never
had
been
*NL*
bor-r-r-r-n
!
_
echoes
another
on
the
farther
side
with
tremulous
*NL*
sincerity
,
and
--
_
bor-r-r-r-n
!
_
comes
faintly
from
far
in
the
Lincoln
*NL*
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
also
serenaded
by
a
hooting
owl
.
Near
at
hand
you
could
fancy
*NL*
it
the
most
melancholy
sound
in
Nature
,
as
if
she
meant
by
this
to
*NL*
stereotype
and
make
permanent
in
her
choir
the
dying
moans
of
a
human
*NL*
being
--
some
poor
weak
relic
of
mortality
who
has
left
hope
behind
,
and
*NL*
howls
like
an
animal
,
yet
with
human
sobs
,
on
entering
the
dark
valley
,
*NL*
made
more
awful
by
a
certain
gurgling
melodiousness
--
I
find
myself
*NL*
beginning
with
the
letters
_
gl
_
when
I
try
to
imitate
it
--
expressive
of
*NL*
a
mind
which
has
reached
the
gelatinous
,
mildewy
stage
in
the
*NL*
mortification
of
all
healthy
and
courageous
thought
.
It
reminded
me
*NL*
of
ghouls
and
idiots
and
insane
howlings
.
But
now
one
answers
from
far
*NL*
woods
in
a
strain
made
really
melodious
by
distance
--
_
Hoo
hoo
hoo
,
*NL*
hoorer
hoo
_
;
and
indeed
for
the
most
part
it
suggested
only
pleasing
*NL*
associations
,
whether
heard
by
day
or
night
,
summer
or
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rejoice
that
there
are
owls
.
Let
them
do
the
idiotic
and
maniacal
*NL*
hooting
for
men
.
It
is
a
sound
admirably
suited
to
swamps
and
twilight
*NL*
woods
which
no
day
illustrates
,
suggesting
a
vast
and
undeveloped
nature
*NL*
which
men
have
not
recognized
.
They
represent
the
stark
twilight
and
*NL*
unsatisfied
thoughts
which
all
have
.
All
day
the
sun
has
shone
on
the
*NL*
surface
of
some
savage
swamp
,
where
the
single
spruce
stands
hung
with
*NL*
usnea
lichens
,
and
small
hawks
circulate
above
,
and
the
chickadee
lisps
*NL*
amid
the
evergreens
,
and
the
partridge
and
rabbit
skulk
beneath
;
but
now
*NL*
a
more
dismal
and
fitting
day
dawns
,
and
a
different
race
of
creatures
*NL*
awakes
to
express
the
meaning
of
Nature
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
evening
I
heard
the
distant
rumbling
of
wagons
over
*NL*
bridges
--
a
sound
heard
farther
than
almost
any
other
at
night
--
the
*NL*
baying
of
dogs
,
and
sometimes
again
the
lowing
of
some
disconsolate
cow
*NL*
in
a
distant
barn-yard
.
In
the
mean-while
all
the
shore
rang
with
the
*NL*
trump
of
bullfrogs
,
the
sturdy
spirits
of
ancient
wine-bibbers
and
*NL*
wassailers
,
still
unrepentant
,
trying
to
sing
a
catch
in
their
Stygian
*NL*
lake
--
if
the
Walden
nymphs
will
pardon
the
comparison
,
for
though
there
*NL*
are
almost
no
weeds
,
there
are
frogs
there
--
who
would
fain
keep
up
the
*NL*
hilarious
rules
of
their
old
festal
tables
,
though
their
voices
have
*NL*
waxed
hoarse
and
solemnly
grave
,
mocking
at
mirth
,
and
the
wine
has
lost
*NL*
its
flavor
,
and
become
only
liquor
to
distend
their
paunches
,
and
sweet
*NL*
intoxication
never
comes
to
drown
the
memory
of
the
past
,
but
mere
*NL*
saturation
and
waterloggedness
and
distention
.
The
most
aldermanic
,
with
*NL*
his
chin
upon
a
heart-leaf
,
which
serves
for
a
napkin
to
his
drooling
*NL*
chaps
,
under
this
northern
shore
quaffs
a
deep
draught
of
the
*NL*
once
scorned
water
,
and
passes
round
the
cup
with
the
ejaculation
*NL*
_
tr-r-r-oonk
,
tr-r-r
--
oonk
,
tr-r-r-oonk
!
_
and
straightway
comes
over
the
*NL*
water
from
some
distant
cove
the
same
password
repeated
,
where
the
*NL*
next
in
seniority
and
girth
has
gulped
down
to
his
mark
;
and
when
this
*NL*
observance
has
made
the
circuit
of
the
shores
,
then
ejaculates
the
*NL*
master
of
ceremonies
,
with
satisfaction
,
_
tr-r-r-oonk
!
_
and
each
in
*NL*
his
turn
repeats
the
same
down
to
the
least
distended
,
leakiest
,
and
*NL*
flabbiest
paunched
,
that
there
be
no
mistake
;
and
then
the
howl
goes
*NL*
round
again
and
again
,
until
the
sun
disperses
the
morning
mist
,
and
*NL*
only
the
patriarch
is
not
under
the
pond
,
but
vainly
bellowing
_
troonk
_
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
and
pausing
for
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
sure
that
I
ever
heard
the
sound
of
cock-crowing
from
my
*NL*
clearing
,
and
I
thought
that
it
might
be
worth
the
while
to
keep
a
*NL*
cockerel
for
his
music
merely
,
as
a
singing
bird
.
The
note
of
this
once
*NL*
wild
Indian
pheasant
is
certainly
the
most
remarkable
of
any
bird
's
,
and
*NL*
if
they
could
be
naturalized
without
being
domesticated
,
it
would
soon
*NL*
become
the
most
famous
sound
in
our
woods
,
surpassing
the
clangor
of
the
*NL*
goose
and
the
hooting
of
the
owl
;
and
then
imagine
the
cackling
of
the
*NL*
hens
to
fill
the
pauses
when
their
lords
'
clarions
rested
!
No
wonder
*NL*
that
man
added
this
bird
to
his
tame
stock
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
eggs
*NL*
and
drumsticks
.
To
walk
in
a
winter
morning
in
a
wood
where
these
birds
*NL*
abounded
,
their
native
woods
,
and
hear
the
wild
cockerels
crow
on
the
*NL*
trees
,
clear
and
shrill
for
miles
over
the
resounding
earth
,
drowning
*NL*
the
feebler
notes
of
other
birds
--
think
of
it
!
It
would
put
nations
on
*NL*
the
alert
.
Who
would
not
be
early
to
rise
,
and
rise
earlier
and
earlier
*NL*
every
successive
day
of
his
life
,
till
he
became
unspeakably
healthy
,
*NL*
wealthy
,
and
wise
?
This
foreign
bird
's
note
is
celebrated
by
the
poets
*NL*
of
all
countries
along
with
the
notes
of
their
native
songsters
.
All
*NL*
climates
agree
with
brave
Chanticleer
.
He
is
more
indigenous
even
than
*NL*
the
natives
.
His
health
is
ever
good
,
his
lungs
are
sound
,
his
spirits
*NL*
never
flag
.
Even
the
sailor
on
the
Atlantic
and
Pacific
is
awakened
by
*NL*
his
voice
;
but
its
shrill
sound
never
roused
me
from
my
slumbers
.
I
kept
*NL*
neither
dog
,
cat
,
cow
,
pig
,
nor
hens
,
so
that
you
would
have
said
*NL*
there
was
a
deficiency
of
domestic
sounds
;
neither
the
churn
,
nor
the
*NL*
spinning-wheel
,
nor
even
the
singing
of
the
kettle
,
nor
the
hissing
of
*NL*
the
urn
,
nor
children
crying
,
to
comfort
one
.
An
old-fashioned
man
would
*NL*
have
lost
his
senses
or
died
of
ennui
before
this
.
Not
even
rats
in
the
*NL*
wall
,
for
they
were
starved
out
,
or
rather
were
never
baited
in
--
only
*NL*
squirrels
on
the
roof
and
under
the
floor
,
a
whip-poor-will
on
the
*NL*
ridge-pole
,
a
blue
jay
screaming
beneath
the
window
,
a
hare
or
woodchuck
*NL*
under
the
house
,
a
screech
owl
or
a
cat
owl
behind
it
,
a
flock
of
wild
*NL*
geese
or
a
laughing
loon
on
the
pond
,
and
a
fox
to
bark
in
the
night
.
*NL*
Not
even
a
lark
or
an
oriole
,
those
mild
plantation
birds
,
ever
visited
*NL*
my
clearing
.
No
cockerels
to
crow
nor
hens
to
cackle
in
the
yard
.
No
*NL*
yard
!
but
unfenced
nature
reaching
up
to
your
very
sills
.
A
young
forest
*NL*
growing
up
under
your
meadows
,
and
wild
sumachs
and
blackberry
vines
*NL*
breaking
through
into
your
cellar
;
sturdy
pitch
pines
rubbing
and
*NL*
creaking
against
the
shingles
for
want
of
room
,
their
roots
reaching
*NL*
quite
under
the
house
.
Instead
of
a
scuttle
or
a
blind
blown
off
in
the
*NL*
gale
--
a
pine
tree
snapped
off
or
torn
up
by
the
roots
behind
your
*NL*
house
for
fuel
.
Instead
of
no
path
to
the
front-yard
gate
in
the
Great
*NL*
Snow
--
no
gate
--
no
front-yard
--
and
no
path
to
the
civilized
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Solitude
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
delicious
evening
,
when
the
whole
body
is
one
sense
,
and
*NL*
imbibes
delight
through
every
pore
.
I
go
and
come
with
a
strange
liberty
*NL*
in
Nature
,
a
part
of
herself
.
As
I
walk
along
the
stony
shore
of
the
*NL*
pond
in
my
shirt-sleeves
,
though
it
is
cool
as
well
as
cloudy
and
windy
,
*NL*
and
I
see
nothing
special
to
attract
me
,
all
the
elements
are
unusually
*NL*
congenial
to
me
.
The
bullfrogs
trump
to
usher
in
the
night
,
and
the
note
*NL*
of
the
whip-poor-will
is
borne
on
the
rippling
wind
from
over
the
water
.
*NL*
Sympathy
with
the
fluttering
alder
and
poplar
leaves
almost
takes
away
*NL*
my
breath
;
yet
,
like
the
lake
,
my
serenity
is
rippled
but
not
ruffled
.
*NL*
These
small
waves
raised
by
the
evening
wind
are
as
remote
from
storm
*NL*
as
the
smooth
reflecting
surface
.
Though
it
is
now
dark
,
the
wind
still
*NL*
blows
and
roars
in
the
wood
,
the
waves
still
dash
,
and
some
creatures
*NL*
lull
the
rest
with
their
notes
.
The
repose
is
never
complete
.
The
*NL*
wildest
animals
do
not
repose
,
but
seek
their
prey
now
;
the
fox
,
and
*NL*
skunk
,
and
rabbit
,
now
roam
the
fields
and
woods
without
fear
.
They
are
*NL*
Nature
's
watchmen
--
links
which
connect
the
days
of
animated
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
return
to
my
house
I
find
that
visitors
have
been
there
and
left
*NL*
their
cards
,
either
a
bunch
of
flowers
,
or
a
wreath
of
evergreen
,
or
a
*NL*

They
who
come
rarely
*NL*
to
the
woods
take
some
little
piece
of
the
forest
into
their
hands
*NL*
to
play
with
by
the
way
,
which
they
leave
,
either
intentionally
or
*NL*
accidentally
.
One
has
peeled
a
willow
wand
,
woven
it
into
a
ring
,
and
*NL*
dropped
it
on
my
table
.
I
could
always
tell
if
visitors
had
called
in
*NL*
my
absence
,
either
by
the
bended
twigs
or
grass
,
or
the
print
of
their
*NL*
shoes
,
and
generally
of
what
sex
or
age
or
quality
they
were
by
some
*NL*
slight
trace
left
,
as
a
flower
dropped
,
or
a
bunch
of
grass
plucked
and
*NL*
thrown
away
,
even
as
far
off
as
the
railroad
,
half
a
mile
distant
,
or
by
*NL*
the
lingering
odor
of
a
cigar
or
pipe
.
Nay
,
I
was
frequently
notified
of
*NL*
the
passage
of
a
traveller
along
the
highway
sixty
rods
off
by
the
scent
*NL*
of
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
commonly
sufficient
space
about
us
.
Our
horizon
is
never
quite
*NL*
at
our
elbows
.
The
thick
wood
is
not
just
at
our
door
,
nor
the
pond
,
but
*NL*
somewhat
is
always
clearing
,
familiar
and
worn
by
us
,
appropriated
and
*NL*
fenced
in
some
way
,
and
reclaimed
from
Nature
.
For
what
reason
have
I
*NL*
this
vast
range
and
circuit
,
some
square
miles
of
unfrequented
forest
,
*NL*
for
my
privacy
,
abandoned
to
me
by
men
?
My
nearest
neighbor
is
a
mile
*NL*
distant
,
and
no
house
is
visible
from
any
place
but
the
hill-tops
within
*NL*
half
a
mile
of
my
own
.
I
have
my
horizon
bounded
by
woods
all
to
myself
;
*NL*
a
distant
view
of
the
railroad
where
it
touches
the
pond
on
the
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
of
the
fence
which
skirts
the
woodland
road
on
the
other
.
But
*NL*
for
the
most
part
it
is
as
solitary
where
I
live
as
on
the
prairies
.
It
*NL*
is
as
much
Asia
or
Africa
as
New
England
.
I
have
,
as
it
were
,
my
own
sun
*NL*
and
moon
and
stars
,
and
a
little
world
all
to
myself
.
At
night
there
was
*NL*
never
a
traveller
passed
my
house
,
or
knocked
at
my
door
,
more
than
if
*NL*
I
were
the
first
or
last
man
;
unless
it
were
in
the
spring
,
when
at
long
*NL*
intervals
some
came
from
the
village
to
fish
for
pouts
--
they
plainly
*NL*
fished
much
more
in
the
Walden
Pond
of
their
own
natures
,
and
baited
*NL*
their
hooks
with
darkness
--
but
they
soon
retreated
,
usually
with
light
*NL*
baskets
,
and
left
``
the
world
to
darkness
and
to
me
,
''
and
the
black
*NL*
kernel
of
the
night
was
never
profaned
by
any
human
neighborhood
.
I
*NL*
believe
that
men
are
generally
still
a
little
afraid
of
the
dark
,
*NL*
though
the
witches
are
all
hung
,
and
Christianity
and
candles
have
been
*NL*
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
I
experienced
sometimes
that
the
most
sweet
and
tender
,
the
most
*NL*
innocent
and
encouraging
society
may
be
found
in
any
natural
object
,
*NL*
even
for
the
poor
misanthrope
and
most
melancholy
man
.
There
can
be
no
*NL*
very
black
melancholy
to
him
who
lives
in
the
midst
of
Nature
and
has
*NL*
his
senses
still
.
There
was
never
yet
such
a
storm
but
it
was
A
olian
*NL*
music
to
a
healthy
and
innocent
ear
.
Nothing
can
rightly
compel
a
simple
*NL*
and
brave
man
to
a
vulgar
sadness
.
While
I
enjoy
the
friendship
of
the
*NL*
seasons
I
trust
that
nothing
can
make
life
a
burden
to
me
.
The
gentle
*NL*
rain
which
waters
my
beans
and
keeps
me
in
the
house
today
is
not
drear
*NL*
and
melancholy
,
but
good
for
me
too
.
Though
it
prevents
my
hoeing
them
,
*NL*
it
is
of
far
more
worth
than
my
hoeing
.
If
it
should
continue
so
long
as
*NL*
to
cause
the
seeds
to
rot
in
the
ground
and
destroy
the
potatoes
in
the
*NL*
low
lands
,
it
would
still
be
good
for
the
grass
on
the
uplands
,
and
,
*NL*
being
good
for
the
grass
,
it
would
be
good
for
me
.
Sometimes
,
when
I
*NL*
compare
myself
with
other
men
,
it
seems
as
if
I
were
more
favored
by
the
*NL*
gods
than
they
,
beyond
any
deserts
that
I
am
conscious
of
;
as
if
I
had
*NL*
a
warrant
and
surety
at
their
hands
which
my
fellows
have
not
,
and
were
*NL*
especially
guided
and
guarded
.
I
do
not
flatter
myself
,
but
if
it
be
*NL*
possible
they
flatter
me
.
I
have
never
felt
lonesome
,
or
in
the
least
*NL*
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
solitude
,
but
once
,
and
that
was
a
few
weeks
*NL*
after
I
came
to
the
woods
,
when
,
for
an
hour
,
I
doubted
if
the
near
*NL*
neighborhood
of
man
was
not
essential
to
a
serene
and
healthy
life
.
To
*NL*
be
alone
was
something
unpleasant
.
But
I
was
at
the
same
time
conscious
*NL*
of
a
slight
insanity
in
my
mood
,
and
seemed
to
foresee
my
recovery
.
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
a
gentle
rain
while
these
thoughts
prevailed
,
I
was
*NL*
suddenly
sensible
of
such
sweet
and
beneficent
society
in
Nature
,
in
*NL*
the
very
pattering
of
the
drops
,
and
in
every
sound
and
sight
around
my
*NL*
house
,
an
infinite
and
unaccountable
friendliness
all
at
once
like
*NL*
an
atmosphere
sustaining
me
,
as
made
the
fancied
advantages
of
human
*NL*
neighborhood
insignificant
,
and
I
have
never
thought
of
them
since
.
*NL*
Every
little
pine
needle
expanded
and
swelled
with
sympathy
and
*NL*
befriended
me
.
I
was
so
distinctly
made
aware
of
the
presence
of
*NL*
something
kindred
to
me
,
even
in
scenes
which
we
are
accustomed
to
call
*NL*
wild
and
dreary
,
and
also
that
the
nearest
of
blood
to
me
and
humanest
*NL*
was
not
a
person
nor
a
villager
,
that
I
thought
no
place
could
ever
be
*NL*
strange
to
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
my
pleasantest
hours
were
during
the
long
rain-storms
in
the
*NL*
spring
or
fall
,
which
confined
me
to
the
house
for
the
afternoon
as
well
*NL*
as
the
forenoon
,
soothed
by
their
ceaseless
roar
and
pelting
;
when
an
*NL*
early
twilight
ushered
in
a
long
evening
in
which
many
thoughts
had
time
*NL*
to
take
root
and
unfold
themselves
.
In
those
driving
northeast
rains
*NL*
which
tried
the
village
houses
so
,
when
the
maids
stood
ready
with
mop
*NL*
and
pail
in
front
entries
to
keep
the
deluge
out
,
I
sat
behind
my
door
*NL*
in
my
little
house
,
which
was
all
entry
,
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
its
*NL*
protection
.
In
one
heavy
thunder-shower
the
lightning
struck
a
large
*NL*
pitch
pine
across
the
pond
,
making
a
very
conspicuous
and
perfectly
*NL*
regular
spiral
groove
from
top
to
bottom
,
an
inch
or
more
deep
,
and
four
*NL*
or
five
inches
wide
,
as
you
would
groove
a
walking-stick
.
I
passed
it
*NL*
again
the
other
day
,
and
was
struck
with
awe
on
looking
up
and
beholding
*NL*
that
mark
,
now
more
distinct
than
ever
,
where
a
terrific
and
resistless
*NL*
bolt
came
down
out
of
the
harmless
sky
eight
years
ago
.
Men
frequently
*NL*
say
to
me
,
``
I
should
think
you
would
feel
lonesome
down
there
,
and
want
*NL*
to
be
nearer
to
folks
,
rainy
and
snowy
days
and
nights
especially
.
''
I
*NL*
am
tempted
to
reply
to
such
--
This
whole
earth
which
we
inhabit
is
but
*NL*
a
point
in
space
.
How
far
apart
,
think
you
,
dwell
the
two
most
distant
*NL*
inhabitants
of
yonder
star
,
the
breadth
of
whose
disk
can
not
be
*NL*
appreciated
by
our
instruments
?
Why
should
I
feel
lonely
?
is
not
our
*NL*
planet
in
the
Milky
Way
?
This
which
you
put
seems
to
me
not
to
be
the
*NL*
most
important
question
.
What
sort
of
space
is
that
which
separates
*NL*
a
man
from
his
fellows
and
makes
him
solitary
?
I
have
found
that
no
*NL*
exertion
of
the
legs
can
bring
two
minds
much
nearer
to
one
another
.
*NL*
What
do
we
want
most
to
dwell
near
to
?
Not
to
many
men
surely
,
*NL*
the
depot
,
the
post-office
,
the
bar-room
,
the
meeting-house
,
the
*NL*
school-house
,
the
grocery
,
Beacon
Hill
,
or
the
Five
Points
,
where
men
*NL*
most
congregate
,
but
to
the
perennial
source
of
our
life
,
whence
in
all
*NL*
our
experience
we
have
found
that
to
issue
,
as
the
willow
stands
near
*NL*
the
water
and
sends
out
its
roots
in
that
direction
.
This
will
vary
with
*NL*
different
natures
,
but
this
is
the
place
where
a
wise
man
will
dig
*NL*
his
cellar
...
I
one
evening
overtook
one
of
my
townsmen
,
who
has
*NL*
accumulated
what
is
called
``
a
handsome
property
''
--
though
I
never
got
a
*NL*
_
fair
_
view
of
it
--
on
the
Walden
road
,
driving
a
pair
of
cattle
to
market
,
*NL*
who
inquired
of
me
how
I
could
bring
my
mind
to
give
up
so
many
of
the
*NL*
comforts
of
life
.
I
answered
that
I
was
very
sure
I
liked
it
passably
*NL*
well
;
I
was
not
joking
.
And
so
I
went
home
to
my
bed
,
and
left
him
*NL*
to
pick
his
way
through
the
darkness
and
the
mud
to
Brighton
--
or
*NL*
Bright-town
--
which
place
he
would
reach
some
time
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
prospect
of
awakening
or
coming
to
life
to
a
dead
man
makes
*NL*
indifferent
all
times
and
places
.
The
place
where
that
may
occur
is
*NL*
always
the
same
,
and
indescribably
pleasant
to
all
our
senses
.
For
the
*NL*
most
part
we
allow
only
outlying
and
transient
circumstances
to
make
our
*NL*
occasions
.
They
are
,
in
fact
,
the
cause
of
our
distraction
.
Nearest
*NL*
to
all
things
is
that
power
which
fashions
their
being
.
_
Next
_
to
us
the
*NL*
grandest
laws
are
continually
being
executed
.
_
Next
_
to
us
is
not
the
*NL*
workman
whom
we
have
hired
,
with
whom
we
love
so
well
to
talk
,
but
the
*NL*
workman
whose
work
we
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
vast
and
profound
is
the
influence
of
the
subtile
powers
of
Heaven
*NL*
and
of
Earth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
seek
to
perceive
them
,
and
we
do
not
see
them
;
we
seek
to
hear
them
,
*NL*
and
we
do
not
hear
them
;
identified
with
the
substance
of
things
,
they
*NL*
can
not
be
separated
from
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
cause
that
in
all
the
universe
men
purify
and
sanctify
their
*NL*
hearts
,
and
clothe
themselves
in
their
holiday
garments
to
offer
*NL*
sacrifices
and
oblations
to
their
ancestors
.
It
is
an
ocean
of
subtile
*NL*
intelligences
.
They
are
everywhere
,
above
us
,
on
our
left
,
on
our
right
;
*NL*
they
environ
us
on
all
sides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
the
subjects
of
an
experiment
which
is
not
a
little
interesting
*NL*
to
me
.
Can
we
not
do
without
the
society
of
our
gossips
a
little
while
*NL*
under
these
circumstances
--
have
our
own
thoughts
to
cheer
us
?
Confucius
*NL*
says
truly
,
``
Virtue
does
not
remain
as
an
abandoned
orphan
;
it
must
of
*NL*
necessity
have
neighbors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
thinking
we
may
be
beside
ourselves
in
a
sane
sense
.
By
a
*NL*
conscious
effort
of
the
mind
we
can
stand
aloof
from
actions
and
their
*NL*
consequences
;
and
all
things
,
good
and
bad
,
go
by
us
like
a
torrent
.
We
*NL*
are
not
wholly
involved
in
Nature
.
I
may
be
either
the
driftwood
in
the
*NL*
stream
,
or
Indra
in
the
sky
looking
down
on
it
.
I
_
may
_
be
affected
by
a
*NL*
theatrical
exhibition
;
on
the
other
hand
,
I
_
may
not
_
be
affected
by
an
*NL*
actual
event
which
appears
to
concern
me
much
more
.
I
only
know
myself
*NL*
as
a
human
entity
;
the
scene
,
so
to
speak
,
of
thoughts
and
affections
;
*NL*
and
am
sensible
of
a
certain
doubleness
by
which
I
can
stand
as
remote
*NL*
from
myself
as
from
another
.
However
intense
my
experience
,
I
am
*NL*
conscious
of
the
presence
and
criticism
of
a
part
of
me
,
which
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
is
not
a
part
of
me
,
but
spectator
,
sharing
no
experience
,
but
*NL*
taking
note
of
it
,
and
that
is
no
more
I
than
it
is
you
.
When
the
play
,
*NL*
it
may
be
the
tragedy
,
of
life
is
over
,
the
spectator
goes
his
way
.
It
*NL*
was
a
kind
of
fiction
,
a
work
of
the
imagination
only
,
so
far
as
he
was
*NL*
concerned
.
This
doubleness
may
easily
make
us
poor
neighbors
and
friends
*NL*
sometimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
it
wholesome
to
be
alone
the
greater
part
of
the
time
.
To
be
in
*NL*
company
,
even
with
the
best
,
is
soon
wearisome
and
dissipating
.
I
love
*NL*
to
be
alone
.
I
never
found
the
companion
that
was
so
companionable
as
*NL*
solitude
.
We
are
for
the
most
part
more
lonely
when
we
go
abroad
among
*NL*
men
than
when
we
stay
in
our
chambers
.
A
man
thinking
or
working
is
*NL*
always
alone
,
let
him
be
where
he
will
.
Solitude
is
not
measured
by
the
*NL*
miles
of
space
that
intervene
between
a
man
and
his
fellows
.
The
really
*NL*
diligent
student
in
one
of
the
crowded
hives
of
Cambridge
College
is
as
*NL*
solitary
as
a
dervish
in
the
desert
.
The
farmer
can
work
alone
in
the
*NL*
field
or
the
woods
all
day
,
hoeing
or
chopping
,
and
not
feel
lonesome
,
*NL*
because
he
is
employed
;
but
when
he
comes
home
at
night
he
can
not
sit
*NL*
down
in
a
room
alone
,
at
the
mercy
of
his
thoughts
,
but
must
be
where
he
*NL*
can
``
see
the
folks
,
''
and
recreate
,
and
,
as
he
thinks
,
remunerate
himself
*NL*
for
his
day
's
solitude
;
and
hence
he
wonders
how
the
student
can
sit
*NL*
alone
in
the
house
all
night
and
most
of
the
day
without
ennui
and
``
the
*NL*
blues
''
;
but
he
does
not
realize
that
the
student
,
though
in
the
house
,
*NL*
is
still
at
work
in
_
his
_
field
,
and
chopping
in
_
his
_
woods
,
as
the
farmer
*NL*
in
his
,
and
in
turn
seeks
the
same
recreation
and
society
that
the
*NL*
latter
does
,
though
it
may
be
a
more
condensed
form
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Society
is
commonly
too
cheap
.
We
meet
at
very
short
intervals
,
not
*NL*
having
had
time
to
acquire
any
new
value
for
each
other
.
We
meet
at
*NL*
meals
three
times
a
day
,
and
give
each
other
a
new
taste
of
that
old
*NL*
musty
cheese
that
we
are
.
We
have
had
to
agree
on
a
certain
set
of
*NL*
rules
,
called
etiquette
and
politeness
,
to
make
this
frequent
meeting
*NL*
tolerable
and
that
we
need
not
come
to
open
war
.
We
meet
at
the
*NL*
post-office
,
and
at
the
sociable
,
and
about
the
fireside
every
night
;
*NL*
we
live
thick
and
are
in
each
other
's
way
,
and
stumble
over
one
another
,
*NL*
and
I
think
that
we
thus
lose
some
respect
for
one
another
.
*NL*
Certainly
less
frequency
would
suffice
for
all
important
and
hearty
*NL*
communications
.
Consider
the
girls
in
a
factory
--
never
alone
,
hardly
in
*NL*
their
dreams
.
It
would
be
better
if
there
were
but
one
inhabitant
to
*NL*
a
square
mile
,
as
where
I
live
.
The
value
of
a
man
is
not
in
his
skin
,
*NL*
that
we
should
touch
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
a
man
lost
in
the
woods
and
dying
of
famine
and
*NL*
exhaustion
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
,
whose
loneliness
was
relieved
by
the
*NL*
grotesque
visions
with
which
,
owing
to
bodily
weakness
,
his
diseased
*NL*
imagination
surrounded
him
,
and
which
he
believed
to
be
real
.
So
also
,
*NL*
owing
to
bodily
and
mental
health
and
strength
,
we
may
be
continually
*NL*
cheered
by
a
like
but
more
normal
and
natural
society
,
and
come
to
know
*NL*
that
we
are
never
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
a
great
deal
of
company
in
my
house
;
especially
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
when
nobody
calls
.
Let
me
suggest
a
few
comparisons
,
that
some
one
may
*NL*
convey
an
idea
of
my
situation
.
I
am
no
more
lonely
than
the
loon
in
the
*NL*
pond
that
laughs
so
loud
,
or
than
Walden
Pond
itself
.
What
company
has
*NL*
that
lonely
lake
,
I
pray
?
And
yet
it
has
not
the
blue
devils
,
but
the
*NL*
blue
angels
in
it
,
in
the
azure
tint
of
its
waters
.
The
sun
is
alone
,
*NL*
except
in
thick
weather
,
when
there
sometimes
appear
to
be
two
,
but
one
*NL*
is
a
mock
sun
.
God
is
alone
--
but
the
devil
,
he
is
far
from
being
alone
;
*NL*
he
sees
a
great
deal
of
company
;
he
is
legion
.
I
am
no
more
lonely
than
*NL*
a
single
mullein
or
dandelion
in
a
pasture
,
or
a
bean
leaf
,
or
sorrel
,
*NL*
or
a
horse-fly
,
or
a
bumblebee
.
I
am
no
more
lonely
than
the
Mill
Brook
,
*NL*
or
a
weathercock
,
or
the
north
star
,
or
the
south
wind
,
or
an
April
*NL*
shower
,
or
a
January
thaw
,
or
the
first
spider
in
a
new
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
occasional
visits
in
the
long
winter
evenings
,
when
the
snow
*NL*
falls
fast
and
the
wind
howls
in
the
wood
,
from
an
old
settler
and
*NL*
original
proprietor
,
who
is
reported
to
have
dug
Walden
Pond
,
and
stoned
*NL*
it
,
and
fringed
it
with
pine
woods
;
who
tells
me
stories
of
old
time
*NL*
and
of
new
eternity
;
and
between
us
we
manage
to
pass
a
cheerful
evening
*NL*
with
social
mirth
and
pleasant
views
of
things
,
even
without
apples
*NL*
or
cider
--
a
most
wise
and
humorous
friend
,
whom
I
love
much
,
who
keeps
*NL*
himself
more
secret
than
ever
did
Goffe
or
Whalley
;
and
though
he
is
*NL*
thought
to
be
dead
,
none
can
show
where
he
is
buried
.
An
elderly
dame
,
*NL*
too
,
dwells
in
my
neighborhood
,
invisible
to
most
persons
,
in
whose
*NL*
odorous
herb
garden
I
love
to
stroll
sometimes
,
gathering
simples
and
*NL*
listening
to
her
fables
;
for
she
has
a
genius
of
unequalled
fertility
,
*NL*
and
her
memory
runs
back
farther
than
mythology
,
and
she
can
tell
me
the
*NL*
original
of
every
fable
,
and
on
what
fact
every
one
is
founded
,
for
the
*NL*
incidents
occurred
when
she
was
young
.
A
ruddy
and
lusty
old
dame
,
who
*NL*
delights
in
all
weathers
and
seasons
,
and
is
likely
to
outlive
all
her
*NL*
children
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
indescribable
innocence
and
beneficence
of
Nature
--
of
sun
and
wind
*NL*
and
rain
,
of
summer
and
winter
--
such
health
,
such
cheer
,
they
afford
*NL*
forever
!
and
such
sympathy
have
they
ever
with
our
race
,
that
all
Nature
*NL*
would
be
affected
,
and
the
sun
's
brightness
fade
,
and
the
winds
would
*NL*
sigh
humanely
,
and
the
clouds
rain
tears
,
and
the
woods
shed
their
*NL*
leaves
and
put
on
mourning
in
midsummer
,
if
any
man
should
ever
for
a
*NL*
just
cause
grieve
.
Shall
I
not
have
intelligence
with
the
earth
?
Am
I
*NL*
not
partly
leaves
and
vegetable
mould
myself
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
the
pill
which
will
keep
us
well
,
serene
,
contented
?
Not
my
or
*NL*
thy
great-grandfather
's
,
but
our
great-grandmother
Nature
's
universal
,
*NL*
vegetable
,
botanic
medicines
,
by
which
she
has
kept
herself
young
*NL*
always
,
outlived
so
many
old
Parrs
in
her
day
,
and
fed
her
health
with
*NL*
their
decaying
fatness
.
For
my
panacea
,
instead
of
one
of
those
quack
*NL*
vials
of
a
mixture
dipped
from
Acheron
and
the
Dead
Sea
,
which
come
out
*NL*
of
those
long
shallow
black-schooner
looking
wagons
which
we
sometimes
*NL*
see
made
to
carry
bottles
,
let
me
have
a
draught
of
undiluted
morning
*NL*
air
.
Morning
air
!
If
men
will
not
drink
of
this
at
the
fountainhead
*NL*
of
the
day
,
why
,
then
,
we
must
even
bottle
up
some
and
sell
it
in
the
*NL*
shops
,
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
lost
their
subscription
ticket
*NL*
to
morning
time
in
this
world
.
But
remember
,
it
will
not
keep
quite
till
*NL*
noonday
even
in
the
coolest
cellar
,
but
drive
out
the
stopples
long
*NL*
ere
that
and
follow
westward
the
steps
of
Aurora
.
I
am
no
worshipper
of
*NL*
Hygeia
,
who
was
the
daughter
of
that
old
herb-doctor
A
sculapius
,
and
*NL*
who
is
represented
on
monuments
holding
a
serpent
in
one
hand
,
and
in
*NL*
the
other
a
cup
out
of
which
the
serpent
sometimes
drinks
;
but
rather
*NL*
of
Hebe
,
cup-bearer
to
Jupiter
,
who
was
the
daughter
of
Juno
and
wild
*NL*
lettuce
,
and
who
had
the
power
of
restoring
gods
and
men
to
the
vigor
of
*NL*
youth
.
She
was
probably
the
only
thoroughly
sound-conditioned
,
healthy
,
*NL*
and
robust
young
lady
that
ever
walked
the
globe
,
and
wherever
she
came
*NL*
it
was
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Visitors
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
I
love
society
as
much
as
most
,
and
am
ready
enough
to
*NL*
fasten
myself
like
a
bloodsucker
for
the
time
to
any
full-blooded
man
*NL*
that
comes
in
my
way
.
I
am
naturally
no
hermit
,
but
might
possibly
sit
*NL*
out
the
sturdiest
frequenter
of
the
bar-room
,
if
my
business
called
me
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
three
chairs
in
my
house
;
one
for
solitude
,
two
for
friendship
,
*NL*
three
for
society
.
When
visitors
came
in
larger
and
unexpected
*NL*
numbers
there
was
but
the
third
chair
for
them
all
,
but
they
generally
*NL*
economized
the
room
by
standing
up
.
It
is
surprising
how
many
great
men
*NL*
and
women
a
small
house
will
contain
.
I
have
had
twenty-five
or
thirty
*NL*
souls
,
with
their
bodies
,
at
once
under
my
roof
,
and
yet
we
often
parted
*NL*
without
being
aware
that
we
had
come
very
near
to
one
another
.
Many
*NL*
of
our
houses
,
both
public
and
private
,
with
their
almost
innumerable
*NL*
apartments
,
their
huge
halls
and
their
cellars
for
the
storage
of
wines
*NL*
and
other
munitions
of
peace
,
appear
to
be
extravagantly
large
for
their
*NL*
inhabitants
.
They
are
so
vast
and
magnificent
that
the
latter
seem
to
be
*NL*
only
vermin
which
infest
them
.
I
am
surprised
when
the
herald
blows
his
*NL*
summons
before
some
Tremont
or
Astor
or
Middlesex
House
,
to
see
come
*NL*
creeping
out
over
the
piazza
for
all
inhabitants
a
ridiculous
mouse
,
*NL*
which
soon
again
slinks
into
some
hole
in
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
inconvenience
I
sometimes
experienced
in
so
small
a
house
,
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
getting
to
a
sufficient
distance
from
my
guest
when
we
*NL*
began
to
utter
the
big
thoughts
in
big
words
.
You
want
room
for
your
*NL*
thoughts
to
get
into
sailing
trim
and
run
a
course
or
two
before
they
*NL*
make
their
port
.
The
bullet
of
your
thought
must
have
overcome
its
*NL*
lateral
and
ricochet
motion
and
fallen
into
its
last
and
steady
course
*NL*
before
it
reaches
the
ear
of
the
hearer
,
else
it
may
plow
out
again
*NL*
through
the
side
of
his
head
.
Also
,
our
sentences
wanted
room
to
unfold
*NL*
and
form
their
columns
in
the
interval
.
Individuals
,
like
nations
,
must
*NL*
have
suitable
broad
and
natural
boundaries
,
even
a
considerable
neutral
*NL*
ground
,
between
them
.
I
have
found
it
a
singular
luxury
to
talk
across
*NL*
the
pond
to
a
companion
on
the
opposite
side
.
In
my
house
we
were
so
*NL*
near
that
we
could
not
begin
to
hear
--
we
could
not
speak
low
enough
to
*NL*
be
heard
;
as
when
you
throw
two
stones
into
calm
water
so
near
that
they
*NL*
break
each
other
's
undulations
.
If
we
are
merely
loquacious
and
loud
*NL*
talkers
,
then
we
can
afford
to
stand
very
near
together
,
cheek
by
*NL*
jowl
,
and
feel
each
other
's
breath
;
but
if
we
speak
reservedly
and
*NL*
thoughtfully
,
we
want
to
be
farther
apart
,
that
all
animal
heat
and
*NL*
moisture
may
have
a
chance
to
evaporate
.
If
we
would
enjoy
the
most
*NL*
intimate
society
with
that
in
each
of
us
which
is
without
,
or
above
,
*NL*
being
spoken
to
,
we
must
not
only
be
silent
,
but
commonly
so
far
apart
*NL*
bodily
that
we
can
not
possibly
hear
each
other
's
voice
in
any
case
.
*NL*
Referred
to
this
standard
,
speech
is
for
the
convenience
of
those
who
*NL*
are
hard
of
hearing
;
but
there
are
many
fine
things
which
we
can
not
say
*NL*
if
we
have
to
shout
.
As
the
conversation
began
to
assume
a
loftier
and
*NL*
grander
tone
,
we
gradually
shoved
our
chairs
farther
apart
till
they
*NL*
touched
the
wall
in
opposite
corners
,
and
then
commonly
there
was
not
*NL*
room
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
``
best
''
room
,
however
,
my
withdrawing
room
,
always
ready
for
company
,
*NL*
on
whose
carpet
the
sun
rarely
fell
,
was
the
pine
wood
behind
my
house
.
*NL*
Thither
in
summer
days
,
when
distinguished
guests
came
,
I
took
them
,
and
*NL*
a
priceless
domestic
swept
the
floor
and
dusted
the
furniture
and
kept
*NL*
the
things
in
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
guest
came
he
sometimes
partook
of
my
frugal
meal
,
and
it
was
no
*NL*
interruption
to
conversation
to
be
stirring
a
hasty-pudding
,
or
*NL*
watching
the
rising
and
maturing
of
a
loaf
of
bread
in
the
ashes
,
in
the
*NL*
meanwhile
.
But
if
twenty
came
and
sat
in
my
house
there
was
nothing
said
*NL*
about
dinner
,
though
there
might
be
bread
enough
for
two
,
more
than
if
*NL*
eating
were
a
forsaken
habit
;
but
we
naturally
practised
abstinence
;
and
*NL*
this
was
never
felt
to
be
an
offence
against
hospitality
,
but
the
most
*NL*
proper
and
considerate
course
.
The
waste
and
decay
of
physical
life
,
*NL*
which
so
often
needs
repair
,
seemed
miraculously
retarded
in
such
a
*NL*
case
,
and
the
vital
vigor
stood
its
ground
.
I
could
entertain
thus
a
*NL*
thousand
as
well
as
twenty
;
and
if
any
ever
went
away
disappointed
or
*NL*
hungry
from
my
house
when
they
found
me
at
home
,
they
may
depend
upon
*NL*
it
that
I
sympathized
with
them
at
least
.
So
easy
is
it
,
though
many
*NL*
housekeepers
doubt
it
,
to
establish
new
and
better
customs
in
the
place
*NL*
of
the
old
.
You
need
not
rest
your
reputation
on
the
dinners
you
give
.
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
never
so
effectually
deterred
from
frequenting
a
*NL*
man
's
house
,
by
any
kind
of
Cerberus
whatever
,
as
by
the
parade
one
made
*NL*
about
dining
me
,
which
I
took
to
be
a
very
polite
and
roundabout
hint
*NL*
never
to
trouble
him
so
again
.
I
think
I
shall
never
revisit
those
*NL*
scenes
.
I
should
be
proud
to
have
for
the
motto
of
my
cabin
those
lines
*NL*
of
Spenser
which
one
of
my
visitors
inscribed
on
a
yellow
walnut
leaf
*NL*
for
a
card
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
ArrivA
``
d
there
,
the
little
house
they
fill
,
*NL*
Ne
looke
for
entertainment
where
none
was
;
*NL*
Rest
is
their
feast
,
and
all
things
at
their
will
:
*NL*
The
noblest
mind
the
best
contentment
has
.

When
Winslow
,
afterward
governor
of
the
Plymouth
Colony
,
went
with
a
*NL*
companion
on
a
visit
of
ceremony
to
Massasoit
on
foot
through
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
arrived
tired
and
hungry
at
his
lodge
,
they
were
well
received
by
*NL*
the
king
,
but
nothing
was
said
about
eating
that
day
.
When
the
night
*NL*
arrived
,
to
quote
their
own
words
--
``
He
laid
us
on

*NL*
and
his
wife
,
they
at
the
one
end
and
we
at
the
other
,
it
being
only
*NL*
planks
laid
a
foot
from
the
ground
and
a
thin
mat
upon
them
.
Two
more
of
*NL*
his
chief
men
,
for
want
of
room
,
pressed
by
and
upon
us
;
so
that
we
were
*NL*
worse
weary
of
our
lodging
than
of
our
journey
.
''
At
one
o'clock
the
next
*NL*
day
Massasoit
``
brought
two
fishes
that
he
had
shot
,
''
about
thrice
as
big
*NL*
as
a
bream
.
``
These
being
boiled
,
there
were
at
least
forty
looked
for
a
*NL*
share
in
them
;
the
most
eat
of
them
.
This
meal
only
we
had
in
two
nights
*NL*
and
a
day
;
and
had
not
one
of
us
bought
a
partridge
,
we
had
taken
our
*NL*
journey
fasting
.
''
Fearing
that
they
would
be
light-headed
for
want
of
*NL*
food
and
also
sleep
,
owing
to
``
the
savages
'
barbarous
singing
,
-LRB-
for
they
*NL*
use
to
sing
themselves
asleep
,
-RRB-
''
and
that
they
might
get
home
while
they
*NL*
had
strength
to
travel
,
they
departed
.
As
for
lodging
,
it
is
true
they
*NL*
were
but
poorly
entertained
,
though
what
they
found
an
inconvenience
was
*NL*
no
doubt
intended
for
an
honor
;
but
as
far
as
eating
was
concerned
,
I
do
*NL*
not
see
how
the
Indians
could
have
done
better
.
They
had
nothing
to
*NL*
eat
themselves
,
and
they
were
wiser
than
to
think
that
apologies
could
*NL*
supply
the
place
of
food
to
their
guests
;
so
they
drew
their
belts
*NL*
tighter
and
said
nothing
about
it
.
Another
time
when
Winslow
visited
*NL*
them
,
it
being
a
season
of
plenty
with
them
,
there
was
no
deficiency
in
*NL*
this
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
men
,
they
will
hardly
fail
one
anywhere
.
I
had
more
visitors
*NL*
while
I
lived
in
the
woods
than
at
any
other
period
in
my
life
;
I
mean
*NL*
that
I
had
some
.
I
met
several
there
under
more
favorable
circumstances
*NL*
than
I
could
anywhere
else
.
But
fewer
came
to
see
me
on
trivial
*NL*
business
.
In
this
respect
,
my
company
was
winnowed
by
my
mere
distance
*NL*
from
town
.
I
had
withdrawn
so
far
within
the
great
ocean
of
solitude
,
*NL*
into
which
the
rivers
of
society
empty
,
that
for
the
most
part
,
so
*NL*
far
as
my
needs
were
concerned
,
only
the
finest
sediment
was
deposited
*NL*
around
me
.
Beside
,
there
were
wafted
to
me
evidences
of
unexplored
and
*NL*
uncultivated
continents
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
should
come
to
my
lodge
this
morning
but
a
true
Homeric
or
*NL*
Paphlagonian
man
--
he
had
so
suitable
and
poetic
a
name
that
I
am
sorry
I
*NL*
can
not
print
it
here
--
a
Canadian
,
a
woodchopper
and
post-maker
,
who
can
*NL*
hole
fifty
posts
in
a
day
,
who
made
his
last
supper
on
a
woodchuck
which
*NL*
his
dog
caught
.
He
,
too
,
has
heard
of
Homer
,
and
,
``
if
it
were
not
for
*NL*
books
,
''
would
``
not
know
what
to
do
rainy
days
,
''
though
perhaps
he
has
*NL*
not
read
one
wholly
through
for
many
rainy
seasons
.
Some
priest
who
*NL*
could
pronounce
the
Greek
itself
taught
him
to
read
his
verse
in
the
*NL*
Testament
in
his
native
parish
far
away
;
and
now
I
must
translate
to
*NL*
him
,
while
he
holds
the
book
,
Achilles
'
reproof
to
Patroclus
for
his
sad
*NL*
countenance
.
--
``
Why
are
you
in
tears
,
Patroclus
,
like
a
young
girl
?
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
have
you
alone
heard
some
news
from
Phthia
?
*NL*
They
say
that
Menoetius
lives
yet
,
son
of
Actor
,
*NL*
And
Peleus
lives
,
son
of
A
acus
,
among
the
Myrmidons
,
*NL*
Either
of
whom
having
died
,
we
should
greatly
grieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
,
``
That
's
good
.
''
He
has
a
great
bundle
of
white
oak
bark
under
*NL*
his
arm
for
a
sick
man
,
gathered
this
Sunday
morning
.
``
I
suppose
there
's
*NL*
no
harm
in
going
after
such
a
thing
to-day
,
''
says
he
.
To
him
Homer
was
a
*NL*
great
writer
,
though
what
his
writing
was
about
he
did
not
know
.
A
more
*NL*
simple
and
natural
man
it
would
be
hard
to
find
.
Vice
and
disease
,
which
*NL*
cast
such
a
sombre
moral
hue
over
the
world
,
seemed
to
have
hardly
any
*NL*
existence
for
him
.
He
was
about
twenty-eight
years
old
,
and
had
left
*NL*
Canada
and
his
father
's
house
a
dozen
years
before
to
work
in
the
*NL*
States
,
and
earn
money
to
buy
a
farm
with
at
last
,
perhaps
in
his
native
*NL*
country
.
He
was
cast
in
the
coarsest
mould
;
a
stout
but
sluggish
body
,
*NL*
yet
gracefully
carried
,
with
a
thick
sunburnt
neck
,
dark
bushy
hair
,
and
*NL*
dull
sleepy
blue
eyes
,
which
were
occasionally
lit
up
with
expression
.
*NL*
He
wore
a
flat
gray
cloth
cap
,
a
dingy
wool-colored
greatcoat
,
and
*NL*
cowhide
boots
.
He
was
a
great
consumer
of
meat
,
usually
carrying
his
*NL*
dinner
to
his
work
a
couple
of
miles
past
my
house
--
for
he
chopped
all
*NL*
summer
--
in
a
tin
pail
;
cold
meats
,
often
cold
woodchucks
,
and
coffee
in
*NL*
a
stone
bottle
which
dangled
by
a
string
from
his
belt
;
and
sometimes
he
*NL*
offered
me
a
drink
.
He
came
along
early
,
crossing
my
bean-field
,
though
*NL*
without
anxiety
or
haste
to
get
to
his
work
,
such
as
Yankees
exhibit
.
*NL*
He
was
n't
a-going
to
hurt
himself
.
He
did
n't
care
if
he
only
earned
his
*NL*
board
.
Frequently
he
would
leave
his
dinner
in
the
bushes
,
when
his
*NL*
dog
had
caught
a
woodchuck
by
the
way
,
and
go
back
a
mile
and
a
half
to
*NL*
dress
it
and
leave
it
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
where
he
boarded
,
after
*NL*
deliberating
first
for
half
an
hour
whether
he
could
not
sink
it
in
the
*NL*
pond
safely
till
nightfall
--
loving
to
dwell
long
upon
these
themes
.
He
*NL*
would
say
,
as
he
went
by
in
the
morning
,
``
How
thick
the
pigeons
are
!
If
*NL*
working
every
day
were
not
my
trade
,
I
could
get
all
the
meat
I
should
*NL*
want
by
hunting-pigeons
,
woodchucks
,
rabbits
,
partridges
--
by
gosh
!
I
*NL*
could
get
all
I
should
want
for
a
week
in
one
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
skilful
chopper
,
and
indulged
in
some
flourishes
and
ornaments
*NL*
in
his
art
.
He
cut
his
trees
level
and
close
to
the
ground
,
that
the
*NL*
sprouts
which
came
up
afterward
might
be
more
vigorous
and
a
sled
might
*NL*
slide
over
the
stumps
;
and
instead
of
leaving
a
whole
tree
to
support
*NL*
his
corded
wood
,
he
would
pare
it
away
to
a
slender
stake
or
splinter
*NL*
which
you
could
break
off
with
your
hand
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
interested
me
because
he
was
so
quiet
and
solitary
and
so
happy
*NL*
withal
;
a
well
of
good
humor
and
contentment
which
overflowed
at
his
*NL*
eyes
.
His
mirth
was
without
alloy
.
Sometimes
I
saw
him
at
his
work
*NL*
in
the
woods
,
felling
trees
,
and
he
would
greet
me
with
a
laugh
of
*NL*
inexpressible
satisfaction
,
and
a
salutation
in
Canadian
French
,
though
*NL*
he
spoke
English
as
well
.
When
I
approached
him
he
would
suspend
his
*NL*
work
,
and
with
half-suppressed
mirth
lie
along
the
trunk
of
a
pine
which
*NL*
he
had
felled
,
and
,
peeling
off
the
inner
bark
,
roll
it
up
into
a
ball
*NL*
and
chew
it
while
he
laughed
and
talked
.
Such
an
exuberance
of
animal
*NL*
spirits
had
he
that
he
sometimes
tumbled
down
and
rolled
on
the
ground
*NL*
with
laughter
at
anything
which
made
him
think
and
tickled
him
.
Looking
*NL*
round
upon
the
trees
he
would
exclaim
--
``
By
George
!
I
can
enjoy
myself
*NL*
well
enough
here
chopping
;
I
want
no
better
sport
.
''
Sometimes
,
when
at
*NL*
leisure
,
he
amused
himself
all
day
in
the
woods
with
a
pocket
pistol
,
*NL*
firing
salutes
to
himself
at
regular
intervals
as
he
walked
.
In
the
*NL*
winter
he
had
a
fire
by
which
at
noon
he
warmed
his
coffee
in
a
kettle
;
*NL*
and
as
he
sat
on
a
log
to
eat
his
dinner
the
chickadees
would
sometimes
*NL*
come
round
and
alight
on
his
arm
and
peck
at
the
potato
in
his
fingers
;
*NL*
and
he
said
that
he
``
liked
to
have
the
little
_
fellers
_
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
him
the
animal
man
chiefly
was
developed
.
In
physical
endurance
and
*NL*
contentment
he
was
cousin
to
the
pine
and
the
rock
.
I
asked
him
once
*NL*
if
he
was
not
sometimes
tired
at
night
,
after
working
all
day
;
and
he
*NL*
answered
,
with
a
sincere
and
serious
look
,
``
Gorrappit
,
I
never
was
tired
*NL*
in
my
life
.
''
But
the
intellectual
and
what
is
called
spiritual
man
in
*NL*
him
were
slumbering
as
in
an
infant
.
He
had
been
instructed
only
in
that
*NL*
innocent
and
ineffectual
way
in
which
the
Catholic
priests
teach
the
*NL*
aborigines
,
by
which
the
pupil
is
never
educated
to
the
degree
of
*NL*
consciousness
,
but
only
to
the
degree
of
trust
and
reverence
,
and
a
*NL*
child
is
not
made
a
man
,
but
kept
a
child
.
When
Nature
made
him
,
she
*NL*
gave
him
a
strong
body
and
contentment
for
his
portion
,
and
propped
him
*NL*
on
every
side
with
reverence
and
reliance
,
that
he
might
live
out
his
*NL*
threescore
years
and
ten
a
child
.
He
was
so
genuine
and
unsophisticated
*NL*
that
no
introduction
would
serve
to
introduce
him
,
more
than
if
you
*NL*
introduced
a
woodchuck
to
your
neighbor
.
He
had
got
to
find
him
out
as
*NL*
you
did
.
He
would
not
play
any
part
.
Men
paid
him
wages
for
work
,
and
*NL*
so
helped
to
feed
and
clothe
him
;
but
he
never
exchanged
opinions
with
*NL*
them
.
He
was
so
simply
and
naturally
humble
--
if
he
can
be
called
humble
*NL*
who
never
aspires
--
that
humility
was
no
distinct
quality
in
him
,
nor
*NL*
could
he
conceive
of
it
.
Wiser
men
were
demigods
to
him
.
If
you
told
*NL*
him
that
such
a
one
was
coming
,
he
did
as
if
he
thought
that
anything
so
*NL*
grand
would
expect
nothing
of
himself
,
but
take
all
the
responsibility
*NL*
on
itself
,
and
let
him
be
forgotten
still
.
He
never
heard
the
sound
of
*NL*
praise
.
He
particularly
reverenced
the
writer
and
the
preacher
.
Their
*NL*
performances
were
miracles
.
When
I
told
him
that
I
wrote
considerably
,
*NL*
he
thought
for
a
long
time
that
it
was
merely
the
handwriting
which
I
*NL*
meant
,
for
he
could
write
a
remarkably
good
hand
himself
.
I
sometimes
*NL*
found
the
name
of
his
native
parish
handsomely
written
in
the
snow
by
*NL*
the
highway
,
with
the
proper
French
accent
,
and
knew
that
he
had
passed
.
*NL*
I
asked
him
if
he
ever
wished
to
write
his
thoughts
.
He
said
that
he
had
*NL*
read
and
written
letters
for
those
who
could
not
,
but
he
never
tried
to
*NL*
write
thoughts
--
no
,
he
could
not
,
he
could
not
tell
what
to
put
first
,
*NL*
it
would
kill
him
,
and
then
there
was
spelling
to
be
attended
to
at
the
*NL*
same
time
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
that
a
distinguished
wise
man
and
reformer
asked
him
if
he
did
*NL*
not
want
the
world
to
be
changed
;
but
he
answered
with
a
chuckle
of
*NL*
surprise
in
his
Canadian
accent
,
not
knowing
that
the
question
had
ever
*NL*
been
entertained
before
,
``
No
,
I
like
it
well
enough
.
''
It
would
have
*NL*
suggested
many
things
to
a
philosopher
to
have
dealings
with
him
.
To
*NL*
a
stranger
he
appeared
to
know
nothing
of
things
in
general
;
yet
I
*NL*
sometimes
saw
in
him
a
man
whom
I
had
not
seen
before
,
and
I
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
he
was
as
wise
as
Shakespeare
or
as
simply
ignorant
as
*NL*
a
child
,
whether
to
suspect
him
of
a
fine
poetic
consciousness
or
of
*NL*
stupidity
.
A
townsman
told
me
that
when
he
met
him
sauntering
through
*NL*
the
village
in
his
small
close-fitting
cap
,
and
whistling
to
himself
,
he
*NL*
reminded
him
of
a
prince
in
disguise
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
only
books
were
an
almanac
and
an
arithmetic
,
in
which
last
he
was
*NL*
considerably
expert
.
The
former
was
a
sort
of
cyclopaedia
to
him
,
which
*NL*
he
supposed
to
contain
an
abstract
of
human
knowledge
,
as
indeed
it
does
*NL*
to
a
considerable
extent
.
I
loved
to
sound
him
on
the
various
reforms
*NL*
of
the
day
,
and
he
never
failed
to
look
at
them
in
the
most
simple
and
*NL*
practical
light
.
He
had
never
heard
of
such
things
before
.
Could
he
do
*NL*
without
factories
?
I
asked
.
He
had
worn
the
home-made
Vermont
gray
,
he
*NL*
said
,
and
that
was
good
.
Could
he
dispense
with
tea
and
coffee
?
Did
this
*NL*
country
afford
any
beverage
beside
water
?
He
had
soaked
hemlock
leaves
*NL*
in
water
and
drank
it
,
and
thought
that
was
better
than
water
in
warm
*NL*
weather
.
When
I
asked
him
if
he
could
do
without
money
,
he
showed
the
*NL*
convenience
of
money
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
and
coincide
with
the
*NL*
most
philosophical
accounts
of
the
origin
of
this
institution
,
and
the
*NL*
very
derivation
of
the
word
_
pecunia
_
.
If
an
ox
were
his
property
,
and
he
*NL*
wished
to
get
needles
and
thread
at
the
store
,
he
thought
it
would
be
*NL*
inconvenient
and
impossible
soon
to
go
on
mortgaging
some
portion
of
*NL*
the
creature
each
time
to
that
amount
.
He
could
defend
many
institutions
*NL*
better
than
any
philosopher
,
because
,
in
describing
them
as
they
*NL*
concerned
him
,
he
gave
the
true
reason
for
their
prevalence
,
and
*NL*
speculation
had
not
suggested
to
him
any
other
.
At
another
time
,
hearing
*NL*
Plato
's
definition
of
a
man
--
a
biped
without
feathers
--
and
that
one
*NL*
exhibited
a
cock
plucked
and
called
it
Plato
's
man
,
he
thought
it
*NL*
an
important
difference
that
the
_
knees
_
bent
the
wrong
way
.
He
would
*NL*
sometimes
exclaim
,
``
How
I
love
to
talk
!
By
George
,
I
could
talk
all
*NL*
day
!
''
I
asked
him
once
,
when
I
had
not
seen
him
for
many
months
,
if
he
*NL*
had
got
a
new
idea
this
summer
.
``
Good
Lord
''
--
said
he
,
``
a
man
that
has
*NL*
to
work
as
I
do
,
if
he
does
not
forget
the
ideas
he
has
had
,
he
will
do
*NL*
well
.
May
be
the
man
you
hoe
with
is
inclined
to
race
;
then
,
by
gorry
,
*NL*
your
mind
must
be
there
;
you
think
of
weeds
.
''
He
would
sometimes
ask
me
*NL*
first
on
such
occasions
,
if
I
had
made
any
improvement
.
One
winter
day
I
*NL*
asked
him
if
he
was
always
satisfied
with
himself
,
wishing
to
suggest
a
*NL*
substitute
within
him
for
the
priest
without
,
and
some
higher
motive
for
*NL*
living
.
``
Satisfied
!
''
said
he
;
``
some
men
are
satisfied
with
one
thing
,
*NL*
and
some
with
another
.
One
man
,
perhaps
,
if
he
has
got
enough
,
will
be
*NL*
satisfied
to
sit
all
day
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
his
belly
to
the
*NL*
table
,
by
George
!
''
Yet
I
never
,
by
any
manoeuvring
,
could
get
him
to
*NL*
take
the
spiritual
view
of
things
;
the
highest
that
he
appeared
to
*NL*
conceive
of
was
a
simple
expediency
,
such
as
you
might
expect
an
*NL*
animal
to
appreciate
;
and
this
,
practically
,
is
true
of
most
men
.
If
*NL*
I
suggested
any
improvement
in
his
mode
of
life
,
he
merely
answered
,
*NL*
without
expressing
any
regret
,
that
it
was
too
late
.
Yet
he
thoroughly
*NL*
believed
in
honesty
and
the
like
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
certain
positive
originality
,
however
slight
,
to
be
detected
*NL*
in
him
,
and
I
occasionally
observed
that
he
was
thinking
for
himself
and
*NL*
expressing
his
own
opinion
,
a
phenomenon
so
rare
that
I
would
any
day
*NL*
walk
ten
miles
to
observe
it
,
and
it
amounted
to
the
re-origination
of
*NL*
many
of
the
institutions
of
society
.
Though
he
hesitated
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
failed
to
express
himself
distinctly
,
he
always
had
a
presentable
*NL*
thought
behind
.
Yet
his
thinking
was
so
primitive
and
immersed
in
his
*NL*
animal
life
,
that
,
though
more
promising
than
a
merely
learned
man
's
,
*NL*
it
rarely
ripened
to
anything
which
can
be
reported
.
He
suggested
that
*NL*
there
might
be
men
of
genius
in
the
lowest
grades
of
life
,
however
*NL*
permanently
humble
and
illiterate
,
who
take
their
own
view
always
,
or
do
*NL*
not
pretend
to
see
at
all
;
who
are
as
bottomless
even
as
Walden
Pond
was
*NL*
thought
to
be
,
though
they
may
be
dark
and
muddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
traveller
came
out
of
his
way
to
see
me
and
the
inside
of
my
*NL*
house
,
and
,
as
an
excuse
for
calling
,
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
.
I
told
*NL*
them
that
I
drank
at
the
pond
,
and
pointed
thither
,
offering
to
lend
*NL*
them
a
dipper
.
Far
off
as
I
lived
,
I
was
not
exempted
from
the
annual
*NL*
visitation
which
occurs
,
methinks
,
about
the
first
of
April
,
when
*NL*
everybody
is
on
the
move
;
and
I
had
my
share
of
good
luck
,
though
there
*NL*
were
some
curious
specimens
among
my
visitors
.
Half-witted
men
from
the
*NL*
almshouse
and
elsewhere
came
to
see
me
;
but
I
endeavored
to
make
them
*NL*
exercise
all
the
wit
they
had
,
and
make
their
confessions
to
me
;
in
such
*NL*
cases
making
wit
the
theme
of
our
conversation
;
and
so
was
compensated
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
found
some
of
them
to
be
wiser
than
the
so-called
_
overseers
_
*NL*
of
the
poor
and
selectmen
of
the
town
,
and
thought
it
was
time
that
the
*NL*
tables
were
turned
.
With
respect
to
wit
,
I
learned
that
there
was
not
*NL*
much
difference
between
the
half
and
the
whole
.
One
day
,
in
particular
,
*NL*
an
inoffensive
,
simple-minded
pauper
,
whom
with
others
I
had
often
seen
*NL*
used
as
fencing
stuff
,
standing
or
sitting
on
a
bushel
in
the
fields
to
*NL*
keep
cattle
and
himself
from
straying
,
visited
me
,
and
expressed
a
wish
*NL*
to
live
as
I
did
.
He
told
me
,
with
the
utmost
simplicity
and
truth
,
*NL*
quite
superior
,
or
rather
_
inferior
_
,
to
anything
that
is
called
humility
,
*NL*
that
he
was
``
deficient
in
intellect
.
''
These
were
his
words
.
The
Lord
*NL*
had
made
him
so
,
yet
he
supposed
the
Lord
cared
as
much
for
him
as
for
*NL*
another
.
``
I
have
always
been
so
,
''
said
he
,
``
from
my
childhood
;
I
never
*NL*
had
much
mind
;
I
was
not
like
other
children
;
I
am
weak
in
the
head
.
It
*NL*
was
the
Lord
's
will
,
I
suppose
.
''
And
there
he
was
to
prove
the
truth
*NL*
of
his
words
.
He
was
a
metaphysical
puzzle
to
me
.
I
have
rarely
met
a
*NL*
fellowman
on
such
promising
ground
--
it
was
so
simple
and
sincere
and
so
*NL*
true
all
that
he
said
.
And
,
true
enough
,
in
proportion
as
he
appeared
*NL*
to
humble
himself
was
he
exalted
.
I
did
not
know
at
first
but
it
was
the
*NL*
result
of
a
wise
policy
.
It
seemed
that
from
such
a
basis
of
truth
and
*NL*
frankness
as
the
poor
weak-headed
pauper
had
laid
,
our
intercourse
might
*NL*
go
forward
to
something
better
than
the
intercourse
of
sages
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
some
guests
from
those
not
reckoned
commonly
among
the
town
's
*NL*
poor
,
but
who
should
be
;
who
are
among
the
world
's
poor
,
at
any
rate
;
*NL*
guests
who
appeal
,
not
to
your
hospitality
,
but
to
your
_
hospitalality
_
;
*NL*
who
earnestly
wish
to
be
helped
,
and
preface
their
appeal
with
the
*NL*
information
that
they
are
resolved
,
for
one
thing
,
never
to
help
*NL*
themselves
.
I
require
of
a
visitor
that
he
be
not
actually
starving
,
*NL*
though
he
may
have
the
very
best
appetite
in
the
world
,
however
he
got
*NL*
it
.
Objects
of
charity
are
not
guests
.
Men
who
did
not
know
when
their
*NL*
visit
had
terminated
,
though
I
went
about
my
business
again
,
answering
*NL*
them
from
greater
and
greater
remoteness
.
Men
of
almost
every
degree
of
*NL*
wit
called
on
me
in
the
migrating
season
.
Some
who
had
more
wits
than
*NL*
they
knew
what
to
do
with
;
runaway
slaves
with
plantation
manners
,
who
*NL*
listened
from
time
to
time
,
like
the
fox
in
the
fable
,
as
if
they
heard
*NL*
the
hounds
a-baying
on
their
track
,
and
looked
at
me
beseechingly
,
as
*NL*
much
as
to
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Christian
,
will
you
send
me
back
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
real
runaway
slave
,
among
the
rest
,
whom
I
helped
to
forward
toward
*NL*
the
north
star
.
Men
of
one
idea
,
like
a
hen
with
one
chicken
,
and
that
*NL*
a
duckling
;
men
of
a
thousand
ideas
,
and
unkempt
heads
,
like
those
hens
*NL*
which
are
made
to
take
charge
of
a
hundred
chickens
,
all
in
pursuit
*NL*
of
one
bug
,
a
score
of
them
lost
in
every
morning
's
dew
--
and
become
*NL*
frizzled
and
mangy
in
consequence
;
men
of
ideas
instead
of
legs
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
intellectual
centipede
that
made
you
crawl
all
over
.
One
man
proposed
*NL*
a
book
in
which
visitors
should
write
their
names
,
as
at
the
White
*NL*
Mountains
;
but
,
alas
!
I
have
too
good
a
memory
to
make
that
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
but
notice
some
of
the
peculiarities
of
my
visitors
.
Girls
*NL*
and
boys
and
young
women
generally
seemed
glad
to
be
in
the
woods
.
They
*NL*
looked
in
the
pond
and
at
the
flowers
,
and
improved
their
time
.
Men
of
*NL*
business
,
even
farmers
,
thought
only
of
solitude
and
employment
,
and
of
*NL*
the
great
distance
at
which
I
dwelt
from
something
or
other
;
and
though
*NL*
they
said
that
they
loved
a
ramble
in
the
woods
occasionally
,
it
was
*NL*
obvious
that
they
did
not
.
Restless
committed
men
,
whose
time
was
an
*NL*
taken
up
in
getting
a
living
or
keeping
it
;
ministers
who
spoke
of
God
*NL*
as
if
they
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
the
subject
,
who
could
not
bear
all
*NL*
kinds
of
opinions
;
doctors
,
lawyers
,
uneasy
housekeepers
who
pried
*NL*
into
my
cupboard
and
bed
when
I
was
out
--
how
came
Mrs.
--
to
know
that
my
*NL*
sheets
were
not
as
clean
as
hers
?
--
young
men
who
had
ceased
to
be
young
,
*NL*
and
had
concluded
that
it
was
safest
to
follow
the
beaten
track
of
the
*NL*
professions
--
all
these
generally
said
that
it
was
not
possible
to
do
so
*NL*
much
good
in
my
position
.
Ay
!
there
was
the
rub
.
The
old
and
infirm
and
*NL*
the
timid
,
of
whatever
age
or
sex
,
thought
most
of
sickness
,
and
sudden
*NL*
accident
and
death
;
to
them
life
seemed
full
of
danger
--
what
danger
is
*NL*
there
if
you
do
n't
think
of
any
?
--
and
they
thought
that
a
prudent
man
*NL*
would
carefully
select
the
safest
position
,
where
Dr.
B.
might
be
*NL*
on
hand
at
a
moment
's
warning
.
To
them
the
village
was
literally
a
*NL*
_
com-munity
_
,
a
league
for
mutual
defence
,
and
you
would
suppose
that
they
*NL*
would
not
go
a-huckleberrying
without
a
medicine
chest
.
The
amount
of
*NL*
it
is
,
if
a
man
is
alive
,
there
is
always
danger
that
he
may
die
,
*NL*
though
the
danger
must
be
allowed
to
be
less
in
proportion
as
he
is
*NL*
dead-and-alive
to
begin
with
.
A
man
sits
as
many
risks
as
he
runs
.
*NL*
Finally
,
there
were
the
self-styled
reformers
,
the
greatest
bores
of
*NL*
all
,
who
thought
that
I
was
forever
singing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
house
that
I
built
;
*NL*
This
is
the
man
that
lives
in
the
house
that
I
built
;
*NL*
*NL*
but
they
did
not
know
that
the
third
line
was
,
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
the
folks
that
worry
the
man
*NL*
That
lives
in
the
house
that
I
built
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
fear
the
hen-harriers
,
for
I
kept
no
chickens
;
but
I
feared
*NL*
the
men-harriers
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
more
cheering
visitors
than
the
last
.
Children
come
a-berrying
,
*NL*
railroad
men
taking
a
Sunday
morning
walk
in
clean
shirts
,
fishermen
and
*NL*
hunters
,
poets
and
philosophers
;
in
short
,
all
honest
pilgrims
,
who
came
*NL*
out
to
the
woods
for
freedom
's
sake
,
and
really
left
the
village
behind
,
*NL*
I
was
ready
to
greet
with
--
``
Welcome
,
Englishmen
!
welcome
,
Englishmen
!
''
*NL*
for
I
had
had
communication
with
that
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bean-Field
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
my
beans
,
the
length
of
whose
rows
,
added
together
,
was
seven
*NL*
miles
already
planted
,
were
impatient
to
be
hoed
,
for
the
earliest
had
*NL*
grown
considerably
before
the
latest
were
in
the
ground
;
indeed
they
*NL*
were
not
easily
to
be
put
off
.
What
was
the
meaning
of
this
so
steady
*NL*
and
self-respecting
,
this
small
Herculean
labor
,
I
knew
not
.
I
came
to
*NL*
love
my
rows
,
my
beans
,
though
so
many
more
than
I
wanted
.
They
attached
*NL*
me
to
the
earth
,
and
so
I
got
strength
like
Antaeus
.
But
why
should
I
*NL*
raise
them
?
Only
Heaven
knows
.
This
was
my
curious
labor
all
summer
--
to
*NL*
make
this
portion
of
the
earth
's
surface
,
which
had
yielded
only
*NL*
cinquefoil
,
blackberries
,
johnswort
,
and
the
like
,
before
,
sweet
wild
*NL*
fruits
and
pleasant
flowers
,
produce
instead
this
pulse
.
What
shall
I
*NL*
learn
of
beans
or
beans
of
me
?
I
cherish
them
,
I
hoe
them
,
early
and
*NL*
late
I
have
an
eye
to
them
;
and
this
is
my
day
's
work
.
It
is
a
fine
*NL*
broad
leaf
to
look
on
.
My
auxiliaries
are
the
dews
and
rains
which
water
*NL*
this
dry
soil
,
and
what
fertility
is
in
the
soil
itself
,
which
for
the
*NL*
most
part
is
lean
and
effete
.
My
enemies
are
worms
,
cool
days
,
and
most
*NL*
of
all
woodchucks
.
The
last
have
nibbled
for
me
a
quarter
of
an
acre
*NL*
clean
.
But
what
right
had
I
to
oust
johnswort
and
the
rest
,
and
break
*NL*
up
their
ancient
herb
garden
?
Soon
,
however
,
the
remaining
beans
will
be
*NL*
too
tough
for
them
,
and
go
forward
to
meet
new
foes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
four
years
old
,
as
I
well
remember
,
I
was
brought
from
Boston
*NL*
to
this
my
native
town
,
through
these
very
woods
and
this
field
,
to
*NL*
the
pond
.
It
is
one
of
the
oldest
scenes
stamped
on
my
memory
.
And
now
*NL*
to-night
my
flute
has
waked
the
echoes
over
that
very
water
.
The
pines
*NL*
still
stand
here
older
than
I
;
or
,
if
some
have
fallen
,
I
have
cooked
*NL*
my
supper
with
their
stumps
,
and
a
new
growth
is
rising
all
around
,
*NL*
preparing
another
aspect
for
new
infant
eyes
.
Almost
the
same
johnswort
*NL*
springs
from
the
same
perennial
root
in
this
pasture
,
and
even
I
have
at
*NL*
length
helped
to
clothe
that
fabulous
landscape
of
my
infant
dreams
,
and
*NL*
one
of
the
results
of
my
presence
and
influence
is
seen
in
these
bean
*NL*
leaves
,
corn
blades
,
and
potato
vines
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
planted
about
two
acres
and
a
half
of
upland
;
and
as
it
was
only
about
*NL*
fifteen
years
since
the
land
was
cleared
,
and
I
myself
had
got
out
*NL*
two
or
three
cords
of
stumps
,
I
did
not
give
it
any
manure
;
but
in
the
*NL*
course
of
the
summer
it
appeared
by
the
arrowheads
which
I
turned
up
in
*NL*
hoeing
,
that
an
extinct
nation
had
anciently
dwelt
here
and
planted
corn
*NL*
and
beans
ere
white
men
came
to
clear
the
land
,
and
so
,
to
some
extent
,
*NL*
had
exhausted
the
soil
for
this
very
crop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
yet
any
woodchuck
or
squirrel
had
run
across
the
road
,
or
the
*NL*
sun
had
got
above
the
shrub
oaks
,
while
all
the
dew
was
on
,
though
the
*NL*
farmers
warned
me
against
it
--
I
would
advise
you
to
do
all
your
work
*NL*
if
possible
while
the
dew
is
on
--
I
began
to
level
the
ranks
of
haughty
*NL*
weeds
in
my
bean-field
and
throw
dust
upon
their
heads
.
Early
in
the
*NL*
morning
I
worked
barefooted
,
dabbling
like
a
plastic
artist
in
the
dewy
*NL*
and
crumbling
sand
,
but
later
in
the
day
the
sun
blistered
my
feet
.
*NL*
There
the
sun
lighted
me
to
hoe
beans
,
pacing
slowly
backward
and
*NL*
forward
over
that
yellow
gravelly
upland
,
between
the
long
green
rows
,
*NL*
fifteen
rods
,
the
one
end
terminating
in
a
shrub
oak
copse
where
I
*NL*
could
rest
in
the
shade
,
the
other
in
a
blackberry
field
where
the
*NL*
green
berries
deepened
their
tints
by
the
time
I
had
made
another
*NL*
bout
.
Removing
the
weeds
,
putting
fresh
soil
about
the
bean
stems
,
and
*NL*
encouraging
this
weed
which
I
had
sown
,
making
the
yellow
soil
express
*NL*
its
summer
thought
in
bean
leaves
and
blossoms
rather
than
in
wormwood
*NL*
and
piper
and
millet
grass
,
making
the
earth
say
beans
instead
of
*NL*
grass
--
this
was
my
daily
work
.
As
I
had
little
aid
from
horses
or
*NL*
cattle
,
or
hired
men
or
boys
,
or
improved
implements
of
husbandry
,
I
was
*NL*
much
slower
,
and
became
much
more
intimate
with
my
beans
than
usual
.
*NL*
But
labor
of
the
hands
,
even
when
pursued
to
the
verge
of
drudgery
,
*NL*
is
perhaps
never
the
worst
form
of
idleness
.
It
has
a
constant
and
*NL*
imperishable
moral
,
and
to
the
scholar
it
yields
a
classic
result
.
A
*NL*
very
_
agricola
laboriosus
_
was
I
to
travellers
bound
westward
through
*NL*
Lincoln
and
Wayland
to
nobody
knows
where
;
they
sitting
at
their
ease
in
*NL*
gigs
,
with
elbows
on
knees
,
and
reins
loosely
hanging
in
festoons
;
I
the
*NL*
home-staying
,
laborious
native
of
the
soil
.
But
soon
my
homestead
was
*NL*
out
of
their
sight
and
thought
.
It
was
the
only
open
and
cultivated
*NL*
field
for
a
great
distance
on
either
side
of
the
road
,
so
they
made
the
*NL*
most
of
it
;
and
sometimes
the
man
in
the
field
heard
more
of
travellers
'
*NL*
gossip
and
comment
than
was
meant
for
his
ear
:
``
Beans
so
late
!
peas
*NL*
so
late
!
''
--
for
I
continued
to
plant
when
others
had
begun
to
hoe
--
the
*NL*
ministerial
husbandman
had
not
suspected
it
.
``
Corn
,
my
boy
,
for
fodder
;
*NL*
corn
for
fodder
.
''
``
Does
he
_
live
_
there
?
''
asks
the
black
bonnet
of
the
*NL*
gray
coat
;
and
the
hard-featured
farmer
reins
up
his
grateful
dobbin
to
*NL*
inquire
what
you
are
doing
where
he
sees
no
manure
in
the
furrow
,
and
*NL*
recommends
a
little
chip
dirt
,
or
any
little
waste
stuff
,
or
it
may
be
*NL*
ashes
or
plaster
.
But
here
were
two
acres
and
a
half
of
furrows
,
and
*NL*
only
a
hoe
for
cart
and
two
hands
to
draw
it
--
there
being
an
aversion
*NL*
to
other
carts
and
horses
--
and
chip
dirt
far
away
.
Fellow-travellers
as
*NL*
they
rattled
by
compared
it
aloud
with
the
fields
which
they
had
passed
,
*NL*
so
that
I
came
to
know
how
I
stood
in
the
agricultural
world
.
This
was
*NL*
one
field
not
in
Mr.
Coleman
's
report
.
And
,
by
the
way
,
who
estimates
*NL*
the
value
of
the
crop
which
nature
yields
in
the
still
wilder
fields
*NL*
unimproved
by
man
?
The
crop
of
_
English
_
hay
is
carefully
weighed
,
the
*NL*
moisture
calculated
,
the
silicates
and
the
potash
;
but
in
all
dells
and
*NL*
pond-holes
in
the
woods
and
pastures
and
swamps
grows
a
rich
and
various
*NL*
crop
only
unreaped
by
man
.
Mine
was
,
as
it
were
,
the
connecting
link
*NL*
between
wild
and
cultivated
fields
;
as
some
states
are
civilized
,
and
*NL*
others
half-civilized
,
and
others
savage
or
barbarous
,
so
my
field
was
,
*NL*
though
not
in
a
bad
sense
,
a
half-cultivated
field
.
They
were
*NL*
beans
cheerfully
returning
to
their
wild
and
primitive
state
that
I
*NL*
cultivated
,
and
my
hoe
played
the
_
Ranz
des
Vaches
_
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
at
hand
,
upon
the
topmost
spray
of
a
birch
,
sings
the
brown
*NL*
thrasher
--
or
red
mavis
,
as
some
love
to
call
him
--
all
the
morning
,
glad
*NL*
of
your
society
,
that
would
find
out
another
farmer
's
field
if
yours
*NL*
were
not
here
.
While
you
are
planting
the
seed
,
he
cries
--
``
Drop
it
,
drop
*NL*
it
--
cover
it
up
,
cover
it
up
--
pull
it
up
,
pull
it
up
,
pull
it
up
.
''
But
*NL*
this
was
not
corn
,
and
so
it
was
safe
from
such
enemies
as
he
.
You
may
*NL*
wonder
what
his
rigmarole
,
his
amateur
Paganini
performances
on
one
*NL*
string
or
on
twenty
,
have
to
do
with
your
planting
,
and
yet
prefer
it
to
*NL*
leached
ashes
or
plaster
.
It
was
a
cheap
sort
of
top
dressing
in
which
I
*NL*
had
entire
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
drew
a
still
fresher
soil
about
the
rows
with
my
hoe
,
I
disturbed
*NL*
the
ashes
of
unchronicled
nations
who
in
primeval
years
lived
under
*NL*
these
heavens
,
and
their
small
implements
of
war
and
hunting
were
*NL*
brought
to
the
light
of
this
modern
day
.
They
lay
mingled
with
other
*NL*
natural
stones
,
some
of
which
bore
the
marks
of
having
been
burned
by
*NL*
Indian
fires
,
and
some
by
the
sun
,
and
also
bits
of
pottery
and
glass
*NL*
brought
hither
by
the
recent
cultivators
of
the
soil
.
When
my
hoe
*NL*
tinkled
against
the
stones
,
that
music
echoed
to
the
woods
and
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
was
an
accompaniment
to
my
labor
which
yielded
an
instant
and
*NL*
immeasurable
crop
.
It
was
no
longer
beans
that
I
hoed
,
nor
I
that
hoed
*NL*
beans
;
and
I
remembered
with
as
much
pity
as
pride
,
if
I
remembered
at
*NL*
all
,
my
acquaintances
who
had
gone
to
the
city
to
attend
the
oratorios
.
*NL*
The
nighthawk
circled
overhead
in
the
sunny
afternoons
--
for
I
sometimes
*NL*
made
a
day
of
it
--
like
a
mote
in
the
eye
,
or
in
heaven
's
eye
,
falling
*NL*
from
time
to
time
with
a
swoop
and
a
sound
as
if
the
heavens
were
rent
,
*NL*
torn
at
last
to
very
rags
and
tatters
,
and
yet
a
seamless
cope
remained
;
*NL*
small
imps
that
fill
the
air
and
lay
their
eggs
on
the
ground
on
bare
*NL*
sand
or
rocks
on
the
tops
of
hills
,
where
few
have
found
them
;
graceful
*NL*
and
slender
like
ripples
caught
up
from
the
pond
,
as
leaves
are
raised
*NL*
by
the
wind
to
float
in
the
heavens
;
such
kindredship
is
in
nature
.
*NL*
The
hawk
is
aerial
brother
of
the
wave
which
he
sails
over
and
surveys
,
*NL*
those
his
perfect
air-inflated
wings
answering
to
the
elemental
*NL*
unfledged
pinions
of
the
sea
.
Or
sometimes
I
watched
a
pair
of
*NL*
hen-hawks
circling
high
in
the
sky
,
alternately
soaring
and
descending
,
*NL*
approaching
,
and
leaving
one
another
,
as
if
they
were
the
embodiment
of
*NL*
my
own
thoughts
.
Or
I
was
attracted
by
the
passage
of
wild
pigeons
from
*NL*
this
wood
to
that
,
with
a
slight
quivering
winnowing
sound
and
carrier
*NL*
haste
;
or
from
under
a
rotten
stump
my
hoe
turned
up
a
sluggish
*NL*
portentous
and
outlandish
spotted
salamander
,
a
trace
of
Egypt
and
*NL*
the
Nile
,
yet
our
contemporary
.
When
I
paused
to
lean
on
my
hoe
,
these
*NL*
sounds
and
sights
I
heard
and
saw
anywhere
in
the
row
,
a
part
of
the
*NL*
inexhaustible
entertainment
which
the
country
offers
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
gala
days
the
town
fires
its
great
guns
,
which
echo
like
popguns
to
*NL*
these
woods
,
and
some
waifs
of
martial
music
occasionally
penetrate
thus
*NL*
far
.
To
me
,
away
there
in
my
bean-field
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
*NL*
the
big
guns
sounded
as
if
a
puffball
had
burst
;
and
when
there
was
a
*NL*
military
turnout
of
which
I
was
ignorant
,
I
have
sometimes
had
a
vague
*NL*
sense
all
the
day
of
some
sort
of
itching
and
disease
in
the
horizon
,
*NL*
as
if
some
eruption
would
break
out
there
soon
,
either
scarlatina
or
*NL*
canker-rash
,
until
at
length
some
more
favorable
puff
of
wind
,
making
*NL*
haste
over
the
fields
and
up
the
Wayland
road
,
brought
me
information
of
*NL*
the
``
trainers
.
''
It
seemed
by
the
distant
hum
as
if
somebody
's
bees
had
*NL*
swarmed
,
and
that
the
neighbors
,
according
to
Virgil
's
advice
,
by
a
*NL*
faint
_
tintinnabulum
_
upon
the
most
sonorous
of
their
domestic
utensils
,
*NL*
were
endeavoring
to
call
them
down
into
the
hive
again
.
And
when
the
*NL*
sound
died
quite
away
,
and
the
hum
had
ceased
,
and
the
most
favorable
*NL*
breezes
told
no
tale
,
I
knew
that
they
had
got
the
last
drone
of
them
*NL*
all
safely
into
the
Middlesex
hive
,
and
that
now
their
minds
were
bent
*NL*
on
the
honey
with
which
it
was
smeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
proud
to
know
that
the
liberties
of
Massachusetts
and
of
our
*NL*
fatherland
were
in
such
safe
keeping
;
and
as
I
turned
to
my
hoeing
again
*NL*
I
was
filled
with
an
inexpressible
confidence
,
and
pursued
my
labor
*NL*
cheerfully
with
a
calm
trust
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
there
were
several
bands
of
musicians
,
it
sounded
as
if
all
the
*NL*
village
was
a
vast
bellows
and
all
the
buildings
expanded
and
collapsed
*NL*
alternately
with
a
din
.
But
sometimes
it
was
a
really
noble
and
*NL*
inspiring
strain
that
reached
these
woods
,
and
the
trumpet
that
sings
*NL*
of
fame
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
could
spit
a
Mexican
with
a
good
relish
--
for
*NL*
why
should
we
always
stand
for
trifles
?
--
and
looked
round
for
a
*NL*
woodchuck
or
a
skunk
to
exercise
my
chivalry
upon
.
These
martial
strains
*NL*
seemed
as
far
away
as
Palestine
,
and
reminded
me
of
a
march
of
crusaders
*NL*
in
the
horizon
,
with
a
slight
tantivy
and
tremulous
motion
of
the
elm
*NL*
tree
tops
which
overhang
the
village
.
This
was
one
of
the
_
great
_
days
;
*NL*
though
the
sky
had
from
my
clearing
only
the
same
everlastingly
great
*NL*
look
that
it
wears
daily
,
and
I
saw
no
difference
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
singular
experience
that
long
acquaintance
which
I
cultivated
*NL*
with
beans
,
what
with
planting
,
and
hoeing
,
and
harvesting
,
and
*NL*
threshing
,
and
picking
over
and
selling
them
--
the
last
was
the
hardest
*NL*
of
all
--
I
might
add
eating
,
for
I
did
taste
.
I
was
determined
to
know
*NL*
beans
.
When
they
were
growing
,
I
used
to
hoe
from
five
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
till
noon
,
and
commonly
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
about
other
*NL*
affairs
.
Consider
the
intimate
and
curious
acquaintance
one
makes
with
*NL*
various
kinds
of
weeds
--
it
will
bear
some
iteration
in
the
account
,
for
*NL*
there
was
no
little
iteration
in
the
labor
--
disturbing
their
delicate
*NL*
organizations
so
ruthlessly
,
and
making
such
invidious
distinctions
*NL*
with
his
hoe
,
levelling
whole
ranks
of
one
species
,
and
sedulously
*NL*
cultivating
another
.
That
's
Roman
wormwood
--
that
's
pigweed
--
that
's
*NL*
sorrel
--
that
's
piper-grass
--
have
at
him
,
chop
him
up
,
turn
his
roots
*NL*
upward
to
the
sun
,
do
n't
let
him
have
a
fibre
in
the
shade
,
if
you
do
*NL*
he
'll
turn
himself
t
'
other
side
up
and
be
as
green
as
a
leek
in
two
*NL*
days
.
A
long
war
,
not
with
cranes
,
but
with
weeds
,
those
Trojans
who
*NL*
had
sun
and
rain
and
dews
on
their
side
.
Daily
the
beans
saw
me
come
*NL*
to
their
rescue
armed
with
a
hoe
,
and
thin
the
ranks
of
their
enemies
,
*NL*
filling
up
the
trenches
with
weedy
dead
.
Many
a
lusty
crest
--
waving
*NL*
Hector
,
that
towered
a
whole
foot
above
his
crowding
comrades
,
fell
*NL*
before
my
weapon
and
rolled
in
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
summer
days
which
some
of
my
contemporaries
devoted
to
the
fine
*NL*
arts
in
Boston
or
Rome
,
and
others
to
contemplation
in
India
,
and
others
*NL*
to
trade
in
London
or
New
York
,
I
thus
,
with
the
other
farmers
of
New
*NL*
England
,
devoted
to
husbandry
.
Not
that
I
wanted
beans
to
eat
,
for
I
*NL*
am
by
nature
a
Pythagorean
,
so
far
as
beans
are
concerned
,
whether
they
*NL*
mean
porridge
or
voting
,
and
exchanged
them
for
rice
;
but
,
perchance
,
as
*NL*
some
must
work
in
fields
if
only
for
the
sake
of
tropes
and
expression
,
*NL*
to
serve
a
parable-maker
one
day
.
It
was
on
the
whole
a
rare
amusement
,
*NL*
which
,
continued
too
long
,
might
have
become
a
dissipation
.
Though
I
*NL*
gave
them
no
manure
,
and
did
not
hoe
them
all
once

hoed
them
unusually
*NL*
well
as
far
as
I
went
,
and
was
paid
for
it
in

end
,
``

as
Evelyn
says
,
``
no

or
laetation
whatsoever
comparable
*NL*

this
continual
motion
,
repastination

the

adds
elsewhere

``

*NL*
This
is
the
result
of
my
experience
in
raising
beans
:
Plant
the
common
*NL*
small
white
bush
bean
about
the
first
of
June
,
in
rows
three
feet
by
*NL*
eighteen
inches
apart
,
being
careful
to
select
fresh
round
and
unmixed
*NL*
seed
.
First
look
out
for
worms
,
and
supply
vacancies
by
planting
anew
.
*NL*
Then
look
out
for
woodchucks
,
if
it
is
an
exposed
place
,
for
they
will
*NL*
nibble
off
the
earliest
tender
leaves
almost
clean
as
they
go
;
and
*NL*
again
,
when
the
young
tendrils
make
their
appearance
,
they
have
notice
*NL*
of
it
,
and
will
shear
them
off
with
both
buds
and
young
pods
,
sitting
*NL*
erect
like
a
squirrel
.
But
above
all
harvest
as
early
as
possible
,
if
*NL*
you
would
escape
frosts
and
have
a
fair
and
salable
crop
;
you
may
save
*NL*
much
loss
by
this
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
further
experience
also
I
gained
:
I
said
to
myself
,
I
will
not
*NL*
plant
beans
and
corn
with
so
much
industry
another
summer
,
but
such
*NL*
seeds
,
if
the
seed
is
not
lost
,
as
sincerity
,
truth
,
simplicity
,
faith
,
*NL*
innocence
,
and
the
like
,
and
see
if
they
will
not
grow
in
this
soil
,
*NL*
even
with
less
toil
and
manurance
,
and
sustain
me
,
for
surely
it
has
*NL*
not
been
exhausted
for
these
crops
.
Alas
!
I
said
this
to
myself
;
but
now
*NL*
another
summer
is
gone
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
and
I
am
obliged
to
*NL*
say
to
you
,
Reader
,
that
the
seeds
which
I
planted
,
if
indeed
they
_
were
_
*NL*
the
seeds
of
those
virtues
,
were
wormeaten
or
had
lost
their
vitality
,
*NL*
and
so
did
not
come
up
.
Commonly
men
will
only
be
brave
as
their
fathers
*NL*
were
brave
,
or
timid
.
This
generation
is
very
sure
to
plant
corn
and
*NL*
beans
each
new
year
precisely
as
the
Indians
did
centuries
ago
and
*NL*
taught
the
first
settlers
to
do
,
as
if
there
were
a
fate
in
it
.
I
saw
an
*NL*
old
man
the
other
day
,
to
my
astonishment
,
making
the
holes
with
a
hoe
*NL*
for
the
seventieth
time
at
least
,
and
not
for
himself
to
lie
down
in
!
*NL*
But
why
should
not
the
New
Englander
try
new
adventures
,
and
not
lay
*NL*
so
much
stress
on
his
grain
,
his
potato
and
grass
crop
,
and
his
*NL*
orchards
--
raise
other
crops
than
these
?
Why
concern
ourselves
so
much
*NL*
about
our
beans
for
seed
,
and
not
be
concerned
at
all
about
a
new
*NL*
generation
of
men
?
We
should
really
be
fed
and
cheered
if
when
we
met
a
*NL*
man
we
were
sure
to
see
that
some
of
the
qualities
which
I
have
named
,
*NL*
which
we
all
prize
more
than
those
other
productions
,
but
which
are
*NL*
for
the
most
part
broadcast
and
floating
in
the
air
,
had
taken
root
*NL*
and
grown
in
him
.
Here
comes
such
a
subtile
and
ineffable
quality
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
as
truth
or
justice
,
though
the
slightest
amount
or
new
*NL*
variety
of
it
,
along
the
road
.
Our
ambassadors
should
be
instructed
to
*NL*
send
home
such
seeds
as
these
,
and
Congress
help
to
distribute
them
over
*NL*
all
the
land
.
We
should
never
stand
upon
ceremony
with
sincerity
.
We
*NL*
should
never
cheat
and
insult
and
banish
one
another
by
our
meanness
,
if
*NL*
there
were
present
the
kernel
of
worth
and
friendliness
.
We
should
not
*NL*
meet
thus
in
haste
.
Most
men
I
do
not
meet
at
all
,
for
they
seem
not
to
*NL*
have
time
;
they
are
busy
about
their
beans
.
We
would
not
deal
with
a
man
*NL*
thus
plodding
ever
,
leaning
on
a
hoe
or
a
spade
as
a
staff
between
his
*NL*
work
,
not
as
a
mushroom
,
but
partially
risen
out
of
the
earth
,
something
*NL*
more
than
erect
,
like
swallows
alighted
and
walking
on
the
ground
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
he
spake
,
his
wings
would
now
and
then
*NL*
Spread
,
as
he
meant
to
fly
,
then
close
again
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
so
that
we
should
suspect
that
we
might
be
conversing
with
an
angel
.
*NL*
Bread
may
not
always
nourish
us
;
but
it
always
does
us
good
,
it
even
*NL*
takes
stiffness
out
of
our
joints
,
and
makes
us
supple
and
buoyant
,
when
*NL*
we
knew
not
what
ailed
us
,
to
recognize
any
generosity
in
man
or
Nature
,
*NL*
to
share
any
unmixed
and
heroic
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ancient
poetry
and
mythology
suggest
,
at
least
,
that
husbandry
was
once
*NL*
a
sacred
art
;
but
it
is
pursued
with
irreverent
haste
and
heedlessness
*NL*
by
us
,
our
object
being
to
have
large
farms
and
large
crops
merely
.
*NL*
We
have
no
festival
,
nor
procession
,
nor
ceremony
,
not
excepting
our
*NL*
cattle-shows
and
so-called
Thanksgivings
,
by
which
the
farmer
expresses
*NL*
a
sense
of
the
sacredness
of
his
calling
,
or
is
reminded
of
its
sacred
*NL*
origin
.
It
is
the
premium
and
the
feast
which
tempt
him
.
He
sacrifices
*NL*
not
to
Ceres
and
the
Terrestrial
Jove
,
but
to
the
infernal
Plutus
*NL*
rather
.
By
avarice
and
selfishness
,
and
a
grovelling
habit
,
from
which
*NL*
none
of
us
is
free
,
of
regarding
the
soil
as
property
,
or
the
means
*NL*
of
acquiring
property
chiefly
,
the
landscape
is
deformed
,
husbandry
is
*NL*
degraded
with
us
,
and
the
farmer
leads
the
meanest
of
lives
.
He
knows
*NL*
Nature
but
as
a
robber
.
Cato
says
that
the
profits
of
agriculture
are
*NL*
particularly
pious
or
just
-LRB-
_
maximeque
pius
quaestus
_
-RRB-
,
and
according
*NL*
to
Varro
the
old
Romans
``
called
the
same
earth
Mother
and
Ceres
,
and
*NL*
thought
that
they
who
cultivated
it
led
a
pious
and
useful
life
,
and
*NL*
that
they
alone
were
left
of
the
race
of
King
Saturn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
wont
to
forget
that
the
sun
looks
on
our
cultivated
fields
and
*NL*
on
the
prairies
and
forests
without
distinction
.
They
all
reflect
and
*NL*
absorb
his
rays
alike
,
and
the
former
make
but
a
small
part
of
the
*NL*
glorious
picture
which
he
beholds
in
his
daily
course
.
In
his
view
*NL*
the
earth
is
all
equally
cultivated
like
a
garden
.
Therefore
we
should
*NL*
receive
the
benefit
of
his
light
and
heat
with
a
corresponding
trust
and
*NL*
magnanimity
.
What
though
I
value
the
seed
of
these
beans
,
and
harvest
*NL*
that
in
the
fall
of
the
year
?
This
broad
field
which
I
have
looked
at
*NL*
so
long
looks
not
to
me
as
the
principal
cultivator
,
but
away
from
me
to
*NL*
influences
more
genial
to
it
,
which
water
and
make
it
green
.
These
*NL*
beans
have
results
which
are
not
harvested
by
me
.
Do
they
not
grow
for
*NL*
woodchucks
partly
?
The
ear
of
wheat
-LRB-
in
Latin
_
spica
_
,
obsoletely
_
speca

,
*NL*
from
_
spe
_
,
hope
-RRB-
should
not
be
the
only
hope
of
the
husbandman
;
its
*NL*
kernel
or
grain
-LRB-
_
granum
_
from
_
gerendo
_
,
bearing
-RRB-
is
not
all
that
it
*NL*
bears
.
How
,
then
,
can
our
harvest
fail
?
Shall
I
not
rejoice
also
at
*NL*
the
abundance
of
the
weeds
whose
seeds
are
the
granary
of
the
birds
?
It
*NL*
matters
little
comparatively
whether
the
fields
fill
the
farmer
's
barns
.
*NL*
The
true
husbandman
will
cease
from
anxiety
,
as
the
squirrels
manifest
*NL*
no
concern
whether
the
woods
will
bear
chestnuts
this
year
or
not
,
and
*NL*
finish
his
labor
with
every
day
,
relinquishing
all
claim
to
the
produce
*NL*
of
his
fields
,
and
sacrificing
in
his
mind
not
only
his
first
but
his
*NL*
last
fruits
also
.

The
Village
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
hoeing
,
or
perhaps
reading
and
writing
,
in
the
forenoon
,
I
usually
*NL*
bathed
again
in
the
pond
,
swimming
across
one
of
its
coves
for
a
stint
,
*NL*
and
washed
the
dust
of
labor
from
my
person
,
or
smoothed
out
the
last
*NL*
wrinkle
which
study
had
made
,
and
for
the
afternoon
was
absolutely
free
.
*NL*
Every
day
or
two
I
strolled
to
the
village
to
hear
some
of
the
gossip
*NL*
which
is
incessantly
going
on
there
,
circulating
either
from
mouth
to
*NL*
mouth
,
or
from
newspaper
to
newspaper
,
and
which
,
taken
in
homoeopathic
*NL*
doses
,
was
really
as
refreshing
in
its
way
as
the
rustle
of
leaves
and
*NL*
the
peeping
of
frogs
.
As
I
walked
in
the
woods
to
see
the
birds
and
*NL*
squirrels
,
so
I
walked
in
the
village
to
see
the
men
and
boys
;
instead
*NL*
of
the
wind
among
the
pines
I
heard
the
carts
rattle
.
In
one
direction
*NL*
from
my
house
there
was
a
colony
of
muskrats
in
the
river
meadows
;
under
*NL*
the
grove
of
elms
and
buttonwoods
in
the
other
horizon
was
a
village
*NL*
of
busy
men
,
as
curious
to
me
as
if
they
had
been
prairie-dogs
,
each
*NL*
sitting
at
the
mouth
of
its
burrow
,
or
running
over
to
a
neighbor
's
to
*NL*
gossip
.
I
went
there
frequently
to
observe
their
habits
.
The
village
*NL*
appeared
to
me
a
great
news
room
;
and
on
one
side
,
to
support
it
,
as
*NL*
once
at
Redding
&
Company
's
on
State
Street
,
they
kept
nuts
and
raisins
,
*NL*
or
salt
and
meal
and
other
groceries
.
Some
have
such
a
vast
appetite
*NL*
for
the
former
commodity
,
that
is
,
the
news
,
and
such
sound
digestive
*NL*
organs
,
that
they
can
sit
forever
in
public
avenues
without
stirring
,
*NL*
and
let
it
simmer
and
whisper
through
them
like
the
Etesian
winds
,
or
*NL*
as
if
inhaling
ether
,
it
only
producing
numbness
and
insensibility
to
*NL*
pain
--
otherwise
it
would
often
be
painful
to
bear
--
without
affecting
the
*NL*
consciousness
.
I
hardly
ever
failed
,
when
I
rambled
through
the
village
,
*NL*
to
see
a
row
of
such
worthies
,
either
sitting
on
a
ladder
sunning
*NL*
themselves
,
with
their
bodies
inclined
forward
and
their
eyes
glancing
*NL*
along
the
line
this
way
and
that
,
from
time
to
time
,
with
a
voluptuous
*NL*
expression
,
or
else
leaning
against
a
barn
with
their
hands
in
their
*NL*
pockets
,
like
caryatides
,
as
if
to
prop
it
up
.
They
,
being
commonly
out
*NL*
of
doors
,
heard
whatever
was
in
the
wind
.
These
are
the
coarsest
mills
,
*NL*
in
which
all
gossip
is
first
rudely
digested
or
cracked
up
before
it
is
*NL*
emptied
into
finer
and
more
delicate
hoppers
within
doors
.
I
observed
*NL*
that
the
vitals
of
the
village
were
the
grocery
,
the
bar-room
,
the
*NL*
post-office
,
and
the
bank
;
and
,
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
machinery
,
*NL*
they
kept
a
bell
,
a
big
gun
,
and
a
fire-engine
,
at
convenient
places
;
*NL*
and
the
houses
were
so
arranged
as
to
make
the
most
of
mankind
,
in
*NL*
lanes
and
fronting
one
another
,
so
that
every
traveller
had
to
run
the
*NL*
gauntlet
,
and
every
man
,
woman
,
and
child
might
get
a
lick
at
him
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
those
who
were
stationed
nearest
to
the
head
of
the
line
,
where
*NL*
they
could
most
see
and
be
seen
,
and
have
the
first
blow
at
him
,
paid
*NL*
the
highest
prices
for
their
places
;
and
the
few
straggling
inhabitants
*NL*
in
the
outskirts
,
where
long
gaps
in
the
line
began
to
occur
,
and
the
*NL*
traveller
could
get
over
walls
or
turn
aside
into
cow-paths
,
and
so
*NL*
escape
,
paid
a
very
slight
ground
or
window
tax
.
Signs
were
hung
out
*NL*
on
all
sides
to
allure
him
;
some
to
catch
him
by
the
appetite
,
as
the
*NL*
tavern
and
victualling
cellar
;
some
by
the
fancy
,
as
the
dry
goods
store
*NL*
and
the
jeweller
's
;
and
others
by
the
hair
or
the
feet
or
the
skirts
,
*NL*
as
the
barber
,
the
shoemaker
,
or
the
tailor
.
Besides
,
there
was
a
still
*NL*
more
terrible
standing
invitation
to
call
at
every
one
of
these
houses
,
*NL*
and
company
expected
about
these
times
.
For
the
most
part
I
escaped
*NL*
wonderfully
from
these
dangers
,
either
by
proceeding
at
once
boldly
and
*NL*
without
deliberation
to
the
goal
,
as
is
recommended
to
those
who
run
the
*NL*
gauntlet
,
or
by
keeping
my
thoughts
on
high
things
,
like
Orpheus
,
who
,
*NL*
``
loudly
singing
the
praises
of
the
gods
to
his
lyre
,
drowned
the
voices
*NL*
of
the
Sirens
,
and
kept
out
of
danger
.
''
Sometimes
I
bolted
suddenly
,
*NL*
and
nobody
could
tell
my
whereabouts
,
for
I
did
not
stand
much
about
*NL*
gracefulness
,
and
never
hesitated
at
a
gap
in
a
fence
.
I
was
even
*NL*
accustomed
to
make
an
irruption
into
some
houses
,
where
I
was
well
*NL*
entertained
,
and
after
learning
the
kernels
and
very
last
sieveful
of
*NL*
news
--
what
had
subsided
,
the
prospects
of
war
and
peace
,
and
whether
the
*NL*
world
was
likely
to
hold
together
much
longer
--
I
was
let
out
through
the
*NL*
rear
avenues
,
and
so
escaped
to
the
woods
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
pleasant
,
when
I
stayed
late
in
town
,
to
launch
myself
into
*NL*
the
night
,
especially
if
it
was
dark
and
tempestuous
,
and
set
sail
from
*NL*
some
bright
village
parlor
or
lecture
room
,
with
a
bag
of
rye
or
Indian
*NL*
meal
upon
my
shoulder
,
for
my
snug
harbor
in
the
woods
,
having
made
all
*NL*
tight
without
and
withdrawn
under
hatches
with
a
merry
crew
of
thoughts
,
*NL*
leaving
only
my
outer
man
at
the
helm
,
or
even
tying
up
the
helm
when
it
*NL*
was
plain
sailing
.
I
had
many
a
genial
thought
by
the
cabin
fire
``
as
I
*NL*
sailed
.
''
I
was
never
cast
away
nor
distressed
in
any
weather
,
though
*NL*
I
encountered
some
severe
storms
.
It
is
darker
in
the
woods
,
even
in
*NL*
common
nights
,
than
most
suppose
.
I
frequently
had
to
look
up
at
the
*NL*
opening
between
the
trees
above
the
path
in
order
to
learn
my
route
,
*NL*
and
,
where
there
was
no
cart-path
,
to
feel
with
my
feet
the
faint
track
*NL*
which
I
had
worn
,
or
steer
by
the
known
relation
of
particular
trees
*NL*
which
I
felt
with
my
hands
,
passing
between
two
pines
for
instance
,
not
*NL*
more
than
eighteen
inches
apart
,
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
,
invariably
,
*NL*
in
the
darkest
night
.
Sometimes
,
after
coming
home
thus
late
in
a
dark
*NL*
and
muggy
night
,
when
my
feet
felt
the
path
which
my
eyes
could
not
see
,
*NL*
dreaming
and
absent-minded
all
the
way
,
until
I
was
aroused
by
having
to
*NL*
raise
my
hand
to
lift
the
latch
,
I
have
not
been
able
to
recall
a
single
*NL*
step
of
my
walk
,
and
I
have
thought
that
perhaps
my
body
would
find
its
*NL*
way
home
if
its
master
should
forsake
it
,
as
the
hand
finds
its
way
to
*NL*
the
mouth
without
assistance
.
Several
times
,
when
a
visitor
chanced
to
*NL*
stay
into
evening
,
and
it
proved
a
dark
night
,
I
was
obliged
to
conduct
*NL*
him
to
the
cart-path
in
the
rear
of
the
house
,
and
then
point
out
to
him
*NL*
the
direction
he
was
to
pursue
,
and
in
keeping
which
he
was
to
be
guided
*NL*
rather
by
his
feet
than
his
eyes
.
One
very
dark
night
I
directed
thus
*NL*
on
their
way
two
young
men
who
had
been
fishing
in
the
pond
.
They
lived
*NL*
about
a
mile
off
through
the
woods
,
and
were
quite
used
to
the
route
.
*NL*
A
day
or
two
after
one
of
them
told
me
that
they
wandered
about
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
night
,
close
by
their
own
premises
,
and
did
not
get
*NL*
home
till
toward
morning
,
by
which
time
,
as
there
had
been
several
*NL*
heavy
showers
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
the
leaves
were
very
wet
,
they
were
*NL*
drenched
to
their
skins
.
I
have
heard
of
many
going
astray
even
in
the
*NL*
village
streets
,
when
the
darkness
was
so
thick
that
you
could
cut
it
*NL*
with
a
knife
,
as
the
saying
is
.
Some
who
live
in
the
outskirts
,
having
*NL*
come
to
town
a-shopping
in
their
wagons
,
have
been
obliged
to
put
up
for
*NL*
the
night
;
and
gentlemen
and
ladies
making
a
call
have
gone
half
a
mile
*NL*
out
of
their
way
,
feeling
the
sidewalk
only
with
their
feet
,
and
not
*NL*
knowing
when
they
turned
.
It
is
a
surprising
and
memorable
,
as
well
*NL*
as
valuable
experience
,
to
be
lost
in
the
woods
any
time
.
Often
in
a
*NL*
snow-storm
,
even
by
day
,
one
will
come
out
upon
a
well-known
road
and
*NL*
yet
find
it
impossible
to
tell
which
way
leads
to
the
village
.
Though
he
*NL*
knows
that
he
has
travelled
it
a
thousand
times
,
he
can
not
recognize
*NL*
a
feature
in
it
,
but
it
is
as
strange
to
him
as
if
it
were
a
road
in
*NL*
Siberia
.
By
night
,
of
course
,
the
perplexity
is
infinitely
greater
.
*NL*
In
our
most
trivial
walks
,
we
are
constantly
,
though
unconsciously
,
*NL*
steering
like
pilots
by
certain
well-known
beacons
and
headlands
,
and
if
*NL*
we
go
beyond
our
usual
course
we
still
carry
in
our
minds
the
bearing
*NL*
of
some
neighboring
cape
;
and
not
till
we
are
completely
lost
,
or
turned
*NL*
round
--
for
a
man
needs
only
to
be
turned
round
once
with
his
eyes
shut
*NL*
in
this
world
to
be
lost
--
do
we
appreciate
the
vastness
and
strangeness
*NL*
of
nature
.
Every
man
has
to
learn
the
points
of
compass
again
as
often
*NL*
as
he
awakes
,
whether
from
sleep
or
any
abstraction
.
Not
till
we
are
*NL*
lost
,
in
other
words
not
till
we
have
lost
the
world
,
do
we
begin
to
*NL*
find
ourselves
,
and
realize
where
we
are
and
the
infinite
extent
of
our
*NL*
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
near
the
end
of
the
first
summer
,
when
I
went
to
the
*NL*
village
to
get
a
shoe
from
the
cobbler
's
,
I
was
seized
and
put
into
*NL*
jail
,
because
,
as
I
have
elsewhere
related
,
I
did
not
pay
a
tax
to
,
or
*NL*
recognize
the
authority
of
,
the
State
which
buys
and
sells
men
,
women
,
*NL*
and
children
,
like
cattle
,
at
the
door
of
its
senate-house
.
I
had
gone
*NL*
down
to
the
woods
for
other
purposes
.
But
,
wherever
a
man
goes
,
men
*NL*
will
pursue
and
paw
him
with
their
dirty
institutions
,
and
,
if
they
can
,
*NL*
constrain
him
to
belong
to
their
desperate
odd-fellow
society
.
It
is
*NL*
true
,
I
might
have
resisted
forcibly
with
more
or
less
effect
,
might
*NL*
have
run
``
amok
''
against
society
;
but
I
preferred
that
society
should
run
*NL*
``
amok
''
against
me
,
it
being
the
desperate
party
.
However
,
I
was
released
*NL*
the
next
day
,
obtained
my
mended
shoe
,
and
returned
to
the
woods
in
*NL*
season
to
get
my
dinner
of
huckleberries
on
Fair
Haven
Hill
.
I
was
never
*NL*
molested
by
any
person
but
those
who
represented
the
State
.
I
had
no
*NL*
lock
nor
bolt
but
for
the
desk
which
held
my
papers
,
not
even
a
nail
*NL*
to
put
over
my
latch
or
windows
.
I
never
fastened
my
door
night
or
day
,
*NL*
though
I
was
to
be
absent
several
days
;
not
even
when
the
next
fall
*NL*
I
spent
a
fortnight
in
the
woods
of
Maine
.
And
yet
my
house
was
more
*NL*
respected
than
if
it
had
been
surrounded
by
a
file
of
soldiers
.
The
*NL*
tired
rambler
could
rest
and
warm
himself
by
my
fire
,
the
literary
amuse
*NL*
himself
with
the
few
books
on
my
table
,
or
the
curious
,
by
opening
my
*NL*
closet
door
,
see
what
was
left
of
my
dinner
,
and
what
prospect
I
had
of
*NL*
a
supper
.
Yet
,
though
many
people
of
every
class
came
this
way
to
the
*NL*
pond
,
I
suffered
no
serious
inconvenience
from
these
sources
,
and
I
*NL*
never
missed
anything
but
one
small
book
,
a
volume
of
Homer
,
which
*NL*
perhaps
was
improperly
gilded
,
and
this
I
trust
a
soldier
of
our
camp
*NL*
has
found
by
this
time
.
I
am
convinced
,
that
if
all
men
were
to
live
as
*NL*
simply
as
I
then
did
,
thieving
and
robbery
would
be
unknown
.
These
take
*NL*
place
only
in
communities
where
some
have
got
more
than
is
sufficient
*NL*
while
others
have
not
enough
.
The
Pope
's
Homers
would
soon
get
properly
*NL*
distributed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nec
bella
fuerunt
,
*NL*
Faginus
astabat

*NL*
``
Nor
wars
did
men
molest
,
*NL*
When
only
beechen
bowls
were
in
request

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
who
govern
public
affairs
,
what
need
have
you

Love
virtue
,
and
the

will
be
virtuous
.
The
virtues
*NL*
of
a
superior
man
are
like
the
wind
;
the
virtues
of
a
common
man
are
*NL*
like

when
the
wind
passes
over
it
,
bends

The
Ponds

*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
having
had
a
surfeit
of
human
society
and
gossip
,
and
worn
*NL*
out
all
my
village
friends
,
I
rambled
still
farther
westward
than
I
*NL*
habitually
dwell
,
into
yet
more
unfrequented
parts
of
the
town
,
``
to
*NL*
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
,
''
or
,
while
the
sun
was
setting
,
made
my
*NL*
supper
of
huckleberries
and
blueberries
on
Fair
Haven
Hill
,
and
laid
up
*NL*
a
store
for
several
days
.
The
fruits
do
not
yield
their
true
flavor
to
*NL*
the
purchaser
of
them
,
nor
to
him
who
raises
them
for
the
market
.
There
*NL*
is
but
one
way
to
obtain
it
,
yet
few
take
that
way
.
If
you
would
know
*NL*
the
flavor
of
huckleberries
,
ask
the
cowboy
or
the
partridge
.
It
is
a
*NL*
vulgar
error
to
suppose
that
you
have
tasted
huckleberries
who
never
*NL*
plucked
them
.
A
huckleberry
never
reaches
Boston
;
they
have
not
been
*NL*
known
there
since
they
grew
on
her
three
hills
.
The
ambrosial
and
*NL*
essential
part
of
the
fruit
is
lost
with
the
bloom
which
is
rubbed
off
*NL*
in
the
market
cart
,
and
they
become
mere
provender
.
As
long
as
Eternal
*NL*
Justice
reigns
,
not
one
innocent
huckleberry
can
be
transported
thither
*NL*
from
the
country
's
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
after
my
hoeing
was
done
for
the
day
,
I
joined
some
*NL*
impatient
companion
who
had
been
fishing
on
the
pond
since
morning
,
*NL*
as
silent
and
motionless
as
a
duck
or
a
floating
leaf
,
and
,
after
*NL*
practising
various
kinds
of
philosophy
,
had
concluded
commonly
,
by
the
*NL*
time
I
arrived
,
that
he
belonged
to
the
ancient
sect
of
CA
|
nobites
.
*NL*
There
was
one
older
man
,
an
excellent
fisher
and
skilled
in
all
kinds
of
*NL*
woodcraft
,
who
was
pleased
to
look
upon
my
house
as
a
building
erected
*NL*
for
the
convenience
of
fishermen
;
and
I
was
equally
pleased
when
he
sat
*NL*
in
my
doorway
to
arrange
his
lines
.
Once
in
a
while
we
sat
together
on
*NL*
the
pond
,
he
at
one
end
of
the
boat
,
and
I
at
the
other
;
but
not
many
*NL*
words
passed
between
us
,
for
he
had
grown
deaf
in
his
later
years
,
but
*NL*
he
occasionally
hummed
a
psalm
,
which
harmonized
well
enough
with
my
*NL*
philosophy
.
Our
intercourse
was
thus
altogether
one
of
unbroken
harmony
,
*NL*
far
more
pleasing
to
remember
than
if
it
had
been
carried
on
by
speech
.
*NL*
When
,
as
was
commonly
the
case
,
I
had
none
to
commune
with
,
I
used
*NL*
to
raise
the
echoes
by
striking
with
a
paddle
on
the
side
of
my
boat
,
*NL*
filling
the
surrounding
woods
with
circling
and
dilating
sound
,
stirring
*NL*
them
up
as
the
keeper
of
a
menagerie
his
wild
beasts
,
until
I
elicited
a
*NL*
growl
from
every
wooded
vale
and
hillside
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
warm
evenings
I
frequently
sat
in
the
boat
playing
the
flute
,
and
*NL*
saw
the
perch
,
which
I
seem
to
have
charmed
,
hovering
around
me
,
and
*NL*
the
moon
travelling
over
the
ribbed
bottom
,
which
was
strewed
with
the
*NL*
wrecks
of
the
forest
.
Formerly
I
had
come
to
this
pond
adventurously
,
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
in
dark
summer
nights
,
with
a
companion
,
and
,
making
*NL*
a
fire
close
to
the
water
's
edge
,
which
we
thought
attracted
the
fishes
,
*NL*
we
caught
pouts
with
a
bunch
of
worms
strung
on
a
thread
,
and
when
we
*NL*
had
done
,
far
in
the
night
,
threw
the
burning
brands
high
into
the
air
*NL*
like
skyrockets
,
which
,
coming
down
into
the
pond
,
were
quenched
with
*NL*
a
loud
hissing
,
and
we
were
suddenly
groping
in
total
darkness
.
Through
*NL*
this
,
whistling
a
tune
,
we
took
our
way
to
the
haunts
of
men
again
.
But
*NL*
now
I
had
made
my
home
by
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
after
staying
in
a
village
parlor
till
the
family
had
all
*NL*
retired
,
I
have
returned
to
the
woods
,
and
,
partly
with
a
view
to
the
*NL*
next
day
's
dinner
,
spent
the
hours
of
midnight
fishing
from
a
boat
by
*NL*
moonlight
,
serenaded
by
owls
and
foxes
,
and
hearing
,
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
the
creaking
note
of
some
unknown
bird
close
at
hand
.
These
experiences
*NL*
were
very
memorable
and
valuable
to
me
--
anchored
in
forty
feet
of
*NL*
water
,
and
twenty
or
thirty
rods
from
the
shore
,
surrounded
sometimes
*NL*
by
thousands
of
small
perch
and
shiners
,
dimpling
the
surface
with
their
*NL*
tails
in
the
moonlight
,
and
communicating
by
a
long
flaxen
line
with
*NL*
mysterious
nocturnal
fishes
which
had
their
dwelling
forty
feet
below
,
*NL*
or
sometimes
dragging
sixty
feet
of
line
about
the
pond
as
I
drifted
in
*NL*
the
gentle
night
breeze
,
now
and
then
feeling
a
slight
vibration
along
*NL*
it
,
indicative
of
some
life
prowling
about
its
extremity
,
of
dull
*NL*
uncertain
blundering
purpose
there
,
and
slow
to
make
up
its
mind
.
*NL*
At
length
you
slowly
raise
,
pulling
hand
over
hand
,
some
horned
pout
*NL*
squeaking
and
squirming
to
the
upper
air
.
It
was
very
queer
,
especially
*NL*
in
dark
nights
,
when
your
thoughts
had
wandered
to
vast
and
cosmogonal
*NL*
themes
in
other
spheres
,
to
feel
this
faint
jerk
,
which
came
to
*NL*
interrupt
your
dreams
and
link
you
to
Nature
again
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
*NL*
might
next
cast
my
line
upward
into
the
air
,
as
well
as
downward
into
*NL*
this
element
,
which
was
scarcely
more
dense
.
Thus
I
caught
two
fishes
as
*NL*
it
were
with
one
hook
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
scenery
of
Walden
is
on
a
humble
scale
,
and
,
though
very
beautiful
,
*NL*
does
not
approach
to
grandeur
,
nor
can
it
much
concern
one
who
has
not
*NL*
long
frequented
it
or
lived
by
its
shore
;
yet
this
pond
is
so
remarkable
*NL*
for
its
depth
and
purity
as
to
merit
a
particular
description
.
It
is
*NL*
a
clear
and
deep
green
well
,
half
a
mile
long
and
a
mile
and
three
*NL*
quarters
in
circumference
,
and
contains
about
sixty-one
and
a
half
*NL*
acres
;
a
perennial
spring
in
the
midst
of
pine
and
oak
woods
,
without
*NL*
any
visible
inlet
or
outlet
except
by
the
clouds
and
evaporation
.
The
*NL*
surrounding
hills
rise
abruptly
from
the
water
to
the
height
of
forty
to
*NL*
eighty
feet
,
though
on
the
southeast
and
east
they
attain
to
about
one
*NL*
hundred
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
respectively
,
within
a
quarter
*NL*
and
a
third
of
a
mile
.
They
are
exclusively
woodland
.
All
our
Concord
*NL*
waters
have
two
colors
at
least
;
one
when
viewed
at
a
distance
,
and
*NL*
another
,
more
proper
,
close
at
hand
.
The
first
depends
more
on
the
*NL*
light
,
and
follows
the
sky
.
In
clear
weather
,
in
summer
,
they
appear
*NL*
blue
at
a
little
distance
,
especially
if
agitated
,
and
at
a
great
*NL*
distance
all
appear
alike
.
In
stormy
weather
they
are
sometimes
of
a
*NL*
dark
slate-color
.
The
sea
,
however
,
is
said
to
be
blue
one
day
and
green
*NL*
another
without
any
perceptible
change
in
the
atmosphere
.
I
have
seen
*NL*
our
river
,
when
,
the
landscape
being
covered
with
snow
,
both
water
and
*NL*
ice
were
almost
as
green
as
grass
.
Some
consider
blue
``
to
be
the
color
*NL*
of
pure
water
,
whether
liquid
or
solid
.
''
But
,
looking
directly
down
into
*NL*
our
waters
from
a
boat
,
they
are
seen
to
be
of
very
different
colors
.
*NL*
Walden
is
blue
at
one
time
and
green
at
another
,
even
from
the
same
*NL*
point
of
view
.
Lying
between
the
earth
and
the
heavens
,
it
partakes
of
*NL*
the
color
of
both
.
Viewed
from
a
hilltop
it
reflects
the
color
of
the
*NL*
sky
;
but
near
at
hand
it
is
of
a
yellowish
tint
next
the
shore
where
*NL*
you
can
see
the
sand
,
then
a
light
green
,
which
gradually
deepens
to
a
*NL*
uniform
dark
green
in
the
body
of
the
pond
.
In
some
lights
,
viewed
*NL*
even
from
a
hilltop
,
it
is
of
a
vivid
green
next
the
shore
.
Some
have
*NL*
referred
this
to
the
reflection
of
the
verdure
;
but
it
is
equally
green
*NL*
there
against
the
railroad
sandbank
,
and
in
the
spring
,
before
the
*NL*
leaves
are
expanded
,
and
it
may
be
simply
the
result
of
the
prevailing
*NL*
blue
mixed
with
the
yellow
of
the
sand
.
Such
is
the
color
of
its
iris
.
*NL*
This
is
that
portion
,
also
,
where
in
the
spring
,
the
ice
being
warmed
*NL*
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
reflected
from
the
bottom
,
and
also
transmitted
*NL*
through
the
earth
,
melts
first
and
forms
a
narrow
canal
about
the
still
*NL*
frozen
middle
.
Like
the
rest
of
our
waters
,
when
much
agitated
,
in
clear
*NL*
weather
,
so
that
the
surface
of
the
waves
may
reflect
the
sky
at
the
*NL*
right
angle
,
or
because
there
is
more
light
mixed
with
it
,
it
appears
*NL*
at
a
little
distance
of
a
darker
blue
than
the
sky
itself
;
and
at
such
*NL*
a
time
,
being
on
its
surface
,
and
looking
with
divided
vision
,
so
as
to
*NL*
see
the
reflection
,
I
have
discerned
a
matchless
and
indescribable
light
*NL*
blue
,
such
as
watered
or
changeable
silks
and
sword
blades
suggest
,
more
*NL*
cerulean
than
the
sky
itself
,
alternating
with
the
original
dark
green
*NL*
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
waves
,
which
last
appeared
but
muddy
in
*NL*
comparison
.
It
is
a
vitreous
greenish
blue
,
as
I
remember
it
,
like
those
*NL*
patches
of
the
winter
sky
seen
through
cloud
vistas
in
the
west
before
*NL*
sundown
.
Yet
a
single
glass
of
its
water
held
up
to
the
light
is
as
*NL*
colorless
as
an
equal
quantity
of
air
.
It
is
well
known
that
a
large
*NL*
plate
of
glass
will
have
a
green
tint
,
owing
,
as
the
makers
say
,
to
its
*NL*
``
body
,
''
but
a
small
piece
of
the
same
will
be
colorless
.
How
large
a
*NL*
body
of
Walden
water
would
be
required
to
reflect
a
green
tint
I
have
*NL*
never
proved
.
The
water
of
our
river
is
black
or
a
very
dark
brown
to
*NL*
one
looking
directly
down
on
it
,
and
,
like
that
of
most
ponds
,
imparts
*NL*
to
the
body
of
one
bathing
in
it
a
yellowish
tinge
;
but
this
water
is
*NL*
of
such
crystalline
purity
that
the
body
of
the
bather
appears
of
an
*NL*
alabaster
whiteness
,
still
more
unnatural
,
which
,
as
the
limbs
are
*NL*
magnified
and
distorted
withal
,
produces
a
monstrous
effect
,
making
fit
*NL*
studies
for
a
Michael
Angelo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
is
so
transparent
that
the
bottom
can
easily
be
discerned
at
*NL*
the
depth
of
twenty-five
or
thirty
feet
.
Paddling
over
it
,
you
may
see
,
*NL*
many
feet
beneath
the
surface
,
the
schools
of
perch
and
shiners
,
*NL*
perhaps
only
an
inch
long
,
yet
the
former
easily
distinguished
by
their
*NL*
transverse
bars
,
and
you
think
that
they
must
be
ascetic
fish
that
find
*NL*
a
subsistence
there
.
Once
,
in
the
winter
,
many
years
ago
,
when
I
had
*NL*
been
cutting
holes
through
the
ice
in
order
to
catch
pickerel
,
as
I
*NL*
stepped
ashore
I
tossed
my
axe
back
on
to
the
ice
,
but
,
as
if
some
evil
*NL*
genius
had
directed
it
,
it
slid
four
or
five
rods
directly
into
one
of
*NL*
the
holes
,
where
the
water
was
twenty-five
feet
deep
.
Out
of
curiosity
,
*NL*
I
lay
down
on
the
ice
and
looked
through
the
hole
,
until
I
saw
the
axe
*NL*
a
little
on
one
side
,
standing
on
its
head
,
with
its
helve
erect
and
*NL*
gently
swaying
to
and
fro
with
the
pulse
of
the
pond
;
and
there
it
*NL*
might
have
stood
erect
and
swaying
till
in
the
course
of
time
the
handle
*NL*
rotted
off
,
if
I
had
not
disturbed
it
.
Making
another
hole
directly
over
*NL*
it
with
an
ice
chisel
which
I
had
,
and
cutting
down
the
longest
*NL*
birch
which
I
could
find
in
the
neighborhood
with
my
knife
,
I
made
a
*NL*
slip-noose
,
which
I
attached
to
its
end
,
and
,
letting
it
down
carefully
,
*NL*
passed
it
over
the
knob
of
the
handle
,
and
drew
it
by
a
line
along
the
*NL*
birch
,
and
so
pulled
the
axe
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shore
is
composed
of
a
belt
of
smooth
rounded
white
stones
like
*NL*
paving-stones
,
excepting
one
or
two
short
sand
beaches
,
and
is
so
steep
*NL*
that
in
many
places
a
single
leap
will
carry
you
into
water
over
your
*NL*
head
;
and
were
it
not
for
its
remarkable
transparency
,
that
would
be
the
*NL*
last
to
be
seen
of
its
bottom
till
it
rose
on
the
opposite
side
.
Some
*NL*
think
it
is
bottomless
.
It
is
nowhere
muddy
,
and
a
casual
observer
would
*NL*
say
that
there
were
no
weeds
at
all
in
it
;
and
of
noticeable
plants
,
*NL*
except
in
the
little
meadows
recently
overflowed
,
which
do
not
properly
*NL*
belong
to
it
,
a
closer
scrutiny
does
not
detect
a
flag
nor
a
bulrush
,
*NL*
nor
even
a
lily
,
yellow
or
white
,
but
only
a
few
small
heart-leaves
and
*NL*
potamogetons
,
and
perhaps
a
water-target
or
two
;
all
which
however
a
*NL*
bather
might
not
perceive
;
and
these
plants
are
clean
and
bright
like
*NL*
the
element
they
grow
in
.
The
stones
extend
a
rod
or
two
into
the
water
,
*NL*
and
then
the
bottom
is
pure
sand
,
except
in
the
deepest
parts
,
where
*NL*
there
is
usually
a
little
sediment
,
probably
from
the
decay
of
the
*NL*
leaves
which
have
been
wafted
on
to
it
so
many
successive
falls
,
and
a
*NL*
bright
green
weed
is
brought
up
on
anchors
even
in
midwinter
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
one
other
pond
just
like
this
,
White
Pond
,
in
Nine
Acre
Corner
,
*NL*
about
two
and
a
half
miles
westerly
;
but
,
though
I
am
acquainted
with
*NL*
most
of
the
ponds
within
a
dozen
miles
of
this
centre
I
do
not
know
a
*NL*
third
of
this
pure
and
well-like
character
.
Successive
nations
perchance
*NL*
have
drank
at
,
admired
,
and
fathomed
it
,
and
passed
away
,
and
still
its
*NL*
water
is
green
and
pellucid
as
ever
.
Not
an
intermitting
spring
!
Perhaps
*NL*
on
that
spring
morning
when
Adam
and
Eve
were
driven
out
of
Eden
Walden
*NL*
Pond
was
already
in
existence
,
and
even
then
breaking
up
in
a
gentle
*NL*
spring
rain
accompanied
with
mist
and
a
southerly
wind
,
and
covered
with
*NL*
myriads
of
ducks
and
geese
,
which
had
not
heard
of
the
fall
,
when
still
*NL*
such
pure
lakes
sufficed
them
.
Even
then
it
had
commenced
to
rise
and
*NL*
fall
,
and
had
clarified
its
waters
and
colored
them
of
the
hue
they
now
*NL*
wear
,
and
obtained
a
patent
of
Heaven
to
be
the
only
Walden
Pond
in
*NL*
the
world
and
distiller
of
celestial
dews
.
Who
knows
in
how
many
*NL*
unremembered
nations
'
literatures
this
has
been
the
Castalian
Fountain
?
*NL*
or
what
nymphs
presided
over
it
in
the
Golden
Age
?
It
is
a
gem
of
the
*NL*
first
water
which
Concord
wears
in
her
coronet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
perchance
the
first
who
came
to
this
well
have
left
some
trace
of
*NL*
their
footsteps
.
I
have
been
surprised
to
detect
encircling
the
pond
,
*NL*
even
where
a
thick
wood
has
just
been
cut
down
on
the
shore
,
a
narrow
*NL*
shelf-like
path
in
the
steep
hillside
,
alternately
rising
and
falling
,
*NL*
approaching
and
receding
from
the
water
's
edge
,
as
old
probably
as
the
*NL*
race
of
man
here
,
worn
by
the
feet
of
aboriginal
hunters
,
and
still
from
*NL*
time
to
time
unwittingly
trodden
by
the
present
occupants
of
the
land
.
*NL*
This
is
particularly
distinct
to
one
standing
on
the
middle
of
the
pond
*NL*
in
winter
,
just
after
a
light
snow
has
fallen
,
appearing
as
a
clear
*NL*
undulating
white
line
,
unobscured
by
weeds
and
twigs
,
and
very
obvious
*NL*
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
in
many
places
where
in
summer
it
is
hardly
*NL*
distinguishable
close
at
hand
.
The
snow
reprints
it
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
clear
white
type
alto-relievo
.
The
ornamented
grounds
of
villas
which
*NL*
will
one
day
be
built
here
may
still
preserve
some
trace
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pond
rises
and
falls
,
but
whether
regularly
or
not
,
and
within
what
*NL*
period
,
nobody
knows
,
though
,
as
usual
,
many
pretend
to
know
.
It
is
*NL*
commonly
higher
in
the
winter
and
lower
in
the
summer
,
though
not
*NL*
corresponding
to
the
general
wet
and
dryness
.
I
can
remember
when
it
*NL*
was
a
foot
or
two
lower
,
and
also
when
it
was
at
least
five
feet
higher
,
*NL*
than
when
I
lived
by
it
.
There
is
a
narrow
sand-bar
running
into
it
,
*NL*
with
very
deep
water
on
one
side
,
on
which
I
helped
boil
a
kettle
of
*NL*
chowder
,
some
six
rods
from
the
main
shore
,
about
the
year
1824
,
which
*NL*
it
has
not
been
possible
to
do
for
twenty-five
years
;
and
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
my
friends
used
to
listen
with
incredulity
when
I
told
them
,
that
*NL*
a
few
years
later
I
was
accustomed
to
fish
from
a
boat
in
a
secluded
*NL*
cove
in
the
woods
,
fifteen
rods
from
the
only
shore
they
knew
,
which
*NL*
place
was
long
since
converted
into
a
meadow
.
But
the
pond
has
risen
*NL*
steadily
for
two
years
,
and
now
,
in
the
summer
of
'
52
,
is
just
five
feet
*NL*
higher
than
when
I
lived
there
,
or
as
high
as
it
was
thirty
years
ago
,
*NL*
and
fishing
goes
on
again
in
the
meadow
.
This
makes
a
difference
of
*NL*
level
,
at
the
outside
,
of
six
or
seven
feet
;
and
yet
the
water
shed
by
*NL*
the
surrounding
hills
is
insignificant
in
amount
,
and
this
overflow
must
*NL*
be
referred
to
causes
which
affect
the
deep
springs
.
This
same
*NL*
summer
the
pond
has
begun
to
fall
again
.
It
is
remarkable
that
this
*NL*
fluctuation
,
whether
periodical
or
not
,
appears
thus
to
require
many
*NL*
years
for
its
accomplishment
.
I
have
observed
one
rise
and
a
part
of
two
*NL*
falls
,
and
I
expect
that
a
dozen
or
fifteen
years
hence
the
water
will
*NL*
again
be
as
low
as
I
have
ever
known
it
.
Flint
's
Pond
,
a
mile
eastward
,
*NL*
allowing
for
the
disturbance
occasioned
by
its
inlets
and
outlets
,
*NL*
and
the
smaller
intermediate
ponds
also
,
sympathize
with
Walden
,
and
*NL*
recently
attained
their
greatest
height
at
the
same
time
with
the
*NL*
latter
.
The
same
is
true
,
as
far
as
my
observation
goes
,
of
White
Pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rise
and
fall
of
Walden
at
long
intervals
serves
this
use
at
least
;
*NL*
the
water
standing
at
this
great
height
for
a
year
or
more
,
though
it
*NL*
makes
it
difficult
to
walk
round
it
,
kills
the
shrubs
and
trees
which
*NL*
have
sprung
up
about
its
edge
since
the
last
rise
--
pitch
pines
,
birches
,
*NL*
alders
,
aspens
,
and
others
--
and
,
falling
again
,
leaves
an
unobstructed
*NL*
shore
;
for
,
unlike
many
ponds
and
all
waters
which
are
subject
to
a
*NL*
daily
tide
,
its
shore
is
cleanest
when
the
water
is
lowest
.
On
the
side
*NL*
of
the
pond
next
my
house
a
row
of
pitch
pines
,
fifteen
feet
high
,
has
*NL*
been
killed
and
tipped
over
as
if
by
a
lever
,
and
thus
a
stop
put
to
*NL*
their
encroachments
;
and
their
size
indicates
how
many
years
have
*NL*
elapsed
since
the
last
rise
to
this
height
.
By
this
fluctuation
the
pond
*NL*
asserts
its
title
to
a
shore
,
and
thus
the
_
shore
_
is
_
shorn
_
,
and
the
*NL*
trees
can
not
hold
it
by
right
of
possession
.
These
are
the
lips
of
the
*NL*
lake
,
on
which
no
beard
grows
.
It
licks
its
chaps
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
When
the
water
is
at
its
height
,
the
alders
,
willows
,
and
maples
send
*NL*
forth
a
mass
of
fibrous
red
roots
several
feet
long
from
all
sides
of
*NL*
their
stems
in
the
water
,
and
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
feet
from
*NL*
the
ground
,
in
the
effort
to
maintain
themselves
;
and
I
have
known
the
*NL*
high
blueberry
bushes
about
the
shore
,
which
commonly
produce
no
fruit
,
*NL*
bear
an
abundant
crop
under
these
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
have
been
puzzled
to
tell
how
the
shore
became
so
regularly
paved
.
*NL*
My
townsmen
have
all
heard
the
tradition
--
the
oldest
people
tell
me
that
*NL*
they
heard
it
in
their
youth
--
that
anciently
the
Indians
were
holding
*NL*
a
pow-wow
upon
a
hill
here
,
which
rose
as
high
into
the
heavens
as
the
*NL*
pond
now
sinks
deep
into
the
earth
,
and
they
used
much
profanity
,
as
*NL*
the
story
goes
,
though
this
vice
is
one
of
which
the
Indians
were
never
*NL*
guilty
,
and
while
they
were
thus
engaged
the
hill
shook
and
suddenly
*NL*
sank
,
and
only
one
old
squaw
,
named
Walden
,
escaped
,
and
from
her
the
*NL*
pond
was
named
.
It
has
been
conjectured
that
when
the
hill
shook
these
*NL*
stones
rolled
down
its
side
and
became
the
present
shore
.
It
is
very
*NL*
certain
,
at
any
rate
,
that
once
there
was
no
pond
here
,
and
now
there
*NL*
is
one
;
and
this
Indian
fable
does
not
in
any
respect
conflict
with
the
*NL*
account
of
that
ancient
settler
whom
I
have
mentioned
,
who
remembers
*NL*
so
well
when
he
first
came
here
with
his
divining-rod
,
saw
a
thin
vapor
*NL*
rising
from
the
sward
,
and
the
hazel
pointed
steadily
downward
,
and
he
*NL*
concluded
to
dig
a
well
here
.
As
for
the
stones
,
many
still
think
that
*NL*
they
are
hardly
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
action
of
the
waves
on
these
*NL*
hills
;
but
I
observe
that
the
surrounding
hills
are
remarkably
full
of
*NL*
the
same
kind
of
stones
,
so
that
they
have
been
obliged
to
pile
them
*NL*
up
in
walls
on
both
sides
of
the
railroad
cut
nearest
the
pond
;
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
there
are
most
stones
where
the
shore
is
most
abrupt
;
so
that
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
it
is
no
longer
a
mystery
to
me
.
I
detect
the
paver
.
If
*NL*
the
name
was
not
derived
from
that
of
some
English
locality
--
Saffron
*NL*
Walden
,
for
instance
--
one
might
suppose
that
it
was
called
originally
*NL*
_
Walled-in
_
Pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pond
was
my
well
ready
dug
.
For
four
months
in
the
year
its
water
is
*NL*
as
cold
as
it
is
pure
at
all
times
;
and
I
think
that
it
is
then
as
good
*NL*
as
any
,
if
not
the
best
,
in
the
town
.
In
the
winter
,
all
water
which
is
*NL*
exposed
to
the
air
is
colder
than
springs
and
wells
which
are
protected
*NL*
from
it
.
The
temperature
of
the
pond
water
which
had
stood
in
the
room
*NL*
where
I
sat
from
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
till
noon
the
next
day
,
*NL*
the
sixth
of
March
,
1846
,
the
thermometer
having
been
up
to
65Aº
or
70Aº
*NL*
some
of
the
time
,
owing
partly
to
the
sun
on
the
roof
,
was
42Aº
,
or
one
*NL*
degree
colder
than
the
water
of
one
of
the
coldest
wells
in
the
village
*NL*
just
drawn
.
The
temperature
of
the
Boiling
Spring
the
same
day
was
45Aº
,
*NL*
or
the
warmest
of
any
water
tried
,
though
it
is
the
coldest
that
I
know
*NL*
of
in
summer
,
when
,
beside
,
shallow
and
stagnant
surface
water
is
not
*NL*
mingled
with
it
.
Moreover
,
in
summer
,
Walden
never
becomes
so
warm
as
*NL*
most
water
which
is
exposed
to
the
sun
,
on
account
of
its
depth
.
In
the
*NL*
warmest
weather
I
usually
placed
a
pailful
in
my
cellar
,
where
it
*NL*
became
cool
in
the
night
,
and
remained
so
during
the
day
;
though
I
also
*NL*
resorted
to
a
spring
in
the
neighborhood
.
It
was
as
good
when
a
week
old
*NL*
as
the
day
it
was
dipped
,
and
had
no
taste
of
the
pump
.
Whoever
camps
*NL*
for
a
week
in
summer
by
the
shore
of
a
pond
,
needs
only
bury
a
pail
of
*NL*
water
a
few
feet
deep
in
the
shade
of
his
camp
to
be
independent
of
the
*NL*
luxury
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
have
been
caught
in
Walden
pickerel
,
one
weighing
seven
pounds
--
to
*NL*
say
nothing
of
another
which
carried
off
a
reel
with
great
velocity
,
*NL*
which
the
fisherman
safely
set
down
at
eight
pounds
because
he
did
*NL*
not
see
him
--
perch
and
pouts
,
some
of
each
weighing
over
two
pounds
,
*NL*
shiners
,
chivins
or
roach
-LRB-
_
Leuciscus
pulchellus
_
-RRB-
,
a
very
few
breams
,
and
*NL*
a
couple
of
eels
,
one
weighing
four
pounds
--
I
am
thus
particular
because
*NL*
the
weight
of
a
fish
is
commonly
its
only
title
to
fame
,
and
these
are
*NL*
the
only
eels
I
have
heard
of
here
;
--
also
,
I
have
a
faint
recollection
*NL*
of
a
little
fish
some
five
inches
long
,
with
silvery
sides
and
a
*NL*
greenish
back
,
somewhat
dace-like
in
its
character
,
which
I
mention
here
*NL*
chiefly
to
link
my
facts
to
fable
.
Nevertheless
,
this
pond
is
not
very
*NL*
fertile
in
fish
.
Its
pickerel
,
though
not
abundant
,
are
its
chief
boast
.
*NL*
I
have
seen
at
one
time
lying
on
the
ice
pickerel
of
at
least
three
*NL*
different
kinds
:
a
long
and
shallow
one
,
steel-colored
,
most
like
those
*NL*
caught
in
the
river
;
a
bright
golden
kind
,
with
greenish
reflections
*NL*
and
remarkably
deep
,
which
is
the
most
common
here
;
and
another
,
*NL*
golden-colored
,
and
shaped
like
the
last
,
but
peppered
on
the
sides
with
*NL*
small
dark
brown
or
black
spots
,
intermixed
with
a
few
faint
blood-red
*NL*
ones
,
very
much
like
a
trout
.
The
specific
name
_
reticulatus
_
would
not
*NL*
apply
to
this
;
it
should
be
_
guttatus
_
rather
.
These
are
all
very
firm
*NL*
fish
,
and
weigh
more
than
their
size
promises
.
The
shiners
,
pouts
,
and
*NL*
perch
also
,
and
indeed
all
the
fishes
which
inhabit
this
pond
,
are
much
*NL*
cleaner
,
handsomer
,
and
firmer-fleshed
than
those
in
the
river
and
most
*NL*
other
ponds
,
as
the
water
is
purer
,
and
they
can
easily
be
distinguished
*NL*
from
them
.
Probably
many
ichthyologists
would
make
new
varieties
of
some
*NL*
of
them
.
There
are
also
a
clean
race
of
frogs
and
tortoises
,
and
a
*NL*
few
mussels
in
it
;
muskrats
and
minks
leave
their
traces
about
it
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
a
travelling
mud-turtle
visits
it
.
Sometimes
,
when
I
pushed
*NL*
off
my
boat
in
the
morning
,
I
disturbed
a
great
mud-turtle
which
had
*NL*
secreted
himself
under
the
boat
in
the
night
.
Ducks
and
geese
frequent
*NL*
it
in
the
spring
and
fall
,
the
white-bellied
swallows
-LRB-
_
Hirundo
bicolor
_
-RRB-
*NL*
skim
over
it
,
and
the
peetweets
-LRB-
_
Totanus
macularius
_
-RRB-
``
teeter
''
along
its
*NL*
stony
shores
all
summer
.
I
have
sometimes
disturbed
a
fish
hawk
sitting
*NL*
on
a
white
pine
over
the
water
;
but
I
doubt
if
it
is
ever
profaned
by
*NL*
the
wind
of
a
gull
,
like
Fair
Haven
.
At
most
,
it
tolerates
one
annual
*NL*
loon
.
These
are
all
the
animals
of
consequence
which
frequent
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
see
from
a
boat
,
in
calm
weather
,
near
the
sandy
eastern
shore
,
*NL*
where
the
water
is
eight
or
ten
feet
deep
,
and
also
in
some
other
parts
*NL*
of
the
pond
,
some
circular
heaps
half
a
dozen
feet
in
diameter
by
a
foot
*NL*
in
height
,
consisting
of
small
stones
less
than
a
hen
's
egg
in
size
,
*NL*
where
all
around
is
bare
sand
.
At
first
you
wonder
if
the
Indians
*NL*
could
have
formed
them
on
the
ice
for
any
purpose
,
and
so
,
when
the
ice
*NL*
melted
,
they
sank
to
the
bottom
;
but
they
are
too
regular
and
some
of
*NL*
them
plainly
too
fresh
for
that
.
They
are
similar
to
those
found
in
*NL*
rivers
;
but
as
there
are
no
suckers
nor
lampreys
here
,
I
know
not
by
*NL*
what
fish
they
could
be
made
.
Perhaps
they
are
the
nests
of
the
chivin
.
*NL*
These
lend
a
pleasing
mystery
to
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shore
is
irregular
enough
not
to
be
monotonous
.
I
have
in
my
mind
's
*NL*
eye
the
western
,
indented
with
deep
bays
,
the
bolder
northern
,
and
the
*NL*
beautifully
scalloped
southern
shore
,
where
successive
capes
overlap
*NL*
each
other
and
suggest
unexplored
coves
between
.
The
forest
has
never
*NL*
so
good
a
setting
,
nor
is
so
distinctly
beautiful
,
as
when
seen
from
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
small
lake
amid
hills
which
rise
from
the
water
's
edge
;
for
*NL*
the
water
in
which
it
is
reflected
not
only
makes
the
best
foreground
in
*NL*
such
a
case
,
but
,
with
its
winding
shore
,
the
most
natural
and
agreeable
*NL*
boundary
to
it
.
There
is
no
rawness
nor
imperfection
in
its
edge
there
,
*NL*
as
where
the
axe
has
cleared
a
part
,
or
a
cultivated
field
abuts
on
it
.
*NL*
The
trees
have
ample
room
to
expand
on
the
water
side
,
and
each
sends
*NL*
forth
its
most
vigorous
branch
in
that
direction
.
There
Nature
has
woven
*NL*
a
natural
selvage
,
and
the
eye
rises
by
just
gradations
from
the
low
*NL*
shrubs
of
the
shore
to
the
highest
trees
.
There
are
few
traces
of
man
's
*NL*
hand
to
be
seen
.
The
water
laves
the
shore
as
it
did
a
thousand
years
*NL*
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lake
is
the
landscape
's
most
beautiful
and
expressive
feature
.
It
is
*NL*
earth
's
eye
;
looking
into
which
the
beholder
measures
the
depth
of
*NL*
his
own
nature
.
The
fluviatile
trees
next
the
shore
are
the
slender
*NL*
eyelashes
which
fringe
it
,
and
the
wooded
hills
and
cliffs
around
are
*NL*
its
overhanging
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
on
the
smooth
sandy
beach
at
the
east
end
of
the
pond
,
in
*NL*
a
calm
September
afternoon
,
when
a
slight
haze
makes
the
opposite
*NL*
shore-line
indistinct
,
I
have
seen
whence
came
the
expression
,
``
the
*NL*
glassy
surface
of
a
lake
.
''
When
you
invert
your
head
,
it
looks
like
*NL*
a
thread
of
finest
gossamer
stretched
across
the
valley
,
and
gleaming
*NL*
against
the
distant
pine
woods
,
separating
one
stratum
of
the
atmosphere
*NL*
from
another
.
You
would
think
that
you
could
walk
dry
under
it
to
the
*NL*
opposite
hills
,
and
that
the
swallows
which
skim
over
might
perch
on
it
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
they
sometimes
dive
below
this
line
,
as
it
were
by
mistake
,
and
*NL*
are
undeceived
.
As
you
look
over
the
pond
westward
you
are
obliged
to
*NL*
employ
both
your
hands
to
defend
your
eyes
against
the
reflected
as
well
*NL*
as
the
true
sun
,
for
they
are
equally
bright
;
and
if
,
between
the
two
,
*NL*
you
survey
its
surface
critically
,
it
is
literally
as
smooth
as
glass
,
*NL*
except
where
the
skater
insects
,
at
equal
intervals
scattered
over
its
*NL*
whole
extent
,
by
their
motions
in
the
sun
produce
the
finest
imaginable
*NL*
sparkle
on
it
,
or
,
perchance
,
a
duck
plumes
itself
,
or
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
a
swallow
skims
so
low
as
to
touch
it
.
It
may
be
that
in
the
distance
a
*NL*
fish
describes
an
arc
of
three
or
four
feet
in
the
air
,
and
there
is
one
*NL*
bright
flash
where
it
emerges
,
and
another
where
it
strikes
the
water
;
*NL*
sometimes
the
whole
silvery
arc
is
revealed
;
or
here
and
there
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
is
a
thistle-down
floating
on
its
surface
,
which
the
fishes
dart
at
and
*NL*
so
dimple
it
again
.
It
is
like
molten
glass
cooled
but
not
congealed
,
*NL*
and
the
few
motes
in
it
are
pure
and
beautiful
like
the
imperfections
in
*NL*
glass
.
You
may
often
detect
a
yet
smoother
and
darker
water
,
separated
*NL*
from
the
rest
as
if
by
an
invisible
cobweb
,
boom
of
the
water
nymphs
,
*NL*
resting
on
it
.
From
a
hilltop
you
can
see
a
fish
leap
in
almost
any
*NL*
part
;
for
not
a
pickerel
or
shiner
picks
an
insect
from
this
smooth
*NL*
surface
but
it
manifestly
disturbs
the
equilibrium
of
the
whole
lake
.
*NL*
It
is
wonderful
with
what
elaborateness
this
simple
fact
is
*NL*
advertised
--
this
piscine
murder
will
out
--
and
from
my
distant
perch
I
*NL*
distinguish
the
circling
undulations
when
they
are
half
a
dozen
rods
*NL*
in
diameter
.
You
can
even
detect
a
water-bug
-LRB-
_
Gyrinus
_
-RRB-
ceaselessly
*NL*
progressing
over
the
smooth
surface
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
;
for
they
*NL*
furrow
the
water
slightly
,
making
a
conspicuous
ripple
bounded
by
two
*NL*
diverging
lines
,
but
the
skaters
glide
over
it
without
rippling
it
*NL*
perceptibly
.
When
the
surface
is
considerably
agitated
there
are
no
*NL*
skaters
nor
water-bugs
on
it
,
but
apparently
,
in
calm
days
,
they
leave
*NL*
their
havens
and
adventurously
glide
forth
from
the
shore
by
short
*NL*
impulses
till
they
completely
cover
it
.
It
is
a
soothing
employment
,
*NL*
on
one
of
those
fine
days
in
the
fall
when
all
the
warmth
of
the
sun
*NL*
is
fully
appreciated
,
to
sit
on
a
stump
on
such
a
height
as
this
,
*NL*
overlooking
the
pond
,
and
study
the
dimpling
circles
which
are
*NL*
incessantly
inscribed
on
its
otherwise
invisible
surface
amid
the
*NL*
reflected
skies
and
trees
.
Over
this
great
expanse
there
is
no
*NL*
disturbance
but
it
is
thus
at
once
gently
smoothed
away
and
assuaged
,
*NL*
as
,
when
a
vase
of
water
is
jarred
,
the
trembling
circles
seek
the
shore
*NL*
and
all
is
smooth
again
.
Not
a
fish
can
leap
or
an
insect
fall
on
the
*NL*
pond
but
it
is
thus
reported
in
circling
dimples
,
in
lines
of
beauty
,
as
*NL*
it
were
the
constant
welling
up
of
its
fountain
,
the
gentle
pulsing
of
*NL*
its
life
,
the
heaving
of
its
breast
.
The
thrills
of
joy
and
thrills
*NL*
of
pain
are
undistinguishable
.
How
peaceful
the
phenomena
of
the
lake
!
*NL*
Again
the
works
of
man
shine
as
in
the
spring
.
Ay
,
every
leaf
and
twig
*NL*
and
stone
and
cobweb
sparkles
now
at
mid-afternoon
as
when
covered
with
*NL*
dew
in
a
spring
morning
.
Every
motion
of
an
oar
or
an
insect
produces
a
*NL*
flash
of
light
;
and
if
an
oar
falls
,
how
sweet
the
echo
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
a
day
,
in
September
or
October
,
Walden
is
a
perfect
forest
*NL*
mirror
,
set
round
with
stones
as
precious
to
my
eye
as
if
fewer
or
*NL*
rarer
.
Nothing
so
fair
,
so
pure
,
and
at
the
same
time
so
large
,
as
a
*NL*
lake
,
perchance
,
lies
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
Sky
water
.
It
needs
*NL*
no
fence
.
Nations
come
and
go
without
defiling
it
.
It
is
a
mirror
which
*NL*
no
stone
can
crack
,
whose
quicksilver
will
never
wear
off
,
whose
gilding
*NL*
Nature
continually
repairs
;
no
storms
,
no
dust
,
can
dim
its
surface
ever
*NL*
fresh
;
--
a
mirror
in
which
all
impurity
presented
to
it
sinks
,
swept
and
*NL*
dusted
by
the
sun
's
hazy
brush
--
this
the
light
dust-cloth
--
which
retains
*NL*
no
breath
that
is
breathed
on
it
,
but
sends
its
own
to
float
as
clouds
*NL*
high
above
its
surface
,
and
be
reflected
in
its
bosom
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
field
of
water
betrays
the
spirit
that
is
in
the
air
.
It
is
*NL*
continually
receiving
new
life
and
motion
from
above
.
It
is
intermediate
*NL*
in
its
nature
between
land
and
sky
.
On
land
only
the
grass
and
trees
*NL*
wave
,
but
the
water
itself
is
rippled
by
the
wind
.
I
see
where
the
*NL*
breeze
dashes
across
it
by
the
streaks
or
flakes
of
light
.
It
is
*NL*
remarkable
that
we
can
look
down
on
its
surface
.
We
shall
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
look
down
thus
on
the
surface
of
air
at
length
,
and
mark
where
a
still
*NL*
subtler
spirit
sweeps
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
skaters
and
water-bugs
finally
disappear
in
the
latter
part
of
*NL*
October
,
when
the
severe
frosts
have
come
;
and
then
and
in
November
,
*NL*
usually
,
in
a
calm
day
,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
ripple
the
*NL*
surface
.
One
November
afternoon
,
in
the
calm
at
the
end
of
a
rain-storm
*NL*
of
several
days
'
duration
,
when
the
sky
was
still
completely
overcast
*NL*
and
the
air
was
full
of
mist
,
I
observed
that
the
pond
was
remarkably
*NL*
smooth
,
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
its
surface
;
though
it
*NL*
no
longer
reflected
the
bright
tints
of
October
,
but
the
sombre
November
*NL*
colors
of
the
surrounding
hills
.
Though
I
passed
over
it
as
gently
as
*NL*
possible
,
the
slight
undulations
produced
by
my
boat
extended
almost
*NL*
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
and
gave
a
ribbed
appearance
to
the
reflections
.
*NL*
But
,
as
I
was
looking
over
the
surface
,
I
saw
here
and
there
at
a
*NL*
distance
a
faint
glimmer
,
as
if
some
skater
insects
which
had
escaped
*NL*
the
frosts
might
be
collected
there
,
or
,
perchance
,
the
surface
,
being
*NL*
so
smooth
,
betrayed
where
a
spring
welled
up
from
the
bottom
.
Paddling
*NL*
gently
to
one
of
these
places
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
myself
surrounded
*NL*
by
myriads
of
small
perch
,
about
five
inches
long
,
of
a
rich
bronze
*NL*
color
in
the
green
water
,
sporting
there
,
and
constantly
rising
to
*NL*
the
surface
and
dimpling
it
,
sometimes
leaving
bubbles
on
it
.
In
such
*NL*
transparent
and
seemingly
bottomless
water
,
reflecting
the
clouds
,
*NL*
I
seemed
to
be
floating
through
the
air
as
in
a
balloon
,
and
their
*NL*
swimming
impressed
me
as
a
kind
of
flight
or
hovering
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
a
compact
flock
of
birds
passing
just
beneath
my
level
on
the
right
or
*NL*
left
,
their
fins
,
like
sails
,
set
all
around
them
.
There
were
many
such
*NL*
schools
in
the
pond
,
apparently
improving
the
short
season
before
winter
*NL*
would
draw
an
icy
shutter
over
their
broad
skylight
,
sometimes
giving
*NL*
to
the
surface
an
appearance
as
if
a
slight
breeze
struck
it
,
or
a
few
*NL*
rain-drops
fell
there
.
When
I
approached
carelessly
and
alarmed
them
,
*NL*
they
made
a
sudden
splash
and
rippling
with
their
tails
,
as
if
one
had
*NL*
struck
the
water
with
a
brushy
bough
,
and
instantly
took
refuge
in
the
*NL*
depths
.
At
length
the
wind
rose
,
the
mist
increased
,
and
the
waves
began
*NL*
to
run
,
and
the
perch
leaped
much
higher
than
before
,
half
out
of
water
,
*NL*
a
hundred
black
points
,
three
inches
long
,
at
once
above
the
surface
.
*NL*
Even
as
late
as
the
fifth
of
December
,
one
year
,
I
saw
some
dimples
on
*NL*
the
surface
,
and
thinking
it
was
going
to
rain
hard
immediately
,
the
*NL*
air
being
full
of
mist
,
I
made
haste
to
take
my
place
at
the
oars
and
row
*NL*
homeward
;
already
the
rain
seemed
rapidly
increasing
,
though
I
felt
*NL*
none
on
my
cheek
,
and
I
anticipated
a
thorough
soaking
.
But
suddenly
the
*NL*
dimples
ceased
,
for
they
were
produced
by
the
perch
,
which
the
noise
*NL*
of
my
oars
had
seared
into
the
depths
,
and
I
saw
their
schools
dimly
*NL*
disappearing
;
so
I
spent
a
dry
afternoon
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
who
used
to
frequent
this
pond
nearly
sixty
years
ago
,
when
*NL*
it
was
dark
with
surrounding
forests
,
tells
me
that
in
those
days
he
*NL*
sometimes
saw
it
all
alive
with
ducks
and
other
water-fowl
,
and
that
*NL*
there
were
many
eagles
about
it
.
He
came
here
a-fishing
,
and
used
an
*NL*
old
log
canoe
which
he
found
on
the
shore
.
It
was
made
of
two
white
pine
*NL*
logs
dug
out
and
pinned
together
,
and
was
cut
off
square
at
the
ends
.
*NL*
It
was
very
clumsy
,
but
lasted
a
great
many
years
before
it
became
*NL*
water-logged
and
perhaps
sank
to
the
bottom
.
He
did
not
know
whose
it
*NL*
was
;
it
belonged
to
the
pond
.
He
used
to
make
a
cable
for
his
anchor
of
*NL*
strips
of
hickory
bark
tied
together
.
An
old
man
,
a
potter
,
who
lived
*NL*
by
the
pond
before
the
Revolution
,
told
him
once
that
there
was
an
iron
*NL*
chest
at
the
bottom
,
and
that
he
had
seen
it
.
Sometimes
it
would
come
*NL*
floating
up
to
the
shore
;
but
when
you
went
toward
it
,
it
would
go
back
*NL*
into
deep
water
and
disappear
.
I
was
pleased
to
hear
of
the
old
log
*NL*
canoe
,
which
took
the
place
of
an
Indian
one
of
the
same
material
but
*NL*
more
graceful
construction
,
which
perchance
had
first
been
a
tree
on
the
*NL*
bank
,
and
then
,
as
it
were
,
fell
into
the
water
,
to
float
there
for
a
*NL*
generation
,
the
most
proper
vessel
for
the
lake
.
I
remember
that
when
I
*NL*
first
looked
into
these
depths
there
were
many
large
trunks
to
be
seen
*NL*
indistinctly
lying
on
the
bottom
,
which
had
either
been
blown
over
*NL*
formerly
,
or
left
on
the
ice
at
the
last
cutting
,
when
wood
was
cheaper
;
*NL*
but
now
they
have
mostly
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
first
paddled
a
boat
on
Walden
,
it
was
completely
surrounded
by
*NL*
thick
and
lofty
pine
and
oak
woods
,
and
in
some
of
its
coves
grape-vines
*NL*
had
run
over
the
trees
next
the
water
and
formed
bowers
under
which
a
*NL*
boat
could
pass
.
The
hills
which
form
its
shores
are
so
steep
,
and
the
*NL*
woods
on
them
were
then
so
high
,
that
,
as
you
looked
down
from
the
west
*NL*
end
,
it
had
the
appearance
of
an
amphitheatre
for
some
land
of
sylvan
*NL*
spectacle
.
I
have
spent
many
an
hour
,
when
I
was
younger
,
floating
over
*NL*
its
surface
as
the
zephyr
willed
,
having
paddled
my
boat
to
the
middle
,
*NL*
and
lying
on
my
back
across
the
seats
,
in
a
summer
forenoon
,
dreaming
*NL*
awake
,
until
I
was
aroused
by
the
boat
touching
the
sand
,
and
I
arose
to
*NL*
see
what
shore
my
fates
had
impelled
me
to
;
days
when
idleness
was
the
*NL*
most
attractive
and
productive
industry
.
Many
a
forenoon
have
I
stolen
*NL*
away
,
preferring
to
spend
thus
the
most
valued
part
of
the
day
;
for
I
*NL*
was
rich
,
if
not
in
money
,
in
sunny
hours
and
summer
days
,
and
spent
*NL*
them
lavishly
;
nor
do
I
regret
that
I
did
not
waste
more
of
them
in
*NL*
the
workshop
or
the
teacher
's
desk
.
But
since
I
left
those
shores
the
*NL*
woodchoppers
have
still
further
laid
them
waste
,
and
now
for
many
a
*NL*
year
there
will
be
no
more
rambling
through
the
aisles
of
the
wood
,
*NL*
with
occasional
vistas
through
which
you
see
the
water
.
My
Muse
may
be
*NL*
excused
if
she
is
silent
henceforth
.
How
can
you
expect
the
birds
to
*NL*
sing
when
their
groves
are
cut
down
?
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
trunks
of
trees
on
the
bottom
,
and
the
old
log
canoe
,
and
the
*NL*
dark
surrounding
woods
,
are
gone
,
and
the
villagers
,
who
scarcely
know
*NL*
where
it
lies
,
instead
of
going
to
the
pond
to
bathe
or
drink
,
are
*NL*
thinking
to
bring
its
water
,
which
should
be
as
sacred
as
the
Ganges
*NL*
at
least
,
to
the
village
in
a
pipe
,
to
wash
their
dishes
with
!
--
to
*NL*
earn
their
Walden
by
the
turning
of
a
cock
or
drawing
of
a
plug
!
That
*NL*
devilish
Iron
Horse
,
whose
ear-rending
neigh
is
heard
throughout
the
*NL*
town
,
has
muddied
the
Boiling
Spring
with
his
foot
,
and
he
it
is
that
*NL*
has
browsed
off
all
the
woods
on
Walden
shore
,
that
Trojan
horse
,
with
a
*NL*
thousand
men
in
his
belly
,
introduced
by
mercenary
Greeks
!
Where
is
the
*NL*
country
's
champion
,
the
Moore
of
Moore
Hill
,
to
meet
him
at
the
Deep
Cut
*NL*
and
thrust
an
avenging
lance
between
the
ribs
of
the
bloated
pest
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
of
all
the
characters
I
have
known
,
perhaps
Walden
wears
*NL*
best
,
and
best
preserves
its
purity
.
Many
men
have
been
likened
to
it
,
*NL*
but
few
deserve
that
honor
.
Though
the
woodchoppers
have
laid
bare
first
*NL*
this
shore
and
then
that
,
and
the
Irish
have
built
their
sties
by
it
,
*NL*
and
the
railroad
has
infringed
on
its
border
,
and
the
ice-men
have
*NL*
skimmed
it
once
,
it
is
itself
unchanged
,
the
same
water
which
my
*NL*
youthful
eyes
fell
on
;
all
the
change
is
in
me
.
It
has
not
acquired
one
*NL*
permanent
wrinkle
after
all
its
ripples
.
It
is
perennially
young
,
and
*NL*
I
may
stand
and
see
a
swallow
dip
apparently
to
pick
an
insect
from
its
*NL*
surface
as
of
yore
.
It
struck
me
again
tonight
,
as
if
I
had
not
seen
it
*NL*
almost
daily
for
more
than
twenty
years
--
Why
,
here
is
Walden
,
the
same
*NL*
woodland
lake
that
I
discovered
so
many
years
ago
;
where
a
forest
was
*NL*
cut
down
last
winter
another
is
springing
up
by
its
shore
as
lustily
as
*NL*
ever
;
the
same
thought
is
welling
up
to
its
surface
that
was
then
;
it
*NL*
is
the
same
liquid
joy
and
happiness
to
itself
and
its
Maker
,
ay
,
and
it
*NL*
may
be
to
me
.
It
is
the
work
of
a
brave
man
surely
,
in
whom
there
was
no
*NL*
guile
!
He
rounded
this
water
with
his
hand
,
deepened
and
clarified
it
in
*NL*
his
thought
,
and
in
his
will
bequeathed
it
to
Concord
.
I
see
by
its
face
*NL*
that
it
is
visited
by
the
same
reflection
;
and
I
can
almost
say
,
Walden
,
*NL*
is
it
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
dream
of
mine
,
*NL*
To
ornament
a
line
;
*NL*
I
can
not
come
nearer
to
God
and
Heaven
*NL*
Than
I
live
to
Walden
even
.
*NL*
I
am
its
stony
shore
,
*NL*
And
the
breeze
that
passes
o'er
;
*NL*
In
the
hollow
of
my
hand
*NL*
Are
its
water
and
its
sand
,
*NL*
And
its
deepest
resort
*NL*
Lies
high
in
my
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cars
never
pause
to
look
at
it
;
yet
I
fancy
that
the
engineers
and
*NL*
firemen
and
brakemen
,
and
those
passengers
who
have
a
season
ticket
and
*NL*
see
it
often
,
are
better
men
for
the
sight
.
The
engineer
does
not
forget
*NL*
at
night
,
or
his
nature
does
not
,
that
he
has
beheld
this
vision
of
*NL*
serenity
and
purity
once
at
least
during
the
day
.
Though
seen
but
once
,
*NL*
it
helps
to
wash
out
State
Street
and
the
engine
's
soot
.
One
proposes
*NL*
that
it
be
called
``
God
's
Drop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
said
that
Walden
has
no
visible
inlet
nor
outlet
,
but
it
is
on
*NL*
the
one
hand
distantly
and
indirectly
related
to
Flint
's
Pond
,
which
is
*NL*
more
elevated
,
by
a
chain
of
small
ponds
coming
from
that
quarter
,
and
*NL*
on
the
other
directly
and
manifestly
to
Concord
River
,
which
is
lower
,
*NL*
by
a
similar
chain
of
ponds
through
which
in
some
other
geological
*NL*
period
it
may
have
flowed
,
and
by
a
little
digging
,
which
God
forbid
,
*NL*
it
can
be
made
to
flow
thither
again
.
If
by
living
thus
reserved
and
*NL*
austere
,
like
a
hermit
in
the
woods
,
so
long
,
it
has
acquired
such
*NL*
wonderful
purity
,
who
would
not
regret
that
the
comparatively
impure
*NL*
waters
of
Flint
's
Pond
should
be
mingled
with
it
,
or
itself
should
ever
*NL*
go
to
waste
its
sweetness
in
the
ocean
wave
?
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Flint
's
,
or
Sandy
Pond
,
in
Lincoln
,
our
greatest
lake
and
inland
sea
,
*NL*
lies
about
a
mile
east
of
Walden
.
It
is
much
larger
,
being
said
to
*NL*
contain
one
hundred
and
ninety-seven
acres
,
and
is
more
fertile
in
fish
;
*NL*
but
it
is
comparatively
shallow
,
and
not
remarkably
pure
.
A
walk
through
*NL*
the
woods
thither
was
often
my
recreation
.
It
was
worth
the
while
,
if
*NL*
only
to
feel
the
wind
blow
on
your
cheek
freely
,
and
see
the
waves
run
,
*NL*
and
remember
the
life
of
mariners
.
I
went
a-chestnutting
there
in
the
*NL*
fall
,
on
windy
days
,
when
the
nuts
were
dropping
into
the
water
and
were
*NL*
washed
to
my
feet
;
and
one
day
,
as
I
crept
along
its
sedgy
shore
,
the
*NL*
fresh
spray
blowing
in
my
face
,
I
came
upon
the
mouldering
wreck
of
a
*NL*
boat
,
the
sides
gone
,
and
hardly
more
than
the
impression
of
its
flat
*NL*
bottom
left
amid
the
rushes
;
yet
its
model
was
sharply
defined
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
large
decayed
pad
,
with
its
veins
.
It
was
as
impressive
a
wreck
*NL*
as
one
could
imagine
on
the
seashore
,
and
had
as
good
a
moral
.
It
is
by
*NL*
this
time
mere
vegetable
mould
and
undistinguishable
pond
shore
,
through
*NL*
which
rushes
and
flags
have
pushed
up
.
I
used
to
admire
the
ripple
marks
*NL*
on
the
sandy
bottom
,
at
the
north
end
of
this
pond
,
made
firm
and
hard
*NL*
to
the
feet
of
the
wader
by
the
pressure
of
the
water
,
and
the
rushes
*NL*
which
grew
in
Indian
file
,
in
waving
lines
,
corresponding
to
these
*NL*
marks
,
rank
behind
rank
,
as
if
the
waves
had
planted
them
.
There
also
*NL*
I
have
found
,
in
considerable
quantities
,
curious
balls
,
composed
*NL*
apparently
of
fine
grass
or
roots
,
of
pipewort
perhaps
,
from
half
an
*NL*
inch
to
four
inches
in
diameter
,
and
perfectly
spherical
.
These
wash
*NL*
back
and
forth
in
shallow
water
on
a
sandy
bottom
,
and
are
sometimes
*NL*
cast
on
the
shore
.
They
are
either
solid
grass
,
or
have
a
little
sand
in
*NL*
the
middle
.
At
first
you
would
say
that
they
were
formed
by
the
action
*NL*
of
the
waves
,
like
a
pebble
;
yet
the
smallest
are
made
of
equally
coarse
*NL*
materials
,
half
an
inch
long
,
and
they
are
produced
only
at
one
season
*NL*
of
the
year
.
Moreover
,
the
waves
,
I
suspect
,
do
not
so
much
construct
*NL*
as
wear
down
a
material
which
has
already
acquired
consistency
.
They
*NL*
preserve
their
form
when
dry
for
an
indefinite
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Flint
's
Pond
!
_
Such
is
the
poverty
of
our
nomenclature
.
What
right
had
*NL*
the
unclean
and
stupid
farmer
,
whose
farm
abutted
on
this
sky
water
,
*NL*
whose
shores
he
has
ruthlessly
laid
bare
,
to
give
his
name
to
it
?
Some
*NL*
skin-flint
,
who
loved
better
the
reflecting
surface
of
a
dollar
,
or
a
*NL*
bright
cent
,
in
which
he
could
see
his
own
brazen
face
;
who
regarded
*NL*
even
the
wild
ducks
which
settled
in
it
as
trespassers
;
his
fingers
*NL*
grown
into
crooked
and
bony
talons
from
the
long
habit
of
grasping
*NL*
harpy-like
;
--
so
it
is
not
named
for
me
.
I
go
not
there
to
see
him
nor
to
*NL*
hear
of
him
;
who
never
saw
it
,
who
never
bathed
in
it
,
who
never
loved
*NL*
it
,
who
never
protected
it
,
who
never
spoke
a
good
word
for
it
,
nor
*NL*
thanked
God
that
He
had
made
it
.
Rather
let
it
be
named
from
the
fishes
*NL*
that
swim
in
it
,
the
wild
fowl
or
quadrupeds
which
frequent
it
,
the
wild
*NL*
flowers
which
grow
by
its
shores
,
or
some
wild
man
or
child
the
thread
*NL*
of
whose
history
is
interwoven
with
its
own
;
not
from
him
who
could
show
*NL*
no
title
to
it
but
the
deed
which
a
like-minded
neighbor
or
legislature
*NL*
gave
him
--
him
who
thought
only
of
its
money
value
;
whose
presence
*NL*
perchance
cursed
all
the
shores
;
who
exhausted
the
land
around
it
,
and
*NL*
would
fain
have
exhausted
the
waters
within
it
;
who
regretted
only
that
*NL*
it
was
not
English
hay
or
cranberry
meadow
--
there
was
nothing
to
redeem
*NL*
it
,
forsooth
,
in
his
eyes
--
and
would
have
drained
and
sold
it
for
the
*NL*
mud
at
its
bottom
.
It
did
not
turn
his
mill
,
and
it
was
no
_
privilege
_
to
*NL*
him
to
behold
it
.
I
respect
not
his
labors
,
his
farm
where
everything
*NL*
has
its
price
,
who
would
carry
the
landscape
,
who
would
carry
his
God
,
*NL*
to
market
,
if
he
could
get
anything
for
him
;
who
goes
to
market
_
for
_
his
*NL*
god
as
it
is
;
on
whose
farm
nothing
grows
free
,
whose
fields
bear
no
*NL*
crops
,
whose
meadows
no
flowers
,
whose
trees
no
fruits
,
but
dollars
;
who
*NL*
loves
not
the
beauty
of
his
fruits
,
whose
fruits
are
not
ripe
for
him
*NL*
till
they
are
turned
to
dollars
.
Give
me
the
poverty
that
enjoys
true
*NL*
wealth
.
Farmers
are
respectable
and
interesting
to
me
in
proportion
as
*NL*
they
are
poor
--
poor
farmers
.
A
model
farm
!
where
the
house
stands
like
a
*NL*
fungus
in
a
muckheap
,
chambers
for
men
,
horses
,
oxen
,
and
swine
,
cleansed
*NL*
and
uncleansed
,
all
contiguous
to
one
another
!
Stocked
with
men
!
A
great
*NL*
grease-spot
,
redolent
of
manures
and
buttermilk
!
Under
a
high
state
of
*NL*
cultivation
,
being
manured
with
the
hearts
and
brains
of
men
!
As
if
you
*NL*
were
to
raise
your
potatoes
in
the
churchyard
!
Such
is
a
model
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
no
;
if
the
fairest
features
of
the
landscape
are
to
be
named
after
*NL*
men
,
let
them
be
the
noblest
and
worthiest
men
alone
.
Let
our
lakes
*NL*
receive
as
true
names
at
least
as
the
Icarian
Sea
,
where
``
still
the
*NL*
shore
''
a
``
brave
attempt
resounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Goose
Pond
,
of
small
extent
,
is
on
my
way
to
Flint
's
;
Fair
Haven
,
an
*NL*
expansion
of
Concord
River
,
said
to
contain
some
seventy
acres
,
is
a
*NL*
mile
southwest
;
and
White
Pond
,
of
about
forty
acres
,
is
a
mile
and
a
*NL*
half
beyond
Fair
Haven
.
This
is
my
lake
country
.
These
,
with
Concord
*NL*
River
,
are
my
water
privileges
;
and
night
and
day
,
year
in
year
out
,
*NL*
they
grind
such
grist
as
I
carry
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
wood-cutters
,
and
the
railroad
,
and
I
myself
have
profaned
*NL*
Walden
,
perhaps
the
most
attractive
,
if
not
the
most
beautiful
,
of
all
*NL*
our
lakes
,
the
gem
of
the
woods
,
is
White
Pond
;
--
a
poor
name
from
its
*NL*
commonness
,
whether
derived
from
the
remarkable
purity
of
its
waters
or
*NL*
the
color
of
its
sands
.
In
these
as
in
other
respects
,
however
,
it
is
*NL*
a
lesser
twin
of
Walden
.
They
are
so
much
alike
that
you
would
say
they
*NL*
must
be
connected
under
ground
.
It
has
the
same
stony
shore
,
and
its
*NL*
waters
are
of
the
same
hue
.
As
at
Walden
,
in
sultry
dog-day
weather
,
*NL*
looking
down
through
the
woods
on
some
of
its
bays
which
are
not
so
deep
*NL*
but
that
the
reflection
from
the
bottom
tinges
them
,
its
waters
are
of
*NL*
a
misty
bluish-green
or
glaucous
color
.
Many
years
since
I
used
to
go
*NL*
there
to
collect
the
sand
by
cartloads
,
to
make
sandpaper
with
,
and
I
*NL*
have
continued
to
visit
it
ever
since
.
One
who
frequents
it
proposes
to
*NL*
call
it
Virid
Lake
.
Perhaps
it
might
be
called
Yellow
Pine
Lake
,
from
*NL*
the
following
circumstance
.
About
fifteen
years
ago
you
could
see
the
*NL*
top
of
a
pitch
pine
,
of
the
kind
called
yellow
pine
hereabouts
,
though
*NL*
it
is
not
a
distinct
species
,
projecting
above
the
surface
in
deep
*NL*
water
,
many
rods
from
the
shore
.
It
was
even
supposed
by
some
that
the
*NL*
pond
had
sunk
,
and
this
was
one
of
the
primitive
forest
that
formerly
*NL*
stood
there
.
I
find
that
even
so
long
ago
as
1792
,
in
a
``
Topographical
*NL*
Description
of
the
Town
of
Concord
,
''
by
one
of
its
citizens
,
in
the
*NL*
Collections
of
the
Massachusetts
Historical
Society
,
the
author
,
after
*NL*
speaking
of
Walden
and
White
Ponds
,
adds
,
``
In
the
middle
of
the
latter
*NL*
may
be
seen
,
when
the
water
is
very
low
,
a
tree
which
appears
as
if
it
*NL*
grew
in
the
place
where
it
now
stands
,
although
the
roots
are
fifty
feet
*NL*
below
the
surface
of
the
water
;
the
top
of
this
tree
is
broken
off
,
and
*NL*
at
that
place
measures
fourteen
inches
in
diameter
.
''
In
the
spring
of
*NL*
'49
I
talked
with
the
man
who
lives
nearest
the
pond
in
Sudbury
,
who
*NL*
told
me
that
it
was
he
who
got
out
this
tree
ten
or
fifteen
years
*NL*
before
.
As
near
as
he
could
remember
,
it
stood
twelve
or
fifteen
rods
*NL*
from
the
shore
,
where
the
water
was
thirty
or
forty
feet
deep
.
It
was
*NL*
in
the
winter
,
and
he
had
been
getting
out
ice
in
the
forenoon
,
and
had
*NL*
resolved
that
in
the
afternoon
,
with
the
aid
of
his
neighbors
,
he
would
*NL*
take
out
the
old
yellow
pine
.
He
sawed
a
channel
in
the
ice
toward
the
*NL*
shore
,
and
hauled
it
over
and
along
and
out
on
to
the
ice
with
oxen
;
*NL*
but
,
before
he
had
gone
far
in
his
work
,
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
*NL*
it
was
wrong
end
upward
,
with
the
stumps
of
the
branches
pointing
down
,
*NL*
and
the
small
end
firmly
fastened
in
the
sandy
bottom
.
It
was
about
*NL*
a
foot
in
diameter
at
the
big
end
,
and
he
had
expected
to
get
a
good
*NL*
saw-log
,
but
it
was
so
rotten
as
to
be
fit
only
for
fuel
,
if
for
that
.
*NL*
He
had
some
of
it
in
his
shed
then
.
There
were
marks
of
an
axe
and
of
*NL*
woodpeckers
on
the
butt
.
He
thought
that
it
might
have
been
a
dead
tree
*NL*
on
the
shore
,
but
was
finally
blown
over
into
the
pond
,
and
after
the
*NL*
top
had
become
water-logged
,
while
the
butt-end
was
still
dry
and
light
,
*NL*
had
drifted
out
and
sunk
wrong
end
up
.
His
father
,
eighty
years
old
,
*NL*
could
not
remember
when
it
was
not
there
.
Several
pretty
large
logs
may
*NL*
still
be
seen
lying
on
the
bottom
,
where
,
owing
to
the
undulation
of
the
*NL*
surface
,
they
look
like
huge
water
snakes
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pond
has
rarely
been
profaned
by
a
boat
,
for
there
is
little
in
it
*NL*
to
tempt
a
fisherman
.
Instead
of
the
white
lily
,
which
requires
mud
,
or
*NL*
the
common
sweet
flag
,
the
blue
flag
-LRB-
_
Iris
versicolor
_
-RRB-
grows
thinly
in
*NL*
the
pure
water
,
rising
from
the
stony
bottom
all
around
the
shore
,
where
*NL*
it
is
visited
by
hummingbirds
in
June
;
and
the
color
both
of
its
bluish
*NL*
blades
and
its
flowers
and
especially
their
reflections
,
is
in
singular
*NL*
harmony
with
the
glaucous
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
White
Pond
and
Walden
are
great
crystals
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
*NL*
Lakes
of
Light
.
If
they
were
permanently
congealed
,
and
small
enough
*NL*
to
be
clutched
,
they
would
,
perchance
,
be
carried
off
by
slaves
,
like
*NL*
precious
stones
,
to
adorn
the
heads
of
emperors
;
but
being
liquid
,
and
*NL*
ample
,
and
secured
to
us
and
our
successors
forever
,
we
disregard
them
,
*NL*
and
run
after
the
diamond
of
Kohinoor
.
They
are
too
pure
to
have
a
*NL*
market
value
;
they
contain
no
muck
.
How
much
more
beautiful
than
our
*NL*
lives
,
how
much
more
transparent
than
our
characters
,
are
they
!
We
*NL*
never
learned
meanness
of
them
.
How
much
fairer
than
the
pool
before
the
*NL*
farmer
's
door
,
in
which
his
ducks
swim
!
Hither
the
clean
wild
ducks
come
.
*NL*
Nature
has
no
human
inhabitant
who
appreciates
her
.
The
birds
with
their
*NL*
plumage
and
their
notes
are
in
harmony
with
the
flowers
,
but
what
*NL*
youth
or
maiden
conspires
with
the
wild
luxuriant
beauty
of
Nature
?
She
*NL*
flourishes
most
alone
,
far
from
the
towns
where
they
reside
.
Talk
of
*NL*
heaven
!
ye
disgrace
earth
.

Sometimes
I
rambled
to
pine
groves
,
standing
like
temples
,
or
like
*NL*
fleets
at
sea
,
full-rigged
,
with
wavy
boughs
,
and
rippling
with
light
,
*NL*
so
soft
and
green
and
shady
that
the
Druids
would
have
forsaken
their
*NL*
oaks
to
worship
in
them
;
or
to
the
cedar
wood
beyond
Flint
's
Pond
,
where
*NL*
the
trees
,
covered
with
hoary
blue
berries
,
spiring
higher
and
higher
,
*NL*
are
fit
to
stand
before
Valhalla
,
and
the
creeping
juniper
covers
the
*NL*
ground
with
wreaths
full
of
fruit
;
or
to
swamps
where
the
usnea
lichen
*NL*
hangs
in
festoons
from
the
white
spruce
trees
,
and
toadstools
,
round
*NL*
tables
of
the
swamp
gods
,
cover
the
ground
,
and
more
beautiful
fungi
*NL*
adorn
the
stumps
,
like
butterflies
or
shells
,
vegetable
winkles
;
where
*NL*
the
swamp-pink
and
dogwood
grow
,
the
red
alderberry
glows
like
eyes
of
*NL*
imps
,
the
waxwork
grooves
and
crushes
the
hardest
woods
in
its
folds
,
*NL*
and
the
wild
holly
berries
make
the
beholder
forget
his
home
with
their
*NL*
beauty
,
and
he
is
dazzled
and
tempted
by
nameless
other
wild
forbidden
*NL*
fruits
,
too
fair
for
mortal
taste
.
Instead
of
calling
on
some
scholar
,
*NL*
I
paid
many
a
visit
to
particular
trees
,
of
kinds
which
are
rare
in
this
*NL*
neighborhood
,
standing
far
away
in
the
middle
of
some
pasture
,
or
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
a
wood
or
swamp
,
or
on
a
hilltop
;
such
as
the
black
birch
,
of
*NL*
which
we
have
some
handsome
specimens
two
feet
in
diameter
;
its
cousin
,
*NL*
the
yellow
birch
,
with
its
loose
golden
vest
,
perfumed
like
the
first
;
*NL*
the
beech
,
which
has
so
neat
a
bole
and
beautifully
lichen-painted
,
*NL*
perfect
in
all
its
details
,
of
which
,
excepting
scattered
specimens
,
I
*NL*
know
but
one
small
grove
of
sizable
trees
left
in
the
township
,
supposed
*NL*
by
some
to
have
been
planted
by
the
pigeons
that
were
once
baited
with
*NL*
beechnuts
near
by
;
it
is
worth
the
while
to
see
the
silver
grain
*NL*
sparkle
when
you
split
this
wood
;
the
bass
;
the
hornbeam
;
the
_
Celtis
*NL*
occidentalis
_
,
or
false
elm
,
of
which
we
have
but
one
well-grown
;
some
*NL*
taller
mast
of
a
pine
,
a
shingle
tree
,
or
a
more
perfect
hemlock
than
*NL*
usual
,
standing
like
a
pagoda
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
;
and
many
*NL*
others
I
could
mention
.
These
were
the
shrines
I
visited
both
summer
and
*NL*
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
it
chanced
that
I
stood
in
the
very
abutment
of
a
rainbow
's
arch
,
*NL*
which
filled
the
lower
stratum
of
the
atmosphere
,
tinging
the
grass
and
*NL*
leaves
around
,
and
dazzling
me
as
if
I
looked
through
colored
crystal
.
*NL*
It
was
a
lake
of
rainbow
light
,
in
which
,
for
a
short
while
,
I
lived
*NL*
like
a
dolphin
.
If
it
had
lasted
longer
it
might
have
tinged
my
*NL*
employments
and
life
.
As
I
walked
on
the
railroad
causeway
,
I
used
*NL*
to
wonder
at
the
halo
of
light
around
my
shadow
,
and
would
fain
fancy
*NL*
myself
one
of
the
elect
.
One
who
visited
me
declared
that
the
shadows
*NL*
of
some
Irishmen
before
him
had
no
halo
about
them
,
that
it
was
only
*NL*
natives
that
were
so
distinguished
.
Benvenuto
Cellini
tells
us
in
his
*NL*
memoirs
,
that
,
after
a
certain
terrible
dream
or
vision
which
he
had
*NL*
during
his
confinement
in
the
castle
of
St.
Angelo
a
resplendent
light
*NL*
appeared
over
the
shadow
of
his
head
at
morning
and
evening
,
whether
*NL*
he
was
in
Italy
or
France
,
and
it
was
particularly
conspicuous
when
the
*NL*
grass
was
moist
with
dew
.
This
was
probably
the
same
phenomenon
to
which
*NL*
I
have
referred
,
which
is
especially
observed
in
the
morning
,
but
also
*NL*
at
other
times
,
and
even
by
moonlight
.
Though
a
constant
one
,
it
is
*NL*
not
commonly
noticed
,
and
,
in
the
case
of
an
excitable
imagination
like
*NL*
Cellini
's
,
it
would
be
basis
enough
for
superstition
.
Beside
,
he
tells
*NL*
us
that
he
showed
it
to
very
few
.
But
are
they
not
indeed
distinguished
*NL*
who
are
conscious
that
they
are
regarded
at
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
out
one
afternoon
to
go
a-fishing
to
Fair
Haven
,
through
the
*NL*
woods
,
to
eke
out
my
scanty
fare
of
vegetables
.
My
way
led
through
*NL*
Pleasant
Meadow
,
an
adjunct
of
the
Baker
Farm
,
that
retreat
of
which
a
*NL*
poet
has
since
sung
,
beginning
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
entry
is
a
pleasant
field
,
*NL*
Which
some
mossy
fruit
trees
yield
*NL*
Partly
to
a
ruddy
brook
,
*NL*
By
gliding
musquash
undertook
,
*NL*
And
mercurial
trout
,
*NL*
Darting
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
of
living
there
before
I
went
to
Walden
.
I
``
hooked
''
the
*NL*
apples
,
leaped
the
brook
,
and
scared
the
musquash
and
the
trout
.
It
*NL*
was
one
of
those
afternoons
which
seem
indefinitely
long
before
one
,
*NL*
in
which
many
events
may
happen
,
a
large
portion
of
our
natural
life
,
*NL*
though
it
was
already
half
spent
when
I
started
.
By
the
way
there
came
*NL*
up
a
shower
,
which
compelled
me
to
stand
half
an
hour
under
a
pine
,
*NL*
piling
boughs
over
my
head
,
and
wearing
my
handkerchief
for
a
shed
;
and
*NL*
when
at
length
I
had
made
one
cast
over
the
pickerelweed
,
standing
up
*NL*
to
my
middle
in
water
,
I
found
myself
suddenly
in
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
,
*NL*
and
the
thunder
began
to
rumble
with
such
emphasis
that
I
could
do
no
*NL*
more
than
listen
to
it
.
The
gods
must
be
proud
,
thought
I
,
with
such
*NL*
forked
flashes
to
rout
a
poor
unarmed
fisherman
.
So
I
made
haste
for
*NL*
shelter
to
the
nearest
hut
,
which
stood
half
a
mile
from
any
road
,
but
*NL*
so
much
the
nearer
to
the
pond
,
and
had
long
been
uninhabited
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
a
poet
builded
,
*NL*
In
the
completed
years
,
*NL*
For
behold
a
trivial
cabin
*NL*
That
to
destruction
steers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Muse
fables
.
But
therein
,
as
I
found
,
dwelt
now
John
Field
,
an
*NL*
Irishman
,
and
his
wife
,
and
several
children
,
from
the
broad-faced
boy
*NL*
who
assisted
his
father
at
his
work
,
and
now
came
running
by
his
*NL*
side
from
the
bog
to
escape
the
rain
,
to
the
wrinkled
,
sibyl-like
,
*NL*
cone-headed
infant
that
sat
upon
its
father
's
knee
as
in
the
palaces
*NL*
of
nobles
,
and
looked
out
from
its
home
in
the
midst
of
wet
and
hunger
*NL*
inquisitively
upon
the
stranger
,
with
the
privilege
of
infancy
,
not
*NL*
knowing
but
it
was
the
last
of
a
noble
line
,
and
the
hope
and
cynosure
*NL*
of
the
world
,
instead
of
John
Field
's
poor
starveling
brat
.
There
we
sat
*NL*
together
under
that
part
of
the
roof
which
leaked
the
least
,
while
it
*NL*
showered
and
thundered
without
.
I
had
sat
there
many
times
of
old
*NL*
before
the
ship
was
built
that
floated
his
family
to
America
.
An
honest
,
*NL*
hard-working
,
but
shiftless
man
plainly
was
John
Field
;
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
she
too
was
brave
to
cook
so
many
successive
dinners
in
the
recesses
of
*NL*
that
lofty
stove
;
with
round
greasy
face
and
bare
breast
,
still
thinking
*NL*
to
improve
her
condition
one
day
;
with
the
never
absent
mop
in
one
hand
,
*NL*
and
yet
no
effects
of
it
visible
anywhere
.
The
chickens
,
which
had
also
*NL*
taken
shelter
here
from
the
rain
,
stalked
about
the
room
like
members
*NL*
of
the
family
,
too
humanized
,
methought
,
to
roast
well
.
They
stood
and
*NL*
looked
in
my
eye
or
pecked
at
my
shoe
significantly
.
Meanwhile
my
*NL*
host
told
me
his
story
,
how
hard
he
worked
``
bogging
''
for
a
neighboring
*NL*
farmer
,
turning
up
a
meadow
with
a
spade
or
bog
hoe
at
the
rate
of
ten
*NL*
dollars
an
acre
and
the
use
of
the
land
with
manure
for
one
year
,
and
*NL*
his
little
broad-faced
son
worked
cheerfully
at
his
father
's
side
the
*NL*
while
,
not
knowing
how
poor
a
bargain
the
latter
had
made
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
help
him
with
my
experience
,
telling
him
that
he
was
one
of
my
nearest
*NL*
neighbors
,
and
that
I
too
,
who
came
a-fishing
here
,
and
looked
like
a
*NL*
loafer
,
was
getting
my
living
like
himself
;
that
I
lived
in
a
tight
,
*NL*
light
,
and
clean
house
,
which
hardly
cost
more
than
the
annual
rent
of
*NL*
such
a
ruin
as
his
commonly
amounts
to
;
and
how
,
if
he
chose
,
he
might
*NL*
in
a
month
or
two
build
himself
a
palace
of
his
own
;
that
I
did
not
use
*NL*
tea
,
nor
coffee
,
nor
butter
,
nor
milk
,
nor
fresh
meat
,
and
so
did
not
*NL*
have
to
work
to
get
them
;
again
,
as
I
did
not
work
hard
,
I
did
not
have
*NL*
to
eat
hard
,
and
it
cost
me
but
a
trifle
for
my
food
;
but
as
he
began
*NL*
with
tea
,
and
coffee
,
and
butter
,
and
milk
,
and
beef
,
he
had
to
work
*NL*
hard
to
pay
for
them
,
and
when
he
had
worked
hard
he
had
to
eat
hard
*NL*
again
to
repair
the
waste
of
his
system
--
and
so
it
was
as
broad
as
*NL*
it
was
long
,
indeed
it
was
broader
than
it
was
long
,
for
he
was
*NL*
discontented
and
wasted
his
life
into
the
bargain
;
and
yet
he
had
rated
*NL*
it
as
a
gain
in
coming
to
America
,
that
here
you
could
get
tea
,
and
*NL*
coffee
,
and
meat
every
day
.
But
the
only
true
America
is
that
country
*NL*
where
you
are
at
liberty
to
pursue
such
a
mode
of
life
as
may
enable
you
*NL*
to
do
without
these
,
and
where
the
state
does
not
endeavor
to
compel
*NL*
you
to
sustain
the
slavery
and
war
and
other
superfluous
expenses
*NL*
which
directly
or
indirectly
result
from
the
use
of
such
things
.
For
I
*NL*
purposely
talked
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
philosopher
,
or
desired
to
be
*NL*
one
.
I
should
be
glad
if
all
the
meadows
on
the
earth
were
left
in
a
*NL*
wild
state
,
if
that
were
the
consequence
of
men
's
beginning
to
redeem
*NL*
themselves
.
A
man
will
not
need
to
study
history
to
find
out
what
is
*NL*
best
for
his
own
culture
.
But
alas
!
the
culture
of
an
Irishman
is
an
*NL*
enterprise
to
be
undertaken
with
a
sort
of
moral
bog
hoe
.
I
told
him
,
*NL*
that
as
he
worked
so
hard
at
bogging
,
he
required
thick
boots
and
stout
*NL*
clothing
,
which
yet
were
soon
soiled
and
worn
out
,
but
I
wore
light
*NL*
shoes
and
thin
clothing
,
which
cost
not
half
so
much
,
though
he
might
*NL*
think
that
I
was
dressed
like
a
gentleman
-LRB-
which
,
however
,
was
not
the
*NL*
case
-RRB-
,
and
in
an
hour
or
two
,
without
labor
,
but
as
a
recreation
,
I
*NL*
could
,
if
I
wished
,
catch
as
many
fish
as
I
should
want
for
two
days
,
or
*NL*
earn
enough
money
to
support
me
a
week
.
If
he
and
his
family
would
*NL*
live
simply
,
they
might
all
go
a-huckleberrying
in
the
summer
for
their
*NL*
amusement
.
John
heaved
a
sigh
at
this
,
and
his
wife
stared
with
arms
*NL*
a-kimbo
,
and
both
appeared
to
be
wondering
if
they
had
capital
enough
to
*NL*
begin
such
a
course
with
,
or
arithmetic
enough
to
carry
it
through
.
It
*NL*
was
sailing
by
dead
reckoning
to
them
,
and
they
saw
not
clearly
how
to
*NL*
make
their
port
so
;
therefore
I
suppose
they
still
take
life
bravely
,
*NL*
after
their
fashion
,
face
to
face
,
giving
it
tooth
and
nail
,
not
having
*NL*
skill
to
split
its
massive
columns
with
any
fine
entering
wedge
,
and
*NL*
rout
it
in
detail
;
--
thinking
to
deal
with
it
roughly
,
as
one
*NL*
should
handle
a
thistle
.
But
they
fight
at
an
overwhelming
*NL*
disadvantage
--
living
,
John
Field
,
alas
!
without
arithmetic
,
and
failing
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
fish
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Oh
yes
,
I
catch
a
mess
now
and
then
when
*NL*
I
am
lying
by
;
good
perch
I
catch
.
''
--
``
What
's
your
bait
?
''
``
I
catch
shiners
*NL*
with
fishworms
,
and
bait
the
perch
with
them
.
''
``
You
'd
better
go
now
,
*NL*
John
,
''
said
his
wife
,
with
glistening
and
hopeful
face
;
but
John
*NL*
demurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shower
was
now
over
,
and
a
rainbow
above
the
eastern
woods
promised
*NL*
a
fair
evening
;
so
I
took
my
departure
.
When
I
had
got
without
I
asked
*NL*
for
a
drink
,
hoping
to
get
a
sight
of
the
well
bottom
,
to
complete
my
*NL*
survey
of
the
premises
;
but
there
,
alas
!
are
shallows
and
quicksands
,
*NL*
and
rope
broken
withal
,
and
bucket
irrecoverable
.
Meanwhile
the
right
*NL*
culinary
vessel
was
selected
,
water
was
seemingly
distilled
,
and
after
*NL*
consultation
and
long
delay
passed
out
to
the
thirsty
one
--
not
yet
*NL*
suffered
to
cool
,
not
yet
to
settle
.
Such
gruel
sustains
life
here
,
I
*NL*
thought
;
so
,
shutting
my
eyes
,
and
excluding
the
motes
by
a
skilfully
*NL*
directed
undercurrent
,
I
drank
to
genuine
hospitality
the
heartiest
*NL*
draught
I
could
.
I
am
not
squeamish
in
such
cases
when
manners
are
*NL*
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
leaving
the
Irishman
's
roof
after
the
rain
,
bending
my
steps
*NL*
again
to
the
pond
,
my
haste
to
catch
pickerel
,
wading
in
retired
*NL*
meadows
,
in
sloughs
and
bog-holes
,
in
forlorn
and
savage
places
,
*NL*
appeared
for
an
instant
trivial
to
me
who
had
been
sent
to
school
and
*NL*
college
;
but
as
I
ran
down
the
hill
toward
the
reddening
west
,
with
the
*NL*
rainbow
over
my
shoulder
,
and
some
faint
tinkling
sounds
borne
to
my
ear
*NL*
through
the
cleansed
air
,
from
I
know
not
what
quarter
,
my
Good
Genius
*NL*
seemed
to
say
--
Go
fish
and
hunt
far
and
wide
day
by
day
--
farther
and
*NL*
wider
--
and
rest
thee
by
many
brooks
and
hearth-sides
without
misgiving
.
*NL*
Remember
thy
Creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
.
Rise
free
from
care
*NL*
before
the
dawn
,
and
seek
adventures
.
Let
the
noon
find
thee
by
other
*NL*
lakes
,
and
the
night
overtake
thee
everywhere
at
home
.
There
are
no
*NL*
larger
fields
than
these
,
no
worthier
games
than
may
here
be
played
.
*NL*
Grow
wild
according
to
thy
nature
,
like
these
sedges
and
brakes
,
which
*NL*
will
never
become
English
bay
.
Let
the
thunder
rumble
;
what
if
it
*NL*
threaten
ruin
to
farmers
'
crops
?
That
is
not
its
errand
to
thee
.
Take
*NL*
shelter
under
the
cloud
,
while
they
flee
to
carts
and
sheds
.
Let
not
*NL*
to
get
a
living
be
thy
trade
,
but
thy
sport
.
Enjoy
the
land
,
but
own
it
*NL*
not
.
Through
want
of
enterprise
and
faith
men
are
where
they
are
,
buying
*NL*
and
selling
,
and
spending
their
lives
like
serfs
.

Before
I
had
reached
the
pond
some
fresh
impulse
had
brought
out
John
*NL*
Field
,
with
altered
mind
,
letting
go
``
bogging
''
ere
this
sunset
.
But
he
,
*NL*
poor
man
,
disturbed
only
a
couple
of
fins
while
I
was
catching
a
fair
*NL*
string
,
and
he
said
it
was
his
luck
;
but
when
we
changed
seats
in
the
*NL*
boat
luck
changed
seats
too
.
Poor
John
Field
!
--
I
trust
he
does
not
read
*NL*
this
,
unless
he
will
improve
by
it
--
thinking
to
live
by
some
derivative
*NL*
old-country
mode
in
this
primitive
new
country
--
to
catch
perch
with
*NL*
shiners
.
It
is
good
bait
sometimes
,
I
allow
.
With
his
horizon
all
*NL*
his
own
,
yet
he
a
poor
man
,
born
to
be
poor
,
with
his
inherited
Irish
*NL*
poverty
or
poor
life
,
his
Adam
's
grandmother
and
boggy
ways
,
not
to
*NL*
rise
in
this
world
,
he
nor
his
posterity
,
till
their
wading
webbed
*NL*
bog-trotting

As
I
came
home
through
the
woods
with
my
string
of
fish
,
trailing
*NL*
my
pole
,
it
being
now
quite
dark
,
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
woodchuck
*NL*
stealing
across
my
path
,
and
felt
a
strange
thrill
of
savage
delight
,
*NL*
and
was
strongly
tempted
to
seize
and
devour
him
raw
;
not
that
I
was
*NL*
hungry
then
,
except
for
that
wildness
which
he
represented
.
Once
or
*NL*
twice
,
however
,
while
I
lived
at
the
pond
,
I
found
myself
ranging
the
*NL*
woods
,
like
a
half-starved
hound
,
with
a
strange
abandonment
,
seeking
*NL*
some
kind
of
venison
which
I
might
devour
,
and
no
morsel
could
have
been
*NL*
too
savage
for
me
.
The
wildest
scenes
had
become
unaccountably
familiar
.
*NL*
I
found
in
myself
,
and
still
find
,
an
instinct
toward
a
higher
,
or
,
*NL*
as
it
is
named
,
spiritual
life
,
as
do
most
men
,
and
another
toward
a
*NL*
primitive
rank
and
savage
one
,
and
I
reverence
them
both
.
I
love
the
*NL*
wild
not
less
than
the
good
.
The
wildness
and
adventure
that
are
in
*NL*
fishing
still
recommended
it
to
me
.
I
like
sometimes
to
take
rank
hold
*NL*
on
life
and
spend
my
day
more
as
the
animals
do
.
Perhaps
I
have
owed
*NL*
to
this
employment
and
to
hunting
,
when
quite
young
,
my
closest
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Nature
.
They
early
introduce
us
to
and
detain
us
*NL*
in
scenery
with
which
otherwise
,
at
that
age
,
we
should
have
little
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Fishermen
,
hunters
,
woodchoppers
,
and
others
,
spending
*NL*
their
lives
in
the
fields
and
woods
,
in
a
peculiar
sense
a
part
of
*NL*
Nature
themselves
,
are
often
in
a
more
favorable
mood
for
observing
her
,
*NL*
in
the
intervals
of
their
pursuits
,
than
philosophers
or
poets
even
,
who
*NL*
approach
her
with
expectation
.
She
is
not
afraid
to
exhibit
herself
to
*NL*
them
.
The
traveller
on
the
prairie
is
naturally
a
hunter
,
on
the
head
*NL*
waters
of
the
Missouri
and
Columbia
a
trapper
,
and
at
the
Falls
of
*NL*
St.
Mary
a
fisherman
.
He
who
is
only
a
traveller
learns
things
at
*NL*
second-hand
and
by
the
halves
,
and
is
poor
authority
.
We
are
most
*NL*
interested
when
science
reports
what
those
men
already
know
practically
*NL*
or
instinctively
,
for
that
alone
is
a
true
_
humanity
_
,
or
account
of
human
*NL*
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
mistake
who
assert
that
the
Yankee
has
few
amusements
,
because
he
*NL*
has
not
so
many
public
holidays
,
and
men
and
boys
do
not
play
so
many
*NL*
games
as
they
do
in
England
,
for
here
the
more
primitive
but
solitary
*NL*
amusements
of
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
the
like
have
not
yet
given
place
*NL*
to
the
former
.
Almost
every
New
England
boy
among
my
contemporaries
*NL*
shouldered
a
fowling-piece
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
fourteen
;
and
his
*NL*
hunting
and
fishing
grounds
were
not
limited
,
like
the
preserves
of
an
*NL*
English
nobleman
,
but
were
more
boundless
even
than
those
of
a
savage
.
*NL*
No
wonder
,
then
,
that
he
did
not
oftener
stay
to
play
on
the
common
.
But
*NL*
already
a
change
is
taking
place
,
owing
,
not
to
an
increased
humanity
,
*NL*
but
to
an
increased
scarcity
of
game
,
for
perhaps
the
hunter
is
the
*NL*
greatest
friend
of
the
animals
hunted
,
not
excepting
the
Humane
Society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
when
at
the
pond
,
I
wished
sometimes
to
add
fish
to
my
fare
*NL*
for
variety
.
I
have
actually
fished
from
the
same
kind
of
necessity
that
*NL*
the
first
fishers
did
.
Whatever
humanity
I
might
conjure
up
against
it
*NL*
was
all
factitious
,
and
concerned
my
philosophy
more
than
my
feelings
.
*NL*
I
speak
of
fishing
only
now
,
for
I
had
long
felt
differently
about
*NL*
fowling
,
and
sold
my
gun
before
I
went
to
the
woods
.
Not
that
I
am
less
*NL*
humane
than
others
,
but
I
did
not
perceive
that
my
feelings
were
much
*NL*
affected
.
I
did
not
pity
the
fishes
nor
the
worms
.
This
was
habit
.
As
*NL*
for
fowling
,
during
the
last
years
that
I
carried
a
gun
my
excuse
was
*NL*
that
I
was
studying
ornithology
,
and
sought
only
new
or
rare
birds
.
But
*NL*
I
confess
that
I
am
now
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
a
finer
way
of
*NL*
studying
ornithology
than
this
.
It
requires
so
much
closer
attention
*NL*
to
the
habits
of
the
birds
,
that
,
if
for
that
reason
only
,
I
have
been
*NL*
willing
to
omit
the
gun
.
Yet
notwithstanding
the
objection
on
the
score
*NL*
of
humanity
,
I
am
compelled
to
doubt
if
equally
valuable
sports
are
*NL*
ever
substituted
for
these
;
and
when
some
of
my
friends
have
asked
me
*NL*
anxiously
about
their
boys
,
whether
they
should
let
them
hunt
,
I
have
*NL*
answered
,
yes
--
remembering
that
it
was
one
of
the
best
parts
of
my
*NL*
education
--
_
make
_
them
hunters
,
though
sportsmen
only
at
first
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
mighty
hunters
at
last
,
so
that
they
shall
not
find
game
large
*NL*
enough
for
them
in
this
or
any
vegetable
wilderness
--
hunters
as
well
as
*NL*
fishers
of
men
.
Thus
far
I
am
of
the
opinion
of
Chaucer
's
nun
,
who
*NL*
*NL*
``
yave
not
of
the
text
a
pulled
hen
*NL*
That
saith
that
hunters
ben
not
holy
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
period
in
the
history
of
the
individual
,
as
of
the
race
,
when
*NL*
the
hunters
are
the
``
best
men
,
''
as
the
Algonquins
called
them
.
We
can
not
*NL*
but
pity
the
boy
who
has
never
fired
a
gun
;
he
is
no
more
humane
,
while
*NL*
his
education
has
been
sadly
neglected
.
This
was
my
answer
with
respect
*NL*
to
those
youths
who
were
bent
on
this
pursuit
,
trusting
that
they
would
*NL*
soon
outgrow
it
.
No
humane
being
,
past
the
thoughtless
age
of
boyhood
,
*NL*
will
wantonly
murder
any
creature
which
holds
its
life
by
the
same
*NL*
tenure
that
he
does
.
The
hare
in
its
extremity
cries
like
a
child
.
*NL*
I
warn
you
,
mothers
,
that
my
sympathies
do
not
always
make
the
usual
*NL*
phil
-
_
anthropic
_
distinctions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
oftenest
the
young
man
's
introduction
to
the
forest
,
and
the
*NL*
most
original
part
of
himself
.
He
goes
thither
at
first
as
a
hunter
and
*NL*
fisher
,
until
at
last
,
if
he
has
the
seeds
of
a
better
life
in
him
,
he
*NL*
distinguishes
his
proper
objects
,
as
a
poet
or
naturalist
it
may
be
,
*NL*
and
leaves
the
gun
and
fish-pole
behind
.
The
mass
of
men
are
still
and
*NL*
always
young
in
this
respect
.
In
some
countries
a
hunting
parson
is
no
*NL*
uncommon
sight
.
Such
a
one
might
make
a
good
shepherd
's
dog
,
but
is
far
*NL*
from
being
the
Good
Shepherd
.
I
have
been
surprised
to
consider
that
the
*NL*
only
obvious
employment
,
except
wood-chopping
,
ice-cutting
,
or
the
like
*NL*
business
,
which
ever
to
my
knowledge
detained
at
Walden
Pond
for
a
whole
*NL*
half-day
any
of
my
fellow-citizens
,
whether
fathers
or
children
of
the
*NL*
town
,
with
just
one
exception
,
was
fishing
.
Commonly
they
did
not
think
*NL*
that
they
were
lucky
,
or
well
paid
for
their
time
,
unless
they
got
a
*NL*
long
string
of
fish
,
though
they
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
the
pond
*NL*
all
the
while
.
They
might
go
there
a
thousand
times
before
the
sediment
*NL*
of
fishing
would
sink
to
the
bottom
and
leave
their
purpose
pure
;
but
*NL*
no
doubt
such
a
clarifying
process
would
be
going
on
all
the
while
.
*NL*
The
Governor
and
his
Council
faintly
remember
the
pond
,
for
they
went
*NL*
a-fishing
there
when
they
were
boys
;
but
now
they
are
too
old
and
*NL*
dignified
to
go
a-fishing
,
and
so
they
know
it
no
more
forever
.
Yet
even
*NL*
they
expect
to
go
to
heaven
at
last
.
If
the
legislature
regards
it
,
it
*NL*
is
chiefly
to
regulate
the
number
of
hooks
to
be
used
there
;
but
they
*NL*
know
nothing
about
the
hook
of
hooks
with
which
to
angle
for
the
pond
*NL*
itself
,
impaling
the
legislature
for
a
bait
.
Thus
,
even
in
civilized
*NL*
communities
,
the
embryo
man
passes
through
the
hunter
stage
of
*NL*
development
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
found
repeatedly
,
of
late
years
,
that
I
can
not
fish
without
*NL*
falling
a
little
in
self-respect
.
I
have
tried
it
again
and
again
.
I
*NL*
have
skill
at
it
,
and
,
like
many
of
my
fellows
,
a
certain
instinct
for
*NL*
it
,
which
revives
from
time
to
time
,
but
always
when
I
have
done
I
feel
*NL*
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
I
had
not
fished
.
I
think
that
I
do
*NL*
not
mistake
.
It
is
a
faint
intimation
,
yet
so
are
the
first
streaks
of
*NL*
morning
.
There
is
unquestionably
this
instinct
in
me
which
belongs
to
*NL*
the
lower
orders
of
creation
;
yet
with
every
year
I
am
less
a
fisherman
,
*NL*
though
without
more
humanity
or
even
wisdom
;
at
present
I
am
no
*NL*
fisherman
at
all
.
But
I
see
that
if
I
were
to
live
in
a
wilderness
*NL*
I
should
again
be
tempted
to
become
a
fisher
and
hunter
in
earnest
.
*NL*
Beside
,
there
is
something
essentially
unclean
about
this
diet
and
all
*NL*
flesh
,
and
I
began
to
see
where
housework
commences
,
and
whence
the
*NL*
endeavor
,
which
costs
so
much
,
to
wear
a
tidy
and
respectable
appearance
*NL*
each
day
,
to
keep
the
house
sweet
and
free
from
all
ill
odors
and
*NL*
sights
.
Having
been
my
own
butcher
and
scullion
and
cook
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
gentleman
for
whom
the
dishes
were
served
up
,
I
can
speak
from
an
*NL*
unusually
complete
experience
.
The
practical
objection
to
animal
food
in
*NL*
my
case
was
its
uncleanness
;
and
besides
,
when
I
had
caught
and
*NL*
cleaned
and
cooked
and
eaten
my
fish
,
they
seemed
not
to
have
fed
me
*NL*
essentially
.
It
was
insignificant
and
unnecessary
,
and
cost
more
than
it
*NL*
came
to
.
A
little
bread
or
a
few
potatoes
would
have
done
as
well
,
with
*NL*
less
trouble
and
filth
.
Like
many
of
my
contemporaries
,
I
had
rarely
*NL*
for
many
years
used
animal
food
,
or
tea
,
or
coffee
,
etc.
;
not
so
much
*NL*
because
of
any
ill
effects
which
I
had
traced
to
them
,
as
because
they
*NL*
were
not
agreeable
to
my
imagination
.
The
repugnance
to
animal
food
*NL*
is
not
the
effect
of
experience
,
but
is
an
instinct
.
It
appeared
more
*NL*
beautiful
to
live
low
and
fare
hard
in
many
respects
;
and
though
I
never
*NL*
did
so
,
I
went
far
enough
to
please
my
imagination
.
I
believe
that
every
*NL*
man
who
has
ever
been
earnest
to
preserve
his
higher
or
poetic
faculties
*NL*
in
the
best
condition
has
been
particularly
inclined
to
abstain
from
*NL*
animal
food
,
and
from
much
food
of
any
kind
.
It
is
a
significant
fact
,
*NL*
stated
by
entomologists
--
I
find
it
in
Kirby
and
Spence
--
that
``
some
*NL*
insects
in
their
perfect
state
,
though
furnished
with
organs
of
feeding
,
*NL*
make
no
use
of
them
''
;
and
they
lay
it
down
as
``
a
general
rule
,
that
*NL*
almost
all
insects
in
this
state
eat
much
less
than
in
that
of
larvA
|
.
*NL*
The
voracious
caterpillar
when
transformed
into
a
butterfly
...
and
the
*NL*
gluttonous
maggot
when
become
a
fly
''
content
themselves
with
a
drop
or
*NL*
two
of
honey
or
some
other
sweet
liquid
.
The
abdomen
under
the
wings
*NL*
of
the
butterfly
still
represents
the
larva
.
This
is
the
tidbit
which
*NL*
tempts
his
insectivorous
fate
.
The
gross
feeder
is
a
man
in
the
larva
*NL*
state
;
and
there
are
whole
nations
in
that
condition
,
nations
without
*NL*
fancy
or
imagination
,
whose
vast
abdomens
betray
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
hard
to
provide
and
cook
so
simple
and
clean
a
diet
as
will
not
*NL*
offend
the
imagination
;
but
this
,
I
think
,
is
to
be
fed
when
we
feed
the
*NL*
body
;
they
should
both
sit
down
at
the
same
table
.
Yet
perhaps
this
may
*NL*
be
done
.
The
fruits
eaten
temperately
need
not
make
us
ashamed
of
*NL*
our
appetites
,
nor
interrupt
the
worthiest
pursuits
.
But
put
an
extra
*NL*
condiment
into
your
dish
,
and
it
will
poison
you
.
It
is
not
worth
the
*NL*
while
to
live
by
rich
cookery
.
Most
men
would
feel
shame
if
caught
*NL*
preparing
with
their
own
hands
precisely
such
a
dinner
,
whether
of
*NL*
animal
or
vegetable
food
,
as
is
every
day
prepared
for
them
by
others
.
*NL*
Yet
till
this
is
otherwise
we
are
not
civilized
,
and
,
if
gentlemen
and
*NL*
ladies
,
are
not
true
men
and
women
.
This
certainly
suggests
what
change
*NL*
is
to
be
made
.
It
may
be
vain
to
ask
why
the
imagination
will
not
be
*NL*
reconciled
to
flesh
and
fat
.
I
am
satisfied
that
it
is
not
.
Is
it
not
a
*NL*
reproach
that
man
is
a
carnivorous
animal
?
True
,
he
can
and
does
live
,
*NL*
in
a
great
measure
,
by
preying
on
other
animals
;
but
this
is
a
miserable
*NL*
way
--
as
any
one
who
will
go
to
snaring
rabbits
,
or
slaughtering
lambs
,
*NL*
may
learn
--
and
he
will
be
regarded
as
a
benefactor
of
his
race
who
shall
*NL*
teach
man
to
confine
himself
to
a
more
innocent
and
wholesome
diet
.
*NL*
Whatever
my
own
practice
may
be
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
part
of
*NL*
the
destiny
of
the
human
race
,
in
its
gradual
improvement
,
to
leave
off
*NL*
eating
animals
,
as
surely
as
the
savage
tribes
have
left
off
eating
each
*NL*
other
when
they
came
in
contact
with
the
more
civilized
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
listens
to
the
faintest
but
constant
suggestions
of
his
genius
,
*NL*
which
are
certainly
true
,
he
sees
not
to
what
extremes
,
or
even
*NL*
insanity
,
it
may
lead
him
;
and
yet
that
way
,
as
he
grows
more
resolute
*NL*
and
faithful
,
his
road
lies
.
The
faintest
assured
objection
which
one
*NL*
healthy
man
feels
will
at
length
prevail
over
the
arguments
and
customs
*NL*
of
mankind
.
No
man
ever
followed
his
genius
till
it
misled
him
.
Though
*NL*
the
result
were
bodily
weakness
,
yet
perhaps
no
one
can
say
that
the
*NL*
consequences
were
to
be
regretted
,
for
these
were
a
life
in
conformity
*NL*
to
higher
principles
.
If
the
day
and
the
night
are
such
that
you
greet
*NL*
them
with
joy
,
and
life
emits
a
fragrance
like
flowers
and
sweet-scented
*NL*
herbs
,
is
more
elastic
,
more
starry
,
more
immortal
--
that
is
your
*NL*
success
.
All
nature
is
your
congratulation
,
and
you
have
cause
*NL*
momentarily
to
bless
yourself
.
The
greatest
gains
and
values
are
*NL*
farthest
from
being
appreciated
.
We
easily
come
to
doubt
if
they
exist
.
*NL*
We
soon
forget
them
.
They
are
the
highest
reality
.
Perhaps
the
facts
*NL*
most
astounding
and
most
real
are
never
communicated
by
man
to
man
.
*NL*
The
true
harvest
of
my
daily
life
is
somewhat
as
intangible
and
*NL*
indescribable
as
the
tints
of
morning
or
evening
.
It
is
a
little
*NL*
star-dust
caught
,
a
segment
of
the
rainbow
which
I
have
clutched
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
for
my
part
,
I
was
never
unusually
squeamish
;
I
could
sometimes
eat
*NL*
a
fried
rat
with
a
good
relish
,
if
it
were
necessary
.
I
am
glad
to
have
*NL*
drunk
water
so
long
,
for
the
same
reason
that
I
prefer
the
natural
sky
*NL*
to
an
opium-eater
's
heaven
.
I
would
fain
keep
sober
always
;
and
there
*NL*
are
infinite
degrees
of
drunkenness
.
I
believe
that
water
is
the
only
*NL*
drink
for
a
wise
man
;
wine
is
not
so
noble
a
liquor
;
and
think
of
*NL*
dashing
the
hopes
of
a
morning
with
a
cup
of
warm
coffee
,
or
of
an
*NL*
evening
with
a
dish
of
tea
!
Ah
,
how
low
I
fall
when
I
am
tempted
by
*NL*
them
!
Even
music
may
be
intoxicating
.
Such
apparently
slight
causes
*NL*
destroyed
Greece
and
Rome
,
and
will
destroy
England
and
America
.
Of
all
*NL*
ebriosity
,
who
does
not
prefer
to
be
intoxicated
by
the
air
he
breathes
?
*NL*
I
have
found
it
to
be
the
most
serious
objection
to
coarse
labors
long
*NL*
continued
,
that
they
compelled
me
to
eat
and
drink
coarsely
also
.
But
*NL*
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
find
myself
at
present
somewhat
less
particular
in
*NL*
these
respects
.
I
carry
less
religion
to
the
table
,
ask
no
blessing
;
not
*NL*
because
I
am
wiser
than
I
was
,
but
,
I
am
obliged
to
confess
,
because
,
*NL*
however
much
it
is
to
be
regretted
,
with
years
I
have
grown
more
coarse
*NL*
and
indifferent
.
Perhaps
these
questions
are
entertained
only
in
youth
,
*NL*
as
most
believe
of
poetry
.
My
practice
is
``
nowhere
,
''
my
opinion
is
here
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
I
am
far
from
regarding
myself
as
one
of
those
privileged
*NL*
ones
to
whom
the
Ved
refers
when
it
says
,
that
``
he
who
has
true
faith
in
*NL*
the
Omnipresent
Supreme
Being
may
eat
all
that
exists
,
''
that
is
,
is
not
*NL*
bound
to
inquire
what
is
his
food
,
or
who
prepares
it
;
and
even
in
their
*NL*
case
it
is
to
be
observed
,
as
a
Hindoo
commentator
has
remarked
,
that
*NL*
the
Vedant
limits
this
privilege
to
``
the
time
of
distress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
has
not
sometimes
derived
an
inexpressible
satisfaction
from
his
*NL*
food
in
which
appetite
had
no
share
?
I
have
been
thrilled
to
think
that
*NL*
I
owed
a
mental
perception
to
the
commonly
gross
sense
of
taste
,
that
*NL*
I
have
been
inspired
through
the
palate
,
that
some
berries
which
I
had
*NL*
eaten
on
a
hillside
had
fed
my
genius
.
``
The
soul
not
being
mistress
*NL*
of
herself
,
''
says
Thseng-tseu
,
``
one
looks
,
and
one
does
not
see
;
one
*NL*
listens
,
and
one
does
not
hear
;
one
eats
,
and
one
does
not
know
the
*NL*
savor
of
food
.
''
He
who
distinguishes
the
true
savor
of
his
food
can
*NL*
never
be
a
glutton
;
he
who
does
not
can
not
be
otherwise
.
A
puritan
*NL*
may
go
to
his
brown-bread
crust
with
as
gross
an
appetite
as
ever
an
*NL*
alderman
to
his
turtle
.
Not
that
food
which
entereth
into
the
mouth
*NL*
defileth
a
man
,
but
the
appetite
with
which
it
is
eaten
.
It
is
neither
*NL*
the
quality
nor
the
quantity
,
but
the
devotion
to
sensual
savors
;
when
*NL*
that
which
is
eaten
is
not
a
viand
to
sustain
our
animal
,
or
inspire
our
*NL*
spiritual
life
,
but
food
for
the
worms
that
possess
us
.
If
the
hunter
*NL*
has
a
taste
for
mud-turtles
,
muskrats
,
and
other
such
savage
tidbits
,
*NL*
the
fine
lady
indulges
a
taste
for
jelly
made
of
a
calf
's
foot
,
or
for
*NL*
sardines
from
over
the
sea
,
and
they
are
even
.
He
goes
to
the
mill-pond
,
*NL*
she
to
her
preserve-pot
.
The
wonder
is
how
they
,
how
you
and
I
,
can
live
*NL*
this
slimy
,
beastly
life
,
eating
and
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
whole
life
is
startlingly
moral
.
There
is
never
an
instant
's
truce
*NL*
between
virtue
and
vice
.
Goodness
is
the
only
investment
that
never
*NL*
fails
.
In
the
music
of
the
harp
which
trembles
round
the
world
it
is
the
*NL*
insisting
on
this
which
thrills
us
.
The
harp
is
the
travelling
patterer
*NL*
for
the
Universe
's
Insurance
Company
,
recommending
its
laws
,
and
our
*NL*
little
goodness
is
all
the
assessment
that
we
pay
.
Though
the
youth
at
*NL*
last
grows
indifferent
,
the
laws
of
the
universe
are
not
indifferent
,
*NL*
but
are
forever
on
the
side
of
the
most
sensitive
.
Listen
to
every
*NL*
zephyr
for
some
reproof
,
for
it
is
surely
there
,
and
he
is
unfortunate
*NL*
who
does
not
hear
it
.
We
can
not
touch
a
string
or
move
a
stop
but
the
*NL*
charming
moral
transfixes
us
.
Many
an
irksome
noise
,
go
a
long
way
off
,
*NL*
is
heard
as
music
,
a
proud
,
sweet
satire
on
the
meanness
of
our
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
conscious
of
an
animal
in
us
,
which
awakens
in
proportion
as
our
*NL*
higher
nature
slumbers
.
It
is
reptile
and
sensual
,
and
perhaps
can
not
be
*NL*
wholly
expelled
;
like
the
worms
which
,
even
in
life
and
health
,
occupy
*NL*
our
bodies
.
Possibly
we
may
withdraw
from
it
,
but
never
change
its
*NL*
nature
.
I
fear
that
it
may
enjoy
a
certain
health
of
its
own
;
that
we
*NL*
may
be
well
,
yet
not
pure
.
The
other
day
I
picked
up
the
lower
jaw
of
*NL*
a
hog
,
with
white
and
sound
teeth
and
tusks
,
which
suggested
that
*NL*
there
was
an
animal
health
and
vigor
distinct
from
the
spiritual
.
This
*NL*
creature
succeeded
by
other
means
than
temperance
and
purity
.
``
That
*NL*
in
which
men
differ
from
brute
beasts
,
''
says
Mencius
,
``
is
a
thing
very
*NL*
inconsiderable
;
the
common
herd
lose
it
very
soon
;
superior
men
preserve
*NL*
it
carefully
.
''
Who
knows
what
sort
of
life
would
result
if
we
had
*NL*
attained
to
purity
?
If
I
knew
so
wise
a
man
as
could
teach
me
purity
I
*NL*
would
go
to
seek
him
forthwith
.
``
A
command
over
our
passions
,
and
over
*NL*
the
external
senses
of
the
body
,
and
good
acts
,
are
declared
by
the
Ved
*NL*
to
be
indispensable
in
the
mind
's
approximation
to
God
.
''
Yet
the
spirit
*NL*
can
for
the
time
pervade
and
control
every
member
and
function
of
the
*NL*
body
,
and
transmute
what
in
form
is
the
grossest
sensuality
into
*NL*
purity
and
devotion
.
The
generative
energy
,
which
,
when
we
are
loose
,
*NL*
dissipates
and
makes
us
unclean
,
when
we
are
continent
invigorates
*NL*
and
inspires
us
.
Chastity
is
the
flowering
of
man
;
and
what
are
called
*NL*
Genius
,
Heroism
,
Holiness
,
and
the
like
,
are
but
various
fruits
which
*NL*
succeed
it
.
Man
flows
at
once
to
God
when
the
channel
of
purity
is
*NL*
open
.
By
turns
our
purity
inspires
and
our
impurity
casts
us
down
.
He
is
*NL*
blessed
who
is
assured
that
the
animal
is
dying
out
in
him
day
by
day
,
*NL*
and
the
divine
being
established
.
Perhaps
there
is
none
but
has
cause
*NL*
for
shame
on
account
of
the
inferior
and
brutish
nature
to
which
he
*NL*
is
allied
.
I
fear
that
we
are
such
gods
or
demigods
only
as
fauns
and
*NL*
satyrs
,
the
divine
allied
to
beasts
,
the
creatures
of
appetite
,
and
*NL*
that
,
to
some
extent
,
our
very
life
is
our
disgrace
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
happy
's
he
who
hath
due
place
assigned

To

Else

not
only

of
swine
,

But
he

to
a
headlong
rage

them
worse

*NL*
All
sensuality
is
one
,
though
it
takes
many
forms
;
all
purity
is
one
.
It
*NL*
is
the
same
whether
a
man
eat
,
or
drink
,
or
cohabit
,
or
sleep
sensually
.
*NL*
They
are
but
one
appetite
,
and
we
only
need
to
see
a
person
do
any
one
*NL*
of
these
things
to
know
how
great
a
sensualist
he
is
.
The
impure
can
*NL*
neither
stand
nor
sit
with
purity
.
When
the
reptile
is
attacked
at
*NL*
one
mouth
of
his
burrow
,
he
shows
himself
at
another
.
If
you
would
be
*NL*
chaste
,
you
must
be
temperate
.
What
is
chastity
?
How
shall
a
man
know
if
*NL*
he
is
chaste
?
He
shall
not
know
it
.
We
have
heard
of
this
virtue
,
but
*NL*
we
know
not
what
it
is
.
We
speak
conformably
to
the
rumor
which
we
have
*NL*
heard
.
From
exertion
come
wisdom
and
purity
;
from
sloth
ignorance
and
*NL*
sensuality
.
In
the
student
sensuality
is
a
sluggish
habit
of
mind
.
An
*NL*
unclean
person
is
universally
a
slothful
one
,
one
who
sits
by
a
stove
,
*NL*
whom
the
sun
shines
on
prostrate
,
who
reposes
without
being
fatigued
.
If
*NL*
you
would
avoid
uncleanness
,
and
all
the
sins
,
work
earnestly
,
though
it
*NL*
be
at
cleaning
a
stable
.
Nature
is
hard
to
be
overcome
,
but
she
must
be
*NL*
overcome
.
What
avails
it
that
you
are
Christian
,
if
you
are
not
purer
*NL*
than
the
heathen
,
if
you
deny
yourself
no
more
,
if
you
are
not
more
*NL*
religious
?
I
know
of
many
systems
of
religion
esteemed
heathenish
whose
*NL*
precepts
fill
the
reader
with
shame
,
and
provoke
him
to
new
endeavors
,
*NL*
though
it
be
to
the
performance
of
rites
merely
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hesitate
to
say
these
things
,
but
it
is
not
because
of
the
subject
--
I
*NL*
care
not
how
obscene
my
_
words
_
are
--
but
because
I
can
not
speak
of
them
*NL*
without
betraying
my
impurity
.
We
discourse
freely
without
shame
of
one
*NL*
form
of
sensuality
,
and
are
silent
about
another
.
We
are
so
degraded
*NL*
that
we
can
not
speak
simply
of
the
necessary
functions
of
human
nature
.
*NL*
In
earlier
ages
,
in
some
countries
,
every
function
was
reverently
*NL*
spoken
of
and
regulated
by
law
.
Nothing
was
too
trivial
for
the
Hindoo
*NL*
lawgiver
,
however
offensive
it
may
be
to
modern
taste
.
He
teaches
how
to
*NL*
eat
,
drink
,
cohabit
,
void
excrement
and
urine
,
and
the
like
,
elevating
*NL*
what
is
mean
,
and
does
not
falsely
excuse
himself
by
calling
these
*NL*
things
trifles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
man
is
the
builder
of
a
temple
,
called
his
body
,
to
the
god
he
*NL*
worships
,
after
a
style
purely
his
own
,
nor
can
he
get
off
by
hammering
*NL*
marble
instead
.
We
are
all
sculptors
and
painters
,
and
our
material
*NL*
is
our
own
flesh
and
blood
and
bones
.
Any
nobleness
begins
at
once
to
*NL*
refine
a
man
's
features
,
any
meanness
or
sensuality
to
imbrute
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Farmer
sat
at
his
door
one
September
evening
,
after
a
hard
day
's
*NL*
work
,
his
mind
still
running
on
his
labor
more
or
less
.
Having
bathed
,
*NL*
he
sat
down
to
re-create
his
intellectual
man
.
It
was
a
rather
cool
*NL*
evening
,
and
some
of
his
neighbors
were
apprehending
a
frost
.
He
had
*NL*
not
attended
to
the
train
of
his
thoughts
long
when
he
heard
some
one
*NL*
playing
on
a
flute
,
and
that
sound
harmonized
with
his
mood
.
Still
he
*NL*
thought
of
his
work
;
but
the
burden
of
his
thought
was
,
that
though
this
*NL*
kept
running
in
his
head
,
and
he
found
himself
planning
and
contriving
*NL*
it
against
his
will
,
yet
it
concerned
him
very
little
.
It
was
no
more
*NL*
than
the
scurf
of
his
skin
,
which
was
constantly
shuffled
off
.
But
the
*NL*
notes
of
the
flute
came
home
to
his
ears
out
of
a
different
sphere
*NL*
from
that
he
worked
in
,
and
suggested
work
for
certain
faculties
which
*NL*
slumbered
in
him
.
They
gently
did
away
with
the
street
,
and
the
village
,
*NL*
and
the
state
in
which
he
lived
.
A
voice
said
to
him
--
Why
do
you
stay
*NL*
here
and
live
this
mean
moiling
life
,
when
a
glorious
existence
is
*NL*
possible
for
you
?
Those
same
stars
twinkle
over
other
fields
than
*NL*
these
.
--
But
how
to
come
out
of
this
condition
and
actually
migrate
*NL*
thither
?
All
that
he
could
think
of
was
to
practise
some
new
austerity
,
*NL*
to
let
his
mind
descend
into
his
body
and
redeem
it
,
and
treat
himself
*NL*
with
ever
increasing
respect
.

Sometimes
I
had
a
companion
in
my
fishing
,
who
came
through
the
village
*NL*
to
my
house
from
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
and
the
catching
of
the
*NL*
dinner
was
as
much
a
social
exercise
as
the
eating
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Hermit
.
_
I
wonder
what
the
world
is
doing
now
.
I
have
not
heard
so
much
*NL*
as
a
locust
over
the
sweet-fern
these
three
hours
.
The
pigeons
are
all
*NL*
asleep
upon
their
roosts
--
no
flutter
from
them
.
Was
that
a
farmer
's
noon
*NL*
horn
which
sounded
from
beyond
the
woods
just
now
?
The
hands
are
coming
*NL*
in
to
boiled
salt
beef
and
cider
and
Indian
bread
.
Why
will
men
worry
*NL*
themselves
so
?
He
that
does
not
eat
need
not
work
.
I
wonder
how
much
*NL*
they
have
reaped
.
Who
would
live
there
where
a
body
can
never
think
*NL*
for
the
barking
of
Bose
?
And
oh
,
the
housekeeping
!
to
keep
bright
the
*NL*
devil
's
door-knobs
,
and
scour
his
tubs
this
bright
day
!
Better
not
*NL*
keep
a
house
.
Say
,
some
hollow
tree
;
and
then
for
morning
calls
and
*NL*
dinner-parties
!
Only
a
woodpecker
tapping
.
Oh
,
they
swarm
;
the
sun
is
*NL*
too
warm
there
;
they
are
born
too
far
into
life
for
me
.
I
have
water
*NL*
from
the
spring
,
and
a
loaf
of
brown
bread
on
the
shelf
.
--
Hark
!
I
hear
a
*NL*
rustling
of
the
leaves
.
Is
it
some
ill-fed
village
hound
yielding
to
*NL*
the
instinct
of
the
chase
?
or
the
lost
pig
which
is
said
to
be
in
these
*NL*
woods
,
whose
tracks
I
saw
after
the
rain
?
It
comes
on
apace
;
my
sumachs
*NL*
and
sweetbriers
tremble
.
--
Eh
,
Mr.
Poet
,
is
it
you
?
How
do
you
like
the
*NL*
world
to-day
?
*NL*
*NL*
_
Poet
.
_
See
those
clouds
;
how
they
hang
!
That
's
the
greatest
thing
I
have
*NL*
seen
to-day
.
There
's
nothing
like
it
in
old
paintings
,
nothing
like
it
*NL*
in
foreign
lands
--
unless
when
we
were
off
the
coast
of
Spain
.
That
's
a
*NL*
true
Mediterranean
sky
.
I
thought
,
as
I
have
my
living
to
get
,
and
have
*NL*
not
eaten
to-day
,
that
I
might
go
a-fishing
.
That
's
the
true
industry
*NL*
for
poets
.
It
is
the
only
trade
I
have
learned
.
Come
,
let
's
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Hermit
.
_
I
can
not
resist
.
My
brown
bread
will
soon
be
gone
.
I
will
go
*NL*
with
you
gladly
soon
,
but
I
am
just
concluding
a
serious
meditation
.
I
*NL*
think
that
I
am
near
the
end
of
it
.
Leave
me
alone
,
then
,
for
a
while
.
*NL*
But
that
we
may
not
be
delayed
,
you
shall
be
digging
the
bait
meanwhile
.
*NL*
Angleworms
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
in
these
parts
,
where
the
soil
was
*NL*
never
fattened
with
manure
;
the
race
is
nearly
extinct
.
The
sport
of
*NL*
digging
the
bait
is
nearly
equal
to
that
of
catching
the
fish
,
when
*NL*
one
's
appetite
is
not
too
keen
;
and
this
you
may
have
all
to
yourself
*NL*
today
.
I
would
advise
you
to
set
in
the
spade
down
yonder
among
the
*NL*
ground-nuts
,
where
you
see
the
johnswort
waving
.
I
think
that
I
may
*NL*
warrant
you
one
worm
to
every
three
sods
you
turn
up
,
if
you
look
well
*NL*
in
among
the
roots
of
the
grass
,
as
if
you
were
weeding
.
Or
,
if
you
*NL*
choose
to
go
farther
,
it
will
not
be
unwise
,
for
I
have
found
the
*NL*
increase
of
fair
bait
to
be
very
nearly
as
the
squares
of
the
distances
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Hermit
alone
.
_
Let
me
see
;
where
was
I
?
Methinks
I
was
nearly
in
this
*NL*
frame
of
mind
;
the
world
lay
about
at
this
angle
.
Shall
I
go
to
heaven
*NL*
or
a-fishing
?
If
I
should
soon
bring
this
meditation
to
an
end
,
would
*NL*
another
so
sweet
occasion
be
likely
to
offer
?
I
was
as
near
being
*NL*
resolved
into
the
essence
of
things
as
ever
I
was
in
my
life
.
I
fear
*NL*
my
thoughts
will
not
come
back
to
me
.
If
it
would
do
any
good
,
I
would
*NL*
whistle
for
them
.
When
they
make
us
an
offer
,
is
it
wise
to
say
,
We
will
*NL*
think
of
it
?
My
thoughts
have
left
no
track
,
and
I
can
not
find
the
path
*NL*
again
.
What
was
it
that
I
was
thinking
of
?
It
was
a
very
hazy
day
.
I
*NL*
will
just
try
these
three
sentences
of
Confut-see
;
they
may
fetch
that
*NL*
state
about
again
.
I
know
not
whether
it
was
the
dumps
or
a
budding
*NL*
ecstasy
.
Mem
.
There
never
is
but
one
opportunity
of
a
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
_

How
now
,
Hermit
,
is
it
too
soon
?
I
have
got
just
thirteen
whole
*NL*
ones
,
beside
several
which
are
imperfect
or
undersized
;
but
they
will
*NL*
do
for
the
smaller
fry
;
they
do
not
cover
up
the
hook
so
much
.
Those
*NL*
village
worms
are
quite
too
large
;
a
shiner
may
make
a
meal
off
one
*NL*
without
finding
the
skewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Hermit
.
_
Well
,
then
,
let
's
be
off
.
Shall
we
to
the
Concord
?
There
's
good
*NL*
sport
there
if
the
water
be
not
too
high
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Why
do
precisely
these
objects
which
we
behold
make
a
world
?
Why
has
*NL*
man
just
these
species
of
animals
for
his
neighbors
;
as
if
nothing
but
*NL*
a
mouse
could
have
filled
this
crevice
?
I
suspect
that
Pilpay
&
Co.
have
*NL*
put
animals
to
their
best
use
,
for
they
are
all
beasts
of
burden
,
in
a
*NL*
sense
,
made
to
carry
some
portion
of
our
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mice
which
haunted
my
house
were
not
the
common
ones
,
which
are
said
*NL*
to
have
been
introduced
into
the
country
,
but
a
wild
native
kind
not
*NL*
found
in
the
village
.
I
sent
one
to
a
distinguished
naturalist
,
and
*NL*
it
interested
him
much
.
When
I
was
building
,
one
of
these
had
its
nest
*NL*
underneath
the
house
,
and
before
I
had
laid
the
second
floor
,
and
swept
*NL*
out
the
shavings
,
would
come
out
regularly
at
lunch
time
and
pick
up
the
*NL*
crumbs
at
my
feet
.
It
probably
had
never
seen
a
man
before
;
and
it
soon
*NL*
became
quite
familiar
,
and
would
run
over
my
shoes
and
up
my
clothes
.
*NL*
It
could
readily
ascend
the
sides
of
the
room
by
short
impulses
,
like
a
*NL*
squirrel
,
which
it
resembled
in
its
motions
.
At
length
,
as
I
leaned
*NL*
with
my
elbow
on
the
bench
one
day
,
it
ran
up
my
clothes
,
and
along
my
*NL*
sleeve
,
and
round
and
round
the
paper
which
held
my
dinner
,
while
I
kept
*NL*
the
latter
close
,
and
dodged
and
played
at
bopeep
with
it
;
and
when
at
*NL*
last
I
held
still
a
piece
of
cheese
between
my
thumb
and
finger
,
it
came
*NL*
and
nibbled
it
,
sitting
in
my
hand
,
and
afterward
cleaned
its
face
and
*NL*
paws
,
like
a
fly
,
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
phoebe
soon
built
in
my
shed
,
and
a
robin
for
protection
in
a
pine
*NL*
which
grew
against
the
house
.
In
June
the
partridge
-LRB-
_
Tetrao
umbellus
_
-RRB-
,
*NL*
which
is
so
shy
a
bird
,
led
her
brood
past
my
windows
,
from
the
woods
in
*NL*
the
rear
to
the
front
of
my
house
,
clucking
and
calling
to
them
like
a
*NL*
hen
,
and
in
all
her
behavior
proving
herself
the
hen
of
the
woods
.
The
*NL*
young
suddenly
disperse
on
your
approach
,
at
a
signal
from
the
mother
,
*NL*
as
if
a
whirlwind
had
swept
them
away
,
and
they
so
exactly
resemble
the
*NL*
dried
leaves
and
twigs
that
many
a
traveler
has
placed
his
foot
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
brood
,
and
heard
the
whir
of
the
old
bird
as
she
flew
off
,
*NL*
and
her
anxious
calls
and
mewing
,
or
seen
her
trail
her
wings
to
attract
*NL*
his
attention
,
without
suspecting
their
neighborhood
.
The
parent
will
*NL*
sometimes
roll
and
spin
round
before
you
in
such
a
dishabille
,
that
you
*NL*
can
not
,
for
a
few
moments
,
detect
what
kind
of
creature
it
is
.
The
young
*NL*
squat
still
and
flat
,
often
running
their
heads
under
a
leaf
,
and
mind
*NL*
only
their
mother
's
directions
given
from
a
distance
,
nor
will
your
*NL*
approach
make
them
run
again
and
betray
themselves
.
You
may
even
tread
*NL*
on
them
,
or
have
your
eyes
on
them
for
a
minute
,
without
discovering
*NL*
them
.
I
have
held
them
in
my
open
hand
at
such
a
time
,
and
still
their
*NL*
only
care
,
obedient
to
their
mother
and
their
instinct
,
was
to
squat
*NL*
there
without
fear
or
trembling
.
So
perfect
is
this
instinct
,
that
once
,
*NL*
when
I
had
laid
them
on
the
leaves
again
,
and
one
accidentally
fell
on
*NL*
its
side
,
it
was
found
with
the
rest
in
exactly
the
same
position
ten
*NL*
minutes
afterward
.
They
are
not
callow
like
the
young
of
most
birds
,
*NL*
but
more
perfectly
developed
and
precocious
even
than
chickens
.
The
*NL*
remarkably
adult
yet
innocent
expression
of
their
open
and
serene
*NL*
eyes
is
very
memorable
.
All
intelligence
seems
reflected
in
them
.
They
*NL*
suggest
not
merely
the
purity
of
infancy
,
but
a
wisdom
clarified
by
*NL*
experience
.
Such
an
eye
was
not
born
when
the
bird
was
,
but
is
coeval
*NL*
with
the
sky
it
reflects
.
The
woods
do
not
yield
another
such
a
gem
.
The
*NL*
traveller
does
not
often
look
into
such
a
limpid
well
.
The
ignorant
or
*NL*
reckless
sportsman
often
shoots
the
parent
at
such
a
time
,
and
leaves
*NL*
these
innocents
to
fall
a
prey
to
some
prowling
beast
or
bird
,
or
*NL*
gradually
mingle
with
the
decaying
leaves
which
they
so
much
resemble
.
*NL*
It
is
said
that
when
hatched
by
a
hen
they
will
directly
disperse
on
*NL*
some
alarm
,
and
so
are
lost
,
for
they
never
hear
the
mother
's
call
which
*NL*
gathers
them
again
.
These
were
my
hens
and
chickens
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
remarkable
how
many
creatures
live
wild
and
free
though
secret
in
*NL*
the
woods
,
and
still
sustain
themselves
in
the
neighborhood
of
towns
,
*NL*
suspected
by
hunters
only
.
How
retired
the
otter
manages
to
live
here
!
*NL*
He
grows
to
be
four
feet
long
,
as
big
as
a
small
boy
,
perhaps
without
*NL*
any
human
being
getting
a
glimpse
of
him
.
I
formerly
saw
the
raccoon
in
*NL*
the
woods
behind
where
my
house
is
built
,
and
probably
still
heard
their
*NL*
whinnering
at
night
.
Commonly
I
rested
an
hour
or
two
in
the
shade
at
*NL*
noon
,
after
planting
,
and
ate
my
lunch
,
and
read
a
little
by
a
spring
*NL*
which
was
the
source
of
a
swamp
and
of
a
brook
,
oozing
from
under
*NL*
Brister
's
Hill
,
half
a
mile
from
my
field
.
The
approach
to
this
was
*NL*
through
a
succession
of
descending
grassy
hollows
,
full
of
young
pitch
*NL*
pines
,
into
a
larger
wood
about
the
swamp
.
There
,
in
a
very
secluded
and
*NL*
shaded
spot
,
under
a
spreading
white
pine
,
there
was
yet
a
clean
,
firm
*NL*
sward
to
sit
on
.
I
had
dug
out
the
spring
and
made
a
well
of
clear
gray
*NL*
water
,
where
I
could
dip
up
a
pailful
without
roiling
it
,
and
thither
I
*NL*
went
for
this
purpose
almost
every
day
in
midsummer
,
when
the
pond
was
*NL*
warmest
.
Thither
,
too
,
the
woodcock
led
her
brood
,
to
probe
the
mud
for
*NL*
worms
,
flying
but
a
foot
above
them
down
the
bank
,
while
they
ran
in
*NL*
a
troop
beneath
;
but
at
last
,
spying
me
,
she
would
leave
her
young
and
*NL*
circle
round
and
round
me
,
nearer
and
nearer
till
within
four
or
five
*NL*
feet
,
pretending
broken
wings
and
legs
,
to
attract
my
attention
,
and
get
*NL*
off
her
young
,
who
would
already
have
taken
up
their
march
,
with
faint
,
*NL*
wiry
peep
,
single
file
through
the
swamp
,
as
she
directed
.
Or
I
heard
*NL*
the
peep
of
the
young
when
I
could
not
see
the
parent
bird
.
There
too
*NL*
the
turtle
doves
sat
over
the
spring
,
or
fluttered
from
bough
to
bough
*NL*
of
the
soft
white
pines
over
my
head
;
or
the
red
squirrel
,
coursing
down
*NL*
the
nearest
bough
,
was
particularly
familiar
and
inquisitive
.
You
only
*NL*
need
sit
still
long
enough
in
some
attractive
spot
in
the
woods
that
all
*NL*
its
inhabitants
may
exhibit
themselves
to
you
by
turns
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
witness
to
events
of
a
less
peaceful
character
.
One
day
when
I
*NL*
went
out
to
my
wood-pile
,
or
rather
my
pile
of
stumps
,
I
observed
two
*NL*
large
ants
,
the
one
red
,
the
other
much
larger
,
nearly
half
an
inch
*NL*
long
,
and
black
,
fiercely
contending
with
one
another
.
Having
once
got
*NL*
hold
they
never
let
go
,
but
struggled
and
wrestled
and
rolled
on
the
*NL*
chips
incessantly
.
Looking
farther
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
*NL*
chips
were
covered
with
such
combatants
,
that
it
was
not
a
_
duellum
_
,
but
*NL*
a
_
bellum
_
,
a
war
between
two
races
of
ants
,
the
red
always
pitted
against
*NL*
the
black
,
and
frequently
two
red
ones
to
one
black
.
The
legions
of
*NL*
these
Myrmidons
covered
all
the
hills
and
vales
in
my
wood-yard
,
and
the
*NL*
ground
was
already
strewn
with
the
dead
and
dying
,
both
red
and
*NL*
black
.
It
was
the
only
battle
which
I
have
ever
witnessed
,
the
only
*NL*
battle-field
I
ever
trod
while
the
battle
was
raging
;
internecine
war
;
*NL*
the
red
republicans
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
black
imperialists
on
the
*NL*
other
.
On
every
side
they
were
engaged
in
deadly
combat
,
yet
without
any
*NL*
noise
that
I
could
hear
,
and
human
soldiers
never
fought
so
resolutely
.
*NL*
I
watched
a
couple
that
were
fast
locked
in
each
other
's
embraces
,
in
*NL*
a
little
sunny
valley
amid
the
chips
,
now
at
noonday
prepared
to
fight
*NL*
till
the
sun
went
down
,
or
life
went
out
.
The
smaller
red
champion
had
*NL*
fastened
himself
like
a
vice
to
his
adversary
's
front
,
and
through
all
*NL*
the
tumblings
on
that
field
never
for
an
instant
ceased
to
gnaw
at
one
*NL*
of
his
feelers
near
the
root
,
having
already
caused
the
other
to
go
by
*NL*
the
board
;
while
the
stronger
black
one
dashed
him
from
side
to
side
,
*NL*
and
,
as
I
saw
on
looking
nearer
,
had
already
divested
him
of
several
of
*NL*
his
members
.
They
fought
with
more
pertinacity
than
bulldogs
.
Neither
*NL*
manifested
the
least
disposition
to
retreat
.
It
was
evident
that
their
*NL*
battle-cry
was
``
Conquer
or
die
.
''
In
the
meanwhile
there
came
along
*NL*
a
single
red
ant
on
the
hillside
of
this
valley
,
evidently
full
of
*NL*
excitement
,
who
either
had
despatched
his
foe
,
or
had
not
yet
taken
part
*NL*
in
the
battle
;
probably
the
latter
,
for
he
had
lost
none
of
his
limbs
;
*NL*
whose
mother
had
charged
him
to
return
with
his
shield
or
upon
it
.
Or
*NL*
perchance
he
was
some
Achilles
,
who
had
nourished
his
wrath
apart
,
and
*NL*
had
now
come
to
avenge
or
rescue
his
Patroclus
.
He
saw
this
unequal
*NL*
combat
from
afar
--
for
the
blacks
were
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
*NL*
red
--
he
drew
near
with
rapid
pace
till
he
stood
on
his
guard
within
half
*NL*
an
inch
of
the
combatants
;
then
,
watching
his
opportunity
,
he
sprang
*NL*
upon
the
black
warrior
,
and
commenced
his
operations
near
the
root
of
*NL*
his
right
fore
leg
,
leaving
the
foe
to
select
among
his
own
members
;
and
*NL*
so
there
were
three
united
for
life
,
as
if
a
new
kind
of
attraction
had
*NL*
been
invented
which
put
all
other
locks
and
cements
to
shame
.
I
should
*NL*
not
have
wondered
by
this
time
to
find
that
they
had
their
respective
*NL*
musical
bands
stationed
on
some
eminent
chip
,
and
playing
their
national
*NL*
airs
the
while
,
to
excite
the
slow
and
cheer
the
dying
combatants
.
I
was
*NL*
myself
excited
somewhat
even
as
if
they
had
been
men
.
The
more
you
think
*NL*
of
it
,
the
less
the
difference
.
And
certainly
there
is
not
the
fight
*NL*
recorded
in
Concord
history
,
at
least
,
if
in
the
history
of
America
,
*NL*
that
will
bear
a
moment
's
comparison
with
this
,
whether
for
the
numbers
*NL*
engaged
in
it
,
or
for
the
patriotism
and
heroism
displayed
.
For
numbers
*NL*
and
for
carnage
it
was
an
Austerlitz
or
Dresden
.
Concord
Fight
!
Two
*NL*
killed
on
the
patriots
'
side
,
and
Luther
Blanchard
wounded
!
Why
here
*NL*
every
ant
was
a
Buttrick
--
``
Fire
!
for
God
's
sake
fire
!
''
--
and
thousands
*NL*
shared
the
fate
of
Davis
and
Hosmer
.
There
was
not
one
hireling
there
.
*NL*
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
a
principle
they
fought
for
,
as
much
as
*NL*
our
ancestors
,
and
not
to
avoid
a
three-penny
tax
on
their
tea
;
and
the
*NL*
results
of
this
battle
will
be
as
important
and
memorable
to
those
whom
*NL*
it
concerns
as
those
of
the
battle
of
Bunker
Hill
,
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
up
the
chip
on
which
the
three
I
have
particularly
described
were
*NL*
struggling
,
carried
it
into
my
house
,
and
placed
it
under
a
tumbler
on
*NL*
my
window-sill
,
in
order
to
see
the
issue
.
Holding
a
microscope
to
the
*NL*
first-mentioned
red
ant
,
I
saw
that
,
though
he
was
assiduously
gnawing
*NL*
at
the
near
fore
leg
of
his
enemy
,
having
severed
his
remaining
feeler
,
*NL*
his
own
breast
was
all
torn
away
,
exposing
what
vitals
he
had
there
*NL*
to
the
jaws
of
the
black
warrior
,
whose
breastplate
was
apparently
too
*NL*
thick
for
him
to
pierce
;
and
the
dark
carbuncles
of
the
sufferer
's
eyes
*NL*
shone
with
ferocity
such
as
war
only
could
excite
.
They
struggled
half
*NL*
an
hour
longer
under
the
tumbler
,
and
when
I
looked
again
the
black
*NL*
soldier
had
severed
the
heads
of
his
foes
from
their
bodies
,
and
the
*NL*
still
living
heads
were
hanging
on
either
side
of
him
like
ghastly
*NL*
trophies
at
his
saddle-bow
,
still
apparently
as
firmly
fastened
as
ever
,
*NL*
and
he
was
endeavoring
with
feeble
struggles
,
being
without
feelers
and
*NL*
with
only
the
remnant
of
a
leg
,
and
I
know
not
how
many
other
wounds
,
*NL*
to
divest
himself
of
them
;
which
at
length
,
after
half
an
hour
more
,
he
*NL*
accomplished
.
I
raised
the
glass
,
and
he
went
off
over
the
window-sill
*NL*
in
that
crippled
state
.
Whether
he
finally
survived
that
combat
,
and
*NL*
spent
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
some
Hotel
des
Invalides
,
I
do
*NL*
not
know
;
but
I
thought
that
his
industry
would
not
be
worth
much
*NL*
thereafter
.
I
never
learned
which
party
was
victorious
,
nor
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
war
;
but
I
felt
for
the
rest
of
that
day
as
if
I
had
had
my
feelings
*NL*
excited
and
harrowed
by
witnessing
the
struggle
,
the
ferocity
and
*NL*
carnage
,
of
a
human
battle
before
my
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kirby
and
Spence
tell
us
that
the
battles
of
ants
have
long
been
*NL*
celebrated
and
the
date
of
them
recorded
,
though
they
say
that
Huber
*NL*
is
the
only
modern
author
who
appears
to
have
witnessed
them
.
``
A
neas
*NL*
Sylvius
,
''
say
they
,
``
after
giving
a
very
circumstantial
account
of
one
*NL*
contested
with
great
obstinacy
by
a
great
and
small
species
on
the
trunk
*NL*
of
a
pear
tree
,
''
adds
that
``
this
action
was
fought
in
the
pontificate
*NL*
of
Eugenius
the
Fourth
,
in
the
presence
of
Nicholas
Pistoriensis
,
an
*NL*
eminent
lawyer
,
who
related
the
whole
history
of
the
battle
with
the
*NL*
greatest
fidelity
.
''
A
similar
engagement
between
great
and
small
ants
is
*NL*
recorded
by
Olaus
Magnus
,
in
which
the
small
ones
,
being
victorious
,
are
*NL*
said
to
have
buried
the
bodies
of
their
own
soldiers
,
but
left
those
of
*NL*
their
giant
enemies
a
prey
to
the
birds
.
This
event
happened
previous
*NL*
to
the
expulsion
of
the
tyrant
Christiern
the
Second
from
Sweden
.
The
*NL*
battle
which
I
witnessed
took
place
in
the
Presidency
of
Polk
,
five
*NL*
years
before
the
passage
of
Webster
's
Fugitive-Slave
Bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
village
Bose
,
fit
only
to
course
a
mud-turtle
in
a
victualling
*NL*
cellar
,
sported
his
heavy
quarters
in
the
woods
,
without
the
knowledge
*NL*
of
his
master
,
and
ineffectually
smelled
at
old
fox
burrows
and
*NL*
woodchucks
'
holes
;
led
perchance
by
some
slight
cur
which
nimbly
*NL*
threaded
the
wood
,
and
might
still
inspire
a
natural
terror
in
its
*NL*
denizens
;
--
now
far
behind
his
guide
,
barking
like
a
canine
bull
toward
*NL*
some
small
squirrel
which
had
treed
itself
for
scrutiny
,
then
,
cantering
*NL*
off
,
bending
the
bushes
with
his
weight
,
imagining
that
he
is
on
the
*NL*
track
of
some
stray
member
of
the
jerbilla
family
.
Once
I
was
surprised
*NL*
to
see
a
cat
walking
along
the
stony
shore
of
the
pond
,
for
they
rarely
*NL*
wander
so
far
from
home
.
The
surprise
was
mutual
.
Nevertheless
the
most
*NL*
domestic
cat
,
which
has
lain
on
a
rug
all
her
days
,
appears
quite
at
*NL*
home
in
the
woods
,
and
,
by
her
sly
and
stealthy
behavior
,
proves
herself
*NL*
more
native
there
than
the
regular
inhabitants
.
Once
,
when
berrying
,
*NL*
I
met
with
a
cat
with
young
kittens
in
the
woods
,
quite
wild
,
and
they
*NL*
all
,
like
their
mother
,
had
their
backs
up
and
were
fiercely
spitting
at
*NL*
me
.
A
few
years
before
I
lived
in
the
woods
there
was
what
was
called
a
*NL*
``
winged
cat
''
in
one
of
the
farm-houses
in
Lincoln
nearest
the
pond
,
Mr.
*NL*
Gilian
Baker
's
.
When
I
called
to
see
her
in
June
,
1842
,
she
was
gone
*NL*
a-hunting
in
the
woods
,
as
was
her
wont
-LRB-
I
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
*NL*
a
male
or
female
,
and
so
use
the
more
common
pronoun
-RRB-
,
but
her
mistress
*NL*
told
me
that
she
came
into
the
neighborhood
a
little
more
than
a
year
*NL*
before
,
in
April
,
and
was
finally
taken
into
their
house
;
that
she
was
*NL*
of
a
dark
brownish-gray
color
,
with
a
white
spot
on
her
throat
,
and
*NL*
white
feet
,
and
had
a
large
bushy
tail
like
a
fox
;
that
in
the
winter
*NL*
the
fur
grew
thick
and
flatted
out
along
her
sides
,
forming
stripes
ten
*NL*
or
twelve
inches
long
by
two
and
a
half
wide
,
and
under
her
chin
like
*NL*
a
muff
,
the
upper
side
loose
,
the
under
matted
like
felt
,
and
in
the
*NL*
spring
these
appendages
dropped
off
.
They
gave
me
a
pair
of
her
``
wings
,
''
*NL*
which
I
keep
still
.
There
is
no
appearance
of
a
membrane
about
them
.
*NL*
Some
thought
it
was
part
flying
squirrel
or
some
other
wild
animal
,
*NL*
which
is
not
impossible
,
for
,
according
to
naturalists
,
prolific
hybrids
*NL*
have
been
produced
by
the
union
of
the
marten
and
domestic
cat
.
This
*NL*
would
have
been
the
right
kind
of
cat
for
me
to
keep
,
if
I
had
kept
any
;
*NL*
for
why
should
not
a
poet
's
cat
be
winged
as
well
as
his
horse
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fall
the
loon
-LRB-
_
Colymbus
glacialis
_
-RRB-
came
,
as
usual
,
to
moult
and
*NL*
bathe
in
the
pond
,
making
the
woods
ring
with
his
wild
laughter
before
I
*NL*
had
risen
.
At
rumor
of
his
arrival
all
the
Mill-dam
sportsmen
are
on
the
*NL*
alert
,
in
gigs
and
on
foot
,
two
by
two
and
three
by
three
,
with
patent
*NL*
rifles
and
conical
balls
and
spy-glasses
.
They
come
rustling
through
*NL*
the
woods
like
autumn
leaves
,
at
least
ten
men
to
one
loon
.
Some
station
*NL*
themselves
on
this
side
of
the
pond
,
some
on
that
,
for
the
poor
bird
*NL*
can
not
be
omnipresent
;
if
he
dive
here
he
must
come
up
there
.
But
*NL*
now
the
kind
October
wind
rises
,
rustling
the
leaves
and
rippling
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
water
,
so
that
no
loon
can
be
heard
or
seen
,
though
his
*NL*
foes
sweep
the
pond
with
spy-glasses
,
and
make
the
woods
resound
with
*NL*
their
discharges
.
The
waves
generously
rise
and
dash
angrily
,
taking
*NL*
sides
with
all
water-fowl
,
and
our
sportsmen
must
beat
a
retreat
to
town
*NL*
and
shop
and
unfinished
jobs
.
But
they
were
too
often
successful
.
When
*NL*
I
went
to
get
a
pail
of
water
early
in
the
morning
I
frequently
saw
this
*NL*
stately
bird
sailing
out
of
my
cove
within
a
few
rods
.
If
I
endeavored
*NL*
to
overtake
him
in
a
boat
,
in
order
to
see
how
he
would
manoeuvre
,
he
*NL*
would
dive
and
be
completely
lost
,
so
that
I
did
not
discover
him
again
,
*NL*
sometimes
,
till
the
latter
part
of
the
day
.
But
I
was
more
than
a
match
*NL*
for
him
on
the
surface
.
He
commonly
went
off
in
a
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
paddling
along
the
north
shore
one
very
calm
October
afternoon
,
*NL*
for
such
days
especially
they
settle
on
to
the
lakes
,
like
the
milkweed
*NL*
down
,
having
looked
in
vain
over
the
pond
for
a
loon
,
suddenly
one
,
*NL*
sailing
out
from
the
shore
toward
the
middle
a
few
rods
in
front
of
me
,
*NL*
set
up
his
wild
laugh
and
betrayed
himself
.
I
pursued
with
a
paddle
and
*NL*
he
dived
,
but
when
he
came
up
I
was
nearer
than
before
.
He
dived
again
,
*NL*
but
I
miscalculated
the
direction
he
would
take
,
and
we
were
fifty
rods
*NL*
apart
when
he
came
to
the
surface
this
time
,
for
I
had
helped
to
widen
*NL*
the
interval
;
and
again
he
laughed
long
and
loud
,
and
with
more
reason
*NL*
than
before
.
He
manoeuvred
so
cunningly
that
I
could
not
get
within
half
*NL*
a
dozen
rods
of
him
.
Each
time
,
when
he
came
to
the
surface
,
turning
his
*NL*
head
this
way
and
that
,
he
cooly
surveyed
the
water
and
the
land
,
and
*NL*
apparently
chose
his
course
so
that
he
might
come
up
where
there
was
the
*NL*
widest
expanse
of
water
and
at
the
greatest
distance
from
the
boat
.
It
*NL*
was
surprising
how
quickly
he
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
resolve
into
*NL*
execution
.
He
led
me
at
once
to
the
widest
part
of
the
pond
,
and
could
*NL*
not
be
driven
from
it
.
While
he
was
thinking
one
thing
in
his
brain
,
*NL*
I
was
endeavoring
to
divine
his
thought
in
mine
.
It
was
a
pretty
game
,
*NL*
played
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
pond
,
a
man
against
a
loon
.
Suddenly
*NL*
your
adversary
's
checker
disappears
beneath
the
board
,
and
the
problem
*NL*
is
to
place
yours
nearest
to
where
his
will
appear
again
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
would
come
up
unexpectedly
on
the
opposite
side
of
me
,
having
*NL*
apparently
passed
directly
under
the
boat
.
So
long-winded
was
he
and
so
*NL*
unweariable
,
that
when
he
had
swum
farthest
he
would
immediately
plunge
*NL*
again
,
nevertheless
;
and
then
no
wit
could
divine
where
in
the
deep
*NL*
pond
,
beneath
the
smooth
surface
,
he
might
be
speeding
his
way
like
a
*NL*
fish
,
for
he
had
time
and
ability
to
visit
the
bottom
of
the
pond
in
*NL*
its
deepest
part
.
It
is
said
that
loons
have
been
caught
in
the
New
York
*NL*
lakes
eighty
feet
beneath
the
surface
,
with
hooks
set
for
trout
--
though
*NL*
Walden
is
deeper
than
that
.
How
surprised
must
the
fishes
be
to
see
*NL*
this
ungainly
visitor
from
another
sphere
speeding
his
way
amid
their
*NL*
schools
!
Yet
he
appeared
to
know
his
course
as
surely
under
water
as
on
*NL*
the
surface
,
and
swam
much
faster
there
.
Once
or
twice
I
saw
a
ripple
*NL*
where
he
approached
the
surface
,
just
put
his
head
out
to
reconnoitre
,
*NL*
and
instantly
dived
again
.
I
found
that
it
was
as
well
for
me
to
rest
*NL*
on
my
oars
and
wait
his
reappearing
as
to
endeavor
to
calculate
where
he
*NL*
would
rise
;
for
again
and
again
,
when
I
was
straining
my
eyes
over
the
*NL*
surface
one
way
,
I
would
suddenly
be
startled
by
his
unearthly
laugh
*NL*
behind
me
.
But
why
,
after
displaying
so
much
cunning
,
did
he
invariably
*NL*
betray
himself
the
moment
he
came
up
by
that
loud
laugh
?
Did
not
his
*NL*
white
breast
enough
betray
him
?
He
was
indeed
a
silly
loon
,
I
thought
.
I
*NL*
could
commonly
hear
the
splash
of
the
water
when
he
came
up
,
and
so
also
*NL*
detected
him
.
But
after
an
hour
he
seemed
as
fresh
as
ever
,
dived
as
*NL*
willingly
,
and
swam
yet
farther
than
at
first
.
It
was
surprising
to
see
*NL*
how
serenely
he
sailed
off
with
unruffled
breast
when
he
came
to
the
*NL*
surface
,
doing
all
the
work
with
his
webbed
feet
beneath
.
His
usual
note
*NL*
was
this
demoniac
laughter
,
yet
somewhat
like
that
of
a
water-fowl
;
but
*NL*
occasionally
,
when
he
had
balked
me
most
successfully
and
come
up
a
long
*NL*
way
off
,
he
uttered
a
long-drawn
unearthly
howl
,
probably
more
like
that
*NL*
of
a
wolf
than
any
bird
;
as
when
a
beast
puts
his
muzzle
to
the
ground
*NL*
and
deliberately
howls
.
This
was
his
looning
--
perhaps
the
wildest
sound
*NL*
that
is
ever
heard
here
,
making
the
woods
ring
far
and
wide
.
I
concluded
*NL*
that
he
laughed
in
derision
of
my
efforts
,
confident
of
his
own
*NL*
resources
.
Though
the
sky
was
by
this
time
overcast
,
the
pond
was
so
*NL*
smooth
that
I
could
see
where
he
broke
the
surface
when
I
did
not
hear
*NL*
him
.
His
white
breast
,
the
stillness
of
the
air
,
and
the
smoothness
of
*NL*
the
water
were
all
against
him
.
At
length
having
come
up
fifty
rods
off
,
*NL*
he
uttered
one
of
those
prolonged
howls
,
as
if
calling
on
the
god
of
*NL*
loons
to
aid
him
,
and
immediately
there
came
a
wind
from
the
east
and
*NL*
rippled
the
surface
,
and
filled
the
whole
air
with
misty
rain
,
and
I
was
*NL*
impressed
as
if
it
were
the
prayer
of
the
loon
answered
,
and
his
god
was
*NL*
angry
with
me
;
and
so
I
left
him
disappearing
far
away
on
the
tumultuous
*NL*
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
hours
,
in
fall
days
,
I
watched
the
ducks
cunningly
tack
and
veer
and
*NL*
hold
the
middle
of
the
pond
,
far
from
the
sportsman
;
tricks
which
they
*NL*
will
have
less
need
to
practise
in
Louisiana
bayous
.
When
compelled
to
*NL*
rise
they
would
sometimes
circle
round
and
round
and
over
the
pond
at
a
*NL*
considerable
height
,
from
which
they
could
easily
see
to
other
ponds
*NL*
and
the
river
,
like
black
motes
in
the
sky
;
and
,
when
I
thought
they
had
*NL*
gone
off
thither
long
since
,
they
would
settle
down
by
a
slanting
flight
*NL*
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
to
a
distant
part
which
was
left
free
;
but
*NL*
what
beside
safety
they
got
by
sailing
in
the
middle
of
Walden
I
do
not
*NL*
know
,
unless
they
love
its
water
for
the
same
reason
that
I
do
.
*NL*

House-Warming

In
October
I
went
a-graping
to
the
river
meadows
,
and
loaded
myself
with
*NL*
clusters
more
precious
for
their
beauty
and
fragrance
than
for
food
.
*NL*
There
,
too
,
I
admired
,
though
I
did
not
gather
,
the
cranberries
,
small
*NL*
waxen
gems
,
pendants
of
the
meadow
grass
,
pearly
and
red
,
which
the
*NL*
farmer
plucks
with
an
ugly
rake
,
leaving
the
smooth
meadow
in
a
snarl
,
*NL*
heedlessly
measuring
them
by
the
bushel
and
the
dollar
only
,
and
sells
*NL*
the
spoils
of
the
meads
to
Boston
and
New
York
;
destined
to
be
_
jammed
_
,
*NL*
to
satisfy
the
tastes
of
lovers
of
Nature
there
.
So
butchers
rake
the
*NL*
tongues
of
bison
out
of
the
prairie
grass
,
regardless
of
the
torn
and
*NL*
drooping
plant
.
The
barberry
's
brilliant
fruit
was
likewise
food
for
my
*NL*
eyes
merely
;
but
I
collected
a
small
store
of
wild
apples
for
coddling
,
*NL*
which
the
proprietor
and
travellers
had
overlooked
.
When
chestnuts
were
*NL*
ripe
I
laid
up
half
a
bushel
for
winter
.
It
was
very
exciting
at
that
*NL*
season
to
roam
the
then
boundless
chestnut
woods
of
Lincoln
--
they
now
*NL*
sleep
their
long
sleep
under
the
railroad
--
with
a
bag
on
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
and
a
stick
to
open
burs
with
in
my
hand
,
for
I
did
not
always
wait
for
*NL*
the
frost
,
amid
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
the
loud
reproofs
of
the
red
*NL*
squirrels
and
the
jays
,
whose
half-consumed
nuts
I
sometimes
stole
,
*NL*
for
the
burs
which
they
had
selected
were
sure
to
contain
sound
ones
.
*NL*
Occasionally
I
climbed
and
shook
the
trees
.
They
grew
also
behind
my
*NL*
house
,
and
one
large
tree
,
which
almost
overshadowed
it
,
was
,
when
*NL*
in
flower
,
a
bouquet
which
scented
the
whole
neighborhood
,
but
the
*NL*
squirrels
and
the
jays
got
most
of
its
fruit
;
the
last
coming
in
flocks
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
and
picking
the
nuts
out
of
the
burs
before
they
*NL*
fell
,
I
relinquished
these
trees
to
them
and
visited
the
more
distant
*NL*
woods
composed
wholly
of
chestnut
.
These
nuts
,
as
far
as
they
went
,
were
*NL*
a
good
substitute
for
bread
.
Many
other
substitutes
might
,
perhaps
,
be
*NL*
found
.
Digging
one
day
for
fishworms
,
I
discovered
the
ground-nut
*NL*
-LRB-
_
Apios
tuberosa
_
-RRB-
on
its
string
,
the
potato
of
the
aborigines
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
fabulous
fruit
,
which
I
had
begun
to
doubt
if
I
had
ever
dug
and
eaten
*NL*
in
childhood
,
as
I
had
told
,
and
had
not
dreamed
it
.
I
had
often
since
*NL*
seen
its
crumpled
red
velvety
blossom
supported
by
the
stems
of
other
*NL*
plants
without
knowing
it
to
be
the
same
.
Cultivation
has
well-nigh
*NL*
exterminated
it
.
It
has
a
sweetish
taste
,
much
like
that
of
a
*NL*
frost-bitten
potato
,
and
I
found
it
better
boiled
than
roasted
.
This
*NL*
tuber
seemed
like
a
faint
promise
of
Nature
to
rear
her
own
children
*NL*
and
feed
them
simply
here
at
some
future
period
.
In
these
days
of
fatted
*NL*
cattle
and
waving
grain-fields
this
humble
root
,
which
was
once
the
*NL*
_
totem
_
of
an
Indian
tribe
,
is
quite
forgotten
,
or
known
only
by
its
*NL*
flowering
vine
;
but
let
wild
Nature
reign
here
once
more
,
and
the
tender
*NL*
and
luxurious
English
grains
will
probably
disappear
before
a
myriad
of
*NL*
foes
,
and
without
the
care
of
man
the
crow
may
carry
back
even
the
*NL*
last
seed
of
corn
to
the
great
cornfield
of
the
Indian
's
God
in
the
*NL*
southwest
,
whence
he
is
said
to
have
brought
it
;
but
the
now
almost
*NL*
exterminated
ground-nut
will
perhaps
revive
and
flourish
in
spite
of
*NL*
frosts
and
wildness
,
prove
itself
indigenous
,
and
resume
its
ancient
*NL*
importance
and
dignity
as
the
diet
of
the
hunter
tribe
.
Some
Indian
*NL*
Ceres
or
Minerva
must
have
been
the
inventor
and
bestower
of
it
;
and
*NL*
when
the
reign
of
poetry
commences
here
,
its
leaves
and
string
of
nuts
*NL*
may
be
represented
on
our
works
of
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
,
by
the
first
of
September
,
I
had
seen
two
or
three
small
maples
*NL*
turned
scarlet
across
the
pond
,
beneath
where
the
white
stems
of
three
*NL*
aspens
diverged
,
at
the
point
of
a
promontory
,
next
the
water
.
Ah
,
many
*NL*
a
tale
their
color
told
!
And
gradually
from
week
to
week
the
character
*NL*
of
each
tree
came
out
,
and
it
admired
itself
reflected
in
the
smooth
*NL*
mirror
of
the
lake
.
Each
morning
the
manager
of
this
gallery
substituted
*NL*
some
new
picture
,
distinguished
by
more
brilliant
or
harmonious
*NL*
coloring
,
for
the
old
upon
the
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wasps
came
by
thousands
to
my
lodge
in
October
,
as
to
winter
*NL*
quarters
,
and
settled
on
my
windows
within
and
on
the
walls
overhead
,
*NL*
sometimes
deterring
visitors
from
entering
.
Each
morning
,
when
they
were
*NL*
numbed
with
cold
,
I
swept
some
of
them
out
,
but
I
did
not
trouble
myself
*NL*
much
to
get
rid
of
them
;
I
even
felt
complimented
by
their
regarding
my
*NL*
house
as
a
desirable
shelter
.
They
never
molested
me
seriously
,
though
*NL*
they
bedded
with
me
;
and
they
gradually
disappeared
,
into
what
crevices
*NL*
I
do
not
know
,
avoiding
winter
and
unspeakable
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
the
wasps
,
before
I
finally
went
into
winter
quarters
in
November
,
*NL*
I
used
to
resort
to
the
northeast
side
of
Walden
,
which
the
sun
,
*NL*
reflected
from
the
pitch
pine
woods
and
the
stony
shore
,
made
the
*NL*
fireside
of
the
pond
;
it
is
so
much
pleasanter
and
wholesomer
to
be
*NL*
warmed
by
the
sun
while
you
can
be
,
than
by
an
artificial
fire
.
I
thus
*NL*
warmed
myself
by
the
still
glowing
embers
which
the
summer
,
like
a
*NL*
departed
hunter
,
had
left
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
build
my
chimney
I
studied
masonry
.
My
bricks
,
being
*NL*
second-hand
ones
,
required
to
be
cleaned
with
a
trowel
,
so
that
I
*NL*
learned
more
than
usual
of
the
qualities
of
bricks
and
trowels
.
The
*NL*
mortar
on
them
was
fifty
years
old
,
and
was
said
to
be
still
growing
*NL*
harder
;
but
this
is
one
of
those
sayings
which
men
love
to
repeat
*NL*
whether
they
are
true
or
not
.
Such
sayings
themselves
grow
harder
and
*NL*
adhere
more
firmly
with
age
,
and
it
would
take
many
blows
with
a
trowel
*NL*
to
clean
an
old
wiseacre
of
them
.
Many
of
the
villages
of
Mesopotamia
*NL*
are
built
of
second-hand
bricks
of
a
very
good
quality
,
obtained
from
*NL*
the
ruins
of
Babylon
,
and
the
cement
on
them
is
older
and
probably
*NL*
harder
still
.
However
that
may
be
,
I
was
struck
by
the
peculiar
*NL*
toughness
of
the
steel
which
bore
so
many
violent
blows
without
being
*NL*
worn
out
.
As
my
bricks
had
been
in
a
chimney
before
,
though
I
did
not
*NL*
read
the
name
of
Nebuchadnezzar
on
them
,
I
picked
out
as
many
fireplace
*NL*
bricks
as
I
could
find
,
to
save
work
and
waste
,
and
I
filled
the
spaces
*NL*
between
the
bricks
about
the
fireplace
with
stones
from
the
pond
shore
,
*NL*
and
also
made
my
mortar
with
the
white
sand
from
the
same
place
.
I
*NL*
lingered
most
about
the
fireplace
,
as
the
most
vital
part
of
the
house
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
worked
so
deliberately
,
that
though
I
commenced
at
the
ground
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
a
course
of
bricks
raised
a
few
inches
above
the
floor
*NL*
served
for
my
pillow
at
night
;
yet
I
did
not
get
a
stiff
neck
for
it
*NL*
that
I
remember
;
my
stiff
neck
is
of
older
date
.
I
took
a
poet
to
board
*NL*
for
a
fortnight
about
those
times
,
which
caused
me
to
be
put
to
it
for
*NL*
room
.
He
brought
his
own
knife
,
though
I
had
two
,
and
we
used
to
scour
*NL*
them
by
thrusting
them
into
the
earth
.
He
shared
with
me
the
labors
*NL*
of
cooking
.
I
was
pleased
to
see
my
work
rising
so
square
and
solid
by
*NL*
degrees
,
and
reflected
,
that
,
if
it
proceeded
slowly
,
it
was
calculated
*NL*
to
endure
a
long
time
.
The
chimney
is
to
some
extent
an
independent
*NL*
structure
,
standing
on
the
ground
,
and
rising
through
the
house
to
the
*NL*
heavens
;
even
after
the
house
is
burned
it
still
stands
sometimes
,
and
*NL*
its
importance
and
independence
are
apparent
.
This
was
toward
the
end
of
*NL*
summer
.
It
was
now
November
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
The
north
wind
had
already
begun
to
cool
the
pond
,
though
it
took
many
*NL*
weeks
of
steady
blowing
to
accomplish
it
,
it
is
so
deep
.
When
I
began
to
*NL*
have
a
fire
at
evening
,
before
I
plastered
my
house
,
the
chimney
carried
*NL*
smoke
particularly
well
,
because
of
the
numerous
chinks
between
the
*NL*
boards
.
Yet
I
passed
some
cheerful
evenings
in
that
cool
and
airy
*NL*
apartment
,
surrounded
by
the
rough
brown
boards
full
of
knots
,
and
*NL*
rafters
with
the
bark
on
high
overhead
.
My
house
never
pleased
my
eye
so
*NL*
much
after
it
was
plastered
,
though
I
was
obliged
to
confess
that
it
*NL*
was
more
comfortable
.
Should
not
every
apartment
in
which
man
dwells
be
*NL*
lofty
enough
to
create
some
obscurity
overhead
,
where
flickering
shadows
*NL*
may
play
at
evening
about
the
rafters
?
These
forms
are
more
agreeable
*NL*
to
the
fancy
and
imagination
than
fresco
paintings
or
other
the
most
*NL*
expensive
furniture
.
I
now
first
began
to
inhabit
my
house
,
I
may
say
,
*NL*
when
I
began
to
use
it
for
warmth
as
well
as
shelter
.
I
had
got
a
couple
*NL*
of
old
fire-dogs
to
keep
the
wood
from
the
hearth
,
and
it
did
me
good
*NL*
to
see
the
soot
form
on
the
back
of
the
chimney
which
I
had
built
,
and
*NL*
I
poked
the
fire
with
more
right
and
more
satisfaction
than
usual
.
My
*NL*
dwelling
was
small
,
and
I
could
hardly
entertain
an
echo
in
it
;
but
it
*NL*
seemed
larger
for
being
a
single
apartment
and
remote
from
neighbors
.
*NL*
All
the
attractions
of
a
house
were
concentrated
in
one
room
;
it
was
*NL*
kitchen
,
chamber
,
parlor
,
and
keeping-room
;
and
whatever
satisfaction
*NL*
parent
or
child
,
master
or
servant
,
derive
from
living
in
a
house
,
I
*NL*
enjoyed
it
all
.
Cato
says
,
the
master
of
a
family
-LRB-
_
patremfamilias
_
-RRB-
must
*NL*
have
in
his
rustic
villa
``
cellam
oleariam

vinariam
,

,
uti
*NL*
lubeat
caritatem

''
that
*NL*
is
,
``
an
oil
and
wine
cellar
,
many
casks
,
so
that
it
may
be
pleasant
to
*NL*
expect
hard
times
;
it
will
be
for
his
advantage
,
and
virtue
,
and
glory
.

*NL*
I
had
in
my
cellar
a
firkin
of
potatoes
,
about
two
quarts
of
peas
with
*NL*
the
weevil
in
them
,
and
on
my
shelf
a
little
rice
,
a
jug
of
molasses
,
*NL*
and
of
rye
and
Indian
meal
a
peck
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sometimes
dream
of
a
larger
and
more
populous
house
,
standing
in
a
*NL*
golden
age
,
of
enduring
materials
,
and
without
gingerbread
work
,
*NL*
which
shall
still
consist
of
only
one
room
,
a
vast
,
rude
,
substantial
,
*NL*
primitive
hall
,
without
ceiling
or
plastering
,
with
bare
rafters
and
*NL*
purlins
supporting
a
sort
of
lower
heaven
over
one
's
head
--
useful
to
*NL*
keep
off
rain
and
snow
,
where
the
king
and
queen
posts
stand
out
to
*NL*
receive
your
homage
,
when
you
have
done
reverence
to
the
prostrate
*NL*
Saturn
of
an
older
dynasty
on
stepping
over
the
sill
;
a
cavernous
house
,
*NL*
wherein
you
must
reach
up
a
torch
upon
a
pole
to
see
the
roof
;
where
*NL*
some
may
live
in
the
fireplace
,
some
in
the
recess
of
a
window
,
and
some
*NL*
on
settles
,
some
at
one
end
of
the
hall
,
some
at
another
,
and
some
aloft
*NL*
on
rafters
with
the
spiders
,
if
they
choose
;
a
house
which
you
have
got
*NL*
into
when
you
have
opened
the
outside
door
,
and
the
ceremony
is
over
;
*NL*
where
the
weary
traveller
may
wash
,
and
eat
,
and
converse
,
and
sleep
,
*NL*
without
further
journey
;
such
a
shelter
as
you
would
be
glad
to
reach
*NL*
in
a
tempestuous
night
,
containing
all
the
essentials
of
a
house
,
and
*NL*
nothing
for
house-keeping
;
where
you
can
see
all
the
treasures
of
the
*NL*
house
at
one
view
,
and
everything
hangs
upon
its
peg
,
that
a
man
should
*NL*
use
;
at
once
kitchen
,
pantry
,
parlor
,
chamber
,
storehouse
,
and
garret
;
*NL*
where
you
can
see
so
necessary
a
thing
,
as
a
barrel
or
a
ladder
,
so
*NL*
convenient
a
thing
as
a
cupboard
,
and
hear
the
pot
boil
,
and
pay
your
*NL*
respects
to
the
fire
that
cooks
your
dinner
,
and
the
oven
that
bakes
*NL*
your
bread
,
and
the
necessary
furniture
and
utensils
are
the
chief
*NL*
ornaments
;
where
the
washing
is
not
put
out
,
nor
the
fire
,
nor
the
*NL*
mistress
,
and
perhaps
you
are
sometimes
requested
to
move
from
off
the
*NL*
trap-door
,
when
the
cook
would
descend
into
the
cellar
,
and
so
learn
*NL*
whether
the
ground
is
solid
or
hollow
beneath
you
without
stamping
.
A
*NL*
house
whose
inside
is
as
open
and
manifest
as
a
bird
's
nest
,
and
you
*NL*
can
not
go
in
at
the
front
door
and
out
at
the
back
without
seeing
some
*NL*
of
its
inhabitants
;
where
to
be
a
guest
is
to
be
presented
with
the
*NL*
freedom
of
the
house
,
and
not
to
be
carefully
excluded
from
seven
*NL*
eighths
of
it
,
shut
up
in
a
particular
cell
,
and
told
to
make
yourself
*NL*
at
home
there
--
in
solitary
confinement
.
Nowadays
the
host
does
not
*NL*
admit
you
to
_
his
_
hearth
,
but
has
got
the
mason
to
build
one
for
yourself
*NL*
somewhere
in
his
alley
,
and
hospitality
is
the
art
of
_
keeping
_
you
at
the
*NL*
greatest
distance
.
There
is
as
much
secrecy
about
the
cooking
as
if
he
*NL*
had
a
design
to
poison
you
.
I
am
aware
that
I
have
been
on
many
a
man
's
*NL*
premises
,
and
might
have
been
legally
ordered
off
,
but
I
am
not
aware
*NL*
that
I
have
been
in
many
men
's
houses
.
I
might
visit
in
my
old
clothes
a
*NL*
king
and
queen
who
lived
simply
in
such
a
house
as
I
have
described
,
if
*NL*
I
were
going
their
way
;
but
backing
out
of
a
modern
palace
will
be
all
*NL*
that
I
shall
desire
to
learn
,
if
ever
I
am
caught
in
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
as
if
the
very
language
of
our
parlors
would
lose
all
*NL*
its
nerve
and
degenerate
into
_
palaver
_
wholly
,
our
lives
pass
at
*NL*
such
remoteness
from
its
symbols
,
and
its
metaphors
and
tropes
are
*NL*
necessarily
so
far
fetched
,
through
slides
and
dumb-waiters
,
as
it
were
;
*NL*
in
other
words
,
the
parlor
is
so
far
from
the
kitchen
and
workshop
.
The
*NL*
dinner
even
is
only
the
parable
of
a
dinner
,
commonly
.
As
if
only
the
*NL*
savage
dwelt
near
enough
to
Nature
and
Truth
to
borrow
a
trope
from
*NL*
them
.
How
can
the
scholar
,
who
dwells
away
in
the
North
West
Territory
*NL*
or
the
Isle
of
Man
,
tell
what
is
parliamentary
in
the
kitchen
?
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
only
one
or
two
of
my
guests
were
ever
bold
enough
to
stay
and
*NL*
eat
a
hasty-pudding
with
me
;
but
when
they
saw
that
crisis
approaching
*NL*
they
beat
a
hasty
retreat
rather
,
as
if
it
would
shake
the
house
to
its
*NL*
foundations
.
Nevertheless
,
it
stood
through
a
great
many
hasty-puddings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
plaster
till
it
was
freezing
weather
.
I
brought
over
some
*NL*
whiter
and
cleaner
sand
for
this
purpose
from
the
opposite
shore
of
the
*NL*
pond
in
a
boat
,
a
sort
of
conveyance
which
would
have
tempted
me
to
go
*NL*
much
farther
if
necessary
.
My
house
had
in
the
meanwhile
been
shingled
*NL*
down
to
the
ground
on
every
side
.
In
lathing
I
was
pleased
to
be
able
*NL*
to
send
home
each
nail
with
a
single
blow
of
the
hammer
,
and
it
was
my
*NL*
ambition
to
transfer
the
plaster
from
the
board
to
the
wall
neatly
and
*NL*
rapidly
.
I
remembered
the
story
of
a
conceited
fellow
,
who
,
in
fine
*NL*
clothes
,
was
wont
to
lounge
about
the
village
once
,
giving
advice
to
*NL*
workmen
.
Venturing
one
day
to
substitute
deeds
for
words
,
he
turned
*NL*
up
his
cuffs
,
seized
a
plasterer
's
board
,
and
having
loaded
his
trowel
*NL*
without
mishap
,
with
a
complacent
look
toward
the
lathing
overhead
,
*NL*
made
a
bold
gesture
thitherward
;
and
straightway
,
to
his
complete
*NL*
discomfiture
,
received
the
whole
contents
in
his
ruffled
bosom
.
I
*NL*
admired
anew
the
economy
and
convenience
of
plastering
,
which
so
*NL*
effectually
shuts
out
the
cold
and
takes
a
handsome
finish
,
and
I
*NL*
learned
the
various
casualties
to
which
the
plasterer
is
liable
.
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
see
how
thirsty
the
bricks
were
which
drank
up
all
the
*NL*
moisture
in
my
plaster
before
I
had
smoothed
it
,
and
how
many
pailfuls
*NL*
of
water
it
takes
to
christen
a
new
hearth
.
I
had
the
previous
winter
*NL*
made
a
small
quantity
of
lime
by
burning
the
shells
of
the
_
Unio
*NL*
fluviatilis
_
,
which
our
river
affords
,
for
the
sake
of
the
experiment
;
*NL*
so
that
I
knew
where
my
materials
came
from
.
I
might
have
got
good
*NL*
limestone
within
a
mile
or
two
and
burned
it
myself
,
if
I
had
cared
to
*NL*
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
pond
had
in
the
meanwhile
skimmed
over
in
the
shadiest
and
*NL*
shallowest
coves
,
some
days
or
even
weeks
before
the
general
freezing
.
*NL*
The
first
ice
is
especially
interesting
and
perfect
,
being
hard
,
dark
,
*NL*
and
transparent
,
and
affords
the
best
opportunity
that
ever
offers
for
*NL*
examining
the
bottom
where
it
is
shallow
;
for
you
can
lie
at
your
length
*NL*
on
ice
only
an
inch
thick
,
like
a
skater
insect
on
the
surface
of
the
*NL*
water
,
and
study
the
bottom
at
your
leisure
,
only
two
or
three
inches
*NL*
distant
,
like
a
picture
behind
a
glass
,
and
the
water
is
necessarily
*NL*
always
smooth
then
.
There
are
many
furrows
in
the
sand
where
some
*NL*
creature
has
travelled
about
and
doubled
on
its
tracks
;
and
,
for
wrecks
,
*NL*
it
is
strewn
with
the
cases
of
caddis-worms
made
of
minute
grains
of
*NL*
white
quartz
.
Perhaps
these
have
creased
it
,
for
you
find
some
of
their
*NL*
cases
in
the
furrows
,
though
they
are
deep
and
broad
for
them
to
make
.
*NL*
But
the
ice
itself
is
the
object
of
most
interest
,
though
you
must
*NL*
improve
the
earliest
opportunity
to
study
it
.
If
you
examine
it
closely
*NL*
the
morning
after
it
freezes
,
you
find
that
the
greater
part
of
the
*NL*
bubbles
,
which
at
first
appeared
to
be
within
it
,
are
against
its
under
*NL*
surface
,
and
that
more
are
continually
rising
from
the
bottom
;
while
the
*NL*
ice
is
as
yet
comparatively
solid
and
dark
,
that
is
,
you
see
the
water
*NL*
through
it
.
These
bubbles
are
from
an
eightieth
to
an
eighth
of
an
inch
*NL*
in
diameter
,
very
clear
and
beautiful
,
and
you
see
your
face
reflected
*NL*
in
them
through
the
ice
.
There
may
be
thirty
or
forty
of
them
to
*NL*
a
square
inch
.
There
are
also
already
within
the
ice
narrow
oblong
*NL*
perpendicular
bubbles
about
half
an
inch
long
,
sharp
cones
with
the
apex
*NL*
upward
;
or
oftener
,
if
the
ice
is
quite
fresh
,
minute
spherical
bubbles
*NL*
one
directly
above
another
,
like
a
string
of
beads
.
But
these
within
the
*NL*
ice
are
not
so
numerous
nor
obvious
as
those
beneath
.
I
sometimes
used
*NL*
to
cast
on
stones
to
try
the
strength
of
the
ice
,
and
those
which
*NL*
broke
through
carried
in
air
with
them
,
which
formed
very
large
and
*NL*
conspicuous
white
bubbles
beneath
.
One
day
when
I
came
to
the
same
place
*NL*
forty-eight
hours
afterward
,
I
found
that
those
large
bubbles
were
*NL*
still
perfect
,
though
an
inch
more
of
ice
had
formed
,
as
I
could
see
*NL*
distinctly
by
the
seam
in
the
edge
of
a
cake
.
But
as
the
last
two
*NL*
days
had
been
very
warm
,
like
an
Indian
summer
,
the
ice
was
not
now
*NL*
transparent
,
showing
the
dark
green
color
of
the
water
,
and
the
bottom
,
*NL*
but
opaque
and
whitish
or
gray
,
and
though
twice
as
thick
was
hardly
*NL*
stronger
than
before
,
for
the
air
bubbles
had
greatly
expanded
under
*NL*
this
heat
and
run
together
,
and
lost
their
regularity
;
they
were
no
*NL*
longer
one
directly
over
another
,
but
often
like
silvery
coins
poured
*NL*
from
a
bag
,
one
overlapping
another
,
or
in
thin
flakes
,
as
if
occupying
*NL*
slight
cleavages
.
The
beauty
of
the
ice
was
gone
,
and
it
was
too
late
to
*NL*
study
the
bottom
.
Being
curious
to
know
what
position
my
great
bubbles
*NL*
occupied
with
regard
to
the
new
ice
,
I
broke
out
a
cake
containing
a
*NL*
middling
sized
one
,
and
turned
it
bottom
upward
.
The
new
ice
had
formed
*NL*
around
and
under
the
bubble
,
so
that
it
was
included
between
the
two
*NL*
ices
.
It
was
wholly
in
the
lower
ice
,
but
close
against
the
upper
,
and
*NL*
was
flattish
,
or
perhaps
slightly
lenticular
,
with
a
rounded
edge
,
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
by
four
inches
in
diameter
;
and
I
was
surprised
*NL*
to
find
that
directly
under
the
bubble
the
ice
was
melted
with
great
*NL*
regularity
in
the
form
of
a
saucer
reversed
,
to
the
height
of
five
*NL*
eighths
of
an
inch
in
the
middle
,
leaving
a
thin
partition
there
between
*NL*
the
water
and
the
bubble
,
hardly
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
;
and
in
many
*NL*
places
the
small
bubbles
in
this
partition
had
burst
out
downward
,
and
*NL*
probably
there
was
no
ice
at
all
under
the
largest
bubbles
,
which
were
a
*NL*
foot
in
diameter
.
I
inferred
that
the
infinite
number
of
minute
bubbles
*NL*
which
I
had
first
seen
against
the
under
surface
of
the
ice
were
now
*NL*
frozen
in
likewise
,
and
that
each
,
in
its
degree
,
had
operated
like
*NL*
a
burning-glass
on
the
ice
beneath
to
melt
and
rot
it
.
These
are
the
*NL*
little
air-guns
which
contribute
to
make
the
ice
crack
and
whoop
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
At
length
the
winter
set
in
good
earnest
,
just
as
I
had
finished
*NL*
plastering
,
and
the
wind
began
to
howl
around
the
house
as
if
it
had
*NL*
not
had
permission
to
do
so
till
then
.
Night
after
night
the
geese
came
*NL*
lumbering
in
the
dark
with
a
clangor
and
a
whistling
of
wings
,
even
*NL*
after
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
,
some
to
alight
in
Walden
,
and
*NL*
some
flying
low
over
the
woods
toward
Fair
Haven
,
bound
for
Mexico
.
*NL*
Several
times
,
when
returning
from
the
village
at
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
*NL*
at
night
,
I
heard
the
tread
of
a
flock
of
geese
,
or
else
ducks
,
on
the
*NL*
dry
leaves
in
the
woods
by
a
pond-hole
behind
my
dwelling
,
where
they
*NL*
had
come
up
to
feed
,
and
the
faint
honk
or
quack
of
their
leader
as
they
*NL*
hurried
off
.
In
1845
Walden
froze
entirely
over
for
the
first
time
on
*NL*
the
night
of
the
22d
of
December
,
Flint
's
and
other
shallower
ponds
and
*NL*
the
river
having
been
frozen
ten
days
or
more
;
in
'
46
,
the
16th
;
in
'
49
,
*NL*
about
the
31st
;
and
in
'
50
,
about
the
27th
of
December
;
in
'
52
,
the
5th
*NL*
of
January
;
in
'
53
,
the
31st
of
December
.
The
snow
had
already
covered
*NL*
the
ground
since
the
25th
of
November
,
and
surrounded
me
suddenly
*NL*
with
the
scenery
of
winter
.
I
withdrew
yet
farther
into
my
shell
,
and
*NL*
endeavored
to
keep
a
bright
fire
both
within
my
house
and
within
my
*NL*
breast
.
My
employment
out
of
doors
now
was
to
collect
the
dead
wood
in
*NL*
the
forest
,
bringing
it
in
my
hands
or
on
my
shoulders
,
or
sometimes
*NL*
trailing
a
dead
pine
tree
under
each
arm
to
my
shed
.
An
old
forest
fence
*NL*
which
had
seen
its
best
days
was
a
great
haul
for
me
.
I
sacrificed
it
*NL*
to
Vulcan
,
for
it
was
past
serving
the
god
Terminus
.
How
much
more
*NL*
interesting
an
event
is
that
man
's
supper
who
has
just
been
forth
in
the
*NL*
snow
to
hunt
,
nay
,
you
might
say
,
steal
,
the
fuel
to
cook
it
with
!
His
*NL*
bread
and
meat
are
sweet
.
There
are
enough
fagots
and
waste
wood
of
all
*NL*
kinds
in
the
forests
of
most
of
our
towns
to
support
many
fires
,
but
*NL*
which
at
present
warm
none
,
and
,
some
think
,
hinder
the
growth
of
the
*NL*
young
wood
.
There
was
also
the
driftwood
of
the
pond
.
In
the
course
of
*NL*
the
summer
I
had
discovered
a
raft
of
pitch
pine
logs
with
the
bark
on
,
*NL*
pinned
together
by
the
Irish
when
the
railroad
was
built
.
This
I
hauled
*NL*
up
partly
on
the
shore
.
After
soaking
two
years
and
then
lying
high
six
*NL*
months
it
was
perfectly
sound
,
though
waterlogged
past
drying
.
I
amused
*NL*
myself
one
winter
day
with
sliding
this
piecemeal
across
the
pond
,
*NL*
nearly
half
a
mile
,
skating
behind
with
one
end
of
a
log
fifteen
feet
*NL*
long
on
my
shoulder
,
and
the
other
on
the
ice
;
or
I
tied
several
logs
*NL*
together
with
a
birch
withe
,
and
then
,
with
a
longer
birch
or
alder
*NL*
which
had
a
hook
at
the
end
,
dragged
them
across
.
Though
completely
*NL*
waterlogged
and
almost
as
heavy
as
lead
,
they
not
only
burned
long
,
but
*NL*
made
a
very
hot
fire
;
nay
,
I
thought
that
they
burned
better
for
the
*NL*
soaking
,
as
if
the
pitch
,
being
confined
by
the
water
,
burned
longer
,
as
*NL*
in
a
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gilpin
,
in
his
account
of
the
forest
borderers
of
England
,
says
that
*NL*
``
the
encroachments
of
trespassers
,
and
the
houses
and
fences
thus
raised
*NL*
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
,
''
were
``
considered
as
great
nuisances
*NL*
by
the
old
forest
law
,
and
were
severely
punished
under
the
name
of
*NL*
_
purprestures
_
,
as
tending
_
ad
terrorem
ferarum
--
ad
nocumentum
forestae
_
,
*NL*
etc.
,
''
to
the
frightening
of
the
game
and
the
detriment
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
But
I
was
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
venison
and
the
vert
*NL*
more
than
the
hunters
or
woodchoppers
,
and
as
much
as
though
I
had
been
*NL*
the
Lord
Warden
himself
;
and
if
any
part
was
burned
,
though
I
burned
it
*NL*
myself
by
accident
,
I
grieved
with
a
grief
that
lasted
longer
and
was
*NL*
more
inconsolable
than
that
of
the
proprietors
;
nay
,
I
grieved
when
it
*NL*
was
cut
down
by
the
proprietors
themselves
.
I
would
that
our
farmers
*NL*
when
they
cut
down
a
forest
felt
some
of
that
awe
which
the
old
Romans
*NL*
did
when
they
came
to
thin
,
or
let
in
the
light
to
,
a
consecrated
grove
*NL*
-LRB-
_
lucum
conlucare
_
-RRB-
,
that
is
,
would
believe
that
it
is
sacred
to
some
*NL*
god
.
The
Roman
made
an
expiatory
offering
,
and
prayed
,
Whatever
god
or
*NL*
goddess
thou
art
to
whom
this
grove
is
sacred
,
be
propitious
to
me
,
my
*NL*
family
,
and
children
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
remarkable
what
a
value
is
still
put
upon
wood
even
in
this
age
*NL*
and
in
this
new
country
,
a
value
more
permanent
and
universal
than
that
*NL*
of
gold
.
After
all
our
discoveries
and
inventions
no
man
will
go
by
a
*NL*
pile
of
wood
.
It
is
as
precious
to
us
as
it
was
to
our
Saxon
and
Norman
*NL*
ancestors
.
If
they
made
their
bows
of
it
,
we
make
our
gun-stocks
of
it
.
*NL*
Michaux
,
more
than
thirty
years
ago
,
says
that
the
price
of
wood
for
*NL*
fuel
in
New
York
and
Philadelphia
``
nearly
equals
,
and
sometimes
exceeds
,
*NL*
that
of
the
best
wood
in
Paris
,
though
this
immense
capital
annually
*NL*
requires
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
cords
,
and
is
surrounded
to
*NL*
the
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
by
cultivated
plains
.
''
In
this
town
*NL*
the
price
of
wood
rises
almost
steadily
,
and
the
only
question
is
,
how
*NL*
much
higher
it
is
to
be
this
year
than
it
was
the
last
.
Mechanics
and
*NL*
tradesmen
who
come
in
person
to
the
forest
on
no
other
errand
,
are
sure
*NL*
to
attend
the
wood
auction
,
and
even
pay
a
high
price
for
the
privilege
*NL*
of
gleaning
after
the
woodchopper
.
It
is
now
many
years
that
men
have
*NL*
resorted
to
the
forest
for
fuel
and
the
materials
of
the
arts
:
the
New
*NL*
Englander
and
the
New
Hollander
,
the
Parisian
and
the
Celt
,
the
farmer
*NL*
and
Robin
Hood
,
Goody
Blake
and
Harry
Gill
;
in
most
parts
of
the
world
*NL*
the
prince
and
the
peasant
,
the
scholar
and
the
savage
,
equally
require
*NL*
still
a
few
sticks
from
the
forest
to
warm
them
and
cook
their
food
.
*NL*
Neither
could
I
do
without
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
man
looks
at
his
wood-pile
with
a
kind
of
affection
.
I
love
to
*NL*
have
mine
before
my
window
,
and
the
more
chips
the
better
to
remind
me
*NL*
of
my
pleasing
work
.
I
had
an
old
axe
which
nobody
claimed
,
with
which
*NL*
by
spells
in
winter
days
,
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
house
,
I
played
about
*NL*
the
stumps
which
I
had
got
out
of
my
bean-field
.
As
my
driver
prophesied
*NL*
when
I
was
plowing
,
they
warmed
me
twice
--
once
while
I
was
splitting
*NL*
them
,
and
again
when
they
were
on
the
fire
,
so
that
no
fuel
could
*NL*
give
out
more
heat
.
As
for
the
axe
,
I
was
advised
to
get
the
village
*NL*
blacksmith
to
``
jump
''
it
;
but
I
jumped
him
,
and
,
putting
a
hickory
helve
*NL*
from
the
woods
into
it
,
made
it
do
.
If
it
was
dull
,
it
was
at
least
hung
*NL*
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
pieces
of
fat
pine
were
a
great
treasure
.
It
is
interesting
to
*NL*
remember
how
much
of
this
food
for
fire
is
still
concealed
in
the
bowels
*NL*
of
the
earth
.
In
previous
years
I
had
often
gone
prospecting
over
some
*NL*
bare
hillside
,
where
a
pitch
pine
wood
had
formerly
stood
,
and
got
out
*NL*
the
fat
pine
roots
.
They
are
almost
indestructible
.
Stumps
thirty
or
*NL*
forty
years
old
,
at
least
,
will
still
be
sound
at
the
core
,
though
the
*NL*
sapwood
has
all
become
vegetable
mould
,
as
appears
by
the
scales
of
*NL*
the
thick
bark
forming
a
ring
level
with
the
earth
four
or
five
inches
*NL*
distant
from
the
heart
.
With
axe
and
shovel
you
explore
this
mine
,
and
*NL*
follow
the
marrowy
store
,
yellow
as
beef
tallow
,
or
as
if
you
had
struck
*NL*
on
a
vein
of
gold
,
deep
into
the
earth
.
But
commonly
I
kindled
my
fire
*NL*
with
the
dry
leaves
of
the
forest
,
which
I
had
stored
up
in
my
shed
*NL*
before
the
snow
came
.
Green
hickory
finely
split
makes
the
woodchopper
's
*NL*
kindlings
,
when
he
has
a
camp
in
the
woods
.
Once
in
a
while
I
got
a
*NL*
little
of
this
.
When
the
villagers
were
lighting
their
fires
beyond
the
*NL*
horizon
,
I
too
gave
notice
to
the
various
wild
inhabitants
of
Walden
*NL*
vale
,
by
a
smoky
streamer
from
my
chimney
,
that
I
was
awake
.

though
I
used
but
little
of
that
,
answered
my
*NL*
purpose
better
than
any
other
.
I
sometimes
left
a
good
fire
when
I
went
*NL*
to
take
a
walk
in
a
winter
afternoon
;
and
when
I
returned
,
three
or
four
*NL*
hours
afterward
,
it
would
be
still
alive
and
glowing
.
My
house
was
not
*NL*
empty
though
I
was
gone
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
left
a
cheerful
housekeeper
*NL*
behind
.
It
was
I
and
Fire
that
lived
there
;
and
commonly
my
housekeeper
*NL*
proved
trustworthy
.
One
day
,
however
,
as
I
was
splitting
wood
,
I
thought
*NL*
that
I
would
just
look
in
at
the
window
and
see
if
the
house
was
not
on
*NL*
fire
;
it
was
the
only
time
I
remember
to
have
been
particularly
anxious
*NL*
on
this
score
;
so
I
looked
and
saw
that
a
spark
had
caught
my
bed
,
and
*NL*
I
went
in
and
extinguished
it
when
it
had
burned
a
place
as
big
as
my
*NL*
hand
.
But
my
house
occupied
so
sunny
and
sheltered
a
position
,
and
*NL*
its
roof
was
so
low
,
that
I
could
afford
to
let
the
fire
go
out
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
almost
any
winter
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moles
nested
in
my
cellar
,
nibbling
every
third
potato
,
and
making
*NL*
a
snug
bed
even
there
of
some
hair
left
after
plastering
and
of
brown
*NL*
paper
;
for
even
the
wildest
animals
love
comfort
and
warmth
as
well
as
*NL*
man
,
and
they
survive
the
winter
only
because
they
are
so
careful
to
*NL*
secure
them
.
Some
of
my
friends
spoke
as
if
I
was
coming
to
the
woods
on
*NL*
purpose
to
freeze
myself
.
The
animal
merely
makes
a
bed
,
which
he
warms
*NL*
with
his
body
,
in
a
sheltered
place
;
but
man
,
having
discovered
fire
,
*NL*
boxes
up
some
air
in
a
spacious
apartment
,
and
warms
that
,
instead
of
*NL*
robbing
himself
,
makes
that
his
bed
,
in
which
he
can
move
about
divested
*NL*
of
more
cumbrous
clothing
,
maintain
a
kind
of
summer
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
winter
,
and
by
means
of
windows
even
admit
the
light
,
and
with
a
lamp
*NL*
lengthen
out
the
day
.
Thus
he
goes
a
step
or
two
beyond
instinct
,
and
*NL*
saves
a
little
time
for
the
fine
arts
.
Though
,
when
I
had
been
exposed
*NL*
to
the
rudest
blasts
a
long
time
,
my
whole
body
began
to
grow
torpid
,
*NL*
when
I
reached
the
genial
atmosphere
of
my
house
I
soon
recovered
my
*NL*
faculties
and
prolonged
my
life
.
But
the
most
luxuriously
housed
has
*NL*
little
to
boast
of
in
this
respect
,
nor
need
we
trouble
ourselves
to
*NL*
speculate
how
the
human
race
may
be
at
last
destroyed
.
It
would
be
*NL*
easy
to
cut
their
threads
any
time
with
a
little
sharper
blast
from
the
*NL*
north
.
We
go
on
dating
from
Cold
Fridays
and
Great
Snows
;
but
a
little
*NL*
colder
Friday
,
or
greater
snow
would
put
a
period
to
man
's
existence
on
*NL*
the
globe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
winter
I
used
a
small
cooking-stove
for
economy
,
since
I
*NL*
did
not
own
the
forest
;
but
it
did
not
keep
fire
so
well
as
the
open
*NL*
fireplace
.
Cooking
was
then
,
for
the
most
part
,
no
longer
a
poetic
,
but
*NL*
merely
a
chemic
process
.
It
will
soon
be
forgotten
,
in
these
days
of
*NL*
stoves
,
that
we
used
to
roast
potatoes
in
the
ashes
,
after
the
Indian
*NL*
fashion
.
The
stove
not
only
took
up
room
and
scented
the
house
,
but
it
*NL*
concealed
the
fire
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
had
lost
a
companion
.
You
can
*NL*
always
see
a
face
in
the
fire
.
The
laborer
,
looking
into
it
at
evening
,
*NL*
purifies
his
thoughts
of
the
dross
and
earthiness
which
they
have
*NL*
accumulated
during
the
day
.
But
I
could
no
longer
sit
and
look
into
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
the
pertinent
words
of
a
poet
recurred
to
me
with
new
*NL*
force
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

but
my
hopes
shot
upward
e'er
so
bright

*NL*
What
but
my
fortunes
sunk
so
low
in

Why
art
thou
banished
from
our
hearth

*NL*
Thou
who
art
welcomed

all

Was
thy
existence
then
too
fanciful
*NL*
For
our
life
's
common
light
,

are
so
dull

*NL*
Did
thy
bright
gleam
mysterious
converse
hold
*NL*
With
our
congenial
souls
?
secrets
too
bold
?
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
are
safe
and
strong
,
for
now
we
sit
*NL*
Beside
a
hearth
where
no
dim
shadows
flit
,
*NL*
Where
nothing
cheers
nor
saddens
,
but
a
fire
*NL*
Warms
feet
and
hands

nor
does
to
more
aspire
;
*NL*
By
whose
compact
utilitarian
heap
*NL*
The
present
may
sit
down
and
go
to
sleep
,
*NL*
Nor
fear
the
ghosts
who
from
the
dim
past
walked
,
*NL*
And
with
us
by
the
unequal
light

the

Former
Inhabitants
and
Winter
Visitors
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
weathered
some
merry
snow-storms
,
and
spent
some
cheerful
winter
*NL*
evenings
by
my
fireside
,
while
the
snow
whirled
wildly
without
,
and
even
*NL*
the
hooting
of
the
owl
was
hushed
.
For
many
weeks
I
met
no
one
in
my
*NL*
walks
but
those
who
came
occasionally
to
cut
wood
and
sled
it
to
the
*NL*
village
.
The
elements
,
however
,
abetted
me
in
making
a
path
through
the
*NL*
deepest
snow
in
the
woods
,
for
when
I
had
once
gone
through
the
wind
*NL*
blew
the
oak
leaves
into
my
tracks
,
where
they
lodged
,
and
by
absorbing
*NL*
the
rays
of
the
sun
melted
the
snow
,
and
so
not
only
made
a
my
bed
*NL*
for
my
feet
,
but
in
the
night
their
dark
line
was
my
guide
.
For
human
*NL*
society
I
was
obliged
to
conjure
up
the
former
occupants
of
these
woods
.
*NL*
Within
the
memory
of
many
of
my
townsmen
the
road
near
which
my
house
*NL*
stands
resounded
with
the
laugh
and
gossip
of
inhabitants
,
and
the
woods
*NL*
which
border
it
were
notched
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
their
little
*NL*
gardens
and
dwellings
,
though
it
was
then
much
more
shut
in
by
the
*NL*
forest
than
now
.
In
some
places
,
within
my
own
remembrance
,
the
pines
*NL*
would
scrape
both
sides
of
a
chaise
at
once
,
and
women
and
children
who
*NL*
were
compelled
to
go
this
way
to
Lincoln
alone
and
on
foot
did
it
with
*NL*
fear
,
and
often
ran
a
good
part
of
the
distance
.
Though
mainly
but
a
*NL*
humble
route
to
neighboring
villages
,
or
for
the
woodman
's
team
,
it
once
*NL*
amused
the
traveller
more
than
now
by
its
variety
,
and
lingered
longer
*NL*
in
his
memory
.
Where
now
firm
open
fields
stretch
from
the
village
to
*NL*
the
woods
,
it
then
ran
through
a
maple
swamp
on
a
foundation
of
logs
,
*NL*
the
remnants
of
which
,
doubtless
,
still
underlie
the
present
dusty
*NL*
highway
,
from
the
Stratton
,
now
the
Alms-House
Farm
,
to
Brister
's
Hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
East
of
my
bean-field
,
across
the
road
,
lived
Cato
Ingraham
,
slave
of
*NL*
Duncan
Ingraham
,
Esquire
,
gentleman
,
of
Concord
village
,
who
built
his
*NL*
slave
a
house
,
and
gave
him
permission
to
live
in
Walden
Woods
;
--
Cato
,
*NL*
not
Uticensis
,
but
Concordiensis
.
Some
say
that
he
was
a
Guinea
Negro
.
*NL*
There
are
a
few
who
remember
his
little
patch
among
the
walnuts
,
which
*NL*
he
let
grow
up
till
he
should
be
old
and
need
them
;
but
a
younger
and
*NL*
whiter
speculator
got
them
at
last
.
He
too
,
however
,
occupies
an
equally
*NL*
narrow
house
at
present
.
Cato
's
half-obliterated
cellar-hole
still
*NL*
remains
,
though
known
to
few
,
being
concealed
from
the
traveller
by
a
*NL*
fringe
of
pines
.
It
is
now
filled
with
the
smooth
sumach
-LRB-
_
Rhus
glabra
_
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
one
of
the
earliest
species
of
goldenrod
-LRB-
_
Solidago
stricta
_
-RRB-
grows
*NL*
there
luxuriantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
by
the
very
corner
of
my
field
,
still
nearer
to
town
,
Zilpha
,
*NL*
a
colored
woman
,
had
her
little
house
,
where
she
spun
linen
for
the
*NL*
townsfolk
,
making
the
Walden
Woods
ring
with
her
shrill
singing
,
for
*NL*
she
had
a
loud
and
notable
voice
.
At
length
,
in
the
war
of
1812
,
her
*NL*
dwelling
was
set
on
fire
by
English
soldiers
,
prisoners
on
parole
,
when
*NL*
she
was
away
,
and
her
cat
and
dog
and
hens
were
all
burned
up
together
.
*NL*
She
led
a
hard
life
,
and
somewhat
inhumane
.
One
old
frequenter
of
these
*NL*
woods
remembers
,
that
as
he
passed
her
house
one
noon
he
heard
her
*NL*
muttering
to
herself
over
her
gurgling
pot
--
``
Ye
are
all
bones
,
bones
!
''
I
*NL*
have
seen
bricks
amid
the
oak
copse
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
the
road
,
on
the
right
hand
,
on
Brister
's
Hill
,
lived
Brister
*NL*
Freeman
,
``
a
handy
Negro
,
''
slave
of
Squire
Cummings
once
--
there
where
*NL*
grow
still
the
apple
trees
which
Brister
planted
and
tended
;
large
old
*NL*
trees
now
,
but
their
fruit
still
wild
and
ciderish
to
my
taste
.
Not
long
*NL*
since
I
read
his
epitaph
in
the
old
Lincoln
burying-ground
,
a
little
on
*NL*
one
side
,
near
the
unmarked
graves
of
some
British
grenadiers
who
fell
*NL*
in
the
retreat
from
Concord
--
where
he
is
styled
``
Sippio
Brister
''
--
Scipio
*NL*
Africanus
he
had
some
title
to
be
called
--
``
a
man
of
color
,
''
as
if
he
*NL*
were
discolored
.
It
also
told
me
,
with
staring
emphasis
,
when
he
died
;
*NL*
which
was
but
an
indirect
way
of
informing
me
that
he
ever
lived
.
*NL*
With
him
dwelt
Fenda
,
his
hospitable
wife
,
who
told
fortunes
,
yet
*NL*
pleasantly
--
large
,
round
,
and
black
,
blacker
than
any
of
the
children
of
*NL*
night
,
such
a
dusky
orb
as
never
rose
on
Concord
before
or
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
down
the
hill
,
on
the
left
,
on
the
old
road
in
the
woods
,
are
*NL*
marks
of
some
homestead
of
the
Stratton
family
;
whose
orchard
once
*NL*
covered
all
the
slope
of
Brister
's
Hill
,
but
was
long
since
killed
out
*NL*
by
pitch
pines
,
excepting
a
few
stumps
,
whose
old
roots
furnish
still
*NL*
the
wild
stocks
of
many
a
thrifty
village
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearer
yet
to
town
,
you
come
to
Breed
's
location
,
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
way
,
just
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
;
ground
famous
for
the
pranks
of
*NL*
a
demon
not
distinctly
named
in
old
mythology
,
who
has
acted
a
prominent
*NL*
and
astounding
part
in
our
New
England
life
,
and
deserves
,
as
much
as
*NL*
any
mythological
character
,
to
have
his
biography
written
one
day
;
who
*NL*
first
comes
in
the
guise
of
a
friend
or
hired
man
,
and
then
robs
and
*NL*
murders
the
whole
family
--
New-England
Rum
.
But
history
must
not
yet
*NL*
tell
the
tragedies
enacted
here
;
let
time
intervene
in
some
measure
to
*NL*
assuage
and
lend
an
azure
tint
to
them
.
Here
the
most
indistinct
and
*NL*
dubious
tradition
says
that
once
a
tavern
stood
;
the
well
the
same
,
*NL*
which
tempered
the
traveller
's
beverage
and
refreshed
his
steed
.
Here
*NL*
then
men
saluted
one
another
,
and
heard
and
told
the
news
,
and
went
*NL*
their
ways
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breed
's
hut
was
standing
only
a
dozen
years
ago
,
though
it
had
long
*NL*
been
unoccupied
.
It
was
about
the
size
of
mine
.
It
was
set
on
fire
by
*NL*
mischievous
boys
,
one
Election
night
,
if
I
do
not
mistake
.
I
lived
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
village
then
,
and
had
just
lost
myself
over
Davenant
's
*NL*
``
Gondibert
,
''
that
winter
that
I
labored
with
a
lethargy
--
which
,
by
the
*NL*
way
,
I
never
knew
whether
to
regard
as
a
family
complaint
,
having
*NL*
an
uncle
who
goes
to
sleep
shaving
himself
,
and
is
obliged
to
sprout
*NL*
potatoes
in
a
cellar
Sundays
,
in
order
to
keep
awake
and
keep
the
*NL*
Sabbath
,
or
as
the
consequence
of
my
attempt
to
read
Chalmers
'
*NL*
collection
of
English
poetry
without
skipping
.
It
fairly
overcame
my
*NL*
Nervii
.
I
had
just
sunk
my
head
on
this
when
the
bells
rung
fire
,
and
in
*NL*
hot
haste
the
engines
rolled
that
way
,
led
by
a
straggling
troop
of
*NL*
men
and
boys
,
and
I
among
the
foremost
,
for
I
had
leaped
the
brook
.
*NL*
We
thought
it
was
far
south
over
the
woods
--
we
who
had
run
to
fires
*NL*
before
--
barn
,
shop
,
or
dwelling-house
,
or
all
together
.
``
It
's
Baker
's
*NL*
barn
,
''
cried
one
.
``
It
is
the
Codman
place
,
''
affirmed
another
.
And
then
*NL*
fresh
sparks
went
up
above
the
wood
,
as
if
the
roof
fell
in
,
and
we
all
*NL*
shouted
``
Concord
to
the
rescue
!
''
Wagons
shot
past
with
furious
speed
*NL*
and
crushing
loads
,
bearing
,
perchance
,
among
the
rest
,
the
agent
of
the
*NL*
Insurance
Company
,
who
was
bound
to
go
however
far
;
and
ever
and
anon
*NL*
the
engine
bell
tinkled
behind
,
more
slow
and
sure
;
and
rearmost
of
all
,
*NL*
as
it
was
afterward
whispered
,
came
they
who
set
the
fire
and
gave
the
*NL*
alarm
.
Thus
we
kept
on
like
true
idealists
,
rejecting
the
evidence
*NL*
of
our
senses
,
until
at
a
turn
in
the
road
we
heard
the
crackling
and
*NL*
actually
felt
the
heat
of
the
fire
from
over
the
wall
,
and
realized
,
*NL*
alas
!
that
we
were
there
.
The
very
nearness
of
the
fire
but
cooled
our
*NL*
ardor
.
At
first
we
thought
to
throw
a
frog-pond
on
to
it
;
but
concluded
*NL*
to
let
it
burn
,
it
was
so
far
gone
and
so
worthless
.
So
we
stood
round
*NL*
our
engine
,
jostled
one
another
,
expressed
our
sentiments
through
*NL*
speaking-trumpets
,
or
in
lower
tone
referred
to
the
great
conflagrations
*NL*
which
the
world
has
witnessed
,
including
Bascom
's
shop
,
and
,
between
*NL*
ourselves
,
we
thought
that
,
were
we
there
in
season
with
our
``
tub
,
''
and
*NL*
a
full
frog-pond
by
,
we
could
turn
that
threatened
last
and
universal
*NL*
one
into
another
flood
.
We
finally
retreated
without
doing
any
*NL*
mischief
--
returned
to
sleep
and
``
Gondibert
.
''
But
as
for
``
Gondibert
,
''
*NL*
I
would
except
that
passage
in
the
preface
about
wit
being
the
soul
's
*NL*
powder
--
``
but
most
of
mankind
are
strangers
to
wit
,
as
Indians
are
to
*NL*
powder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
I
walked
that
way
across
the
fields
the
following
night
,
*NL*
about
the
same
hour
,
and
hearing
a
low
moaning
at
this
spot
,
I
drew
near
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
and
discovered
the
only
survivor
of
the
family
that
I
know
,
*NL*
the
heir
of
both
its
virtues
and
its
vices
,
who
alone
was
interested
in
*NL*
this
burning
,
lying
on
his
stomach
and
looking
over
the
cellar
wall
at
*NL*
the
still
smouldering
cinders
beneath
,
muttering
to
himself
,
as
is
his
*NL*
wont
.
He
had
been
working
far
off
in
the
river
meadows
all
day
,
and
had
*NL*
improved
the
first
moments
that
he
could
call
his
own
to
visit
the
home
*NL*
of
his
fathers
and
his
youth
.
He
gazed
into
the
cellar
from
all
sides
*NL*
and
points
of
view
by
turns
,
always
lying
down
to
it
,
as
if
there
was
*NL*
some
treasure
,
which
he
remembered
,
concealed
between
the
stones
,
where
*NL*
there
was
absolutely
nothing
but
a
heap
of
bricks
and
ashes
.
The
house
*NL*
being
gone
,
he
looked
at
what
there
was
left
.
He
was
soothed
by
the
*NL*
sympathy
which
my
mere
presence
implied
,
and
showed
me
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
darkness
permitted
,
where
the
well
was
covered
up
;
which
,
thank
Heaven
,
*NL*
could
never
be
burned
;
and
he
groped
long
about
the
wall
to
find
the
*NL*
well-sweep
which
his
father
had
cut
and
mounted
,
feeling
for
the
iron
*NL*
hook
or
staple
by
which
a
burden
had
been
fastened
to
the
heavy
end
--
all
*NL*
that
he
could
now
cling
to
--
to
convince
me
that
it
was
no
common
*NL*
``
rider
.
''
I
felt
it
,
and
still
remark
it
almost
daily
in
my
walks
,
for
by
*NL*
it
hangs
the
history
of
a
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
on
the
left
,
where
are
seen
the
well
and
lilac
bushes
by
the
*NL*
wall
,
in
the
now
open
field
,
lived
Nutting
and
Le
Grosse
.
But
to
return
*NL*
toward
Lincoln
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
in
the
woods
than
any
of
these
,
where
the
road
approaches
*NL*
nearest
to
the
pond
,
Wyman
the
potter
squatted
,
and
furnished
his
*NL*
townsmen
with
earthenware
,
and
left
descendants
to
succeed
him
.
Neither
*NL*
were
they
rich
in
worldly
goods
,
holding
the
land
by
sufferance
while
*NL*
they
lived
;
and
there
often
the
sheriff
came
in
vain
to
collect
the
*NL*
taxes
,
and
``
attached
a
chip
,
''
for
form
's
sake
,
as
I
have
read
in
his
*NL*
accounts
,
there
being
nothing
else
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
.
One
*NL*
day
in
midsummer
,
when
I
was
hoeing
,
a
man
who
was
carrying
a
load
*NL*
of
pottery
to
market
stopped
his
horse
against
my
field
and
inquired
*NL*
concerning
Wyman
the
younger
.
He
had
long
ago
bought
a
potter
's
wheel
*NL*
of
him
,
and
wished
to
know
what
had
become
of
him
.
I
had
read
of
the
*NL*
potter
's
clay
and
wheel
in
Scripture
,
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
*NL*
that
the
pots
we
use
were
not
such
as
had
come
down
unbroken
from
those
*NL*
days
,
or
grown
on
trees
like
gourds
somewhere
,
and
I
was
pleased
to
hear
*NL*
that
so
fictile
an
art
was
ever
practiced
in
my
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
inhabitant
of
these
woods
before
me
was
an
Irishman
,
Hugh
*NL*
Quoil
-LRB-
if
I
have
spelt
his
name
with
coil
enough
-RRB-
,
who
occupied
Wyman
's
*NL*
tenement
--
Col.
Quoil
,
he
was
called
.
Rumor
said
that
he
had
been
a
*NL*
soldier
at
Waterloo
.
If
he
had
lived
I
should
have
made
him
fight
his
*NL*
battles
over
again
.
His
trade
here
was
that
of
a
ditcher
.
Napoleon
went
*NL*
to
St.
Helena
;
Quoil
came
to
Walden
Woods
.
All
I
know
of
him
is
tragic
.
*NL*
He
was
a
man
of
manners
,
like
one
who
had
seen
the
world
,
and
was
*NL*
capable
of
more
civil
speech
than
you
could
well
attend
to
.
He
wore
a
*NL*
greatcoat
in
midsummer
,
being
affected
with
the
trembling
delirium
,
and
*NL*
his
face
was
the
color
of
carmine
.
He
died
in
the
road
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
Brister
's
Hill
shortly
after
I
came
to
the
woods
,
so
that
I
have
not
*NL*
remembered
him
as
a
neighbor
.
Before
his
house
was
pulled
down
,
when
his
*NL*
comrades
avoided
it
as
``
an
unlucky
castle
,
''
I
visited
it
.
There
lay
his
*NL*
old
clothes
curled
up
by
use
,
as
if
they
were
himself
,
upon
his
raised
*NL*
plank
bed
.
His
pipe
lay
broken
on
the
hearth
,
instead
of
a
bowl
broken
*NL*
at
the
fountain
.
The
last
could
never
have
been
the
symbol
of
his
death
,
*NL*
for
he
confessed
to
me
that
,
though
he
had
heard
of
Brister
's
Spring
,
*NL*
he
had
never
seen
it
;
and
soiled
cards
,
kings
of
diamonds
,
spades
,
*NL*
and
hearts
,
were
scattered
over
the
floor
.
One
black
chicken
which
the
*NL*
administrator
could
not
catch
,
black
as
night
and
as
silent
,
not
even
*NL*
croaking
,
awaiting
Reynard
,
still
went
to
roost
in
the
next
apartment
.
*NL*
In
the
rear
there
was
the
dim
outline
of
a
garden
,
which
had
been
*NL*
planted
but
had
never
received
its
first
hoeing
,
owing
to
those
terrible
*NL*
shaking
fits
,
though
it
was
now
harvest
time
.
It
was
overrun
with
Roman
*NL*
wormwood
and
beggar-ticks
,
which
last
stuck
to
my
clothes
for
all
fruit
.
*NL*
The
skin
of
a
woodchuck
was
freshly
stretched
upon
the
back
of
the
*NL*
house
,
a
trophy
of
his
last
Waterloo
;
but
no
warm
cap
or
mittens
would
*NL*
he
want
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
only
a
dent
in
the
earth
marks
the
site
of
these
dwellings
,
with
*NL*
buried
cellar
stones
,
and
strawberries
,
raspberries
,
thimble-berries
,
*NL*
hazel-bushes
,
and
sumachs
growing
in
the
sunny
sward
there
;
some
*NL*
pitch
pine
or
gnarled
oak
occupies
what
was
the
chimney
nook
,
and
a
*NL*
sweet-scented
black
birch
,
perhaps
,
waves
where
the
door-stone
was
.
*NL*
Sometimes
the
well
dent
is
visible
,
where
once
a
spring
oozed
;
now
dry
*NL*
and
tearless
grass
;
or
it
was
covered
deep
--
not
to
be
discovered
till
*NL*
some
late
day
--
with
a
flat
stone
under
the
sod
,
when
the
last
of
the
*NL*
race
departed
.
What
a
sorrowful
act
must
that
be
--
the
covering
up
of
*NL*
wells
!
coincident
with
the
opening
of
wells
of
tears
.
These
cellar
*NL*
dents
,
like
deserted
fox
burrows
,
old
holes
,
are
all
that
is
left
where
*NL*
once
were
the
stir
and
bustle
of
human
life
,
and
``
fate
,
free
will
,
*NL*
foreknowledge
absolute
,
''
in
some
form
and
dialect
or
other
were
by
turns
*NL*
discussed
.
But
all
I
can
learn
of
their
conclusions
amounts
to
just
*NL*
this
,
that
``
Cato
and
Brister
pulled
wool
''
;
which
is
about
as
edifying
as
*NL*
the
history
of
more
famous
schools
of
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
grows
the
vivacious
lilac
a
generation
after
the
door
and
lintel
*NL*
and
the
sill
are
gone
,
unfolding
its
sweet-scented
flowers
each
spring
,
*NL*
to
be
plucked
by
the
musing
traveller
;
planted
and
tended
once
by
*NL*
children
's
hands
,
in
front-yard
plots
--
now
standing
by
wallsides
in
*NL*
retired
pastures
,
and
giving
place
to
new-rising
forests
;
--
the
last
of
*NL*
that
stirp
,
sole
survivor
of
that
family
.
Little
did
the
dusky
children
*NL*
think
that
the
puny
slip
with
its
two
eyes
only
,
which
they
stuck
in
the
*NL*
ground
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
and
daily
watered
,
would
root
itself
*NL*
so
,
and
outlive
them
,
and
house
itself
in
the
rear
that
shaded
it
,
and
*NL*
grown
man
's
garden
and
orchard
,
and
tell
their
story
faintly
to
the
lone
*NL*
wanderer
a
half-century
after
they
had
grown
up
and
died
--
blossoming
as
*NL*
fair
,
and
smelling
as
sweet
,
as
in
that
first
spring
.
I
mark
its
still
*NL*
tender
,
civil
,
cheerful
lilac
colors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
small
village
,
germ
of
something
more
,
why
did
it
fail
while
*NL*
Concord
keeps
its
ground
?
Were
there
no
natural
advantages
--
no
water
*NL*
privileges
,
forsooth
?
Ay
,
the
deep
Walden
Pond
and
cool
Brister
's
*NL*
Spring
--
privilege
to
drink
long
and
healthy
draughts
at
these
,
all
*NL*
unimproved
by
these
men
but
to
dilute
their
glass
.
They
were
universally
*NL*
a
thirsty
race
.
Might
not
the
basket
,
stable-broom
,
mat-making
,
*NL*
corn-parching
,
linen-spinning
,
and
pottery
business
have
thrived
here
,
*NL*
making
the
wilderness
to
blossom
like
the
rose
,
and
a
numerous
posterity
*NL*
have
inherited
the
land
of
their
fathers
?
The
sterile
soil
would
at
*NL*
least
have
been
proof
against
a
low-land
degeneracy
.
Alas
!
how
little
*NL*
does
the
memory
of
these
human
inhabitants
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
landscape
!
Again
,
perhaps
,
Nature
will
try
,
with
me
for
a
first
settler
,
*NL*
and
my
house
raised
last
spring
to
be
the
oldest
in
the
hamlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
aware
that
any
man
has
ever
built
on
the
spot
which
I
occupy
.
*NL*
Deliver
me
from
a
city
built
on
the
site
of
a
more
ancient
city
,
whose
*NL*
materials
are
ruins
,
whose
gardens
cemeteries
.
The
soil
is
blanched
and
*NL*
accursed
there
,
and
before
that
becomes
necessary
the
earth
itself
will
*NL*
be
destroyed
.
With
such
reminiscences
I
repeopled
the
woods
and
lulled
*NL*
myself
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
season
I
seldom
had
a
visitor
.
When
the
snow
lay
deepest
no
*NL*
wanderer
ventured
near
my
house
for
a
week
or
fortnight
at
a
time
,
but
*NL*
there
I
lived
as
snug
as
a
meadow
mouse
,
or
as
cattle
and
poultry
which
*NL*
are
said
to
have
survived
for
a
long
time
buried
in
drifts
,
even
without
*NL*
food
;
or
like
that
early
settler
's
family
in
the
town
of
Sutton
,
in
this
*NL*
State
,
whose
cottage
was
completely
covered
by
the
great
snow
of
1717
*NL*
when
he
was
absent
,
and
an
Indian
found
it
only
by
the
hole
which
the
*NL*
chimney
's
breath
made
in
the
drift
,
and
so
relieved
the
family
.
But
*NL*
no
friendly
Indian
concerned
himself
about
me
;
nor
needed
he
,
for
the
*NL*
master
of
the
house
was
at
home
.
The
Great
Snow
!
How
cheerful
it
is
to
*NL*
hear
of
!
When
the
farmers
could
not
get
to
the
woods
and
swamps
with
*NL*
their
teams
,
and
were
obliged
to
cut
down
the
shade
trees
before
their
*NL*
houses
,
and
,
when
the
crust
was
harder
,
cut
off
the
trees
in
the
swamps
,
*NL*
ten
feet
from
the
ground
,
as
it
appeared
the
next
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
deepest
snows
,
the
path
which
I
used
from
the
highway
to
*NL*
my
house
,
about
half
a
mile
long
,
might
have
been
represented
by
a
*NL*
meandering
dotted
line
,
with
wide
intervals
between
the
dots
.
For
a
week
*NL*
of
even
weather
I
took
exactly
the
same
number
of
steps
,
and
of
the
same
*NL*
length
,
coming
and
going
,
stepping
deliberately
and
with
the
precision
*NL*
of
a
pair
of
dividers
in
my
own
deep
tracks
--
to
such
routine
the
winter
*NL*
reduces
us
--
yet
often
they
were
filled
with
heaven
's
own
blue
.
But
no
*NL*
weather
interfered
fatally
with
my
walks
,
or
rather
my
going
abroad
,
for
*NL*
I
frequently
tramped
eight
or
ten
miles
through
the
deepest
snow
to
*NL*
keep
an
appointment
with
a
beech
tree
,
or
a
yellow
birch
,
or
an
old
*NL*
acquaintance
among
the
pines
;
when
the
ice
and
snow
causing
their
limbs
*NL*
to
droop
,
and
so
sharpening
their
tops
,
had
changed
the
pines
into
fir
*NL*
trees
;
wading
to
the
tops
of
the
highest
hills
when
the
show
was
nearly
*NL*
two
feet
deep
on
a
level
,
and
shaking
down
another
snow-storm
on
my
head
*NL*
at
every
step
;
or
sometimes
creeping
and
floundering
thither
on
my
hands
*NL*
and
knees
,
when
the
hunters
had
gone
into
winter
quarters
.
One
afternoon
*NL*
I
amused
myself
by
watching
a
barred
owl
-LRB-
_
Strix
nebulosa
_
-RRB-
sitting
on
one
*NL*
of
the
lower
dead
limbs
of
a
white
pine
,
close
to
the
trunk
,
in
broad
*NL*
daylight
,
I
standing
within
a
rod
of
him
.
He
could
hear
me
when
I
moved
*NL*
and
cronched
the
snow
with
my
feet
,
but
could
not
plainly
see
me
.
When
*NL*
I
made
most
noise
he
would
stretch
out
his
neck
,
and
erect
his
neck
*NL*
feathers
,
and
open
his
eyes
wide
;
but
their
lids
soon
fell
again
,
and
he
*NL*
began
to
nod
.
I
too
felt
a
slumberous
influence
after
watching
him
half
*NL*
an
hour
,
as
he
sat
thus
with
his
eyes
half
open
,
like
a
cat
,
winged
*NL*
brother
of
the
cat
.
There
was
only
a
narrow
slit
left
between
their
*NL*
lids
,
by
which
he
preserved
a
peninsular
relation
to
me
;
thus
,
with
*NL*
half-shut
eyes
,
looking
out
from
the
land
of
dreams
,
and
endeavoring
*NL*
to
realize
me
,
vague
object
or
mote
that
interrupted
his
visions
.
At
*NL*
length
,
on
some
louder
noise
or
my
nearer
approach
,
he
would
grow
uneasy
*NL*
and
sluggishly
turn
about
on
his
perch
,
as
if
impatient
at
having
his
*NL*
dreams
disturbed
;
and
when
he
launched
himself
off
and
flapped
through
*NL*
the
pines
,
spreading
his
wings
to
unexpected
breadth
,
I
could
not
hear
*NL*
the
slightest
sound
from
them
.
Thus
,
guided
amid
the
pine
boughs
rather
*NL*
by
a
delicate
sense
of
their
neighborhood
than
by
sight
,
feeling
his
*NL*
twilight
way
,
as
it
were
,
with
his
sensitive
pinions
,
he
found
a
new
*NL*
perch
,
where
he
might
in
peace
await
the
dawning
of
his
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
walked
over
the
long
causeway
made
for
the
railroad
through
the
*NL*
meadows
,
I
encountered
many
a
blustering
and
nipping
wind
,
for
nowhere
*NL*
has
it
freer
play
;
and
when
the
frost
had
smitten
me
on
one
cheek
,
*NL*
heathen
as
I
was
,
I
turned
to
it
the
other
also
.
Nor
was
it
much
better
*NL*
by
the
carriage
road
from
Brister
's
Hill
.
For
I
came
to
town
still
,
like
*NL*
a
friendly
Indian
,
when
the
contents
of
the
broad
open
fields
were
all
*NL*
piled
up
between
the
walls
of
the
Walden
road
,
and
half
an
hour
sufficed
*NL*
to
obliterate
the
tracks
of
the
last
traveller
.
And
when
I
returned
new
*NL*
drifts
would
have
formed
,
through
which
I
floundered
,
where
the
busy
*NL*
northwest
wind
had
been
depositing
the
powdery
snow
round
a
sharp
angle
*NL*
in
the
road
,
and
not
a
rabbit
's
track
,
nor
even
the
fine
print
,
the
*NL*
small
type
,
of
a
meadow
mouse
was
to
be
seen
.
Yet
I
rarely
failed
to
*NL*
find
,
even
in
midwinter
,
some
warm
and
springly
swamp
where
the
grass
*NL*
and
the
skunk-cabbage
still
put
forth
with
perennial
verdure
,
and
some
*NL*
hardier
bird
occasionally
awaited
the
return
of
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
notwithstanding
the
snow
,
when
I
returned
from
my
walk
at
*NL*
evening
I
crossed
the
deep
tracks
of
a
woodchopper
leading
from
my
door
,
*NL*
and
found
his
pile
of
whittlings
on
the
hearth
,
and
my
house
filled
with
*NL*
the
odor
of
his
pipe
.
Or
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
,
if
I
chanced
to
be
*NL*
at
home
,
I
heard
the
cronching
of
the
snow
made
by
the
step
of
a
*NL*
long-headed
farmer
,
who
from
far
through
the
woods
sought
my
house
,
to
*NL*
have
a
social
``
crack
''
;
one
of
the
few
of
his
vocation
who
are
``
men
on
*NL*
their
farms
''
;
who
donned
a
frock
instead
of
a
professor
's
gown
,
and
is
*NL*
as
ready
to
extract
the
moral
out
of
church
or
state
as
to
haul
a
load
*NL*
of
manure
from
his
barn-yard
.
We
talked
of
rude
and
simple
times
,
when
*NL*
men
sat
about
large
fires
in
cold
,
bracing
weather
,
with
clear
heads
;
*NL*
and
when
other
dessert
failed
,
we
tried
our
teeth
on
many
a
nut
which
*NL*
wise
squirrels
have
long
since
abandoned
,
for
those
which
have
the
*NL*
thickest
shells
are
commonly
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
who
came
from
farthest
to
my
lodge
,
through
deepest
snows
and
*NL*
most
dismal
tempests
,
was
a
poet
.
A
farmer
,
a
hunter
,
a
soldier
,
a
*NL*
reporter
,
even
a
philosopher
,
may
be
daunted
;
but
nothing
can
deter
a
*NL*
poet
,
for
he
is
actuated
by
pure
love
.
Who
can
predict
his
comings
*NL*
and
goings
?
His
business
calls
him
out
at
all
hours
,
even
when
doctors
*NL*
sleep
.
We
made
that
small
house
ring
with
boisterous
mirth
and
resound
*NL*
with
the
murmur
of
much
sober
talk
,
making
amends
then
to
Walden
vale
*NL*
for
the
long
silences
.
Broadway
was
still
and
deserted
in
comparison
.
At
*NL*
suitable
intervals
there
were
regular
salutes
of
laughter
,
which
might
*NL*
have
been
referred
indifferently
to
the
last-uttered
or
the
forth-coming
*NL*
jest
.
We
made
many
a
``
bran
new
''
theory
of
life
over
a
thin
dish
*NL*
of
gruel
,
which
combined
the
advantages
of
conviviality
with
the
*NL*
clear-headedness
which
philosophy
requires
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
not
forget
that
during
my
last
winter
at
the
pond
there
was
*NL*
another
welcome
visitor
,
who
at
one
time
came
through
the
village
,
*NL*
through
snow
and
rain
and
darkness
,
till
he
saw
my
lamp
through
the
*NL*
trees
,
and
shared
with
me
some
long
winter
evenings
.
One
of
the
last
of
*NL*
the
philosophers
--
Connecticut
gave
him
to
the
world
--
he
peddled
first
*NL*
her
wares
,
afterwards
,
as
he
declares
,
his
brains
.
These
he
peddles
*NL*
still
,
prompting
God
and
disgracing
man
,
bearing
for
fruit
his
brain
*NL*
only
,
like
the
nut
its
kernel
.
I
think
that
he
must
be
the
man
of
the
*NL*
most
faith
of
any
alive
.
His
words
and
attitude
always
suppose
a
better
*NL*
state
of
things
than
other
men
are
acquainted
with
,
and
he
will
be
the
*NL*
last
man
to
be
disappointed
as
the
ages
revolve
.
He
has
no
venture
in
*NL*
the
present
.
But
though
comparatively
disregarded
now
,
when
his
day
*NL*
comes
,
laws
unsuspected
by
most
will
take
effect
,
and
masters
of
*NL*
families
and
rulers
will
come
to
him
for
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
blind
that
can
not
see
serenity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
true
friend
of
man
;
almost
the
only
friend
of
human
progress
.
An
Old
*NL*
Mortality
,
say
rather
an
Immortality
,
with
unwearied
patience
and
faith
*NL*
making
plain
the
image
engraven
in
men
's
bodies
,
the
God
of
whom
they
*NL*
are
but
defaced
and
leaning
monuments
.
With
his
hospitable
intellect
*NL*
he
embraces
children
,
beggars
,
insane
,
and
scholars
,
and
entertains
the
*NL*
thought
of
all
,
adding
to
it
commonly
some
breadth
and
elegance
.
I
*NL*
think
that
he
should
keep
a
caravansary
on
the
world
's
highway
,
where
*NL*
philosophers
of
all
nations
might
put
up
,
and
on
his
sign
should
be
*NL*
printed
,
``
Entertainment
for
man
,
but
not
for
his
beast
.
Enter
ye
that
*NL*
have
leisure
and
a
quiet
mind
,
who
earnestly
seek
the
right
road
.
''
He
is
*NL*
perhaps
the
sanest
man
and
has
the
fewest
crotchets
of
any
I
chance
*NL*
to
know
;
the
same
yesterday
and
tomorrow
.
Of
yore
we
had
sauntered
and
*NL*
talked
,
and
effectually
put
the
world
behind
us
;
for
he
was
pledged
to
*NL*
no
institution
in
it
,
freeborn
,
_
ingenuus
_
.
Whichever
way
we
turned
,
*NL*
it
seemed
that
the
heavens
and
the
earth
had
met
together
,
since
he
*NL*
enhanced
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
.
A
blue-robed
man
,
whose
fittest
*NL*
roof
is
the
overarching
sky
which
reflects
his
serenity
.
I
do
not
see
*NL*
how
he
can
ever
die
;
Nature
can
not
spare
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
each
some
shingles
of
thought
well
dried
,
we
sat
and
whittled
*NL*
them
,
trying
our
knives
,
and
admiring
the
clear
yellowish
grain
of
the
*NL*
pumpkin
pine
.
We
waded
so
gently
and
reverently
,
or
we
pulled
together
*NL*
so
smoothly
,
that
the
fishes
of
thought
were
not
scared
from
the
stream
,
*NL*
nor
feared
any
angler
on
the
bank
,
but
came
and
went
grandly
,
like
the
*NL*
clouds
which
float
through
the
western
sky
,
and
the
mother-o
'
-
pearl
*NL*
flocks
which
sometimes
form
and
dissolve
there
.
There
we
worked
,
*NL*
revising
mythology
,
rounding
a
fable
here
and
there
,
and
building
*NL*
castles
in
the
air
for
which
earth
offered
no
worthy
foundation
.
Great
*NL*
Looker
!
Great
Expecter
!
to
converse
with
whom
was
a
New
England
Night
's
*NL*
Entertainment
.
Ah
!
such
discourse
we
had
,
hermit
and
philosopher
,
and
*NL*
the
old
settler
I
have
spoken
of
--
we
three
--
it
expanded
and
racked
my
*NL*
little
house
;
I
should
not
dare
to
say
how
many
pounds
'
weight
there
*NL*
was
above
the
atmospheric
pressure
on
every
circular
inch
;
it
opened
its
*NL*
seams
so
that
they
had
to
be
calked
with
much
dulness
thereafter
to
stop
*NL*
the
consequent
leak
;
--
but
I
had
enough
of
that
kind
of
oakum
already
*NL*
picked
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
other
with
whom
I
had
``
solid
seasons
,
''
long
to
be
*NL*
remembered
,
at
his
house
in
the
village
,
and
who
looked
in
upon
me
from
*NL*
time
to
time
;
but
I
had
no
more
for
society
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
too
,
as
everywhere
,
I
sometimes
expected
the
Visitor
who
never
*NL*
comes
.
The
Vishnu
Purana
says
,
``
The
house-holder
is
to
remain
at
*NL*
eventide
in
his
courtyard
as
long
as
it
takes
to
milk
a
cow
,
or
longer
*NL*
if
he
pleases
,
to
await
the
arrival
of
a
guest
.
''
I
often
performed
this
*NL*
duty
of
hospitality
,
waited
long
enough
to
milk
a
whole
herd
of
cows
,
*NL*
but
did
not
see
the
man
approaching
from
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
Animals
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ponds
were
firmly
frozen
,
they
afforded
not
only
new
and
*NL*
shorter
routes
to
many
points
,
but
new
views
from
their
surfaces
of
the
*NL*
familiar
landscape
around
them
.
When
I
crossed
Flint
's
Pond
,
after
it
*NL*
was
covered
with
snow
,
though
I
had
often
paddled
about
and
skated
over
*NL*
it
,
it
was
so
unexpectedly
wide
and
so
strange
that
I
could
think
of
*NL*
nothing
but
Baffin
's
Bay
.
The
Lincoln
hills
rose
up
around
me
at
the
*NL*
extremity
of
a
snowy
plain
,
in
which
I
did
not
remember
to
have
stood
*NL*
before
;
and
the
fishermen
,
at
an
indeterminable
distance
over
the
ice
,
*NL*
moving
slowly
about
with
their
wolfish
dogs
,
passed
for
sealers
,
or
*NL*
Esquimaux
,
or
in
misty
weather
loomed
like
fabulous
creatures
,
and
I
did
*NL*
not
know
whether
they
were
giants
or
pygmies
.
I
took
this
course
when
*NL*
I
went
to
lecture
in
Lincoln
in
the
evening
,
travelling
in
no
road
and
*NL*
passing
no
house
between
my
own
hut
and
the
lecture
room
.
In
Goose
Pond
,
*NL*
which
lay
in
my
way
,
a
colony
of
muskrats
dwelt
,
and
raised
their
cabins
*NL*
high
above
the
ice
,
though
none
could
be
seen
abroad
when
I
crossed
it
.
*NL*
Walden
,
being
like
the
rest
usually
bare
of
snow
,
or
with
only
shallow
*NL*
and
interrupted
drifts
on
it
,
was
my
yard
where
I
could
walk
freely
when
*NL*
the
snow
was
nearly
two
feet
deep
on
a
level
elsewhere
and
the
villagers
*NL*
were
confined
to
their
streets
.
There
,
far
from
the
village
street
,
and
*NL*
except
at
very
long
intervals
,
from
the
jingle
of
sleigh-bells
,
I
slid
*NL*
and
skated
,
as
in
a
vast
moose-yard
well
trodden
,
overhung
by
oak
woods
*NL*
and
solemn
pines
bent
down
with
snow
or
bristling
with
icicles
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
sounds
in
winter
nights
,
and
often
in
winter
days
,
I
heard
the
*NL*
forlorn
but
melodious
note
of
a
hooting
owl
indefinitely
far
;
such
*NL*
a
sound
as
the
frozen
earth
would
yield
if
struck
with
a
suitable
*NL*
plectrum
,
the
very
_
lingua
vernacula
_
of
Walden
Wood
,
and
quite
familiar
*NL*
to
me
at
last
,
though
I
never
saw
the
bird
while
it
was
making
it
.
I
*NL*
seldom
opened
my
door
in
a
winter
evening
without
hearing
it
;
_
Hoo
hoo
*NL*
hoo
,
hoorer
,
hoo
,
_
sounded
sonorously
,
and
the
first
three
syllables
*NL*
accented
somewhat
like
_
how
der
do
_
;
or
sometimes
_
hoo
,
hoo
_
only
.
One
*NL*
night
in
the
beginning
of
winter
,
before
the
pond
froze
over
,
about
nine
*NL*
o'clock
,
I
was
startled
by
the
loud
honking
of
a
goose
,
and
,
stepping
to
*NL*
the
door
,
heard
the
sound
of
their
wings
like
a
tempest
in
the
woods
*NL*
as
they
flew
low
over
my
house
.
They
passed
over
the
pond
toward
Fair
*NL*
Haven
,
seemingly
deterred
from
settling
by
my
light
,
their
commodore
*NL*
honking
all
the
while
with
a
regular
beat
.
Suddenly
an
unmistakable
*NL*
cat-owl
from
very
near
me
,
with
the
most
harsh
and
tremendous
voice
*NL*
I
ever
heard
from
any
inhabitant
of
the
woods
,
responded
at
regular
*NL*
intervals
to
the
goose
,
as
if
determined
to
expose
and
disgrace
this
*NL*
intruder
from
Hudson
's
Bay
by
exhibiting
a
greater
compass
and
volume
of
*NL*
voice
in
a
native
,
and
_
boo-hoo
_
him
out
of
Concord
horizon
.
What
do
you
*NL*
mean
by
alarming
the
citadel
at
this
time
of
night
consecrated
to
me
?
Do
*NL*
you
think
I
am
ever
caught
napping
at
such
an
hour
,
and
that
I
have
not
*NL*
got
lungs
and
a
larynx
as
well
as
yourself
?
_
Boo-hoo
,
boo-hoo
,
boo-hoo
!
_
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
most
thrilling
discords
I
ever
heard
.
And
yet
,
if
you
*NL*
had
a
discriminating
ear
,
there
were
in
it
the
elements
of
a
concord
*NL*
such
as
these
plains
never
saw
nor
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
also
heard
the
whooping
of
the
ice
in
the
pond
,
my
great
bed-fellow
in
*NL*
that
part
of
Concord
,
as
if
it
were
restless
in
its
bed
and
would
fain
*NL*
turn
over
,
were
troubled
with
flatulency
and
had
dreams
;
or
I
was
waked
*NL*
by
the
cracking
of
the
ground
by
the
frost
,
as
if
some
one
had
driven
a
*NL*
team
against
my
door
,
and
in
the
morning
would
find
a
crack
in
the
earth
*NL*
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
a
third
of
an
inch
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
heard
the
foxes
as
they
ranged
over
the
snow-crust
,
in
*NL*
moonlight
nights
,
in
search
of
a
partridge
or
other
game
,
barking
*NL*
raggedly
and
demoniacally
like
forest
dogs
,
as
if
laboring
with
some
*NL*
anxiety
,
or
seeking
expression
,
struggling
for
light
and
to
be
dogs
*NL*
outright
and
run
freely
in
the
streets
;
for
if
we
take
the
ages
into
our
*NL*
account
,
may
there
not
be
a
civilization
going
on
among
brutes
as
*NL*
well
as
men
?
They
seemed
to
me
to
be
rudimental
,
burrowing
men
,
still
*NL*
standing
on
their
defence
,
awaiting
their
transformation
.
Sometimes
one
*NL*
came
near
to
my
window
,
attracted
by
my
light
,
barked
a
vulpine
curse
at
*NL*
me
,
and
then
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Usually
the
red
squirrel
-LRB-
_
Sciurus
Hudsonius
_
-RRB-
waked
me
in
the
dawn
,
*NL*
coursing
over
the
roof
and
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
house
,
as
if
*NL*
sent
out
of
the
woods
for
this
purpose
.
In
the
course
of
the
winter
I
*NL*
threw
out
half
a
bushel
of
ears
of
sweet
corn
,
which
had
not
got
ripe
,
*NL*
on
to
the
snow-crust
by
my
door
,
and
was
amused
by
watching
the
motions
*NL*
of
the
various
animals
which
were
baited
by
it
.
In
the
twilight
and
the
*NL*
night
the
rabbits
came
regularly
and
made
a
hearty
meal
.
All
day
long
*NL*
the
red
squirrels
came
and
went
,
and
afforded
me
much
entertainment
by
*NL*
their
manoeuvres
.
One
would
approach
at
first
warily
through
the
shrub
*NL*
oaks
,
running
over
the
snow-crust
by
fits
and
starts
like
a
leaf
blown
*NL*
by
the
wind
,
now
a
few
paces
this
way
,
with
wonderful
speed
and
waste
*NL*
of
energy
,
making
inconceivable
haste
with
his
``
trotters
,
''
as
if
it
were
*NL*
for
a
wager
,
and
now
as
many
paces
that
way
,
but
never
getting
on
more
*NL*
than
half
a
rod
at
a
time
;
and
then
suddenly
pausing
with
a
ludicrous
*NL*
expression
and
a
gratuitous
somerset
,
as
if
all
the
eyes
in
the
universe
*NL*
were
eyed
on
him
--
for
all
the
motions
of
a
squirrel
,
even
in
the
most
*NL*
solitary
recesses
of
the
forest
,
imply
spectators
as
much
as
those
of
a
*NL*
dancing
girl
--
wasting
more
time
in
delay
and
circumspection
than
would
*NL*
have
sufficed
to
walk
the
whole
distance
--
I
never
saw
one
walk
--
and
then
*NL*
suddenly
,
before
you
could
say
Jack
Robinson
,
he
would
be
in
the
top
*NL*
of
a
young
pitch
pine
,
winding
up
his
clock
and
chiding
all
imaginary
*NL*
spectators
,
soliloquizing
and
talking
to
all
the
universe
at
the
same
*NL*
time
--
for
no
reason
that
I
could
ever
detect
,
or
he
himself
was
aware
*NL*
of
,
I
suspect
.
At
length
he
would
reach
the
corn
,
and
selecting
a
*NL*
suitable
ear
,
frisk
about
in
the
same
uncertain
trigonometrical
way
to
*NL*
the
topmost
stick
of
my
wood-pile
,
before
my
window
,
where
he
looked
me
*NL*
in
the
face
,
and
there
sit
for
hours
,
supplying
himself
with
a
new
*NL*
ear
from
time
to
time
,
nibbling
at
first
voraciously
and
throwing
the
*NL*
half-naked
cobs
about
;
till
at
length
he
grew
more
dainty
still
and
*NL*
played
with
his
food
,
tasting
only
the
inside
of
the
kernel
,
and
the
*NL*
ear
,
which
was
held
balanced
over
the
stick
by
one
paw
,
slipped
from
*NL*
his
careless
grasp
and
fell
to
the
ground
,
when
he
would
look
over
at
it
*NL*
with
a
ludicrous
expression
of
uncertainty
,
as
if
suspecting
that
it
had
*NL*
life
,
with
a
mind
not
made
up
whether
to
get
it
again
,
or
a
new
one
,
*NL*
or
be
off
;
now
thinking
of
corn
,
then
listening
to
hear
what
was
in
*NL*
the
wind
.
So
the
little
impudent
fellow
would
waste
many
an
ear
in
*NL*
a
forenoon
;
till
at
last
,
seizing
some
longer
and
plumper
one
,
*NL*
considerably
bigger
than
himself
,
and
skilfully
balancing
it
,
he
would
*NL*
set
out
with
it
to
the
woods
,
like
a
tiger
with
a
buffalo
,
by
the
same
*NL*
zig-zag
course
and
frequent
pauses
,
scratching
along
with
it
as
if
it
*NL*
were
too
heavy
for
him
and
falling
all
the
while
,
making
its
fall
a
*NL*
diagonal
between
a
perpendicular
and
horizontal
,
being
determined
to
*NL*
put
it
through
at
any
rate
;
--
a
singularly
frivolous
and
whimsical
*NL*
fellow
;
--
and
so
he
would
get
off
with
it
to
where
he
lived
,
perhaps
*NL*
carry
it
to
the
top
of
a
pine
tree
forty
or
fifty
rods
distant
,
and
*NL*
I
would
afterwards
find
the
cobs
strewn
about
the
woods
in
various
*NL*
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
jays
arrive
,
whose
discordant
screams
were
heard
long
*NL*
before
,
as
they
were
warily
making
their
approach
an
eighth
of
a
mile
*NL*
off
,
and
in
a
stealthy
and
sneaking
manner
they
flit
from
tree
to
tree
,
*NL*
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
pick
up
the
kernels
which
the
squirrels
have
*NL*
dropped
.
Then
,
sitting
on
a
pitch
pine
bough
,
they
attempt
to
swallow
in
*NL*
their
haste
a
kernel
which
is
too
big
for
their
throats
and
chokes
*NL*
them
;
and
after
great
labor
they
disgorge
it
,
and
spend
an
hour
in
*NL*
the
endeavor
to
crack
it
by
repeated
blows
with
their
bills
.
They
*NL*
were
manifestly
thieves
,
and
I
had
not
much
respect
for
them
;
but
the
*NL*
squirrels
,
though
at
first
shy
,
went
to
work
as
if
they
were
taking
what
*NL*
was
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
also
came
the
chickadees
in
flocks
,
which
,
picking
up
the
*NL*
crumbs
the
squirrels
had
dropped
,
flew
to
the
nearest
twig
and
,
placing
*NL*
them
under
their
claws
,
hammered
away
at
them
with
their
little
bills
,
*NL*
as
if
it
were
an
insect
in
the
bark
,
till
they
were
sufficiently
reduced
*NL*
for
their
slender
throats
.
A
little
flock
of
these
titmice
came
daily
to
*NL*
pick
a
dinner
out
of
my
woodpile
,
or
the
crumbs
at
my
door
,
with
faint
*NL*
flitting
lisping
notes
,
like
the
tinkling
of
icicles
in
the
grass
,
or
*NL*
else
with
sprightly
_
day
day
day
_
,
or
more
rarely
,
in
spring-like
days
,
*NL*
a
wiry
summery
_
phe-be
_
from
the
woodside
.
They
were
so
familiar
that
at
*NL*
length
one
alighted
on
an
armful
of
wood
which
I
was
carrying
in
,
and
*NL*
pecked
at
the
sticks
without
fear
.
I
once
had
a
sparrow
alight
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
for
a
moment
while
I
was
hoeing
in
a
village
garden
,
and
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
was
more
distinguished
by
that
circumstance
than
I
should
have
*NL*
been
by
any
epaulet
I
could
have
worn
.
The
squirrels
also
grew
at
last
*NL*
to
be
quite
familiar
,
and
occasionally
stepped
upon
my
shoe
,
when
that
*NL*
was
the
nearest
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ground
was
not
yet
quite
covered
,
and
again
near
the
end
of
*NL*
winter
,
when
the
snow
was
melted
on
my
south
hillside
and
about
my
*NL*
wood-pile
,
the
partridges
came
out
of
the
woods
morning
and
evening
to
*NL*
feed
there
.
Whichever
side
you
walk
in
the
woods
the
partridge
bursts
*NL*
away
on
whirring
wings
,
jarring
the
snow
from
the
dry
leaves
and
twigs
*NL*
on
high
,
which
comes
sifting
down
in
the
sunbeams
like
golden
dust
,
for
*NL*
this
brave
bird
is
not
to
be
scared
by
winter
.
It
is
frequently
covered
*NL*
up
by
drifts
,
and
,
it
is
said
,
``
sometimes
plunges
from
on
wing
into
the
*NL*
soft
snow
,
where
it
remains
concealed
for
a
day
or
two
.
''
I
used
to
start
*NL*
them
in
the
open
land
also
,
where
they
had
come
out
of
the
woods
at
*NL*
sunset
to
``
bud
''
the
wild
apple
trees
.
They
will
come
regularly
every
*NL*
evening
to
particular
trees
,
where
the
cunning
sportsman
lies
in
wait
*NL*
for
them
,
and
the
distant
orchards
next
the
woods
suffer
thus
not
*NL*
a
little
.
I
am
glad
that
the
partridge
gets
fed
,
at
any
rate
.
It
is
*NL*
Nature
's
own
bird
which
lives
on
buds
and
diet
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
dark
winter
mornings
,
or
in
short
winter
afternoons
,
I
sometimes
*NL*
heard
a
pack
of
hounds
threading
all
the
woods
with
hounding
cry
and
*NL*
yelp
,
unable
to
resist
the
instinct
of
the
chase
,
and
the
note
of
the
*NL*
hunting-horn
at
intervals
,
proving
that
man
was
in
the
rear
.
The
woods
*NL*
ring
again
,
and
yet
no
fox
bursts
forth
on
to
the
open
level
of
the
*NL*
pond
,
nor
following
pack
pursuing
their
ActA
|
on
.
And
perhaps
at
evening
*NL*
I
see
the
hunters
returning
with
a
single
brush
trailing
from
their
*NL*
sleigh
for
a
trophy
,
seeking
their
inn
.
They
tell
me
that
if
the
fox
*NL*
would
remain
in
the
bosom
of
the
frozen
earth
he
would
be
safe
,
or
if
he
*NL*
would
run
in
a
straight
line
away
no
foxhound
could
overtake
him
;
but
,
*NL*
having
left
his
pursuers
far
behind
,
he
stops
to
rest
and
listen
till
*NL*
they
come
up
,
and
when
he
runs
he
circles
round
to
his
old
haunts
,
where
*NL*
the
hunters
await
him
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
he
will
run
upon
a
wall
many
*NL*
rods
,
and
then
leap
off
far
to
one
side
,
and
he
appears
to
know
that
*NL*
water
will
not
retain
his
scent
.
A
hunter
told
me
that
he
once
saw
a
fox
*NL*
pursued
by
hounds
burst
out
on
to
Walden
when
the
ice
was
covered
with
*NL*
shallow
puddles
,
run
part
way
across
,
and
then
return
to
the
same
shore
.
*NL*
Ere
long
the
hounds
arrived
,
but
here
they
lost
the
scent
.
Sometimes
*NL*
a
pack
hunting
by
themselves
would
pass
my
door
,
and
circle
round
my
*NL*
house
,
and
yelp
and
hound
without
regarding
me
,
as
if
afflicted
by
a
*NL*
species
of
madness
,
so
that
nothing
could
divert
them
from
the
pursuit
.
*NL*
Thus
they
circle
until
they
fall
upon
the
recent
trail
of
a
fox
,
for
a
*NL*
wise
hound
will
forsake
everything
else
for
this
.
One
day
a
man
came
*NL*
to
my
hut
from
Lexington
to
inquire
after
his
hound
that
made
a
large
*NL*
track
,
and
had
been
hunting
for
a
week
by
himself
.
But
I
fear
that
he
*NL*
was
not
the
wiser
for
all
I
told
him
,
for
every
time
I
attempted
to
*NL*
answer
his
questions
he
interrupted
me
by
asking
,
``
What
do
you
do
here
?
''
*NL*
He
had
lost
a
dog
,
but
found
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
old
hunter
who
has
a
dry
tongue
,
who
used
to
come
to
bathe
in
Walden
*NL*
once
every
year
when
the
water
was
warmest
,
and
at
such
times
looked
in
*NL*
upon
me
,
told
me
that
many
years
ago
he
took
his
gun
one
afternoon
and
*NL*
went
out
for
a
cruise
in
Walden
Wood
;
and
as
he
walked
the
Wayland
road
*NL*
he
heard
the
cry
of
hounds
approaching
,
and
ere
long
a
fox
leaped
the
*NL*
wall
into
the
road
,
and
as
quick
as
thought
leaped
the
other
wall
out
of
*NL*
the
road
,
and
his
swift
bullet
had
not
touched
him
.
Some
way
behind
came
*NL*
an
old
hound
and
her
three
pups
in
full
pursuit
,
hunting
on
their
own
*NL*
account
,
and
disappeared
again
in
the
woods
.
Late
in
the
afternoon
,
as
*NL*
he
was
resting
in
the
thick
woods
south
of
Walden
,
he
heard
the
voice
*NL*
of
the
hounds
far
over
toward
Fair
Haven
still
pursuing
the
fox
;
and
*NL*
on
they
came
,
their
hounding
cry
which
made
all
the
woods
ring
sounding
*NL*
nearer
and
nearer
,
now
from
Well
Meadow
,
now
from
the
Baker
Farm
.
For
*NL*
a
long
time
he
stood
still
and
listened
to
their
music
,
so
sweet
to
*NL*
a
hunter
's
ear
,
when
suddenly
the
fox
appeared
,
threading
the
solemn
*NL*
aisles
with
an
easy
coursing
pace
,
whose
sound
was
concealed
by
a
*NL*
sympathetic
rustle
of
the
leaves
,
swift
and
still
,
keeping
the
round
,
*NL*
leaving
his
pursuers
far
behind
;
and
,
leaping
upon
a
rock
amid
the
*NL*
woods
,
he
sat
erect
and
listening
,
with
his
back
to
the
hunter
.
For
*NL*
a
moment
compassion
restrained
the
latter
's
arm
;
but
that
was
a
*NL*
short-lived
mood
,
and
as
quick
as
thought
can
follow
thought
his
piece
*NL*
was
levelled
,
and
_
whang
!
_
--
the
fox
,
rolling
over
the
rock
,
lay
dead
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
hunter
still
kept
his
place
and
listened
to
the
hounds
.
*NL*
Still
on
they
came
,
and
now
the
near
woods
resounded
through
all
their
*NL*
aisles
with
their
demoniac
cry
.
At
length
the
old
hound
burst
into
view
*NL*
with
muzzle
to
the
ground
,
and
snapping
the
air
as
if
possessed
,
and
ran
*NL*
directly
to
the
rock
;
but
,
spying
the
dead
fox
,
she
suddenly
ceased
her
*NL*
hounding
as
if
struck
dumb
with
amazement
,
and
walked
round
and
round
*NL*
him
in
silence
;
and
one
by
one
her
pups
arrived
,
and
,
like
their
mother
,
*NL*
were
sobered
into
silence
by
the
mystery
.
Then
the
hunter
came
forward
*NL*
and
stood
in
their
midst
,
and
the
mystery
was
solved
.
They
waited
in
*NL*
silence
while
he
skinned
the
fox
,
then
followed
the
brush
a
while
,
and
*NL*
at
length
turned
off
into
the
woods
again
.
That
evening
a
Weston
squire
*NL*
came
to
the
Concord
hunter
's
cottage
to
inquire
for
his
hounds
,
and
told
*NL*
how
for
a
week
they
had
been
hunting
on
their
own
account
from
Weston
*NL*
woods
.
The
Concord
hunter
told
him
what
he
knew
and
offered
him
the
*NL*
skin
;
but
the
other
declined
it
and
departed
.
He
did
not
find
his
hounds
*NL*
that
night
,
but
the
next
day
learned
that
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
*NL*
put
up
at
a
farmhouse
for
the
night
,
whence
,
having
been
well
fed
,
they
*NL*
took
their
departure
early
in
the

*NL*
The
hunter
who
told
me
this
could
remember
one
Sam
Nutting
,
who
used
*NL*
to
hunt
bears
on
Fair
Haven
Ledges
,
and
exchange
their
skins
for
rum
*NL*
in
Concord
village
;
who
told
him
,
even
,
that
he
had
seen
a
moose
*NL*
there
.
Nutting
had
a
famous
foxhound
named
Burgoyne
--
he
pronounced
it
*NL*
Bugine
--
which
my
informant
used
to
borrow
.
In
the
``
Wast
Book
''
of
an
*NL*
old
trader
of
this
town
,
who
was
also
a
captain
,
town-clerk
,
and
*NL*
representative
,
I
find
the
following
entry
.

and
in

his

Hezekiah

credit

''
;
of
course
,
a
wild-cat
,
for
Stratton
was
a
sergeant
in
*NL*
the
old
French
war
,
and
would
not
have
got
credit
for
hunting
less
noble
*NL*
game
.
Credit
is
given
for
deerskins
also
,
and
they
were
daily
sold
.
One
*NL*
man
still
preserves
the
horns
of
the
last
deer
that
was
killed
in
this
*NL*
vicinity
,
and
another
has
told
me
the
particulars
of
the
hunt
in
which
*NL*
his
uncle
was
engaged
.
The
hunters
were
formerly
a
numerous
and
merry
*NL*
crew
here
.
I
remember
well
one
gaunt
Nimrod
who
would
catch
up
a
leaf
*NL*
by
the
roadside
and
play
a
strain
on
it
wilder
and
more
melodious
,
if
my
*NL*
memory
serves
me
,
than
any
hunting-horn
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
,
when
there
was
a
moon
,
I
sometimes
met
with
hounds
in
my
*NL*
path
prowling
about
the
woods
,
which
would
skulk
out
of
my
way
,
as
if
*NL*
afraid
,
and
stand
silent
amid
the
bushes
till
I
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Squirrels
and
wild
mice
disputed
for
my
store
of
nuts
.
There
were
scores
*NL*
of
pitch
pines
around
my
house
,
from
one
to
four
inches
in
diameter
,
*NL*
which
had
been
gnawed
by
mice
the
previous
winter
--
a
Norwegian
winter
*NL*
for
them
,
for
the
snow
lay
long
and
deep
,
and
they
were
obliged
to
mix
*NL*
a
large
proportion
of
pine
bark
with
their
other
diet
.
These
trees
were
*NL*
alive
and
apparently
flourishing
at
midsummer
,
and
many
of
them
had
*NL*
grown
a
foot
,
though
completely
girdled
;
but
after
another
winter
such
*NL*
were
without
exception
dead
.
It
is
remarkable
that
a
single
mouse
should
*NL*
thus
be
allowed
a
whole
pine
tree
for
its
dinner
,
gnawing
round
instead
*NL*
of
up
and
down
it
;
but
perhaps
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
thin
these
*NL*
trees
,
which
are
wont
to
grow
up
densely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hares
-LRB-
_
Lepus
Americanus
_
-RRB-
were
very
familiar
.
One
had
her
form
under
*NL*
my
house
all
winter
,
separated
from
me
only
by
the
flooring
,
and
*NL*
she
startled
me
each
morning
by
her
hasty
departure
when
I
began
to
*NL*
stir
--
thump
,
thump
,
thump
,
striking
her
head
against
the
floor
timbers
*NL*
in
her
hurry
.
They
used
to
come
round
my
door
at
dusk
to
nibble
the
*NL*
potato
parings
which
I
had
thrown
out
,
and
were
so
nearly
the
color
of
*NL*
the
ground
that
they
could
hardly
be
distinguished
when
still
.
Sometimes
*NL*
in
the
twilight
I
alternately
lost
and
recovered
sight
of
one
sitting
*NL*
motionless
under
my
window
.
When
I
opened
my
door
in
the
evening
,
off
*NL*
they
would
go
with
a
squeak
and
a
bounce
.
Near
at
hand
they
only
excited
*NL*
my
pity
.
One
evening
one
sat
by
my
door
two
paces
from
me
,
at
first
*NL*
trembling
with
fear
,
yet
unwilling
to
move
;
a
poor
wee
thing
,
lean
and
*NL*
bony
,
with
ragged
ears
and
sharp
nose
,
scant
tail
and
slender
paws
.
It
*NL*
looked
as
if
Nature
no
longer
contained
the
breed
of
nobler
bloods
,
but
*NL*
stood
on
her
last
toes
.
Its
large
eyes
appeared
young
and
unhealthy
,
*NL*
almost
dropsical
.
I
took
a
step
,
and
lo
,
away
it
scud
with
an
elastic
*NL*
spring
over
the
snow-crust
,
straightening
its
body
and
its
limbs
into
*NL*
graceful
length
,
and
soon
put
the
forest
between
me
and
itself
--
the
wild
*NL*
free
venison
,
asserting
its
vigor
and
the
dignity
of
Nature
.
Not
without
*NL*
reason
was
its
slenderness
.
Such
then
was
its
nature
.
-LRB-
_
Lepus

,
_

,
*NL*
light-foot
,
some
think

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
a
country
without
rabbits
and
partridges
?
They
are
among
the
*NL*
most
simple
and
indigenous
animal
products
;
ancient
and
venerable
*NL*
families
known
to
antiquity
as
to
modern
times
;
of
the
very
hue
and
*NL*
substance
of
Nature
,
nearest
allied
to
leaves
and
to
the
ground
--
and
to
*NL*
one
another
;
it
is
either
winged
or
it
is
legged
.
It
is
hardly
as
if
you
*NL*
had
seen
a
wild
creature
when
a
rabbit
or
a
partridge
bursts
away
,
only
*NL*
a
natural
one
,
as
much
to
be
expected
as
rustling
leaves
.
The
partridge
*NL*
and
the
rabbit
are
still
sure
to
thrive
,
like
true
natives
of
the
soil
,
*NL*
whatever
revolutions
occur
.
If
the
forest
is
cut
off
,
the
sprouts
and
*NL*
bushes
which
spring
up
afford
them
concealment
,
and
they
become
more
*NL*
numerous
than
ever
.
That
must
be
a
poor
country
indeed
that
does
not
*NL*
support
a
hare
.
Our
woods
teem
with
them
both
,
and
around
every
swamp
*NL*
may
be
seen
the
partridge
or
rabbit
walk
,
beset
with
twiggy
fences
and
*NL*
horse-hair
snares
,
which
some
cow-boy
tends
.

The
Pond
in
Winter
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
still
winter
night
I
awoke
with
the
impression
that
some
*NL*
question
had
been
put
to
me
,
which
I
had
been
endeavoring
in
vain
to
*NL*
answer
in
my
sleep
,
as
what
--
how
--
when
--
where
?
But
there
was
dawning
*NL*
Nature
,
in
whom
all
creatures
live
,
looking
in
at
my
broad
windows
with
*NL*
serene
and
satisfied
face
,
and
no
question
on
_
her
_
lips
.
I
awoke
to
an
*NL*
answered
question
,
to
Nature
and
daylight
.
The
snow
lying
deep
on
the
*NL*
earth
dotted
with
young
pines
,
and
the
very
slope
of
the
hill
on
which
*NL*
my
house
is
placed
,
seemed
to
say
,
Forward
!
Nature
puts
no
question
*NL*
and
answers
none
which
we
mortals
ask
.
She
has
long
ago
taken
her
*NL*
resolution
.
``
O
Prince
,
our
eyes
contemplate
with
admiration
and
transmit
*NL*
to
the
soul
the
wonderful
and
varied
spectacle
of
this
universe
.
The
*NL*
night
veils
without
doubt
a
part
of
this
glorious
creation
;
but
day
*NL*
comes
to
reveal
to
us
this
great
work
,
which
extends
from
earth
even
*NL*
into
the
plains
of
the
ether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
to
my
morning
work
.
First
I
take
an
axe
and
pail
and
go
in
search
*NL*
of
water
,
if
that
be
not
a
dream
.
After
a
cold
and
snowy
night
it
needed
*NL*
a
divining-rod
to
find
it
.
Every
winter
the
liquid
and
trembling
surface
*NL*
of
the
pond
,
which
was
so
sensitive
to
every
breath
,
and
reflected
every
*NL*
light
and
shadow
,
becomes
solid
to
the
depth
of
a
foot
or
a
foot
and
a
*NL*
half
,
so
that
it
will
support
the
heaviest
teams
,
and
perchance
the
snow
*NL*
covers
it
to
an
equal
depth
,
and
it
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
any
*NL*
level
field
.
Like
the
marmots
in
the
surrounding
hills
,
it
closes
its
*NL*
eyelids
and
becomes
dormant
for
three
months
or
more
.
Standing
on
the
*NL*
snow-covered
plain
,
as
if
in
a
pasture
amid
the
hills
,
I
cut
my
way
*NL*
first
through
a
foot
of
snow
,
and
then
a
foot
of
ice
,
and
open
a
window
*NL*
under
my
feet
,
where
,
kneeling
to
drink
,
I
look
down
into
the
quiet
*NL*
parlor
of
the
fishes
,
pervaded
by
a
softened
light
as
through
a
window
*NL*
of
ground
glass
,
with
its
bright
sanded
floor
the
same
as
in
summer
;
*NL*
there
a
perennial
waveless
serenity
reigns
as
in
the
amber
twilight
*NL*
sky
,
corresponding
to
the
cool
and
even
temperament
of
the
inhabitants
.
*NL*
Heaven
is
under
our
feet
is
well
as
over
our
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
,
while
all
things
are
crisp
with
frost
,
men
come
*NL*
with
fishing-reels
and
slender
lunch
,
and
let
down
their
fine
lines
*NL*
through
the
snowy
field
to
take
pickerel
and
perch
;
wild
men
,
who
*NL*
instinctively
follow
other
fashions
and
trust
other
authorities
than
*NL*
their
townsmen
,
and
by
their
goings
and
comings
stitch
towns
together
in
*NL*
parts
where
else
they
would
be
ripped
.
They
sit
and
eat
their
luncheon
*NL*
in
stout
fear-naughts
on
the
dry
oak
leaves
on
the
shore
,
as
wise
in
*NL*
natural
lore
as
the
citizen
is
in
artificial
.
They
never
consulted
with
*NL*
books
,
and
know
and
can
tell
much
less
than
they
have
done
.
The
things
*NL*
which
they
practice
are
said
not
yet
to
be
known
.
Here
is
one
fishing
*NL*
for
pickerel
with
grown
perch
for
bait
.
You
look
into
his
pail
with
*NL*
wonder
as
into
a
summer
pond
,
as
if
he
kept
summer
locked
up
at
home
,
or
*NL*
knew
where
she
had
retreated
.
How
,
pray
,
did
he
get
these
in
midwinter
?
*NL*
Oh
,
he
got
worms
out
of
rotten
logs
since
the
ground
froze
,
and
so
he
*NL*
caught
them
.
His
life
itself
passes
deeper
in
nature
than
the
studies
*NL*
of
the
naturalist
penetrate
;
himself
a
subject
for
the
naturalist
.
*NL*
The
latter
raises
the
moss
and
bark
gently
with
his
knife
in
search
of
*NL*
insects
;
the
former
lays
open
logs
to
their
core
with
his
axe
,
and
moss
*NL*
and
bark
fly
far
and
wide
.
He
gets
his
living
by
barking
trees
.
Such
a
*NL*
man
has
some
right
to
fish
,
and
I
love
to
see
nature
carried
out
in
him
.
*NL*
The
perch
swallows
the
grub-worm
,
the
pickerel
swallows
the
perch
,
and
*NL*
the
fisher-man
swallows
the
pickerel
;
and
so
all
the
chinks
in
the
scale
*NL*
of
being
are
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
strolled
around
the
pond
in
misty
weather
I
was
sometimes
amused
*NL*
by
the
primitive
mode
which
some
ruder
fisherman
had
adopted
.
He
would
*NL*
perhaps
have
placed
alder
branches
over
the
narrow
holes
in
the
ice
,
*NL*
which
were
four
or
five
rods
apart
and
an
equal
distance
from
the
shore
,
*NL*
and
having
fastened
the
end
of
the
line
to
a
stick
to
prevent
its
being
*NL*
pulled
through
,
have
passed
the
slack
line
over
a
twig
of
the
alder
,
a
*NL*
foot
or
more
above
the
ice
,
and
tied
a
dry
oak
leaf
to
it
,
which
,
being
*NL*
pulled
down
,
would
show
when
he
had
a
bite
.
These
alders
loomed
through
*NL*
the
mist
at
regular
intervals
as
you
walked
half
way
round
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
the
pickerel
of
Walden
!
when
I
see
them
lying
on
the
ice
,
or
in
the
*NL*
well
which
the
fisherman
cuts
in
the
ice
,
making
a
little
hole
to
admit
*NL*
the
water
,
I
am
always
surprised
by
their
rare
beauty
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
fabulous
fishes
,
they
are
so
foreign
to
the
streets
,
even
to
the
woods
,
*NL*
foreign
as
Arabia
to
our
Concord
life
.
They
possess
a
quite
dazzling
*NL*
and
transcendent
beauty
which
separates
them
by
a
wide
interval
from
the
*NL*
cadaverous
cod
and
haddock
whose
fame
is
trumpeted
in
our
streets
.
They
*NL*
are
not
green
like
the
pines
,
nor
gray
like
the
stones
,
nor
blue
like
*NL*
the
sky
;
but
they
have
,
to
my
eyes
,
if
possible
,
yet
rarer
colors
,
like
*NL*
flowers
and
precious
stones
,
as
if
they
were
the
pearls
,
the
animalized
*NL*
nuclei
or
crystals
of
the
Walden
water
.
They
,
of
course
,
are
Walden
*NL*
all
over
and
all
through
;
are
themselves
small
Waldens
in
the
animal
*NL*
kingdom
,
Waldenses
.
It
is
surprising
that
they
are
caught
here
--
that
*NL*
in
this
deep
and
capacious
spring
,
far
beneath
the
rattling
teams
and
*NL*
chaises
and
tinkling
sleighs
that
travel
the
Walden
road
,
this
great
*NL*
gold
and
emerald
fish
swims
.
I
never
chanced
to
see
its
kind
in
any
*NL*
market
;
it
would
be
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
there
.
Easily
,
with
a
*NL*
few
convulsive
quirks
,
they
give
up
their
watery
ghosts
,
like
a
mortal
*NL*
translated
before
his
time
to
the
thin
air
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*

As
I
was
desirous
to
recover
the
long
lost
bottom
of
Walden
Pond
,
I
*NL*
surveyed
it
carefully
,
before
the
ice
broke
up
,
early
in
'
46
,
with
*NL*
compass
and
chain
and
sounding
line
.
There
have
been
many
stories
told
*NL*
about
the
bottom
,
or
rather
no
bottom
,
of
this
pond
,
which
certainly
had
*NL*
no
foundation
for
themselves
.
It
is
remarkable
how
long
men
will
believe
*NL*
in
the
bottomlessness
of
a
pond
without
taking
the
trouble
to
sound
*NL*
it
.
I
have
visited
two
such
Bottomless
Ponds
in
one
walk
in
this
*NL*
neighborhood
.
Many
have
believed
that
Walden
reached
quite
through
to
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
globe
.
Some
who
have
lain
flat
on
the
ice
for
*NL*
a
long
time
,
looking
down
through
the
illusive
medium
,
perchance
with
*NL*
watery
eyes
into
the
bargain
,
and
driven
to
hasty
conclusions
by
the
*NL*
fear
of
catching
cold
in
their
breasts
,
have
seen
vast
holes
``
into
which
*NL*
a
load
of
hay
might
be
driven
,
''
if
there
were
anybody
to
drive
it
,
the
*NL*
undoubted
source
of
the
Styx
and
entrance
to
the
Infernal
Regions
from
*NL*
these
parts
.
Others
have
gone
down
from
the
village
with
a
``
fifty-six
''
*NL*
and
a
wagon
load
of
inch
rope
,
but
yet
have
failed
to
find
any
bottom
;
*NL*
for
while
the
``
fifty-six
''
was
resting
by
the
way
,
they
were
paying
out
*NL*
the
rope
in
the
vain
attempt
to
fathom
their
truly
immeasurable
capacity
*NL*
for
marvellousness
.
But
I
can
assure
my
readers
that
Walden
has
a
*NL*
reasonably
tight
bottom
at
a
not
unreasonable
,
though
at
an
unusual
,
*NL*
depth
.
I
fathomed
it
easily
with
a
cod-line
and
a
stone
weighing
about
*NL*
a
pound
and
a
half
,
and
could
tell
accurately
when
the
stone
left
the
*NL*
bottom
,
by
having
to
pull
so
much
harder
before
the
water
got
underneath
*NL*
to
help
me
.
The
greatest
depth
was
exactly
one
hundred
and
two
feet
;
to
*NL*
which
may
be
added
the
five
feet
which
it
has
risen
since
,
making
one
*NL*
hundred
and
seven
.
This
is
a
remarkable
depth
for
so
small
an
area
;
yet
*NL*
not
an
inch
of
it
can
be
spared
by
the
imagination
.
What
if
all
ponds
*NL*
were
shallow
?
Would
it
not
react
on
the
minds
of
men
?
I
am
thankful
that
*NL*
this
pond
was
made
deep
and
pure
for
a
symbol
.
While
men
believe
in
the
*NL*
infinite
some
ponds
will
be
thought
to
be
bottomless
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
factory-owner
,
hearing
what
depth
I
had
found
,
thought
that
it
could
*NL*
not
be
true
,
for
,
judging
from
his
acquaintance
with
dams
,
sand
would
*NL*
not
lie
at
so
steep
an
angle
.
But
the
deepest
ponds
are
not
so
deep
in
*NL*
proportion
to
their
area
as
most
suppose
,
and
,
if
drained
,
would
not
*NL*
leave
very
remarkable
valleys
.
They
are
not
like
cups
between
the
hills
;
*NL*
for
this
one
,
which
is
so
unusually
deep
for
its
area
,
appears
in
a
*NL*
vertical
section
through
its
centre
not
deeper
than
a
shallow
plate
.
*NL*
Most
ponds
,
emptied
,
would
leave
a
meadow
no
more
hollow
than
we
*NL*
frequently
see
.
William
Gilpin
,
who
is
so
admirable
in
all
that
relates
*NL*
to
landscapes
,
and
usually
so
correct
,
standing
at
the
head
of
Loch
*NL*
Fyne
,
in
Scotland
,
which
he
describes
as
``
a
bay
of
salt
water
,
sixty
*NL*
or
seventy
fathoms
deep
,
four
miles
in
breadth
,
''
and
about
fifty
miles
*NL*
long
,
surrounded
by
mountains
,
observes
,
``
If
we
could
have
seen
it
*NL*
immediately
after
the
diluvian
crash
,
or
whatever
convulsion
of
nature
*NL*
occasioned
it
,
before
the
waters
gushed
in
,
what
a
horrid
chasm
must
it
*NL*
have
appeared
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
high
as
heaved
the
tumid
hills
,
so
low
*NL*
Down
sunk
a
hollow
bottom
broad
and
deep
,
*NL*
Capacious
bed
of
waters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
,
using
the
shortest
diameter
of
Loch
Fyne
,
we
apply
these
*NL*
proportions
to
Walden
,
which
,
as
we
have
seen
,
appears
already
in
a
*NL*
vertical
section
only
like
a
shallow
plate
,
it
will
appear
four
times
*NL*
as
shallow
.
So
much
for
the
increased
horrors
of
the
chasm
of
Loch
*NL*
Fyne
when
emptied
.
No
doubt
many
a
smiling
valley
with
its
stretching
*NL*
cornfields
occupies
exactly
such
a
``
horrid
chasm
,
''
from
which
the
waters
*NL*
have
receded
,
though
it
requires
the
insight
and
the
far
sight
of
the
*NL*
geologist
to
convince
the
unsuspecting
inhabitants
of
this
fact
.
Often
*NL*
an
inquisitive
eye
may
detect
the
shores
of
a
primitive
lake
in
the
*NL*
low
horizon
hills
,
and
no
subsequent
elevation
of
the
plain
have
been
*NL*
necessary
to
conceal
their
history
.
But
it
is
easiest
,
as
they
who
work
*NL*
on
the
highways
know
,
to
find
the
hollows
by
the
puddles
after
a
shower
.
*NL*
The
amount
of
it
is
,
the
imagination
give
it
the
least
license
,
dives
*NL*
deeper
and
soars
higher
than
Nature
goes
.
So
,
probably
,
the
depth
of
the
*NL*
ocean
will
be
found
to
be
very
inconsiderable
compared
with
its
breadth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
sounded
through
the
ice
I
could
determine
the
shape
of
the
bottom
*NL*
with
greater
accuracy
than
is
possible
in
surveying
harbors
which
do
*NL*
not
freeze
over
,
and
I
was
surprised
at
its
general
regularity
.
In
the
*NL*
deepest
part
there
are
several
acres
more
level
than
almost
any
field
*NL*
which
is
exposed
to
the
sun
,
wind
,
and
plow
.
In
one
instance
,
on
a
line
*NL*
arbitrarily
chosen
,
the
depth
did
not
vary
more
than
one
foot
in
thirty
*NL*
rods
;
and
generally
,
near
the
middle
,
I
could
calculate
the
variation
*NL*
for
each
one
hundred
feet
in
any
direction
beforehand
within
three
or
*NL*
four
inches
.
Some
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
deep
and
dangerous
holes
*NL*
even
in
quiet
sandy
ponds
like
this
,
but
the
effect
of
water
under
these
*NL*
circumstances
is
to
level
all
inequalities
.
The
regularity
of
the
bottom
*NL*
and
its
conformity
to
the
shores
and
the
range
of
the
neighboring
*NL*
hills
were
so
perfect
that
a
distant
promontory
betrayed
itself
in
the
*NL*
soundings
quite
across
the
pond
,
and
its
direction
could
be
determined
*NL*
by
observing
the
opposite
shore
.
Cape
becomes
bar
,
and
plain
shoal
,
and
*NL*
valley
and
gorge
deep
water
and
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
mapped
the
pond
by
the
scale
of
ten
rods
to
an
inch
,
and
*NL*
put
down
the
soundings
,
more
than
a
hundred
in
all
,
I
observed
this
*NL*
remarkable
coincidence
.
Having
noticed
that
the
number
indicating
the
*NL*
greatest
depth
was
apparently
in
the
centre
of
the
map
,
I
laid
a
rule
*NL*
on
the
map
lengthwise
,
and
then
breadthwise
,
and
found
,
to
my
surprise
,
*NL*
that
the
line
of
greatest
length
intersected
the
line
of
greatest
*NL*
breadth
_
exactly
_
at
the
point
of
greatest
depth
,
notwithstanding
that
the
*NL*
middle
is
so
nearly
level
,
the
outline
of
the
pond
far
from
regular
,
and
*NL*
the
extreme
length
and
breadth
were
got
by
measuring
into
the
coves
;
and
*NL*
I
said
to
myself
,
Who
knows
but
this
hint
would
conduct
to
the
deepest
*NL*
part
of
the
ocean
as
well
as
of
a
pond
or
puddle
?
Is
not
this
the
rule
*NL*
also
for
the
height
of
mountains
,
regarded
as
the
opposite
of
valleys
?
*NL*
We
know
that
a
hill
is
not
highest
at
its
narrowest
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
five
coves
,
three
,
or
all
which
had
been
sounded
,
were
observed
to
*NL*
have
a
bar
quite
across
their
mouths
and
deeper
water
within
,
so
that
*NL*
the
bay
tended
to
be
an
expansion
of
water
within
the
land
not
only
*NL*
horizontally
but
vertically
,
and
to
form
a
basin
or
independent
pond
,
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
two
capes
showing
the
course
of
the
bar
.
Every
*NL*
harbor
on
the
sea-coast
,
also
,
has
its
bar
at
its
entrance
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
the
mouth
of
the
cove
was
wider
compared
with
its
length
,
*NL*
the
water
over
the
bar
was
deeper
compared
with
that
in
the
basin
.
*NL*
Given
,
then
,
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
cove
,
and
the
character
of
*NL*
the
surrounding
shore
,
and
you
have
almost
elements
enough
to
make
out
a
*NL*
formula
for
all
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
see
how
nearly
I
could
guess
,
with
this
experience
,
at
the
*NL*
deepest
point
in
a
pond
,
by
observing
the
outlines
of
a
surface
and
*NL*
the
character
of
its
shores
alone
,
I
made
a
plan
of
White
Pond
,
which
*NL*
contains
about
forty-one
acres
,
and
,
like
this
,
has
no
island
in
it
,
nor
*NL*
any
visible
inlet
or
outlet
;
and
as
the
line
of
greatest
breadth
fell
*NL*
very
near
the
line
of
least
breadth
,
where
two
opposite
capes
approached
*NL*
each
other
and
two
opposite
bays
receded
,
I
ventured
to
mark
a
point
a
*NL*
short
distance
from
the
latter
line
,
but
still
on
the
line
of
greatest
*NL*
length
,
as
the
deepest
.
The
deepest
part
was
found
to
be
within
one
*NL*
hundred
feet
of
this
,
still
farther
in
the
direction
to
which
I
had
*NL*
inclined
,
and
was
only
one
foot
deeper
,
namely
,
sixty
feet
.
Of
course
,
a
*NL*
stream
running
through
,
or
an
island
in
the
pond
,
would
make
the
problem
*NL*
much
more
complicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
knew
all
the
laws
of
Nature
,
we
should
need
only
one
fact
,
or
*NL*
the
description
of
one
actual
phenomenon
,
to
infer
all
the
particular
*NL*
results
at
that
point
.
Now
we
know
only
a
few
laws
,
and
our
result
is
*NL*
vitiated
,
not
,
of
course
,
by
any
confusion
or
irregularity
in
Nature
,
*NL*
but
by
our
ignorance
of
essential
elements
in
the
calculation
.
Our
*NL*
notions
of
law
and
harmony
are
commonly
confined
to
those
instances
*NL*
which
we
detect
;
but
the
harmony
which
results
from
a
far
greater
number
*NL*
of
seemingly
conflicting
,
but
really
concurring
,
laws
,
which
we
have
not
*NL*
detected
,
is
still
more
wonderful
.
The
particular
laws
are
as
our
points
*NL*
of
view
,
as
,
to
the
traveller
,
a
mountain
outline
varies
with
every
*NL*
step
,
and
it
has
an
infinite
number
of
profiles
,
though
absolutely
but
*NL*
one
form
.
Even
when
cleft
or
bored
through
it
is
not
comprehended
in
its
*NL*
entireness
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
have
observed
of
the
pond
is
no
less
true
in
ethics
.
It
is
the
*NL*
law
of
average
.
Such
a
rule
of
the
two
diameters
not
only
guides
us
*NL*
toward
the
sun
in
the
system
and
the
heart
in
man
,
but
draws
lines
*NL*
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
aggregate
of
a
man
's
particular
*NL*
daily
behaviors
and
waves
of
life
into
his
coves
and
inlets
,
and
where
*NL*
they
intersect
will
be
the
height
or
depth
of
his
character
.
Perhaps
*NL*
we
need
only
to
know
how
his
shores
trend
and
his
adjacent
country
*NL*
or
circumstances
,
to
infer
his
depth
and
concealed
bottom
.
If
he
is
*NL*
surrounded
by
mountainous
circumstances
,
an
Achillean
shore
,
whose
peaks
*NL*
overshadow
and
are
reflected
in
his
bosom
,
they
suggest
a
corresponding
*NL*
depth
in
him
.
But
a
low
and
smooth
shore
proves
him
shallow
on
that
*NL*
side
.
In
our
bodies
,
a
bold
projecting
brow
falls
off
to
and
indicates
a
*NL*
corresponding
depth
of
thought
.
Also
there
is
a
bar
across
the
entrance
*NL*
of
our
every
cove
,
or
particular
inclination
;
each
is
our
harbor
for
*NL*
a
season
,
in
which
we
are
detained
and
partially
land-locked
.
These
*NL*
inclinations
are
not
whimsical
usually
,
but
their
form
,
size
,
and
*NL*
direction
are
determined
by
the
promontories
of
the
shore
,
the
ancient
*NL*
axes
of
elevation
.
When
this
bar
is
gradually
increased
by
storms
,
*NL*
tides
,
or
currents
,
or
there
is
a
subsidence
of
the
waters
,
so
that
it
*NL*
reaches
to
the
surface
,
that
which
was
at
first
but
an
inclination
in
*NL*
the
shore
in
which
a
thought
was
harbored
becomes
an
individual
*NL*
lake
,
cut
off
from
the
ocean
,
wherein
the
thought
secures
its
own
*NL*
conditions
--
changes
,
perhaps
,
from
salt
to
fresh
,
becomes
a
sweet
sea
,
*NL*
dead
sea
,
or
a
marsh
.
At
the
advent
of
each
individual
into
this
life
,
*NL*
may
we
not
suppose
that
such
a
bar
has
risen
to
the
surface
somewhere
?
*NL*
It
is
true
,
we
are
such
poor
navigators
that
our
thoughts
,
for
the
most
*NL*
part
,
stand
off
and
on
upon
a
harborless
coast
,
are
conversant
only
with
*NL*
the
bights
of
the
bays
of
poesy
,
or
steer
for
the
public
ports
of
entry
,
*NL*
and
go
into
the
dry
docks
of
science
,
where
they
merely
refit
for
this
*NL*
world
,
and
no
natural
currents
concur
to
individualize
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
inlet
or
outlet
of
Walden
,
I
have
not
discovered
any
but
rain
*NL*
and
snow
and
evaporation
,
though
perhaps
,
with
a
thermometer
and
a
line
,
*NL*
such
places
may
be
found
,
for
where
the
water
flows
into
the
pond
it
*NL*
will
probably
be
coldest
in
summer
and
warmest
in
winter
.
When
the
*NL*
ice-men
were
at
work
here
in
'
46-7
,
the
cakes
sent
to
the
shore
were
one
*NL*
day
rejected
by
those
who
were
stacking
them
up
there
,
not
being
*NL*
thick
enough
to
lie
side
by
side
with
the
rest
;
and
the
cutters
thus
*NL*
discovered
that
the
ice
over
a
small
space
was
two
or
three
inches
*NL*
thinner
than
elsewhere
,
which
made
them
think
that
there
was
an
inlet
*NL*
there
.
They
also
showed
me
in
another
place
what
they
thought
was
a
*NL*
``
leach-hole
,
''
through
which
the
pond
leaked
out
under
a
hill
into
a
*NL*
neighboring
meadow
,
pushing
me
out
on
a
cake
of
ice
to
see
it
.
It
was
a
*NL*
small
cavity
under
ten
feet
of
water
;
but
I
think
that
I
can
warrant
the
*NL*
pond
not
to
need
soldering
till
they
find
a
worse
leak
than
that
.
*NL*
One
has
suggested
,
that
if
such
a
``
leach-hole
''
should
be
found
,
its
*NL*
connection
with
the
meadow
,
if
any
existed
,
might
be
proved
by
conveying
*NL*
some
colored
powder
or
sawdust
to
the
mouth
of
the
hole
,
and
then
*NL*
putting
a
strainer
over
the
spring
in
the
meadow
,
which
would
catch
some
*NL*
of
the
particles
carried
through
by
the
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
surveying
,
the
ice
,
which
was
sixteen
inches
thick
,
*NL*
undulated
under
a
slight
wind
like
water
.
It
is
well
known
that
a
*NL*
level
can
not
be
used
on
ice
.
At
one
rod
from
the
shore
its
greatest
*NL*
fluctuation
,
when
observed
by
means
of
a
level
on
land
directed
toward
*NL*
a
graduated
staff
on
the
ice
,
was
three
quarters
of
an
inch
,
though
the
*NL*
ice
appeared
firmly
attached
to
the
shore
.
It
was
probably
greater
in
*NL*
the
middle
.
Who
knows
but
if
our
instruments
were
delicate
enough
we
*NL*
might
detect
an
undulation
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
?
When
two
legs
of
*NL*
my
level
were
on
the
shore
and
the
third
on
the
ice
,
and
the
sights
*NL*
were
directed
over
the
latter
,
a
rise
or
fall
of
the
ice
of
an
almost
*NL*
infinitesimal
amount
made
a
difference
of
several
feet
on
a
tree
across
*NL*
the
pond
.
When
I
began
to
cut
holes
for
sounding
there
were
three
or
*NL*
four
inches
of
water
on
the
ice
under
a
deep
snow
which
had
sunk
it
*NL*
thus
far
;
but
the
water
began
immediately
to
run
into
these
holes
,
and
*NL*
continued
to
run
for
two
days
in
deep
streams
,
which
wore
away
the
ice
*NL*
on
every
side
,
and
contributed
essentially
,
if
not
mainly
,
to
dry
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
pond
;
for
,
as
the
water
ran
in
,
it
raised
and
floated
the
*NL*
ice
.
This
was
somewhat
like
cutting
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
a
ship
to
*NL*
let
the
water
out
.
When
such
holes
freeze
,
and
a
rain
succeeds
,
*NL*
and
finally
a
new
freezing
forms
a
fresh
smooth
ice
over
all
,
it
is
*NL*
beautifully
mottled
internally
by
dark
figures
,
shaped
somewhat
like
a
*NL*
spider
's
web
,
what
you
may
call
ice
rosettes
,
produced
by
the
channels
*NL*
worn
by
the
water
flowing
from
all
sides
to
a
centre
.
Sometimes
,
also
,
*NL*
when
the
ice
was
covered
with
shallow
puddles
,
I
saw
a
double
shadow
of
*NL*
myself
,
one
standing
on
the
head
of
the
other
,
one
on
the
ice
,
the
other
*NL*
on
the
trees
or
hillside
.
*NL*

While
yet
it
is
cold
January
,
and
snow
and
ice
are
thick
and
solid
,
the
*NL*
prudent
landlord
comes
from
the
village
to
get
ice
to
cool
his
summer
*NL*
drink
;
impressively
,
even
pathetically
,
wise
,
to
foresee
the
heat
and
*NL*
thirst
of
July
now
in
January
--
wearing
a
thick
coat
and
mittens
!
when
so
*NL*
many
things
are
not
provided
for
.
It
may
be
that
he
lays
up
no
treasures
*NL*
in
this
world
which
will
cool
his
summer
drink
in
the
next
.
He
cuts
and
*NL*
saws
the
solid
pond
,
unroofs
the
house
of
fishes
,
and
carts
off
their
*NL*
very
element
and
air
,
held
fast
by
chains
and
stakes
like
corded
wood
,
*NL*
through
the
favoring
winter
air
,
to
wintry
cellars
,
to
underlie
the
*NL*
summer
there
.
It
looks
like
solidified
azure
,
as
,
far
off
,
it
is
drawn
*NL*
through
the
streets
.
These
ice-cutters
are
a
merry
race
,
full
of
jest
*NL*
and
sport
,
and
when
I
went
among
them
they
were
wont
to
invite
me
to
saw
*NL*
pit-fashion
with
them
,
I
standing
underneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
winter
of
'
46-7
there
came
a
hundred
men
of
Hyperborean
*NL*
extraction
swoop
down
on
to
our
pond
one
morning
,
with
many
carloads
*NL*
of
ungainly-looking
farming
tools
--
sleds
,
plows
,
drill-barrows
,
*NL*
turf-knives
,
spades
,
saws
,
rakes
,
and
each
man
was
armed
with
a
*NL*
double-pointed
pike-staff
,
such
as
is
not
described
in
the
New-England
*NL*
Farmer
or
the
Cultivator
.
I
did
not
know
whether
they
had
come
to
sow
a
*NL*
crop
of
winter
rye
,
or
some
other
kind
of
grain
recently
introduced
from
*NL*
Iceland
.
As
I
saw
no
manure
,
I
judged
that
they
meant
to
skim
the
land
,
*NL*
as
I
had
done
,
thinking
the
soil
was
deep
and
had
lain
fallow
long
*NL*
enough
.
They
said
that
a
gentleman
farmer
,
who
was
behind
the
scenes
,
*NL*
wanted
to
double
his
money
,
which
,
as
I
understood
,
amounted
to
half
*NL*
a
million
already
;
but
in
order
to
cover
each
one
of
his
dollars
with
*NL*
another
,
he
took
off
the
only
coat
,
ay
,
the
skin
itself
,
of
Walden
*NL*
Pond
in
the
midst
of
a
hard
winter
.
They
went
to
work
at
once
,
plowing
,
*NL*
barrowing
,
rolling
,
furrowing
,
in
admirable
order
,
as
if
they
were
bent
*NL*
on
making
this
a
model
farm
;
but
when
I
was
looking
sharp
to
see
what
*NL*
kind
of
seed
they
dropped
into
the
furrow
,
a
gang
of
fellows
by
my
side
*NL*
suddenly
began
to
hook
up
the
virgin
mould
itself
,
with
a
peculiar
jerk
,
*NL*
clean
down
to
the
sand
,
or
rather
the
water
--
for
it
was
a
very
springy
*NL*
soil
--
indeed
all
the
_
terra
firma
_
there
was
--
and
haul
it
away
on
sleds
,
*NL*
and
then
I
guessed
that
they
must
be
cutting
peat
in
a
bog
.
So
they
came
*NL*
and
went
every
day
,
with
a
peculiar
shriek
from
the
locomotive
,
from
and
*NL*
to
some
point
of
the
polar
regions
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
like
a
flock
*NL*
of
arctic
snow-birds
.
But
sometimes
Squaw
Walden
had
her
revenge
,
and
*NL*
a
hired
man
,
walking
behind
his
team
,
slipped
through
a
crack
in
the
*NL*
ground
down
toward
Tartarus
,
and
he
who
was
so
brave
before
suddenly
*NL*
became
but
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
,
almost
gave
up
his
animal
heat
,
and
*NL*
was
glad
to
take
refuge
in
my
house
,
and
acknowledged
that
there
was
*NL*
some
virtue
in
a
stove
;
or
sometimes
the
frozen
soil
took
a
piece
of
*NL*
steel
out
of
a
plowshare
,
or
a
plow
got
set
in
the
furrow
and
had
to
be
*NL*
cut
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
speak
literally
,
a
hundred
Irishmen
,
with
Yankee
overseers
,
came
from
*NL*
Cambridge
every
day
to
get
out
the
ice
.
They
divided
it
into
cakes
by
*NL*
methods
too
well
known
to
require
description
,
and
these
,
being
sledded
*NL*
to
the
shore
,
were
rapidly
hauled
off
on
to
an
ice
platform
,
and
raised
*NL*
by
grappling
irons
and
block
and
tackle
,
worked
by
horses
,
on
to
a
*NL*
stack
,
as
surely
as
so
many
barrels
of
flour
,
and
there
placed
evenly
*NL*
side
by
side
,
and
row
upon
row
,
as
if
they
formed
the
solid
base
of
an
*NL*
obelisk
designed
to
pierce
the
clouds
.
They
told
me
that
in
a
good
day
*NL*
they
could
get
out
a
thousand
tons
,
which
was
the
yield
of
about
one
*NL*
acre
.
Deep
ruts
and
``
cradle-holes
''
were
worn
in
the
ice
,
as
on
_
terra
*NL*
firma
_
,
by
the
passage
of
the
sleds
over
the
same
track
,
and
the
horses
*NL*
invariably
ate
their
oats
out
of
cakes
of
ice
hollowed
out
like
buckets
.
*NL*
They
stacked
up
the
cakes
thus
in
the
open
air
in
a
pile
thirty-five
*NL*
feet
high
on
one
side
and
six
or
seven
rods
square
,
putting
hay
between
*NL*
the
outside
layers
to
exclude
the
air
;
for
when
the
wind
,
though
never
*NL*
so
cold
,
finds
a
passage
through
,
it
will
wear
large
cavities
,
leaving
*NL*
slight
supports
or
studs
only
here
and
there
,
and
finally
topple
it
*NL*
down
.
At
first
it
looked
like
a
vast
blue
fort
or
Valhalla
;
but
when
*NL*
they
began
to
tuck
the
coarse
meadow
hay
into
the
crevices
,
and
this
*NL*
became
covered
with
rime
and
icicles
,
it
looked
like
a
venerable
*NL*
moss-grown
and
hoary
ruin
,
built
of
azure-tinted
marble
,
the
abode
of
*NL*
Winter
,
that
old
man
we
see
in
the
almanac
--
his
shanty
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
a
design
to
estivate
with
us
.
They
calculated
that
not
twenty-five
per
*NL*
cent
of
this
would
reach
its
destination
,
and
that
two
or
three
per
cent
*NL*
would
be
wasted
in
the
cars
.
However
,
a
still
greater
part
of
this
heap
*NL*
had
a
different
destiny
from
what
was
intended
;
for
,
either
because
the
*NL*
ice
was
found
not
to
keep
so
well
as
was
expected
,
containing
more
air
*NL*
than
usual
,
or
for
some
other
reason
,
it
never
got
to
market
.
This
heap
,
*NL*
made
in
the
winter
of
'
46-7
and
estimated
to
contain
ten
thousand
tons
,
*NL*
was
finally
covered
with
hay
and
boards
;
and
though
it
was
unroofed
the
*NL*
following
July
,
and
a
part
of
it
carried
off
,
the
rest
remaining
exposed
*NL*
to
the
sun
,
it
stood
over
that
summer
and
the
next
winter
,
and
was
not
*NL*
quite
melted
till
September
,
1848
.
Thus
the
pond
recovered
the
greater
*NL*
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
the
water
,
the
Walden
ice
,
seen
near
at
hand
,
has
a
green
tint
,
but
*NL*
at
a
distance
is
beautifully
blue
,
and
you
can
easily
tell
it
from
the
*NL*
white
ice
of
the
river
,
or
the
merely
greenish
ice
of
some
ponds
,
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
mile
off
.
Sometimes
one
of
those
great
cakes
slips
from
the
*NL*
ice-man
's
sled
into
the
village
street
,
and
lies
there
for
a
week
like
a
*NL*
great
emerald
,
an
object
of
interest
to
all
passers
.
I
have
noticed
that
*NL*
a
portion
of
Walden
which
in
the
state
of
water
was
green
will
often
,
*NL*
when
frozen
,
appear
from
the
same
point
of
view
blue
.
So
the
hollows
*NL*
about
this
pond
will
,
sometimes
,
in
the
winter
,
be
filled
with
a
*NL*
greenish
water
somewhat
like
its
own
,
but
the
next
day
will
have
frozen
*NL*
blue
.
Perhaps
the
blue
color
of
water
and
ice
is
due
to
the
light
and
*NL*
air
they
contain
,
and
the
most
transparent
is
the
bluest
.
Ice
is
an
*NL*
interesting
subject
for
contemplation
.
They
told
me
that
they
had
some
*NL*
in
the
ice-houses
at
Fresh
Pond
five
years
old
which
was
as
good
as
*NL*
ever
.
Why
is
it
that
a
bucket
of
water
soon
becomes
putrid
,
but
frozen
*NL*
remains
sweet
forever
?
It
is
commonly
said
that
this
is
the
difference
*NL*
between
the
affections
and
the
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
for
sixteen
days
I
saw
from
my
window
a
hundred
men
at
work
like
*NL*
busy
husbandmen
,
with
teams
and
horses
and
apparently
all
the
implements
*NL*
of
farming
,
such
a
picture
as
we
see
on
the
first
page
of
the
almanac
;
*NL*
and
as
often
as
I
looked
out
I
was
reminded
of
the
fable
of
the
lark
and
*NL*
the
reapers
,
or
the
parable
of
the
sower
,
and
the
like
;
and
now
they
are
*NL*
all
gone
,
and
in
thirty
days
more
,
probably
,
I
shall
look
from
the
same
*NL*
window
on
the
pure
sea-green
Walden
water
there
,
reflecting
the
clouds
*NL*
and
the
trees
,
and
sending
up
its
evaporations
in
solitude
,
and
no
*NL*
traces
will
appear
that
a
man
has
ever
stood
there
.
Perhaps
I
shall
hear
*NL*
a
solitary
loon
laugh
as
he
dives
and
plumes
himself
,
or
shall
see
a
*NL*
lonely
fisher
in
his
boat
,
like
a
floating
leaf
,
beholding
his
form
*NL*
reflected
in
the
waves
,
where
lately
a
hundred
men
securely
labored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
appears
that
the
sweltering
inhabitants
of
Charleston
and
New
*NL*
Orleans
,
of
Madras
and
Bombay
and
Calcutta
,
drink
at
my
well
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
I
bathe
my
intellect
in
the
stupendous
and
cosmogonal
philosophy
*NL*
of
the
Bhagvat-Geeta
,
since
whose
composition
years
of
the
gods
*NL*
have
elapsed
,
and
in
comparison
with
which
our
modern
world
and
its
*NL*
literature
seem
puny
and
trivial
;
and
I
doubt
if
that
philosophy
is
*NL*
not
to
be
referred
to
a
previous
state
of
existence
,
so
remote
is
its
*NL*
sublimity
from
our
conceptions
.
I
lay
down
the
book
and
go
to
my
well
*NL*
for
water
,
and
lo
!
there
I
meet
the
servant
of
the
Bramin
,
priest
of
*NL*
Brahma
and
Vishnu
and
Indra
,
who
still
sits
in
his
temple
on
the
Ganges
*NL*
reading
the
Vedas
,
or
dwells
at
the
root
of
a
tree
with
his
crust
and
*NL*
water
jug
.
I
meet
his
servant
come
to
draw
water
for
his
master
,
and
*NL*
our
buckets
as
it
were
grate
together
in
the
same
well
.
The
pure
Walden
*NL*
water
is
mingled
with
the
sacred
water
of
the
Ganges
.
With
favoring
*NL*
winds
it
is
wafted
past
the
site
of
the
fabulous
islands
of
Atlantis
and
*NL*
the
Hesperides
,
makes
the
periplus
of
Hanno
,
and
,
floating
by
Ternate
*NL*
and
Tidore
and
the
mouth
of
the
Persian
Gulf
,
melts
in
the
tropic
gales
*NL*
of
the
Indian
seas
,
and
is
landed
in
ports
of
which
Alexander
only
heard
*NL*
the
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
opening
of
large
tracts
by
the
ice-cutters
commonly
causes
a
pond
*NL*
to
break
up
earlier
;
for
the
water
,
agitated
by
the
wind
,
even
in
cold
*NL*
weather
,
wears
away
the
surrounding
ice
.
But
such
was
not
the
effect
on
*NL*
Walden
that
year
,
for
she
had
soon
got
a
thick
new
garment
to
take
the
*NL*
place
of
the
old
.
This
pond
never
breaks
up
so
soon
as
the
others
in
*NL*
this
neighborhood
,
on
account
both
of
its
greater
depth
and
its
having
*NL*
no
stream
passing
through
it
to
melt
or
wear
away
the
ice
.
I
never
knew
*NL*
it
to
open
in
the
course
of
a
winter
,
not
excepting
that
of
'
52-3
,
which
*NL*
gave
the
ponds
so
severe
a
trial
.
It
commonly
opens
about
the
first
*NL*
of
April
,
a
week
or
ten
days
later
than
Flint
's
Pond
and
Fair
Haven
,
*NL*
beginning
to
melt
on
the
north
side
and
in
the
shallower
parts
where
*NL*
it
began
to
freeze
.
It
indicates
better
than
any
water
hereabouts
the
*NL*
absolute
progress
of
the
season
,
being
least
affected
by
transient
*NL*
changes
of
temperature
.
A
severe
cold
of
a
few
days
'
duration
in
*NL*
March
may
very
much
retard
the
opening
of
the
former
ponds
,
while
the
*NL*
temperature
of
Walden
increases
almost
uninterruptedly
.
A
thermometer
*NL*
thrust
into
the
middle
of
Walden
on
the
6th
of
March
,
1847
,
stood
at
*NL*
32Aº
,
or
freezing
point
;
near
the
shore
at
33Aº
;
in
the
middle
of
Flint
's
*NL*
Pond
,
the
same
day
,
at
32Aº
;
at
a
dozen
rods
from
the
shore
,
in
shallow
*NL*
water
,
under
ice
a
foot
thick
,
at
36Aº
.
This
difference
of
three
and
a
*NL*
half
degrees
between
the
temperature
of
the
deep
water
and
the
shallow
*NL*
in
the
latter
pond
,
and
the
fact
that
a
great
proportion
of
it
is
*NL*
comparatively
shallow
,
show
why
it
should
break
up
so
much
sooner
than
*NL*
Walden
.
The
ice
in
the
shallowest
part
was
at
this
time
several
inches
*NL*
thinner
than
in
the
middle
.
In
midwinter
the
middle
had
been
the
warmest
*NL*
and
the
ice
thinnest
there
.
So
,
also
,
every
one
who
has
waded
about
the
*NL*
shores
of
the
pond
in
summer
must
have
perceived
how
much
warmer
the
*NL*
water
is
close
to
the
shore
,
where
only
three
or
four
inches
deep
,
than
*NL*
a
little
distance
out
,
and
on
the
surface
where
it
is
deep
,
than
near
*NL*
the
bottom
.
In
spring
the
sun
not
only
exerts
an
influence
through
the
*NL*
increased
temperature
of
the
air
and
earth
,
but
its
heat
passes
through
*NL*
ice
a
foot
or
more
thick
,
and
is
reflected
from
the
bottom
in
shallow
*NL*
water
,
and
so
also
warms
the
water
and
melts
the
under
side
of
the
ice
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
melting
it
more
directly
above
,
making
*NL*
it
uneven
,
and
causing
the
air
bubbles
which
it
contains
to
extend
*NL*
themselves
upward
and
downward
until
it
is
completely
honeycombed
,
and
*NL*
at
last
disappears
suddenly
in
a
single
spring
rain
.
Ice
has
its
grain
*NL*
as
well
as
wood
,
and
when
a
cake
begins
to
rot
or
``
comb
,
''
that
is
,
*NL*
assume
the
appearance
of
honeycomb
,
whatever
may
be
its
position
,
the
*NL*
air
cells
are
at
right
angles
with
what
was
the
water
surface
.
Where
*NL*
there
is
a
rock
or
a
log
rising
near
to
the
surface
the
ice
over
it
is
*NL*
much
thinner
,
and
is
frequently
quite
dissolved
by
this
reflected
heat
;
*NL*
and
I
have
been
told
that
in
the
experiment
at
Cambridge
to
freeze
water
*NL*
in
a
shallow
wooden
pond
,
though
the
cold
air
circulated
underneath
,
and
*NL*
so
had
access
to
both
sides
,
the
reflection
of
the
sun
from
the
bottom
*NL*
more
than
counterbalanced
this
advantage
.
When
a
warm
rain
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
winter
melts
off
the
snow-ice
from
Walden
,
and
leaves
a
hard
dark
*NL*
or
transparent
ice
on
the
middle
,
there
will
be
a
strip
of
rotten
though
*NL*
thicker
white
ice
,
a
rod
or
more
wide
,
about
the
shores
,
created
by
this
*NL*
reflected
heat
.
Also
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
bubbles
themselves
within
the
*NL*
ice
operate
as
burning-glasses
to
melt
the
ice
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phenomena
of
the
year
take
place
every
day
in
a
pond
on
a
small
*NL*
scale
.
Every
morning
,
generally
speaking
,
the
shallow
water
is
being
*NL*
warmed
more
rapidly
than
the
deep
,
though
it
may
not
be
made
so
warm
*NL*
after
all
,
and
every
evening
it
is
being
cooled
more
rapidly
until
the
*NL*
morning
.
The
day
is
an
epitome
of
the
year
.
The
night
is
the
winter
,
the
*NL*
morning
and
evening
are
the
spring
and
fall
,
and
the
noon
is
the
summer
.
*NL*
The
cracking
and
booming
of
the
ice
indicate
a
change
of
temperature
.
*NL*
One
pleasant
morning
after
a
cold
night
,
February
24th
,
1850
,
having
*NL*
gone
to
Flint
's
Pond
to
spend
the
day
,
I
noticed
with
surprise
,
that
*NL*
when
I
struck
the
ice
with
the
head
of
my
axe
,
it
resounded
like
a
gong
*NL*
for
many
rods
around
,
or
as
if
I
had
struck
on
a
tight
drum-head
.
*NL*
The
pond
began
to
boom
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
,
when
it
felt
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
sun
's
rays
slanted
upon
it
from
over
the
hills
;
*NL*
it
stretched
itself
and
yawned
like
a
waking
man
with
a
gradually
*NL*
increasing
tumult
,
which
was
kept
up
three
or
four
hours
.
It
took
a
*NL*
short
siesta
at
noon
,
and
boomed
once
more
toward
night
,
as
the
sun
*NL*
was
withdrawing
his
influence
.
In
the
right
stage
of
the
weather
a
pond
*NL*
fires
its
evening
gun
with
great
regularity
.
But
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
day
,
being
full
of
cracks
,
and
the
air
also
being
less
elastic
,
it
had
*NL*
completely
lost
its
resonance
,
and
probably
fishes
and
muskrats
could
*NL*
not
then
have
been
stunned
by
a
blow
on
it
.
The
fishermen
say
that
the
*NL*
``
thundering
of
the
pond
''
scares
the
fishes
and
prevents
their
biting
.
*NL*
The
pond
does
not
thunder
every
evening
,
and
I
can
not
tell
surely
when
*NL*
to
expect
its
thundering
;
but
though
I
may
perceive
no
difference
in
*NL*
the
weather
,
it
does
.
Who
would
have
suspected
so
large
and
cold
and
*NL*
thick-skinned
a
thing
to
be
so
sensitive
?
Yet
it
has
its
law
to
which
*NL*
it
thunders
obedience
when
it
should
as
surely
as
the
buds
expand
in
the
*NL*
spring
.
The
earth
is
all
alive
and
covered
with
papillae
.
The
largest
*NL*
pond
is
as
sensitive
to
atmospheric
changes
as
the
globule
of
mercury
in
*NL*
its
tube
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
attraction
in
coming
to
the
woods
to
live
was
that
I
should
have
*NL*
leisure
and
opportunity
to
see
the
Spring
come
in
.
The
ice
in
the
pond
*NL*
at
length
begins
to
be
honeycombed
,
and
I
can
set
my
heel
in
it
as
I
*NL*
walk
.
Fogs
and
rains
and
warmer
suns
are
gradually
melting
the
snow
;
the
*NL*
days
have
grown
sensibly
longer
;
and
I
see
how
I
shall
get
through
the
*NL*
winter
without
adding
to
my
wood-pile
,
for
large
fires
are
no
longer
*NL*
necessary
.
I
am
on
the
alert
for
the
first
signs
of
spring
,
to
hear
the
*NL*
chance
note
of
some
arriving
bird
,
or
the
striped
squirrel
's
chirp
,
for
*NL*
his
stores
must
be
now
nearly
exhausted
,
or
see
the
woodchuck
venture
*NL*
out
of
his
winter
quarters
.
On
the
13th
of
March
,
after
I
had
heard
the
*NL*
bluebird
,
song
sparrow
,
and
red-wing
,
the
ice
was
still
nearly
a
foot
*NL*
thick
.
As
the
weather
grew
warmer
it
was
not
sensibly
worn
away
by
the
*NL*
water
,
nor
broken
up
and
floated
off
as
in
rivers
,
but
,
though
it
was
*NL*
completely
melted
for
half
a
rod
in
width
about
the
shore
,
the
middle
*NL*
was
merely
honeycombed
and
saturated
with
water
,
so
that
you
could
put
*NL*
your
foot
through
it
when
six
inches
thick
;
but
by
the
next
day
evening
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
after
a
warm
rain
followed
by
fog
,
it
would
have
wholly
*NL*
disappeared
,
all
gone
off
with
the
fog
,
spirited
away
.
One
year
I
went
*NL*
across
the
middle
only
five
days
before
it
disappeared
entirely
.
In
1845
*NL*
Walden
was
first
completely
open
on
the
1st
of
April
;
in
'
46
,
the
25th
*NL*
of
March
;
in
'
47
,
the
8th
of
April
;
in
'
51
,
the
28th
of
March
;
in
'
52
,
*NL*
the
18th
of
April
;
in
'
53
,
the
23d
of
March
;
in
'
54
,
about
the
7th
of
*NL*
April
.

*NL*
Every
incident
connected
with
the
breaking
up
of
the
rivers
and
ponds
*NL*
and
the
settling
of
the
weather
is
particularly
interesting
to
us
who
*NL*
live
in
a
climate
of
so
great
extremes
.
When
the
warmer
days
come
,
they
*NL*
who
dwell
near
the
river
hear
the
ice
crack
at
night
with
a
startling
*NL*
whoop
as
loud
as
artillery
,
as
if
its
icy
fetters
were
rent
from
end
to
*NL*
end
,
and
within
a
few
days
see
it
rapidly
going
out
.
So
the
alligator
*NL*
comes
out
of
the
mud
with
quakings
of
the
earth
.
One
old
man
,
who
has
*NL*
been
a
close
observer
of
Nature
,
and
seems
as
thoroughly
wise
in
regard
*NL*
to
all
her
operations
as
if
she
had
been
put
upon
the
stocks
when
he
was
*NL*
a
boy
,
and
he
had
helped
to
lay
her
keel
--
who
has
come
to
his
growth
,
*NL*
and
can
hardly
acquire
more
of
natural
lore
if
he
should
live
to
the
age
*NL*
of
Methuselah
--
told
me
--
and
I
was
surprised
to
hear
him
express
wonder
*NL*
at
any
of
Nature
's
operations
,
for
I
thought
that
there
were
no
secrets
*NL*
between
them
--
that
one
spring
day
he
took
his
gun
and
boat
,
and
thought
*NL*
that
he
would
have
a
little
sport
with
the
ducks
.
There
was
ice
still
on
*NL*
the
meadows
,
but
it
was
all
gone
out
of
the
river
,
and
he
dropped
down
*NL*
without
obstruction
from
Sudbury
,
where
he
lived
,
to
Fair
Haven
Pond
,
*NL*
which
he
found
,
unexpectedly
,
covered
for
the
most
part
with
a
firm
*NL*
field
of
ice
.
It
was
a
warm
day
,
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
so
great
*NL*
a
body
of
ice
remaining
.
Not
seeing
any
ducks
,
he
hid
his
boat
on
the
*NL*
north
or
back
side
of
an
island
in
the
pond
,
and
then
concealed
himself
*NL*
in
the
bushes
on
the
south
side
,
to
await
them
.
The
ice
was
melted
for
*NL*
three
or
four
rods
from
the
shore
,
and
there
was
a
smooth
and
warm
sheet
*NL*
of
water
,
with
a
muddy
bottom
,
such
as
the
ducks
love
,
within
,
and
he
*NL*
thought
it
likely
that
some
would
be
along
pretty
soon
.
After
he
had
*NL*
lain
still
there
about
an
hour
he
heard
a
low
and
seemingly
very
distant
*NL*
sound
,
but
singularly
grand
and
impressive
,
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
*NL*
heard
,
gradually
swelling
and
increasing
as
if
it
would
have
a
universal
*NL*
and
memorable
ending
,
a
sullen
rush
and
roar
,
which
seemed
to
him
all
*NL*
at
once
like
the
sound
of
a
vast
body
of
fowl
coming
in
to
settle
there
,
*NL*
and
,
seizing
his
gun
,
he
started
up
in
haste
and
excited
;
but
he
found
,
*NL*
to
his
surprise
,
that
the
whole
body
of
the
ice
had
started
while
he
lay
*NL*
there
,
and
drifted
in
to
the
shore
,
and
the
sound
he
had
heard
was
made
*NL*
by
its
edge
grating
on
the
shore
--
at
first
gently
nibbled
and
crumbled
*NL*
off
,
but
at
length
heaving
up
and
scattering
its
wrecks
along
the
island
*NL*
to
a
considerable
height
before
it
came
to
a
standstill
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
sun
's
rays
have
attained
the
right
angle
,
and
warm
winds
*NL*
blow
up
mist
and
rain
and
melt
the
snowbanks
,
and
the
sun
,
dispersing
*NL*
the
mist
,
smiles
on
a
checkered
landscape
of
russet
and
white
smoking
*NL*
with
incense
,
through
which
the
traveller
picks
his
way
from
islet
to
*NL*
islet
,
cheered
by
the
music
of
a
thousand
tinkling
rills
and
rivulets
*NL*
whose
veins
are
filled
with
the
blood
of
winter
which
they
are
bearing
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
phenomena
gave
me
more
delight
than
to
observe
the
forms
which
*NL*
thawing
sand
and
clay
assume
in
flowing
down
the
sides
of
a
deep
cut
*NL*
on
the
railroad
through
which
I
passed
on
my
way
to
the
village
,
a
*NL*
phenomenon
not
very
common
on
so
large
a
scale
,
though
the
number
of
*NL*
freshly
exposed
banks
of
the
right
material
must
have
been
greatly
*NL*
multiplied
since
railroads
were
invented
.
The
material
was
sand
of
every
*NL*
degree
of
fineness
and
of
various
rich
colors
,
commonly
mixed
with
*NL*
a
little
clay
.
When
the
frost
comes
out
in
the
spring
,
and
even
in
a
*NL*
thawing
day
in
the
winter
,
the
sand
begins
to
flow
down
the
slopes
like
*NL*
lava
,
sometimes
bursting
out
through
the
snow
and
overflowing
it
where
*NL*
no
sand
was
to
be
seen
before
.
Innumerable
little
streams
overlap
and
*NL*
interlace
one
with
another
,
exhibiting
a
sort
of
hybrid
product
,
which
*NL*
obeys
half
way
the
law
of
currents
,
and
half
way
that
of
vegetation
.
As
*NL*
it
flows
it
takes
the
forms
of
sappy
leaves
or
vines
,
making
heaps
of
*NL*
pulpy
sprays
a
foot
or
more
in
depth
,
and
resembling
,
as
you
look
*NL*
down
on
them
,
the
laciniated
,
lobed
,
and
imbricated
thalluses
of
some
*NL*
lichens
;
or
you
are
reminded
of
coral
,
of
leopard
's
paws
or
birds
'
feet
,
*NL*
of
brains
or
lungs
or
bowels
,
and
excrements
of
all
kinds
.
It
is
a
truly
*NL*
_
grotesque
_
vegetation
,
whose
forms
and
color
we
see
imitated
in
bronze
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
architectural
foliage
more
ancient
and
typical
than
acanthus
,
*NL*
chiccory
,
ivy
,
vine
,
or
any
vegetable
leaves
;
destined
perhaps
,
under
*NL*
some
circumstances
,
to
become
a
puzzle
to
future
geologists
.
The
whole
*NL*
cut
impressed
me
as
if
it
were
a
cave
with
its
stalactites
laid
open
*NL*
to
the
light
.
The
various
shades
of
the
sand
are
singularly
rich
and
*NL*
agreeable
,
embracing
the
different
iron
colors
,
brown
,
gray
,
yellowish
,
*NL*
and
reddish
.
When
the
flowing
mass
reaches
the
drain
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
bank
it
spreads
out
flatter
into
_
strands
_
,
the
separate
streams
losing
*NL*
their
semi-cylindrical
form
and
gradually
becoming
more
flat
and
broad
,
*NL*
running
together
as
they
are
more
moist
,
till
they
form
an
almost
flat
*NL*
_
sand
_
,
still
variously
and
beautifully
shaded
,
but
in
which
you
can
trace
*NL*
the
original
forms
of
vegetation
;
till
at
length
,
in
the
water
itself
,
*NL*
they
are
converted
into
_
banks
_
,
like
those
formed
off
the
mouths
of
*NL*
rivers
,
and
the
forms
of
vegetation
are
lost
in
the
ripple
marks
on
the
*NL*
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
bank
,
which
is
from
twenty
to
forty
feet
high
,
is
sometimes
*NL*
overlaid
with
a
mass
of
this
kind
of
foliage
,
or
sandy
rupture
,
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
mile
on
one
or
both
sides
,
the
produce
of
one
spring
day
.
*NL*
What
makes
this
sand
foliage
remarkable
is
its
springing
into
existence
*NL*
thus
suddenly
.
When
I
see
on
the
one
side
the
inert
bank
--
for
the
sun
*NL*
acts
on
one
side
first
--
and
on
the
other
this
luxuriant
foliage
,
the
*NL*
creation
of
an
hour
,
I
am
affected
as
if
in
a
peculiar
sense
I
stood
in
*NL*
the
laboratory
of
the
Artist
who
made
the
world
and
me
--
had
come
to
*NL*
where
he
was
still
at
work
,
sporting
on
this
bank
,
and
with
excess
of
*NL*
energy
strewing
his
fresh
designs
about
.
I
feel
as
if
I
were
nearer
to
*NL*
the
vitals
of
the
globe
,
for
this
sandy
overflow
is
something
such
a
*NL*
foliaceous
mass
as
the
vitals
of
the
animal
body
.
You
find
thus
in
the
*NL*
very
sands
an
anticipation
of
the
vegetable
leaf
.
No
wonder
that
the
*NL*
earth
expresses
itself
outwardly
in
leaves
,
it
so
labors
with
the
idea
*NL*
inwardly
.
The
atoms
have
already
learned
this
law
,
and
are
pregnant
by
*NL*
it
.
The
overhanging
leaf
sees
here
its
prototype
.
_
Internally
_
,
whether
*NL*
in
the
globe
or
animal
body
,
it
is
a
moist
thick
_
lobe
_
,
a
word
*NL*
especially
applicable
to
the
liver
and
lungs
and
the
leaves
of
fat
*NL*
-LRB-
-LSB-
Greek
:
gehibo
-RSB-
,
_
labor
_
,
_
lapsus
_
,
to
flow
or
slip
downward
,
a
*NL*
lapsing
;
-LSB-
Greek
:
lobhos
-RSB-
,
_
globus
_
,
lobe
,
globe
;
also
lap
,
flap
,
and
*NL*
many
other
words
-RRB-
;
_
externally
_
a
dry
thin
_
leaf
_
,
even
as
the
_
f
_
and
*NL*
_
v
_
are
a
pressed
and
dried
_
b
_
.
The
radicals
of
_
lobe
_
are
_
lb
_
,
the
*NL*
soft
mass
of
the
_
b
_
-LRB-
single
lobed
,
or
B
,
double
lobed
-RRB-
,
with
the
liquid
*NL*
_
l
_
behind
it
pressing
it
forward
.
In
globe
,
_
glb
_
,
the
guttural
_
g
_
*NL*
adds
to
the
meaning
the
capacity
of
the
throat
.
The
feathers
and
wings
*NL*
of
birds
are
still
drier
and
thinner
leaves
.
Thus
,
also
,
you
pass
from
*NL*
the
lumpish
grub
in
the
earth
to
the
airy
and
fluttering
butterfly
.
The
*NL*
very
globe
continually
transcends
and
translates
itself
,
and
becomes
*NL*
winged
in
its
orbit
.
Even
ice
begins
with
delicate
crystal
leaves
,
as
if
*NL*
it
had
flowed
into
moulds
which
the
fronds
of
waterplants
have
impressed
*NL*
on
the
watery
mirror
.
The
whole
tree
itself
is
but
one
leaf
,
and
rivers
*NL*
are
still
vaster
leaves
whose
pulp
is
intervening
earth
,
and
towns
and
*NL*
cities
are
the
ova
of
insects
in
their
axils
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sun
withdraws
the
sand
ceases
to
flow
,
but
in
the
morning
the
*NL*
streams
will
start
once
more
and
branch
and
branch
again
into
a
myriad
*NL*
of
others
.
You
here
see
perchance
how
blood-vessels
are
formed
.
If
*NL*
you
look
closely
you
observe
that
first
there
pushes
forward
from
the
*NL*
thawing
mass
a
stream
of
softened
sand
with
a
drop-like
point
,
like
the
*NL*
ball
of
the
finger
,
feeling
its
way
slowly
and
blindly
downward
,
until
*NL*
at
last
with
more
heat
and
moisture
,
as
the
sun
gets
higher
,
the
most
*NL*
fluid
portion
,
in
its
effort
to
obey
the
law
to
which
the
most
inert
*NL*
also
yields
,
separates
from
the
latter
and
forms
for
itself
a
meandering
*NL*
channel
or
artery
within
that
,
in
which
is
seen
a
little
silvery
stream
*NL*
glancing
like
lightning
from
one
stage
of
pulpy
leaves
or
branches
to
*NL*
another
,
and
ever
and
anon
swallowed
up
in
the
sand
.
It
is
wonderful
how
*NL*
rapidly
yet
perfectly
the
sand
organizes
itself
as
it
flows
,
using
the
*NL*
best
material
its
mass
affords
to
form
the
sharp
edges
of
its
channel
.
*NL*
Such
are
the
sources
of
rivers
.
In
the
silicious
matter
which
the
water
*NL*
deposits
is
perhaps
the
bony
system
,
and
in
the
still
finer
soil
and
*NL*
organic
matter
the
fleshy
fibre
or
cellular
tissue
.
What
is
man
but
*NL*
a
mass
of
thawing
clay
?
The
ball
of
the
human
finger
is
but
a
drop
*NL*
congealed
.
The
fingers
and
toes
flow
to
their
extent
from
the
thawing
*NL*
mass
of
the
body
.
Who
knows
what
the
human
body
would
expand
and
flow
*NL*
out
to
under
a
more
genial
heaven
?
Is
not
the
hand
a
spreading
_
palm
_
*NL*
leaf
with
its
lobes
and
veins
?
The
ear
may
be
regarded
,
fancifully
,
as
a
*NL*
lichen
,
_
Umbilicaria
_
,
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
with
its
lobe
or
drop
.
*NL*
The
lip
--
_
labium
_
,
from
_
labor
_
-LRB-
?
-RRB-
--
laps
or
lapses
from
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
cavernous
mouth
.
The
nose
is
a
manifest
congealed
drop
or
stalactite
.
*NL*
The
chin
is
a
still
larger
drop
,
the
confluent
dripping
of
the
face
.
The
*NL*
cheeks
are
a
slide
from
the
brows
into
the
valley
of
the
face
,
opposed
*NL*
and
diffused
by
the
cheek
bones
.
Each
rounded
lobe
of
the
vegetable
*NL*
leaf
,
too
,
is
a
thick
and
now
loitering
drop
,
larger
or
smaller
;
the
*NL*
lobes
are
the
fingers
of
the
leaf
;
and
as
many
lobes
as
it
has
,
in
*NL*
so
many
directions
it
tends
to
flow
,
and
more
heat
or
other
genial
*NL*
influences
would
have
caused
it
to
flow
yet
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
seemed
that
this
one
hillside
illustrated
the
principle
of
all
*NL*
the
operations
of
Nature
.
The
Maker
of
this
earth
but
patented
a
leaf
.
*NL*
What
Champollion
will
decipher
this
hieroglyphic
for
us
,
that
we
may
*NL*
turn
over
a
new
leaf
at
last
?
This
phenomenon
is
more
exhilarating
to
*NL*
me
than
the
luxuriance
and
fertility
of
vineyards
.
True
,
it
is
somewhat
*NL*
excrementitious
in
its
character
,
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
heaps
*NL*
of
liver
,
lights
,
and
bowels
,
as
if
the
globe
were
turned
wrong
side
*NL*
outward
;
but
this
suggests
at
least
that
Nature
has
some
bowels
,
and
*NL*
there
again
is
mother
of
humanity
.
This
is
the
frost
coming
out
of
the
*NL*
ground
;
this
is
Spring
.
It
precedes
the
green
and
flowery
spring
,
as
*NL*
mythology
precedes
regular
poetry
.
I
know
of
nothing
more
purgative
of
*NL*
winter
fumes
and
indigestions
.
It
convinces
me
that
Earth
is
still
in
*NL*
her
swaddling-clothes
,
and
stretches
forth
baby
fingers
on
every
side
.
*NL*
Fresh
curls
spring
from
the
baldest
brow
.
There
is
nothing
inorganic
.
*NL*
These
foliaceous
heaps
lie
along
the
bank
like
the
slag
of
a
furnace
,
*NL*
showing
that
Nature
is
``
in
full
blast
''
within
.
The
earth
is
not
a
mere
*NL*
fragment
of
dead
history
,
stratum
upon
stratum
like
the
leaves
of
a
*NL*
book
,
to
be
studied
by
geologists
and
antiquaries
chiefly
,
but
living
*NL*
poetry
like
the
leaves
of
a
tree
,
which
precede
flowers
and
fruit
--
not
a
*NL*
fossil
earth
,
but
a
living
earth
;
compared
with
whose
great
central
life
*NL*
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
is
merely
parasitic
.
Its
throes
will
heave
*NL*
our
exuviae
from
their
graves
.
You
may
melt
your
metals
and
cast
them
*NL*
into
the
most
beautiful
moulds
you
can
;
they
will
never
excite
me
like
*NL*
the
forms
which
this
molten
earth
flows
out
into
.
And
not
only
it
,
*NL*
but
the
institutions
upon
it
are
plastic
like
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
potter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
long
,
not
only
on
these
banks
,
but
on
every
hill
and
plain
and
in
*NL*
every
hollow
,
the
frost
comes
out
of
the
ground
like
a
dormant
quadruped
*NL*
from
its
burrow
,
and
seeks
the
sea
with
music
,
or
migrates
to
other
*NL*
climes
in
clouds
.
Thaw
with
his
gentle
persuasion
is
more
powerful
than
*NL*
Thor
with
his
hammer
.
The
one
melts
,
the
other
but
breaks
in
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ground
was
partially
bare
of
snow
,
and
a
few
warm
days
had
*NL*
dried
its
surface
somewhat
,
it
was
pleasant
to
compare
the
first
tender
*NL*
signs
of
the
infant
year
just
peeping
forth
with
the
stately
*NL*
beauty
of
the
withered
vegetation
which
had
withstood
the
*NL*
winter
--
life-everlasting
,
goldenrods
,
pinweeds
,
and
graceful
wild
*NL*
grasses
,
more
obvious
and
interesting
frequently
than
in
summer
even
,
*NL*
as
if
their
beauty
was
not
ripe
till
then
;
even
cotton-grass
,
cat-tails
,
*NL*
mulleins
,
johnswort
,
hard-hack
,
meadow-sweet
,
and
other
strong-stemmed
*NL*
plants
,
those
unexhausted
granaries
which
entertain
the
earliest
*NL*
birds
--
decent
weeds
,
at
least
,
which
widowed
Nature
wears
.
I
am
*NL*
particularly
attracted
by
the
arching
and
sheaf-like
top
of
the
*NL*
wool-grass
;
it
brings
back
the
summer
to
our
winter
memories
,
and
is
*NL*
among
the
forms
which
art
loves
to
copy
,
and
which
,
in
the
vegetable
*NL*
kingdom
,
have
the
same
relation
to
types
already
in
the
mind
of
man
that
*NL*
astronomy
has
.
It
is
an
antique
style
,
older
than
Greek
or
Egyptian
.
*NL*
Many
of
the
phenomena
of
Winter
are
suggestive
of
an
inexpressible
*NL*
tenderness
and
fragile
delicacy
.
We
are
accustomed
to
hear
this
king
*NL*
described
as
a
rude
and
boisterous
tyrant
;
but
with
the
gentleness
of
a
*NL*
lover
he
adorns
the
tresses
of
Summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
approach
of
spring
the
red
squirrels
got
under
my
house
,
two
at
*NL*
a
time
,
directly
under
my
feet
as
I
sat
reading
or
writing
,
and
kept
up
*NL*
the
queerest
chuckling
and
chirruping
and
vocal
pirouetting
and
gurgling
*NL*
sounds
that
ever
were
heard
;
and
when
I
stamped
they
only
chirruped
the
*NL*
louder
,
as
if
past
all
fear
and
respect
in
their
mad
pranks
,
defying
*NL*
humanity
to
stop
them
.
No
,
you
do
n't
--
chickaree
--
chickaree
.
They
were
*NL*
wholly
deaf
to
my
arguments
,
or
failed
to
perceive
their
force
,
and
fell
*NL*
into
a
strain
of
invective
that
was
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
sparrow
of
spring
!
The
year
beginning
with
younger
hope
than
*NL*
ever
!
The
faint
silvery
warblings
heard
over
the
partially
bare
and
*NL*
moist
fields
from
the
bluebird
,
the
song
sparrow
,
and
the
red-wing
,
as
*NL*
if
the
last
flakes
of
winter
tinkled
as
they
fell
!
What
at
such
a
time
*NL*
are
histories
,
chronologies
,
traditions
,
and
all
written
revelations
?
*NL*
The
brooks
sing
carols
and
glees
to
the
spring
.
The
marsh
hawk
,
sailing
*NL*
low
over
the
meadow
,
is
already
seeking
the
first
slimy
life
that
*NL*
awakes
.
The
sinking
sound
of
melting
snow
is
heard
in
all
dells
,
and
the
*NL*
ice
dissolves
apace
in
the
ponds
.
The
grass
flames
up
on
the
hillsides
*NL*
like
a
spring
fire
--
``
et
primitus
oritur
herba
imbribus
primoribus
*NL*
evocata
''
--
as
if
the
earth
sent
forth
an
inward
heat
to
greet
the
*NL*
returning
sun
;
not
yellow
but
green
is
the
color
of
its
flame
;
--
the
*NL*
symbol
of
perpetual
youth
,
the
grass-blade
,
like
a
long
green
ribbon
,
*NL*
streams
from
the
sod
into
the
summer
,
checked
indeed
by
the
frost
,
but
*NL*
anon
pushing
on
again
,
lifting
its
spear
of
last
year
's
hay
with
the
*NL*
fresh
life
below
.
It
grows
as
steadily
as
the
rill
oozes
out
of
the
*NL*
ground
.
It
is
almost
identical
with
that
,
for
in
the
growing
days
of
*NL*
June
,
when
the
rills
are
dry
,
the
grass-blades
are
their
channels
,
and
*NL*
from
year
to
year
the
herds
drink
at
this
perennial
green
stream
,
and
*NL*
the
mower
draws
from
it
betimes
their
winter
supply
.
So
our
human
life
*NL*
but
dies
down
to
its
root
,
and
still
puts
forth
its
green
blade
to
*NL*
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walden
is
melting
apace
.
There
is
a
canal
two
rods
wide
along
the
*NL*
northerly
and
westerly
sides
,
and
wider
still
at
the
east
end
.
A
great
*NL*
field
of
ice
has
cracked
off
from
the
main
body
.
I
hear
a
song
sparrow
*NL*
singing
from
the
bushes
on
the
shore
,
--
_
olit
_
,
_
olit
_
,
_
olit
,
_
--
_
chip
_
,
*NL*
_

_
,
_

_
,
_
che
char
_
,
--
_
che
wiss
_
,
_
wiss
_
,
_
wiss
_
.
He
too
is
*NL*
helping
to
crack
it
.
How
handsome
the
great
sweeping
curves
in
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
ice
,
answering
somewhat
to
those
of
the
shore
,
but
more
regular
!
*NL*
It
is
unusually
hard
,
owing
to
the
recent
severe
but
transient
cold
,
and
*NL*
all
watered
or
waved
like
a
palace
floor
.
But
the
wind
slides
eastward
*NL*
over
its
opaque
surface
in
vain
,
till
it
reaches
the
living
surface
*NL*
beyond
.
It
is
glorious
to
behold
this
ribbon
of
water
sparkling
in
the
*NL*
sun
,
the
bare
face
of
the
pond
full
of
glee
and
youth
,
as
if
it
spoke
*NL*
the
joy
of
the
fishes
within
it
,
and
of
the
sands
on
its
shore
--
a
*NL*
silvery
sheen
as
from
the
scales
of
a
leuciscus
,
as
it
were
all
one
*NL*
active
fish
.
Such
is
the
contrast
between
winter
and
spring
.
Walden
was
*NL*
dead
and
is
alive
again
.
But
this
spring
it
broke
up
more
steadily
,
as
I
*NL*
have
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
from
storm
and
winter
to
serene
and
mild
weather
,
from
dark
*NL*
and
sluggish
hours
to
bright
and
elastic
ones
,
is
a
memorable
crisis
*NL*
which
all
things
proclaim
.
It
is
seemingly
instantaneous
at
last
.
*NL*
Suddenly
an
influx
of
light
filled
my
house
,
though
the
evening
was
at
*NL*
hand
,
and
the
clouds
of
winter
still
overhung
it
,
and
the
eaves
were
*NL*
dripping
with
sleety
rain
.
I
looked
out
the
window
,
and
lo
!
where
*NL*
yesterday
was
cold
gray
ice
there
lay
the
transparent
pond
already
calm
*NL*
and
full
of
hope
as
in
a
summer
evening
,
reflecting
a
summer
evening
*NL*
sky
in
its
bosom
,
though
none
was
visible
overhead
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
intelligence
with
some
remote
horizon
.
I
heard
a
robin
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
the
first
I
had
heard
for
many
a
thousand
years
,
methought
,
whose
note
*NL*
I
shall
not
forget
for
many
a
thousand
more
--
the
same
sweet
and
powerful
*NL*
song
as
of
yore
.
O
the
evening
robin
,
at
the
end
of
a
New
England
summer
*NL*
day
!
If
I
could
ever
find
the
twig
he
sits
upon
!
I
mean
_
he
_
;
I
mean
the
*NL*
_
twig
_
.
This
at
least
is
not
the
_
Turdus
migratorius
_
.
The
pitch
pines
and
*NL*
shrub
oaks
about
my
house
,
which
had
so
long
drooped
,
suddenly
resumed
*NL*
their
several
characters
,
looked
brighter
,
greener
,
and
more
erect
and
*NL*
alive
,
as
if
effectually
cleansed
and
restored
by
the
rain
.
I
knew
that
*NL*
it
would
not
rain
any
more
.
You
may
tell
by
looking
at
any
twig
of
the
*NL*
forest
,
ay
,
at
your
very
wood-pile
,
whether
its
winter
is
past
or
not
.
*NL*
As
it
grew
darker
,
I
was
startled
by
the
honking
of
geese
flying
low
*NL*
over
the
woods
,
like
weary
travellers
getting
in
late
from
Southern
*NL*
lakes
,
and
indulging
at
last
in
unrestrained
complaint
and
mutual
*NL*
consolation
.
Standing
at
my
door
,
I
could
hear
the
rush
of
their
wings
;
*NL*
when
,
driving
toward
my
house
,
they
suddenly
spied
my
light
,
and
with
*NL*
hushed
clamor
wheeled
and
settled
in
the
pond
.
So
I
came
in
,
and
shut
*NL*
the
door
,
and
passed
my
first
spring
night
in
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
I
watched
the
geese
from
the
door
through
the
mist
,
*NL*
sailing
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
,
fifty
rods
off
,
so
large
and
*NL*
tumultuous
that
Walden
appeared
like
an
artificial
pond
for
their
*NL*
amusement
.
But
when
I
stood
on
the
shore
they
at
once
rose
up
with
a
*NL*
great
flapping
of
wings
at
the
signal
of
their
commander
,
and
when
they
*NL*
had
got
into
rank
circled
about
over
my
head
,
twenty-nine
of
them
,
and
*NL*
then
steered
straight
to
Canada
,
with
a
regular
_
honk
_
from
the
leader
at
*NL*
intervals
,
trusting
to
break
their
fast
in
muddier
pools
.
A
``
plump
''
of
*NL*
ducks
rose
at
the
same
time
and
took
the
route
to
the
north
in
the
wake
*NL*
of
their
noisier
cousins
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
I
heard
the
circling
,
groping
clangor
of
some
solitary
goose
*NL*
in
the
foggy
mornings
,
seeking
its
companion
,
and
still
peopling
the
*NL*
woods
with
the
sound
of
a
larger
life
than
they
could
sustain
.
In
April
*NL*
the
pigeons
were
seen
again
flying
express
in
small
flocks
,
and
in
due
*NL*
time
I
heard
the
martins
twittering
over
my
clearing
,
though
it
had
not
*NL*
seemed
that
the
township
contained
so
many
that
it
could
afford
me
any
,
*NL*
and
I
fancied
that
they
were
peculiarly
of
the
ancient
race
that
dwelt
*NL*
in
hollow
trees
ere
white
men
came
.
In
almost
all
climes
the
tortoise
*NL*
and
the
frog
are
among
the
precursors
and
heralds
of
this
season
,
and
*NL*
birds
fly
with
song
and
glancing
plumage
,
and
plants
spring
and
bloom
,
*NL*
and
winds
blow
,
to
correct
this
slight
oscillation
of
the
poles
and
*NL*
preserve
the
equilibrium
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
every
season
seems
best
to
us
in
its
turn
,
so
the
coming
in
of
spring
*NL*
is
like
the
creation
of
Cosmos
out
of
Chaos
and
the
realization
of
the
*NL*
Golden
Age
.

We
should

took
advantage
of
every

which
confesses
the

of

dew
that
falls

and
did
not
spend
our
time
in
*NL*
atoning
for
the
neglect
of
past
opportunities
,
which
we
call
doing
our
*NL*
duty

We
loiter
in
winter
while
it
is
already
spring
.
In
a
pleasant
*NL*
spring
morning
all
men
's
sins
are
forgiven
.
Such
a
day
is
a
truce
to
*NL*
vice
.
While
such
a
sun
holds
out
to
burn
,
the
vilest
sinner
may
return
.
*NL*
Through
our
own
recovered
innocence
we
discern
the
innocence
of
our
*NL*
neighbors
.
You
may
have
known
your
neighbor
yesterday
for
a
thief
,
*NL*
a
drunkard
,
or
a
sensualist
,
and
merely
pitied
or
despised
him
,
and
*NL*
despaired
of
the
world
;
but
the
sun
shines
bright
and
warm
this
first
*NL*
spring
morning
,
recreating
the
world
,
and
you
meet
him
at
some
serene
*NL*
work
,
and
see
how
it
is
exhausted
and
debauched
veins
expand
with
still
*NL*
joy
and
bless
the
new
day
,
feel
the
spring
influence
with
the
innocence
*NL*
of
infancy
,
and
all
his
faults
are
forgotten
.
There
is
not
only
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
good
will
about
him
,
but
even
a
savor
of
holiness
groping
*NL*
for
expression
,
blindly
and
ineffectually
perhaps
,
like
a
new-born
*NL*
instinct
,
and
for
a
short
hour
the
south
hill-side
echoes
to
no
vulgar
*NL*
jest
.
You
see
some
innocent
fair
shoots
preparing
to
burst
from
his
*NL*
gnarled
rind
and
try
another
year
's
life
,
tender
and
fresh
as
the
*NL*
youngest
plant
.
Even
he
has
entered
into
the
joy
of
his
Lord
.
Why
the
*NL*
jailer
does
not
leave
open
his
prison
doors
--
why
the
judge
does
not
*NL*
dismis
his

--
why
the
preacher
does
not
dismiss
his

!
It
*NL*
is
because
they
do
not
obey
the
hint
which
God
gives
them
,
nor
accept
*NL*
the
pardon
which
he
freely
offers
to
all

``
A

seeing

think
that
he

On
the
29th
of
April
,
as
I
was
fishing
from
the
bank
of
the
river
near
*NL*
the
Nine-Acre-Corner
bridge
,
standing
on
the
quaking
grass
and
willow
*NL*
roots
,
where
the
muskrats
lurk
,
I
heard
a
singular
rattling
sound
,
*NL*
somewhat
like
that
of
the
sticks
which
boys
play
with
their
fingers
,
*NL*
when
,
looking
up
,
I
observed
a
very
slight
and
graceful
hawk
,
like
a
*NL*
nighthawk
,
alternately
soaring
like
a
ripple
and
tumbling
a
rod
or
two
*NL*
over
and
over
,
showing
the
under
side
of
its
wings
,
which
gleamed
like
*NL*
a
satin
ribbon
in
the
sun
,
or
like
the
pearly
inside
of
a
shell
.
*NL*
This
sight
reminded
me
of
falconry
and
what
nobleness
and
poetry
are
*NL*
associated
with
that
sport
.
The
Merlin
it
seemed
to
me
it
might
be
*NL*
called
:
but
I
care
not
for
its
name
.
It
was
the
most
ethereal
flight
I
*NL*
had
ever
witnessed
.
It
did
not
simply
flutter
like
a
butterfly
,
nor
soar
*NL*
like
the
larger
hawks
,
but
it
sported
with
proud
reliance
in
the
fields
*NL*
of
air
;
mounting
again
and
again
with
its
strange
chuckle
,
it
repeated
*NL*
its
free
and
beautiful
fall
,
turning
over
and
over
like
a
kite
,
and
then
*NL*
recovering
from
its
lofty
tumbling
,
as
if
it
had
never
set
its
foot
on
*NL*
_
terra
firma
_
.
It
appeared
to
have
no
companion
in
the
universe
--
sporting
*NL*
there
alone
--
and
to
need
none
but
the
morning
and
the
ether
with
which
*NL*
it
played
.
It
was
not
lonely
,
but
made
all
the
earth
lonely
beneath
it
.
*NL*
Where
was
the
parent
which
hatched
it
,
its
kindred
,
and
its
father
in
*NL*
the
heavens
?
The
tenant
of
the
air
,
it
seemed
related
to
the
earth
but
*NL*
by
an
egg
hatched
some
time
in
the
crevice
of
a
crag
;
--
or
was
its
native
*NL*
nest
made
in
the
angle
of
a
cloud
,
woven
of
the
rainbow
's
trimmings
and
*NL*
the
sunset
sky
,
and
lined
with
some
soft
midsummer
haze
caught
up
from
*NL*
earth
?
Its
eyry
now
some
cliffy
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
this
I
got
a
rare
mess
of
golden
and
silver
and
bright
cupreous
*NL*
fishes
,
which
looked
like
a
string
of
jewels
.
Ah
!
I
have
penetrated
to
*NL*
those
meadows
on
the
morning
of
many
a
first
spring
day
,
jumping
from
*NL*
hummock
to
hummock
,
from
willow
root
to
willow
root
,
when
the
wild
river
*NL*
valley
and
the
woods
were
bathed
in
so
pure
and
bright
a
light
as
would
*NL*
have
waked
the
dead
,
if
they
had
been
slumbering
in
their
graves
,
as
*NL*
some
suppose
.
There
needs
no
stronger
proof
of
immortality
.
All
things
*NL*
must
live
in
such
a
light
.
O
Death
,
where
was
thy
sting
?
O
Grave
,
where
*NL*
was
thy
victory
,
then
?
*NL*
*NL*
Our
village
life
would
stagnate
if
it
were
not
for
the
unexplored
*NL*
forests
and
meadows
which
surround
it
.
We
need
the
tonic
of
wildness
--
to
*NL*
wade
sometimes
in
marshes
where
the
bittern
and
the
meadow-hen
lurk
,
and
*NL*
hear
the
booming
of
the
snipe
;
to
smell
the
whispering
sedge
where
only
*NL*
some
wilder
and
more
solitary
fowl
builds
her
nest
,
and
the
mink
crawls
*NL*
with
its
belly
close
to
the
ground
.
At
the
same
time
that
we
are
*NL*
earnest
to
explore
and
learn
all
things
,
we
require
that
all
things
*NL*
be
mysterious
and
unexplorable
,
that
land
and
sea
be
infinitely
wild
,
*NL*
unsurveyed
and
unfathomed
by
us
because
unfathomable
.
We
can
never
have
*NL*
enough
of
nature
.
We
must
be
refreshed
by
the
sight
of
inexhaustible
*NL*
vigor
,
vast
and
titanic
features
,
the
sea-coast
with
its
wrecks
,
the
*NL*
wilderness
with
its
living
and
its
decaying
trees
,
the
thunder-cloud
,
*NL*
and
the
rain
which
lasts
three
weeks
and
produces
freshets
.
We
need
*NL*
to
witness
our
own
limits
transgressed
,
and
some
life
pasturing
freely
*NL*
where
we
never
wander
.
We
are
cheered
when
we
observe
the
vulture
*NL*
feeding
on
the
carrion
which
disgusts
and
disheartens
us
,
and
deriving
*NL*
health
and
strength
from
the
repast
.
There
was
a
dead
horse
in
the
*NL*
hollow
by
the
path
to
my
house
,
which
compelled
me
sometimes
to
go
*NL*
out
of
my
way
,
especially
in
the
night
when
the
air
was
heavy
,
but
the
*NL*
assurance
it
gave
me
of
the
strong
appetite
and
inviolable
health
of
*NL*
Nature
was
my
compensation
for
this
.
I
love
to
see
that
Nature
is
*NL*
so
rife
with
life
that
myriads
can
be
afforded
to
be
sacrificed
and
*NL*
suffered
to
prey
on
one
another
;
that
tender
organizations
can
be
so
*NL*
serenely
squashed
out
of
existence
like
pulp
--
tadpoles
which
herons
*NL*
gobble
up
,
and
tortoises
and
toads
run
over
in
the
road
;
and
that
*NL*
sometimes
it
has
rained
flesh
and
blood
!
With
the
liability
to
accident
,
*NL*
we
must
see
how
little
account
is
to
be
made
of
it
.
The
impression
made
*NL*
on
a
wise
man
is
that
of
universal
innocence
.
Poison
is
not
poisonous
*NL*
after
all
,
nor
are
any
wounds
fatal
.
Compassion
is
a
very
untenable
*NL*
ground
.
It
must
be
expeditious
.
Its
pleadings
will
not
bear
to
be
*NL*
stereotyped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
May
,
the
oaks
,
hickories
,
maples
,
and
other
trees
,
just
putting
*NL*
out
amidst
the
pine
woods
around
the
pond
,
imparted
a
brightness
like
*NL*
sunshine
to
the
landscape
,
especially
in
cloudy
days
,
as
if
the
sun
were
*NL*
breaking
through
mists
and
shining
faintly
on
the
hillsides
here
and
*NL*
there
.
On
the
third
or
fourth
of
May
I
saw
a
loon
in
the
pond
,
and
*NL*
during
the
first
week
of
the
month
I
heard
the
whip-poor-will
,
the
brown
*NL*
thrasher
,
the
veery
,
the
wood
pewee
,
the
chewink
,
and
other
birds
.
I
had
*NL*
heard
the
wood
thrush
long
before
.
The
phoebe
had
already
come
once
more
*NL*
and
looked
in
at
my
door
and
window
,
to
see
if
my
house
was
cavern-like
*NL*
enough
for
her
,
sustaining
herself
on
humming
wings
with
clinched
*NL*
talons
,
as
if
she
held
by
the
air
,
while
she
surveyed
the
premises
.
*NL*
The
sulphur-like
pollen
of
the
pitch
pine
soon
covered
the
pond
and
the
*NL*
stones
and
rotten
wood
along
the
shore
,
so
that
you
could
have
collected
*NL*
a
barrelful
.
This
is
the
``
sulphur
showers
''
we
hear
of
.
Even
in
Calidas
'
*NL*
drama
of
Sacontala
,
we
read
of
``
rills
dyed
yellow
with
the
golden
dust
*NL*
of
the
lotus
.
''
And
so
the
seasons
went
rolling
on
into
summer
,
as
one
*NL*
rambles
into
higher
and
higher
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
my
first
year
's
life
in
the
woods
completed
;
and
the
second
*NL*
year
was
similar
to
it
.
I
finally
left
Walden
September
6th
,
1847
.

Conclusion
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
sick
the
doctors
wisely
recommend
a
change
of
air
and
scenery
.
*NL*
Thank
Heaven
,
here
is
not
all
the
world
.
The
buckeye
does
not
grow
in
*NL*
New
England
,
and
the
mockingbird
is
rarely
heard
here
.
The
wild
goose
*NL*
is
more
of
a
cosmopolite
than
we
;
he
breaks
his
fast
in
Canada
,
takes
*NL*
a
luncheon
in
the
Ohio
,
and
plumes
himself
for
the
night
in
a
southern
*NL*
bayou
.
Even
the
bison
,
to
some
extent
,
keeps
pace
with
the
seasons
*NL*
cropping
the
pastures
of
the
Colorado
only
till
a
greener
and
sweeter
*NL*
grass
awaits
him
by
the
Yellowstone
.
Yet
we
think
that
if
rail
fences
*NL*
are
pulled
down
,
and
stone
walls
piled
up
on
our
farms
,
bounds
are
*NL*
henceforth
set
to
our
lives
and
our
fates
decided
.
If
you
are
chosen
*NL*
town
clerk
,
forsooth
,
you
can
not
go
to
Tierra
del
Fuego
this
summer
:
but
*NL*
you
may
go
to
the
land
of
infernal
fire
nevertheless
.
The
universe
is
*NL*
wider
than
our
views
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
we
should
oftener
look
over
the
tafferel
of
our
craft
,
like
curious
*NL*
passengers
,
and
not
make
the
voyage
like
stupid
sailors
picking
oakum
.
*NL*
The
other
side
of
the
globe
is
but
the
home
of
our
correspondent
.
Our
*NL*
voyaging
is
only
great-circle
sailing
,
and
the
doctors
prescribe
for
*NL*
diseases
of
the
skin
merely
.
One
hastens
to
southern
Africa
to
chase
the
*NL*
giraffe
;
but
surely
that
is
not
the
game
he
would
be
after
.
How
long
,
*NL*
pray
,
would
a
man
hunt
giraffes
if
he
could
?
Snipes
and
woodcocks
also
*NL*
may
afford
rare
sport
;
but
I
trust
it
would
be
nobler
game
to
shoot
*NL*
one
's
self
.

What

Africa

what
does
the

stand
for

Is
not
our

white
on

black

Is
it
the

Mississippi

or
a
Northwest
Passage
around

we
would

find

Are
these
the

which
most
concern
mankind

Is
Franklin
the

only
man
who

that
his

should
be

*NL*
Does
Mr.

rather
the
Mungo

,
*NL*
the
Lewis

Clark
and
Frobisher
,
of
your
own
streams

;
*NL*
explore
your
own
higher
latitudes
--
with
shiploads
of
preserved
meats
to
*NL*
support
you
,
if
they
be
necessary
;
and
pile
the
empty
cans
sky-high
for
*NL*
a

Were
preserved
meats
invented
to
preserve
meat
merely
?
Nay
,
be
*NL*
a
Columbus
to
whole
new
continents
and
worlds
within
you
,
opening
new
*NL*
channels
,
not
of
trade
,
but
of
thought
.
Every
man
is
the
lord
of
a
realm
*NL*
beside
which
the
earthly
empire
of
the
Czar
is
but
a
petty
state
,
*NL*
a
hummock
left
by
the
ice
.
Yet
some
can
be
patriotic
who
have
no
*NL*
self-respect
,
and
sacrifice
the
greater
to
the
less
.
They
love
the
soil
*NL*
which
makes
their
graves
,
but
have
no
sympathy
with
the
spirit
which
may
*NL*
still
animate
their
clay
.
Patriotism
is
a
maggot
in
their
heads
.
What
*NL*
was
the
meaning
of
that
South-Sea
Exploring
Expedition
,
with
all
its

but
an
indirect
recognition
of
the
fact
that
there
*NL*
are
continents

seas
in
the
moral
world
to
which
every
man
is
an
*NL*
isthmus

an
inlet

yet
unexplored
by

but
that
it
is
easier
to
*NL*

many

conduct

It
is
said
that
Mirabeau
took
to
highway
robbery
``
to
ascertain
what
*NL*
degree
of
resolution
was
necessary
in
order
to
place
one
's
self
in
*NL*
formal
opposition
to
the
most
sacred
laws
of
society
.
''
He
declared
that
*NL*
``
a
soldier
who
fights
in
the
ranks
does
not
require
half
so
much
courage
*NL*
as
a
footpad
''
--
``
that
honor
and
religion
have
never
stood
in
the
way
of
a
*NL*
well-considered
and
a
firm
resolve
.
''
This
was
manly
,
as
the
world
goes
;
*NL*
and
yet
it
was
idle
,
if
not
desperate
.
A
saner
man
would
have
found
*NL*
himself
often
enough
``
in
formal
opposition
''
to
what
are
deemed
``
the
most
*NL*
sacred
laws
of
society
,
''
through
obedience
to
yet
more
sacred
laws
,
and
*NL*
so
have
tested
his
resolution
without
going
out
of
his
way
.
It
is
not
*NL*
for
a
man
to
put
himself
in
such
an
attitude
to
society
,
but
to
maintain
*NL*
himself
in
whatever
attitude
he
find
himself
through
obedience
to
the
*NL*
laws
of
his
being
,
which
will
never
be
one
of
opposition
to
a
just
*NL*
government
,
if
he
should
chance
to
meet
with
such
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
the
woods
for
as
good
a
reason
as
I
went
there
.
Perhaps
it
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
I
had
several
more
lives
to
live
,
and
could
not
spare
any
*NL*
more
time
for
that
one
.
It
is
remarkable
how
easily
and
insensibly
we
*NL*
fall
into
a
particular
route
,
and
make
a
beaten
track
for
ourselves
.
I
*NL*
had
not
lived
there
a
week
before
my
feet
wore
a
path
from
my
door
to
*NL*
the
pond-side
;
and
though
it
is
five
or
six
years
since
I
trod
it
,
it
*NL*
is
still
quite
distinct
.
It
is
true
,
I
fear
,
that
others
may
have
fallen
*NL*
into
it
,
and
so
helped
to
keep
it
open
.
The
surface
of
the
earth
is
soft
*NL*
and
impressible
by
the
feet
of
men
;
and
so
with
the
paths
which
the
mind
*NL*
travels
.
How
worn
and
dusty
,
then
,
must
be
the
highways
of
the
world
,
*NL*
how
deep
the
ruts
of
tradition
and
conformity
!
I
did
not
wish
to
take
a
*NL*
cabin
passage
,
but
rather
to
go
before
the
mast
and
on
the
deck
of
the
*NL*
world
,
for
there
I
could
best
see
the
moonlight
amid
the
mountains
.
I
do
*NL*
not
wish
to
go
below
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
learned
this
,
at
least
,
by
my
experiment
:
that
if
one
advances
*NL*
confidently
in
the
direction
of
his
dreams
,
and
endeavors
to
live
the
*NL*
life
which
he
has
imagined
,
he
will
meet
with
a
success
unexpected
in
*NL*
common
hours
.
He
will
put
some
things
behind
,
will
pass
an
invisible
*NL*
boundary
;
new
,
universal
,
and
more
liberal
laws
will
begin
to
establish
*NL*
themselves
around
and
within
him
;
or
the
old
laws
be
expanded
,
and
*NL*
interpreted
in
his
favor
in
a
more
liberal
sense
,
and
he
will
live
with
*NL*
the
license
of
a
higher
order
of
beings
.
In
proportion
as
he
simplifies
*NL*
his
life
,
the
laws
of
the
universe
will
appear
less
complex
,
and
*NL*
solitude
will
not
be
solitude
,
nor
poverty
poverty
,
nor
weakness
*NL*
weakness
.
If
you
have
built
castles
in
the
air
,
your
work
need
not
be
*NL*
lost
;
that
is
where
they
should
be
.
Now
put
the
foundations
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
ridiculous
demand
which
England
and
America
make
,
that
you
shall
*NL*
speak
so
that
they
can
understand
you
.
Neither
men
nor
toadstools
grow
*NL*
so
.
As
if
that
were
important
,
and
there
were
not
enough
to
understand
*NL*
you
without
them
.
As
if
Nature
could
support
but
one
order
of
*NL*
understandings
,
could
not
sustain
birds
as
well
as
quadrupeds
,
flying
as
*NL*
well
as
creeping
things
,
and
_
hush
_
and
_
whoa
_
,
which
Bright
can
*NL*
understand
,
were
the
best
English
.
As
if
there
were
safety
in
stupidity
*NL*
alone
.
I
fear
chiefly
lest
my
expression
may
not
be
_
extra-vagant
_
*NL*
enough
,
may
not
wander
far
enough
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
my
daily
*NL*
experience
,
so
as
to
be
adequate
to
the
truth
of
which
I
have
been
*NL*
convinced
.
_
Extra
vagance
!
_
it
depends
on
how
you
are
yarded
.
The
*NL*
migrating
buffalo
,
which
seeks
new
pastures
in
another
latitude
,
is
not
*NL*
extravagant
like
the
cow
which
kicks
over
the
pail
,
leaps
the
cowyard
*NL*
fence
,
and
runs
after
her
calf
,
in
milking
time
.
I
desire
to
speak
*NL*
somewhere
_
without
_
bounds
;
like
a
man
in
a
waking
moment
,
to
men
in
*NL*
their
waking
moments
;
for
I
am
convinced
that
I
can
not
exaggerate
enough
*NL*
even
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
true
expression
.
Who
that
has
heard
a
*NL*
strain
of
music
feared
then
lest
he
should
speak
extravagantly
any
more
*NL*
forever
?
In
view
of
the
future
or
possible
,
we
should
live
quite
laxly
*NL*
and
undefined
in
front
,
our
outlines
dim
and
misty
on
that
side
;
as
our
*NL*
shadows
reveal
an
insensible
perspiration
toward
the
sun
.
The
volatile
*NL*
truth
of
our
words
should
continually
betray
the
inadequacy
of
the
*NL*
residual
statement
.
Their
truth
is
instantly
_
translated
_
;
its
literal
*NL*
monument
alone
remains
.
The
words
which
express
our
faith
and
piety
are
*NL*
not
definite
;
yet
they
are
significant
and
fragrant
like
frankincense
to
*NL*
superior
natures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
level
downward
to
our
dullest
perception
always
,
and
praise
that
as
*NL*
common
sense
?
The
commonest
sense
is
the
sense
of
men
asleep
,
which
they
*NL*
express
by
snoring
.
Sometimes
we
are
inclined
to
class
those
who
are
*NL*
once-and-a-half-witted
with
the
half-witted
,
because
we
appreciate
only
*NL*
a
third
part
of
their
wit
.
Some
would
find
fault
with
the
morning
red
,
*NL*
if
they
ever
got
up
early
enough
.
``
They
pretend
,
''
as
I
hear
,
``
that
the
*NL*
verses
of
Kabir
have
four
different
senses
;
illusion
,
spirit
,
intellect
,
*NL*
and
the
exoteric
doctrine
of
the
Vedas
''
;
but
in
this
part
of
the
world
*NL*
it
is
considered
a
ground
for
complaint
if
a
man
's
writings
admit
*NL*
of
more
than
one
interpretation
.
While
England
endeavors
to
cure
the
*NL*
potato-rot
,
will
not
any
endeavor
to
cure
the
brain-rot
,
which
prevails
*NL*
so
much
more
widely
and
fatally
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
suppose
that
I
have
attained
to
obscurity
,
but
I
should
be
*NL*
proud
if
no
more
fatal
fault
were
found
with
my
pages
on
this
score
than
*NL*
was
found
with
the
Walden
ice
.
Southern
customers
objected
to
its
blue
*NL*
color
,
which
is
the
evidence
of
its
purity
,
as
if
it
were
muddy
,
and
*NL*
preferred
the
Cambridge
ice
,
which
is
white
,
but
tastes
of
weeds
.
The
*NL*
purity
men
love
is
like
the
mists
which
envelop
the
earth
,
and
not
like
*NL*
the
azure
ether
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
are
dinning
in
our
ears
that
we
Americans
,
and
moderns
generally
,
*NL*
are
intellectual
dwarfs
compared
with
the
ancients
,
or
even
the
*NL*
Elizabethan
men
.
But
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
?
A
living
dog
is
better
*NL*
than
a
dead
lion
.
Shall
a
man
go
and
hang
himself
because
he
belongs
to
*NL*
the
race
of
pygmies
,
and
not
be
the
biggest
pygmy
that
he
can
?
Let
every
*NL*
one
mind
his
own
business
,
and
endeavor
to
be
what
he
was
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
we
be
in
such
desperate
haste
to
succeed
and
in
such
*NL*
desperate
enterprises
?
If
a
man
does
not
keep
pace
with
his
companions
,
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
because
he
hears
a
different
drummer
.
Let
him
step
to
the
*NL*
music
which
he
hears
,
however
measured
or
far
away
.
It
is
not
important
*NL*
that
he
should
mature
as
soon
as
an
apple
tree
or
an
oak
.
Shall
he
turn
*NL*
his
spring
into
summer
?
If
the
condition
of
things
which
we
were
made
*NL*
for
is
not
yet
,
what
were
any
reality
which
we
can
substitute
?
We
will
*NL*
not
be
shipwrecked
on
a
vain
reality
.
Shall
we
with
pains
erect
a
heaven
*NL*
of
blue
glass
over
ourselves
,
though
when
it
is
done
we
shall
be
sure
to
*NL*
gaze
still
at
the
true
ethereal
heaven
far
above
,
as
if
the
former
were
*NL*
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
artist
in
the
city
of
Kouroo
who
was
disposed
to
strive
*NL*
after
perfection
.
One
day
it
came
into
his
mind
to
make
a
staff
.
Having
*NL*
considered
that
in
an
imperfect
work
time
is
an
ingredient
,
but
into
*NL*
a
perfect
work
time
does
not
enter
,
he
said
to
himself
,
It
shall
be
*NL*
perfect
in
all
respects
,
though
I
should
do
nothing
else
in
my
life
.
*NL*
He
proceeded
instantly
to
the
forest
for
wood
,
being
resolved
that
it
*NL*
should
not
be
made
of
unsuitable
material
;
and
as
he
searched
for
and
*NL*
rejected
stick
after
stick
,
his
friends
gradually
deserted
him
,
for
they
*NL*
grew
old
in
their
works
and
died
,
but
he
grew
not
older
by
a
moment
.
His
*NL*
singleness
of
purpose
and
resolution
,
and
his
elevated
piety
,
endowed
*NL*
him
,
without
his
knowledge
,
with
perennial
youth
.
As
he
made
no
*NL*
compromise
with
Time
,
Time
kept
out
of
his
way
,
and
only
sighed
at
a
*NL*
distance
because
he
could
not
overcome
him
.
Before
he
had
found
a
stock
*NL*
in
all
respects
suitable
the
city
of
Kouroo
was
a
hoary
ruin
,
and
he
*NL*
sat
on
one
of
its
mounds
to
peel
the
stick
.
Before
he
had
given
it
the
*NL*
proper
shape
the
dynasty
of
the
Candahars
was
at
an
end
,
and
with
the
*NL*
point
of
the
stick
he
wrote
the
name
of
the
last
of
that
race
in
*NL*
the
sand
,
and
then
resumed
his
work
.
By
the
time
he
had
smoothed
and
*NL*
polished
the
staff
Kalpa
was
no
longer
the
pole-star
;
and
ere
he
had
*NL*
put
on
the
ferule
and
the
head
adorned
with
precious
stones
,
Brahma
*NL*
had
awoke
and
slumbered
many
times
.
But
why
do
I
stay
to
mention
these
*NL*
things
?
When
the
finishing
stroke
was
put
to
his
work
,
it
suddenly
*NL*
expanded
before
the
eyes
of
the
astonished
artist
into
the
fairest
of
*NL*
all
the
creations
of
Brahma
.
He
had
made
a
new
system
in
making
a
staff
,
*NL*
a
world
with
full
and
fair
proportions
;
in
which
,
though
the
old
cities
*NL*
and
dynasties
had
passed
away
,
fairer
and
more
glorious
ones
had
taken
*NL*
their
places
.
And
now
he
saw
by
the
heap
of
shavings
still
fresh
at
his
*NL*
feet
,
that
,
for
him
and
his
work
,
the
former
lapse
of
time
had
been
*NL*
an
illusion
,
and
that
no
more
time
had
elapsed
than
is
required
for
a
*NL*
single
scintillation
from
the
brain
of
Brahma
to
fall
on
and
inflame
the
*NL*
tinder
of
a
mortal
brain
.
The
material
was
pure
,
and
his
art
was
pure
;
*NL*
how
could
the
result
be
other
than
wonderful
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
face
which
we
can
give
to
a
matter
will
stead
us
so
well
at
last
as
*NL*
the
truth
.
This
alone
wears
well
.
For
the
most
part
,
we
are
not
where
*NL*
we
are
,
but
in
a
false
position
.
Through
an
infinity
of
our
natures
,
we
*NL*
suppose
a
case
,
and
put
ourselves
into
it
,
and
hence
are
in
two
cases
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
and
it
is
doubly
difficult
to
get
out
.
In
sane
moments
we
*NL*
regard
only
the
facts
,
the
case
that
is
.
Say
what
you
have
to
say
,
not
*NL*
what
you
ought
.
Any
truth
is
better
than
make-believe
.
Tom
Hyde
,
the
*NL*
tinker
,
standing
on
the
gallows
,
was
asked
if
he
had
anything
to
say
.
*NL*
``
Tell
the
tailors
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
remember
to
make
a
knot
in
their
thread
*NL*
before
they
take
the
first
stitch
.
''
His
companion
's
prayer
is
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
mean
your
life
is
,
meet
it
and
live
it
;
do
not
shun
it
and
call
*NL*
it
hard
names
.
It
is
not
so
bad
as
you
are
.
It
looks
poorest
when
you
*NL*
are
richest
.
The
fault-finder
will
find
faults
even
in
paradise
.
Love
*NL*
your
life
,
poor
as
it
is
.
You
may
perhaps
have
some
pleasant
,
thrilling
,
*NL*
glorious
hours
,
even
in
a
poorhouse
.
The
setting
sun
is
reflected
from
*NL*
the
windows
of
the
almshouse
as
brightly
as
from
the
rich
man
's
abode
;
*NL*
the
snow
melts
before
its
door
as
early
in
the
spring
.
I
do
not
see
*NL*
but
a
quiet
mind
may
live
as
contentedly
there
,
and
have
as
cheering
*NL*
thoughts
,
as
in
a
palace
.
The
town
's
poor
seem
to
me
often
to
live
the
*NL*
most
independent
lives
of
any
.
Maybe
they
are
simply
great
enough
*NL*
to
receive
without
misgiving
.
Most
think
that
they
are
above
being
*NL*
supported
by
the
town
;
but
it
oftener
happens
that
they
are
not
*NL*
above
supporting
themselves
by
dishonest
means
,
which
should
be
more
*NL*
disreputable
.
Cultivate
poverty
like
a
garden
herb
,
like
sage
.
Do
not
*NL*
trouble
yourself
much
to
get
new
things
,
whether
clothes
or
friends
.
*NL*
Turn
the
old
;
return
to
them
.
Things
do
not
change
;
we
change
.
Sell
*NL*
your
clothes
and
keep
your
thoughts
.
God
will
see
that
you
do
not
want
*NL*
society
.
If
I
were
confined
to
a
corner
of
a
garret
all
my
days
,
like
a
*NL*
spider
,
the
world
would
be
just
as
large
to
me
while
I
had
my
thoughts
*NL*
about
me
.
The
philosopher
said
:
``
From
an
army
of
three
divisions
one
*NL*
can
take
away
its
general
,
and
put
it
in
disorder
;
from
the
man
the
*NL*
most
abject
and
vulgar
one
can
not
take
away
his
thought
.
''
Do
not
seek
so
*NL*
anxiously
to
be
developed
,
to
subject
yourself
to
many
influences
to
*NL*
be
played
on
;
it
is
all
dissipation
.
Humility
like
darkness
reveals
the
*NL*
heavenly
lights
.
The
shadows
of
poverty
and
meanness
gather
around
us
,
*NL*
``
and
lo
!
creation
widens
to
our
view
.
''
We
are
often
reminded
that
if
*NL*
there
were
bestowed
on
us
the
wealth
of
Croesus
,
our
aims
must
still
*NL*
be
the
same
,
and
our
means
essentially
the
same
.
Moreover
,
if
you
*NL*
are
restricted
in
your
range
by
poverty
,
if
you
can
not
buy
books
and
*NL*
newspapers
,
for
instance
,
you
are
but
confined
to
the
most
significant
*NL*
and
vital
experiences
;
you
are
compelled
to
deal
with
the
material
which
*NL*
yields
the
most
sugar
and
the
most
starch
.
It
is
life
near
the
bone
*NL*
where
it
is
sweetest
.
You
are
defended
from
being
a
trifler
.
No
man
*NL*
loses
ever
on
a
lower
level
by
magnanimity
on
a
higher
.
Superfluous
*NL*
wealth
can
buy
superfluities
only
.
Money
is
not
required
to
buy
one
*NL*
necessary
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
live
in
the
angle
of
a
leaden
wall
,
into
whose
composition
was
poured
*NL*
a
little
alloy
of
bell-metal
.
Often
,
in
the
repose
of
my
mid-day
,
there
*NL*
reaches
my
ears
a
confused
tintinnabulum
from
without
.
It
is
the
noise
*NL*
of
my
contemporaries
.
My
neighbors
tell
me
of
their
adventures
*NL*
with
famous
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
what
notabilities
they
met
at
the
*NL*
dinner-table
;
but
I
am
no
more
interested
in
such
things
than
in
the
*NL*
contents
of
the
Daily
Times
.
The
interest
and
the
conversation
are
about
*NL*
costume
and
manners
chiefly
;
but
a
goose
is
a
goose
still
,
dress
it
*NL*
as
you
will
.
They
tell
me
of
California
and
Texas
,
of
England
and
the
*NL*
Indies
,
of
the
Hon.
Mr.
--
of
Georgia
or
of
Massachusetts
,
all
transient
*NL*
and
fleeting
phenomena
,
till
I
am
ready
to
leap
from
their
court-yard
*NL*
like
the
Mameluke
bey
.
I
delight
to
come
to
my
bearings
--
not
walk
in
*NL*
procession
with
pomp
and
parade
,
in
a
conspicuous
place
,
but
to
walk
*NL*
even
with
the
Builder
of
the
universe
,
if
I
may
--
not
to
live
in
this
*NL*
restless
,
nervous
,
bustling
,
trivial
Nineteenth
Century
,
but
stand
or
*NL*
sit
thoughtfully
while
it
goes
by
.
What
are
men
celebrating
?
They
are
*NL*
all
on
a
committee
of
arrangements
,
and
hourly
expect
a
speech
from
*NL*
somebody
.
God
is
only
the
president
of
the
day
,
and
Webster
is
his
*NL*
orator
.
I
love
to
weigh
,
to
settle
,
to
gravitate
toward
that
which
most
*NL*
strongly
and
rightfully
attracts
me
--
not
hang
by
the
beam
of
the
scale
*NL*
and
try
to
weigh
less
--
not
suppose
a
case
,
but
take
the
case
that
is
;
to
*NL*
travel
the
only
path
I
can
,
and
that
on
which
no
power
can
resist
me
.
It
*NL*
affords
me
no
satisfaction
to
commerce
to
spring
an
arch
before
I
have
*NL*
got
a
solid
foundation
.
Let
us
not
play
at
kittly-benders
.
There
is
a
*NL*
solid
bottom
everywhere
.
We
read
that
the
traveller
asked
the
boy
if
*NL*
the
swamp
before
him
had
a
hard
bottom
.
The
boy
replied
that
it
had
.
*NL*
But
presently
the
traveller
's
horse
sank
in
up
to
the
girths
,
and
*NL*
he
observed
to
the
boy
,
``
I
thought
you
said
that
this
bog
had
a
hard
*NL*
bottom
.
''
``
So
it
has
,
''
answered
the
latter
,
``
but
you
have
not
got
half
*NL*
way
to
it
yet
.
''
So
it
is
with
the
bogs
and
quicksands
of
society
;
but
*NL*
he
is
an
old
boy
that
knows
it
.
Only
what
is
thought
,
said
,
or
done
at
*NL*
a
certain
rare
coincidence
is
good
.
I
would
not
be
one
of
those
who
will
*NL*
foolishly
drive
a
nail
into
mere
lath
and
plastering
;
such
a
deed
would
*NL*
keep
me
awake
nights
.
Give
me
a
hammer
,
and
let
me
feel
for
the
*NL*
furring
.
Do
not
depend
on
the
putty
.
Drive
a
nail
home
and
clinch
it
so
*NL*
faithfully
that
you
can
wake
up
in
the
night
and
think
of
your
work
with
*NL*
satisfaction
--
a
work
at
which
you
would
not
be
ashamed
to
invoke
the
*NL*
Muse
.
So
will
help
you
God
,
and
so
only
.
Every
nail
driven
should
be
as
*NL*
another
rivet
in
the
machine
of
the
universe
,
you
carrying
on
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rather
than
love
,
than
money
,
than
fame
,
give
me
truth
.
I
sat
at
a
table
*NL*
where
were
rich
food
and
wine
in
abundance
,
and
obsequious
attendance
,
*NL*
but
sincerity
and
truth
were
not
;
and
I
went
away
hungry
from
the
*NL*
inhospitable
board
.
The
hospitality
was
as
cold
as
the
ices
.
I
thought
*NL*
that
there
was
no
need
of
ice
to
freeze
them
.
They
talked
to
me
of
the
*NL*
age
of
the
wine
and
the
fame
of
the
vintage
;
but
I
thought
of
an
older
,
*NL*
a
newer
,
and
purer
wine
,
of
a
more
glorious
vintage
,
which
they
had
*NL*
not
got
,
and
could
not
buy
.
The
style
,
the
house
and
grounds
and
*NL*
``
entertainment
''
pass
for
nothing
with
me
.
I
called
on
the
king
,
but
he
*NL*
made
me
wait
in
his
hall
,
and
conducted
like
a
man
incapacitated
for
*NL*
hospitality
.
There
was
a
man
in
my
neighborhood
who
lived
in
a
hollow
*NL*
tree
.
His
manners
were
truly
regal
.
I
should
have
done
better
had
I
*NL*
called
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
shall
we
sit
in
our
porticoes
practising
idle
and
musty
*NL*
virtues
,
which
any
work
would
make
impertinent
?
As
if
one
were
to
begin
*NL*
the
day
with
long-suffering
,
and
hire
a
man
to
hoe
his
potatoes
;
and
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
go
forth
to
practise
Christian
meekness
and
charity
*NL*
with
goodness
aforethought
!
Consider
the
China
pride
and
stagnant
*NL*
self-complacency
of
mankind
.
This
generation
inclines
a
little
to
*NL*
congratulate
itself
on
being
the
last
of
an
illustrious
line
;
and
in
*NL*
Boston
and
London
and
Paris
and
Rome
,
thinking
of
its
long
descent
,
*NL*
it
speaks
of
its
progress
in
art
and
science
and
literature
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
There
are
the
Records
of
the
Philosophical
Societies
,
and
*NL*
the
public
Eulogies
of
Great
Men
!
It
is
the
good
Adam
contemplating
his
*NL*
own
virtue
.
``
Yes
,
we
have
done
great
deeds
,
and
sung
divine
songs
,
which
*NL*
shall
never
die
''
--
that
is
,
as
long
as
we
can
remember
them
.
The
learned
*NL*
societies
and
great
men
of
Assyria
--
where
are
they
?
What
youthful
*NL*
philosophers
and
experimentalists
we
are
!
There
is
not
one
of
my
readers
*NL*
who
has
yet
lived
a
whole
human
life
.
These
may
be
but
the
spring
months
*NL*
in
the
life
of
the
race
.
If
we
have
had
the
seven-years
'
itch
,
we
have
*NL*
not
seen
the
seventeen-year
locust
yet
in
Concord
.
We
are
acquainted
*NL*
with
a
mere
pellicle
of
the
globe
on
which
we
live
.
Most
have
not
delved
*NL*
six
feet
beneath
the
surface
,
nor
leaped
as
many
above
it
.
We
know
not
*NL*
where
we
are
.
Beside
,
we
are
sound
asleep
nearly
half
our
time
.
Yet
we
*NL*
esteem
ourselves
wise
,
and
have
an
established
order
on
the
surface
.
*NL*
Truly
,
we
are
deep
thinkers
,
we
are
ambitious
spirits
!
As
I
stand
over
*NL*
the
insect
crawling
amid
the
pine
needles
on
the
forest
floor
,
and
*NL*
endeavoring
to
conceal
itself
from
my
sight
,
and
ask
myself
why
it
will
*NL*
cherish
those
humble
thoughts
,
and
bide
its
head
from
me
who
might
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
be
its
benefactor
,
and
impart
to
its
race
some
cheering
*NL*
information
,
I
am
reminded
of
the
greater
Benefactor
and
Intelligence
*NL*
that
stands
over
me
the
human
insect
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
an
incessant
influx
of
novelty
into
the
world
,
and
yet
we
*NL*
tolerate
incredible
dulness
.
I
need
only
suggest
what
kind
of
sermons
*NL*
are
still
listened
to
in
the
most
enlightened
countries
.
There
are
such
*NL*
words
as
joy
and
sorrow
,
but
they
are
only
the
burden
of
a
psalm
,
sung
*NL*
with
a
nasal
twang
,
while
we
believe
in
the
ordinary
and
mean
.
We
think
*NL*
that
we
can
change
our
clothes
only
.
It
is
said
that
the
British
*NL*
Empire
is
very
large
and
respectable
,
and
that
the
United
States
are
a
*NL*
first-rate
power
.
We
do
not
believe
that
a
tide
rises
and
falls
behind
*NL*
every
man
which
can
float
the
British
Empire
like
a
chip
,
if
he
should
*NL*
ever
harbor
it
in
his
mind
.
Who
knows
what
sort
of
seventeen-year
locust
*NL*
will
next
come
out
of
the
ground
?
The
government
of
the
world
I
live
in
*NL*
was
not
framed
,
like
that
of
Britain
,
in
after-dinner
conversations
over
*NL*
the
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
in
us
is
like
the
water
in
the
river
.
It
may
rise
this
year
*NL*
higher
than
man
has
ever
known
it
,
and
flood
the
parched
uplands
;
even
*NL*
this
may
be
the
eventful
year
,
which
will
drown
out
all
our
muskrats
.
It
*NL*
was
not
always
dry
land
where
we
dwell
.
I
see
far
inland
the
banks
*NL*
which
the
stream
anciently
washed
,
before
science
began
to
record
its
*NL*
freshets
.
Every
one
has
heard
the
story
which
has
gone
the
rounds
of
New
*NL*
England
,
of
a
strong
and
beautiful
bug
which
came
out
of
the
dry
leaf
of
*NL*
an
old
table
of
apple-tree
wood
,
which
had
stood
in
a
farmer
's
*NL*
kitchen
for
sixty
years
,
first
in
Connecticut
,
and
afterward
in
*NL*
Massachusetts
--
from
an
egg
deposited
in
the
living
tree
many
years
*NL*
earlier
still
,
as
appeared
by
counting
the
annual
layers
beyond
it
;
*NL*
which
was
heard
gnawing
out
for
several
weeks
,
hatched
perchance
by
*NL*
the
heat
of
an
urn
.
Who
does
not
feel
his
faith
in
a
resurrection
and
*NL*
immortality
strengthened
by
hearing
of
this
?
Who
knows
what
beautiful
*NL*
and
winged
life
,
whose
egg
has
been
buried
for
ages
under
many
*NL*
concentric
layers
of
woodenness
in
the
dead
dry
life
of
society
,
*NL*
deposited
at
first
in
the
alburnum
of
the
green
and
living
tree
,
which
*NL*
has
been
gradually
converted
into
the
semblance
of
its
well-seasoned
*NL*
tomb
--
heard
perchance
gnawing
out
now
for
years
by
the
astonished
family
*NL*
of
man
,
as
they
sat
round
the
festive
board
--
may
unexpectedly
come
forth
*NL*
from
amidst
society
's
most
trivial
and
handselled
furniture
,
to
enjoy
*NL*
its
perfect
summer
life
at
last
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
say
that
John
or
Jonathan
will
realize
all
this
;
but
such
is
*NL*
the
character
of
that
morrow
which
mere
lapse
of
time
can
never
make
to
*NL*
dawn
.
The
light
which
puts
out
our
eyes
is
darkness
to
us
.
Only
that
day
*NL*
dawns
to
which
we
are
awake
.
There
is
more
day
to
dawn
.
The
sun
is
but
a
*NL*
morning
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ON
THE
DUTY
OF
CIVIL
DISOBEDIENCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
heartily
accept
the
motto
,
--
``
That
government
is
best
which
governs
*NL*
least
''
;
and
I
should
like
to
see
it
acted
up
to
more
rapidly
and
*NL*
systematically
.
Carried
out
,
it
finally
amounts
to
this
,
which
also
I
*NL*
believe
,
--
``
That
government
is
best
which
governs
not
at
all
''
;
and
when
*NL*
men
are
prepared
for
it
,
that
will
be
the
kind
of
government
which
they
*NL*
will
have
.
Government
is
at
best
but
an
expedient
;
but
most
governments
*NL*
are
usually
,
and
all
governments
are
sometimes
,
inexpedient
.
The
*NL*
objections
which
have
been
brought
against
a
standing
army
,
and
they
are
*NL*
many
and
weighty
,
and
deserve
to
prevail
,
may
also
at
last
be
brought
*NL*
against
a
standing
government
.
The
standing
army
is
only
an
arm
of
the
*NL*
standing
government
.
The
government
itself
,
which
is
only
the
mode
which
*NL*
the
people
have
chosen
to
execute
their
will
,
is
equally
liable
to
be
*NL*
abused
and
perverted
before
the
people
can
act
through
it
.
Witness
the
*NL*
present
Mexican
war
,
the
work
of
comparatively
a
few
individuals
using
*NL*
the
standing
government
as
their
tool
;
for
,
in
the
outset
,
the
people
*NL*
would
not
have
consented
to
this
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
American
government
--
what
is
it
but
a
tradition
,
though
a
recent
*NL*
one
,
endeavoring
to
transmit
itself
unimpaired
to
posterity
,
but
each
*NL*
instant
losing
some
of
its
integrity
?
It
has
not
the
vitality
and
force
*NL*
of
a
single
living
man
;
for
a
single
man
can
bend
it
to
his
will
.
It
is
*NL*
a
sort
of
wooden
gun
to
the
people
themselves
.
But
it
is
not
the
less
*NL*
necessary
for
this
;
for
the
people
must
have
some
complicated
machinery
*NL*
or
other
,
and
hear
its
din
,
to
satisfy
that
idea
of
government
which
*NL*
they
have
.
Governments
show
thus
how
successfully
men
can
be
imposed
on
,
*NL*
even
impose
on
themselves
,
for
their
own
advantage
.
It
is
excellent
,
we
*NL*
must
all
allow
.
Yet
this
government
never
of
itself
furthered
any
*NL*
enterprise
,
but
by
the
alacrity
with
which
it
got
out
of
its
way
.
_
It
_
*NL*
does
not
keep
the
country
free
.
_
It
_
does
not
settle
the
West
.
_
It
_
does
*NL*
not
educate
.
The
character
inherent
in
the
American
people
has
done
all
*NL*
that
has
been
accomplished
;
and
it
would
have
done
somewhat
more
,
if
the
*NL*
government
had
not
sometimes
got
in
its
way
.
For
government
is
an
*NL*
expedient
by
which
men
would
fain
succeed
in
letting
one
another
alone
;
*NL*
and
,
as
has
been
said
,
when
it
is
most
expedient
,
the
governed
are
most
*NL*
let
alone
by
it
.
Trade
and
commerce
,
if
they
were
not
made
of
India
*NL*
rubber
,
would
never
manage
to
bounce
over
the
obstacles
which
*NL*
legislators
are
continually
putting
in
their
way
;
and
,
if
one
were
to
*NL*
judge
these
men
wholly
by
the
effects
of
their
actions
,
and
not
partly
*NL*
by
their
intentions
,
they
would
deserve
to
be
classed
and
punished
with
*NL*
those
mischievous
persons
who
put
obstructions
on
the
railroads
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
to
speak
practically
and
as
a
citizen
,
unlike
those
who
call
*NL*
themselves
no-government
men
,
I
ask
for
,
not
at
once
no
government
,
*NL*
but
_
at
once
_
a
better
government
.
Let
every
man
make
known
what
kind
of
*NL*
government
would
command
his
respect
,
and
that
will
be
one
step
toward
*NL*
obtaining
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
the
practical
reason
why
,
when
the
power
is
once
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
people
,
a
majority
are
permitted
,
and
for
a
long
period
continue
,
*NL*
to
rule
,
is
not
because
they
are
most
likely
to
be
in
the
right
,
*NL*
nor
because
this
seems
fairest
to
the
minority
,
but
because
they
are
*NL*
physically
the
strongest
.
But
a
government
in
which
the
majority
rule
in
*NL*
all
cases
can
not
be
based
on
justice
,
even
as
far
as
men
understand
*NL*
it
.
Can
there
not
be
a
government
in
which
majorities
do
not
virtually
*NL*
decide
right
and
wrong
,
but
conscience
?
--
in
which
majorities
decide
only
*NL*
those
questions
to
which
the
rule
of
expediency
is
applicable
?
Must
the
*NL*
citizen
ever
for
a
moment
,
or
in
the
least
degree
,
resign
his
conscience
*NL*
to
the
legislator
?
Why
has
every
man
a
conscience
,
then
?
I
think
that
*NL*
we
should
be
men
first
,
and
subjects
afterward
.
It
is
not
desirable
*NL*
to
cultivate
a
respect
for
the
law
,
so
much
as
for
the
right
.
The
only
*NL*
obligation
which
I
have
a
right
to
assume
is
to
do
at
any
time
what
*NL*
I
think
right
.
It
is
truly
enough
said
that
a
corporation
has
no
*NL*
conscience
;
but
a
corporation
of
conscientious
men
is
a
corporation
*NL*
with
a
conscience
.
Law
never
made
men
a
whit
more
just
;
and
,
by
means
of
*NL*
their
respect
for
it
,
even
the
well-disposed
are
daily
made
the
agents
*NL*
of
injustice
.
A
common
and
natural
result
of
an
undue
respect
for
law
*NL*
is
,
that
you
may
see
a
file
of
soldiers
,
colonel
,
captain
,
corporal
,
*NL*
privates
,
powder-monkeys
,
and
all
,
marching
in
admirable
order
over
*NL*
hill
and
dale
to
the
wars
,
against
their
wills
,
ay
,
against
their
common
*NL*
sense
and
consciences
,
which
makes
it
very
steep
marching
indeed
,
and
*NL*
produces
a
palpitation
of
the
heart
.
They
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
*NL*
damnable
business
in
which
they
are
concerned
;
they
are
all
peaceably
*NL*
inclined
.
Now
,
what
are
they
?
Men
at
all
?
or
small
movable
forts
and
*NL*
magazines
,
at
the
service
of
some
unscrupulous
man
in
power
?
Visit
the
*NL*
Navy
Yard
,
and
behold
a
marine
,
such
a
man
as
an
American
government
can
*NL*
make
,
or
such
as
it
can
make
a
man
with
its
black
arts
--
a
mere
shadow
*NL*
and
reminiscence
of
humanity
,
a
man
laid
out
alive
and
standing
,
and
*NL*
already
,
as
one
may
say
,
buried
under
arms
with
funeral
accompaniments
,
*NL*
though
it
may
be
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
drum
was
heard
,
not
a
funeral
note
,
*NL*
As
his
corpse
to
the
rampart
we
hurried
;
*NL*
Not
a
soldier
discharged
his
farewell
shot
*NL*
O'er
the
grave
where
our
hero
we
buried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mass
of
men
serve
the
state
thus
,
not
as
men
mainly
,
but
as
*NL*
machines
,
with
their
bodies
.
They
are
the
standing
army
,
and
the
*NL*
militia
,
jailers
,
constables
,
posse
comitatus
,
etc.
.
In
most
cases
there
*NL*
is
no
free
exercise
whatever
of
the
judgment
or
of
the
moral
sense
;
*NL*
but
they
put
themselves
on
a
level
with
wood
and
earth
and
stones
;
and
*NL*
wooden
men
can
perhaps
be
manufactured
that
will
serve
the
purpose
as
*NL*
well
.
Such
command
no
more
respect
than
men
of
straw
or
a
lump
of
dirt
.
*NL*
They
have
the
same
sort
of
worth
only
as
horses
and
dogs
.
Yet
such
*NL*
as
these
even
are
commonly
esteemed
good
citizens
.
Others
,
as
most
*NL*
legislators
,
politicians
,
lawyers
,
ministers
,
and
office-holders
,
serve
*NL*
the
state
chiefly
with
their
heads
;
and
,
as
they
rarely
make
any
moral
*NL*
distinctions
,
they
are
as
likely
to
serve
the
devil
,
without
_
intending
_
*NL*
it
,
as
God
.
A
very
few
,
as
heroes
,
patriots
,
martyrs
,
reformers
in
the
*NL*
great
sense
,
and
men
,
serve
the
state
with
their
consciences
also
,
*NL*
and
so
necessarily
resist
it
for
the
most
part
;
and
they
are
commonly
*NL*
treated
as
enemies
by
it
.
A
wise
man
will
only
be
useful
as
a
man
,
and
*NL*
will
not
submit
to
be
``
clay
,
''
and
``
stop
a
hole
to
keep
the
wind
away
,
''
*NL*
but
leave
that
office
to
his
dust
at
least
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
too
high-born
to
be
propertied
,
*NL*
To
be
a
secondary
at
control
,
*NL*
Or
useful
serving-man
and
instrument
*NL*
To
any
sovereign
state
throughout
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
gives
himself
entirely
to
his
fellow-men
appears
to
them
useless
*NL*
and
selfish
;
but
he
who
gives
himself
partially
to
them
is
pronounced
a
*NL*
benefactor
and
philanthropist
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
does
it
become
a
man
to
behave
toward
this
American
government
*NL*
to-day
?
I
answer
,
that
he
can
not
without
disgrace
be
associated
with
*NL*
it
.
I
can
not
for
an
instant
recognize
that
political
organization
as
_
my
_
*NL*
government
which
is
the
_
slave
's
_
government
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
men
recognize
the
right
of
revolution
;
that
is
,
the
right
to
refuse
*NL*
allegiance
to
,
and
to
resist
,
the
government
,
when
its
tyranny
or
its
*NL*
inefficiency
are
great
and
unendurable
.
But
almost
all
say
that
such
is
*NL*
not
the
case
now
.
But
such
was
the
case
,
they
think
,
in
the
Revolution
*NL*
of
'
75
.
If
one
were
to
tell
me
that
this
was
a
bad
government
because
*NL*
it
taxed
certain
foreign
commodities
brought
to
its
ports
,
it
is
most
*NL*
probable
that
I
should
not
make
an
ado
about
it
,
for
I
can
do
without
*NL*
them
.
All
machines
have
their
friction
;
and
possibly
this
does
enough
*NL*
good
to
counterbalance
the
evil
.
At
any
rate
,
it
is
a
great
evil
to
make
*NL*
a
stir
about
it
.
But
when
the
friction
comes
to
have
its
machine
,
and
*NL*
oppression
and
robbery
are
organized
,
I
say
,
let
us
not
have
such
a
*NL*
machine
any
longer
.
In
other
words
,
when
a
sixth
of
the
population
of
a
*NL*
nation
which
has
undertaken
to
be
the
refuge
of
liberty
are
slaves
,
and
*NL*
a
whole
country
is
unjustly
overrun
and
conquered
by
a
foreign
army
,
and
*NL*
subjected
to
military
law
,
I
think
that
it
is
not
too
soon
for
honest
*NL*
men
to
rebel
and
revolutionize
.
What
makes
this
duty
the
more
urgent
*NL*
is
the
fact
that
the
country
so
overrun
is
not
our
own
,
but
ours
is
the
*NL*
invading
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paley
,
a
common
authority
with
many
on
moral
questions
,
in
his
chapter
*NL*
on
the
``
Duty
of
Submission
to
Civil
Government
,
''
resolves
all
civil
*NL*
obligation
into
expediency
;
and
he
proceeds
to
say
that
``
so
long
as
*NL*
the
interest
of
the
whole
society
requires
it
,
that
is
,
so
long
as
the
*NL*
established
government
can
not
be
resisted
or
changed
without
public
*NL*
inconveniency
,
it
is
the
will
of
God
...
that
the
established
government
*NL*
be
obeyed
,
and
no
longer
...
This
principle
being
admitted
,
the
justice
*NL*
of
every
particular
case
of
resistance
is
reduced
to
a
computation
of
*NL*
the
quantity
of
the
danger
and
grievance
on
the
one
side
,
and
of
the
*NL*
probability
and
expense
of
redressing
it
on
the
other
.
''
Of
this
,
he
*NL*
says
,
every
man
shall
judge
for
himself
.
But
Paley
appears
never
to
have
*NL*
contemplated
those
cases
to
which
the
rule
of
expediency
does
not
apply
,
*NL*
in
which
a
people
,
as
well
as
an
individual
,
must
do
justice
,
cost
what
*NL*
it
may
.
If
I
have
unjustly
wrested
a
plank
from
a
drowning
man
,
I
must
*NL*
restore
it
to
him
though
I
drown
myself
.
This
,
according
to
Paley
,
would
*NL*
be
inconvenient
.
But
he
that
would
save
his
life
,
in
such
a
case
,
shall
*NL*
lose
it
.
This
people
must
cease
to
hold
slaves
,
and
to
make
war
on
*NL*
Mexico
,
though
it
cost
them
their
existence
as
a
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
practice
,
nations
agree
with
Paley
;
but
does
any
one
think
that
*NL*
Massachusetts
does
exactly
what
is
right
at
the
present
crisis
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
drab
of
state
,
a
cloth-o
'
-
silver
slut
,
*NL*
To
have
her
train
borne
up
,
and
her
soul
trail
in
the
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Practically
speaking
,
the
opponents
to
a
reform
in
Massachusetts
are
*NL*
not
a
hundred
thousand
politicians
at
the
South
,
but
a
hundred
thousand
*NL*
merchants
and
farmers
here
,
who
are
more
interested
in
commerce
and
*NL*
agriculture
than
they
are
in
humanity
,
and
are
not
prepared
to
do
*NL*
justice
to
the
slave
and
to
Mexico
,
_
cost
what
it
may
_
.
I
quarrel
not
with
*NL*
far-off
foes
,
but
with
those
who
,
near
at
home
,
co-operate
with
,
and
*NL*
do
the
bidding
of
those
far
away
,
and
without
whom
the
latter
would
be
*NL*
harmless
.
We
are
accustomed
to
say
,
that
the
mass
of
men
are
unprepared
;
*NL*
but
improvement
is
slow
,
because
the
few
are
not
materially
wiser
or
*NL*
better
than
the
many
.
It
is
not
so
important
that
many
should
be
as
good
*NL*
as
you
,
as
that
there
be
some
absolute
goodness
somewhere
;
for
that
will
*NL*
leaven
the
whole
lump
.
There
are
thousands
who
are
_
in
opinion
_
opposed
*NL*
to
slavery
and
to
the
war
,
who
yet
in
effect
do
nothing
to
put
an
end
to
*NL*
them
;
who
,
esteeming
themselves
children
of
Washington
and
Franklin
,
sit
*NL*
down
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
,
and
say
that
they
know
not
what
*NL*
to
do
,
and
do
nothing
;
who
even
postpone
the
question
of
freedom
to
the
*NL*
question
of
free-trade
,
and
quietly
read
the
prices-current
along
with
*NL*
the
latest
advices
from
Mexico
,
after
dinner
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
fall
*NL*
asleep
over
them
both
.
What
is
the
price-current
of
an
honest
man
and
*NL*
patriot
to-day
?
They
hesitate
,
and
they
regret
,
and
sometimes
they
*NL*
petition
;
but
they
do
nothing
in
earnest
and
with
effect
.
They
will
*NL*
wait
,
well
disposed
,
for
others
to
remedy
the
evil
,
that
they
may
no
*NL*
longer
have
it
to
regret
.
At
most
,
they
give
only
a
cheap
vote
,
and
a
*NL*
feeble
countenance
and
Godspeed
,
to
the
right
,
as
it
goes
by
them
.
There
*NL*
are
nine
hundred
and
ninety-nine
patrons
of
virtue
to
one
virtuous
man
;
*NL*
but
it
is
easier
to
deal
with
the
real
possessor
of
a
thing
than
with
*NL*
the
temporary
guardian
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
voting
is
a
sort
of
gaming
,
like
checkers
or
backgammon
,
with
a
*NL*
slight
moral
tinge
to
it
,
a
playing
with
right
and
wrong
,
with
moral
*NL*
questions
;
and
betting
naturally
accompanies
it
.
The
character
of
the
*NL*
voters
is
not
staked
.
I
cast
my
vote
,
perchance
,
as
I
think
right
;
but
I
*NL*
am
not
vitally
concerned
that
that
right
should
prevail
.
I
am
willing
to
*NL*
leave
it
to
the
majority
.
Its
obligation
,
therefore
,
never
exceeds
that
*NL*
of
expediency
.
Even
voting
_
for
the
right
_
is
_
doing
nothing
_
for
it
.
It
is
*NL*
only
expressing
to
men
feebly
your
desire
that
it
should
prevail
.
A
*NL*
wise
man
will
not
leave
the
right
to
the
mercy
of
chance
,
nor
wish
it
to
*NL*
prevail
through
the
power
of
the
majority
.
There
is
but
little
virtue
in
*NL*
the
action
of
masses
of
men
.
When
the
majority
shall
at
length
vote
for
*NL*
the
abolition
of
slavery
,
it
will
be
because
they
are
indifferent
to
*NL*
slavery
,
or
because
there
is
but
little
slavery
left
to
be
abolished
by
*NL*
their
vote
.
_
They
_
will
then
be
the
only
slaves
.
Only
_
his
_
vote
can
hasten
*NL*
the
abolition
of
slavery
who
asserts
his
own
freedom
by
his
vote
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hear
of
a
convention
to
be
held
at
Baltimore
,
or
elsewhere
,
for
the
*NL*
selection
of
a
candidate
for
the
Presidency
,
made
up
chiefly
of
editors
,
*NL*
and
men
who
are
politicians
by
profession
;
but
I
think
,
what
is
it
to
*NL*
any
independent
,
intelligent
,
and
respectable
man
what
decision
they
*NL*
may
come
to
?
Shall
we
not
have
the
advantage
of
his
wisdom
and
honesty
,
*NL*
nevertheless
?
Can
we
not
count
upon
some
independent
votes
?
Are
there
*NL*
not
many
individuals
in
the
country
who
do
not
attend
conventions
?
But
*NL*
no
:
I
find
that
the
respectable
man
,
so
called
,
has
immediately
drifted
*NL*
from
his
position
,
and
despairs
of
his
country
,
when
his
country
has
*NL*
more
reason
to
despair
of
him
.
He
forthwith
adopts
one
of
the
candidates
*NL*
thus
selected
as
the
only
_
available
_
one
,
thus
proving
that
he
is
himself
*NL*
_
available
_
for
any
purposes
of
the
demagogue
.
His
vote
is
of
no
more
*NL*
worth
than
that
of
any
unprincipled
foreigner
or
hireling
native
,
who
*NL*
may
have
been
bought
.
Oh
for
a
man
who
is
a
_
man
_
,
and
,
as
my
neighbor
*NL*
says
,
has
a
bone
in
his
back
which
you
can
not
pass
your
hand
through
!
*NL*
Our
statistics
are
at
fault
:
the
population
has
been
returned
too
large
.
*NL*
How
many
_
men
_
are
there
to
a
square
thousand
miles
in
this
country
?
*NL*
Hardly
one
.
Does
not
America
offer
any
inducement
for
men
to
settle
*NL*
here
?
The
American
has
dwindled
into
an
Odd
Fellow
--
one
who
may
be
known
*NL*
by
the
development
of
his
organ
of
gregariousness
,
and
a
manifest
lack
*NL*
of
intellect
and
cheerful
self-reliance
;
whose
first
and
chief
concern
,
*NL*
on
coming
into
the
world
,
is
to
see
that
the
almshouses
are
in
good
*NL*
repair
;
and
,
before
yet
he
has
lawfully
donned
the
virile
garb
,
to
*NL*
collect
a
fund
for
the
support
of
the
widows
and
orphans
that
may
be
;
*NL*
who
,
in
short
ventures
to
live
only
by
the
aid
of
the
Mutual
Insurance
*NL*
company
,
which
has
promised
to
bury
him
decently
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
a
man
's
duty
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
to
devote
himself
to
the
*NL*
eradication
of
any
,
even
the
most
enormous
wrong
;
he
may
still
properly
*NL*
have
other
concerns
to
engage
him
;
but
it
is
his
duty
,
at
least
,
to
wash
*NL*
his
hands
of
it
,
and
,
if
he
gives
it
no
thought
longer
,
not
to
give
*NL*
it
practically
his
support
.
If
I
devote
myself
to
other
pursuits
and
*NL*
contemplations
,
I
must
first
see
,
at
least
,
that
I
do
not
pursue
them
*NL*
sitting
upon
another
man
's
shoulders
.
I
must
get
off
him
first
,
that
*NL*
he
may
pursue
his
contemplations
too
.
See
what
gross
inconsistency
is
*NL*
tolerated
.
I
have
heard
some
of
my
townsmen
say
,
``
I
should
like
to
have
*NL*
them
order
me
out
to
help
put
down
an
insurrection
of
the
slaves
,
or
to
*NL*
march
to
Mexico
;
--
see
if
I
would
go
''
;
and
yet
these
very
men
have
each
,
*NL*
directly
by
their
allegiance
,
and
so
indirectly
,
at
least
,
by
their
*NL*
money
,
furnished
a
substitute
.
The
soldier
is
applauded
who
refuses
to
*NL*
serve
in
an
unjust
war
by
those
who
do
not
refuse
to
sustain
the
unjust
*NL*
government
which
makes
the
war
;
is
applauded
by
those
whose
own
act
*NL*
and
authority
he
disregards
and
sets
at
naught
;
as
if
the
state
were
*NL*
penitent
to
that
degree
that
it
hired
one
to
scourge
it
while
it
sinned
,
*NL*
but
not
to
that
degree
that
it
left
off
sinning
for
a
moment
.
Thus
,
*NL*
under
the
name
of
Order
and
Civil
Government
,
we
are
all
made
at
last
to
*NL*
pay
homage
to
and
support
our
own
meanness
.
After
the
first
blush
of
*NL*
sin
comes
its
indifference
;
and
from
immoral
it
becomes
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
_
un_moral
,
and
not
quite
unnecessary
to
that
life
which
we
have
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
broadest
and
most
prevalent
error
requires
the
most
disinterested
*NL*
virtue
to
sustain
it
.
The
slight
reproach
to
which
the
virtue
of
*NL*
patriotism
is
commonly
liable
,
the
noble
are
most
likely
to
incur
.
*NL*
Those
who
,
while
they
disapprove
of
the
character
and
measures
of
a
*NL*
government
,
yield
to
it
their
allegiance
and
support
are
undoubtedly
*NL*
its
most
conscientious
supporters
,
and
so
frequently
the
most
serious
*NL*
obstacles
to
reform
.
Some
are
petitioning
the
State
to
dissolve
the
*NL*
Union
,
to
disregard
the
requisitions
of
the
President
.
Why
do
they
not
*NL*
dissolve
it
themselves
--
the
union
between
themselves
and
the
State
--
and
*NL*
refuse
to
pay
their
quota
into
its
treasury
?
Do
not
they
stand
in
the
*NL*
same
relation
to
the
State
,
that
the
State
does
to
the
Union
?
And
have
*NL*
not
the
same
reasons
prevented
the
State
from
resisting
the
Union
,
which
*NL*
have
prevented
them
from
resisting
the
State
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
can
a
man
be
satisfied
to
entertain
an
opinion
merely
,
and
enjoy
it
?
*NL*
Is
there
any
enjoyment
in
_
it
_
,
if
his
opinion
is
that
he
is
aggrieved
?
If
*NL*
you
are
cheated
out
of
a
single
dollar
by
your
neighbor
,
you
do
not
rest
*NL*
satisfied
with
knowing
that
you
are
cheated
,
or
with
saying
that
you
are
*NL*
cheated
,
or
even
with
petitioning
him
to
pay
you
your
due
;
but
you
take
*NL*
effectual
steps
at
once
to
obtain
the
full
amount
,
and
see
that
you
*NL*
are
never
cheated
again
.
Action
from
principle
--
the
perception
and
the
*NL*
performance
of
right
--
changes
things
and
relations
;
it
is
essentially
*NL*
revolutionary
,
and
does
not
consist
wholly
with
anything
which
was
.
*NL*
It
not
only
divides
states
and
churches
,
it
divides
families
;
ay
,
*NL*
it
divides
the
_
individual
_
,
separating
the
diabolical
in
him
from
the
*NL*
divine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unjust
laws
exist
;
shall
we
be
content
to
obey
them
,
or
shall
we
*NL*
endeavor
to
amend
them
,
and
obey
them
until
we
have
succeeded
,
or
shall
*NL*
we
transgress
them
at
once
?
Men
generally
,
under
such
a
government
*NL*
as
this
,
think
that
they
ought
to
wait
until
they
have
persuaded
the
*NL*
majority
to
alter
them
.
They
think
that
,
if
they
should
resist
,
*NL*
the
remedy
would
be
worse
than
the
evil
.
But
it
is
the
fault
of
the
*NL*
government
itself
that
the
remedy
_
is
_
worse
than
the
evil
.
_
It
_
makes
it
*NL*
worse
.
Why
is
it
not
more
apt
to
anticipate
and
provide
for
reform
?
Why
*NL*
does
it
not
cherish
its
wise
minority
?
Why
does
it
cry
and
resist
before
*NL*
it
is
hurt
?
Why
does
it
not
encourage
its
citizens
to
be
on
the
alert
to
*NL*
point
out
its
faults
,
and
_
do
_
better
than
it
would
have
them
?
Why
does
*NL*
it
always
crucify
Christ
,
and
excommunicate
Copernicus
and
Luther
,
and
*NL*
pronounce
Washington
and
Franklin
rebels
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
think
,
that
a
deliberate
and
practical
denial
of
its
authority
*NL*
was
the
only
offence
never
contemplated
by
government
;
else
,
why
has
it
*NL*
not
assigned
its
definite
,
its
suitable
and
proportionate
,
penalty
?
If
a
*NL*
man
who
has
no
property
refuses
but
once
to
earn
nine
shillings
for
*NL*
the
State
,
he
is
put
in
prison
for
a
period
unlimited
by
any
law
that
*NL*
I
know
,
and
determined
only
by
the
discretion
of
those
who
placed
him
*NL*
there
;
but
if
he
should
steal
ninety
times
nine
shillings
from
the
*NL*
State
,
he
is
soon
permitted
to
go
at
large
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
injustice
is
part
of
the
necessary
friction
of
the
machine
*NL*
of
government
,
let
it
go
,
let
it
go
;
perchance
it
will
wear
*NL*
smooth
--
certainly
the
machine
will
wear
out
.
If
the
injustice
has
a
*NL*
spring
,
or
a
pulley
,
or
a
rope
,
or
a
crank
,
exclusively
for
itself
,
then
*NL*
perhaps
you
may
consider
whether
the
remedy
will
not
be
worse
than
the
*NL*
evil
;
but
if
it
is
of
such
a
nature
that
it
requires
you
to
be
the
agent
*NL*
of
injustice
to
another
,
then
,
I
say
,
break
the
law
.
Let
your
life
be
*NL*
a
counter
friction
to
stop
the
machine
.
What
I
have
to
do
is
to
see
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
that
I
do
not
lend
myself
to
the
wrong
which
I
condemn
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
adopting
the
ways
which
the
State
has
provided
for
remedying
the
*NL*
evil
,
I
know
not
of
such
ways
.
They
take
too
much
time
,
and
a
man
's
life
*NL*
will
be
gone
.
I
have
other
affairs
to
attend
to
.
I
came
into
this
world
,
*NL*
not
chiefly
to
make
this
a
good
place
to
live
in
,
but
to
live
in
it
,
*NL*
be
it
good
or
bad
.
A
man
has
not
everything
to
do
,
but
something
;
and
*NL*
because
he
can
not
do
_
everything
_
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
he
should
do
*NL*
_
something
_
wrong
.
It
is
not
my
business
to
be
petitioning
the
Governor
or
*NL*
the
Legislature
any
more
than
it
is
theirs
to
petition
me
;
and
if
they
*NL*
should
not
hear
my
petition
,
what
should
I
do
then
?
But
in
this
case
the
*NL*
State
has
provided
no
way
;
its
very
Constitution
is
the
evil
.
This
may
*NL*
seem
to
be
harsh
and
stubborn
and
unconciliatory
;
but
it
is
to
treat
*NL*
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
consideration
the
only
spirit
that
can
*NL*
appreciate
or
deserves
it
.
So
is
an
change
for
the
better
,
like
birth
*NL*
and
death
which
convulse
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
,
that
those
who
call
themselves
Abolitionists
*NL*
should
at
once
effectually
withdraw
their
support
,
both
in
person
and
*NL*
property
,
from
the
government
of
Massachusetts
,
and
not
wait
till
they
*NL*
constitute
a
majority
of
one
,
before
they
suffer
the
right
to
prevail
*NL*
through
them
.
I
think
that
it
is
enough
if
they
have
God
on
their
side
,
*NL*
without
waiting
for
that
other
one
.
Moreover
,
any
man
more
right
than
*NL*
his
neighbors
constitutes
a
majority
of
one
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
meet
this
American
government
,
or
its
representative
,
the
State
*NL*
government
,
directly
,
and
face
to
face
,
once
a
year
--
no
more
--
in
*NL*
the
person
of
its
tax-gatherer
;
this
is
the
only
mode
in
which
a
man
*NL*
situated
as
I
am
necessarily
meets
it
;
and
it
then
says
distinctly
,
*NL*
Recognize
me
;
and
the
simplest
,
the
most
effectual
,
and
,
in
the
present
*NL*
posture
of
affairs
,
the
indispensablest
mode
of
treating
with
it
on
this
*NL*
head
,
of
expressing
your
little
satisfaction
with
and
love
for
it
,
is
*NL*
to
deny
it
then
.
My
civil
neighbor
,
the
tax-gatherer
,
is
the
very
man
I
*NL*
have
to
deal
with
--
for
it
is
,
after
all
,
with
men
and
not
with
parchment
*NL*
that
I
quarrel
--
and
he
has
voluntarily
chosen
to
be
an
agent
of
the
*NL*
government
.
How
shall
he
ever
know
well
what
he
is
and
does
as
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
government
,
or
as
a
man
,
until
he
is
obliged
to
consider
*NL*
whether
he
shall
treat
me
,
his
neighbor
,
for
whom
he
has
respect
,
as
*NL*
a
neighbor
and
well-disposed
man
,
or
as
a
maniac
and
disturber
of
the
*NL*
peace
,
and
see
if
he
can
get
over
this
obstruction
to
his
neighborliness
*NL*
without
a
ruder
and
more
impetuous
thought
or
speech
corresponding
with
*NL*
his
action
?
I
know
this
well
,
that
if
one
thousand
,
if
one
hundred
,
if
*NL*
ten
men
whom
I
could
name
--
if
ten
_
honest
_
men
only
--
ay
,
if
_
one
_
HONEST
*NL*
man
,
in
this
State
of
Massachusetts
,
_
ceasing
to
hold
slaves
_
,
were
*NL*
actually
to
withdraw
from
this
copartnership
,
and
be
locked
up
in
the
*NL*
county
jail
therefor
,
it
would
be
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
America
.
*NL*
For
it
matters
not
how
small
the
beginning
may
seem
to
be
:
what
is
once
*NL*
well
done
is
done
forever
.
But
we
love
better
to
talk
about
it
:
that
*NL*
we
say
is
our
mission
.
Reform
keeps
many
scores
of
newspapers
in
*NL*
its
service
,
but
not
one
man
.
If
my
esteemed
neighbor
,
the
State
's
*NL*
ambassador
,
who
will
devote
his
days
to
the
settlement
of
the
question
*NL*
of
human
rights
in
the
Council
Chamber
,
instead
of
being
threatened
with
*NL*
the
prisons
of
Carolina
,
were
to
sit
down
the
prisoner
of
Massachusetts
,
*NL*
that
State
which
is
so
anxious
to
foist
the
sin
of
slavery
upon
her
*NL*
sister
--
though
at
present
she
can
discover
only
an
act
of
inhospitality
*NL*
to
be
the
ground
of
a
quarrel
with
her
--
the
Legislature
would
not
wholly
*NL*
waive
the
subject
the
following
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
a
government
which
imprisons
any
unjustly
,
the
true
place
for
a
*NL*
just
man
is
also
a
prison
.
The
proper
place
to-day
,
the
only
place
which
*NL*
Massachusetts
has
provided
for
her
freer
and
less
desponding
spirits
,
*NL*
is
in
her
prisons
,
to
be
put
out
and
locked
out
of
the
State
by
her
own
*NL*
act
,
as
they
have
already
put
themselves
out
by
their
principles
.
It
is
*NL*
there
that
the
fugitive
slave
,
and
the
Mexican
prisoner
on
parole
,
and
*NL*
the
Indian
come
to
plead
the
wrongs
of
his
race
,
should
find
them
;
*NL*
on
that
separate
,
but
more
free
and
honorable
ground
,
where
the
State
*NL*
places
those
who
are
not
_
with
_
her
,
but
_
against
_
her
--
the
only
house
in
a
*NL*
slave
State
in
which
a
free
man
can
abide
with
honor
.
If
any
think
that
*NL*
their
influence
would
be
lost
there
,
and
their
voices
no
longer
afflict
*NL*
the
ear
of
the
State
,
that
they
would
not
be
as
an
enemy
within
its
*NL*
walls
,
they
do
not
know
by
how
much
truth
is
stronger
than
error
,
nor
*NL*
how
much
more
eloquently
and
effectively
he
can
combat
injustice
who
*NL*
has
experienced
a
little
in
his
own
person
.
Cast
your
whole
vote
,
not
a
*NL*
strip
of
paper
merely
,
but
your
whole
influence
.
A
minority
is
powerless
*NL*
while
it
conforms
to
the
majority
;
it
is
not
even
a
minority
then
;
but
*NL*
it
is
irresistible
when
it
clogs
by
its
whole
weight
.
If
the
alternative
*NL*
is
to
keep
all
just
men
in
prison
,
or
give
up
war
and
slavery
,
the
State
*NL*
will
not
hesitate
which
to
choose
.
If
a
thousand
men
were
not
to
pay
*NL*
their
tax-bills
this
year
,
that
would
not
be
a
violent
and
bloody
*NL*
measure
,
as
it
would
be
to
pay
them
,
and
enable
the
State
to
commit
*NL*
violence
and
shed
innocent
blood
.
This
is
,
in
fact
,
the
definition
of
a
*NL*
peaceable
revolution
,
if
any
such
is
possible
.
If
the
tax-gatherer
,
or
*NL*
any
other
public
officer
,
asks
me
,
as
one
has
done
,
``
But
what
shall
*NL*
I
do
?
''
my
answer
is
,
``
If
you
really
wish
to
do
anything
,
resign
your
*NL*
office
.
''
When
the
subject
has
refused
allegiance
,
and
the
officer
has
*NL*
resigned
his
office
,
then
the
revolution
is
accomplished
.
But
even
*NL*
suppose
blood
should
flow
.
Is
there
not
a
sort
of
blood
shed
when
the
*NL*
conscience
is
wounded
?
Through
this
wound
a
man
's
real
manhood
and
*NL*
immortality
flow
out
,
and
he
bleeds
to
an
everlasting
death
.
I
see
this
*NL*
blood
flowing
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
contemplated
the
imprisonment
of
the
offender
,
rather
than
the
*NL*
seizure
of
his
goods
--
though
both
will
serve
the
same
purpose
--
because
*NL*
they
who
assert
the
purest
right
,
and
consequently
are
most
dangerous
*NL*
to
a
corrupt
State
,
commonly
have
not
spent
much
time
in
accumulating
*NL*
property
.
To
such
the
State
renders
comparatively
small
service
,
and
*NL*
a
slight
tax
is
wont
to
appear
exorbitant
,
particularly
if
they
are
*NL*
obliged
to
earn
it
by
special
labor
with
their
hands
.
If
there
were
*NL*
one
who
lived
wholly
without
the
use
of
money
,
the
State
itself
*NL*
would
hesitate
to
demand
it
of
him
.
But
the
rich
man
--
not
to
make
any
*NL*
invidious
comparison
--
is
always
sold
to
the
institution
which
makes
him
*NL*
rich
.
Absolutely
speaking
,
the
more
money
,
the
less
virtue
;
for
money
*NL*
comes
between
a
man
and
his
objects
,
and
obtains
them
for
him
;
and
*NL*
it
was
certainly
no
great
virtue
to
obtain
it
.
It
puts
to
rest
many
*NL*
questions
which
he
would
otherwise
be
taxed
to
answer
;
while
the
only
*NL*
new
question
which
it
puts
is
the
hard
but
superfluous
one
,
how
to
*NL*
spend
it
.
Thus
his
moral
ground
is
taken
from
under
his
feet
.
The
*NL*
opportunities
of
living
are
diminished
in
proportion
as
what
are
called
*NL*
the
``
means
''
are
increased
.
The
best
thing
a
man
can
do
for
his
culture
*NL*
when
he
is
rich
is
to
endeavor
to
carry
out
those
schemes
which
he
*NL*
entertained
when
he
was
poor
.
Christ
answered
the
Herodians
according
to
*NL*
their
condition
.
``
Show
me
the
tribute-money
,
''
said
he
;
--
and
one
took
a
*NL*
penny
out
of
his
pocket
;
--
if
you
use
money
which
has
the
image
of
CA
|
sar
*NL*
on
it
,
and
which
he
has
made
current
and
valuable
,
that
is
,
_
if
you
*NL*
are
men
of
the
State
_
,
and
gladly
enjoy
the
advantages
of
CA
|
sar
's
*NL*
government
,
then
pay
him
back
some
of
his
own
when
he
demands
it
;
*NL*
``
Render
therefore
to
CA
|
sar
that
which
is
CA
|
sar
's
,
and
to
God
those
*NL*
things
which
are
God
's
''
--
leaving
them
no
wiser
than
before
as
to
which
*NL*
was
which
;
for
they
did
not
wish
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
converse
with
the
freest
of
my
neighbors
,
I
perceive
that
,
*NL*
whatever
they
may
say
about
the
magnitude
and
seriousness
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
their
regard
for
the
public
tranquillity
,
the
long
and
*NL*
the
short
of
the
matter
is
,
that
they
can
not
spare
the
protection
of
the
*NL*
existing
government
,
and
they
dread
the
consequences
to
their
property
*NL*
and
families
of
disobedience
to
it
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
should
not
like
*NL*
to
think
that
I
ever
rely
on
the
protection
of
the
State
.
But
,
if
I
deny
*NL*
the
authority
of
the
State
when
it
presents
its
tax-bill
,
it
will
soon
*NL*
take
and
waste
all
my
property
,
and
so
harass
me
and
my
children
without
*NL*
end
.
This
is
hard
.
This
makes
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
live
honestly
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
comfortably
in
outward
respects
.
It
will
not
be
*NL*
worth
the
while
to
accumulate
property
;
that
would
be
sure
to
go
again
.
*NL*
You
must
hire
or
squat
somewhere
,
and
raise
but
a
small
crop
,
and
eat
*NL*
that
soon
.
You
must
live
within
yourself
,
and
depend
upon
yourself
*NL*
always
tucked
up
and
ready
for
a
start
,
and
not
have
many
affairs
.
A
*NL*
man
may
grow
rich
in
Turkey
even
,
if
he
will
be
in
all
respects
a
*NL*
good
subject
of
the
Turkish
government
.
Confucius
said
,
``
If
a
state
is
*NL*
governed
by
the
principles
of
reason
,
poverty
and
misery
are
subjects
*NL*
of
shame
;
if
a
state
is
not
governed
by
the
principles
of
reason
,
riches
*NL*
and
honors
are
the
subjects
of
shame
.
''
No
:
until
I
want
the
protection
*NL*
of
Massachusetts
to
be
extended
to
me
in
some
distant
Southern
port
,
*NL*
where
my
liberty
is
endangered
,
or
until
I
am
bent
solely
on
building
*NL*
up
an
estate
at
home
by
peaceful
enterprise
,
I
can
afford
to
refuse
*NL*
allegiance
to
Massachusetts
,
and
her
right
to
my
property
and
life
.
It
*NL*
costs
me
less
in
every
sense
to
incur
the
penalty
of
disobedience
to
the
*NL*
State
than
it
would
to
obey
.
I
should
feel
as
if
I
were
worth
less
in
*NL*
that
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
years
ago
,
the
State
met
me
in
behalf
of
the
Church
,
and
commanded
*NL*
me
to
pay
a
certain
sum
toward
the
support
of
a
clergyman
whose
*NL*
preaching
my
father
attended
,
but
never
I
myself
.
``
Pay
,
''
it
said
,
``
or
be
*NL*
locked
up
in
the
jail
.
''
I
declined
to
pay
.
But
,
unfortunately
,
another
*NL*
man
saw
fit
to
pay
it
.
I
did
not
see
why
the
schoolmaster
should
be
*NL*
taxed
to
support
the
priest
,
and
not
the
priest
the
schoolmaster
:
for
*NL*
I
was
not
the
State
's
schoolmaster
,
but
I
supported
myself
by
voluntary
*NL*
subscription
.
I
did
not
see
why
the
lyceum
should
not
present
its
*NL*
tax-bill
,
and
have
the
State
to
back
its
demand
,
as
well
as
the
Church
.
*NL*
However
,
at
the
request
of
the
selectmen
,
I
condescended
to
make
some
*NL*
such
statement
as
this
in
writing
:
--
``
Know
all
men
by
these
presents
,
*NL*
that
I
,
Henry
Thoreau
,
do
not
wish
to
be
regarded
as
a
member
of
any
*NL*
incorporated
society
which
I
have
not
joined
.
''
This
I
gave
to
the
town
*NL*
clerk
;
and
he
has
it
.
The
State
,
having
thus
learned
that
I
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
be
regarded
as
a
member
of
that
church
,
has
never
made
a
like
*NL*
demand
on
me
since
;
though
it
said
that
it
must
adhere
to
its
original
*NL*
presumption
that
time
.
If
I
had
known
how
to
name
them
,
I
should
then
*NL*
have
signed
off
in
detail
from
all
the
societies
which
I
never
signed
on
*NL*
to
;
but
I
did
not
know
where
to
find
a
complete
list
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
paid
no
poll-tax
for
six
years
.
I
was
put
into
a
jail
once
on
*NL*
this
account
,
for
one
night
;
and
,
as
I
stood
considering
the
walls
of
*NL*
solid
stone
,
two
or
three
feet
thick
,
the
door
of
wood
and
iron
,
a
foot
*NL*
thick
,
and
the
iron
grating
which
strained
the
light
,
I
could
not
help
*NL*
being
struck
with
the
foolishness
of
that
institution
which
treated
me
*NL*
as
if
I
were
mere
flesh
and
blood
and
bones
,
to
be
locked
up
.
I
wondered
*NL*
that
it
should
have
concluded
at
length
that
this
was
the
best
use
it
*NL*
could
put
me
to
,
and
had
never
thought
to
avail
itself
of
my
services
*NL*
in
some
way
.
I
saw
that
,
if
there
was
a
wall
of
stone
between
me
and
*NL*
my
townsmen
,
there
was
a
still
more
difficult
one
to
climb
or
break
*NL*
through
,
before
they
could
get
to
be
as
free
as
I
was
.
I
did
not
for
a
*NL*
moment
feel
confined
,
and
the
walls
seemed
a
great
waste
of
stone
and
*NL*
mortar
.
I
felt
as
if
I
alone
of
all
my
townsmen
had
paid
my
tax
.
They
*NL*
plainly
did
not
know
how
to
treat
me
,
but
behaved
like
persons
who
are
*NL*
underbred
.
In
every
threat
and
in
every
compliment
there
was
a
blunder
;
*NL*
for
they
thought
that
my
chief
desire
was
to
stand
the
other
side
of
*NL*
that
stone
wall
.
I
could
not
but
smile
to
see
how
industriously
they
*NL*
locked
the
door
on
my
meditations
,
which
followed
them
out
again
without
*NL*
let
or
hindrance
,
and
_
they
_
were
really
all
that
was
dangerous
.
As
they
*NL*
could
not
reach
me
,
they
had
resolved
to
punish
my
body
;
just
as
boys
,
*NL*
if
they
can
not
come
at
some
person
against
whom
they
have
a
spite
,
will
*NL*
abuse
his
dog
.
I
saw
that
the
State
was
half-witted
,
that
it
was
timid
*NL*
as
a
lone
woman
with
her
silver
spoons
,
and
that
it
did
not
know
its
*NL*
friends
from
its
foes
,
and
I
lost
all
my
remaining
respect
for
it
,
and
*NL*
pitied
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
State
never
intentionally
confronts
a
man
's
sense
,
intellectual
*NL*
or
moral
,
but
only
his
body
,
his
senses
.
It
is
not
armed
with
superior
*NL*
wit
or
honesty
,
but
with
superior
physical
strength
.
I
was
not
born
to
*NL*
be
forced
.
I
will
breathe
after
my
own
fashion
.
Let
us
see
who
is
the
*NL*
strongest
.
What
force
has
a
multitude
?
They
only
can
force
me
who
obey
a
*NL*
higher
law
than
I
.
They
force
me
to
become
like
themselves
.
I
do
not
*NL*
hear
of
_
men
_
being
_
forced
_
to
have
this
way
or
that
by
masses
of
men
.
*NL*
What
sort
of
life
were
that
to
live
?
When
I
meet
a
government
which
says
*NL*
to
me
,
``
Your
money
or
your
life
,
''
why
should
I
be
in
haste
to
give
it
my
*NL*
money
?
It
may
be
in
a
great
strait
,
and
not
know
what
to
do
:
I
can
not
*NL*
help
that
.
It
must
help
itself
;
do
as
I
do
.
It
is
not
worth
the
while
to
*NL*
snivel
about
it
.
I
am
not
responsible
for
the
successful
working
of
the
*NL*
machinery
of
society
.
I
am
not
the
son
of
the
engineer
.
I
perceive
that
,
*NL*
when
an
acorn
and
a
chestnut
fall
side
by
side
,
the
one
does
not
remain
*NL*
inert
to
make
way
for
the
other
,
but
both
obey
their
own
laws
,
and
*NL*
spring
and
grow
and
flourish
as
best
they
can
,
till
one
,
perchance
,
*NL*
overshadows
and
destroys
the
other
.
If
a
plant
can
not
live
according
to
*NL*
its
nature
,
it
dies
;
and
so
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
in
prison
was
novel
and
interesting
enough
.
The
prisoners
*NL*
in
their
shirt-sleeves
were
enjoying
a
chat
and
the
evening
air
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
when
I
entered
.
But
the
jailer
said
,
``
Come
,
boys
,
it
is
time
*NL*
to
lock
up
''
;
and
so
they
dispersed
,
and
I
heard
the
sound
of
their
steps
*NL*
returning
into
the
hollow
apartments
.
My
room-mate
was
introduced
to
me
*NL*
by
the
jailer
as
``
a
first-rate
fellow
and
a
clever
man
.
''
When
the
*NL*
door
was
locked
,
he
showed
me
where
to
hang
my
hat
,
and
how
he
managed
*NL*
matters
there
.
The
rooms
were
whitewashed
once
a
month
;
and
this
one
,
at
*NL*
least
,
was
the
whitest
,
most
simply
furnished
,
and
probably
the
neatest
*NL*
apartment
in
the
town
.
He
naturally
wanted
to
know
where
I
came
from
,
*NL*
and
what
brought
me
there
;
and
,
when
I
had
told
him
,
I
asked
him
in
my
*NL*
turn
how
he
came
there
,
presuming
him
to
be
an
honest
man
,
of
course
;
*NL*
and
,
as
the
world
goes
,
I
believe
he
was
.
``
Why
,
''
said
he
,
``
they
accuse
*NL*
me
of
burning
a
barn
;
but
I
never
did
it
.
''
As
near
as
I
could
discover
,
*NL*
he
had
probably
gone
to
bed
in
a
barn
when
drunk
,
and
smoked
his
pipe
*NL*
there
;
and
so
a
barn
was
burnt
.
He
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
clever
*NL*
man
,
had
been
there
some
three
months
waiting
for
his
trial
to
come
on
,
*NL*
and
would
have
to
wait
as
much
longer
;
but
he
was
quite
domesticated
and
*NL*
contented
,
since
he
got
his
board
for
nothing
,
and
thought
that
he
was
*NL*
well
treated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
occupied
one
window
,
and
I
the
other
;
and
I
saw
that
if
one
stayed
*NL*
there
long
,
his
principal
business
would
be
to
look
out
the
window
.
I
*NL*
had
soon
read
all
the
tracts
that
were
left
there
,
and
examined
where
*NL*
former
prisoners
had
broken
out
,
and
where
a
grate
had
been
sawed
off
,
*NL*
and
heard
the
history
of
the
various
occupants
of
that
room
;
for
I
found
*NL*
that
even
here
there
was
a
history
and
a
gossip
which
never
circulated
*NL*
beyond
the
walls
of
the
jail
.
Probably
this
is
the
only
house
in
*NL*
the
town
where
verses
are
composed
,
which
are
afterward
printed
in
*NL*
a
circular
form
,
but
not
published
.
I
was
shown
quite
a
long
list
of
*NL*
verses
which
were
composed
by
some
young
men
who
had
been
detected
in
an
*NL*
attempt
to
escape
,
who
avenged
themselves
by
singing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pumped
my
fellow-prisoner
as
dry
as
I
could
,
for
fear
I
should
never
*NL*
see
him
again
;
but
at
length
he
showed
me
which
was
my
bed
,
and
left
me
*NL*
to
blow
out
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
travelling
into
a
far
country
,
such
as
I
had
never
expected
*NL*
to
behold
,
to
lie
there
for
one
night
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
never
*NL*
had
heard
the
town-clock
strike
before
,
nor
the
evening
sounds
of
the
*NL*
village
;
for
we
slept
with
the
windows
open
,
which
were
inside
the
*NL*
grating
.
It
was
to
see
my
native
village
in
the
light
of
the
Middle
*NL*
Ages
,
and
our
Concord
was
turned
into
a
Rhine
stream
,
and
visions
*NL*
of
knights
and
castles
passed
before
me
.
They
were
the
voices
of
old
*NL*
burghers
that
I
heard
in
the
streets
.
I
was
an
involuntary
spectator
*NL*
and
auditor
of
whatever
was
done
and
said
in
the
kitchen
of
the
adjacent
*NL*
village-inn
--
a
wholly
new
and
rare
experience
to
me
.
It
was
a
closer
*NL*
view
of
my
native
town
.
I
was
fairly
inside
of
it
.
I
never
had
seen
its
*NL*
institutions
before
.
This
is
one
of
its
peculiar
institutions
;
for
it
is
*NL*
a
shire
town
.
I
began
to
comprehend
what
its
inhabitants
were
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
our
breakfasts
were
put
through
the
hole
in
the
door
,
*NL*
in
small
oblong-square
tin
pans
,
made
to
fit
,
and
holding
a
pint
of
*NL*
chocolate
,
with
brown
bread
,
and
an
iron
spoon
.
When
they
called
for
the
*NL*
vessels
again
,
I
was
green
enough
to
return
what
bread
I
had
left
;
but
*NL*
my
comrade
seized
it
,
and
said
that
I
should
lay
that
up
for
lunch
or
*NL*
dinner
.
Soon
after
he
was
let
out
to
work
at
haying
in
a
neighboring
*NL*
field
,
whither
he
went
every
day
,
and
would
not
be
back
till
noon
;
so
he
*NL*
bade
me
good-day
,
saying
that
he
doubted
if
he
should
see
me
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
out
of
prison
--
for
some
one
interfered
,
and
paid
that
tax
--
I
*NL*
did
not
perceive
that
great
changes
had
taken
place
on
the
common
,
*NL*
such
as
he
observed
who
went
in
a
youth
and
emerged
a
tottering
*NL*
and
gray-headed
man
;
and
yet
a
change
had
to
my
eyes
come
over
the
*NL*
scene
--
the
town
,
and
State
,
and
country
--
greater
than
any
that
mere
time
*NL*
could
effect
.
I
saw
yet
more
distinctly
the
State
in
which
I
lived
.
I
*NL*
saw
to
what
extent
the
people
among
whom
I
lived
could
be
trusted
as
*NL*
good
neighbors
and
friends
;
that
their
friendship
was
for
summer
weather
*NL*
only
;
that
they
did
not
greatly
propose
to
do
right
;
that
they
were
*NL*
a
distinct
race
from
me
by
their
prejudices
and
superstitions
,
as
the
*NL*
Chinamen
and
Malays
are
;
that
in
their
sacrifices
to
humanity
,
they
ran
*NL*
no
risks
,
not
even
to
their
property
;
that
after
all
they
were
not
so
*NL*
noble
but
they
treated
the
thief
as
he
had
treated
them
,
and
hoped
,
by
*NL*
a
certain
outward
observance
and
a
few
prayers
,
and
by
walking
in
a
*NL*
particular
straight
though
useless
path
from
time
to
time
,
to
save
their
*NL*
souls
.
This
may
be
to
judge
my
neighbors
harshly
;
for
I
believe
that
*NL*
many
of
them
are
not
aware
that
they
have
such
an
institution
as
the
*NL*
jail
in
their
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
formerly
the
custom
in
our
village
,
when
a
poor
debtor
came
out
*NL*
of
jail
,
for
his
acquaintances
to
salute
him
,
looking
through
their
*NL*
fingers
,
which
were
crossed
to
represent
the
grating
of
a
jail
window
,
*NL*
``
How
do
ye
do
?
''
My
neighbors
did
not
thus
salute
me
,
but
first
looked
at
*NL*
me
,
and
then
at
one
another
,
as
if
I
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
.
I
*NL*
was
put
into
jail
as
I
was
going
to
the
shoemaker
's
to
get
a
shoe
which
*NL*
was
mended
.
When
I
was
let
out
the
next
morning
,
I
proceeded
to
finish
*NL*
my
errand
,
and
,
having
put
on
my
mended
shoe
,
joined
a
huckleberry
*NL*
party
,
who
were
impatient
to
put
themselves
under
my
conduct
;
and
in
*NL*
half
an
hour
--
for
the
horse
was
soon
tackled
--
was
in
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
huckleberry
field
,
on
one
of
our
highest
hills
,
two
miles
off
,
and
then
*NL*
the
State
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
whole
history
of
``
My
Prisons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
declined
paying
the
highway
tax
,
because
I
am
as
desirous
*NL*
of
being
a
good
neighbor
as
I
am
of
being
a
bad
subject
;
and
as
for
*NL*
supporting
schools
,
I
am
doing
my
part
to
educate
my
fellow-countrymen
*NL*
now
.
It
is
for
no
particular
item
in
the
tax-bill
that
I
refuse
to
pay
*NL*
it
.
I
simply
wish
to
refuse
allegiance
to
the
State
,
to
withdraw
and
*NL*
stand
aloof
from
it
effectually
.
I
do
not
care
to
trace
the
course
of
*NL*
my
dollar
,
if
I
could
,
till
it
buys
a
man
or
a
musket
to
shoot
one
*NL*
with
--
the
dollar
is
innocent
--
but
I
am
concerned
to
trace
the
effects
of
*NL*
my
allegiance
.
In
fact
,
I
quietly
declare
war
with
the
State
,
after
my
*NL*
fashion
,
though
I
will
still
make
what
use
and
get
what
advantage
of
her
*NL*
I
can
,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
others
pay
the
tax
which
is
demanded
of
me
,
from
a
sympathy
with
the
*NL*
State
,
they
do
but
what
they
have
already
done
in
their
own
case
,
or
*NL*
rather
they
abet
injustice
to
a
greater
extent
than
the
State
requires
.
*NL*
If
they
pay
the
tax
from
a
mistaken
interest
in
the
individual
taxed
,
to
*NL*
save
his
property
,
or
prevent
his
going
to
jail
,
it
is
because
they
have
*NL*
not
considered
wisely
how
far
they
let
their
private
feelings
interfere
*NL*
with
the
public
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
is
my
position
at
present
.
But
one
can
not
be
too
much
on
his
*NL*
guard
in
such
a
case
,
lest
his
action
be
biased
by
obstinacy
or
an
*NL*
undue
regard
for
the
opinions
of
men
.
Let
him
see
that
he
does
only
what
*NL*
belongs
to
himself
and
to
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
sometimes
,
Why
,
this
people
mean
well
;
they
are
only
ignorant
;
*NL*
they
would
do
better
if
they
knew
how
:
why
give
your
neighbors
this
pain
*NL*
to
treat
you
as
they
are
not
inclined
to
?
But
I
think
,
again
,
This
is
*NL*
no
reason
why
I
should
do
as
they
do
,
or
permit
others
to
suffer
much
*NL*
greater
pain
of
a
different
kind
.
Again
,
I
sometimes
say
to
myself
,
When
*NL*
many
millions
of
men
,
without
heat
,
without
ill-will
,
without
personal
*NL*
feeling
of
any
kind
,
demand
of
you
a
few
shillings
only
,
without
the
*NL*
possibility
,
such
is
their
constitution
,
of
retracting
or
altering
their
*NL*
present
demand
,
and
without
the
possibility
,
on
your
side
,
of
appeal
*NL*
to
any
other
millions
,
why
expose
yourself
to
this
overwhelming
brute
*NL*
force
?
You
do
not
resist
cold
and
hunger
,
the
winds
and
the
waves
,
thus
*NL*
obstinately
;
you
quietly
submit
to
a
thousand
similar
necessities
.
You
*NL*
do
not
put
your
head
into
the
fire
.
But
just
in
proportion
as
I
regard
*NL*
this
as
not
wholly
a
brute
force
,
but
partly
a
human
force
,
and
consider
*NL*
that
I
have
relations
to
those
millions
as
to
so
many
millions
of
*NL*
men
,
and
not
of
mere
brute
or
inanimate
things
,
I
see
that
appeal
is
*NL*
possible
,
first
and
instantaneously
,
from
them
to
the
Maker
of
*NL*
them
,
and
,
secondly
,
from
them
to
themselves
.
But
,
if
I
put
my
head
*NL*
deliberately
into
the
fire
,
there
is
no
appeal
to
fire
or
to
the
Maker
*NL*
of
fire
,
and
I
have
only
myself
to
blame
.
If
I
could
convince
myself
*NL*
that
I
have
any
right
to
be
satisfied
with
men
as
they
are
,
and
to
*NL*
treat
them
accordingly
,
and
not
according
,
in
some
respects
,
to
my
*NL*
requisitions
and
expectations
of
what
they
and
I
ought
to
be
,
then
,
like
*NL*
a
good
Mussulman
and
fatalist
,
I
should
endeavor
to
be
satisfied
with
*NL*
things
as
they
are
,
and
say
it
is
the
will
of
God
.
And
,
above
all
,
there
*NL*
is
this
difference
between
resisting
this
and
a
purely
brute
or
natural
*NL*
force
,
that
I
can
resist
this
with
some
effect
;
but
I
can
not
expect
,
*NL*
like
Orpheus
,
to
change
the
nature
of
the
rocks
and
trees
and
beasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
any
man
or
nation
.
I
do
not
wish
to
split
*NL*
hairs
,
to
make
fine
distinctions
,
or
set
myself
up
as
better
than
my
*NL*
neighbors
.
I
seek
rather
,
I
may
say
,
even
an
excuse
for
conforming
to
*NL*
the
laws
of
the
land
.
I
am
but
too
ready
to
conform
to
them
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
I
have
reason
to
suspect
myself
on
this
head
;
and
each
year
,
as
the
*NL*
tax-gatherer
comes
round
,
I
find
myself
disposed
to
review
the
acts
and
*NL*
position
of
the
general
and
State
governments
,
and
the
spirit
of
the
*NL*
people
,
to
discover
a
pretext
for
conformity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
affect
our
country
as
our
parents
,
*NL*
And
if
at
any
time
we
alienate
*NL*
Our
love
or
industry
from
doing
it
honor
,
*NL*
We
must
respect
effects
and
teach
the
soul
*NL*
Matter
of
conscience
and
religion
,
*NL*
And
not
desire
of
rule
or
benefit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
that
the
State
will
soon
be
able
to
take
all
my
work
of
this
*NL*
sort
out
of
my
hands
,
and
then
I
shall
be
no
better
a
patriot
than
my
*NL*
fellow-countrymen
.
Seen
from
a
lower
point
of
view
,
the
Constitution
,
*NL*
with
all
its
faults
,
is
very
good
;
the
law
and
the
courts
are
very
*NL*
respectable
;
even
this
State
and
this
American
government
are
,
in
many
*NL*
respects
,
very
admirable
and
rare
things
,
to
be
thankful
for
,
such
as
a
*NL*
great
many
have
described
them
;
but
seen
from
a
point
of
view
a
little
*NL*
higher
,
they
are
what
I
have
described
them
;
seen
from
a
higher
still
,
*NL*
and
the
highest
,
who
shall
say
what
they
are
,
or
that
they
are
worth
*NL*
looking
at
or
thinking
of
at
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
government
does
not
concern
me
much
,
and
I
shall
bestow
the
*NL*
fewest
possible
thoughts
on
it
.
It
is
not
many
moments
that
I
live
under
*NL*
a
government
,
even
in
this
world
.
If
a
man
is
thought-free
,
fancy-free
,
*NL*
imagination-free
,
that
which
_
is
not
_
never
for
a
long
time
appearing
_
to
*NL*
be
_
to
him
,
unwise
rulers
or
reformers
can
not
fatally
interrupt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
that
most
men
think
differently
from
myself
;
but
those
whose
*NL*
lives
are
by
profession
devoted
to
the
study
of
these
or
kindred
*NL*
subjects
,
content
me
as
little
as
any
.
Statesmen
and
legislators
,
*NL*
standing
so
completely
within
the
institution
,
never
distinctly
*NL*
and
nakedly
behold
it
.
They
speak
of
moving
society
,
but
have
no
*NL*
resting-place
without
it
.
They
may
be
men
of
a
certain
experience
and
*NL*
discrimination
,
and
have
no
doubt
invented
ingenious
and
even
useful
*NL*
systems
,
for
which
we
sincerely
thank
them
;
but
all
their
wit
and
*NL*
usefulness
lie
within
certain
not
very
wide
limits
.
They
are
wont
to
*NL*
forget
that
the
world
is
not
governed
by
policy
and
expediency
.
Webster
*NL*
never
goes
behind
government
,
and
so
can
not
speak
with
authority
*NL*
about
it
.
His
words
are
wisdom
to
those
legislators
who
contemplate
no
*NL*
essential
reform
in
the
existing
government
;
but
for
thinkers
,
and
those
*NL*
who
legislate
for
all
time
,
he
never
once
glances
at
the
subject
.
I
know
*NL*
of
those
whose
serene
and
wise
speculations
on
this
theme
would
soon
*NL*
reveal
the
limits
of
his
mind
's
range
and
hospitality
.
Yet
,
compared
*NL*
with
the
cheap
professions
of
most
reformers
,
and
the
still
cheaper
*NL*
wisdom
and
eloquence
of
politicians
in
general
,
his
are
almost
the
only
*NL*
sensible
and
valuable
words
,
and
we
thank
Heaven
for
him
.
Comparatively
,
*NL*
he
is
always
strong
,
original
,
and
,
above
all
,
practical
.
Still
,
his
*NL*
quality
is
not
wisdom
,
but
prudence
.
The
lawyer
's
truth
is
not
truth
,
*NL*
but
consistency
or
a
consistent
expediency
.
Truth
is
always
in
harmony
*NL*
with
herself
,
and
is
not
concerned
chiefly
to
reveal
the
justice
that
*NL*
may
consist
with
wrong-doing
.
He
well
deserves
to
be
called
,
as
he
has
*NL*
been
called
,
the
Defender
of
the
Constitution
.
There
are
really
no
*NL*
blows
to
be
given
by
him
but
defensive
ones
.
He
is
not
a
leader
,
but
a
*NL*
follower
.
His
leaders
are
the
men
of
'
87
.
``
I
have
never
made
an
effort
,
''
*NL*
he
says
,
``
and
never
propose
to
make
an
effort
;
I
have
never
countenanced
*NL*
an
effort
,
and
never
mean
to
countenance
an
effort
,
to
disturb
the
*NL*
arrangement
as
originally
made
,
by
which
the
various
States
came
into
*NL*
the
Union
.
''
Still
thinking
of
the
sanction
which
the
Constitution
gives
*NL*
to
slavery
,
he
says
,
``
Because
it
was
a
part
of
the
original
compact
--
let
*NL*
it
stand
.
''
Notwithstanding
his
special
acuteness
and
ability
,
he
is
*NL*
unable
to
take
a
fact
out
of
its
merely
political
relations
,
and
behold
*NL*
it
as
it
lies
absolutely
to
be
disposed
of
by
the
intellect
--
what
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
it
behooves
a
man
to
do
here
in
America
to-day
with
regard
to
*NL*
slavery
,
but
ventures
,
or
is
driven
,
to
make
some
such
desperate
answer
*NL*
as
the
following
,
while
professing
to
speak
absolutely
,
and
as
a
private
*NL*
man
--
from
which
what
new
and
singular
code
of
social
duties
might
be
*NL*
inferred
?
``
The
manner
,
''
says
he
,
``
in
which
the
governments
of
those
*NL*
States
where
slavery
exists
are
to
regulate
it
is
for
their
own
*NL*
consideration
,
under
their
responsibility
to
their
constituents
,
to
*NL*
the
general
laws
of
propriety
,
humanity
,
and
justice
,
and
to
God
.
*NL*
Associations
formed
elsewhere
,
springing
from
a
feeling
of
humanity
,
or
*NL*
any
other
cause
,
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
.
They
have
never
*NL*
received
any
encouragement
from
me
,
and
they
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
who
know
of
no
purer
sources
of
truth
,
who
have
traced
up
its
*NL*
stream
no
higher
,
stand
,
and
wisely
stand
,
by
the
Bible
and
the
*NL*
Constitution
,
and
drink
at
it
there
with
reverence
and
humility
;
but
*NL*
they
who
behold
where
it
comes
trickling
into
this
lake
or
that
pool
,
*NL*
gird
up
their
loins
once
more
,
and
continue
their
pilgrimage
toward
its
*NL*
fountain-head
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
man
with
a
genius
for
legislation
has
appeared
in
America
.
They
are
*NL*
rare
in
the
history
of
the
world
.
There
are
orators
,
politicians
,
and
*NL*
eloquent
men
,
by
the
thousand
;
but
the
speaker
has
not
yet
opened
his
*NL*
mouth
to
speak
who
is
capable
of
settling
the
much-vexed
questions
of
*NL*
the
day
.
We
love
eloquence
for
its
own
sake
,
and
not
for
any
truth
which
*NL*
it
may
utter
,
or
any
heroism
it
may
inspire
.
Our
legislators
have
not
*NL*
yet
learned
the
comparative
value
of
free-trade
and
of
freedom
,
of
*NL*
union
,
and
of
rectitude
,
to
a
nation
.
They
have
no
genius
or
talent
for
*NL*
comparatively
humble
questions
of
taxation
and
finance
,
commerce
and
*NL*
manufacturers
and
agriculture
.
If
we
were
left
solely
to
the
wordy
*NL*
wit
of
legislators
in
Congress
for
our
guidance
,
uncorrected
by
the
*NL*
seasonable
experience
and
the
effectual
complaints
of
the
people
,
*NL*
America
would
not
long
retain
her
rank
among
the
nations
.
For
eighteen
*NL*
hundred
years
,
though
perchance
I
have
no
right
to
say
it
,
the
New
*NL*
Testament
has
been
written
;
yet
where
is
the
legislator
who
has
wisdom
*NL*
and
practical
talent
enough
to
avail
himself
of
the
light
which
it
sheds
*NL*
on
the
science
of
legislation
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
authority
of
government
,
even
such
as
I
am
willing
to
submit
to
--
for
*NL*
I
will
cheerfully
obey
those
who
know
and
can
do
better
than
I
,
and
in
*NL*
many
things
even
those
who
neither
know
nor
can
do
so
well
--
is
still
an
*NL*
impure
one
:
to
be
strictly
just
,
it
must
have
the
sanction
and
consent
*NL*
of
the
governed
.
It
can
have
no
pure
right
over
my
person
and
property
*NL*
but
what
I
concede
to
it
.
The
progress
from
an
absolute
to
a
limited
*NL*
monarchy
,
from
a
limited
monarchy
to
a
democracy
,
is
a
progress
toward
*NL*
a
true
respect
for
the
individual
.
Even
the
Chinese
philosopher
was
*NL*
wise
enough
to
regard
the
individual
as
the
basis
of
the
empire
.
Is
*NL*
a
democracy
,
such
as
we
know
it
,
the
last
improvement
possible
*NL*
in
government
?
Is
it
not
possible
to
take
a
step
further
towards
*NL*
recognizing
and
organizing
the
rights
of
man
?
There
will
never
be
a
*NL*
really
free
and
enlightened
State
until
the
State
comes
to
recognize
*NL*
the
individual
as
a
higher
and
independent
power
,
from
which
all
its
own
*NL*
power
and
authority
are
derived
,
and
treats
him
accordingly
.
I
please
*NL*
myself
with
imagining
a
State
at
least
which
can
afford
to
be
just
to
*NL*
all
men
,
and
to
treat
the
individual
with
respect
as
a
neighbor
;
which
*NL*
even
would
not
think
it
inconsistent
with
its
own
repose
if
a
few
were
*NL*
to
live
aloof
from
it
,
not
meddling
with
it
,
nor
embraced
by
it
,
who
*NL*
fulfilled
all
the
duties
of
neighbors
and
fellow-men
.
A
State
which
bore
*NL*
this
kind
of
fruit
,
and
suffered
it
to
drop
off
as
fast
as
it
ripened
,
*NL*
would
prepare
the
way
for
a
still
more
perfect
and
glorious
State
,
which
*NL*
also
I
have
imagined
,
but
not
yet
anywhere
seen
.
