CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Prince
,
so
Genoa
and
Lucca
are
now
just
family
estates
of
the
*NL*
Buonapartes
.
But
I
warn
you
,
if
you
do
n't
tell
me
that
this
means
war
,
*NL*
if
you
still
try
to
defend
the
infamies
and
horrors
perpetrated
by
that
*NL*
Antichrist
--
I
really
believe
he
is
Antichrist
--
I
will
have
nothing
more
*NL*
to
do
with
you
and
you
are
no
longer
my
friend
,
no
longer
my
`
faithful
*NL*
slave
,
'
as
you
call
yourself
!
But
how
do
you
do
?
I
see
I
have
frightened
*NL*
you
--
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
July
,
1805
,
and
the
speaker
was
the
well-known
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
Scherer
,
maid
of
honor
and
favorite
of
the
Empress
Marya
Fedorovna
.
With
*NL*
these
words
she
greeted
Prince
Vasili
Kuragin
,
a
man
of
high
rank
and
*NL*
importance
,
who
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
her
reception
.
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
had
had
a
cough
for
some
days
.
She
was
,
as
she
said
,
suffering
from
la
*NL*
grippe
;
grippe
being
then
a
new
word
in
St.
Petersburg
,
used
only
by
the
*NL*
elite
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
invitations
without
exception
,
written
in
French
,
and
delivered
*NL*
by
a
scarlet-liveried
footman
that
morning
,
ran
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
,
Count
-LRB-
or
Prince
-RRB-
,
and
if
the
*NL*
prospect
of
spending
an
evening
with
a
poor
invalid
is
not
too
terrible
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
very
charmed
to
see
you
tonight
between
7
and
10
--
Annette
*NL*
Scherer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
!
what
a
virulent
attack
!
''
replied
the
prince
,
not
in
the
least
*NL*
disconcerted
by
this
reception
.
He
had
just
entered
,
wearing
an
*NL*
embroidered
court
uniform
,
knee
breeches
,
and
shoes
,
and
had
stars
on
*NL*
his
breast
and
a
serene
expression
on
his
flat
face
.
He
spoke
in
that
*NL*
refined
French
in
which
our
grandfathers
not
only
spoke
but
thought
,
and
*NL*
with
the
gentle
,
patronizing
intonation
natural
to
a
man
of
importance
*NL*
who
had
grown
old
in
society
and
at
court
.
He
went
up
to
Anna
Pavlovna
,
*NL*
kissed
her
hand
,
presenting
to
her
his
bald
,
scented
,
and
shining
head
,
*NL*
and
complacently
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
dear
friend
,
tell
me
how
you
are
.
Set
your
friend
's
mind
*NL*
at
rest
,
''
said
he
without
altering
his
tone
,
beneath
the
politeness
and
*NL*
affected
sympathy
of
which
indifference
and
even
irony
could
be
*NL*
discerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
one
be
well
while
suffering
morally
?
Can
one
be
calm
in
times
like
*NL*
these
if
one
has
any
feeling
?
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
.
``
You
are
staying
the
*NL*
whole
evening
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
fete
at
the
English
ambassador
's
?
Today
is
Wednesday
.
I
must
*NL*
put
in
an
appearance
there
,
''
said
the
prince
.
``
My
daughter
is
coming
for
*NL*
me
to
take
me
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
today
's
fete
had
been
canceled
.
I
confess
all
these
*NL*
festivities
and
fireworks
are
becoming
wearisome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
had
known
that
you
wished
it
,
the
entertainment
would
have
been
*NL*
put
off
,
''
said
the
prince
,
who
,
like
a
wound-up
clock
,
by
force
of
habit
*NL*
said
things
he
did
not
even
wish
to
be
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tease
!
Well
,
and
what
has
been
decided
about
Novosiltsev
's
*NL*
dispatch
?
You
know
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
one
say
about
it
?
''
replied
the
prince
in
a
cold
,
listless
*NL*
tone
.
``
What
has
been
decided
?
They
have
decided
that
Buonaparte
has
*NL*
burnt
his
boats
,
and
I
believe
that
we
are
ready
to
burn
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
always
spoke
languidly
,
like
an
actor
repeating
a
stale
*NL*
part
.
Anna
Pavlovna
Scherer
on
the
contrary
,
despite
her
forty
years
,
*NL*
overflowed
with
animation
and
impulsiveness
.
To
be
an
enthusiast
had
*NL*
become
her
social
vocation
and
,
sometimes
even
when
she
did
not
feel
*NL*
like
it
,
she
became
enthusiastic
in
order
not
to
disappoint
the
*NL*
expectations
of
those
who
knew
her
.
The
subdued
smile
which
,
though
it
*NL*
did
not
suit
her
faded
features
,
always
played
round
her
lips
expressed
,
*NL*
as
in
a
spoiled
child
,
a
continual
consciousness
of
her
charming
defect
,
*NL*
which
she
neither
wished
,
nor
could
,
nor
considered
it
necessary
,
to
*NL*
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
a
conversation
on
political
matters
Anna
Pavlovna
burst
*NL*
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
speak
to
me
of
Austria
.
Perhaps
I
do
n't
understand
things
,
*NL*
but
Austria
never
has
wished
,
and
does
not
wish
,
for
war
.
She
is
*NL*
betraying
us
!
Russia
alone
must
save
Europe
.
Our
gracious
sovereign
*NL*
recognizes
his
high
vocation
and
will
be
true
to
it
.
That
is
the
one
*NL*
thing
I
have
faith
in
!
Our
good
and
wonderful
sovereign
has
to
perform
*NL*
the
noblest
role
on
earth
,
and
he
is
so
virtuous
and
noble
that
God
will
*NL*
not
forsake
him
.
He
will
fulfill
his
vocation
and
crush
the
hydra
of
*NL*
revolution
,
which
has
become
more
terrible
than
ever
in
the
person
of
*NL*
this
murderer
and
villain
!
We
alone
must
avenge
the
blood
of
the
just
*NL*
one
...
Whom
,
I
ask
you
,
can
we
rely
on
?
...
England
with
her
commercial
*NL*
spirit
will
not
and
can
not
understand
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
loftiness
*NL*
of
soul
.
She
has
refused
to
evacuate
Malta
.
She
wanted
to
find
,
and
*NL*
still
seeks
,
some
secret
motive
in
our
actions
.
What
answer
did
*NL*
Novosiltsev
get
?
None
.
The
English
have
not
understood
and
can
not
*NL*
understand
the
self-abnegation
of
our
Emperor
who
wants
nothing
for
*NL*
himself
,
but
only
desires
the
good
of
mankind
.
And
what
have
they
*NL*
promised
?
Nothing
!
And
what
little
they
have
promised
they
will
not
*NL*
perform
!
Prussia
has
always
declared
that
Buonaparte
is
invincible
,
and
*NL*
that
all
Europe
is
powerless
before
him
...
And
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
*NL*
that
Hardenburg
says
,
or
Haugwitz
either
.
This
famous
Prussian
*NL*
neutrality
is
just
a
trap
.
I
have
faith
only
in
God
and
the
lofty
*NL*
destiny
of
our
adored
monarch
.
He
will
save
Europe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
paused
,
smiling
at
her
own
impetuosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
the
prince
with
a
smile
,
``
that
if
you
had
been
sent
*NL*
instead
of
our
dear
Wintzingerode
you
would
have
captured
the
King
of
*NL*
Prussia
's
consent
by
assault
.
You
are
so
eloquent
.
Will
you
give
me
a
*NL*
cup
of
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
moment
.
A
propos
,
''
she
added
,
becoming
calm
again
,
``
I
am
expecting
*NL*
two
very
interesting
men
tonight
,
le
Vicomte
de
Mortemart
,
who
is
*NL*
connected
with
the
Montmorencys
through
the
Rohans
,
one
of
the
best
*NL*
French
families
.
He
is
one
of
the
genuine
emigres
,
the
good
ones
.
And
*NL*
also
the
Abbe
Morio
.
Do
you
know
that
profound
thinker
?
He
has
been
*NL*
received
by
the
Emperor
.
Had
you
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted
to
meet
them
,
''
said
the
prince
.
``
But
tell
me
,
''
he
*NL*
added
with
studied
carelessness
as
if
it
had
only
just
occurred
to
him
,
*NL*
though
the
question
he
was
about
to
ask
was
the
chief
motive
of
his
*NL*
visit
,
``
is
it
true
that
the
Dowager
Empress
wants
Baron
Funke
to
be
*NL*
appointed
first
secretary
at
Vienna
?
The
baron
by
all
accounts
is
a
poor
*NL*
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
wished
to
obtain
this
post
for
his
son
,
but
others
were
*NL*
trying
through
the
Dowager
Empress
Marya
Fedorovna
to
secure
it
for
the
*NL*
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
almost
closed
her
eyes
to
indicate
that
neither
she
nor
*NL*
anyone
else
had
a
right
to
criticize
what
the
Empress
desired
or
was
*NL*
pleased
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baron
Funke
has
been
recommended
to
the
Dowager
Empress
by
her
sister
,
''
*NL*
was
all
she
said
,
in
a
dry
and
mournful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
named
the
Empress
,
Anna
Pavlovna
's
face
suddenly
assumed
an
*NL*
expression
of
profound
and
sincere
devotion
and
respect
mingled
with
*NL*
sadness
,
and
this
occurred
every
time
she
mentioned
her
illustrious
*NL*
patroness
.
She
added
that
Her
Majesty
had
deigned
to
show
Baron
Funke
*NL*
beaucoup
d'estime
,
and
again
her
face
clouded
over
with
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
silent
and
looked
indifferent
.
But
,
with
the
womanly
and
*NL*
courtierlike
quickness
and
tact
habitual
to
her
,
Anna
Pavlovna
wished
*NL*
both
to
rebuke
him
-LRB-
for
daring
to
speak
as
he
had
done
of
a
man
*NL*
recommended
to
the
Empress
-RRB-
and
at
the
same
time
to
console
him
,
so
she
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
about
your
family
.
Do
you
know
that
since
your
daughter
came
out
*NL*
everyone
has
been
enraptured
by
her
?
They
say
she
is
amazingly
*NL*
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
bowed
to
signify
his
respect
and
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
think
,
''
she
continued
after
a
short
pause
,
drawing
nearer
to
*NL*
the
prince
and
smiling
amiably
at
him
as
if
to
show
that
political
and
*NL*
social
topics
were
ended
and
the
time
had
come
for
intimate
*NL*
conversation
--
``
I
often
think
how
unfairly
sometimes
the
joys
of
life
are
*NL*
distributed
.
Why
has
fate
given
you
two
such
splendid
children
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
speak
of
Anatole
,
your
youngest
.
I
do
n't
like
him
,
''
she
added
in
a
tone
*NL*
admitting
of
no
rejoinder
and
raising
her
eyebrows
.
``
Two
such
charming
*NL*
children
.
And
really
you
appreciate
them
less
than
anyone
,
and
so
you
*NL*
do
n't
deserve
to
have
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
smiled
her
ecstatic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
said
the
prince
.
``
Lavater
would
have
said
I
lack
the
*NL*
bump
of
paternity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
joke
;
I
mean
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
you
.
Do
you
know
I
am
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
your
younger
son
?
Between
ourselves
''
-LRB-
and
her
face
*NL*
assumed
its
melancholy
expression
-RRB-
,
``
he
was
mentioned
at
Her
Majesty
's
*NL*
and
you
were
pitied
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
answered
nothing
,
but
she
looked
at
him
significantly
,
*NL*
awaiting
a
reply
.
He
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
me
do
?
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
You
know
I
did
all
a
*NL*
father
could
for
their
education
,
and
they
have
both
turned
out
fools
.
*NL*
Hippolyte
is
at
least
a
quiet
fool
,
but
Anatole
is
an
active
one
.
That
*NL*
is
the
only
difference
between
them
.
''
He
said
this
smiling
in
a
way
more
*NL*
natural
and
animated
than
usual
,
so
that
the
wrinkles
round
his
mouth
*NL*
very
clearly
revealed
something
unexpectedly
coarse
and
unpleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
are
children
born
to
such
men
as
you
?
If
you
were
not
a
father
*NL*
there
would
be
nothing
I
could
reproach
you
with
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
*NL*
looking
up
pensively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
your
faithful
slave
and
to
you
alone
I
can
confess
that
my
*NL*
children
are
the
bane
of
my
life
.
It
is
the
cross
I
have
to
bear
.
That
*NL*
is
how
I
explain
it
to
myself
.
It
ca
n't
be
helped
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
no
more
,
but
expressed
his
resignation
to
cruel
fate
by
a
*NL*
gesture
.
Anna
Pavlovna
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
thought
of
marrying
your
prodigal
son
Anatole
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
``
They
say
old
maids
have
a
mania
for
matchmaking
,
and
though
I
*NL*
do
n't
feel
that
weakness
in
myself
as
yet
,
I
know
a
little
person
who
is
*NL*
very
unhappy
with
her
father
.
She
is
a
relation
of
yours
,
Princess
Mary
*NL*
Bolkonskaya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
did
not
reply
,
though
,
with
the
quickness
of
memory
and
*NL*
perception
befitting
a
man
of
the
world
,
he
indicated
by
a
movement
of
*NL*
the
head
that
he
was
considering
this
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
evidently
unable
to
check
the
sad
*NL*
current
of
his
thoughts
,
``
that
Anatole
is
costing
me
forty
thousand
*NL*
rubles
a
year
?
And
,
''
he
went
on
after
a
pause
,
``
what
will
it
be
in
five
*NL*
years
,
if
he
goes
on
like
this
?
''
Presently
he
added
:
``
That
's
what
we
*NL*
fathers
have
to
put
up
with
...
Is
this
princess
of
yours
rich
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
father
is
very
rich
and
stingy

He
lives
in
the
country

He
is
the
*NL*
well-known
Prince
Bolkonski
who
had
to
retire
from
the
army
under
the
*NL*
late
Emperor
,
and
was
nicknamed
`

King

He
is
very
clever
*NL*
but
eccentric

and
a
bore

The
poor

is
very
unhappy

She
has
a
*NL*
brother

I
think
you
know

married

*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

dear
Annette

said
the
prince
,
suddenly
taking
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
hand
and
for
some
reason
drawing
it
downwards
.
``
Arrange
that
affair

*NL*
*NL*
And
with
the
familiarity
and
easy
grace
peculiar
to
him
,
he
raised
the
*NL*
maid
of
honor
's
hand
to
his
lips
,
kissed
it
,
and
swung
it
to
and
fro
as
*NL*
he
lay
back
in
his
armchair
,
looking
in
another
direction

*NL*
*NL*
``
Attendez

said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
reflecting
,
``
I

speak

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
drawing
room
was
gradually
filling
.
The
highest
*NL*
Petersburg
society
was
assembled
there
:
people
differing
widely
in
age
*NL*
and
character
but
alike
in
the
social
circle
to
which
they
belonged
.
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
's
daughter
,
the
beautiful
Helene
,
came
to
take
her
father
*NL*
to
the
ambassador
's
entertainment
;
she
wore
a
ball
dress
and
her
badge
*NL*
as
maid
of
honor
.
The
youthful
little
Princess
Bolkonskaya
,
known
as
la
*NL*
femme
la
plus
seduisante
de
Petersbourg
,
*
was
also
there
.
She
had
been
*NL*
married
during
the
previous
winter
,
and
being
pregnant
did
not
go
to
any
*NL*
large
gatherings
,
but
only
to
small
receptions
.
Prince
Vasili
's
son
,
*NL*
Hippolyte
,
had
come
with
Mortemart
,
whom
he
introduced
.
The
Abbe
Morio
*NL*
and
many
others
had
also
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
most
fascinating
woman
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
each
new
arrival
Anna
Pavlovna
said
,
``
You
have
not
yet
seen
my
aunt
,
''
*NL*
or
``
You
do
not
know
my
aunt
?
''
and
very
gravely
conducted
him
or
her
to
a
*NL*
little
old
lady
,
wearing
large
bows
of
ribbon
in
her
cap
,
who
had
come
*NL*
sailing
in
from
another
room
as
soon
as
the
guests
began
to
arrive
;
and
*NL*
slowly
turning
her
eyes
from
the
visitor
to
her
aunt
,
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
mentioned
each
one
's
name
and
then
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
visitor
performed
the
ceremony
of
greeting
this
old
aunt
whom
not
*NL*
one
of
them
knew
,
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
know
,
and
not
one
of
them
*NL*
cared
about
;
Anna
Pavlovna
observed
these
greetings
with
mournful
and
*NL*
solemn
interest
and
silent
approval
.
The
aunt
spoke
to
each
of
them
in
*NL*
the
same
words
,
about
their
health
and
her
own
,
and
the
health
of
Her
*NL*
Majesty
,
``
who
,
thank
God
,
was
better
today
.
''
And
each
visitor
,
though
*NL*
politeness
prevented
his
showing
impatience
,
left
the
old
woman
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
relief
at
having
performed
a
vexatious
duty
and
did
not
return
*NL*
to
her
the
whole
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Princess
Bolkonskaya
had
brought
some
work
in
a
gold
-
*NL*
embroidered
velvet
bag
.
Her
pretty
little
upper
lip
,
on
which
a
delicate
*NL*
dark
down
was
just
perceptible
,
was
too
short
for
her
teeth
,
but
it
*NL*
lifted
all
the
more
sweetly
,
and
was
especially
charming
when
she
*NL*
occasionally
drew
it
down
to
meet
the
lower
lip
.
As
is
always
the
case
*NL*
with
a
thoroughly
attractive
woman
,
her
defect
--
the
shortness
of
her
*NL*
upper
lip
and
her
half-open
mouth
--
seemed
to
be
her
own
special
and
*NL*
peculiar
form
of
beauty
.
Everyone
brightened
at
the
sight
of
this
pretty
*NL*
young
woman
,
so
soon
to
become
a
mother
,
so
full
of
life
and
health
,
and
*NL*
carrying
her
burden
so
lightly
.
Old
men
and
dull
dispirited
young
ones
*NL*
who
looked
at
her
,
after
being
in
her
company
and
talking
to
her
a
*NL*
little
while
,
felt
as
if
they
too
were
becoming
,
like
her
,
full
of
life
*NL*
and
health
.
All
who
talked
to
her
,
and
at
each
word
saw
her
bright
smile
*NL*
and
the
constant
gleam
of
her
white
teeth
,
thought
that
they
were
in
a
*NL*
specially
amiable
mood
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
went
round
the
table
with
quick
,
short
,
swaying
*NL*
steps
,
her
workbag
on
her
arm
,
and
gaily
spreading
out
her
dress
sat
*NL*
down
on
a
sofa
near
the
silver
samovar
,
as
if
all
she
was
doing
was
a
*NL*
pleasure
to
herself
and
to
all
around
her
.
``
I
have
brought
my
work
,
''
*NL*
said
she
in
French
,
displaying
her
bag
and
addressing
all
present
.
*NL*
``
Mind
,
Annette
,
I
hope
you
have
not
played
a
wicked
trick
on
me
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
turning
to
her
hostess
.
``
You
wrote
that
it
was
to
be
quite
a
*NL*
small
reception
,
and
just
see
how
badly
I
am
dressed
.
''
And
she
spread
*NL*
out
her
arms
to
show
her
short-waisted
,
lace-trimmed
,
dainty
gray
dress
,
*NL*
girdled
with
a
broad
ribbon
just
below
the
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soyez
tranquille
,
Lise
,
you
will
always
be
prettier
than
anyone
else
,
''
*NL*
replied
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
said
the
princess
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
and
still
in
*NL*
French
,
turning
to
a
general
,
``
my
husband
is
deserting
me
?
He
is
going
*NL*
to
get
himself
killed
.
Tell
me
what
this
wretched
war
is
for
?
''
she
*NL*
added
,
addressing
Prince
Vasili
,
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
*NL*
turned
to
speak
to
his
daughter
,
the
beautiful
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
delightful
woman
this
little
princess
is
!
''
said
Prince
Vasili
to
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
next
arrivals
was
a
stout
,
heavily
built
young
man
with
*NL*
close-cropped
hair
,
spectacles
,
the
light-colored
breeches
fashionable
*NL*
at
that
time
,
a
very
high
ruffle
,
and
a
brown
dress
coat
.
This
stout
*NL*
young
man
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
Count
Bezukhov
,
a
well-known
*NL*
grandee
of
Catherine
's
time
who
now
lay
dying
in
Moscow
.
The
young
man
*NL*
had
not
yet
entered
either
the
military
or
civil
service
,
as
he
had
only
*NL*
just
returned
from
abroad
where
he
had
been
educated
,
and
this
was
his
*NL*
first
appearance
in
society
.
Anna
Pavlovna
greeted
him
with
the
nod
she
*NL*
accorded
to
the
lowest
hierarchy
in
her
drawing
room
.
But
in
spite
of
*NL*
this
lowest-grade
greeting
,
a
look
of
anxiety
and
fear
,
as
at
the
sight
*NL*
of
something
too
large
and
unsuited
to
the
place
,
came
over
her
face
*NL*
when
she
saw
Pierre
enter
.
Though
he
was
certainly
rather
bigger
than
*NL*
the
other
men
in
the
room
,
her
anxiety
could
only
have
reference
to
the
*NL*
clever
though
shy
,
but
observant
and
natural
,
expression
which
*NL*
distinguished
him
from
everyone
else
in
that
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
,
Monsieur
Pierre
,
to
come
and
visit
a
poor
*NL*
invalid
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
exchanging
an
alarmed
glance
with
her
aunt
*NL*
as
she
conducted
him
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
murmured
something
unintelligible
,
and
continued
to
look
round
as
*NL*
if
in
search
of
something
.
On
his
way
to
the
aunt
he
bowed
to
the
little
*NL*
princess
with
a
pleased
smile
,
as
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
alarm
was
justified
,
for
Pierre
turned
away
from
the
*NL*
aunt
without
waiting
to
hear
her
speech
about
Her
Majesty
's
health
.
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
in
dismay
detained
him
with
the
words
:
``
Do
you
know
the
Abbe
*NL*
Morio
?
He
is
a
most
interesting
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
heard
of
his
scheme
for
perpetual
peace
,
and
it
is
very
*NL*
interesting
but
hardly
feasible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
''
rejoined
Anna
Pavlovna
in
order
to
say
something
and
get
*NL*
away
to
attend
to
her
duties
as
hostess
.
But
Pierre
now
committed
a
*NL*
reverse
act
of
impoliteness
.
First
he
had
left
a
lady
before
she
had
*NL*
finished
speaking
to
him
,
and
now
he
continued
to
speak
to
another
who
*NL*
wished
to
get
away
.
With
his
head
bent
,
and
his
big
feet
spread
apart
,
*NL*
he
began
explaining
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
abbe
's
plan
chimerical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
talk
of
it
later
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
got
rid
of
this
young
man
who
did
not
know
how
to
behave
,
she
*NL*
resumed
her
duties
as
hostess
and
continued
to
listen
and
watch
,
ready
*NL*
to
help
at
any
point
where
the
conversation
might
happen
to
flag
.
As
the
*NL*
foreman
of
a
spinning
mill
,
when
he
has
set
the
hands
to
work
,
goes
*NL*
round
and
notices
here
a
spindle
that
has
stopped
or
there
one
that
*NL*
creaks
or
makes
more
noise
than
it
should
,
and
hastens
to
check
the
*NL*
machine
or
set
it
in
proper
motion
,
so
Anna
Pavlovna
moved
about
her
*NL*
drawing
room
,
approaching
now
a
silent
,
now
a
too-noisy
group
,
and
by
a
*NL*
word
or
slight
rearrangement
kept
the
conversational
machine
in
steady
,
*NL*
proper
,
and
regular
motion
.
But
amid
these
cares
her
anxiety
about
*NL*
Pierre
was
evident
.
She
kept
an
anxious
watch
on
him
when
he
approached
*NL*
the
group
round
Mortemart
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
there
,
and
*NL*
again
when
he
passed
to
another
group
whose
center
was
the
abbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
been
educated
abroad
,
and
this
reception
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
was
the
first
he
had
attended
in
Russia
.
He
knew
that
all
the
*NL*
intellectual
lights
of
Petersburg
were
gathered
there
and
,
like
a
child
*NL*
in
a
toyshop
,
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
,
afraid
of
missing
any
*NL*
clever
conversation
that
was
to
be
heard
.
Seeing
the
self-confident
and
*NL*
refined
expression
on
the
faces
of
those
present
he
was
always
expecting
*NL*
to
hear
something
very
profound
.
At
last
he
came
up
to
Morio
.
Here
the
*NL*
conversation
seemed
interesting
and
he
stood
waiting
for
an
opportunity
*NL*
to
express
his
own
views
,
as
young
people
are
fond
of
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
reception
was
in
full
swing
.
The
spindles
hummed
*NL*
steadily
and
ceaselessly
on
all
sides
.
With
the
exception
of
the
aunt
,
*NL*
beside
whom
sat
only
one
elderly
lady
,
who
with
her
thin
careworn
face
*NL*
was
rather
out
of
place
in
this
brilliant
society
,
the
whole
company
had
*NL*
settled
into
three
groups
.
One
,
chiefly
masculine
,
had
formed
round
the
*NL*
abbe
.
Another
,
of
young
people
,
was
grouped
round
the
beautiful
Princess
*NL*
Helene
,
Prince
Vasili
's
daughter
,
and
the
little
Princess
Bolkonskaya
,
*NL*
very
pretty
and
rosy
,
though
rather
too
plump
for
her
age
.
The
third
*NL*
group
was
gathered
round
Mortemart
and
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
was
a
nice-looking
young
man
with
soft
features
and
polished
*NL*
manners
,
who
evidently
considered
himself
a
celebrity
but
out
of
*NL*
politeness
modestly
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
circle
in
*NL*
which
he
found
himself
.
Anna
Pavlovna
was
obviously
serving
him
up
as
a
*NL*
treat
to
her
guests
.
As
a
clever
maitre
d'hotel
serves
up
as
a
specially
*NL*
choice
delicacy
a
piece
of
meat
that
no
one
who
had
seen
it
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
would
have
cared
to
eat
,
so
Anna
Pavlovna
served
up
to
her
*NL*
guests
,
first
the
vicomte
and
then
the
abbe
,
as
peculiarly
choice
*NL*
morsels
.
The
group
about
Mortemart
immediately
began
discussing
the
*NL*
murder
of
the
Duc
d'Enghien
.
The
vicomte
said
that
the
Duc
d'Enghien
had
*NL*
perished
by
his
own
magnanimity
,
and
that
there
were
particular
reasons
*NL*
for
Buonaparte
's
hatred
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
Do
tell
us
all
about
it
,
Vicomte
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
feeling
that
there
was
something
a
la
Louis
XV
in
the
sound
of
*NL*
that
sentence
:
``
Contez
nous
cela
,
Vicomte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
bowed
and
smiled
courteously
in
token
of
his
willingness
to
*NL*
comply
.
Anna
Pavlovna
arranged
a
group
round
him
,
inviting
everyone
to
*NL*
listen
to
his
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
vicomte
knew
the
duc
personally
,
''
whispered
Anna
Pavlovna
to
one
of
*NL*
the
guests
.
``
The
vicomte
is
a
wonderful
raconteur
,
''
said
she
to
another
.
*NL*
``
How
evidently
he
belongs
to
the
best
society
,
''
said
she
to
a
third
;
and
*NL*
the
vicomte
was
served
up
to
the
company
in
the
choicest
and
most
*NL*
advantageous
style
,
like
a
well-garnished
joint
of
roast
beef
on
a
hot
*NL*
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
wished
to
begin
his
story
and
gave
a
subtle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
over
here
,
Helene
,
dear
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
to
the
beautiful
*NL*
young
princess
who
was
sitting
some
way
off
,
the
center
of
another
*NL*
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
smiled
.
She
rose
with
the
same
unchanging
smile
with
which
*NL*
she
had
first
entered
the
room
--
the
smile
of
a
perfectly
beautiful
*NL*
woman
.
With
a
slight
rustle
of
her
white
dress
trimmed
with
moss
and
*NL*
ivy
,
with
a
gleam
of
white
shoulders
,
glossy
hair
,
and
sparkling
*NL*
diamonds
,
she
passed
between
the
men
who
made
way
for
her
,
not
looking
*NL*
at
any
of
them
but
smiling
on
all
,
as
if
graciously
allowing
each
the
*NL*
privilege
of
admiring
her
beautiful
figure
and
shapely
shoulders
,
back
,
*NL*
and
bosom
--
which
in
the
fashion
of
those
days
were
very
much
exposed
--
*NL*
and
she
seemed
to
bring
the
glamour
of
a
ballroom
with
her
as
she
moved
*NL*
toward
Anna
Pavlovna
.
Helene
was
so
lovely
that
not
only
did
she
not
*NL*
show
any
trace
of
coquetry
,
but
on
the
contrary
she
even
appeared
shy
of
*NL*
her
unquestionable
and
all
too
victorious
beauty
.
She
seemed
to
wish
,
*NL*
but
to
be
unable
,
to
diminish
its
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
lovely
!
''
said
everyone
who
saw
her
;
and
the
vicomte
lifted
his
*NL*
shoulders
and
dropped
his
eyes
as
if
startled
by
something
extraordinary
*NL*
when
she
took
her
seat
opposite
and
beamed
upon
him
also
with
her
*NL*
unchanging
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
I
doubt
my
ability
before
such
an
audience
,
''
said
he
,
smilingly
*NL*
inclining
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
rested
her
bare
round
arm
on
a
little
table
and
considered
*NL*
a
reply
unnecessary
.
She
smilingly
waited
.
All
the
time
the
story
was
*NL*
being
told
she
sat
upright
,
glancing
now
at
her
beautiful
round
arm
,
*NL*
altered
in
shape
by
its
pressure
on
the
table
,
now
at
her
still
more
*NL*
beautiful
bosom
,
on
which
she
readjusted
a
diamond
necklace
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
she
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dress
,
and
whenever
the
story
*NL*
produced
an
effect
she
glanced
at
Anna
Pavlovna
,
at
once
adopted
just
*NL*
the
expression
she
saw
on
the
maid
of
honor
's
face
,
and
again
relapsed
*NL*
into
her
radiant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
had
also
left
the
tea
table
and
followed
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
I
'll
get
my
work
...
Now
then
,
what
are
you
thinking
*NL*
of
?
''
she
went
on
,
turning
to
Prince
Hippolyte
.
``
Fetch
me
my
workbag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
movement
as
the
princess
,
smiling
and
talking
*NL*
merrily
to
everyone
at
once
,
sat
down
and
gaily
arranged
herself
in
her
*NL*
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
all
right
,
''
she
said
,
and
asking
the
vicomte
to
begin
,
she
*NL*
took
up
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
,
having
brought
the
workbag
,
joined
the
circle
and
*NL*
moving
a
chair
close
to
hers
seated
himself
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Le
charmant
Hippolyte
was
surprising
by
his
extraordinary
resemblance
to
*NL*
his
beautiful
sister
,
but
yet
more
by
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
this
*NL*
resemblance
he
was
exceedingly
ugly
.
His
features
were
like
his
*NL*
sister
's
,
but
while
in
her
case
everything
was
lit
up
by
a
joyous
,
self
-
*NL*
satisfied
,
youthful
,
and
constant
smile
of
animation
,
and
by
the
*NL*
wonderful
classic
beauty
of
her
figure
,
his
face
on
the
contrary
was
*NL*
dulled
by
imbecility
and
a
constant
expression
of
sullen
self
-
*NL*
confidence
,
while
his
body
was
thin
and
weak
.
His
eyes
,
nose
,
and
mouth
*NL*
all
seemed
puckered
into
a
vacant
,
wearied
grimace
,
and
his
arms
and
*NL*
legs
always
fell
into
unnatural
positions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
going
to
be
a
ghost
story
?
''
said
he
,
sitting
down
beside
the
*NL*
princess
and
hastily
adjusting
his
lorgnette
,
as
if
without
this
*NL*
instrument
he
could
not
begin
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
no
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
the
astonished
narrator
,
shrugging
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
hate
ghost
stories
,
''
said
Prince
Hippolyte
in
a
tone
which
*NL*
showed
that
he
only
understood
the
meaning
of
his
words
after
he
had
*NL*
uttered
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
with
such
self-confidence
that
his
hearers
could
not
be
sure
*NL*
whether
what
he
said
was
very
witty
or
very
stupid
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
*NL*
dark-green
dress
coat
,
knee
breeches
of
the
color
of
cuisse
de
nymphe
*NL*
effrayee
,
as
he
called
it
,
shoes
,
and
silk
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
told
his
tale
very
neatly
.
It
was
an
anecdote
,
then
current
,
*NL*
to
the
effect
that
the
Duc
d'Enghien
had
gone
secretly
to
Paris
to
visit
*NL*
Mademoiselle
George
;
that
at
her
house
he
came
upon
Bonaparte
,
who
also
*NL*
enjoyed
the
famous
actress
'
favors
,
and
that
in
his
presence
Napoleon
*NL*
happened
to
fall
into
one
of
the
fainting
fits
to
which
he
was
subject
,
*NL*
and
was
thus
at
the
duc
's
mercy
.
The
latter
spared
him
,
and
this
*NL*
magnanimity
Bonaparte
subsequently
repaid
by
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
was
very
pretty
and
interesting
,
especially
at
the
point
where
*NL*
the
rivals
suddenly
recognized
one
another
;
and
the
ladies
looked
*NL*
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
!
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
with
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
little
*NL*
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
!
''
whispered
the
little
princess
,
sticking
the
needle
into
her
*NL*
work
as
if
to
testify
that
the
interest
and
fascination
of
the
story
*NL*
prevented
her
from
going
on
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
appreciated
this
silent
praise
and
smiling
gratefully
*NL*
prepared
to
continue
,
but
just
then
Anna
Pavlovna
,
who
had
kept
a
*NL*
watchful
eye
on
the
young
man
who
so
alarmed
her
,
noticed
that
he
was
*NL*
talking
too
loudly
and
vehemently
with
the
abbe
,
so
she
hurried
to
the
*NL*
rescue
.
Pierre
had
managed
to
start
a
conversation
with
the
abbe
about
*NL*
the
balance
of
power
,
and
the
latter
,
evidently
interested
by
the
young
*NL*
man
's
simple-minded
eagerness
,
was
explaining
his
pet
theory
.
Both
were
*NL*
talking
and
listening
too
eagerly
and
too
naturally
,
which
was
why
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
disapproved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
means
are
...
the
balance
of
power
in
Europe
and
the
rights
of
the
*NL*
people
,
''
the
abbe
was
saying
.
``
It
is
only
necessary
for
one
powerful
*NL*
nation
like
Russia
--
barbaric
as
she
is
said
to
be
--
to
place
herself
*NL*
disinterestedly
at
the
head
of
an
alliance
having
for
its
object
the
*NL*
maintenance
of
the
balance
of
power
of
Europe
,
and
it
would
save
the
*NL*
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
are
you
to
get
that
balance
?
''
Pierre
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Anna
Pavlovna
came
up
and
,
looking
severely
at
Pierre
,
*NL*
asked
the
Italian
how
he
stood
Russian
climate
.
The
Italian
's
face
*NL*
instantly
changed
and
assumed
an
offensively
affected
,
sugary
*NL*
expression
,
evidently
habitual
to
him
when
conversing
with
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
enchanted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
wit
and
culture
of
the
*NL*
society
,
more
especially
of
the
feminine
society
,
in
which
I
have
had
*NL*
the
honor
of
being
received
,
that
I
have
not
yet
had
time
to
think
of
*NL*
the
climate
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
letting
the
abbe
and
Pierre
escape
,
Anna
Pavlovna
,
the
more
*NL*
conveniently
to
keep
them
under
observation
,
brought
them
into
the
*NL*
larger
circle
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
another
visitor
entered
the
drawing
room
:
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
the
little
princess
'
husband
.
He
was
a
very
handsome
young
*NL*
man
,
of
medium
height
,
with
firm
,
clearcut
features
.
Everything
about
*NL*
him
,
from
his
weary
,
bored
expression
to
his
quiet
,
measured
step
,
*NL*
offered
a
most
striking
contrast
to
his
quiet
,
little
wife
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
he
not
only
knew
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
,
but
had
*NL*
found
them
to
be
so
tiresome
that
it
wearied
him
to
look
at
or
listen
to
*NL*
them
.
And
among
all
these
faces
that
he
found
so
tedious
,
none
seemed
to
*NL*
bore
him
so
much
as
that
of
his
pretty
wife
.
He
turned
away
from
her
*NL*
with
a
grimace
that
distorted
his
handsome
face
,
kissed
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
hand
,
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
scanned
the
whole
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
off
to
the
war
,
Prince
?
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
General
Kutuzov
,
''
said
Bolkonski
,
speaking
French
and
stressing
the
*NL*
last
syllable
of
the
general
's
name
like
a
Frenchman
,
``
has
been
pleased
*NL*
to
take
me
as
an
aide-de-camp
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Lise
,
your
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
go
to
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
ashamed
to
deprive
us
of
your
charming
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andre
,
''
said
his
wife
,
addressing
her
husband
in
the
same
coquettish
*NL*
manner
in
which
she
spoke
to
other
men
,
``
the
vicomte
has
been
telling
us
*NL*
such
a
tale
about
Mademoiselle
George
and
Buonaparte
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
turned
away
.
Pierre
,
who
from
the
*NL*
moment
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
room
had
watched
him
with
glad
,
*NL*
affectionate
eyes
,
now
came
up
and
took
his
arm
.
Before
he
looked
round
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
frowned
again
,
expressing
his
annoyance
with
whoever
was
*NL*
touching
his
arm
,
but
when
he
saw
Pierre
's
beaming
face
he
gave
him
an
*NL*
unexpectedly
kind
and
pleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
...
So
you
,
too
,
are
in
the
great
world
?
''
said
he
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
be
here
,
''
replied
Pierre
.
``
I
will
come
to
supper
with
*NL*
you
.
May
I
?
''
he
added
in
a
low
voice
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
vicomte
*NL*
who
was
continuing
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
impossible
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
laughing
and
pressing
Pierre
's
*NL*
hand
to
show
that
there
was
no
need
to
ask
the
question
.
He
wished
to
*NL*
say
something
more
,
but
at
that
moment
Prince
Vasili
and
his
daughter
*NL*
got
up
to
go
and
the
two
young
men
rose
to
let
them
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
excuse
me
,
dear
Vicomte
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
to
the
Frenchman
,
*NL*
holding
him
down
by
the
sleeve
in
a
friendly
way
to
prevent
his
rising
.
*NL*
``
This
unfortunate
fete
at
the
ambassador
's
deprives
me
of
a
pleasure
,
*NL*
and
obliges
me
to
interrupt
you
.
I
am
very
sorry
to
leave
your
*NL*
enchanting
party
,
''
said
he
,
turning
to
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
,
Princess
Helene
,
passed
between
the
chairs
,
lightly
*NL*
holding
up
the
folds
of
her
dress
,
and
the
smile
shone
still
more
*NL*
radiantly
on
her
beautiful
face
.
Pierre
gazed
at
her
with
rapturous
,
*NL*
almost
frightened
,
eyes
as
she
passed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
lovely
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
passing
Prince
Vasili
seized
Pierre
's
hand
and
said
to
Anna
Pavlovna
:
*NL*
``
Educate
this
bear
for
me
!
He
has
been
staying
with
me
a
whole
month
and
*NL*
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
seen
him
in
society
.
Nothing
is
so
*NL*
necessary
for
a
young
man
as
the
society
of
clever
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
smiled
and
promised
to
take
Pierre
in
hand
.
She
knew
his
*NL*
father
to
be
a
connection
of
Prince
Vasili
's
.
The
elderly
lady
who
had
*NL*
been
sitting
with
the
old
aunt
rose
hurriedly
and
overtook
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
in
the
anteroom
.
All
the
affectation
of
interest
she
had
assumed
had
*NL*
left
her
kindly
and
tear-worn
face
and
it
now
expressed
only
anxiety
and
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
my
son
Boris
,
Prince
?
''
said
she
,
hurrying
after
him
into
the
*NL*
anteroom
.
``
I
ca
n't
remain
any
longer
in
Petersburg
.
Tell
me
what
news
I
*NL*
may
take
back
to
my
poor
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Prince
Vasili
listened
reluctantly
and
not
very
politely
to
the
*NL*
elderly
lady
,
even
betraying
some
impatience
,
she
gave
him
an
*NL*
ingratiating
and
appealing
smile
,
and
took
his
hand
that
he
might
not
go
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
it
cost
you
to
say
a
word
to
the
Emperor
,
and
then
he
would
*NL*
be
transferred
to
the
Guards
at
once
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
Princess
,
I
am
ready
to
do
all
I
can
,
''
answered
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
``
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
ask
the
Emperor
.
I
should
advise
*NL*
you
to
appeal
to
Rumyantsev
through
Prince
Golitsyn
.
That
would
be
the
*NL*
best
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elderly
lady
was
a
Princess
Drubetskaya
,
belonging
to
one
of
the
*NL*
best
families
in
Russia
,
but
she
was
poor
,
and
having
long
been
out
of
*NL*
society
had
lost
her
former
influential
connections
.
She
had
now
come
to
*NL*
Petersburg
to
procure
an
appointment
in
the
Guards
for
her
only
son
.
It
*NL*
was
,
in
fact
,
solely
to
meet
Prince
Vasili
that
she
had
obtained
an
*NL*
invitation
to
Anna
Pavlovna
's
reception
and
had
sat
listening
to
the
*NL*
vicomte
's
story
.
Prince
Vasili
's
words
frightened
her
,
an
embittered
*NL*
look
clouded
her
once
handsome
face
,
but
only
for
a
moment
;
then
she
*NL*
smiled
again
and
clutched
Prince
Vasili
's
arm
more
tightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
Prince
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
have
never
yet
asked
you
for
*NL*
anything
and
I
never
will
again
,
nor
have
I
ever
reminded
you
of
my
*NL*
father
's
friendship
for
you
;
but
now
I
entreat
you
for
God
's
sake
to
do
*NL*
this
for
my
son
--
and
I
shall
always
regard
you
as
a
benefactor
,
''
she
*NL*
added
hurriedly
.
``
No
,
do
n't
be
angry
,
but
promise
!
I
have
asked
Golitsyn
*NL*
and
he
has
refused
.
Be
the
kindhearted
man
you
always
were
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
trying
to
smile
though
tears
were
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
we
shall
be
late
,
''
said
Princess
Helene
,
turning
her
beautiful
*NL*
head
and
looking
over
her
classically
molded
shoulder
as
she
stood
*NL*
waiting
by
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Influence
in
society
,
however
,
is
a
capital
which
has
to
be
economized
*NL*
if
it
is
to
last
.
Prince
Vasili
knew
this
,
and
having
once
realized
that
*NL*
if
he
asked
on
behalf
of
all
who
begged
of
him
,
he
would
soon
be
unable
*NL*
to
ask
for
himself
,
he
became
chary
of
using
his
influence
.
But
in
*NL*
Princess
Drubetskaya
's
case
he
felt
,
after
her
second
appeal
,
something
*NL*
like
qualms
of
conscience
.
She
had
reminded
him
of
what
was
quite
true
;
*NL*
he
had
been
indebted
to
her
father
for
the
first
steps
in
his
career
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
could
see
by
her
manners
that
she
was
one
of
those
women
--
*NL*
mostly
mothers
--
who
,
having
once
made
up
their
minds
,
will
not
rest
*NL*
until
they
have
gained
their
end
,
and
are
prepared
if
necessary
to
go
on
*NL*
insisting
day
after
day
and
hour
after
hour
,
and
even
to
make
scenes
.
*NL*
This
last
consideration
moved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
''
said
he
with
his
usual
familiarity
and
*NL*
weariness
of
tone
,
``
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
do
what
you
ask
;
*NL*
but
to
prove
my
devotion
to
you
and
how
I
respect
your
father
's
memory
,
*NL*
I
will
do
the
impossible
--
your
son
shall
be
transferred
to
the
Guards
.
*NL*
Here
is
my
hand
on
it
.
Are
you
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
benefactor
!
This
is
what
I
expected
from
you
--
I
knew
your
*NL*
kindness

He
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
--
just
a
word
!
When
he
has
been
transferred
to
the
Guards
...
''
she
*NL*
faltered
.
``
You
are
on
good
terms
with
Michael
Ilarionovich
Kutuzov
...
*NL*
recommend
Boris
to
him
as
adjutant

Then
I
shall
be
at
rest
,
and
*NL*
then
...

*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
promise
that
.
You
do
n't
know
how
Kutuzov
is
pestered
since
*NL*
his
appointment
as
Commander
in
Chief
.
He
told
me
himself
that
all
the
*NL*
Moscow
ladies
have
conspired
to
give
him
all
their
sons
as
adjutants

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
do
promise

I
wo
n't
let
you
go

My
dear
benefactor
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
''
said
his
beautiful
daughter
in
the
same
tone
as
before
,
``
we
*NL*
shall
be
late

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Good-bye

You
hear
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
tomorrow
you
will
speak
to
the
Emperor
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

but
about
Kutuzov
,
I
do
n't
promise
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
promise

do
promise

cried
Anna
Mikhaylovna
as
he
went
,
*NL*
with
the
smile
of
a
coquettish
girl
,
which
at
one
time
probably
came
*NL*
naturally
to
her
,
but
was
now
very
ill-suited
to
her
careworn
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
she
had
forgotten
her
age
and
by
force
of
habit
employed
all
*NL*
the
old
feminine
arts
.
But
as
soon
as
the
prince
had
gone
her
face
*NL*
resumed
its
former
cold
,
artificial
expression
.
She
returned
to
the
*NL*
group
where
the
vicomte
was
still
talking
,
and
again
pretended
to
*NL*
listen
,
while
waiting
till
it
would
be
time
to
leave
.
Her
task
was
*NL*
accomplished

CHAPTER
V

*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
think
of
this
latest
comedy

coronation
at
Milan

*NL*
asked
Anna
Pavlovna
,
``

the
comedy

their

before

on

Adorable
!
It
is
enough
to
make
one
's

It
is
as

the
whole
world
had
gone
crazy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
Anna
Pavlovna
straight
in
the
face
with
a
sarcastic
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
''

la
donne

They
say
he
was
very
fine
*NL*
when
he
said
that
,
''
he
remarked
,
repeating
the
words
in
Italian
:
''

Dio
*NL*

l'ha
dato
.
Guai
a
chi

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
God
has
given
it
to
me
,
let
him
who

it
beware
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
this
will
prove
the
last
drop
that
will
make
the
glass
run
*NL*
over
,
''
Anna
Pavlovna
continued
.
``
The
sovereigns
will
not
be
able
to
*NL*
endure
this
man
who
is
a
menace
to
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sovereigns
?
I
do
not
speak
of
Russia
,
''
said
the
vicomte
,
polite
but
*NL*
hopeless
:
``
The
sovereigns
,
madame
...
What
have
they
done
for
Louis
XVII
,
*NL*
for
the
Queen
,
or
for
Madame
Elizabeth
?
Nothing
!
''
and
he
became
more
*NL*
animated
.
``
And
believe
me
,
they
are
reaping
the
reward
of
their
betrayal
*NL*
of
the
Bourbon

The

Why
,
they
are
sending
ambassadors
*NL*
to
compliment
the
usurper

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
sighing
disdainfully
,
he
again
changed
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
,
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
vicomte
for
some
time
*NL*
through
his
lorgnette
,
suddenly
turned
completely
round
toward
the
*NL*
little
princess
,
and
having
asked
for
a
needle
began
tracing
the
Conde
*NL*
coat
of
arms
on
the
table
.
He
explained
this
to
her
with
as
much
gravity
*NL*
as
if
she
had
asked
him
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baton
de
gueules
,
engrele

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
listened
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Buonaparte
remains
on
the
throne
of
France
a
year
longer

''
the
*NL*
vicomte
continued
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
,
in
a
matter
with
which
he
*NL*
is
better
acquainted
than
anyone
else
,
does
not
listen
to
others
but
*NL*
follows
the
current
of
his
own
thoughts
,
``
things
will
have
gone

violence

I

have

forever
destroyed

then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
out
his
hands
.
Pierre
wished
to
*NL*
make
a
remark
,
for
the
conversation
interested
him
,
but
Anna
Pavlovna
,
*NL*
who
had
him
under
observation
,
interrupted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
Alexander
,
''
said
she
,
with
the
melancholy
which
always
*NL*
accompanied
any
reference
of
hers
to
the
Imperial
family
,
``
has
declared
*NL*
that
he
will
leave
it
to
the
French
people
themselves
to
choose
their
*NL*
own
form
of
government
;
and
I
believe
that
once
free
from
the
usurper
,
*NL*
the
whole
nation
will
certainly
throw
itself
into
the
arms
of
its
*NL*
rightful
king

she
concluded
,
trying
to
be
amiable
to
the
royalist
*NL*
emigrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
doubtful
,

said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Monsieur

Vicomte
quite
*NL*
rightly
supposes

be
difficult

return

*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
I
have
heard

said
Pierre
,
blushing
and
breaking
into
the
*NL*
conversation
,
``
almost
all
the
aristocracy

already
gone
over
to

side

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
Buonapartists

replied
the
vicomte
without
*NL*
looking
at
Pierre
.
``
At
the
present
time
it

opinion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bonaparte
has
said
so

remarked
Prince
Andrew
with
a
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
he
did
not
like
the
vicomte
and
was
aiming
his
*NL*
remarks
at
him
,
though
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''

I
showed
them
the
path
to
glory

they
did
not
follow
it

Prince
*NL*
Andrew
continued
after
a
short
silence
,
again
quoting
Napoleon
's
words
.
*NL*
''
'
I
opened
my
antechambers

they
crowded
in

I
do
not

justified
in
saying
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

replied
the
vicomte
.
``
After
the
murder

the
most
partial
ceased

he
went
on

turning
to
Anna
Pavlovna

ever

one
*NL*
hero
less

*NL*
*NL*
Before
Anna
Pavlovna
and
the
others
had
time
to
smile
their
appreciation
*NL*
of
the
vicomte
's
epigram
,
Pierre
again
broke
into
the
conversation
,
and
*NL*
though
Anna
Pavlovna
felt
sure
he
would
say
something
inappropriate
,
she
*NL*
was
unable
to
stop
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
execution
of
the
Duc
d'Enghien
,

declared
Monsieur
Pierre
,
``
was
a
*NL*
political
necessity

it
seems
to
me
that
Napoleon
showed
greatness

not
fearing
to
take
on
himself
the
whole
responsibility
of
*NL*
that
deed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dieu

Mon

muttered
Anna
Pavlovna
in
a
terrified
whisper

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Monsieur

Do
you
consider
that

said
the
little
princess
,
smiling
and
drawing
her
*NL*
work
nearer
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
exclaimed
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital

said
Prince
Hippolyte
in
English
,
and
began
slapping
his
knee
*NL*
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
Pierre
looked
solemnly
at
his
*NL*
audience
over
his
spectacles
and
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
so
,

he
continued
desperately
,

Bourbons
fled
from

so
for

Pierre
continued
his
speech
without
heeding
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried
he
,
becoming
more
and
more
eager
,
``
Napoleon

great

rose
superior

continued
Monsieur

betraying
by

this
desperate

provocative
proposition
his
extreme
youth

his

wish
to
express
all
that

*NL*
``

Anna

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Liberty

said
the

contemptuously

as

seriously
to
prove
to
this
youth
how
foolish

*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
kept
looking
with
an
amused
smile
from
Pierre
to
the
*NL*
vicomte
and
from
the
vicomte
to
their
hostess
.
In
the
first
moment
of
*NL*
Pierre
's
outburst
Anna
Pavlovna
,
despite
her
social
experience
,
was
*NL*
horror-struck
.
But
when
she
saw
that
Pierre
's
sacrilegious
words
had
not
*NL*
exasperated
the
vicomte
,
and
had
convinced
herself
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
stop
him
,
she
rallied
her
forces
and
joined
the
vicomte
in
*NL*
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
orator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
Monsieur

said
she
,
``

you

I
should
like

said
the
vicomte
,
``
to
ask
how
monsieur
explains

18th
Brumaire

not

an
imposture

swindle

not
at

*NL*
``
And
the

shrugging
her

*NL*
Pierre
,
not
knowing
whom
to
answer

looked
at
them
all

smiled

His
*NL*
smile
was
unlike
the
half-smile
of
other
people

When
he
smiled
,
his
*NL*
grave
,
even
rather
gloomy
,
look
was
instantaneously
replaced
by
another
-
*NL*
-
a
childlike
,
kindly
,
even
rather
silly
look
,
which
seemed
to
ask
*NL*
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vicomte
who
was
meeting
him
for
the
first
time
saw
clearly
that
this
*NL*
young
Jacobin
was
not
so
terrible
as
his
words
suggested
.
All
were
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
expect
him
to
answer
you
all
at

Prince
Andrew

*NL*
``
Besides

it
*NL*
seems

me

*NL*
*NL*
``

Pierre
chimed
in

pleased
at
the
arrival

reinforcement

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
admit

continued
Prince

``
that
Napoleon

*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
who
had
evidently
wished
to
tone
down
the
awkwardness
of
*NL*
Pierre

remarks

rose
and
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
that
it
was
time
to
*NL*
go

*NL*
Suddenly
Prince
Hippolyte
started
up
making
signs
to
everyone
to
attend
,

asking
them
all
to
be
seated
began
:

began
to
tell
his

Russian

Frenchman
would
speak
after
spending
about

demand
their

attention

his
story

*NL*
*NL*
``

burst
out
laughing
long
before
his
*NL*
audience
,
which
produced
an
effect
unfavorable
to
the
narrator
.
Several
*NL*
persons
,
among
them
the
elderly
lady
and
Anna
Pavlovna
,
did
however
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
went
.
Suddenly
there
was
a
great
wind
.
The
girl
lost
her
hat
and
*NL*
her
long
hair
came
down
...
''
Here
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
and
*NL*
went
on
,
between
gasps
of
laughter
:
``
And
the
whole
world
knew
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
anecdote
ended
.
Though
it
was
unintelligible
why
he
had
told
*NL*
it
,
or
why
it
had
to
be
told
in
Russian
,
still
Anna
Pavlovna
and
the
*NL*
others
appreciated
Prince
Hippolyte
's
social
tact
in
so
agreeably
ending
*NL*
Pierre
's
unpleasant
and
unamiable
outburst
.
After
the
anecdote
the
*NL*
conversation
broke
up
into
insignificant
small
talk
about
the
last
and
*NL*
next
balls
,
about
theatricals
,
and
who
would
meet
whom
,
and
when
and
*NL*
where

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thanked
Anna
Pavlovna
for
her
charming
soiree
,
the
guests
began
*NL*
to
take
their
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
ungainly
.
Stout
,
about
the
average
height
,
broad
,
with
huge
*NL*
red
hands
;
he
did
not
know
,
as
the
saying
is
,
how
to
enter
a
drawing
*NL*
room
and
still
less
how
to
leave
one
;
that
is
,
how
to
say
something
*NL*
particularly
agreeable
before
going
away
.
Besides
this
he
was
absent
-
*NL*
minded
.
When
he
rose
to
go
,
he
took
up
instead
of
his
own
,
the
general
's
*NL*
three-cornered
hat
,
and
held
it
,
pulling
at
the
plume
,
till
the
general
*NL*
asked
him
to
restore
it
.
All
his
absent-mindedness
and
inability
to
*NL*
enter
a
room
and
converse
in
it
was
,
however
,
redeemed
by
his
kindly
,
*NL*
simple
,
and
modest
expression
.
Anna
Pavlovna
turned
toward
him
and
,
with
*NL*
a
Christian
mildness
that
expressed
forgiveness
of
his
indiscretion
,
*NL*
nodded
and
said
:
``
I
hope
to
see
you
again
,
but
I
also
hope
you
will
*NL*
change
your
opinions
,
my
dear
Monsieur
Pierre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
said
this
,
he
did
not
reply
and
only
bowed
,
but
again
everybody
*NL*
saw
his
smile
,
which
said
nothing
,
unless
perhaps
,
``
Opinions
are
*NL*
opinions
,
but
you
see
what
a
capital
,
good-natured
fellow
I
am
.
''
And
*NL*
everyone
,
including
Anna
Pavlovna
,
felt
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
out
into
the
hall
,
and
,
turning
his
shoulders
to
*NL*
the
footman
who
was
helping
him
on
with
his
cloak
,
listened
*NL*
indifferently
to
his
wife
's
chatter
with
Prince
Hippolyte
who
had
also
*NL*
come
into
the
hall
.
Prince
Hippolyte
stood
close
to
the
pretty
,
pregnant
*NL*
princess
,
and
stared
fixedly
at
her
through
his
eyeglass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
,
Annette
,
or
you
will
catch
cold
,
''
said
the
little
princess
,
*NL*
taking
leave
of
Anna
Pavlovna
.
``
It
is
settled
,
''
she
added
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
had
already
managed
to
speak
to
Lise
about
the
match
she
*NL*
contemplated
between
Anatole
and
the
little
princess
'
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rely
on
you
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
also
in
a
low
tone
.
``
Write
*NL*
to
her
and
let
me
know
how
her
father
looks
at
the
matter
.
Au
revoir
!
''
--
*NL*
and
she
left
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
approached
the
little
princess
and
,
bending
his
face
*NL*
close
to
her
,
began
to
whisper
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
footmen
,
the
princess
'
and
his
own
,
stood
holding
a
shawl
and
a
*NL*
cloak
,
waiting
for
the
conversation
to
finish
.
They
listened
to
the
*NL*
French
sentences
which
to
them
were
meaningless
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
understanding
but
not
wishing
to
appear
to
do
so
.
The
princess
as
usual
*NL*
spoke
smilingly
and
listened
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
I
did
not
go
to
the
ambassador
's
,
''
said
Prince
Hippolyte
*NL*
''
-
so
dull
-
.
It
has
been
a
delightful
evening
,
has
it
not
?
Delightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
the
ball
will
be
very
good
,
''
replied
the
princess
,
drawing
up
*NL*
her
downy
little
lip
.
``
All
the
pretty
women
in
society
will
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
all
,
for
you
will
not
be
there
;
not
all
,
''
said
Prince
Hippolyte
*NL*
smiling
joyfully
;
and
snatching
the
shawl
from
the
footman
,
whom
he
even
*NL*
pushed
aside
,
he
began
wrapping
it
round
the
princess
.
Either
from
*NL*
awkwardness
or
intentionally
-LRB-
no
one
could
have
said
which
-RRB-
after
the
*NL*
shawl
had
been
adjusted
he
kept
his
arm
around
her
for
a
long
time
,
as
*NL*
though
embracing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
smiling
,
she
gracefully
moved
away
,
turning
and
glancing
at
her
*NL*
husband
.
Prince
Andrew
's
eyes
were
closed
,
so
weary
and
sleepy
did
he
*NL*
seem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ready
?
''
he
asked
his
wife
,
looking
past
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
hurriedly
put
on
his
cloak
,
which
in
the
latest
fashion
*NL*
reached
to
his
very
heels
,
and
,
stumbling
in
it
,
ran
out
into
the
porch
*NL*
following
the
princess
,
whom
a
footman
was
helping
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princesse
,
au
revoir
,
''
cried
he
,
stumbling
with
his
tongue
as
well
as
*NL*
with
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
picking
up
her
dress
,
was
taking
her
seat
in
the
dark
*NL*
carriage
,
her
husband
was
adjusting
his
saber
;
Prince
Hippolyte
,
under
*NL*
pretense
of
helping
,
was
in
everyone
's
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
in
Russian
in
a
cold
,
disagreeable
*NL*
tone
to
Prince
Hippolyte
who
was
blocking
his
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
expecting
you
,
Pierre
,
''
said
the
same
voice
,
but
gently
and
*NL*
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postilion
started
,
the
carriage
wheels
rattled
.
Prince
Hippolyte
*NL*
laughed
spasmodically
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
waiting
for
the
vicomte
*NL*
whom
he
had
promised
to
take
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mon
cher
,
''
said
the
vicomte
,
having
seated
himself
beside
*NL*
Hippolyte
in
the
carriage
,
``
your
little
princess
is
very
nice
,
very
nice
*NL*
indeed
,
quite
French
,
''
and
he
kissed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
Hippolyte
*NL*
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
you
are
a
terrible
chap
for
all
your
innocent
airs
,
''
*NL*
continued
the
vicomte
.
``
I
pity
the
poor
husband
,
that
little
officer
who
*NL*
gives
himself
the
airs
of
a
monarch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
spluttered
again
,
and
amid
his
laughter
said
,
``
And
you
were
*NL*
saying
that
the
Russian
ladies
are
not
equal
to
the
French
?
One
has
to
*NL*
know
how
to
deal
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
reaching
the
house
first
went
into
Prince
Andrew
's
study
like
one
*NL*
quite
at
home
,
and
from
habit
immediately
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
took
*NL*
from
the
shelf
the
first
book
that
came
to
his
hand
-LRB-
it
was
Caesar
's
*NL*
Commentaries
-RRB-
,
and
resting
on
his
elbow
,
began
reading
it
in
the
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
to
Mlle
Scherer
?
She
will
be
quite
ill
now
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
as
he
entered
the
study
,
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
turned
his
whole
body
,
making
the
sofa
creak
.
He
lifted
his
eager
*NL*
face
to
Prince
Andrew
,
smiled
,
and
waved
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
abbe
is
very
interesting
but
he
does
not
see
the
thing
in
the
*NL*
right
light
...
In
my
opinion
perpetual
peace
is
possible
but
--
I
do
not
*NL*
know
how
to
express
it
...
not
by
a
balance
of
political
power
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Prince
Andrew
was
not
interested
in
such
abstract
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
everywhere
say
all
one
thinks
,
mon
cher
.
Well
,
have
you
at
*NL*
last
decided
on
anything
?
Are
you
going
to
be
a
guardsman
or
a
*NL*
diplomatist
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
after
a
momentary
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
sat
up
on
the
sofa
,
with
his
legs
tucked
under
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
do
n't
yet
know
.
I
do
n't
like
either
the
one
or
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
decide
on
something
!
Your
father
expects
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
at
the
age
of
ten
had
been
sent
abroad
with
an
abbe
as
tutor
,
and
*NL*
had
remained
away
till
he
was
twenty
.
When
he
returned
to
Moscow
his
*NL*
father
dismissed
the
abbe
and
said
to
the
young
man
,
``
Now
go
to
*NL*
Petersburg
,
look
round
,
and
choose
your
profession
.
I
will
agree
to
*NL*
anything
.
Here
is
a
letter
to
Prince
Vasili
,
and
here
is
money
.
Write
to
*NL*
me
all
about
it
,
and
I
will
help
you
in
everything
.
''
Pierre
had
already
*NL*
been
choosing
a
career
for
three
months
,
and
had
not
decided
on
*NL*
anything
.
It
was
about
this
choice
that
Prince
Andrew
was
speaking
.
*NL*
Pierre
rubbed
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
must
be
a
Freemason
,
''
said
he
,
referring
to
the
abbe
whom
he
had
*NL*
met
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
nonsense
.
''
Prince
Andrew
again
interrupted
him
,
``
let
us
*NL*
talk
business
.
Have
you
been
to
the
Horse
Guards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
not
;
but
this
is
what
I
have
been
thinking
and
wanted
to
*NL*
tell
you
.
There
is
a
war
now
against
Napoleon
.
If
it
were
a
war
for
*NL*
freedom
I
could
understand
it
and
should
be
the
first
to
enter
the
army
;
*NL*
but
to
help
England
and
Austria
against
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
is
*NL*
not
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
Pierre
's
childish
words
.
He
*NL*
put
on
the
air
of
one
who
finds
it
impossible
to
reply
to
such
nonsense
,
*NL*
but
it
would
in
fact
have
been
difficult
to
give
any
other
answer
than
*NL*
the
one
Prince
Andrew
gave
to
this
naive
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
no
one
fought
except
on
his
own
conviction
,
there
would
be
no
wars
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
would
be
splendid
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
it
would
be
splendid
,
but
it
will
never
come
about
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
are
you
going
to
the
war
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
I
do
n't
know
.
I
must
.
Besides
that
I
am
going
...
''
He
paused
.
*NL*
``
I
am
going
because
the
life
I
am
leading
here
does
not
suit
me
!

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
rustle
of
a
woman
's
dress
was
heard
in
the
next
room
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
shook
himself
as
if
waking
up
,
and
his
face
assumed
the
look
it
had
had
*NL*
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
drawing
room
.
Pierre
removed
his
feet
from
the
sofa
.
*NL*
The
princess
came
in
.
She
had
changed
her
gown
for
a
house
dress
as
*NL*
fresh
and
elegant
as
the
other
.
Prince
Andrew
rose
and
politely
placed
a
*NL*
chair
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
,
''
she
began
,
as
usual
in
French
,
settling
down
briskly
and
*NL*
fussily
in
the
easy
chair
,
``
how
is
it
Annette
never
got
married
?
How
*NL*
stupid
you
men
all
are
not
to
have
married
her
!
Excuse
me
for
saying
so
,
*NL*
but
you
have
no
sense
about
women
.
What
an
argumentative
fellow
you
are
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Pierre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
still
arguing
with
your
husband
.
I
ca
n't
understand
why
he
*NL*
wants
to
go
to
the
war
,
''
replied
Pierre
,
addressing
the
princess
with
*NL*
none
of
the
embarrassment
so
commonly
shown
by
young
men
in
their
*NL*
intercourse
with
young
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
started
.
Evidently
Pierre
's
words
touched
her
to
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
is
just
what
I
tell
him
!
''
said
she
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
it
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
in
the
least
understand
why
men
ca
n't
live
without
wars
.
How
is
it
*NL*
that
we
women
do
n't
want
anything
of
the
kind
,
do
n't
need
it
?
Now
you
*NL*
shall
judge
between
us
.
I
always
tell
him
:
Here
he
is
Uncle
's
aide-de
-
*NL*
camp
,
a
most
brilliant
position
.
He
is
so
well
known
,
so
much
*NL*
appreciated
by
everyone
.
The
other
day
at
the
Apraksins
'
I
heard
a
lady
*NL*
asking
,
`
Is
that
the
famous
Prince
Andrew
?
'
I
did
indeed
.
''
She
laughed
.
*NL*
``
He
is
so
well
received
everywhere
.
He
might
easily
become
aide-de-camp
*NL*
to
the
Emperor
.
You
know
the
Emperor
spoke
to
him
most
graciously
.
*NL*
Annette
and
I
were
speaking
of
how
to
arrange
it
.
What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
his
friend
and
,
noticing
that
he
did
not
like
the
*NL*
conversation
,
gave
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
starting
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
speak
of
his
going
,
do
n't
!
I
wo
n't
hear
it
spoken
of
,
''
said
*NL*
the
princess
in
the
same
petulantly
playful
tone
in
which
she
had
spoken
*NL*
to
Hippolyte
in
the
drawing
room
and
which
was
so
plainly
ill-suited
to
*NL*
the
family
circle
of
which
Pierre
was
almost
a
member
.
``
Today
when
I
*NL*
remembered
that
all
these
delightful
associations
must
be
broken
off
...
*NL*
and
then
you
know
,
Andre
...
''
-LRB-
she
looked
significantly
at
her
husband
-RRB-
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
I
'm
afraid
!
''
she
whispered
,
and
a
shudder
ran
down
her
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
looked
at
her
as
if
surprised
to
notice
that
someone
besides
*NL*
Pierre
and
himself
was
in
the
room
,
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
frigid
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
,
Lise
?
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
what
egotists
men
all
are
:
all
,
all
egotists
!
Just
for
a
whim
of
*NL*
his
own
,
goodness
only
knows
why
,
he
leaves
me
and
locks
me
up
alone
in
*NL*
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my
father
and
sister
,
remember
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
all
the
same
,
without
my
friends
...
And
he
expects
me
not
to
be
*NL*
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
now
querulous
and
her
lip
drawn
up
,
giving
her
not
a
*NL*
joyful
,
but
an
animal
,
squirrel-like
expression
.
She
paused
as
if
she
*NL*
felt
it
indecorous
to
speak
of
her
pregnancy
before
Pierre
,
though
the
*NL*
gist
of
the
matter
lay
in
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
still
ca
n't
understand
what
you
are
afraid
of
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
slowly
,
not
taking
his
eyes
off
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
blushed
,
and
raised
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Andrew
,
I
must
say
you
have
changed
.
Oh
,
how
you
have
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
doctor
tells
you
to
go
to
bed
earlier
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
You
*NL*
had
better
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
said
nothing
,
but
suddenly
her
short
downy
lip
quivered
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
rose
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
walked
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
naive
surprise
,
now
at
him
and
*NL*
now
at
her
,
moved
as
if
about
to
rise
too
,
but
changed
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
mind
Monsieur
Pierre
being
here
?
''
exclaimed
the
little
*NL*
princess
suddenly
,
her
pretty
face
all
at
once
distorted
by
a
tearful
*NL*
grimace
.
``
I
have
long
wanted
to
ask
you
,
Andrew
,
why
you
have
changed
so
*NL*
to
me
?
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
You
are
going
to
the
war
and
have
no
*NL*
pity
for
me
.
Why
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise
!
''
was
all
Prince
Andrew
said
.
But
that
one
word
expressed
an
*NL*
entreaty
,
a
threat
,
and
above
all
conviction
that
she
would
herself
*NL*
regret
her
words
.
But
she
went
on
hurriedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
treat
me
like
an
invalid
or
a
child
.
I
see
it
all
!
Did
you
behave
*NL*
like
that
six
months
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise
,
I
beg
you
to
desist
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
still
more
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
who
had
been
growing
more
and
more
agitated
as
he
listened
to
*NL*
all
this
,
rose
and
approached
the
princess
.
He
seemed
unable
to
bear
the
*NL*
sight
of
tears
and
was
ready
to
cry
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
Princess
!
It
seems
so
to
you
because
...
I
assure
you
I
*NL*
myself
have
experienced
...
and
so
...
because
...
No
,
excuse
me
!
An
*NL*
outsider
is
out
of
place
here
...
No
,
do
n't
distress
yourself
...
Good
-
*NL*
bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
caught
him
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
,
Pierre
!
The
princess
is
too
kind
to
wish
to
deprive
me
of
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
spending
the
evening
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
thinks
only
of
himself
,
''
muttered
the
princess
without
*NL*
restraining
her
angry
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lise
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
dryly
,
raising
his
voice
to
the
pitch
which
*NL*
indicates
that
patience
is
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
angry
,
squirrel-like
expression
of
the
princess
'
pretty
*NL*
face
changed
into
a
winning
and
piteous
look
of
fear
.
Her
beautiful
eyes
*NL*
glanced
askance
at
her
husband
's
face
,
and
her
own
assumed
the
timid
,
*NL*
deprecating
expression
of
a
dog
when
it
rapidly
but
feebly
wags
its
*NL*
drooping
tail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
Dieu
,
mon
Dieu
!
''
she
muttered
,
and
lifting
her
dress
with
one
hand
*NL*
she
went
up
to
her
husband
and
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
Lise
,
''
said
he
,
rising
and
courteously
kissing
her
hand
as
*NL*
he
would
have
done
to
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
friends
were
silent
.
Neither
cared
to
begin
talking
.
Pierre
*NL*
continually
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew
;
Prince
Andrew
rubbed
his
forehead
*NL*
with
his
small
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
and
have
supper
,
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
going
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
elegant
,
newly
decorated
,
and
luxurious
dining
room
.
*NL*
Everything
from
the
table
napkins
to
the
silver
,
china
,
and
glass
bore
*NL*
that
imprint
of
newness
found
in
the
households
of
the
newly
married
.
*NL*
Halfway
through
supper
Prince
Andrew
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
,
*NL*
with
a
look
of
nervous
agitation
such
as
Pierre
had
never
before
seen
on
*NL*
his
face
,
began
to
talk
--
as
one
who
has
long
had
something
on
his
mind
*NL*
and
suddenly
determines
to
speak
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
marry
,
my
dear
fellow
!
That
's
my
advice
:
never
marry
till
*NL*
you
can
say
to
yourself
that
you
have
done
all
you
are
capable
of
,
and
*NL*
until
you
have
ceased
to
love
the
woman
of
your
choice
and
have
seen
her
*NL*
plainly
as
she
is
,
or
else
you
will
make
a
cruel
and
irrevocable
*NL*
mistake
.
Marry
when
you
are
old
and
good
for
nothing
--
or
all
that
is
*NL*
good
and
noble
in
you
will
be
lost
.
It
will
all
be
wasted
on
trifles
.
*NL*
Yes
!
Yes
!
Yes
!
Do
n't
look
at
me
with
such
surprise
.
If
you
marry
*NL*
expecting
anything
from
yourself
in
the
future
,
you
will
feel
at
every
*NL*
step
that
for
you
all
is
ended
,
all
is
closed
except
the
drawing
room
,
*NL*
where
you
will
be
ranged
side
by
side
with
a
court
lackey
and
an
*NL*
idiot
!
...
But
what
's
the
good
?
...
''
and
he
waved
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
off
his
spectacles
,
which
made
his
face
seem
different
and
*NL*
the
good-natured
expression
still
more
apparent
,
and
gazed
at
his
friend
*NL*
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
,
''
continued
Prince
Andrew
,
``
is
an
excellent
woman
,
one
of
those
*NL*
rare
women
with
whom
a
man
's
honor
is
safe
;
but
,
O
God
,
what
would
I
not
*NL*
give
now
to
be
unmarried
!
You
are
the
first
and
only
one
to
whom
I
*NL*
mention
this
,
because
I
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
Prince
Andrew
was
less
than
ever
like
that
Bolkonski
who
*NL*
had
lolled
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
easy
chairs
and
with
half-closed
eyes
had
*NL*
uttered
French
phrases
between
his
teeth
.
Every
muscle
of
his
thin
face
*NL*
was
now
quivering
with
nervous
excitement
;
his
eyes
,
in
which
the
fire
*NL*
of
life
had
seemed
extinguished
,
now
flashed
with
brilliant
light
.
It
*NL*
was
evident
that
the
more
lifeless
he
seemed
at
ordinary
times
,
the
more
*NL*
impassioned
he
became
in
these
moments
of
almost
morbid
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
why
I
say
this
,
''
he
continued
,
``
but
it
is
the
*NL*
whole
story
of
life
.
You
talk
of
Bonaparte
and
his
career
,
''
said
he
*NL*
-LRB-
though
Pierre
had
not
mentioned
Bonaparte
-RRB-
,
``
but
Bonaparte
when
he
*NL*
worked
went
step
by
step
toward
his
goal
.
He
was
free
,
he
had
nothing
*NL*
but
his
aim
to
consider
,
and
he
reached
it
.
But
tie
yourself
up
with
a
*NL*
woman
and
,
like
a
chained
convict
,
you
lose
all
freedom
!
And
all
you
*NL*
have
of
hope
and
strength
merely
weighs
you
down
and
torments
you
with
*NL*
regret
.
Drawing
rooms
,
gossip
,
balls
,
vanity
,
and
triviality
--
these
are
*NL*
the
enchanted
circle
I
can
not
escape
from
.
I
am
now
going
to
the
war
,
*NL*
the
greatest
war
there
ever
was
,
and
I
know
nothing
and
am
fit
for
*NL*
nothing
.
I
am
very
amiable
and
have
a
caustic
wit
,
''
continued
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
``
and
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
they
listen
to
me
.
And
that
stupid
set
*NL*
without
whom
my
wife
can
not
exist
,
and
those
women
...
If
you
only
knew
*NL*
what
those
society
women
are
,
and
women
in
general
!
My
father
is
right
.
*NL*
Selfish
,
vain
,
stupid
,
trivial
in
everything
--
that
's
what
women
are
when
*NL*
you
see
them
in
their
true
colors
!
When
you
meet
them
in
society
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
there
were
something
in
them
,
but
there
's
nothing
,
nothing
,
*NL*
nothing
!
No
,
do
n't
marry
,
my
dear
fellow
;
do
n't
marry
!
''
concluded
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
funny
to
me
,
''
said
Pierre
,
``
that
you
,
you
should
consider
*NL*
yourself
incapable
and
your
life
a
spoiled
life
.
You
have
everything
*NL*
before
you
,
everything
.
And
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
his
sentence
,
but
his
tone
showed
how
highly
he
*NL*
thought
of
his
friend
and
how
much
he
expected
of
him
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
he
talk
like
that
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
He
considered
his
friend
a
*NL*
model
of
perfection
because
Prince
Andrew
possessed
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
just
the
very
qualities
Pierre
lacked
,
and
which
might
be
best
*NL*
described
as
strength
of
will
.
Pierre
was
always
astonished
at
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
calm
manner
of
treating
everybody
,
his
extraordinary
memory
,
*NL*
his
extensive
reading
-LRB-
he
had
read
everything
,
knew
everything
,
and
had
*NL*
an
opinion
about
everything
-RRB-
,
but
above
all
at
his
capacity
for
work
and
*NL*
study
.
And
if
Pierre
was
often
struck
by
Andrew
's
lack
of
capacity
for
*NL*
philosophical
meditation
-LRB-
to
which
he
himself
was
particularly
*NL*
addicted
-RRB-
,
he
regarded
even
this
not
as
a
defect
but
as
a
sign
of
*NL*
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
best
,
most
friendly
and
simplest
relations
of
life
,
praise
*NL*
and
commendation
are
essential
,
just
as
grease
is
necessary
to
wheels
*NL*
that
they
may
run
smoothly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
part
is
played
out
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
What
's
the
use
of
talking
*NL*
about
me
?
Let
us
talk
about
you
,
''
he
added
after
a
silence
,
smiling
at
*NL*
his
reassuring
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
smile
was
immediately
reflected
on
Pierre
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
there
to
say
about
me
?
''
said
Pierre
,
his
face
relaxing
into
*NL*
a
careless
,
merry
smile
.
``
What
am
I
?
An
illegitimate
son
!
''
He
suddenly
*NL*
blushed
crimson
,
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
made
a
great
effort
to
say
*NL*
this
.
``
Without
a
name
and
without
means
...
And
it
really
...
''
But
he
did
*NL*
not
say
what
``
it
really
''
was
.
``
For
the
present
I
am
free
and
am
all
*NL*
right
.
Only
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
what
I
am
to
do
;
I
wanted
to
*NL*
consult
you
seriously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
kindly
at
him
,
yet
his
glance
--
friendly
and
*NL*
affectionate
as
it
was
--
expressed
a
sense
of
his
own
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fond
of
you
,
especially
as
you
are
the
one
live
man
among

*NL*
whole
set

you
're
all
right

Choose
what
you
will
;
it
's
all
the
*NL*
same

You
'll
be
all
right
anywhere
.
But
look
here
:
give
up
visiting
*NL*
those
Kuragins
and
leading
that
sort
of
life
.
It
suits
you
so
badly
--
all
*NL*
this
debauchery
,
dissipation
,
and
the
rest
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
,
my
dear
fellow
?
''
answered
Pierre
,
shrugging
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
``
Women
,
my
dear
fellow
;
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
it

replied
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Women
who
are

's
a
different

but
the
Kuragins

women
*NL*
and
wine

I
do
n't
understand

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
staying
at
Prince
Vasili
Kuragin
's
and
sharing
the
dissipated
*NL*
life
of
his
son
Anatole
,
the
son
whom
they
were
planning
to
reform
by
*NL*
marrying
him
to
Prince
Andrew
's
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
?
''
said
Pierre
,
as
if
suddenly
struck
by
a
happy
thought
,
*NL*
``
seriously
,
I
have
long
been
thinking
of
it

Leading
such
a
life
I

think
properly
about
anything

One

head
aches

and
one

spends
all

He
asked

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
one
o'clock
when
Pierre
left
his
friend
.
It
was
a
cloudless
,
*NL*
northern
,
summer
night
.
Pierre
took
an
open
cab
intending
to
drive
*NL*
straight
home
.
But
the
nearer
he
drew
to
the
house
the
more
he
felt
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
going
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
.
It
was
light
enough
to
*NL*
see
a
long
way
in
the
deserted
street
and
it
seemed
more
like
morning
or
*NL*
evening
than
night
.
On
the
way
Pierre
remembered
that
Anatole
Kuragin
*NL*
was
expecting
the
usual
set
for
cards
that
evening
,
after
which
there
*NL*
was
generally
a
drinking
bout
,
finishing
with
visits
of
a
kind
Pierre
*NL*
was
very
fond
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
go
to
Kuragin
's
,
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
immediately
recalled
his
promise
to
Prince
Andrew
not
to
go
*NL*
there
.
Then
,
as
happens
to
people
of
weak
character
,
he
desired
so
*NL*
passionately
once
more
to
enjoy
that
dissipation
he
was
so
accustomed
to
*NL*
that
he
decided
to
go
.
The
thought
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
his
*NL*
promise
to
Prince
Andrew
was
of
no
account
,
because
before
he
gave
it
he
*NL*
had
already
promised
Prince
Anatole
to
come
to
his
gathering
;
``
besides
,
''
*NL*
thought
he
,
``
all
such
`
words
of
honor
'
are
conventional
things
with
no
*NL*
definite
meaning
,
especially
if
one
considers
that
by
tomorrow
one
may
*NL*
be
dead
,
or
something
so
extraordinary
may
happen
to
one
that
honor
and
*NL*
dishonor
will
be
all
the
same
!
''
Pierre
often
indulged
in
reflections
of
*NL*
this
sort
,
nullifying
all
his
decisions
and
intentions
.
He
went
to
*NL*
Kuragin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
large
house
near
the
Horse
Guards
'
barracks
,
in
which
*NL*
Anatole
lived
,
Pierre
entered
the
lighted
porch
,
ascended
the
stairs
,
*NL*
and
went
in
at
the
open
door
.
There
was
no
one
in
the
anteroom
;
empty
*NL*
bottles
,
cloaks
,
and
overshoes
were
lying
about
;
there
was
a
smell
of
*NL*
alcohol
,
and
sounds
of
voices
and
shouting
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cards
and
supper
were
over
,
but
the
visitors
had
not
yet
dispersed
.
*NL*
Pierre
threw
off
his
cloak
and
entered
the
first
room
,
in
which
were
the
*NL*
remains
of
supper
.
A
footman
,
thinking
no
one
saw
him
,
was
drinking
on
*NL*
the
sly
what
was
left
in
the
glasses
.
From
the
third
room
came
sounds
of
*NL*
laughter
,
the
shouting
of
familiar
voices
,
the
growling
of
a
bear
,
and
*NL*
general
commotion
.
Some
eight
or
nine
young
men
were
crowding
anxiously
*NL*
round
an
open
window
.
Three
others
were
romping
with
a
young
bear
,
one
*NL*
pulling
him
by
the
chain
and
trying
to
set
him
at
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
a
hundred
on
Stevens
!
''
shouted
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
no
holding
on
!
''
cried
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
on
Dolokhov
!
''
cried
a
third
.
``
Kuragin
,
you
part
our
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
leave
Bruin
alone
;
here
's
a
bet
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
one
draught
,
or
he
loses
!
''
shouted
a
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jacob
,
bring
a
bottle
!
''
shouted
the
host
,
a
tall
,
handsome
fellow
who
*NL*
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
group
,
without
a
coat
,
and
with
his
fine
linen
*NL*
shirt
unfastened
in
front
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
you
fellows
...
Here
is
Petya
!
*NL*
Good
man
!
''
cried
he
,
addressing
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
voice
,
from
a
man
of
medium
height
with
clear
blue
eyes
,
*NL*
particularly
striking
among
all
these
drunken
voices
by
its
sober
ring
,
*NL*
cried
from
the
window
:
``
Come
here
;
part
the
bets
!
''
This
was
Dolokhov
,
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
Semenov
regiment
,
a
notorious
gambler
and
duelist
,
who
*NL*
was
living
with
Anatole
.
Pierre
smiled
,
looking
about
him
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
What
's
it
all
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
he
is
not
drunk
yet
!
A
bottle
here
,
''
said
Anatole
,
taking
a
*NL*
glass
from
the
table
he
went
up
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
you
must
drink
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
drank
one
glass
after
another
,
looking
from
under
his
brows
at
*NL*
the
tipsy
guests
who
were
again
crowding
round
the
window
,
and
listening
*NL*
to
their
chatter
.
Anatole
kept
on
refilling
Pierre
's
glass
while
*NL*
explaining
that
Dolokhov
was
betting
with
Stevens
,
an
English
naval
*NL*
officer
,
that
he
would
drink
a
bottle
of
rum
sitting
on
the
outer
ledge
*NL*
of
the
third
floor
window
with
his
legs
hanging
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
you
must
drink
it
all
,
''
said
Anatole
,
giving
Pierre
the
last
*NL*
glass
,
``
or
I
wo
n't
let
you
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Pierre
,
pushing
Anatole
aside
,
and
he
went
up
to
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
was
holding
the
Englishman
's
hand
and
clearly
and
distinctly
*NL*
repeating
the
terms
of
the
bet
,
addressing
himself
particularly
to
*NL*
Anatole
and
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
was
of
medium
height
,
with
curly
hair
and
light-blue
eyes
.
He
*NL*
was
about
twenty-five
.
Like
all
infantry
officers
he
wore
no
mustache
,
*NL*
so
that
his
mouth
,
the
most
striking
feature
of
his
face
,
was
clearly
*NL*
seen
.
The
lines
of
that
mouth
were
remarkably
finely
curved
.
The
middle
*NL*
of
the
upper
lip
formed
a
sharp
wedge
and
closed
firmly
on
the
firm
*NL*
lower
one
,
and
something
like
two
distinct
smiles
played
continually
*NL*
round
the
two
corners
of
the
mouth
;
this
,
together
with
the
resolute
,
*NL*
insolent
intelligence
of
his
eyes
,
produced
an
effect
which
made
it
*NL*
impossible
not
to
notice
his
face
.
Dolokhov
was
a
man
of
small
means
and
*NL*
no
connections
.
Yet
,
though
Anatole
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
rubles
,
*NL*
Dolokhov
lived
with
him
and
had
placed
himself
on
such
a
footing
that
*NL*
all
who
knew
them
,
including
Anatole
himself
,
respected
him
more
than
*NL*
they
did
Anatole
.
Dolokhov
could
play
all
games
and
nearly
always
won
.
*NL*
However
much
he
drank
,
he
never
lost
his
clearheadedness
.
Both
Kuragin
*NL*
and
Dolokhov
were
at
that
time
notorious
among
the
rakes
and
scapegraces
*NL*
of
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bottle
of
rum
was
brought
.
The
window
frame
which
prevented
anyone
*NL*
from
sitting
on
the
outer
sill
was
being
forced
out
by
two
footmen
,
who
*NL*
were
evidently
flurried
and
intimidated
by
the
directions
and
shouts
of
*NL*
the
gentlemen
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
with
his
swaggering
air
strode
up
to
the
window
.
He
wanted
to
*NL*
smash
something
.
Pushing
away
the
footmen
he
tugged
at
the
frame
,
but
*NL*
could
not
move
it
.
He
smashed
a
pane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
try
,
Hercules
,
''
said
he
,
turning
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
seized
the
crossbeam
,
tugged
,
and
wrenched
the
oak
frame
out
with
*NL*
a
crash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
right
out
,
or
they
'll
think
I
'm
holding
on
,
''
said
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
Englishman
bragging
?
...
Eh
?
Is
it
all
right
?
''
said
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First-rate
,
''
said
Pierre
,
looking
at
Dolokhov
,
who
with
a
bottle
of
rum
*NL*
in
his
hand
was
approaching
the
window
,
from
which
the
light
of
the
sky
,
*NL*
the
dawn
merging
with
the
afterglow
of
sunset
,
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
the
bottle
of
rum
still
in
his
hand
,
jumped
onto
the
window
*NL*
sill
.
``
Listen
!
''
cried
he
,
standing
there
and
addressing
those
in
the
*NL*
room
.
All
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
fifty
imperials
''
--
he
spoke
French
that
the
Englishman
might
*NL*
understand
him
,
but
he
did
not
speak
it
very
well
--
``
I
bet
fifty
*NL*
imperials
...
or
do
you
wish
to
make
it
a
hundred
?
''
added
he
,
addressing
*NL*
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
fifty
,
''
replied
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
Fifty
imperials
...
that
I
will
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
rum
*NL*
without
taking
it
from
my
mouth
,
sitting
outside
the
window
on
this
*NL*
spot
''
-LRB-
he
stooped
and
pointed
to
the
sloping
ledge
outside
the
window
-RRB-
*NL*
``
and
without
holding
on
to
anything
.
Is
that
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
''
said
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
turned
to
the
Englishman
and
taking
him
by
one
of
the
buttons
of
*NL*
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
him
--
the
Englishman
was
short
--
began
*NL*
repeating
the
terms
of
the
wager
to
him
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
''
cried
Dolokhov
,
hammering
with
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
to
*NL*
attract
attention
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
Kuragin
.
Listen
!
If
anyone
else
does
the
*NL*
same
,
I
will
pay
him
a
hundred
imperials
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
nodded
,
but
gave
no
indication
whether
he
intended
to
*NL*
accept
this
challenge
or
not
.
Anatole
did
not
release
him
,
and
though
he
*NL*
kept
nodding
to
show
that
he
understood
,
Anatole
went
on
translating
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
words
into
English
.
A
thin
young
lad
,
an
hussar
of
the
Life
*NL*
Guards
,
who
had
been
losing
that
evening
,
climbed
on
the
window
sill
,
*NL*
leaned
over
,
and
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
he
muttered
,
looking
down
from
the
window
at
the
stones
of
*NL*
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
!
''
cried
Dolokhov
,
pushing
him
away
from
the
window
.
The
lad
*NL*
jumped
awkwardly
back
into
the
room
,
tripping
over
his
spurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Placing
the
bottle
on
the
window
sill
where
he
could
reach
it
easily
,
*NL*
Dolokhov
climbed
carefully
and
slowly
through
the
window
and
lowered
his
*NL*
legs
.
Pressing
against
both
sides
of
the
window
,
he
adjusted
himself
on
*NL*
his
seat
,
lowered
his
hands
,
moved
a
little
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
*NL*
left
,
and
took
up
the
bottle
.
Anatole
brought
two
candles
and
placed
*NL*
them
on
the
window
sill
,
though
it
was
already
quite
light
.
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
back
in
his
white
shirt
,
and
his
curly
head
,
were
lit
up
from
both
*NL*
sides
.
Everyone
crowded
to
the
window
,
the
Englishman
in
front
.
Pierre
*NL*
stood
smiling
but
silent
.
One
man
,
older
than
the
others
present
,
*NL*
suddenly
pushed
forward
with
a
scared
and
angry
look
and
wanted
to
seize
*NL*
hold
of
Dolokhov
's
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
this
is
folly
!
He
'll
be
killed
,
''
said
this
more
sensible
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
him
!
You
'll
startle
him
and
then
he
'll
be
killed
.
Eh
?
...
*NL*
What
then
?
...
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
turned
round
and
,
again
holding
on
with
both
hands
,
arranged
*NL*
himself
on
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anyone
comes
meddling
again
,
''
said
he
,
emitting
the
words
separately
*NL*
through
his
thin
compressed
lips
,
``
I
will
throw
him
down
there
.
Now
*NL*
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
this
he
again
turned
round
,
dropped
his
hands
,
took
the
bottle
*NL*
and
lifted
it
to
his
lips
,
threw
back
his
head
,
and
raised
his
free
hand
*NL*
to
balance
himself
.
One
of
the
footmen
who
had
stooped
to
pick
up
some
*NL*
broken
glass
remained
in
that
position
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
window
and
from
Dolokhov
's
back
.
Anatole
stood
erect
with
staring
eyes
.
*NL*
The
Englishman
looked
on
sideways
,
pursing
up
his
lips
.
The
man
who
had
*NL*
wished
to
stop
the
affair
ran
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
threw
himself
*NL*
on
a
sofa
with
his
face
to
the
wall
.
Pierre
hid
his
face
,
from
which
a
*NL*
faint
smile
forgot
to
fade
though
his
features
now
expressed
horror
and
*NL*
fear
.
All
were
still
.
Pierre
took
his
hands
from
his
eyes
.
Dolokhov
*NL*
still
sat
in
the
same
position
,
only
his
head
was
thrown
further
back
*NL*
till
his
curly
hair
touched
his
shirt
collar
,
and
the
hand
holding
the
*NL*
bottle
was
lifted
higher
and
higher
and
trembled
with
the
effort
.
The
*NL*
bottle
was
emptying
perceptibly
and
rising
still
higher
and
his
head
*NL*
tilting
yet
further
back
.
``
Why
is
it
so
long
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
more
than
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
.
Suddenly
Dolokhov
made
a
*NL*
backward
movement
with
his
spine
,
and
his
arm
trembled
nervously
;
this
*NL*
was
sufficient
to
cause
his
whole
body
to
slip
as
he
sat
on
the
sloping
*NL*
ledge
.
As
he
began
slipping
down
,
his
head
and
arm
wavered
still
more
*NL*
with
the
strain
.
One
hand
moved
as
if
to
clutch
the
window
sill
,
but
*NL*
refrained
from
touching
it
.
Pierre
again
covered
his
eyes
and
thought
he
*NL*
would
never
open
them
again
.
Suddenly
he
was
aware
of
a
stir
all
around
.
*NL*
He
looked
up
:
Dolokhov
was
standing
on
the
window
sill
,
with
a
pale
but
*NL*
radiant
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
empty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
the
bottle
to
the
Englishman
,
who
caught
it
neatly
.
Dolokhov
*NL*
jumped
down
.
He
smelt
strongly
of
rum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
!
...
Fine
fellow
!
...
There
's
a
bet
for
you

Devil

you

came
from
different
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
took
out
his
purse
and
began
counting
out
the
money
.
*NL*
Dolokhov
stood
frowning
and
did
not
speak
.
Pierre
jumped
upon
the
window
*NL*
sill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
who
wishes
to
bet
with
me
?
I
'll
do
the
same
thing
!
''
he
*NL*
suddenly
cried
.
``
Even
without
a
bet
,
there
!
Tell
them
to
bring
me
a
*NL*
bottle

I
'll
do
it

Bring
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
do
it
,
let

do

said
Dolokhov
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
Have
you
gone
mad
?
...
No
one
would
let
you
!
...
Why
,
you
go
*NL*
giddy
even
on
a
staircase
,
''
exclaimed
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
drink
it
!
Let
's
have
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
shouted
Pierre
,
banging
the
*NL*
table
with
a
determined
and
drunken
gesture
and
preparing
to
climb
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seized
him
by
his
arms
;
but
he
was
so
strong
that
everyone
who
*NL*
touched
him
was
sent
flying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
'll
never
manage
him
that

said
Anatole

``
Wait
a

I

*NL*

Come

cried
Pierre

``
Come
on

And
we
'll
take

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
caught
the
bear
,
took
it
in
his
arms
,
lifted
it
from

began
dancing
round

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
kept
the
promise
he
had
given
to
Princess
Drubetskaya
who
*NL*
had
spoken
to
him
on
behalf
of
her
only
son
Boris
on
the
evening
of
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
's
soiree
.
The
matter
was
mentioned
to
the
Emperor
,
an
exception
*NL*
made
,
and
Boris
transferred
into
the
regiment
of
Semenov
Guards
with
the
*NL*
rank
of
cornet
.
He
received
,
however
,
no
appointment
to
Kutuzov
's
staff
*NL*
despite
all
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
endeavors
and
entreaties
.
Soon
after
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
's
reception
Anna
Mikhaylovna
returned
to
Moscow
and
went
*NL*
straight
to
her
rich
relations
,
the
Rostovs
,
with
whom
she
stayed
when
*NL*
in
the
town
and
where
her
darling
Bory
,
who
had
only
just
entered
a
*NL*
regiment
of
the
line
and
was
being
at
once
transferred
to
the
Guards
as
*NL*
a
cornet
,
had
been
educated
from
childhood
and
lived
for
years
at
a
*NL*
time
.
The
Guards
had
already
left
Petersburg
on
the
tenth
of
August
,
and
*NL*
her
son
,
who
had
remained
in
Moscow
for
his
equipment
,
was
to
join
them
*NL*
on
the
march
to
Radzivilov
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
St.
Natalia
's
day
and
the
name
day
of
two
of
the
Rostovs
--
the
*NL*
mother
and
the
youngest
daughter
--
both
named
Nataly
.
Ever
since
the
*NL*
morning
,
carriages
with
six
horses
had
been
coming
and
going
*NL*
continually
,
bringing
visitors
to
the
Countess
Rostova
's
big
house
on
*NL*
the
Povarskaya
,
so
well
known
to
all
Moscow
.
The
countess
herself
and
*NL*
her
handsome
eldest
daughter
were
in
the
drawing-room
with
the
visitors
*NL*
who
came
to
congratulate
,
and
who
constantly
succeeded
one
another
in
*NL*
relays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
a
woman
of
about
forty-five
,
with
a
thin
Oriental
type
*NL*
of
face
,
evidently
worn
out
with
childbearing
--
she
had
had
twelve
.
A
*NL*
languor
of
motion
and
speech
,
resulting
from
weakness
,
gave
her
a
*NL*
distinguished
air
which
inspired
respect
.
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
Drubetskaya
,
who
as
a
member
of
the
household
was
also
seated
in
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
helped
to
receive
and
entertain
the
visitors
.
The
young
*NL*
people
were
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
,
not
considering
it
necessary
to
*NL*
take
part
in
receiving
the
visitors
.
The
count
met
the
guests
and
saw
*NL*
them
off
,
inviting
them
all
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
,
very
grateful
to
you
,
mon
cher
,
''
or
``
ma
chere
''
--
he
called
*NL*
everyone
without
exception
and
without
the
slightest
variation
in
his
*NL*
tone
,
``
my
dear
,
''
whether
they
were
above
or
below
him
in
rank
--
``
I
thank
*NL*
you
for
myself
and
for
our
two
dear
ones
whose
name
day
we
are
keeping
.
*NL*
But
mind
you
come
to
dinner
or
I
shall
be
offended
,
ma
chere
!
On
behalf
*NL*
of
the
whole
family
I
beg
you
to
come
,
mon
cher
!
''
These
words
he
*NL*
repeated
to
everyone
without
exception
or
variation
,
and
with
the
same
*NL*
expression
on
his
full
,
cheerful
,
clean-shaven
face
,
the
same
firm
*NL*
pressure
of
the
hand
and
the
same
quick
,
repeated
bows
.
As
soon
as
he
*NL*
had
seen
a
visitor
off
he
returned
to
one
of
those
who
were
still
in
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
drew
a
chair
toward
him
or
her
,
and
jauntily
spreading
out
*NL*
his
legs
and
putting
his
hands
on
his
knees
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
*NL*
enjoys
life
and
knows
how
to
live
,
he
swayed
to
and
fro
with
dignity
,
*NL*
offered
surmises
about
the
weather
,
or
touched
on
questions
of
health
,
*NL*
sometimes
in
Russian
and
sometimes
in
very
bad
but
self-confident
*NL*
French
;
then
again
,
like
a
man
weary
but
unflinching
in
the
fulfillment
*NL*
of
duty
,
he
rose
to
see
some
visitors
off
and
,
stroking
his
scanty
gray
*NL*
hairs
over
his
bald
patch
,
also
asked
them
to
dinner
.
Sometimes
on
his
*NL*
way
back
from
the
anteroom
he
would
pass
through
the
conservatory
and
*NL*
pantry
into
the
large
marble
dining
hall
,
where
tables
were
being
set
*NL*
out
for
eighty
people
;
and
looking
at
the
footmen
,
who
were
bringing
in
*NL*
silver
and
china
,
moving
tables
,
and
unfolding
damask
table
linen
,
he
*NL*
would
call
Dmitri
Vasilevich
,
a
man
of
good
family
and
the
manager
of
*NL*
all
his
affairs
,
and
while
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
enormous
table
*NL*
would
say
:
``
Well
,
Dmitri
,
you
'll
see
that
things
are
all
as
they
should
*NL*
be
?
That
's
right
!
The
great
thing
is
the
serving
,
that
's
it
.
''
And
with
a
*NL*
complacent
sigh
he
would
return
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marya
Lvovna
Karagina
and
her
daughter
!
''
announced
the
countess
'
*NL*
gigantic
footman
in
his
bass
voice
,
entering
the
drawing
room
.
The
*NL*
countess
reflected
a
moment
and
took
a
pinch
from
a
gold
snuffbox
with
*NL*
her
husband
's
portrait
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
worn
out
by
these
callers
.
However
,
I
'll
see
her
and
no
more
.
*NL*
She
is
so
affected
.
Ask
her
in
,
''
she
said
to
the
footman
in
a
sad
voice
,
*NL*
as
if
saying
:
``
Very
well
,
finish
me
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
,
stout
,
and
proud-looking
woman
,
with
a
round-faced
smiling
*NL*
daughter
,
entered
the
drawing
room
,
their
dresses
rustling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Countess
,
what
an
age
...
She
has
been
laid
up
,
poor
child
...
at
*NL*
the
Razumovski
's
ball
...
and
Countess
Apraksina
...
I
was
so
*NL*
delighted
...
''
came
the
sounds
of
animated
feminine
voices
,
interrupting
*NL*
one
another
and
mingling
with
the
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
scraping
*NL*
of
chairs
.
Then
one
of
those
conversations
began
which
last
out
until
,
*NL*
at
the
first
pause
,
the
guests
rise
with
a
rustle
of
dresses
and
say
,
``
I
*NL*
am
so
delighted
...
Mamma
's
health
...
and
Countess
Apraksina
...
''
and
*NL*
then
,
again
rustling
,
pass
into
the
anteroom
,
put
on
cloaks
or
mantles
,
*NL*
and
drive
away
.
The
conversation
was
on
the
chief
topic
of
the
day
:
the
*NL*
illness
of
the
wealthy
and
celebrated
beau
of
Catherine
's
day
,
Count
*NL*
Bezukhov
,
and
about
his
illegitimate
son
Pierre
,
the
one
who
had
behaved
*NL*
so
improperly
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sorry
for
the
poor
count
,
''
said
the
visitor
.
``
He
is
in
such
bad
*NL*
health
,
and
now
this
vexation
about
his
son
is
enough
to
kill
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
the
countess
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
the
*NL*
visitor
alluded
to
,
though
she
had
already
heard
about
the
cause
of
*NL*
Count
Bezukhov
's
distress
some
fifteen
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
comes
of
a
modern
education
,
''
exclaimed
the
visitor
.
``
It
*NL*
seems
that
while
he
was
abroad
this
young
man
was
allowed
to
do
as
he
*NL*
liked
,
now
in
Petersburg
I
hear
he
has
been
doing
such
terrible
things
*NL*
that
he
has
been
expelled
by
the
police
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
replied
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
chose
his
friends
badly
,
''
interposed
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
``
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
's
son
,
he
,
and
a
certain
Dolokhov
have
,
it
is
said
,
been
up
to
*NL*
heaven
only
knows
what
!
And
they
have
had
to
suffer
for
it
.
Dolokhov
has
*NL*
been
degraded
to
the
ranks
and
Bezukhov
's
son
sent
back
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
Anatole
Kuragin
's
father
managed
somehow
to
get
his
son
's
affair
hushed
*NL*
up
,
but
even
he
was
ordered
out
of
Petersburg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
they
been
up
to
?
''
asked
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
regular
brigands
,
especially
Dolokhov
,
''
replied
the
visitor
.
*NL*
``
He
is
a
son
of
Marya
Ivanovna
Dolokhova
,
such
a
worthy
woman
,
but
*NL*
there
,
just
fancy
!
Those
three
got
hold
of
a
bear
somewhere
,
put
it
in
a
*NL*
carriage
,
and
set
off
with
it
to
visit
some
actresses
!
The
police
tried
*NL*
to
interfere
,
and
what
did
the
young
men
do
?
They
tied
a
policeman
and
*NL*
the
bear
back
to
back
and
put
the
bear
into
the
Moyka
Canal
.
And
there
*NL*
was
the
bear
swimming
about
with
the
policeman
on
his
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nice
figure
the
policeman
must
have
cut
,
my
dear
!
''
shouted
the
*NL*
count
,
dying
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
dreadful
!
How
can
you
laugh
at
it
,
Count
?

*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
ladies
themselves
could
not
help
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
all
they
could
do
to
rescue
the
poor
man

continued
the
*NL*
visitor
.
``
And
to
think
it
is
Cyril
Vladimirovich
Bezukhov
's
son
who
*NL*
amuses
himself
in
this
sensible
manner
!
And
he
was
said
to
be
so
well
*NL*
educated
and
clever
.
This
is
all
that
his
foreign
education
has
done
for
*NL*
him
!
I
hope
that
here
in
Moscow
no
one
will
receive
him
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
money
.
They
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
me
,
but
I
quite
declined
:
I
have
*NL*
my
daughters
to
consider
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
this
young
man
is
so
rich

asked
the
countess
,
turning
*NL*
away
from
the
girls

who
at
once
assumed
an
air
of
inattention
.
``
His
*NL*
children
are
all
illegitimate

I
think
Pierre
also
is
illegitimate

The
visitor
made
a
gesture
with
her
hand

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
he
has
a
score
of
them

*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
intervened
in
the
conversation
,
evidently
*NL*
wishing
to
show
her
connections
and
knowledge
of
what
went
on
in
*NL*
society

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact

said
she
significantly
,
and
also
in
a
half
*NL*
whisper
,
``
everyone
knows
Count
Cyril

reputation

I
was

the

*NL*
is
very
fond
of
Pierre
,
looked
after
his
education
,
and
wrote
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
about
him

so
that
in
the
case

his
death

he
is
so
ill

he
may
die
at

Forty

me
himself

Besides

she
added

no

``
Yes

seeing

not

he
turned
to
the

to
impersonate
the
policeman
,
his
portly
form
*NL*
again
shook
with
a
deep
ringing
laugh
,
the
laugh
of
one
who
always
eats
*NL*
well
and
,
in
particular
,
drinks
well
.
``
So
do
come
and
dine
with
us
!

he
*NL*
said

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
ensued
.
The
countess
looked
at
her
callers
,
smiling
affably
,
but
*NL*
not
concealing
the
fact
that
she
would
not
be
distressed
if
they
now
*NL*
rose
and
took
their
leave
.
The
visitor
's
daughter
was
already
smoothing
*NL*
down
her
dress
with
an
inquiring
look
at
her
mother
,
when
suddenly
from
*NL*
the
next
room
were
heard
the
footsteps
of
boys
and
girls
running
to
the
*NL*
door
and
the
noise
of
a
chair
falling
over
,
and
a
girl
of
thirteen
,
*NL*
hiding
something
in
the
folds
of
her
short
muslin
frock
,
darted
in
and
*NL*
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
It
was
evident
that
she
had
not
*NL*
intended
her
flight
to
bring
her
so
far
.
Behind
her
in
the
doorway
*NL*
appeared
a
student
with
a
crimson
coat
collar
,
an
officer
of
the
Guards
,
*NL*
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
and
a
plump
rosy-faced
boy
in
a
short
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
jumped
up
and
,
swaying
from
side
to
side
,
spread
his
arms
wide
*NL*
and
threw
them
round
the
little
girl
who
had
run
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
she
is
!
''
he
exclaimed
laughing
.
``
My
pet
,
whose
name
day
it
is
.
*NL*
My
dear
pet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
chere
,
there
is
a
time
for
everything
,
''
said
the
countess
with
*NL*
feigned
severity
.
``
You
spoil
her
,
Ilya
,
''
she
added
,
turning
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
?
I
wish
you
many
happy
returns
of
your
name
*NL*
day
,
''
said
the
visitor
.
``
What
a
charming
child
,
''
she
added
,
addressing
*NL*
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
black-eyed
,
wide-mouthed
girl
,
not
pretty
but
full
of
life
--
with
*NL*
childish
bare
shoulders
which
after
her
run
heaved
and
shook
her
bodice
,
*NL*
with
black
curls
tossed
backward
,
thin
bare
arms
,
little
legs
in
lace
-
*NL*
frilled
drawers
,
and
feet
in
low
slippers
--
was
just
at
that
charming
age
*NL*
when
a
girl
is
no
longer
a
child
,
though
the
child
is
not
yet
a
young
*NL*
woman
.
Escaping
from
her
father
she
ran
to
hide
her
flushed
face
in
the
*NL*
lace
of
her
mother
's
mantilla
--
not
paying
the
least
attention
to
her
*NL*
severe
remark
--
and
began
to
laugh
.
She
laughed
,
and
in
fragmentary
*NL*
sentences
tried
to
explain
about
a
doll
which
she
produced
from
the
*NL*
folds
of
her
frock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
?
...
My
doll
...
Mimi
...
You
see
...
''
was
all
Natasha
managed
*NL*
to
utter
-LRB-
to
her
everything
seemed
funny
-RRB-
.
She
leaned
against
her
mother
*NL*
and
burst
into
such
a
loud
,
ringing
fit
of
laughter
that
even
the
prim
*NL*
visitor
could
not
help
joining
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
go
away
and
take
your
monstrosity
with
you
,
''
said
the
mother
,
*NL*
pushing
away
her
daughter
with
pretended
sternness
,
and
turning
to
the
*NL*
visitor
she
added
:
``
She
is
my
youngest
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
raising
her
face
for
a
moment
from
her
mother
's
mantilla
,
*NL*
glanced
up
at
her
through
tears
of
laughter
,
and
again
hid
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
,
compelled
to
look
on
at
this
family
scene
,
thought
it
*NL*
necessary
to
take
some
part
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
my
dear
,
''
said
she
to
Natasha
,
``
is
Mimi
a
relation
of
yours
?
A
*NL*
daughter
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
like
the
visitor
's
tone
of
condescension
to
childish
*NL*
things
.
She
did
not
reply
,
but
looked
at
her
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
younger
generation
:
Boris
,
the
officer
,
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
*NL*
son
;
Nicholas
,
the
undergraduate
,
the
count
's
eldest
son
;
Sonya
,
the
*NL*
count
's
fifteen-year-old
niece
,
and
little
Petya
,
his
youngest
boy
,
had
*NL*
all
settled
down
in
the
drawing
room
and
were
obviously
trying
to
*NL*
restrain
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
the
excitement
and
mirth
that
*NL*
shone
in
all
their
faces
.
Evidently
in
the
back
rooms
,
from
which
they
*NL*
had
dashed
out
so
impetuously
,
the
conversation
had
been
more
amusing
*NL*
than
the
drawing-room
talk
of
society
scandals
,
the
weather
,
and
*NL*
Countess
Apraksina
.
Now
and
then
they
glanced
at
one
another
,
hardly
*NL*
able
to
suppress
their
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
men
,
the
student
and
the
officer
,
friends
from
childhood
,
*NL*
were
of
the
same
age
and
both
handsome
fellows
,
though
not
alike
.
Boris
*NL*
was
tall
and
fair
,
and
his
calm
and
handsome
face
had
regular
,
delicate
*NL*
features
.
Nicholas
was
short
with
curly
hair
and
an
open
expression
.
*NL*
Dark
hairs
were
already
showing
on
his
upper
lip
,
and
his
whole
face
*NL*
expressed
impetuosity
and
enthusiasm
.
Nicholas
blushed
when
he
entered
*NL*
the
drawing
room
.
He
evidently
tried
to
find
something
to
say
,
but
*NL*
failed
.
Boris
on
the
contrary
at
once
found
his
footing
,
and
related
*NL*
quietly
and
humorously
how
he
had
known
that
doll
Mimi
when
she
was
*NL*
still
quite
a
young
lady
,
before
her
nose
was
broken
;
how
she
had
aged
*NL*
during
the
five
years
he
had
known
her
,
and
how
her
head
had
cracked
*NL*
right
across
the
skull
.
Having
said
this
he
glanced
at
Natasha
.
She
*NL*
turned
away
from
him
and
glanced
at
her
younger
brother
,
who
was
*NL*
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
shaking
with
suppressed
laughter
,
and
unable
to
*NL*
control
herself
any
longer
,
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
from
the
room
as
*NL*
fast
as
her
nimble
little
feet
would
carry
her
.
Boris
did
not
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
meaning
to
go
out
,
were
n't
you
,
Mamma
?
Do
you
want
the
*NL*
carriage
?
''
he
asked
his
mother
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
go
and
tell
them
to
get
it
ready
,
''
she
answered
,
returning
*NL*
his
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
quietly
left
the
room
and
went
in
search
of
Natasha
.
The
plump
boy
*NL*
ran
after
them
angrily
,
as
if
vexed
that
their
program
had
been
*NL*
disturbed
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
young
people
remaining
in
the
drawing
room
,
not
counting
the
*NL*
young
lady
visitor
and
the
countess
'
eldest
daughter
-LRB-
who
was
four
years
*NL*
older
than
her
sister
and
behaved
already
like
a
grown-up
person
-RRB-
,
were
*NL*
Nicholas
and
Sonya
,
the
niece
.
Sonya
was
a
slender
little
brunette
with
*NL*
a
tender
look
in
her
eyes
which
were
veiled
by
long
lashes
,
thick
black
*NL*
plaits
coiling
twice
round
her
head
,
and
a
tawny
tint
in
her
complexion
*NL*
and
especially
in
the
color
of
her
slender
but
graceful
and
muscular
*NL*
arms
and
neck
.
By
the
grace
of
her
movements
,
by
the
softness
and
*NL*
flexibility
of
her
small
limbs
,
and
by
a
certain
coyness
and
reserve
of
*NL*
manner
,
she
reminded
one
of
a
pretty
,
half-grown
kitten
which
promises
*NL*
to
become
a
beautiful
little
cat
.
She
evidently
considered
it
proper
to
*NL*
show
an
interest
in
the
general
conversation
by
smiling
,
but
in
spite
of
*NL*
herself
her
eyes
under
their
thick
long
lashes
watched
her
cousin
who
*NL*
was
going
to
join
the
army
,
with
such
passionate
girlish
adoration
that
*NL*
her
smile
could
not
for
a
single
instant
impose
upon
anyone
,
and
it
was
*NL*
clear
that
the
kitten
had
settled
down
only
to
spring
up
with
more
*NL*
energy
and
again
play
with
her
cousin
as
soon
as
they
too
could
,
like
*NL*
Natasha
and
Boris
,
escape
from
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
my
dear
,
''
said
the
count
,
addressing
the
visitor
and
pointing
*NL*
to
Nicholas
,
``
his
friend
Boris
has
become
an
officer
,
and
so
for
*NL*
friendship
's
sake
he
is
leaving
the
university
and
me
,
his
old
father
,
*NL*
and
entering
the
military
service
,
my
dear
.
And
there
was
a
place
and
*NL*
everything
waiting
for
him
in
the
Archives
Department
!
Is
n't
that
*NL*
friendship
?
''
remarked
the
count
in
an
inquiring
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
say
that
war
has
been
declared
,
''
replied
the
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
been
saying
so
a
long
while
,
''
said
the
count
,
``
and
they
'll
say
*NL*
so
again
and
again
,
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
.
My
dear
,
there
's
*NL*
friendship
for
you
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
He
's
joining
the
hussars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
,
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
at
all
from
friendship
,
''
declared
Nicholas
,
flaring
up
and
*NL*
turning
away
as
if
from
a
shameful
aspersion
.
``
It
is
not
from
friendship
*NL*
at
all
;
I
simply
feel
that
the
army
is
my
vocation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
his
cousin
and
the
young
lady
visitor
;
and
they
were
both
*NL*
regarding
him
with
a
smile
of
approbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Schubert
,
the
colonel
of
the
Pavlograd
Hussars
,
is
dining
with
us
*NL*
today
.
He
has
been
here
on
leave
and
is
taking
Nicholas
back
with
him
.
*NL*
It
ca
n't
be
helped
!
''
said
the
count
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
*NL*
speaking
playfully
of
a
matter
that
evidently
distressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
told
you
,
Papa
,
''
said
his
son
,
``
that
if
you
do
n't
wish
*NL*
to
let
me
go
,
I
'll
stay
.
But
I
know
I
am
no
use
anywhere
except
in
the
*NL*
army
;
I
am
not
a
diplomat
or
a
government
clerk
.
--
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
hide
what
I
feel
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
kept
glancing
with
the
flirtatiousness
*NL*
of
a
handsome
youth
at
Sonya
and
the
young
lady
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
kitten
,
feasting
her
eyes
on
him
,
seemed
ready
at
any
moment
*NL*
to
start
her
gambols
again
and
display
her
kittenish
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
!
''
said
the
old
count
.
``
He
always
flares
up
!
This
*NL*
Buonaparte
has
turned
all
their
heads
;
they
all
think
of
how
he
rose
*NL*
from
an
ensign
and
became
Emperor
.
Well
,
well
,
God
grant
it
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
not
noticing
his
visitor
's
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elders
began
talking
about
Bonaparte
.
Julie
Karagina
turned
to
young
*NL*
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
you
were
n't
at
the
Arkharovs
'
on
Thursday
.
It
was
so
dull
*NL*
without
you
,
''
said
she
,
giving
him
a
tender
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
flattered
,
sat
down
nearer
to
her
with
a
coquettish
*NL*
smile
,
and
engaged
the
smiling
Julie
in
a
confidential
conversation
*NL*
without
at
all
noticing
that
his
involuntary
smile
had
stabbed
the
heart
*NL*
of
Sonya
,
who
blushed
and
smiled
unnaturally
.
In
the
midst
of
his
talk
*NL*
he
glanced
round
at
her
.
She
gave
him
a
passionately
angry
glance
,
and
*NL*
hardly
able
to
restrain
her
tears
and
maintain
the
artificial
smile
on
*NL*
her
lips
,
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
All
Nicholas
'
animation
*NL*
vanished
.
He
waited
for
the
first
pause
in
the
conversation
,
and
then
*NL*
with
a
distressed
face
left
the
room
to
find
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
plainly
all
these
young
people
wear
their
hearts
on
their
sleeves
!
''
*NL*
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
pointing
to
Nicholas
as
he
went
out
.
``
Cousinage
--
*NL*
dangereux
voisinage
;
''
*
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Cousinhood
is
a
dangerous
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
countess
when
the
brightness
these
young
people
had
*NL*
brought
into
the
room
had
vanished
;
and
as
if
answering
a
question
no
*NL*
one
had
put
but
which
was
always
in
her
mind
,
``
and
how
much
suffering

*NL*
how
much
anxiety
one
has
had
to
go
through
that
we
might
rejoice
in

*NL*
now

And
yet
really
the
anxiety
is
greater
now

the
joy

always
anxious

just
at

so
dangerous

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

bringing
up

remarked
the
visitor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

continued
the
countess

``
Till

said
she
,
repeating
the
mistake
of
so
many

imagine
that

have
no

from

``

chimed
in
the
count
,
who
*NL*
always
solved
questions
that
seemed
to
him
perplexing
by
deciding
that
*NL*
everything
was
splendid

``
Takes
after
me
!
And
what
a
*NL*
voice
she
has
;
though
she
's
my
daughter
,
I
tell
the
truth
when
I
say
*NL*
she
'll
be
a
singer
,
a
second
Salomoni
!
We
have
engaged
an
Italian
to
*NL*
give
her
lessons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
she
too
young
?
I
have
heard
that
it
harms
the
voice
to
train
it
*NL*
at
that
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
at
all
too
young
!
''
replied
the
count
.
``
Why
,
our
mothers
used
*NL*
to
be
married
at
twelve
or
thirteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
's
in
love
with
Boris
already
.
Just
fancy
!
''
said
the
countess
*NL*
with
a
gentle
smile
,
looking
at
Boris
and
went
on
,
evidently
concerned
*NL*
with
a
thought
that
always
occupied
her
:
``
Now
you
see
if
I
were
to
be
*NL*
severe
with
her
and
to
forbid
it
...
goodness
knows
what
they
might
be
up
*NL*
to
on
the
sly
''
-LRB-
she
meant
that
they
would
be
kissing
-RRB-
,
``
but
as
it
is
,
I
*NL*
know
every
word
she
utters
.
She
will
come
running
to
me
of
her
own
*NL*
accord
in
the
evening
and
tell
me
everything
.
Perhaps
I
spoil
her
,
but
*NL*
really
that
seems
the
best
plan
.
With
her
elder
sister
I
was
stricter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
brought
up
quite
differently
,
''
remarked
the
handsome
elder
*NL*
daughter
,
Countess
Vera
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
smile
did
not
enhance
Vera
's
beauty
as
smiles
generally
do
;
on
*NL*
the
contrary
it
gave
her
an
unnatural
,
and
therefore
unpleasant
,
*NL*
expression
.
Vera
was
good-looking
,
not
at
all
stupid
,
quick
at
learning
,
*NL*
was
well-brought
up
,
and
had
a
pleasant
voice
;
what
she
said
was
true
*NL*
and
appropriate
,
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
everyone
--
the
visitors
and
*NL*
countess
alike
--
turned
to
look
at
her
as
if
wondering
why
she
had
said
*NL*
it
,
and
they
all
felt
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
are
always
too
clever
with
their
eldest
children
and
try
to
make
*NL*
something
exceptional
of
them

said
the
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
denying
it
,
my
dear
?
Our
dear
countess
was
too
*NL*
clever
with
Vera
,
''
said
the
count
.
``
Well
,
what
of
that
?
She
's
turned
out
*NL*
splendidly
all
the
same

he
added
,
winking
at
Vera
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
got
up
and
took
their
leave
,
promising
to
return
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
manners
!
I
thought
they
would
never
go

the
countess
,
when

she
had
seen
her
guests
out

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Natasha
ran
out
of
the
drawing
room
she
only
went
as
far
as
the
*NL*
conservatory
.
There
she
paused
and
stood
listening
to
the
conversation
*NL*
in
the
drawing
room
,
waiting
for
Boris
to
come
out
.
She
was
already
*NL*
growing
impatient
,
and
stamped
her
foot
,
ready
to
cry
at
his
not
coming
*NL*
at
once
,
when
she
heard
the
young
man
's
discreet
steps
approaching
*NL*
neither
quickly
nor
slowly
.
At
this
Natasha
dashed
swiftly
among
the
*NL*
flower
tubs
and
hid
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
looked
round
,
brushed
a
little
*NL*
dust
from
the
sleeve
of
his
uniform
,
and
going
up
to
a
mirror
examined
*NL*
his
handsome
face
.
Natasha
,
very
still
,
peered
out
from
her
ambush
,
*NL*
waiting
to
see
what
he
would
do
.
He
stood
a
little
while
before
the
*NL*
glass
,
smiled
,
and
walked
toward
the
other
door
.
Natasha
was
about
to
*NL*
call
him
but
changed
her
mind
.
``
Let
him
look
for
me
,
''
thought
she
.
*NL*
Hardly
had
Boris
gone
than
Sonya
,
flushed
,
in
tears
,
and
muttering
*NL*
angrily
,
came
in
at
the
other
door
.
Natasha
checked
her
first
impulse
to
*NL*
run
out
to
her
,
and
remained
in
her
hiding
place
,
watching
--
as
under
an
*NL*
invisible
cap
--
to
see
what
went
on
in
the
world
.
She
was
experiencing
a
*NL*
new
and
peculiar
pleasure
.
Sonya
,
muttering
to
herself
,
kept
looking
*NL*
round
toward
the
drawing-room
door
.
It
opened
and
Nicholas
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
How
can
you
?
''
said
he
,
running
up
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
nothing
;
leave
me
alone
!
''
sobbed
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
know
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
do
,
so
much
the
better
,
and
you
can
go
back
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So-o-onya
!
Look
here
!
How
can
you
torture
me
and
yourself
like
that
,
*NL*
for
a
mere
fancy
?
''
said
Nicholas
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
did
not
pull
it
away
,
and
left
off
crying
.
Natasha
,
not
stirring
*NL*
and
scarcely
breathing
,
watched
from
her
ambush
with
sparkling
eyes
.
*NL*
``
What
will
happen
now
?
''
thought
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
What
is
anyone
in
the
world
to
me
?
You
alone
are
everything
!
''
*NL*
said
Nicholas
.
``
And
I
will
prove
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
you
to
talk
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
wo
n't
;
only
forgive
me
,
Sonya
!
''
He
drew
her
to
him
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
nice
,
''
thought
Natasha
;
and
when
Sonya
and
Nicholas
had
gone
*NL*
out
of
the
conservatory
she
followed
and
called
Boris
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boris
,
come
here
,
''
said
she
with
a
sly
and
significant
look
.
``
I
have
*NL*
something
to
tell
you
.
Here
,
here
!
''
and
she
led
him
into
the
*NL*
conservatory
to
the
place
among
the
tubs
where
she
had
been
hiding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
followed
her
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
something
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
grew
confused
,
glanced
round
,
and
,
seeing
the
doll
she
had
thrown
*NL*
down
on
one
of
the
tubs
,
picked
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
the
doll
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
looked
attentively
and
kindly
at
her
eager
face
,
but
did
not
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
?
Well
,
then
,
come
here
,
''
said
she
,
and
went
further
*NL*
in
among
the
plants
and
threw
down
the
doll
.
``
Closer
,
closer
!
''
she
*NL*
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
the
young
officer
by
his
cuffs
,
and
a
look
of
solemnity
and
*NL*
fear
appeared
on
her
flushed
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
?
Would
you
like
to
kiss
me
?
''
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
,
*NL*
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
brows
,
smiling
,
and
almost
crying
from
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
funny
you
are
!
''
he
said
,
bending
down
to
her
and
blushing
still
*NL*
more
,
but
he
waited
and
did
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
jumped
up
onto
a
tub
to
be
higher
than
he
,
embraced
him
so
*NL*
that
both
her
slender
bare
arms
clasped
him
above
his
neck
,
and
,
tossing
*NL*
back
her
hair
,
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
slipped
down
among
the
flowerpots
on
the
other
side
of
the
tubs
*NL*
and
stood
,
hanging
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
know
that
I
love
you
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
love
with
me
?
''
Natasha
broke
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
,
but
please
do
n't
let
us
do
like
that
...
In
another
four
*NL*
years
...
then
I
will
ask
for
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirteen
,
fourteen
,
fifteen
,
sixteen
,
''
she
counted
on
her
slender
*NL*
little
fingers
.
``
All
right
!
Then
it
's
settled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
of
joy
and
satisfaction
lit
up
her
eager
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Settled
!
''
replied
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forever
?
''
said
the
little
girl
.
``
Till
death
itself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
arm
and
with
a
happy
face
went
with
him
into
the
adjoining
*NL*
sitting
room
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
After
receiving
her
visitors
,
the
countess
was
so
tired
that
she
gave
*NL*
orders
to
admit
no
more
,
but
the
porter
was
told
to
be
sure
to
invite
to
*NL*
dinner
all
who
came
``
to
congratulate
.
''
The
countess
wished
to
have
a
*NL*
tete-a-tete
talk
with
the
friend
of
her
childhood
,
Princess
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
properly
since
she
returned
from
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
with
her
tear-worn
but
pleasant
face
,
drew
*NL*
her
chair
nearer
to
that
of
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
I
will
be
quite
frank
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
``
There
are
not
*NL*
many
left
of
us
old
friends
!
That
's
why
I
so
value
your
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
looked
at
Vera
and
paused
.
The
countess
pressed
her
*NL*
friend
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vera
,
''
she
said
to
her
eldest
daughter
who
was
evidently
not
a
*NL*
favorite
,
``
how
is
it
you
have
so
little
tact
?
Do
n't
you
see
you
are
not
*NL*
wanted
here
?
Go
to
the
other
girls
,
or
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
Vera
smiled
contemptuously
but
did
not
seem
at
all
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
told
me
sooner
,
Mamma
,
I
would
have
gone
,
''
she
replied
as
*NL*
she
rose
to
go
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
passed
the
sitting
room
she
noticed
two
couples
sitting
,
one
*NL*
pair
at
each
window
.
She
stopped
and
smiled
scornfully
.
Sonya
was
*NL*
sitting
close
to
Nicholas
who
was
copying
out
some
verses
for
her
,
the
*NL*
first
he
had
ever
written
.
Boris
and
Natasha
were
at
the
other
window
*NL*
and
ceased
talking
when
Vera
entered
.
Sonya
and
Natasha
looked
at
Vera
*NL*
with
guilty
,
happy
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pleasant
and
touching
to
see
these
little
girls
in
love
;
but
*NL*
apparently
the
sight
of
them
roused
no
pleasant
feeling
in
Vera
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
have
I
asked
you
not
to
take
my
things
?
''
she
said
.
``
You
have
*NL*
a
room
of
your
own
,
''
and
she
took
the
inkstand
from
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
,
in
a
minute
,
''
he
said
,
dipping
his
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
manage
to
do
things
at
the
wrong
time
,
''
continued
Vera
.
``
You
*NL*
came
rushing
into
the
drawing
room
so
that
everyone
felt
ashamed
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
what
she
said
was
quite
just
,
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
no
one
*NL*
replied
,
and
the
four
simply
looked
at
one
another
.
She
lingered
in
the
*NL*
room
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at
your
age
what
secrets
can
there
be
between
Natasha
and
Boris
,
or
*NL*
between
you
two
?
It
's
all
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Vera
,
what
does
it
matter
to
you
?
''
said
Natasha
in
defense
,
*NL*
speaking
very
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
that
day
to
be
more
than
ever
kind
and
affectionate
to
*NL*
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
silly
,
''
said
Vera
.
``
I
am
ashamed
of
you
.
Secrets
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
have
secrets
of
their
own
,
''
answered
Natasha
,
getting
warmer
.
``
We
*NL*
do
n't
interfere
with
you
and
Berg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
,
''
said
Vera
,
``
because
there
can
never
be
anything
*NL*
wrong
in
my
behavior
.
But
I
'll
just
tell
Mamma
how
you
are
behaving
with
*NL*
Boris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natalya
Ilynichna
behaves
very
well
to
me
,
''
remarked
Boris
.
``
I
have
*NL*
nothing
to
complain
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Boris
!
You
are
such
a
diplomat
that
it
is
really
tiresome
,
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
in
a
mortified
voice
that
trembled
slightly
.
-LRB-
She
used
the
word
*NL*
``
diplomat
,
''
which
was
just
then
much
in
vogue
among
the
children
,
in
the
*NL*
special
sense
they
attached
to
it
.
-RRB-
``
Why
does
she
bother
me
?
''
And
she
*NL*
added
,
turning
to
Vera
,
``
You
'll
never
understand
it
,
because
you
've
*NL*
never
loved
anyone
.
You
have
no
heart
!
You
are
a
Madame
de
Genlis
and
*NL*
nothing
more
''
-LRB-
this
nickname
,
bestowed
on
Vera
by
Nicholas
,
was
*NL*
considered
very
stinging
-RRB-
,
``
and
your
greatest
pleasure
is
to
be
*NL*
unpleasant
to
people
!
Go
and
flirt
with
Berg
as
much
as
you
please
,
''
she
*NL*
finished
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
at
any
rate
not
run
after
a
young
man
before
visitors
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
you
've
done
what
you
wanted

put
in
Nicholas
--
``
said
*NL*
unpleasant
things
to
everyone
and
upset
them
.
Let
's
go
to
the
nursery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
four
,
like
a
flock
of
scared
birds
,
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unpleasant
things
were
said
to
me
,
''
remarked
Vera
,
``
I
said
none
to
*NL*
anyone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame

Madame

shouted

*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
Vera
,
who
produced
such
an
irritating
and
unpleasant
effect
*NL*
on
everyone
,
smiled
and
,
evidently
unmoved
by
what
had
been
said
to
her
,
*NL*
went
to
the
looking
glass
and
arranged
her
hair
and
scarf
.
Looking
at
*NL*
her
own
handsome
face
she
seemed
to
become
still
colder
and
calmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing
room
the
conversation
was
still
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
my
life
is
not
all
roses
either

*NL*
Do
n't
I
know
that
at
the
rate
we
are
living
our
means
wo
n't
last
long
?
*NL*
It
's
all
the
Club
and
his
easygoing
nature
.
Even
in
the
country
do
we
*NL*
get
any
rest
?
Theatricals
,
hunting
,
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
!
But
*NL*
do
n't
let
's
talk
about
me
;
tell
me
how
you
managed
everything
.
I
often
*NL*
wonder
at
you
,
Annette

how
at
your
age
you
can
rush
off
alone
in
a
*NL*
carriage
to
Moscow
,
to
Petersburg
,
to
those
ministers
and
great
people
,
*NL*
and
know
how
to
deal
with
them
all
!
It
's
quite
astonishing
.
How
did
you
*NL*
get
things
settled
?
I
could
n't
possibly
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
love

''
answered
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
``
God
grant
you
never
know
what
*NL*
it
is
to
be
left
a
widow
without

with
a
son

love
to
*NL*
distraction

One
learns
many
things
then

she
added
with
a
certain
*NL*
pride
.
``
That
lawsuit
taught
me
much
.
When
I
want
to
see
one
of
those
big

people
I
write
a
note
:
`
Princess
So-and-So
desires
an
interview
with
So
*NL*

and
then
I
take
a
cab

go
myself
two

three

four
times

*NL*

I
get
what
I
want

I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

to
whom
did
you
apply
about
Bory

asked
the
countess

You

see
yours

already
an

There

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Prince
Vasili

He
was
so
kind

He
at
once
agreed

everything

*NL*
put
the
matter
before
the
Emperor

said
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
enthusiastically
,
quite
forgetting
all
the
humiliation
she
had
endured
*NL*
to
gain
her
end

*NL*
*NL*
``
Has

Vasili
aged

asked
the
countess

``
I

with

*NL*

Anna
Mikhaylovna

continued
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
sadly
,
dropping
her
voice

*NL*
``
My

takes
all

not

She
took
out
her

began
to
cry

I
need
five

*NL*
*NL*
The
countess

eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
pondered
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
think
,
though

perhaps
it
's
a
sin

''
said
the
princess
,
``
that

here
lives
Count

so
rich

all
alone

that

tremendous
fortune

what
is
his

worth

It

a
burden
to
him

Bory

life
is
only
just

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven

so
selfish

Still
,
*NL*
I
will
take
Boris
and
go
to
see
him
at
once
,
and
I
shall
speak
to
him
*NL*
straight
out

Let
people
think
what
they
will
of
me

it
's
really
all
the

to
me

The

rose

dine

*NL*
And
like
a
practical
Petersburg
lady
who
knows
how
to
make
the
most
of
*NL*
time
,
Anna
Mikhaylovna
sent
someone
to
call
her

and
went
into
the
*NL*
anteroom
with
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

said
she
to
the

saw
her
to

added
in
a
whisper
so
that
her

should
not
hear

luck

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
Count

said
the
count
*NL*
coming
out
from
the
dining
hall
into
the
anteroom

he
added
:

If

ask

He

danced
with

Be

to
invite
him

We

will
see
how
Taras
distinguishes

He

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Boris
,
''
said
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
to
her
son
as
Countess
*NL*
Rostova
's
carriage
in
which
they
were
seated
drove
over
the
straw
*NL*
covered
street
and
turned
into
the
wide
courtyard
of
Count
Cyril
*NL*
Vladimirovich
Bezukhov
's
house
.
``
My
dear
Boris
,
''
said
the
mother
,
*NL*
drawing
her
hand
from
beneath
her
old
mantle
and
laying
it
timidly
and
*NL*
tenderly
on
her
son
's
arm
,
``
be
affectionate
and
attentive
to
him
.
Count
*NL*
Cyril
Vladimirovich
is
your
godfather
after
all
,
your
future
depends
on
*NL*
him
.
Remember
that
,
my
dear
,
and
be
nice
to
him
,
as
you
so
well
know
how
*NL*
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
I
knew
that
anything
besides
humiliation
would
come
of
it
...
''
*NL*
answered
her
son
coldly
.
``
But
I
have
promised
and
will
do
it
for
your
*NL*
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
hall
porter
saw
someone
's
carriage
standing
at
the
*NL*
entrance
,
after
scrutinizing
the
mother
and
son
-LRB-
who
without
asking
to
*NL*
be
announced
had
passed
straight
through
the
glass
porch
between
the
*NL*
rows
of
statues
in
niches
-RRB-
and
looking
significantly
at
the
lady
's
old
*NL*
cloak
,
he
asked
whether
they
wanted
the
count
or
the
princesses
,
and
,
*NL*
hearing
that
they
wished
to
see
the
count
,
said
his
excellency
was
worse
*NL*
today
,
and
that
his
excellency
was
not
receiving
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
as
well
go
back
,
''
said
the
son
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
exclaimed
his
mother
imploringly
,
again
laying
her
hand
on
*NL*
his
arm
as
if
that
touch
might
soothe
or
rouse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
said
no
more
,
but
looked
inquiringly
at
his
mother
without
taking
*NL*
off
his
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
in
gentle
tones
,
addressing
the
hall
*NL*
porter
,
``
I
know
Count
Cyril
Vladimirovich
is
very
ill
...
that
's
why
I
*NL*
have
come
...
I
am
a
relation
.
I
shall
not
disturb
him
,
my
friend
...
I
*NL*
only
need
see
Prince
Vasili
Sergeevich
:
he
is
staying
here
,
is
he
not
?
*NL*
Please
announce
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
porter
sullenly
pulled
a
bell
that
rang
upstairs
,
and
turned
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
Drubetskaya
to
see
Prince
Vasili
Sergeevich
,
''
he
called
to
a
*NL*
footman
dressed
in
knee
breeches
,
shoes
,
and
a
swallow-tail
coat
,
who
*NL*
ran
downstairs
and
looked
over
from
the
halfway
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
dyed
silk
dress
before
a
large
*NL*
Venetian
mirror
in
the
wall
,
and
in
her
trodden-down
shoes
briskly
*NL*
ascended
the
carpeted
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
she
said
to
her
son
,
once
more
stimulating
him
by
a
touch
,
*NL*
``
you
promised
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
,
lowering
his
eyes
,
followed
her
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
large
hall
,
from
which
one
of
the
doors
led
to
the
*NL*
apartments
assigned
to
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
the
mother
and
son
,
having
reached
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
were
*NL*
about
to
ask
their
way
of
an
elderly
footman
who
had
sprung
up
as
they
*NL*
entered
,
the
bronze
handle
of
one
of
the
doors
turned
and
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
came
out
--
wearing
a
velvet
coat
with
a
single
star
on
his
breast
,
as
was
*NL*
his
custom
when
at
home
--
taking
leave
of
a
good-looking
,
dark-haired
*NL*
man
.
This
was
the
celebrated
Petersburg
doctor
,
Lorrain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
certain
?
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
humanum
est
errare
,
*
but
...
''
replied
the
doctor
,
swallowing
*NL*
his
r
's
,
and
pronouncing
the
Latin
words
with
a
French
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
err
is
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
very
well
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Anna
Mikhaylovna
and
her
son
,
Prince
Vasili
dismissed
the
doctor
*NL*
with
a
bow
and
approached
them
silently
and
with
a
look
of
inquiry
.
The
*NL*
son
noticed
that
an
expression
of
profound
sorrow
suddenly
clouded
his
*NL*
mother
's
face
,
and
he
smiled
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Prince
!
In
what
sad
circumstances
we
meet
again
!
And
how
is
our
*NL*
dear
invalid
?
''
said
she
,
as
though
unaware
of
the
cold
offensive
look
*NL*
fixed
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
stared
at
her
and
at
Boris
questioningly
and
perplexed
.
*NL*
Boris
bowed
politely
.
Prince
Vasili
without
acknowledging
the
bow
turned
*NL*
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
answering
her
query
by
a
movement
of
the
head
and
*NL*
lips
indicating
very
little
hope
for
the
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
?
''
exclaimed
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
``
Oh
,
how
awful
!
It
is
*NL*
terrible
to
think
...
This
is
my
son
,
''
she
added
,
indicating
Boris
.
``
He
*NL*
wanted
to
thank
you
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
bowed
again
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
Prince
,
a
mother
's
heart
will
never
forget
what
you
have
*NL*
done
for
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
I
was
able
to
do
you
a
service
,
my
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna

*NL*
said
Prince
Vasili
,
arranging
his
lace
frill
,
and
in
tone
and
manner
,
*NL*
here
in
Moscow
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
whom
he
had
placed
under
an
*NL*
obligation
,
assuming
an
air
of
much
greater
importance
than
he
had
done
*NL*
in
Petersburg
at
Anna
Scherer
's
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
to
serve
well
and
show
yourself
worthy

''
added
he
,
addressing
Boris
*NL*
with
severity
.
``
I
am
glad
...
Are
you
here
on
leave
?
''
he
went
on
in
his
*NL*
usual
tone
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
awaiting
orders
to
join
my
new
regiment
,
your
excellency
,
''
replied
*NL*
Boris
,
betraying
neither
annoyance
at
the
prince
's
brusque
manner
nor
a
*NL*
desire
to
enter
into
conversation
,
but
speaking
so
quietly
and
*NL*
respectfully
that
the
prince
gave
him
a
searching
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
living
with
your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
living
at
Countess
Rostova

replied
Boris
,
again
adding
,
``
your

excellency

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is

Ilya
Rostov

said
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

I

answered
Prince
Vasili
in
his
monotonous
voice
.
``
I
*NL*
never
could
understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
very

said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
with
a
pathetic
*NL*
smile
,
as
though
she
too
knew
that
Count
Rostov
deserved
this
censure
,
*NL*
but
asked
him
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
poor
old
man
.
``
What
do
the
*NL*
doctors
say
?

asked
the
princess
after
a
pause
,
her
worn
face
again
*NL*
expressing
deep
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
give
little
hope

replied
the
prince

*NL*
*NL*
``

once

she
added
,
her
tone
suggesting
that
this
fact
*NL*
ought
to
give
Prince
Vasili
much
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
became
thoughtful
and
frowned
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
afraid
of
finding
in
her
a
rival
for
Count
Bezukhov
's
fortune
,
*NL*
and
hastened
to
reassure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
not
for
my
sincere
affection
and
devotion
to
Uncle
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
uttering
the
word
with
peculiar
assurance
and
unconcern
,
``
I
know
*NL*
his
character
:
noble
,
upright
...
but
you
see
he
has
no
one
with
him
*NL*
except
the
young
princesses
...
They
are
still
young
...
''
She
bent
her
*NL*
head
and
continued
in
a
whisper
:
``
Has
he
performed
his
final
duty
,
*NL*
Prince
?
How
priceless
are
those
last
moments
!
It
can
make
things
no
*NL*
worse
,
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prepare
him
if
he
is
so
ill
.
We
*NL*
women
,
Prince
,
''
and
she
smiled
tenderly
,
``
always
know
how
to
say
these
*NL*
things
.
I
absolutely
must
see
him
,
however
painful
it
may
be
for
me
.
I
*NL*
am
used
to
suffering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
the
prince
understood
her
,
and
also
understood
,
as
he
had
done
*NL*
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
,
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
rid
of
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
such
a
meeting
be
too
trying
for
him
,
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna
?
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
Let
us
wait
until
evening
.
The
doctors
are
expecting
a
*NL*
crisis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
one
can
not
delay
,
Prince
,
at
such
a
moment
!
Consider
that
the
*NL*
welfare
of
his
soul
is
at
stake
.
Ah
,
it
is
awful
:
the
duties
of
a
*NL*
Christian
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
door
of
one
of
the
inner
rooms
opened
and
one
of
the
princesses
,
the
*NL*
count
's
niece
,
entered
with
a
cold
,
stern
face
.
The
length
of
her
body
*NL*
was
strikingly
out
of
proportion
to
her
short
legs
.
Prince
Vasili
turned
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
the
same
;
but
what
can
you
expect
,
this
noise
...
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
,
looking
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
as
at
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
I
hardly
knew
you
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
with
a
happy
*NL*
smile
,
ambling
lightly
up
to
the
count
's
niece
.
``
I
have
come
,
and
am
at
*NL*
your
service
to
help
you
nurse
my
uncle
.
I
imagine
what
you
have
gone
*NL*
through
,
''
and
she
sympathetically
turned
up
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
gave
no
reply
and
did
not
even
smile
,
but
left
the
room
as
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
took
off
her
gloves
and
,
occupying
the
position
she
had
*NL*
conquered
,
settled
down
in
an
armchair
,
inviting
Prince
Vasili
to
take
a
*NL*
seat
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boris
,
''
she
said
to
her
son
with
a
smile
,
``
I
shall
go
in
to
see
the
*NL*
count
,
my
uncle
;
but
you
,
my
dear
,
had
better
go
to
Pierre
meanwhile
and
*NL*
do
n't
forget
to
give
him
the
Rostovs
'
invitation
.
They
ask
him
to
*NL*
dinner
.
I
suppose
he
wo
n't
go
?
''
she
continued
,
turning
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
replied
the
prince
,
who
had
plainly
become
depressed
,
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
only
too
glad
if
you
relieve
me
of
that
young
man
...
Here
*NL*
he
is
,
and
the
count
has
not
once
asked
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
A
footman
conducted
Boris
down
one
flight
of
*NL*
stairs
and
up
another
,
to
Pierre
's
rooms

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
after
all
,
had
not
managed
to
choose
a
career
for
himself
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
had
been
expelled
from
there
for
riotous
conduct
and
*NL*
sent
to
Moscow
.
The
story
told
about
him
at
Count
Rostov
's
was
true
.
*NL*
Pierre
had
taken
part
in
tying
a
policeman
to
a
bear
.
He
had
now
been
*NL*
for
some
days
in
Moscow
and
was
staying
as
usual
at
his
father
's
house
.
*NL*
Though
he
expected
that
the
story
of
his
escapade
would
be
already
known
*NL*
in
Moscow
and
that
the
ladies
about
his
father
--
who
were
never
favorably
*NL*
disposed
toward
him
--
would
have
used
it
to
turn
the
count
against
him
,
*NL*
he
nevertheless
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
went
to
his
father
's
part
of
*NL*
the
house
.
Entering
the
drawing
room
,
where
the
princesses
spent
most
of
*NL*
their
time
,
he
greeted
the
ladies
,
two
of
whom
were
sitting
at
*NL*
embroidery
frames
while
a
third
read
aloud
.
It
was
the
eldest
who
was
*NL*
reading
--
the
one
who
had
met
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
The
two
younger
ones
were
*NL*
embroidering
:
both
were
rosy
and
pretty
and
they
differed
only
in
that
*NL*
one
had
a
little
mole
on
her
lip
which
made
her
much
prettier
.
Pierre
*NL*
was
received
as
if
he
were
a
corpse
or
a
leper
.
The
eldest
princess
*NL*
paused
in
her
reading
and
silently
stared
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
;
*NL*
the
second
assumed
precisely
the
same
expression
;
while
the
youngest
,
*NL*
the
one
with
the
mole
,
who
was
of
a
cheerful
and
lively
disposition
,
*NL*
bent
over
her
frame
to
hide
a
smile
probably
evoked
by
the
amusing
scene
*NL*
she
foresaw
.
She
drew
her
wool
down
through
the
canvas
and
,
scarcely
*NL*
able
to
refrain
from
laughing
,
stooped
as
if
trying
to
make
out
the
*NL*
pattern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
cousin
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
You
do
n't
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recognize
you
only
too
well
,
too
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
count
?
Can
I
see
him
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
awkwardly
as
usual
,
but
*NL*
unabashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
is
suffering
physically
and
mentally
,
and
apparently
you
have
*NL*
done
your
best
to
increase
his
mental
sufferings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
see
the
count
?
''
Pierre
again
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
If
you
wish
to
kill
him
,
to
kill
him
outright
,
you
can
see
*NL*
him
...
Olga
,
go
and
see
whether
Uncle
's
beef
tea
is
ready
--
it
is
almost
*NL*
time
,
''
she
added
,
giving
Pierre
to
understand
that
they
were
busy
,
and
*NL*
busy
making
his
father
comfortable
,
while
evidently
he
,
Pierre
,
was
only
*NL*
busy
causing
him
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Olga
went
out
.
Pierre
stood
looking
at
the
sisters
;
then
he
bowed
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Then
I
will
go
to
my
rooms
.
You
will
let
me
know
when
I
can
see
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
left
the
room
,
followed
by
the
low
but
ringing
laughter
of
the
*NL*
sister
with
the
mole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Prince
Vasili
had
arrived
and
settled
in
the
count
's
house
.
He
*NL*
sent
for
Pierre
and
said
to
him
:
``
My
dear
fellow
,
if
you
are
going
to
*NL*
behave
here
as
you
did
in
Petersburg
,
you
will
end
very
badly
;
that
is
*NL*
all
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
The
count
is
very
,
very
ill
,
and
you
must
not
*NL*
see
him
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
then
Pierre
had
not
been
disturbed
and
had
spent
the
whole
time
in
*NL*
his
rooms
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Boris
appeared
at
his
door
Pierre
was
pacing
up
and
down
his
room
,
*NL*
stopping
occasionally
at
a
corner
to
make
menacing
gestures
at
the
wall
,
*NL*
as
if
running
a
sword
through
an
invisible
foe
,
and
glaring
savagely
*NL*
over
his
spectacles
,
and
then
again
resuming
his
walk
,
muttering
*NL*
indistinct
words
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
gesticulating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
England
is
done
for
,
''
said
he
,
scowling
and
pointing
his
finger
at
*NL*
someone
unseen
.
``
Mr.
Pitt
,
as
a
traitor
to
the
nation
and
to
the
rights
*NL*
of
man
,
is
sentenced
to
...
''
But
before
Pierre
--
who
at
that
moment
*NL*
imagined
himself
to
be
Napoleon
in
person
and
to
have
just
effected
the
*NL*
dangerous
crossing
of
the
Straits
of
Dover
and
captured
London
--
could
*NL*
pronounce
Pitt
's
sentence
,
he
saw
a
well-built
and
handsome
young
*NL*
officer
entering
his
room
.
Pierre
paused
.
He
had
left
Moscow
when
Boris
*NL*
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
,
and
had
quite
forgotten
him
,
but
in
his
usual
*NL*
impulsive
and
hearty
way
he
took
Boris
by
the
hand
with
a
friendly
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
me
?
''
asked
Boris
quietly
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
``
I
have
*NL*
come
with
my
mother
to
see
the
count
,
but
it
seems
he
is
not
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
seems
he
is
ill
.
People
are
always
disturbing
him
,
''
answered
*NL*
Pierre
,
trying
to
remember
who
this
young
man
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
felt
that
Pierre
did
not
recognize
him
but
did
not
consider
it
*NL*
necessary
to
introduce
himself
,
and
without
experiencing
the
least
*NL*
embarrassment
looked
Pierre
straight
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Rostov
asks
you
to
come
to
dinner
today
,
''
said
he
,
after
a
*NL*
considerable
pause
which
made
Pierre
feel
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Count
Rostov
!
''
exclaimed
Pierre
joyfully
.
``
Then
you
are
his
son
,
*NL*
Ilya
?
Only
fancy
,
I
did
n't
know
you
at
first
.
Do
you
remember
how
we
*NL*
went
to
the
Sparrow
Hills
with
Madame
Jacquot
?
...
It
's
such
an
age
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
''
said
Boris
deliberately
,
with
a
bold
and
slightly
*NL*
sarcastic
smile
.
``
I
am
Boris
,
son
of
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
Drubetskaya
.
Rostov
,
the
father
,
is
Ilya
,
and
his
son
is
Nicholas
.
I
*NL*
never
knew
any
Madame
Jacquot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
shook
his
head
and
arms
as
if
attacked
by
mosquitoes
or
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
what
am
I
thinking
about
?
I
've
mixed
everything
up
.
One
has
so
*NL*
many
relatives
in
Moscow
!
So
you
are
Boris
?
Of
course
.
Well
,
now
we
know
*NL*
where
we
are
.
And
what
do
you
think
of
the
Boulogne
expedition
?
The
*NL*
English
will
come
off
badly
,
you
know
,
if
Napoleon
gets
across
the
*NL*
Channel
.
I
think
the
expedition
is
quite
feasible
.
If
only
Villeneuve
*NL*
does
n't
make
a
mess
of
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
knew
nothing
about
the
Boulogne
expedition
;
he
did
not
read
the
*NL*
papers
and
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
Villeneuve
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
here
in
Moscow
are
more
occupied
with
dinner
parties
and
scandal
*NL*
than
with
politics
,
''
said
he
in
his
quiet
ironical
tone
.
``
I
know
nothing
*NL*
about
it
and
have
not
thought
about
it
.
Moscow
is
chiefly
busy
with
*NL*
gossip
,
''
he
continued
.
``
Just
now
they
are
talking
about
you
and
your
*NL*
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
smiled
in
his
good-natured
way
as
if
afraid
for
his
companion
's
*NL*
sake
that
the
latter
might
say
something
he
would
afterwards
regret
.
But
*NL*
Boris
spoke
distinctly
,
clearly
,
and
dryly
,
looking
straight
into
*NL*
Pierre
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moscow
has
nothing
else
to
do
but
gossip
,
''
Boris
went
on
.
``
Everybody
is
*NL*
wondering
to
whom
the
count
will
leave
his
fortune
,
though
he
may
*NL*
perhaps
outlive
us
all
,
as
I
sincerely
hope
he
will
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
all
very
horrid
,
''
interrupted
Pierre
,
``
very
horrid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
still
afraid
that
this
officer
might
inadvertently
say
*NL*
something
disconcerting
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
must
seem
to
you
,
''
said
Boris
flushing
slightly
,
but
not
*NL*
changing
his
tone
or
attitude
,
``
it
must
seem
to
you
that
everyone
is
*NL*
trying
to
get
something
out
of
the
rich
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
does
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
just
wish
to
say
,
to
avoid
misunderstandings
,
that
you
are
quite
*NL*
mistaken
if
you
reckon
me
or
my
mother
among
such
people
.
We
are
very
*NL*
poor
,
but
for
my
own
part
at
any
rate
,
for
the
very
reason
that
your
*NL*
father
is
rich
,
I
do
n't
regard
myself
as
a
relation
of
his
,
and
neither
*NL*
I
nor
my
mother
would
ever
ask
or
take
anything
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
Pierre
could
not
understand
,
but
when
he
did
,
he
jumped
*NL*
up
from
the
sofa
,
seized
Boris
under
the
elbow
in
his
quick
,
clumsy
way
,
*NL*
and
,
blushing
far
more
than
Boris
,
began
to
speak
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
mingled
shame
and
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
strange
!
Do
you
suppose
I.
.
.
who
could
think
?
...
I
know
*NL*
very
well
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Boris
again
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
I
have
spoken
out
fully
.
Perhaps
you
did
not
like
it
?
You
*NL*
must
excuse
me
,
''
said
he
,
putting
Pierre
at
ease
instead
of
being
put
at
*NL*
ease
by
him
,
``
but
I
hope
I
have
not
offended
you
.
I
always
make
it
a
*NL*
rule
to
speak
out
...
Well
,
what
answer
am
I
to
take
?
Will
you
come
to
*NL*
dinner
at
the
Rostovs
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Boris
,
having
apparently
relieved
himself
of
an
onerous
duty
and
*NL*
extricated
himself
from
an
awkward
situation
and
placed
another
in
it
,
*NL*
became
quite
pleasant
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
say
,
''
said
Pierre
,
calming
down
,
``
you
are
a
wonderful
fellow
!
*NL*
What
you
have
just
said
is
good
,
very
good
.
Of
course
you
do
n't
know
me
.
*NL*
We
have
not
met
for
such
a
long
time
...
not
since
we
were
children
.
You
*NL*
might
think
that
I.
.
.
I
understand
,
quite
understand
.
I
could
not
have
*NL*
done
it
myself
,
I
should
not
have
had
the
courage
,
but
it
's
splendid
.
I
*NL*
am
very
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
.
It
's
queer
,
''
he
added
after
*NL*
a
pause
,
``
that
you
should
have
suspected
me
!
''
He
began
to
laugh
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
what
of
it
!
I
hope
we
'll
get
better
acquainted
,
''
and
he
pressed
Boris
'
*NL*
hand
.
``
Do
you
know
,
I
have
not
once
been
in
to
see
the
count

He
has
not
*NL*
sent
for
me
...
I
am
sorry
for
him
as
a
man
,
but
what
can
one
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
think
Napoleon
will
manage
to
get
an
army
across
?
''
asked
*NL*
Boris
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
saw
that
Boris
wished
to
change
the
subject
,
and
being
of
the
*NL*
same
mind
he
began
explaining
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
*NL*
Boulogne
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
footman
came
in
to
summon
Boris
--
the
princess
was
going
.
Pierre
,
in
*NL*
order
to
make
Boris
'
better
acquaintance
,
promised
to
come
to
dinner
,
*NL*
and
warmly
pressing
his
hand
looked
affectionately
over
his
spectacles
*NL*
into
Boris
'
eyes
.
After
he
had
gone
Pierre
continued
pacing
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
for
a
long
time
,
no
longer
piercing
an
imaginary
foe
with
his
*NL*
imaginary
sword
,
but
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
that
pleasant
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
and
resolute
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
often
happens
in
early
youth
,
especially
to
one
who
leads
a
lonely
*NL*
life
,
he
felt
an
unaccountable
tenderness
for
this
young
man
and
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
that
they
would
be
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
saw
the
princess
off
.
She
held
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
*NL*
and
her
face
was
tearful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
dreadful
,
dreadful
!
''
she
was
saying
,
``
but
cost
me
what
it
may
I
*NL*
shall
do

I
will
come

He
must
not
be

like
this

Every

is
precious

I

think
why
his

put
it

off

Perhaps
God
will
help
me
to
find
a
way
to
prepare
him

God
support

*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu

Prince
Vasili
turning
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
in
a
dreadful
state

said
the
mother
to
her
son
when
they
*NL*
were
in
the
carriage
.
``
He
hardly
recognizes
anybody

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

Mamma

what
is
his

asked
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
will
will
show
that

He

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
After
Anna
Mikhaylovna
had
driven
off
with
her
son
to
visit
Count
Cyril
*NL*
Vladimirovich
Bezukhov
,
Countess
Rostova
sat
for
a
long
time
all
alone
*NL*
applying
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
.
At
last
she
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
my
dear
?
''
she
said
crossly
to
the
maid
who
*NL*
kept
her
waiting
some
minutes
.
``
Do
n't
you
wish
to
serve
me
?
Then
I
'll
*NL*
find
you
another
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
upset
by
her
friend
's
sorrow
and
humiliating
poverty
,
*NL*
and
was
therefore
out
of
sorts
,
a
state
of
mind
which
with
her
always
*NL*
found
expression
in
calling
her
maid
``
my
dear
''
and
speaking
to
her
with
*NL*
exaggerated
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
ma'am
,
''
answered
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
the
count
to
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
came
waddling
in
to
see
his
wife
with
a
rather
guilty
look
as
*NL*
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
little
countess
?
What
a
saute
of
game
au
madere
we
are
to
have
,
*NL*
my
dear
!
I
tasted
it
.
The
thousand
rubles
I
paid
for
Taras
were
not
ill
-
*NL*
spent
.
He
is
worth
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
by
his
wife
,
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
ruffling
*NL*
his
gray
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
your
commands
,
little
countess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
...
What
's
that
mess
?
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
his
*NL*
waistcoat
.
``
It
's
the
saute
,
most
likely
,
''
she
added
with
a
smile
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
you
see
,
Count
,
I
want
some
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
became
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
little
countess
!
''
...
and
the
count
began
bustling
to
get
out
his
*NL*
pocketbook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
great
deal
,
Count
!
I
want
five
hundred
rubles
,
''
and
taking
out
*NL*
her
cambric
handkerchief
she
began
wiping
her
husband
's
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
immediately
,
immediately
!
Hey
,
who
's
there
?
''
he
called
out
in
a
*NL*
tone
only
used
by
persons
who
are
certain
that
those
they
call
will
rush
*NL*
to
obey
the
summons
.
``
Send
Dmitri
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dmitri
,
a
man
of
good
family
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
count
's
*NL*
house
and
now
managed
all
his
affairs
,
stepped
softly
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
want
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
the
count
to
the
deferential
*NL*
young
man
who
had
entered
.
``
Bring
me
...
''
he
reflected
a
moment
,
``
yes
,
*NL*
bring
me
seven
hundred
rubles
,
yes
!
But
mind
,
do
n't
bring
me
such
*NL*
tattered
and
dirty
notes
as
last
time
,
but
nice
clean
ones
for
the
*NL*
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Dmitri
,
clean
ones
,
please
,
''
said
the
countess
,
sighing
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
would
you
like
them
,
your
excellency
?
''
asked
Dmitri
.
``
Allow
me
to
*NL*
inform
you
...
But
,
do
n't
be
uneasy
,
''
he
added
,
noticing
that
the
count
*NL*
was
beginning
to
breathe
heavily
and
quickly
which
was
always
a
sign
of
*NL*
approaching
anger
.
``
I
was
forgetting
...
Do
you
wish
it
brought
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
just
so
!
Bring
it
.
Give
it
to
the
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
treasure
that
Dmitri
is
,
''
added
the
count
with
a
smile
when
the
*NL*
young
man
had
departed
.
``
There
is
never
any
`
impossible
'
with
him
.
*NL*
That
's
a
thing
I
hate
!
Everything
is
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
money
,
Count
,
money
!
How
much
sorrow
it
causes
in
the
world
,
''
said
*NL*
the
countess
.
``
But
I
am
in
great
need
of
this
sum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
my
little
countess
,
are
a
notorious
spendthrift
,
''
said
the
count
,
*NL*
and
having
kissed
his
wife
's
hand
he
went
back
to
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anna
Mikhaylovna
returned
from
Count
Bezukhov
's
the
money
,
all
in
*NL*
clean
notes
,
was
lying
ready
under
a
handkerchief
on
the
countess
'
*NL*
little
table
,
and
Anna
Mikhaylovna
noticed
that
something
was
agitating
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
?
''
asked
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
terrible
state
he
is
in
!
One
would
not
know
him
,
he
is
so
*NL*
ill
!
I
was
only
there
a
few
moments
and
hardly
said
a
word
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annette
,
for
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
refuse
me
,
''
the
countess
began
,
with
a
*NL*
blush
that
looked
very
strange
on
her
thin
,
dignified
,
elderly
face
,
and
*NL*
she
took
the
money
from
under
the
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
instantly
guessed
her
intention
and
stooped
to
be
ready
*NL*
to
embrace
the
countess
at
the
appropriate
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
for
Boris
from
me
,
for
his
outfit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
was
already
embracing
her
and
weeping
.
The
countess
*NL*
wept
too
.
They
wept
because
they
were
friends
,
and
because
they
were
*NL*
kindhearted
,
and
because
they
--
friends
from
childhood
--
had
to
think
*NL*
about
such
a
base
thing
as
money
,
and
because
their
youth
was
over
...
*NL*
But
those
tears
were
pleasant
to
them
both

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Rostova
,
with
her
daughters
and
a
large
number
of
guests
,
was
*NL*
already
seated
in
the
drawing
room
.
The
count
took
the
gentlemen
into
*NL*
his
study
and
showed
them
his
choice
collection
of
Turkish
pipes
.
From
*NL*
time
to
time
he
went
out
to
ask
:
``
Has
n't
she
come
yet
?
''
They
were
*NL*
expecting
Marya
Dmitrievna
Akhrosimova
,
known
in
society
as
le
terrible
*NL*
dragon
,
a
lady
distinguished
not
for
wealth
or
rank
,
but
for
common
*NL*
sense
and
frank
plainness
of
speech
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
known
to
the
*NL*
Imperial
family
as
well
as
to
all
Moscow
and
Petersburg
,
and
both
cities
*NL*
wondered
at
her
,
laughed
privately
at
her
rudenesses
,
and
told
good
*NL*
stories
about
her
,
while
none
the
less
all
without
exception
respected
*NL*
and
feared
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
count
's
room
,
which
was
full
of
tobacco
smoke
,
they
talked
of
war
*NL*
that
had
been
announced
in
a
manifesto
,
and
about
the
recruiting
.
None
*NL*
of
them
had
yet
seen
the
manifesto
,
but
they
all
knew
it
had
appeared
.
*NL*
The
count
sat
on
the
sofa
between
two
guests
who
were
smoking
and
*NL*
talking
.
He
neither
smoked
nor
talked
,
but
bending
his
head
first
to
one
*NL*
side
and
then
to
the
other
watched
the
smokers
with
evident
pleasure
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
conversation
of
his
two
neighbors
,
whom
he
egged
on
*NL*
against
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
was
a
sallow
,
clean-shaven
civilian
with
a
thin
and
wrinkled
*NL*
face
,
already
growing
old
,
though
he
was
dressed
like
a
most
fashionable
*NL*
young
man
.
He
sat
with
his
legs
up
on
the
sofa
as
if
quite
at
home
and
,
*NL*
having
stuck
an
amber
mouthpiece
far
into
his
mouth
,
was
inhaling
the
*NL*
smoke
spasmodically
and
screwing
up
his
eyes
.
This
was
an
old
bachelor
,
*NL*
Shinshin
,
a
cousin
of
the
countess
'
,
a
man
with
``
a
sharp
tongue
''
as
they
*NL*
said
in
Moscow
society
.
He
seemed
to
be
condescending
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
The
latter
,
a
fresh
,
rosy
officer
of
the
Guards
,
irreproachably
washed
,
*NL*
brushed
,
and
buttoned
,
held
his
pipe
in
the
middle
of
his
mouth
and
with
*NL*
red
lips
gently
inhaled
the
smoke
,
letting
it
escape
from
his
handsome
*NL*
mouth
in
rings
.
This
was
Lieutenant
Berg
,
an
officer
in
the
Semenov
*NL*
regiment
with
whom
Boris
was
to
travel
to
join
the
army
,
and
about
whom
*NL*
Natasha
had
teased
her
elder
sister
Vera
,
speaking
of
Berg
as
her
*NL*
``
intended
.
''
The
count
sat
between
them
and
listened
attentively
.
His
*NL*
favorite
occupation
when
not
playing
boston
,
a
card
game
he
was
very
*NL*
fond
of
,
was
that
of
listener
,
especially
when
he
succeeded
in
setting
*NL*
two
loquacious
talkers
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
old
chap
,
mon
tres
honorable
Alphonse
Karlovich
,
''
said
*NL*
Shinshin
,
laughing
ironically
and
mixing
the
most
ordinary
Russian
*NL*
expressions
with
the
choicest
French
phrases
--
which
was
a
peculiarity
of
*NL*
his
speech
.
``
Vous
comptez
vous
faire
des
rentes
sur
l'etat
;
*
you
want
*NL*
to
make
something
out
of
your
company
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
You
expect
to
make
an
income
out
of
the
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Peter
Nikolaevich
;
I
only
want
to
show
that
in
the
cavalry
the
*NL*
advantages
are
far
less
than
in
the
infantry
.
Just
consider
my
own
*NL*
position
now
,
Peter
Nikolaevich
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
always
spoke
quietly
,
politely
,
and
with
great
precision
.
His
*NL*
conversation
always
related
entirely
to
himself
;
he
would
remain
calm
*NL*
and
silent
when
the
talk
related
to
any
topic
that
had
no
direct
bearing
*NL*
on
himself
.
He
could
remain
silent
for
hours
without
being
at
all
put
*NL*
out
of
countenance
himself
or
making
others
uncomfortable
,
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
conversation
concerned
himself
he
would
begin
to
talk
*NL*
circumstantially
and
with
evident
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Consider
my
position
,
Peter
Nikolaevich
.
Were
I
in
the
cavalry
I
should
*NL*
get
not
more
than
two
hundred
rubles
every
four
months
,
even
with
the
*NL*
rank
of
lieutenant
;
but
as
it
is
I
receive
two
hundred
and
thirty
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
looking
at
Shinshin
and
the
count
with
a
joyful
,
pleasant
smile
,
as
*NL*
if
it
were
obvious
to
him
that
his
success
must
always
be
the
chief
*NL*
desire
of
everyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
that
,
Peter
Nikolaevich
,
by
exchanging
into
the
Guards
I
shall
*NL*
be
in
a
more
prominent
position
,
''
continued
Berg
,
``
and
vacancies
occur
*NL*
much
more
frequently
in
the
Foot
Guards
.
Then
just
think
what
can
be
*NL*
done
with
two
hundred
and
thirty
rubles
!
I
even
manage
to
put
a
little
*NL*
aside
and
to
send
something
to
my
father
,
''
he
went
on
,
emitting
a
smoke
*NL*
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
balance
y
est.
.
.
*
A
German
knows
how
to
skin
a
flint
,
as
the
*NL*
proverb
says
,
''
remarked
Shinshin
,
moving
his
pipe
to
the
other
side
of
*NL*
his
mouth
and
winking
at
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
So
that
squares
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
burst
out
laughing
.
The
other
guests
seeing
that
Shinshin
was
*NL*
talking
came
up
to
listen
.
Berg
,
oblivious
of
irony
or
indifference
,
*NL*
continued
to
explain
how
by
exchanging
into
the
Guards
he
had
already
*NL*
gained
a
step
on
his
old
comrades
of
the
Cadet
Corps
;
how
in
wartime
the
*NL*
company
commander
might
get
killed
and
he
,
as
senior
in
the
company
,
*NL*
might
easily
succeed
to
the
post
;
how
popular
he
was
with
everyone
in
*NL*
the
regiment
,
and
how
satisfied
his
father
was
with
him
.
Berg
evidently
*NL*
enjoyed
narrating
all
this
,
and
did
not
seem
to
suspect
that
others
,
*NL*
too
,
might
have
their
own
interests
.
But
all
he
said
was
so
prettily
*NL*
sedate
,
and
the
naivete
of
his
youthful
egotism
was
so
obvious
,
that
he
*NL*
disarmed
his
hearers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
boy
,
you
'll
get
along
wherever
you
go
--
foot
or
horse
--
that
*NL*
I
'll
warrant
,
''
said
Shinshin
,
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
and
taking
his
*NL*
feet
off
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
smiled
joyously
.
The
count
,
by
his
guests
,
went
into
the
drawing
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
the
moment
before
a
big
dinner
when
the
assembled
guests
,
*NL*
expecting
the
summons
to
zakuska
,
*
avoid
engaging
in
any
long
*NL*
conversation
but
think
it
necessary
to
move
about
and
talk
,
in
order
to
*NL*
show
that
they
are
not
at
all
impatient
for
their
food
.
The
host
and
*NL*
hostess
look
toward
the
door
,
and
now
and
then
glance
at
one
another
,
*NL*
and
the
visitors
try
to
guess
from
these
glances
who
,
or
what
,
they
are
*NL*
waiting
for
--
some
important
relation
who
has
not
yet
arrived
,
or
a
dish
*NL*
that
is
not
yet
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

Hors

*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
come
just
at
dinnertime
and
was
sitting
awkwardly
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
drawing
room
on
the
first
chair
he
had
come
across
,
*NL*
blocking
the
way
for
everyone
.
The
countess
tried
to
make
him
talk
,
but
*NL*
he
went
on
naively
looking
around
through
his
spectacles
as
if
in
search
*NL*
of
somebody
and
answered
all
her
questions
in
monosyllables
.
He
was
in
*NL*
the
way
and
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
notice
the
fact
.
Most
of
the
*NL*
guests
,
knowing
of
the
affair
with
the
bear
,
looked
with
curiosity
at
*NL*
this
big
,
stout
,
quiet
man
,
wondering
how
such
a
clumsy
,
modest
fellow
*NL*
could
have
played
such
a
prank
on
a
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
lately
arrived
?
''
the
countess
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oui
,
madame
,
''
replied
he
,
looking
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
yet
seen
my
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Non
,
madame
.
''
He
smiled
quite
inappropriately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
in
Paris
recently
,
I
believe
?
I
suppose
it
's
very
*NL*
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
exchanged
glances
with
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
The
latter
*NL*
understood
that
she
was
being
asked
to
entertain
this
young
man
,
and
*NL*
sitting
down
beside
him
she
began
to
speak
about
his
father
;
but
he
*NL*
answered
her
,
as
he
had
the
countess
,
only
in
monosyllables
.
The
other
*NL*
guests
were
all
conversing
with
one
another
.
``
The
Razumovskis
...
It
was
*NL*
charming
...
You
are
very
kind
...
Countess
Apraksina
...
''
was
heard
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
The
countess
rose
and
went
into
the
ballroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marya
Dmitrievna
?
''
came
her
voice
from
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Herself
,
''
came
the
answer
in
a
rough
voice
,
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
unmarried
ladies
and
even
the
married
ones
except
the
very
*NL*
oldest
rose
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
paused
at
the
door
.
Tall
and
stout
,
*NL*
holding
high
her
fifty-year-old
head
with
its
gray
curls
,
she
stood
*NL*
surveying
the
guests
,
and
leisurely
arranged
her
wide
sleeves
as
if
*NL*
rolling
them
up
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
always
spoke
in
Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Health
and
happiness
to
her
whose
name
day
we
are
keeping
and
to
her
*NL*
children
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
loud
,
full-toned
voice
which
drowned
all
*NL*
others
.
``
Well
,
you
old
sinner
,
''
she
went
on
,
turning
to
the
count
who
*NL*
was
kissing
her
hand
,
``
you
're
feeling
dull
in
Moscow
,
I
daresay
?
Nowhere
*NL*
to
hunt
with
your
dogs
?
But
what
is
to
be
done
,
old
man
?
Just
see
how
*NL*
these
nestlings
are
growing
up
,
''
and
she
pointed
to
the
girls
.
``
You
must
*NL*
look
for
husbands
for
them
whether
you
like
it
or
not
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
's
my
Cossack
?
''
-LRB-
Marya
Dmitrievna
always
called
*NL*
Natasha
a
Cossack
-RRB-
and
she
stroked
the
child
's
arm
as
she
came
up
*NL*
fearless
and
gay
to
kiss
her
hand
.
``
I
know
she
's
a
scamp
of
a
girl
,
but
*NL*
I
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
pair
of
pear-shaped
ruby
earrings
from
her
huge
reticule
and
,
*NL*
having
given
them
to
the
rosy
Natasha
,
who
beamed
with
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
her
saint
's
-
day
fete
,
turned
away
at
once
and
addressed
herself
to
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
eh
,
friend
!
Come
here
a
bit
,
''
said
she
,
assuming
a
soft
high
tone
*NL*
of
voice
.
``
Come
here
,
my
friend
...
''
and
she
ominously
tucked
up
her
*NL*
sleeves
still
higher
.
Pierre
approached
,
looking
at
her
in
a
childlike
*NL*
way
through
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
nearer
,
come
nearer
,
friend
!
I
used
to
be
the
only
one
to
tell
*NL*
your
father
the
truth
when
he
was
in
favor
,
and
in
your
case
it
's
my
*NL*
evident
duty
.
''
She
paused
.
All
were
silent
,
expectant
of
what
was
to
*NL*
follow
,
for
this
was
clearly
only
a
prelude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
lad
!
My
word
!
A
fine
lad
!
...
His
father
lies
on
his
deathbed
and
*NL*
he
amuses
himself
setting
a
policeman
astride
a
bear
!
For
shame
,
sir
,
*NL*
for
shame
!
It
would
be
better
if
you
went
to
the
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
and
gave
her
hand
to
the
count
,
who
could
hardly
keep
*NL*
from
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
it
is
time
we
were
at
table
?
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
went
in
first
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
the
countess
followed
on
*NL*
the
arm
of
a
colonel
of
hussars
,
a
man
of
importance
to
them
because
*NL*
Nicholas
was
to
go
with
him
to
the
regiment
;
then
came
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
with
Shinshin
.
Berg
gave
his
arm
to
Vera
.
The
smiling
Julie
Karagina
*NL*
went
in
with
Nicholas
.
After
them
other
couples
followed
,
filling
the
*NL*
whole
dining
hall
,
and
last
of
all
the
children
,
tutors
,
and
governesses
*NL*
followed
singly
.
The
footmen
began
moving
about
,
chairs
scraped
,
the
*NL*
band
struck
up
in
the
gallery
,
and
the
guests
settled
down
in
their
*NL*
places
.
Then
the
strains
of
the
count
's
household
band
were
replaced
by
*NL*
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
,
the
voices
of
visitors
,
and
the
soft
*NL*
steps
of
the
footmen
.
At
one
end
of
the
table
sat
the
countess
with
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
on
her
right
and
Anna
Mikhaylovna
on
her
left
,
the
*NL*
other
lady
visitors
were
farther
down
.
At
the
other
end
sat
the
count
,
*NL*
with
the
hussar
colonel
on
his
left
and
Shinshin
and
the
other
male
*NL*
visitors
on
his
right
.
Midway
down
the
long
table
on
one
side
sat
the
*NL*
grownup
young
people
:
Vera
beside
Berg
,
and
Pierre
beside
Boris
;
and
on
*NL*
the
other
side
,
the
children
,
tutors
,
and
governesses
.
From
behind
the
*NL*
crystal
decanters
and
fruit
vases
,
the
count
kept
glancing
at
his
wife
*NL*
and
her
tall
cap
with
its
light-blue
ribbons
,
and
busily
filled
his
*NL*
neighbors
'
glasses
,
not
neglecting
his
own
.
The
countess
in
turn
,
*NL*
without
omitting
her
duties
as
hostess
,
threw
significant
glances
from
*NL*
behind
the
pineapples
at
her
husband
whose
face
and
bald
head
seemed
by
*NL*
their
redness
to
contrast
more
than
usual
with
his
gray
hair
.
At
the
*NL*
ladies
'
end
an
even
chatter
of
voices
was
heard
all
the
time
,
at
the
*NL*
men
's
end
the
voices
sounded
louder
and
louder
,
especially
that
of
the
*NL*
colonel
of
hussars
who
,
growing
more
and
more
flushed
,
ate
and
drank
so
*NL*
much
that
the
count
held
him
up
as
a
pattern
to
the
other
guests
.
Berg
*NL*
with
tender
smiles
was
saying
to
Vera
that
love
is
not
an
earthly
but
a
*NL*
heavenly
feeling
.
Boris
was
telling
his
new
friend
Pierre
who
the
guests
*NL*
were
and
exchanging
glances
with
Natasha
,
who
was
sitting
opposite
.
*NL*
Pierre
spoke
little
but
examined
the
new
faces
,
and
ate
a
great
deal
.
Of
*NL*
the
two
soups
he
chose
turtle
with
savory
patties
and
went
on
to
the
*NL*
game
without
omitting
a
single
dish
or
one
of
the
wines
.
These
latter
*NL*
the
butler
thrust
mysteriously
forward
,
wrapped
in
a
napkin
,
from
behind
*NL*
the
next
man
's
shoulders
and
whispered
:
``
Dry
Madeira
''
...
``
Hungarian
''
...
*NL*
or
``
Rhine
wine
''
as
the
case
might
be
.
Of
the
four
crystal
glasses
*NL*
engraved
with
the
count
's
monogram
that
stood
before
his
plate
,
Pierre
*NL*
held
out
one
at
random
and
drank
with
enjoyment
,
gazing
with
ever
-
*NL*
increasing
amiability
at
the
other
guests
.
Natasha
,
who
sat
opposite
,
*NL*
was
looking
at
Boris
as
girls
of
thirteen
look
at
the
boy
they
are
in
*NL*
love
with
and
have
just
kissed
for
the
first
time
.
Sometimes
that
same
*NL*
look
fell
on
Pierre
,
and
that
funny
lively
little
girl
's
look
made
him
*NL*
inclined
to
laugh
without
knowing
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
sat
at
some
distance
from
Sonya
,
beside
Julie
Karagina
,
to
whom
*NL*
he
was
again
talking
with
the
same
involuntary
smile
.
Sonya
wore
a
*NL*
company
smile
but
was
evidently
tormented
by
jealousy
;
now
she
turned
*NL*
pale
,
now
blushed
and
strained
every
nerve
to
overhear
what
Nicholas
and
*NL*
Julie
were
saying
to
one
another
.
The
governess
kept
looking
round
*NL*
uneasily
as
if
preparing
to
resent
any
slight
that
might
be
put
upon
the
*NL*
children
.
The
German
tutor
was
trying
to
remember
all
the
dishes
,
wines
,
*NL*
and
kinds
of
dessert
,
in
order
to
send
a
full
description
of
the
dinner
*NL*
to
his
people
in
Germany
;
and
he
felt
greatly
offended
when
the
butler
*NL*
with
a
bottle
wrapped
in
a
napkin
passed
him
by
.
He
frowned
,
trying
to
*NL*
appear
as
if
he
did
not
want
any
of
that
wine
,
but
was
mortified
because
*NL*
no
one
would
understand
that
it
was
not
to
quench
his
thirst
or
from
*NL*
greediness
that
he
wanted
it
,
but
simply
from
a
conscientious
desire
for
*NL*
knowledge
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
men
's
end
of
the
table
the
talk
grew
more
and
more
animated
.
The
*NL*
colonel
told
them
that
the
declaration
of
war
had
already
appeared
in
*NL*
Petersburg
and
that
a
copy
,
which
he
had
himself
seen
,
had
that
day
been
*NL*
forwarded
by
courier
to
the
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
the
deuce
are
we
going
to
fight
Bonaparte
?
''
remarked
Shinshin
.
*NL*
``
He
has
stopped
Austria
's
cackle
and
I
fear
it
will
be
our
turn
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
was
a
stout
,
tall
,
plethoric
German
,
evidently
devoted
to
*NL*
the
service
and
patriotically
Russian
.
He
resented
Shinshin
's
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
for
the
reasson
,
my
goot
sir
,
''
said
he
,
speaking
with
a
German
*NL*
accent
,
``
for
the
reasson
zat
ze
Emperor
knows
zat
.
He
declares
in
ze
*NL*
manifessto
zat

and
zat
ze
safety
and
dignity

Empire

vell
as
ze

...
''
he
spoke
this
last
word
with
particular
emphasis
as
*NL*
if
in
it
lay
the
gist
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
with
the
unerring
official
memory
that
characterized
him
he
*NL*
repeated
from
the
opening
words
of
the
manifesto
:
*NL*
*NL*
...
and
the
wish
,
which
constitutes
the
Emperor
's
sole
and
absolute
aim
-
*NL*
-
to
establish
peace
in
Europe
on
firm
foundations
--
has
now
decided
him
*NL*
to
despatch
part
of
the
army
abroad
and
to
create
a
new
condition
for
*NL*
the
attainment
of
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zat
,
my
dear
sir
,
is
vy
...
''
he
concluded
,
drinking
a
tumbler
of
wine
*NL*
with
dignity
and
looking
to
the
count
for
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``
Ve
must
vight
to
the
last
tr-r-op
of

''
said
the
colonel
,
*NL*
thumping
the
table
;
``

...
he
dwelt
*NL*
particularly
on
the
word
possible
...
``
as
po-o-ossible

he
ended
,
again
*NL*
turning
to
the
count
.
``
Zat

And
how

a
young
man
and
a
young
hussar
,
how
do
you
*NL*
judge
of
it
?
''
he
added
,
addressing
Nicholas
,
who
when
he
heard
that
the
*NL*
war
was
being
discussed
had
turned
from
his
partner
with
eyes
and
ears
*NL*
intent
on
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
''
replied
Nicholas
,
flaming
up
,
turning
his
*NL*
plate
round
and
moving
his
wineglasses
about
with
as
much
decision
and
*NL*
desperation
as
though
he
were
at
that
moment
facing
some
great
danger
.
*NL*
``
I
am
convinced
that
we
Russians
must
die
or
conquer
,
''
he
concluded
,
*NL*
conscious
--
as
were
others
--
after
the
words
were
uttered
that
his
remarks
*NL*
were
too
enthusiastic
and
emphatic
for
the
occasion
and
were
therefore
*NL*
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
said
just
now
was
splendid
!
''
said
his
partner
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
trembled
all
over
and
blushed
to
her
ears
and
behind
them
and
down
*NL*
to
her
neck
and
shoulders
while
Nicholas
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
listened
to
the
colonel
's
speech
and
nodded
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fine

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man

shouted
the
colonel
,
again
thumping
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
making
such
a
noise
about
over
there
?
''
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
*NL*
deep
voice
suddenly
inquired
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
thumping
the
table
for
?
''
she
demanded
of
the
hussar
,
``
and
why
are
*NL*
you
exciting
yourself
?
Do
you
think
the
French
are
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
speaking
ze

''
replied
the
hussar
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
about
the
war
,
''
the
count
shouted
down
the
table
.
``
You
know
my
*NL*
son

Marya
Dmitrievna

My

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

It
is
all
in

hands
.
You
may
die
in
your
bed
or
God
may
spare
you
in
a
battle
,
''
*NL*
replied
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
deep
voice
,
which
easily
carried
the
whole
*NL*
length
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
the
conversations
concentrated
,
the
ladies
'
at
the
one
end
and
*NL*
the
men
's
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
ask
,
''
Natasha
's
little
brother
was
saying
;
``
I
know
you
wo
n't
*NL*
ask
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
replied
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
suddenly
flushed
with
reckless
and
joyous
resolution
.
She
half
*NL*
rose
,
by
a
glance
inviting
Pierre
,
who
sat
opposite
,
to
listen
to
what
*NL*
was
coming
,
and
turning
to
her
mother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
''
rang
out
the
clear
contralto
notes
of
her
childish
voice
,
*NL*
audible
the
whole
length
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
the
countess
,
startled
;
but
seeing
by
her
daughter
's
*NL*
face
that
it
was
only
mischief
,
she
shook
a
finger
at
her
sternly
with
a
*NL*
threatening
and
forbidding
movement
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
hushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
What
sweets
are
we
going
to
have
?
''
and
Natasha
's
voice
sounded
*NL*
still
more
firm
and
resolute
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
tried
to
frown
,
but
could
not
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
shook
her
*NL*
fat
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cossack
!
''
she
said
threateningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
guests
,
uncertain
how
to
regard
this
sally
,
looked
at
the
*NL*
elders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
take
care
!
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
What
sweets
are
we
going
to
have
?
''
Natasha
again
cried
boldly
,
*NL*
with
saucy
gaiety
,
confident
that
her
prank
would
be
taken
in
good
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
and
fat
little
Petya
doubled
up
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
!
I
have
asked
,
''
whispered
Natasha
to
her
little
brother
and
to
*NL*
Pierre
,
glancing
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ice
pudding
,
but
you
wo
n't
get
any
,
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
saw
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
and
so
she
braved
even
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marya
Dmitrievna
!
What
kind
of
ice
pudding
?
I
do
n't
like
ice
cream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrot
ices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
What
kind
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
?
What
kind
?
''
she
almost
screamed
;
``
I
*NL*
want
to
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
the
countess
burst
out
laughing
,
and
all
the
guests
*NL*
joined
in
.
Everyone
laughed
,
not
at
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
answer
but
at
the
*NL*
incredible
boldness
and
smartness
of
this
little
girl
who
had
dared
to
*NL*
treat
Marya
Dmitrievna
in
this
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
only
desisted
when
she
had
been
told
that
there
would
be
*NL*
pineapple
ice
.
Before
the
ices
,
champagne
was
served
round
.
The
band
*NL*
again
struck
up
,
the
count
and
countess
kissed
,
and
the
guests
,
leaving
*NL*
their
seats
,
went
up
to
``
congratulate
''
the
countess
,
and
reached
across
*NL*
the
table
to
clink
glasses
with
the
count
,
with
the
children
,
and
with
*NL*
one
another
.
Again
the
footmen
rushed
about
,
chairs
scraped
,
and
in
the
*NL*
same
order
in
which
they
had
entered
but
with
redder
faces
,
the
guests
*NL*
returned
to
the
drawing
room
and
to
the
count
's
study
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
The
card
tables
were
drawn
out
,
sets
made
up
for
boston
,
and
the
count
's
*NL*
visitors
settled
themselves
,
some
in
the
two
drawing
rooms
,
some
in
the
*NL*
sitting
room
,
some
in
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
,
holding
his
cards
fanwise
,
kept
himself
with
difficulty
from
*NL*
dropping
into
his
usual
after-dinner
nap
,
and
laughed
at
everything
.
The
*NL*
young
people
,
at
the
countess
'
instigation
,
gathered
round
the
*NL*
clavichord
and
harp
.
Julie
by
general
request
played
first
.
After
she
*NL*
had
played
a
little
air
with
variations
on
the
harp
,
she
joined
the
*NL*
other
young
ladies
in
begging
Natasha
and
Nicholas
,
who
were
noted
for
*NL*
their
musical
talent
,
to
sing
something
.
Natasha
,
who
was
treated
as
*NL*
though
she
were
grown
up
,
was
evidently
very
proud
of
this
but
at
the
*NL*
same
time
felt
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
sing
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
Brook
,
'
''
suggested
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
's
be
quick
.
Boris
,
come
here
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
But
where
*NL*
is
Sonya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
round
and
seeing
that
her
friend
was
not
in
the
room
ran
to
*NL*
look
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Running
into
Sonya
's
room
and
not
finding
her
there
,
Natasha
ran
to
the
*NL*
nursery
,
but
Sonya
was
not
there
either
.
Natasha
concluded
that
she
must
*NL*
be
on
the
chest
in
the
passage
.
The
chest
in
the
passage
was
the
place
*NL*
of
mourning
for
the
younger
female
generation
in
the
Rostov
household
.
*NL*
And
there
in
fact
was
Sonya
lying
face
downward
on
Nurse
's
dirty
feather
*NL*
bed
on
the
top
of
the
chest
,
crumpling
her
gauzy
pink
dress
under
her
,
*NL*
hiding
her
face
with
her
slender
fingers
,
and
sobbing
so
convulsively
*NL*
that
her
bare
little
shoulders
shook
.
Natasha
's
face
,
which
had
been
so
*NL*
radiantly
happy
all
that
saint
's
day
,
suddenly
changed
:
her
eyes
became
*NL*
fixed
,
and
then
a
shiver
passed
down
her
broad
neck
and
the
corners
of
*NL*
her
mouth
drooped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
What
is
it
?
What
is
the
matter
?
...
Oo
...
Oo
...
Oo
...
!
''
And
*NL*
Natasha
's
large
mouth
widened
,
making
her
look
quite
ugly
,
and
she
began
*NL*
to
wail
like
a
baby
without
knowing
why
,
except
that
Sonya
was
crying
.
*NL*
Sonya
tried
to
lift
her
head
to
answer
but
could
not
,
and
hid
her
face
*NL*
still
deeper
in
the
bed
.
Natasha
wept
,
sitting
on
the
blue-striped
*NL*
feather
bed
and
hugging
her
friend
.
With
an
effort
Sonya
sat
up
and
*NL*
began
wiping
her
eyes
and
explaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
is
going
away
in
a
week
's
time
,
his
...
papers
...
have
come
...
*NL*
he
told
me
himself
...
but
still
I
should
not
cry
,
''
and
she
showed
a
*NL*
paper
she
held
in
her
hand
--
with
the
verses
Nicholas
had
written
,
*NL*
``
still
,
I
should
not
cry
,
but
you
ca
n't
...
no
one
can
understand
...
what
*NL*
a
soul
he
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
to
cry
again
because
he
had
such
a
noble
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
...
I
am
not
envious
...
I
love
you
and
Boris
*NL*
also
,
''
she
went
on
,
gaining
a
little
strength
;
``
he
is
nice
...
there
are
*NL*
no
difficulties
in
your
way
...
But
Nicholas
is
my
cousin
...
one
would
*NL*
have
to
...
the
Metropolitan
himself
...
and
even
then
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
*NL*
And
besides
,
if
she
tells
Mamma
''
-LRB-
Sonya
looked
upon
the
countess
as
her
*NL*
mother
and
called
her
so
-RRB-
``
that
I
am
spoiling
Nicholas
'
career
and
am
*NL*
heartless
and
ungrateful
,
while
truly
...
God
is
my
witness
,
''
and
she
*NL*
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
,
``
I
love
her
so
much
,
and
all
of
you
,
only
*NL*
Vera
...
And
what
for
?
What
have
I
done
to
her
?
I
am
so
grateful
to
you
*NL*
that
I
would
willingly
sacrifice
everything
,
only
I
have
nothing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
could
not
continue
,
and
again
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
in
the
*NL*
feather
bed
.
Natasha
began
consoling
her
,
but
her
face
showed
that
she
*NL*
understood
all
the
gravity
of
her
friend
's
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
''
she
suddenly
exclaimed
,
as
if
she
had
guessed
the
true
reason
*NL*
of
her
friend
's
sorrow
,
``
I
'm
sure
Vera
has
said
something
to
you
since
*NL*
dinner
?
Has
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
these
verses
Nicholas
wrote
himself
and
I
copied
some
others
,
and
*NL*
she
found
them
on
my
table
and
said
she
'd
show
them
to
Mamma
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
ungrateful
,
and
that
Mamma
would
never
allow
him
to
marry
me
,
but
*NL*
that
he
'll
marry
Julie
.
You
see
how
he
's
been
with
her
all
day
...
*NL*
Natasha
,
what
have
I
done
to
deserve
it
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
began
to
sob
,
more
bitterly
than
before
.
Natasha
lifted
*NL*
her
up
,
hugged
her
,
and
,
smiling
through
her
tears
,
began
comforting
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
do
n't
believe
her
,
darling
!
Do
n't
believe
her
!
Do
you
remember
*NL*
how
we
and
Nicholas
,
all
three
of
us
,
talked
in
the
sitting
room
after
*NL*
supper
?
Why
,
we
settled
how
everything
was
to
be
.
I
do
n't
quite
remember
*NL*
how
,
but
do
n't
you
remember
that
it
could
all
be
arranged
and
how
nice
*NL*
it
all
was
?
There
's
Uncle
Shinshin
's
brother
has
married
his
first
*NL*
cousin
.
And
we
are
only
second
cousins

you
know

And
Boris
says
it
is
*NL*
quite
possible

You
know
I
have
told
him
all
about
it

And
he
is
so
*NL*
clever
and
so
good

said
Natasha
.
``
Do
n't
you
cry
,
Sonya
,
dear
love
,
*NL*
darling
Sonya
!
''
and
she
kissed
her
and
laughed
.
``
Vera
's
spiteful
;
never
*NL*
mind
her

And
all
will
come
right
and
she
wo

anything
to
Mamma

*NL*
Nicholas
will
tell
her
himself
,
and
he
does

care
at
all
for
Julie

''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
kissed
her
on
the
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
sat
up
.
The
little
kitten
brightened
,
its
eyes
shone
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
ready
to
lift
its
tail
,
jump
down
on
its
soft
paws
,
and
begin
*NL*
playing
with
the
ball
of
worsted
as
a
kitten
should
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
...
Really
?
Truly
?
''
she
said
,
quickly
smoothing
her
*NL*
frock
and
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
truly
!
''
answered
Natasha
,
pushing
in
a
crisp
lock
that
had
*NL*
strayed
from
under
her
friend
's
plaits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
go
and
sing
`
The
Brook
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
that
fat
Pierre
who
sat
opposite
me
is
so
funny
!
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
,
stopping
suddenly
.
``
I
feel
so
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
set
off
at
a
run
along
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
,
shaking
off
some
down
which
clung
to
her
and
tucking
away
the
*NL*
verses
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
close
to
her
bony
little
chest
,
ran
*NL*
after
Natasha
down
the
passage
into
the
sitting
room
with
flushed
face
*NL*
and
light
,
joyous
steps
.
At
the
visitors
'
request
the
young
people
sang
*NL*
the
quartette
,
``
The
Brook
,
''
with
which
everyone
was
delighted
.
Then
*NL*
Nicholas
sang
a
song
he
had
just
learned
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
nighttime
in
the
moon
's
fair
glow
How
sweet
,
as
fancies
wander
free
,
*NL*
To
feel
that
in
this
world
there
's
one
Who
still
is
thinking
but
of
*NL*
thee
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
while
her
fingers
touch
the
harp
Wafting
sweet
music
o'er
the
lea
,
*NL*
It
is
for
thee
thus
swells
her
heart
,
Sighing
its
message
out
to
thee
...
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
,
then
bliss
unspoilt
,
But
oh
!
till
then
I
can
not
live
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
finished
the
last
verse
before
the
young
people
began
to
get
*NL*
ready
to
dance
in
the
large
hall
,
and
the
sound
of
the
feet
and
the
*NL*
coughing
of
the
musicians
were
heard
from
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
sitting
in
the
drawing-room
where
Shinshin
had
engaged
him
,
*NL*
as
a
man
recently
returned
from
abroad
,
in
a
political
conversation
in
*NL*
which
several
others
joined
but
which
bored
Pierre
.
When
the
music
began
*NL*
Natasha
came
in
and
walking
straight
up
to
Pierre
said
,
laughing
and
*NL*
blushing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
told
me
to
ask
you
to
join
the
dancers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
of
mixing
the
figures
,
''
Pierre
replied
;
``
but
if
you
will
be
*NL*
my
teacher
...
''
And
lowering
his
big
arm
he
offered
it
to
the
slender
*NL*
little
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
couples
were
arranging
themselves
and
the
musicians
tuning
up
,
*NL*
Pierre
sat
down
with
his
little
partner
.
Natasha
was
perfectly
happy
;
*NL*
she
was
dancing
with
a
grown-up
man
,
who
had
been
abroad
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
in
a
conspicuous
place
and
talking
to
him
like
a
grown-up
lady
.
*NL*
She
had
a
fan
in
her
hand
that
one
of
the
ladies
had
given
her
to
hold
.
*NL*
Assuming
quite
the
pose
of
a
society
woman
-LRB-
heaven
knows
when
and
where
*NL*
she
had
learned
it
-RRB-
she
talked
with
her
partner
,
fanning
herself
and
*NL*
smiling
over
the
fan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
Just
look
at
her
!
''
exclaimed
the
countess
as
she
crossed
*NL*
the
ballroom
,
pointing
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
blushed
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
Mamma
!
Why
should
you
?
What
is
there
to
be
surprised
at
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
third
ecossaise
there
was
a
clatter
of
chairs
being
*NL*
pushed
back
in
the
sitting
room
where
the
count
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
*NL*
been
playing
cards
with
the
majority
of
the
more
distinguished
and
older
*NL*
visitors
.
They
now
,
stretching
themselves
after
sitting
so
long
,
and
*NL*
replacing
their
purses
and
pocketbooks
,
entered
the
ballroom
.
First
came
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
the
count
,
both
with
merry
countenances
.
The
count
,
*NL*
with
playful
ceremony
somewhat
in
ballet
style
,
offered
his
bent
arm
to
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
He
drew
himself
up
,
a
smile
of
debonair
gallantry
lit
*NL*
up
his
face
and
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
ecossaise
was
ended
,
*NL*
he
clapped
his
hands
to
the
musicians
and
shouted
up
to
their
gallery
,
*NL*
addressing
the
first
violin
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Semen
!
Do
you
know
the
Daniel
Cooper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
count
's
favorite
dance
,
which
he
had
danced
in
his
youth
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Strictly
speaking
,
Daniel
Cooper
was
one
figure
of
the
anglaise
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
Papa
!
''
shouted
Natasha
to
the
whole
company
,
and
quite
*NL*
forgetting
that
she
was
dancing
with
a
grown-up
partner
she
bent
her
*NL*
curly
head
to
her
knees
and
made
the
whole
room
ring
with
her
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
indeed
everybody
in
the
room
looked
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
at
the
*NL*
jovial
old
gentleman
,
who
standing
beside
his
tall
and
stout
partner
,
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
curved
his
arms
,
beat
time
,
straightened
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
turned
out
his
toes
,
tapped
gently
with
his
foot
,
and
,
by
a
*NL*
smile
that
broadened
his
round
face
more
and
more
,
prepared
the
*NL*
onlookers
for
what
was
to
follow
.
As
soon
as
the
provocatively
gay
*NL*
strains
of
Daniel
Cooper
-LRB-
somewhat
resembling
those
of
a
merry
peasant
*NL*
dance
-RRB-
began
to
sound
,
all
the
doorways
of
the
ballroom
were
suddenly
*NL*
filled
by
the
domestic
serfs
--
the
men
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
*NL*
other
--
who
with
beaming
faces
had
come
to
see
their
master
making
merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
at
the
master
!
A
regular
eagle
he
is
!
''
loudly
remarked
the
*NL*
nurse
,
as
she
stood
in
one
of
the
doorways
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
danced
well
and
knew
it
.
But
his
partner
could
not
and
did
not
*NL*
want
to
dance
well
.
Her
enormous
figure
stood
erect
,
her
powerful
arms
*NL*
hanging
down
-LRB-
she
had
handed
her
reticule
to
the
countess
-RRB-
,
and
only
her
*NL*
stern
but
handsome
face
really
joined
in
the
dance
.
What
was
expressed
*NL*
by
the
whole
of
the
count
's
plump
figure
,
in
Marya
Dmitrievna
found
*NL*
expression
only
in
her
more
and
more
beaming
face
and
quivering
nose
.
*NL*
But
if
the
count
,
getting
more
and
more
into
the
swing
of
it
,
charmed
*NL*
the
spectators
by
the
unexpectedness
of
his
adroit
maneuvers
and
the
*NL*
agility
with
which
he
capered
about
on
his
light
feet
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
produced
no
less
impression
by
slight
exertions
--
the
least
effort
to
*NL*
move
her
shoulders
or
bend
her
arms
when
turning
,
or
stamp
her
foot
--
*NL*
which
everyone
appreciated
in
view
of
her
size
and
habitual
severity
.
*NL*
The
dance
grew
livelier
and
livelier
.
The
other
couples
could
not
*NL*
attract
a
moment
's
attention
to
their
own
evolutions
and
did
not
even
*NL*
try
to
do
so
.
All
were
watching
the
count
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
Natasha
*NL*
kept
pulling
everyone
by
sleeve
or
dress
,
urging
them
to
``
look
at
Papa
!
''
*NL*
though
as
it
was
they
never
took
their
eyes
off
the
couple
.
In
the
*NL*
intervals
of
the
dance
the
count
,
breathing
deeply
,
waved
and
shouted
to
*NL*
the
musicians
to
play
faster
.
Faster
,
faster
,
and
faster
;
lightly
,
more
*NL*
lightly
,
and
yet
more
lightly
whirled
the
count
,
flying
round
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
,
now
on
his
toes
,
now
on
his
heels
;
until
,
turning
his
*NL*
partner
round
to
her
seat
,
he
executed
the
final
pas
,
raising
his
soft
*NL*
foot
backwards
,
bowing
his
perspiring
head
,
smiling
and
making
a
wide
*NL*
sweep
with
his
arm
,
amid
a
thunder
of
applause
and
laughter
led
by
*NL*
Natasha
.
Both
partners
stood
still
,
breathing
heavily
and
wiping
their
*NL*
faces
with
their
cambric
handkerchiefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
we
used
to
dance
in
our
time
,
ma
chere
,
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
Daniel
Cooper
!
''
exclaimed
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
tucking
up
her
*NL*
sleeves
and
puffing
heavily
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
While
in
the
Rostovs
'
ballroom
the
sixth
anglaise
was
being
danced
,
to
a
*NL*
tune
in
which
the
weary
musicians
blundered
,
and
while
tired
footmen
and
*NL*
cooks
were
getting
the
supper
,
Count
Bezukhov
had
a
sixth
stroke
.
The
*NL*
doctors
pronounced
recovery
impossible
.
After
a
mute
confession
,
*NL*
communion
was
administered
to
the
dying
man
,
preparations
made
for
the
*NL*
sacrament
of
unction
,
and
in
his
house
there
was
the
bustle
and
thrill
*NL*
of
suspense
usual
at
such
moments
.
Outside
the
house
,
beyond
the
gates
,
*NL*
a
group
of
undertakers
,
who
hid
whenever
a
carriage
drove
up
,
waited
in
*NL*
expectation
of
an
important
order
for
an
expensive
funeral
.
The
Military
*NL*
Governor
of
Moscow
,
who
had
been
assiduous
in
sending
aides-de-camp
to
*NL*
inquire
after
the
count
's
health
,
came
himself
that
evening
to
bid
a
*NL*
last
farewell
to
the
celebrated
grandee
of
Catherine
's
court
,
Count
*NL*
Bezukhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magnificent
reception
room
was
crowded
.
Everyone
stood
up
*NL*
respectfully
when
the
Military
Governor
,
having
stayed
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
alone
with
the
dying
man
,
passed
out
,
slightly
acknowledging
their
*NL*
bows
and
trying
to
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
glances
fixed
*NL*
on
him
by
the
doctors
,
clergy
,
and
relatives
of
the
family
.
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
who
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
during
the
last
few
days
,
*NL*
escorted
him
to
the
door
,
repeating
something
to
him
several
times
in
*NL*
low
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Military
Governor
had
gone
,
Prince
Vasili
sat
down
all
alone
on
*NL*
a
chair
in
the
ballroom
,
crossing
one
leg
high
over
the
other
,
leaning
*NL*
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
.
After
sitting
*NL*
so
for
a
while
he
rose
,
and
,
looking
about
him
with
frightened
eyes
,
*NL*
went
with
unusually
hurried
steps
down
the
long
corridor
leading
to
the
*NL*
back
of
the
house
,
to
the
room
of
the
eldest
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
were
in
the
dimly
lit
reception
room
spoke
in
nervous
*NL*
whispers
,
and
,
whenever
anyone
went
into
or
came
from
the
dying
man
's
*NL*
room
,
grew
silent
and
gazed
with
eyes
full
of
curiosity
or
expectancy
at
*NL*
his
door
,
which
creaked
slightly
when
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
limits
of
human
life
...
are
fixed
and
may
not
be
o'erpassed
,
''
said
*NL*
an
old
priest
to
a
lady
who
had
taken
a
seat
beside
him
and
was
*NL*
listening
naively
to
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
is
it
not
too
late
to
administer
unction
?
''
asked
the
lady
,
*NL*
adding
the
priest
's
clerical
title
,
as
if
she
had
no
opinion
of
her
own
*NL*
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
madam
,
it
is
a
great
sacrament
,
''
replied
the
priest
,
passing
his
*NL*
hand
over
the
thin
grizzled
strands
of
hair
combed
back
across
his
bald
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
?
The
Military
Governor
himself
?
''
was
being
asked
at
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
room
.
``
How
young-looking
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
is
over
sixty
.
I
hear
the
count
no
longer
recognizes
*NL*
anyone
.
They
wished
to
administer
the
sacrament
of
unction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
someone
who
received
that
sacrament
seven
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
princess
had
just
come
from
the
sickroom
with
her
eyes
red
*NL*
from
weeping
and
sat
down
beside
Dr.
Lorrain
,
who
was
sitting
in
a
*NL*
graceful
pose
under
a
portrait
of
Catherine
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
a
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
,
''
said
the
doctor
in
answer
to
a
remark
about
the
weather
.
*NL*
``
The
weather
is
beautiful
,
Princess
;
and
besides
,
in
Moscow
one
feels
as
*NL*
if
one
were
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
replied
the
princess
with
a
sigh
.
``
So
he
may
have
*NL*
something
to
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lorrain
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
taken
his
medicine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
glanced
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
glass
of
boiled
water
and
put
a
pinch
of
cream
of
tartar
,
''
and
*NL*
he
indicated
with
his
delicate
fingers
what
he
meant
by
a
pinch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dere
has
neffer
been
a
gase
,
''
a
German
doctor
was
saying
to
an
aide-de
-
*NL*
camp
,
``
dat
one
liffs
after
de
sird
stroke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
a
well-preserved
man
he
was
!
''
remarked
the
aide-de-camp
.
``
And
*NL*
who
will
inherit
his
wealth
?
''
he
added
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
vo
n't
go
begging
,
''
replied
the
German
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
again
looked
toward
the
door
,
which
creaked
as
the
second
*NL*
princess
went
in
with
the
drink
she
had
prepared
according
to
Lorrain
's
*NL*
instructions
.
The
German
doctor
went
up
to
Lorrain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
can
last
till
morning
?
''
asked
the
German
,
addressing
*NL*
Lorrain
in
French
which
he
pronounced
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lorrain
,
pursing
up
his
lips
,
waved
a
severely
negative
finger
before
*NL*
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tonight
,
not
later
,
''
said
he
in
a
low
voice
,
and
he
moved
away
with
a
*NL*
decorous
smile
of
self-satisfaction
at
being
able
clearly
to
understand
*NL*
and
state
the
patient
's
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Prince
Vasili
had
opened
the
door
into
the
princess
'
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
room
it
was
almost
dark
;
only
two
tiny
lamps
were
burning
before
*NL*
the
icons
and
there
was
a
pleasant
scent
of
flowers
and
burnt
pastilles
.
*NL*
The
room
was
crowded
with
small
pieces
of
furniture
,
whatnots
,
*NL*
cupboards
,
and
little
tables
.
The
quilt
of
a
high
,
white
feather
bed
was
*NL*
just
visible
behind
a
screen
.
A
small
dog
began
to
bark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
is
it
you
,
cousin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
and
smoothed
her
hair
,
which
was
as
usual
so
extremely
smooth
*NL*
that
it
seemed
to
be
made
of
one
piece
with
her
head
and
covered
with
*NL*
varnish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anything
happened
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
am
so
terrified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
there
is
no
change
.
I
only
came
to
have
a
talk
about
business
,
*NL*
Catiche
,
''
*
muttered
the
prince
,
seating
himself
wearily
on
the
chair
*NL*
she
had
just
vacated
.
``
You
have
made
the
place
warm
,
I
must
say
,
''
he
*NL*
remarked
.
``
Well
,
sit
down
:
let
's
have
a
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
perhaps
something
had
happened
,
''
she
said
with
her
unchanging
*NL*
stonily
severe
expression
;
and
,
sitting
down
opposite
the
prince
,
she
*NL*
prepared
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
get
a
nap
,
mon
cousin
,
but
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
?
''
said
Prince
Vasili
,
taking
her
hand
and
bending
it
*NL*
downwards
as
was
his
habit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
this
``
well
?
''
referred
to
much
that
they
both
*NL*
understood
without
naming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
who
had
a
straight
,
rigid
body
,
abnormally
long
for
her
*NL*
legs
,
looked
directly
at
Prince
Vasili
with
no
sign
of
emotion
in
her
*NL*
prominent
gray
eyes
.
Then
she
shook
her
head
and
glanced
up
at
the
icons
*NL*
with
a
sigh
.
This
might
have
been
taken
as
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
*NL*
devotion
,
or
of
weariness
and
hope
of
resting
before
long
.
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
understood
it
as
an
expression
of
weariness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
?
''
he
said
;
``
do
you
think
it
is
easier
for
me
?
I
am
as
worn
out
as
*NL*
a
post
horse
,
but
still
I
must
have
a
talk
with
you
,
Catiche
,
a
very
*NL*
serious
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
said
no
more
and
his
cheeks
began
to
twitch
nervously
,
now
*NL*
on
one
side
,
now
on
the
other
,
giving
his
face
an
unpleasant
expression
*NL*
which
was
never
to
be
seen
on
it
in
a
drawing
room
.
His
eyes
too
seemed
*NL*
strange
;
at
one
moment
they
looked
impudently
sly
and
at
the
next
*NL*
glanced
round
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
holding
her
little
dog
on
her
lap
with
her
thin
bony
*NL*
hands
,
looked
attentively
into
Prince
Vasili
's
eyes
evidently
resolved
*NL*
not
to
be
the
first
to
break
silence
,
if
she
had
to
wait
till
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
my
dear
princess
and
cousin
,
Catherine
Semenovna
,
''
*NL*
continued
Prince
Vasili
,
returning
to
his
theme
,
apparently
not
without
*NL*
an
inner
struggle
;
``
at
such
a
moment
as
this
one
must
think
of
*NL*
everything
.
One
must
think
of
the
future
,
of
all
of
you
...
I
love
you
*NL*
all
,
like
children
of
my
own
,
as
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
continued
to
look
at
him
without
moving
,
and
with
the
same
*NL*
dull
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
of
course
my
family
has
also
to
be
considered
,
''
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
went
on
,
testily
pushing
away
a
little
table
without
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Catiche
,
that
we
--
you
three
sisters
,
Mamontov
,
and
my
wife
--
*NL*
are
the
count
's
only
direct
heirs
.
I
know
,
I
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
*NL*
to
talk
or
think
of
such
matters
.
It
is
no
easier
for
me
;
but
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
I
am
getting
on
for
sixty
and
must
be
prepared
for
anything
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
I
have
sent
for
Pierre
?
The
count
,
''
pointing
to
his
portrait
,
*NL*
``
definitely
demanded
that
he
should
be
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
looked
questioningly
at
the
princess
,
but
could
not
make
*NL*
out
whether
she
was
considering
what
he
had
just
said
or
whether
she
was
*NL*
simply
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
thing
I
constantly
pray
God
to
grant
,
mon
cousin
,
''
she
*NL*
replied
,
``
and
it
is
that
He
would
be
merciful
to
him
and
would
allow
his
*NL*
noble
soul
peacefully
to
leave
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
of
course
,
''
interrupted
Prince
Vasili
impatiently
,
rubbing
*NL*
his
bald
head
and
angrily
pulling
back
toward
him
the
little
table
that
*NL*
he
had
pushed
away
.
``
But
...
in
short
,
the
fact
is
...
you
know
yourself
*NL*
that
last
winter
the
count
made
a
will
by
which
he
left
all
his
*NL*
property
,
not
to
us
his
direct
heirs
,
but
to
Pierre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
made
wills
enough
!
''
quietly
remarked
the
princess
.
``
But
he
*NL*
can
not
leave
the
estate
to
Pierre
.
Pierre
is
illegitimate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
suddenly
,
clutching
the
little
table
*NL*
and
becoming
more
animated
and
talking
more
rapidly
:
``
what
if
a
letter
*NL*
has
been
written
to
the
Emperor
in
which
the
count
asks
for
Pierre
's
*NL*
legitimation
?
Do
you
understand
that
in
consideration
of
the
count
's
*NL*
services
,
his
request
would
be
granted
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
smiled
as
people
do
who
think
they
know
more
about
the
*NL*
subject
under
discussion
than
those
they
are
talking
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
more
,
''
continued
Prince
Vasili
,
seizing
her
hand
,
``
that
*NL*
letter
was
written
,
though
it
was
not
sent
,
and
the
Emperor
knew
of
it
.
*NL*
The
only
question
is
,
has
it
been
destroyed
or
not
?
If
not
,
then
as
soon
*NL*
as
all
is
over
,
''
and
Prince
Vasili
sighed
to
intimate
what
he
meant
by
*NL*
the
words
all
is
over
,
``
and
the
count
's
papers
are
opened
,
the
will
and
*NL*
letter
will
be
delivered
to
the
Emperor
,
and
the
petition
will
certainly
*NL*
be
granted
.
Pierre
will
get
everything
as
the
legitimate
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
share
?
''
asked
the
princess
smiling
ironically
,
as
if
anything
*NL*
might
happen
,
only
not
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
poor
Catiche
,
it
is
as
clear
as
daylight
!
He
will
then
be
the
*NL*
legal
heir
to
everything
and
you
wo
n't
get
anything
.
You
must
know
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
whether
the
will
and
letter
were
written
,
and
whether
they
have
*NL*
been
destroyed
or
not
.
And
if
they
have
somehow
been
overlooked
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
know
where
they
are
,
and
must
find
them
,
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
''
the
princess
interrupted
,
smiling
sardonically
and
not
*NL*
changing
the
expression
of
her
eyes
.
``
I
am
a
woman
,
and
you
think
we
are
*NL*
all
stupid
;
but
I
know
this
:
an
illegitimate
son
can
not
inherit
...
un
*NL*
batard
!
''
*
she
added
,
as
if
supposing
that
this
translation
of
the
word
*NL*
would
effectively
prove
to
Prince
Vasili
the
invalidity
of
his
*NL*
contention
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
bastard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
Catiche
!
Ca
n't
you
understand
!
You
are
so
intelligent
,
*NL*
how
is
it
you
do
n't
see
that
if
the
count
has
written
a
letter
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
begging
him
to
recognize
Pierre
as
legitimate
,
it
follows
that
*NL*
Pierre
will
not
be
Pierre
but
will
become
Count
Bezukhov
,
and
will
then
*NL*
inherit
everything
under
the
will
?
And
if
the
will
and
letter
are
not
*NL*
destroyed
,
then
you
will
have
nothing
but
the
consolation
of
having
been
*NL*
dutiful

tout
ce

That
's
certain

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

And
all
that
follows
therefrom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
will
was
made

I
also
know
that
it

invalid

seem
to
consider
me
a
perfect
fool

said
the
princess
with
*NL*
the
expression
women
assume
when
they
suppose
they
are
saying
something
*NL*
witty
and
stinging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Princess
Catherine
Semenovna
,

began
Prince
Vasili
impatiently
,
*NL*
``
I
came
here
not

wrangle

to
talk

,
a
good
,
kind
,
true
relation
.
And
I
tell
you
for
the
*NL*
tenth
time
that

letter
to

-LRB-
the
family
*NL*
solicitor
-RRB-
``
and
he
says
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
a
sudden
change
evidently
took
place
in
the
princess
'
ideas
;
her
*NL*
thin
lips
grew
white
,
though
her
eyes
did
not
change
,
and
her
voice
when
*NL*
she
began
to
speak
passed
through
such
transitions
as
she
herself
*NL*
evidently
did
not
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
a
fine
thing

said
she
.
``
I
never
wanted
anything

I
*NL*
do
n't
now

*NL*
*NL*
She
pushed
the
little
dog
off
her
lap
and
smoothed
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
gratitude
--
this
is
recognition
for
those
who

she
cried

``
It

``
Yes

replied
*NL*
Prince
Vasili

*NL*
*NL*
But
the

did
not
listen
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
knew
it
long

I
knew

``
Do

Prince

his

twitching
more
than

*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
wished
to
rise
,
but
the
prince
held
her
by
the
hand
.
She
*NL*
had
the
air
of
one
who
has
suddenly
lost
faith
in
the
whole
human
race

*NL*
She
gave
her
companion
an
angry
glance

*NL*
*NL*
``

things
about
us
,
especially
about
*NL*
Sophie
--
I
ca
n't
repeat
them
--
that
it
made
the
count
quite
ill
and
he
*NL*
would
not
see
us
for
a
whole
fortnight
.
I
know
it
was
then
he
wrote
this
*NL*
vile
,
infamous
paper
,
but
I
thought
the
thing
was
invalid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
to
it
at
last
--
why
did
you
not
tell
me
about
it
sooner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
the
inlaid
portfolio
that
he
keeps
under
his
pillow
,
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
,
ignoring
his
question
.
``
Now
I
know
!
Yes
;
if
I
have
a
sin
,
a
*NL*
great
sin
,
it
is
hatred
of
that
vile
woman
!
''
almost
shrieked
the
*NL*
princess
,
now
quite
changed
.
``
And
what
does
she
come
worming
herself
in
*NL*
here
for
?
But
I
will
give
her
a
piece
of
my
mind

The
time
will
come

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
conversations
were
going
on
in
the
reception
room
and
the
*NL*
princess
'
room
,
a
carriage
containing
Pierre
-LRB-
who
had
been
sent
for
-RRB-
and
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
-LRB-
who
found
it
necessary
to
accompany
him
-RRB-
was
driving
*NL*
into
the
court
of
Count
Bezukhov
's
house
.
As
the
wheels
rolled
softly
*NL*
over
the
straw
beneath
the
windows
,
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
having
turned
with
*NL*
words
of
comfort
to
her
companion
,
realized
that
he
was
asleep
in
his
*NL*
corner
and
woke
him
up
.
Rousing
himself
,
Pierre
followed
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
out
of
the
carriage
,
and
only
then
began
to
think
of
the
*NL*
interview
with
his
dying
father
which
awaited
him
.
He
noticed
that
they
*NL*
had
not
come
to
the
front
entrance
but
to
the
back
door
.
While
he
was
*NL*
getting
down
from
the
carriage
steps
two
men
,
who
looked
like
*NL*
tradespeople
,
ran
hurriedly
from
the
entrance
and
hid
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
wall
.
Pausing
for
a
moment
,
Pierre
noticed
several
other
men
of
the
*NL*
same
kind
hiding
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
on
both
sides
.
But
neither
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
nor
the
footman
nor
the
coachman
,
who
could
not
help
*NL*
seeing
these
people
,
took
any
notice
of
them
.
``
It
seems
to
be
all
*NL*
right
,
''
Pierre
concluded
,
and
followed
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
She
hurriedly
*NL*
ascended
the
narrow
dimly
lit
stone
staircase
,
calling
to
Pierre
,
who
*NL*
was
lagging
behind
,
to
follow
.
Though
he
did
not
see
why
it
was
*NL*
necessary
for
him
to
go
to
the
count
at
all
,
still
less
why
he
had
to
go
*NL*
by
the
back
stairs
,
yet
judging
by
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
air
of
assurance
*NL*
and
haste
,
Pierre
concluded
that
it
was
all
absolutely
necessary
.
*NL*
Halfway
up
the
stairs
they
were
almost
knocked
over
by
some
men
who
,
*NL*
carrying
pails
,
came
running
downstairs
,
their
boots
clattering
.
These
*NL*
men
pressed
close
to
the
wall
to
let
Pierre
and
Anna
Mikhaylovna
pass
*NL*
and
did
not
evince
the
least
surprise
at
seeing
them
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
way
to
the
princesses
'
apartments
?
''
asked
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
of
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
a
footman
in
a
bold
loud
voice
,
as
if
anything
were
now
*NL*
permissible
;
``
the
door
to
the
left
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
count
did
not
ask
for
me
,
''
said
Pierre
when
he
reached
the
*NL*
landing
.
``
I
'd
better
go
to
my
own
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
paused
and
waited
for
him
to
come
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
friend
!
''
she
said
,
touching
his
arm
as
she
had
done
her
son
's
*NL*
when
speaking
to
him
that
afternoon
,
``
believe
me
I
suffer
no
less
than
*NL*
you
do
,
but
be
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
really
,
had
n't
I
better
go
away
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
kindly
at
her
*NL*
over
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
friend
!
Forget
the
wrongs
that
may
have
been
done
you
.
*NL*
Think
that
he
is
your
father
...
perhaps
in
the
agony
of
death
.
''
She
*NL*
sighed
.
``
I
have
loved
you
like
a
son
from
the
first
.
Trust
yourself
to
*NL*
me
,
Pierre
.
I
shall
not
forget
your
interests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
understand
a
word
,
but
the
conviction
that
all
this
had
*NL*
to
be
grew
stronger
,
and
he
meekly
followed
Anna
Mikhaylovna
who
was
*NL*
already
opening
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
door
led
into
a
back
anteroom
.
An
old
man
,
a
servant
of
the
*NL*
princesses
,
sat
in
a
corner
knitting
a
stocking
.
Pierre
had
never
been
*NL*
in
this
part
of
the
house
and
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
*NL*
these
rooms
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
addressing
a
maid
who
was
hurrying
past
*NL*
with
a
decanter
on
a
tray
as
``
my
dear
''
and
``
my
sweet
,
''
asked
about
the
*NL*
princess
'
health
and
then
led
Pierre
along
a
stone
passage
.
The
first
*NL*
door
on
the
left
led
into
the
princesses
'
apartments
.
The
maid
with
the
*NL*
decanter
in
her
haste
had
not
closed
the
door
-LRB-
everything
in
the
house
*NL*
was
done
in
haste
at
that
time
-RRB-
,
and
Pierre
and
Anna
Mikhaylovna
in
*NL*
passing
instinctively
glanced
into
the
room
,
where
Prince
Vasili
and
the
*NL*
eldest
princess
were
sitting
close
together
talking
.
Seeing
them
pass
,
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
drew
back
with
obvious
impatience
,
while
the
princess
*NL*
jumped
up
and
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
slammed
the
door
with
all
*NL*
her
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
action
was
so
unlike
her
usual
composure
and
the
fear
depicted
on
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
's
face
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
dignity
that
Pierre
*NL*
stopped
and
glanced
inquiringly
over
his
spectacles
at
his
guide
.
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
evinced
no
surprise
,
she
only
smiled
faintly
and
sighed
,
as
*NL*
if
to
say
that
this
was
no
more
than
she
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
a
man
,
my
friend
.
I
will
look
after
your
interests
,
''
said
she
in
*NL*
reply
to
his
look
,
and
went
still
faster
along
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
could
not
make
out
what
it
was
all
about
,
and
still
less
what
*NL*
``
watching
over
his
interests
''
meant
,
but
he
decided
that
all
these
*NL*
things
had
to
be
.
From
the
passage
they
went
into
a
large
,
dimly
lit
*NL*
room
adjoining
the
count
's
reception
room
.
It
was
one
of
those
sumptuous
*NL*
but
cold
apartments
known
to
Pierre
only
from
the
front
approach
,
but
*NL*
even
in
this
room
there
now
stood
an
empty
bath
,
and
water
had
been
*NL*
spilled
on
the
carpet
.
They
were
met
by
a
deacon
with
a
censer
and
by
a
*NL*
servant
who
passed
out
on
tiptoe
without
heeding
them
.
They
went
into
*NL*
the
reception
room
familiar
to
Pierre
,
with
two
Italian
windows
opening
*NL*
into
the
conservatory
,
with
its
large
bust
and
full
length
portrait
of
*NL*
Catherine
the
Great
.
The
same
people
were
still
sitting
here
in
almost
*NL*
the
same
positions
as
before
,
whispering
to
one
another
.
All
became
*NL*
silent
and
turned
to
look
at
the
pale
tear-worn
Anna
Mikhaylovna
as
she
*NL*
entered
,
and
at
the
big
stout
figure
of
Pierre
who
,
hanging
his
head
,
*NL*
meekly
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
face
expressed
a
consciousness
that
the
decisive
*NL*
moment
had
arrived
.
With
the
air
of
a
practical
Petersburg
lady
she
now
,
*NL*
keeping
Pierre
close
beside
her
,
entered
the
room
even
more
boldly
than
*NL*
that
afternoon
.
She
felt
that
as
she
brought
with
her
the
person
the
*NL*
dying
man
wished
to
see
,
her
own
admission
was
assured
.
Casting
a
rapid
*NL*
glance
at
all
those
in
the
room
and
noticing
the
count
's
confessor
*NL*
there
,
she
glided
up
to
him
with
a
sort
of
amble
,
not
exactly
bowing
yet
*NL*
seeming
to
grow
suddenly
smaller
,
and
respectfully
received
the
blessing
*NL*
first
of
one
and
then
of
another
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
be
thanked
that
you
are
in
time
,
''
said
she
to
one
of
the
priests
;
*NL*
``
all
we
relatives
have
been
in
such
anxiety
.
This
young
man
is
the
*NL*
count
's
son
,
''
she
added
more
softly
.
``
What
a
terrible
moment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
this
she
went
up
to
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
doctor
,
''
said
she
,
``
this
young
man
is
the
count
's
son
.
Is
there
*NL*
any
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
cast
a
rapid
glance
upwards
and
silently
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
with
just
the
same
movement
raised
her
*NL*
shoulders
and
eyes
,
almost
closing
the
latter
,
sighed
,
and
moved
away
*NL*
from
the
doctor
to
Pierre
.
To
him
,
in
a
particularly
respectful
and
*NL*
tenderly
sad
voice
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
in
His
mercy
!
''
and
pointing
out
a
small
sofa
for
him
to
sit
and
*NL*
wait
for
her
,
she
went
silently
toward
the
door
that
everyone
was
*NL*
watching
and
it
creaked
very
slightly
as
she
disappeared
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
having
made
up
his
mind
to
obey
his
monitress
implicitly
,
moved
*NL*
toward
the
sofa
she
had
indicated
.
As
soon
as
Anna
Mikhaylovna
had
*NL*
disappeared
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
all
in
the
room
turned
to
him
*NL*
with
something
more
than
curiosity
and
sympathy
.
He
noticed
that
they
*NL*
whispered
to
one
another
,
casting
significant
looks
at
him
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
awe
and
even
servility
.
A
deference
such
as
he
had
never
before
*NL*
received
was
shown
him
.
A
strange
lady
,
the
one
who
had
been
talking
to
*NL*
the
priests
,
rose
and
offered
him
her
seat
;
an
aide-de-camp
picked
up
*NL*
and
returned
a
glove
Pierre
had
dropped
;
the
doctors
became
respectfully
*NL*
silent
as
he
passed
by
,
and
moved
to
make
way
for
him
.
At
first
Pierre
*NL*
wished
to
take
another
seat
so
as
not
to
trouble
the
lady
,
and
also
to
*NL*
pick
up
the
glove
himself
and
to
pass
round
the
doctors
who
were
not
*NL*
even
in
his
way
;
but
all
at
once
he
felt
that
this
would
not
do
,
and
*NL*
that
tonight
he
was
a
person
obliged
to
perform
some
sort
of
awful
rite
*NL*
which
everyone
expected
of
him
,
and
that
he
was
therefore
bound
to
*NL*
accept
their
services
.
He
took
the
glove
in
silence
from
the
aide-de
-
*NL*
camp
,
and
sat
down
in
the
lady
's
chair
,
placing
his
huge
hands
*NL*
symmetrically
on
his
knees
in
the
naive
attitude
of
an
Egyptian
statue
,
*NL*
and
decided
in
his
own
mind
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
,
and
that
in
*NL*
order
not
to
lose
his
head
and
do
foolish
things
he
must
not
act
on
his
*NL*
own
ideas
tonight
,
but
must
yield
himself
up
entirely
to
the
will
of
*NL*
those
who
were
guiding
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
two
minutes
had
passed
before
Prince
Vasili
with
head
erect
*NL*
majestically
entered
the
room
.
He
was
wearing
his
long
coat
with
three
*NL*
stars
on
his
breast
.
He
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
the
morning
;
*NL*
his
eyes
seemed
larger
than
usual
when
he
glanced
round
and
noticed
*NL*
Pierre
.
He
went
up
to
him
,
took
his
hand
-LRB-
a
thing
he
never
used
to
do
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
drew
it
downwards
as
if
wishing
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
firmly
*NL*
fixed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
,
courage
,
my
friend
!
He
has
asked
to
see
you
.
That
is
well
!
''
*NL*
and
he
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Pierre
thought
it
necessary
to
ask
:
``
How
is
...
''
and
hesitated
,
not
*NL*
knowing
whether
it
would
be
proper
to
call
the
dying
man
``
the
count
,
''
*NL*
yet
ashamed
to
call
him
``
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
another
stroke
about
half
an
hour
ago
.
Courage
,
my
friend
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
mind
was
in
such
a
confused
state
that
the
word
``
stroke
''
*NL*
suggested
to
him
a
blow
from
something
.
He
looked
at
Prince
Vasili
in
*NL*
perplexity
,
and
only
later
grasped
that
a
stroke
was
an
attack
of
*NL*
illness
.
Prince
Vasili
said
something
to
Lorrain
in
passing
and
went
*NL*
through
the
door
on
tiptoe
.
He
could
not
walk
well
on
tiptoe
and
his
*NL*
whole
body
jerked
at
each
step
.
The
eldest
princess
followed
him
,
and
*NL*
the
priests
and
deacons
and
some
servants
also
went
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
Through
that
door
was
heard
a
noise
of
things
being
moved
about
,
and
at
*NL*
last
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
still
with
the
same
expression
,
pale
but
resolute
*NL*
in
the
discharge
of
duty
,
ran
out
and
touching
Pierre
lightly
on
the
arm
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
divine
mercy
is
inexhaustible
!
Unction
is
about
to
be
administered
.
*NL*
Come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
in
at
the
door
,
stepping
on
the
soft
carpet
,
and
noticed
*NL*
that
the
strange
lady
,
the
aide-de-camp
,
and
some
of
the
servants
,
all
*NL*
followed
him
in
,
as
if
there
were
now
no
further
need
for
permission
to
*NL*
enter
that
room
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
well
knew
this
large
room
divided
by
columns
and
an
arch
,
its
*NL*
walls
hung
round
with
Persian
carpets
.
The
part
of
the
room
behind
the
*NL*
columns
,
with
a
high
silk-curtained
mahogany
bedstead
on
one
side
and
on
*NL*
the
other
an
immense
case
containing
icons
,
was
brightly
illuminated
*NL*
with
red
light
like
a
Russian
church
during
evening
service
.
Under
the
*NL*
gleaming
icons
stood
a
long
invalid
chair
,
and
in
that
chair
on
snowy
-
*NL*
white
smooth
pillows
,
evidently
freshly
changed
,
Pierre
saw
--
covered
to
*NL*
the
waist
by
a
bright
green
quilt
--
the
familiar
,
majestic
figure
of
his
*NL*
father
,
Count
Bezukhov
,
with
that
gray
mane
of
hair
above
his
broad
*NL*
forehead
which
reminded
one
of
a
lion
,
and
the
deep
characteristically
*NL*
noble
wrinkles
of
his
handsome
,
ruddy
face
.
He
lay
just
under
the
icons
;
*NL*
his
large
thick
hands
outside
the
quilt
.
Into
the
right
hand
,
which
was
*NL*
lying
palm
downwards
,
a
wax
taper
had
been
thrust
between
forefinger
and
*NL*
thumb
,
and
an
old
servant
,
bending
over
from
behind
the
chair
,
held
it
*NL*
in
position
.
By
the
chair
stood
the
priests
,
their
long
hair
falling
*NL*
over
their
magnificent
glittering
vestments
,
with
lighted
tapers
in
*NL*
their
hands
,
slowly
and
solemnly
conducting
the
service
.
A
little
behind
*NL*
them
stood
the
two
younger
princesses
holding
handkerchiefs
to
their
*NL*
eyes
,
and
just
in
front
of
them
their
eldest
sister
,
Catiche
,
with
a
*NL*
vicious
and
determined
look
steadily
fixed
on
the
icons
,
as
though
*NL*
declaring
to
all
that
she
could
not
answer
for
herself
should
she
glance
*NL*
round
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
with
a
meek
,
sorrowful
,
and
all-forgiving
*NL*
expression
on
her
face
,
stood
by
the
door
near
the
strange
lady
.
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
in
front
of
the
door
,
near
the
invalid
chair
,
a
wax
taper
in
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
was
leaning
his
left
arm
on
the
carved
back
of
a
velvet
chair
*NL*
he
had
turned
round
for
the
purpose
,
and
was
crossing
himself
with
his
*NL*
right
hand
,
turning
his
eyes
upward
each
time
he
touched
his
forehead
.
*NL*
His
face
wore
a
calm
look
of
piety
and
resignation
to
the
will
of
God
.
*NL*
``
If
you
do
not
understand
these
sentiments
,
''
he
seemed
to
be
saying
,
``
so
*NL*
much
the
worse
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
him
stood
the
aide-de-camp
,
the
doctors
,
and
the
menservants
;
the
*NL*
men
and
women
had
separated
as
in
church
.
All
were
silently
crossing
*NL*
themselves
,
and
the
reading
of
the
church
service
,
the
subdued
chanting
*NL*
of
deep
bass
voices
,
and
in
the
intervals
sighs
and
the
shuffling
of
*NL*
feet
were
the
only
sounds
that
could
be
heard
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
importance
that
showed
that
she
felt
she
quite
knew
what
she
was
*NL*
about
,
went
across
the
room
to
where
Pierre
was
standing
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
taper
.
He
lit
it
and
,
distracted
by
observing
those
around
him
,
began
*NL*
crossing
himself
with
the
hand
that
held
the
taper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophie
,
the
rosy
,
laughter-loving
,
youngest
princess
with
the
mole
,
*NL*
watched
him
.
She
smiled
,
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
,
and
remained
*NL*
with
it
hidden
for
awhile
;
then
looking
up
and
seeing
Pierre
she
again
*NL*
began
to
laugh
.
She
evidently
felt
unable
to
look
at
him
without
*NL*
laughing
,
but
could
not
resist
looking
at
him
:
so
to
be
out
of
*NL*
temptation
she
slipped
quietly
behind
one
of
the
columns
.
In
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
service
the
voices
of
the
priests
suddenly
ceased
,
they
whispered
*NL*
to
one
another
,
and
the
old
servant
who
was
holding
the
count
's
hand
got
*NL*
up
and
said
something
to
the
ladies
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
stepped
forward
*NL*
and
,
stooping
over
the
dying
man
,
beckoned
to
Lorrain
from
behind
her
*NL*
back
.
The
French
doctor
held
no
taper
;
he
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
*NL*
columns
in
a
respectful
attitude
implying
that
he
,
a
foreigner
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
differences
of
faith
,
understood
the
full
importance
of
the
rite
*NL*
now
being
performed
and
even
approved
of
it
.
He
now
approached
the
sick
*NL*
man
with
the
noiseless
step
of
one
in
full
vigor
of
life
,
with
his
*NL*
delicate
white
fingers
raised
from
the
green
quilt
the
hand
that
was
*NL*
free
,
and
turning
sideways
felt
the
pulse
and
reflected
a
moment
.
The
*NL*
sick
man
was
given
something
to
drink
,
there
was
a
stir
around
him
,
then
*NL*
the
people
resumed
their
places
and
the
service
continued
.
During
this
*NL*
interval
Pierre
noticed
that
Prince
Vasili
left
the
chair
on
which
he
*NL*
had
been
leaning
,
and
--
with
an
air
which
intimated
that
he
knew
what
he
*NL*
was
about
and
if
others
did
not
understand
him
it
was
so
much
the
worse
*NL*
for
them
--
did
not
go
up
to
the
dying
man
,
but
passed
by
him
,
joined
the
*NL*
eldest
princess
,
and
moved
with
her
to
the
side
of
the
room
where
stood
*NL*
the
high
bedstead
with
its
silken
hangings
.
On
leaving
the
bed
both
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
and
the
princess
passed
out
by
a
back
door
,
but
returned
*NL*
to
their
places
one
after
the
other
before
the
service
was
concluded
.
*NL*
Pierre
paid
no
more
attention
to
this
occurrence
than
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
what
went
on
,
having
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
what
he
saw
*NL*
happening
around
him
that
evening
was
in
some
way
essential
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chanting
of
the
service
ceased
,
and
the
voice
of
the
priest
was
*NL*
heard
respectfully
congratulating
the
dying
man
on
having
received
the
*NL*
sacrament
.
The
dying
man
lay
as
lifeless
and
immovable
as
before
.
Around
*NL*
him
everyone
began
to
stir
:
steps
were
audible
and
whispers
,
among
which
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
was
the
most
distinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
heard
her
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
he
must
be
moved
onto
the
bed
;
here
it
will
be
impossible
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
was
so
surrounded
by
doctors
,
princesses
,
and
servants
that
*NL*
Pierre
could
no
longer
see
the
reddish-yellow
face
with
its
gray
mane
--
*NL*
which
,
though
he
saw
other
faces
as
well
,
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
for
a
*NL*
single
moment
during
the
whole
service
.
He
judged
by
the
cautious
*NL*
movements
of
those
who
crowded
round
the
invalid
chair
that
they
had
*NL*
lifted
the
dying
man
and
were
moving
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catch
hold
of
my
arm
or
you
'll
drop
him
!
''
he
heard
one
of
the
servants
*NL*
say
in
a
frightened
whisper
.
``
Catch
hold
from
underneath
.
Here
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
different
voices
;
and
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
bearers
and
*NL*
the
shuffling
of
their
feet
grew
more
hurried
,
as
if
the
weight
they
*NL*
were
carrying
were
too
much
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
bearers
,
among
whom
was
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
passed
the
young
man
he
*NL*
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
between
their
heads
and
backs
of
the
dying
*NL*
man
's
high
,
stout
,
uncovered
chest
and
powerful
shoulders
,
raised
by
*NL*
those
who
were
holding
him
under
the
armpits
,
and
of
his
gray
,
curly
,
*NL*
leonine
head
.
This
head
,
with
its
remarkably
broad
brow
and
cheekbones
,
*NL*
its
handsome
,
sensual
mouth
,
and
its
cold
,
majestic
expression
,
was
not
*NL*
disfigured
by
the
approach
of
death
.
It
was
the
same
as
Pierre
*NL*
remembered
it
three
months
before
,
when
the
count
had
sent
him
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
But
now
this
head
was
swaying
helplessly
with
the
uneven
*NL*
movements
of
the
bearers
,
and
the
cold
listless
gaze
fixed
itself
upon
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
minutes
'
bustle
beside
the
high
bedstead
,
those
who
had
*NL*
carried
the
sick
man
dispersed
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
touched
Pierre
's
hand
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Come
.
''
Pierre
went
with
her
to
the
bed
on
which
the
sick
man
*NL*
had
been
laid
in
a
stately
pose
in
keeping
with
the
ceremony
just
*NL*
completed
.
He
lay
with
his
head
propped
high
on
the
pillows
.
His
hands
*NL*
were
symmetrically
placed
on
the
green
silk
quilt
,
the
palms
downward
.
*NL*
When
Pierre
came
up
the
count
was
gazing
straight
at
him
,
but
with
a
*NL*
look
the
significance
of
which
could
not
be
understood
by
mortal
man
.
*NL*
Either
this
look
meant
nothing
but
that
as
long
as
one
has
eyes
they
*NL*
must
look
somewhere
,
or
it
meant
too
much
.
Pierre
hesitated
,
not
knowing
*NL*
what
to
do
,
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
his
guide
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
made
*NL*
a
hurried
sign
with
her
eyes
,
glancing
at
the
sick
man
's
hand
and
moving
*NL*
her
lips
as
if
to
send
it
a
kiss
.
Pierre
,
carefully
stretching
his
neck
*NL*
so
as
not
to
touch
the
quilt
,
followed
her
suggestion
and
pressed
his
*NL*
lips
to
the
large
boned
,
fleshy
hand
.
Neither
the
hand
nor
a
single
*NL*
muscle
of
the
count
's
face
stirred
.
Once
more
Pierre
looked
*NL*
questioningly
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
to
see
what
he
was
to
do
next
.
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
with
her
eyes
indicated
a
chair
that
stood
beside
the
bed
.
*NL*
Pierre
obediently
sat
down
,
his
eyes
asking
if
he
were
doing
right
.
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
nodded
approvingly
.
Again
Pierre
fell
into
the
naively
*NL*
symmetrical
pose
of
an
Egyptian
statue
,
evidently
distressed
that
his
*NL*
stout
and
clumsy
body
took
up
so
much
room
and
doing
his
utmost
to
look
*NL*
as
small
as
possible
.
He
looked
at
the
count
,
who
still
gazed
at
the
*NL*
spot
where
Pierre
's
face
had
been
before
he
sat
down
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
indicated
by
her
attitude
her
consciousness
of
the
pathetic
importance
*NL*
of
these
last
moments
of
meeting
between
the
father
and
son
.
This
lasted
*NL*
about
two
minutes
,
which
to
Pierre
seemed
an
hour
.
Suddenly
the
broad
*NL*
muscles
and
lines
of
the
count
's
face
began
to
twitch
.
The
twitching
*NL*
increased
,
the
handsome
mouth
was
drawn
to
one
side
-LRB-
only
now
did
Pierre
*NL*
realize
how
near
death
his
father
was
-RRB-
,
and
from
that
distorted
mouth
*NL*
issued
an
indistinct
,
hoarse
sound
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
looked
attentively
*NL*
at
the
sick
man
's
eyes
,
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
;
she
pointed
*NL*
first
to
Pierre
,
then
to
some
drink
,
then
named
Prince
Vasili
in
an
*NL*
inquiring
whisper
,
then
pointed
to
the
quilt
.
The
eyes
and
face
of
the
*NL*
sick
man
showed
impatience
.
He
made
an
effort
to
look
at
the
servant
who
*NL*
stood
constantly
at
the
head
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wants
to
turn
on
the
other
side
,
''
whispered
the
servant
,
and
got
up
to
*NL*
turn
the
count
's
heavy
body
toward
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
rose
to
help
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
count
was
being
turned
over
,
one
of
his
arms
fell
back
*NL*
helplessly
and
he
made
a
fruitless
effort
to
pull
it
forward
.
Whether
he
*NL*
noticed
the
look
of
terror
with
which
Pierre
regarded
that
lifeless
arm
,
*NL*
or
whether
some
other
thought
flitted
across
his
dying
brain
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
he
glanced
at
the
refractory
arm
,
at
Pierre
's
terror-stricken
face
,
*NL*
and
again
at
the
arm
,
and
on
his
face
a
feeble
,
piteous
smile
appeared
,
*NL*
quite
out
of
keeping
with
his
features
,
that
seemed
to
deride
his
own
*NL*
helplessness
.
At
sight
of
this
smile
Pierre
felt
an
unexpected
quivering
*NL*
in
his
breast
and
a
tickling
in
his
nose
,
and
tears
dimmed
his
eyes
.
The
*NL*
sick
man
was
turned
on
to
his
side
with
his
face
to
the
wall
.
He
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dozing
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
observing
that
one
of
the
*NL*
princesses
was
coming
to
take
her
turn
at
watching
.
``
Let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
now
no
one
in
the
reception
room
except
Prince
Vasili
and
the
*NL*
eldest
princess
,
who
were
sitting
under
the
portrait
of
Catherine
the
*NL*
Great
and
talking
eagerly
.
As
soon
as
they
saw
Pierre
and
his
companion
*NL*
they
became
silent
,
and
Pierre
thought
he
saw
the
princess
hide
*NL*
something
as
she
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
of
that
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catiche
has
had
tea
served
in
the
small
drawing
room
,
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
``
Go
and
take
something
,
my
poor
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
,
or
you
will
not
hold
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Pierre
he
said
nothing
,
merely
giving
his
arm
a
sympathetic
squeeze
*NL*
below
the
shoulder
.
Pierre
went
with
Anna
Mikhaylovna
into
the
small
*NL*
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
so
refreshing
after
a
sleepless
night
as
a
cup
of
this
*NL*
delicious
Russian
tea
,
''
Lorrain
was
saying
with
an
air
of
restrained
*NL*
animation
as
he
stood
sipping
tea
from
a
delicate
Chinese
handleless
cup
*NL*
before
a
table
on
which
tea
and
a
cold
supper
were
laid
in
the
small
*NL*
circular
room
.
Around
the
table
all
who
were
at
Count
Bezukhov
's
house
*NL*
that
night
had
gathered
to
fortify
themselves
.
Pierre
well
remembered
*NL*
this
small
circular
drawing
room
with
its
mirrors
and
little
tables
.
*NL*
During
balls
given
at
the
house
Pierre
,
who
did
not
know
how
to
dance
,
*NL*
had
liked
sitting
in
this
room
to
watch
the
ladies
who
,
as
they
passed
*NL*
through
in
their
ball
dresses
with
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
*NL*
shoulders
,
looked
at
themselves
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
mirrors
which
*NL*
repeated
their
reflections
several
times
.
Now
this
same
room
was
dimly
*NL*
lighted
by
two
candles
.
On
one
small
table
tea
things
and
supper
dishes
*NL*
stood
in
disorder
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
motley
throng
of
*NL*
people
sat
there
,
not
merrymaking
,
but
somberly
whispering
,
and
*NL*
betraying
by
every
word
and
movement
that
they
none
of
them
forgot
what
*NL*
was
happening
and
what
was
about
to
happen
in
the
bedroom
.
Pierre
did
*NL*
not
eat
anything
though
he
would
very
much
have
liked
to
.
He
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
his
monitress
and
saw
that
she
was
again
going
on
tiptoe
*NL*
to
the
reception
room
where
they
had
left
Prince
Vasili
and
the
eldest
*NL*
princess
.
Pierre
concluded
that
this
also
was
essential
,
and
after
a
*NL*
short
interval
followed
her
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
was
standing
beside
the
*NL*
princess
,
and
they
were
both
speaking
in
excited
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
,
Princess
,
to
know
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
not
*NL*
necessary
,
''
said
the
younger
of
the
two
speakers
,
evidently
in
the
same
*NL*
state
of
excitement
as
when
she
had
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
princess
,
''
answered
Anna
Mikhaylovna
blandly
but
*NL*
impressively
,
blocking
the
way
to
the
bedroom
and
preventing
the
other
*NL*
from
passing
,
``
wo
n't
this
be
too
much
for
poor
Uncle
at
a
moment
when
he
*NL*
needs
repose
?
Worldly
conversation
at
a
moment
when
his
soul
is
already
*NL*
prepared
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
was
seated
in
an
easy
chair
in
his
familiar
attitude
,
with
*NL*
one
leg
crossed
high
above
the
other
.
His
cheeks
,
which
were
so
flabby
*NL*
that
they
looked
heavier
below
,
were
twitching
violently
;
but
he
wore
*NL*
the
air
of
a
man
little
concerned
in
what
the
two
ladies
were
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
dear
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
let
Catiche
do
as
she
pleases
.
You
know
*NL*
how
fond
the
count
is
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
even
know
what
is
in
this
paper
,
''
said
the
younger
of
the
two
*NL*
ladies
,
addressing
Prince
Vasili
and
pointing
to
an
inlaid
portfolio
she
*NL*
held
in
her
hand
.
``
All
I
know
is
that
his
real
will
is
in
his
writing
*NL*
table
,
and
this
is
a
paper
he
has
forgotten
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
pass
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
but
the
latter
sprang
so
as
to
bar
*NL*
her
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
my
dear
,
kind
princess
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
seizing
the
*NL*
portfolio
so
firmly
that
it
was
plain
she
would
not
let
go
easily
.
``
Dear
*NL*
princess
,
I
beg
and
implore
you
,
have
some
pity
on
him
!
Je
vous
en
*NL*
conjure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
did
not
reply
.
Their
efforts
in
the
struggle
for
the
*NL*
portfolio
were
the
only
sounds
audible
,
but
it
was
evident
that
if
the
*NL*
princess
did
speak
,
her
words
would
not
be
flattering
to
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
.
Though
the
latter
held
on
tenaciously
,
her
voice
lost
none
*NL*
of
its
honeyed
firmness
and
softness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierre
,
my
dear
,
come
here
.
I
think
he
will
not
be
out
of
place
in
a
*NL*
family
consultation
;
is
it
not
so
,
Prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
speak
,
cousin
?
''
suddenly
shrieked
the
princess
so
loud
*NL*
that
those
in
the
drawing
room
heard
her
and
were
startled
.
``
Why
do
you
*NL*
remain
silent
when
heaven
knows
who
permits
herself
to
interfere
,
making
*NL*
a
scene
on
the
very
threshold
of
a
dying
man
's
room
?
Intriguer
!
''
she
*NL*
hissed
viciously
,
and
tugged
with
all
her
might
at
the
portfolio
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anna
Mikhaylovna
went
forward
a
step
or
two
to
keep
her
hold
on
the
*NL*
portfolio
,
and
changed
her
grip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
rose
.
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
with
reproach
and
surprise
,
``
this
is
*NL*
absurd
!
Come
,
let
go
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
let
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anna
Mikhaylovna
did
not
obey
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
,
I
tell
you
!
I
will
take
the
responsibility
.
I
myself
will
go
*NL*
and
ask
him
,
I
!
...
does
that
satisfy
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Prince
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
``
after
such
a
solemn
sacrament
,
*NL*
allow
him
a
moment
's
peace
!
Here
,
Pierre
,
tell
them
your
opinion
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
turning
to
the
young
man
who
,
having
come
quite
close
,
was
gazing
*NL*
with
astonishment
at
the
angry
face
of
the
princess
which
had
lost
all
*NL*
dignity
,
and
at
the
twitching
cheeks
of
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
that
you
will
answer
for
the
consequences
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
severely
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
are
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vile
woman
!
''
shouted
the
princess
,
darting
unexpectedly
at
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
and
snatching
the
portfolio
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
bent
his
head
and
spread
out
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
that
terrible
door
,
which
Pierre
had
watched
so
long
and
*NL*
which
had
always
opened
so
quietly
,
burst
noisily
open
and
banged
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
and
the
second
of
the
three
sisters
rushed
out
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
!
''
she
cried
vehemently
.
``
He
is
dying
and
you
leave
*NL*
me
alone
with
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sister
dropped
the
portfolio
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
stooping
,
quickly
*NL*
caught
up
the
object
of
contention
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
.
The
eldest
*NL*
princess
and
Prince
Vasili
,
recovering
themselves
,
followed
her
.
A
few
*NL*
minutes
later
the
eldest
sister
came
out
with
a
pale
hard
face
,
again
*NL*
biting
her
underlip
.
At
sight
of
Pierre
her
expression
showed
an
*NL*
irrepressible
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
you
may
be
glad
!
''
said
she
;
``
this
is
what
you
have
been
*NL*
waiting
for
.
''
And
bursting
into
tears
she
hid
her
face
in
her
*NL*
handkerchief
and
rushed
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
came
next
.
He
staggered
to
the
sofa
on
which
Pierre
was
*NL*
sitting
and
dropped
onto
it
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hand
.
Pierre
*NL*
noticed
that
he
was
pale
and
that
his
jaw
quivered
and
shook
as
if
in
an
*NL*
ague
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
friend
!
''
said
he
,
taking
Pierre
by
the
elbow
;
and
there
was
in
*NL*
his
voice
a
sincerity
and
weakness
Pierre
had
never
observed
in
it
*NL*
before
.
``
How
often
we
sin
,
how
much
we
deceive
,
and
all
for
what
?
I
am
*NL*
near
sixty
,
dear
friend
...
I
too
...
All
will
end
in
death
,
all
!
Death
is
*NL*
awful
...
''
and
he
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
came
out
last
.
She
approached
Pierre
with
slow
,
quiet
*NL*
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierre
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gave
her
an
inquiring
look
.
She
kissed
the
young
man
on
his
*NL*
forehead
,
wetting
him
with
her
tears
.
Then
after
a
pause
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
no
more
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
her
over
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
I
will
go
with
you
.
Try
to
weep
,
nothing
gives
such
relief
as
*NL*
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
him
into
the
dark
drawing
room
and
Pierre
was
glad
no
one
could
*NL*
see
his
face
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
left
him
,
and
when
she
returned
he
was
*NL*
fast
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Anna
Mikhaylovna
said
to
Pierre
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
this
is
a
great
loss
for
us
all
,
not
to
speak
of
you
.
But
*NL*
God
will
support
you
:
you
are
young
,
and
are
now
,
I
hope
,
in
command
of
*NL*
an
immense
fortune
.
The
will
has
not
yet
been
opened
.
I
know
you
well
*NL*
enough
to
be
sure
that
this
will
not
turn
your
head
,
but
it
imposes
*NL*
duties
on
you
,
and
you
must
be
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
later
on
I
may
tell
you
,
my
dear
boy
,
that
if
I
had
not
been
*NL*
there
,
God
only
knows
what
would
have
happened
!
You
know
,
Uncle
promised
*NL*
me
only
the
day
before
yesterday
not
to
forget
Boris
.
But
he
had
no
*NL*
time
.
I
hope
,
my
dear
friend
,
you
will
carry
out
your
father
's
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
understood
nothing
of
all
this
and
coloring
shyly
looked
in
*NL*
silence
at
Princess
Anna
Mikhaylovna
.
After
her
talk
with
Pierre
,
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
returned
to
the
Rostovs
'
and
went
to
bed
.
On
waking
in
the
*NL*
morning
she
told
the
Rostovs
and
all
her
acquaintances
the
details
of
*NL*
Count
Bezukhov
's
death
.
She
said
the
count
had
died
as
she
would
herself
*NL*
wish
to
die
,
that
his
end
was
not
only
touching
but
edifying
.
As
to
the
*NL*
last
meeting
between
father
and
son
,
it
was
so
touching
that
she
could
*NL*
not
think
of
it
without
tears
,
and
did
not
know
which
had
behaved
better
*NL*
during
those
awful
moments
--
the
father
who
so
remembered
everything
and
*NL*
everybody
at
last
and
had
spoken
such
pathetic
words
to
the
son
,
or
*NL*
Pierre
,
whom
it
had
been
pitiful
to
see
,
so
stricken
was
he
with
grief
,
*NL*
though
he
tried
hard
to
hide
it
in
order
not
to
sadden
his
dying
father
.
*NL*
``
It
is
painful
,
but
it
does
one
good
.
It
uplifts
the
soul
to
see
such
*NL*
men
as
the
old
count
and
his
worthy
son
,
''
said
she
.
Of
the
behavior
of
*NL*
the
eldest
princess
and
Prince
Vasili
she
spoke
disapprovingly
,
but
in
*NL*
whispers
and
as
a
great
secret
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
At
Bald
Hills
,
Prince
Nicholas
Andreevich
Bolkonski
's
estate
,
the
*NL*
arrival
of
young
Prince
Andrew
and
his
wife
was
daily
expected
,
but
this
*NL*
expectation
did
not
upset
the
regular
routine
of
life
in
the
old
*NL*
prince
's
household
.
General
in
Chief
Prince
Nicholas
Andreevich
*NL*
-LRB-
nicknamed
in
society
,
``
the
King
of
Prussia
''
-RRB-
ever
since
the
Emperor
*NL*
Paul
had
exiled
him
to
his
country
estate
had
lived
there
continuously
*NL*
with
his
daughter
,
Princess
Mary
,
and
her
companion
,
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
.
Though
in
the
new
reign
he
was
free
to
return
to
the
*NL*
capitals
,
he
still
continued
to
live
in
the
country
,
remarking
that
*NL*
anyone
who
wanted
to
see
him
could
come
the
hundred
miles
from
Moscow
to
*NL*
Bald
Hills
,
while
he
himself
needed
no
one
and
nothing
.
He
used
to
say
*NL*
that
there
are
only
two
sources
of
human
vice
--
idleness
and
*NL*
superstition
,
and
only
two
virtues
--
activity
and
intelligence
.
He
*NL*
himself
undertook
his
daughter
's
education
,
and
to
develop
these
two
*NL*
cardinal
virtues
in
her
gave
her
lessons
in
algebra
and
geometry
till
*NL*
she
was
twenty
,
and
arranged
her
life
so
that
her
whole
time
was
*NL*
occupied
.
He
was
himself
always
occupied
:
writing
his
memoirs
,
solving
*NL*
problems
in
higher
mathematics
,
turning
snuffboxes
on
a
lathe
,
working
*NL*
in
the
garden
,
or
superintending
the
building
that
was
always
going
on
*NL*
at
his
estate
.
As
regularity
is
a
prime
condition
facilitating
activity
,
*NL*
regularity
in
his
household
was
carried
to
the
highest
point
of
*NL*
exactitude
.
He
always
came
to
table
under
precisely
the
same
conditions
,
*NL*
and
not
only
at
the
same
hour
but
at
the
same
minute
.
With
those
about
*NL*
him
,
from
his
daughter
to
his
serfs
,
the
prince
was
sharp
and
invariably
*NL*
exacting
,
so
that
without
being
a
hardhearted
man
he
inspired
such
fear
*NL*
and
respect
as
few
hardhearted
men
would
have
aroused
.
Although
he
was
*NL*
in
retirement
and
had
now
no
influence
in
political
affairs
,
every
high
*NL*
official
appointed
to
the
province
in
which
the
prince
's
estate
lay
*NL*
considered
it
his
duty
to
visit
him
and
waited
in
the
lofty
antechamber
*NL*
just
as
the
architect
,
gardener
,
or
Princess
Mary
did
,
till
the
prince
*NL*
appeared
punctually
to
the
appointed
hour
.
Everyone
sitting
in
this
*NL*
antechamber
experienced
the
same
feeling
of
respect
and
even
fear
when
*NL*
the
enormously
high
study
door
opened
and
showed
the
figure
of
a
rather
*NL*
small
old
man
,
with
powdered
wig
,
small
withered
hands
,
and
bushy
gray
*NL*
eyebrows
which
,
when
he
frowned
,
sometimes
hid
the
gleam
of
his
shrewd
,
*NL*
youthfully
glittering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
day
that
the
young
couple
were
to
arrive
,
Princess
*NL*
Mary
entered
the
antechamber
as
usual
at
the
time
appointed
for
the
*NL*
morning
greeting
,
crossing
herself
with
trepidation
and
repeating
a
*NL*
silent
prayer
.
Every
morning
she
came
in
like
that
,
and
every
morning
*NL*
prayed
that
the
daily
interview
might
pass
off
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
powdered
manservant
who
was
sitting
in
the
antechamber
rose
*NL*
quietly
and
said
in
a
whisper
:
``
Please
walk
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
door
came
the
regular
hum
of
a
lathe
.
The
princess
timidly
*NL*
opened
the
door
which
moved
noiselessly
and
easily
.
She
paused
at
the
*NL*
entrance
.
The
prince
was
working
at
the
lathe
and
after
glancing
round
*NL*
continued
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
enormous
study
was
full
of
things
evidently
in
constant
use
.
The
*NL*
large
table
covered
with
books
and
plans
,
the
tall
glass-fronted
*NL*
bookcases
with
keys
in
the
locks
,
the
high
desk
for
writing
while
*NL*
standing
up
,
on
which
lay
an
open
exercise
book
,
and
the
lathe
with
*NL*
tools
laid
ready
to
hand
and
shavings
scattered
around
--
all
indicated
*NL*
continuous
,
varied
,
and
orderly
activity
.
The
motion
of
the
small
foot
*NL*
shod
in
a
Tartar
boot
embroidered
with
silver
,
and
the
firm
pressure
of
*NL*
the
lean
sinewy
hand
,
showed
that
the
prince
still
possessed
the
*NL*
tenacious
endurance
and
vigor
of
hardy
old
age
.
After
a
few
more
turns
*NL*
of
the
lathe
he
removed
his
foot
from
the
pedal
,
wiped
his
chisel
,
*NL*
dropped
it
into
a
leather
pouch
attached
to
the
lathe
,
and
,
approaching
*NL*
the
table
,
summoned
his
daughter
.
He
never
gave
his
children
a
blessing
,
*NL*
so
he
simply
held
out
his
bristly
cheek
-LRB-
as
yet
unshaven
-RRB-
and
,
regarding
*NL*
her
tenderly
and
attentively
,
said
severely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well
?
All
right
then
,
sit
down
.
''
He
took
the
exercise
book
*NL*
containing
lessons
in
geometry
written
by
himself
and
drew
up
a
chair
*NL*
with
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
tomorrow
!
''
said
he
,
quickly
finding
the
page
and
making
a
scratch
*NL*
from
one
paragraph
to
another
with
his
hard
nail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
bent
over
the
exercise
book
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
here
's
a
letter
for
you
,
''
said
the
old
man
suddenly
,
taking
*NL*
a
letter
addressed
in
a
woman
's
hand
from
a
bag
hanging
above
the
table
,
*NL*
onto
which
he
threw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
the
letter
red
patches
showed
themselves
on
the
*NL*
princess
'
face
.
She
took
it
quickly
and
bent
her
head
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Heloise
?
''
asked
the
prince
with
a
cold
smile
that
showed
his
still
*NL*
sound
,
yellowish
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
from
Julie
,
''
replied
the
princess
with
a
timid
glance
and
a
*NL*
timid
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
let
two
more
letters
pass
,
but
the
third
I
'll
read
,
''
said
the
*NL*
prince
sternly
;
``
I
'm
afraid
you
write
much
nonsense
.
I
'll
read
the
*NL*
third
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
this
if
you
like
,
Father
,
''
said
the
princess
,
blushing
still
more
*NL*
and
holding
out
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
third
,
I
said
the
third
!
''
cried
the
prince
abruptly
,
pushing
the
*NL*
letter
away
,
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
table
he
drew
toward
him
the
*NL*
exercise
book
containing
geometrical
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
madam
,
''
he
began
,
stooping
over
the
book
close
to
his
daughter
*NL*
and
placing
an
arm
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
sat
,
so
that
*NL*
she
felt
herself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
acrid
scent
of
old
age
*NL*
and
tobacco
,
which
she
had
known
so
long
.
``
Now
,
madam
,
these
triangles
*NL*
are
equal
;
please
note
that
the
angle
ABC
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
father
's
eyes
glittering
*NL*
close
to
her
;
the
red
patches
on
her
face
came
and
went
,
and
it
was
*NL*
plain
that
she
understood
nothing
and
was
so
frightened
that
her
fear
*NL*
would
prevent
her
understanding
any
of
her
father
's
further
*NL*
explanations
,
however
clear
they
might
be
.
Whether
it
was
the
teacher
's
*NL*
fault
or
the
pupil
's
,
this
same
thing
happened
every
day
:
the
princess
'
*NL*
eyes
grew
dim
,
she
could
not
see
and
could
not
hear
anything
,
but
was
*NL*
only
conscious
of
her
stern
father
's
withered
face
close
to
her
,
of
his
*NL*
breath
and
the
smell
of
him
,
and
could
think
only
of
how
to
get
away
*NL*
quickly
to
her
own
room
to
make
out
the
problem
in
peace
.
The
old
man
*NL*
was
beside
himself
:
moved
the
chair
on
which
he
was
sitting
noisily
*NL*
backward
and
forward
,
made
efforts
to
control
himself
and
not
become
*NL*
vehement
,
but
almost
always
did
become
vehement
,
scolded
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
flung
the
exercise
book
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
gave
a
wrong
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
is
n't
she
a
fool
!
''
shouted
the
prince
,
pushing
the
book
aside
*NL*
and
turning
sharply
away
;
but
rising
immediately
,
he
paced
up
and
down
,
*NL*
lightly
touched
his
daughter
's
hair
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
up
his
chair
,
and
continued
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
wo
n't
do
,
Princess
;
it
wo
n't
do
,
''
said
he
,
when
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
having
taken
and
closed
the
exercise
book
with
the
next
day
's
lesson
,
*NL*
was
about
to
leave
:
``
Mathematics
are
most
important
,
madam
!
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
have
you
like
our
silly
ladies
.
Get
used
to
it
and
you
'll
like
it
,
''
*NL*
and
he
patted
her
cheek
.
``
It
will
drive
all
the
nonsense
out
of
your
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
go
,
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
and
took
an
uncut
*NL*
book
from
the
high
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
some
sort
of
Key
to
the
Mysteries
that
your
Heloise
has
sent
*NL*
you
.
Religious
!
I
do
n't
interfere
with
anyone
's
belief
...
I
have
looked
*NL*
at
it
.
Take
it
.
Well
,
now
go
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
and
himself
closed
the
door
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
went
back
to
her
room
with
the
sad
,
scared
expression
that
*NL*
rarely
left
her
and
which
made
her
plain
,
sickly
face
yet
plainer
.
She
*NL*
sat
down
at
her
writing
table
,
on
which
stood
miniature
portraits
and
*NL*
which
was
littered
with
books
and
papers
.
The
princess
was
as
untidy
as
*NL*
her
father
was
tidy
.
She
put
down
the
geometry
book
and
eagerly
broke
*NL*
the
seal
of
her
letter
.
It
was
from
her
most
intimate
friend
from
*NL*
childhood
;
that
same
Julie
Karagina
who
had
been
at
the
Rostovs
'
name
-
*NL*
day
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
wrote
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
and
precious
Friend
,
How
terrible
and
frightful
a
thing
is
*NL*
separation
!
Though
I
tell
myself
that
half
my
life
and
half
my
happiness
*NL*
are
wrapped
up
in
you
,
and
that
in
spite
of
the
distance
separating
us
*NL*
our
hearts
are
united
by
indissoluble
bonds
,
my
heart
rebels
against
*NL*
fate
and
in
spite
of
the
pleasures
and
distractions
around
me
I
can
not
*NL*
overcome
a
certain
secret
sorrow
that
has
been
in
my
heart
ever
since
we
*NL*
parted
.
Why
are
we
not
together
as
we
were
last
summer
,
in
your
big
*NL*
study
,
on
the
blue
sofa
,
the
confidential
sofa
?
Why
can
not
I
now
,
as
*NL*
three
months
ago
,
draw
fresh
moral
strength
from
your
look
,
so
gentle
,
*NL*
calm
,
and
penetrating
,
a
look
I
loved
so
well
and
seem
to
see
before
me
*NL*
as
I
write
?
*NL*
*NL*
Having
read
thus
far
,
Princess
Mary
sighed
and
glanced
into
the
mirror
*NL*
which
stood
on
her
right
.
It
reflected
a
weak
,
ungraceful
figure
and
*NL*
thin
face
.
Her
eyes
,
always
sad
,
now
looked
with
particular
hopelessness
*NL*
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
.
``
She
flatters
me
,
''
thought
the
princess
,
*NL*
turning
away
and
continuing
to
read
.
But
Julie
did
not
flatter
her
*NL*
friend
,
the
princess
'
eyes
--
large
,
deep
and
luminous
-LRB-
it
seemed
as
if
at
*NL*
times
there
radiated
from
them
shafts
of
warm
light
-RRB-
--
were
so
beautiful
*NL*
that
very
often
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
her
face
they
gave
her
an
*NL*
attraction
more
powerful
than
that
of
beauty
.
But
the
princess
never
saw
*NL*
the
beautiful
expression
of
her
own
eyes
--
the
look
they
had
when
she
was
*NL*
not
thinking
of
herself
.
As
with
everyone
,
her
face
assumed
a
forced
*NL*
unnatural
expression
as
soon
as
she
looked
in
a
glass
.
She
went
on
*NL*
reading
:
*NL*
*NL*
All
Moscow
talks
of
nothing
but
war
.
One
of
my
two
brothers
is
already
*NL*
abroad
,
the
other
is
with
the
Guards
,
who
are
starting
on
their
march
to
*NL*
the
frontier
.
Our
dear
Emperor
has
left
Petersburg
and
it
is
thought
*NL*
intends
to
expose
his
precious
person
to
the
chances
of
war
.
God
grant
*NL*
that
the
Corsican
monster
who
is
destroying
the
peace
of
Europe
may
be
*NL*
overthrown
by
the
angel
whom
it
has
pleased
the
Almighty
,
in
His
*NL*
goodness
,
to
give
us
as
sovereign
!
To
say
nothing
of
my
brothers
,
this
*NL*
war
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
associations
nearest
my
heart
.
I
mean
*NL*
young
Nicholas
Rostov
,
who
with
his
enthusiasm
could
not
bear
to
remain
*NL*
inactive
and
has
left
the
university
to
join
the
army
.
I
will
confess
to
*NL*
you
,
dear
Mary
,
that
in
spite
of
his
extreme
youth
his
departure
for
the
*NL*
army
was
a
great
grief
to
me
.
This
young
man
,
of
whom
I
spoke
to
you
*NL*
last
summer
,
is
so
noble-minded
and
full
of
that
real
youthfulness
which
*NL*
one
seldom
finds
nowadays
among
our
old
men
of
twenty
and
,
particularly
,
*NL*
he
is
so
frank
and
has
so
much
heart
.
He
is
so
pure
and
poetic
that
my
*NL*
relations
with
him
,
transient
as
they
were
,
have
been
one
of
the
*NL*
sweetest
comforts
to
my
poor
heart
,
which
has
already
suffered
so
much
.
*NL*
Someday
I
will
tell
you
about
our
parting
and
all
that
was
said
then
.
*NL*
That
is
still
too
fresh
.
Ah
,
dear
friend
,
you
are
happy
not
to
know
*NL*
these
poignant
joys
and
sorrows
.
You
are
fortunate
,
for
the
latter
are
*NL*
generally
the
stronger
!
I
know
very
well
that
Count
Nicholas
is
too
*NL*
young
ever
to
be
more
to
me
than
a
friend
,
but
this
sweet
friendship
,
*NL*
this
poetic
and
pure
intimacy
,
were
what
my
heart
needed
.
But
enough
of
*NL*
this
!
The
chief
news
,
about
which
all
Moscow
gossips
,
is
the
death
of
*NL*
old
Count
Bezukhov
,
and
his
inheritance
.
Fancy
!
The
three
princesses
*NL*
have
received
very
little
,
Prince
Vasili
nothing
,
and
it
is
Monsieur
*NL*
Pierre
who
has
inherited
all
the
property
and
has
besides
been
*NL*
recognized
as
legitimate
;
so
that
he
is
now
Count
Bezukhov
and
possessor
*NL*
of
the
finest
fortune
in
Russia
.
It
is
rumored
that
Prince
Vasili
played
*NL*
a
very
despicable
part
in
this
affair
and
that
he
returned
to
Petersburg
*NL*
quite
crestfallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
I
understand
very
little
about
all
these
matters
of
wills
and
*NL*
inheritance
;
but
I
do
know
that
since
this
young
man
,
whom
we
all
used
*NL*
to
know
as
plain
Monsieur
Pierre
,
has
become
Count
Bezukhov
and
the
*NL*
owner
of
one
of
the
largest
fortunes
in
Russia
,
I
am
much
amused
to
*NL*
watch
the
change
in
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
mammas
burdened
by
*NL*
marriageable
daughters
,
and
of
the
young
ladies
themselves
,
toward
him
,
*NL*
though
,
between
you
and
me
,
he
always
seemed
to
me
a
poor
sort
of
*NL*
fellow
.
As
for
the
past
two
years
people
have
amused
themselves
by
*NL*
finding
husbands
for
me
-LRB-
most
of
whom
I
do
n't
even
know
-RRB-
,
the
*NL*
matchmaking
chronicles
of
Moscow
now
speak
of
me
as
the
future
Countess
*NL*
Bezukhova
.
But
you
will
understand
that
I
have
no
desire
for
the
post
.
A
*NL*
propos
of
marriages
:
do
you
know
that
a
while
ago
that
universal
auntie
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
told
me
,
under
the
seal
of
strict
secrecy
,
of
a
plan
of
*NL*
marriage
for
you
.
It
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
with
Prince
Vasili
's
*NL*
son
Anatole
,
whom
they
wish
to
reform
by
marrying
him
to
someone
rich
*NL*
and
distinguee
,
and
it
is
on
you
that
his
relations
'
choice
has
fallen
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
you
will
think
of
it
,
but
I
consider
it
my
duty
to
let
*NL*
you
know
of
it
.
He
is
said
to
be
very
handsome
and
a
terrible
*NL*
scapegrace
.
That
is
all
I
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
enough
of
gossip
.
I
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
of
paper
,
and
*NL*
Mamma
has
sent
for
me
to
go
and
dine
at
the
Apraksins
'
.
Read
the
*NL*
mystical
book
I
am
sending
you
;
it
has
an
enormous
success
here
.
Though
*NL*
there
are
things
in
it
difficult
for
the
feeble
human
mind
to
grasp
,
it
*NL*
is
an
admirable
book
which
calms
and
elevates
the
soul
.
Adieu
!
Give
my
*NL*
respects
to
monsieur
your
father
and
my
compliments
to
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
.
I
embrace
you
as
I
love
you

*NL*
P.S.
Let
me
have
news
of
your
brother
and
his
charming
little
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
pondered
awhile
with
a
thoughtful
smile
and
her
luminous
*NL*
eyes
lit
up
so
that
her
face
was
entirely
transformed
.
Then
she
suddenly
*NL*
rose
and
with
her
heavy
tread
went
up
to
the
table
.
She
took
a
sheet
of
*NL*
paper
and
her
hand
moved
rapidly
over
it
.
This
is
the
reply
she
wrote
,
*NL*
also
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
and
precious
Friend
,
Your
letter
of
the
13th
has
given
me
great
*NL*
delight
.
So
you
still
love
me
,
my
romantic
Julie
?
Separation
,
of
which
*NL*
you
say
so
much
that
is
bad
,
does
not
seem
to
have
had
its
usual
effect
*NL*
on
you
.
You
complain
of
our
separation
.
What
then
should
I
say
,
if
I
*NL*
dared
complain
,
I
who
am
deprived
of
all
who
are
dear
to
me
?
Ah
,
if
we
*NL*
had
not
religion
to
console
us
life
would
be
very
sad
.
Why
do
you
*NL*
suppose
that
I
should
look
severely
on
your
affection
for
that
young
*NL*
man
?
On
such
matters
I
am
only
severe
with
myself
.
I
understand
such
*NL*
feelings
in
others
,
and
if
never
having
felt
them
I
can
not
approve
of
*NL*
them
,
neither
do
I
condemn
them
.
Only
it
seems
to
me
that
Christian
*NL*
love
,
love
of
one
's
neighbor
,
love
of
one
's
enemy
,
is
worthier
,
sweeter
,
*NL*
and
better
than
the
feelings
which
the
beautiful
eyes
of
a
young
man
can
*NL*
inspire
in
a
romantic
and
loving
young
girl
like
yourself
.

*NL*
The
news
of
Count
Bezukhov
's
death
reached
us
before
your
letter
and
my
*NL*
father
was
much
affected
by
it
.
He
says
the
count
was
the
last
*NL*
representative
but
one
of
the
great
century
,
and
that
it
is
his
own
turn
*NL*
now
,
but
that
he
will
do
all
he
can
to
let
his
turn
come
as
late
as
*NL*
possible
.
God
preserve
us
from
that
terrible
misfortune
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
agree
with
you
about
Pierre
,
whom
I
knew
as
a
child
.
He
always
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
have
an
excellent
heart
,
and
that
is
the
quality
I
value
*NL*
most
in
people
.
As
to
his
inheritance
and
the
part
played
by
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
it
is
very
sad
for
both
.
Ah
,
my
dear
friend
,
our
divine
*NL*
Saviour
's
words
,
that
it
is
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
the
eye
of
*NL*
a
needle
than
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
the
Kingdom
of
God
,
are
terribly
*NL*
true
.
I
pity
Prince
Vasili
but
am
still
more
sorry
for
Pierre
.
So
young
,
*NL*
and
burdened
with
such
riches
--
to
what
temptations
he
will
be
exposed
!
*NL*
If
I
were
asked
what
I
desire
most
on
earth
,
it
would
be
to
be
poorer
*NL*
than
the
poorest
beggar
.
A
thousand
thanks
,
dear
friend
,
for
the
volume
*NL*
you
have
sent
me
and
which
has
such
success
in
Moscow
.
Yet
since
you
*NL*
tell
me
that
among
some
good
things
it
contains
others
which
our
weak
*NL*
human
understanding
can
not
grasp
,
it
seems
to
me
rather
useless
to
spend
*NL*
time
in
reading
what
is
unintelligible
and
can
therefore
bear
no
fruit
.
*NL*
I
never
could
understand
the
fondness
some
people
have
for
confusing
*NL*
their
minds
by
dwelling
on
mystical
books
that
merely
awaken
their
*NL*
doubts
and
excite
their
imagination
,
giving
them
a
bent
for
exaggeration
*NL*
quite
contrary
to
Christian
simplicity
.
Let
us
rather
read
the
Epistles
*NL*
and
Gospels
.
Let
us
not
seek
to
penetrate
what
mysteries
they
contain
;
*NL*
for
how
can
we
,
miserable
sinners
that
we
are
,
know
the
terrible
and
*NL*
holy
secrets
of
Providence
while
we
remain
in
this
flesh
which
forms
an
*NL*
impenetrable
veil
between
us
and
the
Eternal
?
Let
us
rather
confine
*NL*
ourselves
to
studying
those
sublime
rules
which
our
divine
Saviour
has
*NL*
left
for
our
guidance
here
below
.
Let
us
try
to
conform
to
them
and
*NL*
follow
them
,
and
let
us
be
persuaded
that
the
less
we
let
our
feeble
*NL*
human
minds
roam
,
the
better
we
shall
please
God
,
who
rejects
all
*NL*
knowledge
that
does
not
come
from
Him
;
and
the
less
we
seek
to
fathom
*NL*
what
He
has
been
pleased
to
conceal
from
us
,
the
sooner
will
He
*NL*
vouchsafe
its
revelation
to
us
through
His
divine
Spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
has
not
spoken
to
me
of
a
suitor
,
but
has
only
told
me
that
he
*NL*
has
received
a
letter
and
is
expecting
a
visit
from
Prince
Vasili
.
In
*NL*
regard
to
this
project
of
marriage
for
me
,
I
will
tell
you
,
dear
sweet
*NL*
friend
,
that
I
look
on
marriage
as
a
divine
institution
to
which
we
must
*NL*
conform
.
However
painful
it
may
be
to
me
,
should
the
Almighty
lay
the
*NL*
duties
of
wife
and
mother
upon
me
I
shall
try
to
perform
them
as
*NL*
faithfully
as
I
can
,
without
disquieting
myself
by
examining
my
feelings
*NL*
toward
him
whom
He
may
give
me
for
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
,
who
announces
his
speedy
arrival
at
*NL*
Bald
Hills
with
his
wife
.
This
pleasure
will
be
but
a
brief
one
,
*NL*
however
,
for
he
will
leave
us
again
to
take
part
in
this
unhappy
war
*NL*
into
which
we
have
been
drawn
,
God
knows
how
or
why
.
Not
only
where
you
*NL*
are
--
at
the
heart
of
affairs
and
of
the
world
--
is
the
talk
all
of
war
,
*NL*
even
here
amid
fieldwork
and
the
calm
of
nature
--
which
townsfolk
*NL*
consider
characteristic
of
the
country
--
rumors
of
war
are
heard
and
*NL*
painfully
felt
.
My
father
talks
of
nothing
but
marches
and
*NL*
countermarches
,
things
of
which
I
understand
nothing
;
and
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
during
my
daily
walk
through
the
village
I
witnessed
a
*NL*
heartrending
scene
...
It
was
a
convoy
of
conscripts
enrolled
from
our
*NL*
people
and
starting
to
join
the
army
.
You
should
have
seen
the
state
of
*NL*
the
mothers
,
wives
,
and
children
of
the
men
who
were
going
and
should
*NL*
have
heard
the
sobs
.
It
seems
as
though
mankind
has
forgotten
the
laws
*NL*
of
its
divine
Saviour
,
Who
preached
love
and
forgiveness
of
injuries
--
*NL*
and
that
men
attribute
the
greatest
merit
to
skill
in
killing
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adieu
,
dear
and
kind
friend
;
may
our
divine
Saviour
and
His
most
Holy
*NL*
Mother
keep
you
in
their
holy
and
all-powerful
care
!
*NL*
*NL*
MARY
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
sending
off
a
letter
,
Princess
?
I
have
already
dispatched
*NL*
mine
.
I
have
written
to
my
poor
mother
,
''
said
the
smiling
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
rapidly
,
in
her
pleasant
mellow
tones
and
with
guttural
r
's
.
*NL*
She
brought
into
Princess
Mary
's
strenuous
,
mournful
,
and
gloomy
world
a
*NL*
quite
different
atmosphere
,
careless
,
lighthearted
,
and
self-satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
I
must
warn
you
,
''
she
added
,
lowering
her
voice
and
evidently
*NL*
listening
to
herself
with
pleasure
,
and
speaking
with
exaggerated
*NL*
grasseyement
,
``
the
prince
has
been
scolding
Michael
Ivanovich
.
He
is
in
*NL*
a
very
bad
humor
,
very
morose
.
Be
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
friend
,
''
replied
Princess
Mary
,
``
I
have
asked
you
never
to
*NL*
warn
me
of
the
humor
my
father
is
in
.
I
do
not
allow
myself
to
judge
him
*NL*
and
would
not
have
others
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
glanced
at
her
watch
and
,
seeing
that
she
was
five
minutes
*NL*
late
in
starting
her
practice
on
the
clavichord
,
went
into
the
sitting
*NL*
room
with
a
look
of
alarm
.
Between
twelve
and
two
o'clock
,
as
the
day
*NL*
was
mapped
out
,
the
prince
rested
and
the
princess
played
the
*NL*
clavichord
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
The
gray-haired
valet
was
sitting
drowsily
listening
to
the
snoring
of
*NL*
the
prince
,
who
was
in
his
large
study
.
From
the
far
side
of
the
house
*NL*
through
the
closed
doors
came
the
sound
of
difficult
passages
--
twenty
*NL*
times
repeated
--
of
a
sonata
by
Dussek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
closed
carriage
and
another
with
a
hood
drove
up
to
the
*NL*
porch
.
Prince
Andrew
got
out
of
the
carriage
,
helped
his
little
wife
to
*NL*
alight
,
and
let
her
pass
into
the
house
before
him
.
Old
Tikhon
,
wearing
*NL*
a
wig
,
put
his
head
out
of
the
door
of
the
antechamber
,
reported
in
a
*NL*
whisper
that
the
prince
was
sleeping
,
and
hastily
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
Tikhon
knew
that
neither
the
son
's
arrival
nor
any
other
unusual
event
*NL*
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
the
appointed
order
of
the
day
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
apparently
knew
this
as
well
as
Tikhon
;
he
looked
at
his
watch
as
if
to
*NL*
ascertain
whether
his
father
's
habits
had
changed
since
he
was
at
home
*NL*
last
,
and
,
having
assured
himself
that
they
had
not
,
he
turned
to
his
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
get
up
in
twenty
minutes
.
Let
us
go
across
to
Mary
's
room
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
had
grown
stouter
during
this
time
,
but
her
eyes
and
*NL*
her
short
,
downy
,
smiling
lip
lifted
when
she
began
to
speak
just
as
*NL*
merrily
and
prettily
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
is
a
palace
!
''
she
said
to
her
husband
,
looking
around
with
*NL*
the
expression
with
which
people
compliment
their
host
at
a
ball
.
``
Let
's
*NL*
come
,
quick
,
quick
!
''
And
with
a
glance
round
,
she
smiled
at
Tikhon
,
at
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
at
the
footman
who
accompanied
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Mary
practicing
?
Let
's
go
quietly
and
take
her
by
surprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
followed
her
with
a
courteous
but
sad
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
grown
older
,
Tikhon
,
''
he
said
in
passing
to
the
old
man
,
who
*NL*
kissed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
reached
the
room
from
which
the
sounds
of
the
clavichord
*NL*
came
,
the
pretty
,
fair
haired
Frenchwoman
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
*NL*
rushed
out
apparently
beside
herself
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
what
joy
for
the
princess
!
''
exclaimed
she
:
``
At
last
!
I
must
let
her
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
please
not
...
You
are
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
''
said
the
little
*NL*
princess
,
kissing
her
.
``
I
know
you
already
through
my
sister-in-law
's
*NL*
friendship
for
you
.
She
was
not
expecting
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
sitting
room
from
which
came
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
oft-repeated
passage
of
the
sonata
.
Prince
Andrew
stopped
and
*NL*
made
a
grimace
,
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
entered
the
room
.
The
passage
broke
off
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
a
cry
was
heard
,
then
Princess
Mary
's
heavy
tread
and
the
sound
*NL*
of
kissing
.
When
Prince
Andrew
went
in
the
two
princesses
,
who
had
only
*NL*
met
once
before
for
a
short
time
at
his
wedding
,
were
in
each
other
's
*NL*
arms
warmly
pressing
their
lips
to
whatever
place
they
happened
to
*NL*
touch
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
stood
near
them
pressing
her
hand
to
her
*NL*
heart
,
with
a
beatific
smile
and
obviously
equally
ready
to
cry
or
to
*NL*
laugh
.
Prince
Andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
,
as
lovers
of
*NL*
music
do
when
they
hear
a
false
note
.
The
two
women
let
go
of
one
*NL*
another
,
and
then
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
too
late
,
seized
each
other
's
*NL*
hands
,
kissing
them
and
pulling
them
away
,
and
again
began
kissing
each
*NL*
other
on
the
face
,
and
then
to
Prince
Andrew
's
surprise
both
began
to
*NL*
cry
and
kissed
again
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
also
began
to
cry
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
evidently
felt
ill
at
ease
,
but
to
the
two
women
it
seemed
quite
*NL*
natural
that
they
should
cry
,
and
apparently
it
never
entered
their
*NL*
heads
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise
at
this
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
dear
!
...
Ah
!
Mary
!
''
they
suddenly
exclaimed
,
and
then
laughed
.
*NL*
``
I
dreamed
last
night
...
''
--
``
You
were
not
expecting
us
?
...
''
``
Ah
!
Mary
,
*NL*
you
have
got
thinner
?
...
''
``
And
you
have
grown
stouter
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
the
princess
at
once
,
''
put
in
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
had
no
idea
!
...
''
exclaimed
Princess
Mary
.
``
Ah
,
Andrew
,
I
did
not
*NL*
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
and
his
sister
,
hand
in
hand
,
kissed
one
another
,
and
he
*NL*
told
her
she
was
still
the
same
crybaby
as
ever
.
Princess
Mary
had
*NL*
turned
toward
her
brother
,
and
through
her
tears
the
loving
,
warm
,
*NL*
gentle
look
of
her
large
luminous
eyes
,
very
beautiful
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
rested
on
Prince
Andrew
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
talked
incessantly
,
her
short
,
downy
upper
lip
*NL*
continually
and
rapidly
touching
her
rosy
nether
lip
when
necessary
and
*NL*
drawing
up
again
next
moment
when
her
face
broke
into
a
smile
of
*NL*
glittering
teeth
and
sparkling
eyes
.
She
told
of
an
accident
they
had
*NL*
had
on
the
Spasski
Hill
which
might
have
been
serious
for
her
in
her
*NL*
condition
,
and
immediately
after
that
informed
them
that
she
had
left
*NL*
all
her
clothes
in
Petersburg
and
that
heaven
knew
what
she
would
have
*NL*
to
dress
in
here
;
and
that
Andrew
had
quite
changed
,
and
that
Kitty
*NL*
Odyntsova
had
married
an
old
man
,
and
that
there
was
a
suitor
for
Mary
,
*NL*
a
real
one
,
but
that
they
would
talk
of
that
later
.
Princess
Mary
was
*NL*
still
looking
silently
at
her
brother
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
full
*NL*
of
love
and
sadness
.
It
was
plain
that
she
was
following
a
train
of
*NL*
thought
independent
of
her
sister-in-law
's
words
.
In
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
description
of
the
last
Petersburg
fete
she
addressed
her
brother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
really
going
to
the
war
,
Andrew
?
''
she
said
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lise
sighed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
even
tomorrow
,
''
replied
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
leaving
me
here
,
God
knows
why
,
when
he
might
have
had
*NL*
promotion
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
did
not
listen
to
the
end
,
but
continuing
her
train
of
*NL*
thought
turned
to
her
sister-in-law
with
a
tender
glance
at
her
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
certain
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
the
little
princess
changed
.
She
sighed
and
said
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
quite
certain
.
Ah
!
it
is
very
dreadful
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lip
descended
.
She
brought
her
face
close
to
her
sister-in-law
's
and
*NL*
unexpectedly
again
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
needs
rest
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
frown
.
``
Do
n't
you
,
Lise
?
*NL*
Take
her
to
your
room
and
I
'll
go
to
Father
.
How
is
he
?
Just
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
just
the
same
.
Though
I
do
n't
know
what
your
opinion
will
be
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
princess
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
the
hours
the
same
?
And
the
walks
in
the
avenues
?
And
the
*NL*
lathe
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
which
*NL*
showed
that
,
in
spite
of
all
his
love
and
respect
for
his
father
,
he
was
*NL*
aware
of
his
weaknesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hours
are
the
same
,
and
the
lathe
,
and
also
the
mathematics
and
my
*NL*
geometry
lessons
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
gleefully
,
as
if
her
lessons
in
*NL*
geometry
were
among
the
greatest
delights
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
and
the
time
had
come
for
the
old
*NL*
prince
to
get
up
,
Tikhon
came
to
call
the
young
prince
to
his
father
.
*NL*
The
old
man
made
a
departure
from
his
usual
routine
in
honor
of
his
*NL*
son
's
arrival
:
he
gave
orders
to
admit
him
to
his
apartments
while
he
*NL*
dressed
for
dinner
.
The
old
prince
always
dressed
in
old-fashioned
*NL*
style
,
wearing
an
antique
coat
and
powdered
hair
;
and
when
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
entered
his
father
's
dressing
room
-LRB-
not
with
the
contemptuous
look
and
*NL*
manner
he
wore
in
drawing
rooms
,
but
with
the
animated
face
with
which
*NL*
he
talked
to
Pierre
-RRB-
,
the
old
man
was
sitting
on
a
large
leather-covered
*NL*
chair
,
wrapped
in
a
powdering
mantle
,
entrusting
his
head
to
Tikhon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
's
the
warrior
!
Wants
to
vanquish
Buonaparte
?
''
said
the
old
*NL*
man
,
shaking
his
powdered
head
as
much
as
the
tail
,
which
Tikhon
was
*NL*
holding
fast
to
plait
,
would
allow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
at
least
must
tackle
him
properly
,
or
else
if
he
goes
on
like
this
*NL*
he
'll
soon
have
us
,
too
,
for
his
subjects
!
How
are
you
?
''
And
he
held
out
*NL*
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
in
a
good
temper
after
his
nap
before
dinner
.
-LRB-
He
used
*NL*
to
say
that
a
nap
``
after
dinner
was
silver
--
before
dinner
,
golden
.
''
-RRB-
He
*NL*
cast
happy
,
sidelong
glances
at
his
son
from
under
his
thick
,
bushy
*NL*
eyebrows
.
Prince
Andrew
went
up
and
kissed
his
father
on
the
spot
*NL*
indicated
to
him
.
He
made
no
reply
on
his
father
's
favorite
topic
--
*NL*
making
fun
of
the
military
men
of
the
day
,
and
more
particularly
of
*NL*
Bonaparte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Father
,
I
have
come
to
you
and
brought
my
wife
who
is
pregnant
,
''
*NL*
said
Prince
Andrew
,
following
every
movement
of
his
father
's
face
with
*NL*
an
eager
and
respectful
look
.
``
How
is
your
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fools
and
rakes
fall
ill
,
my
boy
.
You
know
me
:
I
am
busy
from
*NL*
morning
till
night
and
abstemious
,
so
of
course
I
am
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
''
said
his
son
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
!
Well
,
go
on
,
''
he
continued
,
returning
to
*NL*
his
hobby
;
``
tell
me
how
the
Germans
have
taught
you
to
fight
Bonaparte
*NL*
by
this
new
science
you
call

strategy

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
time
to
collect
my
wits
,
Father
,
''
said
he
,
with
a
smile
that
*NL*
showed
that
his
father
's
foibles
did
not
prevent
his
son
from
loving
and
*NL*
honoring
him
.
``
Why
,
I
have
not
yet
had
time
to
settle
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
nonsense
!
''
cried
the
old
man
,
shaking
his
pigtail
to
see
*NL*
whether
it
was
firmly
plaited
,
and
grasping
his
by
the
hand
.
``
The
house
*NL*
for
your
wife
is
ready
.
Princess
Mary
will
take
her
there
and
show
her
*NL*
over
,
and
they
'll
talk
nineteen
to
the
dozen
.
That
's
their
woman
's
way
!
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
have
her
.
Sit
down
and
talk
.
About
Mikhelson
's
army
I
*NL*
understand
--
Tolstoy
's
too
...
a
simultaneous
expedition
...
But
what
's
*NL*
the
southern
army
to
do
?
Prussia
is
neutral
...
I
know
that
.
What
about
*NL*
Austria
?
''
said
he
,
rising
from
his
chair
and
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
*NL*
followed
by
Tikhon
,
who
ran
after
him
,
handing
him
different
articles
of
*NL*
clothing
.
``
What
of
Sweden
?
How
will
they
cross
Pomerania
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
seeing
that
his
father
insisted
,
began
--
at
first
*NL*
reluctantly
,
but
gradually
with
more
and
more
animation
,
and
from
habit
*NL*
changing
unconsciously
from
Russian
to
French
as
he
went
on
--
to
explain
*NL*
the
plan
of
operation
for
the
coming
campaign
.
He
explained
how
an
army
,
*NL*
ninety
thousand
strong
,
was
to
threaten
Prussia
so
as
to
bring
her
out
*NL*
of
her
neutrality
and
draw
her
into
the
war
;
how
part
of
that
army
was
*NL*
to
join
some
Swedish
forces
at
Stralsund
;
how
two
hundred
and
twenty
*NL*
thousand
Austrians
,
with
a
hundred
thousand
Russians
,
were
to
operate
in
*NL*
Italy
and
on
the
Rhine
;
how
fifty
thousand
Russians
and
as
many
English
*NL*
were
to
land
at
Naples
,
and
how
a
total
force
of
five
hundred
thousand
*NL*
men
was
to
attack
the
French
from
different
sides
.
The
old
prince
did
*NL*
not
evince
the
least
interest
during
this
explanation
,
but
as
if
he
were
*NL*
not
listening
to
it
continued
to
dress
while
walking
about
,
and
three
*NL*
times
unexpectedly
interrupted
.
Once
he
stopped
it
by
shouting
:
``
The
*NL*
white
one
,
the
white
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
meant
that
Tikhon
was
not
handing
him
the
waistcoat
he
wanted
.
*NL*
Another
time
he
interrupted
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
she
soon
be
confined
?
''
and
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
*NL*
said
:
``
That
's
bad
!
Go
on
,
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
interruption
came
when
Prince
Andrew
was
finishing
his
*NL*
description
.
The
old
man
began
to
sing
,
in
the
cracked
voice
of
old
age
:
*NL*
``
Malbrook
s
`
en
va-t-en
guerre
.
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Marlborough
is
going
to
the
wars
;
God
knows
when
he
'll
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
son
only
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
it
's
a
plan
I
approve
of
,
''
said
the
son
;
``
I
am
only
telling
*NL*
you
what
it
is
.
Napoleon
has
also
formed
his
plan
by
now
,
not
worse
than
*NL*
this
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
told
me
nothing
new
,
''
and
the
old
man
repeated
,
*NL*
meditatively
and
rapidly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra
.
Go
to
the
dining
room

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
hour
the
prince
,
powdered
and
shaven
,
entered
the
*NL*
dining
room
where
his
daughter-in-law
,
Princess
Mary
,
and
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
were
already
awaiting
him
together
with
his
architect
,
who
by
*NL*
a
strange
caprice
of
his
employer
's
was
admitted
to
table
though
the
*NL*
position
of
that
insignificant
individual
was
such
as
could
certainly
*NL*
not
have
caused
him
to
expect
that
honor
.
The
prince
,
who
generally
kept
*NL*
very
strictly
to
social
distinctions
and
rarely
admitted
even
important
*NL*
government
officials
to
his
table
,
had
unexpectedly
selected
Michael
*NL*
Ivanovich
-LRB-
who
always
went
into
a
corner
to
blow
his
nose
on
his
checked
*NL*
handkerchief
-RRB-
to
illustrate
the
theory
that
all
men
are
equals
,
and
had
*NL*
more
than
once
impressed
on
his
daughter
that
Michael
Ivanovich
was
``
not
*NL*
a
whit
worse
than
you
or
I.
''
At
dinner
the
prince
usually
spoke
to
the
*NL*
taciturn
Michael
Ivanovich
more
often
than
to
anyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dining
room
,
which
like
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
was
*NL*
exceedingly
lofty
,
the
members
of
the
household
and
the
footmen
--
one
*NL*
behind
each
chair
--
stood
waiting
for
the
prince
to
enter
.
The
head
*NL*
butler
,
napkin
on
arm
,
was
scanning
the
setting
of
the
table
,
making
*NL*
signs
to
the
footmen
,
and
anxiously
glancing
from
the
clock
to
the
door
*NL*
by
which
the
prince
was
to
enter
.
Prince
Andrew
was
looking
at
a
large
*NL*
gilt
frame
,
new
to
him
,
containing
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
Princes
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
opposite
which
hung
another
such
frame
with
a
badly
painted
*NL*
portrait
-LRB-
evidently
by
the
hand
of
the
artist
belonging
to
the
estate
-RRB-
*NL*
of
a
ruling
prince
,
in
a
crown
--
an
alleged
descendant
of
Rurik
and
*NL*
ancestor
of
the
Bolkonskis
.
Prince
Andrew
,
looking
again
at
that
*NL*
genealogical
tree
,
shook
his
head
,
laughing
as
a
man
laughs
who
looks
at
*NL*
a
portrait
so
characteristic
of
the
original
as
to
be
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
thoroughly
like
him
that
is
!
''
he
said
to
Princess
Mary
,
who
had
*NL*
come
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
at
her
brother
in
surprise
.
She
did
not
understand
*NL*
what
he
was
laughing
at
.
Everything
her
father
did
inspired
her
with
*NL*
reverence
and
was
beyond
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everyone
has
his
Achilles
'
heel
,
''
continued
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Fancy
,
with
*NL*
his
powerful
mind
,
indulging
in
such
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
could
not
understand
the
boldness
of
her
brother
's
*NL*
criticism
and
was
about
to
reply
,
when
the
expected
footsteps
were
heard
*NL*
coming
from
the
study
.
The
prince
walked
in
quickly
and
jauntily
as
was
*NL*
his
wont
,
as
if
intentionally
contrasting
the
briskness
of
his
manners
*NL*
with
the
strict
formality
of
his
house
.
At
that
moment
the
great
clock
*NL*
struck
two
and
another
with
a
shrill
tone
joined
in
from
the
drawing
*NL*
room
.
The
prince
stood
still
;
his
lively
glittering
eyes
from
under
*NL*
their
thick
,
bushy
eyebrows
sternly
scanned
all
present
and
rested
on
*NL*
the
little
princess
.
She
felt
,
as
courtiers
do
when
the
Tsar
enters
,
the
*NL*
sensation
of
fear
and
respect
which
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
around
*NL*
him
.
He
stroked
her
hair
and
then
patted
her
awkwardly
on
the
back
of
*NL*
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
,
glad
,
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
,
looking
attentively
into
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
then
quickly
went
to
his
place
and
sat
down
.
``
Sit
down
,
sit
*NL*
down
!
Sit
down
,
Michael
Ianovich
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
indicated
a
place
beside
him
to
his
daughter-in-law
.
A
footman
moved
*NL*
the
chair
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
ho
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
casting
his
eyes
on
her
rounded
figure
.
*NL*
``
You
've
been
in
a
hurry
.
That
's
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
in
his
usual
dry
,
cold
,
unpleasant
way
,
with
his
lips
only
*NL*
and
not
with
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
walk
,
walk
as
much
as
possible
,
as
much
as
possible
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
did
not
,
or
did
not
wish
to
,
hear
his
words
.
She
was
*NL*
silent
and
seemed
confused
.
The
prince
asked
her
about
her
father
,
and
*NL*
she
began
to
smile
and
talk
.
He
asked
about
mutual
acquaintances
,
and
*NL*
she
became
still
more
animated
and
chattered
away
giving
him
greetings
*NL*
from
various
people
and
retelling
the
town
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
Apraksina
,
poor
thing
,
has
lost
her
husband
and
she
has
cried
*NL*
her
eyes
out
,
''
she
said
,
growing
more
and
more
lively
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
became
animated
the
prince
looked
at
her
more
and
more
sternly
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
,
as
if
he
had
studied
her
sufficiently
and
had
formed
a
*NL*
definite
idea
of
her
,
he
turned
away
and
addressed
Michael
Ivanovich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Michael
Ivanovich
,
our
Bonaparte
will
be
having
a
bad
time
of
it
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
''
-LRB-
he
always
spoke
thus
of
his
son
-RRB-
``
has
been
telling
me
*NL*
what
forces
are
being
collected
against
him
!
While
you
and
I
never
*NL*
thought
much
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Michael
Ivanovich
did
not
at
all
know
when
``
you
and
I
''
had
said
such
*NL*
things
about
Bonaparte
,
but
understanding
that
he
was
wanted
as
a
peg
on
*NL*
which
to
hang
the
prince
's
favorite
topic
,
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
*NL*
young
prince
,
wondering
what
would
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
great
tactician
!
''
said
the
prince
to
his
son
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
architect
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
conversation
again
turned
on
the
war
,
on
Bonaparte
,
and
the
*NL*
generals
and
statesmen
of
the
day
.
The
old
prince
seemed
convinced
not
*NL*
only
that
all
the
men
of
the
day
were
mere
babies
who
did
not
know
the
A
*NL*
B
C
of
war
or
of
politics
,
and
that
Bonaparte
was
an
insignificant
*NL*
little
Frenchy
,
successful
only
because
there
were
no
longer
any
*NL*
Potemkins
or
Suvorovs
left
to
oppose
him
;
but
he
was
also
convinced
that
*NL*
there
were
no
political
difficulties
in
Europe
and
no
real
war
,
but
only
*NL*
a
sort
of
puppet
show
at
which
the
men
of
the
day
were
playing
,
*NL*
pretending
to
do
something
real
.
Prince
Andrew
gaily
bore
with
his
*NL*
father
's
ridicule
of
the
new
men
,
and
drew
him
on
and
listened
to
him
*NL*
with
evident
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
past
always
seems
good
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
did
not
Suvorov
himself
fall
*NL*
into
a
trap
Moreau
set
him
,
and

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
that
?
Who
?

cried
the
prince
.
``
Suvorov

''
And
he
jerked
*NL*
away
his
plate
,
which
Tikhon
briskly
caught
.
``
Suvorov

Consider

*NL*
Prince
Andrew

Two

Moreau
would
*NL*
have
been
a
prisoner
if
Suvorov
had
had
a
free
hand
;
but
he
had
the
*NL*
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath
on
his
hands

It
would
have
puzzled
the
*NL*
devil
himself

When
you
get
there
you
'll
find
out
what
those
Hofs

kriegs-wurst-Raths
are

Suvorov
could
n't
manage
them
so
what
chance
has
*NL*
Michael
Kutuzov
?
No

my

he
continued
,
``
you

to
the
invitation
made
that

to
Moreau

enter

service

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

at
all
say
that
all
the
plans
are
good

''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
I
*NL*
am
only
surprised
at
your
opinion

You
may
laugh
as
much
as

you
like

all
the

Bonaparte
is
a
great
general

*NL*
*NL*
``
Michael
Ivanovich
!

cried
the
old
prince
to
the
architect
who
,
busy
*NL*
with
his
roast
meat
,
hoped
he
had
been
forgotten
:
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
*NL*
Buonaparte
was
a
great
tactician

Here

he
says
the

thing

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
your
excellency
,
''
replied
the
architect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buonaparte
was
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
his
mouth

He
has
got
*NL*
splendid
soldiers
.
Besides
he
began
by
attacking
Germans
.
And
only
*NL*
idlers
have
failed
to
beat
the
Germans
.
Since
the
world
began
everybody
*NL*
has
beaten
the
Germans
.
They
beat
no
one
--
except
one
another
.
He
made
*NL*
his
reputation
fighting
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
prince
began
explaining
all
the
blunders
which
,
according
to
*NL*
him
,
Bonaparte
had
made
in
his
campaigns
and
even
in
politics
.
His
son
*NL*
made
no
rejoinder
,
but
it
was
evident
that
whatever
arguments
were
*NL*
presented
he
was
as
little
able
as
his
father
to
change
his
opinion
.
He
*NL*
listened
,
refraining
from
a
reply
,
and
involuntarily
wondered
how
this
*NL*
old
man
,
living
alone
in
the
country
for
so
many
years
,
could
know
and
*NL*
discuss
so
minutely
and
acutely
all
the
recent
European
military
and
*NL*
political
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
'm
an
old
man
and
do
n't
understand
the
present
state
of
*NL*
affairs
?
''
concluded
his
father
.
``
But
it
troubles
me
.
I
do
n't
sleep
at
*NL*
night
.
Come
now
,
where
has
this
great
commander
of
yours
shown
his
*NL*
skill
?
''
he
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
take
too
long
to
tell
,
''
answered
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
go
to
your
Buonaparte
!
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
here
's
*NL*
another
admirer
of
that
powder-monkey
emperor
of
yours
,

he
exclaimed
in
*NL*
excellent
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Prince
,
I
am
not
a
Bonapartist
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dieu
sait
quand
reviendra

''
hummed
the
prince
out
of
tune
and
,
with
a
*NL*
laugh
still
more
so
,
he
quitted
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
during
the
whole
discussion
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
dinner
sat
silent
,
glancing
with
a
frightened
look
now
at
her
father-in
-
*NL*
law
and
now
at
Princess
Mary
.
When
they
left
the
table
she
took
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
's
arm
and
drew
her
into
another
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
clever
man
your
father
is
,
''
said
she
;
``
perhaps
that
is
why
I
am
*NL*
afraid
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
so
kind
!

answered
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
to
leave
next
evening
.
The
old
prince
,
not
altering
*NL*
his
routine
,
retired
as
usual
after
dinner
.
The
little
princess
was
in
*NL*
her
sister-in-law
's
room
.
Prince
Andrew
in
a
traveling
coat
without
*NL*
epaulettes
had
been
packing
with
his
valet
in
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
.
*NL*
After
inspecting
the
carriage
himself
and
seeing
the
trunks
put
in
,
he
*NL*
ordered
the
horses
to
be
harnessed
.
Only
those
things
he
always
kept
*NL*
with
him
remained
in
his
room
;
a
small
box
,
a
large
canteen
fitted
with
*NL*
silver
plate
,
two
Turkish
pistols
and
a
saber
--
a
present
from
his
father
*NL*
who
had
brought
it
from
the
siege
of
Ochakov
.
All
these
traveling
*NL*
effects
of
Prince
Andrew
's
were
in
very
good
order
:
new
,
clean
,
and
in
*NL*
cloth
covers
carefully
tied
with
tapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
starting
on
a
journey
or
changing
their
mode
of
life
,
men
capable
*NL*
of
reflection
are
generally
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
.
At
such
moments
*NL*
one
reviews
the
past
and
plans
for
the
future
.
Prince
Andrew
's
face
*NL*
looked
very
thoughtful
and
tender
.
With
his
hands
behind
him
he
paced
*NL*
briskly
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
,
looking
straight
before
him
*NL*
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
.
Did
he
fear
going
to
the
war
,
or
was
*NL*
he
sad
at
leaving
his
wife
?
--
perhaps
both
,
but
evidently
he
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
be
seen
in
that
mood
,
for
hearing
footsteps
in
the
passage
he
*NL*
hurriedly
unclasped
his
hands
,
stopped
at
a
table
as
if
tying
the
cover
*NL*
of
the
small
box
,
and
assumed
his
usual
tranquil
and
impenetrable
*NL*
expression
.
It
was
the
heavy
tread
of
Princess
Mary
that
he
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
you
have
given
orders
to
harness
,
''
she
cried
,
panting
-LRB-
she
had
*NL*
apparently
been
running
-RRB-
,
``
and
I
did
so
wish
to
have
another
talk
with
*NL*
you
alone
!
God
knows
how
long
we
may
again
be
parted
.
You
are
not
angry
*NL*
with
me
for
coming
?
You
have
changed
so
,
Andrusha
,
''
she
added
,
as
if
to
*NL*
explain
such
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
as
she
uttered
his
pet
name
,
``
Andrusha
.
''
It
was
obviously
*NL*
strange
to
her
to
think
that
this
stern
handsome
man
should
be
Andrusha
-
*NL*
-
the
slender
mischievous
boy
who
had
been
her
playfellow
in
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
Lise
?
''
he
asked
,
answering
her
question
only
by
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
so
tired
that
she
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
in
my
room
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Andrew
!
What
a
treasure
of
a
wife
you
have
,
''
said
she
,
sitting
down
on
*NL*
the
sofa
,
facing
her
brother
.
``
She
is
quite
a
child
:
such
a
dear
,
merry
*NL*
child
.
I
have
grown
so
fond
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
silent
,
but
the
princess
noticed
the
ironical
and
*NL*
contemptuous
look
that
showed
itself
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
be
indulgent
to
little
weaknesses
;
who
is
free
from
them
,
*NL*
Andrew
?
Do
n't
forget
that
she
has
grown
up
and
been
educated
in
society
,
*NL*
and
so
her
position
now
is
not
a
rosy
one
.
We
should
enter
into
*NL*
everyone
's
situation
.
Tout
comprendre
,
c'est
tout
pardonner
.
*
Think
*NL*
what
it
must
be
for
her
,
poor
thing
,
after
what
she
has
been
used
to
,
to
*NL*
be
parted
from
her
husband
and
be
left
alone
in
the
country
,
in
her
*NL*
condition
!
It
's
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
understand
all
is
to
forgive
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
as
he
looked
at
his
sister
,
as
we
smile
at
those
we
*NL*
think
we
thoroughly
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live
in
the
country
and
do
n't
think
the
life
terrible
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
that
's
different
.
Why
speak
of
me
?
I
do
n't
want
any
other
life
,
*NL*
and
ca
n't
,
for
I
know
no
other
.
But
think
,
Andrew
:
for
a
young
society
*NL*
woman
to
be
buried
in
the
country
during
the
best
years
of
her
life
,
all
*NL*
alone
--
for
Papa
is
always
busy
,
and
I.
.
.
well
,
you
know
what
poor
*NL*
resources
I
have
for
entertaining
a
woman
used
to
the
best
society
.
*NL*
There
is
only
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
your
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
at
all
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
She
is
very
nice
and
kind
and
,
above
all
,
she
's
much
to
be
pitied
.
*NL*
She
has
no
one
,
no
one
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
need
her
,
and
she
's
*NL*
even
in
my
way
.
You
know
I
always
was
a
savage
,
and
now
am
even
more
so
.
*NL*
I
like
being
alone
...
Father
likes
her
very
much
.
She
and
Michael
*NL*
Ivanovich
are
the
two
people
to
whom
he
is
always
gentle
and
kind
,
*NL*
because
he
has
been
a
benefactor
to
them
both
.
As
Sterne
says
:
`
We
do
n't
*NL*
love
people
so
much
for
the
good
they
have
done
us
,
as
for
the
good
we
*NL*
have
done
them
.
'
Father
took
her
when
she
was
homeless
after
losing
her
*NL*
own
father
.
She
is
very
good-natured
,
and
my
father
likes
her
way
of
*NL*
reading
.
She
reads
to
him
in
the
evenings
and
reads
splendidly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
quite
frank
,
Mary
,
I
expect
Father
's
character
sometimes
makes
*NL*
things
trying
for
you
,
does
n't
it
?
''
Prince
Andrew
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
first
surprised
and
then
aghast
at
this
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
For
me
?
...
Trying
for
me
!

''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
always
was
rather
harsh
;
and
now
I
should
think
he
's
getting
very
*NL*
trying
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
apparently
speaking
lightly
of
their
father
*NL*
in
order
to
puzzle
or
test
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
good
in
every
way
,
Andrew
,
but
you
have
a
kind
of
intellectual
*NL*
pride
,
''
said
the
princess
,
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
*NL*
rather
than
the
trend
of
the
conversation
--
``
and
that
's
a
great
sin
.
How
*NL*
can
one
judge
Father
?
But
even
if
one
might
,
what
feeling
except
*NL*
veneration
could
such
a
man
as
my
father
evoke
?
And
I
am
so
contented
*NL*
and
happy
with
him
.
I
only
wish
you
were
all
as
happy
as
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
shook
his
head
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
that
is
hard
for
me
...
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
,
*NL*
Andrew

is
Father
's
way
of
treating
religious
subjects
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
how
a
man
of
his
immense
intellect
can
fail
to
see
what
is
as
*NL*
clear
as
day
,
and
can
go
so
far
astray
.
That
is
the
only
thing
that
*NL*
makes
me
unhappy
.
But
even
in
this
I
can
see
lately
a
shade
of
*NL*
improvement
.
His
satire
has
been
less
bitter
of
late
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
monk
he
received
and
had
a
long
talk
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
dear

I
am
afraid
you

your
monk
are
wasting
your
powder

said
Prince
Andrew
banteringly
yet
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

mon
ami

I
only
pray

hope
that
God
will
hear
me

she
said
timidly
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
``
I
have
a
great
favor

ask

it

comfort
me

said
she
,
putting
her
hand
in
her
reticule
but
not
yet
*NL*
taking
out
what
she
was
holding
inside
it

as

what
she
held
were
the

subject

her
request
and
must
not
be
shown
before
the
request
was

granted

She
looked
timidly
at
her

*NL*
``
Even

answered
Prince

if
guessing
what
it
was
about

*NL*
``

weigh
a
hundredweight
and
wo
n't
break
my
neck

To
*NL*
please
you
...
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
But
immediately
,
noticing
the
pained
*NL*
expression
his
joke
had
brought
to
his
sister
's
face
,
he
repented
and
*NL*
added
:
``
I
am
glad
;
really
,
dear
,
I
am
very
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Against
your
will
He
will
save
and
have
mercy
on
you
and
bring
you
to
*NL*
Himself
,
for
in
Him
alone
is
truth
and
peace
,
''
said
she
in
a
voice
*NL*
trembling
with
emotion
,
solemnly
holding
up
in
both
hands
before
her
*NL*
brother
a
small
,
oval
,
antique
,
dark-faced
icon
of
the
Saviour
in
a
gold
*NL*
setting
,
on
a
finely
wrought
silver
chain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
crossed
herself
,
kissed
the
icon
,
and
handed
it
to
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Andrew
,
for
my
sake
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rays
of
gentle
light
shone
from
her
large
,
timid
eyes
.
Those
eyes
lit
up
*NL*
the
whole
of
her
thin
,
sickly
face
and
made
it
beautiful
.
Her
brother
*NL*
would
have
taken
the
icon
,
but
she
stopped
him
.
Andrew
understood
,
*NL*
crossed
himself
and
kissed
the
icon
.
There
was
a
look
of
tenderness
,
for
*NL*
he
was
touched
,
but
also
a
gleam
of
irony
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
dear
.
''
She
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
and
sat
down
again
*NL*
on
the
sofa
.
They
were
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
was
saying
to
you
,
Andrew
,
be
kind
and
generous
as
you
always
used
*NL*
to
be
.
Do
n't
judge
Lise
harshly
,
''
she
began
.
``
She
is
so
sweet
,
so
good
-
*NL*
natured
,
and
her
position
now
is
a
very
hard
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
I
have
complained
of
my
wife
to
you
,
Masha
,
or
blamed
*NL*
her
.
Why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Red
patches
appeared
on
Princess
Mary
's
face
and
she
was
silent
as
if
*NL*
she
felt
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
nothing
to
you
,
but
you
have
already
been
talked
to
.
And
I
*NL*
am
sorry
for
that
,
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
patches
grew
deeper
on
her
forehead
,
neck
,
and
cheeks
.
She
tried
to
*NL*
say
something
but
could
not
.
Her
brother
had
guessed
right
:
the
little
*NL*
princess
had
been
crying
after
dinner
and
had
spoken
of
her
forebodings
*NL*
about
her
confinement
,
and
how
she
dreaded
it
,
and
had
complained
of
her
*NL*
fate
,
her
father-in-law
,
and
her
husband
.
After
crying
she
had
fallen
*NL*
asleep
.
Prince
Andrew
felt
sorry
for
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
this
,
Masha
:
I
ca
n't
reproach
,
have
not
reproached
,
and
never
*NL*
shall
reproach
my
wife
with
anything
,
and
I
can
not
reproach
myself
with
*NL*
anything
in
regard
to
her
;
and
that
always
will
be
so
in
whatever
*NL*
circumstances
I
may
be
placed
.
But
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
...
if
*NL*
you
want
to
know
whether
I
am
happy
?
No
!
Is
she
happy
?
No
!
But
why
this
*NL*
is
so
I
do
n't
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
he
rose
,
went
to
his
sister
,
and
,
stooping
,
kissed
her
*NL*
forehead
.
His
fine
eyes
lit
up
with
a
thoughtful
,
kindly
,
and
*NL*
unaccustomed
brightness
,
but
he
was
looking
not
at
his
sister
but
over
*NL*
her
head
toward
the
darkness
of
the
open
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
her
,
I
must
say
good-by
.
Or
--
go
and
wake
and
I
'll
come
in
*NL*
a
moment
.
Petrushka
!
''
he
called
to
his
valet
:
``
Come
here
,
take
these
*NL*
away
.
Put
this
on
the
seat
and
this
to
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
,
then
stopped
and
said
:
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
if
you
had
faith
you
would
have
turned
to
God
and
asked
Him
to
*NL*
give
you
the
love
you
do
not
feel
,
and
your
prayer
would
have
been
*NL*
answered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
may
be
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Go
,
Masha
;
I
'll
come
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
to
his
sister
's
room
,
in
the
passage
which
connected
one
wing
*NL*
with
the
other
,
Prince
Andrew
met
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
smiling
*NL*
sweetly
.
It
was
the
third
time
that
day
that
,
with
an
ecstatic
and
*NL*
artless
smile
,
she
had
met
him
in
secluded
passages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
thought
you
were
in
your
room
,
''
she
said
,
for
some
reason
*NL*
blushing
and
dropping
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
sternly
at
her
and
an
expression
of
anger
suddenly
*NL*
came
over
his
face
.
He
said
nothing
to
her
but
looked
at
her
forehead
*NL*
and
hair
,
without
looking
at
her
eyes
,
with
such
contempt
that
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
blushed
and
went
away
without
a
word
.
When
he
reached
his
*NL*
sister
's
room
his
wife
was
already
awake
and
her
merry
voice
,
hurrying
*NL*
one
word
after
another
,
came
through
the
open
door
.
She
was
speaking
as
*NL*
usual
in
French
,
and
as
if
after
long
self-restraint
she
wished
to
make
*NL*
up
for
lost
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
imagine
the
old
Countess
Zubova
,
with
false
curls
and
her
mouth
*NL*
full
of
false
teeth
,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
cheat
old
age
...
Ha
,
ha
,
*NL*
ha
!
Mary
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
very
sentence
about
Countess
Zubova
and
this
same
laugh
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
had
already
heard
from
his
wife
in
the
presence
of
others
some
*NL*
five
times
.
He
entered
the
room
softly
.
The
little
princess
,
plump
and
*NL*
rosy
,
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
with
her
work
in
her
hands
,
talking
*NL*
incessantly
,
repeating
Petersburg
reminiscences
and
even
phrases
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
came
up
,
stroked
her
hair
,
and
asked
if
she
felt
rested
after
*NL*
their
journey
.
She
answered
him
and
continued
her
chatter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
with
six
horses
was
waiting
at
the
porch
.
It
was
an
autumn
*NL*
night
,
so
dark
that
the
coachman
could
not
see
the
carriage
pole
.
*NL*
Servants
with
lanterns
were
bustling
about
in
the
porch
.
The
immense
*NL*
house
was
brilliant
with
lights
shining
through
its
lofty
windows
.
The
*NL*
domestic
serfs
were
crowding
in
the
hall
,
waiting
to
bid
good-by
to
the
*NL*
young
prince
.
The
members
of
the
household
were
all
gathered
in
the
*NL*
reception
hall
:
Michael
Ivanovich
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
Princess
*NL*
Mary
,
and
the
little
princess
.
Prince
Andrew
had
been
called
to
his
*NL*
father
's
study
as
the
latter
wished
to
say
good-by
to
him
alone
.
All
*NL*
were
waiting
for
them
to
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
study
the
old
man
in
his
old-age
*NL*
spectacles
and
white
dressing
gown
,
in
which
he
received
no
one
but
his
*NL*
son
,
sat
at
the
table
writing
.
He
glanced
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
?
''
And
he
went
on
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
say
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
me
here
,
''
and
he
touched
his
cheek
:
``
Thanks
,
thanks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
thank
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
not
dilly-dallying
and
not
hanging
to
a
woman
's
apron
strings
.
The
*NL*
Service
before
everything
.
Thanks
,
thanks
!
''
And
he
went
on
writing
,
so
*NL*
that
his
quill
spluttered
and
squeaked
.
``
If
you
have
anything
to
say
,
*NL*
say
it
.
These
two
things
can
be
done
together
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
my
wife
...
I
am
ashamed
as
it
is
to
leave
her
on
your
hands
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
talk
nonsense
?
Say
what
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
her
confinement
is
due
,
send
to
Moscow
for
an
accoucheur
...
Let
*NL*
him
be
here
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
stopped
writing
and
,
as
if
not
understanding
,
fixed
his
*NL*
stern
eyes
on
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
no
one
can
help
if
nature
does
not
do
her
work
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
evidently
confused
.
``
I
know
that
out
of
a
million
cases
*NL*
only
one
goes
wrong
,
but
it
is
her
fancy
and
mine
.
They
have
been
*NL*
telling
her
things
.
She
has
had
a
dream
and
is
frightened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
Hm
...
''
muttered
the
old
prince
to
himself
,
finishing
what
he
was
*NL*
writing
.
``
I
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
signed
with
a
flourish
and
suddenly
turning
to
his
son
began
to
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bad
business
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
bad
,
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wife

said
the
old
prince
,
briefly
and
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped

said
the
prince
.
``
They
're
all

Do
n't
be
afraid

I
wo
n't
tell
anyone
,
but
you
know
it
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
his
son
by
the
hand
with
small
bony
fingers
,
shook
it
,
looked
*NL*
straight
into
his
son
's
face
with
keen
eyes
which
seemed
to
see
through
*NL*
him
,
and
again
laughed
his
frigid
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
sighed
,
thus
admitting
that
his
father
had
understood
him
.
The
*NL*
old
man
continued
to
fold
and
seal
his
letter
,
snatching
up
and
throwing
*NL*
down
the
wax
,
the
seal
,
and
the
paper
,
with
his
accustomed
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
be
done
?
She
's
pretty
!
I
will
do
everything

Make
your
mind
*NL*
easy
,
''
said
he
in
abrupt
sentences
while
sealing
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Andrew
did
not
speak
;
he
was
both
pleased
and
displeased
that
his
father
*NL*
understood
him
.
The
old
man
got
up
and
gave
the
letter
to
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
said
he
;
``
do
n't
worry
about
your
wife

what
can
be

shall
*NL*
be

Now
listen

Give
this
letter
to
Michael
Ilarionovich

I
have
*NL*
written
that
he
should
make
use

Write

tell

serve

*NL*
Nicholas
Bolkonski

Now
come

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
so
rapidly
that
he
did
not
finish
half
his
words
,
but
his
son
*NL*
was
accustomed
to
understand
him
.
He
led
him
to
the
desk
,
raised
the
*NL*
lid
,
drew
out
a
drawer
,
and
took
out
an
exercise
book
filled
with
his
*NL*
bold
,
tall
,
close
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
probably
die
before
you

So
remember

them

after
my
death

Now
here
is
a
Lombard
bond

*NL*
a
letter

it
is
a
premium
for
the
man

writes
a
history
of
Suvorov
's
*NL*
wars

Send
it
to
the
Academy

Here
are
some
jottings
for
you
to
read
*NL*
when
I
am
gone

You
will
find
them
useful

*NL*
*NL*
Andrew
did
not
tell
his
father
that
he
would
no
doubt
live
a
long
time
*NL*
yet
.
He
felt
that
he
must
not
say
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
it
all
,
Father
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
good-by

He
gave
his
son
his
hand
to
kiss
,
and
embraced
*NL*
him
.
``
Remember
this
,
Prince
Andrew
,
if
they
kill
you
it
will
hurt
me
,
*NL*
your
old
father

''
he
paused
unexpectedly
,
and
then
in
a
querulous
*NL*
voice
suddenly
shrieked
:
``
but
if
I
hear
that
you
have
not
behaved
like
a
*NL*
son
of
Nicholas
Bolkonski
,
I
shall
be
ashamed
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
have
said
that
to
me

Father

said
the
son
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
also
wanted
to
ask
you

continued
Prince
Andrew
,
``
if
I
'm
killed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
let
the

have
him

said
the
old
man
,
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
silent
,
facing
one
another
.
The
old
man
's
sharp
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
straight
on
his
son
's
.
Something
twitched
in
the
lower
part
of
the
*NL*
old
prince
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
said
good-by

Go
!
''
he
suddenly
shouted
in
a
loud
,
angry
voice
,
*NL*
opening
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
?
''
asked
both
princesses
when
they
saw
for
a
moment
at
*NL*
the
door
Prince
Andrew
and
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
a
white
dressing
*NL*
gown
,
spectacled
and
wigless
,
shouting
in
an
angry
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
sighed
and
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
said
,
turning
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
``
Well
!
''
sounded
coldly
ironic
,
as
if
he
were
saying
,
:
``
Now
go
*NL*
through
your
performance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
already
!
''
said
the
little
princess
,
turning
pale
and
looking
*NL*
with
dismay
at
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
embraced
her
.
She
screamed
and
fell
unconscious
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cautiously
released
the
shoulder
she
leaned
on
,
looked
into
her
face
,
*NL*
and
carefully
placed
her
in
an
easy
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
Mary
,
''
said
he
gently
to
his
sister
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
kissing
her
,
and
then
he
left
the
room
with
rapid
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
lay
in
the
armchair
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
chafing
*NL*
her
temples
.
Princess
Mary
,
supporting
her
sister-in-law
,
still
looked
*NL*
with
her
beautiful
eyes
full
of
tears
at
the
door
through
which
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
had
gone
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
his
direction
.
From
*NL*
the
study
,
like
pistol
shots
,
came
the
frequent
sound
of
the
old
man
*NL*
angrily
blowing
his
nose
.
Hardly
had
Prince
Andrew
gone
when
the
study
*NL*
door
opened
quickly
and
the
stern
figure
of
the
old
man
in
the
white
*NL*
dressing
gown
looked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
?
That
's
all
right
!
''
said
he
;
and
looking
angrily
at
the
*NL*
unconscious
little
princess
,
he
shook
his
head
reprovingly
and
slammed
*NL*
the
door

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
In
October
,
1805
,
a
Russian
army
was
occupying
the
villages
and
towns
of
*NL*
the
Archduchy
of
Austria
,
and
yet
other
regiments
freshly
arriving
from
*NL*
Russia
were
settling
near
the
fortress
of
Braunau
and
burdening
the
*NL*
inhabitants
on
whom
they
were
quartered
.
Braunau
was
the
headquarters
of
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
,
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
October
11
,
1805
,
one
of
the
infantry
regiments
that
had
just
reached
*NL*
Braunau
had
halted
half
a
mile
from
the
town
,
waiting
to
be
inspected
by
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
.
Despite
the
un-Russian
appearance
of
the
*NL*
locality
and
surroundings
--
fruit
gardens
,
stone
fences
,
tiled
roofs
,
and
*NL*
hills
in
the
distance
--
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
inhabitants
-LRB-
who
*NL*
gazed
with
curiosity
at
the
soldiers
-RRB-
were
not
Russians
,
the
regiment
*NL*
had
just
the
appearance
of
any
Russian
regiment
preparing
for
an
*NL*
inspection
anywhere
in
the
heart
of
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
last
day
's
march
an
order
had
been
received
that
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
would
inspect
the
regiment
on
the
march
.
Though
*NL*
the
words
of
the
order
were
not
clear
to
the
regimental
commander
,
and
*NL*
the
question
arose
whether
the
troops
were
to
be
in
marching
order
or
*NL*
not
,
it
was
decided
at
a
consultation
between
the
battalion
commanders
*NL*
to
present
the
regiment
in
parade
order
,
on
the
principle
that
it
is
*NL*
always
better
to
``
bow
too
low
than
not
bow
low
enough
.
''
So
the
soldiers
,
*NL*
after
a
twenty-mile
march
,
were
kept
mending
and
cleaning
all
night
long
*NL*
without
closing
their
eyes
,
while
the
adjutants
and
company
commanders
*NL*
calculated
and
reckoned
,
and
by
morning
the
regiment
--
instead
of
the
*NL*
straggling
,
disorderly
crowd
it
had
been
on
its
last
march
the
day
*NL*
before
--
presented
a
well-ordered
array
of
two
thousand
men
each
of
whom
*NL*
knew
his
place
and
his
duty
,
had
every
button
and
every
strap
in
place
,
*NL*
and
shone
with
cleanliness
.
And
not
only
externally
was
all
in
order
,
*NL*
but
had
it
pleased
the
commander-in-chief
to
look
under
the
uniforms
he
*NL*
would
have
found
on
every
man
a
clean
shirt
,
and
in
every
knapsack
the
*NL*
appointed
number
of
articles
,
``
awl
,
soap
,
and
all
,
''
as
the
soldiers
say
.
*NL*
There
was
only
one
circumstance
concerning
which
no
one
could
be
at
*NL*
ease
.
It
was
the
state
of
the
soldiers
'
boots
.
More
than
half
the
men
's
*NL*
boots
were
in
holes
.
But
this
defect
was
not
due
to
any
fault
of
the
*NL*
regimental
commander
,
for
in
spite
of
repeated
demands
boots
had
not
*NL*
been
issued
by
the
Austrian
commissariat
,
and
the
regiment
had
marched
*NL*
some
seven
hundred
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
regiment
was
an
elderly
,
choleric
,
stout
,
and
*NL*
thick-set
general
with
grizzled
eyebrows
and
whiskers
,
and
wider
from
*NL*
chest
to
back
than
across
the
shoulders
.
He
had
on
a
brand-new
uniform
*NL*
showing
the
creases
where
it
had
been
folded
and
thick
gold
epaulettes
*NL*
which
seemed
to
stand
rather
than
lie
down
on
his
massive
shoulders
.
He
*NL*
had
the
air
of
a
man
happily
performing
one
of
the
most
solemn
duties
of
*NL*
his
life
.
He
walked
about
in
front
of
the
line
and
at
every
step
pulled
*NL*
himself
up
,
slightly
arching
his
back
.
It
was
plain
that
the
commander
*NL*
admired
his
regiment
,
rejoiced
in
it
,
and
that
his
whole
mind
was
*NL*
engrossed
by
it
,
yet
his
strut
seemed
to
indicate
that
,
besides
military
*NL*
matters
,
social
interests
and
the
fair
sex
occupied
no
small
part
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Michael
Mitrich
,
sir
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
one
of
the
battalion
*NL*
commanders
who
smilingly
pressed
forward
-LRB-
it
was
plain
that
they
both
*NL*
felt
happy
-RRB-
.
``
We
had
our
hands
full
last
night
.
However
,
I
think
the
*NL*
regiment
is
not
a
bad
one
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
battalion
commander
perceived
the
jovial
irony
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
not
be
turned
off
the
field
even
on
the
Tsaritsin
Meadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
the
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
on
the
road
from
the
town
on
which
signalers
had
been
*NL*
posted
,
two
men
appeared
on
horse
back
.
They
were
an
aide-de-camp
*NL*
followed
by
a
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aide-de-camp
was
sent
to
confirm
the
order
which
had
not
been
*NL*
clearly
worded
the
day
before
,
namely
,
that
the
commander-in-chief
*NL*
wished
to
see
the
regiment
just
in
the
state
in
which
it
had
been
on
the
*NL*
march
:
in
their
greatcoats
,
and
packs
,
and
without
any
preparation
*NL*
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
from
Vienna
had
come
to
Kutuzov
the
day
*NL*
before
with
proposals
and
demands
for
him
to
join
up
with
the
army
of
*NL*
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
Mack
,
and
Kutuzov
,
not
considering
this
*NL*
junction
advisable
,
meant
,
among
other
arguments
in
support
of
his
view
,
*NL*
to
show
the
Austrian
general
the
wretched
state
in
which
the
troops
*NL*
arrived
from
Russia
.
With
this
object
he
intended
to
meet
the
regiment
;
*NL*
so
the
worse
the
condition
it
was
in
,
the
better
pleased
the
commander
-
*NL*
in-chief
would
be
.
Though
the
aide-de-camp
did
not
know
these
*NL*
circumstances
,
he
nevertheless
delivered
the
definite
order
that
the
men
*NL*
should
be
in
their
greatcoats
and
in
marching
order
,
and
that
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
would
otherwise
be
dissatisfied
.
On
hearing
this
the
*NL*
regimental
commander
hung
his
head
,
silently
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
spread
out
his
arms
with
a
choleric
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
mess
we
've
made
of
it
!
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
Did
n't
I
tell
you
,
Michael
Mitrich
,
that
if
it
was
said
`
on
*NL*
the
march
'
it
meant
in
greatcoats
?
''
said
he
reproachfully
to
the
*NL*
battalion
commander
.
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
he
added
,
stepping
resolutely
*NL*
forward
.
``
Company
commanders
!
''
he
shouted
in
a
voice
accustomed
to
*NL*
command
.
``
Sergeants
major
!
...
How
soon
will
he
be
here
?
''
he
asked
the
*NL*
aide-de-camp
with
a
respectful
politeness
evidently
relating
to
the
*NL*
personage
he
was
referring
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
hour
's
time
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
have
time
to
change
clothes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
General
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
regimental
commander
,
going
up
to
the
line
himself
,
ordered
the
*NL*
soldiers
to
change
into
their
greatcoats
.
The
company
commanders
ran
off
*NL*
to
their
companies
,
the
sergeants
major
began
bustling
-LRB-
the
greatcoats
*NL*
were
not
in
very
good
condition
-RRB-
,
and
instantly
the
squares
that
had
up
*NL*
to
then
been
in
regular
order
and
silent
began
to
sway
and
stretch
and
*NL*
hum
with
voices
.
On
all
sides
soldiers
were
running
to
and
fro
,
throwing
*NL*
up
their
knapsacks
with
a
jerk
of
their
shoulders
and
pulling
the
straps
*NL*
over
their
heads
,
unstrapping
their
overcoats
and
drawing
the
sleeves
on
*NL*
with
upraised
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
all
was
again
in
order
,
only
the
squares
had
become
gray
*NL*
instead
of
black
.
The
regimental
commander
walked
with
his
jerky
steps
*NL*
to
the
front
of
the
regiment
and
examined
it
from
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
is
this
?
This
!
''
he
shouted
and
stood
still
.
``
Commander
of
the
*NL*
third
company
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Commander
of
the
third
company
wanted
by
the
general
!
...
commander
to
*NL*
the
general
...
third
company
to
the
commander
.
''
The
words
passed
along
*NL*
the
lines
and
an
adjutant
ran
to
look
for
the
missing
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
eager
but
misrepeated
words
had
reached
their
destination
in
a
*NL*
cry
of
:
``
The
general
to
the
third
company
,
''
the
missing
officer
appeared
*NL*
from
behind
his
company
and
,
though
he
was
a
middle-aged
man
and
not
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
running
,
trotted
awkwardly
stumbling
on
his
toes
toward
the
*NL*
general
.
The
captain
's
face
showed
the
uneasiness
of
a
schoolboy
who
is
*NL*
told
to
repeat
a
lesson
he
has
not
learned
.
Spots
appeared
on
his
nose
,
*NL*
the
redness
of
which
was
evidently
due
to
intemperance
,
and
his
mouth
*NL*
twitched
nervously
.
The
general
looked
the
captain
up
and
down
as
he
*NL*
came
up
panting
,
slackening
his
pace
as
he
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
soon
be
dressing
your
men
in
petticoats
!
What
is
this
?
''
*NL*
shouted
the
regimental
commander
,
thrusting
forward
his
jaw
and
pointing
*NL*
at
a
soldier
in
the
ranks
of
the
third
company
in
a
greatcoat
of
bluish
*NL*
cloth
,
which
contrasted
with
the
others
.
``
What
have
you
been
after
?
The
*NL*
commander
in
chief
is
expected
and
you
leave
your
place
?
Eh
?
I
'll
teach
*NL*
you
to
dress
the
men
in
fancy
coats
for
a
parade
...
Eh
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
company
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
superior
,
*NL*
pressed
two
fingers
more
and
more
rigidly
to
his
cap
,
as
if
in
this
*NL*
pressure
lay
his
only
hope
of
salvation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
do
n't
you
speak
?
Whom
have
you
got
there
dressed
up
as
a
*NL*
Hungarian
?
''
said
the
commander
with
an
austere
gibe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
excellency
,
what
?
Your
excellency

But
what
about
your
*NL*
excellency

nobody
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
it
's
the
officer
Dolokhov
,
who
has
been
reduced
to
the
*NL*
ranks

''
said
the
captain
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
Has
he
been
degraded
into
a
field
marshal
,
or
into
a
soldier
?
If
*NL*
a
soldier
,
he
should
be
dressed
in
regulation
uniform
like
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency

you
gave
him
leave
yourself
,
on

march

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gave
him
leave

Leave
?
That
's
just
like
you
young
men

''
said
the
*NL*
regimental
commander
cooling
down
a
little
.
``
Leave
indeed
...
One
says
a
*NL*
word
to
you
and
you
...
What
?
''
he
added
with
renewed
irritation
,
``
I
beg
*NL*
you
to
dress
your
men
decently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
commander
,
turning
to
look
at
the
adjutant
,
directed
his
jerky
*NL*
steps
down
the
line
.
He
was
evidently
pleased
at
his
own
display
of
*NL*
anger
and
walking
up
to
the
regiment
wished
to
find
a
further
excuse
for
*NL*
wrath
.
Having
snapped
at
an
officer
for
an
unpolished
badge
,
at
another
*NL*
because
his
line
was
not
straight
,
he
reached
the
third
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H-o-o-w
are
you
standing
?
Where
's
your
leg
?
Your
leg
?
''
shouted
the
*NL*
commander
with
a
tone
of
suffering
in
his
voice
,
while
there
were
still
*NL*
five
men
between
him
and
Dolokhov
with
his
bluish-gray
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
slowly
straightened
his
bent
knee
,
looking
straight
with
his
*NL*
clear
,
insolent
eyes
in
the
general
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
a
blue
coat
?
Off
with
it
...
Sergeant
major
!
Change
his
coat

the
*NL*
ras

he
did
not
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
General
,
I
must
obey
orders
,
but
I
am
not
bound
to
endure

Dolokhov
*NL*
hurriedly
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
talking
in
the

No
talking

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
bound

Dolokhov
concluded
in
loud
,
ringing
*NL*
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
general
and
the
soldier
met
.
The
general
became
silent
,
*NL*
angrily
pulling
down
his
tight
scarf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
request
you
to
have
the
goodness

said
as
he

turned
away

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
coming
!
''
shouted
the
signaler
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regimental
commander
,
flushing
,
ran
to
his
horse
,
seized
the
stirrup
*NL*
with
trembling
hands
,
threw
his
body
across
the
saddle
,
righted
himself
,
*NL*
drew
his
saber
,
and
with
a
happy
and
resolute
countenance
,
opening
his
*NL*
mouth
awry
,
prepared
to
shout
.
The
regiment
fluttered
like
a
bird
*NL*
preening
its
plumage
and
became
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Att-ention
!
''
shouted
the
regimental
commander
in
a
soul-shaking
voice
*NL*
which
expressed
joy
for
himself
,
severity
for
the
regiment
,
and
welcome
*NL*
for
the
approaching
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
the
broad
country
road
,
edged
on
both
sides
by
trees
,
came
a
high
,
*NL*
light
blue
Viennese
caleche
,
slightly
creaking
on
its
springs
and
drawn
*NL*
by
six
horses
at
a
smart
trot
.
Behind
the
caleche
galloped
the
suite
and
*NL*
a
convoy
of
Croats
.
Beside
Kutuzov
sat
an
Austrian
general
,
in
a
white
*NL*
uniform
that
looked
strange
among
the
Russian
black
ones
.
The
caleche
*NL*
stopped
in
front
of
the
regiment
.
Kutuzov
and
the
Austrian
general
were
*NL*
talking
in
low
voices
and
Kutuzov
smiled
slightly
as
treading
heavily
he
*NL*
stepped
down
from
the
carriage
just
as
if
those
two
thousand
men
*NL*
breathlessly
gazing
at
him
and
the
regimental
commander
did
not
exist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
of
command
rang
out
,
and
again
the
regiment
quivered
,
as
with
a
*NL*
jingling
sound
it
presented
arms
.
Then
amidst
a
dead
silence
the
feeble
*NL*
voice
of
the
commander-in-chief
was
heard
.
The
regiment
roared
,
``
Health
*NL*
to
your
ex
...
len
...
len
...
lency
!
''
and
again
all
became
silent
.
At
*NL*
first
Kutuzov
stood
still
while
the
regiment
moved
;
then
he
and
the
*NL*
general
in
white
,
accompanied
by
the
suite
,
walked
between
the
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
way
the
regimental
commander
saluted
the
commander-in-chief
and
*NL*
devoured
him
with
his
eyes
,
drawing
himself
up
obsequiously
,
and
from
*NL*
the
way
he
walked
through
the
ranks
behind
the
generals
,
bending
forward
*NL*
and
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
jerky
movements
,
and
from
the
way
he
*NL*
darted
forward
at
every
word
or
gesture
of
the
commander-in-chief
,
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
performed
his
duty
as
a
subordinate
with
even
*NL*
greater
zeal
than
his
duty
as
a
commander
.
Thanks
to
the
strictness
and
*NL*
assiduity
of
its
commander
the
regiment
,
in
comparison
with
others
that
*NL*
had
reached
Braunau
at
the
same
time
,
was
in
splendid
condition
.
There
*NL*
were
only
217
sick
and
stragglers
.
Everything
was
in
good
order
except
*NL*
the
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
walked
through
the
ranks
,
sometimes
stopping
to
say
a
few
*NL*
friendly
words
to
officers
he
had
known
in
the
Turkish
war
,
sometimes
*NL*
also
to
the
soldiers
.
Looking
at
their
boots
he
several
times
shook
his
*NL*
head
sadly
,
pointing
them
out
to
the
Austrian
general
with
an
expression
*NL*
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
was
not
blaming
anyone
,
but
could
not
help
*NL*
noticing
what
a
bad
state
of
things
it
was
.
The
regimental
commander
ran
*NL*
forward
on
each
such
occasion
,
fearing
to
miss
a
single
word
of
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
's
regarding
the
regiment
.
Behind
Kutuzov
,
at
a
*NL*
distance
that
allowed
every
softly
spoken
word
to
be
heard
,
followed
*NL*
some
twenty
men
of
his
suite
.
These
gentlemen
talked
among
themselves
*NL*
and
sometimes
laughed
.
Nearest
of
all
to
the
commander-in-chief
walked
a
*NL*
handsome
adjutant
.
This
was
Prince
Bolkonski
.
Beside
him
was
his
comrade
*NL*
Nesvitski
,
a
tall
staff
officer
,
extremely
stout
,
with
a
kindly
,
*NL*
smiling
,
handsome
face
and
moist
eyes
.
Nesvitski
could
hardly
keep
from
*NL*
laughter
provoked
by
a
swarthy
hussar
officer
who
walked
beside
him
.
*NL*
This
hussar
,
with
a
grave
face
and
without
a
smile
or
a
change
in
the
*NL*
expression
of
his
fixed
eyes
,
watched
the
regimental
commander
's
back
*NL*
and
mimicked
his
every
movement
.
Each
time
the
commander
started
and
*NL*
bent
forward
,
the
hussar
started
and
bent
forward
in
exactly
the
same
*NL*
manner
.
Nesvitski
laughed
and
nudged
the
others
to
make
them
look
at
the
*NL*
wag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
walked
slowly
and
languidly
past
thousands
of
eyes
which
were
*NL*
starting
from
their
sockets
to
watch
their
chief
.
On
reaching
the
third
*NL*
company
he
suddenly
stopped
.
His
suite
,
not
having
expected
this
,
*NL*
involuntarily
came
closer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Timokhin
!
''
said
he
,
recognizing
the
red-nosed
captain
who
had
been
*NL*
reprimanded
on
account
of
the
blue
greatcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
thought
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
stretch
himself
more
*NL*
than
Timokhin
had
done
when
he
was
reprimanded
by
the
regimental
*NL*
commander
,
but
now
that
the
commander-in-chief
addressed
him
he
drew
*NL*
himself
up
to
such
an
extent
that
it
seemed
he
could
not
have
sustained
*NL*
it
had
the
commander-in-chief
continued
to
look
at
him
,
and
so
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
who
evidently
understood
his
case
and
wished
him
nothing
but
good
,
*NL*
quickly
turned
away
,
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flitting
over
his
*NL*
scarred
and
puffy
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
Ismail
comrade
,
''
said
he
.
``
A
brave
officer
!
Are
you
satisfied
*NL*
with
him
?
''
he
asked
the
regimental
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
latter
--
unconscious
that
he
was
being
reflected
in
the
hussar
*NL*
officer
as
in
a
looking
glass
--
started
,
moved
forward
,
and
answered
:
*NL*
``
Highly
satisfied
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
all
have
our
weaknesses
,
''
said
Kutuzov
smiling
and
walking
away
from
*NL*
him
.
``
He
used
to
have
a
predilection
for
Bacchus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
regimental
commander
was
afraid
he
might
be
blamed
for
this
and
did
*NL*
not
answer
.
The
hussar
at
that
moment
noticed
the
face
of
the
red-nosed
*NL*
captain
and
his
drawn-in
stomach
,
and
mimicked
his
expression
and
pose
*NL*
with
such
exactitude
that
Nesvitski
could
not
help
laughing
.
Kutuzov
*NL*
turned
round
.
The
officer
evidently
had
complete
control
of
his
face
,
*NL*
and
while
Kutuzov
was
turning
managed
to
make
a
grimace
and
then
assume
*NL*
a
most
serious
,
deferential
,
and
innocent
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
company
was
the
last
,
and
Kutuzov
pondered
,
apparently
trying
*NL*
to
recollect
something
.
Prince
Andrew
stepped
forward
from
among
the
*NL*
suite
and
said
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
to
remind
you
of
the
officer
Dolokhov
,
reduced
to
the
ranks
*NL*
in
this
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Dolokhov
?
''
asked
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
who
had
already
changed
into
a
soldier
's
gray
greatcoat
,
did
*NL*
not
wait
to
be
called
.
The
shapely
figure
of
the
fair-haired
soldier
,
*NL*
with
his
clear
blue
eyes
,
stepped
forward
from
the
ranks
,
went
up
to
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
,
and
presented
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
complaint
to
make
?
''
Kutuzov
asked
with
a
slight
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Dolokhov
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Kutuzov
.
``
I
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
.
Do
your
duty
.
*NL*
The
Emperor
is
gracious
,
and
I
sha
n't
forget
you
if
you
deserve
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clear
blue
eyes
looked
at
the
commander-in-chief
just
as
boldly
as
*NL*
they
had
looked
at
the
regimental
commander
,
seeming
by
their
expression
*NL*
to
tear
open
the
veil
of
convention
that
separates
a
commander-in-chief
*NL*
so
widely
from
a
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
I
ask
of
your
excellency
,
''
Dolokhov
said
in
his
firm
,
*NL*
ringing
,
deliberate
voice
.
``
I
ask
an
opportunity
to
atone
for
my
fault
*NL*
and
prove
my
devotion
to
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
to
Russia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
turned
away
.
The
same
smile
of
the
eyes
with
which
he
had
turned
*NL*
from
Captain
Timokhin
again
flitted
over
his
face
.
He
turned
away
with
a
*NL*
grimace
as
if
to
say
that
everything
Dolokhov
had
said
to
him
and
*NL*
everything
he
could
say
had
long
been
known
to
him
,
that
he
was
weary
of
*NL*
it
and
it
was
not
at
all
what
he
wanted
.
He
turned
away
and
went
to
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regiment
broke
up
into
companies
,
which
went
to
their
appointed
*NL*
quarters
near
Braunau
,
where
they
hoped
to
receive
boots
and
clothes
and
*NL*
to
rest
after
their
hard
marches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
bear
me
a
grudge
,
Prokhor
Ignatych
?
''
said
the
regimental
*NL*
commander
,
overtaking
the
third
company
on
its
way
to
its
quarters
and
*NL*
riding
up
to
Captain
Timokhin
who
was
walking
in
front
.
-LRB-
The
regimental
*NL*
commander
's
face
now
that
the
inspection
was
happily
over
beamed
with
*NL*
irrepressible
delight
.
-RRB-
``
It
's
in
the
Emperor
's
service
...
it
ca
n't
be
*NL*
helped
...
one
is
sometimes
a
bit
hasty
on
parade
...
I
am
the
first
to
*NL*
apologize
,
you
know
me
!
...
He
was
very
pleased
!
''
And
he
held
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mention
it
,
General
,
as
if
I
'd
be
so
bold
!
''
replied
the
captain
,
*NL*
his
nose
growing
redder
as
he
gave
a
smile
which
showed
where
two
front
*NL*
teeth
were
missing
that
had
been
knocked
out
by
the
butt
end
of
a
gun
at
*NL*
Ismail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
Mr.
Dolokhov
that
I
wo
n't
forget
him
--
he
may
be
quite
easy
.
*NL*
And
tell
me
,
please

I
've
been
meaning
to
ask

how
is
he
behaving
*NL*
himself
,

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
the
service
goes

is
quite
punctilious

your
excellency

his
character

said
Timokhin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
his
character
?
''
asked
the
regimental
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
different
on
different
days

''
answered
the
captain
.
``
One
day
he
is
*NL*
sensible
,
well
educated
,
and
good-natured
,
and
the
next
he
's
a
wild
*NL*
beast
...
In
Poland
,
if
you
please
,
he
nearly
killed
a
Jew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
well
!
''
remarked
the
regimental
commander
.
``
Still
,
one
must
*NL*
have
pity
on
a
young
man
in
misfortune

You
know
he
has
important

connections

Well
,
then
,
you
just

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will

your
excellency

said
Timokhin
,
showing
by
his
smile
that
he
*NL*
understood
his
commander
's
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
regimental
commander
sought
out
Dolokhov
in
the
ranks
and
,
reining
*NL*
in
his
horse
,
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
next
affair
...
epaulettes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
looked
round
but
did
not
say
anything
,
nor
did
the
mocking
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
right
,
''
continued
the
regimental
commander
.
``
A
cup
of
*NL*
vodka
for
the
men
from
me

''
he
added
so
that
the
soldiers
could
hear
.
``
I
*NL*
thank
you
all
!
God
be
praised
!
''
and
he
rode
past
that
company
and
*NL*
overtook
the
next
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
really
a
good
fellow
,
one
can
serve
under
him

said
*NL*
Timokhin
to
the
subaltern
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
word
,
a
hearty
one

''
said
the
subaltern
,
laughing
-LRB-
the
*NL*
regimental
commander
was
nicknamed
King
of
Hearts
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cheerful
mood
of
their
officers
after
the
inspection
infected
the
*NL*
soldiers
.
The
company
marched
on
gaily
.
The
soldiers
'
voices
could
be
*NL*
heard
on
every
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
said
Kutuzov

Quite

along

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
,
friend
,
the
people
are
quite
beggarly
.
There
they
all
seemed
*NL*
to
be
Poles

all
under
the
Russian
crown
--
but
here
they
're
all
regular

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Singers
to
the
front
''
came
the
captain
's
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
from
the
different
ranks
some
twenty
men
ran
to
the
front
.
A
*NL*
drummer
,
their
leader
,
turned
round
facing
the
singers
,
and
flourishing
*NL*
his
arm
,
began
a
long-drawn-out
soldiers
'
song
,
commencing
with
the
*NL*
words
:
``
Morning
dawned
,
the
sun
was
rising
,
''
and
concluding
:
``
On
then
,
*NL*
brothers
,
on
to
glory
,
led
by
Father
Kamenski
.
''
This
song
had
been
*NL*
composed
in
the
Turkish
campaign
and
now
being
sung
in
Austria
,
the
only
*NL*
change
being
that
the
words
``
Father
Kamenski
''
were
replaced
by
``
Father
*NL*
Kutuzov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
jerked
out
these
last
words
as
soldiers
do
and
waved
his
arms
as
*NL*
if
flinging
something
to
the
ground
,
the
drummer
--
a
lean
,
handsome
*NL*
soldier
of
forty
--
looked
sternly
at
the
singers
and
screwed
up
his
eyes
.
*NL*
Then
having
satisfied
himself
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
,
he
raised
*NL*
both
arms
as
if
carefully
lifting
some
invisible
but
precious
object
*NL*
above
his
head
and
,
holding
it
there
for
some
seconds
,
suddenly
flung
it
*NL*
down
and
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
bower
,
oh
,
my
bower
...
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
bower
new
...
!
''
chimed
in
twenty
voices
,
and
the
castanet
player
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
his
equipment
,
rushed
out
to
the
front
and
,
*NL*
walking
backwards
before
the
company
,
jerked
his
shoulders
and
*NL*
flourished
his
castanets
as
if
threatening
someone
.
The
soldiers
,
*NL*
swinging
their
arms
and
keeping
time
spontaneously
,
marched
with
long
*NL*
steps
.
Behind
the
company
the
sound
of
wheels
,
the
creaking
of
springs
,
*NL*
and
the
tramp
of
horses
'
hoofs
were
heard
.
Kutuzov
and
his
suite
were
*NL*
returning
to
the
town
.
The
commander-in-chief
made
a
sign
that
the
men
*NL*
should
continue
to
march
at
ease
,
and
he
and
all
his
suite
showed
*NL*
pleasure
at
the
sound
of
the
singing
and
the
sight
of
the
dancing
*NL*
soldier
and
the
gay
and
smartly
marching
men
.
In
the
second
file
from
*NL*
the
right
flank
,
beside
which
the
carriage
passed
the
company
,
a
blue
-
*NL*
eyed
soldier
involuntarily
attracted
notice
.
It
was
Dolokhov
marching
*NL*
with
particular
grace
and
boldness
in
time
to
the
song
and
looking
at
*NL*
those
driving
past
as
if
he
pitied
all
who
were
not
at
that
moment
*NL*
marching
with
the
company
.
The
hussar
cornet
of
Kutuzov
's
suite
who
had
*NL*
mimicked
the
regimental
commander
,
fell
back
from
the
carriage
and
rode
*NL*
up
to
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hussar
cornet
Zherkov
had
at
one
time
,
in
Petersburg
,
belonged
to
the
*NL*
wild
set
led
by
Dolokhov
.
Zherkov
had
met
Dolokhov
abroad
as
a
private
*NL*
and
had
not
seen
fit
to
recognize
him
.
But
now
that
Kutuzov
had
spoken
*NL*
to
the
gentleman
ranker
,
he
addressed
him
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
how
are
you
?
''
said
he
through
the
singing
,
making
his
*NL*
horse
keep
pace
with
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
?
''
Dolokhov
answered
coldly
.
``
I
am
as
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lively
song
gave
a
special
flavor
to
the
tone
of
free
and
easy
*NL*
gaiety
with
which
Zherkov
spoke
,
and
to
the
intentional
coldness
of
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
get
on
with
the
officers
?
''
inquired
Zherkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
They
are
good
fellows
.
And
how
have
you
wriggled
onto
the
*NL*
staff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
attached
;
I
'm
on
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
let
the
hawk
fly
upward
from
her
wide
right
sleeve
,
''
went
the
song
,
*NL*
arousing
an
involuntary
sensation
of
courage
and
cheerfulness
.
Their
*NL*
conversation
would
probably
have
been
different
but
for
the
effect
of
*NL*
that
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
that
Austrians
have
been
beaten
?
''
asked
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
only
knows
!
They
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
,
''
answered
Dolokhov
briefly
and
clearly
,
as
the
song
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
come
round
some
evening
and
we
'll
have
a
game
of
faro
!
''
said
*NL*
Zherkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
have
you
too
much
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
.
I
've
sworn
not
to
.
I
wo
n't
drink
and
wo
n't
play
till
I
get
*NL*
reinstated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
only
till
the
first
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
again
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
if
you
need
anything
.
One
can
at
least
be
of
use
on
the
staff
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
smiled
.
``
Do
n't
trouble
.
If
I
want
anything
,
I
wo
n't
beg
--
I
'll
*NL*
take
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
;
I
only
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
only

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
health

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
,
long
way
.
To
my
native
land
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zherkov
touched
his
horse
with
the
spurs
;
it
pranced
excitedly
from
foot
*NL*
to
foot
uncertain
with
which
to
start
,
then
settled
down
,
galloped
past
*NL*
the
company
,
and
overtook
the
carriage
,
still
keeping
time
to
the
song
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
from
the
review
,
Kutuzov
took
the
Austrian
general
into
his
*NL*
private
room
and
,
calling
his
adjutant
,
asked
for
some
papers
relating
*NL*
to
the
condition
of
the
troops
on
their
arrival
,
and
the
letters
that
*NL*
had
come
from
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
,
who
was
in
command
of
the
advanced
*NL*
army
.
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
came
into
the
room
with
the
required
*NL*
papers
.
Kutuzov
and
the
Austrian
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
were
*NL*
sitting
at
the
table
on
which
a
plan
was
spread
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
...
''
said
Kutuzov
glancing
at
Bolkonski
as
if
by
this
exclamation
he
*NL*
was
asking
the
adjutant
to
wait
,
and
he
went
on
with
the
conversation
in
*NL*
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
can
say
,
General
,
''
said
he
with
a
pleasant
elegance
of
expression
*NL*
and
intonation
that
obliged
one
to
listen
to
each
deliberately
spoken
*NL*
word
.
It
was
evident
that
Kutuzov
himself
listened
with
pleasure
to
his
*NL*
own
voice
.
``
All
I
can
say
,
General
,
is
that
if
the
matter
depended
on
my
*NL*
personal
wishes
,
the
will
of
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
Francis
would
have
*NL*
been
fulfilled
long
ago
.
I
should
long
ago
have
joined
the
archduke
.
And
*NL*
believe
me
on
my
honour
that
to
me
personally
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
*NL*
hand
over
the
supreme
command
of
the
army
into
the
hands
of
a
better
*NL*
informed
and
more
skillful
general
--
of
whom
Austria
has
so
many
--
and
to
*NL*
lay
down
all
this
heavy
responsibility
.
But
circumstances
are
sometimes
*NL*
too
strong
for
us
,
General
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Kutuzov
smiled
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
,
``
You
are
quite
at
*NL*
liberty
not
to
believe
me
and
I
do
n't
even
care
whether
you
do
or
not
,
*NL*
but
you
have
no
grounds
for
telling
me
so
.
And
that
is
the
whole
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Austrian
general
looked
dissatisfied
,
but
had
no
option
but
to
reply
*NL*
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
querulous
and
angry
tone
that
*NL*
contrasted
with
his
flattering
words
,
``
on
the
contrary
,
your
*NL*
excellency
's
participation
in
the
common
action
is
highly
valued
by
His
*NL*
Majesty
;
but
we
think
the
present
delay
is
depriving
the
splendid
*NL*
Russian
troops
and
their
commander
of
the
laurels
they
have
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
win
in
their
battles
,
''
he
concluded
his
evidently
*NL*
prearranged
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
bowed
with
the
same
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
my
conviction
,
and
judging
by
the
last
letter
with
which
*NL*
His
Highness
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
has
honored
me
,
I
imagine
that
the
*NL*
Austrian
troops
,
under
the
direction
of
so
skillful
a
leader
as
General
*NL*
Mack
,
have
by
now
already
gained
a
decisive
victory
and
no
longer
need
*NL*
our
aid
,
''
said
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
frowned
.
Though
there
was
no
definite
news
of
an
Austrian
*NL*
defeat
,
there
were
many
circumstances
confirming
the
unfavorable
rumors
*NL*
that
were
afloat
,
and
so
Kutuzov
's
suggestion
of
an
Austrian
victory
*NL*
sounded
much
like
irony
.
But
Kutuzov
went
on
blandly
smiling
with
the
*NL*
same
expression
,
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
suppose
so
.
*NL*
And
,
in
fact
,
the
last
letter
he
had
received
from
Mack
's
army
informed
*NL*
him
of
a
victory
and
stated
strategically
the
position
of
the
army
was
*NL*
very
favorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
that
letter
,
''
said
Kutuzov
turning
to
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Please
*NL*
have
a
look
at
it
''
--
and
Kutuzov
with
an
ironical
smile
about
the
corners
*NL*
of
his
mouth
read
to
the
Austrian
general
the
following
passage
,
in
*NL*
German
,
from
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
's
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
fully
concentrated
forces
of
nearly
seventy
thousand
men
with
*NL*
which
to
attack
and
defeat
the
enemy
should
he
cross
the
Lech
.
Also
,
as
*NL*
we
are
masters
of
Ulm
,
we
can
not
be
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
*NL*
commanding
both
sides
of
the
Danube
,
so
that
should
the
enemy
not
cross
*NL*
the
Lech
,
we
can
cross
the
Danube
,
throw
ourselves
on
his
line
of
*NL*
communications
,
recross
the
river
lower
down
,
and
frustrate
his
*NL*
intention
should
he
try
to
direct
his
whole
force
against
our
faithful
*NL*
ally
.
We
shall
therefore
confidently
await
the
moment
when
the
Imperial
*NL*
Russian
army
will
be
fully
equipped
,
and
shall
then
,
in
conjunction
with
*NL*
it
,
easily
find
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
enemy
the
fate
he
deserves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
sighed
deeply
on
finishing
this
paragraph
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
mildly
and
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
the
wise
maxim
your
excellency
,
advising
one
to
expect
the
*NL*
worst
,
''
said
the
Austrian
general
,
evidently
wishing
to
have
done
with
*NL*
jests
and
to
come
to
business
.
He
involuntarily
looked
round
at
the
*NL*
aide-de-camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
General
,
''
interrupted
Kutuzov
,
also
turning
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
``
Look
here
,
my
dear
fellow
,
get
from
Kozlovski
all
the
reports
*NL*
from
our
scouts
.
Here
are
two
letters
from
Count
Nostitz
and
here
is
one
*NL*
from
His
Highness
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
here
are
these
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
handing
him
several
papers
,
``
make
a
neat
memorandum
in
French
out
of
all
*NL*
this
,
showing
all
the
news
we
have
had
of
the
movements
of
the
Austrian
*NL*
army
,
and
then
give
it
to
his
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
having
understood
from
the
*NL*
first
not
only
what
had
been
said
but
also
what
Kutuzov
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
tell
him
.
He
gathered
up
the
papers
and
with
a
bow
to
both
,
stepped
*NL*
softly
over
the
carpet
and
went
out
into
the
waiting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
not
much
time
had
passed
since
Prince
Andrew
had
left
Russia
,
he
*NL*
had
changed
greatly
during
that
period
.
In
the
expression
of
his
face
,
*NL*
in
his
movements
,
in
his
walk
,
scarcely
a
trace
was
left
of
his
former
*NL*
affected
languor
and
indolence
.
He
now
looked
like
a
man
who
has
time
to
*NL*
think
of
the
impression
he
makes
on
others
,
but
is
occupied
with
*NL*
agreeable
and
interesting
work
.
His
face
expressed
more
satisfaction
*NL*
with
himself
and
those
around
him
,
his
smile
and
glance
were
brighter
*NL*
and
more
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
whom
he
had
overtaken
in
Poland
,
had
received
him
very
kindly
,
*NL*
promised
not
to
forget
him
,
distinguished
him
above
the
other
adjutants
,
*NL*
and
had
taken
him
to
Vienna
and
given
him
the
more
serious
commissions
.
*NL*
From
Vienna
Kutuzov
wrote
to
his
old
comrade
,
Prince
Andrew
's
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
son
bids
fair
to
become
an
officer
distinguished
by
his
industry
,
*NL*
firmness
,
and
expedition
.
I
consider
myself
fortunate
to
have
such
a
*NL*
subordinate
by
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Kutuzov
's
staff
,
among
his
fellow
officers
and
in
the
army
generally
,
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
,
as
he
had
had
in
Petersburg
society
,
two
quite
*NL*
opposite
reputations
.
Some
,
a
minority
,
acknowledged
him
to
be
different
*NL*
from
themselves
and
from
everyone
else
,
expected
great
things
of
him
,
*NL*
listened
to
him
,
admired
,
and
imitated
him
,
and
with
them
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
was
natural
and
pleasant
.
Others
,
the
majority
,
disliked
him
and
*NL*
considered
him
conceited
,
cold
,
and
disagreeable
.
But
among
these
people
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
knew
how
to
take
his
stand
so
that
they
respected
and
even
*NL*
feared
him
.

*NL*
Coming
out
of
Kutuzov
's
room
into
the
waiting
room
with
the
papers
in
*NL*
his
hand
Prince
Andrew
came
up
to
his
comrade
,
the
aide-de-camp
on
duty
,
*NL*
Kozlovski
,
who
was
sitting
at
the
window
with
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Prince
?
''
asked
Kozlovski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ordered
to
write
a
memorandum
explaining
why
we
are
not
*NL*
advancing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
news
from
Mack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
true
that
he
has
been
beaten
,
news
would
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
moving
toward
the
outer
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
instant
a
tall
Austrian
general
in
a
greatcoat
,
with
the
*NL*
order
of
Maria
Theresa
on
his
neck
and
a
black
bandage
round
his
head
,
*NL*
who
had
evidently
just
arrived
,
entered
quickly
,
slamming
the
door
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Commander
in
Chief
Kutuzov
?
''
said
the
newly
arrived
general
speaking
*NL*
quickly
with
a
harsh
German
accent
,
looking
to
both
sides
and
advancing
*NL*
straight
toward
the
inner
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
commander-in-chief
is
engaged
,
''
said
Kozlovski
,
going
hurriedly
up
*NL*
to
the
unknown
general
and
blocking
his
way
to
the
door
.
``
Whom
shall
I
*NL*
announce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unknown
general
looked
disdainfully
down
at
Kozlovski
,
who
was
*NL*
rather
short
,
as
if
surprised
that
anyone
should
not
know
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
commander-in-chief
is
engaged
,
''
repeated
Kozlovski
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
's
face
clouded
,
his
lips
quivered
and
trembled
.
He
took
out
*NL*
a
notebook
,
hurriedly
scribbled
something
in
pencil
,
tore
out
the
leaf
,
*NL*
gave
it
to
Kozlovski
,
stepped
quickly
to
the
window
,
and
threw
himself
*NL*
into
a
chair
,
gazing
at
those
in
the
room
as
if
asking
,
``
Why
do
they
*NL*
look
at
me
?
''
Then
he
lifted
his
head
,
stretched
his
neck
as
if
he
*NL*
intended
to
say
something
,
but
immediately
,
with
affected
indifference
,
*NL*
began
to
hum
to
himself
,
producing
a
queer
sound
which
immediately
broke
*NL*
off
.
The
door
of
the
private
room
opened
and
Kutuzov
appeared
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
The
general
with
the
bandaged
head
bent
forward
as
though
*NL*
running
away
from
some
danger
,
and
,
making
long
,
quick
strides
with
his
*NL*
thin
legs
,
went
up
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vous
voyez
le
malheureux
Mack
,
''
he
uttered
in
a
broken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
face
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
remained
perfectly
*NL*
immobile
for
a
few
moments
.
Then
wrinkles
ran
over
his
face
like
a
wave
*NL*
and
his
forehead
became
smooth
again
,
he
bowed
his
head
respectfully
,
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
,
silently
let
Mack
enter
his
room
before
him
,
and
closed
*NL*
the
door
himself
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
report
which
had
been
circulated
that
the
Austrians
had
been
beaten
*NL*
and
that
the
whole
army
had
surrendered
at
Ulm
proved
to
be
correct
.
*NL*
Within
half
an
hour
adjutants
had
been
sent
in
various
directions
with
*NL*
orders
which
showed
that
the
Russian
troops
,
who
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
inactive
,
would
also
soon
have
to
meet
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
one
of
those
rare
staff
officers
whose
chief
interest
*NL*
lay
in
the
general
progress
of
the
war
.
When
he
saw
Mack
and
heard
the
*NL*
details
of
his
disaster
he
understood
that
half
the
campaign
was
lost
,
*NL*
understood
all
the
difficulties
of
the
Russian
army
's
position
,
and
*NL*
vividly
imagined
what
awaited
it
and
the
part
he
would
have
to
play
.
*NL*
Involuntarily
he
felt
a
joyful
agitation
at
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
humiliation
of
arrogant
Austria
and
that
in
a
week
's
time
he
might
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
see
and
take
part
in
the
first
Russian
encounter
with
the
*NL*
French
since
Suvorov
met
them
.
He
feared
that
Bonaparte
's
genius
might
*NL*
outweigh
all
the
courage
of
the
Russian
troops
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
could
not
admit
the
idea
of
his
hero
being
disgraced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excited
and
irritated
by
these
thoughts
Prince
Andrew
went
toward
his
*NL*
room
to
write
to
his
father
,
to
whom
he
wrote
every
day
.
In
the
corridor
*NL*
he
met
Nesvitski
,
with
whom
he
shared
a
room
,
and
the
wag
Zherkov
;
they
*NL*
were
as
usual
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
glum
?
''
asked
Nesvitski
noticing
Prince
Andrew
's
pale
*NL*
face
and
glittering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
be
gay
about
,
''
answered
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Prince
Andrew
met
Nesvitski
and
Zherkov
,
there
came
toward
them
*NL*
from
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
,
Strauch
,
an
Austrian
general
who
on
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
staff
in
charge
of
the
provisioning
of
the
Russian
army
,
and
*NL*
the
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
who
had
arrived
the
previous
evening
.
*NL*
There
was
room
enough
in
the
wide
corridor
for
the
generals
to
pass
the
*NL*
three
officers
quite
easily
,
but
Zherkov
,
pushing
Nesvitski
aside
with
*NL*
his
arm
,
said
in
a
breathless
voice
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
coming
!
...
they
're
coming
!
...
Stand
aside
,
make
way
,
please
*NL*
make
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
generals
were
passing
by
,
looking
as
if
they
wished
to
avoid
*NL*
embarrassing
attentions
.
On
the
face
of
the
wag
Zherkov
there
suddenly
*NL*
appeared
a
stupid
smile
of
glee
which
he
seemed
unable
to
suppress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
''
said
he
in
German
,
stepping
forward
and
addressing
*NL*
the
Austrian
general
,
``
I
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
his
head
and
scraped
first
with
one
foot
and
then
with
the
*NL*
other
,
awkwardly
,
like
a
child
at
a
dancing
lesson
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
member
of
the
Hofkriegsrath
looked
at
him
severely
but
,
seeing
the
*NL*
seriousness
of
his
stupid
smile
,
could
not
but
give
him
a
moment
's
*NL*
attention
.
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
showing
that
he
was
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
you
.
General
Mack
has
arrived
,
quite
*NL*
well
,
only
a
little
bruised
just
here
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
with
a
*NL*
beaming
smile
to
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
frowned
,
turned
away
,
and
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gott
,
wie
naiv
!
''
*
said
he
angrily
,
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Good
God
,
what
simplicity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
with
a
laugh
threw
his
arms
round
Prince
Andrew
,
but
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
turning
still
paler
,
pushed
him
away
with
an
angry
look
and
*NL*
turned
to
Zherkov
.
The
nervous
irritation
aroused
by
the
appearance
of
*NL*
Mack
,
the
news
of
his
defeat
,
and
the
thought
of
what
lay
before
the
*NL*
Russian
army
found
vent
in
anger
at
Zherkov
's
untimely
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
,
sir
,
choose
to
make
a
buffoon
of
yourself
,
''
he
said
sharply
,
*NL*
with
a
slight
trembling
of
the
lower
jaw
,
``
I
ca
n't
prevent
your
doing
*NL*
so
;
but
I
warn
you
that
if
you
dare
to
play
the
fool
in
my
presence
,
I
*NL*
will
teach
you
to
behave
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
and
Zherkov
were
so
surprised
by
this
outburst
that
they
gazed
*NL*
at
Bolkonski
silently
with
wide-open
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
I
only
congratulated
them
,
''
said
Zherkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
jesting
with
you
;
please
be
silent
!
''
cried
Bolkonski
,
and
*NL*
taking
Nesvitski
's
arm
he
left
Zherkov
,
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
what
's
the
matter
,
old
fellow
?
''
said
Nesvitski
trying
to
soothe
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
exclaimed
Prince
Andrew
standing
still
in
his
*NL*
excitement
.
``
Do
n't
you
understand
that
either
we
are
officers
serving
*NL*
our
Tsar
and
our
country
,
rejoicing
in
the
successes
and
grieving
at
the
*NL*
misfortunes
of
our
common
cause
,
or
we
are
merely
lackeys
who
care
*NL*
nothing
for
their
master
's
business

''
*
*NL*
he
said
,
as
if
strengthening
his
views
by
this
French
sentence
.
``
C'est
*NL*
bien
pour
un
garcon
de
rien
comme
cet
individu
dont

avez
fait

Only
a
hobbledehoy
could
*NL*
amuse
himself
in
this
way
,
''
he
added
in
Russian
--
but
pronouncing
the
*NL*
word
with
a
French
accent
--
having
noticed
that
Zherkov
could
still
hear
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Forty
thousand
men
massacred
and
the
army
of

-LRB-

``
It
is
all

well

not

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
moment
to
see
whether
the
cornet
would
answer
,
but
he
turned
*NL*
and
went
out
of
the
corridor

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pavlograd
Hussars
were
stationed
two
miles
from
Braunau
.
The
*NL*
squadron
in
which
Nicholas
Rostov
served
as
a
cadet
was
quartered
in
the
*NL*
German
village
of
Salzeneck
.
The
best
quarters
in
the
village
were
*NL*
assigned
to
cavalry-captain
Denisov
,
the
squadron
commander
,
known
*NL*
throughout
the
whole
cavalry
division
as
Vaska
Denisov
.
Cadet
Rostov
,
*NL*
ever
since
he
had
overtaken
the
regiment
in
Poland
,
had
lived
with
the
*NL*
squadron
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
October
11
,
the
day
when
all
was
astir
at
headquarters
over
the
news
*NL*
of
Mack
's
defeat
,
the
camp
life
of
the
officers
of
this
squadron
was
*NL*
proceeding
as
usual
.
Denisov
,
who
had
been
losing
at
cards
all
night
,
*NL*
had
not
yet
come
home
when
Rostov
rode
back
early
in
the
morning
from
a
*NL*
foraging
expedition
.
Rostov
in
his
cadet
uniform
,
with
a
jerk
to
his
*NL*
horse
,
rode
up
to
the
porch
,
swung
his
leg
over
the
saddle
with
a
supple
*NL*
youthful
movement
,
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
stirrup
as
if
loathe
to
*NL*
part
from
his
horse
,
and
at
last
sprang
down
and
called
to
his
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Bondarenko
,
dear
friend
!
''
said
he
to
the
hussar
who
rushed
up
*NL*
headlong
to
the
horse
.
``
Walk
him
up
and
down
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
with
that
gay
brotherly
cordiality
which
goodhearted
young
*NL*
people
show
to
everyone
when
they
are
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
''
answered
the
Ukrainian
gaily
,
tossing
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
walk
him
up
and
down
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
hussar
also
rushed
toward
the
horse
,
but
Bondarenko
had
already
*NL*
thrown
the
reins
of
the
snaffle
bridle
over
the
horse
's
head
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
cadet
was
liberal
with
his
tips
and
that
it
paid
to
*NL*
serve
him
.
Rostov
patted
the
horse
's
neck
and
then
his
flank
,
and
*NL*
lingered
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
What
a
horse
he
will
be
!
''
he
thought
with
a
smile
,
and
*NL*
holding
up
his
saber
,
his
spurs
jingling
,
he
ran
up
the
steps
of
the
*NL*
porch
.
His
landlord
,
who
in
a
waistcoat
and
a
pointed
cap
,
pitchfork
in
*NL*
hand
,
was
clearing
manure
from
the
cowhouse
,
looked
out
,
and
his
face
*NL*
immediately
brightened
on
seeing
Rostov
.
``
Schon
gut
Morgen
!
Schon
gut
*NL*
Morgen
!
''
*
he
said
winking
with
a
merry
smile
,
evidently
pleased
to
*NL*
greet
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
A
very
good
morning
!
A
very
good
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Schon
fleissig
?
''
*
said
Rostov
with
the
same
gay
brotherly
smile
which
*NL*
did
not
leave
his
eager
face
.
``
Hoch
Oestreicher
!
Hoch
Russen
!
Kaiser
*NL*
Alexander
hoch
!
''
*
-LRB-

-RRB-
said
he
,
quoting
words
often
repeated
by
the
*NL*
German
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Busy
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
-LRB-

-RRB-
``
Hurrah
for
the
Austrians
!
Hurrah
for
the
Russians
!
Hurrah
for
*NL*
Emperor
Alexander
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
German
laughed
,
came
out
of
the
cowshed
,
pulled
off
his
cap
,
and
*NL*
waving
it
above
his
head
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Und
die
ganze
Welt
hoch
!
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
And
hurrah
for
the
whole
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
waved
his
cap
above
his
head
like
the
German
and
cried
laughing
,
*NL*
``
Und
vivat
die
ganze
Welt
!
''
Though
neither
the
German
cleaning
his
*NL*
cowshed
nor
Rostov
back
with
his
platoon
from
foraging
for
hay
had
any
*NL*
reason
for
rejoicing
,
they
looked
at
each
other
with
joyful
delight
and
*NL*
brotherly
love
,
wagged
their
heads
in
token
of
their
mutual
affection
,
*NL*
and
parted
smiling
,
the
German
returning
to
his
cowshed
and
Rostov
going
*NL*
to
the
cottage
he
occupied
with
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
your
master
?
''
he
asked
Lavrushka
,
Denisov
's
orderly
,
whom
*NL*
all
the
regiment
knew
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
been
in
since
the
evening

Must
have
been
losing

''
answered
*NL*
Lavrushka
.
``
I
know
by
now
,
if
he
wins
he
comes
back
early
to
brag
about
*NL*
it
,
but
if
he
stays
out
till
morning
it
means
he
's
lost
and
will
come
*NL*
back
in
a
rage
.
Will
you
have
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
bring
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
minutes
later
Lavrushka
brought
the
coffee
.
``
He
's
coming
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
Now
for
trouble
!
''
Rostov
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
Denisov
*NL*
coming
home
.
Denisov
was
a
small
man
with
a
red
face
,
sparkling
black
*NL*
eyes
,
and
black
tousled
mustache
and
hair
.
He
wore
an
unfastened
cloak
,
*NL*
wide
breeches
hanging
down
in
creases
,
and
a
crumpled
shako
on
the
back
*NL*
of
his
head
.
He
came
up
to
the
porch
gloomily
,
hanging
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lavwuska
!
''
he
shouted
loudly
and
angrily
,
``
take
it
off
,
blockhead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
taking
it
off
,
''
replied
Lavrushka
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
up
already
,
''
said
Denisov
,
entering
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
ago
,
''
answered
Rostov
,
``
I
have
already
been
for
the
hay
,
and
have
*NL*
seen
Fraulein
Mathilde

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weally
!
And
I
've
been
losing

I
lost

cried
Denisov
,
not
pronouncing
his
r
's
.
``
Such
ill
luck
!
Such
ill
*NL*
luck

As
soon
as
you
left
,
it
began
and
went
on

Hullo
there
!
Tea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Puckering
up
his
face
though
smiling
,
and
showing
his
short
strong
*NL*
teeth
,
he
began
with
stubby
fingers
of
both
hands
to
ruffle
up
his
thick
*NL*
tangled
black
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
devil
made
me
go
to
that
wat
?
''
-LRB-
an
officer
nicknamed
``
the
*NL*
rat
''
-RRB-
he
said
,
rubbing
his
forehead
and
whole
face
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
``
Just
fancy
,
he
did
n't
let
me
win
a
single
cahd
,
not
one
cahd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
lighted
pipe
that
was
offered
to
him
,
gripped
it
in
his
*NL*
fist
,
and
tapped
it
on
the
floor
,
making
the
sparks
fly
,
while
he
*NL*
continued
to
shout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lets
one
win
the
singles
and
collahs
it
as
soon
as
one
doubles
it
;
*NL*
gives
the
singles
and
snatches
the
doubles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
scattered
the
burning
tobacco
,
smashed
the
pipe
,
and
threw
it
away
.
*NL*
Then
he
remained
silent
for
a
while
,
and
all
at
once
looked
cheerfully
*NL*
with
his
glittering
,
black
eyes
at
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
at
least
we
had
some
women
here
;
but
there
's
nothing
foh
one
to
do
*NL*
but
dwink
.
If
we
could
only
get
to
fighting
soon
.
Hullo
,
who
's
there
?
''
*NL*
he
said
,
turning
to
the
door
as
he
heard
a
tread
of
heavy
boots
and
the
*NL*
clinking
of
spurs
that
came
to
a
stop
,
and
a
respectful
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
squadron
quartermaster
!
''
said
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
's
face
puckered
still
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wetched
!
''
he
muttered
,
throwing
down
a
purse
with
some
gold
in
it
.
*NL*
``
Wostov
,
deah
fellow
,
just
see
how
much
there
is
left
and
shove
the
*NL*
purse
undah
the
pillow
,
''
he
said
,
and
went
out
to
the
quartermaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
took
the
money
and
,
mechanically
arranging
the
old
and
new
coins
*NL*
in
separate
piles
,
began
counting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Telyanin
!
How
d'ye
do
?
They
plucked
me
last
night
,
''
came
Denisov
's
*NL*
voice
from
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
At
Bykov
's
,
at
the
rat
's
...
I
knew
it
,
''
replied
a
piping
voice
,
*NL*
and
Lieutenant
Telyanin
,
a
small
officer
of
the
same
squadron
,
entered
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
thrust
the
purse
under
the
pillow
and
shook
the
damp
little
hand
*NL*
which
was
offered
him
.
Telyanin
for
some
reason
had
been
transferred
*NL*
from
the
Guards
just
before
this
campaign
.
He
behaved
very
well
in
the
*NL*
regiment
but
was
not
liked
;
Rostov
especially
detested
him
and
was
*NL*
unable
to
overcome
or
conceal
his
groundless
antipathy
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
cavalryman
,
how
is
my
Rook
behaving
?
''
he
asked
.
-LRB-
Rook
was
a
*NL*
young
horse
Telyanin
had
sold
to
Rostov
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
never
looked
the
man
he
was
speaking
to
straight
in
the
*NL*
face
;
his
eyes
continually
wandered
from
one
object
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
riding
this
morning
...
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
all
right
,
a
good
horse
,
''
answered
Rostov
,
though
the
horse
*NL*
for
which
he
had
paid
seven
hundred
rubbles
was
not
worth
half
that
sum
.
*NL*
``
He
's
begun
to
go
a
little
lame
on
the
left
foreleg
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hoof
's
cracked
!
That
's
nothing
.
I
'll
teach
you
what
to
do
and
show
*NL*
you
what
kind
of
rivet
to
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
do
,
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
,
I
'll
show
you
!
It
's
not
a
secret
.
And
it
's
a
horse
*NL*
you
'll
thank
me
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
have
it
brought
round
,
''
said
Rostov
wishing
to
avoid
*NL*
Telyanin
,
and
he
went
out
to
give
the
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
passage
Denisov
,
with
a
pipe
,
was
squatting
on
the
threshold
*NL*
facing
the
quartermaster
who
was
reporting
to
him
.
On
seeing
Rostov
,
*NL*
Denisov
screwed
up
his
face
and
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
*NL*
thumb
to
the
room
where
Telyanin
was
sitting
,
he
frowned
and
gave
a
*NL*
shudder
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
!
I
do
n't
like
that
fellow
,
''
he
said
,
regardless
of
the
*NL*
quartermaster
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
Nor
do
I
,
but
what
's
*NL*
one
to
do
?
''
and
,
having
given
his
order
,
he
returned
to
Telyanin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Telyanin
was
sitting
in
the
same
indolent
pose
in
which
Rostov
had
left
*NL*
him
,
rubbing
his
small
white
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
there
certainly
are
disgusting
people
,
''
thought
Rostov
as
he
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
them
to
bring
the
horse
?
''
asked
Telyanin
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
looking
carelessly
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
ourselves
.
I
only
came
round
to
ask
Denisov
about
yesterday
's
*NL*
order
.
Have
you
got
it
,
Denisov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
But
where
are
you
off
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
teach
this
young
man
how
to
shoe
a
horse
,
''
said
Telyanin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
through
the
porch
and
into
the
stable
.
The
lieutenant
*NL*
explained
how
to
rivet
the
hoof
and
went
away
to
his
own
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rostov
went
back
there
was
a
bottle
of
vodka
and
a
sausage
on
the
*NL*
table
.
Denisov
was
sitting
there
scratching
with
his
pen
on
a
sheet
of
*NL*
paper
.
He
looked
gloomily
in
Rostov
's
face
and
said
:
``
I
am
witing
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and
,
*NL*
evidently
glad
of
a
chance
to
say
quicker
in
words
what
he
wanted
to
*NL*
write
,
told
Rostov
the
contents
of
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
fwiend
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
sleep
when
we
do
n't
love

We
are
*NL*
childwen
of
the
dust

but
one
falls
in
love

one
is
a

Who
's
that
now

Send
him

*NL*
devil

he
shouted
to
Lavrushka
,
who
went
up
to
him
not
in
the
*NL*
least
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
it
be

You
yourself
told
him
to
come

It
's
the
quartermaster
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
frowned
and
was
about
to
shout
some
reply
but
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wetched
business
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
``
How
much
is
left
in
the
*NL*
puhse

he
asked
,
turning
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
new
and
three
old
imperials

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Call

he
shouted
to
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please

Denisov
,
let
me
lend
you
some
:
I
have
some

said
*NL*
Rostov
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
like
bowwowing
from
my
own
fellows

I

growled
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Rostov
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
tell
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Denisov
went
to
the
bed
to
get
the
purse
from
under
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
put
it

Wostov

*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
lower

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
threw
both
pillows
on
the
floor

The
purse
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
miwacle

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
have
n't
you
dropped
it

said
Rostov
,
picking
up
the
pillows
one
*NL*
at
a
time
and
shaking
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
off
the
quilt
and
shook
it
.
The
purse
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
can
I
have
forgotten

No

I
remember
thinking
that
you
kept
it
*NL*
under
your

like
a
treasure

''
said
Rostov
.
``
I
put
it
just
here
.
*NL*
Where
is
it

he
asked
,
turning
to
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
been
in
the

It
must
be
where

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
if
I
had
n't
thought
of
it
being
a
treasure

''
said
Rostov
,
``
but
I
*NL*
remember
putting
it
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lavrushka
turned
all
the
bedding
over
,
looked
under
the
bed
and
under
*NL*
the
table
,
searched
everywhere
,
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
.
Denisov
silently
watched
Lavrushka
's
movements
,
and
when
the
*NL*
latter
threw
up
his
arms
in
surprise
saying
it
was
nowhere
to
be
found
*NL*
Denisov
glanced
at
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wostov
,
you
've
not
been
playing
schoolboy
twicks
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
felt
Denisov
's
gaze
fixed
on
him
,
raised
his
eyes
,
and
instantly
*NL*
dropped
them
again
.
All
the
blood
which
had
seemed
congested
somewhere
*NL*
below
his
throat
rushed
to
his
face
and
eyes
.
He
could
not
draw
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
has
n't
been
anyone
in
the
room

the
lieutenant

yourselves

It

somewhere

said
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then

you
devil
's
puppet

look
alive

hunt
for
it

shouted
*NL*
Denisov
,
suddenly
,
turning
purple
and
rushing
at
the
man
with
a
*NL*
threatening
gesture
.
``
If
the
purse
is
n't
found
I
'll
flog
you
,
I
'll
flog
*NL*
you
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
his
eyes
avoiding
Denisov
,
began
buttoning
his
coat
,
buckled
on
*NL*
his
saber
,
and
put
on
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
that
purse
,
I
tell
you
,
''
shouted
Denisov
,
shaking
his
*NL*
orderly
by
the
shoulders
and
knocking
him
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Denisov
,
let
him
alone
,
I
know
who
has
taken
it

''
said
Rostov
,
going
*NL*
toward
the
door
without
raising
his
eyes
.
Denisov
paused
,
thought
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
,
evidently
understanding
what
Rostov
hinted
at
,
seized
his
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
he
cried
,
and
the
veins
on
his
forehead
and
neck
stood
out
*NL*
like
cords
.
``
You
are
mad
,
I
tell
you

I
wo
n't
allow
it

The
purse
is
*NL*
here

I
'll
flay
this

alive

it
will
be
found

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
who
has
taken
it
,
''
repeated
Rostov
in
an
unsteady
voice
,
and
*NL*
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
,
do
n't
you
dahe
to
do
it

''
shouted
Denisov
,
rushing
at
*NL*
the
cadet
to
restrain
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rostov
pulled
away
his
arm
and
,
with
as
much
anger
as
though
Denisov
*NL*
were
his
worst
enemy
,
firmly
fixed
his
eyes
directly
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
what
you
're
saying

he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
.
*NL*
``
There
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
except
myself
.
So
that
if
it
is
not
*NL*
so
,
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
finish
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
may
the
devil
take
you
and
evewybody
,
''
were
the
last
words
Rostov
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
went
to
Telyanin
's
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
master
is
not
in
,
he
's
gone
to
headquarters
,
''
said
Telyanin
's
*NL*
orderly
.
``
Has
something
happened
?
''
he
added
,
surprised
at
the
cadet
's
*NL*
troubled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
only
just
missed
him
,
''
said
the
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
headquarters
were
situated
two
miles
away
from
Salzeneck
,
and
*NL*
Rostov
,
without
returning
home
,
took
a
horse
and
rode
there
.
There
was
*NL*
an
inn
in
the
village
which
the
officers
frequented
.
Rostov
rode
up
to
*NL*
it
and
saw
Telyanin
's
horse
at
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
room
of
the
inn
the
lieutenant
was
sitting
over
a
dish
of
*NL*
sausages
and
a
bottle
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
've
come
here
too
,
young
man
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
and
raising
his
*NL*
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Rostov
as
if
it
cost
him
a
great
deal
to
utter
the
word
;
and
*NL*
he
sat
down
at
the
nearest
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
were
silent
.
There
were
two
Germans
and
a
Russian
officer
in
the
*NL*
room
.
No
one
spoke
and
the
only
sounds
heard
were
the
clatter
of
knives
*NL*
and
the
munching
of
the
lieutenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Telyanin
had
finished
his
lunch
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
double
*NL*
purse
and
,
drawing
its
rings
aside
with
his
small
,
white
,
turned-up
*NL*
fingers
,
drew
out
a
gold
imperial
,
and
lifting
his
eyebrows
gave
it
to
*NL*
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
be
quick
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coin
was
a
new
one
.
Rostov
rose
and
went
up
to
Telyanin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
look
at
your
purse
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
,
almost
inaudible
,
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
shifting
eyes
but
eyebrows
still
raised
,
Telyanin
handed
him
the
*NL*
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
nice
purse
.
Yes
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
growing
suddenly
pale
,
and
*NL*
added
,
``
Look
at
it
,
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
took
the
purse
in
his
hand
,
examined
it
and
the
money
in
it
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
Telyanin
.
The
lieutenant
was
looking
about
in
his
usual
way
*NL*
and
suddenly
seemed
to
grow
very
merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
get
to
Vienna
I
'll
get
rid
of
it
there
but
in
these
wretched
*NL*
little
towns
there
's
nowhere
to
spend
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
Well
,
let
me
have
*NL*
it
,
young
man
,
I
'm
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
Are
you
going
to
have
lunch
too
?
They
feed
you
quite
decently
*NL*
here
,
''
continued
Telyanin
.
``
Now
then
,
let
me
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
purse
.
Rostov
let
go
of
*NL*
it
.
Telyanin
took
the
purse
and
began
carelessly
slipping
it
into
the
*NL*
pocket
of
his
riding
breeches
,
with
his
eyebrows
lifted
and
his
mouth
*NL*
slightly
open
,
as
if
to
say
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
am
putting
my
purse
in
my
*NL*
pocket
and
that
's
quite
simple
and
is
no
one
else
's
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
man
?
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
,
and
from
under
his
lifted
brows
*NL*
he
glanced
into
Rostov
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
flash
as
of
an
electric
spark
shot
from
Telyanin
's
eyes
to
Rostov
's
*NL*
and
back
,
and
back
again
and
again
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
''
said
Rostov
,
catching
hold
of
Telyanin
's
arm
and
almost
*NL*
dragging
him
to
the
window
.
``
That
money
is
Denisov
's
;
you
took
it
...
''
he
*NL*
whispered
just
above
Telyanin
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
?
How
dare
you
?
What
?
''
said
Telyanin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
words
came
like
a
piteous
,
despairing
cry
and
an
entreaty
for
*NL*
pardon
.
As
soon
as
Rostov
heard
them
,
an
enormous
load
of
doubt
fell
*NL*
from
him
.
He
was
glad
,
and
at
the
same
instant
began
to
pity
the
*NL*
miserable
man
who
stood
before
him
,
but
the
task
he
had
begun
had
to
be
*NL*
completed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
only
knows
what
the
people
here
may
imagine
,
''
muttered
Telyanin
,
*NL*
taking
up
his
cap
and
moving
toward
a
small
empty
room
.
``
We
must
have
an
*NL*
explanation
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
and
shall
prove
it
,
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
muscle
of
Telyanin
's
pale
,
terrified
face
began
to
quiver
,
his
*NL*
eyes
still
shifted
from
side
to
side
but
with
a
downward
look
not
rising
*NL*
to
Rostov
's
face
,
and
his
sobs
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
!
...
Do
n't
ruin
a
young
fellow
...
here
is
this
wretched
money
,
*NL*
take
it
...
''
He
threw
it
on
the
table
.
``
I
have
an
old
father
and
*NL*
mother
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
took
the
money
,
avoiding
Telyanin
's
eyes
,
and
went
out
of
the
*NL*
room
without
a
word
.
But
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
then
retraced
his
*NL*
steps
.
``
O
God
,
''
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
``
how
could
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
...
''
said
Telyanin
drawing
nearer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
,
''
said
Rostov
,
drawing
back
.
``
If
you
need
it
,
take
the
*NL*
money
,
''
and
he
threw
the
purse
to
him
and
ran
out
of
the
inn
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
there
was
an
animated
discussion
among
the
squadron
's
*NL*
officers
in
Denisov
's
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
,
Rostov
,
that
you
must
apologize
to
the
colonel
!
''
said
a
*NL*
tall
,
grizzly-haired
staff
captain
,
with
enormous
mustaches
and
many
*NL*
wrinkles
on
his
large
features
,
to
Rostov
who
was
crimson
with
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staff
captain
,
Kirsten
,
had
twice
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
for
*NL*
affairs
of
honor
and
had
twice
regained
his
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
allow
no
one
to
call
me
a
liar
!
''
cried
Rostov
.
``
He
told
me
I
*NL*
lied
,
and
I
told
him
he
lied
.
And
there
it
rests
.
He
may
keep
me
on
duty
*NL*
every
day
,
or
may
place
me
under
arrest
,
but
no
one
can
make
me
*NL*
apologize
,
because
if
he
,
as
commander
of
this
regiment
,
thinks
it
*NL*
beneath
his
dignity
to
give
me
satisfaction
,
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
just
wait
a
moment
,
my
dear
fellow
,
and
listen
,
''
interrupted
the
*NL*
staff
captain
in
his
deep
bass
,
calmly
stroking
his
long
mustache
.
``
You
*NL*
tell
the
colonel
in
the
presence
of
other
officers
that
an
officer
has
*NL*
stolen
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
to
blame
that
the
conversation
began
in
the
presence
of
other
*NL*
officers
.
Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
spoken
before
them
,
but
I
am
not
a
*NL*
diplomatist
.
That
's
why
I
joined
the
hussars
,
thinking
that
here
one
*NL*
would
not
need
finesse
;
and
he
tells
me
that
I
am
lying
--
so
let
him
give
*NL*
me
satisfaction
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
.
No
one
thinks
you
a
coward
,
but
that
's
not
the
point
.
*NL*
Ask
Denisov
whether
it
is
not
out
of
the
question
for
a
cadet
to
demand
*NL*
satisfaction
of
his
regimental
commander
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
sat
gloomily
biting
his
mustache
and
listening
to
the
*NL*
conversation
,
evidently
with
no
wish
to
take
part
in
it
.
He
answered
the
*NL*
staff
captain
's
question
by
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
to
the
colonel
about
this
nasty
business
before
other
*NL*
officers
,
''
continued
the
staff
captain
,
``
and
Bogdanich
''
-LRB-
the
colonel
was
*NL*
called
Bogdanich
-RRB-
``
shuts
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
shut
me
up
,
he
said
I
was
telling
an
untruth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
it
so
,
and
you
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
him
and
must
*NL*
apologize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
any
account
!
''
exclaimed
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
this
of
you
,
''
said
the
staff
captain
seriously
and
*NL*
severely
.
``
You
do
n't
wish
to
apologize
,
but
,
man
,
it
's
not
only
to
him
*NL*
but
to
the
whole
regiment
--
all
of
us
--
you
're
to
blame
all
round
.
The
*NL*
case
is
this
:
you
ought
to
have
thought
the
matter
over
and
taken
*NL*
advice
;
but
no
,
you
go
and
blurt
it
all
straight
out
before
the
*NL*
officers
.
Now
what
was
the
colonel
to
do
?
Have
the
officer
tried
and
*NL*
disgrace
the
whole
regiment
?
Disgrace
the
whole
regiment
because
of
one
*NL*
scoundrel
?
Is
that
how
you
look
at
it
?
We
do
n't
see
it
like
that
.
And
*NL*
Bogdanich
was
a
brick
:
he
told
you
you
were
saying
what
was
not
true
.
*NL*
It
's
not
pleasant
,
but
what
's
to
be
done
,
my
dear
fellow
?
You
landed
*NL*
yourself
in
it
.
And
now
,
when
one
wants
to
smooth
the
thing
over
,
some
*NL*
conceit
prevents
your
apologizing
,
and
you
wish
to
make
the
whole
affair
*NL*
public
.
You
are
offended
at
being
put
on
duty
a
bit
,
but
why
not
*NL*
apologize
to
an
old
and
honorable
officer
?
Whatever
Bogdanich
may
be
,
*NL*
anyway
he
is
an
honorable
and
brave
old
colonel
!
You
're
quick
at
taking
*NL*
offense
,
but
you
do
n't
mind
disgracing
the
whole
regiment
!
''
The
staff
*NL*
captain
's
voice
began
to
tremble
.
``
You
have
been
in
the
regiment
next
to
*NL*
no
time
,
my
lad
,
you
're
here
today
and
tomorrow
you
'll
be
appointed
*NL*
adjutant
somewhere
and
can
snap
your
fingers
when
it
is
said
`
There
are
*NL*
thieves
among
the
Pavlograd
officers
!
'
But
it
's
not
all
the
same
to
us
!
*NL*
Am
I
not
right
,
Denisov
?
It
's
not
the
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
remained
silent
and
did
not
move
,
but
occasionally
looked
with
*NL*
his
glittering
black
eyes
at
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
value
your
own
pride
and
do
n't
wish
to
apologize
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
staff
captain
,
``
but
we
old
fellows
,
who
have
grown
up
in
and
,
God
*NL*
willing
,
are
going
to
die
in
the
regiment
,
we
prize
the
honor
of
the
*NL*
regiment
,
and
Bogdanich
knows
it

Oh
,
we
do
prize
it
,
old
fellow
!
And
*NL*
all
this
is
not
right
,
it
's
not
right
!
You
may
take
offense
or
not
but
I
*NL*
always
stick
to
mother
truth

It
's
not
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
staff
captain
rose
and
turned
away
from
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
twue
,
devil
take
it

shouted
Denisov
,
jumping
up
.
``
Now
then
,
*NL*
Wostov
,
now
then

''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
growing
red
and
pale
alternately
,
looked
first
at
one
officer
*NL*
and
then
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
gentlemen
,
no

you
must
n't

quite
understand

wrong

show

Well

never

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

that
's
right

Count

cried
the
staff
captain
,
turning
round
and
*NL*
clapping
Rostov
on
the
shoulder
with
his
big
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you

''
shouted
Denisov
,
``
he
's
a
fine
fellow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better

Count

said
the
staff
captain
,
beginning
to
address
*NL*
Rostov
by
his
title
,
as
if
in
recognition
of
his
confession
.
``
Go
and
*NL*
apologize

your
excellency

Yes

go

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

I
'll
do
anything

No

said
*NL*
Rostov
in
an
imploring
voice
,
``

I

apologize

asking

forgiveness

*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
worse
for
you

Bogdanich
is
vindictive
and
you
'll
pay
for

said
Kirsten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

on

said
the
staff
captain
.
``
And
what
has
become
*NL*
of
that
scoundrel

he
asked
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
weported
himself
sick

he
's

*NL*

Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
illness

there
's
no
other
way
of
explaining
it

said
the

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Illness
or
not

he
'd
better
not
cwoss

I
'd
kill
him

shouted
*NL*
Denisov
in
a
bloodthirsty
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Zherkov
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brings
you
here
?
''
cried
the
officers
turning
to
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
to
go
into

With

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

general
complained

I
congratulated
him
on

What

You

*NL*
The
regimental
adjutant
came
in

confirmed
the

brought

were
under

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
fell
back
toward
Vienna
,
destroying
behind
him
the
bridges
over
*NL*
the
rivers
Inn
-LRB-
at
Braunau
-RRB-
and
Traun
-LRB-
near
Linz
-RRB-
.
On
October
23
the
*NL*
Russian
troops
were
crossing
the
river
Enns
.
At
midday
the
Russian
*NL*
baggage
train
,
the
artillery
,
and
columns
of
troops
were
defiling
*NL*
through
the
town
of
Enns
on
both
sides
of
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
rainy
,
autumnal
day
.
The
wide
expanse
that
opened
out
*NL*
before
the
heights
on
which
the
Russian
batteries
stood
guarding
the
*NL*
bridge
was
at
times
veiled
by
a
diaphanous
curtain
of
slanting
rain
,
and
*NL*
then
,
suddenly
spread
out
in
the
sunlight
,
far-distant
objects
could
be
*NL*
clearly
seen
glittering
as
though
freshly
varnished
.
Down
below
,
the
*NL*
little
town
could
be
seen
with
its
white
,
red-roofed
houses
,
its
*NL*
cathedral
,
and
its
bridge
,
on
both
sides
of
which
streamed
jostling
*NL*
masses
of
Russian
troops
.
At
the
bend
of
the
Danube
,
vessels
,
an
island
,
*NL*
and
a
castle
with
a
park
surrounded
by
the
waters
of
the
confluence
of
*NL*
the
Enns
and
the
Danube
became
visible
,
and
the
rocky
left
bank
of
the
*NL*
Danube
covered
with
pine
forests
,
with
a
mystic
background
of
green
*NL*
treetops
and
bluish
gorges
.
The
turrets
of
a
convent
stood
out
beyond
a
*NL*
wild
virgin
pine
forest
,
and
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
Enns
the
*NL*
enemy
's
horse
patrols
could
be
discerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
field
guns
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
general
in
command
of
*NL*
the
rearguard
stood
with
a
staff
officer
,
scanning
the
country
through
*NL*
his
fieldglass
.
A
little
behind
them
Nesvitski
,
who
had
been
sent
to
the
*NL*
rearguard
by
the
commander-in-chief
,
was
sitting
on
the
trail
of
a
gun
*NL*
carriage
.
A
Cossack
who
accompanied
him
had
handed
him
a
knapsack
and
a
*NL*
flask
,
and
Nesvitski
was
treating
some
officers
to
pies
and
real
*NL*
doppelkummel
.
The
officers
gladly
gathered
round
him
,
some
on
their
*NL*
knees
,
some
squatting
Turkish
fashion
on
the
wet
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
Austrian
prince
who
built
that
castle
was
no
fool
.
It
's
a
fine
*NL*
place
!
Why
are
you
not
eating
anything
,
gentlemen
?
''
Nesvitski
was
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
Prince
,
''
answered
one
of
the
officers
,
pleased
to
*NL*
be
talking
to
a
staff
officer
of
such
importance
.
``
It
's
a
lovely
place
!
*NL*
We
passed
close
to
the
park
and
saw
two
deer
...
and
what
a
splendid
*NL*
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Prince
,
''
said
another
,
who
would
have
dearly
liked
to
take
*NL*
another
pie
but
felt
shy
,
and
therefore
pretended
to
be
examining
the
*NL*
countryside
--
``
See
,
our
infantrymen
have
already
got
there
.
Look
there
in
*NL*
the
meadow
behind
the
village
,
three
of
them
are
dragging
something
.
*NL*
They
'll
ransack
that
castle
,
''
he
remarked
with
evident
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
will
,
''
said
Nesvitski
.
``
No
,
but
what
I
should
like
,
''
added
he
,
*NL*
munching
a
pie
in
his
moist-lipped
handsome
mouth
,
``
would
be
to
slip
in
*NL*
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
with
a
smile
to
a
turreted
nunnery
,
and
his
eyes
narrowed
and
*NL*
gleamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
fine
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
to
flutter
the
nuns
a
bit
.
They
say
there
are
Italian
girls
among
*NL*
them
.
On
my
word
I
'd
give
five
years
of
my
life
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
be
feeling
dull
,
too
,
''
said
one
of
the
bolder
officers
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
staff
officer
standing
in
front
pointed
out
something
to
*NL*
the
general
,
who
looked
through
his
field
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
it
is
,
so
it
is
,
''
said
the
general
angrily
,
lowering
the
field
*NL*
glass
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
``
so
it
is
!
They
'll
be
fired
on
at
the
*NL*
crossing
.
And
why
are
they
dawdling
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
opposite
side
the
enemy
could
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
,
and
from
*NL*
their
battery
a
milk-white
cloud
arose
.
Then
came
the
distant
report
of
*NL*
a
shot
,
and
our
troops
could
be
seen
hurrying
to
the
crossing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
rose
,
puffing
,
and
went
up
to
the
general
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
your
excellency
like
a
little
refreshment
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bad
business
,
''
said
the
general
without
answering
him
,
``
our
men
*NL*
have
been
wasting
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
I
better
ride
over
,
your
excellency
?
''
asked
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
do
,
''
answered
the
general
,
and
he
repeated
the
order
that
*NL*
had
already
once
been
given
in
detail
:
``
and
tell
the
hussars
that
they
*NL*
are
to
cross
last
and
to
fire
the
bridge
as
I
ordered
;
and
the
*NL*
inflammable
material
on
the
bridge
must
be
reinspected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
answered
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
the
Cossack
with
his
horse
,
told
him
to
put
away
the
knapsack
*NL*
and
flask
,
and
swung
his
heavy
person
easily
into
the
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
really
call
in
on
the
nuns
,
''
he
said
to
the
officers
who
watched
*NL*
him
smilingly
,
and
he
rode
off
by
the
winding
path
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
let
's
see
how
far
it
will
carry
,
Captain
.
Just
try
!
''
said
the
*NL*
general
,
turning
to
an
artillery
officer
.
``
Have
a
little
fun
to
pass
the
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crew
,
to
your
guns
!
''
commanded
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
the
men
came
running
gaily
from
their
campfires
and
began
*NL*
loading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
!
''
came
the
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
Number
one
jumped
briskly
aside
.
The
gun
rang
out
with
a
deafening
*NL*
metallic
roar
,
and
a
whistling
grenade
flew
above
the
heads
of
our
*NL*
troops
below
the
hill
and
fell
far
short
of
the
enemy
,
a
little
smoke
*NL*
showing
the
spot
where
it
burst
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
faces
of
officers
and
men
brightened
up
at
the
sound
.
Everyone
got
*NL*
up
and
began
watching
the
movements
of
our
troops
below
,
as
plainly
*NL*
visible
as
if
but
a
stone
's
throw
away
,
and
the
movements
of
the
*NL*
approaching
enemy
farther
off
.
At
the
same
instant
the
sun
came
fully
*NL*
out
from
behind
the
clouds
,
and
the
clear
sound
of
the
solitary
shot
and
*NL*
the
brilliance
of
the
bright
sunshine
merged
in
a
single
joyous
and
*NL*
spirited
impression
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
enemy
's
shots
had
already
flown
across
the
bridge
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
crush
.
Halfway
across
stood
Prince
Nesvitski
,
who
had
*NL*
alighted
from
his
horse
and
whose
big
body
was
jammed
against
the
*NL*
railings
.
He
looked
back
laughing
to
the
Cossack
who
stood
a
few
steps
*NL*
behind
him
holding
two
horses
by
their
bridles
.
Each
time
Prince
*NL*
Nesvitski
tried
to
move
on
,
soldiers
and
carts
pushed
him
back
again
and
*NL*
pressed
him
against
the
railings
,
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fine
fellow
you
are
,
friend
!
''
said
the
Cossack
to
a
convoy
*NL*
soldier
with
a
wagon
,
who
was
pressing
onto
the
infantrymen
who
were
*NL*
crowded
together
close
to
his
wheels
and
his
horses
.
``
What
a
fellow
!
You
*NL*
ca
n't
wait
a
moment
!
Do
n't
you
see
the
general
wants
to
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
convoyman
took
no
notice
of
the
word
``
general
''
and
shouted
at
*NL*
the
soldiers
who
were
blocking
his
way
.
``
Hi
there
,
boys
!
Keep
to
the
*NL*
left
!
Wait
a
bit
.
''
But
the
soldiers
,
crowded
together
shoulder
to
*NL*
shoulder
,
their
bayonets
interlocking
,
moved
over
the
bridge
in
a
dense
*NL*
mass
.
Looking
down
over
the
rails
Prince
Nesvitski
saw
the
rapid
,
noisy
*NL*
little
waves
of
the
Enns
,
which
rippling
and
eddying
round
the
piles
of
*NL*
the
bridge
chased
each
other
along
.
Looking
on
the
bridge
he
saw
equally
*NL*
uniform
living
waves
of
soldiers
,
shoulder
straps
,
covered
shakos
,
*NL*
knapsacks
,
bayonets
,
long
muskets
,
and
,
under
the
shakos
,
faces
with
*NL*
broad
cheekbones
,
sunken
cheeks
,
and
listless
tired
expressions
,
and
*NL*
feet
that
moved
through
the
sticky
mud
that
covered
the
planks
of
the
*NL*
bridge
.
Sometimes
through
the
monotonous
waves
of
men
,
like
a
fleck
of
*NL*
white
foam
on
the
waves
of
the
Enns
,
an
officer
,
in
a
cloak
and
with
a
*NL*
type
of
face
different
from
that
of
the
men
,
squeezed
his
way
along
;
*NL*
sometimes
like
a
chip
of
wood
whirling
in
the
river
,
an
hussar
on
foot
,
*NL*
an
orderly
,
or
a
townsman
was
carried
through
the
waves
of
infantry
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
like
a
log
floating
down
the
river
,
an
officers
'
or
company
's
*NL*
baggage
wagon
,
piled
high
,
leather
covered
,
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
,
*NL*
moved
across
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
if
a
dam
had
burst
,
''
said
the
Cossack
hopelessly
.
``
Are
there
*NL*
many
more
of
you
to
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
million
all
but
one
!
''
replied
a
waggish
soldier
in
a
torn
coat
,
with
*NL*
a
wink
,
and
passed
on
followed
by
another
,
an
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
''
-LRB-
he
meant
the
enemy
-RRB-
``
begins
popping
at
the
bridge
now
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
soldier
dismally
to
a
comrade
,
``
you
'll
forget
to
scratch
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
soldier
passed
on
,
and
after
him
came
another
sitting
on
a
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
devil
have
the
leg
bands
been
shoved
to
?
''
said
an
orderly
,
*NL*
running
behind
the
cart
and
fumbling
in
the
back
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
also
passed
on
with
the
wagon
.
Then
came
some
merry
soldiers
who
*NL*
had
evidently
been
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
old
fellow
,
he
gives
him
one
in
the
teeth
with
the
butt
end
*NL*
of
his
gun
...
''
a
soldier
whose
greatcoat
was
well
tucked
up
said
gaily
,
*NL*
with
a
wide
swing
of
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
ham
was
just
delicious
...
''
answered
another
with
a
loud
laugh
.
*NL*
And
they
,
too
,
passed
on
,
so
that
Nesvitski
did
not
learn
who
had
been
*NL*
struck
on
the
teeth
,
or
what
the
ham
had
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
How
they
scurry
.
He
just
sends
a
ball
and
they
think
they
'll
all
*NL*
be
killed
,
''
a
sergeant
was
saying
angrily
and
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
it
flies
past
me
,
Daddy
,
the
ball
I
mean
,
''
said
a
young
soldier
with
*NL*
an
enormous
mouth
,
hardly
refraining
from
laughing
,
``
I
felt
like
dying
*NL*
of
fright
.
I
did
,
`
pon
my
word
,
I
got
that
frightened
!
''
said
he
,
as
if
*NL*
bragging
of
having
been
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
one
also
passed
.
Then
followed
a
cart
unlike
any
that
had
gone
*NL*
before
.
It
was
a
German
cart
with
a
pair
of
horses
led
by
a
German
,
and
*NL*
seemed
loaded
with
a
whole
houseful
of
effects
.
A
fine
brindled
cow
with
*NL*
a
large
udder
was
attached
to
the
cart
behind
.
A
woman
with
an
unweaned
*NL*
baby
,
an
old
woman
,
and
a
healthy
German
girl
with
bright
red
cheeks
*NL*
were
sitting
on
some
feather
beds
.
Evidently
these
fugitives
were
*NL*
allowed
to
pass
by
special
permission
.
The
eyes
of
all
the
soldiers
*NL*
turned
toward
the
women
,
and
while
the
vehicle
was
passing
at
foot
pace
*NL*
all
the
soldiers
'
remarks
related
to
the
two
young
ones
.
Every
face
bore
*NL*
almost
the
same
smile
,
expressing
unseemly
thoughts
about
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
,
the
German
sausage
is
making
tracks
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sell
me
the
missis
,
''
said
another
soldier
,
addressing
the
German
,
who
,
*NL*
angry
and
frightened
,
strode
energetically
along
with
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
how
smart
she
's
made
herself
!
Oh
,
the
devils
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Fedotov
,
you
should
be
quartered
on
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
as
much
before
now
,
mate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
asked
an
infantry
officer
who
was
eating
an
*NL*
apple
,
also
half
smiling
as
he
looked
at
the
handsome
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
German
closed
his
eyes
,
signifying
that
he
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
if
you
like
,
''
said
the
officer
,
giving
the
girl
an
apple
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
smiled
and
took
it
.
Nesvitski
like
the
rest
of
the
men
on
the
*NL*
bridge
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
women
till
they
had
passed
.
When
*NL*
they
had
gone
by
,
the
same
stream
of
soldiers
followed
,
with
the
same
*NL*
kind
of
talk
,
and
at
last
all
stopped
.
As
often
happens
,
the
horses
of
a
*NL*
convoy
wagon
became
restive
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
crowd
had
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
are
they
stopping
?
There
's
no
proper
order
!
''
said
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
shoving
to
?
Devil
take
you
!
Ca
n't
you
wait
?
It
'll
be
*NL*
worse
if
he
fires
the
bridge
.
See
,
here
's
an
officer
jammed
in
too
''
--
*NL*
different
voices
were
saying
in
the
crowd
,
as
the
men
looked
at
one
*NL*
another
,
and
all
pressed
toward
the
exit
from
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
down
at
the
waters
of
the
Enns
under
the
bridge
,
Nesvitski
*NL*
suddenly
heard
a
sound
new
to
him
,
of
something
swiftly
approaching
...
*NL*
something
big
,
that
splashed
into
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
where
it
carries
to
!
''
a
soldier
near
by
said
sternly
,
looking
*NL*
round
at
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Encouraging
us
to
get
along
quicker
,
''
said
another
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
moved
on
again
.
Nesvitski
realized
that
it
was
a
cannon
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
Cossack
,
my
horse
!
''
he
said
.
``
Now
,
then
,
you
there
!
get
out
of
the
*NL*
way
!
Make
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
great
difficulty
he
managed
to
get
to
his
horse
,
and
shouting
*NL*
continually
he
moved
on
.
The
soldiers
squeezed
themselves
to
make
way
*NL*
for
him
,
but
again
pressed
on
him
so
that
they
jammed
his
leg
,
and
those
*NL*
nearest
him
were
not
to
blame
for
they
were
themselves
pressed
still
*NL*
harder
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nesvitski
,
Nesvitski
!
you
numskull
!
''
came
a
hoarse
voice
from
behind
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
looked
round
and
saw
,
some
fifteen
paces
away
but
separated
by
*NL*
the
living
mass
of
moving
infantry
,
Vaska
Denisov
,
red
and
shaggy
,
with
*NL*
his
cap
on
the
back
of
his
black
head
and
a
cloak
hanging
jauntily
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
these
devils
,
these
fiends
,
to
let
me
pass
!
''
shouted
Denisov
*NL*
evidently
in
a
fit
of
rage
,
his
coal-black
eyes
with
their
bloodshot
*NL*
whites
glittering
and
rolling
as
he
waved
his
sheathed
saber
in
a
small
*NL*
bare
hand
as
red
as
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Vaska
!
''
joyfully
replied
Nesvitski
.
``
What
's
up
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
squadwon
ca
n't
pass
,
''
shouted
Vaska
Denisov
,
showing
his
white
*NL*
teeth
fiercely
and
spurring
his
black
thoroughbred
Arab
,
which
twitched
*NL*
its
ears
as
the
bayonets
touched
it
,
and
snorted
,
spurting
white
foam
*NL*
from
his
bit
,
tramping
the
planks
of
the
bridge
with
his
hoofs
,
and
*NL*
apparently
ready
to
jump
over
the
railings
had
his
rider
let
him
.
``
What
*NL*
is
this
?
They
're
like
sheep
!
Just
like
sheep
!
Out
of
the
way
!
...
Let
us
*NL*
pass
!
...
Stop
there
,
you
devil
with
the
cart
!
I
'll
hack
you
with
my
*NL*
saber
!
''
he
shouted
,
actually
drawing
his
saber
from
its
scabbard
and
*NL*
flourishing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
crowded
against
one
another
with
terrified
faces
,
and
*NL*
Denisov
joined
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
it
you
're
not
drunk
today
?
''
said
Nesvitski
when
the
other
had
*NL*
ridden
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
even
give
one
time
to
dwink
!
''
answered
Vaska
Denisov
.
``
They
*NL*
keep
dwagging
the
wegiment
to
and
fwo
all
day
.
If
they
mean
to
fight
,
*NL*
let
's
fight
.
But
the
devil
knows
what
this
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dandy
you
are
today
!
''
said
Nesvitski
,
looking
at
Denisov
's
new
*NL*
cloak
and
saddlecloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
smiled
,
took
out
of
his
sabretache
a
handkerchief
that
diffused
*NL*
a
smell
of
perfume
,
and
put
it
to
Nesvitski
's
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
I
'm
going
into
action
!
I
've
shaved
,
bwushed
my
teeth
,
and
*NL*
scented
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
imposing
figure
of
Nesvitski
followed
by
his
Cossack
,
and
the
*NL*
determination
of
Denisov
who
flourished
his
sword
and
shouted
*NL*
frantically
,
had
such
an
effect
that
they
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
*NL*
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
and
stopped
the
infantry
.
Beside
the
*NL*
bridge
Nesvitski
found
the
colonel
to
whom
he
had
to
deliver
the
order
,
*NL*
and
having
done
this
he
rode
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
cleared
the
way
Denisov
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
.
*NL*
Carelessly
holding
in
his
stallion
that
was
neighing
and
pawing
the
*NL*
ground
,
eager
to
rejoin
its
fellows
,
he
watched
his
squadron
draw
*NL*
nearer
.
Then
the
clang
of
hoofs
,
as
of
several
horses
galloping
,
*NL*
resounded
on
the
planks
of
the
bridge
,
and
the
squadron
,
officers
in
*NL*
front
and
men
four
abreast
,
spread
across
the
bridge
and
began
to
emerge
*NL*
on
his
side
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
infantry
who
had
been
stopped
crowded
near
the
bridge
in
the
*NL*
trampled
mud
and
gazed
with
that
particular
feeling
of
ill-will
,
*NL*
estrangement
,
and
ridicule
with
which
troops
of
different
arms
usually
*NL*
encounter
one
another
at
the
clean
,
smart
hussars
who
moved
past
them
in
*NL*
regular
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smart
lads
!
Only
fit
for
a
fair
!
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
are
they
?
They
're
led
about
just
for
show
!
''
remarked
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
kick
up
the
dust
,
you
infantry
!
''
jested
an
hussar
whose
prancing
*NL*
horse
had
splashed
mud
over
some
foot
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
put
you
on
a
two
days
'
march
with
a
knapsack
!
Your
fine
*NL*
cords
would
soon
get
a
bit
rubbed
,
''
said
an
infantryman
,
wiping
the
mud
*NL*
off
his
face
with
his
sleeve
.
``
Perched
up
there
,
you
're
more
like
a
bird
*NL*
than
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
Zikin
,
they
ought
to
put
you
on
a
horse
.
You
'd
look
fine
,
''
*NL*
said
a
corporal
,
chaffing
a
thin
little
soldier
who
bent
under
the
*NL*
weight
of
his
knapsack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
stick
between
your
legs
,
that
'll
suit
you
for
a
horse
!
''
the
*NL*
hussar
shouted
back
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
of
the
infantry
hurriedly
crossed
the
bridge
,
squeezing
*NL*
together
as
they
approached
it
as
if
passing
through
a
funnel
.
At
last
*NL*
the
baggage
wagons
had
all
crossed
,
the
crush
was
less
,
and
the
last
*NL*
battalion
came
onto
the
bridge
.
Only
Denisov
's
squadron
of
hussars
*NL*
remained
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
facing
the
enemy
,
who
could
*NL*
be
seen
from
the
hill
on
the
opposite
bank
but
was
not
yet
visible
from
*NL*
the
bridge
,
for
the
horizon
as
seen
from
the
valley
through
which
the
*NL*
river
flowed
was
formed
by
the
rising
ground
only
half
a
mile
away
.
At
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
hill
lay
wasteland
over
which
a
few
groups
of
our
*NL*
Cossack
scouts
were
moving
.
Suddenly
on
the
road
at
the
top
of
the
high
*NL*
ground
,
artillery
and
troops
in
blue
uniform
were
seen
.
These
were
the
*NL*
French
.
A
group
of
Cossack
scouts
retired
down
the
hill
at
a
trot
.
All
*NL*
the
officers
and
men
of
Denisov
's
squadron
,
though
they
tried
to
talk
of
*NL*
other
things
and
to
look
in
other
directions
,
thought
only
of
what
was
*NL*
there
on
the
hilltop
,
and
kept
constantly
looking
at
the
patches
*NL*
appearing
on
the
skyline
,
which
they
knew
to
be
the
enemy
's
troops
.
The
*NL*
weather
had
cleared
again
since
noon
and
the
sun
was
descending
brightly
*NL*
upon
the
Danube
and
the
dark
hills
around
it
.
It
was
calm
,
and
at
*NL*
intervals
the
bugle
calls
and
the
shouts
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
*NL*
from
the
hill
.
There
was
no
one
now
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
*NL*
except
a
few
scattered
skirmishers
.
An
empty
space
of
some
seven
hundred
*NL*
yards
was
all
that
separated
them
.
The
enemy
ceased
firing
,
and
that
*NL*
stern
,
threatening
,
inaccessible
,
and
intangible
line
which
separates
*NL*
two
hostile
armies
was
all
the
more
clearly
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
step
beyond
that
boundary
line
which
resembles
the
line
dividing
*NL*
the
living
from
the
dead
lies
uncertainty
,
suffering
,
and
death
.
And
*NL*
what
is
there
?
Who
is
there
?
--
there
beyond
that
field
,
that
tree
,
that
*NL*
roof
lit
up
by
the
sun
?
No
one
knows
,
but
one
wants
to
know
.
You
fear
*NL*
and
yet
long
to
cross
that
line
,
and
know
that
sooner
or
later
it
must
*NL*
be
crossed
and
you
will
have
to
find
out
what
is
there
,
just
as
you
will
*NL*
inevitably
have
to
learn
what
lies
the
other
side
of
death
.
But
you
are
*NL*
strong
,
healthy
,
cheerful
,
and
excited
,
and
are
surrounded
by
other
such
*NL*
excitedly
animated
and
healthy
men
.
''
So
thinks
,
or
at
any
rate
feels
,
*NL*
anyone
who
comes
in
sight
of
the
enemy
,
and
that
feeling
gives
a
*NL*
particular
glamour
and
glad
keenness
of
impression
to
everything
that
*NL*
takes
place
at
such
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
high
ground
where
the
enemy
was
,
the
smoke
of
a
cannon
rose
,
and
*NL*
a
ball
flew
whistling
over
the
heads
of
the
hussar
squadron
.
The
*NL*
officers
who
had
been
standing
together
rode
off
to
their
places
.
The
*NL*
hussars
began
carefully
aligning
their
horses
.
Silence
fell
on
the
whole
*NL*
squadron
.
All
were
looking
at
the
enemy
in
front
and
at
the
squadron
*NL*
commander
,
awaiting
the
word
of
command
.
A
second
and
a
third
cannon
*NL*
ball
flew
past
.
Evidently
they
were
firing
at
the
hussars
,
but
the
balls
*NL*
with
rapid
rhythmic
whistle
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
horsemen
and
fell
*NL*
somewhere
beyond
them
.
The
hussars
did
not
look
round
,
but
at
the
sound
*NL*
of
each
shot
,
as
at
the
word
of
command
,
the
whole
squadron
with
its
*NL*
rows
of
faces
so
alike
yet
so
different
,
holding
its
breath
while
the
*NL*
ball
flew
past
,
rose
in
the
stirrups
and
sank
back
again
.
The
soldiers
*NL*
without
turning
their
heads
glanced
at
one
another
,
curious
to
see
their
*NL*
comrades
'
impression
.
Every
face
,
from
Denisov
's
to
that
of
the
bugler
,
*NL*
showed
one
common
expression
of
conflict
,
irritation
,
and
excitement
,
*NL*
around
chin
and
mouth
.
The
quartermaster
frowned
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
soldiers
as
if
threatening
to
punish
them
.
Cadet
Mironov
ducked
every
*NL*
time
a
ball
flew
past
.
Rostov
on
the
left
flank
,
mounted
on
his
Rook
--
a
*NL*
handsome
horse
despite
its
game
leg
--
had
the
happy
air
of
a
schoolboy
*NL*
called
up
before
a
large
audience
for
an
examination
in
which
he
feels
*NL*
sure
he
will
distinguish
himself
.
He
was
glancing
at
everyone
with
a
*NL*
clear
,
bright
expression
,
as
if
asking
them
to
notice
how
calmly
he
sat
*NL*
under
fire
.
But
despite
himself
,
on
his
face
too
that
same
indication
of
*NL*
something
new
and
stern
showed
round
the
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
curtseying
there
?
Cadet
Miwonov
!
That
's
not
wight
!
Look
at
*NL*
me
,
''
cried
Denisov
who
,
unable
to
keep
still
on
one
spot
,
kept
turning
*NL*
his
horse
in
front
of
the
squadron
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
,
hairy
,
snub-nosed
face
of
Vaska
Denisov
,
and
his
whole
short
*NL*
sturdy
figure
with
the
sinewy
hairy
hand
and
stumpy
fingers
in
which
he
*NL*
held
the
hilt
of
his
naked
saber
,
looked
just
as
it
usually
did
,
*NL*
especially
toward
evening
when
he
had
emptied
his
second
bottle
;
he
was
*NL*
only
redder
than
usual
.
With
his
shaggy
head
thrown
back
like
birds
when
*NL*
they
drink
,
pressing
his
spurs
mercilessly
into
the
sides
of
his
good
*NL*
horse
,
Bedouin
,
and
sitting
as
though
falling
backwards
in
the
saddle
,
*NL*
he
galloped
to
the
other
flank
of
the
squadron
and
shouted
in
a
hoarse
*NL*
voice
to
the
men
to
look
to
their
pistols
.
He
rode
up
to
Kirsten
.
The
*NL*
staff
captain
on
his
broad-backed
,
steady
mare
came
at
a
walk
to
meet
*NL*
him
.
His
face
with
its
long
mustache
was
serious
as
always
,
only
his
*NL*
eyes
were
brighter
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
about
it
?
''
said
he
to
Denisov
.
``
It
wo
n't
come
to
a
fight
.
*NL*
You
'll
see
--
we
shall
retire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
only
knows
what
they
're
about
!
''
muttered
Denisov
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
Wostov
,
''
he
cried
noticing
the
cadet
's
bright
face
,
``
you
've
got
it
at
*NL*
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
smiled
approvingly
,
evidently
pleased
with
the
cadet
.
Rostov
felt
*NL*
perfectly
happy
.
Just
then
the
commander
appeared
on
the
bridge
.
Denisov
*NL*
galloped
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
!
Let
us
attack
them
!
I
'll
dwive
them
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Attack
indeed
!
''
said
the
colonel
in
a
bored
voice
,
puckering
up
his
*NL*
face
as
if
driving
off
a
troublesome
fly
.
``
And
why
are
you
stopping
*NL*
here
?
Do
n't
you
see
the
skirmishers
are
retreating
?
Lead
the
squadron
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squadron
crossed
the
bridge
and
drew
out
of
range
of
fire
without
*NL*
having
lost
a
single
man
.
The
second
squadron
that
had
been
in
the
front
*NL*
line
followed
them
across
and
the
last
Cossacks
quitted
the
farther
side
*NL*
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Pavlograd
squadrons
,
having
crossed
the
bridge
,
retired
up
the
*NL*
hill
one
after
the
other
.
Their
colonel
,
Karl
Bogdanich
Schubert
,
came
*NL*
up
to
Denisov
's
squadron
and
rode
at
a
footpace
not
far
from
Rostov
,
*NL*
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
although
they
were
now
meeting
for
the
*NL*
first
time
since
their
encounter
concerning
Telyanin
.
Rostov
,
feeling
*NL*
that
he
was
at
the
front
and
in
the
power
of
a
man
toward
whom
he
now
*NL*
admitted
that
he
had
been
to
blame
,
did
not
lift
his
eyes
from
the
*NL*
colonel
's
athletic
back
,
his
nape
covered
with
light
hair
,
and
his
red
*NL*
neck
.
It
seemed
to
Rostov
that
Bogdanich
was
only
pretending
not
to
*NL*
notice
him
,
and
that
his
whole
aim
now
was
to
test
the
cadet
's
courage
,
*NL*
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
around
him
merrily
;
then
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
that
Bogdanich
rode
so
near
in
order
to
show
him
his
courage
.
Next
*NL*
he
thought
that
his
enemy
would
send
the
squadron
on
a
desperate
attack
*NL*
just
to
punish
him
--
Rostov
.
Then
he
imagined
how
,
after
the
attack
,
*NL*
Bogdanich
would
come
up
to
him
as
he
lay
wounded
and
would
magnanimously
*NL*
extend
the
hand
of
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
high-shouldered
figure
of
Zherkov
,
familiar
to
the
Pavlograds
as
he
*NL*
had
but
recently
left
their
regiment
,
rode
up
to
the
colonel
.
After
his
*NL*
dismissal
from
headquarters
Zherkov
had
not
remained
in
the
regiment
,
*NL*
saying
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
slave
at
the
front
when
he
could
get
*NL*
more
rewards
by
doing
nothing
on
the
staff
,
and
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
attaching
himself
as
an
orderly
officer
to
Prince
Bagration
.
He
now
came
*NL*
to
his
former
chief
with
an
order
from
the
commander
of
the
rear
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Rostov
's
enemy
with
an
air
of
gloomy
*NL*
gravity
and
glancing
round
at
his
comrades
,
``
there
is
an
order
to
stop
*NL*
and
fire
the
bridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
order
to
who
?
''
asked
the
colonel
morosely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
myself
know
`
to
who
,
'
''
replied
the
cornet
in
a
serious
tone
,
*NL*
``
but
the
prince
told
me
to
`
go
and
tell
the
colonel
that
the
hussars
*NL*
must
return
quickly
and
fire
the
bridge
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Zherkov
was
followed
by
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
rode
up
to
the
*NL*
colonel
of
hussars
with
the
same
order
.
After
him
the
stout
Nesvitski
*NL*
came
galloping
up
on
a
Cossack
horse
that
could
scarcely
carry
his
*NL*
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
this
,
Colonel
?
''
he
shouted
as
he
approached
.
``
I
told
you
to
fire
*NL*
the
bridge
,
and
now
someone
has
gone
and
blundered
;
they
are
all
beside
*NL*
themselves
over
there
and
one
ca
n't
make
anything
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
deliberately
stopped
the
regiment
and
turned
to
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoke
to
me
of
inflammable
material
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
you
said
*NL*
nothing
about
firing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
Nesvitski
as
he
drew
up
,
taking
off
his
cap
and
*NL*
smoothing
his
hair
wet
with
perspiration
with
his
plump
hand
,
``
was
n't
I
*NL*
telling
you
to
fire
the
bridge
,
when
inflammable
material
had
been
put
*NL*
in
position
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
your
`
dear
sir
,
'
Mr.
Staff
Officer
,
and
you
did
not
tell
me
to
*NL*
burn
the
bridge
!
I
know
the
service
,
and
it
is
my
habit
orders
strictly
*NL*
to
obey
.
You
said
the
bridge
would
be
burned
,
but
who
would
it
burn
,
I
*NL*
could
not
know
by
the
holy
spirit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
always
the
way
!
''
said
Nesvitski
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
here
?
''
said
he
,
turning
to
Zherkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
same
business
.
But
you
are
damp
!
Let
me
wring
you
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
saying
,
Mr.
Staff
Officer
...
''
continued
the
colonel
in
an
*NL*
offended
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
,
''
interrupted
the
officer
of
the
suite
,
``
You
must
be
quick
or
*NL*
the
enemy
will
bring
up
his
guns
to
use
grapeshot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
looked
silently
at
the
officer
of
the
suite
,
at
the
stout
*NL*
staff
officer
,
and
at
Zherkov
,
and
he
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
the
bridge
fire
,
''
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
as
if
to
announce
*NL*
that
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasantness
he
had
to
endure
he
would
still
*NL*
do
the
right
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Striking
his
horse
with
his
long
muscular
legs
as
if
it
were
to
blame
*NL*
for
everything
,
the
colonel
moved
forward
and
ordered
the
second
*NL*
squadron
,
that
in
which
Rostov
was
serving
under
Denisov
,
to
return
to
*NL*
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
it
's
just
as
I
thought
,
''
said
Rostov
to
himself
.
``
He
wishes
to
*NL*
test
me
!
''
His
heart
contracted
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
.
``
Let
*NL*
him
see
whether
I
am
a
coward
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
on
all
the
bright
faces
of
the
squadron
the
serious
expression
*NL*
appeared
that
they
had
worn
when
under
fire
.
Rostov
watched
his
enemy
,
*NL*
the
colonel
,
closely
--
to
find
in
his
face
confirmation
of
his
own
*NL*
conjecture
,
but
the
colonel
did
not
once
glance
at
Rostov
,
and
looked
as
*NL*
he
always
did
when
at
the
front
,
solemn
and
stern
.
Then
came
the
word
of
*NL*
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
sharp
!
Look
sharp
!
''
several
voices
repeated
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
sabers
catching
in
the
bridles
and
their
spurs
jingling
,
the
*NL*
hussars
hastily
dismounted
,
not
knowing
what
they
were
to
do
.
The
men
*NL*
were
crossing
themselves
.
Rostov
no
longer
looked
at
the
colonel
,
he
had
*NL*
no
time
.
He
was
afraid
of
falling
behind
the
hussars
,
so
much
afraid
*NL*
that
his
heart
stood
still
.
His
hand
trembled
as
he
gave
his
horse
into
*NL*
an
orderly
's
charge
,
and
he
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
with
a
*NL*
thud
.
Denisov
rode
past
him
,
leaning
back
and
shouting
something
.
Rostov
*NL*
saw
nothing
but
the
hussars
running
all
around
him
,
their
spurs
catching
*NL*
and
their
sabers
clattering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stretchers
!
''
shouted
someone
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
did
not
think
what
this
call
for
stretchers
meant
;
he
ran
on
,
*NL*
trying
only
to
be
ahead
of
the
others
;
but
just
at
the
bridge
,
not
*NL*
looking
at
the
ground
,
he
came
on
some
sticky
,
trodden
mud
,
stumbled
,
*NL*
and
fell
on
his
hands
.
The
others
outstripped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
boss
zides
,
Captain
,
''
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
colonel
,
who
,
having
*NL*
ridden
ahead
,
had
pulled
up
his
horse
near
the
bridge
,
with
a
*NL*
triumphant
,
cheerful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
wiping
his
muddy
hands
on
his
breeches
looked
at
his
enemy
and
*NL*
was
about
to
run
on
,
thinking
that
the
farther
he
went
to
the
front
the
*NL*
better
.
But
Bogdanich
,
without
looking
at
or
recognizing
Rostov
,
shouted
*NL*
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
running
on
the
middle
of
the
bridge
?
To
the
right
!
Come
*NL*
back
,
Cadet
!
''
he
cried
angrily
;
and
turning
to
Denisov
,
who
,
showing
off
*NL*
his
courage
,
had
ridden
on
to
the
planks
of
the
bridge
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
run
risks
,
Captain
?
You
should
dismount
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
every
bullet
has
its
billet
,
''
answered
Vaska
Denisov
,
turning
in
*NL*
his
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Nesvitski
,
Zherkov
,
and
the
officer
of
the
suite
were
standing
*NL*
together
out
of
range
of
the
shots
,
watching
,
now
the
small
group
of
men
*NL*
with
yellow
shakos
,
dark-green
jackets
braided
with
cord
,
and
blue
*NL*
riding
breeches
,
who
were
swarming
near
the
bridge
,
and
then
at
what
was
*NL*
approaching
in
the
distance
from
the
opposite
side
--
the
blue
uniforms
*NL*
and
groups
with
horses
,
easily
recognizable
as
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
they
burn
the
bridge
or
not
?
Who
'll
get
there
first
?
Will
they
get
*NL*
there
and
fire
the
bridge
or
will
the
French
get
within
grapeshot
range
*NL*
and
wipe
them
out
?
''
These
were
the
questions
each
man
of
the
troops
on
*NL*
the
high
ground
above
the
bridge
involuntarily
asked
himself
with
a
*NL*
sinking
heart
--
watching
the
bridge
and
the
hussars
in
the
bright
evening
*NL*
light
and
the
blue
tunics
advancing
from
the
other
side
with
their
*NL*
bayonets
and
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
.
The
hussars
will
get
it
hot
!
''
said
Nesvitski
;
``
they
are
within
*NL*
grapeshot
range
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
n't
have
taken
so
many
men
,
''
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
enough
,
''
answered
Nesvitski
;
``
two
smart
fellows
could
have
done
*NL*
the
job
just
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
your
excellency
,
''
put
in
Zherkov
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hussars
,
*NL*
but
still
with
that
naive
air
that
made
it
impossible
to
know
whether
he
*NL*
was
speaking
in
jest
or
in
earnest
.
``
Ah
,
your
excellency
!
How
you
look
*NL*
at
things
!
Send
two
men
?
And
who
then
would
give
us
the
Vladimir
medal
*NL*
and
ribbon
?
But
now
,
even
if
they
do
get
peppered
,
the
squadron
may
be
*NL*
recommended
for
honors
and
he
may
get
a
ribbon
.
Our
Bogdanich
knows
how
*NL*
things
are
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
said
the
officer
of
the
suite
,
``
that
's
grapeshot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
the
French
guns
,
the
limbers
of
which
were
being
detached
*NL*
and
hurriedly
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
French
side
,
amid
the
groups
with
cannon
,
a
cloud
of
smoke
*NL*
appeared
,
then
a
second
and
a
third
almost
simultaneously
,
and
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
first
report
was
heard
a
fourth
was
seen
.
Then
two
*NL*
reports
one
after
another
,
and
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
groaned
Nesvitski
as
if
in
fierce
pain
,
seizing
the
officer
of
*NL*
the
suite
by
the
arm
.
``
Look
!
A
man
has
fallen
!
Fallen
,
fallen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
Tsar
I
would
never
go
to
war
,
''
said
Nesvitski
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
guns
were
hastily
reloaded
.
The
infantry
in
their
blue
*NL*
uniforms
advanced
toward
the
bridge
at
a
run
.
Smoke
appeared
again
but
*NL*
at
irregular
intervals
,
and
grapeshot
cracked
and
rattled
onto
the
*NL*
bridge
.
But
this
time
Nesvitski
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
,
*NL*
as
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
arose
from
it
.
The
hussars
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
setting
it
on
fire
and
the
French
batteries
were
now
firing
at
them
,
no
*NL*
longer
to
hinder
them
but
because
the
guns
were
trained
and
there
was
*NL*
someone
to
fire
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
had
time
to
fire
three
rounds
of
grapeshot
before
the
hussars
*NL*
got
back
to
their
horses
.
Two
were
misdirected
and
the
shot
went
too
*NL*
high
,
but
the
last
round
fell
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
hussars
and
*NL*
knocked
three
of
them
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
absorbed
by
his
relations
with
Bogdanich
,
had
paused
on
the
*NL*
bridge
not
knowing
what
to
do
.
There
was
no
one
to
hew
down
-LRB-
as
he
had
*NL*
always
imagined
battles
to
himself
-RRB-
,
nor
could
he
help
to
fire
the
*NL*
bridge
because
he
had
not
brought
any
burning
straw
with
him
like
the
*NL*
other
soldiers
.
He
stood
looking
about
him
,
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
*NL*
rattle
on
the
bridge
as
if
nuts
were
being
spilt
,
and
the
hussar
nearest
*NL*
to
him
fell
against
the
rails
with
a
groan
.
Rostov
ran
up
to
him
with
*NL*
the
others
.
Again
someone
shouted
,
``
Stretchers
!
''
Four
men
seized
the
*NL*
hussar
and
began
lifting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oooh
!
For
Christ
's
sake
let
me
alone
!
''
cried
the
wounded
man
,
but
still
*NL*
he
was
lifted
and
laid
on
the
stretcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
turned
away
and
,
as
if
searching
for
something
,
gazed
*NL*
into
the
distance
,
at
the
waters
of
the
Danube
,
at
the
sky
,
and
at
the
*NL*
sun
.
How
beautiful
the
sky
looked
;
how
blue
,
how
calm
,
and
how
deep
!
How
*NL*
bright
and
glorious
was
the
setting
sun
!
With
what
soft
glitter
the
*NL*
waters
of
the
distant
Danube
shone
.
And
fairer
still
were
the
faraway
*NL*
blue
mountains
beyond
the
river
,
the
nunnery
,
the
mysterious
gorges
,
and
*NL*
the
pine
forests
veiled
in
the
mist
of
their
summits
...
There
was
peace
*NL*
and
happiness
...
``
I
should
wish
for
nothing
else
,
nothing
,
if
only
I
*NL*
were
there
,
''
thought
Rostov
.
``
In
myself
alone
and
in
that
sunshine
there
*NL*
is
so
much
happiness
;
but
here
...
groans
,
suffering
,
fear
,
and
this
*NL*
uncertainty
and
hurry
...
There
--
they
are
shouting
again
,
and
again
are
*NL*
all
running
back
somewhere
,
and
I
shall
run
with
them
,
and
it
,
death
,
is
*NL*
here
above
me
and
around
...
Another
instant
and
I
shall
never
again
see
*NL*
the
sun
,
this
water
,
that
gorge
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
the
sun
began
to
hide
behind
the
clouds
,
and
other
*NL*
stretchers
came
into
view
before
Rostov
.
And
the
fear
of
death
and
of
*NL*
the
stretchers
,
and
love
of
the
sun
and
of
life
,
all
merged
into
one
*NL*
feeling
of
sickening
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
God
!
Thou
who
art
in
that
heaven
,
save
,
forgive
,
and
protect
*NL*
me
!
''
Rostov
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussars
ran
back
to
the
men
who
held
their
horses
;
their
voices
*NL*
sounded
louder
and
calmer
,
the
stretchers
disappeared
from
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
fwiend
?
So
you
've
smelt
powdah
!
''
shouted
Vaska
Denisov
just
above
*NL*
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
over
;
but
I
am
a
coward
--
yes
,
a
coward
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
and
*NL*
sighing
deeply
he
took
Rook
,
his
horse
,
which
stood
resting
one
foot
,
*NL*
from
the
orderly
and
began
to
mount
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
grapeshot
?
''
he
asked
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
and
no
mistake
!
''
cried
Denisov
.
``
You
worked
like
wegular
bwicks
and
*NL*
it
's
nasty
work
!
An
attack
's
pleasant
work
!
Hacking
away
at
the
dogs
!
*NL*
But
this
sort
of
thing
is
the
very
devil
,
with
them
shooting
at
you
like
*NL*
a
target
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Denisov
rode
up
to
a
group
that
had
stopped
near
Rostov
,
composed
of
*NL*
the
colonel
,
Nesvitski
,
Zherkov
,
and
the
officer
from
the
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
seems
that
no
one
has
noticed
,
''
thought
Rostov
.
And
this
was
*NL*
true
.
No
one
had
taken
any
notice
,
for
everyone
knew
the
sensation
which
*NL*
the
cadet
under
fire
for
the
first
time
had
experienced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
something
for
you
to
report
,
''
said
Zherkov
.
``
See
if
I
do
n't
get
*NL*
promoted
to
a
sublieutenancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inform
the
prince
that
I
the
bridge
fired
!
''
said
the
colonel
*NL*
triumphantly
and
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
asks
about
the
losses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
trifle
,
''
said
the
colonel
in
his
bass
voice
:
``
two
hussars
wounded
,
*NL*
and
one
knocked
out
,
''
he
added
,
unable
to
restrain
a
happy
smile
,
and
*NL*
pronouncing
the
phrase
``
knocked
out
''
with
ringing
distinctness
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Pursued
by
the
French
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
under
the
command
*NL*
of
Bonaparte
,
encountering
a
population
that
was
unfriendly
to
it
,
*NL*
losing
confidence
in
its
allies
,
suffering
from
shortness
of
supplies
,
*NL*
and
compelled
to
act
under
conditions
of
war
unlike
anything
that
had
*NL*
been
foreseen
,
the
Russian
army
of
thirty-five
thousand
men
commanded
by
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
hurriedly
retreating
along
the
Danube
,
stopping
where
*NL*
overtaken
by
the
enemy
and
fighting
rearguard
actions
only
as
far
as
*NL*
necessary
to
enable
it
to
retreat
without
losing
its
heavy
equipment
.
*NL*
There
had
been
actions
at
Lambach
,
Amstetten
,
and
Melk
;
but
despite
the
*NL*
courage
and
endurance
--
acknowledged
even
by
the
enemy
--
with
which
the
*NL*
Russians
fought
,
the
only
consequence
of
these
actions
was
a
yet
more
*NL*
rapid
retreat
.
Austrian
troops
that
had
escaped
capture
at
Ulm
and
had
*NL*
joined
Kutuzov
at
Braunau
now
separated
from
the
Russian
army
,
and
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
left
with
only
his
own
weak
and
exhausted
forces
.
The
*NL*
defense
of
Vienna
was
no
longer
to
be
thought
of
.
Instead
of
an
*NL*
offensive
,
the
plan
of
which
,
carefully
prepared
in
accord
with
the
*NL*
modern
science
of
strategics
,
had
been
handed
to
Kutuzov
when
he
was
in
*NL*
Vienna
by
the
Austrian
Hofkriegsrath
,
the
sole
and
almost
unattainable
*NL*
aim
remaining
for
him
was
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
forces
that
were
*NL*
advancing
from
Russia
,
without
losing
his
army
as
Mack
had
done
at
Ulm
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-eighth
of
October
Kutuzov
with
his
army
crossed
to
the
*NL*
left
bank
of
the
Danube
and
took
up
a
position
for
the
first
time
with
*NL*
the
river
between
himself
and
the
main
body
of
the
French
.
On
the
*NL*
thirtieth
he
attacked
Mortier
's
division
,
which
was
on
the
left
bank
,
*NL*
and
broke
it
up
.
In
this
action
for
the
first
time
trophies
were
taken
:
*NL*
banners
,
cannon
,
and
two
enemy
generals
.
For
the
first
time
,
after
a
*NL*
fortnight
's
retreat
,
the
Russian
troops
had
halted
and
after
a
fight
had
*NL*
not
only
held
the
field
but
had
repulsed
the
French
.
Though
the
troops
*NL*
were
ill-clad
,
exhausted
,
and
had
lost
a
third
of
their
number
in
*NL*
killed
,
wounded
,
sick
,
and
stragglers
;
though
a
number
of
sick
and
*NL*
wounded
had
been
abandoned
on
the
other
side
of
the
Danube
with
a
letter
*NL*
in
which
Kutuzov
entrusted
them
to
the
humanity
of
the
enemy
;
and
though
*NL*
the
big
hospitals
and
the
houses
in
Krems
converted
into
military
*NL*
hospitals
could
no
longer
accommodate
all
the
sick
and
wounded
,
yet
the
*NL*
stand
made
at
Krems
and
the
victory
over
Mortier
raised
the
spirits
of
*NL*
the
army
considerably
.
Throughout
the
whole
army
and
at
headquarters
*NL*
most
joyful
though
erroneous
rumors
were
rife
of
the
imaginary
approach
*NL*
of
columns
from
Russia
,
of
some
victory
gained
by
the
Austrians
,
and
of
*NL*
the
retreat
of
the
frightened
Bonaparte
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
during
the
battle
had
been
in
attendance
on
the
Austrian
*NL*
General
Schmidt
,
who
was
killed
in
the
action
.
His
horse
had
been
*NL*
wounded
under
him
and
his
own
arm
slightly
grazed
by
a
bullet
.
As
a
mark
*NL*
of
the
commander-in-chief
's
special
favor
he
was
sent
with
the
news
of
*NL*
this
victory
to
the
Austrian
court
,
now
no
longer
at
Vienna
-LRB-
which
was
*NL*
threatened
by
the
French
-RRB-
but
at
Brunn
.
Despite
his
apparently
delicate
*NL*
build
Prince
Andrew
could
endure
physical
fatigue
far
better
than
many
*NL*
very
muscular
men
,
and
on
the
night
of
the
battle
,
having
arrived
at
*NL*
Krems
excited
but
not
weary
,
with
dispatches
from
Dokhturov
to
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
he
was
sent
immediately
with
a
special
dispatch
to
Brunn
.
To
be
so
sent
*NL*
meant
not
only
a
reward
but
an
important
step
toward
promotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
dark
but
starry
,
the
road
showed
black
in
the
snow
that
*NL*
had
fallen
the
previous
day
--
the
day
of
the
battle
.
Reviewing
his
*NL*
impressions
of
the
recent
battle
,
picturing
pleasantly
to
himself
the
*NL*
impression
his
news
of
a
victory
would
create
,
or
recalling
the
send-off
*NL*
given
him
by
the
commander-in-chief
and
his
fellow
officers
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
was
galloping
along
in
a
post
chaise
enjoying
the
feelings
of
a
*NL*
man
who
has
at
length
begun
to
attain
a
long-desired
happiness
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
he
closed
his
eyes
his
ears
seemed
filled
with
the
rattle
of
the
*NL*
wheels
and
the
sensation
of
victory
.
Then
he
began
to
imagine
that
the
*NL*
Russians
were
running
away
and
that
he
himself
was
killed
,
but
he
*NL*
quickly
roused
himself
with
a
feeling
of
joy
,
as
if
learning
afresh
that
*NL*
this
was
not
so
but
that
on
the
contrary
the
French
had
run
away
.
He
*NL*
again
recalled
all
the
details
of
the
victory
and
his
own
calm
courage
*NL*
during
the
battle
,
and
feeling
reassured
he
dozed
off
...
The
dark
*NL*
starry
night
was
followed
by
a
bright
cheerful
morning
.
The
snow
was
*NL*
thawing
in
the
sunshine
,
the
horses
galloped
quickly
,
and
on
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
road
were
forests
of
different
kinds
,
fields
,
and
villages
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
of
the
post
stations
he
overtook
a
convoy
of
Russian
wounded
.
The
*NL*
Russian
officer
in
charge
of
the
transport
lolled
back
in
the
front
*NL*
cart
,
shouting
and
scolding
a
soldier
with
coarse
abuse
.
In
each
of
the
*NL*
long
German
carts
six
or
more
pale
,
dirty
,
bandaged
men
were
being
*NL*
jolted
over
the
stony
road
.
Some
of
them
were
talking
-LRB-
he
heard
Russian
*NL*
words
-RRB-
,
others
were
eating
bread
;
the
more
severely
wounded
looked
*NL*
silently
,
with
the
languid
interest
of
sick
children
,
at
the
envoy
*NL*
hurrying
past
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
told
his
driver
to
stop
,
and
asked
a
soldier
in
what
*NL*
action
they
had
been
wounded
.
``
Day
before
yesterday
,
on
the
Danube
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
soldier
.
Prince
Andrew
took
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
*NL*
soldier
three
gold
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
them
all
,
''
he
said
to
the
officer
who
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
well
soon
,
lads
!
''
he
continued
,
turning
to
the
soldiers
.
``
There
's
*NL*
plenty
to
do
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
,
sir
?
''
asked
the
officer
,
evidently
anxious
to
start
a
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
news
!
...
Go
on
!
''
he
shouted
to
the
driver
,
and
they
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
quite
dark
when
Prince
Andrew
rattled
over
the
paved
*NL*
streets
of
Brunn
and
found
himself
surrounded
by
high
buildings
,
the
*NL*
lights
of
shops
,
houses
,
and
street
lamps
,
fine
carriages
,
and
all
that
*NL*
atmosphere
of
a
large
and
active
town
which
is
always
so
attractive
to
a
*NL*
soldier
after
camp
life
.
Despite
his
rapid
journey
and
sleepless
night
,
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
when
he
drove
up
to
the
palace
felt
even
more
vigorous
and
*NL*
alert
than
he
had
done
the
day
before
.
Only
his
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
*NL*
and
his
thoughts
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
*NL*
rapidity
.
He
again
vividly
recalled
the
details
of
the
battle
,
no
longer
*NL*
dim
,
but
definite
and
in
the
concise
form
in
which
he
imagined
himself
*NL*
stating
them
to
the
Emperor
Francis
.
He
vividly
imagined
the
casual
*NL*
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
and
the
answers
he
would
give
.
He
*NL*
expected
to
be
at
once
presented
to
the
Emperor
.
At
the
chief
entrance
*NL*
to
the
palace
,
however
,
an
official
came
running
out
to
meet
him
,
and
*NL*
learning
that
he
was
a
special
messenger
led
him
to
another
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
right
from
the
corridor
,
Euer
Hochgeboren
!
There
you
will
find
*NL*
the
adjutant
on
duty
,
''
said
the
official
.
``
He
will
conduct
you
to
the
*NL*
Minister
of
War
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
on
duty
,
meeting
Prince
Andrew
,
asked
him
to
wait
,
and
went
*NL*
in
to
the
Minister
of
War
.
Five
minutes
later
he
returned
and
bowing
*NL*
with
particular
courtesy
ushered
Prince
Andrew
before
him
along
a
*NL*
corridor
to
the
cabinet
where
the
Minister
of
War
was
at
work
.
The
*NL*
adjutant
by
his
elaborate
courtesy
appeared
to
wish
to
ward
off
any
*NL*
attempt
at
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
Russian
messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
joyous
feeling
was
considerably
weakened
as
he
*NL*
approached
the
door
of
the
minister
's
room
.
He
felt
offended
,
and
*NL*
without
his
noticing
it
the
feeling
of
offense
immediately
turned
into
*NL*
one
of
disdain
which
was
quite
uncalled
for
.
His
fertile
mind
instantly
*NL*
suggested
to
him
a
point
of
view
which
gave
him
a
right
to
despise
the
*NL*
adjutant
and
the
minister
.
``
Away
from
the
smell
of
powder
,
they
probably
*NL*
think
it
easy
to
gain
victories
!
''
he
thought
.
His
eyes
narrowed
*NL*
disdainfully
,
he
entered
the
room
of
the
Minister
of
War
with
peculiarly
*NL*
deliberate
steps
.
This
feeling
of
disdain
was
heightened
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
minister
seated
at
a
large
table
reading
some
papers
and
making
pencil
*NL*
notes
on
them
,
and
for
the
first
two
or
three
minutes
taking
no
notice
*NL*
of
his
arrival
.
A
wax
candle
stood
at
each
side
of
the
minister
's
bent
*NL*
bald
head
with
its
gray
temples
.
He
went
on
reading
to
the
end
,
without
*NL*
raising
his
eyes
at
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
and
deliver
it
,
''
said
he
to
his
adjutant
,
handing
him
the
*NL*
papers
and
still
taking
no
notice
of
the
special
messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
either
the
actions
of
Kutuzov
's
army
interested
*NL*
the
Minister
of
War
less
than
any
of
the
other
matters
he
was
concerned
*NL*
with
,
or
he
wanted
to
give
the
Russian
special
messenger
that
*NL*
impression
.
``
But
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
The
minister
drew
the
remaining
papers
together
,
arranged
them
*NL*
evenly
,
and
then
raised
his
head
.
He
had
an
intellectual
and
distinctive
*NL*
head
,
but
the
instant
he
turned
to
Prince
Andrew
the
firm
,
intelligent
*NL*
expression
on
his
face
changed
in
a
way
evidently
deliberate
and
*NL*
habitual
to
him
.
His
face
took
on
the
stupid
artificial
smile
-LRB-
which
*NL*
does
not
even
attempt
to
hide
its
artificiality
-RRB-
of
a
man
who
is
*NL*
continually
receiving
many
petitioners
one
after
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
General
Field
Marshal
Kutuzov
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
hope
it
is
good
news
?
*NL*
There
has
been
an
encounter
with
Mortier
?
A
victory
?
It
was
high
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
dispatch
which
was
addressed
to
him
and
began
to
read
it
*NL*
with
a
mournful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
My
God
!
Schmidt
!
''
he
exclaimed
in
German
.
``
What
a
calamity
!
*NL*
What
a
calamity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
glanced
through
the
dispatch
he
laid
it
on
the
table
and
looked
*NL*
at
Prince
Andrew
,
evidently
considering
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
what
a
calamity
!
You
say
the
affair
was
decisive
?
But
Mortier
is
not
*NL*
captured
.
''
Again
he
pondered
.
``
I
am
very
glad
you
have
brought
good
*NL*
news
,
though
Schmidt
's
death
is
a
heavy
price
to
pay
for
the
victory
.
*NL*
His
Majesty
will
no
doubt
wish
to
see
you
,
but
not
today
.
I
thank
you
!
*NL*
You
must
have
a
rest
.
Be
at
the
levee
tomorrow
after
the
parade
.
*NL*
However
,
I
will
let
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stupid
smile
,
which
had
left
his
face
while
he
was
speaking
,
*NL*
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Au
revoir
!
Thank
you
very
much
.
His
Majesty
will
probably
desire
to
see
*NL*
you
,
''
he
added
,
bowing
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Prince
Andrew
left
the
palace
he
felt
that
all
the
interest
and
*NL*
happiness
the
victory
had
afforded
him
had
been
now
left
in
the
*NL*
indifferent
hands
of
the
Minister
of
War
and
the
polite
adjutant
.
The
*NL*
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
instantaneously
changed
;
the
battle
seemed
*NL*
the
memory
of
a
remote
event
long
past
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
stayed
at
Brunn
with
Bilibin
,
a
Russian
acquaintance
of
*NL*
his
in
the
diplomatic
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
prince
!
I
could
not
have
a
more
welcome
visitor
,
''
said
*NL*
Bilibin
as
he
came
out
to
meet
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Franz
,
put
the
prince
's
*NL*
things
in
my
bedroom
,
''
said
he
to
the
servant
who
was
ushering
Bolkonski
*NL*
in
.
``
So
you
're
a
messenger
of
victory
,
eh
?
Splendid
!
And
I
am
sitting
*NL*
here
ill
,
as
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
washing
and
dressing
,
Prince
Andrew
came
into
the
diplomat
's
*NL*
luxurious
study
and
sat
down
to
the
dinner
prepared
for
him
.
Bilibin
*NL*
settled
down
comfortably
beside
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
journey
and
the
campaign
during
which
he
had
been
deprived
of
*NL*
all
the
comforts
of
cleanliness
and
all
the
refinements
of
life
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
repose
among
luxurious
surroundings
such
*NL*
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
from
childhood
.
Besides
it
was
pleasant
,
*NL*
after
his
reception
by
the
Austrians
,
to
speak
if
not
in
Russian
-LRB-
for
*NL*
they
were
speaking
French
-RRB-
at
least
with
a
Russian
who
would
,
he
*NL*
supposed
,
share
the
general
Russian
antipathy
to
the
Austrians
which
was
*NL*
then
particularly
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
was
a
man
of
thirty-five
,
a
bachelor
,
and
of
the
same
circle
as
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
They
had
known
each
other
previously
in
Petersburg
,
but
*NL*
had
become
more
intimate
when
Prince
Andrew
was
in
Vienna
with
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
Just
as
Prince
Andrew
was
a
young
man
who
gave
promise
of
rising
high
in
*NL*
the
military
profession
,
so
to
an
even
greater
extent
Bilibin
gave
*NL*
promise
of
rising
in
his
diplomatic
career
.
He
still
a
young
man
but
no
*NL*
longer
a
young
diplomat
,
as
he
had
entered
the
service
at
the
age
of
*NL*
sixteen
,
had
been
in
Paris
and
Copenhagen
,
and
now
held
a
rather
*NL*
important
post
in
Vienna
.
Both
the
foreign
minister
and
our
ambassador
*NL*
in
Vienna
knew
him
and
valued
him
.
He
was
not
one
of
those
many
*NL*
diplomats
who
are
esteemed
because
they
have
certain
negative
qualities
,
*NL*
avoid
doing
certain
things
,
and
speak
French
.
He
was
one
of
those
,
who
,
*NL*
liking
work
,
knew
how
to
do
it
,
and
despite
his
indolence
would
*NL*
sometimes
spend
a
whole
night
at
his
writing
table
.
He
worked
well
*NL*
whatever
the
import
of
his
work
.
It
was
not
the
question
``
What
for
?
''
but
*NL*
the
question
``
How
?
''
that
interested
him
.
What
the
diplomatic
matter
*NL*
might
be
he
did
not
care
,
but
it
gave
him
great
pleasure
to
prepare
a
*NL*
circular
,
memorandum
,
or
report
,
skillfully
,
pointedly
,
and
elegantly
.
*NL*
Bilibin
's
services
were
valued
not
only
for
what
he
wrote
,
but
also
for
*NL*
his
skill
in
dealing
and
conversing
with
those
in
the
highest
spheres
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
liked
conversation
as
he
liked
work
,
only
when
it
could
be
made
*NL*
elegantly
witty
.
In
society
he
always
awaited
an
opportunity
to
say
*NL*
something
striking
and
took
part
in
a
conversation
only
when
that
was
*NL*
possible
.
His
conversation
was
always
sprinkled
with
wittily
original
,
*NL*
finished
phrases
of
general
interest
.
These
sayings
were
prepared
in
the
*NL*
inner
laboratory
of
his
mind
in
a
portable
form
as
if
intentionally
,
so
*NL*
that
insignificant
society
people
might
carry
them
from
drawing
room
to
*NL*
drawing
room
.
And
,
in
fact
,
Bilibin
's
witticisms
were
hawked
about
in
*NL*
the
Viennese
drawing
rooms
and
often
had
an
influence
on
matters
*NL*
considered
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
thin
,
worn
,
sallow
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
,
which
always
*NL*
looked
as
clean
and
well
washed
as
the
tips
of
one
's
fingers
after
a
*NL*
Russian
bath
.
The
movement
of
these
wrinkles
formed
the
principal
play
*NL*
of
expression
on
his
face
.
Now
his
forehead
would
pucker
into
deep
folds
*NL*
and
his
eyebrows
were
lifted
,
then
his
eyebrows
would
descend
and
deep
*NL*
wrinkles
would
crease
his
cheeks
.
His
small
,
deep-set
eyes
always
*NL*
twinkled
and
looked
out
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
tell
me
about
your
exploits
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
very
modestly
without
once
mentioning
himself
,
described
the
*NL*
engagement
and
his
reception
by
the
Minister
of
War
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
received
me
and
my
news
as
one
receives
a
dog
in
a
game
of
*NL*
skittles
,
''
said
he
in
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
smiled
and
the
wrinkles
on
his
face
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cependant
,
mon
cher
,
''
he
remarked
,
examining
his
nails
from
a
distance
*NL*
and
puckering
the
skin
above
his
left
eye
,
``
malgre
la
haute
estime
que
*NL*
je
professe
pour
the
Orthodox
Russian
army
,
j'
avoue
que
votre
victoire
*NL*
n'est
pas
des
plus
victorieuses
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
But
my
dear
fellow
,
with
all
my
respect
for
the
Orthodox
Russian
*NL*
army
,
I
must
say
that
your
victory
was
not
particularly
victorious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
talking
in
this
way
in
French
,
uttering
only
those
words
in
*NL*
Russian
on
which
he
wished
to
put
a
contemptuous
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
!
You
with
all
your
forces
fall
on
the
unfortunate
Mortier
and
*NL*
his
one
division
,
and
even
then
Mortier
slips
through
your
fingers
!
*NL*
Where
's
the
victory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
seriously
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
we
can
at
any
rate
say
without
*NL*
boasting
that
it
was
a
little
better
than
at
Ulm
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
capture
one
,
just
one
,
marshal
for
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
not
everything
happens
as
one
expects
or
with
the
smoothness
of
*NL*
a
parade
.
We
had
expected
,
as
I
told
you
,
to
get
at
their
rear
by
seven
*NL*
in
the
morning
but
had
not
reached
it
by
five
in
the
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
n't
you
do
it
at
seven
in
the
morning
?
You
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
,
''
returned
Bilibin
with
a
smile
.
``
You
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
there
at
seven
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
succeed
in
impressing
on
Bonaparte
by
diplomatic
*NL*
methods
that
he
had
better
leave
Genoa
alone
?
''
retorted
Prince
Andrew
in
*NL*
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
interrupted
Bilibin
,
``
you
're
thinking
it
's
very
easy
to
take
*NL*
marshals
,
sitting
on
a
sofa
by
the
fire
!
That
is
true
,
but
still
why
*NL*
did
n't
you
capture
him
?
So
do
n't
be
surprised
if
not
only
the
Minister
*NL*
of
War
but
also
his
Most
August
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
King
Francis
is
*NL*
not
much
delighted
by
your
victory
.
Even
I
,
a
poor
secretary
of
the
*NL*
Russian
Embassy
,
do
not
feel
any
need
in
token
of
my
joy
to
give
my
*NL*
Franz
a
thaler
,
or
let
him
go
with
his
Liebchen
to
the
Prater
...
True
,
*NL*
we
have
no
Prater
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
straight
at
Prince
Andrew
and
suddenly
unwrinkled
his
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
now
my
turn
to
ask
you
`
why
?

said
Bolkonski
.
``
I
*NL*
confess
I
do
not
understand

perhaps
there
are
diplomatic
subtleties

here
beyond
my
feeble
intelligence

but
I
ca
n't
make
it
out

Mack
loses
*NL*
a

army
,
the
Archduke
Ferdinand
and
the
Archduke
Karl
give
no
signs
*NL*
of
life

make
blunder
after
blunder

Kutuzov
alone
at
last
gains
a
*NL*
real
victory
,
destroying
the
spell
of
the
invincibility
of
the
French
,
*NL*
and
the
Minister

does
not
even
care

details

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it

my

You
see
it
's
hurrah
for
the
Tsar

for
*NL*
Russia
,
for
the
Orthodox
Greek
faith

All
that
is
beautiful

but
what

Austrian
court

news

one
archduke

as

good
as
another

even
if
it
is
only
over
a
fire
brigade
*NL*
of
Bonaparte

,
that
will
be
another
story

we
'll
fire
off
some
*NL*
cannon
!
But
this
sort
of
thing
seems
done
on
purpose
to
vex
us

The
*NL*
Archduke
Karl
does
nothing

the
Archduke

disgraces
himself

You
abandon

give
up
its
defense

as
much
as
to
say
:

Heaven
is

heaven
help
you

your
capital

The
one
general

all
loved

you
expose
to
a
bullet

you
congratulate

Admit
that
more

have
been
conceived

It

Besides

suppose
you
did
gain

what

*NL*
*NL*
After
the
fatigues
and
impressions
of
the
journey
,
his
reception
,
and
*NL*
especially
after
having
dined
,
Bolkonski
felt
that
he

the
full
significance
of
the
words

heard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Count

was
here
this
morning

Bilibin
continued
,
``

showed
me
a

was
fully

described

Prince
Murat
et

You
see
that
your

victory
is
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
I
do
n't

about
that

I
do

''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
beginning
to
understand
that
his
news
of
the
battle
before
Krems
*NL*
was
really
of
small
importance
in
view
of
such
events
as
the
fall
of
*NL*
Austria
's
capital
.
``
How
is

reports
that
*NL*
Prince
Auersperg
was
defending
Vienna
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Auersperg
is
on
this
,
on
our
side
of
the
river
,
and
is
defending
*NL*
us
--
doing
it
very
badly
,
I
think
,
but
still
he
is
defending
us
.
But
*NL*
Vienna
is
on
the
other
side
.
No
,
the
bridge
has
not
yet
been
taken
and
I
*NL*
hope
it
will
not
be
,
for
it
is
mined
and
orders
have
been
given
to
blow
*NL*
it
up
.
Otherwise
we
should
long
ago
have
been
in
the
mountains
of
*NL*
Bohemia
,
and
you
and
your
army
would
have
spent
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
between
two
fires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
this
does
not
mean
that
the
campaign
is
over
,
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
it
is
.
The
bigwigs
here
think
so
too
,
but
they
dare
n't
*NL*
say
so
.
It
will
be
as
I
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
,
it
wo
n't
*NL*
be
your
skirmishing
at
Durrenstein
,
or
gunpowder
at
all
,
that
will
*NL*
decide
the
matter
,
but
those
who
devised
it
,
''
said
Bilibin
quoting
one
*NL*
of
his
own
mots
,
releasing
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
,
and
pausing
.
*NL*
``
The
only
question
is
what
will
come
of
the
meeting
between
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
and
the
King
of
Prussia
in
Berlin
?
If
Prussia
joins
the
*NL*
Allies
,
Austria
's
hand
will
be
forced
and
there
will
be
war
.
If
not
it
*NL*
is
merely
a
question
of
settling
where
the
preliminaries
of
the
new
*NL*
Campo
Formio
are
to
be
drawn
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
extraordinary
genius
!
''
Prince
Andrew
suddenly
exclaimed
,
*NL*
clenching
his
small
hand
and
striking
the
table
with
it
,
``
and
what
luck
*NL*
the
man
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buonaparte
?
''
said
Bilibin
inquiringly
,
puckering
up
his
forehead
to
*NL*
indicate
that
he
was
about
to
say
something
witty
.
``
Buonaparte
?
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
accentuating
the
u
:
``
I
think
,
however
,
now
that
he
lays
down
*NL*
laws
for
Austria
at
Schonbrunn
,
il
faut
lui
faire
grace
de
l'
u
!
*
I
*NL*
shall
certainly
adopt
an
innovation
and
call
him
simply
Bonaparte
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
We
must
let
him
off
the
u
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
joking
apart
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
do
you
really
think
the
*NL*
campaign
is
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
think
.
Austria
has
been
made
a
fool
of
,
and
she
is
not
*NL*
used
to
it
.
She
will
retaliate
.
And
she
has
been
fooled
in
the
first
*NL*
place
because
her
provinces
have
been
pillaged
--
they
say
the
Holy
*NL*
Russian
army
loots
terribly
--
her
army
is
destroyed
,
her
capital
taken
,
*NL*
and
all
this
for
the
beaux
yeux
*
of
His
Sardinian
Majesty
.
And
*NL*
therefore
--
this
is
between
ourselves
--
I
instinctively
feel
that
we
are
*NL*
being
deceived
,
my
instinct
tells
me
of
negotiations
with
France
and
*NL*
projects
for
peace
,
a
secret
peace
concluded
separately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Fine
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
Prince
Andrew
.
``
That
would
be
too
base
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
live
we
shall
see
,
''
replied
Bilibin
,
his
face
again
becoming
*NL*
smooth
as
a
sign
that
the
conversation
was
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
room
prepared
for
him
and
lay
down
in
a
*NL*
clean
shirt
on
the
feather
bed
with
its
warmed
and
fragrant
pillows
,
he
*NL*
felt
that
the
battle
of
which
he
had
brought
tidings
was
far
,
far
away
*NL*
from
him
.
The
alliance
with
Prussia
,
Austria
's
treachery
,
Bonaparte
's
*NL*
new
triumph
,
tomorrow
's
levee
and
parade
,
and
the
audience
with
the
*NL*
Emperor
Francis
occupied
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
,
and
immediately
a
sound
of
cannonading
,
of
musketry
*NL*
and
the
rattling
of
carriage
wheels
seemed
to
fill
his
ears
,
and
now
*NL*
again
drawn
out
in
a
thin
line
the
musketeers
were
descending
the
hill
,
*NL*
the
French
were
firing
,
and
he
felt
his
heart
palpitating
as
he
rode
*NL*
forward
beside
Schmidt
with
the
bullets
merrily
whistling
all
around
,
*NL*
and
he
experienced
tenfold
the
joy
of
living
,
as
he
had
not
done
since
*NL*
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
up
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
all
happened
!
''
he
said
,
and
,
smiling
happily
to
himself
like
*NL*
a
child
,
he
fell
into
a
deep
,
youthful
slumber
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
woke
late
.
Recalling
his
recent
impressions
,
the
first
*NL*
thought
that
came
into
his
mind
was
that
today
he
had
to
be
presented
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
Francis
;
he
remembered
the
Minister
of
War
,
the
polite
*NL*
Austrian
adjutant
,
Bilibin
,
and
last
night
's
conversation
.
Having
*NL*
dressed
for
his
attendance
at
court
in
full
parade
uniform
,
which
he
had
*NL*
not
worn
for
a
long
time
,
he
went
into
Bilibin
's
study
fresh
,
animated
,
*NL*
and
handsome
,
with
his
hand
bandaged
.
In
the
study
were
four
gentlemen
*NL*
of
the
diplomatic
corps
.
With
Prince
Hippolyte
Kuragin
,
who
was
a
*NL*
secretary
to
the
embassy
,
Bolkonski
was
already
acquainted
.
Bilibin
*NL*
introduced
him
to
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
assembled
at
Bilibin
's
were
young
,
wealthy
,
gay
society
*NL*
men
,
who
here
,
as
in
Vienna
,
formed
a
special
set
which
Bilibin
,
their
*NL*
leader
,
called
les
notres
.
*
This
set
,
consisting
almost
exclusively
of
*NL*
diplomats
,
evidently
had
its
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
war
or
politics
but
related
to
high
society
,
to
certain
women
,
and
to
*NL*
the
official
side
of
the
service
.
These
gentlemen
received
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
as
one
of
themselves
,
an
honor
they
did
not
extend
to
many
.
From
*NL*
politeness
and
to
start
conversation
,
they
asked
him
a
few
questions
*NL*
about
the
army
and
the
battle
,
and
then
the
talk
went
off
into
merry
*NL*
jests
and
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
best
of
it
was
,
''
said
one
,
telling
of
the
misfortune
of
a
*NL*
fellow
diplomat
,
``
that
the
Chancellor
told
him
flatly
that
his
*NL*
appointment
to
London
was
a
promotion
and
that
he
was
so
to
regard
it
.
*NL*
Can
you
fancy
the
figure
he
cut
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
worst
of
it
,
gentlemen
--
I
am
giving
Kuragin
away
to
you
--
is
*NL*
that
that
man
suffers
,
and
this
Don
Juan
,
wicked
fellow
,
is
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
was
lolling
in
a
lounge
chair
with
his
legs
over
its
*NL*
arm
.
He
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
that
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
Don
Juan
!
You
serpent
!
''
cried
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Bolkonski
,
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Bilibin
turning
to
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
``
that
all
the
atrocities
of
the
French
army
-LRB-
I
nearly
said
of
the
*NL*
Russian
army
-RRB-
are
nothing
compared
to
what
this
man
has
been
doing
among
*NL*
the
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
femme
est
la
compagne
de
l'homme
,
''
*
announced
Prince
Hippolyte
,
and
*NL*
began
looking
through
a
lorgnette
at
his
elevated
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Woman
is
man
's
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
and
the
rest
of
``
ours
''
burst
out
laughing
in
Hippolyte
's
face
,
*NL*
and
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
Hippolyte
,
of
whom
--
he
had
to
admit
--
he
had
*NL*
almost
been
jealous
on
his
wife
's
account
,
was
the
butt
of
this
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
must
give
you
a
treat
,
''
Bilibin
whispered
to
Bolkonski
.
``
Kuragin
*NL*
is
exquisite
when
he
discusses
politics
--
you
should
see
his
gravity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
beside
Hippolyte
and
wrinkling
his
forehead
began
talking
to
*NL*
him
about
politics
.
Prince
Andrew
and
the
others
gathered
round
these
*NL*
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Berlin
cabinet
can
not
express
a
feeling
of
alliance
,
''
began
*NL*
Hippolyte
gazing
round
with
importance
at
the
others
,
``
without
*NL*
expressing
...
as
in
its
last
note
...
you
understand
...
Besides
,
unless
*NL*
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
derogates
from
the
principle
of
our
alliance
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
I
have
not
finished
...
''
he
said
to
Prince
Andrew
,
seizing
him
by
*NL*
the
arm
,
``
I
believe
that
intervention
will
be
stronger
than
*NL*
nonintervention
.
And
...
''
he
paused
.
``
Finally
one
can
not
impute
the
*NL*
nonreceipt
of
our
dispatch
of
November
18
.
That
is
how
it
will
end
.
''
And
*NL*
he
released
Bolkonski
's
arm
to
indicate
that
he
had
now
quite
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Demosthenes
,
I
know
thee
by
the
pebble
thou
secretest
in
thy
golden
*NL*
mouth
!
''
said
Bilibin
,
and
the
mop
of
hair
on
his
head
moved
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
laughed
,
and
Hippolyte
louder
than
anyone
.
He
was
evidently
*NL*
distressed
,
and
breathed
painfully
,
but
could
not
restrain
the
wild
*NL*
laughter
that
convulsed
his
usually
impassive
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Bilibin
,
``
Bolkonski
is
my
guest
in
this
*NL*
house
and
in
Brunn
itself

I
want
to
entertain
him
as
far
as
I
can
,
with
*NL*
all
the
pleasures
of
life
here
.
If
we
were
in
Vienna
it
would
be
easy
,
*NL*
but
here
,
in
this
wretched
Moravian
hole
,
it
is
more
difficult
,
and
I
*NL*
beg
you
all
to
help
me

Brunn
's
attractions
must
be
shown
him

You

the

women

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
let
him
see

said
one
of
``
ours

*NL*
kissing
his
finger
tips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
general
we
must
turn

*NL*
``

Prince

several

accompanying

smiling

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
levee
Prince
Andrew
stood
among
the
Austrian
officers
as
he
had
*NL*
been
told
to
,
and
the
Emperor
Francis
merely
looked
fixedly
into
his
*NL*
face
and
just
nodded
to
him
with
his
long
head
.
But
after
it
was
over
,
*NL*
the
adjutant
he
had
seen
the
previous
day
ceremoniously
informed
*NL*
Bolkonski
that
the
Emperor
desired
to
give
him
an
audience
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
Francis
received
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
Before
the
*NL*
conversation
began
Prince
Andrew
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
Emperor
*NL*
seemed
confused
and
blushed
as
if
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
when
did
the
battle
begin
?
''
he
asked
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
replied
.
Then
followed
other
questions
just
as
simple
:
*NL*
``
Was
Kutuzov
well
?
When
had
he
left
Krems
?
''
and
so
on
.
The
Emperor
spoke
*NL*
as
if
his
sole
aim
were
to
put
a
given
number
of
questions
--
the
answers
*NL*
to
these
questions
,
as
was
only
too
evident
,
did
not
interest
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
o'clock
did
the
battle
begin
?
''
asked
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
inform
Your
Majesty
at
what
o'clock
the
battle
began
at
the
*NL*
front
,
but
at
Durrenstein
,
where
I
was
,
our
attack
began
after
five
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
''
replied
Bolkonski
growing
more
animated
and
expecting
*NL*
that
he
would
have
a
chance
to
give
a
reliable
account
,
which
he
had
*NL*
ready
in
his
mind
,
of
all
he
knew
and
had
seen
.
But
the
Emperor
smiled
*NL*
and
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
miles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
where
to
where
,
Your
Majesty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Durrenstein
to
Krems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
and
a
half
miles
,
Your
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
French
have
abandoned
the
left
bank
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
According
to
the
scouts
the
last
of
them
crossed
on
rafts
during
the
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
sufficient
forage
in
Krems
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forage
has
not
been
supplied
to
the
extent
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
o'clock
was
General
Schmidt
killed

*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
thanked
Prince
Andrew
and
bowed
.
Prince
Andrew
withdrew
and
*NL*
was
immediately
surrounded
by
courtiers
on
all
sides
.
Everywhere
he
saw
*NL*
friendly
looks
and
heard
friendly
words
.
Yesterday
's
adjutant
reproached
*NL*
him
for
not
having
stayed
at
the
palace
,
and
offered
him
his
own
house
.
*NL*
The
Minister
of
War
came
up
and
congratulated
him
on
the
Maria
Theresa
*NL*
Order
of
the
third
grade
,
which
the
Emperor
was
conferring
on
him
.
The
*NL*
Empress
'
chamberlain
invited
him
to
see
Her
Majesty
.
The
archduchess
*NL*
also
wished
to
see
him
.
He
did
not
know
whom
to
answer
,
and
for
a
few
*NL*
seconds
collected
his
thoughts
.
Then
the
Russian
ambassador
took
him
by
*NL*
the
shoulder
,
led
him
to
the
window
,
and
began
to
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contrary
to
Bilibin
's
forecast
the
news
he
had
brought
was
joyfully
*NL*
received
.
A
thanksgiving
service
was
arranged
,
Kutuzov
was
awarded
the
*NL*
Grand
Cross
of
Maria
Theresa
,
and
the
whole
army
received
rewards
.
*NL*
Bolkonski
was
invited
everywhere
,
and
had
to
spend
the
whole
morning
*NL*
calling
on
the
principal
Austrian
dignitaries
.
Between
four
and
five
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
having
made
all
his
calls
,
he
was
returning
to
Bilibin
's
*NL*
house
thinking
out
a
letter
to
his
father
about
the
battle
and
his
visit
*NL*
to
Brunn
.
At
the
door
he
found
a
vehicle
half
full
of
luggage
.
Franz
,
*NL*
Bilibin
's
man
,
was
dragging
a
portmanteau
with
some
difficulty
out
of
*NL*
the
front
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
returning
to
Bilibin
's
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
to
a
bookshop
to
*NL*
provide
himself
with
some
books
for
the
campaign
,
and
had
spent
some
*NL*
time
in
the
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
your
excellency
!
''
said
Franz
,
with
difficulty
rolling
the
*NL*
portmanteau
into
the
vehicle
,
``
we
are
to
move
on
still
farther
.
The
*NL*
scoundrel
is
again
at
our
heels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
What
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
came
out
to
meet
him
.
His
usually
calm
face
showed
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
Confess
that
this
is
delightful
,
''
said
he
.
``
This
affair
of
*NL*
the

Bridge

at
Vienna

They
have
crossed

striking
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
could
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
do
you
come
from
not
to

coachman
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from

I
heard
nothing
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
n't
see
that

is
packing
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not

What
is
it
all
about

''
inquired
Prince
Andrew
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
all
about
?
Why
,
the
French
have
crossed
the
bridge
that
*NL*
Auersperg
was
defending
,
and
the
bridge
was
not
blown
up
:
so
Murat
is
*NL*
now
rushing
along
the
road
to
Brunn
and
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Here
?
But
why
did
they
not
blow
up
the
bridge

if
it
was
mined
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
ask
you
.
No
one
,
not
even
Bonaparte
,
knows
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
the
bridge
is
crossed
it
means
that
the
army
too
is
lost
?
It
*NL*
will
be
cut
off
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it

''
answered
Bilibin
.
``
Listen
!
The
French
entered
Vienna
*NL*
as
I
told
you

Very

Next

yesterday
,
those

gentlemen

mount

-RRB-
*NL*
`
Gentlemen

says
one
of
them
,
`
you
know
the
Thabor
Bridge
is
mined
and
*NL*
doubly
mined
and
that
there
are
menacing
fortifications
at
its
head
and
*NL*
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
has
been
ordered
to
blow
up
the
bridge
*NL*
and
not
let
us
cross
?
But
it
will
please
our
sovereign
the
Emperor
*NL*
Napoleon
if
we
take
this
bridge

so
let
us
three
go
and
take

Yes

say
the
others

And
off
they
go
and
take
the
bridge
,
cross
it
,
*NL*
and
now
with
their
whole
army
are
on
this
side
of
the
Danube
,
marching
*NL*
on
us
,
you
,

your
lines
of
communication

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
marshalls

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
jesting
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
sadly
and
seriously
.
This
news
*NL*
grieved
him
and
yet
he
was
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
learned
that
the
Russian
army
was
in
such
a
hopeless
*NL*
situation
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
was
destined
to
lead
it
*NL*
out
of
this
position
;
that
here
was
the
Toulon
that
would
lift
him
from
*NL*
the
ranks
of
obscure
officers
and
offer
him
the
first
step
to
fame
!
*NL*
Listening
to
Bilibin
he
was
already
imagining
how
on
reaching
the
army
*NL*
he
would
give
an
opinion
at
the
war
council
which
would
be
the
only
one
*NL*
that
could
save
the
army
,
and
how
he
alone
would
be
entrusted
with
the
*NL*
executing
of
the
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
this
jesting
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
jesting
,
''
Bilibin
went
on
.
``
Nothing
is
truer
or
sadder
.
These
*NL*
gentlemen
ride
onto
the
bridge
alone
and
wave
white
handkerchiefs
;
they
*NL*
assure
the
officer
on
duty
that
they
,
the
marshals
,
are
on
their
way
to
*NL*
negotiate
with
Prince
Auersperg
.
He
lets
them
enter
the
tete-de-pont
.
*
*NL*
They
spin
him
a
thousand
gasconades
,
saying
that
the
war
is
over
,
that
*NL*
the
Emperor
Francis
is
arranging
a
meeting
with
Bonaparte
,
that
they
*NL*
desire
to
see
Prince
Auersperg
,
and
so
on
.
The
officer
sends
for
*NL*
Auersperg
;
these
gentlemen
embrace
the
officers
,
crack
jokes
,
sit
on
the
*NL*
cannon
,
and
meanwhile
a
French
battalion
gets
to
the
bridge
unobserved
,
*NL*
flings
the
bags
of
incendiary
material
into
the
water
,
and
approaches
*NL*
the
tete-de-pont

At
length
appears
the
lieutenant
general

our
dear
*NL*
Prince
Auersperg
von

himself

Dearest

Flower

one
another

The
Emperor
Napoleon
burns
with
impatience
*NL*
to
make
Prince
Auersperg
's
acquaintance
.
'
In
a
word
,
those
gentlemen
,
*NL*
Gascons
indeed
,
so
bewildered
him
with
fine
words
,
and
he
is
so
*NL*
flattered
by
his
rapidly
established
intimacy
with
the
French
marshals
,
*NL*
and
so
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
Murat
's
mantle
and
ostrich
plumes
,

In
spite
of
the
animation
of
his
speech
,
Bilibin
did
not
*NL*
forget
to
pause
after
this
mot
to
give
time
for
its
due
appreciation
.
*NL*
``
The
French
battalion
rushes
to
the
bridgehead
,
spikes
the
guns
,
and
the
*NL*
bridge
is
taken
!
But
what
is
best
of
all
,
''
he
went
on
,
his
excitement
*NL*
subsiding
under
the
delightful
interest
of
his
own
story
,
``
is
that
the
*NL*
sergeant
in
charge
of
the
cannon
which
was
to
give
the
signal
to
fire
*NL*
the
mines
and
blow
up
the
bridge
,
this
sergeant
,
seeing
that
the
French
*NL*
troops
were
running
onto
the
bridge
,
was
about
to
fire
,
but
Lannes
*NL*
stayed
his
hand
.
The
sergeant
,
who
was
evidently
wiser
than
his
general
,
*NL*
goes
up
to
Auersperg
and
says
:
`
Prince
,
you
are
being
deceived
,
here
are
*NL*
the
French
!
'
Murat
,
seeing
that
all
is
lost
if
the
sergeant
is
allowed
*NL*
to
speak
,
turns
to
Auersperg
with
feigned
astonishment
-LRB-
he
is
a
true
*NL*
Gascon
-RRB-
and
says
:
'
I
do
n't
recognize
the
world-famous
Austrian
*NL*
discipline

address

that

It
was
*NL*
a
stroke
of
genius
.
Prince
Auersperg
feels
his
dignity
at
stake
and
*NL*
orders
the
sergeant
to
be
arrested
.
Come
,
you
must
own
that
this
affair
*NL*
of
the
Thabor
Bridge
is
delightful
!
It
is
not
exactly
stupidity

*NL*
rascality

That
their
fire
gets
into
his
eyes
and
he
forgets
that
he
ought
to
*NL*
be
firing
at
the
enemy

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be

Prince

vividly
imagining
the
gray

overcoats

wounds

the
smoke

gunpowder

sounds

firing

the
*NL*
glory

*NL*
``
Not

he
seemed

be
trying

find

he
concluded
,
feeling
that
he
had
*NL*
produced
a
good
epigram
,
a
fresh
one
that
would
be
repeated
.
His
*NL*
hitherto
puckered
brow
became
smooth
as
a
sign
of
pleasure
,
and
with
a
*NL*
slight
smile
he
began
to
examine
his
nails
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are

off

he
said
suddenly
to
Prince

had
risen

was
going
toward

*NL*

And
Prince

after

went
to

*NL*
``

him

*NL*
And
in
proof
of
the
conclusiveness
of
his

all
the

vanished
from
his
face

*NL*
*NL*
Prince

looked
inquiringly
at

gave
no

*NL*
*NL*

unwrinkled

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
night
,
having
taken
leave
of
the
Minister
of
War
,
Bolkonski
*NL*
set
off
to
rejoin
the
army
,
not
knowing
where
he
would
find
it
and
*NL*
fearing
to
be
captured
by
the
French
on
the
way
to
Krems
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Brunn
everybody
attached
to
the
court
was
packing
up
,
and
the
heavy
*NL*
baggage
was
already
being
dispatched
to
Olmutz
.
Near
Hetzelsdorf
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
struck
the
high
road
along
which
the
Russian
army
was
moving
with
*NL*
great
haste
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
.
The
road
was
so
obstructed
*NL*
with
carts
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
by
in
a
carriage
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
took
a
horse
and
a
Cossack
from
a
Cossack
commander
,
and
hungry
and
*NL*
weary
,
making
his
way
past
the
baggage
wagons
,
rode
in
search
of
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
and
of
his
own
luggage
.
Very
sinister
reports
of
the
*NL*
position
of
the
army
reached
him
as
he
went
along
,
and
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
troops
in
their
disorderly
flight
confirmed
these
rumors
.

He
remembered
these
words
in
Bonaparte
's
address
to
*NL*
his
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
,
and
they
awoke
in
him
*NL*
astonishment
at
the
genius
of
his
hero
,
a
feeling
of
wounded
pride
,
and
*NL*
a
hope
of
glory
.
``
And
should
there
be
nothing
left
but
to
die
?
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
Well
,
if
need
be
,
I
shall
do
it
no
worse
than
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
That
Russian
army
which
has
been
brought
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
*NL*
by
English
gold
,
we
shall
cause
to
share
the
same
fate
--
-LRB-
the
fate
of
the
*NL*
army
at
Ulm
-RRB-
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
with
disdain
at
the
endless
confused
mass
of
detachments
,
*NL*
carts
,
guns
,
artillery
,
and
again
baggage
wagons
and
vehicles
of
all
*NL*
kinds
overtaking
one
another
and
blocking
the
muddy
road
,
three
and
*NL*
sometimes
four
abreast
.
From
all
sides
,
behind
and
before
,
as
far
as
ear
*NL*
could
reach
,
there
were
the
rattle
of
wheels
,
the
creaking
of
carts
and
*NL*
gun
carriages
,
the
tramp
of
horses
,
the
crack
of
whips
,
shouts
,
the
*NL*
urging
of
horses
,
and
the
swearing
of
soldiers
,
orderlies
,
and
officers
.
*NL*
All
along
the
sides
of
the
road
fallen
horses
were
to
be
seen
,
some
*NL*
flayed
,
some
not
,
and
broken-down
carts
beside
which
solitary
soldiers
*NL*
sat
waiting
for
something
,
and
again
soldiers
straggling
from
their
*NL*
companies
,
crowds
of
whom
set
off
to
the
neighboring
villages
,
or
*NL*
returned
from
them
dragging
sheep
,
fowls
,
hay
,
and
bulging
sacks
.
At
*NL*
each
ascent
or
descent
of
the
road
the
crowds
were
yet
denser
and
the
*NL*
din
of
shouting
more
incessant
.
Soldiers
floundering
knee-deep
in
mud
*NL*
pushed
the
guns
and
wagons
themselves
.
Whips
cracked
,
hoofs
slipped
,
*NL*
traces
broke
,
and
lungs
were
strained
with
shouting
.
The
officers
*NL*
directing
the
march
rode
backward
and
forward
between
the
carts
.
Their
*NL*
voices
were
but
feebly
heard
amid
the
uproar
and
one
saw
by
their
faces
*NL*
that
they
despaired
of
the
possibility
of
checking
this
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
our
dear
Orthodox
Russian
army
,
''
thought
Bolkonski
,
recalling
*NL*
Bilibin
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wishing
to
find
out
where
the
commander-in-chief
was
,
he
rode
up
to
a
*NL*
convoy
.
Directly
opposite
to
him
came
a
strange
one-horse
vehicle
,
*NL*
evidently
rigged
up
by
soldiers
out
of
any
available
materials
and
*NL*
looking
like
something
between
a
cart
,
a
cabriolet
,
and
a
caleche
.
A
*NL*
soldier
was
driving
,
and
a
woman
enveloped
in
shawls
sat
behind
the
*NL*
apron
under
the
leather
hood
of
the
vehicle
.
Prince
Andrew
rode
up
and
*NL*
was
just
putting
his
question
to
a
soldier
when
his
attention
was
*NL*
diverted
by
the
desperate
shrieks
of
the
woman
in
the
vehicle
.
An
*NL*
officer
in
charge
of
transport
was
beating
the
soldier
who
was
driving
*NL*
the
woman
's
vehicle
for
trying
to
get
ahead
of
others
,
and
the
strokes
*NL*
of
his
whip
fell
on
the
apron
of
the
equipage
.
The
woman
screamed
*NL*
piercingly
.
Seeing
Prince
Andrew
she
leaned
out
from
behind
the
apron
*NL*
and
,
waving
her
thin
arms
from
under
the
woolen
shawl
,
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Aide-de-camp
!
Mr.
Aide-de-camp
!
...
For
heaven
's
sake
...
Protect
me
!
*NL*
What
will
become
of
us
?
I
am
the
wife
of
the
doctor
of
the
Seventh
*NL*
Chasseurs
...
They
wo
n't
let
us
pass
,
we
are
left
behind
and
have
lost
*NL*
our
people
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
!
''
shouted
the
angry
officer
to
the
*NL*
soldier
.
``
Turn
back
with
your
slut
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Aide-de-camp
!
Help
me
!
...
What
does
it
all
mean
?
''
screamed
the
*NL*
doctor
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
let
this
cart
pass
.
Do
n't
you
see
it
's
a
woman
?
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
riding
up
to
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
glanced
at
him
,
and
without
replying
turned
again
to
the
*NL*
soldier
.
``
I
'll
teach
you
to
push
on
!
...
Back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
pass
,
I
tell
you
!
''
repeated
Prince
Andrew
,
compressing
his
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
are
you
?
''
cried
the
officer
,
turning
on
him
with
tipsy
rage
,
*NL*
``
who
are
you
?
Are
you
in
command
here
?
Eh
?
I
am
commander
here
,
not
you
!
*NL*
Go
back
or
I
'll
flatten
you
into
a
pancake
,
''
repeated
he
.
This
*NL*
expression
evidently
pleased
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
a
nice
snub
for
the
little
aide-de-camp
,
''
came
a
voice
from
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
the
officer
was
in
that
state
of
senseless
,
tipsy
*NL*
rage
when
a
man
does
not
know
what
he
is
saying
.
He
saw
that
his
*NL*
championship
of
the
doctor
's
wife
in
her
queer
trap
might
expose
him
to
*NL*
what
he
dreaded
more
than
anything
in
the
world
--
to
ridicule
;
but
his
*NL*
instinct
urged
him
on
.
Before
the
officer
finished
his
sentence
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
his
face
distorted
with
fury
,
rode
up
to
him
and
raised
his
*NL*
riding
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kind
...
ly
let
--
them
--
pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
flourished
his
arm
and
hastily
rode
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
fault
of
these
fellows
on
the
staff
that
there
's
this
*NL*
disorder
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
Do
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
without
lifting
his
eyes
rode
hastily
away
from
the
*NL*
doctor
's
wife
,
who
was
calling
him
her
deliverer
,
and
recalling
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
disgust
the
minutest
details
of
this
humiliating
scene
he
*NL*
galloped
on
to
the
village
where
he
was
told
that
the
commander-in-chief
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
village
he
dismounted
and
went
to
the
nearest
house
,
*NL*
intending
to
rest
if
but
for
a
moment
,
eat
something
,
and
try
to
sort
*NL*
out
the
stinging
and
tormenting
thoughts
that
confused
his
mind
.
``
This
*NL*
is
a
mob
of
scoundrels
and
not
an
army
,
''
he
was
thinking
as
he
went
up
*NL*
to
the
window
of
the
first
house
,
when
a
familiar
voice
called
him
by
*NL*
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
Nesvitski
's
handsome
face
looked
out
of
the
little
*NL*
window
.
Nesvitski
,
moving
his
moist
lips
as
he
chewed
something
,
and
*NL*
flourishing
his
arm
,
called
him
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bolkonski
!
Bolkonski
!
...
Do
n't
you
hear
?
Eh
?
Come
quick
...
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
the
house
,
Prince
Andrew
saw
Nesvitski
and
another
adjutant
*NL*
having
something
to
eat
.
They
hastily
turned
round
to
him
asking
if
he
*NL*
had
any
news
.
On
their
familiar
faces
he
read
agitation
and
alarm
.
This
*NL*
was
particularly
noticeable
on
Nesvitski
's
usually
laughing
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
commander-in-chief
?
''
asked
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
in
that
house
,
''
answered
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
it
true
that
it
's
peace
and
capitulation
?
''
asked
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
ask
you
.
I
know
nothing
except
that
it
was
all
I
could
*NL*
do
to
get
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
,
my
dear
boy
!
It
's
terrible
!
I
was
wrong
to
laugh
at
Mack
,
we
're
*NL*
getting
it
still
worse
,
''
said
Nesvitski
.
``
But
sit
down
and
have
*NL*
something
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
able
to
find
either
your
baggage
or
anything
else
now
,
*NL*
Prince
.
And
God
only
knows
where
your
man
Peter
is
,
''
said
the
other
*NL*
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
headquarters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
to
spend
the
night
in
Znaim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
got
all
I
need
into
packs
for
two
horses
,
''
said
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
``
They
've
made
up
splendid
packs
for
me
--
fit
to
cross
the
Bohemian
*NL*
mountains
with
.
It
's
a
bad
lookout
,
old
fellow
!
But
what
's
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
?
You
must
be
ill
to
shiver
like
that
,
''
he
added
,
noticing
that
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
winced
as
at
an
electric
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
remembered
his
recent
encounter
with
the
doctor
's
wife
and
*NL*
the
convoy
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
commander-in-chief
doing
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
out
at
all
,
''
said
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
I
can
make
out
is
that
everything
is
abominable
,
abominable
,
*NL*
quite
abominable
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
and
he
went
off
to
the
house
*NL*
where
the
commander-in-chief
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
by
Kutuzov
's
carriage
and
the
exhausted
saddle
horses
of
his
*NL*
suite
,
with
their
Cossacks
who
were
talking
loudly
together
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
entered
the
passage
.
Kutuzov
himself
,
he
was
told
,
was
in
the
*NL*
house
with
Prince
Bagration
and
Weyrother
.
Weyrother
was
the
Austrian
*NL*
general
who
had
succeeded
Schmidt
.
In
the
passage
little
Kozlovski
was
*NL*
squatting
on
his
heels
in
front
of
a
clerk
.
The
clerk
,
with
cuffs
turned
*NL*
up
,
was
hastily
writing
at
a
tub
turned
bottom
upwards
.
Kozlovski
's
face
*NL*
looked
worn
--
he
too
had
evidently
not
slept
all
night
.
He
glanced
at
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
and
did
not
even
nod
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Second
line
...
have
you
written
it
?
''
he
continued
dictating
to
the
*NL*
clerk
.
``
The
Kiev
Grenadiers
,
Podolian
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
ca
n't
write
so
fast
,
your
honor
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
glancing
angrily
*NL*
and
disrespectfully
at
Kozlovski
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
door
came
the
sounds
of
Kutuzov
's
voice
,
excited
and
*NL*
dissatisfied
,
interrupted
by
another
,
an
unfamiliar
voice
.
From
the
*NL*
sound
of
these
voices
,
the
inattentive
way
Kozlovski
looked
at
him
,
the
*NL*
disrespectful
manner
of
the
exhausted
clerk
,
the
fact
that
the
clerk
and
*NL*
Kozlovski
were
squatting
on
the
floor
by
a
tub
so
near
to
the
commander
*NL*
in
chief
,
and
from
the
noisy
laughter
of
the
Cossacks
holding
the
horses
*NL*
near
the
window
,
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
something
important
and
*NL*
disastrous
was
about
to
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
Kozlovski
with
urgent
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
Prince
,
''
said
Kozlovski
.
``
Dispositions
for
Bagration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
capitulation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
sort
.
Orders
are
issued
for
a
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
moved
toward
the
door
from
whence
voices
were
heard
.
Just
*NL*
as
he
was
going
to
open
it
the
sounds
ceased
,
the
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
Kutuzov
with
his
eagle
nose
and
puffy
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
stood
right
in
front
of
Kutuzov
but
the
expression
of
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
's
one
sound
eye
showed
him
to
be
so
preoccupied
with
*NL*
thoughts
and
anxieties
as
to
be
oblivious
of
his
presence
.
He
looked
*NL*
straight
at
his
adjutant
's
face
without
recognizing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
finished
?
''
said
he
to
Kozlovski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
,
a
gaunt
middle-aged
man
of
medium
height
with
a
firm
,
*NL*
impassive
face
of
Oriental
type
,
came
out
after
the
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
to
present
myself
,
''
repeated
Prince
Andrew
rather
*NL*
loudly
,
handing
Kutuzov
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
from
Vienna
?
Very
good
.
Later
,
later
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
went
out
into
the
porch
with
Bagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
,
Prince
,
''
said
he
to
Bagration
.
``
My
blessing
,
and
may
*NL*
Christ
be
with
you
in
your
great
endeavor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
suddenly
softened
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
.
With
his
left
*NL*
hand
he
drew
Bagration
toward
him
,
and
with
his
right
,
on
which
he
wore
*NL*
a
ring
,
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
him
with
a
gesture
evidently
*NL*
habitual
,
offering
his
puffy
cheek
,
but
Bagration
kissed
him
on
the
neck
*NL*
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christ
be
with
you
!
''
Kutuzov
repeated
and
went
toward
his
carriage
.
*NL*
``
Get
in
with
me
,
''
said
he
to
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
I
should
like
to
be
of
use
here
.
Allow
me
to
remain
*NL*
with
Prince
Bagration
's
detachment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
,
''
said
Kutuzov
,
and
noticing
that
Bolkonski
still
delayed
,
he
*NL*
added
:
``
I
need
good
officers
myself
,
need
them
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
still
much
,
much
before
us
,
''
he
said
,
as
if
with
an
old
man
's
*NL*
penetration
he
understood
all
that
was
passing
in
Bolkonski
's
mind
.
``
If
*NL*
a
tenth
part
of
his
detachment
returns
I
shall
thank
God
,
''
he
added
as
*NL*
if
speaking
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
glanced
at
Kutuzov
's
face
only
a
foot
distant
from
him
and
*NL*
involuntarily
noticed
the
carefully
washed
seams
of
the
scar
near
his
*NL*
temple
,
where
an
Ismail
bullet
had
pierced
his
skull
,
and
the
empty
eye
*NL*
socket
.
``
Yes
,
he
has
a
right
to
speak
so
calmly
of
those
men
's
death
,
''
*NL*
thought
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
why
I
beg
to
be
sent
to
that
detachment
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
did
not
reply
.
He
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
he
had
been
*NL*
saying
,
and
sat
plunged
in
thought
.
Five
minutes
later
,
gently
swaying
*NL*
on
the
soft
springs
of
the
carriage
,
he
turned
to
Prince
Andrew
.
There
*NL*
was
not
a
trace
of
agitation
on
his
face
.
With
delicate
irony
he
*NL*
questioned
Prince
Andrew
about
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
about
the
remarks
he
had
heard
at
court
concerning
the
Krems
*NL*
affair
,
and
about
some
ladies
they
both
knew
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
On
November
1
Kutuzov
had
received
,
through
a
spy
,
news
that
the
army
he
*NL*
commanded
was
in
an
almost
hopeless
position
.
The
spy
reported
that
the
*NL*
French
,
after
crossing
the
bridge
at
Vienna
,
were
advancing
in
immense
*NL*
force
upon
Kutuzov
's
line
of
communication
with
the
troops
that
were
*NL*
arriving
from
Russia
.
If
Kutuzov
decided
to
remain
at
Krems
,
Napoleon
's
*NL*
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
would
cut
him
off
completely
*NL*
and
surround
his
exhausted
army
of
forty
thousand
,
and
he
would
find
*NL*
himself
in
the
position
of
Mack
at
Ulm
.
If
Kutuzov
decided
to
abandon
*NL*
the
road
connecting
him
with
the
troops
arriving
from
Russia
,
he
would
*NL*
have
to
march
with
no
road
into
unknown
parts
of
the
Bohemian
mountains
,
*NL*
defending
himself
against
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
and
abandoning
*NL*
all
hope
of
a
junction
with
Buxhowden
.
If
Kutuzov
decided
to
retreat
*NL*
along
the
road
from
Krems
to
Olmutz
,
to
unite
with
the
troops
arriving
*NL*
from
Russia
,
he
risked
being
forestalled
on
that
road
by
the
French
who
*NL*
had
crossed
the
Vienna
bridge
,
and
encumbered
by
his
baggage
and
*NL*
transport
,
having
to
accept
battle
on
the
march
against
an
enemy
three
*NL*
times
as
strong
,
who
would
hem
him
in
from
two
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
chose
this
latter
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
the
spy
reported
,
having
crossed
the
Vienna
bridge
,
were
*NL*
advancing
by
forced
marches
toward
Znaim
,
which
lay
sixty-six
miles
off
*NL*
on
the
line
of
Kutuzov
's
retreat
.
If
he
reached
Znaim
before
the
French
,
*NL*
there
would
be
great
hope
of
saving
the
army
;
to
let
the
French
*NL*
forestall
him
at
Znaim
meant
the
exposure
of
his
whole
army
to
a
*NL*
disgrace
such
as
that
of
Ulm
,
or
to
utter
destruction
.
But
to
forestall
*NL*
the
French
with
his
whole
army
was
impossible
.
The
road
for
the
French
*NL*
from
Vienna
to
Znaim
was
shorter
and
better
than
the
road
for
the
*NL*
Russians
from
Krems
to
Znaim
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
he
received
the
news
,
Kutuzov
sent
Bagration
's
vanguard
,
four
*NL*
thousand
strong
,
to
the
right
across
the
hills
from
the
Krems-Znaim
to
*NL*
the
Vienna-Znaim
road
.
Bagration
was
to
make
this
march
without
resting
,
*NL*
and
to
halt
facing
Vienna
with
Znaim
to
his
rear
,
and
if
he
succeeded
in
*NL*
forestalling
the
French
he
was
to
delay
them
as
long
as
possible
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
himself
with
all
his
transport
took
the
road
to
Znaim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marching
thirty
miles
that
stormy
night
across
roadless
hills
,
with
his
*NL*
hungry
,
ill-shod
soldiers
,
and
losing
a
third
of
his
men
as
stragglers
*NL*
by
the
way
,
Bagration
came
out
on
the
Vienna-Znaim
road
at
Hollabrunn
a
*NL*
few
hours
ahead
of
the
French
who
were
approaching
Hollabrunn
from
*NL*
Vienna
.
Kutuzov
with
his
transport
had
still
to
march
for
some
days
*NL*
before
he
could
reach
Znaim
.
Hence
Bagration
with
his
four
thousand
*NL*
hungry
,
exhausted
men
would
have
to
detain
for
days
the
whole
enemy
army
*NL*
that
came
upon
him
at
Hollabrunn
,
which
was
clearly
impossible
.
But
a
*NL*
freak
of
fate
made
the
impossible
possible
.
The
success
of
the
trick
*NL*
that
had
placed
the
Vienna
bridge
in
the
hands
of
the
French
without
a
*NL*
fight
led
Murat
to
try
to
deceive
Kutuzov
in
a
similar
way
.
Meeting
*NL*
Bagration
's
weak
detachment
on
the
Znaim
road
he
supposed
it
to
be
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
whole
army
.
To
be
able
to
crush
it
absolutely
he
awaited
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
who
were
on
their
way
from
Vienna
,
and
*NL*
with
this
object
offered
a
three
days
'
truce
on
condition
that
both
*NL*
armies
should
remain
in
position
without
moving
.
Murat
declared
that
*NL*
negotiations
for
peace
were
already
proceeding
,
and
that
he
therefore
*NL*
offered
this
truce
to
avoid
unnecessary
bloodshed
.
Count
Nostitz
,
the
*NL*
Austrian
general
occupying
the
advanced
posts
,
believed
Murat
's
emissary
*NL*
and
retired
,
leaving
Bagration
's
division
exposed
.
Another
emissary
rode
*NL*
to
the
Russian
line
to
announce
the
peace
negotiations
and
to
offer
the
*NL*
Russian
army
the
three
days
'
truce
.
Bagration
replied
that
he
was
not
*NL*
authorized
either
to
accept
or
refuse
a
truce
and
sent
his
adjutant
to
*NL*
Kutuzov
to
report
the
offer
he
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
truce
was
Kutuzov
's
sole
chance
of
gaining
time
,
giving
Bagration
's
*NL*
exhausted
troops
some
rest
,
and
letting
the
transport
and
heavy
convoys
*NL*
-LRB-
whose
movements
were
concealed
from
the
French
-RRB-
advance
if
but
one
*NL*
stage
nearer
Znaim
.
The
offer
of
a
truce
gave
the
only
,
and
a
quite
*NL*
unexpected
,
chance
of
saving
the
army
.
On
receiving
the
news
he
*NL*
immediately
dispatched
Adjutant
General
Wintzingerode
,
who
was
in
*NL*
attendance
on
him
,
to
the
enemy
camp
.
Wintzingerode
was
not
merely
to
*NL*
agree
to
the
truce
but
also
to
offer
terms
of
capitulation
,
and
*NL*
meanwhile
Kutuzov
sent
his
adjutants
back
to
hasten
to
the
utmost
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
baggage
trains
of
the
entire
army
along
the
Krems-Znaim
*NL*
road
.
Bagration
's
exhausted
and
hungry
detachment
,
which
alone
covered
*NL*
this
movement
of
the
transport
and
of
the
whole
army
,
had
to
remain
*NL*
stationary
in
face
of
an
enemy
eight
times
as
strong
as
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
expectations
that
the
proposals
of
capitulation
-LRB-
which
were
in
*NL*
no
way
binding
-RRB-
might
give
time
for
part
of
the
transport
to
pass
,
and
*NL*
also
that
Murat
's
mistake
would
very
soon
be
discovered
,
proved
correct
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
Bonaparte
-LRB-
who
was
at
Schonbrunn
,
sixteen
miles
from
*NL*
Hollabrunn
-RRB-
received
Murat
's
dispatch
with
the
proposal
of
a
truce
and
a
*NL*
capitulation
,
he
detected
a
ruse
and
wrote
the
following
letter
to
*NL*
Murat
:
*NL*
*NL*
Schonbrunn
,
25th
Brumaire
,
1805
,
*NL*
*NL*
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
*NL*
*NL*
To
PRINCE
MURAT
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
find
words
to
express
to
you
my
displeasure
.
You
command
only
*NL*
my
advance
guard
,
and
have
no
right
to
arrange
an
armistice
without
my
*NL*
order
.
You
are
causing
me
to
lose
the
fruits
of
a
campaign
.
Break
the
*NL*
armistice
immediately
and
march
on
the
enemy
.
Inform
him
that
the
*NL*
general
who
signed
that
capitulation
had
no
right
to
do
so
,
and
that
no
*NL*
one
but
the
Emperor
of
Russia
has
that
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
however
,
the
Emperor
of
Russia
ratifies
that
convention
,
I
will
*NL*
ratify
it
;
but
it
is
only
a
trick
.
March
on
,
destroy
the
Russian
*NL*
army
...
You
are
in
a
position
to
seize
its
baggage
and
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
Emperor
's
aide-de-camp
is
an
impostor
.
Officers
are
nothing
*NL*
when
they
have
no
powers
;
this
one
had
none
...
The
Austrians
let
*NL*
themselves
be
tricked
at
the
crossing
of
the
Vienna
bridge
,
you
are
*NL*
letting
yourself
be
tricked
by
an
aide-de-camp
of
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
NAPOLEON
*NL*
*NL*
Bonaparte
's
adjutant
rode
full
gallop
with
this
menacing
letter
to
*NL*
Murat
.
Bonaparte
himself
,
not
trusting
to
his
generals
,
moved
with
all
*NL*
the
Guards
to
the
field
of
battle
,
afraid
of
letting
a
ready
victim
*NL*
escape
,
and
Bagration
's
four
thousand
men
merrily
lighted
campfires
,
*NL*
dried
and
warmed
themselves
,
cooked
their
porridge
for
the
first
time
*NL*
for
three
days
,
and
not
one
of
them
knew
or
imagined
what
was
in
store
*NL*
for
him
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Between
three
and
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
Prince
Andrew
,
who
had
*NL*
persisted
in
his
request
to
Kutuzov
,
arrived
at
Grunth
and
reported
*NL*
himself
to
Bagration
.
Bonaparte
's
adjutant
had
not
yet
reached
Murat
's
*NL*
detachment
and
the
battle
had
not
yet
begun
.
In
Bagration
's
detachment
*NL*
no
one
knew
anything
of
the
general
position
of
affairs
.
They
talked
of
*NL*
peace
but
did
not
believe
in
its
possibility
;
others
talked
of
a
battle
*NL*
but
also
disbelieved
in
the
nearness
of
an
engagement
.
Bagration
,
*NL*
knowing
Bolkonski
to
be
a
favorite
and
trusted
adjutant
,
received
him
*NL*
with
distinction
and
special
marks
of
favor
,
explaining
to
him
that
*NL*
there
would
probably
be
an
engagement
that
day
or
the
next
,
and
giving
*NL*
him
full
liberty
to
remain
with
him
during
the
battle
or
to
join
the
*NL*
rearguard
and
have
an
eye
on
the
order
of
retreat
,
``
which
is
also
very
*NL*
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
there
will
hardly
be
an
engagement
today
,
''
said
Bagration
as
*NL*
if
to
reassure
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
one
of
the
ordinary
little
staff
dandies
sent
to
earn
a
medal
*NL*
he
can
get
his
reward
just
as
well
in
the
rearguard
,
but
if
he
wishes
to
*NL*
stay
with
me
,
let
him
...
he
'll
be
of
use
here
if
he
's
a
brave
officer
,
''
*NL*
thought
Bagration
.
Prince
Andrew
,
without
replying
,
asked
the
prince
's
*NL*
permission
to
ride
round
the
position
to
see
the
disposition
of
the
*NL*
forces
,
so
as
to
know
his
bearings
should
he
be
sent
to
execute
an
*NL*
order
.
The
officer
on
duty
,
a
handsome
,
elegantly
dressed
man
with
a
*NL*
diamond
ring
on
his
forefinger
,
who
was
fond
of
speaking
French
though
*NL*
he
spoke
it
badly
,
offered
to
conduct
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
all
sides
they
saw
rain-soaked
officers
with
dejected
faces
who
*NL*
seemed
to
be
seeking
something
,
and
soldiers
dragging
doors
,
benches
,
*NL*
and
fencing
from
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
Prince
!
We
ca
n't
stop
those
fellows
,
''
said
the
staff
officer
*NL*
pointing
to
the
soldiers
.
``
The
officers
do
n't
keep
them
in
hand
.
And
*NL*
there
,
''
he
pointed
to
a
sutler
's
tent
,
``
they
crowd
in
and
sit
.
This
*NL*
morning
I
turned
them
all
out
and
now
look
,
it
's
full
again
.
I
must
go
*NL*
there
,
Prince
,
and
scare
them
a
bit
.
It
wo
n't
take
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
let
's
go
in
and
I
will
get
myself
a
roll
and
some
cheese
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
who
had
not
yet
had
time
to
eat
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
mention
it
,
Prince
?
I
would
have
offered
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
dismounted
and
entered
the
tent
.
Several
officers
,
with
flushed
and
*NL*
weary
faces
,
were
sitting
at
the
table
eating
and
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
what
does
this
mean
,
gentlemen
?
''
said
the
staff
officer
,
in
the
*NL*
reproachful
tone
of
a
man
who
has
repeated
the
same
thing
more
than
*NL*
once
.
``
You
know
it
wo
n't
do
to
leave
your
posts
like
this
.
The
prince
*NL*
gave
orders
that
no
one
should
leave
his
post
.
Now
you
,
Captain
,
''
and
he
*NL*
turned
to
a
thin
,
dirty
little
artillery
officer
who
without
his
boots
*NL*
-LRB-
he
had
given
them
to
the
canteen
keeper
to
dry
-RRB-
,
in
only
his
stockings
,
*NL*
rose
when
they
entered
,
smiling
not
altogether
comfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
,
Captain
Tushin
?
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
``
One
would
think
that
as
an
artillery
officer
you
would
set
a
good
*NL*
example
,
yet
here
you
are
without
your
boots
!
The
alarm
will
be
sounded
*NL*
and
you
'll
be
in
a
pretty
position
without
your
boots
!
''
-LRB-
The
staff
*NL*
officer
smiled
.
-RRB-
``
Kindly
return
to
your
posts
,
gentlemen
,
all
of
you
,
*NL*
all
!
''
he
added
in
a
tone
of
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
looked
at
the
artillery
officer
*NL*
Tushin
,
who
silent
and
smiling
,
shifting
from
one
stockinged
foot
to
the
*NL*
other
,
glanced
inquiringly
with
his
large
,
intelligent
,
kindly
eyes
from
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
to
the
staff
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
soldiers
say
it
feels
easier
without
boots
,
''
said
Captain
Tushin
*NL*
smiling
shyly
in
his
uncomfortable
position
,
evidently
wishing
to
adopt
*NL*
a
jocular
tone
.
But
before
he
had
finished
he
felt
that
his
jest
was
*NL*
unacceptable
and
had
not
come
off
.
He
grew
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
return
to
your
posts
,
''
said
the
staff
officer
trying
to
preserve
*NL*
his
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
glanced
again
at
the
artillery
officer
's
small
figure
.
*NL*
There
was
something
peculiar
about
it
,
quite
unsoldierly
,
rather
comic
,
*NL*
but
extremely
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staff
officer
and
Prince
Andrew
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ridden
beyond
the
village
,
continually
meeting
and
overtaking
*NL*
soldiers
and
officers
of
various
regiments
,
they
saw
on
their
left
some
*NL*
entrenchments
being
thrown
up
,
the
freshly
dug
clay
of
which
showed
up
*NL*
red
.
Several
battalions
of
soldiers
,
in
their
shirt
sleeves
despite
the
*NL*
cold
wind
,
swarmed
in
these
earthworks
like
a
host
of
white
ants
;
*NL*
spadefuls
of
red
clay
were
continually
being
thrown
up
from
behind
the
*NL*
bank
by
unseen
hands
.
Prince
Andrew
and
the
officer
rode
up
,
looked
at
*NL*
the
entrenchment
,
and
went
on
again
.
Just
behind
it
they
came
upon
some
*NL*
dozens
of
soldiers
,
continually
replaced
by
others
,
who
ran
from
the
*NL*
entrenchment
.
They
had
to
hold
their
noses
and
put
their
horses
to
a
*NL*
trot
to
escape
from
the
poisoned
atmosphere
of
these
latrines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voila
l'agrement
des
camps
,
monsieur
le
Prince
,
''
*
said
the
staff
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
This
is
a
pleasure
one
gets
in
camp
,
Prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rode
up
the
opposite
hill
.
From
there
the
French
could
already
be
*NL*
seen
.
Prince
Andrew
stopped
and
began
examining
the
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
our
battery
,
''
said
the
staff
officer
indicating
the
highest
*NL*
point
.
``
It
's
in
charge
of
the
queer
fellow
we
saw
without
his
boots
.
You
*NL*
can
see
everything
from
there
;
let
's
go
there
,
Prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
I
will
go
on
alone
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
wishing
*NL*
to
rid
himself
of
this
staff
officer
's
company
,
``
please
do
n't
trouble
*NL*
yourself
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
staff
officer
remained
behind
and
Prince
Andrew
rode
on
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farther
forward
and
nearer
the
enemy
he
went
,
the
more
orderly
and
*NL*
cheerful
were
the
troops
.
The
greatest
disorder
and
depression
had
been
*NL*
in
the
baggage
train
he
had
passed
that
morning
on
the
Znaim
road
seven
*NL*
miles
away
from
the
French
.
At
Grunth
also
some
apprehension
and
alarm
*NL*
could
be
felt
,
but
the
nearer
Prince
Andrew
came
to
the
French
lines
the
*NL*
more
confident
was
the
appearance
of
our
troops
.
The
soldiers
in
their
*NL*
greatcoats
were
ranged
in
lines
,
the
sergeants
major
and
company
*NL*
officers
were
counting
the
men
,
poking
the
last
man
in
each
section
in
*NL*
the
ribs
and
telling
him
to
hold
his
hand
up
.
Soldiers
scattered
over
*NL*
the
whole
place
were
dragging
logs
and
brushwood
and
were
building
*NL*
shelters
with
merry
chatter
and
laughter
;
around
the
fires
sat
others
,
*NL*
dressed
and
undressed
,
drying
their
shirts
and
leg
bands
or
mending
*NL*
boots
or
overcoats
and
crowding
round
the
boilers
and
porridge
cookers
.
*NL*
In
one
company
dinner
was
ready
,
and
the
soldiers
were
gazing
eagerly
at
*NL*
the
steaming
boiler
,
waiting
till
the
sample
,
which
a
quartermaster
*NL*
sergeant
was
carrying
in
a
wooden
bowl
to
an
officer
who
sat
on
a
log
*NL*
before
his
shelter
,
had
been
tasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
company
,
a
lucky
one
for
not
all
the
companies
had
vodka
,
*NL*
crowded
round
a
pockmarked
,
broad-shouldered
sergeant
major
who
,
tilting
*NL*
a
keg
,
filled
one
after
another
the
canteen
lids
held
out
to
him
.
The
*NL*
soldiers
lifted
the
canteen
lids
to
their
lips
with
reverential
faces
,
*NL*
emptied
them
,
rolling
the
vodka
in
their
mouths
,
and
walked
away
from
*NL*
the
sergeant
major
with
brightened
expressions
,
licking
their
lips
and
*NL*
wiping
them
on
the
sleeves
of
their
greatcoats
.
All
their
faces
were
as
*NL*
serene
as
if
all
this
were
happening
at
home
awaiting
peaceful
*NL*
encampment
,
and
not
within
sight
of
the
enemy
before
an
action
in
which
*NL*
at
least
half
of
them
would
be
left
on
the
field
.
After
passing
a
*NL*
chasseur
regiment
and
in
the
lines
of
the
Kiev
grenadiers
--
fine
fellows
*NL*
busy
with
similar
peaceful
affairs
--
near
the
shelter
of
the
regimental
*NL*
commander
,
higher
than
and
different
from
the
others
,
Prince
Andrew
came
*NL*
out
in
front
of
a
platoon
of
grenadiers
before
whom
lay
a
naked
man
.
Two
*NL*
soldiers
held
him
while
two
others
were
flourishing
their
switches
and
*NL*
striking
him
regularly
on
his
bare
back
.
The
man
shrieked
unnaturally
.
A
*NL*
stout
major
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
line
,
and
regardless
of
the
*NL*
screams
kept
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
shame
for
a
soldier
to
steal
;
a
soldier
must
be
honest
,
*NL*
honorable
,
and
brave
,
but
if
he
robs
his
fellows
there
is
no
honor
in
*NL*
him
,
he
's
a
scoundrel
.
Go
on
!
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
swishing
sound
of
the
strokes
,
and
the
desperate
but
unnatural
*NL*
screams
,
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
go
on
!
''
said
the
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
officer
with
a
bewildered
and
pained
expression
on
his
face
*NL*
stepped
away
from
the
man
and
looked
round
inquiringly
at
the
adjutant
*NL*
as
he
rode
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
having
reached
the
front
line
,
rode
along
it
.
Our
front
*NL*
line
and
that
of
the
enemy
were
far
apart
on
the
right
and
left
flanks
,
*NL*
but
in
the
center
where
the
men
with
a
flag
of
truce
had
passed
that
*NL*
morning
,
the
lines
were
so
near
together
that
the
men
could
see
one
*NL*
another
's
faces
and
speak
to
one
another
.
Besides
the
soldiers
who
*NL*
formed
the
picket
line
on
either
side
,
there
were
many
curious
onlookers
*NL*
who
,
jesting
and
laughing
,
stared
at
their
strange
foreign
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
early
morning
--
despite
an
injunction
not
to
approach
the
picket
*NL*
line
--
the
officers
had
been
unable
to
keep
sight-seers
away
.
The
*NL*
soldiers
forming
the
picket
line
,
like
showmen
exhibiting
a
curiosity
,
*NL*
no
longer
looked
at
the
French
but
paid
attention
to
the
sight-seers
and
*NL*
grew
weary
waiting
to
be
relieved
.
Prince
Andrew
halted
to
have
a
look
*NL*
at
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Look
there
!
''
one
soldier
was
saying
to
another
,
pointing
to
a
*NL*
Russian
musketeer
who
had
gone
up
to
the
picket
line
with
an
officer
and
*NL*
was
rapidly
and
excitedly
talking
to
a
French
grenadier
.
``
Hark
to
him
*NL*
jabbering
!
Fine
,
is
n't
it
?
It
's
all
the
Frenchy
can
do
to
keep
up
with
*NL*
him
.
There
now
,
Sidorov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
and
listen
.
It
's
fine
!
''
answered
Sidorov
,
who
was
considered
*NL*
an
adept
at
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
to
whom
the
laughers
referred
was
Dolokhov
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
recognized
him
and
stopped
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
.
Dolokhov
had
*NL*
come
from
the
left
flank
where
their
regiment
was
stationed
,
with
his
*NL*
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
go
on
,
go
on
!
''
incited
the
officer
,
bending
forward
and
*NL*
trying
not
to
lose
a
word
of
the
speech
which
was
incomprehensible
to
*NL*
him
.
``
More
,
please
:
more
!
What
's
he
saying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
did
not
answer
the
captain
;
he
had
been
drawn
into
a
hot
*NL*
dispute
with
the
French
grenadier
.
They
were
naturally
talking
about
the
*NL*
campaign
.
The
Frenchman
,
confusing
the
Austrians
with
the
Russians
,
was
*NL*
trying
to
prove
that
the
Russians
had
surrendered
and
had
fled
all
the
*NL*
way
from
Ulm
,
while
Dolokhov
maintained
that
the
Russians
had
not
*NL*
surrendered
but
had
beaten
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
orders
to
drive
you
off
here
,
and
we
shall
drive
you
off
,
''
said
*NL*
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
take
care
you
and
your
Cossacks
are
not
all
captured
!
''
said
the
*NL*
French
grenadier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
onlookers
and
listeners
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
make
you
dance
as
we
did
under
Suvorov
...
,
''
*
said
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
On
vous
fera
danser
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qu
'
est-ce
qu'il
chante
?
''
*
asked
a
Frenchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
What
's
he
singing
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ancient
history
,
''
said
another
,
guessing
that
it
referred
to
a
*NL*
former
war
.
``
The
Emperor
will
teach
your
Suvara
as
he
has
taught
the
*NL*
others
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bonaparte
...
''
began
Dolokhov
,
but
the
Frenchman
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Bonaparte
.
He
is
the
Emperor
!
Sacre
nom
...
!
''
cried
he
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
skin
your
Emperor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dolokhov
swore
at
him
in
coarse
soldier
's
Russian
and
shouldering
*NL*
his
musket
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
Ivan
Lukich
,
''
he
said
to
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
the
way
to
talk
French
,
''
said
the
picket
soldiers
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
Sidorov
,
you
have
a
try
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sidorov
,
turning
to
the
French
,
winked
,
and
began
to
jabber
meaningless
*NL*
sounds
very
fast
:
``
Kari
,
mala
,
tafa
,
safi
,
muter
,
Kaska
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
trying
to
give
an
expressive
intonation
to
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
!
ho
!
ho
!
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
Ouh
!
ouh
!
''
came
peals
of
such
healthy
and
*NL*
good-humored
laughter
from
the
soldiers
that
it
infected
the
French
*NL*
involuntarily
,
so
much
so
that
the
only
thing
left
to
do
seemed
to
be
to
*NL*
unload
the
muskets
,
explode
the
ammunition
,
and
all
return
home
as
*NL*
quickly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
guns
remained
loaded
,
the
loopholes
in
blockhouses
and
*NL*
entrenchments
looked
out
just
as
menacingly
,
and
the
unlimbered
cannon
*NL*
confronted
one
another
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ridden
round
the
whole
line
from
right
flank
to
left
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
made
his
way
up
to
the
battery
from
which
the
staff
officer
had
*NL*
told
him
the
whole
field
could
be
seen
.
Here
he
dismounted
,
and
stopped
*NL*
beside
the
farthest
of
the
four
unlimbered
cannon
.
Before
the
guns
an
*NL*
artillery
sentry
was
pacing
up
and
down
;
he
stood
at
attention
when
the
*NL*
officer
arrived
,
but
at
a
sign
resumed
his
measured
,
monotonous
pacing
.
*NL*
Behind
the
guns
were
their
limbers
and
still
farther
back
picket
ropes
*NL*
and
artillerymen
's
bonfires
.
To
the
left
,
not
far
from
the
farthest
*NL*
cannon
,
was
a
small
,
newly
constructed
wattle
shed
from
which
came
the
*NL*
sound
of
officers
'
voices
in
eager
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
a
view
over
nearly
the
whole
Russian
position
and
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
enemy
's
opened
out
from
this
battery
.
Just
facing
*NL*
it
,
on
the
crest
of
the
opposite
hill
,
the
village
of
Schon
Grabern
*NL*
could
be
seen
,
and
in
three
places
to
left
and
right
the
French
troops
*NL*
amid
the
smoke
of
their
campfires
,
the
greater
part
of
whom
were
*NL*
evidently
in
the
village
itself
and
behind
the
hill
.
To
the
left
from
*NL*
that
village
,
amid
the
smoke
,
was
something
resembling
a
battery
,
but
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
see
it
clearly
with
the
naked
eye
.
Our
right
flank
was
*NL*
posted
on
a
rather
steep
incline
which
dominated
the
French
position
.
*NL*
Our
infantry
were
stationed
there
,
and
at
the
farthest
point
the
*NL*
dragoons
.
In
the
center
,
where
Tushin
's
battery
stood
and
from
which
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
surveying
the
position
,
was
the
easiest
and
most
*NL*
direct
descent
and
ascent
to
the
brook
separating
us
from
Schon
Grabern
.
*NL*
On
the
left
our
troops
were
close
to
a
copse
,
in
which
smoked
the
*NL*
bonfires
of
our
infantry
who
were
felling
wood
.
The
French
line
was
*NL*
wider
than
ours
,
and
it
was
plain
that
they
could
easily
outflank
us
on
*NL*
both
sides
.
Behind
our
position
was
a
steep
and
deep
dip
,
making
it
*NL*
difficult
for
artillery
and
cavalry
to
retire
.
Prince
Andrew
took
out
*NL*
his
notebook
and
,
leaning
on
the
cannon
,
sketched
a
plan
of
the
*NL*
position
.
He
made
some
notes
on
two
points
,
intending
to
mention
them
to
*NL*
Bagration
.
His
idea
was
,
first
,
to
concentrate
all
the
artillery
in
the
*NL*
center
,
and
secondly
,
to
withdraw
the
cavalry
to
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
dip
.
Prince
Andrew
,
being
always
near
the
commander
in
chief
,
closely
*NL*
following
the
mass
movements
and
general
orders
,
and
constantly
studying
*NL*
historical
accounts
of
battles
,
involuntarily
pictured
to
himself
the
*NL*
course
of
events
in
the
forthcoming
action
in
broad
outline
.
He
imagined
*NL*
only
important
possibilities
:
``
If
the
enemy
attacks
the
right
flank
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
``
the
Kiev
grenadiers
and
the
Podolsk
chasseurs
must
*NL*
hold
their
position
till
reserves
from
the
center
come
up
.
In
that
case
*NL*
the
dragoons
could
successfully
make
a
flank
counterattack
.
If
they
*NL*
attack
our
center
we
,
having
the
center
battery
on
this
high
ground
,
*NL*
shall
withdraw
the
left
flank
under
its
cover
,
and
retreat
to
the
dip
by
*NL*
echelons
.
''
So
he
reasoned
...
All
the
time
he
had
been
beside
the
gun
,
*NL*
he
had
heard
the
voices
of
the
officers
distinctly
,
but
as
often
happens
*NL*
had
not
understood
a
word
of
what
they
were
saying
.
Suddenly
,
however
,
*NL*
he
was
struck
by
a
voice
coming
from
the
shed
,
and
its
tone
was
so
*NL*
sincere
that
he
could
not
but
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
friend
,
''
said
a
pleasant
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew
,
a
*NL*
familiar
voice
,
``
what
I
say
is
that
if
it
were
possible
to
know
what
is
*NL*
beyond
death
,
none
of
us
would
be
afraid
of
it
.
That
's
so
,
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
,
a
younger
voice
,
interrupted
him
:
``
Afraid
or
not
,
you
ca
n't
*NL*
escape
it
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
one
is
afraid
!
Oh
,
you
clever
people
,
''
said
a
third
manly
*NL*
voice
interrupting
them
both
.
``
Of
course
you
artillery
men
are
very
*NL*
wise
,
because
you
can
take
everything
along
with
you
--
vodka
and
snacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
,
evidently
an
infantry
officer
,
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
one
is
afraid
,
''
continued
the
first
speaker
,
he
of
the
familiar
*NL*
voice
.
``
One
is
afraid
of
the
unknown
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
Whatever
we
may
*NL*
say
about
the
soul
going
to
the
sky
...
we
know
there
is
no
sky
but
only
*NL*
an
atmosphere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manly
voice
again
interrupted
the
artillery
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
stand
us
some
of
your
herb
vodka
,
Tushin
,
''
it
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
``
that
's
the
captain
who
stood
up
in
the
*NL*
sutler
's
hut
without
his
boots
.
''
He
recognized
the
agreeable
,
*NL*
philosophizing
voice
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
herb
vodka
?
Certainly
!
''
said
Tushin
.
``
But
still
,
to
conceive
a
*NL*
future
life
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
.
Just
then
there
was
a
whistle
in
the
air
;
nearer
and
*NL*
nearer
,
faster
and
louder
,
louder
and
faster
,
a
cannon
ball
,
as
if
it
*NL*
had
not
finished
saying
what
was
necessary
,
thudded
into
the
ground
near
*NL*
the
shed
with
super
human
force
,
throwing
up
a
mass
of
earth
.
The
ground
*NL*
seemed
to
groan
at
the
terrible
impact
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
immediately
Tushin
,
with
a
short
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
*NL*
his
kind
,
intelligent
face
rather
pale
,
rushed
out
of
the
shed
followed
*NL*
by
the
owner
of
the
manly
voice
,
a
dashing
infantry
officer
who
hurried
*NL*
off
to
his
company
,
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
he
ran
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Mounting
his
horse
again
Prince
Andrew
lingered
with
the
battery
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
puff
from
the
gun
that
had
sent
the
ball
.
His
eyes
ran
*NL*
rapidly
over
the
wide
space
,
but
he
only
saw
that
the
hitherto
*NL*
motionless
masses
of
the
French
now
swayed
and
that
there
really
was
a
*NL*
battery
to
their
left
.
The
smoke
above
it
had
not
yet
dispersed
.
Two
*NL*
mounted
Frenchmen
,
probably
adjutants
,
were
galloping
up
the
hill
.
A
*NL*
small
but
distinctly
visible
enemy
column
was
moving
down
the
hill
,
*NL*
probably
to
strengthen
the
front
line
.
The
smoke
of
the
first
shot
had
*NL*
not
yet
dispersed
before
another
puff
appeared
,
followed
by
a
report
.
*NL*
The
battle
had
begun
!
Prince
Andrew
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
*NL*
to
Grunth
to
find
Prince
Bagration
.
He
heard
the
cannonade
behind
him
*NL*
growing
louder
and
more
frequent
.
Evidently
our
guns
had
begun
to
reply
.
*NL*
From
the
bottom
of
the
slope
,
where
the
parleys
had
taken
place
,
came
*NL*
the
report
of
musketry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lemarrois
had
just
arrived
at
a
gallop
with
Bonaparte
's
stern
letter
,
*NL*
and
Murat
,
humiliated
and
anxious
to
expiate
his
fault
,
had
at
once
*NL*
moved
his
forces
to
attack
the
center
and
outflank
both
the
Russian
*NL*
wings
,
hoping
before
evening
and
before
the
arrival
of
the
Emperor
to
*NL*
crush
the
contemptible
detachment
that
stood
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
begun
.
Here
it
is
!
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
feeling
the
blood
*NL*
rush
to
his
heart
.
``
But
where
and
how
will
my
Toulon
present
itself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
between
the
companies
that
had
been
eating
porridge
and
drinking
*NL*
vodka
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
he
saw
everywhere
the
same
rapid
*NL*
movement
of
soldiers
forming
ranks
and
getting
their
muskets
ready
,
and
*NL*
on
all
their
faces
he
recognized
the
same
eagerness
that
filled
his
*NL*
heart
.
``
It
has
begun
!
Here
it
is
,
dreadful
but
enjoyable
!
''
was
what
the
*NL*
face
of
each
soldier
and
each
officer
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
had
reached
the
embankments
that
were
being
thrown
up
,
he
saw
,
*NL*
in
the
light
of
the
dull
autumn
evening
,
mounted
men
coming
toward
him
.
*NL*
The
foremost
,
wearing
a
Cossack
cloak
and
lambskin
cap
and
riding
a
*NL*
white
horse
,
was
Prince
Bagration
.
Prince
Andrew
stopped
,
waiting
for
*NL*
him
to
come
up
;
Prince
Bagration
reined
in
his
horse
and
recognizing
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
nodded
to
him
.
He
still
looked
ahead
while
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
told
him
what
he
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feeling
,
``
It
has
begun
!
Here
it
is
!
''
was
seen
even
on
Prince
*NL*
Bagration
's
hard
brown
face
with
its
half-closed
,
dull
,
sleepy
eyes
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
gazed
with
anxious
curiosity
at
that
impassive
face
and
*NL*
wished
he
could
tell
what
,
if
anything
,
this
man
was
thinking
and
*NL*
feeling
at
that
moment
.
``
Is
there
anything
at
all
behind
that
impassive
*NL*
face
?
''
Prince
Andrew
asked
himself
as
he
looked
.
Prince
Bagration
bent
*NL*
his
head
in
sign
of
agreement
with
what
Prince
Andrew
told
him
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Very
good
!
''
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
imply
that
everything
that
*NL*
took
place
and
was
reported
to
him
was
exactly
what
he
had
foreseen
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
out
of
breath
with
his
rapid
ride
,
spoke
quickly
.
Prince
*NL*
Bagration
,
uttering
his
words
with
an
Oriental
accent
,
spoke
*NL*
particularly
slowly
,
as
if
to
impress
the
fact
that
there
was
no
need
to
*NL*
hurry
.
However
,
he
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
in
the
direction
of
Tushin
's
*NL*
battery
.
Prince
Andrew
followed
with
the
suite
.
Behind
Prince
Bagration
*NL*
rode
an
officer
of
the
suite
,
the
prince
's
personal
adjutant
,
Zherkov
,
*NL*
an
orderly
officer
,
the
staff
officer
on
duty
,
riding
a
fine
bobtailed
*NL*
horse
,
and
a
civilian
--
an
accountant
who
had
asked
permission
to
be
*NL*
present
at
the
battle
out
of
curiosity
.
The
accountant
,
a
stout
,
full
-
*NL*
faced
man
,
looked
around
him
with
a
naive
smile
of
satisfaction
and
*NL*
presented
a
strange
appearance
among
the
hussars
,
Cossacks
,
and
*NL*
adjutants
,
in
his
camlet
coat
,
as
he
jolted
on
his
horse
with
a
convoy
*NL*
officer
's
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
see
a
battle
,
''
said
Zherkov
to
Bolkonski
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
accountant
,
``
but
he
feels
a
pain
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
leave
off
!
''
said
the
accountant
with
a
beaming
but
rather
cunning
*NL*
smile
,
as
if
flattered
at
being
made
the
subject
of
Zherkov
's
joke
,
and
*NL*
purposely
trying
to
appear
stupider
than
he
really
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
strange
,
mon
Monsieur
Prince
,
''
said
the
staff
officer
.
-LRB-
He
*NL*
remembered
that
in
French
there
is
some
peculiar
way
of
addressing
a
*NL*
prince
,
but
could
not
get
it
quite
right
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
they
were
all
approaching
Tushin
's
battery
,
and
a
ball
*NL*
struck
the
ground
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
that
has
fallen
?
''
asked
the
accountant
with
a
naive
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
French
pancake
,
''
answered
Zherkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
what
they
hit
with
?
''
asked
the
accountant
.
``
How
awful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
swell
with
satisfaction
.
He
had
hardly
finished
speaking
*NL*
when
they
again
heard
an
unexpectedly
violent
whistling
which
suddenly
*NL*
ended
with
a
thud
into
something
soft
...
f-f-flop
!
and
a
Cossack
,
riding
*NL*
a
little
to
their
right
and
behind
the
accountant
,
crashed
to
earth
with
*NL*
his
horse
.
Zherkov
and
the
staff
officer
bent
over
their
saddles
and
*NL*
turned
their
horses
away
.
The
accountant
stopped
,
facing
the
Cossack
,
*NL*
and
examined
him
with
attentive
curiosity
.
The
Cossack
was
dead
,
but
the
*NL*
horse
still
struggled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
looked
round
,
and
,
seeing
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
confusion
,
turned
away
with
indifference
,
as
if
to
say
,
``
Is
*NL*
it
worth
while
noticing
trifles
?
''
He
reined
in
his
horse
with
the
care
*NL*
of
a
skillful
rider
and
,
slightly
bending
over
,
disengaged
his
saber
*NL*
which
had
caught
in
his
cloak
.
It
was
an
old-fashioned
saber
of
a
kind
*NL*
no
longer
in
general
use
.
Prince
Andrew
remembered
the
story
of
Suvorov
*NL*
giving
his
saber
to
Bagration
in
Italy
,
and
the
recollection
was
*NL*
particularly
pleasant
at
that
moment
.
They
had
reached
the
battery
at
*NL*
which
Prince
Andrew
had
been
when
he
examined
the
battlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
company
?
''
asked
Prince
Bagration
of
an
artilleryman
standing
by
*NL*
the
ammunition
wagon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
,
``
Whose
company
?
''
but
he
really
meant
,
``
Are
you
frightened
*NL*
here
?
''
and
the
artilleryman
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Tushin
's
,
your
excellency
!
''
shouted
the
red-haired
,
freckled
*NL*
gunner
in
a
merry
voice
,
standing
to
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
muttered
Bagration
as
if
considering
something
,
and
he
rode
*NL*
past
the
limbers
to
the
farthest
cannon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
,
a
ringing
shot
issued
from
it
deafening
him
and
his
*NL*
suite
,
and
in
the
smoke
that
suddenly
surrounded
the
gun
they
could
see
*NL*
the
gunners
who
had
seized
it
straining
to
roll
it
quickly
back
to
its
*NL*
former
position
.
A
huge
,
broad-shouldered
gunner
,
Number
One
,
holding
a
*NL*
mop
,
his
legs
far
apart
,
sprang
to
the
wheel
;
while
Number
Two
with
a
*NL*
trembling
hand
placed
a
charge
in
the
cannon
's
mouth
.
The
short
,
round
-
*NL*
shouldered
Captain
Tushin
,
stumbling
over
the
tail
of
the
gun
carriage
,
*NL*
moved
forward
and
,
not
noticing
the
general
,
looked
out
shading
his
eyes
*NL*
with
his
small
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lift
it
two
lines
more
and
it
will
be
just
right
,
''
cried
he
in
a
feeble
*NL*
voice
to
which
he
tried
to
impart
a
dashing
note
,
ill-suited
to
his
weak
*NL*
figure
.
``
Number
Two
!
''
he
squeaked
.
``
Fire
,
Medvedev
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
called
to
him
,
and
Tushin
,
raising
three
fingers
to
his
cap
*NL*
with
a
bashful
and
awkward
gesture
not
at
all
like
a
military
salute
but
*NL*
like
a
priest
's
benediction
,
approached
the
general
.
Though
Tushin
's
*NL*
guns
had
been
intended
to
cannonade
the
valley
,
he
was
firing
incendiary
*NL*
balls
at
the
village
of
Schon
Grabern
visible
just
opposite
,
in
front
of
*NL*
which
large
masses
of
French
were
advancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
had
given
Tushin
orders
where
and
at
what
to
fire
,
but
after
*NL*
consulting
his
sergeant
major
,
Zakharchenko
,
for
whom
he
had
great
*NL*
respect
,
he
had
decided
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
set
fire
to
the
*NL*
village
.
``
Very
good
!
''
said
Bagration
in
reply
to
the
officer
's
report
,
*NL*
and
began
deliberately
to
examine
the
whole
battlefield
extended
before
*NL*
him
.
The
French
had
advanced
nearest
on
our
right
.
Below
the
height
on
*NL*
which
the
Kiev
regiment
was
stationed
,
in
the
hollow
where
the
rivulet
*NL*
flowed
,
the
soul-stirring
rolling
and
crackling
of
musketry
was
heard
,
*NL*
and
much
farther
to
the
right
beyond
the
dragoons
,
the
officer
of
the
*NL*
suite
pointed
out
to
Bagration
a
French
column
that
was
outflanking
us
.
*NL*
To
the
left
the
horizon
bounded
by
the
adjacent
wood
.
Prince
Bagration
*NL*
ordered
two
battalions
from
the
center
to
be
sent
to
reinforce
the
right
*NL*
flank
.
The
officer
of
the
suite
ventured
to
remark
to
the
prince
that
if
*NL*
these
battalions
went
away
,
the
guns
would
remain
without
support
.
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
turned
to
the
officer
and
with
his
dull
eyes
looked
at
*NL*
him
in
silence
.
It
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew
that
the
officer
's
remark
was
*NL*
just
and
that
really
no
answer
could
be
made
to
it
.
But
at
that
moment
*NL*
an
adjutant
galloped
up
with
a
message
from
the
commander
of
the
*NL*
regiment
in
the
hollow
and
news
that
immense
masses
of
the
French
were
*NL*
coming
down
upon
them
and
that
his
regiment
was
in
disorder
and
was
*NL*
retreating
upon
the
Kiev
grenadiers
.
Prince
Bagration
bowed
his
head
in
*NL*
sign
of
assent
and
approval
.
He
rode
off
at
a
walk
to
the
right
and
sent
*NL*
an
adjutant
to
the
dragoons
with
orders
to
attack
the
French
.
But
this
*NL*
adjutant
returned
half
an
hour
later
with
the
news
that
the
commander
of
*NL*
the
dragoons
had
already
retreated
beyond
the
dip
in
the
ground
,
as
a
*NL*
heavy
fire
had
been
opened
on
him
and
he
was
losing
men
uselessly
,
and
*NL*
so
had
hastened
to
throw
some
sharpshooters
into
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
!
''
said
Bagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
leaving
the
battery
,
firing
was
heard
on
the
left
also
,
and
as
*NL*
it
was
too
far
to
the
left
flank
for
him
to
have
time
to
go
there
*NL*
himself
,
Prince
Bagration
sent
Zherkov
to
tell
the
general
in
command
*NL*
-LRB-
the
one
who
had
paraded
his
regiment
before
Kutuzov
at
Braunau
-RRB-
that
he
*NL*
must
retreat
as
quickly
as
possible
behind
the
hollow
in
the
rear
,
as
*NL*
the
right
flank
would
probably
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
enemy
's
*NL*
attack
very
long
.
About
Tushin
and
the
battalion
that
had
been
in
*NL*
support
of
his
battery
all
was
forgotten
.
Prince
Andrew
listened
*NL*
attentively
to
Bagration
's
colloquies
with
the
commanding
officers
and
*NL*
the
orders
he
gave
them
and
,
to
his
surprise
,
found
that
no
orders
were
*NL*
really
given
,
but
that
Prince
Bagration
tried
to
make
it
appear
that
*NL*
everything
done
by
necessity
,
by
accident
,
or
by
the
will
of
subordinate
*NL*
commanders
was
done
,
if
not
by
his
direct
command
,
at
least
in
accord
*NL*
with
his
intentions
.
Prince
Andrew
noticed
,
however
,
that
though
what
*NL*
happened
was
due
to
chance
and
was
independent
of
the
commander
's
will
,
*NL*
owing
to
the
tact
Bagration
showed
,
his
presence
was
very
valuable
.
*NL*
Officers
who
approached
him
with
disturbed
countenances
became
calm
;
*NL*
soldiers
and
officers
greeted
him
gaily
,
grew
more
cheerful
in
his
*NL*
presence
,
and
were
evidently
anxious
to
display
their
courage
before
*NL*
him
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
,
having
reached
the
highest
point
of
our
right
flank
,
*NL*
began
riding
downhill
to
where
the
roll
of
musketry
was
heard
but
where
*NL*
on
account
of
the
smoke
nothing
could
be
seen
.
The
nearer
they
got
to
*NL*
the
hollow
the
less
they
could
see
but
the
more
they
felt
the
nearness
*NL*
of
the
actual
battlefield
.
They
began
to
meet
wounded
men
.
One
with
a
*NL*
bleeding
head
and
no
cap
was
being
dragged
along
by
two
soldiers
who
*NL*
supported
him
under
the
arms
.
There
was
a
gurgle
in
his
throat
and
he
*NL*
was
spitting
blood
.
A
bullet
had
evidently
hit
him
in
the
throat
or
*NL*
mouth
.
Another
was
walking
sturdily
by
himself
but
without
his
musket
,
*NL*
groaning
aloud
and
swinging
his
arm
which
had
just
been
hurt
,
while
*NL*
blood
from
it
was
streaming
over
his
greatcoat
as
from
a
bottle
.
He
had
*NL*
that
moment
been
wounded
and
his
face
showed
fear
rather
than
suffering
.
*NL*
Crossing
a
road
they
descended
a
steep
incline
and
saw
several
men
lying
*NL*
on
the
ground
;
they
also
met
a
crowd
of
soldiers
some
of
whom
were
*NL*
unwounded
.
The
soldiers
were
ascending
the
hill
breathing
heavily
,
and
*NL*
despite
the
general
's
presence
were
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
.
In
*NL*
front
of
them
rows
of
gray
cloaks
were
already
visible
through
the
*NL*
smoke
,
and
an
officer
catching
sight
of
Bagration
rushed
shouting
after
*NL*
the
crowd
of
retreating
soldiers
,
ordering
them
back
.
Bagration
rode
up
*NL*
to
the
ranks
along
which
shots
crackled
now
here
and
now
there
,
drowning
*NL*
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
shouts
of
command
.
The
whole
air
reeked
with
*NL*
smoke
.
The
excited
faces
of
the
soldiers
were
blackened
with
it
.
Some
*NL*
were
using
their
ramrods
,
others
putting
powder
on
the
touchpans
or
*NL*
taking
charges
from
their
pouches
,
while
others
were
firing
,
though
who
*NL*
they
were
firing
at
could
not
be
seen
for
the
smoke
which
there
was
no
*NL*
wind
to
carry
away
.
A
pleasant
humming
and
whistling
of
bullets
were
*NL*
often
heard
.
``
What
is
this
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
approaching
the
crowd
*NL*
of
soldiers
.
``
It
ca
n't
be
an
attack
,
for
they
are
not
moving
;
it
ca
n't
*NL*
be
a
square
--
for
they
are
not
drawn
up
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
regiment
,
a
thin
,
feeble-looking
old
man
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
smile
--
his
eyelids
drooping
more
than
half
over
his
old
eyes
,
*NL*
giving
him
a
mild
expression
,
rode
up
to
Bagration
and
welcomed
him
as
a
*NL*
host
welcomes
an
honored
guest
.
He
reported
that
his
regiment
had
been
*NL*
attacked
by
French
cavalry
and
that
,
though
the
attack
had
been
*NL*
repulsed
,
he
had
lost
more
than
half
his
men
.
He
said
the
attack
had
*NL*
been
repulsed
,
employing
this
military
term
to
describe
what
had
*NL*
occurred
to
his
regiment
,
but
in
reality
he
did
not
himself
know
what
*NL*
had
happened
during
that
half-hour
to
the
troops
entrusted
to
him
,
and
*NL*
could
not
say
with
certainty
whether
the
attack
had
been
repulsed
or
his
*NL*
regiment
had
been
broken
up
.
All
he
knew
was
that
at
the
commencement
of
*NL*
the
action
balls
and
shells
began
flying
all
over
his
regiment
and
*NL*
hitting
men
and
that
afterwards
someone
had
shouted
``
Cavalry
!
''
and
our
*NL*
men
had
begun
firing
.
They
were
still
firing
,
not
at
the
cavalry
which
*NL*
had
disappeared
,
but
at
French
infantry
who
had
come
into
the
hollow
and
*NL*
were
firing
at
our
men
.
Prince
Bagration
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
that
*NL*
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
desired
and
expected
.
Turning
to
his
*NL*
adjutant
he
ordered
him
to
bring
down
the
two
battalions
of
the
Sixth
*NL*
Chasseurs
whom
they
had
just
passed
.
Prince
Andrew
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
changed
expression
on
Prince
Bagration
's
face
at
this
moment
.
It
*NL*
expressed
the
concentrated
and
happy
resolution
you
see
on
the
face
of
a
*NL*
man
who
on
a
hot
day
takes
a
final
run
before
plunging
into
the
water
.
*NL*
The
dull
,
sleepy
expression
was
no
longer
there
,
nor
the
affectation
of
*NL*
profound
thought
.
The
round
,
steady
,
hawk
's
eyes
looked
before
him
*NL*
eagerly
and
rather
disdainfully
,
not
resting
on
anything
although
his
*NL*
movements
were
still
slow
and
measured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
regiment
turned
to
Prince
Bagration
,
entreating
him
*NL*
to
go
back
as
it
was
too
dangerous
to
remain
where
they
were
.
``
Please
,
*NL*
your
excellency
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
he
kept
saying
,
glancing
for
support
*NL*
at
an
officer
of
the
suite
who
turned
away
from
him
.
``
There
,
you
see
!
''
*NL*
and
he
drew
attention
to
the
bullets
whistling
,
singing
,
and
hissing
*NL*
continually
around
them
.
He
spoke
in
the
tone
of
entreaty
and
reproach
*NL*
that
a
carpenter
uses
to
a
gentleman
who
has
picked
up
an
ax
:
``
We
are
*NL*
used
to
it
,
but
you
,
sir
,
will
blister
your
hands
.
''
He
spoke
as
if
those
*NL*
bullets
could
not
kill
him
,
and
his
half-closed
eyes
gave
still
more
*NL*
persuasiveness
to
his
words
.
The
staff
officer
joined
in
the
colonel
's
*NL*
appeals
,
but
Bagration
did
not
reply
;
he
only
gave
an
order
to
cease
*NL*
firing
and
re-form
,
so
as
to
give
room
for
the
two
approaching
*NL*
battalions
.
While
he
was
speaking
,
the
curtain
of
smoke
that
had
*NL*
concealed
the
hollow
,
driven
by
a
rising
wind
,
began
to
move
from
right
*NL*
to
left
as
if
drawn
by
an
invisible
hand
,
and
the
hill
opposite
,
with
*NL*
the
French
moving
about
on
it
,
opened
out
before
them
.
All
eyes
fastened
*NL*
involuntarily
on
this
French
column
advancing
against
them
and
winding
*NL*
down
over
the
uneven
ground
.
One
could
already
see
the
soldiers
'
shaggy
*NL*
caps
,
distinguish
the
officers
from
the
men
,
and
see
the
standard
*NL*
flapping
against
its
staff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
march
splendidly
,
''
remarked
someone
in
Bagration
's
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
of
the
column
had
already
descended
into
the
hollow
.
The
clash
*NL*
would
take
place
on
this
side
of
it
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
remains
of
our
regiment
which
had
been
in
action
rapidly
formed
up
*NL*
and
moved
to
the
right
;
from
behind
it
,
dispersing
the
laggards
,
came
*NL*
two
battalions
of
the
Sixth
Chasseurs
in
fine
order
.
Before
they
had
*NL*
reached
Bagration
,
the
weighty
tread
of
the
mass
of
men
marching
in
step
*NL*
could
be
heard
.
On
their
left
flank
,
nearest
to
Bagration
,
marched
a
*NL*
company
commander
,
a
fine
round-faced
man
,
with
a
stupid
and
happy
*NL*
expression
--
the
same
man
who
had
rushed
out
of
the
wattle
shed
.
At
that
*NL*
moment
he
was
clearly
thinking
of
nothing
but
how
dashing
a
fellow
he
*NL*
would
appear
as
he
passed
the
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
self-satisfaction
of
a
man
on
parade
,
he
stepped
lightly
with
*NL*
his
muscular
legs
as
if
sailing
along
,
stretching
himself
to
his
full
*NL*
height
without
the
smallest
effort
,
his
ease
contrasting
with
the
heavy
*NL*
tread
of
the
soldiers
who
were
keeping
step
with
him
.
He
carried
close
*NL*
to
his
leg
a
narrow
unsheathed
sword
-LRB-
small
,
curved
,
and
not
like
a
real
*NL*
weapon
-RRB-
and
looked
now
at
the
superior
officers
and
now
back
at
the
men
*NL*
without
losing
step
,
his
whole
powerful
body
turning
flexibly
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
all
the
powers
of
his
soul
were
concentrated
on
passing
the
commander
*NL*
in
the
best
possible
manner
,
and
feeling
that
he
was
doing
it
well
he
*NL*
was
happy
.
``
Left
...
left
...
left
...
''
he
seemed
to
repeat
to
himself
at
*NL*
each
alternate
step
;
and
in
time
to
this
,
with
stern
but
varied
faces
,
*NL*
the
wall
of
soldiers
burdened
with
knapsacks
and
muskets
marched
in
*NL*
step
,
and
each
one
of
these
hundreds
of
soldiers
seemed
to
be
repeating
*NL*
to
himself
at
each
alternate
step
,
``
Left
...
left
...
left
...
''
A
fat
major
*NL*
skirted
a
bush
,
puffing
and
falling
out
of
step
;
a
soldier
who
had
*NL*
fallen
behind
,
his
face
showing
alarm
at
his
defection
,
ran
at
a
trot
,
*NL*
panting
to
catch
up
with
his
company
.
A
cannon
ball
,
cleaving
the
air
,
*NL*
flew
over
the
heads
of
Bagration
and
his
suite
,
and
fell
into
the
column
*NL*
to
the
measure
of
``
Left
...
left
!
''
``
Close
up
!
''
came
the
company
*NL*
commander
's
voice
in
jaunty
tones
.
The
soldiers
passed
in
a
semicircle
*NL*
round
something
where
the
ball
had
fallen
,
and
an
old
trooper
on
the
*NL*
flank
,
a
noncommissioned
officer
who
had
stopped
beside
the
dead
men
,
*NL*
ran
to
catch
up
his
line
and
,
falling
into
step
with
a
hop
,
looked
back
*NL*
angrily
,
and
through
the
ominous
silence
and
the
regular
tramp
of
feet
*NL*
beating
the
ground
in
unison
,
one
seemed
to
hear
left
...
left
...
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
lads
!
''
said
Prince
Bagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
do
our
best
,
your
ex
`
len-lency
!
''
came
a
confused
shout
from
the
*NL*
ranks
.
A
morose
soldier
marching
on
the
left
turned
his
eyes
on
*NL*
Bagration
as
he
shouted
,
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
say
:
``
We
know
*NL*
that
ourselves
!
''
Another
,
without
looking
round
,
as
though
fearing
to
*NL*
relax
,
shouted
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
was
given
to
halt
and
down
knapsacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
rode
round
the
ranks
that
had
marched
past
him
and
dismounted
.
*NL*
He
gave
the
reins
to
a
Cossack
,
took
off
and
handed
over
his
felt
coat
,
*NL*
stretched
his
legs
,
and
set
his
cap
straight
.
The
head
of
the
French
*NL*
column
,
with
its
officers
leading
,
appeared
from
below
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forward
,
with
God
!
''
said
Bagration
,
in
a
resolute
,
sonorous
voice
,
*NL*
turning
for
a
moment
to
the
front
line
,
and
slightly
swinging
his
arms
,
*NL*
he
went
forward
uneasily
over
the
rough
field
with
the
awkward
gait
of
a
*NL*
cavalryman
.
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
an
invisible
power
was
leading
him
*NL*
forward
,
and
experienced
great
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
were
already
near
.
Prince
Andrew
,
walking
beside
Bagration
,
*NL*
could
clearly
distinguish
their
bandoliers
,
red
epaulets
,
and
even
their
*NL*
faces
.
-LRB-
He
distinctly
saw
an
old
French
officer
who
,
with
gaitered
legs
*NL*
and
turned-out
toes
,
climbed
the
hill
with
difficulty
.
-RRB-
Prince
Bagration
*NL*
gave
no
further
orders
and
silently
continued
to
walk
on
in
front
of
the
*NL*
ranks
.
Suddenly
one
shot
after
another
rang
out
from
the
French
,
smoke
*NL*
appeared
all
along
their
uneven
ranks
,
and
musket
shots
sounded
.
Several
*NL*
of
our
men
fell
,
among
them
the
round-faced
officer
who
had
marched
so
*NL*
gaily
and
complacently
.
But
at
the
moment
the
first
report
was
heard
,
*NL*
Bagration
looked
round
and
shouted
,
``
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
--
ah
!
--
ah
!
''
rang
a
long-drawn
shout
from
our
ranks
,
and
passing
*NL*
Bagration
and
racing
one
another
they
rushed
in
an
irregular
but
joyous
*NL*
and
eager
crowd
down
the
hill
at
their
disordered
foe
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
The
attack
of
the
Sixth
Chasseurs
secured
the
retreat
of
our
right
*NL*
flank
.
In
the
center
Tushin
's
forgotten
battery
,
which
had
managed
to
*NL*
set
fire
to
the
Schon
Grabern
village
,
delayed
the
French
advance
.
The
*NL*
French
were
putting
out
the
fire
which
the
wind
was
spreading
,
and
thus
*NL*
gave
us
time
to
retreat
.
The
retirement
of
the
center
to
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
dip
in
the
ground
at
the
rear
was
hurried
and
noisy
,
but
the
*NL*
different
companies
did
not
get
mixed
.
But
our
left
--
which
consisted
of
*NL*
the
Azov
and
Podolsk
infantry
and
the
Pavlograd
hussars
--
was
*NL*
simultaneously
attacked
and
outflanked
by
superior
French
forces
under
*NL*
Lannes
and
was
thrown
into
confusion
.
Bagration
had
sent
Zherkov
to
the
*NL*
general
commanding
that
left
flank
with
orders
to
retreat
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zherkov
,
not
removing
his
hand
from
his
cap
,
turned
his
horse
about
and
*NL*
galloped
off
.
But
no
sooner
had
he
left
Bagration
than
his
courage
*NL*
failed
him
.
He
was
seized
by
panic
and
could
not
go
where
it
was
*NL*
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
reached
the
left
flank
,
instead
of
going
to
the
front
where
the
*NL*
firing
was
,
he
began
to
look
for
the
general
and
his
staff
where
they
*NL*
could
not
possibly
be
,
and
so
did
not
deliver
the
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
command
of
the
left
flank
belonged
by
seniority
to
the
commander
of
*NL*
the
regiment
Kutuzov
had
reviewed
at
Braunau
and
in
which
Dolokhov
was
*NL*
serving
as
a
private
.
But
the
command
of
the
extreme
left
flank
had
been
*NL*
assigned
to
the
commander
of
the
Pavlograd
regiment
in
which
Rostov
was
*NL*
serving
,
and
a
misunderstanding
arose
.
The
two
commanders
were
much
*NL*
exasperated
with
one
another
and
,
long
after
the
action
had
begun
on
the
*NL*
right
flank
and
the
French
were
already
advancing
,
were
engaged
in
*NL*
discussion
with
the
sole
object
of
offending
one
another
.
But
the
*NL*
regiments
,
both
cavalry
and
infantry
,
were
by
no
means
ready
for
the
*NL*
impending
action
.
From
privates
to
general
they
were
not
expecting
a
*NL*
battle
and
were
engaged
in
peaceful
occupations
,
the
cavalry
feeding
the
*NL*
horses
and
the
infantry
collecting
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
higher
iss
dan
I
in
rank
,
''
said
the
German
colonel
of
the
hussars
,
*NL*
flushing
and
addressing
an
adjutant
who
had
ridden
up
,
``
so
let
him
do
*NL*
what
he
vill
,
but
I
can
not
sacrifice
my
hussars
...
Bugler
,
sount
ze
*NL*
retreat
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
haste
was
becoming
imperative
.
Cannon
and
musketry
,
mingling
*NL*
together
,
thundered
on
the
right
and
in
the
center
,
while
the
capotes
of
*NL*
Lannes
'
sharpshooters
were
already
seen
crossing
the
milldam
and
forming
*NL*
up
within
twice
the
range
of
a
musket
shot
.
The
general
in
command
of
*NL*
the
infantry
went
toward
his
horse
with
jerky
steps
,
and
having
mounted
*NL*
drew
himself
up
very
straight
and
tall
and
rode
to
the
Pavlograd
*NL*
commander
.
The
commanders
met
with
polite
bows
but
with
secret
*NL*
malevolence
in
their
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
again
,
Colonel
,
''
said
the
general
,
``
I
ca
n't
leave
half
my
men
in
*NL*
the
wood
.
I
beg
of
you
,
I
beg
of
you
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
to
occupy
the
*NL*
position
and
prepare
for
an
attack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
peg
of
you
yourself
not
to
mix
in
vot
is
not
your
business
!
''
suddenly
*NL*
replied
the
irate
colonel
.
``
If
you
vere
in
the
cavalry
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
in
the
cavalry
,
Colonel
,
but
I
am
a
Russian
general
and
if
you
*NL*
are
not
aware
of
the
fact
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
avare
,
your
excellency
,
''
suddenly
shouted
the
colonel
,
touching
*NL*
his
horse
and
turning
purple
in
the
face
.
``
Vill
you
be
so
goot
to
come
*NL*
to
ze
front
and
see
dat
zis
position
iss
no
goot
?
I
do
n't
vish
to
*NL*
destroy
my
men
for
your
pleasure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
yourself
,
Colonel
.
I
am
not
considering
my
own
pleasure
and
*NL*
I
wo
n't
allow
it
to
be
said
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
colonel
's
outburst
as
a
challenge
to
his
courage
,
the
general
*NL*
expanded
his
chest
and
rode
,
frowning
,
beside
him
to
the
front
line
,
as
*NL*
if
their
differences
would
be
settled
there
amongst
the
bullets
.
They
*NL*
reached
the
front
,
several
bullets
sped
over
them
,
and
they
halted
in
*NL*
silence
.
There
was
nothing
fresh
to
be
seen
from
the
line
,
for
from
*NL*
where
they
had
been
before
it
had
been
evident
that
it
was
impossible
*NL*
for
cavalry
to
act
among
the
bushes
and
broken
ground
,
as
well
as
that
*NL*
the
French
were
outflanking
our
left
.
The
general
and
colonel
looked
*NL*
sternly
and
significantly
at
one
another
like
two
fighting
cocks
*NL*
preparing
for
battle
,
each
vainly
trying
to
detect
signs
of
cowardice
in
*NL*
the
other
.
Both
passed
the
examination
successfully
.
As
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
said
,
and
neither
wished
to
give
occasion
for
it
to
be
*NL*
alleged
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
leave
the
range
of
fire
,
they
*NL*
would
have
remained
there
for
a
long
time
testing
each
other
's
courage
*NL*
had
it
not
been
that
just
then
they
heard
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
a
*NL*
muffled
shout
almost
behind
them
in
the
wood
.
The
French
had
attacked
*NL*
the
men
collecting
wood
in
the
copse
.
It
was
no
longer
possible
for
the
*NL*
hussars
to
retreat
with
the
infantry
.
They
were
cut
off
from
the
line
of
*NL*
retreat
on
the
left
by
the
French
.
However
inconvenient
the
position
,
it
*NL*
was
now
necessary
to
attack
in
order
to
cut
a
way
through
for
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squadron
in
which
Rostov
was
serving
had
scarcely
time
to
mount
*NL*
before
it
was
halted
facing
the
enemy
.
Again
,
as
at
the
Enns
bridge
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
between
the
squadron
and
the
enemy
,
and
again
that
*NL*
terrible
dividing
line
of
uncertainty
and
fear
--
resembling
the
line
*NL*
separating
the
living
from
the
dead
--
lay
between
them
.
All
were
*NL*
conscious
of
this
unseen
line
,
and
the
question
whether
they
would
cross
*NL*
it
or
not
,
and
how
they
would
cross
it
,
agitated
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
rode
to
the
front
,
angrily
gave
some
reply
to
questions
put
*NL*
to
him
by
the
officers
,
and
,
like
a
man
desperately
insisting
on
having
*NL*
his
own
way
,
gave
an
order
.
No
one
said
anything
definite
,
but
the
rumor
*NL*
of
an
attack
spread
through
the
squadron
.
The
command
to
form
up
rang
*NL*
out
and
the
sabers
whizzed
as
they
were
drawn
from
their
scabbards
.
*NL*
Still
no
one
moved
.
The
troops
of
the
left
flank
,
infantry
and
hussars
*NL*
alike
,
felt
that
the
commander
did
not
himself
know
what
to
do
,
and
this
*NL*
irresolution
communicated
itself
to
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
they
would
be
quick
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
feeling
that
at
last
the
*NL*
time
had
come
to
experience
the
joy
of
an
attack
of
which
he
had
so
*NL*
often
heard
from
his
fellow
hussars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fo
`
ward
,
with
God
,
lads
!
''
rang
out
Denisov
's
voice
.
``
At
a
twot
*NL*
fo
`
ward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
'
croups
began
to
sway
in
the
front
line
.
Rook
pulled
at
the
*NL*
reins
and
started
of
his
own
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
him
,
on
the
right
,
Rostov
saw
the
front
lines
of
his
hussars
and
*NL*
still
farther
ahead
a
dark
line
which
he
could
not
see
distinctly
but
*NL*
took
to
be
the
enemy
.
Shots
could
be
heard
,
but
some
way
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faster
!
''
came
the
word
of
command
,
and
Rostov
felt
Rook
's
flanks
*NL*
drooping
as
he
broke
into
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
anticipated
his
horse
's
movements
and
became
more
and
more
*NL*
elated
.
He
had
noticed
a
solitary
tree
ahead
of
him
.
This
tree
had
been
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
line
that
had
seemed
so
terrible
--
and
now
he
had
*NL*
crossed
that
line
and
not
only
was
there
nothing
terrible
,
but
*NL*
everything
was
becoming
more
and
more
happy
and
animated
.
``
Oh
,
how
I
*NL*
will
slash
at
him
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
gripping
the
hilt
of
his
saber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hur-a-a-a-ah
!
''
came
a
roar
of
voices
.
``
Let
anyone
come
my
way
now
,
''
*NL*
thought
Rostov
driving
his
spurs
into
Rook
and
letting
him
go
at
a
full
*NL*
gallop
so
that
he
outstripped
the
others
.
Ahead
,
the
enemy
was
already
*NL*
visible
.
Suddenly
something
like
a
birch
broom
seemed
to
sweep
over
the
*NL*
squadron
.
Rostov
raised
his
saber
,
ready
to
strike
,
but
at
that
instant
*NL*
the
trooper
Nikitenko
,
who
was
galloping
ahead
,
shot
away
from
him
,
and
*NL*
Rostov
felt
as
in
a
dream
that
he
continued
to
be
carried
forward
with
*NL*
unnatural
speed
but
yet
stayed
on
the
same
spot
.
From
behind
him
*NL*
Bondarchuk
,
an
hussar
he
knew
,
jolted
against
him
and
looked
angrily
at
*NL*
him
.
Bondarchuk
's
horse
swerved
and
galloped
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
I
am
not
moving
?
I
have
fallen
,
I
am
killed
!
''
Rostov
asked
*NL*
and
answered
at
the
same
instant
.
He
was
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
field
.
*NL*
Instead
of
the
moving
horses
and
hussars
'
backs
,
he
saw
nothing
before
*NL*
him
but
the
motionless
earth
and
the
stubble
around
him
.
There
was
warm
*NL*
blood
under
his
arm
.
``
No
,
I
am
wounded
and
the
horse
is
killed
.
''
Rook
*NL*
tried
to
rise
on
his
forelegs
but
fell
back
,
pinning
his
rider
's
leg
.
*NL*
Blood
was
flowing
from
his
head
;
he
struggled
but
could
not
rise
.
Rostov
*NL*
also
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
,
his
sabretache
having
become
entangled
*NL*
in
the
saddle
.
Where
our
men
were
,
and
where
the
French
,
he
did
not
*NL*
know
.
There
was
no
one
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
disentangled
his
leg
,
he
rose
.
``
Where
,
on
which
side
,
was
now
the
*NL*
line
that
had
so
sharply
divided
the
two
armies
?
''
he
asked
himself
and
*NL*
could
not
answer
.
``
Can
something
bad
have
happened
to
me
?
''
he
wondered
*NL*
as
he
got
up
:
and
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
something
superfluous
was
*NL*
hanging
on
his
benumbed
left
arm
.
The
wrist
felt
as
if
it
were
not
his
.
*NL*
He
examined
his
hand
carefully
,
vainly
trying
to
find
blood
on
it
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
here
are
people
coming
,
''
he
thought
joyfully
,
seeing
some
men
running
*NL*
toward
him
.
``
They
will
help
me
!
''
In
front
came
a
man
wearing
a
strange
*NL*
shako
and
a
blue
cloak
,
swarthy
,
sunburned
,
and
with
a
hooked
nose
.
Then
*NL*
came
two
more
,
and
many
more
running
behind
.
One
of
them
said
something
*NL*
strange
,
not
in
Russian
.
In
among
the
hindmost
of
these
men
wearing
*NL*
similar
shakos
was
a
Russian
hussar
.
He
was
being
held
by
the
arms
and
*NL*
his
horse
was
being
led
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
one
of
ours
,
a
prisoner
.
Yes
.
Can
it
be
that
they
will
take
*NL*
me
too
?
Who
are
these
men
?
''
thought
Rostov
,
scarcely
believing
his
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Can
they
be
French
?
''
He
looked
at
the
approaching
Frenchmen
,
and
though
*NL*
but
a
moment
before
he
had
been
galloping
to
get
at
them
and
hack
them
*NL*
to
pieces
,
their
proximity
now
seemed
so
awful
that
he
could
not
believe
*NL*
his
eyes
.
``
Who
are
they
?
Why
are
they
running
?
Can
they
be
coming
at
me
?
*NL*
And
why
?
To
kill
me
?
Me
whom
everyone
is
so
fond
of
?
''
He
remembered
his
*NL*
mother
's
love
for
him
,
and
his
family
's
,
and
his
friends
'
,
and
the
*NL*
enemy
's
intention
to
kill
him
seemed
impossible
.
``
But
perhaps
they
may
*NL*
do
it
!
''
For
more
than
ten
seconds
he
stood
not
moving
from
the
spot
or
*NL*
realizing
the
situation
.
The
foremost
Frenchman
,
the
one
with
the
hooked
*NL*
nose
,
was
already
so
close
that
the
expression
of
his
face
could
be
*NL*
seen
.
And
the
excited
,
alien
face
of
that
man
,
his
bayonet
hanging
down
,
*NL*
holding
his
breath
,
and
running
so
lightly
,
frightened
Rostov
.
He
seized
*NL*
his
pistol
and
,
instead
of
firing
it
,
flung
it
at
the
Frenchman
and
ran
*NL*
with
all
his
might
toward
the
bushes
.
He
did
not
now
run
with
the
*NL*
feeling
of
doubt
and
conflict
with
which
he
had
trodden
the
Enns
bridge
,
*NL*
but
with
the
feeling
of
a
hare
fleeing
from
the
hounds
.
One
single
*NL*
sentiment
,
that
of
fear
for
his
young
and
happy
life
,
possessed
his
*NL*
whole
being
.
Rapidly
leaping
the
furrows
,
he
fled
across
the
field
with
*NL*
the
impetuosity
he
used
to
show
at
catchplay
,
now
and
then
turning
his
*NL*
good-natured
,
pale
,
young
face
to
look
back
.
A
shudder
of
terror
went
*NL*
through
him
:
``
No
,
better
not
look
,
''
he
thought
,
but
having
reached
the
*NL*
bushes
he
glanced
round
once
more
.
The
French
had
fallen
behind
,
and
*NL*
just
as
he
looked
round
the
first
man
changed
his
run
to
a
walk
and
,
*NL*
turning
,
shouted
something
loudly
to
a
comrade
farther
back
.
Rostov
*NL*
paused
.
``
No
,
there
's
some
mistake
,
''
thought
he
.
``
They
ca
n't
have
wanted
*NL*
to
kill
me
.
''
But
at
the
same
time
,
his
left
arm
felt
as
heavy
as
if
a
*NL*
seventy-pound
weight
were
tied
to
it
.
He
could
run
no
more
.
The
*NL*
Frenchman
also
stopped
and
took
aim
.
Rostov
closed
his
eyes
and
stooped
*NL*
down
.
One
bullet
and
then
another
whistled
past
him
.
He
mustered
his
*NL*
last
remaining
strength
,
took
hold
of
his
left
hand
with
his
right
,
and
*NL*
reached
the
bushes
.
Behind
these
were
some
Russian
sharpshooters
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
The
infantry
regiments
that
had
been
caught
unawares
in
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
the
wood
ran
out
of
it
,
the
different
companies
getting
mixed
,
and
*NL*
retreated
as
a
disorderly
crowd
.
One
soldier
,
in
his
fear
,
uttered
the
*NL*
senseless
cry
,
``
Cut
off
!
''
that
is
so
terrible
in
battle
,
and
that
word
*NL*
infected
the
whole
crowd
with
a
feeling
of
panic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surrounded
!
Cut
off
?
We
're
lost
!
''
shouted
the
fugitives
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
he
heard
the
firing
and
the
cry
from
behind
,
the
general
*NL*
realized
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
to
his
regiment
,
and
the
*NL*
thought
that
he
,
an
exemplary
officer
of
many
years
'
service
who
had
*NL*
never
been
to
blame
,
might
be
held
responsible
at
headquarters
for
*NL*
negligence
or
inefficiency
so
staggered
him
that
,
forgetting
the
*NL*
recalcitrant
cavalry
colonel
,
his
own
dignity
as
a
general
,
and
above
*NL*
all
quite
forgetting
the
danger
and
all
regard
for
self-preservation
,
he
*NL*
clutched
the
crupper
of
his
saddle
and
,
spurring
his
horse
,
galloped
to
*NL*
the
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
which
fell
around
,
but
fortunately
*NL*
missed
him
.
His
one
desire
was
to
know
what
was
happening
and
at
any
*NL*
cost
correct
,
or
remedy
,
the
mistake
if
he
had
made
one
,
so
that
he
,
an
*NL*
exemplary
officer
of
twenty-two
years
'
service
,
who
had
never
been
*NL*
censured
,
should
not
be
held
to
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
galloped
safely
through
the
French
,
he
reached
a
field
behind
the
*NL*
copse
across
which
our
men
,
regardless
of
orders
,
were
running
and
*NL*
descending
the
valley
.
That
moment
of
moral
hesitation
which
decides
the
*NL*
fate
of
battles
had
arrived
.
Would
this
disorderly
crowd
of
soldiers
*NL*
attend
to
the
voice
of
their
commander
,
or
would
they
,
disregarding
him
,
*NL*
continue
their
flight
?
Despite
his
desperate
shouts
that
used
to
seem
so
*NL*
terrible
to
the
soldiers
,
despite
his
furious
purple
countenance
*NL*
distorted
out
of
all
likeness
to
his
former
self
,
and
the
flourishing
of
*NL*
his
saber
,
the
soldiers
all
continued
to
run
,
talking
,
firing
into
the
*NL*
air
,
and
disobeying
orders
.
The
moral
hesitation
which
decided
the
fate
*NL*
of
battles
was
evidently
culminating
in
a
panic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
had
a
fit
of
coughing
as
a
result
of
shouting
and
of
the
*NL*
powder
smoke
and
stopped
in
despair
.
Everything
seemed
lost
.
But
at
that
*NL*
moment
the
French
who
were
attacking
,
suddenly
and
without
any
apparent
*NL*
reason
,
ran
back
and
disappeared
from
the
outskirts
,
and
Russian
*NL*
sharpshooters
showed
themselves
in
the
copse
.
It
was
Timokhin
's
company
,
*NL*
which
alone
had
maintained
its
order
in
the
wood
and
,
having
lain
in
*NL*
ambush
in
a
ditch
,
now
attacked
the
French
unexpectedly
.
Timokhin
,
armed
*NL*
only
with
a
sword
,
had
rushed
at
the
enemy
with
such
a
desperate
cry
and
*NL*
such
mad
,
drunken
determination
that
,
taken
by
surprise
,
the
French
had
*NL*
thrown
down
their
muskets
and
run
.
Dolokhov
,
running
beside
Timokhin
,
*NL*
killed
a
Frenchman
at
close
quarters
and
was
the
first
to
seize
the
*NL*
surrendering
French
officer
by
his
collar
.
Our
fugitives
returned
,
the
*NL*
battalions
re-formed
,
and
the
French
who
had
nearly
cut
our
left
flank
*NL*
in
half
were
for
the
moment
repulsed
.
Our
reserve
units
were
able
to
*NL*
join
up
,
and
the
fight
was
at
an
end
.
The
regimental
commander
and
Major
*NL*
Ekonomov
had
stopped
beside
a
bridge
,
letting
the
retreating
companies
*NL*
pass
by
them
,
when
a
soldier
came
up
and
took
hold
of
the
commander
's
*NL*
stirrup
,
almost
leaning
against
him
.
The
man
was
wearing
a
bluish
coat
*NL*
of
broadcloth
,
he
had
no
knapsack
or
cap
,
his
head
was
bandaged
,
and
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
a
French
munition
pouch
was
slung
.
He
had
an
officer
's
*NL*
sword
in
his
hand
.
The
soldier
was
pale
,
his
blue
eyes
looked
impudently
*NL*
into
the
commander
's
face
,
and
his
lips
were
smiling
.
Though
the
*NL*
commander
was
occupied
in
giving
instructions
to
Major
Ekonomov
,
he
*NL*
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
here
are
two
trophies
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
French
sword
and
pouch
.
``
I
have
taken
an
officer
prisoner
.
I
stopped
the
*NL*
company
.
''
Dolokhov
breathed
heavily
from
weariness
and
spoke
in
abrupt
*NL*
sentences
.
``
The
whole
company
can
bear
witness
.
I
beg
you
will
remember
*NL*
this
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
replied
the
commander
,
and
turned
to
Major
*NL*
Ekonomov
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dolokhov
did
not
go
away
;
he
untied
the
handkerchief
around
his
*NL*
head
,
pulled
it
off
,
and
showed
the
blood
congealed
on
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bayonet
wound
.
I
remained
at
the
front
.
Remember
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tushin
's
battery
had
been
forgotten
and
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
*NL*
action
did
Prince
Bagration
,
still
hearing
the
cannonade
in
the
center
,
*NL*
send
his
orderly
staff
officer
,
and
later
Prince
Andrew
also
,
to
order
*NL*
the
battery
to
retire
as
quickly
as
possible
.
When
the
supports
attached
*NL*
to
Tushin
's
battery
had
been
moved
away
in
the
middle
of
the
action
by
*NL*
someone
's
order
,
the
battery
had
continued
firing
and
was
only
not
*NL*
captured
by
the
French
because
the
enemy
could
not
surmise
that
anyone
*NL*
could
have
the
effrontery
to
continue
firing
from
four
quite
undefended
*NL*
guns
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
energetic
action
of
that
battery
led
the
*NL*
French
to
suppose
that
here
--
in
the
center
--
the
main
Russian
forces
were
*NL*
concentrated
.
Twice
they
had
attempted
to
attack
this
point
,
but
on
each
*NL*
occasion
had
been
driven
back
by
grapeshot
from
the
four
isolated
guns
*NL*
on
the
hillock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Prince
Bagration
had
left
him
,
Tushin
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
setting
fire
to
Schon
Grabern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
them
scurrying
!
It
's
burning
!
Just
see
the
smoke
!
Fine
!
Grand
!
*NL*
Look
at
the
smoke
,
the
smoke
!
''
exclaimed
the
artillerymen
,
brightening
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
guns
,
without
waiting
for
orders
,
were
being
fired
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
conflagration
.
As
if
urging
each
other
on
,
the
soldiers
*NL*
cried
at
each
shot
:
``
Fine
!
That
's
good
!
Look
at
it
...
Grand
!
''
The
fire
,
*NL*
fanned
by
the
breeze
,
was
rapidly
spreading
.
The
French
columns
that
had
*NL*
advanced
beyond
the
village
went
back
;
but
as
though
in
revenge
for
this
*NL*
failure
,
the
enemy
placed
ten
guns
to
the
right
of
the
village
and
began
*NL*
firing
them
at
Tushin
's
battery
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
childlike
glee
,
aroused
by
the
fire
and
their
luck
in
*NL*
successfully
cannonading
the
French
,
our
artillerymen
only
noticed
this
*NL*
battery
when
two
balls
,
and
then
four
more
,
fell
among
our
guns
,
one
*NL*
knocking
over
two
horses
and
another
tearing
off
a
munition-wagon
*NL*
driver
's
leg
.
Their
spirits
once
roused
were
,
however
,
not
diminished
,
*NL*
but
only
changed
character
.
The
horses
were
replaced
by
others
from
a
*NL*
reserve
gun
carriage
,
the
wounded
were
carried
away
,
and
the
four
guns
*NL*
were
turned
against
the
ten-gun
battery
.
Tushin
's
companion
officer
had
*NL*
been
killed
at
the
beginning
of
the
engagement
and
within
an
hour
*NL*
seventeen
of
the
forty
men
of
the
guns
'
crews
had
been
disabled
,
but
the
*NL*
artillerymen
were
still
as
merry
and
lively
as
ever
.
Twice
they
noticed
*NL*
the
French
appearing
below
them
,
and
then
they
fired
grapeshot
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Tushin
,
moving
feebly
and
awkwardly
,
kept
telling
his
orderly
to
*NL*
``
refill
my
pipe
for
that
one
!
''
and
then
,
scattering
sparks
from
it
,
ran
*NL*
forward
shading
his
eyes
with
his
small
hand
to
look
at
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smack
at
'em
,
lads
!
''
he
kept
saying
,
seizing
the
guns
by
the
wheels
and
*NL*
working
the
screws
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
smoke
,
deafened
by
the
incessant
reports
which
always
made
him
*NL*
jump
,
Tushin
not
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
ran
from
gun
to
gun
,
now
*NL*
aiming
,
now
counting
the
charges
,
now
giving
orders
about
replacing
dead
*NL*
or
wounded
horses
and
harnessing
fresh
ones
,
and
shouting
in
his
feeble
*NL*
voice
,
so
high
pitched
and
irresolute
.
His
face
grew
more
and
more
*NL*
animated
.
Only
when
a
man
was
killed
or
wounded
did
he
frown
and
turn
*NL*
away
from
the
sight
,
shouting
angrily
at
the
men
who
,
as
is
always
the
*NL*
case
,
hesitated
about
lifting
the
injured
or
dead
.
The
soldiers
,
for
the
*NL*
most
part
handsome
fellows
and
,
as
is
always
the
case
in
an
artillery
*NL*
company
,
a
head
and
shoulders
taller
and
twice
as
broad
as
their
*NL*
officer
--
all
looked
at
their
commander
like
children
in
an
embarrassing
*NL*
situation
,
and
the
expression
on
his
face
was
invariably
reflected
on
*NL*
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
the
terrible
uproar
and
the
necessity
for
concentration
and
*NL*
activity
,
Tushin
did
not
experience
the
slightest
unpleasant
sense
of
*NL*
fear
,
and
the
thought
that
he
might
be
killed
or
badly
wounded
never
*NL*
occurred
to
him
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
became
more
and
more
elated
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
very
long
time
ago
,
almost
a
day
,
since
he
*NL*
had
first
seen
the
enemy
and
fired
the
first
shot
,
and
that
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
field
he
stood
on
was
well-known
and
familiar
ground
.
Though
he
*NL*
thought
of
everything
,
considered
everything
,
and
did
everything
the
*NL*
best
of
officers
could
do
in
his
position
,
he
was
in
a
state
akin
to
*NL*
feverish
delirium
or
drunkenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
deafening
sounds
of
his
own
guns
around
him
,
the
whistle
and
*NL*
thud
of
the
enemy
's
cannon
balls
,
from
the
flushed
and
perspiring
faces
*NL*
of
the
crew
bustling
round
the
guns
,
from
the
sight
of
the
blood
of
men
*NL*
and
horses
,
from
the
little
puffs
of
smoke
on
the
enemy
's
side
-LRB-
always
*NL*
followed
by
a
ball
flying
past
and
striking
the
earth
,
a
man
,
a
gun
,
a
*NL*
horse
-RRB-
,
from
the
sight
of
all
these
things
a
fantastic
world
of
his
own
*NL*
had
taken
possession
of
his
brain
and
at
that
moment
afforded
him
*NL*
pleasure
.
The
enemy
's
guns
were
in
his
fancy
not
guns
but
pipes
from
*NL*
which
occasional
puffs
were
blown
by
an
invisible
smoker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
...
he
's
puffing
again
,
''
muttered
Tushin
to
himself
,
as
a
small
*NL*
cloud
rose
from
the
hill
and
was
borne
in
a
streak
to
the
left
by
the
*NL*
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
out
for
the
ball
...
we
'll
throw
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
your
honor
?
''
asked
an
artilleryman
,
standing
close
*NL*
by
,
who
heard
him
muttering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
...
only
a
shell
...
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
our
Matvevna
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Matvevna
''
*
was
the
*NL*
name
his
fancy
gave
to
the
farthest
gun
of
the
battery
,
which
was
large
*NL*
and
of
an
old
pattern
.
The
French
swarming
round
their
guns
seemed
to
*NL*
him
like
ants
.
In
that
world
,
the
handsome
drunkard
Number
One
of
the
*NL*
second
gun
's
crew
was
``
uncle
''
;
Tushin
looked
at
him
more
often
than
at
*NL*
anyone
else
and
took
delight
in
his
every
movement
.
The
sound
of
*NL*
musketry
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
now
diminishing
,
now
increasing
,
*NL*
seemed
like
someone
's
breathing
.
He
listened
intently
to
the
ebb
and
*NL*
flow
of
these
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Daughter
of
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Breathing
again
,
breathing
!
''
he
muttered
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
imagined
himself
as
an
enormously
tall
,
powerful
man
who
was
throwing
*NL*
cannon
balls
at
the
French
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Matvevna
,
dear
old
lady
,
do
n't
let
me
down
!
''
he
was
saying
as
*NL*
he
moved
from
the
gun
,
when
a
strange
,
unfamiliar
voice
called
above
his
*NL*
head
:
``
Captain
Tushin
!
Captain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tushin
turned
round
in
dismay
.
It
was
the
staff
officer
who
had
turned
*NL*
him
out
of
the
booth
at
Grunth
.
He
was
shouting
in
a
gasping
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
mad
?
You
have
twice
been
ordered
to
retreat
,
and
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
they
down
on
me
?
''
thought
Tushin
,
looking
in
alarm
at
his
*NL*
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
do
n't
...
''
he
muttered
,
holding
up
two
fingers
to
his
cap
.
``
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
staff
officer
did
not
finish
what
he
wanted
to
say
.
A
cannon
*NL*
ball
,
flying
close
to
him
,
caused
him
to
duck
and
bend
over
his
horse
.
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
say
something
more
,
another
ball
*NL*
stopped
him
.
He
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Retire
!
All
to
retire
!
''
he
shouted
from
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
laughed
.
A
moment
later
,
an
adjutant
arrived
with
the
same
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Prince
Andrew
.
The
first
thing
he
saw
on
riding
up
to
the
space
*NL*
where
Tushin
's
guns
were
stationed
was
an
unharnessed
horse
with
a
*NL*
broken
leg
,
that
lay
screaming
piteously
beside
the
harnessed
horses
.
*NL*
Blood
was
gushing
from
its
leg
as
from
a
spring
.
Among
the
limbers
lay
*NL*
several
dead
men
.
One
ball
after
another
passed
over
as
he
approached
*NL*
and
he
felt
a
nervous
shudder
run
down
his
spine
.
But
the
mere
thought
*NL*
of
being
afraid
roused
him
again
.
``
I
can
not
be
afraid
,
''
thought
he
,
and
*NL*
dismounted
slowly
among
the
guns
.
He
delivered
the
order
and
did
not
*NL*
leave
the
battery
.
He
decided
to
have
the
guns
removed
from
their
*NL*
positions
and
withdrawn
in
his
presence
.
Together
with
Tushin
,
stepping
*NL*
across
the
bodies
and
under
a
terrible
fire
from
the
French
,
he
attended
*NL*
to
the
removal
of
the
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
staff
officer
was
here
a
minute
ago
,
but
skipped
off
,
''
said
an
*NL*
artilleryman
to
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Not
like
your
honor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
said
nothing
to
Tushin
.
They
were
both
so
busy
as
to
seem
*NL*
not
to
notice
one
another
.
When
having
limbered
up
the
only
two
cannon
*NL*
that
remained
uninjured
out
of
the
four
,
they
began
moving
down
the
hill
*NL*
-LRB-
one
shattered
gun
and
one
unicorn
were
left
behind
-RRB-
,
Prince
Andrew
rode
*NL*
up
to
Tushin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
till
we
meet
again
...
''
he
said
,
holding
out
his
hand
to
Tushin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Tushin
.
``
Dear
soul
!
Good-bye
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
!
''
and
for
some
unknown
reason
tears
suddenly
filled
his
eyes
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
had
fallen
and
black
clouds
,
merging
with
the
powder
smoke
,
*NL*
hung
low
over
the
field
of
battle
on
the
horizon
.
It
was
growing
dark
*NL*
and
the
glow
of
two
conflagrations
was
the
more
conspicuous
.
The
*NL*
cannonade
was
dying
down
,
but
the
rattle
of
musketry
behind
and
on
the
*NL*
right
sounded
oftener
and
nearer
.
As
soon
as
Tushin
with
his
guns
,
*NL*
continually
driving
round
or
coming
upon
wounded
men
,
was
out
of
range
*NL*
of
fire
and
had
descended
into
the
dip
,
he
was
met
by
some
of
the
staff
,
*NL*
among
them
the
staff
officer
and
Zherkov
,
who
had
been
twice
sent
to
*NL*
Tushin
's
battery
but
had
never
reached
it
.
Interrupting
one
another
,
*NL*
they
all
gave
,
and
transmitted
,
orders
as
to
how
to
proceed
,
*NL*
reprimanding
and
reproaching
him
.
Tushin
gave
no
orders
,
and
,
silently
--
*NL*
fearing
to
speak
because
at
every
word
he
felt
ready
to
weep
without
*NL*
knowing
why
--
rode
behind
on
his
artillery
nag
.
Though
the
orders
were
to
*NL*
abandon
the
wounded
,
many
of
them
dragged
themselves
after
troops
and
*NL*
begged
for
seats
on
the
gun
carriages
.
The
jaunty
infantry
officer
who
*NL*
just
before
the
battle
had
rushed
out
of
Tushin
's
wattle
shed
was
laid
,
*NL*
with
a
bullet
in
his
stomach
,
on
``
Matvevna
's
''
carriage
.
At
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
a
pale
hussar
cadet
,
supporting
one
hand
with
the
other
,
came
*NL*
up
to
Tushin
and
asked
for
a
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
for
God
's
sake
!
I
've
hurt
my
arm
,
''
he
said
timidly
.
``
For
God
's
*NL*
sake
...
I
ca
n't
walk
.
For
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
this
cadet
had
already
repeatedly
asked
for
a
lift
and
*NL*
been
refused
.
He
asked
in
a
hesitating
,
piteous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
them
to
give
me
a
seat
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
a
seat
,
''
said
Tushin
.
``
Lay
a
cloak
for
him
to
sit
on
,
lad
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
addressing
his
favorite
soldier
.
``
And
where
is
the
wounded
*NL*
officer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
set
down
.
He
died
,
''
replied
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
him
up
.
Sit
down
,
dear
fellow
,
sit
down
!
Spread
out
the
cloak
,
*NL*
Antonov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cadet
was
Rostov
.
With
one
hand
he
supported
the
other
;
he
was
pale
*NL*
and
his
jaw
trembled
,
shivering
feverishly
.
He
was
placed
on
``
Matvevna
,
''
*NL*
the
gun
from
which
they
had
removed
the
dead
officer
.
The
cloak
they
*NL*
spread
under
him
was
wet
with
blood
which
stained
his
breeches
and
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
are
you
wounded
,
my
lad
?
''
said
Tushin
,
approaching
the
gun
on
*NL*
which
Rostov
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
a
sprain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
is
this
blood
on
the
gun
carriage
?
''
inquired
Tushin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
officer
,
your
honor
,
stained
it
,
''
answered
the
artilleryman
,
*NL*
wiping
away
the
blood
with
his
coat
sleeve
,
as
if
apologizing
for
the
*NL*
state
of
his
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
that
they
could
do
to
get
the
guns
up
the
rise
aided
by
the
*NL*
infantry
,
and
having
reached
the
village
of
Gruntersdorf
they
halted
.
It
*NL*
had
grown
so
dark
that
one
could
not
distinguish
the
uniforms
ten
paces
*NL*
off
,
and
the
firing
had
begun
to
subside
.
Suddenly
,
near
by
on
the
*NL*
right
,
shouting
and
firing
were
again
heard
.
Flashes
of
shot
gleamed
in
*NL*
the
darkness
.
This
was
the
last
French
attack
and
was
met
by
soldiers
*NL*
who
had
sheltered
in
the
village
houses
.
They
all
rushed
out
of
the
*NL*
village
again
,
but
Tushin
's
guns
could
not
move
,
and
the
artillerymen
,
*NL*
Tushin
,
and
the
cadet
exchanged
silent
glances
as
they
awaited
their
*NL*
fate
.
The
firing
died
down
and
soldiers
,
talking
eagerly
,
streamed
out
*NL*
of
a
side
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
hurt
,
Petrov
?
''
asked
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
given
it
'em
hot
,
mate
!
They
wo
n't
make
another
push
now
,
''
said
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
see
a
thing
.
How
they
shot
at
their
own
fellows
!
Nothing
*NL*
could
be
seen
.
Pitch-dark
,
brother
!
Is
n't
there
something
to
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
had
been
repulsed
for
the
last
time
.
And
again
and
again
in
*NL*
the
complete
darkness
Tushin
's
guns
moved
forward
,
surrounded
by
the
*NL*
humming
infantry
as
by
a
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
,
it
seemed
as
though
a
gloomy
unseen
river
was
flowing
*NL*
always
in
one
direction
,
humming
with
whispers
and
talk
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
hoofs
and
wheels
.
Amid
the
general
rumble
,
the
groans
and
voices
of
the
*NL*
wounded
were
more
distinctly
heard
than
any
other
sound
in
the
darkness
*NL*
of
the
night
.
The
gloom
that
enveloped
the
army
was
filled
with
their
*NL*
groans
,
which
seemed
to
melt
into
one
with
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
*NL*
After
a
while
the
moving
mass
became
agitated
,
someone
rode
past
on
a
*NL*
white
horse
followed
by
his
suite
,
and
said
something
in
passing
:
``
What
*NL*
did
he
say
?
Where
to
,
now
?
Halt
,
is
it
?
Did
he
thank
us
?
''
came
eager
*NL*
questions
from
all
sides
.
The
whole
moving
mass
began
pressing
closer
*NL*
together
and
a
report
spread
that
they
were
ordered
to
halt
:
evidently
*NL*
those
in
front
had
halted
.
All
remained
where
they
were
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
muddy
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fires
were
lighted
and
the
talk
became
more
audible
.
Captain
Tushin
,
*NL*
having
given
orders
to
his
company
,
sent
a
soldier
to
find
a
dressing
*NL*
station
or
a
doctor
for
the
cadet
,
and
sat
down
by
a
bonfire
the
*NL*
soldiers
had
kindled
on
the
road
.
Rostov
,
too
,
dragged
himself
to
the
*NL*
fire
.
From
pain
,
cold
,
and
damp
,
a
feverish
shivering
shook
his
whole
*NL*
body
.
Drowsiness
was
irresistibly
mastering
him
,
but
he
kept
awake
by
an
*NL*
excruciating
pain
in
his
arm
,
for
which
he
could
find
no
satisfactory
*NL*
position
.
He
kept
closing
his
eyes
and
then
again
looking
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
dazzlingly
red
,
and
at
the
feeble
,
round-shouldered
*NL*
figure
of
Tushin
who
was
sitting
cross-legged
like
a
Turk
beside
him
.
*NL*
Tushin
's
large
,
kind
,
intelligent
eyes
were
fixed
with
sympathy
and
*NL*
commiseration
on
Rostov
,
who
saw
that
Tushin
with
his
whole
heart
wished
*NL*
to
help
him
but
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
sides
were
heard
the
footsteps
and
talk
of
the
infantry
,
who
*NL*
were
walking
,
driving
past
,
and
settling
down
all
around
.
The
sound
of
*NL*
voices
,
the
tramping
feet
,
the
horses
'
hoofs
moving
in
mud
,
the
*NL*
crackling
of
wood
fires
near
and
afar
,
merged
into
one
tremulous
rumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
,
as
before
,
a
dark
,
unseen
river
flowing
through
the
*NL*
gloom
,
but
a
dark
sea
swelling
and
gradually
subsiding
after
a
storm
.
*NL*
Rostov
looked
at
and
listened
listlessly
to
what
passed
before
and
*NL*
around
him
.
An
infantryman
came
to
the
fire
,
squatted
on
his
heels
,
held
*NL*
his
hands
to
the
blaze
,
and
turned
away
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
your
honor
?
''
he
asked
Tushin
.
``
I
've
lost
my
company
,
*NL*
your
honor
.
I
do
n't
know
where
...
such
bad
luck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
soldier
,
an
infantry
officer
with
a
bandaged
cheek
came
up
to
*NL*
the
bonfire
,
and
addressing
Tushin
asked
him
to
have
the
guns
moved
a
*NL*
trifle
to
let
a
wagon
go
past
.
After
he
had
gone
,
two
soldiers
rushed
to
*NL*
the
campfire
.
They
were
quarreling
and
fighting
desperately
,
each
trying
*NL*
to
snatch
from
the
other
a
boot
they
were
both
holding
on
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
picked
it
up
?
...
I
dare
say
!
You
're
very
smart
!
''
one
of
them
*NL*
shouted
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
thin
,
pale
soldier
,
his
neck
bandaged
with
a
bloodstained
leg
*NL*
band
,
came
up
and
in
angry
tones
asked
the
artillerymen
for
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
one
die
like
a
dog
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tushin
told
them
to
give
the
man
some
water
.
Then
a
cheerful
soldier
ran
*NL*
up
,
begging
a
little
fire
for
the
infantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
little
hot
torch
for
the
infantry
!
Good
luck
to
you
,
fellow
*NL*
countrymen
.
Thanks
for
the
fire
--
we
'll
return
it
with
interest
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
carrying
away
into
the
darkness
a
glowing
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
came
four
soldiers
,
carrying
something
heavy
on
a
cloak
,
and
passed
*NL*
by
the
fire
.
One
of
them
stumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
the
devil
has
put
the
logs
on
the
road
?
''
snarled
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
dead
--
why
carry
him
?
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
their
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
aching
?
''
Tushin
asked
Rostov
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
you
're
wanted
by
the
general
.
He
is
in
the
hut
here
,
''
said
*NL*
a
gunner
,
coming
up
to
Tushin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
,
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tushin
rose
and
,
buttoning
his
greatcoat
and
pulling
it
straight
,
walked
*NL*
away
from
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
far
from
the
artillery
campfire
,
in
a
hut
that
had
been
prepared
for
*NL*
him
,
Prince
Bagration
sat
at
dinner
,
talking
with
some
commanding
*NL*
officers
who
had
gathered
at
his
quarters
.
The
little
old
man
with
the
*NL*
half-closed
eyes
was
there
greedily
gnawing
a
mutton
bone
,
and
the
*NL*
general
who
had
served
blamelessly
for
twenty-two
years
,
flushed
by
a
*NL*
glass
of
vodka
and
the
dinner
;
and
the
staff
officer
with
the
signet
*NL*
ring
,
and
Zherkov
,
uneasily
glancing
at
them
all
,
and
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
pale
,
with
compressed
lips
and
feverishly
glittering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
corner
of
the
hut
stood
a
standard
captured
from
the
French
,
and
*NL*
the
accountant
with
the
naive
face
was
feeling
its
texture
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
in
perplexity
--
perhaps
because
the
banner
really
interested
him
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
it
was
hard
for
him
,
hungry
as
he
was
,
to
look
on
at
a
*NL*
dinner
where
there
was
no
place
for
him
.
In
the
next
hut
there
was
a
*NL*
French
colonel
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
our
dragoons
.
Our
officers
*NL*
were
flocking
in
to
look
at
him
.
Prince
Bagration
was
thanking
the
*NL*
individual
commanders
and
inquiring
into
details
of
the
action
and
our
*NL*
losses
.
The
general
whose
regiment
had
been
inspected
at
Braunau
was
*NL*
informing
the
prince
that
as
soon
as
the
action
began
he
had
withdrawn
*NL*
from
the
wood
,
mustered
the
men
who
were
woodcutting
,
and
,
allowing
the
*NL*
French
to
pass
him
,
had
made
a
bayonet
charge
with
two
battalions
and
*NL*
had
broken
up
the
French
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
saw
,
your
excellency
,
that
their
first
battalion
was
*NL*
disorganized
,
I
stopped
in
the
road
and
thought
:
`
I
'll
let
them
come
on
*NL*
and
will
meet
them
with
the
fire
of
the
whole
battalion
'
--
and
that
's
*NL*
what
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
had
so
wished
to
do
this
and
was
so
sorry
he
had
not
managed
*NL*
to
do
it
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
it
had
really
happened
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
might
really
have
been
so
?
Could
one
possibly
make
out
amid
all
that
*NL*
confusion
what
did
or
did
not
happen
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
your
excellency
,
I
should
inform
you
,
''
he
continued
--
*NL*
remembering
Dolokhov
's
conversation
with
Kutuzov
and
his
last
interview
*NL*
with
the
gentleman-ranker
--
``
that
Private
Dolokhov
,
who
was
reduced
to
*NL*
the
ranks
,
took
a
French
officer
prisoner
in
my
presence
and
*NL*
particularly
distinguished
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
the
Pavlograd
hussars
attack
there
,
your
excellency
,

chimed
in
*NL*
Zherkov
,
looking
uneasily
around
.
He
had
not
seen
the
hussars
all
that
*NL*
day
,
but
had
heard
about
them
from
an
infantry
officer
.
``
They
broke
up
*NL*
two
squares
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
those
present
smiled
at
Zherkov
's
words
,
expecting
one
of
his
*NL*
usual
jokes
,
but
noticing
that
what
he
was
saying
redounded
to
the
glory
*NL*
of
our
arms
and
of
the
day
's
work
,
they
assumed
a
serious
expression
,
*NL*
though
many
of
them
knew
that
what
he
was
saying
was
a
lie
devoid
of
any
*NL*
foundation
.
Prince
Bagration
turned
to
the
old
colonel
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
I
thank
you
all
;
all
arms
have
behaved
heroically
:
infantry
,
*NL*
cavalry
,
and
artillery
.
How
was
it
that
two
guns
were
abandoned
in
the
*NL*
center
?
''
he
inquired
,
searching
with
his
eyes
for
someone
.
-LRB-
Prince
*NL*
Bagration
did
not
ask
about
the
guns
on
the
left
flank
;
he
knew
that
all
*NL*
the
guns
there
had
been
abandoned
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
action
.
-RRB-
*NL*
``
I
think
I
sent
you
?
''
he
added
,
turning
to
the
staff
officer
on
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
was
damaged
,
''
answered
the
staff
officer
,
``
and
the
other
I
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
.
I
was
there
all
the
time
giving
orders
and
had
only
just
*NL*
left
...
It
is
true
that
it
was
hot
there
,
''
he
added
,
modestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Someone
mentioned
that
Captain
Tushin
was
bivouacking
close
to
the
*NL*
village
and
had
already
been
sent
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
were
there
?
''
said
Prince
Bagration
,
addressing
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
we
only
just
missed
one
another
,
''
said
the
staff
officer
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
to
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
coldly
and
*NL*
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
.
Tushin
appeared
at
the
threshold
and
made
his
way
*NL*
timidly
from
behind
the
backs
of
the
generals
.
As
he
stepped
past
the
*NL*
generals
in
the
crowded
hut
,
feeling
embarrassed
as
he
always
was
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
his
superiors
,
he
did
not
notice
the
staff
of
the
banner
and
*NL*
stumbled
over
it
.
Several
of
those
present
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
a
gun
was
abandoned
?
''
asked
Bagration
,
frowning
,
not
so
much
*NL*
at
the
captain
as
at
those
who
were
laughing
,
among
whom
Zherkov
laughed
*NL*
loudest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
now
,
when
he
was
confronted
by
the
stern
authorities
,
did
his
guilt
*NL*
and
the
disgrace
of
having
lost
two
guns
and
yet
remaining
alive
present
*NL*
themselves
to
Tushin
in
all
their
horror
.
He
had
been
so
excited
that
he
*NL*
had
not
thought
about
it
until
that
moment
.
The
officers
'
laughter
*NL*
confused
him
still
more
.
He
stood
before
Bagration
with
his
lower
jaw
*NL*
trembling
and
was
hardly
able
to
mutter
:
``
I
do
n't
know
...
your
*NL*
excellency
...
I
had
no
men
...
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
taken
some
from
the
covering
troops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tushin
did
not
say
that
there
were
no
covering
troops
,
though
that
was
*NL*
perfectly
true
.
He
was
afraid
of
getting
some
other
officer
into
*NL*
trouble
,
and
silently
fixed
his
eyes
on
Bagration
as
a
schoolboy
who
has
*NL*
blundered
looks
at
an
examiner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
lasted
some
time
.
Prince
Bagration
,
apparently
not
wishing
*NL*
to
be
severe
,
found
nothing
to
say
;
the
others
did
not
venture
to
*NL*
intervene
.
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
Tushin
from
under
his
brows
and
his
*NL*
fingers
twitched
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
!
''
Prince
Andrew
broke
the
silence
with
his
abrupt
*NL*
voice
,
``
you
were
pleased
to
send
me
to
Captain
Tushin
's
battery
.
I
went
*NL*
there
and
found
two
thirds
of
the
men
and
horses
knocked
out
,
two
guns
*NL*
smashed
,
and
no
supports
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
and
Tushin
looked
with
equal
intentness
at
Bolkonski
,
*NL*
who
spoke
with
suppressed
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
if
your
excellency
will
allow
me
to
express
my
opinion
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
we
owe
today
's
success
chiefly
to
the
action
of
that
battery
*NL*
and
the
heroic
endurance
of
Captain
Tushin
and
his
company
,
''
and
without
*NL*
awaiting
a
reply
,
Prince
Andrew
rose
and
left
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
looked
at
Tushin
,
evidently
reluctant
to
show
distrust
*NL*
in
Bolkonski
's
emphatic
opinion
yet
not
feeling
able
fully
to
credit
it
,
*NL*
bent
his
head
,
and
told
Tushin
that
he
could
go
.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
you
saved
me
,
my
dear
fellow
!
''
said
Tushin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
gave
him
a
look
,
but
said
nothing
and
went
away
.
He
felt
*NL*
sad
and
depressed
.
It
was
all
so
strange
,
so
unlike
what
he
had
hoped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
they
?
Why
are
they
here
?
What
do
they
want
?
And
when
will
all
*NL*
this
end
?
''
thought
Rostov
,
looking
at
the
changing
shadows
before
him
.
*NL*
The
pain
in
his
arm
became
more
and
more
intense
.
Irresistible
*NL*
drowsiness
overpowered
him
,
red
rings
danced
before
his
eyes
,
and
the
*NL*
impression
of
those
voices
and
faces
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
merged
*NL*
with
the
physical
pain
.
It
was
they
,
these
soldiers
--
wounded
and
*NL*
unwounded
--
it
was
they
who
were
crushing
,
weighing
down
,
and
twisting
*NL*
the
sinews
and
scorching
the
flesh
of
his
sprained
arm
and
shoulder
.
To
*NL*
rid
himself
of
them
he
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
dozed
,
but
in
that
short
interval
innumerable
things
*NL*
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
:
his
mother
and
her
large
white
hand
,
Sonya
's
*NL*
thin
little
shoulders
,
Natasha
's
eyes
and
laughter
,
Denisov
with
his
*NL*
voice
and
mustache
,
and
Telyanin
and
all
that
affair
with
Telyanin
and
*NL*
Bogdanich
.
That
affair
was
the
same
thing
as
this
soldier
with
the
harsh
*NL*
voice
,
and
it
was
that
affair
and
this
soldier
that
were
so
agonizingly
,
*NL*
incessantly
pulling
and
pressing
his
arm
and
always
dragging
it
in
one
*NL*
direction
.
He
tried
to
get
away
from
them
,
but
they
would
not
for
an
*NL*
instant
let
his
shoulder
move
a
hair
's
breadth
.
It
would
not
ache
--
it
*NL*
would
be
well
--
if
only
they
did
not
pull
it
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
.
The
black
canopy
of
night
hung
less
*NL*
than
a
yard
above
the
glow
of
the
charcoal
.
Flakes
of
falling
snow
were
*NL*
fluttering
in
that
light
.
Tushin
had
not
returned
,
the
doctor
had
not
*NL*
come
.
He
was
alone
now
,
except
for
a
soldier
who
was
sitting
naked
at
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
fire
,
warming
his
thin
yellow
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
wants
me
!
''
thought
Rostov
.
``
There
is
no
one
to
help
me
or
pity
*NL*
me
.
Yet
I
was
once
at
home
,
strong
,
happy
,
and
loved
.
''
He
sighed
and
,
*NL*
doing
so
,
groaned
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
is
anything
hurting
you
?
''
asked
the
soldier
,
shaking
his
shirt
out
*NL*
over
the
fire
,
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
he
gave
a
grunt
and
added
:
*NL*
``
What
a
lot
of
men
have
been
crippled
today
--
frightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
did
not
listen
to
the
soldier
.
He
looked
at
the
snowflakes
*NL*
fluttering
above
the
fire
and
remembered
a
Russian
winter
at
his
warm
,
*NL*
bright
home
,
his
fluffy
fur
coat
,
his
quickly
gliding
sleigh
,
his
*NL*
healthy
body
,
and
all
the
affection
and
care
of
his
family
.
``
And
why
did
*NL*
I
come
here
?
''
he
wondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
French
army
did
not
renew
their
attack
,
and
the
remnant
of
*NL*
Bagration
's
detachment
was
reunited
to
Kutuzov
's
army
.

1805
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
was
not
a
man
who
deliberately
thought
out
his
plans
.
*NL*
Still
less
did
he
think
of
injuring
anyone
for
his
own
advantage
.
He
was
*NL*
merely
a
man
of
the
world
who
had
got
on
and
to
whom
getting
on
had
*NL*
become
a
habit
.
Schemes
and
devices
for
which
he
never
rightly
accounted
*NL*
to
himself
,
but
which
formed
the
whole
interest
of
his
life
,
were
*NL*
constantly
shaping
themselves
in
his
mind
,
arising
from
the
*NL*
circumstances
and
persons
he
met
.
Of
these
plans
he
had
not
merely
one
*NL*
or
two
in
his
head
but
dozens
,
some
only
beginning
to
form
themselves
,
*NL*
some
approaching
achievement
,
and
some
in
course
of
disintegration
.
He
*NL*
did
not
,
for
instance
,
say
to
himself
:
``
This
man
now
has
influence
,
I
*NL*
must
gain
his
confidence
and
friendship
and
through
him
obtain
a
special
*NL*
grant
.
''
Nor
did
he
say
to
himself
:
``
Pierre
is
a
rich
man
,
I
must
entice
*NL*
him
to
marry
my
daughter
and
lend
me
the
forty
thousand
rubles
I
need
.
''
*NL*
But
when
he
came
across
a
man
of
position
his
instinct
immediately
told
*NL*
him
that
this
man
could
be
useful
,
and
without
any
premeditation
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
took
the
first
opportunity
to
gain
his
confidence
,
flatter
him
,
*NL*
become
intimate
with
him
,
and
finally
make
his
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
Pierre
at
hand
in
Moscow
and
procured
for
him
an
appointment
as
*NL*
Gentleman
of
the
Bedchamber
,
which
at
that
time
conferred
the
status
of
*NL*
Councilor
of
State
,
and
insisted
on
the
young
man
accompanying
him
to
*NL*
Petersburg
and
staying
at
his
house
.
With
apparent
absent-mindedness
,
*NL*
yet
with
unhesitating
assurance
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
,
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
did
everything
to
get
Pierre
to
marry
his
daughter
.
Had
he
*NL*
thought
out
his
plans
beforehand
he
could
not
have
been
so
natural
and
*NL*
shown
such
unaffected
familiarity
in
intercourse
with
everybody
both
*NL*
above
and
below
him
in
social
standing
.
Something
always
drew
him
toward
*NL*
those
richer
and
more
powerful
than
himself
and
he
had
rare
skill
in
*NL*
seizing
the
most
opportune
moment
for
making
use
of
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
on
unexpectedly
becoming
Count
Bezukhov
and
a
rich
man
,
felt
*NL*
himself
after
his
recent
loneliness
and
freedom
from
cares
so
beset
and
*NL*
preoccupied
that
only
in
bed
was
he
able
to
be
by
himself
.
He
had
to
*NL*
sign
papers
,
to
present
himself
at
government
offices
,
the
purpose
of
*NL*
which
was
not
clear
to
him
,
to
question
his
chief
steward
,
to
visit
his
*NL*
estate
near
Moscow
,
and
to
receive
many
people
who
formerly
did
not
even
*NL*
wish
to
know
of
his
existence
but
would
now
have
been
offended
and
*NL*
grieved
had
he
chosen
not
to
see
them
.
These
different
people
--
*NL*
businessmen
,
relations
,
and
acquaintances
alike
--
were
all
disposed
to
*NL*
treat
the
young
heir
in
the
most
friendly
and
flattering
manner
:
they
*NL*
were
all
evidently
firmly
convinced
of
Pierre
's
noble
qualities
.
He
was
*NL*
always
hearing
such
words
as
:
``
With
your
remarkable
kindness
,
''
or
,
``
With
*NL*
your
excellent
heart
,
''
``
You
are
yourself
so
honorable
Count
,
''
or
,
``
Were
*NL*
he
as
clever
as
you
,
''
and
so
on
,
till
he
began
sincerely
to
believe
in
*NL*
his
own
exceptional
kindness
and
extraordinary
intelligence
,
the
more
so
*NL*
as
in
the
depth
of
his
heart
it
had
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
really
*NL*
was
very
kind
and
intelligent
.
Even
people
who
had
formerly
been
*NL*
spiteful
toward
him
and
evidently
unfriendly
now
became
gentle
and
*NL*
affectionate
.
The
angry
eldest
princess
,
with
the
long
waist
and
hair
*NL*
plastered
down
like
a
doll
's
,
had
come
into
Pierre
's
room
after
the
*NL*
funeral
.
With
drooping
eyes
and
frequent
blushes
she
told
him
she
was
*NL*
very
sorry
about
their
past
misunderstandings
and
did
not
now
feel
she
*NL*
had
a
right
to
ask
him
for
anything
,
except
only
for
permission
,
after
*NL*
the
blow
she
had
received
,
to
remain
for
a
few
weeks
longer
in
the
house
*NL*
she
so
loved
and
where
she
had
sacrificed
so
much
.
She
could
not
refrain
*NL*
from
weeping
at
these
words
.
Touched
that
this
statuesque
princess
could
*NL*
so
change
,
Pierre
took
her
hand
and
begged
her
forgiveness
,
without
*NL*
knowing
what
for
.
From
that
day
the
eldest
princess
quite
changed
toward
*NL*
Pierre
and
began
knitting
a
striped
scarf
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
this
for
my
sake
,
mon
cher
;
after
all
,
she
had
to
put
up
with
a
*NL*
great
deal
from
the
deceased
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
to
him
,
handing
him
a
*NL*
deed
to
sign
for
the
princess
'
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
throw
*NL*
this
bone
--
a
bill
for
thirty
thousand
rubles
--
to
the
poor
princess
that
*NL*
it
might
not
occur
to
her
to
speak
of
his
share
in
the
affair
of
the
*NL*
inlaid
portfolio
.
Pierre
signed
the
deed
and
after
that
the
princess
*NL*
grew
still
kinder
.
The
younger
sisters
also
became
affectionate
to
him
,
*NL*
especially
the
youngest
,
the
pretty
one
with
the
mole
,
who
often
made
*NL*
him
feel
confused
by
her
smiles
and
her
own
confusion
when
meeting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
so
natural
to
Pierre
that
everyone
should
like
him
,
and
it
*NL*
would
have
seemed
so
unnatural
had
anyone
disliked
him
,
that
he
could
*NL*
not
but
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
those
around
him
.
Besides
,
he
had
no
*NL*
time
to
ask
himself
whether
these
people
were
sincere
or
not
.
He
was
*NL*
always
busy
and
always
felt
in
a
state
of
mild
and
cheerful
*NL*
intoxication
.
He
felt
as
though
he
were
the
center
of
some
important
and
*NL*
general
movement
;
that
something
was
constantly
expected
of
him
,
that
if
*NL*
he
did
not
do
it
he
would
grieve
and
disappoint
many
people
,
but
if
he
*NL*
did
this
and
that
,
all
would
be
well
;
and
he
did
what
was
demanded
of
*NL*
him
,
but
still
that
happy
result
always
remained
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
anyone
else
,
Prince
Vasili
took
possession
of
Pierre
's
affairs
*NL*
and
of
Pierre
himself
in
those
early
days
.
From
the
death
of
Count
*NL*
Bezukhov
he
did
not
let
go
his
hold
of
the
lad
.
He
had
the
air
of
a
man
*NL*
oppressed
by
business
,
weary
and
suffering
,
who
yet
would
not
,
for
*NL*
pity
's
sake
,
leave
this
helpless
youth
who
,
after
all
,
was
the
son
of
*NL*
his
old
friend
and
the
possessor
of
such
enormous
wealth
,
to
the
caprice
*NL*
of
fate
and
the
designs
of
rogues
.
During
the
few
days
he
spent
in
*NL*
Moscow
after
the
death
of
Count
Bezukhov
,
he
would
call
Pierre
,
or
go
to
*NL*
him
himself
,
and
tell
him
what
ought
to
be
done
in
a
tone
of
weariness
*NL*
and
assurance
,
as
if
he
were
adding
every
time
:
``
You
know
I
am
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
business
and
it
is
purely
out
of
charity
that
I
trouble
*NL*
myself
about
you
,
and
you
also
know
quite
well
that
what
I
propose
is
*NL*
the
only
thing
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
tomorrow
we
are
off
at
last
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
one
day
,
closing
his
eyes
and
fingering
Pierre
's
elbow
,
speaking
as
if
*NL*
he
were
saying
something
which
had
long
since
been
agreed
upon
and
could
*NL*
not
now
be
altered
.
``
We
start
tomorrow
and
I
'm
giving
you
a
place
in
my
*NL*
carriage
.
I
am
very
glad
.
All
our
important
business
here
is
now
*NL*
settled
,
and
I
ought
to
have
been
off
long
ago
.
Here
is
something
I
have
*NL*
received
from
the
chancellor
.
I
asked
him
for
you
,
and
you
have
been
*NL*
entered
in
the
diplomatic
corps
and
made
a
Gentleman
of
the
Bedchamber
.
*NL*
The
diplomatic
career
now
lies
open
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
tone
of
wearied
assurance
with
which
these
words
*NL*
were
pronounced
,
Pierre
,
who
had
so
long
been
considering
his
career
,
*NL*
wished
to
make
some
suggestion
.
But
Prince
Vasili
interrupted
him
in
the
*NL*
special
deep
cooing
tone
,
precluding
the
possibility
of
interrupting
his
*NL*
speech
,
which
he
used
in
extreme
cases
when
special
persuasion
was
*NL*
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
,
mon
cher
,
I
did
this
for
my
own
sake
,
to
satisfy
my
conscience
,
*NL*
and
there
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for
.
No
one
has
ever
complained
yet
of
*NL*
being
too
much
loved
;
and
besides
,
you
are
free
,
you
could
throw
it
up
*NL*
tomorrow
.
But
you
will
see
everything
for
yourself
when
you
get
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
It
is
high
time
for
you
to
get
away
from
these
terrible
*NL*
recollections
.
''
Prince
Vasili
sighed
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
my
boy
.
And
my
valet
*NL*
can
go
in
your
carriage
.
Ah
!
I
was
nearly
forgetting
,
''
he
added
.
``
You
*NL*
know
,
mon
cher
,
your
father
and
I
had
some
accounts
to
settle
,
so
I
have
*NL*
received
what
was
due
from
the
Ryazan
estate
and
will
keep
it
;
you
wo
n't
*NL*
require
it
.
We
'll
go
into
the
accounts
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
``
what
was
due
from
the
Ryazan
estate
''
Prince
Vasili
meant
several
*NL*
thousand
rubles
quitrent
received
from
Pierre
's
peasants
,
which
the
*NL*
prince
had
retained
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Petersburg
,
as
in
Moscow
,
Pierre
found
the
same
atmosphere
of
*NL*
gentleness
and
affection
.
He
could
not
refuse
the
post
,
or
rather
the
*NL*
rank
-LRB-
for
he
did
nothing
-RRB-
,
that
Prince
Vasili
had
procured
for
him
,
and
*NL*
acquaintances
,
invitations
,
and
social
occupations
were
so
numerous
*NL*
that
,
even
more
than
in
Moscow
,
he
felt
a
sense
of
bewilderment
,
bustle
,
*NL*
and
continual
expectation
of
some
good
,
always
in
front
of
him
but
never
*NL*
attained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
his
former
bachelor
acquaintances
many
were
no
longer
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
The
Guards
had
gone
to
the
front
;
Dolokhov
had
been
reduced
to
the
*NL*
ranks
;
Anatole
was
in
the
army
somewhere
in
the
provinces
;
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
was
abroad
;
so
Pierre
had
not
the
opportunity
to
spend
his
nights
as
he
*NL*
used
to
like
to
spend
them
,
or
to
open
his
mind
by
intimate
talks
with
a
*NL*
friend
older
than
himself
and
whom
he
respected
.
His
whole
time
was
*NL*
taken
up
with
dinners
and
balls
and
was
spent
chiefly
at
Prince
Vasili
's
*NL*
house
in
the
company
of
the
stout
princess
,
his
wife
,
and
his
beautiful
*NL*
daughter
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
the
others
,
Anna
Pavlovna
Scherer
showed
Pierre
the
change
of
*NL*
attitude
toward
him
that
had
taken
place
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Formerly
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
presence
,
Pierre
had
always
felt
that
what
*NL*
he
was
saying
was
out
of
place
,
tactless
and
unsuitable
,
that
remarks
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
clever
while
they
formed
in
his
mind
became
foolish
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
uttered
them
,
while
on
the
contrary
Hippolyte
's
stupidest
*NL*
remarks
came
out
clever
and
apt
.
Now
everything
Pierre
said
was
*NL*
charmant
.
Even
if
Anna
Pavlovna
did
not
say
so
,
he
could
see
that
she
*NL*
wished
to
and
only
refrained
out
of
regard
for
his
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
1805-6
Pierre
received
one
of
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
's
usual
pink
notes
with
an
invitation
to
which
was
added
:
``
You
*NL*
will
find
the
beautiful
Helene
here
,
whom
it
is
always
delightful
to
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
read
that
sentence
,
Pierre
felt
for
the
first
time
that
some
*NL*
link
which
other
people
recognized
had
grown
up
between
himself
and
*NL*
Helene
,
and
that
thought
both
alarmed
him
,
as
if
some
obligation
were
*NL*
being
imposed
on
him
which
he
could
not
fulfill
,
and
pleased
him
as
an
*NL*
entertaining
supposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
``
At
Home
''
was
like
the
former
one
,
only
the
novelty
she
*NL*
offered
her
guests
this
time
was
not
Mortemart
,
but
a
diplomatist
fresh
*NL*
from
Berlin
with
the
very
latest
details
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
*NL*
visit
to
Potsdam
,
and
of
how
the
two
august
friends
had
pledged
*NL*
themselves
in
an
indissoluble
alliance
to
uphold
the
cause
of
justice
*NL*
against
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
.
Anna
Pavlovna
received
Pierre
with
*NL*
a
shade
of
melancholy
,
evidently
relating
to
the
young
man
's
recent
loss
*NL*
by
the
death
of
Count
Bezukhov
-LRB-
everyone
constantly
considered
it
a
duty
*NL*
to
assure
Pierre
that
he
was
greatly
afflicted
by
the
death
of
the
*NL*
father
he
had
hardly
known
-RRB-
,
and
her
melancholy
was
just
like
the
august
*NL*
melancholy
she
showed
at
the
mention
of
her
most
august
Majesty
the
*NL*
Empress
Marya
Fedorovna
.
Pierre
felt
flattered
by
this
.
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
arranged
the
different
groups
in
her
drawing
room
with
her
habitual
*NL*
skill
.
The
large
group
,
in
which
were
Prince
Vasili
and
the
generals
,
*NL*
had
the
benefit
of
the
diplomat
.
Another
group
was
at
the
tea
table
.
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
join
the
former
,
but
Anna
Pavlovna
--
who
was
in
the
*NL*
excited
condition
of
a
commander
on
a
battlefield
to
whom
thousands
of
*NL*
new
and
brilliant
ideas
occur
which
there
is
hardly
time
to
put
in
*NL*
action
--
seeing
Pierre
,
touched
his
sleeve
with
her
finger
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
I
have
something
in
view
for
you
this
evening
.
''
-LRB-
She
*NL*
glanced
at
Helene
and
smiled
at
her
.
-RRB-
``
My
dear
Helene
,
be
charitable
to
*NL*
my
poor
aunt
who
adores
you
.
Go
and
keep
her
company
for
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
And
that
it
will
not
be
too
dull
,
here
is
the
dear
count
who
will
not
*NL*
refuse
to
accompany
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
beauty
went
to
the
aunt
,
but
Anna
Pavlovna
detained
Pierre
,
looking
*NL*
as
if
she
had
to
give
some
final
necessary
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
she
exquisite
?
''
she
said
to
Pierre
,
pointing
to
the
stately
*NL*
beauty
as
she
glided
away
.
``
And
how
she
carries
herself
!
For
so
young
a
*NL*
girl
,
such
tact
,
such
masterly
perfection
of
manner
!
It
comes
from
her
*NL*
heart
.
Happy
the
man
who
wins
her
!
With
her
the
least
worldly
of
men
*NL*
would
occupy
a
most
brilliant
position
in
society
.
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
I
*NL*
only
wanted
to
know
your
opinion
,
''
and
Anna
Pavlovna
let
Pierre
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
in
reply
,
sincerely
agreed
with
her
as
to
Helene
's
perfection
of
*NL*
manner
.
If
he
ever
thought
of
Helene
,
it
was
just
of
her
beauty
and
her
*NL*
remarkable
skill
in
appearing
silently
dignified
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
aunt
received
the
two
young
people
in
her
corner
,
but
seemed
*NL*
desirous
of
hiding
her
adoration
for
Helene
and
inclined
rather
to
show
*NL*
her
fear
of
Anna
Pavlovna
.
She
looked
at
her
niece
,
as
if
inquiring
what
*NL*
she
was
to
do
with
these
people
.
On
leaving
them
,
Anna
Pavlovna
again
*NL*
touched
Pierre
's
sleeve
,
saying
:
``
I
hope
you
wo
n't
say
that
it
is
dull
*NL*
in
my
house
again
,
''
and
she
glanced
at
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
smiled
,
with
a
look
implying
that
she
did
not
admit
the
*NL*
possibility
of
anyone
seeing
her
without
being
enchanted
.
The
aunt
*NL*
coughed
,
swallowed
,
and
said
in
French
that
she
was
very
pleased
to
see
*NL*
Helene
,
then
she
turned
to
Pierre
with
the
same
words
of
welcome
and
the
*NL*
same
look
.
In
the
middle
of
a
dull
and
halting
conversation
,
Helene
*NL*
turned
to
Pierre
with
the
beautiful
bright
smile
that
she
gave
to
*NL*
everyone
.
Pierre
was
so
used
to
that
smile
,
and
it
had
so
little
meaning
*NL*
for
him
,
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
it
.
The
aunt
was
just
speaking
of
*NL*
a
collection
of
snuffboxes
that
had
belonged
to
Pierre
's
father
,
Count
*NL*
Bezukhov
,
and
showed
them
her
own
box
.
Princess
Helene
asked
to
see
the
*NL*
portrait
of
the
aunt
's
husband
on
the
box
lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
probably
the
work
of
Vinesse
,
''
said
Pierre
,
mentioning
a
*NL*
celebrated
miniaturist
,
and
he
leaned
over
the
table
to
take
the
*NL*
snuffbox
while
trying
to
hear
what
was
being
said
at
the
other
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
half
rose
,
meaning
to
go
round
,
but
the
aunt
handed
him
the
snuffbox
,
*NL*
passing
it
across
Helene
's
back
.
Helene
stooped
forward
to
make
room
,
*NL*
and
looked
round
with
a
smile
.
She
was
,
as
always
at
evening
parties
,
*NL*
wearing
a
dress
such
as
was
then
fashionable
,
cut
very
low
at
front
and
*NL*
back
.
Her
bust
,
which
had
always
seemed
like
marble
to
Pierre
,
was
so
*NL*
close
to
him
that
his
shortsighted
eyes
could
not
but
perceive
the
*NL*
living
charm
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
,
so
near
to
his
lips
that
he
need
*NL*
only
have
bent
his
head
a
little
to
have
touched
them
.
He
was
conscious
*NL*
of
the
warmth
of
her
body
,
the
scent
of
perfume
,
and
the
creaking
of
her
*NL*
corset
as
she
moved
.
He
did
not
see
her
marble
beauty
forming
a
complete
*NL*
whole
with
her
dress
,
but
all
the
charm
of
her
body
only
covered
by
her
*NL*
garments
.
And
having
once
seen
this
he
could
not
help
being
aware
of
it
,
*NL*
just
as
we
can
not
renew
an
illusion
we
have
once
seen
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
never
noticed
before
how
beautiful
I
am
?
''
Helene
seemed
to
*NL*
say
.
``
You
had
not
noticed
that
I
am
a
woman
?
Yes
,
I
am
a
woman
who
may
*NL*
belong
to
anyone
--
to
you
too
,
''
said
her
glance
.
And
at
that
moment
*NL*
Pierre
felt
that
Helene
not
only
could
,
but
must
,
be
his
wife
,
and
that
*NL*
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
this
at
that
moment
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
standing
at
the
*NL*
altar
with
her
.
How
and
when
this
would
be
he
did
not
know
,
he
did
not
*NL*
even
know
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
-LRB-
he
even
felt
,
he
knew
not
why
,
*NL*
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
-RRB-
,
but
he
knew
it
would
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
dropped
his
eyes
,
lifted
them
again
,
and
wished
once
more
to
see
*NL*
her
as
a
distant
beauty
far
removed
from
him
,
as
he
had
seen
her
every
*NL*
day
until
then
,
but
he
could
no
longer
do
it
.
He
could
not
,
any
more
*NL*
than
a
man
who
has
been
looking
at
a
tuft
of
steppe
grass
through
the
*NL*
mist
and
taking
it
for
a
tree
can
again
take
it
for
a
tree
after
he
has
*NL*
once
recognized
it
to
be
a
tuft
of
grass
.
She
was
terribly
close
to
him
.
*NL*
She
already
had
power
over
him
,
and
between
them
there
was
no
longer
any
*NL*
barrier
except
the
barrier
of
his
own
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
leave
you
in
your
little
corner
,
''
came
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
voice
,
``
I
see
you
are
all
right
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Pierre
,
anxiously
trying
to
remember
whether
he
had
done
anything
*NL*
reprehensible
,
looked
round
with
a
blush
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
*NL*
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
as
he
knew
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
later
when
he
went
up
to
the
large
circle
,
Anna
Pavlovna
said
*NL*
to
him
:
``
I
hear
you
are
refitting
your
Petersburg
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
true
.
The
architect
had
told
him
that
it
was
necessary
,
and
*NL*
Pierre
,
without
knowing
why
,
was
having
his
enormous
Petersburg
house
*NL*
done
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
thing
,
but
do
n't
move
from
Prince
Vasili
's
.
It
is
good
to
*NL*
have
a
friend
like
the
prince
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
at
Prince
Vasili
.
``
I
*NL*
know
something
about
that
.
Do
n't
I
?
And
you
are
still
so
young
.
You
need
*NL*
advice
.
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
for
exercising
an
old
woman
's
privilege
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
as
women
always
do
,
expecting
something
after
they
have
*NL*
mentioned
their
age
.
``
If
you
marry
it
will
be
a
different
thing
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
uniting
them
both
in
one
glance
.
Pierre
did
not
look
at
*NL*
Helene
nor
she
at
him
.
But
she
was
just
as
terribly
close
to
him
.
He
*NL*
muttered
something
and
colored
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
home
he
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
for
thinking
of
what
*NL*
had
happened
.
What
had
happened
?
Nothing
.
He
had
merely
understood
that
*NL*
the
woman
he
had
known
as
a
child
,
of
whom
when
her
beauty
was
mentioned
*NL*
he
had
said
absent-mindedly
:
``
Yes
,
she
's
good
looking
,
''
he
had
*NL*
understood
that
this
woman
might
belong
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
stupid
.
I
have
myself
said
she
is
stupid
,
''
he
thought
.
``
There
*NL*
is
something
nasty
,
something
wrong
,
in
the
feeling
she
excites
in
me
.
I
*NL*
have
been
told
that
her
brother
Anatole
was
in
love
with
her
and
she
*NL*
with
him
,
that
there
was
quite
a
scandal
and
that
that
's
why
he
was
sent
*NL*
away
.
Hippolyte
is
her
brother
...
Prince
Vasili
is
her
father
...
It
's
*NL*
bad
...
''
he
reflected
,
but
while
he
was
thinking
this
-LRB-
the
reflection
*NL*
was
still
incomplete
-RRB-
,
he
caught
himself
smiling
and
was
conscious
that
*NL*
another
line
of
thought
had
sprung
up
,
and
while
thinking
of
her
*NL*
worthlessness
he
was
also
dreaming
of
how
she
would
be
his
wife
,
how
she
*NL*
would
love
him
become
quite
different
,
and
how
all
he
had
thought
and
*NL*
heard
of
her
might
be
false
.
And
he
again
saw
her
not
as
the
daughter
of
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
,
but
visualized
her
whole
body
only
veiled
by
its
gray
*NL*
dress
.
``
But
no
!
Why
did
this
thought
never
occur
to
me
before
?
''
and
*NL*
again
he
told
himself
that
it
was
impossible
,
that
there
would
be
*NL*
something
unnatural
,
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
dishonorable
,
in
this
*NL*
marriage
.
He
recalled
her
former
words
and
looks
and
the
words
and
looks
*NL*
of
those
who
had
seen
them
together
.
He
recalled
Anna
Pavlovna
's
words
*NL*
and
looks
when
she
spoke
to
him
about
his
house
,
recalled
thousands
of
*NL*
such
hints
from
Prince
Vasili
and
others
,
and
was
seized
by
terror
lest
*NL*
he
had
already
,
in
some
way
,
bound
himself
to
do
something
that
was
*NL*
evidently
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
do
.
But
at
the
very
time
he
was
*NL*
expressing
this
conviction
to
himself
,
in
another
part
of
his
mind
her
*NL*
image
rose
in
all
its
womanly
beauty
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
In
November
,
1805
,
Prince
Vasili
had
to
go
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
*NL*
four
different
provinces
.
He
had
arranged
this
for
himself
so
as
to
*NL*
visit
his
neglected
estates
at
the
same
time
and
pick
up
his
son
Anatole
*NL*
where
his
regiment
was
stationed
,
and
take
him
to
visit
Prince
Nicholas
*NL*
Bolkonski
in
order
to
arrange
a
match
for
him
with
the
daughter
of
that
*NL*
rich
old
man
.
But
before
leaving
home
and
undertaking
these
new
affairs
,
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
had
to
settle
matters
with
Pierre
,
who
,
it
is
true
,
had
*NL*
latterly
spent
whole
days
at
home
,
that
is
,
in
Prince
Vasili
's
house
*NL*
where
he
was
staying
,
and
had
been
absurd
,
excited
,
and
foolish
in
*NL*
Helene
's
presence
-LRB-
as
a
lover
should
be
-RRB-
,
but
had
not
yet
proposed
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
very
fine
,
but
things
must
be
settled
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
to
himself
,
with
a
sorrowful
sigh
,
one
morning
,
feeling
that
Pierre
who
*NL*
was
under
such
obligations
to
him
-LRB-
``
But
never
mind
that
''
-RRB-
was
not
*NL*
behaving
very
well
in
this
matter
.
``
Youth
,
frivolity
...
well
,
God
be
*NL*
with
him
,
''
thought
he
,
relishing
his
own
goodness
of
heart
,
``
but
it
must
*NL*
be
brought
to
a
head
.
The
day
after
tomorrow
will
be
Lelya
's
name
day
.
I
*NL*
will
invite
two
or
three
people
,
and
if
he
does
not
understand
what
he
*NL*
ought
to
do
then
it
will
be
my
affair
--
yes
,
my
affair
.
I
am
her
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Six
weeks
after
Anna
Pavlovna
's
``
At
Home
''
and
after
the
sleepless
night
*NL*
when
he
had
decided
that
to
marry
Helene
would
be
a
calamity
and
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
avoid
her
and
go
away
,
Pierre
,
despite
that
decision
,
had
not
*NL*
left
Prince
Vasili
's
and
felt
with
terror
that
in
people
's
eyes
he
was
*NL*
every
day
more
and
more
connected
with
her
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
*NL*
him
to
return
to
his
former
conception
of
her
,
that
he
could
not
break
*NL*
away
from
her
,
and
that
though
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
he
would
*NL*
have
to
unite
his
fate
with
hers
.
He
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
*NL*
free
himself
but
that
Prince
Vasili
-LRB-
who
had
rarely
before
given
*NL*
receptions
-RRB-
now
hardly
let
a
day
go
by
without
having
an
evening
party
*NL*
at
which
Pierre
had
to
be
present
unless
he
wished
to
spoil
the
general
*NL*
pleasure
and
disappoint
everyone
's
expectation
.
Prince
Vasili
,
in
the
*NL*
rare
moments
when
he
was
at
home
,
would
take
Pierre
's
hand
in
passing
*NL*
and
draw
it
downwards
,
or
absent-mindedly
hold
out
his
wrinkled
,
clean
-
*NL*
shaven
cheek
for
Pierre
to
kiss
and
would
say
:
``
Till
tomorrow
,
''
or
,
``
Be
*NL*
in
to
dinner
or
I
shall
not
see
you
,
''
or
,
``
I
am
staying
in
for
your
*NL*
sake
,
''
and
so
on
.
And
though
Prince
Vasili
,
when
he
stayed
in
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
said
-RRB-
for
Pierre
's
sake
,
hardly
exchanged
a
couple
of
words
with
him
,
*NL*
Pierre
felt
unable
to
disappoint
him
.
Every
day
he
said
to
himself
one
*NL*
and
the
same
thing
:
``
It
is
time
I
understood
her
and
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
what
she
really
is
.
Was
I
mistaken
before
,
or
am
I
mistaken
now
?
No
,
she
*NL*
is
not
stupid
,
she
is
an
excellent
girl
,
''
he
sometimes
said
to
himself
*NL*
``
she
never
makes
a
mistake
,
never
says
anything
stupid
.
She
says
little
,
*NL*
but
what
she
does
say
is
always
clear
and
simple
,
so
she
is
not
stupid
.
*NL*
She
never
was
abashed
and
is
not
abashed
now
,
so
she
can
not
be
a
bad
*NL*
woman
!
''
He
had
often
begun
to
make
reflections
or
think
aloud
in
her
*NL*
company
,
and
she
had
always
answered
him
either
by
a
brief
but
*NL*
appropriate
remark
--
showing
that
it
did
not
interest
her
--
or
by
a
silent
*NL*
look
and
smile
which
more
palpably
than
anything
else
showed
Pierre
her
*NL*
superiority
.
She
was
right
in
regarding
all
arguments
as
nonsense
in
*NL*
comparison
with
that
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
addressed
him
with
a
radiantly
confiding
smile
meant
for
him
*NL*
alone
,
in
which
there
was
something
more
significant
than
in
the
general
*NL*
smile
that
usually
brightened
her
face
.
Pierre
knew
that
everyone
was
*NL*
waiting
for
him
to
say
a
word
and
cross
a
certain
line
,
and
he
knew
that
*NL*
sooner
or
later
he
would
step
across
it
,
but
an
incomprehensible
terror
*NL*
seized
him
at
the
thought
of
that
dreadful
step
.
A
thousand
times
during
*NL*
that
month
and
a
half
while
he
felt
himself
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
*NL*
that
dreadful
abyss
,
Pierre
said
to
himself
:
``
What
am
I
doing
?
I
need
*NL*
resolution
.
Can
it
be
that
I
have
none
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
to
take
a
decision
,
but
felt
with
dismay
that
in
this
matter
*NL*
he
lacked
that
strength
of
will
which
he
had
known
in
himself
and
really
*NL*
possessed
.
Pierre
was
one
of
those
who
are
only
strong
when
they
feel
*NL*
themselves
quite
innocent
,
and
since
that
day
when
he
was
overpowered
by
*NL*
a
feeling
of
desire
while
stooping
over
the
snuffbox
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
,
*NL*
an
unacknowledged
sense
of
the
guilt
of
that
desire
paralyzed
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Helene
's
name
day
,
a
small
party
of
just
their
own
people
--
as
his
*NL*
wife
said
--
met
for
supper
at
Prince
Vasili
's
.
All
these
friends
and
*NL*
relations
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
fate
of
the
young
girl
*NL*
would
be
decided
that
evening
.
The
visitors
were
seated
at
supper
.
*NL*
Princess
Kuragina
,
a
portly
imposing
woman
who
had
once
been
handsome
,
*NL*
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
.
On
either
side
of
her
sat
the
more
*NL*
important
guests
--
an
old
general
and
his
wife
,
and
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
Scherer
.
At
the
other
end
sat
the
younger
and
less
important
guests
,
and
*NL*
there
too
sat
the
members
of
the
family
,
and
Pierre
and
Helene
,
side
by
*NL*
side
.
Prince
Vasili
was
not
having
any
supper
:
he
went
round
the
table
*NL*
in
a
merry
mood
,
sitting
down
now
by
one
,
now
by
another
,
of
the
guests
.
*NL*
To
each
of
them
he
made
some
careless
and
agreeable
remark
except
to
*NL*
Pierre
and
Helene
,
whose
presence
he
seemed
not
to
notice
.
He
enlivened
*NL*
the
whole
party
.
The
wax
candles
burned
brightly
,
the
silver
and
crystal
*NL*
gleamed
,
so
did
the
ladies
'
toilets
and
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
men
's
*NL*
epaulets
;
servants
in
scarlet
liveries
moved
round
the
table
,
the
*NL*
clatter
of
plates
,
knives
,
and
glasses
mingled
with
the
animated
hum
of
*NL*
several
conversations
.
At
one
end
of
the
table
,
the
old
chamberlain
was
*NL*
heard
assuring
an
old
baroness
that
he
loved
her
passionately
,
at
which
*NL*
she
laughed
;
at
the
other
could
be
heard
the
story
of
the
misfortunes
of
*NL*
some
Mary
Viktorovna
or
other
.
At
the
center
of
the
table
,
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
attracted
everybody
's
attention
.
With
a
facetious
smile
on
his
face
,
he
*NL*
was
telling
the
ladies
about
last
Wednesday
's
meeting
of
the
Imperial
*NL*
Council
,
at
which
Sergey
Kuzmich
Vyazmitinov
,
the
new
military
governor
*NL*
general
of
Petersburg
,
had
received
and
read
the
then
famous
rescript
of
*NL*
the
Emperor
Alexander
from
the
army
to
Sergey
Kuzmich
,
in
which
the
*NL*
Emperor
said
that
he
was
receiving
from
all
sides
declarations
of
the
*NL*
people
's
loyalty
,
that
the
declaration
from
Petersburg
gave
him
*NL*
particular
pleasure
,
and
that
he
was
proud
to
be
at
the
head
of
such
a
*NL*
nation
and
would
endeavor
to
be
worthy
of
it
.
This
rescript
began
with
*NL*
the
words
:
``
Sergey
Kuzmich
,
From
all
sides
reports
reach
me
,
''
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
so
he
never
got
farther
than
:
`
Sergey
Kuzmich
'
?
''
asked
one
of
*NL*
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
not
a
hair
's
breadth
farther
,
''
answered
Prince
Vasili
,
*NL*
laughing
,
''
`
Sergey
Kuzmich
...
From
all
sides
...
From
all
sides
...
Sergey
*NL*
Kuzmich
...
'
Poor
Vyazmitinov
could
not
get
any
farther
!
He
began
the
*NL*
rescript
again
and
again
,
but
as
soon
as
he
uttered
`
Sergey
'
he
sobbed
,
*NL*
`
Kuz-mi-ch
,
'
tears
,
and
`
From
all
sides
'
was
smothered
in
sobs
and
he
*NL*
could
get
no
farther
.
And
again
his
handkerchief
,
and
again
:
`
Sergey
*NL*
Kuzmich
,
From
all
sides
,
'
...
and
tears
,
till
at
last
somebody
else
was
*NL*
asked
to
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kuzmich
...
From
all
sides
...
and
then
tears
,
''
someone
repeated
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
unkind
,
''
cried
Anna
Pavlovna
from
her
end
of
the
table
holding
*NL*
up
a
threatening
finger
.
``
He
is
such
a
worthy
and
excellent
man
,
our
*NL*
dear
Vyazmitinov
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
laughed
a
great
deal
.
At
the
head
of
the
table
,
where
the
*NL*
honored
guests
sat
,
everyone
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
a
variety
of
exciting
sensations
.
Only
Pierre
and
Helene
*NL*
sat
silently
side
by
side
almost
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
a
*NL*
suppressed
smile
brightening
both
their
faces
,
a
smile
that
had
nothing
*NL*
to
do
with
Sergey
Kuzmich
--
a
smile
of
bashfulness
at
their
own
feelings
.
*NL*
But
much
as
all
the
rest
laughed
,
talked
,
and
joked
,
much
as
they
*NL*
enjoyed
their
Rhine
wine
,
saute
,
and
ices
,
and
however
they
avoided
*NL*
looking
at
the
young
couple
,
and
heedless
and
unobservant
as
they
seemed
*NL*
of
them
,
one
could
feel
by
the
occasional
glances
they
gave
that
the
*NL*
story
about
Sergey
Kuzmich
,
the
laughter
,
and
the
food
were
all
a
*NL*
pretense
,
and
that
the
whole
attention
of
that
company
was
directed
to
--
*NL*
Pierre
and
Helene
.
Prince
Vasili
mimicked
the
sobbing
of
Sergey
Kuzmich
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
his
eyes
glanced
toward
his
daughter
,
and
while
he
*NL*
laughed
the
expression
on
his
face
clearly
said
:
``
Yes
...
it
's
getting
*NL*
on
,
it
will
all
be
settled
today
.
''
Anna
Pavlovna
threatened
him
on
*NL*
behalf
of
``
our
dear
Vyazmitinov
,
''
and
in
her
eyes
,
which
,
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
glanced
at
Pierre
,
Prince
Vasili
read
a
congratulation
on
his
*NL*
future
son-in-law
and
on
his
daughter
's
happiness
.
The
old
princess
*NL*
sighed
sadly
as
she
offered
some
wine
to
the
old
lady
next
to
her
and
*NL*
glanced
angrily
at
her
daughter
,
and
her
sigh
seemed
to
say
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
there
's
nothing
left
for
you
and
me
but
to
sip
sweet
wine
,
my
dear
,
now
*NL*
that
the
time
has
come
for
these
young
ones
to
be
thus
boldly
,
*NL*
provocatively
happy
.
''
``
And
what
nonsense
all
this
is
that
I
am
saying
!
''
*NL*
thought
a
diplomatist
,
glancing
at
the
happy
faces
of
the
lovers
.
*NL*
``
That
's
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Into
the
insignificant
,
trifling
,
and
artificial
interests
uniting
that
*NL*
society
had
entered
the
simple
feeling
of
the
attraction
of
a
healthy
*NL*
and
handsome
young
man
and
woman
for
one
another
.
And
this
human
feeling
*NL*
dominated
everything
else
and
soared
above
all
their
affected
chatter
.
*NL*
Jests
fell
flat
,
news
was
not
interesting
,
and
the
animation
was
*NL*
evidently
forced
.
Not
only
the
guests
but
even
the
footmen
waiting
at
*NL*
table
seemed
to
feel
this
,
and
they
forgot
their
duties
as
they
looked
*NL*
at
the
beautiful
Helene
with
her
radiant
face
and
at
the
red
,
broad
,
and
*NL*
happy
though
uneasy
face
of
Pierre
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
very
light
of
*NL*
the
candles
was
focused
on
those
two
happy
faces
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
felt
that
he
was
the
center
of
it
all
,
and
this
both
pleased
and
*NL*
embarrassed
him
.
He
was
like
a
man
entirely
absorbed
in
some
occupation
.
*NL*
He
did
not
see
,
hear
,
or
understand
anything
clearly
.
Only
now
and
then
*NL*
detached
ideas
and
impressions
from
the
world
of
reality
shot
*NL*
unexpectedly
through
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
all
finished
!
''
he
thought
.
``
And
how
has
it
all
happened
?
How
*NL*
quickly
!
Now
I
know
that
not
because
of
her
alone
,
nor
of
myself
alone
,
*NL*
but
because
of
everyone
,
it
must
inevitably
come
about
.
They
are
all
*NL*
expecting
it
,
they
are
so
sure
that
it
will
happen
that
I
can
not
,
I
*NL*
can
not
,
disappoint
them
.
But
how
will
it
be
?
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
will
*NL*
certainly
happen
!
''
thought
Pierre
,
glancing
at
those
dazzling
shoulders
*NL*
close
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
he
would
suddenly
feel
ashamed
of
he
knew
not
what
.
He
felt
it
*NL*
awkward
to
attract
everyone
's
attention
and
to
be
considered
a
lucky
man
*NL*
and
,
with
his
plain
face
,
to
be
looked
on
as
a
sort
of
Paris
possessed
*NL*
of
a
Helen
.
``
But
no
doubt
it
always
is
and
must
be
so
!
''
he
consoled
*NL*
himself
.
``
And
besides
,
what
have
I
done
to
bring
it
about
?
How
did
it
*NL*
begin
?
I
traveled
from
Moscow
with
Prince
Vasili
.
Then
there
was
*NL*
nothing
.
So
why
should
I
not
stay
at
his
house
?
Then
I
played
cards
with
*NL*
her
and
picked
up
her
reticule
and
drove
out
with
her
.
How
did
it
begin
,
*NL*
when
did
it
all
come
about
?
''
And
here
he
was
sitting
by
her
side
as
her
*NL*
betrothed
,
seeing
,
hearing
,
feeling
her
nearness
,
her
breathing
,
her
*NL*
movements
,
her
beauty
.
Then
it
would
suddenly
seem
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
not
she
but
he
was
so
unusually
beautiful
,
and
that
that
was
why
they
*NL*
all
looked
so
at
him
,
and
flattered
by
this
general
admiration
he
would
*NL*
expand
his
chest
,
raise
his
head
,
and
rejoice
at
his
good
fortune
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
repeating
something
to
him
a
second
*NL*
time
.
But
Pierre
was
so
absorbed
that
he
did
not
understand
what
was
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
asking
you
when
you
last
heard
from
Bolkonski
,
''
repeated
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
a
third
time
.
``
How
absent-minded
you
are
,
my
dear
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
smiled
,
and
Pierre
noticed
that
everyone
was
smiling
at
*NL*
him
and
Helene
.
``
Well
,
what
of
it
,
if
you
all
know
it
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
It
's
the
truth
!
''
and
he
himself
smiled
his
gentle
childlike
*NL*
smile
,
and
Helene
smiled
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
get
the
letter
?
Was
it
from
Olmutz
?
''
repeated
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
who
pretended
to
want
to
know
this
in
order
to
settle
a
dispute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
one
talk
or
think
of
such
trifles
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
from
Olmutz
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
Pierre
with
his
partner
followed
the
others
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
.
The
guests
began
to
disperse
,
some
without
taking
leave
of
*NL*
Helene
.
Some
,
as
if
unwilling
to
distract
her
from
an
important
*NL*
occupation
,
came
up
to
her
for
a
moment
and
made
haste
to
go
away
,
*NL*
refusing
to
let
her
see
them
off
.
The
diplomatist
preserved
a
mournful
*NL*
silence
as
he
left
the
drawing
room
.
He
pictured
the
vanity
of
his
*NL*
diplomatic
career
in
comparison
with
Pierre
's
happiness
.
The
old
general
*NL*
grumbled
at
his
wife
when
she
asked
how
his
leg
was
.
``
Oh
,
the
old
fool
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
``
That
Princess
Helene
will
be
beautiful
still
when
she
's
*NL*
fifty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
may
congratulate
you
,
''
whispered
Anna
Pavlovna
to
the
old
*NL*
princess
,
kissing
her
soundly
.
``
If
I
had
n't
this
headache
I
'd
have
*NL*
stayed
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
princess
did
not
reply
,
she
was
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
*NL*
daughter
's
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
guests
were
taking
their
leave
Pierre
remained
for
a
long
time
*NL*
alone
with
Helene
in
the
little
drawing
room
where
they
were
sitting
.
He
*NL*
had
often
before
,
during
the
last
six
weeks
,
remained
alone
with
her
,
*NL*
but
had
never
spoken
to
her
of
love
.
Now
he
felt
that
it
was
inevitable
,
*NL*
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
the
final
step
.
He
felt
*NL*
ashamed
;
he
felt
that
he
was
occupying
someone
else
's
place
here
beside
*NL*
Helene
.
``
This
happiness
is
not
for
you
,
''
some
inner
voice
whispered
to
*NL*
him
.
``
This
happiness
is
for
those
who
have
not
in
them
what
there
is
in
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
he
had
to
say
something
,
he
began
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
party
.
She
replied
in
her
usual
simple
manner
that
*NL*
this
name
day
of
hers
had
been
one
of
the
pleasantest
she
had
ever
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
nearest
relatives
had
not
yet
left
.
They
were
sitting
in
the
*NL*
large
drawing
room
.
Prince
Vasili
came
up
to
Pierre
with
languid
*NL*
footsteps
.
Pierre
rose
and
said
it
was
getting
late
.
Prince
Vasili
gave
*NL*
him
a
look
of
stern
inquiry
,
as
though
what
Pierre
had
just
said
was
so
*NL*
strange
that
one
could
not
take
it
in
.
But
then
the
expression
of
*NL*
severity
changed
,
and
he
drew
Pierre
's
hand
downwards
,
made
him
sit
*NL*
down
,
and
smiled
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Lelya
?
''
he
asked
,
turning
instantly
to
his
daughter
and
*NL*
addressing
her
with
the
careless
tone
of
habitual
tenderness
natural
to
*NL*
parents
who
have
petted
their
children
from
babyhood
,
but
which
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
had
only
acquired
by
imitating
other
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
again
turned
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergey
Kuzmich
--
From
all
sides
-
''
he
said
,
unbuttoning
the
top
button
of
*NL*
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
smiled
,
but
his
smile
showed
that
he
knew
it
was
not
the
story
*NL*
about
Sergey
Kuzmich
that
interested
Prince
Vasili
just
then
,
and
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
saw
that
Pierre
knew
this
.
He
suddenly
muttered
something
and
*NL*
went
away
.
It
seemed
to
Pierre
that
even
the
prince
was
disconcerted
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
discomposure
of
that
old
man
of
the
world
touched
*NL*
Pierre
:
he
looked
at
Helene
and
she
too
seemed
disconcerted
,
and
her
*NL*
look
seemed
to
say
:
``
Well
,
it
is
your
own
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
step
must
be
taken
but
I
can
not
,
I
can
not
!
''
thought
Pierre
,
and
he
*NL*
again
began
speaking
about
indifferent
matters
,
about
Sergey
Kuzmich
,
*NL*
asking
what
the
point
of
the
story
was
as
he
had
not
heard
it
properly
.
*NL*
Helene
answered
with
a
smile
that
she
too
had
missed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Prince
Vasili
returned
to
the
drawing
room
,
the
princess
,
his
wife
,
*NL*
was
talking
in
low
tones
to
the
elderly
lady
about
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
it
is
a
very
brilliant
match
,
but
happiness
,
my
dear
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marriages
are
made
in
heaven
,
''
replied
the
elderly
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
passed
by
,
seeming
not
to
hear
the
ladies
,
and
sat
down
on
*NL*
a
sofa
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
.
He
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
dozing
.
His
head
sank
forward
and
then
he
roused
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aline
,
''
he
said
to
his
wife
,
``
go
and
see
what
they
are
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
went
up
to
the
door
,
passed
by
it
with
a
dignified
and
*NL*
indifferent
air
,
and
glanced
into
the
little
drawing
room
.
Pierre
and
*NL*
Helene
still
sat
talking
just
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
the
same
,
''
she
said
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
frowned
,
twisting
his
mouth
,
his
cheeks
quivered
and
his
*NL*
face
assumed
the
coarse
,
unpleasant
expression
peculiar
to
him
.
Shaking
*NL*
himself
,
he
rose
,
threw
back
his
head
,
and
with
resolute
steps
went
past
*NL*
the
ladies
into
the
little
drawing
room
.
With
quick
steps
he
went
*NL*
joyfully
up
to
Pierre
.
His
face
was
so
unusually
triumphant
that
Pierre
*NL*
rose
in
alarm
on
seeing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
said
Prince
Vasili
.
``
My
wife
has
told
me
everything
!
''
-LRB-
He
*NL*
put
one
arm
around
Pierre
and
the
other
around
his
daughter
.
-RRB-
--
``
My
dear
*NL*
boy
...
Lelya
...
I
am
very
pleased
.
''
-LRB-
His
voice
trembled
.
-RRB-
``
I
loved
your
*NL*
father
...
and
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife
...
God
bless
you
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
embraced
his
daughter
,
and
then
again
Pierre
,
and
kissed
him
with
his
*NL*
malodorous
mouth
.
Tears
actually
moistened
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
come
here
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
princess
came
in
and
also
wept
.
The
elderly
lady
was
using
her
*NL*
handkerchief
too
.
Pierre
was
kissed
,
and
he
kissed
the
beautiful
*NL*
Helene
's
hand
several
times
.
After
a
while
they
were
left
alone
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
had
to
be
and
could
not
be
otherwise
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
``
so
it
*NL*
is
useless
to
ask
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
.
It
is
good
because
it
's
*NL*
definite
and
one
is
rid
of
the
old
tormenting
doubt
.
''
Pierre
held
the
*NL*
hand
of
his
betrothed
in
silence
,
looking
at
her
beautiful
bosom
as
it
*NL*
rose
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helene
!
''
he
said
aloud
and
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
special
is
always
said
in
such
cases
,
''
he
thought
,
but
could
*NL*
not
remember
what
it
was
that
people
say
.
He
looked
at
her
face
.
She
*NL*
drew
nearer
to
him
.
Her
face
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
take
those
off
...
those
...
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
them
off
,
and
his
eyes
,
besides
the
strange
look
eyes
have
*NL*
from
which
spectacles
have
just
been
removed
,
had
also
a
frightened
and
*NL*
inquiring
look
.
He
was
about
to
stoop
over
her
hand
and
kiss
it
,
but
*NL*
with
a
rapid
,
almost
brutal
movement
of
her
head
,
she
intercepted
his
*NL*
lips
and
met
them
with
her
own
.
Her
face
struck
Pierre
,
by
its
altered
,
*NL*
unpleasantly
excited
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
now
,
it
's
done
;
besides
I
love
her
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
vous
aime
!
''
*
he
said
,
remembering
what
has
to
be
said
at
such
*NL*
moments
:
but
his
words
sounded
so
weak
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Six
weeks
later
he
was
married
,
and
settled
in
Count
Bezukhov
's
large
,
*NL*
newly
furnished
Petersburg
house
,
the
happy
possessor
,
as
people
said
,
*NL*
of
a
wife
who
was
a
celebrated
beauty
and
of
millions
of
money

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
received
a
letter
from
Prince
Vasili
in
*NL*
November
,
1805
,
announcing
that
he
and
his
son
would
be
paying
him
a
*NL*
visit
.
``
I
am
starting
on
a
journey
of
inspection
,
and
of
course
I
shall
*NL*
think
nothing
of
an
extra
seventy
miles
to
come
and
see
you
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
my
honored
benefactor
,
''
wrote
Prince
Vasili
.
``
My
son
Anatole
is
*NL*
accompanying
me
on
his
way
to
the
army
,
so
I
hope
you
will
allow
him
*NL*
personally
to
express
the
deep
respect
that
,
emulating
his
father
,
he
*NL*
feels
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
that
there
will
be
no
need
to
bring
Mary
out
,
suitors
are
*NL*
coming
to
us
of
their
own
accord
,
''
incautiously
remarked
the
little
*NL*
princess
on
hearing
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Nicholas
frowned
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fortnight
after
the
letter
Prince
Vasili
's
servants
came
one
evening
*NL*
in
advance
of
him
,
and
he
and
his
son
arrived
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Bolkonski
had
always
had
a
poor
opinion
of
Prince
Vasili
's
*NL*
character
,
but
more
so
recently
,
since
in
the
new
reigns
of
Paul
and
*NL*
Alexander
Prince
Vasili
had
risen
to
high
position
and
honors
.
And
now
,
*NL*
from
the
hints
contained
in
his
letter
and
given
by
the
little
princess
,
*NL*
he
saw
which
way
the
wind
was
blowing
,
and
his
low
opinion
changed
into
*NL*
a
feeling
of
contemptuous
ill
will
.
He
snorted
whenever
he
mentioned
*NL*
him
.
On
the
day
of
Prince
Vasili
's
arrival
,
Prince
Bolkonski
was
*NL*
particularly
discontented
and
out
of
temper
.
Whether
he
was
in
a
bad
*NL*
temper
because
Prince
Vasili
was
coming
,
or
whether
his
being
in
a
bad
*NL*
temper
made
him
specially
annoyed
at
Prince
Vasili
's
visit
,
he
was
in
a
*NL*
bad
temper
,
and
in
the
morning
Tikhon
had
already
advised
the
architect
*NL*
not
to
go
to
the
prince
with
his
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
how
he
's
walking
?
''
said
Tikhon
,
drawing
the
architect
's
*NL*
attention
to
the
sound
of
the
prince
's
footsteps
.
``
Stepping
flat
on
his
*NL*
heels
--
we
know
what
that
means
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
at
nine
o'clock
the
prince
,
in
his
velvet
coat
with
a
sable
*NL*
collar
and
cap
,
went
out
for
his
usual
walk
.
It
had
snowed
the
day
*NL*
before
and
the
path
to
the
hothouse
,
along
which
the
prince
was
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
walking
,
had
been
swept
:
the
marks
of
the
broom
were
still
*NL*
visible
in
the
snow
and
a
shovel
had
been
left
sticking
in
one
of
the
*NL*
soft
snowbanks
that
bordered
both
sides
of
the
path
.
The
prince
went
*NL*
through
the
conservatories
,
the
serfs
'
quarters
,
and
the
outbuildings
,
*NL*
frowning
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
a
sleigh
pass
?
''
he
asked
his
overseer
,
a
venerable
man
,
resembling
*NL*
his
master
in
manners
and
looks
,
who
was
accompanying
him
back
to
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
snow
is
deep
.
I
am
having
the
avenue
swept
,
your
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
bowed
his
head
and
went
up
to
the
porch
.
``
God
be
thanked
,
''
*NL*
thought
the
overseer
,
``
the
storm
has
blown
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
hard
to
drive
up
,
your
honor
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
heard
,
*NL*
your
honor
,
that
a
minister
is
coming
to
visit
your
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
turned
round
to
the
overseer
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
,
*NL*
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
A
minister
?
What
minister
?
Who
gave
orders
?
''
he
said
in
his
*NL*
shrill
,
harsh
voice
.
``
The
road
is
not
swept
for
the
princess
my
*NL*
daughter
,
but
for
a
minister
!
For
me
,
there
are
no
ministers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
I
thought
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
!
''
shouted
the
prince
,
his
words
coming
more
and
more
*NL*
rapidly
and
indistinctly
.
``
You
thought
!
...
Rascals
!
Blackguards
!
...
I
'll
*NL*
teach
you
to
think
!
''
and
lifting
his
stick
he
swung
it
and
would
have
*NL*
hit
Alpatych
,
the
overseer
,
had
not
the
latter
instinctively
avoided
the
*NL*
blow
.
``
Thought
...
Blackguards
...
''
shouted
the
prince
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
Alpatych
,
frightened
at
his
own
temerity
in
avoiding
the
*NL*
stroke
,
came
up
to
the
prince
,
bowing
his
bald
head
resignedly
before
*NL*
him
,
or
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
,
the
prince
,
though
he
continued
to
*NL*
shout
:
``
Blackguards
!
...
Throw
the
snow
back
on
the
road
!
''
did
not
lift
*NL*
his
stick
again
but
hurried
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
dinner
,
Princess
Mary
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
who
knew
that
*NL*
the
prince
was
in
a
bad
humor
,
stood
awaiting
him
;
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
with
a
radiant
face
that
said
:
``
I
know
nothing
,
I
am
the
same
*NL*
as
usual
,
''
and
Princess
Mary
pale
,
frightened
,
and
with
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
What
she
found
hardest
to
bear
was
to
know
that
on
such
occasions
she
*NL*
ought
to
behave
like
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
but
could
not
.
She
thought
:
*NL*
``
If
I
seem
not
to
notice
he
will
think
that
I
do
not
sympathize
with
*NL*
him
;
if
I
seem
sad
and
out
of
spirits
myself
,
he
will
say
-LRB-
as
he
has
*NL*
done
before
-RRB-
that
I
'm
in
the
dumps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
looked
at
his
daughter
's
frightened
face
and
snorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
...
or
dummy
!
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
other
one
is
not
here
.
They
've
been
telling
tales
,
''
he
thought
-
*NL*
-
referring
to
the
little
princess
who
was
not
in
the
dining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
princess
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Hiding
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
very
well
,
''
answered
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
with
a
bright
*NL*
smile
,
``
so
she
wo
n't
come
down
.
It
is
natural
in
her
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
Hm
!
''
muttered
the
prince
,
sitting
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
plate
seemed
to
him
not
quite
clean
,
and
pointing
to
a
spot
he
flung
*NL*
it
away
.
Tikhon
caught
it
and
handed
it
to
a
footman
.
The
little
*NL*
princess
was
not
unwell
,
but
had
such
an
overpowering
fear
of
the
prince
*NL*
that
,
hearing
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
,
she
had
decided
not
to
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
for
the
baby
,
''
she
said
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
:
``
Heaven
*NL*
knows
what
a
fright
might
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
general
at
Bald
Hills
the
little
princess
lived
in
constant
fear
,
and
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
antipathy
to
the
old
prince
which
she
did
not
realize
*NL*
because
the
fear
was
so
much
the
stronger
feeling
.
The
prince
*NL*
reciprocated
this
antipathy
,
but
it
was
overpowered
by
his
contempt
for
*NL*
her
.
When
the
little
princess
had
grown
accustomed
to
life
at
Bald
*NL*
Hills
,
she
took
a
special
fancy
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
spent
whole
*NL*
days
with
her
,
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
,
and
often
talked
with
her
*NL*
about
the
old
prince
and
criticized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
are
to
have
visitors
,
mon
prince
?
''
remarked
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
,
unfolding
her
white
napkin
with
her
rosy
fingers
.
``
His
*NL*
Excellency
Prince
Vasili
Kuragin
and
his
son
,
I
understand
?
''
she
said
*NL*
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
--
his
excellency
is
a
puppy
...
I
got
him
his
appointment
in
the
*NL*
service
,
''
said
the
prince
disdainfully
.
``
Why
his
son
is
coming
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
.
Perhaps
Princess
Elizabeth
and
Princess
Mary
know
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
him
.
''
-LRB-
He
looked
at
his
blushing
daughter
.
-RRB-
``
Are
you
unwell
today
?
*NL*
Eh
?
Afraid
of
the
`
minister
'
as
that
idiot
Alpatych
called
him
this
*NL*
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mon
pere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
been
so
unsuccessful
in
her
choice
of
*NL*
a
subject
,
she
did
not
stop
talking
,
but
chattered
about
the
*NL*
conservatories
and
the
beauty
of
a
flower
that
had
just
opened
,
and
*NL*
after
the
soup
the
prince
became
more
genial
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
he
went
to
see
his
daughter-in-law
.
The
little
princess
*NL*
was
sitting
at
a
small
table
,
chattering
with
Masha
,
her
maid
.
She
grew
*NL*
pale
on
seeing
her
father-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
much
altered
.
She
was
now
plain
rather
than
pretty
.
Her
cheeks
*NL*
had
sunk
,
her
lip
was
drawn
up
,
and
her
eyes
drawn
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
feel
a
kind
of
oppression
,
''
she
said
in
reply
to
the
prince
's
*NL*
question
as
to
how
she
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
merci
,
mon
pere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
waiting
room
where
Alpatych
stood
with
*NL*
bowed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
snow
been
shoveled
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
.
Forgive
me
for
heaven
's
sake
...
It
was
only
my
*NL*
stupidity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
interrupted
the
prince
,
and
laughing
his
*NL*
unnatural
way
,
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
Alpatych
to
kiss
,
and
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
arrived
that
evening
.
He
was
met
in
the
avenue
by
coachmen
*NL*
and
footmen
,
who
,
with
loud
shouts
,
dragged
his
sleighs
up
to
one
of
the
*NL*
lodges
over
the
road
purposely
laden
with
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
and
Anatole
had
separate
rooms
assigned
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
,
having
taken
off
his
overcoat
,
sat
with
arms
akimbo
before
a
*NL*
table
on
a
corner
of
which
he
smilingly
and
absent-mindedly
fixed
his
*NL*
large
and
handsome
eyes
.
He
regarded
his
whole
life
as
a
continual
round
*NL*
of
amusement
which
someone
for
some
reason
had
to
provide
for
him
.
And
*NL*
he
looked
on
this
visit
to
a
churlish
old
man
and
a
rich
and
ugly
*NL*
heiress
in
the
same
way
.
All
this
might
,
he
thought
,
turn
out
very
well
*NL*
and
amusingly
.
``
And
why
not
marry
her
if
she
really
has
so
much
money
?
*NL*
That
never
does
any
harm
,
''
thought
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shaved
and
scented
himself
with
the
care
and
elegance
which
had
*NL*
become
habitual
to
him
and
,
his
handsome
head
held
high
,
entered
his
*NL*
father
's
room
with
the
good-humored
and
victorious
air
natural
to
him
.
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
's
two
valets
were
busy
dressing
him
,
and
he
looked
round
*NL*
with
much
animation
and
cheerfully
nodded
to
his
son
as
the
latter
*NL*
entered
,
as
if
to
say
:
``
Yes
,
that
's
how
I
want
you
to
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Father
,
joking
apart
,
is
she
very
hideous
?
''
Anatole
asked
,
as
if
*NL*
continuing
a
conversation
the
subject
of
which
had
often
been
mentioned
*NL*
during
the
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
!
What
nonsense
!
Above
all
,
try
to
be
respectful
and
cautious
*NL*
with
the
old
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
starts
a
row
I
'll
go
away
,
''
said
Prince
Anatole
.
``
I
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
those
old
men
!
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
for
you
everything
depends
on
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
not
only
was
it
known
in
the
maidservants
'
rooms
that
*NL*
the
minister
and
his
son
had
arrived
,
but
the
appearance
of
both
had
*NL*
been
minutely
described
.
Princess
Mary
was
sitting
alone
in
her
room
,
*NL*
vainly
trying
to
master
her
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
they
write
,
why
did
Lise
tell
me
about
it
?
It
can
never
*NL*
happen
!
''
she
said
,
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
``
How
shall
I
enter
*NL*
the
drawing
room
?
Even
if
I
like
him
I
ca
n't
now
be
myself
with
him
.
''
*NL*
The
mere
thought
of
her
father
's
look
filled
her
with
terror
.
The
little
*NL*
princess
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
already
received
from
Masha
,
the
*NL*
lady
's
maid
,
the
necessary
report
of
how
handsome
the
minister
's
son
*NL*
was
,
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
dark
eyebrows
,
and
with
what
difficulty
*NL*
the
father
had
dragged
his
legs
upstairs
while
the
son
had
followed
him
*NL*
like
an
eagle
,
three
steps
at
a
time
.
Having
received
this
information
,
*NL*
the
little
princess
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
whose
chattering
voices
*NL*
had
reached
her
from
the
corridor
,
went
into
Princess
Mary
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
they
've
come
,
Marie
?
''
said
the
little
princess
,
waddling
in
,
*NL*
and
sinking
heavily
into
an
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
longer
in
the
loose
gown
she
generally
wore
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
but
had
on
one
of
her
best
dresses
.
Her
hair
was
carefully
done
and
her
*NL*
face
was
animated
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
conceal
its
sunken
and
faded
*NL*
outlines
.
Dressed
as
she
used
to
be
in
Petersburg
society
,
it
was
still
*NL*
more
noticeable
how
much
plainer
she
had
become
.
Some
unobtrusive
touch
*NL*
had
been
added
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
toilet
which
rendered
her
*NL*
fresh
and
pretty
face
yet
more
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Are
you
going
to
remain
as
you
are
,
dear
princess
?
''
she
began
.
*NL*
``
They
'll
be
announcing
that
the
gentlemen
are
in
the
drawing
room
and
we
*NL*
shall
have
to
go
down
,
and
you
have
not
smartened
yourself
up
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
got
up
,
rang
for
the
maid
,
and
hurriedly
and
merrily
*NL*
began
to
devise
and
carry
out
a
plan
of
how
Princess
Mary
should
be
*NL*
dressed
.
Princess
Mary
's
self-esteem
was
wounded
by
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
arrival
of
a
suitor
agitated
her
,
and
still
more
so
by
both
her
*NL*
companions
'
not
having
the
least
conception
that
it
could
be
otherwise
.
*NL*
To
tell
them
that
she
felt
ashamed
for
herself
and
for
them
would
be
to
*NL*
betray
her
agitation
,
while
to
decline
their
offers
to
dress
her
would
*NL*
prolong
their
banter
and
insistence
.
She
flushed
,
her
beautiful
eyes
*NL*
grew
dim
,
red
blotches
came
on
her
face
,
and
it
took
on
the
unattractive
*NL*
martyrlike
expression
it
so
often
wore
,
as
she
submitted
herself
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
Lise
.
Both
these
women
quite
sincerely
tried
*NL*
to
make
her
look
pretty
.
She
was
so
plain
that
neither
of
them
could
*NL*
think
of
her
as
a
rival
,
so
they
began
dressing
her
with
perfect
*NL*
sincerity
,
and
with
the
naive
and
firm
conviction
women
have
that
dress
*NL*
can
make
a
face
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
really
,
my
dear
,
this
dress
is
not
pretty
,
''
said
Lise
,
looking
*NL*
sideways
at
Princess
Mary
from
a
little
distance
.
``
You
have
a
maroon
*NL*
dress
,
have
it
fetched
.
Really
!
You
know
the
fate
of
your
whole
life
may
*NL*
be
at
stake
.
But
this
one
is
too
light
,
it
's
not
becoming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
dress
,
but
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
Princess
Mary
*NL*
that
was
not
pretty
,
but
neither
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
nor
the
little
*NL*
princess
felt
this
;
they
still
thought
that
if
a
blue
ribbon
were
placed
*NL*
in
the
hair
,
the
hair
combed
up
,
and
the
blue
scarf
arranged
lower
on
*NL*
the
best
maroon
dress
,
and
so
on
,
all
would
be
well
.
They
forgot
that
*NL*
the
frightened
face
and
the
figure
could
not
be
altered
,
and
that
*NL*
however
they
might
change
the
setting
and
adornment
of
that
face
,
it
*NL*
would
still
remain
piteous
and
plain
.
After
two
or
three
changes
to
*NL*
which
Princess
Mary
meekly
submitted
,
just
as
her
hair
had
been
arranged
*NL*
on
the
top
of
her
head
-LRB-
a
style
that
quite
altered
and
spoiled
her
*NL*
looks
-RRB-
and
she
had
put
on
a
maroon
dress
with
a
pale-blue
scarf
,
the
*NL*
little
princess
walked
twice
round
her
,
now
adjusting
a
fold
of
the
*NL*
dress
with
her
little
hand
,
now
arranging
the
scarf
and
looking
at
her
*NL*
with
her
head
bent
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
will
not
do
,
''
she
said
decidedly
,
clasping
her
hands
.
``
No
,
Mary
,
*NL*
really
this
dress
does
not
suit
you
.
I
prefer
you
in
your
little
gray
*NL*
everyday
dress
.
Now
please
,
do
it
for
my
sake
.
Katie
,
''
she
said
to
the
*NL*
maid
,
``
bring
the
princess
her
gray
dress
,
and
you
'll
see
,
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
,
how
I
shall
arrange
it
,
''
she
added
,
smiling
with
a
foretaste
*NL*
of
artistic
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Katie
brought
the
required
dress
,
Princess
Mary
remained
*NL*
sitting
motionless
before
the
glass
,
looking
at
her
face
,
and
saw
in
the
*NL*
mirror
her
eyes
full
of
tears
and
her
mouth
quivering
,
ready
to
burst
*NL*
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
dear
princess
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
``
just
one
more
*NL*
little
effort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
,
taking
the
dress
from
the
maid
,
came
up
to
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
we
'll
arrange
something
quite
simple
and
becoming
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
voices
,
hers
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
,
and
Katie
's
,
who
was
*NL*
laughing
at
something
,
mingled
in
a
merry
sound
,
like
the
chirping
of
*NL*
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
leave
me
alone
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
sounded
so
serious
and
so
sad
that
the
chirping
of
the
birds
*NL*
was
silenced
at
once
.
They
looked
at
the
beautiful
,
large
,
thoughtful
*NL*
eyes
full
of
tears
and
of
thoughts
,
gazing
shiningly
and
imploringly
at
*NL*
them
,
and
understood
that
it
was
useless
and
even
cruel
to
insist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
change
your
coiffure
,
''
said
the
little
princess
.
``
Did
n't
I
*NL*
tell
you
,
''
she
went
on
,
turning
reproachfully
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
*NL*
``
Mary
's
is
a
face
which
such
a
coiffure
does
not
suit
in
the
least
.
Not
*NL*
in
the
least
!
Please
change
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
,
please
leave
me
alone
!
It
is
all
quite
the
same
to
me
,
''
*NL*
answered
a
voice
struggling
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
the
little
princess
had
to
own
to
themselves
*NL*
that
Princess
Mary
in
this
guise
looked
very
plain
,
worse
than
usual
,
*NL*
but
it
was
too
late
.
She
was
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
they
*NL*
both
knew
,
an
expression
thoughtful
and
sad
.
This
expression
in
Princess
*NL*
Mary
did
not
frighten
them
-LRB-
she
never
inspired
fear
in
anyone
-RRB-
,
but
they
*NL*
knew
that
when
it
appeared
on
her
face
,
she
became
mute
and
was
not
to
*NL*
be
shaken
in
her
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
change
it
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Lise
.
And
as
Princess
Mary
gave
no
*NL*
answer
,
she
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
left
alone
.
She
did
not
comply
with
Lise
's
request
,
*NL*
she
not
only
left
her
hair
as
it
was
,
but
did
not
even
look
in
her
*NL*
glass
.
Letting
her
arms
fall
helplessly
,
she
sat
with
downcast
eyes
and
*NL*
pondered
.
A
husband
,
a
man
,
a
strong
dominant
and
strangely
attractive
*NL*
being
rose
in
her
imagination
,
and
carried
her
into
a
totally
different
*NL*
happy
world
of
his
own
.
She
fancied
a
child
,
her
own
--
such
as
she
had
*NL*
seen
the
day
before
in
the
arms
of
her
nurse
's
daughter
--
at
her
own
*NL*
breast
,
the
husband
standing
by
and
gazing
tenderly
at
her
and
the
*NL*
child
.
``
But
no
,
it
is
impossible
,
I
am
too
ugly
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
to
tea
.
The
prince
will
be
out
in
a
moment
,
''
came
the
*NL*
maid
's
voice
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
roused
herself
,
and
felt
appalled
at
what
she
had
been
thinking
,
and
*NL*
before
going
down
she
went
into
the
room
where
the
icons
hung
and
,
her
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
face
of
a
large
icon
of
the
Saviour
lit
by
a
*NL*
lamp
,
she
stood
before
it
with
folded
hands
for
a
few
moments
.
A
painful
*NL*
doubt
filled
her
soul
.
Could
the
joy
of
love
,
of
earthly
love
for
a
man
,
*NL*
be
for
her
?
In
her
thoughts
of
marriage
Princess
Mary
dreamed
of
*NL*
happiness
and
of
children
,
but
her
strongest
,
most
deeply
hidden
longing
*NL*
was
for
earthly
love
.
The
more
she
tried
to
hide
this
feeling
from
*NL*
others
and
even
from
herself
,
the
stronger
it
grew
.
``
O
God
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
how
am
I
to
stifle
in
my
heart
these
temptations
of
the
devil
?
How
am
I
*NL*
to
renounce
forever
these
vile
fancies
,
so
as
peacefully
to
fulfill
Thy
*NL*
will
?
''
And
scarcely
had
she
put
that
question
than
God
gave
her
the
*NL*
answer
in
her
own
heart
.
``
Desire
nothing
for
thyself
,
seek
nothing
,
be
*NL*
not
anxious
or
envious
.
Man
's
future
and
thy
own
fate
must
remain
hidden
*NL*
from
thee
,
but
live
so
that
thou
mayest
be
ready
for
anything
.
If
it
be
*NL*
God
's
will
to
prove
thee
in
the
duties
of
marriage
,
be
ready
to
fulfill
*NL*
His
will
.
''
With
this
consoling
thought
-LRB-
but
yet
with
a
hope
for
the
*NL*
fulfillment
of
her
forbidden
earthly
longing
-RRB-
Princess
Mary
sighed
,
and
*NL*
having
crossed
herself
went
down
,
thinking
neither
of
her
gown
and
*NL*
coiffure
nor
of
how
she
would
go
in
nor
of
what
she
would
say
.
What
*NL*
could
all
that
matter
in
comparison
with
the
will
of
God
,
without
Whose
*NL*
care
not
a
hair
of
man
's
head
can
fall
?

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
came
down
,
Prince
Vasili
and
his
son
were
already
in
*NL*
the
drawing
room
,
talking
to
the
little
princess
and
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
.
When
she
entered
with
her
heavy
step
,
treading
on
her
heels
,
*NL*
the
gentlemen
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
rose
and
the
little
princess
,
*NL*
indicating
her
to
the
gentlemen
,
said
:
``
Voila
Marie
!
''
Princess
Mary
saw
*NL*
them
all
and
saw
them
in
detail
.
She
saw
Prince
Vasili
's
face
,
serious
*NL*
for
an
instant
at
the
sight
of
her
,
but
immediately
smiling
again
,
and
*NL*
the
little
princess
curiously
noting
the
impression
``
Marie
''
produced
on
*NL*
the
visitors
.
And
she
saw
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
with
her
ribbon
and
*NL*
pretty
face
,
and
her
unusually
animated
look
which
was
fixed
on
him
,
but
*NL*
him
she
could
not
see
,
she
only
saw
something
large
,
brilliant
,
and
*NL*
handsome
moving
toward
her
as
she
entered
the
room
.
Prince
Vasili
*NL*
approached
first
,
and
she
kissed
the
bold
forehead
that
bent
over
her
*NL*
hand
and
answered
his
question
by
saying
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
she
*NL*
remembered
him
quite
well
.
Then
Anatole
came
up
to
her
.
She
still
could
*NL*
not
see
him
.
She
only
felt
a
soft
hand
taking
hers
firmly
,
and
she
*NL*
touched
with
her
lips
a
white
forehead
,
over
which
was
beautiful
light
-
*NL*
brown
hair
smelling
of
pomade
.
When
she
looked
up
at
him
she
was
struck
*NL*
by
his
beauty
.
Anatole
stood
with
his
right
thumb
under
a
button
of
his
*NL*
uniform
,
his
chest
expanded
and
his
back
drawn
in
,
slightly
swinging
one
*NL*
foot
,
and
,
with
his
head
a
little
bent
,
looked
with
beaming
face
at
the
*NL*
princess
without
speaking
and
evidently
not
thinking
about
her
at
all
.
*NL*
Anatole
was
not
quick-witted
,
nor
ready
or
eloquent
in
conversation
,
but
*NL*
he
had
the
faculty
,
so
invaluable
in
society
,
of
composure
and
*NL*
imperturbable
self-possession
.
If
a
man
lacking
in
self-confidence
*NL*
remains
dumb
on
a
first
introduction
and
betrays
a
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
impropriety
of
such
silence
and
an
anxiety
to
find
something
to
say
,
the
*NL*
effect
is
bad
.
But
Anatole
was
dumb
,
swung
his
foot
,
and
smilingly
*NL*
examined
the
princess
'
hair
.
It
was
evident
that
he
could
be
silent
in
*NL*
this
way
for
a
very
long
time
.
``
If
anyone
finds
this
silence
*NL*
inconvenient
,
let
him
talk
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
he
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
Besides
this
,
in
his
behavior
to
women
Anatole
had
a
manner
which
*NL*
particularly
inspires
in
them
curiosity
,
awe
,
and
even
love
--
a
*NL*
supercilious
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority
.
It
was
as
if
he
said
*NL*
to
them
:
``
I
know
you
,
I
know
you
,
but
why
should
I
bother
about
you
?
*NL*
You
'd
be
only
too
glad
,
of
course
.
''
Perhaps
he
did
not
really
think
this
*NL*
when
he
met
women
--
even
probably
he
did
not
,
for
in
general
he
thought
*NL*
very
little
--
but
his
looks
and
manner
gave
that
impression
.
The
princess
*NL*
felt
this
,
and
as
if
wishing
to
show
him
that
she
did
not
even
dare
*NL*
expect
to
interest
him
,
she
turned
to
his
father
.
The
conversation
was
*NL*
general
and
animated
,
thanks
to
Princess
Lise
's
voice
and
little
downy
*NL*
lip
that
lifted
over
her
white
teeth
.
She
met
Prince
Vasili
with
that
*NL*
playful
manner
often
employed
by
lively
chatty
people
,
and
consisting
in
*NL*
the
assumption
that
between
the
person
they
so
address
and
themselves
*NL*
there
are
some
semi-private
,
long-established
jokes
and
amusing
*NL*
reminiscences
,
though
no
such
reminiscences
really
exist
--
just
as
none
*NL*
existed
in
this
case
.
Prince
Vasili
readily
adopted
her
tone
and
the
*NL*
little
princess
also
drew
Anatole
,
whom
she
hardly
knew
,
into
these
*NL*
amusing
recollections
of
things
that
had
never
occurred
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
also
shared
them
and
even
Princess
Mary
felt
herself
*NL*
pleasantly
made
to
share
in
these
merry
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
at
least
we
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
company
all
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
dear
prince
,
''
said
the
little
princess
-LRB-
of
course
,
in
French
-RRB-
*NL*
to
Prince
Vasili
.
``
It
's
not
as
at
Annette
's
*
receptions
where
you
*NL*
always
ran
away
;
you
remember
cette
chere
Annette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
wo
n't
talk
politics
to
me
like
Annette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
little
tea
table
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
you
were
never
at
Annette
's
?
''
the
little
princess
asked
*NL*
Anatole
.
``
Ah
,
I
know
,
I
know
,
''
she
said
with
a
sly
glance
,
``
your
brother
*NL*
Hippolyte
told
me
about
your
goings
on
.
Oh
!
''
and
she
shook
her
finger
at
*NL*
him
,
``
I
have
even
heard
of
your
doings
in
Paris
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
n't
Hippolyte
tell
you
?
''
asked
Prince
Vasili
,
turning
to
his
son
*NL*
and
seizing
the
little
princess
'
arm
as
if
she
would
have
run
away
and
*NL*
he
had
just
managed
to
catch
her
,
``
did
n't
he
tell
you
how
he
himself
was
*NL*
pining
for
the
dear
princess
,
and
how
she
showed
him
the
door
?
Oh
,
she
*NL*
is
a
pearl
among
women
,
Princess
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Paris
was
mentioned
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
for
her
part
seized
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
joining
in
the
general
current
of
recollections
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
liberty
of
inquiring
whether
it
was
long
since
Anatole
had
*NL*
left
Paris
and
how
he
had
liked
that
city
.
Anatole
answered
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
very
readily
and
,
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
,
talked
to
her
*NL*
about
her
native
land
.
When
he
saw
the
pretty
little
Bourienne
,
Anatole
*NL*
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
not
find
Bald
Hills
dull
either
.
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
bad
!
''
he
thought
,
examining
her
,
``
not
at
all
bad
,
that
*NL*
little
companion
!
I
hope
she
will
bring
her
along
with
her
when
we
're
*NL*
married
,
la
petite
est
gentille
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
little
one
is
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
dressed
leisurely
in
his
study
,
frowning
and
considering
*NL*
what
he
was
to
do
.
The
coming
of
these
visitors
annoyed
him
.
``
What
are
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
and
that
son
of
his
to
me
?
Prince
Vasili
is
a
shallow
*NL*
braggart
and
his
son
,
no
doubt
,
is
a
fine
specimen
,
''
he
grumbled
to
*NL*
himself
.
What
angered
him
was
that
the
coming
of
these
visitors
revived
*NL*
in
his
mind
an
unsettled
question
he
always
tried
to
stifle
,
one
about
*NL*
which
he
always
deceived
himself
.
The
question
was
whether
he
could
ever
*NL*
bring
himself
to
part
from
his
daughter
and
give
her
to
a
husband
.
The
*NL*
prince
never
directly
asked
himself
that
question
,
knowing
beforehand
*NL*
that
he
would
have
to
answer
it
justly
,
and
justice
clashed
not
only
*NL*
with
his
feelings
but
with
the
very
possibility
of
life
.
Life
without
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
little
as
he
seemed
to
value
her
,
was
unthinkable
to
him
.
*NL*
``
And
why
should
she
marry
?
''
he
thought
.
``
To
be
unhappy
for
certain
.
*NL*
There
's
Lise
,
married
to
Andrew
--
a
better
husband
one
would
think
could
*NL*
hardly
be
found
nowadays
--
but
is
she
contented
with
her
lot
?
And
who
*NL*
would
marry
Marie
for
love
?
Plain
and
awkward
!
They
'll
take
her
for
her
*NL*
connections
and
wealth
.
Are
there
no
women
living
unmarried
,
and
even
*NL*
the
happier
for
it
?
''
So
thought
Prince
Bolkonski
while
dressing
,
and
yet
*NL*
the
question
he
was
always
putting
off
demanded
an
immediate
answer
.
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
had
brought
his
son
with
the
evident
intention
of
*NL*
proposing
,
and
today
or
tomorrow
he
would
probably
ask
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
His
birth
and
position
in
society
were
not
bad
.
``
Well
,
I
've
nothing
*NL*
against
it
,
''
the
prince
said
to
himself
,
``
but
he
must
be
worthy
of
her
.
*NL*
And
that
is
what
we
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
we
shall
see
!
That
is
what
we
shall
see
!
''
he
added
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
drawing
room
with
his
usual
alert
step
,
glancing
rapidly
*NL*
round
the
company
.
He
noticed
the
change
in
the
little
princess
'
dress
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
ribbon
,
Princess
Mary
's
unbecoming
coiffure
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
and
Anatole
's
smiles
,
and
the
loneliness
of
his
*NL*
daughter
amid
the
general
conversation
.
``
Got
herself
up
like
a
fool
!
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
looking
irritably
at
her
.
``
She
is
shameless
,
and
he
ignores
*NL*
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
straight
up
to
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
How
d'ye
do
?
How
d'ye
do
?
Glad
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friendship
laughs
at
distance
,
''
began
Prince
Vasili
in
his
usual
rapid
,
*NL*
self-confident
,
familiar
tone
.
``
Here
is
my
second
son
;
please
love
and
*NL*
befriend
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bolkonski
surveyed
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
young
fellow
!
Fine
young
fellow
!
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
come
and
kiss
*NL*
me
,
''
and
he
offered
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
kissed
the
old
man
,
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
perfect
*NL*
composure
,
waiting
for
a
display
of
the
eccentricities
his
father
had
*NL*
told
him
to
expect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Bolkonski
sat
down
in
his
usual
place
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
*NL*
and
,
drawing
up
an
armchair
for
Prince
Vasili
,
pointed
to
it
and
began
*NL*
questioning
him
about
political
affairs
and
news
.
He
seemed
to
listen
*NL*
attentively
to
what
Prince
Vasili
said
,
but
kept
glancing
at
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
they
are
writing
from
Potsdam
already
?
''
he
said
,
repeating
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
's
last
words
.
Then
rising
,
he
suddenly
went
up
to
his
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
for
visitors
you
've
got
yourself
up
like
that
,
eh
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
Fine
,
very
fine
!
You
have
done
up
your
hair
in
this
new
way
for
the
*NL*
visitors
,
and
before
the
visitors
I
tell
you
that
in
future
you
are
*NL*
never
to
dare
to
change
your
way
of
dress
without
my
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
fault
,
mon
pere
,
''
interceded
the
little
princess
,
with
a
*NL*
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
do
as
you
please
,
''
said
Prince
Bolkonski
,
bowing
to
his
*NL*
daughter-in-law
,
``
but
she
need
not
make
a
fool
of
herself
,
she
's
plain
*NL*
enough
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sat
down
again
,
paying
no
more
attention
to
his
daughter
,
who
was
*NL*
reduced
to
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
that
coiffure
suits
the
princess
very
well
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
,
young
prince
,
what
's
your
name
?
''
said
Prince
Bolkonski
,
*NL*
turning
to
Anatole
,
``
come
here
,
let
us
talk
and
get
acquainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
fun
begins
,
''
thought
Anatole
,
sitting
down
with
a
smile
beside
*NL*
the
old
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
boy
,
I
hear
you
've
been
educated
abroad
,
not
taught
to
*NL*
read
and
write
by
the
deacon
,
like
your
father
and
me
.
Now
tell
me
,
my
*NL*
dear
boy
,
are
you
serving
in
the
Horse
Guards
?
''
asked
the
old
man
,
*NL*
scrutinizing
Anatole
closely
and
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
been
transferred
to
the
line
,
''
said
Anatole
,
hardly
able
to
*NL*
restrain
his
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
That
's
a
good
thing
.
So
,
my
dear
boy
,
you
wish
to
serve
the
Tsar
*NL*
and
the
country
?
It
is
wartime
.
Such
a
fine
fellow
must
serve
.
Well
,
are
*NL*
you
off
to
the
front
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Prince
,
our
regiment
has
gone
to
the
front
,
but
I
am
attached
...
*NL*
what
is
it
I
am
attached
to
,
Papa
?
''
said
Anatole
,
turning
to
his
father
*NL*
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
splendid
soldier
,
splendid
!
`
What
am
I
attached
to
!
'
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
laughed
Prince
Bolkonski
,
and
Anatole
laughed
still
louder
.
Suddenly
*NL*
Prince
Bolkonski
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
,
''
he
said
to
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
returned
smiling
to
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
've
had
him
educated
abroad
,
Prince
Vasili
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
said
the
old
prince
to
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done
my
best
for
him
,
and
I
can
assure
you
the
education
there
*NL*
is
much
better
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
everything
is
different
nowadays
,
everything
is
changed
.
The
lad
's
*NL*
a
fine
fellow
,
a
fine
fellow
!
Well
,
come
with
me
now
.
''
He
took
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
's
arm
and
led
him
to
his
study
.
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
*NL*
together
,
Prince
Vasili
announced
his
hopes
and
wishes
to
the
old
*NL*
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
you
think
I
shall
prevent
her
,
that
I
ca
n't
part
from
her
?
''
*NL*
said
the
old
prince
angrily
.
``
What
an
idea
!
I
'm
ready
for
it
tomorrow
!
*NL*
Only
let
me
tell
you
,
I
want
to
know
my
son-in-law
better
.
You
know
my
*NL*
principles
--
everything
aboveboard
?
I
will
ask
her
tomorrow
in
your
*NL*
presence
;
if
she
is
willing
,
then
he
can
stay
on
.
He
can
stay
and
I
'll
*NL*
see
.
''
The
old
prince
snorted
.
``
Let
her
marry
,
it
's
all
the
same
to
me
!
''
*NL*
he
screamed
in
the
same
piercing
tone
as
when
parting
from
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
frankly
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
in
the
tone
of
a
crafty
*NL*
man
convinced
of
the
futility
of
being
cunning
with
so
keen-sighted
a
*NL*
companion
.
``
You
know
,
you
see
right
through
people
.
Anatole
is
no
*NL*
genius
,
but
he
is
an
honest
,
goodhearted
lad
;
an
excellent
son
or
*NL*
kinsman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
we
'll
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
always
happens
when
women
lead
lonely
lives
for
any
length
of
time
*NL*
without
male
society
,
on
Anatole
's
appearance
all
the
three
women
of
*NL*
Prince
Bolkonski
's
household
felt
that
their
life
had
not
been
real
till
*NL*
then
.
Their
powers
of
reasoning
,
feeling
,
and
observing
immediately
*NL*
increased
tenfold
,
and
their
life
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
passed
in
*NL*
darkness
,
was
suddenly
lit
up
by
a
new
brightness
,
full
of
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
grew
quite
unconscious
of
her
face
and
coiffure
.
The
*NL*
handsome
open
face
of
the
man
who
might
perhaps
be
her
husband
absorbed
*NL*
all
her
attention
.
He
seemed
to
her
kind
,
brave
,
determined
,
manly
,
and
*NL*
magnanimous
.
She
felt
convinced
of
that
.
Thousands
of
dreams
of
a
future
*NL*
family
life
continually
rose
in
her
imagination
.
She
drove
them
away
and
*NL*
tried
to
conceal
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
am
I
not
too
cold
with
him
?
''
thought
the
princess
.
``
I
try
to
be
*NL*
reserved
because
in
the
depth
of
my
soul
I
feel
too
near
to
him
already
,
*NL*
but
then
he
can
not
know
what
I
think
of
him
and
may
imagine
that
I
do
*NL*
not
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Princess
Mary
tried
,
but
could
not
manage
,
to
be
cordial
to
her
new
*NL*
guest
.
``
Poor
girl
,
she
's
devilish
ugly
!
''
thought
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
also
roused
to
great
excitement
by
Anatole
's
*NL*
arrival
,
thought
in
another
way
.
Of
course
,
she
,
a
handsome
young
woman
*NL*
without
any
definite
position
,
without
relations
or
even
a
country
,
did
*NL*
not
intend
to
devote
her
life
to
serving
Prince
Bolkonski
,
to
reading
*NL*
aloud
to
him
and
being
friends
with
Princess
Mary
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
had
long
been
waiting
for
a
Russian
prince
who
,
able
to
*NL*
appreciate
at
a
glance
her
superiority
to
the
plain
,
badly
dressed
,
*NL*
ungainly
Russian
princesses
,
would
fall
in
love
with
her
and
carry
her
*NL*
off
;
and
here
at
last
was
a
Russian
prince
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
knew
*NL*
a
story
,
heard
from
her
aunt
but
finished
in
her
own
way
,
which
she
*NL*
liked
to
repeat
to
herself
.
It
was
the
story
of
a
girl
who
had
been
*NL*
seduced
,
and
to
whom
her
poor
mother
-LRB-
sa
pauvre
mere
-RRB-
appeared
,
and
*NL*
reproached
her
for
yielding
to
a
man
without
being
married
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
was
often
touched
to
tears
as
in
imagination
she
told
this
*NL*
story
to
him
,
her
seducer
.
And
now
he
,
a
real
Russian
prince
,
had
*NL*
appeared
.
He
would
carry
her
away
and
then
sa
pauvre
mere
would
appear
*NL*
and
he
would
marry
her
.
So
her
future
shaped
itself
in
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
's
head
at
the
very
time
she
was
talking
to
Anatole
about
*NL*
Paris
.
It
was
not
calculation
that
guided
her
-LRB-
she
did
not
even
for
a
*NL*
moment
consider
what
she
should
do
-RRB-
,
but
all
this
had
long
been
familiar
*NL*
to
her
,
and
now
that
Anatole
had
appeared
it
just
grouped
itself
around
*NL*
him
and
she
wished
and
tried
to
please
him
as
much
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
,
like
an
old
war
horse
that
hears
the
trumpet
,
*NL*
unconsciously
and
quite
forgetting
her
condition
,
prepared
for
the
*NL*
familiar
gallop
of
coquetry
,
without
any
ulterior
motive
or
any
*NL*
struggle
,
but
with
naive
and
lighthearted
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
in
female
society
Anatole
usually
assumed
the
role
of
a
man
*NL*
tired
of
being
run
after
by
women
,
his
vanity
was
flattered
by
the
*NL*
spectacle
of
his
power
over
these
three
women
.
Besides
that
,
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
for
the
pretty
and
provocative
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
*NL*
that
passionate
animal
feeling
which
was
apt
to
master
him
with
great
*NL*
suddenness
and
prompt
him
to
the
coarsest
and
most
reckless
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
the
company
went
into
the
sitting
room
and
Princess
Mary
was
*NL*
asked
to
play
on
the
clavichord
.
Anatole
,
laughing
and
in
high
spirits
,
*NL*
came
and
leaned
on
his
elbows
,
facing
her
and
beside
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
.
Princess
Mary
felt
his
look
with
a
painfully
joyous
emotion
.
*NL*
Her
favorite
sonata
bore
her
into
a
most
intimately
poetic
world
and
the
*NL*
look
she
felt
upon
her
made
that
world
still
more
poetic
.
But
Anatole
's
*NL*
expression
,
though
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
,
referred
not
to
her
but
*NL*
to
the
movements
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
little
foot
,
which
he
was
*NL*
then
touching
with
his
own
under
the
clavichord
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
*NL*
was
also
looking
at
Princess
Mary
,
and
in
her
lovely
eyes
there
was
a
*NL*
look
of
fearful
joy
and
hope
that
was
also
new
to
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
she
loves
me
!
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
``
How
happy
I
am
now
,
and
how
*NL*
happy
I
may
be
with
such
a
friend
and
such
a
husband
!
Husband
?
Can
it
be
*NL*
possible
?
''
she
thought
,
not
daring
to
look
at
his
face
,
but
still
*NL*
feeling
his
eyes
gazing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
after
supper
,
when
all
were
about
to
retire
,
Anatole
*NL*
kissed
Princess
Mary
's
hand
.
She
did
not
know
how
she
found
the
courage
,
*NL*
but
she
looked
straight
into
his
handsome
face
as
it
came
near
to
her
*NL*
shortsighted
eyes
.
Turning
from
Princess
Mary
he
went
up
and
kissed
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
hand
.
-LRB-
This
was
not
etiquette
,
but
then
he
did
*NL*
everything
so
simply
and
with
such
assurance
!
-RRB-
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
*NL*
flushed
,
and
gave
the
princess
a
frightened
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
delicacy
!
''
thought
the
princess
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
Amelie
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
-RRB-
``
thinks
I
could
be
jealous
of
her
,
and
not
*NL*
value
her
pure
affection
and
devotion
to
me
?
''
She
went
up
to
her
and
*NL*
kissed
her
warmly
.
Anatole
went
up
to
kiss
the
little
princess
'
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
No
!
No
!
When
your
father
writes
to
tell
me
that
you
are
behaving
*NL*
well
I
will
give
you
my
hand
to
kiss
.
Not
till
then
!
''
she
said
.
And
*NL*
smilingly
raising
a
finger
at
him
,
she
left
the
room
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
separated
,
but
,
except
Anatole
who
fell
asleep
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
got
into
bed
,
all
kept
awake
a
long
time
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
really
to
be
my
husband
,
this
stranger
who
is
so
kind
--
yes
,
kind
,
*NL*
that
is
the
chief
thing
,
''
thought
Princess
Mary
;
and
fear
,
which
she
had
*NL*
seldom
experienced
,
came
upon
her
.
She
feared
to
look
round
,
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
someone
was
there
standing
behind
the
screen
in
the
dark
*NL*
corner
.
And
this
someone
was
he
--
the
devil
--
and
he
was
also
this
man
*NL*
with
the
white
forehead
,
black
eyebrows
,
and
red
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rang
for
her
maid
and
asked
her
to
sleep
in
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
walked
up
and
down
the
conservatory
for
a
long
*NL*
time
that
evening
,
vainly
expecting
someone
,
now
smiling
at
someone
,
now
*NL*
working
herself
up
to
tears
with
the
imaginary
words
of
her
pauvre
mere
*NL*
rebuking
her
for
her
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
grumbled
to
her
maid
that
her
bed
was
badly
made
.
*NL*
She
could
not
lie
either
on
her
face
or
on
her
side
.
Every
position
was
*NL*
awkward
and
uncomfortable
,
and
her
burden
oppressed
her
now
more
than
*NL*
ever
because
Anatole
's
presence
had
vividly
recalled
to
her
the
time
*NL*
when
she
was
not
like
that
and
when
everything
was
light
and
gay
.
She
*NL*
sat
in
an
armchair
in
her
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
and
Katie
,
sleepy
*NL*
and
disheveled
,
beat
and
turned
the
heavy
feather
bed
for
the
third
*NL*
time
,
muttering
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
it
was
all
lumps
and
holes
!
''
the
little
princess
repeated
.
*NL*
``
I
should
be
glad
enough
to
fall
asleep
,
so
it
's
not
my
fault
!
''
and
her
*NL*
voice
quivered
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
did
not
sleep
either
.
Tikhon
,
half
asleep
,
heard
him
*NL*
pacing
angrily
about
and
snorting
.
The
old
prince
felt
as
though
he
had
*NL*
been
insulted
through
his
daughter
.
The
insult
was
the
more
pointed
*NL*
because
it
concerned
not
himself
but
another
,
his
daughter
,
whom
he
*NL*
loved
more
than
himself
.
He
kept
telling
himself
that
he
would
consider
*NL*
the
whole
matter
and
decide
what
was
right
and
how
he
should
act
,
but
*NL*
instead
of
that
he
only
excited
himself
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
man
that
turns
up
--
she
forgets
her
father
and
everything
*NL*
else
,
runs
upstairs
and
does
up
her
hair
and
wags
her
tail
and
is
unlike
*NL*
herself
!
Glad
to
throw
her
father
over
!
And
she
knew
I
should
notice
it
.
*NL*
Fr
...
fr
...
fr
!
And
do
n't
I
see
that
that
idiot
had
eyes
only
for
*NL*
Bourienne
--
I
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
her
.
And
how
is
it
she
has
not
*NL*
pride
enough
to
see
it
?
If
she
has
no
pride
for
herself
she
might
at
*NL*
least
have
some
for
my
sake
!
She
must
be
shown
that
the
blockhead
thinks
*NL*
nothing
of
her
and
looks
only
at
Bourienne
.
No
,
she
has
no
pride
...
but
*NL*
I
'll
let
her
see
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
knew
that
if
he
told
his
daughter
she
was
making
a
*NL*
mistake
and
that
Anatole
meant
to
flirt
with
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
self-esteem
would
be
wounded
and
his
point
-LRB-
not
to
be
*NL*
parted
from
her
-RRB-
would
be
gained
,
so
pacifying
himself
with
this
*NL*
thought
,
he
called
Tikhon
and
began
to
undress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
devil
brought
them
here
?
''
thought
he
,
while
Tikhon
was
putting
the
*NL*
nightshirt
over
his
dried-up
old
body
and
gray-haired
chest
.
``
I
never
*NL*
invited
them
.
They
came
to
disturb
my
life
--
and
there
is
not
much
of
it
*NL*
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
'em
!
''
he
muttered
,
while
his
head
was
still
covered
by
the
*NL*
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
knew
his
master
's
habit
of
sometimes
thinking
aloud
,
and
*NL*
therefore
met
with
unaltered
looks
the
angrily
inquisitive
expression
of
*NL*
the
face
that
emerged
from
the
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
to
bed
?
''
asked
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
,
like
all
good
valets
,
instinctively
knew
the
direction
of
his
*NL*
master
's
thoughts
.
He
guessed
that
the
question
referred
to
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
and
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
to
bed
and
put
out
their
lights
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
good
...
no
good
...
''
said
the
prince
rapidly
,
and
thrusting
his
feet
*NL*
into
his
slippers
and
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
of
his
dressing
gown
,
he
*NL*
went
to
the
couch
on
which
he
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
no
words
had
passed
between
Anatole
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
*NL*
they
quite
understood
one
another
as
to
the
first
part
of
their
romance
,
*NL*
up
to
the
appearance
of
the
pauvre
mere
;
they
understood
that
they
had
*NL*
much
to
say
to
one
another
in
private
and
so
they
had
been
seeking
an
*NL*
opportunity
since
morning
to
meet
one
another
alone
.
When
Princess
Mary
*NL*
went
to
her
father
's
room
at
the
usual
hour
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
*NL*
Anatole
met
in
the
conservatory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
went
to
the
door
of
the
study
with
special
trepidation
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
not
only
did
everybody
know
that
her
fate
would
be
*NL*
decided
that
day
,
but
that
they
also
knew
what
she
thought
about
it
.
She
*NL*
read
this
in
Tikhon
's
face
and
in
that
of
Prince
Vasili
's
valet
,
who
*NL*
made
her
a
low
bow
when
she
met
him
in
the
corridor
carrying
hot
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
was
very
affectionate
and
careful
in
his
treatment
of
his
*NL*
daughter
that
morning
.
Princess
Mary
well
knew
this
painstaking
*NL*
expression
of
her
father
's
.
His
face
wore
that
expression
when
his
dry
*NL*
hands
clenched
with
vexation
at
her
not
understanding
a
sum
in
*NL*
arithmetic
,
when
rising
from
his
chair
he
would
walk
away
from
her
,
*NL*
repeating
in
a
low
voice
the
same
words
several
times
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
the
point
at
once
,
treating
her
ceremoniously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
proposition
made
me
concerning
you
,
''
he
said
with
an
*NL*
unnatural
smile
.
``
I
expect
you
have
guessed
that
Prince
Vasili
has
not
*NL*
come
and
brought
his
pupil
with
him
''
-LRB-
for
some
reason
Prince
Bolkonski
*NL*
referred
to
Anatole
as
a
``
pupil
''
-RRB-
``
for
the
sake
of
my
beautiful
eyes
.
*NL*
Last
night
a
proposition
was
made
me
on
your
account
and
,
as
you
know
my
*NL*
principles
,
I
refer
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
understand
you
,
mon
pere
?
''
said
the
princess
,
growing
pale
*NL*
and
then
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
understand
me
!
''
cried
her
father
angrily
.
``
Prince
Vasili
finds
you
*NL*
to
his
taste
as
a
daughter-in-law
and
makes
a
proposal
to
you
on
his
*NL*
pupil
's
behalf
.
That
's
how
it
's
to
be
understood
!
`
How
understand
*NL*
it
'
!
...
And
I
ask
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
think
,
Father
,
''
whispered
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
?
What
of
me
?
Leave
me
out
of
the
question
.
I
'm
not
going
to
get
*NL*
married
.
What
about
you
?
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
saw
that
her
father
regarded
the
matter
with
disapproval
,
*NL*
but
at
that
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
her
fate
would
be
*NL*
decided
now
or
never
.
She
lowered
her
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
the
gaze
*NL*
under
which
she
felt
that
she
could
not
think
,
but
would
only
be
able
to
*NL*
submit
from
habit
,
and
she
said
:
``
I
wish
only
to
do
your
will
,
but
if
I
*NL*
had
to
express
my
own
desire
...
''
She
had
no
time
to
finish
.
The
old
*NL*
prince
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
admirable
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
He
will
take
you
with
your
dowry
and
*NL*
take
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
into
the
bargain
.
She
'll
be
the
wife
,
while
*NL*
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
stopped
.
He
saw
the
effect
these
words
had
produced
on
his
*NL*
daughter
.
She
lowered
her
head
and
was
ready
to
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
now
then
,
I
'm
only
joking
!
''
he
said
.
``
Remember
this
,
*NL*
Princess
,
I
hold
to
the
principle
that
a
maiden
has
a
full
right
to
*NL*
choose
.
I
give
you
freedom
.
Only
remember
that
your
life
's
happiness
*NL*
depends
on
your
decision
.
Never
mind
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
know
,
Father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
need
to
talk
!
He
receives
his
orders
and
will
marry
you
or
*NL*
anybody

but
you
are
free
to
choose
...
Go
to
your
room
,
think
it
over
,
*NL*
and
come
back
in
an
hour
and
tell
me
in
his
presence
:
yes
or
no
.
I
know
*NL*
you
will
pray
over
it

Well
,
pray
if
you
like

but
you
had
better
think
*NL*
it
over
.
Go
!
Yes
or
no
,
yes
or
no
,
yes
or
no
!
''
he
still
shouted
when
the
*NL*
princess
,
as
if
lost
in
a
fog
,
had
already
staggered
out
of
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fate
was
decided
and
happily
decided
.
But
what
her
father
had
said
*NL*
about
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
dreadful
.
It
was
untrue
to
be
sure
,
but
*NL*
still
it
was
terrible
,
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
.
She
was
*NL*
going
straight
on
through
the
conservatory
,
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
*NL*
anything
,
when
suddenly
the
well-known
whispering
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
aroused
her
.
She
raised
her
eyes
,
and
two
steps
away
saw
*NL*
Anatole
embracing
the
Frenchwoman
and
whispering
something
to
her
.
With
*NL*
a
horrified
expression
on
his
handsome
face
,
Anatole
looked
at
Princess
*NL*
Mary
,
but
did
not
at
once
take
his
arm
from
the
waist
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
who
had
not
yet
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
Why
?
Wait
a
moment
!
''
Anatole
's
face
seemed
to
say
.
Princess
*NL*
Mary
looked
at
them
in
silence
.
She
could
not
understand
it
.
At
last
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
gave
a
scream
and
ran
away
.
Anatole
bowed
to
*NL*
Princess
Mary
with
a
gay
smile
,
as
if
inviting
her
to
join
in
a
laugh
at
*NL*
this
strange
incident
,
and
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
went
to
the
door
*NL*
that
led
to
his
own
apartments
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
,
Tikhon
came
to
call
Princess
Mary
to
the
old
prince
;
he
*NL*
added
that
Prince
Vasili
was
also
there
.
When
Tikhon
came
to
her
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
,
holding
the
weeping
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
in
her
arms
and
gently
stroking
her
hair
.
The
*NL*
princess
'
beautiful
eyes
with
all
their
former
calm
radiance
were
*NL*
looking
with
tender
affection
and
pity
at
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
*NL*
pretty
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Princess
,
I
have
lost
your
affection

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
,
with
one
leg
thrown
high
over
the
other
and
a
snuffbox
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
was
sitting
there
with
a
smile
of
deep
emotion
on
his
face

as

if
stirred
to
his
heart
's
core
and
himself
regretting
and
laughing
at
*NL*
his
own
sensibility
,
when
Princess
Mary
entered
.
He
hurriedly
took
a
*NL*
pinch
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my

my

he
began
,
rising
and
taking
her
by
both
hands

*NL*
Then
,
sighing
,
he
added
:

My

*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
back
and
a
real
tear
appeared
in
his
eye

*NL*

Prince

Prince

frowning

taking
his

he
did
not

only

bending
his

to

touched
it

pressed

winced

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
since
the
Rostovs
had
news
of
Nicholas
.
Not
till
midwinter
*NL*
was
the
count
at
last
handed
a
letter
addressed
in
his
son
's
*NL*
handwriting
.
On
receiving
it
,
he
ran
on
tiptoe
to
his
study
in
alarm
and
*NL*
haste
,
trying
to
escape
notice
,
closed
the
door
,
and
began
to
read
the
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
who
always
knew
everything
that
passed
in
the
house
,
*NL*
on
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
letter
went
softly
into
the
room
and
*NL*
found
the
count
with
it
in
his
hand
,
sobbing
and
laughing
at
the
same
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
though
her
circumstances
had
improved
,
was
still
*NL*
living
with
the
Rostovs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
?
''
said
she
,
in
a
tone
of
pathetic
inquiry
,
prepared
to
*NL*
sympathize
in
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
sobbed
yet
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolenka
...
a
letter
...
wa
...
a.
.
.
s.
.
.
wounded
...
my
darling
boy
...
*NL*
the
countess
...
promoted
to
be
an
officer
...
thank
God
...
How
tell
the
*NL*
little
countess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
sat
down
beside
him
,
with
her
own
handkerchief
wiped
*NL*
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
from
the
letter
,
then
having
dried
her
own
*NL*
eyes
she
comforted
the
count
,
and
decided
that
at
dinner
and
till
*NL*
teatime
she
would
prepare
the
countess
,
and
after
tea
,
with
God
's
help
,
*NL*
would
inform
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
Anna
Mikhaylovna
talked
the
whole
time
about
the
war
news
and
*NL*
about
Nikolenka
,
twice
asked
when
the
last
letter
had
been
received
from
*NL*
him
,
though
she
knew
that
already
,
and
remarked
that
they
might
very
*NL*
likely
be
getting
a
letter
from
him
that
day
.
Each
time
that
these
hints
*NL*
began
to
make
the
countess
anxious
and
she
glanced
uneasily
at
the
count
*NL*
and
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
the
latter
very
adroitly
turned
the
*NL*
conversation
to
insignificant
matters
.
Natasha
,
who
,
of
the
whole
*NL*
family
,
was
the
most
gifted
with
a
capacity
to
feel
any
shades
of
*NL*
intonation
,
look
,
and
expression
,
pricked
up
her
ears
from
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
meal
and
was
certain
that
there
was
some
secret
between
her
*NL*
father
and
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
*NL*
brother
,
and
that
Anna
Mikhaylovna
was
preparing
them
for
it
.
Bold
as
*NL*
she
was
,
Natasha
,
who
knew
how
sensitive
her
mother
was
to
anything
*NL*
relating
to
Nikolenka
,
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
at
dinner
,
*NL*
but
she
was
too
excited
to
eat
anything
and
kept
wriggling
about
on
her
*NL*
chair
regardless
of
her
governess
'
remarks
.
After
dinner
,
she
rushed
*NL*
head
long
after
Anna
Mikhaylovna
and
,
dashing
at
her
,
flung
herself
on
*NL*
her
neck
as
soon
as
she
overtook
her
in
the
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Auntie
,
darling
,
do
tell
me
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

sweet
one

honey

I
wo
n't
give
up

I
know
you
know
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
little
slyboots
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
from
Nikolenka
!
I
'm
sure
of
it
!
''
exclaimed
Natasha
,
reading
*NL*
confirmation
in
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
God
's
sake
,
be
careful
,
you
know
how
it
may
affect
your
mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
I
will
,
only
tell
me
!
You
wo
n't
?
Then
I
will
go
and
tell
at
*NL*
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
in
a
few
words
,
told
her
the
contents
of
the
letter
,
*NL*
on
condition
that
she
should
tell
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
on
my
true
word
of
honor
,
''
said
Natasha
,
crossing
herself
,
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
tell
anyone
!
''
and
she
ran
off
at
once
to
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolenka
...
wounded
...
a
letter
,
''
she
announced
in
gleeful
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
!
''
was
all
Sonya
said
,
instantly
turning
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
seeing
the
impression
the
news
of
her
brother
's
wound
produced
*NL*
on
Sonya
,
felt
for
the
first
time
the
sorrowful
side
of
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rushed
to
Sonya
,
hugged
her
,
and
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
wound
,
but
he
has
been
made
an
officer
;
he
is
well
now
,
he
*NL*
wrote
himself
,
''
said
she
through
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
It
's
true
that
all
you
women
are
crybabies
,
''
remarked
Petya
,
*NL*
pacing
the
room
with
large
,
resolute
strides
.
``
Now
I
'm
very
glad
,
very
*NL*
glad
indeed
,
that
my
brother
has
distinguished
himself
so
.
You
are
all
*NL*
blubberers
and
understand
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
smiled
through
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
read
the
letter
?
''
asked
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
she
said
that
it
was
all
over
and
that
he
's
now
an
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
said
Sonya
,
crossing
herself
.
``
But
perhaps
she
deceived
*NL*
you
.
Let
us
go
to
Mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
paced
the
room
in
silence
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
been
in
Nikolenka
's
place
I
would
have
killed
even
more
of
those
*NL*
Frenchmen

''
he
said
.
``
What
nasty
brutes
they
are
!
I
'd
have
killed
so
*NL*
many
that
there
'd
have
been
a
heap
of
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue

Petya
,
what
a
goose
you
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
goose
,
but
they
are
who
cry
about
trifles

said
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
him
?
''
Natasha
suddenly
asked
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
remember
Nicholas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sonya
,
but
do
you
remember
so
that
you
remember
him
perfectly
,
*NL*
remember
everything
?
''
said
Natasha
,
with
an
expressive
gesture
,
*NL*
evidently
wishing
to
give
her
words
a
very
definite
meaning
.
``
I
remember
*NL*
Nikolenka
too
,
I
remember
him
well
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
Boris

I
do
n't

a
bit

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
You
do
n't
remember
Boris

asked
Sonya
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
I
do
n't
remember

I
know
what
he
is
like

not

*NL*
remember
Nikolenka

Him
--
I
just
shut
my
eyes
and
remember
,
but
Boris
...
*NL*
No

''
-LRB-
She
shut
her
eyes
.
-RRB-
``
No
!
there
's
nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Natasha
!
''
said
Sonya
,
looking
ecstatically
and
earnestly
at
her
*NL*
friend
as
if
she
did
not
consider
her
worthy
to
hear
what
she
meant
to
*NL*
say
and
as
if
she
were
saying
it
to
someone
else
,
with
whom
joking
was
*NL*
out
of
the
question
,
``
I
am
in
love
with
your
brother
once
for
all
and
,
*NL*
whatever
may
happen
to
him
or
to
me
,
shall
never
cease
to
love
him
as
*NL*
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
Sonya
with
wondering
and
inquisitive
eyes
,
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
She
felt
that
Sonya
was
speaking
the
truth
,
that
there
was
such
*NL*
love
as
Sonya
was
speaking
of
.
But
Natasha
had
not
yet
felt
anything
*NL*
like
it
.
She
believed
it
could
be
,
but
did
not
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
write
to
him
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
became
thoughtful
.
The
question
of
how
to
write
to
Nicholas
,
and
*NL*
whether
she
ought
to
write
,
tormented
her
.
Now
that
he
was
already
an
*NL*
officer
and
a
wounded
hero
,
would
it
be
right
to
remind
him
of
herself
*NL*
and
,
as
it
might
seem
,
of
the
obligations
to
her
he
had
taken
on
*NL*
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
think
if
he
writes
,
I
will
write
too
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
feel
ashamed
to
write
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
should
be
ashamed
to
write
to
Boris
.
I
'm
not
going
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
ashamed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
It
's
awkward
and
would
make
me
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
why
she
'd
be
ashamed
,
''
said
Petya
,
offended
by
Natasha
's
*NL*
previous
remark
.
``
It
's
because
she
was
in
love
with
that
fat
one
in
*NL*
spectacles
''
-LRB-
that
was
how
Petya
described
his
namesake
,
the
new
Count
*NL*
Bezukhov
-RRB-
``
and
now
she
's
in
love
with
that
singer

-LRB-
he
meant
Natasha
's
*NL*
Italian
singing
master
-RRB-
,
``
that
's
why
she
's
ashamed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Petya
,
you
're
a
stupid
!
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
stupid
than
you
,
madam
,
''
said
the
nine-year-old
Petya
,
with
*NL*
the
air
of
an
old
brigadier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
had
been
prepared
by
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
hints
at
dinner
.
On
*NL*
retiring
to
her
own
room
,
she
sat
in
an
armchair
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
*NL*
miniature
portrait
of
her
son
on
the
lid
of
a
snuffbox
,
while
the
tears
*NL*
kept
coming
into
her
eyes
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
with
the
letter
,
came
on
*NL*
tiptoe
to
the
countess
'
door
and
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
come
in
,
''
she
said
to
the
old
count
who
was
following
her
.
``
Come
*NL*
later
.
''
And
she
went
in
,
closing
the
door
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
put
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
heard
the
sound
of
indifferent
voices
,
then
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
's
voice
alone
in
a
long
speech
,
then
a
cry
,
then
silence
,
*NL*
then
both
voices
together
with
glad
intonations
,
and
then
footsteps
.
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
opened
the
door
.
Her
face
wore
the
proud
expression
of
*NL*
a
surgeon
who
has
just
performed
a
difficult
operation
and
admits
the
*NL*
public
to
appreciate
his
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
!
''
she
said
to
the
count
,
pointing
triumphantly
to
the
*NL*
countess
,
who
sat
holding
in
one
hand
the
snuffbox
with
its
portrait
and
*NL*
in
the
other
the
letter
,
and
pressing
them
alternately
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
the
count
,
she
stretched
out
her
arms
to
him
,
embraced
his
*NL*
bald
head
,
over
which
she
again
looked
at
the
letter
and
the
portrait
,
*NL*
and
in
order
to
press
them
again
to
her
lips
,
she
slightly
pushed
away
*NL*
the
bald
head
.
Vera
,
Natasha
,
Sonya
,
and
Petya
now
entered
the
room
,
and
*NL*
the
reading
of
the
letter
began
.
After
a
brief
description
of
the
*NL*
campaign
and
the
two
battles
in
which
he
had
taken
part
,
and
his
*NL*
promotion
,
Nicholas
said
that
he
kissed
his
father
's
and
mother
's
hands
*NL*
asking
for
their
blessing
,
and
that
he
kissed
Vera
,
Natasha
,
and
Petya
.
*NL*
Besides
that
,
he
sent
greetings
to
Monsieur
Schelling
,
Madame
Schoss
,
*NL*
and
his
old
nurse
,
and
asked
them
to
kiss
for
him
``
dear
Sonya
,
whom
he
*NL*
loved
and
thought
of
just
the
same
as
ever
.
''
When
she
heard
this
Sonya
*NL*
blushed
so
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
,
unable
to
bear
the
looks
*NL*
turned
upon
her
,
ran
away
into
the
dancing
hall
,
whirled
round
it
at
*NL*
full
speed
with
her
dress
puffed
out
like
a
balloon
,
and
,
flushed
and
*NL*
smiling
,
plumped
down
on
the
floor
.
The
countess
was
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
crying
,
Mamma
?
''
asked
Vera
.
``
From
all
he
says
one
should
be
*NL*
glad
and
not
cry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
quite
true
,
but
the
count
,
the
countess
,
and
Natasha
looked
at
*NL*
her
reproachfully
.
``
And
who
is
it
she
takes
after
?
''
thought
the
*NL*
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
'
letter
was
read
over
hundreds
of
times
,
and
those
who
were
*NL*
considered
worthy
to
hear
it
had
to
come
to
the
countess
,
for
she
did
*NL*
not
let
it
out
of
her
hands
.
The
tutors
came
,
and
the
nurses
,
and
*NL*
Dmitri
,
and
several
acquaintances
,
and
the
countess
reread
the
letter
*NL*
each
time
with
fresh
pleasure
and
each
time
discovered
in
it
fresh
*NL*
proofs
of
Nikolenka
's
virtues
.
How
strange
,
how
extraordinary
,
how
*NL*
joyful
it
seemed
,
that
her
son
,
the
scarcely
perceptible
motion
of
whose
*NL*
tiny
limbs
she
had
felt
twenty
years
ago
within
her
,
that
son
about
whom
*NL*
she
used
to
have
quarrels
with
the
too
indulgent
count
,
that
son
who
had
*NL*
first
learned
to
say
``
pear
''
and
then
``
granny
,
''
that
this
son
should
now
*NL*
be
away
in
a
foreign
land
amid
strange
surroundings
,
a
manly
warrior
*NL*
doing
some
kind
of
man
's
work
of
his
own
,
without
help
or
guidance
.
The
*NL*
universal
experience
of
ages
,
showing
that
children
do
grow
*NL*
imperceptibly
from
the
cradle
to
manhood
,
did
not
exist
for
the
*NL*
countess
.
Her
son
's
growth
toward
manhood
,
at
each
of
its
stages
,
had
*NL*
seemed
as
extraordinary
to
her
as
if
there
had
never
existed
the
*NL*
millions
of
human
beings
who
grew
up
in
the
same
way
.
As
twenty
years
*NL*
before
,
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
little
creature
who
lived
*NL*
somewhere
under
her
heart
would
ever
cry
,
suck
her
breast
,
and
begin
to
*NL*
speak
,
so
now
she
could
not
believe
that
that
little
creature
could
be
*NL*
this
strong
,
brave
man
,
this
model
son
and
officer
that
,
judging
by
this
*NL*
letter
,
he
now
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
style
!
How
charmingly
he
describes
!
''
said
she
,
reading
the
*NL*
descriptive
part
of
the
letter
.
``
And
what
a
soul
!
Not
a
word
about
*NL*
himself
...
Not
a
word
!
About
some
Denisov
or
other
,
though
he
himself
,
*NL*
I
dare
say
,
is
braver
than
any
of
them
.
He
says
nothing
about
his
*NL*
sufferings
.
What
a
heart
!
How
like
him
it
is
!
And
how
he
has
remembered
*NL*
everybody
!
Not
forgetting
anyone
.
I
always
said
when
he
was
only
so
*NL*
high
--
I
always
said
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
more
than
a
week
preparations
were
being
made
,
rough
drafts
of
*NL*
letters
to
Nicholas
from
all
the
household
were
written
and
copied
out
,
*NL*
while
under
the
supervision
of
the
countess
and
the
solicitude
of
the
*NL*
count
,
money
and
all
things
necessary
for
the
uniform
and
equipment
of
*NL*
the
newly
commissioned
officer
were
collected
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
*NL*
practical
woman
that
she
was
,
had
even
managed
by
favor
with
army
*NL*
authorities
to
secure
advantageous
means
of
communication
for
herself
*NL*
and
her
son
.
She
had
opportunities
of
sending
her
letters
to
the
Grand
*NL*
Duke
Constantine
Pavlovich
,
who
commanded
the
Guards
.
The
Rostovs
*NL*
supposed
that
The
Russian
Guards
,
Abroad
,
was
quite
a
definite
address
,
*NL*
and
that
if
a
letter
reached
the
Grand
Duke
in
command
of
the
Guards
*NL*
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
reach
the
Pavlograd
regiment
,
*NL*
which
was
presumably
somewhere
in
the
same
neighborhood
.
And
so
it
was
*NL*
decided
to
send
the
letters
and
money
by
the
Grand
Duke
's
courier
to
*NL*
Boris
and
Boris
was
to
forward
them
to
Nicholas
.
The
letters
were
from
*NL*
the
old
count
,
the
countess
,
Petya
,
Vera
,
Natasha
,
and
Sonya
,
and
*NL*
finally
there
were
six
thousand
rubles
for
his
outfit
and
various
other
*NL*
things
the
old
count
sent
to
his
son
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twelfth
of
November
,
Kutuzov
's
active
army
,
in
camp
before
*NL*
Olmutz
,
was
preparing
to
be
reviewed
next
day
by
the
two
Emperors
--
the
*NL*
Russian
and
the
Austrian
.
The
Guards
,
just
arrived
from
Russia
,
spent
*NL*
the
night
ten
miles
from
Olmutz
and
next
morning
were
to
come
straight
*NL*
to
the
review
,
reaching
the
field
at
Olmutz
by
ten
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
Nicholas
Rostov
received
a
letter
from
Boris
,
telling
him
that
*NL*
the
Ismaylov
regiment
was
quartered
for
the
night
ten
miles
from
Olmutz
*NL*
and
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
as
he
had
a
letter
and
money
for
him
.
*NL*
Rostov
was
particularly
in
need
of
money
now
that
the
troops
,
after
*NL*
their
active
service
,
were
stationed
near
Olmutz
and
the
camp
swarmed
*NL*
with
well-provisioned
sutlers
and
Austrian
Jews
offering
all
sorts
of
*NL*
tempting
wares
.
The
Pavlograds
held
feast
after
feast
,
celebrating
*NL*
awards
they
had
received
for
the
campaign
,
and
made
expeditions
to
*NL*
Olmutz
to
visit
a
certain
Caroline
the
Hungarian
,
who
had
recently
*NL*
opened
a
restaurant
there
with
girls
as
waitresses
.
Rostov
,
who
had
just
*NL*
celebrated
his
promotion
to
a
cornetcy
and
bought
Denisov
's
horse
,
*NL*
Bedouin
,
was
in
debt
all
round
,
to
his
comrades
and
the
sutlers
.
On
*NL*
receiving
Boris
'
letter
he
rode
with
a
fellow
officer
to
Olmutz
,
dined
*NL*
there
,
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
,
and
then
set
off
alone
to
the
Guards
'
*NL*
camp
to
find
his
old
playmate
.
Rostov
had
not
yet
had
time
to
get
his
*NL*
uniform
.
He
had
on
a
shabby
cadet
jacket
,
decorated
with
a
soldier
's
*NL*
cross
,
equally
shabby
cadet
's
riding
breeches
lined
with
worn
leather
,
*NL*
and
an
officer
's
saber
with
a
sword
knot
.
The
Don
horse
he
was
riding
*NL*
was
one
he
had
bought
from
a
Cossack
during
the
campaign
,
and
he
wore
a
*NL*
crumpled
hussar
cap
stuck
jauntily
back
on
one
side
of
his
head
.
As
he
*NL*
rode
up
to
the
camp
he
thought
how
he
would
impress
Boris
and
all
his
*NL*
comrades
of
the
Guards
by
his
appearance
--
that
of
a
fighting
hussar
who
*NL*
had
been
under
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Guards
had
made
their
whole
march
as
if
on
a
pleasure
trip
,
parading
*NL*
their
cleanliness
and
discipline
.
They
had
come
by
easy
stages
,
their
*NL*
knapsacks
conveyed
on
carts
,
and
the
Austrian
authorities
had
provided
*NL*
excellent
dinners
for
the
officers
at
every
halting
place
.
The
regiments
*NL*
had
entered
and
left
the
town
with
their
bands
playing
,
and
by
the
Grand
*NL*
Duke
's
orders
the
men
had
marched
all
the
way
in
step
-LRB-
a
practice
on
*NL*
which
the
Guards
prided
themselves
-RRB-
,
the
officers
on
foot
and
at
their
*NL*
proper
posts
.
Boris
had
been
quartered
,
and
had
marched
all
the
way
,
*NL*
with
Berg
who
was
already
in
command
of
a
company
.
Berg
,
who
had
*NL*
obtained
his
captaincy
during
the
campaign
,
had
gained
the
confidence
of
*NL*
his
superiors
by
his
promptitude
and
accuracy
and
had
arranged
his
money
*NL*
matters
very
satisfactorily
.
Boris
,
during
the
campaign
,
had
made
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
many
persons
who
might
prove
useful
to
him
,
and
by
a
*NL*
letter
of
recommendation
he
had
brought
from
Pierre
had
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
,
through
whom
he
hoped
to
obtain
*NL*
a
post
on
the
commander-in-chief
's
staff
.
Berg
and
Boris
,
having
rested
*NL*
after
yesterday
's
march
,
were
sitting
,
clean
and
neatly
dressed
,
at
a
*NL*
round
table
in
the
clean
quarters
allotted
to
them
,
playing
chess
.
Berg
*NL*
held
a
smoking
pipe
between
his
knees
.
Boris
,
in
the
accurate
way
*NL*
characteristic
of
him
,
was
building
a
little
pyramid
of
chessmen
with
*NL*
his
delicate
white
fingers
while
awaiting
Berg
's
move
,
and
watched
his
*NL*
opponent
's
face
,
evidently
thinking
about
the
game
as
he
always
thought
*NL*
only
of
whatever
he
was
engaged
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
that
?
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
try
to
,
''
replied
Berg
,
touching
a
pawn
and
then
removing
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
at
last
!
''
shouted
Rostov
.
``
And
Berg
too
!
Oh
,
you
*NL*
petisenfans
,
allay
cushay
dormir
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
imitating
his
Russian
*NL*
nurse
's
French
,
at
which
he
and
Boris
used
to
laugh
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
how
you
have
changed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
rose
to
meet
Rostov
,
but
in
doing
so
did
not
omit
to
steady
and
*NL*
replace
some
chessmen
that
were
falling
.
He
was
about
to
embrace
his
*NL*
friend
,
but
Nicholas
avoided
him
.
With
that
peculiar
feeling
of
youth
,
*NL*
that
dread
of
beaten
tracks
,
and
wish
to
express
itself
in
a
manner
*NL*
different
from
that
of
its
elders
which
is
often
insincere
,
Nicholas
*NL*
wished
to
do
something
special
on
meeting
his
friend
.
He
wanted
to
pinch
*NL*
him
,
push
him
,
do
anything
but
kiss
him
--
a
thing
everybody
did
.
But
*NL*
notwithstanding
this
,
Boris
embraced
him
in
a
quiet
,
friendly
way
and
*NL*
kissed
him
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
met
for
nearly
half
a
year
and
,
being
at
the
age
when
young
*NL*
men
take
their
first
steps
on
life
's
road
,
each
saw
immense
changes
in
*NL*
the
other
,
quite
a
new
reflection
of
the
society
in
which
they
had
taken
*NL*
those
first
steps
.
Both
had
changed
greatly
since
they
last
met
and
both
*NL*
were
in
a
hurry
to
show
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
damned
dandies
!
Clean
and
fresh
as
if
you
'd
been
to
a
fete
,
not
*NL*
like
us
sinners
of
the
line
,
''
cried
Rostov
,
with
martial
swagger
and
*NL*
with
baritone
notes
in
his
voice
,
new
to
Boris
,
pointing
to
his
own
mud
-
*NL*
bespattered
breeches
.
The
German
landlady
,
hearing
Rostov
's
loud
voice
,
*NL*
popped
her
head
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
is
she
pretty
?
''
he
asked
with
a
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
shout
so
?
You
'll
frighten
them
!
''
said
Boris
.
``
I
did
not
*NL*
expect
you
today
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
only
sent
you
the
note
yesterday
by
*NL*
Bolkonski
--
an
adjutant
of
Kutuzov
's
,
who
's
a
friend
of
mine
.
I
did
not
*NL*
think
he
would
get
it
to
you
so
quickly
...
Well
,
how
are
you
?
Been
*NL*
under
fire
already
?
''
asked
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
answering
,
Rostov
shook
the
soldier
's
Cross
of
St.
George
*NL*
fastened
to
the
cording
of
his
uniform
and
,
indicating
a
bandaged
arm
,
*NL*
glanced
at
Berg
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
see
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
Yes
,
yes
!
''
said
Boris
,
with
a
smile
.
``
And
we
too
have
had
a
*NL*
splendid
march
.
You
know
,
of
course
,
that
His
Imperial
Highness
rode
*NL*
with
our
regiment
all
the
time
,
so
that
we
had
every
comfort
and
every
*NL*
advantage
.
What
receptions
we
had
in
Poland
!
What
dinners
and
balls
!
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
you
.
And
the
Tsarevich
was
very
gracious
to
all
our
*NL*
officers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
two
friends
told
each
other
of
their
doings
,
the
one
of
his
*NL*
hussar
revels
and
life
in
the
fighting
line
,
the
other
of
the
pleasures
*NL*
and
advantages
of
service
under
members
of
the
Imperial
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
Guards
!
''
said
Rostov
.
``
I
say
,
send
for
some
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
made
a
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
really
want
it
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
his
bed
,
drew
a
purse
from
under
the
clean
pillow
,
and
sent
*NL*
for
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
have
some
money
and
a
letter
to
give
you
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
took
the
letter
and
,
throwing
the
money
on
the
sofa
,
put
both
*NL*
arms
on
the
table
and
began
to
read
.
After
reading
a
few
lines
,
he
*NL*
glanced
angrily
at
Berg
,
then
,
meeting
his
eyes
,
hid
his
face
behind
the
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
've
sent
you
a
tidy
sum
,
''
said
Berg
,
eying
the
heavy
purse
*NL*
that
sank
into
the
sofa
.
``
As
for
us
,
Count
,
we
get
along
on
our
pay
.
I
*NL*
can
tell
you
for
myself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Berg
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Rostov
,
``
when
you
get
a
letter
from
*NL*
home
and
meet
one
of
your
own
people
whom
you
want
to
talk
everything
*NL*
over
with
,
and
I
happen
to
be
there
,
I
'll
go
at
once
,
to
be
out
of
your
*NL*
way
!
Do
go
somewhere
,
anywhere
...
to
the
devil
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
and
*NL*
immediately
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
and
looking
amiably
into
his
*NL*
face
,
evidently
wishing
to
soften
the
rudeness
of
his
words
,
he
added
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
hurt
,
my
dear
fellow
;
you
know
I
speak
from
my
heart
as
to
an
*NL*
old
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
mention
it
,
Count
!
I
quite
understand
,
''
said
Berg
,
getting
up
*NL*
and
speaking
in
a
muffled
and
guttural
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
across
to
our
hosts
:
they
invited
you
,
''
added
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
put
on
the
cleanest
of
coats
,
without
a
spot
or
speck
of
dust
,
*NL*
stood
before
a
looking
glass
and
brushed
the
hair
on
his
temples
*NL*
upwards
,
in
the
way
affected
by
the
Emperor
Alexander
,
and
,
having
*NL*
assured
himself
from
the
way
Rostov
looked
at
it
that
his
coat
had
been
*NL*
noticed
,
left
the
room
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
what
a
beast
I
am
!
''
muttered
Rostov
,
as
he
read
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
pig
I
am
,
not
to
have
written
and
to
have
given
them
such
a
*NL*
fright
!
Oh
,
what
a
pig
I
am
!
''
he
repeated
,
flushing
suddenly
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
have
you
sent
Gabriel
for
some
wine
?
All
right
let
's
have
some
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
letter
from
his
parents
was
enclosed
a
letter
of
recommendation
*NL*
to
Bagration
which
the
old
countess
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
advice
had
*NL*
obtained
through
an
acquaintance
and
sent
to
her
son
,
asking
him
to
take
*NL*
it
to
its
destination
and
make
use
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
Much
I
need
it
!
''
said
Rostov
,
throwing
the
letter
under
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
thrown
that
away
?
''
asked
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
some
letter
of
recommendation
...
what
the
devil
do
I
want
it
*NL*
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
`
What
the
devil
'
?
''
said
Boris
,
picking
it
up
and
reading
the
*NL*
address
.
``
This
letter
would
be
of
great
use
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
nothing
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
anyone
's
adjutant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
inquired
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lackey
's
job
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
the
same
dreamer
,
I
see
,
''
remarked
Boris
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
still
the
same
diplomatist
!
But
that
's
not
the
point
...
*NL*
Come
,
how
are
you
?
''
asked
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
you
see
.
So
far
everything
's
all
right
,
but
I
confess
I
should
*NL*
much
like
to
be
an
adjutant
and
not
remain
at
the
front
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
once
a
man
starts
on
military
service
,
he
should
try
to
*NL*
make
as
successful
a
career
of
it
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
it
!
''
said
Rostov
,
evidently
thinking
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
intently
and
inquiringly
into
his
friend
's
eyes
,
evidently
*NL*
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
answer
to
some
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Gabriel
brought
in
the
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't
we
now
send
for
Berg
?
''
asked
Boris
.
``
He
would
drink
with
you
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
send
for
him
...
and
how
do
you
get
on
with
that
German
?
''
asked
*NL*
Rostov
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
very
,
very
nice
,
honest
,
and
pleasant
fellow
,
''
answered
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Rostov
looked
intently
into
Boris
'
eyes
and
sighed
.
Berg
returned
,
*NL*
and
over
the
bottle
of
wine
conversation
between
the
three
officers
*NL*
became
animated
.
The
Guardsmen
told
Rostov
of
their
march
and
how
they
*NL*
had
been
made
much
of
in
Russia
,
Poland
,
and
abroad
.
They
spoke
of
the
*NL*
sayings
and
doings
of
their
commander
,
the
Grand
Duke
,
and
told
stories
*NL*
of
his
kindness
and
irascibility
.
Berg
,
as
usual
,
kept
silent
when
the
*NL*
subject
did
not
relate
to
himself
,
but
in
connection
with
the
stories
of
*NL*
the
Grand
Duke
's
quick
temper
he
related
with
gusto
how
in
Galicia
he
*NL*
had
managed
to
deal
with
the
Grand
Duke
when
the
latter
made
a
tour
of
*NL*
the
regiments
and
was
annoyed
at
the
irregularity
of
a
movement
.
With
a
*NL*
pleasant
smile
Berg
related
how
the
Grand
Duke
had
ridden
up
to
him
in
a
*NL*
violent
passion
,
shouting
:
``
Arnauts
!
''
-LRB-
``
Arnauts
''
was
the
Tsarevich
's
*NL*
favorite
expression
when
he
was
in
a
rage
-RRB-
and
called
for
the
company
*NL*
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
,
Count
,
I
was
not
at
all
alarmed
,
because
I
knew
I
*NL*
was
right
.
Without
boasting
,
you
know
,
I
may
say
that
I
know
the
Army
*NL*
Orders
by
heart
and
know
the
Regulations
as
well
as
I
do
the
Lord
's
*NL*
Prayer
.
So
,
Count
,
there
never
is
any
negligence
in
my
company
,
and
so
*NL*
my
conscience
was
at
ease
.
I
came
forward
...
''
-LRB-
Berg
stood
up
and
showed
*NL*
how
he
presented
himself
,
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
,
and
really
it
would
*NL*
have
been
difficult
for
a
face
to
express
greater
respect
and
self
-
*NL*
complacency
than
his
did
.
-RRB-
``
Well
,
he
stormed
at
me
,
as
the
saying
is
,
*NL*
stormed
and
stormed
and
stormed
!
It
was
not
a
matter
of
life
but
rather
*NL*
of
death
,
as
the
saying
is
.
`
Albanians
!
'
and
`
devils
!
'
and
`
To
*NL*
Siberia
!
'
''
said
Berg
with
a
sagacious
smile
.
``
I
knew
I
was
in
the
right
*NL*
so
I
kept
silent
;
was
not
that
best
,
Count
?
...
`
Hey
,
are
you
dumb
?
'
he
*NL*
shouted
.
Still
I
remained
silent
.
And
what
do
you
think
,
Count
?
The
next
*NL*
day
it
was
not
even
mentioned
in
the
Orders
of
the
Day
.
That
's
what
*NL*
keeping
one
's
head
means
.
That
's
the
way
,
Count
,
''
said
Berg
,
lighting
*NL*
his
pipe
and
emitting
rings
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
was
fine
,
''
said
Rostov
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Boris
noticed
that
he
was
preparing
to
make
fun
of
Berg
,
and
*NL*
skillfully
changed
the
subject
.
He
asked
him
to
tell
them
how
and
where
*NL*
he
got
his
wound
.
This
pleased
Rostov
and
he
began
talking
about
it
,
and
*NL*
as
he
went
on
became
more
and
more
animated
.
He
told
them
of
his
Schon
*NL*
Grabern
affair
,
just
as
those
who
have
taken
part
in
a
battle
generally
*NL*
do
describe
it
,
that
is
,
as
they
would
like
it
to
have
been
,
as
they
*NL*
have
heard
it
described
by
others
,
and
as
sounds
well
,
but
not
at
all
as
*NL*
it
really
was
.
Rostov
was
a
truthful
young
man
and
would
on
no
account
*NL*
have
told
a
deliberate
lie
.
He
began
his
story
meaning
to
tell
*NL*
everything
just
as
it
happened
,
but
imperceptibly
,
involuntarily
,
and
*NL*
inevitably
he
lapsed
into
falsehood
.
If
he
had
told
the
truth
to
his
*NL*
hearers
--
who
like
himself
had
often
heard
stories
of
attacks
and
had
*NL*
formed
a
definite
idea
of
what
an
attack
was
and
were
expecting
to
hear
*NL*
just
such
a
story
--
they
would
either
not
have
believed
him
or
,
still
*NL*
worse
,
would
have
thought
that
Rostov
was
himself
to
blame
since
what
*NL*
generally
happens
to
the
narrators
of
cavalry
attacks
had
not
happened
*NL*
to
him
.
He
could
not
tell
them
simply
that
everyone
went
at
a
trot
and
*NL*
that
he
fell
off
his
horse
and
sprained
his
arm
and
then
ran
as
hard
as
*NL*
he
could
from
a
Frenchman
into
the
wood
.
Besides
,
to
tell
everything
as
*NL*
it
really
happened
,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
make
an
effort
of
*NL*
will
to
tell
only
what
happened
.
It
is
very
difficult
to
tell
the
truth
,
*NL*
and
young
people
are
rarely
capable
of
it
.
His
hearers
expected
a
story
*NL*
of
how
beside
himself
and
all
aflame
with
excitement
,
he
had
flown
like
*NL*
a
storm
at
the
square
,
cut
his
way
in
,
slashed
right
and
left
,
how
his
*NL*
saber
had
tasted
flesh
and
he
had
fallen
exhausted
,
and
so
on
.
And
so
he
*NL*
told
them
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
his
story
,
just
as
he
was
saying
:
``
You
can
not
imagine
*NL*
what
a
strange
frenzy
one
experiences
during
an
attack
,
''
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
whom
Boris
was
expecting
,
entered
the
room
.
Prince
Andrew
,
who
liked
to
*NL*
help
young
men
,
was
flattered
by
being
asked
for
his
assistance
and
*NL*
being
well
disposed
toward
Boris
,
who
had
managed
to
please
him
the
day
*NL*
before
,
he
wished
to
do
what
the
young
man
wanted
.
Having
been
sent
with
*NL*
papers
from
Kutuzov
to
the
Tsarevich
,
he
looked
in
on
Boris
,
hoping
to
*NL*
find
him
alone
.
When
he
came
in
and
saw
an
hussar
of
the
line
recounting
*NL*
his
military
exploits
-LRB-
Prince
Andrew
could
not
endure
that
sort
of
man
-RRB-
,
*NL*
he
gave
Boris
a
pleasant
smile
,
frowned
as
with
half-closed
eyes
he
*NL*
looked
at
Rostov
,
bowed
slightly
and
wearily
,
and
sat
down
languidly
on
*NL*
the
sofa
:
he
felt
it
unpleasant
to
have
dropped
in
on
bad
company
.
*NL*
Rostov
flushed
up
on
noticing
this
,
but
he
did
not
care
,
this
was
a
mere
*NL*
stranger
.
Glancing
,
however
,
at
Boris
,
he
saw
that
he
too
seemed
ashamed
*NL*
of
the
hussar
of
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
Prince
Andrew
's
disagreeable
,
ironical
tone
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
contempt
with
which
Rostov
,
from
his
fighting
army
point
of
view
,
*NL*
regarded
all
these
little
adjutants
on
the
staff
of
whom
the
newcomer
*NL*
was
evidently
one
,
Rostov
felt
confused
,
blushed
,
and
became
silent
.
*NL*
Boris
inquired
what
news
there
might
be
on
the
staff
,
and
what
,
without
*NL*
indiscretion
,
one
might
ask
about
our
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
probably
advance
,
''
replied
Bolkonski
,
evidently
reluctant
to
*NL*
say
more
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
took
the
opportunity
to
ask
,
with
great
politeness
,
whether
,
as
was
*NL*
rumored
,
the
allowance
of
forage
money
to
captains
of
companies
would
be
*NL*
doubled
.
To
this
Prince
Andrew
answered
with
a
smile
that
he
could
give
*NL*
no
opinion
on
such
an
important
government
order
,
and
Berg
laughed
*NL*
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
your
business
,
''
Prince
Andrew
continued
,
addressing
Boris
,
``
we
*NL*
will
talk
of
it
later
''
-LRB-
and
he
looked
round
at
Rostov
-RRB-
.
``
Come
to
me
*NL*
after
the
review
and
we
will
do
what
is
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
having
glanced
round
the
room
,
Prince
Andrew
turned
to
Rostov
,
*NL*
whose
state
of
unconquerable
childish
embarrassment
now
changing
to
*NL*
anger
he
did
not
condescend
to
notice
,
and
said
:
``
I
think
you
were
*NL*
talking
of
the
Schon
Grabern
affair
?
Were
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
there
,
''
said
Rostov
angrily
,
as
if
intending
to
insult
the
aide
-
*NL*
de-camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
noticed
the
hussar
's
state
of
mind
,
and
it
amused
him
.
With
a
*NL*
slightly
contemptuous
smile
,
he
said
:
``
Yes
,
there
are
many
stories
now
*NL*
told
about
that
affair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
stories
!
''
repeated
Rostov
loudly
,
looking
with
eyes
suddenly
grown
*NL*
furious
,
now
at
Boris
,
now
at
Bolkonski
.
``
Yes
,
many
stories
!
But
our
*NL*
stories
are
the
stories
of
men
who
have
been
under
the
enemy
's
fire
!
Our
*NL*
stories
have
some
weight
,
not
like
the
stories
of
those
fellows
on
the
*NL*
staff
who
get
rewards
without
doing
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
you
imagine
me
to
be
one
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
with
a
quiet
and
*NL*
particularly
amiable
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
feeling
of
exasperation
and
yet
of
respect
for
this
man
's
*NL*
self-possession
mingled
at
that
moment
in
Rostov
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
talking
about
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
do
n't
know
you
and
,
frankly
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
.
I
am
speaking
of
the
staff
in
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
will
tell
you
this
,
''
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
in
a
tone
of
quiet
*NL*
authority
,
``
you
wish
to
insult
me
,
and
I
am
ready
to
agree
with
you
that
*NL*
it
would
be
very
easy
to
do
so
if
you
have
n't
sufficient
self-respect
,
*NL*
but
admit
that
the
time
and
place
are
very
badly
chosen
.
In
a
day
or
two
*NL*
we
shall
all
have
to
take
part
in
a
greater
and
more
serious
duel
,
and
*NL*
besides
,
Drubetskoy
,
who
says
he
is
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
is
not
at
*NL*
all
to
blame
that
my
face
has
the
misfortune
to
displease
you
.
However
,
''
*NL*
he
added
rising
,
``
you
know
my
name
and
where
to
find
me
,
but
do
n't
*NL*
forget
that
I
do
not
regard
either
myself
or
you
as
having
been
at
all
*NL*
insulted
,
and
as
a
man
older
than
you
,
my
advice
is
to
let
the
matter
*NL*
drop
.
Well
then
,
on
Friday
after
the
review
I
shall
expect
you
,
*NL*
Drubetskoy
.
Au
revoir
!
''
exclaimed
Prince
Andrew
,
and
with
a
bow
to
them
*NL*
both
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
Prince
Andrew
was
gone
did
Rostov
think
of
what
he
ought
to
*NL*
have
said
.
And
he
was
still
more
angry
at
having
omitted
to
say
it
.
He
*NL*
ordered
his
horse
at
once
and
,
coldly
taking
leave
of
Boris
,
rode
home
.
*NL*
Should
he
go
to
headquarters
next
day
and
challenge
that
affected
*NL*
adjutant
,
or
really
let
the
matter
drop
,
was
the
question
that
worried
*NL*
him
all
the
way
.
He
thought
angrily
of
the
pleasure
he
would
have
at
*NL*
seeing
the
fright
of
that
small
and
frail
but
proud
man
when
covered
by
*NL*
his
pistol
,
and
then
he
felt
with
surprise
that
of
all
the
men
he
knew
*NL*
there
was
none
he
would
so
much
like
to
have
for
a
friend
as
that
very
*NL*
adjutant
whom
he
so
hated
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Rostov
had
been
to
see
Boris
,
a
review
was
held
of
the
*NL*
Austrian
and
Russian
troops
,
both
those
freshly
arrived
from
Russia
and
*NL*
those
who
had
been
campaigning
under
Kutuzov
.
The
two
Emperors
,
the
*NL*
Russian
with
his
heir
the
Tsarevich
,
and
the
Austrian
with
the
Archduke
,
*NL*
inspected
the
allied
army
of
eighty
thousand
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
early
morning
the
smart
clean
troops
were
on
the
move
,
forming
up
*NL*
on
the
field
before
the
fortress
.
Now
thousands
of
feet
and
bayonets
*NL*
moved
and
halted
at
the
officers
'
command
,
turned
with
banners
flying
,
*NL*
formed
up
at
intervals
,
and
wheeled
round
other
similar
masses
of
*NL*
infantry
in
different
uniforms
;
now
was
heard
the
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
*NL*
and
the
jingling
of
showy
cavalry
in
blue
,
red
,
and
green
braided
*NL*
uniforms
,
with
smartly
dressed
bandsmen
in
front
mounted
on
black
,
roan
,
*NL*
or
gray
horses
;
then
again
,
spreading
out
with
the
brazen
clatter
of
the
*NL*
polished
shining
cannon
that
quivered
on
the
gun
carriages
and
with
the
*NL*
smell
of
linstocks
,
came
the
artillery
which
crawled
between
the
*NL*
infantry
and
cavalry
and
took
up
its
appointed
position
.
Not
only
the
*NL*
generals
in
full
parade
uniforms
,
with
their
thin
or
thick
waists
drawn
*NL*
in
to
the
utmost
,
their
red
necks
squeezed
into
their
stiff
collars
,
and
*NL*
wearing
scarves
and
all
their
decorations
,
not
only
the
elegant
,
pomaded
*NL*
officers
,
but
every
soldier
with
his
freshly
washed
and
shaven
face
and
*NL*
his
weapons
clean
and
polished
to
the
utmost
,
and
every
horse
groomed
*NL*
till
its
coat
shone
like
satin
and
every
hair
of
its
wetted
mane
lay
*NL*
smooth
--
felt
that
no
small
matter
was
happening
,
but
an
important
and
*NL*
solemn
affair
.
Every
general
and
every
soldier
was
conscious
of
his
own
*NL*
insignificance
,
aware
of
being
but
a
drop
in
that
ocean
of
men
,
and
yet
*NL*
at
the
same
time
was
conscious
of
his
strength
as
a
part
of
that
*NL*
enormous
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
early
morning
strenuous
activities
and
efforts
had
begun
and
by
ten
*NL*
o'clock
all
had
been
brought
into
due
order
.
The
ranks
were
drawn
up
on
*NL*
the
vast
field
.
The
whole
army
was
extended
in
three
lines
:
the
cavalry
*NL*
in
front
,
behind
it
the
artillery
,
and
behind
that
again
the
infantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
space
like
a
street
was
left
between
each
two
lines
of
troops
.
The
*NL*
three
parts
of
that
army
were
sharply
distinguished
:
Kutuzov
's
fighting
*NL*
army
-LRB-
with
the
Pavlograds
on
the
right
flank
of
the
front
-RRB-
;
those
*NL*
recently
arrived
from
Russia
,
both
Guards
and
regiments
of
the
line
;
and
*NL*
the
Austrian
troops
.
But
they
all
stood
in
the
same
lines
,
under
one
*NL*
command
,
and
in
a
like
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
wind
over
leaves
ran
an
excited
whisper
:
``
They
're
coming
!
They
're
*NL*
coming
!
''
Alarmed
voices
were
heard
,
and
a
stir
of
final
preparation
*NL*
swept
over
all
the
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
direction
of
Olmutz
in
front
of
them
,
a
group
was
seen
*NL*
approaching
.
And
at
that
moment
,
though
the
day
was
still
,
a
light
gust
*NL*
of
wind
blowing
over
the
army
slightly
stirred
the
streamers
on
the
*NL*
lances
and
the
unfolded
standards
fluttered
against
their
staffs
.
It
*NL*
looked
as
if
by
that
slight
motion
the
army
itself
was
expressing
its
*NL*
joy
at
the
approach
of
the
Emperors
.
One
voice
was
heard
shouting
:
``
Eyes
*NL*
front
!
''
Then
,
like
the
crowing
of
cocks
at
sunrise
,
this
was
repeated
by
*NL*
others
from
various
sides
and
all
became
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
deathlike
stillness
only
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
.
This
was
*NL*
the
Emperors
'
suites
.
The
Emperors
rode
up
to
the
flank
,
and
the
*NL*
trumpets
of
the
first
cavalry
regiment
played
the
general
march
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
though
not
the
trumpeters
were
playing
,
but
as
if
the
army
*NL*
itself
,
rejoicing
at
the
Emperors
'
approach
,
had
naturally
burst
into
*NL*
music
.
Amid
these
sounds
,
only
the
youthful
kindly
voice
of
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
was
clearly
heard
.
He
gave
the
words
of
greeting
,
and
the
*NL*
first
regiment
roared
``
Hurrah
!
''
so
deafeningly
,
continuously
,
and
*NL*
joyfully
that
the
men
themselves
were
awed
by
their
multitude
and
the
*NL*
immensity
of
the
power
they
constituted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
standing
in
the
front
lines
of
Kutuzov
's
army
which
the
Tsar
*NL*
approached
first
,
experienced
the
same
feeling
as
every
other
man
in
*NL*
that
army
:
a
feeling
of
self-forgetfulness
,
a
proud
consciousness
of
*NL*
might
,
and
a
passionate
attraction
to
him
who
was
the
cause
of
this
*NL*
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
at
a
single
word
from
that
man
all
this
vast
mass
-LRB-
and
he
*NL*
himself
an
insignificant
atom
in
it
-RRB-
would
go
through
fire
and
water
,
*NL*
commit
crime
,
die
,
or
perform
deeds
of
highest
heroism
,
and
so
he
could
*NL*
not
but
tremble
and
his
heart
stand
still
at
the
imminence
of
that
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
Hurrah
!
Hurrah
!
''
thundered
from
all
sides
,
one
regiment
after
*NL*
another
greeting
the
Tsar
with
the
strains
of
the
march
,
and
then
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
...
Then
the
general
march
,
and
again
``
Hurrah
!
Hurrah
!
''
growing
*NL*
ever
stronger
and
fuller
and
merging
into
a
deafening
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
the
Tsar
reached
it
,
each
regiment
in
its
silence
and
immobility
*NL*
seemed
like
a
lifeless
body
,
but
as
soon
as
he
came
up
it
became
alive
,
*NL*
its
thunder
joining
the
roar
of
the
whole
line
along
which
he
had
*NL*
already
passed
.
Through
the
terrible
and
deafening
roar
of
those
voices
,
*NL*
amid
the
square
masses
of
troops
standing
motionless
as
if
turned
to
*NL*
stone
,
hundreds
of
riders
composing
the
suites
moved
carelessly
but
*NL*
symmetrically
and
above
all
freely
,
and
in
front
of
them
two
men
--
the
*NL*
Emperors
.
Upon
them
the
undivided
,
tensely
passionate
attention
of
that
*NL*
whole
mass
of
men
was
concentrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
young
Emperor
Alexander
,
in
the
uniform
of
the
Horse
*NL*
Guards
,
wearing
a
cocked
hat
with
its
peaks
front
and
back
,
with
his
*NL*
pleasant
face
and
resonant
though
not
loud
voice
,
attracted
everyone
's
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
was
not
far
from
the
trumpeters
,
and
with
his
keen
sight
had
*NL*
recognized
the
Tsar
and
watched
his
approach
.
When
he
was
within
twenty
*NL*
paces
,
and
Nicholas
could
clearly
distinguish
every
detail
of
his
*NL*
handsome
,
happy
young
face
,
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
tenderness
and
*NL*
ecstasy
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
.
Every
trait
and
every
*NL*
movement
of
the
Tsar
's
seemed
to
him
enchanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stopping
in
front
of
the
Pavlograds
,
the
Tsar
said
something
in
French
*NL*
to
the
Austrian
Emperor
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
smile
,
Rostov
involuntarily
smiled
himself
and
felt
a
still
*NL*
stronger
flow
of
love
for
his
sovereign
.
He
longed
to
show
that
love
in
*NL*
some
way
and
knowing
that
this
was
impossible
was
ready
to
cry
.
The
Tsar
*NL*
called
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
God
,
what
would
happen
to
me
if
the
Emperor
spoke
to
me
?
''
thought
*NL*
Rostov
.
``
I
should
die
of
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tsar
addressed
the
officers
also
:
``
I
thank
you
all
,
gentlemen
,
I
*NL*
thank
you
with
my
whole
heart
.
''
To
Rostov
every
word
sounded
like
a
*NL*
voice
from
heaven
.
How
gladly
would
he
have
died
at
once
for
his
Tsar
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
earned
the
St.
George
's
standards
and
will
be
worthy
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to
die
,
to
die
for
him
,
''
thought
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tsar
said
something
more
which
Rostov
did
not
hear
,
and
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
straining
their
lungs
,
shouted
``
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
too
,
bending
over
his
saddle
,
shouted
``
Hurrah
!
''
with
all
his
*NL*
might
,
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
injure
himself
by
that
shout
,
if
*NL*
only
to
express
his
rapture
fully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tsar
stopped
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
hussars
as
if
undecided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
the
Emperor
be
undecided
?
''
thought
Rostov
,
but
then
even
this
*NL*
indecision
appeared
to
him
majestic
and
enchanting
,
like
everything
else
*NL*
the
Tsar
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
hesitation
lasted
only
an
instant
.
The
Tsar
's
foot
,
in
the
narrow
*NL*
pointed
boot
then
fashionable
,
touched
the
groin
of
the
bobtailed
bay
*NL*
mare
he
rode
,
his
hand
in
a
white
glove
gathered
up
the
reins
,
and
he
*NL*
moved
off
accompanied
by
an
irregularly
swaying
sea
of
aides-de-camp
.
*NL*
Farther
and
farther
he
rode
away
,
stopping
at
other
regiments
,
till
at
*NL*
last
only
his
white
plumes
were
visible
to
Rostov
from
amid
the
suites
*NL*
that
surrounded
the
Emperors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
,
Rostov
noticed
Bolkonski
,
sitting
his
*NL*
horse
indolently
and
carelessly
.
Rostov
recalled
their
quarrel
of
*NL*
yesterday
and
the
question
presented
itself
whether
he
ought
or
ought
*NL*
not
to
challenge
Bolkonski
.
``
Of
course
not
!
''
he
now
thought
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
worth
thinking
or
speaking
of
it
at
such
a
moment
?
At
a
time
of
such
*NL*
love
,
such
rapture
,
and
such
self-sacrifice
,
what
do
any
of
our
quarrels
*NL*
and
affronts
matter
?
I
love
and
forgive
everybody
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Emperor
had
passed
nearly
all
the
regiments
,
the
troops
began
a
*NL*
ceremonial
march
past
him
,
and
Rostov
on
Bedouin
,
recently
purchased
*NL*
from
Denisov
,
rode
past
too
,
at
the
rear
of
his
squadron
--
that
is
,
alone
*NL*
and
in
full
view
of
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
reached
him
,
Rostov
,
who
was
a
splendid
horseman
,
spurred
*NL*
Bedouin
twice
and
successfully
put
him
to
the
showy
trot
in
which
the
*NL*
animal
went
when
excited
.
Bending
his
foaming
muzzle
to
his
chest
,
his
*NL*
tail
extended
,
Bedouin
,
as
if
also
conscious
of
the
Emperor
's
eye
upon
*NL*
him
,
passed
splendidly
,
lifting
his
feet
with
a
high
and
graceful
*NL*
action
,
as
if
flying
through
the
air
without
touching
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
himself
,
his
legs
well
back
and
his
stomach
drawn
in
and
feeling
*NL*
himself
one
with
his
horse
,
rode
past
the
Emperor
with
a
frowning
but
*NL*
blissful
face
``
like
a
vewy
devil
,
''
as
Denisov
expressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
fellows
,
the
Pavlograds
!
''
remarked
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
how
happy
I
should
be
if
he
ordered
me
to
leap
into
the
fire
*NL*
this
instant
!
''
thought
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
review
was
over
,
the
newly
arrived
officers
,
and
also
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
,
collected
in
groups
and
began
to
talk
about
the
awards
,
about
*NL*
the
Austrians
and
their
uniforms
,
about
their
lines
,
about
Bonaparte
,
*NL*
and
how
badly
the
latter
would
fare
now
,
especially
if
the
Essen
corps
*NL*
arrived
and
Prussia
took
our
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
talk
in
every
group
was
chiefly
about
the
Emperor
Alexander
.
His
*NL*
every
word
and
movement
was
described
with
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
had
but
one
wish
:
to
advance
as
soon
as
possible
against
the
*NL*
enemy
under
the
Emperor
's
command
.
Commanded
by
the
Emperor
himself
they
*NL*
could
not
fail
to
vanquish
anyone
,
be
it
whom
it
might
:
so
thought
*NL*
Rostov
and
most
of
the
officers
after
the
review
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
then
more
confident
of
victory
than
the
winning
of
two
battles
*NL*
would
have
made
them
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
the
review
,
Boris
,
in
his
best
uniform
and
with
his
*NL*
comrade
Berg
's
best
wishes
for
success
,
rode
to
Olmutz
to
see
Bolkonski
,
*NL*
wishing
to
profit
by
his
friendliness
and
obtain
for
himself
the
best
*NL*
post
he
could
--
preferably
that
of
adjutant
to
some
important
personage
,
*NL*
a
position
in
the
army
which
seemed
to
him
most
attractive
.
``
It
is
all
*NL*
very
well
for
Rostov
,
whose
father
sends
him
ten
thousand
rubles
at
a
*NL*
time
,
to
talk
about
not
wishing
to
cringe
to
anybody
and
not
be
anyone
's
*NL*
lackey
,
but
I
who
have
nothing
but
my
brains
have
to
make
a
career
and
*NL*
must
not
miss
opportunities
,
but
must
avail
myself
of
them
!
''
he
*NL*
reflected
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
find
Prince
Andrew
in
Olmutz
that
day
,
but
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
town
where
the
headquarters
and
the
diplomatic
corps
were
stationed
*NL*
and
the
two
Emperors
were
living
with
their
suites
,
households
,
and
*NL*
courts
only
strengthened
his
desire
to
belong
to
that
higher
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
no
one
,
and
despite
his
smart
Guardsman
's
uniform
,
all
these
*NL*
exalted
personages
passing
in
the
streets
in
their
elegant
carriages
*NL*
with
their
plumes
,
ribbons
,
and
medals
,
both
courtiers
and
military
men
,
*NL*
seemed
so
immeasurably
above
him
,
an
insignificant
officer
of
the
*NL*
Guards
,
that
they
not
only
did
not
wish
to
,
but
simply
could
not
,
be
*NL*
aware
of
his
existence
.
At
the
quarters
of
the
commander-in-chief
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
where
he
inquired
for
Bolkonski
,
all
the
adjutants
and
even
the
*NL*
orderlies
looked
at
him
as
if
they
wished
to
impress
on
him
that
a
great
*NL*
many
officers
like
him
were
always
coming
there
and
that
everybody
was
*NL*
heartily
sick
of
them
.
In
spite
of
this
,
or
rather
because
of
it
,
next
*NL*
day
,
November
15
,
after
dinner
he
again
went
to
Olmutz
and
,
entering
the
*NL*
house
occupied
by
Kutuzov
,
asked
for
Bolkonski
.
Prince
Andrew
was
in
and
*NL*
Boris
was
shown
into
a
large
hall
probably
formerly
used
for
dancing
,
*NL*
but
in
which
five
beds
now
stood
,
and
furniture
of
various
kinds
:
a
*NL*
table
,
chairs
,
and
a
clavichord
.
One
adjutant
,
nearest
the
door
,
was
*NL*
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
Persian
dressing
gown
,
writing
.
Another
,
the
*NL*
red
,
stout
Nesvitski
,
lay
on
a
bed
with
his
arms
under
his
head
,
*NL*
laughing
with
an
officer
who
had
sat
down
beside
him
.
A
third
was
*NL*
playing
a
Viennese
waltz
on
the
clavichord
,
while
a
fourth
,
lying
on
the
*NL*
clavichord
,
sang
the
tune
.
Bolkonski
was
not
there
.
None
of
these
*NL*
gentlemen
changed
his
position
on
seeing
Boris
.
The
one
who
was
writing
*NL*
and
whom
Boris
addressed
turned
round
crossly
and
told
him
Bolkonski
was
*NL*
on
duty
and
that
he
should
go
through
the
door
on
the
left
into
the
*NL*
reception
room
if
he
wished
to
see
him
.
Boris
thanked
him
and
went
to
*NL*
the
reception
room
,
where
he
found
some
ten
officers
and
generals
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
,
Prince
Andrew
,
his
eyes
drooping
contemptuously
-LRB-
with
*NL*
that
peculiar
expression
of
polite
weariness
which
plainly
says
,
``
If
it
*NL*
were
not
my
duty
I
would
not
talk
to
you
for
a
moment
''
-RRB-
,
was
listening
*NL*
to
an
old
Russian
general
with
decorations
,
who
stood
very
erect
,
almost
*NL*
on
tiptoe
,
with
a
soldier
's
obsequious
expression
on
his
purple
face
,
*NL*
reporting
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
be
so
good
as
to
wait
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
to
the
*NL*
general
,
in
Russian
,
speaking
with
the
French
intonation
he
affected
*NL*
when
he
wished
to
speak
contemptuously
,
and
noticing
Boris
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
paying
no
more
heed
to
the
general
who
ran
after
him
imploring
*NL*
him
to
hear
something
more
,
nodded
and
turned
to
him
with
a
cheerful
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Boris
clearly
realized
what
he
had
before
surmised
,
that
*NL*
in
the
army
,
besides
the
subordination
and
discipline
prescribed
in
the
*NL*
military
code
,
which
he
and
the
others
knew
in
the
regiment
,
there
was
*NL*
another
,
more
important
,
subordination
,
which
made
this
tight-laced
,
*NL*
purple-faced
general
wait
respectfully
while
Captain
Prince
Andrew
,
for
*NL*
his
own
pleasure
,
chose
to
chat
with
Lieutenant
Drubetskoy
.
More
than
*NL*
ever
was
Boris
resolved
to
serve
in
future
not
according
to
the
written
*NL*
code
,
but
under
this
unwritten
law
.
He
felt
now
that
merely
by
having
*NL*
been
recommended
to
Prince
Andrew
he
had
already
risen
above
the
general
*NL*
who
at
the
front
had
the
power
to
annihilate
him
,
a
lieutenant
of
the
*NL*
Guards
.
Prince
Andrew
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
you
did
not
find
me
in
yesterday
.
I
was
fussing
about
*NL*
with
Germans
all
day
.
We
went
with
Weyrother
to
survey
the
dispositions
.
*NL*
When
Germans
start
being
accurate
,
there
's
no
end
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
smiled
,
as
if
he
understood
what
Prince
Andrew
was
alluding
to
as
*NL*
something
generally
known
.
But
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
heard
*NL*
Weyrother
's
name
,
or
even
the
term
``
dispositions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
so
you
still
want
to
be
an
adjutant
?
I
have
been
*NL*
thinking
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
thinking
''
--
for
some
reason
Boris
could
not
help
blushing
--
*NL*
``
of
asking
the
commander-in-chief
.
He
has
had
a
letter
from
Prince
*NL*
Kuragin
about
me
.
I
only
wanted
to
ask
because
I
fear
the
Guards
wo
n't
*NL*
be
in
action
,
''
he
added
as
if
in
apology
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
.
We
'll
talk
it
over
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Only
*NL*
let
me
report
this
gentleman
's
business
,
and
I
shall
be
at
your
*NL*
disposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Prince
Andrew
went
to
report
about
the
purple-faced
general
,
that
*NL*
gentleman
--
evidently
not
sharing
Boris
'
conception
of
the
advantages
of
*NL*
the
unwritten
code
of
subordination
--
looked
so
fixedly
at
the
*NL*
presumptuous
lieutenant
who
had
prevented
his
finishing
what
he
had
to
*NL*
say
to
the
adjutant
that
Boris
felt
uncomfortable
.
He
turned
away
and
*NL*
waited
impatiently
for
Prince
Andrew
's
return
from
the
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
have
been
thinking
about
you
,
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
when
they
had
gone
into
the
large
room
where
the
clavichord
was
.
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
your
going
to
the
commander-in-chief
.
He
would
say
a
lot
of
*NL*
pleasant
things
,
ask
you
to
dinner
''
-LRB-
``
That
would
not
be
bad
as
regards
*NL*
the
unwritten
code
,
''
thought
Boris
-RRB-
,
``
but
nothing
more
would
come
of
it
.
*NL*
There
will
soon
be
a
battalion
of
us
aides-de-camp
and
adjutants
!
But
*NL*
this
is
what
we
'll
do
:
I
have
a
good
friend
,
an
adjutant
general
and
an
*NL*
excellent
fellow
,
Prince
Dolgorukov
;
and
though
you
may
not
know
it
,
the
*NL*
fact
is
that
now
Kutuzov
with
his
staff
and
all
of
us
count
for
nothing
.
*NL*
Everything
is
now
centered
round
the
Emperor
.
So
we
will
go
to
*NL*
Dolgorukov
;
I
have
to
go
there
anyhow
and
I
have
already
spoken
to
him
*NL*
about
you
.
We
shall
see
whether
he
can
not
attach
you
to
himself
or
find
*NL*
a
place
for
you
somewhere
nearer
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
always
became
specially
keen
when
he
had
to
guide
a
young
*NL*
man
and
help
him
to
worldly
success
.
Under
cover
of
obtaining
help
of
*NL*
this
kind
for
another
,
which
from
pride
he
would
never
accept
for
*NL*
himself
,
he
kept
in
touch
with
the
circle
which
confers
success
and
*NL*
which
attracted
him
.
He
very
readily
took
up
Boris
'
cause
and
went
with
*NL*
him
to
Dolgorukov
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
in
the
evening
when
they
entered
the
palace
at
Olmutz
*NL*
occupied
by
the
Emperors
and
their
retinues
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
day
a
council
of
war
had
been
held
in
which
all
the
members
of
*NL*
the
Hofkriegsrath
and
both
Emperors
took
part
.
At
that
council
,
contrary
*NL*
to
the
views
of
the
old
generals
Kutuzov
and
Prince
Schwartzenberg
,
it
*NL*
had
been
decided
to
advance
immediately
and
give
battle
to
Bonaparte
.
*NL*
The
council
of
war
was
just
over
when
Prince
Andrew
accompanied
by
Boris
*NL*
arrived
at
the
palace
to
find
Dolgorukov
.
Everyone
at
headquarters
was
*NL*
still
under
the
spell
of
the
day
's
council
,
at
which
the
party
of
the
*NL*
young
had
triumphed
.
The
voices
of
those
who
counseled
delay
and
advised
*NL*
waiting
for
something
else
before
advancing
had
been
so
completely
*NL*
silenced
and
their
arguments
confuted
by
such
conclusive
evidence
of
the
*NL*
advantages
of
attacking
that
what
had
been
discussed
at
the
council
--
the
*NL*
coming
battle
and
the
victory
that
would
certainly
result
from
it
--
no
*NL*
longer
seemed
to
be
in
the
future
but
in
the
past
.
All
the
advantages
*NL*
were
on
our
side
.
Our
enormous
forces
,
undoubtedly
superior
to
*NL*
Napoleon
's
,
were
concentrated
in
one
place
,
the
troops
inspired
by
the
*NL*
Emperors
'
presence
were
eager
for
action
.
The
strategic
position
where
*NL*
the
operations
would
take
place
was
familiar
in
all
its
details
to
the
*NL*
Austrian
General
Weyrother
:
a
lucky
accident
had
ordained
that
the
*NL*
Austrian
army
should
maneuver
the
previous
year
on
the
very
fields
where
*NL*
the
French
had
now
to
be
fought
;
the
adjacent
locality
was
known
and
*NL*
shown
in
every
detail
on
the
maps
,
and
Bonaparte
,
evidently
weakened
,
*NL*
was
undertaking
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolgorukov
,
one
of
the
warmest
advocates
of
an
attack
,
had
just
returned
*NL*
from
the
council
,
tired
and
exhausted
but
eager
and
proud
of
the
victory
*NL*
that
had
been
gained
.
Prince
Andrew
introduced
his
protege
,
but
Prince
*NL*
Dolgorukov
politely
and
firmly
pressing
his
hand
said
nothing
to
Boris
*NL*
and
,
evidently
unable
to
suppress
the
thoughts
which
were
uppermost
in
*NL*
his
mind
at
that
moment
,
addressed
Prince
Andrew
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
fellow
,
what
a
battle
we
have
gained
!
God
grant
that
the
*NL*
one
that
will
result
from
it
will
be
as
victorious
!
However
,
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
''
he
said
abruptly
and
eagerly
,
``
I
must
confess
to
having
been
*NL*
unjust
to
the
Austrians
and
especially
to
Weyrother
.
What
exactitude
,
*NL*
what
minuteness
,
what
knowledge
of
the
locality
,
what
foresight
for
*NL*
every
eventuality
,
every
possibility
even
to
the
smallest
detail
!
No
,
my
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
no
conditions
better
than
our
present
ones
could
have
been
*NL*
devised
.
This
combination
of
Austrian
precision
with
Russian
valor
--
what
*NL*
more
could
be
wished
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
attack
is
definitely
resolved
on
?
''
asked
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
my
dear
fellow
,
it
seems
to
me
that
Bonaparte
has
*NL*
decidedly
lost
bearings
,
you
know
that
a
letter
was
received
from
him
*NL*
today
for
the
Emperor
.
''
Dolgorukov
smiled
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
And
what
did
he
say
?
''
inquired
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
he
say
?
Tra-di-ri-di-ra
and
so
on
...
merely
to
gain
time
.
I
*NL*
tell
you
he
is
in
our
hands
,
that
's
certain
!
But
what
was
most
amusing
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
with
a
sudden
,
good-natured
laugh
,
``
was
that
we
could
not
*NL*
think
how
to
address
the
reply
!
If
not
as
`
Consul
'
and
of
course
not
as
*NL*
'Em
peror
,
'
it
seemed
to
me
it
should
be
to
`
General
Bonaparte
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
between
not
recognizing
him
as
Emperor
and
calling
him
General

Bonaparte
,
there
is
a
difference
,
''
remarked
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it
,
''
interrupted
Dolgorukov
quickly
,
laughing
.
``
You
know
*NL*
Bilibin
--
he
's
a
very
clever
fellow
.
He
suggested
addressing
him
as
*NL*
`
Usurper
and
Enemy
of
Mankind
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolgorukov
laughed
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
?
''
said
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
it
was
Bilibin
who
found
a
suitable
form
for
the
address
.
*NL*
He
is
a
wise
and
clever
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Head
of
the
French
Government
...
Au
chef
du
gouvernement
*NL*
francais
,
''
said
Dolgorukov
,
with
grave
satisfaction
.
``
Good
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
will
dislike
it
extremely
,
''
said
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
very
much
!
My
brother
knows
him
,
he
's
dined
with
him
--
the
*NL*
present
Emperor
--
more
than
once
in
Paris
,
and
tells
me
he
never
met
a
*NL*
more
cunning
or
subtle
diplomatist
--
you
know
,
a
combination
of
French
*NL*
adroitness
and
Italian
play-acting
!
Do
you
know
the
tale
about
him
and
*NL*
Count
Markov
?
Count
Markov
was
the
only
man
who
knew
how
to
handle
him
.
*NL*
You
know
the
story
of
the
handkerchief
?
It
is
delightful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
talkative
Dolgorukov
,
turning
now
to
Boris
,
now
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
told
how
Bonaparte
wishing
to
test
Markov
,
our
ambassador
,
*NL*
purposely
dropped
a
handkerchief
in
front
of
him
and
stood
looking
at
*NL*
Markov
,
probably
expecting
Markov
to
pick
it
up
for
him
,
and
how
Markov
*NL*
immediately
dropped
his
own
beside
it
and
picked
it
up
without
touching
*NL*
Bonaparte
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delightful
!
''
said
Bolkonski
.
``
But
I
have
come
to
you
,
Prince
,
as
a
*NL*
petitioner
on
behalf
of
this
young
man
.
You
see
...
''
but
before
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
could
finish
,
an
aide-de-camp
came
in
to
summon
Dolgorukov
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
nuisance
,
''
said
Dolgorukov
,
getting
up
hurriedly
and
*NL*
pressing
the
hands
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Boris
.
``
You
know
I
should
be
*NL*
very
glad
to
do
all
in
my
power
both
for
you
and
for
this
dear
young
*NL*
man
.
''
Again
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
latter
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
good-natured
,
sincere
,
and
animated
levity
.
``
But
you
see
...
another
*NL*
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
was
excited
by
the
thought
of
being
so
close
to
the
higher
powers
*NL*
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
at
that
moment
.
He
was
conscious
that
here
he
*NL*
was
in
contact
with
the
springs
that
set
in
motion
the
enormous
*NL*
movements
of
the
mass
of
which
in
his
regiment
he
felt
himself
a
tiny
,
*NL*
obedient
,
and
insignificant
atom
.
They
followed
Prince
Dolgorukov
out
*NL*
into
the
corridor
and
met
--
coming
out
of
the
door
of
the
Emperor
's
room
*NL*
by
which
Dolgorukov
had
entered
--
a
short
man
in
civilian
clothes
with
a
*NL*
clever
face
and
sharply
projecting
jaw
which
,
without
spoiling
his
face
,
*NL*
gave
him
a
peculiar
vivacity
and
shiftiness
of
expression
.
This
short
*NL*
man
nodded
to
Dolgorukov
as
to
an
intimate
friend
and
stared
at
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
with
cool
intensity
,
walking
straight
toward
him
and
evidently
*NL*
expecting
him
to
bow
or
to
step
out
of
his
way
.
Prince
Andrew
did
*NL*
neither
:
a
look
of
animosity
appeared
on
his
face
and
the
other
turned
*NL*
away
and
went
down
the
side
of
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
?
''
asked
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
,
but
to
me
most
unpleasant
of
men
--
the
*NL*
Minister
of
Foreign
Affairs
,
Prince
Adam
Czartoryski
...
It
is
such
men
*NL*
as
he
who
decide
the
fate
of
nations
,
''
added
Bolkonski
with
a
sigh
he
*NL*
could
not
suppress
,
as
they
passed
out
of
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
the
army
began
its
campaign
,
and
up
to
the
very
battle
of
*NL*
Austerlitz
,
Boris
was
unable
to
see
either
Prince
Andrew
or
Dolgorukov
*NL*
again
and
remained
for
a
while
with
the
Ismaylov
regiment
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
At
dawn
on
the
sixteenth
of
November
,
Denisov
's
squadron
,
in
which
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
served
and
which
was
in
Prince
Bagration
's
detachment
,
*NL*
moved
from
the
place
where
it
had
spent
the
night
,
advancing
into
action
*NL*
as
arranged
,
and
after
going
behind
other
columns
for
about
two
thirds
*NL*
of
a
mile
was
stopped
on
the
highroad
.
Rostov
saw
the
Cossacks
and
then
*NL*
the
first
and
second
squadrons
of
hussars
and
infantry
battalions
and
*NL*
artillery
pass
by
and
go
forward
and
then
Generals
Bagration
and
*NL*
Dolgorukov
ride
past
with
their
adjutants
.
All
the
fear
before
action
*NL*
which
he
had
experienced
as
previously
,
all
the
inner
struggle
to
*NL*
conquer
that
fear
,
all
his
dreams
of
distinguishing
himself
as
a
true
*NL*
hussar
in
this
battle
,
had
been
wasted
.
Their
squadron
remained
in
*NL*
reserve
and
Nicholas
Rostov
spent
that
day
in
a
dull
and
wretched
mood
.
*NL*
At
nine
in
the
morning
,
he
heard
firing
in
front
and
shouts
of
hurrah
,
*NL*
and
saw
wounded
being
brought
back
-LRB-
there
were
not
many
of
them
-RRB-
,
and
at
*NL*
last
he
saw
how
a
whole
detachment
of
French
cavalry
was
brought
in
,
*NL*
convoyed
by
a
sotnya
of
Cossacks
.
Evidently
the
affair
was
over
and
,
*NL*
though
not
big
,
had
been
a
successful
engagement
.
The
men
and
officers
*NL*
returning
spoke
of
a
brilliant
victory
,
of
the
occupation
of
the
town
of
*NL*
Wischau
and
the
capture
of
a
whole
French
squadron
.
The
day
was
bright
*NL*
and
sunny
after
a
sharp
night
frost
,
and
the
cheerful
glitter
of
that
*NL*
autumn
day
was
in
keeping
with
the
news
of
victory
which
was
conveyed
,
*NL*
not
only
by
the
tales
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
it
,
but
also
by
the
*NL*
joyful
expression
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
,
officers
,
generals
,
and
*NL*
adjutants
,
as
they
passed
Rostov
going
or
coming
.
And
Nicholas
,
who
had
*NL*
vainly
suffered
all
the
dread
that
precedes
a
battle
and
had
spent
that
*NL*
happy
day
in
inactivity
,
was
all
the
more
depressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
Wostov
.
Let
's
dwink
to
dwown
our
gwief
!
''
shouted
Denisov
,
*NL*
who
had
settled
down
by
the
roadside
with
a
flask
and
some
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
gathered
round
Denisov
's
canteen
,
eating
and
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
They
are
bringing
another
!
''
cried
one
of
the
officers
,
*NL*
indicating
a
captive
French
dragoon
who
was
being
brought
in
on
foot
by
*NL*
two
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
was
leading
by
the
bridle
a
fine
large
French
horse
he
had
*NL*
taken
from
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sell
us
that
horse
!
''
Denisov
called
out
to
the
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
,
your
honor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
got
up
and
stood
round
the
Cossacks
and
their
prisoner
.
The
*NL*
French
dragoon
was
a
young
Alsatian
who
spoke
French
with
a
German
*NL*
accent
.
He
was
breathless
with
agitation
,
his
face
was
red
,
and
when
he
*NL*
heard
some
French
spoken
he
at
once
began
speaking
to
the
officers
,
*NL*
addressing
first
one
,
then
another
.
He
said
he
would
not
have
been
*NL*
taken
,
it
was
not
his
fault
but
the
corporal
's
who
had
sent
him
to
seize
*NL*
some
horsecloths
,
though
he
had
told
him
the
Russians
were
there
.
And
at
*NL*
every
word
he
added
:
``
But
do
n't
hurt
my
little
horse
!
''
and
stroked
the
*NL*
animal
.
It
was
plain
that
he
did
not
quite
grasp
where
he
was
.
Now
he
*NL*
excused
himself
for
having
been
taken
prisoner
and
now
,
imagining
*NL*
himself
before
his
own
officers
,
insisted
on
his
soldierly
discipline
*NL*
and
zeal
in
the
service
.
He
brought
with
him
into
our
rearguard
all
the
*NL*
freshness
of
atmosphere
of
the
French
army
,
which
was
so
alien
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cossacks
sold
the
horse
for
two
gold
pieces
,
and
Rostov
,
being
the
*NL*
richest
of
the
officers
now
that
he
had
received
his
money
,
bought
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
hurt
my
little
horse
!
''
said
the
Alsatian
good-naturedly
to
*NL*
Rostov
when
the
animal
was
handed
over
to
the
hussar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
smilingly
reassured
the
dragoon
and
gave
him
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alley
!
Alley
!
''
said
the
Cossack
,
touching
the
prisoner
's
arm
to
make
*NL*
him
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
!
The
Emperor
!
''
was
suddenly
heard
among
the
hussars
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
began
to
run
and
bustle
,
and
Rostov
saw
coming
up
the
road
behind
*NL*
him
several
riders
with
white
plumes
in
their
hats
.
In
a
moment
everyone
*NL*
was
in
his
place
,
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
did
not
know
or
remember
how
he
ran
to
his
place
and
mounted
.
*NL*
Instantly
his
regret
at
not
having
been
in
action
and
his
dejected
mood
*NL*
amid
people
of
whom
he
was
weary
had
gone
,
instantly
every
thought
of
*NL*
himself
had
vanished
.
He
was
filled
with
happiness
at
his
nearness
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
.
He
felt
that
this
nearness
by
itself
made
up
to
him
for
the
*NL*
day
he
had
lost
.
He
was
happy
as
a
lover
when
the
longed-for
moment
of
*NL*
meeting
arrives
.
Not
daring
to
look
round
and
without
looking
round
,
he
*NL*
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
his
approach
.
He
felt
it
not
only
from
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
hoofs
of
the
approaching
cavalcade
,
but
because
as
he
drew
*NL*
near
everything
grew
brighter
,
more
joyful
,
more
significant
,
and
more
*NL*
festive
around
him
.
Nearer
and
nearer
to
Rostov
came
that
sun
shedding
*NL*
beams
of
mild
and
majestic
light
around
,
and
already
he
felt
himself
*NL*
enveloped
in
those
beams
,
he
heard
his
voice
,
that
kindly
,
calm
,
and
*NL*
majestic
voice
that
was
yet
so
simple
!
And
as
if
in
accord
with
Rostov
's
*NL*
feeling
,
there
was
a
deathly
stillness
amid
which
was
heard
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Pavlograd
hussars
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reserves
,
sire
!
''
replied
a
voice
,
a
very
human
one
compared
to
that
*NL*
which
had
said
:
``
The
Pavlograd
hussars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
drew
level
with
Rostov
and
halted
.
Alexander
's
face
was
even
*NL*
more
beautiful
than
it
had
been
three
days
before
at
the
review
.
It
*NL*
shone
with
such
gaiety
and
youth
,
such
innocent
youth
,
that
it
suggested
*NL*
the
liveliness
of
a
fourteen-year-old
boy
,
and
yet
it
was
the
face
of
*NL*
the
majestic
Emperor
.
Casually
,
while
surveying
the
squadron
,
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
eyes
met
Rostov
's
and
rested
on
them
for
not
more
than
two
*NL*
seconds
.
Whether
or
no
the
Emperor
understood
what
was
going
on
in
*NL*
Rostov
's
soul
-LRB-
it
seemed
to
Rostov
that
he
understood
everything
-RRB-
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
his
light-blue
eyes
gazed
for
about
two
seconds
into
Rostov
's
*NL*
face
.
A
gentle
,
mild
light
poured
from
them
.
Then
all
at
once
he
raised
*NL*
his
eyebrows
,
abruptly
touched
his
horse
with
his
left
foot
,
and
*NL*
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
Emperor
could
not
restrain
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
*NL*
battle
and
,
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
his
courtiers
,
at
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
left
the
third
column
with
which
he
had
been
and
galloped
toward
*NL*
the
vanguard
.
Before
he
came
up
with
the
hussars
,
several
adjutants
met
*NL*
him
with
news
of
the
successful
result
of
the
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
battle
,
which
consisted
in
the
capture
of
a
French
squadron
,
was
*NL*
represented
as
a
brilliant
victory
over
the
French
,
and
so
the
Emperor
*NL*
and
the
whole
army
,
especially
while
the
smoke
hung
over
the
*NL*
battlefield
,
believed
that
the
French
had
been
defeated
and
were
*NL*
retreating
against
their
will
.
A
few
minutes
after
the
Emperor
had
*NL*
passed
,
the
Pavlograd
division
was
ordered
to
advance
.
In
Wischau
*NL*
itself
,
a
petty
German
town
,
Rostov
saw
the
Emperor
again
.
In
the
market
*NL*
place
,
where
there
had
been
some
rather
heavy
firing
before
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
arrival
,
lay
several
killed
and
wounded
soldiers
whom
there
*NL*
had
not
been
time
to
move
.
The
Emperor
,
surrounded
by
his
suite
of
*NL*
officers
and
courtiers
,
was
riding
a
bobtailed
chestnut
mare
,
a
*NL*
different
one
from
that
which
he
had
ridden
at
the
review
,
and
bending
*NL*
to
one
side
he
gracefully
held
a
gold
lorgnette
to
his
eyes
and
looked
*NL*
at
a
soldier
who
lay
prone
,
with
blood
on
his
uncovered
head
.
The
*NL*
wounded
soldier
was
so
dirty
,
coarse
,
and
revolting
that
his
proximity
*NL*
to
the
Emperor
shocked
Rostov
.
Rostov
saw
how
the
Emperor
's
rather
round
*NL*
shoulders
shuddered
as
if
a
cold
shiver
had
run
down
them
,
how
his
left
*NL*
foot
began
convulsively
tapping
the
horse
's
side
with
the
spur
,
and
how
*NL*
the
well-trained
horse
looked
round
unconcerned
and
did
not
stir
.
An
*NL*
adjutant
,
dismounting
,
lifted
the
soldier
under
the
arms
to
place
him
on
*NL*
a
stretcher
that
had
been
brought
.
The
soldier
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gently
,
gently
!
Ca
n't
you
do
it
more
gently
?
''
said
the
Emperor
*NL*
apparently
suffering
more
than
the
dying
soldier
,
and
he
rode
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
saw
tears
filling
the
Emperor
's
eyes
and
heard
him
,
as
he
was
*NL*
riding
away
,
say
to
Czartoryski
:
``
What
a
terrible
thing
war
is
:
what
a
*NL*
terrible
thing
!
Quelle
terrible
chose
que
la
guerre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
troops
of
the
vanguard
were
stationed
before
Wischau
,
within
sight
*NL*
of
the
enemy
's
lines
,
which
all
day
long
had
yielded
ground
to
us
at
the
*NL*
least
firing
.
The
Emperor
's
gratitude
was
announced
to
the
vanguard
,
*NL*
rewards
were
promised
,
and
the
men
received
a
double
ration
of
vodka
.
*NL*
The
campfires
crackled
and
the
soldiers
'
songs
resounded
even
more
*NL*
merrily
than
on
the
previous
night
.
Denisov
celebrated
his
promotion
to
*NL*
the
rank
of
major
,
and
Rostov
,
who
had
already
drunk
enough
,
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
feast
proposed
the
Emperor
's
health
.
``
Not
`
our
Sovereign
,
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
'
as
they
say
at
official
dinners
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
the
health
of
*NL*
our
Sovereign
,
that
good
,
enchanting
,
and
great
man
!
Let
us
drink
to
his
*NL*
health
and
to
the
certain
defeat
of
the
French
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
fought
before
,
''
he
said
,
``
not
letting
the
French
pass
,
as
at
*NL*
Schon
Grabern
,
what
shall
we
not
do
now
when
he
is
at
the
front
?
We
will
*NL*
all
die
for
him
gladly
!
Is
it
not
so
,
gentlemen
?
Perhaps
I
am
not
saying
*NL*
it
right
,
I
have
drunk
a
good
deal
--
but
that
is
how
I
feel
,
and
so
do
*NL*
you
too
!
To
the
health
of
Alexander
the
First
!
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
rang
the
enthusiastic
voices
of
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
cavalry
captain
,
Kirsten
,
shouted
enthusiastically
and
no
*NL*
less
sincerely
than
the
twenty-year-old
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
officers
had
emptied
and
smashed
their
glasses
,
Kirsten
filled
*NL*
others
and
,
in
shirt
sleeves
and
breeches
,
went
glass
in
hand
to
the
*NL*
soldiers
'
bonfires
and
with
his
long
gray
mustache
,
his
white
chest
*NL*
showing
under
his
open
shirt
,
he
stood
in
a
majestic
pose
in
the
light
*NL*
of
the
campfire
,
waving
his
uplifted
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lads
!
here
's
to
our
Sovereign
,
the
Emperor
,
and
victory
over
our
*NL*
enemies
!
Hurrah
!
''
he
exclaimed
in
his
dashing
,
old
,
hussar
's
baritone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussars
crowded
round
and
responded
heartily
with
loud
shouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
that
night
,
when
all
had
separated
,
Denisov
with
his
short
hand
*NL*
patted
his
favorite
,
Rostov
,
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
there
's
no
one
to
fall
in
love
with
on
campaign
,
he
's
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
the
Tsar
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Denisov
,
do
n't
make
fun
of
it
!
''
cried
Rostov
.
``
It
is
such
a
lofty
,
*NL*
beautiful
feeling
,
such
a.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
,
I
believe
it
,
fwiend
,
and
I
share
and
appwove
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
do
n't
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Rostov
got
up
and
went
wandering
among
the
campfires
,
dreaming
of
*NL*
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
die
--
not
in
saving
the
Emperor
's
life
-LRB-
he
*NL*
did
not
even
dare
to
dream
of
that
-RRB-
,
but
simply
to
die
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
He
really
was
in
love
with
the
Tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
Russian
arms
*NL*
and
the
hope
of
future
triumph
.
And
he
was
not
the
only
man
to
*NL*
experience
that
feeling
during
those
memorable
days
preceding
the
battle
*NL*
of
Austerlitz
:
nine
tenths
of
the
men
in
the
Russian
army
were
then
in
*NL*
love
,
though
less
ecstatically
,
with
their
Tsar
and
the
glory
of
the
*NL*
Russian
arms
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
Emperor
stopped
at
Wischau
,
and
Villier
,
his
physician
,
*NL*
was
repeatedly
summoned
to
see
him
.
At
headquarters
and
among
the
troops
*NL*
near
by
the
news
spread
that
the
Emperor
was
unwell
.
He
ate
nothing
and
*NL*
had
slept
badly
that
night
,
those
around
him
reported
.
The
cause
of
this
*NL*
indisposition
was
the
strong
impression
made
on
his
sensitive
mind
by
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
killed
and
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
on
the
seventeenth
,
a
French
officer
who
had
come
with
a
*NL*
flag
of
truce
,
demanding
an
audience
with
the
Russian
Emperor
,
was
*NL*
brought
into
Wischau
from
our
outposts
.
This
officer
was
Savary
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
had
only
just
fallen
asleep
and
so
Savary
had
to
wait
.
At
midday
*NL*
he
was
admitted
to
the
Emperor
,
and
an
hour
later
he
rode
off
with
*NL*
Prince
Dolgorukov
to
the
advanced
post
of
the
French
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
rumored
that
Savary
had
been
sent
to
propose
to
Alexander
a
*NL*
meeting
with
Napoleon
.
To
the
joy
and
pride
of
the
whole
army
,
a
*NL*
personal
interview
was
refused
,
and
instead
of
the
Sovereign
,
Prince
*NL*
Dolgorukov
,
the
victor
at
Wischau
,
was
sent
with
Savary
to
negotiate
*NL*
with
Napoleon
if
,
contrary
to
expectations
,
these
negotiations
were
*NL*
actuated
by
a
real
desire
for
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
evening
Dolgorukov
came
back
,
went
straight
to
the
Tsar
,
and
*NL*
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
of
November
,
the
army
advanced
two
*NL*
days
'
march
and
the
enemy
's
outposts
after
a
brief
interchange
of
shots
*NL*
retreated
.
In
the
highest
army
circles
from
midday
on
the
nineteenth
,
a
*NL*
great
,
excitedly
bustling
activity
began
which
lasted
till
the
morning
*NL*
of
the
twentieth
,
when
the
memorable
battle
of
Austerlitz
was
fought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
midday
on
the
nineteenth
,
the
activity
--
the
eager
talk
,
running
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
and
dispatching
of
adjutants
--
was
confined
to
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
headquarters
.
But
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
,
this
activity
reached
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
headquarters
and
the
staffs
of
the
commanders
of
columns
.
By
*NL*
evening
,
the
adjutants
had
spread
it
to
all
ends
and
parts
of
the
army
,
*NL*
and
in
the
night
from
the
nineteenth
to
the
twentieth
,
the
whole
eighty
*NL*
thousand
allied
troops
rose
from
their
bivouacs
to
the
hum
of
voices
,
*NL*
and
the
army
swayed
and
started
in
one
enormous
mass
six
miles
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
concentrated
activity
which
had
begun
at
the
Emperor
's
headquarters
*NL*
in
the
morning
and
had
started
the
whole
movement
that
followed
was
like
*NL*
the
first
movement
of
the
main
wheel
of
a
large
tower
clock
.
One
wheel
*NL*
slowly
moved
,
another
was
set
in
motion
,
and
a
third
,
and
wheels
began
*NL*
to
revolve
faster
and
faster
,
levers
and
cogwheels
to
work
,
chimes
to
*NL*
play
,
figures
to
pop
out
,
and
the
hands
to
advance
with
regular
motion
*NL*
as
a
result
of
all
that
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
in
the
mechanism
of
a
clock
,
so
in
the
mechanism
of
the
military
*NL*
machine
,
an
impulse
once
given
leads
to
the
final
result
;
and
just
as
*NL*
indifferently
quiescent
till
the
moment
when
motion
is
transmitted
to
*NL*
them
are
the
parts
of
the
mechanism
which
the
impulse
has
not
yet
*NL*
reached
.
Wheels
creak
on
their
axles
as
the
cogs
engage
one
another
and
*NL*
the
revolving
pulleys
whirr
with
the
rapidity
of
their
movement
,
but
a
*NL*
neighboring
wheel
is
as
quiet
and
motionless
as
though
it
were
prepared
*NL*
to
remain
so
for
a
hundred
years
;
but
the
moment
comes
when
the
lever
*NL*
catches
it
and
obeying
the
impulse
that
wheel
begins
to
creak
and
joins
*NL*
in
the
common
motion
the
result
and
aim
of
which
are
beyond
its
ken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
in
a
clock
,
the
result
of
the
complicated
motion
of
innumerable
*NL*
wheels
and
pulleys
is
merely
a
slow
and
regular
movement
of
the
hands
*NL*
which
show
the
time
,
so
the
result
of
all
the
complicated
human
*NL*
activities
of
160,000
Russians
and
French
--
all
their
passions
,
desires
,
*NL*
remorse
,
humiliations
,
sufferings
,
outbursts
of
pride
,
fear
,
and
*NL*
enthusiasm
--
was
only
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
,
the
so-called
*NL*
battle
of
the
three
Emperors
--
that
is
to
say
,
a
slow
movement
of
the
*NL*
hand
on
the
dial
of
human
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
on
duty
that
day
and
in
constant
attendance
on
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
in
the
evening
,
Kutuzov
went
to
the
Emperor
's
headquarters
and
*NL*
after
staying
but
a
short
time
with
the
Tsar
went
to
see
the
grand
*NL*
marshal
of
the
court
,
Count
Tolstoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
took
the
opportunity
to
go
in
to
get
some
details
of
the
*NL*
coming
action
from
Dolgorukov
.
He
felt
that
Kutuzov
was
upset
and
*NL*
dissatisfied
about
something
and
that
at
headquarters
they
were
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
him
,
and
also
that
at
the
Emperor
's
headquarters
*NL*
everyone
adopted
toward
him
the
tone
of
men
who
know
something
others
do
*NL*
not
know
:
he
therefore
wished
to
speak
to
Dolgorukov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
d'you
do
,
my
dear
fellow
?
''
said
Dolgorukov
,
who
was
sitting
*NL*
at
tea
with
Bilibin
.
``
The
fete
is
for
tomorrow
.
How
is
your
old
fellow
?
*NL*
Out
of
sorts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
say
he
is
out
of
sorts
,
but
I
fancy
he
would
like
to
be
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
heard
him
at
the
council
of
war
and
will
hear
him
when
he
*NL*
talks
sense
,
but
to
temporize
and
wait
for
something
now
when
Bonaparte
*NL*
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
general
battle
is
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
seen
him
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Well
,
what
is
Bonaparte
*NL*
like
?
How
did
he
impress
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
,
and
am
convinced
that
he
fears
nothing
so
much
as
a
*NL*
general
engagement
,
''
repeated
Dolgorukov
,
evidently
prizing
this
general
*NL*
conclusion
which
he
had
arrived
at
from
his
interview
with
Napoleon
.
``
If
*NL*
he
were
n't
afraid
of
a
battle
why
did
he
ask
for
that
interview
?
Why
*NL*
negotiate
,
and
above
all
why
retreat
,
when
to
retreat
is
so
contrary
to
*NL*
his
method
of
conducting
war
?
Believe
me
,
he
is
afraid
,
afraid
of
a
*NL*
general
battle
.
His
hour
has
come
!
Mark
my
words
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
what
is
he
like
,
eh
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
in
a
gray
overcoat
,
very
anxious
that
I
should
call
him
*NL*
`
Your
Majesty
,
'
but
who
,
to
his
chagrin
,
got
no
title
from
me
!
That
's
*NL*
the
sort
of
man
he
is
,
and
nothing
more
,
''
replied
Dolgorukov
,
looking
*NL*
round
at
Bilibin
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Despite
my
great
respect
for
old
Kutuzov
,
''
he
continued
,
``
we
should
be
*NL*
a
nice
set
of
fellows
if
we
were
to
wait
about
and
so
give
him
a
chance
*NL*
to
escape
,
or
to
trick
us
,
now
that
we
certainly
have
him
in
our
hands
!
*NL*
No
,
we
must
n't
forget
Suvorov
and
his
rule
--
not
to
put
yourself
in
a
*NL*
position
to
be
attacked
,
but
yourself
to
attack
.
Believe
me
in
war
the
*NL*
energy
of
young
men
often
shows
the
way
better
than
all
the
experience
*NL*
of
old
Cunctators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
what
position
are
we
going
to
attack
him
?
I
have
been
at
the
*NL*
outposts
today
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
his
chief
forces
are
*NL*
situated
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
to
explain
to
Dolgorukov
a
plan
of
attack
he
had
himself
*NL*
formed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
is
all
the
same
,
''
Dolgorukov
said
quickly
,
and
getting
up
he
*NL*
spread
a
map
on
the
table
.
``
All
eventualities
have
been
foreseen
.
If
he
*NL*
is
standing
before
Brunn
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Prince
Dolgorukov
rapidly
but
indistinctly
explained
Weyrother
's
*NL*
plan
of
a
flanking
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
began
to
reply
and
to
state
his
own
plan
,
which
might
have
*NL*
been
as
good
as
Weyrother
's
,
but
for
the
disadvantage
that
Weyrother
's
*NL*
had
already
been
approved
.
As
soon
as
Prince
Andrew
began
to
demonstrate
*NL*
the
defects
of
the
latter
and
the
merits
of
his
own
plan
,
Prince
*NL*
Dolgorukov
ceased
to
listen
to
him
and
gazed
absent-mindedly
not
at
the
*NL*
map
,
but
at
Prince
Andrew
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
a
council
of
war
at
Kutuzov
's
tonight
,
though
;
you
can
*NL*
say
all
this
there
,
''
remarked
Dolgorukov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
so
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
moving
away
from
the
map
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
are
you
bothering
about
,
gentlemen
?
''
said
Bilibin
,
who
,
till
*NL*
then
,
had
listened
with
an
amused
smile
to
their
conversation
and
now
*NL*
was
evidently
ready
with
a
joke
.
``
Whether
tomorrow
brings
victory
or
*NL*
defeat
,
the
glory
of
our
Russian
arms
is
secure
.
Except
your
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
there
is
not
a
single
Russian
in
command
of
a
column

The
commanders
*NL*
are
:

le
Comte

le
Prince

Lichtenstein

le
Prince

de

,
and
finally
Prishprish
,
and
so
on
*NL*
like
all
those
Polish
names

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
backbiter
!
''
said
Dolgorukov
.
``
It
is
not
true
;
there
are
now
*NL*
two
Russians
,
Miloradovich
,
and
Dokhturov
,
and
there
would
be
a
third

*NL*
Count
Arakcheev
,
if
his
nerves
were
not
too
weak

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
I
think
General
Kutuzov
has
come
out
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
I
*NL*
wish
you
good
luck
and
success

gentlemen
!
''
he
added
and
went
out
after
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
Dolgorukov
and
Bilibin
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
,
Prince
Andrew
could
not
refrain
from
asking
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
silently
beside
him
,
what
he
thought
of
tomorrow
's
*NL*
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
sternly
at
his
adjutant
and
,
after
a
pause
,
replied
:
``
I
*NL*
think
the
battle
will
be
lost
,
and
so
I
told
Count
Tolstoy
and
asked
him
*NL*
to
tell
the
Emperor

What
do
you
think
he
replied
?

But
,
my
dear

I
am
engaged
with
rice

look
after
military
matters

yourself

Yes

the
answer
I

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
Weyrother
drove
with
his
plans
*NL*
to
Kutuzov
's
quarters
where
the
council
of
war
was
to
be
held
.
All
the
*NL*
commanders
of
columns
were
summoned
to
the
commander-in-chief
's
and
with
*NL*
the
exception
of
Prince
Bagration
,
who
declined
to
come
,
were
all
there
*NL*
at
the
appointed
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weyrother
,
who
was
in
full
control
of
the
proposed
battle
,
by
his
*NL*
eagerness
and
briskness
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
the
dissatisfied
*NL*
and
drowsy
Kutuzov
,
who
reluctantly
played
the
part
of
chairman
and
*NL*
president
of
the
council
of
war
.
Weyrother
evidently
felt
himself
to
be
*NL*
at
the
head
of
a
movement
that
had
already
become
unrestrainable
.
He
was
*NL*
like
a
horse
running
downhill
harnessed
to
a
heavy
cart
.
Whether
he
was
*NL*
pulling
it
or
being
pushed
by
it
he
did
not
know
,
but
rushed
along
at
*NL*
headlong
speed
with
no
time
to
consider
what
this
movement
might
lead
*NL*
to
.
Weyrother
had
been
twice
that
evening
to
the
enemy
's
picket
line
to
*NL*
reconnoiter
personally
,
and
twice
to
the
Emperors
,
Russian
and
Austrian
,
*NL*
to
report
and
explain
,
and
to
his
headquarters
where
he
had
dictated
the
*NL*
dispositions
in
German
,
and
now
,
much
exhausted
,
he
arrived
at
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
evidently
so
busy
that
he
even
forgot
to
be
polite
to
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
.
He
interrupted
him
,
talked
rapidly
and
indistinctly
,
*NL*
without
looking
at
the
man
he
was
addressing
,
and
did
not
reply
to
*NL*
questions
put
to
him
.
He
was
bespattered
with
mud
and
had
a
pitiful
,
*NL*
weary
,
and
distracted
air
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
haughty
and
*NL*
self-confident
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
occupying
a
nobleman
's
castle
of
modest
dimensions
near
*NL*
Ostralitz
.
In
the
large
drawing
room
which
had
become
the
commander
in
*NL*
chief
's
office
were
gathered
Kutuzov
himself
,
Weyrother
,
and
the
members
*NL*
of
the
council
of
war
.
They
were
drinking
tea
,
and
only
awaited
Prince
*NL*
Bagration
to
begin
the
council
.
At
last
Bagration
's
orderly
came
with
*NL*
the
news
that
the
prince
could
not
attend
.
Prince
Andrew
came
in
to
*NL*
inform
the
commander-in-chief
of
this
and
,
availing
himself
of
*NL*
permission
previously
given
him
by
Kutuzov
to
be
present
at
the
council
,
*NL*
he
remained
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
Prince
Bagration
is
not
coming
,
we
may
begin
,
''
said
Weyrother
,
*NL*
hurriedly
rising
from
his
seat
and
going
up
to
the
table
on
which
an
*NL*
enormous
map
of
the
environs
of
Brunn
was
spread
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
with
his
uniform
unbuttoned
so
that
his
fat
neck
bulged
over
*NL*
his
collar
as
if
escaping
,
was
sitting
almost
asleep
in
a
low
chair
,
*NL*
with
his
podgy
old
hands
resting
symmetrically
on
its
arms
.
At
the
sound
*NL*
of
Weyrother
's
voice
,
he
opened
his
one
eye
with
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
if
you
please
!
It
is
already
late
,
''
said
he
,
and
nodding
his
*NL*
head
he
let
it
droop
and
again
closed
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
at
first
the
members
of
the
council
thought
that
Kutuzov
was
*NL*
pretending
to
sleep
,
the
sounds
his
nose
emitted
during
the
reading
that
*NL*
followed
proved
that
the
commander-in-chief
at
that
moment
was
absorbed
*NL*
by
a
far
more
serious
matter
than
a
desire
to
show
his
contempt
for
the
*NL*
dispositions
or
anything
else
--
he
was
engaged
in
satisfying
the
*NL*
irresistible
human
need
for
sleep
.
He
really
was
asleep
.
Weyrother
,
with
*NL*
the
gesture
of
a
man
too
busy
to
lose
a
moment
,
glanced
at
Kutuzov
and
,
*NL*
having
convinced
himself
that
he
was
asleep
,
took
up
a
paper
and
in
a
*NL*
loud
,
monotonous
voice
began
to
read
out
the
dispositions
for
the
*NL*
impending
battle
,
under
a
heading
which
he
also
read
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dispositions
for
an
attack
on
the
enemy
position
behind
Kobelnitz
and
*NL*
Sokolnitz
,
November
30
,
1805
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispositions
were
very
complicated
and
difficult
.
They
began
as
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
the
enemy
's
left
wing
rests
on
wooded
hills
and
his
right
extends
*NL*
along
Kobelnitz
and
Sokolnitz
behind
the
ponds
that
are
there
,
while
we
,
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
with
our
left
wing
by
far
outflank
his
right
,
it
is
*NL*
advantageous
to
attack
the
enemy
's
latter
wing
especially
if
we
occupy
*NL*
the
villages
of
Sokolnitz
and
Kobelnitz
,
whereby
we
can
both
fall
on
his
*NL*
flank
and
pursue
him
over
the
plain
between
Schlappanitz
and
the
*NL*
Thuerassa
forest
,
avoiding
the
defiles
of
Schlappanitz
and
Bellowitz
*NL*
which
cover
the
enemy
's
front
.
For
this
object
it
is
necessary
that
...
*NL*
The
first
column
marches
...
The
second
column
marches
...
The
third
*NL*
column
marches
...
''
and
so
on
,
read
Weyrother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
generals
seemed
to
listen
reluctantly
to
the
difficult
dispositions
.
*NL*
The
tall
,
fair-haired
General
Buxhowden
stood
,
leaning
his
back
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
burning
candle
,
and
seemed
not
to
listen
*NL*
or
even
to
wish
to
be
thought
to
listen
.
Exactly
opposite
Weyrother
,
*NL*
with
his
glistening
wide-open
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
his
mustache
*NL*
twisted
upwards
,
sat
the
ruddy
Miloradovich
in
a
military
pose
,
his
*NL*
elbows
turned
outwards
,
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
his
shoulders
*NL*
raised
.
He
remained
stubbornly
silent
,
gazing
at
Weyrother
's
face
,
and
*NL*
only
turned
away
his
eyes
when
the
Austrian
chief
of
staff
finished
*NL*
reading
.
Then
Miloradovich
looked
round
significantly
at
the
other
*NL*
generals
.
But
one
could
not
tell
from
that
significant
look
whether
he
*NL*
agreed
or
disagreed
and
was
satisfied
or
not
with
the
arrangements
.
Next
*NL*
to
Weyrother
sat
Count
Langeron
who
,
with
a
subtle
smile
that
never
left
*NL*
his
typically
southern
French
face
during
the
whole
time
of
the
reading
,
*NL*
gazed
at
his
delicate
fingers
which
rapidly
twirled
by
its
corners
a
*NL*
gold
snuffbox
on
which
was
a
portrait
.
In
the
middle
of
one
of
the
*NL*
longest
sentences
,
he
stopped
the
rotary
motion
of
the
snuffbox
,
raised
*NL*
his
head
,
and
with
inimical
politeness
lurking
in
the
corners
of
his
*NL*
thin
lips
interrupted
Weyrother
,
wishing
to
say
something
.
But
the
*NL*
Austrian
general
,
continuing
to
read
,
frowned
angrily
and
jerked
his
*NL*
elbows
,
as
if
to
say
:
``
You
can
tell
me
your
views
later
,
but
now
be
so
*NL*
good
as
to
look
at
the
map
and
listen
.
''
Langeron
lifted
his
eyes
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
perplexity
,
turned
round
to
Miloradovich
as
if
seeking
an
*NL*
explanation
,
but
meeting
the
latter
's
impressive
but
meaningless
gaze
*NL*
drooped
his
eyes
sadly
and
again
took
to
twirling
his
snuffbox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
geography
lesson
!
''
he
muttered
as
if
to
himself
,
but
loud
enough
to
*NL*
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Przebyszewski
,
with
respectful
but
dignified
politeness
,
held
his
hand
*NL*
to
his
ear
toward
Weyrother
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
absorbed
in
*NL*
attention
.
Dohkturov
,
a
little
man
,
sat
opposite
Weyrother
,
with
an
*NL*
assiduous
and
modest
mien
,
and
stooping
over
the
outspread
map
*NL*
conscientiously
studied
the
dispositions
and
the
unfamiliar
locality
.
He
*NL*
asked
Weyrother
several
times
to
repeat
words
he
had
not
clearly
heard
*NL*
and
the
difficult
names
of
villages
.
Weyrother
complied
and
Dohkturov
*NL*
noted
them
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
reading
which
lasted
more
than
an
hour
was
over
,
Langeron
again
*NL*
brought
his
snuffbox
to
rest
and
,
without
looking
at
Weyrother
or
at
*NL*
anyone
in
particular
,
began
to
say
how
difficult
it
was
to
carry
out
*NL*
such
a
plan
in
which
the
enemy
's
position
was
assumed
to
be
known
,
*NL*
whereas
it
was
perhaps
not
known
,
since
the
enemy
was
in
movement
.
*NL*
Langeron
's
objections
were
valid
but
it
was
obvious
that
their
chief
aim
*NL*
was
to
show
General
Weyrother
--
who
had
read
his
dispositions
with
as
*NL*
much
self-confidence
as
if
he
were
addressing
school
children
--
that
he
*NL*
had
to
do
,
not
with
fools
,
but
with
men
who
could
teach
him
something
in
*NL*
military
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
monotonous
sound
of
Weyrother
's
voice
ceased
,
Kutuzov
opened
*NL*
his
eye
as
a
miller
wakes
up
when
the
soporific
drone
of
the
mill
wheel
*NL*
is
interrupted
.
He
listened
to
what
Langeron
said
,
as
if
remarking
,
``
So
*NL*
you
are
still
at
that
silly
business
!
''
quickly
closed
his
eye
again
,
and
*NL*
let
his
head
sink
still
lower
.
*NL*
*NL*
Langeron
,
trying
as
virulently
as
possible
to
sting
Weyrother
's
vanity
*NL*
as
author
of
the
military
plan
,
argued
that
Bonaparte
might
easily
*NL*
attack
instead
of
being
attacked
,
and
so
render
the
whole
of
this
plan
*NL*
perfectly
worthless
.
Weyrother
met
all
objections
with
a
firm
and
*NL*
contemptuous
smile
,
evidently
prepared
beforehand
to
meet
all
objections
*NL*
be
they
what
they
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
could
attack
us
,
he
would
have
done
so
today
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think
he
is
powerless
?
''
said
Langeron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
forty
thousand
men
at
most
,
''
replied
Weyrother
,
with
the
smile
*NL*
of
a
doctor
to
whom
an
old
wife
wishes
to
explain
the
treatment
of
a
*NL*
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
he
is
inviting
his
doom
by
awaiting
our
attack
,
''
said
*NL*
Langeron
,
with
a
subtly
ironical
smile
,
again
glancing
round
for
support
*NL*
to
Miloradovich
who
was
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miloradovich
was
at
that
moment
evidently
thinking
of
anything
*NL*
rather
than
of
what
the
generals
were
disputing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
!
''
said
he
,
``
tomorrow
we
shall
see
all
that
on
the
battlefield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weyrother
again
gave
that
smile
which
seemed
to
say
that
to
him
it
was
*NL*
strange
and
ridiculous
to
meet
objections
from
Russian
generals
and
to
*NL*
have
to
prove
to
them
what
he
had
not
merely
convinced
himself
of
,
but
*NL*
had
also
convinced
the
sovereign
Emperors
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
enemy
has
quenched
his
fires
and
a
continual
noise
is
heard
from
*NL*
his
camp
,
''
said
he
.
``
What
does
that
mean
?
Either
he
is
retreating
,
which
*NL*
is
the
only
thing
we
need
fear
,
or
he
is
changing
his
position
.
''
-LRB-
He
*NL*
smiled
ironically
.
-RRB-
``
But
even
if
he
also
took
up
a
position
in
the
*NL*
Thuerassa
,
he
merely
saves
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
all
our
*NL*
arrangements
to
the
minutest
detail
remain
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
...
''
began
Prince
Andrew
,
who
had
for
long
been
waiting
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
express
his
doubts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
here
woke
up
,
coughed
heavily
,
and
looked
round
at
the
generals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
the
dispositions
for
tomorrow
--
or
rather
for
today
,
for
it
*NL*
is
past
midnight
--
can
not
now
be
altered
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
have
heard
them
,
*NL*
and
we
shall
all
do
our
duty
.
But
before
a
battle
,
there
is
nothing
more
*NL*
important
...
''
he
paused
,
``
than
to
have
a
good
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
as
if
to
rise
.
The
generals
bowed
and
retired
.
It
was
past
*NL*
midnight
.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
council
of
war
,
at
which
Prince
Andrew
had
not
been
able
to
express
*NL*
his
opinion
as
he
had
hoped
to
,
left
on
him
a
vague
and
uneasy
*NL*
impression
.
Whether
Dolgorukov
and
Weyrother
,
or
Kutuzov
,
Langeron
,
and
*NL*
the
others
who
did
not
approve
of
the
plan
of
attack
,
were
right
--
he
did
*NL*
not
know
.
``
But
was
it
really
not
possible
for
Kutuzov
to
state
his
views
*NL*
plainly
to
the
Emperor
?
Is
it
possible
that
on
account
of
court
and
*NL*
personal
considerations
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
,
and
my
life
,
my
*NL*
life
,
''
he
thought
,
``
must
be
risked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
very
likely
that
I
shall
be
killed
tomorrow
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
And
suddenly
,
at
this
thought
of
death
,
a
whole
series
of
most
distant
,
*NL*
most
intimate
,
memories
rose
in
his
imagination
:
he
remembered
his
last
*NL*
parting
from
his
father
and
his
wife
;
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
*NL*
first
loved
her
.
He
thought
of
her
pregnancy
and
felt
sorry
for
her
and
*NL*
for
himself
,
and
in
a
nervously
emotional
and
softened
mood
he
went
out
*NL*
of
the
hut
in
which
he
was
billeted
with
Nesvitski
and
began
to
walk
up
*NL*
and
down
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
foggy
and
through
the
fog
the
moonlight
gleamed
*NL*
mysteriously
.
``
Yes
,
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
!
''
he
thought
.
``
Tomorrow
*NL*
everything
may
be
over
for
me
!
All
these
memories
will
be
no
more
,
none
*NL*
of
them
will
have
any
meaning
for
me
.
Tomorrow
perhaps
,
even
certainly
,
*NL*
I
have
a
presentiment
that
for
the
first
time
I
shall
have
to
show
all
I
*NL*
can
do
.
''
And
his
fancy
pictured
the
battle
,
its
loss
,
the
concentration
*NL*
of
fighting
at
one
point
,
and
the
hesitation
of
all
the
commanders
.
And
*NL*
then
that
happy
moment
,
that
Toulon
for
which
he
had
so
long
waited
,
*NL*
presents
itself
to
him
at
last
.
He
firmly
and
clearly
expresses
his
*NL*
opinion
to
Kutuzov
,
to
Weyrother
,
and
to
the
Emperors
.
All
are
struck
by
*NL*
the
justness
of
his
views
,
but
no
one
undertakes
to
carry
them
out
,
so
*NL*
he
takes
a
regiment
,
a
division-stipulates
that
no
one
is
to
interfere
*NL*
with
his
arrangements
--
leads
his
division
to
the
decisive
point
,
and
*NL*
gains
the
victory
alone
.
``
But
death
and
suffering
?
''
suggested
another
*NL*
voice
.
Prince
Andrew
,
however
,
did
not
answer
that
voice
and
went
on
*NL*
dreaming
of
his
triumphs
.
The
dispositions
for
the
next
battle
are
*NL*
planned
by
him
alone
.
Nominally
he
is
only
an
adjutant
on
Kutuzov
's
*NL*
staff
,
but
he
does
everything
alone
.
The
next
battle
is
won
by
him
*NL*
alone
.
Kutuzov
is
removed
and
he
is
appointed
...
``
Well
and
then
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
other
voice
.
``
If
before
that
you
are
not
ten
times
wounded
,
killed
,
*NL*
or
betrayed
,
well
...
what
then
?
...
''
``
Well
then
,
''
Prince
Andrew
answered
*NL*
himself
,
``
I
do
n't
know
what
will
happen
and
do
n't
want
to
know
,
and
*NL*
ca
n't
,
but
if
I
want
this
--
want
glory
,
want
to
be
known
to
men
,
want
to
*NL*
be
loved
by
them
,
it
is
not
my
fault
that
I
want
it
and
want
nothing
but
*NL*
that
and
live
only
for
that
.
Yes
,
for
that
alone
!
I
shall
never
tell
*NL*
anyone
,
but
,
oh
God
!
what
am
I
to
do
if
I
love
nothing
but
fame
and
*NL*
men
's
esteem
?
Death
,
wounds
,
the
loss
of
family
--
I
fear
nothing
.
And
*NL*
precious
and
dear
as
many
persons
are
to
me
--
father
,
sister
,
wife
--
those
*NL*
dearest
to
me
--
yet
dreadful
and
unnatural
as
it
seems
,
I
would
give
them
*NL*
all
at
once
for
a
moment
of
glory
,
of
triumph
over
men
,
of
love
from
men
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
and
never
shall
know
,
for
the
love
of
these
men
here
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
as
he
listened
to
voices
in
Kutuzov
's
courtyard
.
The
voices
*NL*
were
those
of
the
orderlies
who
were
packing
up
;
one
voice
,
probably
a
*NL*
coachman
's
,
was
teasing
Kutuzov
's
old
cook
whom
Prince
Andrew
knew
,
and
*NL*
who
was
called
Tit
.
He
was
saying
,
``
Tit
,
I
say
,
Tit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
returned
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Tit
,
thresh
a
bit
!
''
said
the
wag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
to
the
devil
!
''
called
out
a
voice
,
drowned
by
the
laughter
of
*NL*
the
orderlies
and
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
I
love
and
value
nothing
but
triumph
over
them
all
,
I
*NL*
value
this
mystic
power
and
glory
that
is
floating
here
above
me
in
this
*NL*
mist
!

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
night
,
Rostov
was
with
a
platoon
on
skirmishing
duty
in
front
*NL*
of
Bagration
's
detachment
.
His
hussars
were
placed
along
the
line
in
*NL*
couples
and
he
himself
rode
along
the
line
trying
to
master
the
*NL*
sleepiness
that
kept
coming
over
him
.
An
enormous
space
,
with
our
army
's
*NL*
campfires
dimly
glowing
in
the
fog
,
could
be
seen
behind
him
;
in
front
*NL*
of
him
was
misty
darkness
.
Rostov
could
see
nothing
,
peer
as
he
would
*NL*
into
that
foggy
distance
:
now
something
gleamed
gray
,
now
there
was
*NL*
something
black
,
now
little
lights
seemed
to
glimmer
where
the
enemy
*NL*
ought
to
be
,
now
he
fancied
it
was
only
something
in
his
own
eyes
.
His
*NL*
eyes
kept
closing
,
and
in
his
fancy
appeared
--
now
the
Emperor
,
now
*NL*
Denisov
,
and
now
Moscow
memories
--
and
he
again
hurriedly
opened
his
eyes
*NL*
and
saw
close
before
him
the
head
and
ears
of
the
horse
he
was
riding
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
,
when
he
came
within
six
paces
of
them
,
the
black
figures
*NL*
of
hussars
,
but
in
the
distance
was
still
the
same
misty
darkness
.
``
Why
*NL*
not
?
...
It
might
easily
happen
,
''
thought
Rostov
,
``
that
the
Emperor
will
*NL*
meet
me
and
give
me
an
order
as
he
would
to
any
other
officer
;
he
'll
*NL*
say
:
`
Go
and
find
out
what
's
there
.
'
There
are
many
stories
of
his
*NL*
getting
to
know
an
officer
in
just
such
a
chance
way
and
attaching
him
*NL*
to
himself
!
What
if
he
gave
me
a
place
near
him
?
Oh
,
how
I
would
guard
*NL*
him
,
how
I
would
tell
him
the
truth
,
how
I
would
unmask
his
deceivers
!
''
*NL*
And
in
order
to
realize
vividly
his
love
devotion
to
the
sovereign
,
*NL*
Rostov
pictured
to
himself
an
enemy
or
a
deceitful
German
,
whom
he
would
*NL*
not
only
kill
with
pleasure
but
whom
he
would
slap
in
the
face
before
*NL*
the
Emperor
.
Suddenly
a
distant
shout
aroused
him
.
He
started
and
opened
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
?
Oh
yes
,
in
the
skirmishing
line
...
pass
and
watchword
--
*NL*
shaft
,
Olmutz
.
What
a
nuisance
that
our
squadron
will
be
in
reserve
*NL*
tomorrow
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
'll
ask
leave
to
go
to
the
front
,
this
may
be
*NL*
my
only
chance
of
seeing
the
Emperor
.
It
wo
n't
be
long
now
before
I
am
*NL*
off
duty
.
I
'll
take
another
turn
and
when
I
get
back
I
'll
go
to
the
*NL*
general
and
ask
him
.
''
He
readjusted
himself
in
the
saddle
and
touched
up
*NL*
his
horse
to
ride
once
more
round
his
hussars
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
it
*NL*
was
getting
lighter
.
To
the
left
he
saw
a
sloping
descent
lit
up
,
and
*NL*
facing
it
a
black
knoll
that
seemed
as
steep
as
a
wall
.
On
this
knoll
*NL*
there
was
a
white
patch
that
Rostov
could
not
at
all
make
out
:
was
it
a
*NL*
glade
in
the
wood
lit
up
by
the
moon
,
or
some
unmelted
snow
,
or
some
*NL*
white
houses
?
He
even
thought
something
moved
on
that
white
spot
.
``
I
*NL*
expect
it
's
snow
...
that
spot
...
a
spot
--
une
tache
,
''
he
thought
.
``
There
*NL*
now
...
it
's
not
a
tache
...
Natasha
...
sister
,
black
eyes
...
Na
...
*NL*
tasha
...
-LRB-
Wo
n't
she
be
surprised
when
I
tell
her
how
I
've
seen
the
*NL*
Emperor
?
-RRB-
Natasha
...
take
my
sabretache
...
''
--
``
Keep
to
the
right
,
your
*NL*
honor
,
there
are
bushes
here
,
''
came
the
voice
of
an
hussar
,
past
whom
*NL*
Rostov
was
riding
in
the
act
of
falling
asleep
.
Rostov
lifted
his
head
*NL*
that
had
sunk
almost
to
his
horse
's
mane
and
pulled
up
beside
the
*NL*
hussar
.
He
was
succumbing
to
irresistible
,
youthful
,
childish
*NL*
drowsiness
.
``
But
what
was
I
thinking
?
I
must
n't
forget
.
How
shall
I
*NL*
speak
to
the
Emperor
?
No
,
that
's
not
it
--
that
's
tomorrow
.
Oh
yes
!
*NL*
Natasha
...
sabretache
...
saber
them
...
Whom
?
The
hussars
...
Ah
,
the
*NL*
hussars
with
mustaches
.
Along
the
Tverskaya
Street
rode
the
hussar
with
*NL*
mustaches
...
I
thought
about
him
too
,
just
opposite
Guryev
's
house
...
*NL*
Old
Guryev
...
Oh
,
but
Denisov
's
a
fine
fellow
.
But
that
's
all
nonsense
.
*NL*
The
chief
thing
is
that
the
Emperor
is
here
.
How
he
looked
at
me
and
*NL*
wished
to
say
something
,
but
dared
not
...
No
,
it
was
I
who
dared
not
.
*NL*
But
that
's
nonsense
,
the
chief
thing
is
not
to
forget
the
important
*NL*
thing
I
was
thinking
of
.
Yes
,
Na-tasha
,
sabretache
,
oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
That
's
*NL*
right
!
''
And
his
head
once
more
sank
to
his
horse
's
neck
.
All
at
once
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
being
fired
at
.
``
What
?
What
?
What
?
...
Cut
them
*NL*
down
!
What
?
...
''
said
Rostov
,
waking
up
.
At
the
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
*NL*
he
heard
in
front
of
him
,
where
the
enemy
was
,
the
long-drawn
shouts
of
*NL*
thousands
of
voices
.
His
horse
and
the
horse
of
the
hussar
near
him
*NL*
pricked
their
ears
at
these
shouts
.
Over
there
,
where
the
shouting
came
*NL*
from
,
a
fire
flared
up
and
went
out
again
,
then
another
,
and
all
along
*NL*
the
French
line
on
the
hill
fires
flared
up
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
*NL*
and
louder
.
Rostov
could
hear
the
sound
of
French
words
but
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
them
.
The
din
of
many
voices
was
too
great
;
all
he
could
*NL*
hear
was
:
``
ahahah
!
''
and
``
rrrr
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
What
do
you
make
of
it
?
''
said
Rostov
to
the
hussar
beside
*NL*
him
.
``
That
must
be
the
enemy
's
camp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussar
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
hear
it
?
''
Rostov
asked
again
,
after
waiting
for
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
tell
,
your
honor
?
''
replied
the
hussar
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
direction
,
it
must
be
the
enemy
,
''
repeated
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
he
or
it
may
be
nothing
,
''
muttered
the
hussar
.
``
It
's
dark
...
*NL*
Steady
!
''
he
cried
to
his
fidgeting
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
's
horse
was
also
getting
restive
:
it
pawed
the
frozen
ground
,
*NL*
pricking
its
ears
at
the
noise
and
looking
at
the
lights
.
The
shouting
*NL*
grew
still
louder
and
merged
into
a
general
roar
that
only
an
army
of
*NL*
several
thousand
men
could
produce
.
The
lights
spread
farther
and
*NL*
farther
,
probably
along
the
line
of
the
French
camp
.
Rostov
no
longer
*NL*
wanted
to
sleep
.
The
gay
triumphant
shouting
of
the
enemy
army
had
a
*NL*
stimulating
effect
on
him
.
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
L'Empereur
!
''
he
now
heard
*NL*
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
be
far
off
,
probably
just
beyond
the
stream
,
''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
hussar
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussar
only
sighed
without
replying
and
coughed
angrily
.
The
sound
*NL*
of
horse
's
hoofs
approaching
at
a
trot
along
the
line
of
hussars
was
*NL*
heard
,
and
out
of
the
foggy
darkness
the
figure
of
a
sergeant
of
hussars
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
,
looming
huge
as
an
elephant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
the
generals
!
''
said
the
sergeant
,
riding
up
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
still
looking
round
toward
the
fires
and
the
shouts
,
rode
with
*NL*
the
sergeant
to
meet
some
mounted
men
who
were
riding
along
the
line
.
*NL*
One
was
on
a
white
horse
.
Prince
Bagration
and
Prince
Dolgorukov
with
*NL*
their
adjutants
had
come
to
witness
the
curious
phenomenon
of
the
lights
*NL*
and
shouts
in
the
enemy
's
camp
.
Rostov
rode
up
to
Bagration
,
reported
to
*NL*
him
,
and
then
joined
the
adjutants
listening
to
what
the
generals
were
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
''
said
Prince
Dolgorukov
,
addressing
Bagration
,
``
it
is
*NL*
nothing
but
a
trick
!
He
has
retreated
and
ordered
the
rearguard
to
*NL*
kindle
fires
and
make
a
noise
to
deceive
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
,
''
said
Bagration
.
``
I
saw
them
this
evening
on
that
knoll
;
if
*NL*
they
had
retreated
they
would
have
withdrawn
from
that
too
...
Officer
!
''
*NL*
said
Bagration
to
Rostov
,
``
are
the
enemy
's
skirmishers
still
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
there
this
evening
,
but
now
I
do
n't
know
,
your
excellency
.
*NL*
Shall
I
go
with
some
of
my
hussars
to
see
?
''
replied
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
stopped
and
,
before
replying
,
tried
to
see
Rostov
's
face
in
*NL*
the
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
and
see
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
spurred
his
horse
,
called
to
Sergeant
Fedchenko
and
two
other
*NL*
hussars
,
told
them
to
follow
him
,
and
trotted
downhill
in
the
direction
*NL*
from
which
the
shouting
came
.
He
felt
both
frightened
and
pleased
to
be
*NL*
riding
alone
with
three
hussars
into
that
mysterious
and
dangerous
misty
*NL*
distance
where
no
one
had
been
before
him
.
Bagration
called
to
him
from
*NL*
the
hill
not
to
go
beyond
the
stream
,
but
Rostov
pretended
not
to
hear
*NL*
him
and
did
not
stop
but
rode
on
and
on
,
continually
mistaking
bushes
*NL*
for
trees
and
gullies
for
men
and
continually
discovering
his
mistakes
.
*NL*
Having
descended
the
hill
at
a
trot
,
he
no
longer
saw
either
our
own
or
*NL*
the
enemy
's
fires
,
but
heard
the
shouting
of
the
French
more
loudly
and
*NL*
distinctly
.
In
the
valley
he
saw
before
him
something
like
a
river
,
but
*NL*
when
he
reached
it
he
found
it
was
a
road
.
Having
come
out
onto
the
road
*NL*
he
reined
in
his
horse
,
hesitating
whether
to
ride
along
it
or
cross
it
*NL*
and
ride
over
the
black
field
up
the
hillside
.
To
keep
to
the
road
which
*NL*
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
would
have
been
safer
because
it
would
be
*NL*
easier
to
see
people
coming
along
it
.
``
Follow
me
!
''
said
he
,
crossed
the
*NL*
road
,
and
began
riding
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
toward
the
point
where
*NL*
the
French
pickets
had
been
standing
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
there
he
is
!
''
cried
one
of
the
hussars
behind
him
.
And
*NL*
before
Rostov
had
time
to
make
out
what
the
black
thing
was
that
had
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
in
the
fog
,
there
was
a
flash
,
followed
by
a
report
,
*NL*
and
a
bullet
whizzing
high
up
in
the
mist
with
a
plaintive
sound
passed
*NL*
out
of
hearing
.
Another
musket
missed
fire
but
flashed
in
the
pan
.
*NL*
Rostov
turned
his
horse
and
galloped
back
.
Four
more
reports
followed
at
*NL*
intervals
,
and
the
bullets
passed
somewhere
in
the
fog
singing
in
*NL*
different
tones
.
Rostov
reined
in
his
horse
,
whose
spirits
had
risen
,
*NL*
like
his
own
,
at
the
firing
,
and
went
back
at
a
footpace
.
``
Well
,
some
*NL*
more
!
Some
more
!
''
a
merry
voice
was
saying
in
his
soul
.
But
no
more
*NL*
shots
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
approaching
Bagration
did
Rostov
let
his
horse
gallop
again
,
*NL*
and
with
his
hand
at
the
salute
rode
up
to
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolgorukov
was
still
insisting
that
the
French
had
retreated
and
had
*NL*
only
lit
fires
to
deceive
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
prove
?
''
he
was
saying
as
Rostov
rode
up
.
``
They
might
*NL*
retreat
and
leave
the
pickets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
plain
that
they
have
not
all
gone
yet
,
Prince
,
''
said
Bagration
.
*NL*
``
Wait
till
tomorrow
morning
,
we
'll
find
out
everything
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
picket
is
still
on
the
hill
,
your
excellency
,
just
where
it
was
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
''
reported
Rostov
,
stooping
forward
with
his
hand
at
the
*NL*
salute
and
unable
to
repress
the
smile
of
delight
induced
by
his
ride
*NL*
and
especially
by
the
sound
of
the
bullets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
very
good
,
''
said
Bagration
.
``
Thank
you
,
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

said
Rostov
,
``
may
I
ask
a
favor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
our
squadron
is
to
be

May

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Rostov

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
you
may
stay
in
attendance
on
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Ilya
Rostov
's
son

asked
Dolgorukov
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rostov
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
may
reckon
on
it
,
your
excellency

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow

likely
I
may

to
the
Emperor

''
*NL*
thought
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fires
and
shouting
in
the
enemy
's
army
were
occasioned
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
while
Napoleon
's
proclamation
was
being
read
to
the
troops
the
*NL*
Emperor
himself
rode
round
his
bivouacs
.
The
soldiers
,
on
seeing
him
,
*NL*
lit
wisps
of
straw
and
ran
after
him
,
shouting
,
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
*NL*
Napoleon
's
proclamation
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
Soldiers
!
The
Russian
army
is
advancing
against
you
to
avenge
the
*NL*
Austrian
army
of
Ulm
.
They
are
the
same
battalions
you
broke
at
*NL*
Hollabrunn
and
have
pursued
ever
since
to
this
place
.
The
position
we
*NL*
occupy
is
a
strong
one
,
and
while
they
are
marching
to
go
round
me
on
*NL*
the
right
they
will
expose
a
flank
to
me
.
Soldiers
!
I
will
myself
direct
*NL*
your
battalions
.
I
will
keep
out
of
fire
if
you
with
your
habitual
valor
*NL*
carry
disorder
and
confusion
into
the
enemy
's
ranks
,
but
should
victory
*NL*
be
in
doubt
,
even
for
a
moment
,
you
will
see
your
Emperor
exposing
*NL*
himself
to
the
first
blows
of
the
enemy
,
for
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
*NL*
victory
,
especially
on
this
day
when
what
is
at
stake
is
the
honor
of
*NL*
the
French
infantry
,
so
necessary
to
the
honor
of
our
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
not
break
your
ranks
on
the
plea
of
removing
the
wounded
!
Let
every
*NL*
man
be
fully
imbued
with
the
thought
that
we
must
defeat
these
hirelings
*NL*
of
England
,
inspired
by
such
hatred
of
our
nation
!
This
victory
will
*NL*
conclude
our
campaign
and
we
can
return
to
winter
quarters
,
where
fresh
*NL*
French
troops
who
are
being
raised
in
France
will
join
us
,
and
the
peace
*NL*
I
shall
conclude
will
be
worthy
of
my
people
,
of
you
,
and
of
myself
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
in
the
morning
it
was
still
quite
dark
.
The
troops
of
the
*NL*
center
,
the
reserves
,
and
Bagration
's
right
flank
had
not
yet
moved
,
but
*NL*
on
the
left
flank
the
columns
of
infantry
,
cavalry
,
and
artillery
,
which
*NL*
were
to
be
the
first
to
descend
the
heights
to
attack
the
French
right
*NL*
flank
and
drive
it
into
the
Bohemian
mountains
according
to
plan
,
were
*NL*
already
up
and
astir
.
The
smoke
of
the
campfires
,
into
which
they
were
*NL*
throwing
everything
superfluous
,
made
the
eyes
smart
.
It
was
cold
and
*NL*
dark
.
The
officers
were
hurriedly
drinking
tea
and
breakfasting
,
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
munching
biscuit
and
beating
a
tattoo
with
their
feet
to
warm
*NL*
themselves
,
gathering
round
the
fires
throwing
into
the
flames
the
*NL*
remains
of
sheds
,
chairs
,
tables
,
wheels
,
tubs
,
and
everything
that
they
*NL*
did
not
want
or
could
not
carry
away
with
them
.
Austrian
column
guides
*NL*
were
moving
in
and
out
among
the
Russian
troops
and
served
as
heralds
of
*NL*
the
advance
.
As
soon
as
an
Austrian
officer
showed
himself
near
a
*NL*
commanding
officer
's
quarters
,
the
regiment
began
to
move
:
the
soldiers
*NL*
ran
from
the
fires
,
thrust
their
pipes
into
their
boots
,
their
bags
into
*NL*
the
carts
,
got
their
muskets
ready
,
and
formed
rank
.
The
officers
*NL*
buttoned
up
their
coats
,
buckled
on
their
swords
and
pouches
,
and
moved
*NL*
along
the
ranks
shouting
.
The
train
drivers
and
orderlies
harnessed
and
*NL*
packed
the
wagons
and
tied
on
the
loads
.
The
adjutants
and
battalion
and
*NL*
regimental
commanders
mounted
,
crossed
themselves
,
gave
final
*NL*
instructions
,
orders
,
and
commissions
to
the
baggage
men
who
remained
*NL*
behind
,
and
the
monotonous
tramp
of
thousands
of
feet
resounded
.
The
*NL*
column
moved
forward
without
knowing
where
and
unable
,
from
the
masses
*NL*
around
them
,
the
smoke
and
the
increasing
fog
,
to
see
either
the
place
*NL*
they
were
leaving
or
that
to
which
they
were
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soldier
on
the
march
is
hemmed
in
and
borne
along
by
his
regiment
as
*NL*
much
as
a
sailor
is
by
his
ship
.
However
far
he
has
walked
,
whatever
*NL*
strange
,
unknown
,
and
dangerous
places
he
reaches
,
just
as
a
sailor
is
*NL*
always
surrounded
by
the
same
decks
,
masts
,
and
rigging
of
his
ship
,
so
*NL*
the
soldier
always
has
around
him
the
same
comrades
,
the
same
ranks
,
the
*NL*
same
sergeant
major
Ivan
Mitrich
,
the
same
company
dog
Jack
,
and
the
*NL*
same
commanders
.
The
sailor
rarely
cares
to
know
the
latitude
in
which
*NL*
his
ship
is
sailing
,
but
on
the
day
of
battle
--
heaven
knows
how
and
*NL*
whence
--
a
stern
note
of
which
all
are
conscious
sounds
in
the
moral
*NL*
atmosphere
of
an
army
,
announcing
the
approach
of
something
decisive
and
*NL*
solemn
,
and
awakening
in
the
men
an
unusual
curiosity
.
On
the
day
of
*NL*
battle
the
soldiers
excitedly
try
to
get
beyond
the
interests
of
their
*NL*
regiment
,
they
listen
intently
,
look
about
,
and
eagerly
ask
concerning
*NL*
what
is
going
on
around
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fog
had
grown
so
dense
that
though
it
was
growing
light
they
could
*NL*
not
see
ten
paces
ahead
.
Bushes
looked
like
gigantic
trees
and
level
*NL*
ground
like
cliffs
and
slopes
.
Anywhere
,
on
any
side
,
one
might
*NL*
encounter
an
enemy
invisible
ten
paces
off
.
But
the
columns
advanced
for
*NL*
a
long
time
,
always
in
the
same
fog
,
descending
and
ascending
hills
,
*NL*
avoiding
gardens
and
enclosures
,
going
over
new
and
unknown
ground
,
and
*NL*
nowhere
encountering
the
enemy
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
soldiers
became
*NL*
aware
that
in
front
,
behind
,
and
on
all
sides
,
other
Russian
columns
*NL*
were
moving
in
the
same
direction
.
Every
soldier
felt
glad
to
know
that
*NL*
to
the
unknown
place
where
he
was
going
,
many
more
of
our
men
were
going
*NL*
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
the
Kurskies
have
also
gone
past
,
''
was
being
said
in
the
*NL*
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
what
a
lot
of
our
troops
have
gathered
,
lads
!
Last
night
*NL*
I
looked
at
the
campfires
and
there
was
no
end
of
them
.
A
regular
*NL*
Moscow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
none
of
the
column
commanders
rode
up
to
the
ranks
or
talked
to
*NL*
the
men
-LRB-
the
commanders
,
as
we
saw
at
the
council
of
war
,
were
out
of
*NL*
humor
and
dissatisfied
with
the
affair
,
and
so
did
not
exert
themselves
*NL*
to
cheer
the
men
but
merely
carried
out
the
orders
-RRB-
,
yet
the
troops
*NL*
marched
gaily
,
as
they
always
do
when
going
into
action
,
especially
to
*NL*
an
attack
.
But
when
they
had
marched
for
about
an
hour
in
the
dense
fog
,
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
the
men
had
to
halt
and
an
unpleasant
consciousness
*NL*
of
some
dislocation
and
blunder
spread
through
the
ranks
.
How
such
a
*NL*
consciousness
is
communicated
is
very
difficult
to
define
,
but
it
*NL*
certainly
is
communicated
very
surely
,
and
flows
rapidly
,
imperceptibly
,
*NL*
and
irrepressibly
,
as
water
does
in
a
creek
.
Had
the
Russian
army
been
*NL*
alone
without
any
allies
,
it
might
perhaps
have
been
a
long
time
before
*NL*
this
consciousness
of
mismanagement
became
a
general
conviction
,
but
as
*NL*
it
was
,
the
disorder
was
readily
and
naturally
attributed
to
the
stupid
*NL*
Germans
,
and
everyone
was
convinced
that
a
dangerous
muddle
had
been
*NL*
occasioned
by
the
sausage
eaters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
we
stopped
?
Is
the
way
blocked
?
Or
have
we
already
come
up
*NL*
against
the
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
one
ca
n't
hear
them
.
They
'd
be
firing
if
we
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
in
a
hurry
enough
to
start
us
,
and
now
here
we
stand
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
field
without
rhyme
or
reason
.
It
's
all
those
damned
*NL*
Germans
'
muddling
!
What
stupid
devils
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'd
send
them
on
in
front
,
but
no
fear
,
they
're
crowding
up
*NL*
behind
.
And
now
here
we
stand
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
shall
we
soon
be
clear
?
They
say
the
cavalry
are
blocking
the
*NL*
way
,
''
said
an
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
those
damned
Germans
!
They
do
n't
know
their
own
country
!
''
said
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
division
are
you
?
''
shouted
an
adjutant
,
riding
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Eighteenth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
are
you
here
?
You
should
have
gone
on
long
ago

now
you
wo
n't
*NL*
get
there
till
evening

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
stupid
orders
!
They
do
n't
themselves
know
what
they
are
doing
!
''
*NL*
said
the
officer
and
rode
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
general
rode
past
shouting
something
angrily
,
not
in
Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tafa-lafa
!
But
what
he
's
jabbering
no
one
can
make
out
,
''
said
a
*NL*
soldier
,
mimicking
the
general
who
had
ridden
away
.
``
I
'd
shoot
them
,
the
*NL*
scoundrels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
ordered
to
be
at
the
place
before
nine
,
but
we
have
n't
got
*NL*
halfway
.
Fine
orders
!
''
was
being
repeated
on
different
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
feeling
of
energy
with
which
the
troops
had
started
began
to
*NL*
turn
into
vexation
and
anger
at
the
stupid
arrangements
and
at
the
*NL*
Germans
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
the
confusion
was
that
while
the
Austrian
cavalry
was
*NL*
moving
toward
our
left
flank
,
the
higher
command
found
that
our
center
*NL*
was
too
far
separated
from
our
right
flank
and
the
cavalry
were
all
*NL*
ordered
to
turn
back
to
the
right
.
Several
thousand
cavalry
crossed
in
*NL*
front
of
the
infantry
,
who
had
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
front
an
altercation
occurred
between
an
Austrian
guide
and
a
*NL*
Russian
general
.
The
general
shouted
a
demand
that
the
cavalry
should
be
*NL*
halted
,
the
Austrian
argued
that
not
he
,
but
the
higher
command
,
was
to
*NL*
blame
.
The
troops
meanwhile
stood
growing
listless
and
dispirited
.
After
*NL*
an
hour
's
delay
they
at
last
moved
on
,
descending
the
hill
.
The
fog
that
*NL*
was
dispersing
on
the
hill
lay
still
more
densely
below
,
where
they
were
*NL*
descending
.
In
front
in
the
fog
a
shot
was
heard
and
then
another
,
at
*NL*
first
irregularly
at
varying
intervals
--
trata
...
tat
--
and
then
more
and
*NL*
more
regularly
and
rapidly
,
and
the
action
at
the
Goldbach
Stream
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
expecting
to
come
on
the
enemy
down
by
the
stream
,
and
having
*NL*
stumbled
on
him
in
the
fog
,
hearing
no
encouraging
word
from
their
*NL*
commanders
,
and
with
a
consciousness
of
being
too
late
spreading
through
*NL*
the
ranks
,
and
above
all
being
unable
to
see
anything
in
front
or
around
*NL*
them
in
the
thick
fog
,
the
Russians
exchanged
shots
with
the
enemy
*NL*
lazily
and
advanced
and
again
halted
,
receiving
no
timely
orders
from
*NL*
the
officers
or
adjutants
who
wandered
about
in
the
fog
in
those
unknown
*NL*
surroundings
unable
to
find
their
own
regiments
.
In
this
way
the
action
*NL*
began
for
the
first
,
second
,
and
third
columns
,
which
had
gone
down
into
*NL*
the
valley
.
The
fourth
column
,
with
which
Kutuzov
was
,
stood
on
the
*NL*
Pratzen
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
,
where
the
fight
was
beginning
,
there
was
still
thick
fog
;
on
the
*NL*
higher
ground
it
was
clearing
,
but
nothing
could
be
seen
of
what
was
*NL*
going
on
in
front
.
Whether
all
the
enemy
forces
were
,
as
we
supposed
,
*NL*
six
miles
away
,
or
whether
they
were
near
by
in
that
sea
of
mist
,
no
one
*NL*
knew
till
after
eight
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
fog
lay
unbroken
like
a
sea
down
*NL*
below
,
but
higher
up
at
the
village
of
Schlappanitz
where
Napoleon
stood
*NL*
with
his
marshals
around
him
,
it
was
quite
light
.
Above
him
was
a
clear
*NL*
blue
sky
,
and
the
sun
's
vast
orb
quivered
like
a
huge
hollow
,
crimson
*NL*
float
on
the
surface
of
that
milky
sea
of
mist
.
The
whole
French
army
,
*NL*
and
even
Napoleon
himself
with
his
staff
,
were
not
on
the
far
side
of
*NL*
the
streams
and
hollows
of
Sokolnitz
and
Schlappanitz
beyond
which
we
*NL*
intended
to
take
up
our
position
and
begin
the
action
,
but
were
on
this
*NL*
side
,
so
close
to
our
own
forces
that
Napoleon
with
the
naked
eye
could
*NL*
distinguish
a
mounted
man
from
one
on
foot
.
Napoleon
,
in
the
blue
cloak
*NL*
which
he
had
worn
on
his
Italian
campaign
,
sat
on
his
small
gray
Arab
*NL*
horse
a
little
in
front
of
his
marshals
.
He
gazed
silently
at
the
hills
*NL*
which
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
sea
of
mist
and
on
which
the
Russian
*NL*
troops
were
moving
in
the
distance
,
and
he
listened
to
the
sounds
of
*NL*
firing
in
the
valley
.
Not
a
single
muscle
of
his
face
--
which
in
those
*NL*
days
was
still
thin
--
moved
.
His
gleaming
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
one
*NL*
spot
.
His
predictions
were
being
justified
.
Part
of
the
Russian
force
*NL*
had
already
descended
into
the
valley
toward
the
ponds
and
lakes
and
*NL*
part
were
leaving
these
Pratzen
Heights
which
he
intended
to
attack
and
*NL*
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
position
.
He
saw
over
the
mist
that
in
a
*NL*
hollow
between
two
hills
near
the
village
of
Pratzen
,
the
Russian
*NL*
columns
,
their
bayonets
glittering
,
were
moving
continuously
in
one
*NL*
direction
toward
the
valley
and
disappearing
one
after
another
into
the
*NL*
mist
.
From
information
he
had
received
the
evening
before
,
from
the
*NL*
sound
of
wheels
and
footsteps
heard
by
the
outposts
during
the
night
,
by
*NL*
the
disorderly
movement
of
the
Russian
columns
,
and
from
all
*NL*
indications
,
he
saw
clearly
that
the
allies
believed
him
to
be
far
away
*NL*
in
front
of
them
,
and
that
the
columns
moving
near
Pratzen
constituted
*NL*
the
center
of
the
Russian
army
,
and
that
that
center
was
already
*NL*
sufficiently
weakened
to
be
successfully
attacked
.
But
still
he
did
not
*NL*
begin
the
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Today
was
a
great
day
for
him
--
the
anniversary
of
his
coronation
.
Before
*NL*
dawn
he
had
slept
for
a
few
hours
,
and
refreshed
,
vigorous
,
and
in
good
*NL*
spirits
,
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
out
into
the
field
in
that
happy
*NL*
mood
in
which
everything
seems
possible
and
everything
succeeds
.
He
sat
*NL*
motionless
,
looking
at
the
heights
visible
above
the
mist
,
and
his
cold
*NL*
face
wore
that
special
look
of
confident
,
self-complacent
happiness
that
*NL*
one
sees
on
the
face
of
a
boy
happily
in
love
.
The
marshals
stood
behind
*NL*
him
not
venturing
to
distract
his
attention
.
He
looked
now
at
the
*NL*
Pratzen
Heights
,
now
at
the
sun
floating
up
out
of
the
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sun
had
entirely
emerged
from
the
fog
,
and
fields
and
mist
were
*NL*
aglow
with
dazzling
light
--
as
if
he
had
only
awaited
this
to
begin
the
*NL*
action
--
he
drew
the
glove
from
his
shapely
white
hand
,
made
a
sign
with
*NL*
it
to
the
marshals
,
and
ordered
the
action
to
begin
.
The
marshals
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
adjutants
,
galloped
off
in
different
directions
,
and
a
*NL*
few
minutes
later
the
chief
forces
of
the
French
army
moved
rapidly
*NL*
toward
those
Pratzen
Heights
which
were
being
more
and
more
denuded
by
*NL*
Russian
troops
moving
down
the
valley
to
their
left
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
Kutuzov
rode
to
Pratzen
at
the
head
of
the
fourth
*NL*
column
,
Miloradovich
's
,
the
one
that
was
to
take
the
place
of
*NL*
Przebyszewski
's
and
Langeron
's
columns
which
had
already
gone
down
into
*NL*
the
valley
.
He
greeted
the
men
of
the
foremost
regiment
and
gave
them
*NL*
the
order
to
march
,
thereby
indicating
that
he
intended
to
lead
that
*NL*
column
himself
.
When
he
had
reached
the
village
of
Pratzen
he
halted
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
behind
,
among
the
immense
number
forming
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
's
suite
.
He
was
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
*NL*
and
irritation
,
though
controlledly
calm
as
a
man
is
at
the
approach
of
*NL*
a
long-awaited
moment
.
He
was
firmly
convinced
that
this
was
the
day
of
*NL*
his
Toulon
,
or
his
bridge
of
Arcola
.
How
it
would
come
about
he
did
not
*NL*
know
,
but
he
felt
sure
it
would
do
so
.
The
locality
and
the
position
of
*NL*
our
troops
were
known
to
him
as
far
as
they
could
be
known
to
anyone
in
*NL*
our
army
.
His
own
strategic
plan
,
which
obviously
could
not
now
be
*NL*
carried
out
,
was
forgotten
.
Now
,
entering
into
Weyrother
's
plan
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
considered
possible
contingencies
and
formed
new
projects
such
as
*NL*
might
call
for
his
rapidity
of
perception
and
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
left
down
below
in
the
mist
,
the
musketry
fire
of
unseen
forces
*NL*
could
be
heard
.
It
was
there
Prince
Andrew
thought
the
fight
would
*NL*
concentrate
.
``
There
we
shall
encounter
difficulties
,
and
there
,
''
thought
*NL*
he
,
``
I
shall
be
sent
with
a
brigade
or
division
,
and
there
,
standard
in
*NL*
hand
,
I
shall
go
forward
and
break
whatever
is
in
front
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
look
calmly
at
the
standards
of
the
passing
battalions
.
*NL*
Seeing
them
he
kept
thinking
,
``
That
may
be
the
very
standard
with
which
*NL*
I
shall
lead
the
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
all
that
was
left
of
the
night
mist
on
the
heights
was
a
*NL*
hoar
frost
now
turning
to
dew
,
but
in
the
valleys
it
still
lay
like
a
*NL*
milk-white
sea
.
Nothing
was
visible
in
the
valley
to
the
left
into
which
*NL*
our
troops
had
descended
and
from
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing
.
*NL*
Above
the
heights
was
the
dark
clear
sky
,
and
to
the
right
the
vast
orb
*NL*
of
the
sun
.
In
front
,
far
off
on
the
farther
shore
of
that
sea
of
mist
,
*NL*
some
wooded
hills
were
discernible
,
and
it
was
there
the
enemy
probably
*NL*
was
,
for
something
could
be
descried
.
On
the
right
the
Guards
were
*NL*
entering
the
misty
region
with
a
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
now
and
*NL*
then
a
gleam
of
bayonets
;
to
the
left
beyond
the
village
similar
masses
*NL*
of
cavalry
came
up
and
disappeared
in
the
sea
of
mist
.
In
front
and
*NL*
behind
moved
infantry
.
The
commander-in-chief
was
standing
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
village
letting
the
troops
pass
by
him
.
That
morning
Kutuzov
seemed
*NL*
worn
and
irritable
.
The
infantry
passing
before
him
came
to
a
halt
*NL*
without
any
command
being
given
,
apparently
obstructed
by
something
in
*NL*
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
order
them
to
form
into
battalion
columns
and
go
round
the
village
!
''
*NL*
he
said
angrily
to
a
general
who
had
ridden
up
.
``
Do
n't
you
understand
,
*NL*
your
excellency
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
you
must
not
defile
through
narrow
*NL*
village
streets
when
we
are
marching
against
the
enemy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intended
to
re-form
them
beyond
the
village
,
your
excellency
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
laughed
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
make
a
fine
thing
of
it
,
deploying
in
sight
of
the
enemy
!
Very
*NL*
fine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
enemy
is
still
far
away
,
your
excellency
.
According
to
the
*NL*
dispositions
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dispositions
!
''
exclaimed
Kutuzov
bitterly
.
``
Who
told
you
that
?
...
*NL*
Kindly
do
as
you
are
ordered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
Nesvitski
whispered
to
Prince
Andrew
,
``
the
old
man
is
*NL*
as
surly
as
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
Austrian
officer
in
a
white
uniform
with
green
plumes
in
his
hat
*NL*
galloped
up
to
Kutuzov
and
asked
in
the
Emperor
's
name
had
the
fourth
*NL*
column
advanced
into
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
turned
round
without
answering
and
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
who
was
beside
him
.
Seeing
him
,
Kutuzov
's
malevolent
and
*NL*
caustic
expression
softened
,
as
if
admitting
that
what
was
being
done
*NL*
was
not
his
adjutant
's
fault
,
and
still
not
answering
the
Austrian
*NL*
adjutant
,
he
addressed
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
dear
fellow
,
and
see
whether
the
third
division
has
passed
the
*NL*
village
.
Tell
it
to
stop
and
await
my
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
Prince
Andrew
started
than
he
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ask
whether
sharpshooters
have
been
posted
,
''
he
added
.
``
What
are
*NL*
they
doing
?
What
are
they
doing
?
''
he
murmured
to
himself
,
still
not
*NL*
replying
to
the
Austrian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
galloped
off
to
execute
the
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overtaking
the
battalions
that
continued
to
advance
,
he
stopped
the
*NL*
third
division
and
convinced
himself
that
there
really
were
no
*NL*
sharpshooters
in
front
of
our
columns
.
The
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
regiment
was
much
surprised
at
the
commander-in-chief
's
order
to
throw
*NL*
out
skirmishers
.
He
had
felt
perfectly
sure
that
there
were
other
troops
*NL*
in
front
of
him
and
that
the
enemy
must
be
at
least
six
miles
away
.
*NL*
There
was
really
nothing
to
be
seen
in
front
except
a
barren
descent
*NL*
hidden
by
dense
mist
.
Having
given
orders
in
the
commander-in-chief
's
*NL*
name
to
rectify
this
omission
,
Prince
Andrew
galloped
back
.
Kutuzov
*NL*
still
in
the
same
place
,
his
stout
body
resting
heavily
in
the
saddle
*NL*
with
the
lassitude
of
age
,
sat
yawning
wearily
with
closed
eyes
.
The
*NL*
troops
were
no
longer
moving
,
but
stood
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
!
''
he
said
to
Prince
Andrew
,
and
turned
to
a
*NL*
general
who
,
watch
in
hand
,
was
saying
it
was
time
they
started
as
all
*NL*
the
left-flank
columns
had
already
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plenty
of
time
,
your
excellency
,
''
muttered
Kutuzov
in
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
yawn
.
``
Plenty
of
time
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
at
a
distance
behind
Kutuzov
was
heard
the
sound
of
regiments
*NL*
saluting
,
and
this
sound
rapidly
came
nearer
along
the
whole
extended
*NL*
line
of
the
advancing
Russian
columns
.
Evidently
the
person
they
were
*NL*
greeting
was
riding
quickly
.
When
the
soldiers
of
the
regiment
in
front
*NL*
of
which
Kutuzov
was
standing
began
to
shout
,
he
rode
a
little
to
one
*NL*
side
and
looked
round
with
a
frown
.
Along
the
road
from
Pratzen
galloped
*NL*
what
looked
like
a
squadron
of
horsemen
in
various
uniforms
.
Two
of
them
*NL*
rode
side
by
side
in
front
,
at
full
gallop
.
One
in
a
black
uniform
with
*NL*
white
plumes
in
his
hat
rode
a
bobtailed
chestnut
horse
,
the
other
who
*NL*
was
in
a
white
uniform
rode
a
black
one
.
These
were
the
two
Emperors
*NL*
followed
by
their
suites
.
Kutuzov
,
affecting
the
manners
of
an
old
*NL*
soldier
at
the
front
,
gave
the
command
``
Attention
!
''
and
rode
up
to
the
*NL*
Emperors
with
a
salute
.
His
whole
appearance
and
manner
were
suddenly
*NL*
transformed
.
He
put
on
the
air
of
a
subordinate
who
obeys
without
*NL*
reasoning
.
With
an
affectation
of
respect
which
evidently
struck
*NL*
Alexander
unpleasantly
,
he
rode
up
and
saluted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unpleasant
impression
merely
flitted
over
the
young
and
happy
face
*NL*
of
the
Emperor
like
a
cloud
of
haze
across
a
clear
sky
and
vanished
.
*NL*
After
his
illness
he
looked
rather
thinner
that
day
than
on
the
field
of
*NL*
Olmutz
where
Bolkonski
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
abroad
,
but
there
*NL*
was
still
the
same
bewitching
combination
of
majesty
and
mildness
in
his
*NL*
fine
gray
eyes
,
and
on
his
delicate
lips
the
same
capacity
for
varying
*NL*
expression
and
the
same
prevalent
appearance
of
goodhearted
innocent
*NL*
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Olmutz
review
he
had
seemed
more
majestic
;
here
he
seemed
*NL*
brighter
and
more
energetic
.
He
was
slightly
flushed
after
galloping
two
*NL*
miles
,
and
reining
in
his
horse
he
sighed
restfully
and
looked
round
at
*NL*
the
faces
of
his
suite
,
young
and
animated
as
his
own
.
Czartoryski
,
*NL*
Novosiltsev
,
Prince
Volkonsky
,
Strogonov
,
and
the
others
,
all
richly
*NL*
dressed
gay
young
men
on
splendid
,
well-groomed
,
fresh
,
only
slightly
*NL*
heated
horses
,
exchanging
remarks
and
smiling
,
had
stopped
behind
the
*NL*
Emperor
.
The
Emperor
Francis
,
a
rosy
,
long
faced
young
man
,
sat
very
*NL*
erect
on
his
handsome
black
horse
,
looking
about
him
in
a
leisurely
and
*NL*
preoccupied
manner
.
He
beckoned
to
one
of
his
white
adjutants
and
asked
*NL*
some
question
--
``
Most
likely
he
is
asking
at
what
o'clock
they
started
,
''
*NL*
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
watching
his
old
acquaintance
with
a
smile
he
*NL*
could
not
repress
as
he
recalled
his
reception
at
Brunn
.
In
the
*NL*
Emperors
'
suite
were
the
picked
young
orderly
officers
of
the
Guard
and
*NL*
line
regiments
,
Russian
and
Austrian
.
Among
them
were
grooms
leading
the
*NL*
Tsar
's
beautiful
relay
horses
covered
with
embroidered
cloths
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
when
a
window
is
opened
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
from
the
fields
enters
a
*NL*
stuffy
room
,
so
a
whiff
of
youthfulness
,
energy
,
and
confidence
of
*NL*
success
reached
Kutuzov
's
cheerless
staff
with
the
galloping
advent
of
*NL*
all
these
brilliant
young
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
n't
you
beginning
,
Michael
Ilarionovich
?
''
said
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
hurriedly
to
Kutuzov
,
glancing
courteously
at
the
same
time
at
*NL*
the
Emperor
Francis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
waiting
,
Your
Majesty
,
''
answered
Kutuzov
,
bending
forward
*NL*
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
,
frowning
slightly
,
bent
his
ear
forward
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
quite
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiting
,
Your
Majesty
,
''
repeated
Kutuzov
.
-LRB-
Prince
Andrew
noted
that
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
upper
lip
twitched
unnaturally
as
he
said
the
word
``
waiting
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
``
Not
all
the
columns
have
formed
up
yet
,
Your
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tsar
heard
but
obviously
did
not
like
the
reply
;
he
shrugged
his
*NL*
rather
round
shoulders
and
glanced
at
Novosiltsev
who
was
near
him
,
as
*NL*
if
complaining
of
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Michael
Ilarionovich
,
we
are
not
on
the
Empress
'
Field
where
*NL*
a
parade
does
not
begin
till
all
the
troops
are
assembled
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Tsar
with
another
glance
at
the
Emperor
Francis
,
as
if
inviting
him
if
*NL*
not
to
join
in
at
least
to
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
.
But
the
Emperor
*NL*
Francis
continued
to
look
about
him
and
did
not
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
why
I
do
not
begin
,
sire
,
''
said
Kutuzov
in
a
resounding
*NL*
voice
,
apparently
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
not
being
heard
,
and
*NL*
again
something
in
his
face
twitched
--
``
That
is
just
why
I
do
not
begin
,
*NL*
sire
,
because
we
are
not
on
parade
and
not
on
the
Empress
'
Field
,
''
said
*NL*
clearly
and
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Emperor
's
suite
all
exchanged
rapid
looks
that
expressed
*NL*
dissatisfaction
and
reproach
.
``
Old
though
he
may
be
,
he
should
not
,
he
*NL*
certainly
should
not
,
speak
like
that
,
''
their
glances
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tsar
looked
intently
and
observantly
into
Kutuzov
's
eye
waiting
to
*NL*
hear
whether
he
would
say
anything
more
.
But
Kutuzov
,
with
respectfully
*NL*
bowed
head
,
seemed
also
to
be
waiting
.
The
silence
lasted
for
about
a
*NL*
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
if
you
command
it
,
Your
Majesty
,
''
said
Kutuzov
,
lifting
his
*NL*
head
and
again
assuming
his
former
tone
of
a
dull
,
unreasoning
,
but
*NL*
submissive
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
his
horse
and
having
called
Miloradovich
,
the
commander
of
*NL*
the
column
,
gave
him
the
order
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troops
again
began
to
move
,
and
two
battalions
of
the
Novgorod
and
*NL*
one
of
the
Apsheron
regiment
went
forward
past
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
Apsheron
battalion
marched
by
,
the
red-faced
Miloradovich
,
*NL*
without
his
greatcoat
,
with
his
Orders
on
his
breast
and
an
enormous
*NL*
tuft
of
plumes
in
his
cocked
hat
worn
on
one
side
with
its
corners
front
*NL*
and
back
,
galloped
strenuously
forward
,
and
with
a
dashing
salute
reined
*NL*
in
his
horse
before
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
be
with
you
,
general
!
''
said
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
foi
,
sire
,
nous
ferons
ce
qui
sera
dans
notre
possibilite
,
sire
,
''
*
*NL*
he
answered
gaily
,
raising
nevertheless
ironic
smiles
among
the
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
Tsar
's
suite
by
his
poor
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Indeed
,
Sire
,
we
shall
do
everything
it
is
possible
to
do
,
Sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miloradovich
wheeled
his
horse
sharply
and
stationed
himself
a
little
*NL*
behind
the
Emperor
.
The
Apsheron
men
,
excited
by
the
Tsar
's
presence
,
*NL*
passed
in
step
before
the
Emperors
and
their
suites
at
a
bold
,
brisk
*NL*
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lads
!
''
shouted
Miloradovich
in
a
loud
,
self-confident
,
and
cheery
*NL*
voice
,
obviously
so
elated
by
the
sound
of
firing
,
by
the
prospect
of
*NL*
battle
,
and
by
the
sight
of
the
gallant
Apsherons
,
his
comrades
in
*NL*
Suvorov
's
time
,
now
passing
so
gallantly
before
the
Emperors
,
that
he
*NL*
forgot
the
sovereigns
'
presence
.
``
Lads
,
it
's
not
the
first
village
*NL*
you
've
had
to
take
,
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
do
our
best
!
''
shouted
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
's
horse
started
at
the
sudden
cry
.
This
horse
that
had
*NL*
carried
the
sovereign
at
reviews
in
Russia
bore
him
also
here
on
the
*NL*
field
of
Austerlitz
,
enduring
the
heedless
blows
of
his
left
foot
and
*NL*
pricking
its
ears
at
the
sound
of
shots
just
as
it
had
done
on
the
*NL*
Empress
'
Field
,
not
understanding
the
significance
of
the
firing
,
nor
of
*NL*
the
nearness
of
the
Emperor
Francis
'
black
cob
,
nor
of
all
that
was
*NL*
being
said
,
thought
,
and
felt
that
day
by
its
rider
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
turned
with
a
smile
to
one
of
his
followers
and
made
a
*NL*
remark
to
him
,
pointing
to
the
gallant
Apsherons
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
accompanied
by
his
adjutants
rode
at
a
walking
pace
behind
the
*NL*
carabineers
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
less
than
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
the
column
he
*NL*
stopped
at
a
solitary
,
deserted
house
that
had
probably
once
been
an
*NL*
inn
,
where
two
roads
parted
.
Both
of
them
led
downhill
and
troops
were
*NL*
marching
along
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fog
had
begun
to
clear
and
enemy
troops
were
already
dimly
visible
*NL*
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
on
the
opposite
heights
.
Down
below
,
on
the
*NL*
left
,
the
firing
became
more
distinct
.
Kutuzov
had
stopped
and
was
*NL*
speaking
to
an
Austrian
general
.
Prince
Andrew
,
who
was
a
little
behind
*NL*
looking
at
them
,
turned
to
an
adjutant
to
ask
him
for
a
field
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
look
!
''
said
this
adjutant
,
looking
not
at
the
troops
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
but
down
the
hill
before
him
.
``
It
's
the
French
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
generals
and
the
adjutant
took
hold
of
the
field
glass
,
trying
*NL*
to
snatch
it
from
one
another
.
The
expression
on
all
their
faces
*NL*
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
horror
.
The
French
were
supposed
to
be
a
mile
*NL*
and
a
half
away
,
but
had
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
appeared
just
in
*NL*
front
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
enemy
?
...
No
!
...
Yes
,
see
it
is
!
...
for
certain
...
But
how
is
*NL*
that
?
''
said
different
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
naked
eye
Prince
Andrew
saw
below
them
to
the
right
,
not
more
*NL*
than
five
hundred
paces
from
where
Kutuzov
was
standing
,
a
dense
French
*NL*
column
coming
up
to
meet
the
Apsherons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
!
The
decisive
moment
has
arrived
.
My
turn
has
come
,
''
thought
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
and
striking
his
horse
he
rode
up
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Apsherons
must
be
stopped
,
your
excellency
,
''
cried
he
.
But
at
that
*NL*
very
instant
a
cloud
of
smoke
spread
all
round
,
firing
was
heard
quite
*NL*
close
at
hand
,
and
a
voice
of
naive
terror
barely
two
steps
from
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
shouted
,
``
Brothers
!
All
's
lost
!
''
And
at
this
as
if
at
a
command
,
*NL*
everyone
began
to
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Confused
and
ever-increasing
crowds
were
running
back
to
where
five
*NL*
minutes
before
the
troops
had
passed
the
Emperors
.
Not
only
would
it
*NL*
have
been
difficult
to
stop
that
crowd
,
it
was
even
impossible
not
to
be
*NL*
carried
back
with
it
oneself
.
Bolkonski
only
tried
not
to
lose
touch
*NL*
with
it
,
and
looked
around
bewildered
and
unable
to
grasp
what
was
*NL*
happening
in
front
of
him
.
Nesvitski
with
an
angry
face
,
red
and
unlike
*NL*
himself
,
was
shouting
to
Kutuzov
that
if
he
did
not
ride
away
at
once
he
*NL*
would
certainly
be
taken
prisoner
.
Kutuzov
remained
in
the
same
place
*NL*
and
without
answering
drew
out
a
handkerchief
.
Blood
was
flowing
from
*NL*
his
cheek
.
Prince
Andrew
forced
his
way
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wounded
?
''
he
asked
,
hardly
able
to
master
the
trembling
of
his
*NL*
lower
jaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wound
is
not
here
,
it
is
there
!
''
said
Kutuzov
,
pressing
the
*NL*
handkerchief
to
his
wounded
cheek
and
pointing
to
the
fleeing
soldiers
.
*NL*
``
Stop
them
!
''
he
shouted
,
and
at
the
same
moment
,
probably
realizing
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
stop
them
,
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
to
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
wave
of
the
flying
mob
caught
him
and
bore
him
back
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troops
were
running
in
such
a
dense
mass
that
once
surrounded
by
*NL*
them
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
again
.
One
was
shouting
,
``
Get
on
!
Why
*NL*
are
you
hindering
us
?
''
Another
in
the
same
place
turned
round
and
fired
*NL*
in
the
air
;
a
third
was
striking
the
horse
Kutuzov
himself
rode
.
Having
*NL*
by
a
great
effort
got
away
to
the
left
from
that
flood
of
men
,
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
with
his
suite
diminished
by
more
than
half
,
rode
toward
a
sound
of
*NL*
artillery
fire
near
by
.
Having
forced
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
of
*NL*
fugitives
,
Prince
Andrew
,
trying
to
keep
near
Kutuzov
,
saw
on
the
slope
*NL*
of
the
hill
amid
the
smoke
a
Russian
battery
that
was
still
firing
and
*NL*
Frenchmen
running
toward
it
.
Higher
up
stood
some
Russian
infantry
,
*NL*
neither
moving
forward
to
protect
the
battery
nor
backward
with
the
*NL*
fleeing
crowd
.
A
mounted
general
separated
himself
from
the
infantry
and
*NL*
approached
Kutuzov
.
Of
Kutuzov
's
suite
only
four
remained
.
They
were
all
*NL*
pale
and
exchanged
looks
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
those
wretches
!
''
gasped
Kutuzov
to
the
regimental
commander
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
flying
soldiers
;
but
at
that
instant
,
as
if
to
punish
*NL*
him
for
those
words
,
bullets
flew
hissing
across
the
regiment
and
across
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
suite
like
a
flock
of
little
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
had
attacked
the
battery
and
,
seeing
Kutuzov
,
were
firing
at
*NL*
him
.
After
this
volley
the
regimental
commander
clutched
at
his
leg
;
*NL*
several
soldiers
fell
,
and
a
second
lieutenant
who
was
holding
the
flag
*NL*
let
it
fall
from
his
hands
.
It
swayed
and
fell
,
but
caught
on
the
*NL*
muskets
of
the
nearest
soldiers
.
The
soldiers
started
firing
without
*NL*
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
groaned
Kutuzov
despairingly
and
looked
around
...
*NL*
``
Bolkonski
!
''
he
whispered
,
his
voice
trembling
from
a
consciousness
of
*NL*
the
feebleness
of
age
,
``
Bolkonski
!
''
he
whispered
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
disordered
battalion
and
at
the
enemy
,
``
what
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
he
had
finished
speaking
,
Prince
Andrew
,
feeling
tears
of
*NL*
shame
and
anger
choking
him
,
had
already
leapt
from
his
horse
and
run
to
*NL*
the
standard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forward
,
lads
!
''
he
shouted
in
a
voice
piercing
as
a
child
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
!
''
thought
he
,
seizing
the
staff
of
the
standard
and
hearing
*NL*
with
pleasure
the
whistle
of
bullets
evidently
aimed
at
him
.
Several
*NL*
soldiers
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
shouted
Prince
Andrew
,
and
,
scarcely
able
to
hold
up
the
heavy
*NL*
standard
,
he
ran
forward
with
full
confidence
that
the
whole
battalion
*NL*
would
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
really
he
only
ran
a
few
steps
alone
.
One
soldier
moved
and
then
*NL*
another
and
soon
the
whole
battalion
ran
forward
shouting
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
*NL*
overtook
him
.
A
sergeant
of
the
battalion
ran
up
and
took
the
flag
that
*NL*
was
swaying
from
its
weight
in
Prince
Andrew
's
hands
,
but
he
was
*NL*
immediately
killed
.
Prince
Andrew
again
seized
the
standard
and
,
*NL*
dragging
it
by
the
staff
,
ran
on
with
the
battalion
.
In
front
he
saw
our
*NL*
artillerymen
,
some
of
whom
were
fighting
,
while
others
,
having
abandoned
*NL*
their
guns
,
were
running
toward
him
.
He
also
saw
French
infantry
*NL*
soldiers
who
were
seizing
the
artillery
horses
and
turning
the
guns
*NL*
round
.
Prince
Andrew
and
the
battalion
were
already
within
twenty
paces
*NL*
of
the
cannon
.
He
heard
the
whistle
of
bullets
above
him
unceasingly
and
*NL*
to
right
and
left
of
him
soldiers
continually
groaned
and
dropped
.
But
*NL*
he
did
not
look
at
them
:
he
looked
only
at
what
was
going
on
in
front
of
*NL*
him
--
at
the
battery
.
He
now
saw
clearly
the
figure
of
a
red-haired
*NL*
gunner
with
his
shako
knocked
awry
,
pulling
one
end
of
a
mop
while
a
*NL*
French
soldier
tugged
at
the
other
.
He
could
distinctly
see
the
*NL*
distraught
yet
angry
expression
on
the
faces
of
these
two
men
,
who
*NL*
evidently
did
not
realize
what
they
were
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
about
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
gazed
at
them
.
``
Why
*NL*
does
n't
the
red-haired
gunner
run
away
as
he
is
unarmed
?
Why
does
n't
the
*NL*
Frenchman
stab
him
?
He
will
not
get
away
before
the
Frenchman
remembers
*NL*
his
bayonet
and
stabs
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
really
another
French
soldier
,
trailing
his
musket
,
ran
up
to
the
*NL*
struggling
men
,
and
the
fate
of
the
red-haired
gunner
,
who
had
*NL*
triumphantly
secured
the
mop
and
still
did
not
realize
what
awaited
him
,
*NL*
was
about
to
be
decided
.
But
Prince
Andrew
did
not
see
how
it
ended
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
as
though
one
of
the
soldiers
near
him
hit
him
on
the
head
*NL*
with
the
full
swing
of
a
bludgeon
.
It
hurt
a
little
,
but
the
worst
of
it
*NL*
was
that
the
pain
distracted
him
and
prevented
his
seeing
what
he
had
*NL*
been
looking
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
Am
I
falling
?
My
legs
are
giving
way
,
''
thought
he
,
and
*NL*
fell
on
his
back
.
He
opened
his
eyes
,
hoping
to
see
how
the
struggle
of
*NL*
the
Frenchmen
with
the
gunners
ended
,
whether
the
red-haired
gunner
had
*NL*
been
killed
or
not
and
whether
the
cannon
had
been
captured
or
saved
.
*NL*
But
he
saw
nothing
.
Above
him
there
was
now
nothing
but
the
sky
--
the
*NL*
lofty
sky
,
not
clear
yet
still
immeasurably
lofty
,
with
gray
clouds
*NL*
gliding
slowly
across
it
.
``
How
quiet
,
peaceful
,
and
solemn
;
not
at
all
*NL*
as
I
ran
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
--
``
not
as
we
ran
,
shouting
and
fighting
,
*NL*
not
at
all
as
the
gunner
and
the
Frenchman
with
frightened
and
angry
*NL*
faces
struggled
for
the
mop
:
how
differently
do
those
clouds
glide
*NL*
across
that
lofty
infinite
sky
!
How
was
it
I
did
not
see
that
lofty
sky
*NL*
before
?
And
how
happy
I
am
to
have
found
it
at
last
!
Yes
!
All
is
vanity
,
*NL*
all
falsehood
,
except
that
infinite
sky
.
There
is
nothing
,
nothing
,
but
*NL*
that
.
But
even
it
does
not
exist
,
there
is
nothing
but
quiet
and
peace
.
*NL*
Thank
God
!

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
right
flank
commanded
by
Bagration
,
at
nine
o'clock
the
battle
*NL*
had
not
yet
begun
.
Not
wishing
to
agree
to
Dolgorukov
's
demand
to
*NL*
commence
the
action
,
and
wishing
to
avert
responsibility
from
himself
,
*NL*
Prince
Bagration
proposed
to
Dolgorukov
to
send
to
inquire
of
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
.
Bagration
knew
that
as
the
distance
between
the
two
*NL*
flanks
was
more
than
six
miles
,
even
if
the
messenger
were
not
killed
*NL*
-LRB-
which
he
very
likely
would
be
-RRB-
,
and
found
the
commander-in-chief
-LRB-
which
*NL*
would
be
very
difficult
-RRB-
,
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
before
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
cast
his
large
,
expressionless
,
sleepy
eyes
round
his
suite
,
*NL*
and
the
boyish
face
Rostov
,
breathless
with
excitement
and
hope
,
was
the
*NL*
first
to
catch
his
eye
.
He
sent
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
I
should
meet
His
Majesty
before
I
meet
the
commander-in-chief
,
*NL*
your
excellency
?
''
said
Rostov
,
with
his
hand
to
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
give
the
message
to
His
Majesty
,
''
said
Dolgorukov
,
hurriedly
*NL*
interrupting
Bagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
relieved
from
picket
duty
Rostov
had
managed
to
get
a
few
*NL*
hours
'
sleep
before
morning
and
felt
cheerful
,
bold
,
and
resolute
,
with
*NL*
elasticity
of
movement
,
faith
in
his
good
fortune
,
and
generally
in
that
*NL*
state
of
mind
which
makes
everything
seem
possible
,
pleasant
,
and
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
wishes
were
being
fulfilled
that
morning
:
there
was
to
be
a
*NL*
general
engagement
in
which
he
was
taking
part
,
more
than
that
,
he
was
*NL*
orderly
to
the
bravest
general
,
and
still
more
,
he
was
going
with
a
*NL*
message
to
Kutuzov
,
perhaps
even
to
the
sovereign
himself
.
The
morning
*NL*
was
bright
,
he
had
a
good
horse
under
him
,
and
his
heart
was
full
of
joy
*NL*
and
happiness
.
On
receiving
the
order
he
gave
his
horse
the
rein
and
*NL*
galloped
along
the
line
.
At
first
he
rode
along
the
line
of
Bagration
's
*NL*
troops
,
which
had
not
yet
advanced
into
action
but
were
standing
*NL*
motionless
;
then
he
came
to
the
region
occupied
by
Uvarov
's
cavalry
and
*NL*
here
he
noticed
a
stir
and
signs
of
preparation
for
battle
;
having
*NL*
passed
Uvarov
's
cavalry
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
cannon
and
*NL*
musketry
ahead
of
him
.
The
firing
grew
louder
and
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fresh
morning
air
were
now
heard
,
not
two
or
three
musket
shots
*NL*
at
irregular
intervals
as
before
,
followed
by
one
or
two
cannon
shots
,
*NL*
but
a
roll
of
volleys
of
musketry
from
the
slopes
of
the
hill
before
*NL*
Pratzen
,
interrupted
by
such
frequent
reports
of
cannon
that
sometimes
*NL*
several
of
them
were
not
separated
from
one
another
but
merged
into
a
*NL*
general
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
puffs
of
musketry
smoke
that
seemed
to
chase
one
another
*NL*
down
the
hillsides
,
and
clouds
of
cannon
smoke
rolling
,
spreading
,
and
*NL*
mingling
with
one
another
.
He
could
also
,
by
the
gleam
of
bayonets
*NL*
visible
through
the
smoke
,
make
out
moving
masses
of
infantry
and
narrow
*NL*
lines
of
artillery
with
green
caissons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
stopped
his
horse
for
a
moment
on
a
hillock
to
see
what
was
going
*NL*
on
,
but
strain
his
attention
as
he
would
he
could
not
understand
or
make
*NL*
out
anything
of
what
was
happening
:
there
in
the
smoke
men
of
some
sort
*NL*
were
moving
about
,
in
front
and
behind
moved
lines
of
troops
;
but
why
,
*NL*
whither
,
and
who
they
were
,
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
.
These
sights
*NL*
and
sounds
had
no
depressing
or
intimidating
effect
on
him
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
they
stimulated
his
energy
and
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
Go
on
!
Give
it
them
!
''
he
mentally
exclaimed
at
these
sounds
,
and
*NL*
again
proceeded
to
gallop
along
the
line
,
penetrating
farther
and
*NL*
farther
into
the
region
where
the
army
was
already
in
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
it
will
be
there
I
do
n't
know
,
but
all
will
be
well
!
''
thought
*NL*
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
passing
some
Austrian
troops
he
noticed
that
the
next
part
of
the
*NL*
line
-LRB-
the
Guards
-RRB-
was
already
in
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
!
I
shall
see
it
close
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
riding
almost
along
the
front
line
.
A
handful
of
men
came
*NL*
galloping
toward
him
.
They
were
our
uhlans
who
with
disordered
ranks
*NL*
were
returning
from
the
attack
.
Rostov
got
out
of
their
way
,
*NL*
involuntarily
noticed
that
one
of
them
was
bleeding
,
and
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
no
business
of
mine
,
''
he
thought
.
He
had
not
ridden
many
*NL*
hundred
yards
after
that
before
he
saw
to
his
left
,
across
the
whole
*NL*
width
of
the
field
,
an
enormous
mass
of
cavalry
in
brilliant
white
*NL*
uniforms
,
mounted
on
black
horses
,
trotting
straight
toward
him
and
*NL*
across
his
path
.
Rostov
put
his
horse
to
full
gallop
to
get
out
of
the
*NL*
way
of
these
men
,
and
he
would
have
got
clear
had
they
continued
at
the
*NL*
same
speed
,
but
they
kept
increasing
their
pace
,
so
that
some
of
the
*NL*
horses
were
already
galloping
.
Rostov
heard
the
thud
of
their
hoofs
and
*NL*
the
jingle
of
their
weapons
and
saw
their
horses
,
their
figures
,
and
*NL*
even
their
faces
,
more
and
more
distinctly
.
They
were
our
Horse
Guards
,
*NL*
advancing
to
attack
the
French
cavalry
that
was
coming
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Horse
Guards
were
galloping
,
but
still
holding
in
their
horses
.
*NL*
Rostov
could
already
see
their
faces
and
heard
the
command
:
``
Charge
!
''
*NL*
shouted
by
an
officer
who
was
urging
his
thoroughbred
to
full
speed
.
*NL*
Rostov
,
fearing
to
be
crushed
or
swept
into
the
attack
on
the
French
,
*NL*
galloped
along
the
front
as
hard
as
his
horse
could
go
,
but
still
was
*NL*
not
in
time
to
avoid
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
of
the
Horse
Guards
,
a
huge
pockmarked
fellow
,
frowned
angrily
*NL*
on
seeing
Rostov
before
him
,
with
whom
he
would
inevitably
collide
.
This
*NL*
Guardsman
would
certainly
have
bowled
Rostov
and
his
Bedouin
over
*NL*
-LRB-
Rostov
felt
himself
quite
tiny
and
weak
compared
to
these
gigantic
men
*NL*
and
horses
-RRB-
had
it
not
occurred
to
Rostov
to
flourish
his
whip
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
Guardsman
's
horse
.
The
heavy
black
horse
,
sixteen
hands
*NL*
high
,
shied
,
throwing
back
its
ears
;
but
the
pockmarked
Guardsman
drove
*NL*
his
huge
spurs
in
violently
,
and
the
horse
,
flourishing
its
tail
and
*NL*
extending
its
neck
,
galloped
on
yet
faster
.
Hardly
had
the
Horse
Guards
*NL*
passed
Rostov
before
he
heard
them
shout
,
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
looking
back
saw
*NL*
that
their
foremost
ranks
were
mixed
up
with
some
foreign
cavalry
with
*NL*
red
epaulets
,
probably
French
.
He
could
see
nothing
more
,
for
*NL*
immediately
afterwards
cannon
began
firing
from
somewhere
and
smoke
*NL*
enveloped
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
as
the
Horse
Guards
,
having
passed
him
,
disappeared
in
*NL*
the
smoke
,
Rostov
hesitated
whether
to
gallop
after
them
or
to
go
where
*NL*
he
was
sent
.
This
was
the
brilliant
charge
of
the
Horse
Guards
that
*NL*
amazed
the
French
themselves
.
Rostov
was
horrified
to
hear
later
that
of
*NL*
all
that
mass
of
huge
and
handsome
men
,
of
all
those
brilliant
,
rich
*NL*
youths
,
officers
and
cadets
,
who
had
galloped
past
him
on
their
*NL*
thousand-ruble
horses
,
only
eighteen
were
left
after
the
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
envy
them
?
My
chance
is
not
lost
,
and
maybe
I
shall
see
*NL*
the
Emperor
immediately
!
''
thought
Rostov
and
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
level
with
the
Foot
Guards
he
noticed
that
about
them
and
*NL*
around
them
cannon
balls
were
flying
,
of
which
he
was
aware
not
so
much
*NL*
because
he
heard
their
sound
as
because
he
saw
uneasiness
on
the
*NL*
soldiers
'
faces
and
unnatural
warlike
solemnity
on
those
of
the
*NL*
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
behind
one
of
the
lines
of
a
regiment
of
Foot
Guards
he
heard
a
*NL*
voice
calling
him
by
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rostov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
he
answered
,
not
recognizing
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
we
've
been
in
the
front
line
!
Our
regiment
attacked
!
''
said
Boris
*NL*
with
the
happy
smile
seen
on
the
faces
of
young
men
who
have
been
under
*NL*
fire
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
how
did
it
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
drove
them
back
!
''
said
Boris
with
animation
,
growing
talkative
.
``
Can
*NL*
you
imagine
it
?
''
and
he
began
describing
how
the
Guards
,
having
taken
up
*NL*
their
position
and
seeing
troops
before
them
,
thought
they
were
*NL*
Austrians
,
and
all
at
once
discovered
from
the
cannon
balls
discharged
*NL*
by
those
troops
that
they
were
themselves
in
the
front
line
and
had
*NL*
unexpectedly
to
go
into
action
.
Rostov
without
hearing
Boris
to
the
end
*NL*
spurred
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
asked
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
message
to
His
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
!
''
said
Boris
,
thinking
Rostov
had
said
``
His
Highness
,
''
and
*NL*
pointing
to
the
Grand
Duke
who
with
his
high
shoulders
and
frowning
*NL*
brows
stood
a
hundred
paces
away
from
them
in
his
helmet
and
Horse
*NL*
Guards
'
jacket
,
shouting
something
to
a
pale
,
white
uniformed
Austrian
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
the
Grand
Duke
,
and
I
want
the
commander-in-chief
or
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
''
said
Rostov
,
and
was
about
to
spur
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
!
Count
!
''
shouted
Berg
who
ran
up
from
the
other
side
as
eager
as
*NL*
Boris
.
``
Count
!
I
am
wounded
in
my
right
hand
''
-LRB-
and
he
showed
his
*NL*
bleeding
hand
with
a
handkerchief
tied
round
it
-RRB-
``
and
I
remained
at
the
*NL*
front
.
I
held
my
sword
in
my
left
hand
,
Count
.
All
our
family
--
the
von
*NL*
Bergs
--
have
been
knights
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
something
more
,
but
Rostov
did
not
wait
to
hear
it
and
rode
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
passed
the
Guards
and
traversed
an
empty
space
,
Rostov
,
to
avoid
*NL*
again
getting
in
front
of
the
first
line
as
he
had
done
when
the
Horse
*NL*
Guards
charged
,
followed
the
line
of
reserves
,
going
far
round
the
place
*NL*
where
the
hottest
musket
fire
and
cannonade
were
heard
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
heard
musket
fire
quite
close
in
front
of
him
and
behind
our
troops
,
*NL*
where
he
could
never
have
expected
the
enemy
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
it
be
?
''
he
thought
.
``
The
enemy
in
the
rear
of
our
army
?
*NL*
Impossible
!
''
And
suddenly
he
was
seized
by
a
panic
of
fear
for
himself
*NL*
and
for
the
issue
of
the
whole
battle
.
``
But
be
that
what
it
may
,
''
he
*NL*
reflected
,
``
there
is
no
riding
round
it
now
.
I
must
look
for
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
here
,
and
if
all
is
lost
it
is
for
me
to
perish
with
*NL*
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
foreboding
of
evil
that
had
suddenly
come
over
Rostov
was
more
and
*NL*
more
confirmed
the
farther
he
rode
into
the
region
behind
the
village
of
*NL*
Pratzen
,
which
was
full
of
troops
of
all
kinds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
?
What
is
it
?
Whom
are
they
firing
at
?
Who
is
firing
?
''
*NL*
Rostov
kept
asking
as
he
came
up
to
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
*NL*
running
in
confused
crowds
across
his
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
knows
!
They
've
killed
everybody
!
It
's
all
up
now
!
''
he
was
*NL*
told
in
Russian
,
German
,
and
Czech
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
who
*NL*
understood
what
was
happening
as
little
as
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kill
the
Germans
!
''
shouted
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
devil
take
them
--
the
traitors
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zum
Henker
diese
Russen
!
''
*
muttered
a
German
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Hang
these
Russians
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
wounded
men
passed
along
the
road
,
and
words
of
abuse
,
screams
,
*NL*
and
groans
mingled
in
a
general
hubbub
,
then
the
firing
died
down
.
*NL*
Rostov
learned
later
that
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
had
been
firing
*NL*
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
What
does
it
all
mean
?
''
thought
he
.
``
And
here
,
where
at
any
*NL*
moment
the
Emperor
may
see
them
...
But
no
,
these
must
be
only
a
handful
*NL*
of
scoundrels
.
It
will
soon
be
over
,
it
ca
n't
be
that
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
Only
*NL*
to
get
past
them
quicker
,
quicker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
defeat
and
flight
could
not
enter
Rostov
's
head
.
Though
he
*NL*
saw
French
cannon
and
French
troops
on
the
Pratzen
Heights
just
where
he
*NL*
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
the
commander-in-chief
,
he
could
not
,
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
,
believe
that
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
been
ordered
to
look
for
Kutuzov
and
the
Emperor
near
the
*NL*
village
of
Pratzen
.
But
neither
they
nor
a
single
commanding
officer
*NL*
were
there
,
only
disorganized
crowds
of
troops
of
various
kinds
.
He
*NL*
urged
on
his
already
weary
horse
to
get
quickly
past
these
crowds
,
but
*NL*
the
farther
he
went
the
more
disorganized
they
were
.
The
highroad
on
*NL*
which
he
had
come
out
was
thronged
with
caleches
,
carriages
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
and
Russian
and
Austrian
soldiers
of
all
arms
,
some
wounded
and
*NL*
some
not
.
This
whole
mass
droned
and
jostled
in
confusion
under
the
*NL*
dismal
influence
of
cannon
balls
flying
from
the
French
batteries
*NL*
stationed
on
the
Pratzen
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
Emperor
?
Where
is
Kutuzov
?
''
Rostov
kept
asking
everyone
he
*NL*
could
stop
,
but
got
no
answer
from
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
seizing
a
soldier
by
his
collar
he
forced
him
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
brother
!
They
've
all
bolted
long
ago
!
''
said
the
soldier
,
laughing
*NL*
for
some
reason
and
shaking
himself
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
left
that
soldier
who
was
evidently
drunk
,
Rostov
stopped
the
*NL*
horse
of
a
batman
or
groom
of
some
important
personage
and
began
to
*NL*
question
him
.
The
man
announced
that
the
Tsar
had
been
driven
in
a
*NL*
carriage
at
full
speed
about
an
hour
before
along
that
very
road
and
*NL*
that
he
was
dangerously
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
!
''
said
Rostov
.
``
It
must
have
been
someone
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
myself
,
''
replied
the
man
with
a
self-confident
smile
of
*NL*
derision
.
``
I
ought
to
know
the
Emperor
by
now
,
after
the
times
I
've
seen
*NL*
him
in
Petersburg
.
I
saw
him
just
as
I
see
you
...
There
he
sat
in
the
*NL*
carriage
as
pale
as
anything
.
How
they
made
the
four
black
horses
fly
!
*NL*
Gracious
me
,
they
did
rattle
past
!
It
's
time
I
knew
the
Imperial
horses
*NL*
and
Ilya
Ivanych
.
I
do
n't
think
Ilya
drives
anyone
except
the
Tsar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
let
go
of
the
horse
and
was
about
to
ride
on
,
when
a
wounded
*NL*
officer
passing
by
addressed
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
you
want
?
''
he
asked
.
``
The
commander-in-chief
?
He
was
killed
*NL*
by
a
cannon
ball
--
struck
in
the
breast
before
our
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
killed
--
wounded
!
''
another
officer
corrected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Kutuzov
?
''
asked
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Kutuzov
,
but
what
's
his
name
--
well
,
never
mind
...
there
are
not
*NL*
many
left
alive
.
Go
that
way
,
to
that
village
,
all
the
commanders
are
*NL*
there
,
''
said
the
officer
,
pointing
to
the
village
of
Hosjeradek
,
and
he
*NL*
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
rode
on
at
a
footpace
not
knowing
why
or
to
whom
he
was
now
*NL*
going
.
The
Emperor
was
wounded
,
the
battle
lost
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
doubt
it
now
.
Rostov
rode
in
the
direction
pointed
out
to
him
,
in
which
*NL*
he
saw
turrets
and
a
church
.
What
need
to
hurry
?
What
was
he
now
to
say
*NL*
to
the
Tsar
or
to
Kutuzov
,
even
if
they
were
alive
and
unwounded
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
road
,
your
honor
,
that
way
you
will
be
killed
at
once
!
''
a
*NL*
soldier
shouted
to
him
.
``
They
'd
kill
you
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
are
you
talking
about
?
''
said
another
.
``
Where
is
he
to
go
?
That
*NL*
way
is
nearer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
considered
,
and
then
went
in
the
direction
where
they
said
he
*NL*
would
be
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
same
now
.
If
the
Emperor
is
wounded
,
am
I
to
try
to
save
*NL*
myself
?
''
he
thought
.
He
rode
on
to
the
region
where
the
greatest
number
*NL*
of
men
had
perished
in
fleeing
from
Pratzen
.
The
French
had
not
yet
*NL*
occupied
that
region
,
and
the
Russians
--
the
uninjured
and
slightly
*NL*
wounded
--
had
left
it
long
ago
.
All
about
the
field
,
like
heaps
of
manure
*NL*
on
well-kept
plowland
,
lay
from
ten
to
fifteen
dead
and
wounded
to
each
*NL*
couple
of
acres
.
The
wounded
crept
together
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
*NL*
could
hear
their
distressing
screams
and
groans
,
sometimes
feigned
--
or
*NL*
so
it
seemed
to
Rostov
.
He
put
his
horse
to
a
trot
to
avoid
seeing
all
*NL*
these
suffering
men
,
and
he
felt
afraid
--
afraid
not
for
his
life
,
but
*NL*
for
the
courage
he
needed
and
which
he
knew
would
not
stand
the
sight
of
*NL*
these
unfortunates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
who
had
ceased
firing
at
this
field
strewn
with
dead
and
*NL*
wounded
where
there
was
no
one
left
to
fire
at
,
on
seeing
an
adjutant
*NL*
riding
over
it
trained
a
gun
on
him
and
fired
several
shots
.
The
*NL*
sensation
of
those
terrible
whistling
sounds
and
of
the
corpses
around
*NL*
him
merged
in
Rostov
's
mind
into
a
single
feeling
of
terror
and
pity
for
*NL*
himself
.
He
remembered
his
mother
's
last
letter
.
``
What
would
she
feel
,
''
*NL*
thought
he
,
``
if
she
saw
me
here
now
on
this
field
with
the
cannon
aimed
*NL*
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
village
of
Hosjeradek
there
were
Russian
troops
retiring
from
the
*NL*
field
of
battle
,
who
though
still
in
some
confusion
were
less
*NL*
disordered
.
The
French
cannon
did
not
reach
there
and
the
musketry
fire
*NL*
sounded
far
away
.
Here
everyone
clearly
saw
and
said
that
the
battle
was
*NL*
lost
.
No
one
whom
Rostov
asked
could
tell
him
where
the
Emperor
or
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
.
Some
said
the
report
that
the
Emperor
was
wounded
was
*NL*
correct
,
others
that
it
was
not
,
and
explained
the
false
rumor
that
had
*NL*
spread
by
the
fact
that
the
Emperor
's
carriage
had
really
galloped
from
*NL*
the
field
of
battle
with
the
pale
and
terrified
Ober-Hofmarschal
Count
*NL*
Tolstoy
,
who
had
ridden
out
to
the
battlefield
with
others
in
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
suite
.
One
officer
told
Rostov
that
he
had
seen
someone
from
*NL*
headquarters
behind
the
village
to
the
left
,
and
thither
Rostov
rode
,
*NL*
not
hoping
to
find
anyone
but
merely
to
ease
his
conscience
.
When
he
had
*NL*
ridden
about
two
miles
and
had
passed
the
last
of
the
Russian
troops
,
he
*NL*
saw
,
near
a
kitchen
garden
with
a
ditch
round
it
,
two
men
on
horseback
*NL*
facing
the
ditch
.
One
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
seemed
familiar
to
*NL*
Rostov
;
the
other
on
a
beautiful
chestnut
horse
-LRB-
which
Rostov
fancied
he
*NL*
had
seen
before
-RRB-
rode
up
to
the
ditch
,
struck
his
horse
with
his
spurs
,
*NL*
and
giving
it
the
rein
leaped
lightly
over
.
Only
a
little
earth
crumbled
*NL*
from
the
bank
under
the
horse
's
hind
hoofs
.
Turning
the
horse
sharply
,
*NL*
he
again
jumped
the
ditch
,
and
deferentially
addressed
the
horseman
with
*NL*
the
white
plumes
,
evidently
suggesting
that
he
should
do
the
same
.
The
*NL*
rider
,
whose
figure
seemed
familiar
to
Rostov
and
involuntarily
riveted
*NL*
his
attention
,
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
with
his
head
and
hand
and
by
*NL*
that
gesture
Rostov
instantly
recognized
his
lamented
and
adored
*NL*
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
ca
n't
be
he
,
alone
in
the
midst
of
this
empty
field
!
''
thought
*NL*
Rostov
.
At
that
moment
Alexander
turned
his
head
and
Rostov
saw
the
*NL*
beloved
features
that
were
so
deeply
engraved
on
his
memory
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
was
pale
,
his
cheeks
sunken
and
his
eyes
hollow
,
but
the
charm
,
the
*NL*
mildness
of
his
features
,
was
all
the
greater
.
Rostov
was
happy
in
the
*NL*
assurance
that
the
rumors
about
the
Emperor
being
wounded
were
false
.
He
*NL*
was
happy
to
be
seeing
him
.
He
knew
that
he
might
and
even
ought
to
go
*NL*
straight
to
him
and
give
the
message
Dolgorukov
had
ordered
him
to
*NL*
deliver
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
a
youth
in
love
trembles
,
is
unnerved
,
and
dares
not
utter
the
*NL*
thoughts
he
has
dreamed
of
for
nights
,
but
looks
around
for
help
or
a
*NL*
chance
of
delay
and
flight
when
the
longed-for
moment
comes
and
he
is
*NL*
alone
with
her
,
so
Rostov
,
now
that
he
had
attained
what
he
had
longed
*NL*
for
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
did
not
know
how
to
approach
*NL*
the
Emperor
,
and
a
thousand
reasons
occurred
to
him
why
it
would
be
*NL*
inconvenient
,
unseemly
,
and
impossible
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
It
is
as
if
I
were
glad
of
a
chance
to
take
advantage
of
his
*NL*
being
alone
and
despondent
!
A
strange
face
may
seem
unpleasant
or
*NL*
painful
to
him
at
this
moment
of
sorrow
;
besides
,
what
can
I
say
to
him
*NL*
now
,
when
my
heart
fails
me
and
my
mouth
feels
dry
at
the
mere
sight
of
*NL*
him
?
''
Not
one
of
the
innumerable
speeches
addressed
to
the
Emperor
that
*NL*
he
had
composed
in
his
imagination
could
he
now
recall
.
Those
speeches
*NL*
were
intended
for
quite
other
conditions
,
they
were
for
the
most
part
to
*NL*
be
spoken
at
a
moment
of
victory
and
triumph
,
generally
when
he
was
*NL*
dying
of
wounds
and
the
sovereign
had
thanked
him
for
heroic
deeds
,
and
*NL*
while
dying
he
expressed
the
love
his
actions
had
proved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
how
can
I
ask
the
Emperor
for
his
instructions
for
the
right
*NL*
flank
now
that
it
is
nearly
four
o'clock
and
the
battle
is
lost
?
No
,
*NL*
certainly
I
must
not
approach
him
,
I
must
not
intrude
on
his
*NL*
reflections
.
Better
die
a
thousand
times
than
risk
receiving
an
unkind
*NL*
look
or
bad
opinion
from
him
,
''
Rostov
decided
;
and
sorrowfully
and
with
*NL*
a
heart
full
despair
he
rode
away
,
continually
looking
back
at
the
Tsar
,
*NL*
who
still
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Rostov
was
thus
arguing
with
himself
and
riding
sadly
away
,
*NL*
Captain
von
Toll
chanced
to
ride
to
the
same
spot
,
and
seeing
the
*NL*
Emperor
at
once
rode
up
to
him
,
offered
his
services
,
and
assisted
him
*NL*
to
cross
the
ditch
on
foot
.
The
Emperor
,
wishing
to
rest
and
feeling
*NL*
unwell
,
sat
down
under
an
apple
tree
and
von
Toll
remained
beside
him
.
*NL*
Rostov
from
a
distance
saw
with
envy
and
remorse
how
von
Toll
spoke
long
*NL*
and
warmly
to
the
Emperor
and
how
the
Emperor
,
evidently
weeping
,
*NL*
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
pressed
von
Toll
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
might
have
been
in
his
place
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
and
hardly
*NL*
restraining
his
tears
of
pity
for
the
Emperor
,
he
rode
on
in
utter
*NL*
despair
,
not
knowing
where
to
or
why
he
was
now
riding
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
despair
was
all
the
greater
from
feeling
that
his
own
weakness
was
*NL*
the
cause
of
his
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
...
not
only
might
but
should
,
have
gone
up
to
the
sovereign
.
It
*NL*
was
a
unique
chance
to
show
his
devotion
to
the
Emperor
and
he
had
not
*NL*
made
use
of
it
...
``
What
have
I
done
?
''
thought
he
.
And
he
turned
round
*NL*
and
galloped
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
Emperor
,
but
there
*NL*
was
no
one
beyond
the
ditch
now
.
Only
some
carts
and
carriages
were
*NL*
passing
by
.
From
one
of
the
drivers
he
learned
that
Kutuzov
's
staff
were
*NL*
not
far
off
,
in
the
village
the
vehicles
were
going
to
.
Rostov
followed
*NL*
them
.
In
front
of
him
walked
Kutuzov
's
groom
leading
horses
in
*NL*
horsecloths
.
Then
came
a
cart
,
and
behind
that
walked
an
old
,
bandy
-
*NL*
legged
domestic
serf
in
a
peaked
cap
and
sheepskin
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tit
!
I
say
,
Tit
!
''
said
the
groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
answered
the
old
man
absent-mindedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Tit
!
Thresh
a
bit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
fool
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
spitting
angrily
.
Some
time
passed
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
then
the
same
joke
was
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
five
in
the
evening
the
battle
had
been
lost
at
all
points
.
More
*NL*
than
a
hundred
cannon
were
already
in
the
hands
of
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Przebyszewski
and
his
corps
had
laid
down
their
arms
.
Other
columns
*NL*
after
losing
half
their
men
were
retreating
in
disorderly
confused
*NL*
masses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remains
of
Langeron
's
and
Dokhturov
's
mingled
forces
were
crowding
*NL*
around
the
dams
and
banks
of
the
ponds
near
the
village
of
Augesd
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
five
o'clock
it
was
only
at
the
Augesd
Dam
that
a
hot
cannonade
*NL*
-LRB-
delivered
by
the
French
alone
-RRB-
was
still
to
be
heard
from
numerous
*NL*
batteries
ranged
on
the
slopes
of
the
Pratzen
Heights
,
directed
at
our
*NL*
retreating
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
rearguard
,
Dokhturov
and
others
rallying
some
battalions
kept
up
*NL*
a
musketry
fire
at
the
French
cavalry
that
was
pursuing
our
troops
.
It
*NL*
was
growing
dusk
.
On
the
narrow
Augesd
Dam
where
for
so
many
years
the
*NL*
old
miller
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
in
his
tasseled
cap
peacefully
*NL*
angling
,
while
his
grandson
,
with
shirt
sleeves
rolled
up
,
handled
the
*NL*
floundering
silvery
fish
in
the
watering
can
,
on
that
dam
over
which
for
*NL*
so
many
years
Moravians
in
shaggy
caps
and
blue
jackets
had
peacefully
*NL*
driven
their
two-horse
carts
loaded
with
wheat
and
had
returned
dusty
*NL*
with
flour
whitening
their
carts
--
on
that
narrow
dam
amid
the
wagons
and
*NL*
the
cannon
,
under
the
horses
'
hoofs
and
between
the
wagon
wheels
,
men
*NL*
disfigured
by
fear
of
death
now
crowded
together
,
crushing
one
another
,
*NL*
dying
,
stepping
over
the
dying
and
killing
one
another
,
only
to
move
on
*NL*
a
few
steps
and
be
killed
themselves
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
ten
seconds
a
cannon
ball
flew
compressing
the
air
around
,
or
a
*NL*
shell
burst
in
the
midst
of
that
dense
throng
,
killing
some
and
*NL*
splashing
with
blood
those
near
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
--
now
an
officer
--
wounded
in
the
arm
,
and
on
foot
,
with
the
*NL*
regimental
commander
on
horseback
and
some
ten
men
of
his
company
,
*NL*
represented
all
that
was
left
of
that
whole
regiment
.
Impelled
by
the
*NL*
crowd
,
they
had
got
wedged
in
at
the
approach
to
the
dam
and
,
jammed
in
*NL*
on
all
sides
,
had
stopped
because
a
horse
in
front
had
fallen
under
a
*NL*
cannon
and
the
crowd
were
dragging
it
out
.
A
cannon
ball
killed
someone
*NL*
behind
them
,
another
fell
in
front
and
splashed
Dolokhov
with
blood
.
The
*NL*
crowd
,
pushing
forward
desperately
,
squeezed
together
,
moved
a
few
*NL*
steps
,
and
again
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Move
on
a
hundred
yards
and
we
are
certainly
saved
,
remain
here
another
*NL*
two
minutes
and
it
is
certain
death
,
''
thought
each
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
who
was
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
forced
his
way
to
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
dam
,
throwing
two
soldiers
off
their
feet
,
and
ran
onto
the
slippery
*NL*
ice
that
covered
the
millpool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
this
way
!
''
he
shouted
,
jumping
over
the
ice
which
creaked
under
*NL*
him
;
``
turn
this
way
!
''
he
shouted
to
those
with
the
gun
.
``
It
bears
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice
bore
him
but
it
swayed
and
creaked
,
and
it
was
plain
that
it
*NL*
would
give
way
not
only
under
a
cannon
or
a
crowd
,
but
very
soon
even
*NL*
under
his
weight
alone
.
The
men
looked
at
him
and
pressed
to
the
bank
,
*NL*
hesitating
to
step
onto
the
ice
.
The
general
on
horseback
at
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
dam
raised
his
hand
and
opened
his
mouth
to
address
*NL*
Dolokhov
.
Suddenly
a
cannon
ball
hissed
so
low
above
the
crowd
that
*NL*
everyone
ducked
.
It
flopped
into
something
moist
,
and
the
general
fell
*NL*
from
his
horse
in
a
pool
of
blood
.
Nobody
gave
him
a
look
or
thought
of
*NL*
raising
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
onto
the
ice
,
over
the
ice
!
Go
on
!
Turn
!
Do
n't
you
hear
?
Go
on
!
''
*NL*
innumerable
voices
suddenly
shouted
after
the
ball
had
struck
the
*NL*
general
,
the
men
themselves
not
knowing
what
,
or
why
,
they
were
*NL*
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
hindmost
guns
that
was
going
onto
the
dam
turned
off
onto
the
*NL*
ice
.
Crowds
of
soldiers
from
the
dam
began
running
onto
the
frozen
pond
.
*NL*
The
ice
gave
way
under
one
of
the
foremost
soldiers
,
and
one
leg
slipped
*NL*
into
the
water
.
He
tried
to
right
himself
but
fell
in
up
to
his
waist
.
*NL*
The
nearest
soldiers
shrank
back
,
the
gun
driver
stopped
his
horse
,
but
*NL*
from
behind
still
came
the
shouts
:
``
Onto
the
ice
,
why
do
you
stop
?
Go
*NL*
on
!
Go
on
!
''
And
cries
of
horror
were
heard
in
the
crowd
.
The
soldiers
*NL*
near
the
gun
waved
their
arms
and
beat
the
horses
to
make
them
turn
and
*NL*
move
on
.
The
horses
moved
off
the
bank
.
The
ice
,
that
had
held
under
*NL*
those
on
foot
,
collapsed
in
a
great
mass
,
and
some
forty
men
who
were
on
*NL*
it
dashed
,
some
forward
and
some
back
,
drowning
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
cannon
balls
continued
regularly
to
whistle
and
flop
onto
the
*NL*
ice
and
into
the
water
and
oftenest
of
all
among
the
crowd
that
covered
*NL*
the
dam
,
the
pond
,
and
the
bank
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Pratzen
Heights
,
where
he
had
fallen
with
the
flagstaff
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
lay
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
bleeding
profusely
and
unconsciously
*NL*
uttering
a
gentle
,
piteous
,
and
childlike
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
evening
he
ceased
moaning
and
became
quite
still
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
how
long
his
unconsciousness
lasted
.
Suddenly
he
again
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
alive
and
suffering
from
a
burning
,
lacerating
pain
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
,
that
lofty
sky
that
I
did
not
know
till
now
,
but
saw
*NL*
today
?
''
was
his
first
thought
.
``
And
I
did
not
know
this
suffering
*NL*
either
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Yes
,
I
did
not
know
anything
,
anything
at
all
till
*NL*
now
.
But
where
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
and
heard
the
sound
of
approaching
horses
,
and
voices
*NL*
speaking
French
.
He
opened
his
eyes
.
Above
him
again
was
the
same
lofty
*NL*
sky
with
clouds
that
had
risen
and
were
floating
still
higher
,
and
*NL*
between
them
gleamed
blue
infinity
.
He
did
not
turn
his
head
and
did
not
*NL*
see
those
who
,
judging
by
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
voices
,
had
ridden
up
*NL*
and
stopped
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Napoleon
accompanied
by
two
aides-de-camp
.
Bonaparte
riding
over
*NL*
the
battlefield
had
given
final
orders
to
strengthen
the
batteries
*NL*
firing
at
the
Augesd
Dam
and
was
looking
at
the
killed
and
wounded
left
*NL*
on
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
men
!
''
remarked
Napoleon
,
looking
at
a
dead
Russian
grenadier
,
who
,
*NL*
with
his
face
buried
in
the
ground
and
a
blackened
nape
,
lay
on
his
*NL*
stomach
with
an
already
stiffened
arm
flung
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ammunition
for
the
guns
in
position
is
exhausted
,
Your
Majesty
,
''
*NL*
said
an
adjutant
who
had
come
from
the
batteries
that
were
firing
at
*NL*
Augesd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
some
brought
from
the
reserve
,
''
said
Napoleon
,
and
having
gone
on
*NL*
a
few
steps
he
stopped
before
Prince
Andrew
,
who
lay
on
his
back
with
*NL*
the
flagstaff
that
had
been
dropped
beside
him
.
-LRB-
The
flag
had
already
*NL*
been
taken
by
the
French
as
a
trophy
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fine
death
!
''
said
Napoleon
as
he
gazed
at
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
understood
that
this
was
said
of
him
and
that
it
was
*NL*
Napoleon
who
said
it
.
He
heard
the
speaker
addressed
as
Sire
.
But
he
*NL*
heard
the
words
as
he
might
have
heard
the
buzzing
of
a
fly
.
Not
only
*NL*
did
they
not
interest
him
,
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
and
at
once
*NL*
forgot
them
.
His
head
was
burning
,
he
felt
himself
bleeding
to
death
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
above
him
the
remote
,
lofty
,
and
everlasting
sky
.
He
knew
it
*NL*
was
Napoleon
--
his
hero
--
but
at
that
moment
Napoleon
seemed
to
him
such
a
*NL*
small
,
insignificant
creature
compared
with
what
was
passing
now
between
*NL*
himself
and
that
lofty
infinite
sky
with
the
clouds
flying
over
it
.
At
*NL*
that
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
who
might
be
standing
over
him
,
or
*NL*
what
was
said
of
him
;
he
was
only
glad
that
people
were
standing
near
*NL*
him
and
only
wished
that
they
would
help
him
and
bring
him
back
to
life
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
so
beautiful
now
that
he
had
today
learned
to
*NL*
understand
it
so
differently
.
He
collected
all
his
strength
,
to
stir
and
*NL*
utter
a
sound
.
He
feebly
moved
his
leg
and
uttered
a
weak
,
sickly
groan
*NL*
which
aroused
his
own
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
He
is
alive
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
Lift
this
young
man
up
and
carry
him
*NL*
to
the
dressing
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
this
,
Napoleon
rode
on
to
meet
Marshal
Lannes
,
who
,
hat
in
*NL*
hand
,
rode
up
smiling
to
the
Emperor
to
congratulate
him
on
the
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
remembered
nothing
more
:
he
lost
consciousness
from
the
*NL*
terrible
pain
of
being
lifted
onto
the
stretcher
,
the
jolting
while
*NL*
being
moved
,
and
the
probing
of
his
wound
at
the
dressing
station
.
He
*NL*
did
not
regain
consciousness
till
late
in
the
day
,
when
with
other
*NL*
wounded
and
captured
Russian
officers
he
was
carried
to
the
hospital
.
*NL*
During
this
transfer
he
felt
a
little
stronger
and
was
able
to
look
*NL*
about
him
and
even
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
words
he
heard
on
coming
to
his
senses
were
those
of
a
French
*NL*
convoy
officer
,
who
said
rapidly
:
``
We
must
halt
here
:
the
Emperor
will
*NL*
pass
here
immediately
;
it
will
please
him
to
see
these
gentlemen
*NL*
prisoners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
so
many
prisoners
today
,
nearly
the
whole
Russian
army
,
that
*NL*
he
is
probably
tired
of
them
,
''
said
another
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
!
They
say
this
one
is
the
commander
of
all
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
's
Guards
,
''
said
the
first
one
,
indicating
a
Russian
officer
in
*NL*
the
white
uniform
of
the
Horse
Guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
recognized
Prince
Repnin
whom
he
had
met
in
Petersburg
*NL*
society
.
Beside
him
stood
a
lad
of
nineteen
,
also
a
wounded
officer
of
*NL*
the
Horse
Guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bonaparte
,
having
come
up
at
a
gallop
,
stopped
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
the
senior
?
''
he
asked
,
on
seeing
the
prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
named
the
colonel
,
Prince
Repnin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
commander
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
regiment
of
Horse
*NL*
Guards
?
''
asked
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
commanded
a
squadron
,
''
replied
Repnin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
regiment
fulfilled
its
duty
honorably
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
praise
of
a
great
commander
is
a
soldier
's
highest
reward
,
''
said
*NL*
Repnin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bestow
it
with
pleasure
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
And
who
is
that
young
man
*NL*
beside
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Repnin
named
Lieutenant
Sukhtelen
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
looking
at
him
Napoleon
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
very
young
to
come
to
meddle
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Youth
is
no
hindrance
to
courage
,
''
muttered
Sukhtelen
in
a
failing
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
splendid
reply
!
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
Young
man
,
you
will
go
far
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
who
had
also
been
brought
forward
before
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
eyes
to
complete
the
show
of
prisoners
,
could
not
fail
to
attract
his
*NL*
attention
.
Napoleon
apparently
remembered
seeing
him
on
the
battlefield
*NL*
and
,
addressing
him
,
again
used
the
epithet
``
young
man
''
that
was
*NL*
connected
in
his
memory
with
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
you
,
young
man
,
''
said
he
.
``
How
do
you
feel
,
mon
brave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
five
minutes
before
,
Prince
Andrew
had
been
able
to
say
a
few
*NL*
words
to
the
soldiers
who
were
carrying
him
,
now
with
his
eyes
fixed
*NL*
straight
on
Napoleon
,
he
was
silent
...
So
insignificant
at
that
moment
*NL*
seemed
to
him
all
the
interests
that
engrossed
Napoleon
,
so
mean
did
his
*NL*
hero
himself
with
his
paltry
vanity
and
joy
in
victory
appear
,
compared
*NL*
to
the
lofty
,
equitable
,
and
kindly
sky
which
he
had
seen
and
*NL*
understood
,
that
he
could
not
answer
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
seemed
so
futile
and
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
*NL*
stern
and
solemn
train
of
thought
that
weakness
from
loss
of
blood
,
*NL*
suffering
,
and
the
nearness
of
death
aroused
in
him
.
Looking
into
*NL*
Napoleon
's
eyes
Prince
Andrew
thought
of
the
insignificance
of
*NL*
greatness
,
the
unimportance
of
life
which
no
one
could
understand
,
and
*NL*
the
still
greater
unimportance
of
death
,
the
meaning
of
which
no
one
*NL*
alive
could
understand
or
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
without
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
away
and
said
to
one
of
*NL*
the
officers
as
he
went
:
``
Have
these
gentlemen
attended
to
and
taken
to
*NL*
my
bivouac
;
let
my
doctor
,
Larrey
,
examine
their
wounds
.
Au
revoir
,
*NL*
Prince
Repnin
!
''
and
he
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
shone
with
self-satisfaction
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
who
had
carried
Prince
Andrew
had
noticed
and
taken
the
*NL*
little
gold
icon
Princess
Mary
had
hung
round
her
brother
's
neck
,
but
*NL*
seeing
the
favor
the
Emperor
showed
the
prisoners
,
they
now
hastened
to
*NL*
return
the
holy
image
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
did
not
see
how
and
by
whom
it
was
replaced
,
but
the
*NL*
little
icon
with
its
thin
gold
chain
suddenly
appeared
upon
his
chest
*NL*
outside
his
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
good
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
glancing
at
the
icon
his
*NL*
sister
had
hung
round
his
neck
with
such
emotion
and
reverence
,
``
it
*NL*
would
be
good
if
everything
were
as
clear
and
simple
as
it
seems
to
*NL*
Mary
.
How
good
it
would
be
to
know
where
to
seek
for
help
in
this
life
,
*NL*
and
what
to
expect
after
it
beyond
the
grave
!
How
happy
and
calm
I
*NL*
should
be
if
I
could
now
say
:
`
Lord
,
have
mercy
on
me
!
'
...
But
to
whom
*NL*
should
I
say
that
?
Either
to
a
Power
indefinable
,
incomprehensible
,
*NL*
which
I
not
only
can
not
address
but
which
I
can
not
even
express
in
*NL*
words
--
the
Great
All
or
Nothing
-
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
or
to
that
God
*NL*
who
has
been
sewn
into
this
amulet
by
Mary
!
There
is
nothing
certain
,
*NL*
nothing
at
all
except
the
unimportance
of
everything
I
understand
,
and
*NL*
the
greatness
of
something
incomprehensible
but
all-important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stretchers
moved
on
.
At
every
jolt
he
again
felt
unendurable
pain
;
*NL*
his
feverishness
increased
and
he
grew
delirious
.
Visions
of
his
father
,
*NL*
wife
,
sister
,
and
future
son
,
and
the
tenderness
he
had
felt
the
night
*NL*
before
the
battle
,
the
figure
of
the
insignificant
little
Napoleon
,
and
*NL*
above
all
this
the
lofty
sky
,
formed
the
chief
subjects
of
his
delirious
*NL*
fancies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
home
life
and
peaceful
happiness
of
Bald
Hills
presented
*NL*
itself
to
him
.
He
was
already
enjoying
that
happiness
when
that
little
*NL*
Napoleon
had
suddenly
appeared
with
his
unsympathizing
look
of
*NL*
shortsighted
delight
at
the
misery
of
others
,
and
doubts
and
torments
*NL*
had
followed
,
and
only
the
heavens
promised
peace
.
Toward
morning
all
*NL*
these
dreams
melted
and
merged
into
the
chaos
and
darkness
of
*NL*
unconciousness
and
oblivion
which
in
the
opinion
of
Napoleon
's
doctor
,
*NL*
Larrey
,
was
much
more
likely
to
end
in
death
than
in
convalescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
nervous
,
bilious
subject
,
''
said
Larrey
,
``
and
will
not
recover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Prince
Andrew
,
with
others
fatally
wounded
,
was
left
to
the
care
of
*NL*
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
year
1806
Nicholas
Rostov
returned
home
on
leave
.
Denisov
*NL*
was
going
home
to
Voronezh
and
Rostov
persuaded
him
to
travel
with
him
*NL*
as
far
as
Moscow
and
to
stay
with
him
there
.
Meeting
a
comrade
at
the
*NL*
last
post
station
but
one
before
Moscow
,
Denisov
had
drunk
three
bottles
*NL*
of
wine
with
him
and
,
despite
the
jolting
ruts
across
the
snow-covered
*NL*
road
,
did
not
once
wake
up
on
the
way
to
Moscow
,
but
lay
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
sleigh
beside
Rostov
,
who
grew
more
and
more
impatient
the
nearer
*NL*
they
got
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
longer
?
How
much
longer
?
Oh
,
these
insufferable
streets
,
*NL*
shops
,
bakers
'
signboards
,
street
lamps
,
and
sleighs
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
*NL*
when
their
leave
permits
had
been
passed
at
the
town
gate
and
they
had
*NL*
entered
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Denisov
!
We
're
here
!
He
's
asleep
,
''
he
added
,
leaning
forward
with
his
*NL*
whole
body
as
if
in
that
position
he
hoped
to
hasten
the
speed
of
the
*NL*
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
gave
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
corner
at
the
crossroads
,
where
the
cabman
,
Zakhar
,
has
his
*NL*
stand
,
and
there
's
Zakhar
himself
and
still
the
same
horse
!
And
here
's
*NL*
the
little
shop
where
we
used
to
buy
gingerbread
!
Ca
n't
you
hurry
up
?
*NL*
Now
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
house
is
it
?
''
asked
the
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
one
,
right
at
the
end
,
the
big
one
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
That
's
our
*NL*
house
,
''
said
Rostov
.
``
Of
course
,
it
's
our
house
!
Denisov
,
Denisov
!
We
're
*NL*
almost
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
raised
his
head
,
coughed
,
and
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dmitri
,
''
said
Rostov
to
his
valet
on
the
box
,
``
those
lights
are
in
our
*NL*
house
,
are
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
and
there
's
a
light
in
your
father
's
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
've
not
gone
to
bed
yet
?
What
do
you
think
?
Mind
now
,
do
n't
*NL*
forget
to
put
out
my
new
coat
,
''
added
Rostov
,
fingering
his
new
*NL*
mustache
.
``
Now
then
,
get
on
,
''
he
shouted
to
the
driver
.
``
Do
wake
up
,
*NL*
Vaska
!
''
he
went
on
,
turning
to
Denisov
,
whose
head
was
again
nodding
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
get
on
!
You
shall
have
three
rubles
for
vodka
--
get
on
!
''
Rostov
*NL*
shouted
,
when
the
sleigh
was
only
three
houses
from
his
door
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
the
horses
were
not
moving
at
all
.
At
last
the
sleigh
bore
to
the
*NL*
right
,
drew
up
at
an
entrance
,
and
Rostov
saw
overhead
the
old
familiar
*NL*
cornice
with
a
bit
of
plaster
broken
off
,
the
porch
,
and
the
post
by
the
*NL*
side
of
the
pavement
.
He
sprang
out
before
the
sleigh
stopped
,
and
ran
*NL*
into
the
hall
.
The
house
stood
cold
and
silent
,
as
if
quite
regardless
*NL*
of
who
had
come
to
it
.
There
was
no
one
in
the
hall
.
``
Oh
God
!
Is
*NL*
everyone
all
right
?
''
he
thought
,
stopping
for
a
moment
with
a
sinking
*NL*
heart
,
and
then
immediately
starting
to
run
along
the
hall
and
up
the
*NL*
warped
steps
of
the
familiar
staircase
.
The
well-known
old
door
handle
,
*NL*
which
always
angered
the
countess
when
it
was
not
properly
cleaned
,
*NL*
turned
as
loosely
as
ever
.
A
solitary
tallow
candle
burned
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Michael
was
asleep
on
the
chest
.
Prokofy
,
the
footman
,
who
was
so
*NL*
strong
that
he
could
lift
the
back
of
the
carriage
from
behind
,
sat
*NL*
plaiting
slippers
out
of
cloth
selvedges
.
He
looked
up
at
the
opening
*NL*
door
and
his
expression
of
sleepy
indifference
suddenly
changed
to
one
*NL*
of
delighted
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
heavens
!
The
young
count
!
''
he
cried
,
recognizing
his
young
*NL*
master
.
``
Can
it
be
?
My
treasure
!
''
and
Prokofy
,
trembling
with
*NL*
excitement
,
rushed
toward
the
drawing-room
door
,
probably
in
order
to
*NL*
announce
him
,
but
,
changing
his
mind
,
came
back
and
stooped
to
kiss
the
*NL*
young
man
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
well
?
''
asked
Rostov
,
drawing
away
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
God
be
thanked
!
Yes
!
They
've
just
finished
supper
.
Let
me
have
a
*NL*
look
at
you
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
everything
quite
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
be
thanked
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
who
had
completely
forgotten
Denisov
,
not
wishing
anyone
to
*NL*
forestall
him
,
threw
off
his
fur
coat
and
ran
on
tiptoe
through
the
*NL*
large
dark
ballroom
.
All
was
the
same
:
there
were
the
same
old
card
*NL*
tables
and
the
same
chandelier
with
a
cover
over
it
;
but
someone
had
*NL*
already
seen
the
young
master
,
and
,
before
he
had
reached
the
drawing
*NL*
room
,
something
flew
out
from
a
side
door
like
a
tornado
and
began
*NL*
hugging
and
kissing
him
.
Another
and
yet
another
creature
of
the
same
*NL*
kind
sprang
from
a
second
door
and
a
third
;
more
hugging
,
more
kissing
,
*NL*
more
outcries
,
and
tears
of
joy
.
He
could
not
distinguish
which
was
*NL*
Papa
,
which
Natasha
,
and
which
Petya
.
Everyone
shouted
,
talked
,
and
*NL*
kissed
him
at
the
same
time
.
Only
his
mother
was
not
there
,
he
noticed
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
did
not
know
...
Nicholas
...
My
darling
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
...
our
own

Kolya
,

dear
fellow

How
he
has
changed

*NL*
Where
are
the
candles
?
...
Tea

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
,
kiss
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
...
and
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
,
Natasha
,
Petya
,
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
Vera
,
and
the
old
count
were
*NL*
all
hugging
him
,
and
the
serfs
,
men
and
maids
,
flocked
into
the
room
,
*NL*
exclaiming
and
oh-ing
and
ah-ing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
,
clinging
to
his
legs
,
kept
shouting
,
``
And
me
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
after
she
had
pulled
him
down
toward
her
and
covered
his
face
*NL*
with
kisses
,
holding
him
tight
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
,
sprang
away
and
*NL*
pranced
up
and
down
in
one
place
like
a
goat
and
shrieked
piercingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
were
loving
eyes
glistening
with
tears
of
joy
,
and
all
around
*NL*
were
lips
seeking
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
too
,
all
rosy
red
,
clung
to
his
arm
and
,
radiant
with
bliss
,
*NL*
looked
eagerly
toward
his
eyes
,
waiting
for
the
look
for
which
she
*NL*
longed
.
Sonya
now
was
sixteen
and
she
was
very
pretty
,
especially
at
*NL*
this
moment
of
happy
,
rapturous
excitement
.
She
gazed
at
him
,
not
taking
*NL*
her
eyes
off
him
,
and
smiling
and
holding
her
breath
.
He
gave
her
a
*NL*
grateful
look
,
but
was
still
expectant
and
looking
for
someone
.
The
old
*NL*
countess
had
not
yet
come
.
But
now
steps
were
heard
at
the
door
,
steps
*NL*
so
rapid
that
they
could
hardly
be
his
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
was
she
,
dressed
in
a
new
gown
which
he
did
not
know
,
made
since
*NL*
he
had
left
.
All
the
others
let
him
go
,
and
he
ran
to
her
.
When
they
*NL*
met
,
she
fell
on
his
breast
,
sobbing
.
She
could
not
lift
her
face
,
but
*NL*
only
pressed
it
to
the
cold
braiding
of
his
hussar
's
jacket
.
Denisov
,
*NL*
who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
by
anyone
,
stood
there
and
wiped
*NL*
his
eyes
at
the
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vasili
Denisov
,
your
son
's
friend
,
''
he
said
,
introducing
himself
to
the
*NL*
count
,
who
was
looking
inquiringly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
most
welcome
!
I
know
,
I
know
,
''
said
the
count
,
kissing
and
*NL*
embracing
Denisov
.
``
Nicholas

Natasha

Vera
,
look
!
Here
is
*NL*
Denisov
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
happy
,
rapturous
faces
turned
to
the
shaggy
figure
of
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darling
Denisov
!
''
screamed
Natasha
,
beside
herself
with
rapture
,
*NL*
springing
to
him
,
putting
her
arms
round
him
,
and
kissing
him
.
This
*NL*
escapade
made
everybody
feel
confused
.
Denisov
blushed
too
,
but
smiled
*NL*
and
,
taking
Natasha
's
hand
,
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
was
shown
to
the
room
prepared
for
him
,
and
the
Rostovs
all
*NL*
gathered
round
Nicholas
in
the
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
countess
,
not
letting
go
of
his
hand
and
kissing
it
every
*NL*
moment
,
sat
beside
him
:
the
rest
,
crowding
round
him
,
watched
every
*NL*
movement
,
word
,
or
look
of
his
,
never
taking
their
blissfully
adoring
*NL*
eyes
off
him
.
His
brother
and
sisters
struggled
for
the
places
nearest
*NL*
to
him
and
disputed
with
one
another
who
should
bring
him
his
tea
,
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
was
very
happy
in
the
love
they
showed
him
;
but
the
first
moment
*NL*
of
meeting
had
been
so
beatific
that
his
present
joy
seemed
*NL*
insufficient
,
and
he
kept
expecting
something
more
,
more
and
yet
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
after
the
fatigues
of
their
journey
,
the
travelers
slept
*NL*
till
ten
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
room
next
their
bedroom
there
was
a
confusion
of
sabers
,
*NL*
satchels
,
sabretaches
,
open
portmanteaus
,
and
dirty
boots
.
Two
freshly
*NL*
cleaned
pairs
with
spurs
had
just
been
placed
by
the
wall
.
The
servants
*NL*
were
bringing
in
jugs
and
basins
,
hot
water
for
shaving
,
and
their
well
-
*NL*
brushed
clothes
.
There
was
a
masculine
odor
and
a
smell
of
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Gwiska
--
my
pipe
!
''
came
Vasili
Denisov
's
husky
voice
.
``
Wostov
,
*NL*
get
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
rubbing
his
eyes
that
seemed
glued
together
,
raised
his
*NL*
disheveled
head
from
the
hot
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
it
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Late
!
It
's
nearly
ten
o'clock
,
''
answered
Natasha
's
voice
.
A
rustle
of
*NL*
starched
petticoats
and
the
whispering
and
laughter
of
girls
'
voices
*NL*
came
from
the
adjoining
room
.
The
door
was
opened
a
crack
and
there
was
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
something
blue
,
of
ribbons
,
black
hair
,
and
merry
faces
.
It
*NL*
was
Natasha
,
Sonya
,
and
Petya
,
who
had
come
to
see
whether
they
were
*NL*
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
!
Get
up
!
''
Natasha
's
voice
was
again
heard
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Petya
,
having
found
and
seized
the
sabers
in
the
outer
room
,
*NL*
with
the
delight
boys
feel
at
the
sight
of
a
military
elder
brother
,
and
*NL*
forgetting
that
it
was
unbecoming
for
the
girls
to
see
men
undressed
,
*NL*
opened
the
bedroom
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
saber
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
sprang
aside
.
Denisov
hid
his
hairy
legs
under
the
blanket
,
*NL*
looking
with
a
scared
face
at
his
comrade
for
help
.
The
door
,
having
let
*NL*
Petya
in
,
closed
again
.
A
sound
of
laughter
came
from
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
!
Come
out
in
your
dressing
gown
!
''
said
Natasha
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
saber
?
''
asked
Petya
.
``
Or
is
it
yours
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
*NL*
the
black-mustached
Denisov
with
servile
deference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
hurriedly
put
something
on
his
feet
,
drew
on
his
dressing
gown
,
*NL*
and
went
out
.
Natasha
had
put
on
one
spurred
boot
and
was
just
getting
*NL*
her
foot
into
the
other
.
Sonya
,
when
he
came
in
,
was
twirling
round
and
*NL*
was
about
to
expand
her
dresses
into
a
balloon
and
sit
down
.
They
were
*NL*
dressed
alike
,
in
new
pale-blue
frocks
,
and
were
both
fresh
,
rosy
,
and
*NL*
bright
.
Sonya
ran
away
,
but
Natasha
,
taking
her
brother
's
arm
,
led
him
*NL*
into
the
sitting
room
,
where
they
began
talking
.
They
hardly
gave
one
*NL*
another
time
to
ask
questions
and
give
replies
concerning
a
thousand
*NL*
little
matters
which
could
not
interest
anyone
but
themselves
.
Natasha
*NL*
laughed
at
every
word
he
said
or
that
she
said
herself
,
not
because
what
*NL*
they
were
saying
was
amusing
,
but
because
she
felt
happy
and
was
unable
*NL*
to
control
her
joy
which
expressed
itself
by
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
nice
,
how
splendid
!
''
she
said
to
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
felt
that
,
under
the
influence
of
the
warm
rays
of
love
,
that
*NL*
childlike
smile
which
had
not
once
appeared
on
his
face
since
he
left
*NL*
home
now
for
the
first
time
after
eighteen
months
again
brightened
his
*NL*
soul
and
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
listen
,
''
she
said
,
``
now
you
are
quite
a
man
,
are
n't
you
?
I
'm
*NL*
awfully
glad
you
're
my
brother
.
''
She
touched
his
mustache
.
``
I
want
to
*NL*
know
what
you
men
are
like
.
Are
you
the
same
as
we
?
No
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
Sonya
run
away
?
''
asked
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
That
's
a
whole
long
story
!
How
are
you
going
to
speak
to
her
--
*NL*
thou
or
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
may
happen
,
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
call
her
you
,
please
!
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
some
other
time
.
*NL*
No
,
I
'll
tell
you
now
.
You
know
Sonya
's
my
dearest
friend
.
Such
a
friend
*NL*
that
I
burned
my
arm
for
her
sake
.
Look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pulled
up
her
muslin
sleeve
and
showed
him
a
red
scar
on
her
long
,
*NL*
slender
,
delicate
arm
,
high
above
the
elbow
on
that
part
that
is
covered
*NL*
even
by
a
ball
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
burned
this
to
prove
my
love
for
her
.
I
just
heated
a
ruler
in
the
*NL*
fire
and
pressed
it
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
on
the
sofa
with
the
little
cushions
on
its
arms
,
in
what
used
*NL*
to
be
his
old
schoolroom
,
and
looking
into
Natasha
's
wildly
bright
eyes
,
*NL*
Rostov
re-entered
that
world
of
home
and
childhood
which
had
no
meaning
*NL*
for
anyone
else
,
but
gave
him
some
of
the
best
joys
of
his
life
;
and
the
*NL*
burning
of
an
arm
with
a
ruler
as
a
proof
of
love
did
not
seem
to
him
*NL*
senseless
,
he
understood
and
was
not
surprised
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
is
that
all
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
such
friends
,
such
friends
!
All
that
ruler
business
was
just
*NL*
nonsense
,
but
we
are
friends
forever
.
She
,
if
she
loves
anyone
,
does
it
*NL*
for
life
,
but
I
do
n't
understand
that
,
I
forget
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
loves
me
and
you
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
suddenly
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
remember
before
you
went
away
?
...
Well
,
she
says
you
are
to
*NL*
forget
all
that
...
She
says
:
'
I
shall
love
him
always
,
but
let
him
be
*NL*
free
.
'
Is
n't
that
lovely
and
noble
!
Yes
,
very
noble
?
Is
n't
it
?
''
asked
*NL*
Natasha
,
so
seriously
and
excitedly
that
it
was
evident
that
what
she
*NL*
was
now
saying
she
had
talked
of
before
,
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
became
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
go
back
on
my
word
,
''
he
said
.
``
Besides
,
Sonya
is
so
charming
*NL*
that
only
a
fool
would
renounce
such
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
``
she
and
I
have
already
talked
it
over
.
We
knew
*NL*
you
'd
say
so
.
But
it
wo
n't
do
,
because
you
see
,
if
you
say
that
--
if
you
*NL*
consider
yourself
bound
by
your
promise
--
it
will
seem
as
if
she
had
not
*NL*
meant
it
seriously
.
It
makes
it
as
if
you
were
marrying
her
because
you
*NL*
must
,
and
that
would
n't
do
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
saw
that
it
had
been
well
considered
by
them
.
Sonya
had
already
*NL*
struck
him
by
her
beauty
on
the
preceding
day
.
Today
,
when
he
had
caught
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
her
,
she
seemed
still
more
lovely
.
She
was
a
charming
girl
*NL*
of
sixteen
,
evidently
passionately
in
love
with
him
-LRB-
he
did
not
doubt
*NL*
that
for
an
instant
-RRB-
.
Why
should
he
not
love
her
now
,
and
even
marry
*NL*
her
,
Rostov
thought
,
but
just
now
there
were
so
many
other
pleasures
and
*NL*
interests
before
him
!
``
Yes
,
they
have
taken
a
wise
decision
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
``
I
must
remain
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
that
's
excellent
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
'll
talk
it
over
later
on
.
*NL*
Oh
,
how
glad
I
am
to
have
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
are
you
still
true
to
Boris
?
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
nonsense
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
laughing
.
``
I
do
n't
think
about
him
*NL*
or
anyone
else
,
and
I
do
n't
want
anything
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
Then
what
are
you
up
to
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
?
''
repeated
Natasha
,
and
a
happy
smile
lit
up
her
face
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
seen
Duport
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
seen
Duport
--
the
famous
dancer
?
Well
then
,
you
wo
n't
understand
.
*NL*
That
's
what
I
'm
up
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Curving
her
arms
,
Natasha
held
out
her
skirts
as
dancers
do
,
ran
back
a
*NL*
few
steps
,
turned
,
cut
a
caper
,
brought
her
little
feet
sharply
*NL*
together
,
and
made
some
steps
on
the
very
tips
of
her
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
I
'm
standing
!
See
!
''
she
said
,
but
could
not
maintain
herself
on
*NL*
her
toes
any
longer
.
``
So
that
's
what
I
'm
up
to
!
I
'll
never
marry
anyone
,
*NL*
but
will
be
a
dancer
.
Only
do
n't
tell
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
laughed
so
loud
and
merrily
that
Denisov
,
in
his
bedroom
,
felt
*NL*
envious
and
Natasha
could
not
help
joining
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
do
n't
you
think
it
's
nice
?
''
she
kept
repeating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
!
And
so
you
no
longer
wish
to
marry
Boris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
flared
up
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
anyone
.
And
I
'll
tell
him
so
*NL*
when
I
see
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
all
rubbish
,
''
Natasha
chattered
on
.
``
And
is
Denisov
nice
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
then
,
good-by
:
go
and
dress
.
Is
he
very
terrible
,
Denisov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
terrible
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
``
No
,
Vaska
is
a
splendid
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
call
him
Vaska
?
That
's
funny
!
And
is
he
very
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
be
quick
.
We
'll
all
have
breakfast
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Natasha
rose
and
went
out
of
the
room
on
tiptoe
,
like
a
ballet
*NL*
dancer
,
but
smiling
as
only
happy
girls
of
fifteen
can
smile
.
When
*NL*
Rostov
met
Sonya
in
the
drawing
room
,
he
reddened
.
He
did
not
know
how
*NL*
to
behave
with
her
.
The
evening
before
,
in
the
first
happy
moment
of
*NL*
meeting
,
they
had
kissed
each
other
,
but
today
they
felt
it
could
not
be
*NL*
done
;
he
felt
that
everybody
,
including
his
mother
and
sisters
,
was
*NL*
looking
inquiringly
at
him
and
watching
to
see
how
he
would
behave
with
*NL*
her
.
He
kissed
her
hand
and
addressed
her
not
as
thou
but
as
you
--
Sonya
.
*NL*
But
their
eyes
met
and
said
thou
,
and
exchanged
tender
kisses
.
Her
looks
*NL*
asked
him
to
forgive
her
for
having
dared
,
by
Natasha
's
intermediacy
,
to
*NL*
remind
him
of
his
promise
,
and
then
thanked
him
for
his
love
.
His
looks
*NL*
thanked
her
for
offering
him
his
freedom
and
told
her
that
one
way
or
*NL*
another
he
would
never
cease
to
love
her
,
for
that
would
be
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
it
is
,
''
said
Vera
,
selecting
a
moment
when
all
were
silent
,
*NL*
``
that
Sonya
and
Nicholas
now
say
you
to
one
another
and
meet
like
*NL*
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vera
's
remark
was
correct
,
as
her
remarks
always
were
,
but
,
like
most
of
*NL*
her
observations
,
it
made
everyone
feel
uncomfortable
,
not
only
Sonya
,
*NL*
Nicholas
,
and
Natasha
,
but
even
the
old
countess
,
who
--
dreading
this
*NL*
love
affair
which
might
hinder
Nicholas
from
making
a
brilliant
match
--
*NL*
blushed
like
a
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
to
Rostov
's
surprise
,
appeared
in
the
drawing
room
with
pomaded
*NL*
hair
,
perfumed
,
and
in
a
new
uniform
,
looking
just
as
smart
as
he
made
*NL*
himself
when
going
into
battle
,
and
he
was
more
amiable
to
the
ladies
*NL*
and
gentlemen
than
Rostov
had
ever
expected
to
see
him
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
to
Moscow
from
the
army
,
Nicholas
Rostov
was
welcomed
by
*NL*
his
home
circle
as
the
best
of
sons
,
a
hero
,
and
their
darling
*NL*
Nikolenka
;
by
his
relations
as
a
charming
,
attractive
,
and
polite
young
*NL*
man
;
by
his
acquaintances
as
a
handsome
lieutenant
of
hussars
,
a
good
*NL*
dancer
,
and
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rostovs
knew
everybody
in
Moscow
.
The
old
count
had
money
enough
*NL*
that
year
,
as
all
his
estates
had
been
remortgaged
,
and
so
Nicholas
,
*NL*
acquiring
a
trotter
of
his
own
,
very
stylish
riding
breeches
of
the
*NL*
latest
cut
,
such
as
no
one
else
yet
had
in
Moscow
,
and
boots
of
the
*NL*
latest
fashion
,
with
extremely
pointed
toes
and
small
silver
spurs
,
*NL*
passed
his
time
very
gaily
.
After
a
short
period
of
adapting
himself
to
*NL*
the
old
conditions
of
life
,
Nicholas
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
at
*NL*
home
again
.
He
felt
that
he
had
grown
up
and
matured
very
much
.
His
*NL*
despair
at
failing
in
a
Scripture
examination
,
his
borrowing
money
from
*NL*
Gavril
to
pay
a
sleigh
driver
,
his
kissing
Sonya
on
the
sly
--
he
now
*NL*
recalled
all
this
as
childishness
he
had
left
immeasurably
behind
.
Now
*NL*
he
was
a
lieutenant
of
hussars
,
in
a
jacket
laced
with
silver
,
and
*NL*
wearing
the
Cross
of
St.
George
,
awarded
to
soldiers
for
bravery
in
*NL*
action
,
and
in
the
company
of
well-known
,
elderly
,
and
respected
racing
*NL*
men
was
training
a
trotter
of
his
own
for
a
race
.
He
knew
a
lady
on
one
*NL*
of
the
boulevards
whom
he
visited
of
an
evening
.
He
led
the
mazurka
at
*NL*
the
Arkharovs
'
ball
,
talked
about
the
war
with
Field
Marshal
Kamenski
,
*NL*
visited
the
English
Club
,
and
was
on
intimate
terms
with
a
colonel
of
*NL*
forty
to
whom
Denisov
had
introduced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
passion
for
the
Emperor
had
cooled
somewhat
in
Moscow
.
But
still
,
as
*NL*
he
did
not
see
him
and
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
him
,
he
often
spoke
*NL*
about
him
and
about
his
love
for
him
,
letting
it
be
understood
that
he
*NL*
had
not
told
all
and
that
there
was
something
in
his
feelings
for
the
*NL*
Emperor
not
everyone
could
understand
,
and
with
his
whole
soul
he
shared
*NL*
the
adoration
then
common
in
Moscow
for
the
Emperor
,
who
was
spoken
of
*NL*
as
the
``
angel
incarnate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
Rostov
's
short
stay
in
Moscow
,
before
rejoining
the
army
,
he
did
*NL*
not
draw
closer
to
Sonya
,
but
rather
drifted
away
from
her
.
She
was
very
*NL*
pretty
and
sweet
,
and
evidently
deeply
in
love
with
him
,
but
he
was
at
*NL*
the
period
of
youth
when
there
seems
so
much
to
do
that
there
is
no
time
*NL*
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
young
man
fears
to
bind
himself
and
prizes
*NL*
his
freedom
which
he
needs
for
so
many
other
things
.
When
he
thought
of
*NL*
Sonya
,
during
this
stay
in
Moscow
,
he
said
to
himself
,
``
Ah
,
there
will
*NL*
be
,
and
there
are
,
many
more
such
girls
somewhere
whom
I
do
not
yet
*NL*
know
.
There
will
be
time
enough
to
think
about
love
when
I
want
to
,
but
*NL*
now
I
have
no
time
.
''
Besides
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
society
of
women
*NL*
was
rather
derogatory
to
his
manhood
.
He
went
to
balls
and
into
ladies
'
*NL*
society
with
an
affectation
of
doing
so
against
his
will
.
The
races
,
the
*NL*
English
Club
,
sprees
with
Denisov
,
and
visits
to
a
certain
house
--
that
*NL*
was
another
matter
and
quite
the
thing
for
a
dashing
young
hussar
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
March
,
old
Count
Ilya
Rostov
was
very
busy
arranging
*NL*
a
dinner
in
honor
of
Prince
Bagration
at
the
English
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
in
his
dressing
gown
,
giving
*NL*
orders
to
the
club
steward
and
to
the
famous
Feoktist
,
the
club
's
head
*NL*
cook
,
about
asparagus
,
fresh
cucumbers
,
strawberries
,
veal
,
and
fish
for
*NL*
this
dinner
.
The
count
had
been
a
member
and
on
the
committee
of
the
*NL*
club
from
the
day
it
was
founded
.
To
him
the
club
entrusted
the
*NL*
arrangement
of
the
festival
in
honor
of
Bagration
,
for
few
men
knew
so
*NL*
well
how
to
arrange
a
feast
on
an
open-handed
,
hospitable
scale
,
and
*NL*
still
fewer
men
would
be
so
well
able
and
willing
to
make
up
out
of
*NL*
their
own
resources
what
might
be
needed
for
the
success
of
the
fete
.
*NL*
The
club
cook
and
the
steward
listened
to
the
count
's
orders
with
*NL*
pleased
faces
,
for
they
knew
that
under
no
other
management
could
they
*NL*
so
easily
extract
a
good
profit
for
themselves
from
a
dinner
costing
*NL*
several
thousand
rubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
mind
and
have
cocks
'
comb
in
the
turtle
soup
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
have
three
cold
dishes
then
?
''
asked
the
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
have
less
--
yes
,
three
...
the
mayonnaise
,
that
's
one
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
bending
down
a
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
am
I
to
order
those
large
sterlets
?
''
asked
the
steward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
if
they
wo
n't
take
less
.
Ah
,
dear
me
!
I
was
*NL*
forgetting
.
We
must
have
another
entree
.
Ah
,
goodness
gracious
!
''
he
*NL*
clutched
at
his
head
.
``
Who
is
going
to
get
me
the
flowers
?
Dmitri
!
Eh
,
*NL*
Dmitri
!
Gallop
off
to
our
Moscow
estate
,
''
he
said
to
the
factotum
who
*NL*
appeared
at
his
call
.
``
Hurry
off
and
tell
Maksim
,
the
gardener
,
to
set
*NL*
the
serfs
to
work
.
Say
that
everything
out
of
the
hothouses
must
be
*NL*
brought
here
well
wrapped
up
in
felt
.
I
must
have
two
hundred
pots
here
*NL*
on
Friday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
given
several
more
orders
,
he
was
about
to
go
to
his
``
little
*NL*
countess
''
to
have
a
rest
,
but
remembering
something
else
of
importance
,
*NL*
he
returned
again
,
called
back
the
cook
and
the
club
steward
,
and
again
*NL*
began
giving
orders
.
A
light
footstep
and
the
clinking
of
spurs
were
*NL*
heard
at
the
door
,
and
the
young
count
,
handsome
,
rosy
,
with
a
dark
*NL*
little
mustache
,
evidently
rested
and
made
sleeker
by
his
easy
life
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
boy
,
my
head
's
in
a
whirl
!
''
said
the
old
man
with
a
smile
,
as
if
*NL*
he
felt
a
little
confused
before
his
son
.
``
Now
,
if
you
would
only
help
a
*NL*
bit
!
I
must
have
singers
too
.
I
shall
have
my
own
orchestra
,
but
*NL*
should
n't
we
get
the
gypsy
singers
as
well
?
You
military
men
like
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
Papa
,
I
believe
Prince
Bagration
worried
himself
less
before
*NL*
the
battle
of
Schon
Grabern
than
you
do
now
,
''
said
his
son
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
pretended
to
be
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
talk
,
but
try
it
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
count
turned
to
the
cook
,
who
,
with
a
shrewd
and
respectful
*NL*
expression
,
looked
observantly
and
sympathetically
at
the
father
and
*NL*
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
the
young
people
come
to
nowadays
,
eh
,
Feoktist
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
Laughing
at
us
old
fellows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
your
excellency
,
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
eat
a
good
*NL*
dinner
,
but
providing
it
and
serving
it
all
up
,
that
's
not
their
*NL*
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
that
's
it
!
''
exclaimed
the
count
,
and
gaily
seizing
his
son
*NL*
by
both
hands
,
he
cried
,
``
Now
I
've
got
you
,
so
take
the
sleigh
and
pair
*NL*
at
once
,
and
go
to
Bezukhov
's
,
and
tell
him
`
Count
Ilya
has
sent
you
to
*NL*
ask
for
strawberries
and
fresh
pineapples
.
'
We
ca
n't
get
them
from
*NL*
anyone
else
.
He
's
not
there
himself
,
so
you
'll
have
to
go
in
and
ask
the
*NL*
princesses
;
and
from
there
go
on
to
the
Rasgulyay
--
the
coachman
Ipatka
*NL*
knows
--
and
look
up
the
gypsy
Ilyushka
,
the
one
who
danced
at
Count
*NL*
Orlov
's
,
you
remember
,
in
a
white
Cossack
coat
,
and
bring
him
along
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
am
I
to
bring
the
gypsy
girls
along
with
him
?
''
asked
Nicholas
,
*NL*
laughing
.
``
Dear
,
dear
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
with
the
businesslike
,
*NL*
preoccupied
,
yet
meekly
Christian
look
which
never
left
her
face
,
Anna
*NL*
Mikhaylovna
entered
the
hall
.
Though
she
came
upon
the
count
in
his
*NL*
dressing
gown
every
day
,
he
invariably
became
confused
and
begged
her
to
*NL*
excuse
his
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
at
all
,
my
dear
count
,
''
she
said
,
meekly
closing
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
go
to
Bezukhov
's
myself
.
Pierre
has
arrived
,
and
now
we
shall
*NL*
get
anything
we
want
from
his
hothouses
.
I
have
to
see
him
in
any
case
.
*NL*
He
has
forwarded
me
a
letter
from
Boris
.
Thank
God
,
Boris
is
now
on
the
*NL*
staff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
was
delighted
at
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
taking
upon
herself
one
of
*NL*
his
commissions
and
ordered
the
small
closed
carriage
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
Bezukhov
to
come
.
I
'll
put
his
name
down
.
Is
his
wife
with
him
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
turned
up
her
eyes
,
and
profound
sadness
was
depicted
*NL*
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
friend
,
he
is
very
unfortunate
,
''
she
said
.
``
If
what
we
hear
*NL*
is
true
,
it
is
dreadful
.
How
little
we
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
when
we
*NL*
were
rejoicing
at
his
happiness
!
And
such
a
lofty
angelic
soul
as
young
*NL*
Bezukhov
!
Yes
,
I
pity
him
from
my
heart
,
and
shall
try
to
give
him
what
*NL*
consolation
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wh-what
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
both
the
young
and
old
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolokhov
,
Mary
Ivanovna
's
son
,
''
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
,
``
has
*NL*
compromised
her
completely
,
they
say
.
Pierre
took
him
up
,
invited
him
to
*NL*
his
house
in
Petersburg
,
and
now
...
she
has
come
here
and
that
daredevil
*NL*
after
her
!
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
wishing
to
show
her
sympathy
for
*NL*
Pierre
,
but
by
involuntary
intonations
and
a
half
smile
betraying
her
*NL*
sympathy
for
the
``
daredevil
,
''
as
she
called
Dolokhov
.
``
They
say
Pierre
*NL*
is
quite
broken
by
his
misfortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
!
But
still
tell
him
to
come
to
the
club
--
it
will
all
blow
*NL*
over
.
It
will
be
a
tremendous
banquet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
the
third
of
March
,
soon
after
one
o'clock
,
two
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
members
of
the
English
Club
and
fifty
guests
were
awaiting
the
*NL*
guest
of
honor
and
hero
of
the
Austrian
campaign
,
Prince
Bagration
,
to
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
arrival
of
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
,
Moscow
had
*NL*
been
bewildered
.
At
that
time
,
the
Russians
were
so
used
to
victories
*NL*
that
on
receiving
news
of
the
defeat
some
would
simply
not
believe
it
,
*NL*
while
others
sought
some
extraordinary
explanation
of
so
strange
an
*NL*
event
.
In
the
English
Club
,
where
all
who
were
distinguished
,
important
,
*NL*
and
well
informed
foregathered
when
the
news
began
to
arrive
in
*NL*
December
,
nothing
was
said
about
the
war
and
the
last
battle
,
as
though
*NL*
all
were
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence
.
The
men
who
set
the
tone
in
*NL*
conversation
--
Count
Rostopchin
,
Prince
Yuri
Dolgorukov
,
Valuev
,
Count
*NL*
Markov
,
and
Prince
Vyazemski
--
did
not
show
themselves
at
the
club
,
but
*NL*
met
in
private
houses
in
intimate
circles
,
and
the
Moscovites
who
took
*NL*
their
opinions
from
others
--
Ilya
Rostov
among
them
--
remained
for
a
while
*NL*
without
any
definite
opinion
on
the
subject
of
the
war
and
without
*NL*
leaders
.
The
Moscovites
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
that
to
*NL*
discuss
the
bad
news
was
difficult
,
and
so
it
was
best
to
be
silent
.
But
*NL*
after
a
while
,
just
as
a
jury
comes
out
of
its
room
,
the
bigwigs
who
*NL*
guided
the
club
's
opinion
reappeared
,
and
everybody
began
speaking
*NL*
clearly
and
definitely
.
Reasons
were
found
for
the
incredible
,
unheard
-
*NL*
of
,
and
impossible
event
of
a
Russian
defeat
,
everything
became
clear
,
*NL*
and
in
all
corners
of
Moscow
the
same
things
began
to
be
said
.
These
*NL*
reasons
were
the
treachery
of
the
Austrians
,
a
defective
commissariat
,
*NL*
the
treachery
of
the
Pole
Przebyszewski
and
of
the
Frenchman
Langeron
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
incapacity
,
and
-LRB-
it
was
whispered
-RRB-
the
youth
and
inexperience
*NL*
of
the
sovereign
,
who
had
trusted
worthless
and
insignificant
people
.
*NL*
But
the
army
,
the
Russian
army
,
everyone
declared
,
was
extraordinary
and
*NL*
had
achieved
miracles
of
valor
.
The
soldiers
,
officers
,
and
generals
*NL*
were
heroes
.
But
the
hero
of
heroes
was
Prince
Bagration
,
distinguished
*NL*
by
his
Schon
Grabern
affair
and
by
the
retreat
from
Austerlitz
,
where
he
*NL*
alone
had
withdrawn
his
column
unbroken
and
had
all
day
beaten
back
an
*NL*
enemy
force
twice
as
numerous
as
his
own
.
What
also
conduced
to
*NL*
Bagration
's
being
selected
as
Moscow
's
hero
was
the
fact
that
he
had
no
*NL*
connections
in
the
city
and
was
a
stranger
there
.
In
his
person
,
honor
*NL*
was
shown
to
a
simple
fighting
Russian
soldier
without
connections
and
*NL*
intrigues
,
and
to
one
who
was
associated
by
memories
of
the
Italian
*NL*
campaign
with
the
name
of
Suvorov
.
Moreover
,
paying
such
honor
to
*NL*
Bagration
was
the
best
way
of
expressing
disapproval
and
dislike
of
*NL*
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
there
been
no
Bagration
,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
*NL*
him
,
''
said
the
wit
Shinshin
,
parodying
the
words
of
Voltaire
.
Kutuzov
no
*NL*
one
spoke
of
,
except
some
who
abused
him
in
whispers
,
calling
him
a
*NL*
court
weathercock
and
an
old
satyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Moscow
repeated
Prince
Dolgorukov
's
saying
:
``
If
you
go
on
modeling
*NL*
and
modeling
you
must
get
smeared
with
clay
,
''
suggesting
consolation
for
*NL*
our
defeat
by
the
memory
of
former
victories
;
and
the
words
of
*NL*
Rostopchin
,
that
French
soldiers
have
to
be
incited
to
battle
by
*NL*
highfalutin
words
,
and
Germans
by
logical
arguments
to
show
them
that
it
*NL*
is
more
dangerous
to
run
away
than
to
advance
,
but
that
Russian
soldiers
*NL*
only
need
to
be
restrained
and
held
back
!
On
all
sides
,
new
and
fresh
*NL*
anecdotes
were
heard
of
individual
examples
of
heroism
shown
by
our
*NL*
officers
and
men
at
Austerlitz
.
One
had
saved
a
standard
,
another
had
*NL*
killed
five
Frenchmen
,
a
third
had
loaded
five
cannon
singlehanded
.
Berg
*NL*
was
mentioned
,
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
,
as
having
,
when
wounded
in
*NL*
the
right
hand
,
taken
his
sword
in
the
left
,
and
gone
forward
.
Of
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
nothing
was
said
,
and
only
those
who
knew
him
intimately
*NL*
regretted
that
he
had
died
so
young
,
leaving
a
pregnant
wife
with
his
*NL*
eccentric
father
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
third
of
March
,
all
the
rooms
in
the
English
Club
were
filled
*NL*
with
a
hum
of
conversation
,
like
the
hum
of
bees
swarming
in
springtime
.
*NL*
The
members
and
guests
of
the
club
wandered
hither
and
thither
,
sat
,
*NL*
stood
,
met
,
and
separated
,
some
in
uniform
and
some
in
evening
dress
,
*NL*
and
a
few
here
and
there
with
powdered
hair
and
in
Russian
kaftans
.
*NL*
Powdered
footmen
,
in
livery
with
buckled
shoes
and
smart
stockings
,
*NL*
stood
at
every
door
anxiously
noting
visitors
'
every
movement
in
order
*NL*
to
offer
their
services
.
Most
of
those
present
were
elderly
,
respected
*NL*
men
with
broad
,
self-confident
faces
,
fat
fingers
,
and
resolute
gestures
*NL*
and
voices
.
This
class
of
guests
and
members
sat
in
certain
habitual
*NL*
places
and
met
in
certain
habitual
groups
.
A
minority
of
those
present
*NL*
were
casual
guests
--
chiefly
young
men
,
among
whom
were
Denisov
,
Rostov
,
*NL*
and
Dolokhov
--
who
was
now
again
an
officer
in
the
Semenov
regiment
.
The
*NL*
faces
of
these
young
people
,
especially
those
who
were
military
men
,
*NL*
bore
that
expression
of
condescending
respect
for
their
elders
which
*NL*
seems
to
say
to
the
older
generation
,
``
We
are
prepared
to
respect
and
*NL*
honor
you
,
but
all
the
same
remember
that
the
future
belongs
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
was
there
as
an
old
member
of
the
club
.
Pierre
,
who
at
his
*NL*
wife
's
command
had
let
his
hair
grow
and
abandoned
his
spectacles
,
went
*NL*
about
the
rooms
fashionably
dressed
but
looking
sad
and
dull
.
Here
,
as
*NL*
elsewhere
,
he
was
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
subservience
to
his
*NL*
wealth
,
and
being
in
the
habit
of
lording
it
over
these
people
,
he
*NL*
treated
them
with
absent-minded
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
his
age
he
should
have
belonged
to
the
younger
men
,
but
by
his
wealth
*NL*
and
connections
he
belonged
to
the
groups
of
old
and
honored
guests
,
and
*NL*
so
he
went
from
one
group
to
another
.
Some
of
the
most
important
old
men
*NL*
were
the
center
of
groups
which
even
strangers
approached
respectfully
*NL*
to
hear
the
voices
of
well-known
men
.
The
largest
circles
formed
round
*NL*
Count
Rostopchin
,
Valuev
,
and
Naryshkin
.
Rostopchin
was
describing
how
*NL*
the
Russians
had
been
overwhelmed
by
flying
Austrians
and
had
had
to
*NL*
force
their
way
through
them
with
bayonets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valuev
was
confidentially
telling
that
Uvarov
had
been
sent
from
*NL*
Petersburg
to
ascertain
what
Moscow
was
thinking
about
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
third
circle
,
Naryshkin
was
speaking
of
the
meeting
of
the
*NL*
Austrian
Council
of
War
at
which
Suvorov
crowed
like
a
cock
in
reply
to
*NL*
the
nonsense
talked
by
the
Austrian
generals
.
Shinshin
,
standing
close
*NL*
by
,
tried
to
make
a
joke
,
saying
that
Kutuzov
had
evidently
failed
to
*NL*
learn
from
Suvorov
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
the
art
of
crowing
like
a
*NL*
cock
,
but
the
elder
members
glanced
severely
at
the
wit
,
making
him
feel
*NL*
that
in
that
place
and
on
that
day
,
it
was
improper
to
speak
so
of
*NL*
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
hurried
and
preoccupied
,
went
about
in
his
soft
boots
*NL*
between
the
dining
and
drawing
rooms
,
hastily
greeting
the
important
and
*NL*
unimportant
,
all
of
whom
he
knew
,
as
if
they
were
all
equals
,
while
his
*NL*
eyes
occasionally
sought
out
his
fine
well-set-up
young
son
,
resting
on
*NL*
him
and
winking
joyfully
at
him
.
Young
Rostov
stood
at
a
window
with
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
whose
acquaintance
he
had
lately
made
and
highly
valued
.
The
*NL*
old
count
came
up
to
them
and
pressed
Dolokhov
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
and
visit
us
...
you
know
my
brave
boy
...
been
together
out
*NL*
there
...
both
playing
the
hero
...
Ah
,
Vasili
Ignatovich
...
How
d'ye
do
,
*NL*
old
fellow
?
''
he
said
,
turning
to
an
old
man
who
was
passing
,
but
before
*NL*
he
had
finished
his
greeting
there
was
a
general
stir
,
and
a
footman
who
*NL*
had
run
in
announced
,
with
a
frightened
face
:
``
He
's
arrived
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bells
rang
,
the
stewards
rushed
forward
,
and
--
like
rye
shaken
together
*NL*
in
a
shovel
--
the
guests
who
had
been
scattered
about
in
different
rooms
*NL*
came
together
and
crowded
in
the
large
drawing
room
by
the
door
of
the
*NL*
ballroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
anteroom
without
hat
or
sword
,
*NL*
which
,
in
accord
with
the
club
custom
,
he
had
given
up
to
the
hall
*NL*
porter
.
He
had
no
lambskin
cap
on
his
head
,
nor
had
he
a
loaded
whip
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
,
as
when
Rostov
had
seen
him
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
*NL*
of
Austerlitz
,
but
wore
a
tight
new
uniform
with
Russian
and
foreign
*NL*
Orders
,
and
the
Star
of
St.
George
on
his
left
breast
.
Evidently
just
*NL*
before
coming
to
the
dinner
he
had
had
his
hair
and
whiskers
trimmed
,
*NL*
which
changed
his
appearance
for
the
worse
.
There
was
something
naively
*NL*
festive
in
his
air
,
which
,
in
conjunction
with
his
firm
and
virile
*NL*
features
,
gave
him
a
rather
comical
expression
.
Bekleshev
and
Theodore
*NL*
Uvarov
,
who
had
arrived
with
him
,
paused
at
the
doorway
to
allow
him
,
as
*NL*
the
guest
of
honor
,
to
enter
first
.
Bagration
was
embarrassed
,
not
*NL*
wishing
to
avail
himself
of
their
courtesy
,
and
this
caused
some
delay
*NL*
at
the
doors
,
but
after
all
he
did
at
last
enter
first
.
He
walked
shyly
*NL*
and
awkwardly
over
the
parquet
floor
of
the
reception
room
,
not
knowing
*NL*
what
to
do
with
his
hands
;
he
was
more
accustomed
to
walk
over
a
plowed
*NL*
field
under
fire
,
as
he
had
done
at
the
head
of
the
Kursk
regiment
at
*NL*
Schon
Grabern
--
and
he
would
have
found
that
easier
.
The
committeemen
met
*NL*
him
at
the
first
door
and
,
expressing
their
delight
at
seeing
such
a
*NL*
highly
honored
guest
,
took
possession
of
him
as
it
were
,
without
waiting
*NL*
for
his
reply
,
surrounded
him
,
and
led
him
to
the
drawing
room
.
It
was
*NL*
at
first
impossible
to
enter
the
drawing-room
door
for
the
crowd
of
*NL*
members
and
guests
jostling
one
another
and
trying
to
get
a
good
look
at
*NL*
Bagration
over
each
other
's
shoulders
,
as
if
he
were
some
rare
animal
.
*NL*
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
laughing
and
repeating
the
words
,
``
Make
way
,
dear
*NL*
boy
!
Make
way
,
make
way
!
''
pushed
through
the
crowd
more
energetically
*NL*
than
anyone
,
led
the
guests
into
the
drawing
room
,
and
seated
them
on
*NL*
the
center
sofa
.
The
bigwigs
,
the
most
respected
members
of
the
club
,
*NL*
beset
the
new
arrivals
.
Count
Ilya
,
again
thrusting
his
way
through
the
*NL*
crowd
,
went
out
of
the
drawing
room
and
reappeared
a
minute
later
with
*NL*
another
committeeman
,
carrying
a
large
silver
salver
which
he
presented
*NL*
to
Prince
Bagration
.
On
the
salver
lay
some
verses
composed
and
printed
*NL*
in
the
hero
's
honor
.
Bagration
,
on
seeing
the
salver
,
glanced
around
in
*NL*
dismay
,
as
though
seeking
help
.
But
all
eyes
demanded
that
he
should
*NL*
submit
.
Feeling
himself
in
their
power
,
he
resolutely
took
the
salver
*NL*
with
both
hands
and
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
the
count
who
*NL*
had
presented
it
to
him
.
Someone
obligingly
took
the
dish
from
Bagration
*NL*
-LRB-
or
he
would
,
it
seemed
,
have
held
it
till
evening
and
have
gone
in
to
*NL*
dinner
with
it
-RRB-
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
read
them
,
then
!
''
Bagration
seemed
to
say
,
and
,
fixing
his
*NL*
weary
eyes
on
the
paper
,
began
to
read
them
with
a
fixed
and
serious
*NL*
expression
.
But
the
author
himself
took
the
verses
and
began
reading
*NL*
them
aloud
.
Bagration
bowed
his
head
and
listened
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bring
glory
then
to
Alexander
's
reign
And
on
the
throne
our
Titus
*NL*
shield
.
A
dreaded
foe
be
thou
,
kindhearted
as
a
man
,
A
Rhipheus
at
home
,
*NL*
a
Caesar
in
the
field
!
E'en
fortunate
Napoleon
Knows
by
experience
,
now
,
*NL*
Bagration
,
And
dare
not
Herculean
Russians
trouble
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
he
had
finished
reading
,
a
stentorian
major-domo
announced
*NL*
that
dinner
was
ready
!
The
door
opened
,
and
from
the
dining
room
came
*NL*
the
resounding
strains
of
the
polonaise
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Conquest
's
joyful
thunder
waken
,
Triumph
,
valiant
Russians
,
now
!
...
*NL*
*NL*
and
Count
Rostov
,
glancing
angrily
at
the
author
who
went
on
reading
his
*NL*
verses
,
bowed
to
Bagration
.
Everyone
rose
,
feeling
that
dinner
was
more
*NL*
important
than
verses
,
and
Bagration
,
again
preceding
all
the
rest
,
went
*NL*
in
to
dinner
.
He
was
seated
in
the
place
of
honor
between
two
*NL*
Alexanders
--
Bekleshev
and
Naryshkin
--
which
was
a
significant
allusion
to
*NL*
the
name
of
the
sovereign
.
Three
hundred
persons
took
their
seats
in
the
*NL*
dining
room
,
according
to
their
rank
and
importance
:
the
more
important
*NL*
nearer
to
the
honored
guest
,
as
naturally
as
water
flows
deepest
where
*NL*
the
land
lies
lowest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
dinner
,
Count
Ilya
Rostov
presented
his
son
to
Bagration
,
*NL*
who
recognized
him
and
said
a
few
words
to
him
,
disjointed
and
awkward
,
*NL*
as
were
all
the
words
he
spoke
that
day
,
and
Count
Ilya
looked
joyfully
*NL*
and
proudly
around
while
Bagration
spoke
to
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
,
with
Denisov
and
his
new
acquaintance
,
Dolokhov
,
sat
*NL*
almost
at
the
middle
of
the
table
.
Facing
them
sat
Pierre
,
beside
Prince
*NL*
Nesvitski
.
Count
Ilya
Rostov
with
the
other
members
of
the
committee
sat
*NL*
facing
Bagration
and
,
as
the
very
personification
of
Moscow
hospitality
,
*NL*
did
the
honors
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
efforts
had
not
been
in
vain
.
The
dinner
,
both
the
Lenten
and
the
*NL*
other
fare
,
was
splendid
,
yet
he
could
not
feel
quite
at
ease
till
the
*NL*
end
of
the
meal
.
He
winked
at
the
butler
,
whispered
directions
to
the
*NL*
footmen
,
and
awaited
each
expected
dish
with
some
anxiety
.
Everything
*NL*
was
excellent
.
With
the
second
course
,
a
gigantic
sterlet
-LRB-
at
sight
of
*NL*
which
Ilya
Rostov
blushed
with
self-conscious
pleasure
-RRB-
,
the
footmen
*NL*
began
popping
corks
and
filling
the
champagne
glasses
.
After
the
fish
,
*NL*
which
made
a
certain
sensation
,
the
count
exchanged
glances
with
the
*NL*
other
committeemen
.
``
There
will
be
many
toasts
,
it
's
time
to
begin
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
,
and
taking
up
his
glass
,
he
rose
.
All
were
silent
,
waiting
*NL*
for
what
he
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
health
of
our
Sovereign
,
the
Emperor
!
''
he
cried
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
his
kindly
eyes
grew
moist
with
tears
of
joy
and
enthusiasm
.
The
*NL*
band
immediately
struck
up
``
Conquest
's
joyful
thunder
waken
...
''
All
rose
*NL*
and
cried
``
Hurrah
!
''
Bagration
also
rose
and
shouted
``
Hurrah
!
''
in
exactly
*NL*
the
same
voice
in
which
he
had
shouted
it
on
the
field
at
Schon
Grabern
.
*NL*
Young
Rostov
's
ecstatic
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
three
hundred
*NL*
others
.
He
nearly
wept
.
``
To
the
health
of
our
Sovereign
,
the
Emperor
!
''
*NL*
he
roared
,
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
emptying
his
glass
at
one
gulp
he
dashed
it
to
*NL*
the
floor
.
Many
followed
his
example
,
and
the
loud
shouting
continued
*NL*
for
a
long
time
.
When
the
voices
subsided
,
the
footmen
cleared
away
the
*NL*
broken
glass
and
everybody
sat
down
again
,
smiling
at
the
noise
they
had
*NL*
made
and
exchanging
remarks
.
The
old
count
rose
once
more
,
glanced
at
a
*NL*
note
lying
beside
his
plate
,
and
proposed
a
toast
,
``
To
the
health
of
the
*NL*
hero
of
our
last
campaign
,
Prince
Peter
Ivanovich
Bagration
!
''
and
again
*NL*
his
blue
eyes
grew
moist
.
``
Hurrah
!
''
cried
the
three
hundred
voices
*NL*
again
,
but
instead
of
the
band
a
choir
began
singing
a
cantata
composed
*NL*
by
Paul
Ivanovich
Kutuzov
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Russians
!
O'er
all
barriers
on
!
Courage
conquest
guarantees
;
Have
we
not
*NL*
Bagration
?
He
brings
foe
men
to
their
knees
,
...
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
singing
was
over
,
another
and
another
toast
was
proposed
*NL*
and
Count
Ilya
Rostov
became
more
and
more
moved
,
more
glass
was
*NL*
smashed
,
and
the
shouting
grew
louder
.
They
drank
to
Bekleshev
,
*NL*
Naryshkin
,
Uvarov
,
Dolgorukov
,
Apraksin
,
Valuev
,
to
the
committee
,
to
*NL*
all
the
club
members
and
to
all
the
club
guests
,
and
finally
to
Count
*NL*
Ilya
Rostov
separately
,
as
the
organizer
of
the
banquet
.
At
that
toast
,
*NL*
the
count
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
,
covering
his
face
,
wept
*NL*
outright
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
sat
opposite
Dolokhov
and
Nicholas
Rostov
.
As
usual
,
he
ate
and
*NL*
drank
much
,
and
eagerly
.
But
those
who
knew
him
intimately
noticed
that
*NL*
some
great
change
had
come
over
him
that
day
.
He
was
silent
all
through
*NL*
dinner
and
looked
about
,
blinking
and
scowling
,
or
,
with
fixed
eyes
and
*NL*
a
look
of
complete
absent-mindedness
,
kept
rubbing
the
bridge
of
his
*NL*
nose
.
His
face
was
depressed
and
gloomy
.
He
seemed
to
see
and
hear
*NL*
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
to
be
absorbed
by
some
*NL*
depressing
and
unsolved
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unsolved
problem
that
tormented
him
was
caused
by
hints
given
by
the
*NL*
princess
,
his
cousin
,
at
Moscow
,
concerning
Dolokhov
's
intimacy
with
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
by
an
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
that
morning
,
which
in
*NL*
the
mean
jocular
way
common
to
anonymous
letters
said
that
he
saw
badly
*NL*
through
his
spectacles
,
but
that
his
wife
's
connection
with
Dolokhov
was
*NL*
a
secret
to
no
one
but
himself
.
Pierre
absolutely
disbelieved
both
the
*NL*
princess
'
hints
and
the
letter
,
but
he
feared
now
to
look
at
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
.
Every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
handsome
insolent
eyes
,
Pierre
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
*NL*
rising
in
his
soul
and
turned
quickly
away
.
Involuntarily
recalling
his
*NL*
wife
's
past
and
her
relations
with
Dolokhov
,
Pierre
saw
clearly
that
*NL*
what
was
said
in
the
letter
might
be
true
,
or
might
at
least
seem
to
be
*NL*
true
had
it
not
referred
to
his
wife
.
He
involuntarily
remembered
how
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
who
had
fully
recovered
his
former
position
after
the
*NL*
campaign
,
had
returned
to
Petersburg
and
come
to
him
.
Availing
himself
*NL*
of
his
friendly
relations
with
Pierre
as
a
boon
companion
,
Dolokhov
had
*NL*
come
straight
to
his
house
,
and
Pierre
had
put
him
up
and
lent
him
*NL*
money
.
Pierre
recalled
how
Helene
had
smilingly
expressed
disapproval
of
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
living
at
their
house
,
and
how
cynically
Dolokhov
had
praised
*NL*
his
wife
's
beauty
to
him
and
from
that
time
till
they
came
to
Moscow
had
*NL*
not
left
them
for
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
very
handsome
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
``
and
I
know
him
.
It
would
be
*NL*
particularly
pleasant
to
him
to
dishonor
my
name
and
ridicule
me
,
just
*NL*
because
I
have
exerted
myself
on
his
behalf
,
befriended
him
,
and
helped
*NL*
him
.
I
know
and
understand
what
a
spice
that
would
add
to
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
deceiving
me
,
if
it
really
were
true
.
Yes
,
if
it
were
true
,
but
I
do
*NL*
not
believe
it
.
I
have
no
right
to
,
and
ca
n't
,
believe
it
.
''
He
*NL*
remembered
the
expression
Dolokhov
's
face
assumed
in
his
moments
of
*NL*
cruelty
,
as
when
tying
the
policeman
to
the
bear
and
dropping
them
into
*NL*
the
water
,
or
when
he
challenged
a
man
to
a
duel
without
any
reason
,
or
*NL*
shot
a
post-boy
's
horse
with
a
pistol
.
That
expression
was
often
on
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
face
when
looking
at
him
.
``
Yes
,
he
is
a
bully
,
''
thought
*NL*
Pierre
,
``
to
kill
a
man
means
nothing
to
him
.
It
must
seem
to
him
that
*NL*
everyone
is
afraid
of
him
,
and
that
must
please
him
.
He
must
think
that
*NL*
I
,
too
,
am
afraid
of
him
--
and
in
fact
I
am
afraid
of
him
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
and
again
he
felt
something
terrible
and
monstrous
rising
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
Denisov
,
and
Rostov
were
now
sitting
opposite
Pierre
and
*NL*
seemed
very
gay
.
Rostov
was
talking
merrily
to
his
two
friends
,
one
of
*NL*
whom
was
a
dashing
hussar
and
the
other
a
notorious
duelist
and
rake
,
*NL*
and
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
ironically
at
Pierre
,
whose
*NL*
preoccupied
,
absent-minded
,
and
massive
figure
was
a
very
noticeable
one
*NL*
at
the
dinner
.
Rostov
looked
inimically
at
Pierre
,
first
because
Pierre
*NL*
appeared
to
his
hussar
eyes
as
a
rich
civilian
,
the
husband
of
a
beauty
,
*NL*
and
in
a
word
--
an
old
woman
;
and
secondly
because
Pierre
in
his
*NL*
preoccupation
and
absent-mindedness
had
not
recognized
Rostov
and
had
*NL*
not
responded
to
his
greeting
.
When
the
Emperor
's
health
was
drunk
,
*NL*
Pierre
,
lost
in
thought
,
did
not
rise
or
lift
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
about
?
''
shouted
Rostov
,
looking
at
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
*NL*
exasperation
.
``
Do
n't
you
hear
it
's
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
's
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
sighed
,
rose
submissively
,
emptied
his
glass
,
and
,
waiting
till
*NL*
all
were
seated
again
,
turned
with
his
kindly
smile
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
did
n't
recognize
you
!
''
he
said
.
But
Rostov
was
otherwise
*NL*
engaged
;
he
was
shouting
``
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
renew
the
acquaintance
?
''
said
Dolokhov
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
him
,
he
's
a
fool
!
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
should
make
up
to
the
husbands
of
pretty
women
,
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
catch
what
they
were
saying
,
but
knew
they
were
talking
*NL*
about
him
.
He
reddened
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
to
the
health
of
handsome
women
!
''
said
Dolokhov
,
and
with
a
*NL*
serious
expression
,
but
with
a
smile
lurking
at
the
corners
of
his
*NL*
mouth
,
he
turned
with
his
glass
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
to
the
health
of
lovely
women
,
Peterkin
--
and
their
lovers
!
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
drank
out
of
his
glass
without
looking
at
*NL*
Dolokhov
or
answering
him
.
The
footman
,
who
was
distributing
leaflets
*NL*
with
Kutuzov
's
cantata
,
laid
one
before
Pierre
as
one
of
the
principal
*NL*
guests
.
He
was
just
going
to
take
it
when
Dolokhov
,
leaning
across
,
*NL*
snatched
it
from
his
hand
and
began
reading
it
.
Pierre
looked
at
*NL*
Dolokhov
and
his
eyes
dropped
,
the
something
terrible
and
monstrous
that
*NL*
had
tormented
him
all
dinnertime
rose
and
took
possession
of
him
.
He
*NL*
leaned
his
whole
massive
body
across
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
take
it
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
cry
and
seeing
to
whom
it
was
addressed
,
Nesvitski
and
the
*NL*
neighbor
on
his
right
quickly
turned
in
alarm
to
Bezukhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
Do
n't
!
What
are
you
about
?
''
whispered
their
frightened
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
looked
at
Pierre
with
clear
,
mirthful
,
cruel
eyes
,
and
that
*NL*
smile
of
his
which
seemed
to
say
,
``
Ah
!
This
is
what
I
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sha
n't
have
it
!
''
he
said
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pale
,
with
quivering
lips
,
Pierre
snatched
the
copy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
...
!
you
...
scoundrel
!
I
challenge
you
!
''
he
ejaculated
,
and
,
pushing
*NL*
back
his
chair
,
he
rose
from
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
instant
he
did
this
and
uttered
those
words
,
Pierre
felt
*NL*
that
the
question
of
his
wife
's
guilt
which
had
been
tormenting
him
the
*NL*
whole
day
was
finally
and
indubitably
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
He
*NL*
hated
her
and
was
forever
sundered
from
her
.
Despite
Denisov
's
request
*NL*
that
he
would
take
no
part
in
the
matter
,
Rostov
agreed
to
be
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
second
,
and
after
dinner
he
discussed
the
arrangements
for
the
duel
with
*NL*
Nesvitski
,
Bezukhov
's
second
.
Pierre
went
home
,
but
Rostov
with
Dolokhov
*NL*
and
Denisov
stayed
on
at
the
club
till
late
,
listening
to
the
gypsies
*NL*
and
other
singers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
till
tomorrow
at
Sokolniki
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
as
he
took
leave
*NL*
of
Rostov
in
the
club
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
feel
quite
calm
?
''
Rostov
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
whole
secret
of
dueling
in
two
words
.
*NL*
If
you
are
going
to
fight
a
duel
,
and
you
make
a
will
and
write
*NL*
affectionate
letters
to
your
parents
,
and
if
you
think
you
may
be
*NL*
killed
,
you
are
a
fool
and
are
lost
for
certain
.
But
go
with
the
firm
*NL*
intention
of
killing
your
man
as
quickly
and
surely
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
then
all
will
be
right
,
as
our
bear
huntsman
at
Kostroma
used
to
tell
*NL*
me
.
`
Everyone
fears
a
bear
,
'
he
says
,
`
but
when
you
see
one
your
fear
's
*NL*
all
gone
,
and
your
only
thought
is
not
to
let
him
get
away
!
'
And
that
's
*NL*
how
it
is
with
me
.
A
demain
,
mon
cher
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Till
tomorrow
,
my
dear
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
Pierre
and
Nesvitski
drove
to
the
*NL*
Sokolniki
forest
and
found
Dolokhov
,
Denisov
,
and
Rostov
already
there
.
*NL*
Pierre
had
the
air
of
a
man
preoccupied
with
considerations
which
had
no
*NL*
connection
with
the
matter
in
hand
.
His
haggard
face
was
yellow
.
He
had
*NL*
evidently
not
slept
that
night
.
He
looked
about
distractedly
and
screwed
*NL*
up
his
eyes
as
if
dazzled
by
the
sun
.
He
was
entirely
absorbed
by
two
*NL*
considerations
:
his
wife
's
guilt
,
of
which
after
his
sleepless
night
he
*NL*
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
,
and
the
guiltlessness
of
Dolokhov
,
who
had
*NL*
no
reason
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
him
...
``
I
*NL*
should
perhaps
have
done
the
same
thing
in
his
place
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
``
It
's
even
certain
that
I
should
have
done
the
same
,
then
why
this
duel
,
*NL*
this
murder
?
Either
I
shall
kill
him
,
or
he
will
hit
me
in
the
head
,
or
*NL*
elbow
,
or
knee
.
Ca
n't
I
go
away
from
here
,
run
away
,
bury
myself
*NL*
somewhere
?
''
passed
through
his
mind
.
But
just
at
moments
when
such
*NL*
thoughts
occurred
to
him
,
he
would
ask
in
a
particularly
calm
and
*NL*
absent-minded
way
,
which
inspired
the
respect
of
the
onlookers
,
``
Will
it
*NL*
be
long
?
Are
things
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
was
ready
,
the
sabers
stuck
in
the
snow
to
mark
the
barriers
,
*NL*
and
the
pistols
loaded
,
Nesvitski
went
up
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
be
doing
my
duty
,
Count
,
''
he
said
in
timid
tones
,
``
and
*NL*
should
not
justify
your
confidence
and
the
honor
you
have
done
me
in
*NL*
choosing
me
for
your
second
,
if
at
this
grave
,
this
very
grave
,
moment
I
*NL*
did
not
tell
you
the
whole
truth
.
I
think
there
is
no
sufficient
ground
*NL*
for
this
affair
,
or
for
blood
to
be
shed
over
it
...
You
were
not
right
,
*NL*
not
quite
in
the
right
,
you
were
impetuous
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
it
is
horribly
stupid
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
allow
me
to
express
your
regrets
,
and
I
am
sure
your
opponent
will
*NL*
accept
them
,
''
said
Nesvitski
-LRB-
who
like
the
others
concerned
in
the
*NL*
affair
,
and
like
everyone
in
similar
cases
,
did
not
yet
believe
that
the
*NL*
affair
had
come
to
an
actual
duel
-RRB-
.
``
You
know
,
Count
,
it
is
much
more
*NL*
honorable
to
admit
one
's
mistake
than
to
let
matters
become
irreparable
.
*NL*
There
was
no
insult
on
either
side
.
Allow
me
to
convey
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
What
is
there
to
talk
about
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
It
's
all
the
same
...
*NL*
Is
everything
ready
?
''
he
added
.
``
Only
tell
me
where
to
go
and
where
to
*NL*
shoot
,
''
he
said
with
an
unnaturally
gentle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
pistol
in
his
hand
and
began
asking
about
the
working
of
the
*NL*
trigger
,
as
he
had
not
before
held
a
pistol
in
his
hand
--
a
fact
that
he
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
confess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
like
that
,
I
know
,
I
only
forgot
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
apologies
,
none
whatever
,
''
said
Dolokhov
to
Denisov
-LRB-
who
on
his
side
*NL*
had
been
attempting
a
reconciliation
-RRB-
,
and
he
also
went
up
to
the
*NL*
appointed
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spot
chosen
for
the
duel
was
some
eighty
paces
from
the
road
,
where
*NL*
the
sleighs
had
been
left
,
in
a
small
clearing
in
the
pine
forest
*NL*
covered
with
melting
snow
,
the
frost
having
begun
to
break
up
during
the
*NL*
last
few
days
.
The
antagonists
stood
forty
paces
apart
at
the
farther
*NL*
edge
of
the
clearing
.
The
seconds
,
measuring
the
paces
,
left
tracks
in
*NL*
the
deep
wet
snow
between
the
place
where
they
had
been
standing
and
*NL*
Nesvitski
's
and
Dolokhov
's
sabers
,
which
were
stuck
into
the
ground
ten
*NL*
paces
apart
to
mark
the
barrier
.
It
was
thawing
and
misty
;
at
forty
*NL*
paces
'
distance
nothing
could
be
seen
.
For
three
minutes
all
had
been
*NL*
ready
,
but
they
still
delayed
and
all
were
silent
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
begin
!
''
said
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Pierre
,
still
smiling
in
the
same
way
.
A
feeling
of
*NL*
dread
was
in
the
air
.
It
was
evident
that
the
affair
so
lightly
begun
*NL*
could
no
longer
be
averted
but
was
taking
its
course
independently
of
*NL*
men
's
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
first
went
to
the
barrier
and
announced
:
``
As
the
adve
`
sawies
*NL*
have
wefused
a
weconciliation
,
please
pwoceed
.
Take
your
pistols
,
and
at
*NL*
the
word
thwee
begin
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O-ne
!
T-wo
!
Thwee
!
''
he
shouted
angrily
and
stepped
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
combatants
advanced
along
the
trodden
tracks
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
*NL*
one
another
,
beginning
to
see
one
another
through
the
mist
.
They
had
the
*NL*
right
to
fire
when
they
liked
as
they
approached
the
barrier
.
Dolokhov
*NL*
walked
slowly
without
raising
his
pistol
,
looking
intently
with
his
*NL*
bright
,
sparkling
blue
eyes
into
his
antagonist
's
face
.
His
mouth
wore
*NL*
its
usual
semblance
of
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
can
fire
when
I
like
!
''
said
Pierre
,
and
at
the
word
``
three
,
''
he
*NL*
went
quickly
forward
,
missing
the
trodden
path
and
stepping
into
the
*NL*
deep
snow
.
He
held
the
pistol
in
his
right
hand
at
arm
's
length
,
*NL*
apparently
afraid
of
shooting
himself
with
it
.
His
left
hand
he
held
*NL*
carefully
back
,
because
he
wished
to
support
his
right
hand
with
it
and
*NL*
knew
he
must
not
do
so
.
Having
advanced
six
paces
and
strayed
off
the
*NL*
track
into
the
snow
,
Pierre
looked
down
at
his
feet
,
then
quickly
*NL*
glanced
at
Dolokhov
and
,
bending
his
finger
as
he
had
been
shown
,
fired
.
*NL*
Not
at
all
expecting
so
loud
a
report
,
Pierre
shuddered
at
the
sound
and
*NL*
then
,
smiling
at
his
own
sensations
,
stood
still
.
The
smoke
,
rendered
*NL*
denser
by
the
mist
,
prevented
him
from
seeing
anything
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
but
there
was
no
second
report
as
he
had
expected
.
He
only
heard
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
hurried
steps
,
and
his
figure
came
in
view
through
the
smoke
.
*NL*
He
was
pressing
one
hand
to
his
left
side
,
while
the
other
clutched
his
*NL*
drooping
pistol
.
His
face
was
pale
.
Rostov
ran
toward
him
and
said
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-o-o
!
''
muttered
Dolokhov
through
his
teeth
,
``
no
,
it
's
not
over
.
''
And
*NL*
after
stumbling
a
few
staggering
steps
right
up
to
the
saber
,
he
sank
on
*NL*
the
snow
beside
it
.
His
left
hand
was
bloody
;
he
wiped
it
on
his
coat
*NL*
and
supported
himself
with
it
.
His
frowning
face
was
pallid
and
*NL*
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plea
...
''
began
Dolokhov
,
but
could
not
at
first
pronounce
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
''
he
uttered
with
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
hardly
restraining
his
sobs
,
began
running
toward
Dolokhov
and
*NL*
was
about
to
cross
the
space
between
the
barriers
,
when
Dolokhov
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
your
barrier
!
''
and
Pierre
,
grasping
what
was
meant
,
stopped
by
his
*NL*
saber
.
Only
ten
paces
divided
them
.
Dolokhov
lowered
his
head
to
the
*NL*
snow
,
greedily
bit
at
it
,
again
raised
his
head
,
adjusted
himself
,
drew
*NL*
in
his
legs
and
sat
up
,
seeking
a
firm
center
of
gravity
.
He
sucked
and
*NL*
swallowed
the
cold
snow
,
his
lips
quivered
but
his
eyes
,
still
smiling
,
*NL*
glittered
with
effort
and
exasperation
as
he
mustered
his
remaining
*NL*
strength
.
He
raised
his
pistol
and
aimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sideways
!
Cover
yourself
with
your
pistol
!
''
ejaculated
Nesvitski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cover
yourself
!
''
even
Denisov
cried
to
his
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
with
a
gentle
smile
of
pity
and
remorse
,
his
arms
and
legs
*NL*
helplessly
spread
out
,
stood
with
his
broad
chest
directly
facing
*NL*
Dolokhov
looked
sorrowfully
at
him
.
Denisov
,
Rostov
,
and
Nesvitski
*NL*
closed
their
eyes
.
At
the
same
instant
they
heard
a
report
and
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
angry
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Missed
!
''
shouted
Dolokhov
,
and
he
lay
helplessly
,
face
downwards
on
the
*NL*
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
clutched
his
temples
,
and
turning
round
went
into
the
forest
,
*NL*
trampling
through
the
deep
snow
,
and
muttering
incoherent
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Folly
...
folly
!
Death
...
lies
...
''
he
repeated
,
puckering
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nesvitski
stopped
him
and
took
him
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
and
Denisov
drove
away
with
the
wounded
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
lay
silent
in
the
sleigh
with
closed
eyes
and
did
not
answer
*NL*
a
word
to
the
questions
addressed
to
him
.
But
on
entering
Moscow
he
*NL*
suddenly
came
to
and
,
lifting
his
head
with
an
effort
,
took
Rostov
,
who
*NL*
was
sitting
beside
him
,
by
the
hand
.
Rostov
was
struck
by
the
totally
*NL*
altered
and
unexpectedly
rapturous
and
tender
expression
on
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
How
do
you
feel
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
!
But
it
's
not
that
,
my
friend
-
''
said
Dolokhov
with
a
gasping
voice
.
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
?
In
Moscow
,
I
know
.
I
do
n't
matter
,
but
I
have
killed
her
,
*NL*
killed
...
She
wo
n't
get
over
it
!
She
wo
n't
survive
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
asked
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
!
My
mother
,
my
angel
,
my
adored
angel
mother
,
''
and
Dolokhov
*NL*
pressed
Rostov
's
hand
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
become
a
little
quieter
,
he
explained
to
Rostov
that
he
was
*NL*
living
with
his
mother
,
who
,
if
she
saw
him
dying
,
would
not
survive
it
.
*NL*
He
implored
Rostov
to
go
on
and
prepare
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
went
on
ahead
to
do
what
was
asked
,
and
to
his
great
surprise
*NL*
learned
that
Dolokhov
the
brawler
,
Dolokhov
the
bully
,
lived
in
Moscow
*NL*
with
an
old
mother
and
a
hunchback
sister
,
and
was
the
most
affectionate
*NL*
of
sons
and
brothers
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
of
late
rarely
seen
his
wife
alone
.
Both
in
Petersburg
and
in
*NL*
Moscow
their
house
was
always
full
of
visitors
.
The
night
after
the
duel
*NL*
he
did
not
go
to
his
bedroom
but
,
as
he
often
did
,
remained
in
his
*NL*
father
's
room
,
that
huge
room
in
which
Count
Bezukhov
had
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
down
on
the
sofa
meaning
to
fall
asleep
and
forget
all
that
had
*NL*
happened
to
him
,
but
could
not
do
so
.
Such
a
storm
of
feelings
,
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
memories
suddenly
arose
within
him
that
he
could
not
fall
*NL*
asleep
,
nor
even
remain
in
one
place
,
but
had
to
jump
up
and
pace
the
*NL*
room
with
rapid
steps
.
Now
he
seemed
to
see
her
in
the
early
days
of
*NL*
their
marriage
,
with
bare
shoulders
and
a
languid
,
passionate
look
on
*NL*
her
face
,
and
then
immediately
he
saw
beside
her
Dolokhov
's
handsome
,
*NL*
insolent
,
hard
,
and
mocking
face
as
he
had
seen
it
at
the
banquet
,
and
*NL*
then
that
same
face
pale
,
quivering
,
and
suffering
,
as
it
had
been
when
*NL*
he
reeled
and
sank
on
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
``
I
have
killed
her
lover
,
yes
,
*NL*
killed
my
wife
's
lover
.
Yes
,
that
was
it
!
And
why
?
How
did
I
come
to
do
*NL*
it
?
''
--
``
Because
you
married
her
,
''
answered
an
inner
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
what
was
I
to
blame
?
''
he
asked
.
``
In
marrying
her
without
loving
*NL*
her
;
in
deceiving
yourself
and
her
.
''
And
he
vividly
recalled
that
moment
*NL*
after
supper
at
Prince
Vasili
's
,
when
he
spoke
those
words
he
had
found
*NL*
so
difficult
to
utter
:
``
I
love
you
.
''
``
It
all
comes
from
that
!
Even
then
*NL*
I
felt
it
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
felt
then
that
it
was
not
so
,
that
I
had
no
*NL*
right
to
do
it
.
And
so
it
turns
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
his
honeymoon
and
blushed
at
the
recollection
.
*NL*
Particularly
vivid
,
humiliating
,
and
shameful
was
the
recollection
of
*NL*
how
one
day
soon
after
his
marriage
he
came
out
of
the
bedroom
into
his
*NL*
study
a
little
before
noon
in
his
silk
dressing
gown
and
found
his
head
*NL*
steward
there
,
who
,
bowing
respectfully
,
looked
into
his
face
and
at
his
*NL*
dressing
gown
and
smiled
slightly
,
as
if
expressing
respectful
*NL*
understanding
of
his
employer
's
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
often
I
have
felt
proud
of
her
,
proud
of
her
majestic
beauty
*NL*
and
social
tact
,
''
thought
he
;
``
been
proud
of
my
house
,
in
which
she
*NL*
received
all
Petersburg
,
proud
of
her
unapproachability
and
beauty
.
So
*NL*
this
is
what
I
was
proud
of
!
I
then
thought
that
I
did
not
understand
*NL*
her
.
How
often
when
considering
her
character
I
have
told
myself
that
I
*NL*
was
to
blame
for
not
understanding
her
,
for
not
understanding
that
*NL*
constant
composure
and
complacency
and
lack
of
all
interests
or
desires
,
*NL*
and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
terrible
truth
that
she
is
a
depraved
*NL*
woman
.
Now
I
have
spoken
that
terrible
word
to
myself
all
has
become
*NL*
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anatole
used
to
come
to
borrow
money
from
her
and
used
to
kiss
her
*NL*
naked
shoulders
.
She
did
not
give
him
the
money
,
but
let
herself
be
*NL*
kissed
.
Her
father
in
jest
tried
to
rouse
her
jealousy
,
and
she
replied
*NL*
with
a
calm
smile
that
she
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
be
jealous
:
`
Let
him
*NL*
do
what
he
pleases
,
'
she
used
to
say
of
me
.
One
day
I
asked
her
if
she
*NL*
felt
any
symptoms
of
pregnancy
.
She
laughed
contemptuously
and
said
she
*NL*
was
not
a
fool
to
want
to
have
children
,
and
that
she
was
not
going
to
*NL*
have
any
children
by
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
recalled
the
coarseness
and
bluntness
of
her
thoughts
and
the
*NL*
vulgarity
of
the
expressions
that
were
natural
to
her
,
though
she
had
*NL*
been
brought
up
in
the
most
aristocratic
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
...
Just
you
try
it
on
...
Allez-vous
promener
,
''
*
*NL*
she
used
to
say
.
Often
seeing
the
success
she
had
with
young
and
old
men
*NL*
and
women
Pierre
could
not
understand
why
he
did
not
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
You
clear
out
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
never
loved
her
,
''
said
he
to
himself
;
``
I
knew
she
was
a
depraved
*NL*
woman
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
but
dared
not
admit
it
to
myself
.
And
now
there
's
*NL*
Dolokhov
sitting
in
the
snow
with
a
forced
smile
and
perhaps
dying
,
*NL*
while
meeting
my
remorse
with
some
forced
bravado
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
one
of
those
people
who
,
in
spite
of
an
appearance
of
what
is
*NL*
called
weak
character
,
do
not
seek
a
confidant
in
their
troubles
.
He
*NL*
digested
his
sufferings
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
,
all
her
fault
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
but
what
of
that
?
Why
*NL*
did
I
bind
myself
to
her
?
Why
did
I
say
`
Je
vous
aime
'
*
to
her
,
which
*NL*
was
a
lie
,
and
worse
than
a

I
am
guilty
and
must
endure

what
?
A
*NL*
slur
on
my
name

A
misfortune
for
life
?
Oh
,
that
's
nonsense
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
The
slur
on
my
name
and
honor
--
that
's
all
apart
from
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
I
love
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louis
XVI
was
executed
because
they
said
he
was
dishonorable
and
a
*NL*
criminal
,
''
came
into
Pierre
's
head
,
``
and
from
their
point
of
view
they
*NL*
were
right
,
as
were
those
too
who
canonized
him
and
died
a
martyr
's
*NL*
death
for
his
sake
.
Then
Robespierre
was
beheaded
for
being
a
despot
.
*NL*
Who
is
right
and
who
is
wrong
?
No
one
!
But
if
you
are
alive
--
live
:
*NL*
tomorrow
you
'll
die
as
I
might
have
died
an
hour
ago
.
And
is
it
worth
*NL*
tormenting
oneself
,
when
one
has
only
a
moment
of
life
in
comparison
*NL*
with
eternity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
when
he
imagined
himself
calmed
by
such
reflections
,
*NL*
she
suddenly
came
into
his
mind
as
she
was
at
the
moments
when
he
had
*NL*
most
strongly
expressed
his
insincere
love
for
her
,
and
he
felt
the
*NL*
blood
rush
to
his
heart
and
had
again
to
get
up
and
move
about
and
break
*NL*
and
tear
whatever
came
to
his
hand
.
``
Why
did
I
tell
her
that
`
Je
vous
*NL*
aime
'
?
''
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
.
And
when
he
had
said
it
for
the
*NL*
tenth
time
,
Moliere
's
words
:
``
Mais
que
diable
allait-il
faire
dans
cette
*NL*
galere
?
''
*
occurred
to
him
,
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
But
what
the
devil
was
he
doing
in
that
galley
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
night
he
called
his
valet
and
told
him
to
pack
up
to
go
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
He
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
speak
to
her
now
.
He
*NL*
resolved
to
go
away
next
day
and
leave
a
letter
informing
her
of
his
*NL*
intention
to
part
from
her
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
when
the
valet
came
into
the
room
with
his
coffee
,
Pierre
*NL*
was
lying
asleep
on
the
ottoman
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
up
and
looked
round
for
a
while
with
a
startled
expression
,
*NL*
unable
to
realize
where
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
countess
told
me
to
inquire
whether
your
excellency
was
at
home
,
''
*NL*
said
the
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Pierre
could
decide
what
answer
he
would
send
,
the
countess
*NL*
herself
in
a
white
satin
dressing
gown
embroidered
with
silver
and
with
*NL*
simply
dressed
hair
-LRB-
two
immense
plaits
twice
round
her
lovely
head
like
*NL*
a
coronet
-RRB-
entered
the
room
,
calm
and
majestic
,
except
that
there
was
a
*NL*
wrathful
wrinkle
on
her
rather
prominent
marble
brow
.
With
her
*NL*
imperturbable
calm
she
did
not
begin
to
speak
in
front
of
the
valet
.
She
*NL*
knew
of
the
duel
and
had
come
to
speak
about
it
.
She
waited
till
the
*NL*
valet
had
set
down
the
coffee
things
and
left
the
room
.
Pierre
looked
at
*NL*
her
timidly
over
his
spectacles
,
and
like
a
hare
surrounded
by
hounds
*NL*
who
lays
back
her
ears
and
continues
to
crouch
motionless
before
her
*NL*
enemies
,
he
tried
to
continue
reading
.
But
feeling
this
to
be
senseless
*NL*
and
impossible
,
he
again
glanced
timidly
at
her
.
She
did
not
sit
down
*NL*
but
looked
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
waiting
for
the
valet
to
*NL*
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
's
this
now
?
What
have
you
been
up
to
now
,
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
?
''
she
asked
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
What
have
I.
.
.
?
''
stammered
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
seems
you
're
a
hero
,
eh
?
Come
now
,
what
was
this
duel
about
?
What
*NL*
is
it
meant
to
prove
?
What
?
I
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
turned
over
heavily
on
the
ottoman
and
opened
his
mouth
,
but
*NL*
could
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wo
n't
answer
,
I
'll
tell
you
...
''
Helene
went
on
.
``
You
believe
*NL*
everything
you
're
told
.
You
were
told
...
''
Helene
laughed
,
``
that
Dolokhov
*NL*
was
my
lover
,
''
she
said
in
French
with
her
coarse
plainness
of
speech
,
*NL*
uttering
the
word
amant
as
casually
as
any
other
word
,
``
and
you
believed
*NL*
it
!
Well
,
what
have
you
proved
?
What
does
this
duel
prove
?
That
you
're
a
*NL*
fool
,
que
vous
etes
un
sot
,
but
everybody
knew
that
.
What
will
be
the
*NL*
result
?
That
I
shall
be
the
laughingstock
of
all
Moscow
,
that
everyone
*NL*
will
say
that
you
,
drunk
and
not
knowing
what
you
were
about
,
challenged
*NL*
a
man
you
are
jealous
of
without
cause
.
''
Helene
raised
her
voice
and
*NL*
became
more
and
more
excited
,
``
A
man
who
's
a
better
man
than
you
in
*NL*
every
way
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
Hm
...
!
''
growled
Pierre
,
frowning
without
looking
at
her
,
and
not
*NL*
moving
a
muscle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
could
you
believe
he
was
my
lover
?
Why
?
Because
I
like
his
*NL*
company
?
If
you
were
cleverer
and
more
agreeable
,
I
should
prefer
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
me
...
I
beg
you
,
''
muttered
Pierre
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
speak
?
I
can
speak
as
I
like
,
and
I
tell
you
plainly
*NL*
that
there
are
not
many
wives
with
husbands
such
as
you
who
would
not
*NL*
have
taken
lovers
-LRB-
des
amants
-RRB-
,
but
I
have
not
done
so
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
say
something
,
looked
at
her
with
eyes
whose
strange
*NL*
expression
she
did
not
understand
,
and
lay
down
again
.
He
was
suffering
*NL*
physically
at
that
moment
,
there
was
a
weight
on
his
chest
and
he
could
*NL*
not
breathe
.
He
knew
that
he
must
do
something
to
put
an
end
to
this
*NL*
suffering
,
but
what
he
wanted
to
do
was
too
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
better
separate
,
''
he
muttered
in
a
broken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Separate
?
Very
well
,
but
only
if
you
give
me
a
fortune
,
''
said
Helene
.
*NL*
``
Separate
!
That
's
a
thing
to
frighten
me
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
leaped
up
from
the
sofa
and
rushed
staggering
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
kill
you
!
''
he
shouted
,
and
seizing
the
marble
top
of
a
table
with
*NL*
a
strength
he
had
never
before
felt
,
he
made
a
step
toward
her
*NL*
brandishing
the
slab
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
's
face
became
terrible
,
she
shrieked
and
sprang
aside
.
His
*NL*
father
's
nature
showed
itself
in
Pierre
.
He
felt
the
fascination
and
*NL*
delight
of
frenzy
.
He
flung
down
the
slab
,
broke
it
,
and
swooping
down
*NL*
on
her
with
outstretched
hands
shouted
,
``
Get
out
!
''
in
such
a
terrible
*NL*
voice
that
the
whole
house
heard
it
with
horror
.
God
knows
what
he
would
*NL*
have
done
at
that
moment
had
Helene
not
fled
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
Pierre
gave
his
wife
full
power
to
control
all
his
estates
*NL*
in
Great
Russia
,
which
formed
the
larger
part
of
his
property
,
and
left
*NL*
for
Petersburg
alone
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
had
elapsed
since
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
and
*NL*
the
loss
of
Prince
Andrew
had
reached
Bald
Hills
,
and
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
letters
sent
through
the
embassy
and
all
the
searches
made
,
his
body
had
*NL*
not
been
found
nor
was
he
on
the
list
of
prisoners
.
What
was
worst
of
*NL*
all
for
his
relations
was
the
fact
that
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
*NL*
his
having
been
picked
up
on
the
battlefield
by
the
people
of
the
place
*NL*
and
that
he
might
now
be
lying
,
recovering
or
dying
,
alone
among
*NL*
strangers
and
unable
to
send
news
of
himself
.
The
gazettes
from
which
*NL*
the
old
prince
first
heard
of
the
defeat
at
Austerlitz
stated
,
as
usual
*NL*
very
briefly
and
vaguely
,
that
after
brilliant
engagements
the
Russians
*NL*
had
had
to
retreat
and
had
made
their
withdrawal
in
perfect
order
.
The
*NL*
old
prince
understood
from
this
official
report
that
our
army
had
been
*NL*
defeated
.
A
week
after
the
gazette
report
of
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
*NL*
came
a
letter
from
Kutuzov
informing
the
prince
of
the
fate
that
had
*NL*
befallen
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
son
,
''
wrote
Kutuzov
,
``
fell
before
my
eyes
,
a
standard
in
his
hand
*NL*
and
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
--
he
fell
as
a
hero
,
worthy
of
his
father
*NL*
and
his
fatherland
.
To
the
great
regret
of
myself
and
of
the
whole
army
*NL*
it
is
still
uncertain
whether
he
is
alive
or
not
.
I
comfort
myself
and
*NL*
you
with
the
hope
that
your
son
is
alive
,
for
otherwise
he
would
have
*NL*
been
mentioned
among
the
officers
found
on
the
field
of
battle
,
a
list
*NL*
of
whom
has
been
sent
me
under
flag
of
truce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
receiving
this
news
late
in
the
evening
,
when
he
was
alone
in
his
*NL*
study
,
the
old
prince
went
for
his
walk
as
usual
next
morning
,
but
he
*NL*
was
silent
with
his
steward
,
the
gardener
,
and
the
architect
,
and
though
*NL*
he
looked
very
grim
he
said
nothing
to
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
went
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
he
was
working
at
his
*NL*
lathe
and
,
as
usual
,
did
not
look
round
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Princess
Mary
!
''
he
said
suddenly
in
an
unnatural
voice
,
throwing
*NL*
down
his
chisel
.
-LRB-
The
wheel
continued
to
revolve
by
its
own
impetus
,
and
*NL*
Princess
Mary
long
remembered
the
dying
creak
of
that
wheel
,
which
*NL*
merged
in
her
memory
with
what
followed
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
him
,
saw
his
face
,
and
something
gave
way
within
her
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
grew
dim
.
By
the
expression
of
her
father
's
face
,
not
sad
,
not
*NL*
crushed
,
but
angry
and
working
unnaturally
,
she
saw
that
hanging
over
*NL*
her
and
about
to
crush
her
was
some
terrible
misfortune
,
the
worst
in
*NL*
life
,
one
she
had
not
yet
experienced
,
irreparable
and
incomprehensible
-
*NL*
-
the
death
of
one
she
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
Andrew
!
''
--
said
the
ungraceful
,
awkward
princess
with
such
an
*NL*
indescribable
charm
of
sorrow
and
self-forgetfulness
that
her
father
*NL*
could
not
bear
her
look
but
turned
away
with
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
news
!
He
's
not
among
the
prisoners
nor
among
the
killed
!
Kutuzov
*NL*
writes
...
''
and
he
screamed
as
piercingly
as
if
he
wished
to
drive
the
*NL*
princess
away
by
that
scream
...
``
Killed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
did
not
fall
down
or
faint
.
She
was
already
pale
,
but
on
*NL*
hearing
these
words
her
face
changed
and
something
brightened
in
her
*NL*
beautiful
,
radiant
eyes
.
It
was
as
if
joy
--
a
supreme
joy
apart
from
the
*NL*
joys
and
sorrows
of
this
world
--
overflowed
the
great
grief
within
her
.
*NL*
She
forgot
all
fear
of
her
father
,
went
up
to
him
,
took
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
drawing
him
down
put
her
arm
round
his
thin
,
scraggy
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
she
said
,
``
do
not
turn
away
from
me
,
let
us
weep
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scoundrels
!
Blackguards
!
''
shrieked
the
old
man
,
turning
his
face
away
*NL*
from
her
.
``
Destroying
the
army
,
destroying
the
men
!
And
why
?
Go
,
go
and
*NL*
tell
Lise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
sank
helplessly
into
an
armchair
beside
her
father
and
*NL*
wept
.
She
saw
her
brother
now
as
he
had
been
at
the
moment
when
he
took
*NL*
leave
of
her
and
of
Lise
,
his
look
tender
yet
proud
.
She
saw
him
tender
*NL*
and
amused
as
he
was
when
he
put
on
the
little
icon
.
``
Did
he
believe
?
*NL*
Had
he
repented
of
his
unbelief
?
Was
he
now
there
?
There
in
the
realms
*NL*
of
eternal
peace
and
blessedness
?
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
tell
me
how
it
happened
,
''
she
asked
through
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
Go
!
Killed
in
battle
,
where
the
best
of
Russian
men
and
Russia
's
*NL*
glory
were
led
to
destruction
.
Go
,
Princess
Mary
.
Go
and
tell
Lise
.
I
*NL*
will
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
returned
from
her
father
,
the
little
princess
sat
*NL*
working
and
looked
up
with
that
curious
expression
of
inner
,
happy
calm
*NL*
peculiar
to
pregnant
women
.
It
was
evident
that
her
eyes
did
not
see
*NL*
Princess
Mary
but
were
looking
within
...
into
herself
...
at
something
*NL*
joyful
and
mysterious
taking
place
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
''
she
said
,
moving
away
from
the
embroidery
frame
and
lying
back
,
*NL*
``
give
me
your
hand
.
''
She
took
her
sister-in-law
's
hand
and
held
it
below
*NL*
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
smiling
expectantly
,
her
downy
lip
rose
and
remained
*NL*
lifted
in
childlike
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
knelt
down
before
her
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
's
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
!
Do
you
feel
it
?
I
feel
so
strange
.
And
do
you
know
,
Mary
,
*NL*
I
am
going
to
love
him
very
much
,
''
said
Lise
,
looking
with
bright
and
*NL*
happy
eyes
at
her
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
could
not
lift
her
head
,
she
was
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Mary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
...
only
I
feel
sad
...
sad
about
Andrew
,
''
she
said
,
wiping
away
*NL*
her
tears
on
her
sister-in-law
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
Princess
Mary
began
trying
to
*NL*
prepare
her
sister-in-law
,
and
every
time
began
to
cry
.
Unobservant
as
*NL*
was
the
little
princess
,
these
tears
,
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
agitated
her
.
She
said
nothing
but
looked
about
uneasily
as
*NL*
if
in
search
of
something
.
Before
dinner
the
old
prince
,
of
whom
she
was
*NL*
always
afraid
,
came
into
her
room
with
a
peculiarly
restless
and
malign
*NL*
expression
and
went
out
again
without
saying
a
word
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
then
sat
thinking
for
a
while
with
that
expression
of
*NL*
attention
to
something
within
her
that
is
only
seen
in
pregnant
women
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anything
come
from
Andrew
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
know
it
's
too
soon
for
news
.
But
my
father
is
anxious
and
I
*NL*
feel
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
's
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
answered
Princess
Mary
,
looking
firmly
with
her
radiant
eyes
*NL*
at
her
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
determined
not
to
tell
her
and
persuaded
her
father
to
hide
the
*NL*
terrible
news
from
her
till
after
her
confinement
,
which
was
expected
*NL*
within
a
few
days
.
Princess
Mary
and
the
old
prince
each
bore
and
hid
*NL*
their
grief
in
their
own
way
.
The
old
prince
would
not
cherish
any
hope
:
*NL*
he
made
up
his
mind
that
Prince
Andrew
had
been
killed
,
and
though
he
*NL*
sent
an
official
to
Austria
to
seek
for
traces
of
his
son
,
he
ordered
a
*NL*
monument
from
Moscow
which
he
intended
to
erect
in
his
own
garden
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
and
he
told
everybody
that
his
son
had
been
killed
.
He
tried
not
*NL*
to
change
his
former
way
of
life
,
but
his
strength
failed
him
.
He
walked
*NL*
less
,
ate
less
,
slept
less
,
and
became
weaker
every
day
.
Princess
Mary
*NL*
hoped
.
She
prayed
for
her
brother
as
living
and
was
always
awaiting
news
*NL*
of
his
return
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
''
said
the
little
princess
after
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
*NL*
the
nineteenth
March
,
and
her
downy
little
lip
rose
from
old
habit
,
but
*NL*
as
sorrow
was
manifest
in
every
smile
,
the
sound
of
every
word
,
and
even
*NL*
every
footstep
in
that
house
since
the
terrible
news
had
come
,
so
now
*NL*
the
smile
of
the
little
princess
--
influenced
by
the
general
mood
though
*NL*
without
knowing
its
cause
--
was
such
as
to
remind
one
still
more
of
the
*NL*
general
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
I
'm
afraid
this
morning
's
fruschtique
*
--
as
Foka
the
cook
*NL*
calls
it
--
has
disagreed
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Fruhstuck
:
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
my
darling
?
You
look
pale
.
Oh
,
you
are
*NL*
very
pale
!
''
said
Princess
Mary
in
alarm
,
running
with
her
soft
,
*NL*
ponderous
steps
up
to
her
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
should
not
Mary
Bogdanovna
be
sent
for
?
''
said
one
of
*NL*
the
maids
who
was
present
.
-LRB-
Mary
Bogdanovna
was
a
midwife
from
the
*NL*
neighboring
town
,
who
had
been
at
Bald
Hills
for
the
last
fortnight
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
assented
Princess
Mary
,
``
perhaps
that
's
it
.
I
'll
go
.
Courage
,
*NL*
my
angel
.
''
She
kissed
Lise
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
And
besides
the
pallor
and
the
physical
suffering
on
the
*NL*
little
princess
'
face
,
an
expression
of
childish
fear
of
inevitable
pain
*NL*
showed
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
only
indigestion
?
...
Say
it
's
only
indigestion
,
say
so
,
Mary
!
*NL*
Say
...
''
And
the
little
princess
began
to
cry
capriciously
like
a
*NL*
suffering
child
and
to
wring
her
little
hands
even
with
some
*NL*
affectation
.
Princess
Mary
ran
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
Mary
Bogdanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
Dieu
!
Mon
Dieu
!
Oh
!
''
she
heard
as
she
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
midwife
was
already
on
her
way
to
meet
her
,
rubbing
her
small
,
plump
*NL*
white
hands
with
an
air
of
calm
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
Bogdanovna
,
I
think
it
's
beginning
!
''
said
Princess
Mary
looking
at
*NL*
the
midwife
with
wide-open
eyes
of
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
Lord
be
thanked
,
Princess
,
''
said
Mary
Bogdanovna
,
not
*NL*
hastening
her
steps
.
``
You
young
ladies
should
not
know
anything
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
it
the
doctor
from
Moscow
is
not
here
yet
?
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
.
-LRB-
In
accordance
with
Lise
's
and
Prince
Andrew
's
wishes
they
had
*NL*
sent
in
good
time
to
Moscow
for
a
doctor
and
were
expecting
him
at
any
*NL*
moment
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
Princess
,
do
n't
be
alarmed
,
''
said
Mary
Bogdanovna
.
``
We
'll
*NL*
manage
very
well
without
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
Princess
Mary
from
her
room
heard
something
heavy
*NL*
being
carried
by
.
She
looked
out
.
The
men
servants
were
carrying
the
*NL*
large
leather
sofa
from
Prince
Andrew
's
study
into
the
bedroom
.
On
their
*NL*
faces
was
a
quiet
and
solemn
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
sat
alone
in
her
room
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
*NL*
house
,
now
and
then
opening
her
door
when
someone
passed
and
watching
*NL*
what
was
going
on
in
the
passage
.
Some
women
passing
with
quiet
steps
in
*NL*
and
out
of
the
bedroom
glanced
at
the
princess
and
turned
away
.
She
did
*NL*
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
,
and
shut
the
door
again
,
now
sitting
*NL*
down
in
her
easy
chair
,
now
taking
her
prayer
book
,
now
kneeling
before
*NL*
the
icon
stand
.
To
her
surprise
and
distress
she
found
that
her
prayers
*NL*
did
not
calm
her
excitement
.
Suddenly
her
door
opened
softly
and
her
old
*NL*
nurse
,
Praskovya
Savishna
,
who
hardly
ever
came
to
that
room
as
the
old
*NL*
prince
had
forbidden
it
,
appeared
on
the
threshold
with
a
shawl
round
*NL*
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
sit
with
you
a
bit
,
Masha
,
''
said
the
nurse
,
``
and
here
I
've
*NL*
brought
the
prince
's
wedding
candles
to
light
before
his
saint
,
my
*NL*
angel
,
''
she
said
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nurse
,
I
'm
so
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
is
merciful
,
birdie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
lit
the
gilt
candles
before
the
icons
and
sat
down
by
the
door
*NL*
with
her
knitting
.
Princess
Mary
took
a
book
and
began
reading
.
Only
*NL*
when
footsteps
or
voices
were
heard
did
they
look
at
one
another
,
the
*NL*
princess
anxious
and
inquiring
,
the
nurse
encouraging
.
Everyone
in
the
*NL*
house
was
dominated
by
the
same
feeling
that
Princess
Mary
experienced
*NL*
as
she
sat
in
her
room
.
But
owing
to
the
superstition
that
the
fewer
the
*NL*
people
who
know
of
it
the
less
a
woman
in
travail
suffers
,
everyone
*NL*
tried
to
pretend
not
to
know
;
no
one
spoke
of
it
,
but
apart
from
the
*NL*
ordinary
staid
and
respectful
good
manners
habitual
in
the
prince
's
*NL*
household
,
a
common
anxiety
,
a
softening
of
the
heart
,
and
a
*NL*
consciousness
that
something
great
and
mysterious
was
being
accomplished
*NL*
at
that
moment
made
itself
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
laughter
in
the
maids
'
large
hall
.
In
the
men
servants
'
*NL*
hall
all
sat
waiting
,
silently
and
alert
.
In
the
outlying
serfs
'
*NL*
quarters
torches
and
candles
were
burning
and
no
one
slept
.
The
old
*NL*
prince
,
stepping
on
his
heels
,
paced
up
and
down
his
study
and
sent
*NL*
Tikhon
to
ask
Mary
Bogdanovna
what
news
.
--
``
Say
only
that
`
the
prince
*NL*
told
me
to
ask
,
'
and
come
and
tell
me
her
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inform
the
prince
that
labor
has
begun
,
''
said
Mary
Bogdanovna
,
giving
*NL*
the
messenger
a
significant
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
went
and
told
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
!
''
said
the
prince
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
and
Tikhon
did
*NL*
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
from
the
study
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
he
re-entered
it
as
if
to
snuff
the
candles
,
and
,
seeing
*NL*
the
prince
was
lying
on
the
sofa
,
looked
at
him
,
noticed
his
perturbed
*NL*
face
,
shook
his
head
,
and
going
up
to
him
silently
kissed
him
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
and
left
the
room
without
snuffing
the
candles
or
saying
why
he
*NL*
had
entered
.
The
most
solemn
mystery
in
the
world
continued
its
course
.
*NL*
Evening
passed
,
night
came
,
and
the
feeling
of
suspense
and
softening
of
*NL*
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
unfathomable
did
not
lessen
but
increased
.
*NL*
No
one
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
March
nights
when
winter
seems
to
wish
to
resume
its
*NL*
sway
and
scatters
its
last
snows
and
storms
with
desperate
fury
.
A
relay
*NL*
of
horses
had
been
sent
up
the
highroad
to
meet
the
German
doctor
from
*NL*
Moscow
who
was
expected
every
moment
,
and
men
on
horseback
with
lanterns
*NL*
were
sent
to
the
crossroads
to
guide
him
over
the
country
road
with
its
*NL*
hollows
and
snow-covered
pools
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
had
long
since
put
aside
her
book
:
she
sat
silent
,
her
*NL*
luminous
eyes
fixed
on
her
nurse
's
wrinkled
face
-LRB-
every
line
of
which
*NL*
she
knew
so
well
-RRB-
,
on
the
lock
of
gray
hair
that
escaped
from
under
the
*NL*
kerchief
,
and
the
loose
skin
that
hung
under
her
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nurse
Savishna
,
knitting
in
hand
,
was
telling
in
low
tones
,
scarcely
*NL*
hearing
or
understanding
her
own
words
,
what
she
had
told
hundreds
of
*NL*
times
before
:
how
the
late
princess
had
given
birth
to
Princess
Mary
in
*NL*
Kishenev
with
only
a
Moldavian
peasant
woman
to
help
instead
of
a
*NL*
midwife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
is
merciful
,
doctors
are
never
needed
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
beat
violently
against
the
casement
of
the
*NL*
window
,
from
which
the
double
frame
had
been
removed
-LRB-
by
order
of
the
*NL*
prince
,
one
window
frame
was
removed
in
each
room
as
soon
as
the
larks
*NL*
returned
-RRB-
,
and
,
forcing
open
a
loosely
closed
latch
,
set
the
damask
*NL*
curtain
flapping
and
blew
out
the
candle
with
its
chill
,
snowy
draft
.
*NL*
Princess
Mary
shuddered
;
her
nurse
,
putting
down
the
stocking
she
was
*NL*
knitting
,
went
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
tried
to
catch
the
open
*NL*
casement
.
The
cold
wind
flapped
the
ends
of
her
kerchief
and
her
loose
*NL*
locks
of
gray
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
my
dear
,
there
's
someone
driving
up
the
avenue
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
holding
the
casement
and
not
closing
it
.
``
With
lanterns
.
Most
likely
the
*NL*
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
thank
God
!
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
I
must
go
and
meet
him
,
he
*NL*
does
not
know
Russian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
and
ran
to
meet
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
As
she
was
crossing
the
anteroom
she
saw
through
the
window
a
carriage
*NL*
with
lanterns
,
standing
at
the
entrance
.
She
went
out
on
the
stairs
.
On
*NL*
a
banister
post
stood
a
tallow
candle
which
guttered
in
the
draft
.
On
*NL*
the
landing
below
,
Philip
,
the
footman
,
stood
looking
scared
and
holding
*NL*
another
candle
.
Still
lower
,
beyond
the
turn
of
the
staircase
,
one
could
*NL*
hear
the
footstep
of
someone
in
thick
felt
boots
,
and
a
voice
that
*NL*
seemed
familiar
to
Princess
Mary
was
saying
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
said
the
voice
.
``
And
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
to
bed
,
''
replied
the
voice
of
Demyan
the
house
steward
,
who
was
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
voice
said
something
more
,
Demyan
replied
,
and
the
steps
in
the
*NL*
felt
boots
approached
the
unseen
bend
of
the
staircase
more
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Andrew
!
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
``
No
it
ca
n't
be
,
that
would
be
too
*NL*
extraordinary
,
''
and
at
the
very
moment
she
thought
this
,
the
face
and
*NL*
figure
of
Prince
Andrew
,
in
a
fur
cloak
the
deep
collar
of
which
covered
*NL*
with
snow
,
appeared
on
the
landing
where
the
footman
stood
with
the
*NL*
candle
.
Yes
,
it
was
he
,
pale
,
thin
,
with
a
changed
and
strangely
*NL*
softened
but
agitated
expression
on
his
face
.
He
came
up
the
stairs
and
*NL*
embraced
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
get
my
letter
?
''
he
asked
,
and
not
waiting
for
a
reply
--
*NL*
which
he
would
not
have
received
,
for
the
princess
was
unable
to
speak
--
*NL*
he
turned
back
,
rapidly
mounted
the
stairs
again
with
the
doctor
who
had
*NL*
entered
the
hall
after
him
-LRB-
they
had
met
at
the
last
post
station
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
again
embraced
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strange
fate
,
Masha
darling
!
''
And
having
taken
off
his
cloak
and
*NL*
felt
boots
,
he
went
to
the
little
princess
'
apartment
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
princess
lay
supported
by
pillows
,
with
a
white
cap
on
her
*NL*
head
-LRB-
the
pains
had
just
left
her
-RRB-
.
Strands
of
her
black
hair
lay
round
*NL*
her
inflamed
and
perspiring
cheeks
,
her
charming
rosy
mouth
with
its
*NL*
downy
lip
was
open
and
she
was
smiling
joyfully
.
Prince
Andrew
entered
*NL*
and
paused
facing
her
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying
.
*NL*
Her
glittering
eyes
,
filled
with
childlike
fear
and
excitement
,
rested
*NL*
on
him
without
changing
their
expression
.
``
I
love
you
all
and
have
done
*NL*
no
harm
to
anyone
;
why
must
I
suffer
so
?
Help
me
!
''
her
look
seemed
to
*NL*
say
.
She
saw
her
husband
,
but
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
his
*NL*
appearance
before
her
now
.
Prince
Andrew
went
round
the
sofa
and
kissed
*NL*
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
!
''
he
said
--
a
word
he
had
never
used
to
her
before
.
``
God
is
*NL*
merciful
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
inquiringly
and
with
childlike
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
help
from
you
and
I
get
none
,
none
from
you
either
!
''
said
*NL*
her
eyes
.
She
was
not
surprised
at
his
having
come
;
she
did
not
realize
*NL*
that
he
had
come
.
His
coming
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
sufferings
or
*NL*
with
their
relief
.
The
pangs
began
again
and
Mary
Bogdanovna
advised
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
to
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
entered
.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
and
,
meeting
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
again
joined
her
.
They
began
talking
in
whispers
,
but
their
talk
broke
*NL*
off
at
every
moment
.
They
waited
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
dear
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
again
to
his
wife
and
sat
waiting
in
the
room
next
to
*NL*
hers
.
A
woman
came
from
the
bedroom
with
a
frightened
face
and
became
*NL*
confused
when
she
saw
Prince
Andrew
.
He
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
*NL*
and
remained
so
for
some
minutes
.
Piteous
,
helpless
,
animal
moans
came
*NL*
through
the
door
.
Prince
Andrew
got
up
,
went
to
the
door
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
open
it
.
Someone
was
holding
it
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
come
in
!
You
ca
n't
!
''
said
a
terrified
voice
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
pacing
the
room
.
The
screaming
ceased
,
and
a
few
more
seconds
*NL*
went
by
.
Then
suddenly
a
terrible
shriek
--
it
could
not
be
hers
,
she
*NL*
could
not
scream
like
that
--
came
from
the
bedroom
.
Prince
Andrew
ran
to
*NL*
the
door
;
the
scream
ceased
and
he
heard
the
wail
of
an
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
they
taken
a
baby
in
there
for
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
in
the
*NL*
first
second
.
``
A
baby
?
What
baby
...
?
Why
is
there
a
baby
there
?
Or
is
*NL*
the
baby
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
he
realized
the
joyful
significance
of
that
wail
;
tears
*NL*
choked
him
,
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
window
sill
be
began
to
cry
,
*NL*
sobbing
like
a
child
.
The
door
opened
.
The
doctor
with
his
shirt
sleeves
*NL*
tucked
up
,
without
a
coat
,
pale
and
with
a
trembling
jaw
,
came
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
Prince
Andrew
turned
to
him
,
but
the
doctor
gave
him
a
*NL*
bewildered
look
and
passed
by
without
a
word
.
A
woman
rushed
out
and
*NL*
seeing
Prince
Andrew
stopped
,
hesitating
on
the
threshold
.
He
went
into
*NL*
his
wife
's
room
.
She
was
lying
dead
,
in
the
same
position
he
had
seen
*NL*
her
in
five
minutes
before
and
,
despite
the
fixed
eyes
and
the
pallor
of
*NL*
the
cheeks
,
the
same
expression
was
on
her
charming
childlike
face
with
*NL*
its
upper
lip
covered
with
tiny
black
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
all
,
and
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone
;
and
what
have
you
done
*NL*
to
me
?
''
--
said
her
charming
,
pathetic
,
dead
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
corner
of
the
room
something
red
and
tiny
gave
a
grunt
and
squealed
*NL*
in
Mary
Bogdanovna
's
trembling
white
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
later
Prince
Andrew
,
stepping
softly
,
went
into
his
father
's
*NL*
room
.
The
old
man
already
knew
everything
.
He
was
standing
close
to
the
*NL*
door
and
as
soon
as
it
opened
his
rough
old
arms
closed
like
a
vise
*NL*
round
his
son
's
neck
,
and
without
a
word
he
began
to
sob
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
the
little
princess
was
buried
,
and
Prince
Andrew
went
*NL*
up
the
steps
to
where
the
coffin
stood
,
to
give
her
the
farewell
kiss
.
*NL*
And
there
in
the
coffin
was
the
same
face
,
though
with
closed
eyes
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
what
have
you
done
to
me
?
''
it
still
seemed
to
say
,
and
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
felt
that
something
gave
way
in
his
soul
and
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sin
*NL*
he
could
neither
remedy
nor
forget
.
He
could
not
weep
.
The
old
man
too
*NL*
came
up
and
kissed
the
waxen
little
hands
that
lay
quietly
crossed
one
*NL*
on
the
other
on
her
breast
,
and
to
him
,
too
,
her
face
seemed
to
say
:
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
have
you
done
to
me
,
and
why
?
''
And
at
the
sight
the
old
man
*NL*
turned
angrily
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
five
days
passed
,
and
then
the
young
Prince
Nicholas
Andreevich
*NL*
was
baptized
.
The
wet
nurse
supported
the
coverlet
with
her
chin
,
while
*NL*
the
priest
with
a
goose
feather
anointed
the
boy
's
little
red
and
*NL*
wrinkled
soles
and
palms
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
grandfather
,
who
was
his
godfather
,
trembling
and
afraid
of
dropping
*NL*
him
,
carried
the
infant
round
the
battered
tin
font
and
handed
him
over
*NL*
to
the
godmother
,
Princess
Mary
.
Prince
Andrew
sat
in
another
room
,
*NL*
faint
with
fear
lest
the
baby
should
be
drowned
in
the
font
,
and
awaited
*NL*
the
termination
of
the
ceremony
.
He
looked
up
joyfully
at
the
baby
when
*NL*
the
nurse
brought
it
to
him
and
nodded
approval
when
she
told
him
that
*NL*
the
wax
with
the
baby
's
hair
had
not
sunk
in
the
font
but
had
floated
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
's
share
in
Dolokhov
's
duel
with
Bezukhov
was
hushed
up
by
the
*NL*
efforts
of
the
old
count
,
and
instead
of
being
degraded
to
the
ranks
as
*NL*
he
expected
he
was
appointed
an
adjutant
to
the
governor
general
of
*NL*
Moscow
.
As
a
result
he
could
not
go
to
the
country
with
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
,
but
was
kept
all
summer
in
Moscow
by
his
new
duties
.
Dolokhov
*NL*
recovered
,
and
Rostov
became
very
friendly
with
him
during
his
*NL*
convalescence
.
Dolokhov
lay
ill
at
his
mother
's
who
loved
him
*NL*
passionately
and
tenderly
,
and
old
Mary
Ivanovna
,
who
had
grown
fond
of
*NL*
Rostov
for
his
friendship
to
her
Fedya
,
often
talked
to
him
about
her
*NL*
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Count
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
he
is
too
noble
and
pure-souled
for
our
*NL*
present
,
depraved
world
.
No
one
now
loves
virtue
;
it
seems
like
a
*NL*
reproach
to
everyone
.
Now
tell
me
,
Count
,
was
it
right
,
was
it
*NL*
honorable
,
of
Bezukhov
?
And
Fedya
,
with
his
noble
spirit
,
loved
him
and
*NL*
even
now
never
says
a
word
against
him
.
Those
pranks
in
Petersburg
when
*NL*
they
played
some
tricks
on
a
policeman
,
did
n't
they
do
it
together
?
And
*NL*
there
!
Bezukhov
got
off
scotfree
,
while
Fedya
had
to
bear
the
whole
*NL*
burden
on
his
shoulders
.
Fancy
what
he
had
to
go
through
!
It
's
true
he
*NL*
has
been
reinstated
,
but
how
could
they
fail
to
do
that
?
I
think
there
*NL*
were
not
many
such
gallant
sons
of
the
fatherland
out
there
as
he
.
And
*NL*
now
--
this
duel
!
Have
these
people
no
feeling
,
or
honor
?
Knowing
him
to
*NL*
be
an
only
son
,
to
challenge
him
and
shoot
so
straight
!
It
's
well
God
*NL*
had
mercy
on
us
.
And
what
was
it
for
?
Who
does
n't
have
intrigues
*NL*
nowadays
?
Why
,
if
he
was
so
jealous
,
as
I
see
things
he
should
have
*NL*
shown
it
sooner
,
but
he
lets
it
go
on
for
months
.
And
then
to
call
him
*NL*
out
,
reckoning
on
Fedya
not
fighting
because
he
owed
him
money
!
What
*NL*
baseness
!
What
meanness
!
I
know
you
understand
Fedya
,
my
dear
count
;
*NL*
that
,
believe
me
,
is
why
I
am
so
fond
of
you
.
Few
people
do
understand
*NL*
him
.
He
is
such
a
lofty
,
heavenly
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
himself
during
his
convalescence
spoke
to
Rostov
in
a
way
no
*NL*
one
would
have
expected
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
people
consider
me
a
bad
man
!
''
he
said
.
``
Let
them
!
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
a
straw
about
anyone
but
those
I
love
;
but
those
I
love
,
I
love
so
that
*NL*
I
would
give
my
life
for
them
,
and
the
others
I
'd
throttle
if
they
stood
*NL*
in
my
way
.
I
have
an
adored
,
a
priceless
mother
,
and
two
or
three
*NL*
friends
--
you
among
them
--
and
as
for
the
rest
I
only
care
about
them
in
*NL*
so
far
as
they
are
harmful
or
useful
.
And
most
of
them
are
harmful
,
*NL*
especially
the
women
.
Yes
,
dear
boy
,
''
he
continued
,
``
I
have
met
loving
,
*NL*
noble
,
high-minded
men
,
but
I
have
not
yet
met
any
women
--
countesses
or
*NL*
cooks
--
who
were
not
venal
.
I
have
not
yet
met
that
divine
purity
and
*NL*
devotion
I
look
for
in
women
.
If
I
found
such
a
one
I
'd
give
my
life
for
*NL*
her
!
But
those
!
...
''
and
he
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
.
``
And
believe
me
,
*NL*
if
I
still
value
my
life
it
is
only
because
I
still
hope
to
meet
such
a
*NL*
divine
creature
,
who
will
regenerate
,
purify
,
and
elevate
me
.
But
you
*NL*
do
n't
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
quite
understand
,
''
answered
Rostov
,
who
was
under
his
new
*NL*
friend
's
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
autumn
the
Rostovs
returned
to
Moscow
.
Early
in
the
winter
*NL*
Denisov
also
came
back
and
stayed
with
them
.
The
first
half
of
the
*NL*
winter
of
1806
,
which
Nicholas
Rostov
spent
in
Moscow
,
was
one
of
the
*NL*
happiest
,
merriest
times
for
him
and
the
whole
family
.
Nicholas
brought
*NL*
many
young
men
to
his
parents
'
house
.
Vera
was
a
handsome
girl
of
*NL*
twenty
;
Sonya
a
girl
of
sixteen
with
all
the
charm
of
an
opening
flower
;
*NL*
Natasha
,
half
grown
up
and
half
child
,
was
now
childishly
amusing
,
now
*NL*
girlishly
enchanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
in
the
Rostovs
'
house
there
prevailed
an
amorous
atmosphere
*NL*
characteristic
of
homes
where
there
are
very
young
and
very
charming
*NL*
girls
.
Every
young
man
who
came
to
the
house
--
seeing
those
*NL*
impressionable
,
smiling
young
faces
-LRB-
smiling
probably
at
their
own
*NL*
happiness
-RRB-
,
feeling
the
eager
bustle
around
him
,
and
hearing
the
fitful
*NL*
bursts
of
song
and
music
and
the
inconsequent
but
friendly
prattle
of
*NL*
young
girls
ready
for
anything
and
full
of
hope
--
experienced
the
same
*NL*
feeling
;
sharing
with
the
young
folk
of
the
Rostovs
'
household
a
*NL*
readiness
to
fall
in
love
and
an
expectation
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
young
men
introduced
by
Rostov
one
of
the
first
was
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
whom
everyone
in
the
house
liked
except
Natasha
.
She
almost
quarreled
*NL*
with
her
brother
about
him
.
She
insisted
that
he
was
a
bad
man
,
and
that
*NL*
in
the
duel
with
Bezukhov
,
Pierre
was
right
and
Dolokhov
wrong
,
and
*NL*
further
that
he
was
disagreeable
and
unnatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
for
me
to
understand
,
''
she
cried
out
with
resolute
*NL*
self-will
,
``
he
is
wicked
and
heartless
.
There
now
,
I
like
your
Denisov
*NL*
though
he
is
a
rake
and
all
that
,
still
I
like
him
;
so
you
see
I
do
*NL*
understand
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
put
it
...
with
this
one
everything
is
*NL*
calculated
,
and
I
do
n't
like
that
.
But
Denisov
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Denisov
is
quite
different
,
''
replied
Nicholas
,
implying
that
even
*NL*
Denisov
was
nothing
compared
to
Dolokhov
--
``
you
must
understand
what
a
*NL*
soul
there
is
in
Dolokhov
,
you
should
see
him
with
his
mother
.
What
a
*NL*
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
but
I
am
uncomfortable
with
him
.
And
do
*NL*
you
know
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
Sonya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
certain
of
it
;
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
prediction
proved
true
.
Dolokhov
,
who
did
not
usually
care
for
*NL*
the
society
of
ladies
,
began
to
come
often
to
the
house
,
and
the
*NL*
question
for
whose
sake
he
came
-LRB-
though
no
one
spoke
of
it
-RRB-
was
soon
*NL*
settled
.
He
came
because
of
Sonya
.
And
Sonya
,
though
she
would
never
*NL*
have
dared
to
say
so
,
knew
it
and
blushed
scarlet
every
time
Dolokhov
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
often
dined
at
the
Rostovs
'
,
never
missed
a
performance
at
*NL*
which
they
were
present
,
and
went
to
Iogel
's
balls
for
young
people
*NL*
which
the
Rostovs
always
attended
.
He
was
pointedly
attentive
to
Sonya
*NL*
and
looked
at
her
in
such
a
way
that
not
only
could
she
not
bear
his
*NL*
glances
without
coloring
,
but
even
the
old
countess
and
Natasha
blushed
*NL*
when
they
saw
his
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
this
strange
,
strong
man
was
under
the
irresistible
*NL*
influence
of
the
dark
,
graceful
girl
who
loved
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
noticed
something
new
in
Dolokhov
's
relations
with
Sonya
,
but
he
*NL*
did
not
explain
to
himself
what
these
new
relations
were
.
``
They
're
*NL*
always
in
love
with
someone
,
''
he
thought
of
Sonya
and
Natasha
.
But
he
*NL*
was
not
as
much
at
ease
with
Sonya
and
Dolokhov
as
before
and
was
less
*NL*
frequently
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
autumn
of
1806
everybody
had
again
begun
talking
of
the
war
with
*NL*
Napoleon
with
even
greater
warmth
than
the
year
before
.
Orders
were
*NL*
given
to
raise
recruits
,
ten
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
regular
army
,
*NL*
and
besides
this
,
nine
men
in
every
thousand
for
the
militia
.
Everywhere
*NL*
Bonaparte
was
anathematized
and
in
Moscow
nothing
but
the
coming
war
was
*NL*
talked
of
.
For
the
Rostov
family
the
whole
interest
of
these
*NL*
preparations
for
war
lay
in
the
fact
that
Nicholas
would
not
hear
of
*NL*
remaining
in
Moscow
,
and
only
awaited
the
termination
of
Denisov
's
*NL*
furlough
after
Christmas
to
return
with
him
to
their
regiment
.
His
*NL*
approaching
departure
did
not
prevent
his
amusing
himself
,
but
rather
*NL*
gave
zest
to
his
pleasures
.
He
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
away
*NL*
from
home
,
at
dinners
,
parties
,
and
balls
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
after
Christmas
Nicholas
dined
at
home
,
a
thing
he
had
*NL*
rarely
done
of
late
.
It
was
a
grand
farewell
dinner
,
as
he
and
Denisov
*NL*
were
leaving
to
join
their
regiment
after
Epiphany
.
About
twenty
people
*NL*
were
present
,
including
Dolokhov
and
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
love
been
so
much
in
the
air
,
and
never
had
the
amorous
*NL*
atmosphere
made
itself
so
strongly
felt
in
the
Rostovs
'
house
as
at
this
*NL*
holiday
time
.
``
Seize
the
moments
of
happiness
,
love
and
be
loved
!
That
*NL*
is
the
only
reality
in
the
world
,
all
else
is
folly
.
It
is
the
one
thing
*NL*
we
are
interested
in
here
,
''
said
the
spirit
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
having
as
usual
exhausted
two
pairs
of
horses
,
without
*NL*
visiting
all
the
places
he
meant
to
go
to
and
where
he
had
been
invited
,
*NL*
returned
home
just
before
dinner
.
As
soon
as
he
entered
he
noticed
and
*NL*
felt
the
tension
of
the
amorous
air
in
the
house
,
and
also
noticed
a
*NL*
curious
embarrassment
among
some
of
those
present
.
Sonya
,
Dolokhov
,
and
*NL*
the
old
countess
were
especially
disturbed
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
*NL*
Natasha
.
Nicholas
understood
that
something
must
have
happened
between
*NL*
Sonya
and
Dolokhov
before
dinner
,
and
with
the
kindly
sensitiveness
*NL*
natural
to
him
was
very
gentle
and
wary
with
them
both
at
dinner
.
On
*NL*
that
same
evening
there
was
to
be
one
of
the
balls
that
Iogel
-LRB-
the
*NL*
dancing
master
-RRB-
gave
for
his
pupils
during
the
holidays
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
will
you
come
to
Iogel
's
?
Please
do
!
''
said
Natasha
.
``
He
asked
*NL*
you
,
and
Vasili
Dmitrich
*
is
also
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
would
I
not
go
at
the
countess
'
command
!
''
said
Denisov
,
who
at
*NL*
the
Rostovs
'
had
jocularly
assumed
the
role
of
Natasha
's
knight
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
even
weady
to
dance
the
pas
de
chale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
time
,
''
answered
Nicholas
.
``
But
I
promised
the
Arkharovs
;
they
*NL*
have
a
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
he
asked
Dolokhov
,
but
as
soon
as
he
had
asked
the
question
*NL*
he
noticed
that
it
should
not
have
been
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
coldly
and
angrily
replied
Dolokhov
,
glancing
at
Sonya
,
and
,
*NL*
scowling
,
he
gave
Nicholas
just
such
a
look
as
he
had
given
Pierre
at
*NL*
the
club
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
up
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
and
he
was
further
confirmed
*NL*
in
this
conclusion
by
the
fact
that
Dolokhov
left
immediately
after
*NL*
dinner
.
He
called
Natasha
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
was
looking
for
you
,
''
said
Natasha
running
out
to
him
.
``
I
told
*NL*
you
,
but
you
would
not
believe
it
,
''
she
said
triumphantly
.
``
He
has
*NL*
proposed
to
Sonya
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
as
Nicholas
had
occupied
himself
with
Sonya
of
late
,
something
*NL*
seemed
to
give
way
within
him
at
this
news
.
Dolokhov
was
a
suitable
and
*NL*
in
some
respects
a
brilliant
match
for
the
dowerless
,
orphan
girl
.
From
*NL*
the
point
of
view
of
the
old
countess
and
of
society
it
was
out
of
the
*NL*
question
for
her
to
refuse
him
.
And
therefore
Nicholas
'
first
feeling
on
*NL*
hearing
the
news
was
one
of
anger
with
Sonya
...
He
tried
to
say
,
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
;
of
course
she
'll
forget
her
childish
promises
and
*NL*
accept
the
offer
,
''
but
before
he
had
time
to
say
it
Natasha
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fancy
!
she
refused
him
quite
definitely
!
''
adding
,
after
a
pause
,
*NL*
``
she
told
him
she
loved
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Sonya
could
not
have
done
otherwise
!
''
thought
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
as
Mamma
pressed
her
,
she
refused
,
and
I
know
she
wo
n't
change
*NL*
once
she
has
said
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mamma
pressed
her
!
''
said
Nicholas
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Do
you
know
,
Nicholas
--
do
n't
be
angry
--
but
I
know
*NL*
you
will
not
marry
her
.
I
know
,
heaven
knows
how
,
but
I
know
for
certain
*NL*
that
you
wo
n't
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
do
n't
know
that
at
all
!
''
said
Nicholas
.
``
But
I
must
talk
to
*NL*
her
.
What
a
darling
Sonya
is
!
''
he
added
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
is
indeed
a
darling
!
I
'll
send
her
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Natasha
kissed
her
brother
and
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
Sonya
came
in
with
a
frightened
,
guilty
,
and
scared
look
.
*NL*
Nicholas
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
hand
.
This
was
the
first
time
*NL*
since
his
return
that
they
had
talked
alone
and
about
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sophie
,
''
he
began
,
timidly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
boldly
,
``
if
*NL*
you
wish
to
refuse
one
who
is
not
only
a
brilliant
and
advantageous
*NL*
match
but
a
splendid
,
noble
fellow
...
he
is
my
friend
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
refused
,
''
she
said
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
refusing
for
my
sake
,
I
am
afraid
that
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
again
interrupted
.
She
gave
him
an
imploring
,
frightened
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
do
n't
tell
me
that
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
must
.
It
may
be
arrogant
of
me
,
but
still
it
is
best
to
say
*NL*
it
.
If
you
refuse
him
on
my
account
,
I
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth
.
I
*NL*
love
you
,
and
I
think
I
love
you
more
than
anyone
else
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
enough
for
me
,
''
said
Sonya
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
have
been
in
love
a
thousand
times
and
shall
fall
in
love
*NL*
again
,
though
for
no
one
have
I
such
a
feeling
of
friendship
,
*NL*
confidence
,
and
love
as
I
have
for
you
.
Then
I
am
young
.
Mamma
does
not
*NL*
wish
it
.
In
a
word
,
I
make
no
promise
.
And
I
beg
you
to
consider
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
offer
,
''
he
said
,
articulating
his
friend
's
name
with
*NL*
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
to
me
!
I
want
nothing
.
I
love
you
as
a
brother
and
*NL*
always
shall
,
and
I
want
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
angel
:
I
am
not
worthy
of
you
,
but
I
am
afraid
of
misleading
*NL*
you

*NL*
*NL*
And
Nicholas
again
kissed
her
hand
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Iogel
's
were
the
most
enjoyable
balls
in
Moscow
.
So
said
the
mothers
as
*NL*
they
watched
their
young
people
executing
their
newly
learned
steps
,
and
*NL*
so
said
the
youths
and
maidens
themselves
as
they
danced
till
they
were
*NL*
ready
to
drop
,
and
so
said
the
grown-up
young
men
and
women
who
came
to
*NL*
these
balls
with
an
air
of
condescension
and
found
them
most
enjoyable
.
*NL*
That
year
two
marriages
had
come
of
these
balls
.
The
two
pretty
young
*NL*
Princesses
Gorchakov
met
suitors
there
and
were
married
and
so
further
*NL*
increased
the
fame
of
these
dances
.
What
distinguished
them
from
others
*NL*
was
the
absence
of
host
or
hostess
and
the
presence
of
the
good-natured
*NL*
Iogel
,
flying
about
like
a
feather
and
bowing
according
to
the
rules
of
*NL*
his
art
,
as
he
collected
the
tickets
from
all
his
visitors
.
There
was
*NL*
the
fact
that
only
those
came
who
wished
to
dance
and
amuse
themselves
*NL*
as
girls
of
thirteen
and
fourteen
do
who
are
wearing
long
dresses
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
With
scarcely
any
exceptions
they
all
were
,
or
seemed
to
*NL*
be
,
pretty
--
so
rapturous
were
their
smiles
and
so
sparkling
their
eyes
.
*NL*
Sometimes
the
best
of
the
pupils
,
of
whom
Natasha
,
who
was
exceptionally
*NL*
graceful
,
was
first
,
even
danced
the
pas
de
chale
,
but
at
this
last
ball
*NL*
only
the
ecossaise
,
the
anglaise
,
and
the
mazurka
,
which
was
just
coming
*NL*
into
fashion
,
were
danced
.
Iogel
had
taken
a
ballroom
in
Bezukhov
's
*NL*
house
,
and
the
ball
,
as
everyone
said
,
was
a
great
success
.
There
were
*NL*
many
pretty
girls
and
the
Rostov
girls
were
among
the
prettiest
.
They
*NL*
were
both
particularly
happy
and
gay
.
That
evening
,
proud
of
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
proposal
,
her
refusal
,
and
her
explanation
with
Nicholas
,
Sonya
twirled
*NL*
about
before
she
left
home
so
that
the
maid
could
hardly
get
her
hair
*NL*
plaited
,
and
she
was
transparently
radiant
with
impulsive
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
no
less
proud
of
her
first
long
dress
and
of
being
at
a
real
*NL*
ball
was
even
happier
.
They
were
both
dressed
in
white
muslin
with
pink
*NL*
ribbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
fell
in
love
the
very
moment
she
entered
the
ballroom
.
She
was
*NL*
not
in
love
with
anyone
in
particular
,
but
with
everyone
.
Whatever
*NL*
person
she
happened
to
look
at
she
was
in
love
with
for
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
delightful
it
is
!
''
she
kept
saying
,
running
up
to
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
and
Denisov
were
walking
up
and
down
,
looking
with
kindly
*NL*
patronage
at
the
dancers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sweet
she
is
--
she
will
be
a
weal
beauty
!
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
Natasha
,
''
answered
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
she
dances
!
What
gwace
!
''
he
said
again
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
your
sister
,
''
ejaculated
Denisov
testily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
count
,
you
were
one
of
my
best
pupils
--
you
must
dance
,
''
said
*NL*
little
Iogel
coming
up
to
Nicholas
.
``
Look
how
many
charming
young
*NL*
ladies
-
''
He
turned
with
the
same
request
to
Denisov
who
was
also
a
*NL*
former
pupil
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
'll
be
a
wallflower
,
''
said
Denisov
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
wecollect
what
bad
use
I
made
of
your
lessons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
said
Iogel
,
hastening
to
reassure
him
.
``
You
were
only
*NL*
inattentive
,
but
you
had
talent
--
oh
yes
,
you
had
talent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
band
struck
up
the
newly
introduced
mazurka
.
Nicholas
could
not
*NL*
refuse
Iogel
and
asked
Sonya
to
dance
.
Denisov
sat
down
by
the
old
*NL*
ladies
and
,
leaning
on
his
saber
and
beating
time
with
his
foot
,
told
*NL*
them
something
funny
and
kept
them
amused
,
while
he
watched
the
young
*NL*
people
dancing
,
Iogel
with
Natasha
,
his
pride
and
his
best
pupil
,
were
*NL*
the
first
couple
.
Noiselessly
,
skillfully
stepping
with
his
little
feet
*NL*
in
low
shoes
,
Iogel
flew
first
across
the
hall
with
Natasha
,
who
,
though
*NL*
shy
,
went
on
carefully
executing
her
steps
.
Denisov
did
not
take
his
*NL*
eyes
off
her
and
beat
time
with
his
saber
in
a
way
that
clearly
*NL*
indicated
that
if
he
was
not
dancing
it
was
because
he
would
not
and
not
*NL*
because
he
could
not
.
In
the
middle
of
a
figure
he
beckoned
to
Rostov
*NL*
who
was
passing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
at
all
the
thing
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
sort
of
Polish
mazuwka
is
*NL*
this
?
But
she
does
dance
splendidly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
that
Denisov
had
a
reputation
even
in
Poland
for
the
masterly
*NL*
way
in
which
he
danced
the
mazurka
,
Nicholas
ran
up
to
Natasha
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
choose
Denisov
.
He
is
a
real
dancer
,
a
wonder
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
came
to
Natasha
's
turn
to
choose
a
partner
,
she
rose
and
,
*NL*
tripping
rapidly
across
in
her
little
shoes
trimmed
with
bows
,
ran
*NL*
timidly
to
the
corner
where
Denisov
sat
.
She
saw
that
everybody
was
*NL*
looking
at
her
and
waiting
.
Nicholas
saw
that
Denisov
was
refusing
*NL*
though
he
smiled
delightedly
.
He
ran
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Vasili
Dmitrich
,
''
Natasha
was
saying
,
``
do
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
let
me
off
,
Countess
,
''
Denisov
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
Vaska
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
coax
me
as
if
I
were
Vaska
the
cat
!
''
said
Denisov
jokingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
sing
for
you
a
whole
evening
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
faiwy
!
She
can
do
anything
with
me
!
''
said
Denisov
,
and
he
*NL*
unhooked
his
saber
.
He
came
out
from
behind
the
chairs
,
clasped
his
*NL*
partner
's
hand
firmly
,
threw
back
his
head
,
and
advanced
his
foot
,
*NL*
waiting
for
the
beat
.
Only
on
horse
back
and
in
the
mazurka
was
*NL*
Denisov
's
short
stature
not
noticeable
and
he
looked
the
fine
fellow
he
*NL*
felt
himself
to
be
.
At
the
right
beat
of
the
music
he
looked
sideways
at
*NL*
his
partner
with
a
merry
and
triumphant
air
,
suddenly
stamped
with
one
*NL*
foot
,
bounded
from
the
floor
like
a
ball
,
and
flew
round
the
room
taking
*NL*
his
partner
with
him
.
He
glided
silently
on
one
foot
half
across
the
*NL*
room
,
and
seeming
not
to
notice
the
chairs
was
dashing
straight
at
them
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
,
clinking
his
spurs
and
spreading
out
his
legs
,
he
stopped
*NL*
short
on
his
heels
,
stood
so
a
second
,
stamped
on
the
spot
clanking
his
*NL*
spurs
,
whirled
rapidly
round
,
and
,
striking
his
left
heel
against
his
*NL*
right
,
flew
round
again
in
a
circle
.
Natasha
guessed
what
he
meant
to
*NL*
do
,
and
abandoning
herself
to
him
followed
his
lead
hardly
knowing
how
.
*NL*
First
he
spun
her
round
,
holding
her
now
with
his
left
,
now
with
his
*NL*
right
hand
,
then
falling
on
one
knee
he
twirled
her
round
him
,
and
again
*NL*
jumping
up
,
dashed
so
impetuously
forward
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
*NL*
rush
through
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
without
drawing
breath
,
and
then
*NL*
he
suddenly
stopped
and
performed
some
new
and
unexpected
steps
.
When
at
*NL*
last
,
smartly
whirling
his
partner
round
in
front
of
her
chair
,
he
drew
*NL*
up
with
a
click
of
his
spurs
and
bowed
to
her
,
Natasha
did
not
even
make
*NL*
him
a
curtsy
.
She
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
in
amazement
,
smiling
as
if
she
*NL*
did
not
recognize
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
she
brought
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Iogel
did
not
acknowledge
this
to
be
the
real
mazurka
,
everyone
*NL*
was
delighted
with
Denisov
's
skill
,
he
was
asked
again
and
again
as
a
*NL*
partner
,
and
the
old
men
began
smilingly
to
talk
about
Poland
and
the
*NL*
good
old
days
.
Denisov
,
flushed
after
the
mazurka
and
mopping
himself
*NL*
with
his
handkerchief
,
sat
down
by
Natasha
and
did
not
leave
her
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
evening
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
days
after
that
Rostov
did
not
see
Dolokhov
at
his
own
or
at
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
home
:
on
the
third
day
he
received
a
note
from
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
do
not
intend
to
be
at
your
house
again
for
reasons
you
know
of
,
*NL*
and
am
going
to
rejoin
my
regiment
,
I
am
giving
a
farewell
supper
*NL*
tonight
to
my
friends
--
come
to
the
English
Hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
ten
o'clock
Rostov
went
to
the
English
Hotel
straight
from
the
*NL*
theater
,
where
he
had
been
with
his
family
and
Denisov
.
He
was
at
once
*NL*
shown
to
the
best
room
,
which
Dolokhov
had
taken
for
that
evening
.
Some
*NL*
twenty
men
were
gathered
round
a
table
at
which
Dolokhov
sat
between
two
*NL*
candles
.
On
the
table
was
a
pile
of
gold
and
paper
money
,
and
he
was
*NL*
keeping
the
bank
.
Rostov
had
not
seen
him
since
his
proposal
and
Sonya
's
*NL*
refusal
and
felt
uncomfortable
at
the
thought
of
how
they
would
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
clear
,
cold
glance
met
Rostov
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
door
,
*NL*
as
though
he
had
long
expected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
time
since
we
met
,
''
he
said
.
``
Thanks
for
coming
.
I
'll
just
*NL*
finish
dealing
,
and
then
Ilyushka
will
come
with
his
chorus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
once
or
twice
at
your
house
,
''
said
Rostov
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
punt
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
recalled
at
that
moment
a
strange
conversation
he
had
once
had
*NL*
with
Dolokhov
.
``
None
but
fools
trust
to
luck
in
play
,
''
Dolokhov
had
then
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
are
you
afraid
to
play
with
me
?
''
Dolokhov
now
asked
as
if
guessing
*NL*
Rostov
's
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
his
smile
Rostov
saw
in
him
the
mood
he
had
shown
at
the
club
*NL*
dinner
and
at
other
times
,
when
as
if
tired
of
everyday
life
he
had
felt
*NL*
a
need
to
escape
from
it
by
some
strange
,
and
usually
cruel
,
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
felt
ill
at
ease
.
He
tried
,
but
failed
,
to
find
some
joke
with
*NL*
which
to
reply
to
Dolokhov
's
words
.
But
before
he
had
thought
of
*NL*
anything
,
Dolokhov
,
looking
straight
in
his
face
,
said
slowly
and
*NL*
deliberately
so
that
everyone
could
hear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
we
had
a
talk
about
cards
...
`
He
's
a
fool
who
trusts
to
*NL*
luck
,
one
should
make
certain
,
'
and
I
want
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
try
his
luck
or
the
certainty
?
''
Rostov
asked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'd
better
not
play
,
''
Dolokhov
added
,
and
springing
a
new
pack
*NL*
of
cards
said
:
``
Bank
,
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Moving
the
money
forward
he
prepared
to
deal
.
Rostov
sat
down
by
his
*NL*
side
and
at
first
did
not
play
.
Dolokhov
kept
glancing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
play
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
strange
to
say
Nicholas
felt
that
he
could
not
help
taking
up
a
*NL*
card
,
putting
a
small
stake
on
it
,
and
beginning
to
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
money
with
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
trust
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
staked
five
rubles
on
a
card
and
lost
,
staked
again
,
and
again
*NL*
lost
.
Dolokhov
``
killed
,
''
that
is
,
beat
,
ten
cards
of
Rostov
's
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Dolokhov
after
he
had
dealt
for
some
time
.
``
Please
*NL*
place
your
money
on
the
cards
or
I
may
get
muddled
in
the
reckoning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
players
said
he
hoped
he
might
be
trusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
might
,
but
I
am
afraid
of
getting
the
accounts
mixed
.
So
I
ask
*NL*
you
to
put
the
money
on
your
cards
,
''
replied
Dolokhov
.
``
Do
n't
stint
*NL*
yourself
,
we
'll
settle
afterwards
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
game
continued
;
a
waiter
kept
handing
round
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Rostov
's
cards
were
beaten
and
he
had
eight
hundred
rubles
scored
up
*NL*
against
him
.
He
wrote
``
800
rubles
''
on
a
card
,
but
while
the
waiter
*NL*
filled
his
glass
he
changed
his
mind
and
altered
it
to
his
usual
stake
*NL*
of
twenty
rubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
though
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
looking
at
*NL*
Rostov
,
``
you
'll
win
it
back
all
the
sooner
.
I
lose
to
the
others
but
win
*NL*
from
you
.
Or
are
you
afraid
of
me
?
''
he
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
submitted
.
He
let
the
eight
hundred
remain
and
laid
down
a
seven
*NL*
of
hearts
with
a
torn
corner
,
which
he
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
.
He
*NL*
well
remembered
that
seven
afterwards
.
He
laid
down
the
seven
of
hearts
,
*NL*
on
which
with
a
broken
bit
of
chalk
he
had
written
``
800
rubles
''
in
clear
*NL*
upright
figures
;
he
emptied
the
glass
of
warm
champagne
that
was
handed
*NL*
him
,
smiled
at
Dolokhov
's
words
,
and
with
a
sinking
heart
,
waiting
for
a
*NL*
seven
to
turn
up
,
gazed
at
Dolokhov
's
hands
which
held
the
pack
.
Much
*NL*
depended
on
Rostov
's
winning
or
losing
on
that
seven
of
hearts
.
On
the
*NL*
previous
Sunday
the
old
count
had
given
his
son
two
thousand
rubles
,
and
*NL*
though
he
always
disliked
speaking
of
money
difficulties
had
told
*NL*
Nicholas
that
this
was
all
he
could
let
him
have
till
May
,
and
asked
him
*NL*
to
be
more
economical
this
time
.
Nicholas
had
replied
that
it
would
be
*NL*
more
than
enough
for
him
and
that
he
gave
his
word
of
honor
not
to
take
*NL*
anything
more
till
the
spring
.
Now
only
twelve
hundred
rubles
was
left
*NL*
of
that
money
,
so
that
this
seven
of
hearts
meant
for
him
not
only
the
*NL*
loss
of
sixteen
hundred
rubles
,
but
the
necessity
of
going
back
on
his
*NL*
word
.
With
a
sinking
heart
he
watched
Dolokhov
's
hands
and
thought
,
``
Now
*NL*
then
,
make
haste
and
let
me
have
this
card
and
I
'll
take
my
cap
and
*NL*
drive
home
to
supper
with
Denisov
,
Natasha
,
and
Sonya
,
and
will
*NL*
certainly
never
touch
a
card
again
.
''
At
that
moment
his
home
life
,
jokes
*NL*
with
Petya
,
talks
with
Sonya
,
duets
with
Natasha
,
piquet
with
his
*NL*
father
,
and
even
his
comfortable
bed
in
the
house
on
the
Povarskaya
rose
*NL*
before
him
with
such
vividness
,
clearness
,
and
charm
that
it
seemed
as
*NL*
if
it
were
all
a
lost
and
unappreciated
bliss
,
long
past
.
He
could
not
*NL*
conceive
that
a
stupid
chance
,
letting
the
seven
be
dealt
to
the
right
*NL*
rather
than
to
the
left
,
might
deprive
him
of
all
this
happiness
,
newly
*NL*
appreciated
and
newly
illumined
,
and
plunge
him
into
the
depths
of
*NL*
unknown
and
undefined
misery
.
That
could
not
be
,
yet
he
awaited
with
a
*NL*
sinking
heart
the
movement
of
Dolokhov
's
hands
.
Those
broad
,
reddish
*NL*
hands
,
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
cuffs
,
laid
down
*NL*
the
pack
and
took
up
a
glass
and
a
pipe
that
were
handed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
not
afraid
to
play
with
me
?
''
repeated
Dolokhov
,
and
as
if
*NL*
about
to
tell
a
good
story
he
put
down
the
cards
,
leaned
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
began
deliberately
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
gentlemen
,
I
've
been
told
there
's
a
rumor
going
about
Moscow
that
*NL*
I
'm
a
sharper
,
so
I
advise
you
to
be
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
deal
!
''
exclaimed
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
those
Moscow
gossips
!
''
said
Dolokhov
,
and
he
took
up
the
cards
with
*NL*
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aah
!
''
Rostov
almost
screamed
lifting
both
hands
to
his
head
.
The
seven
*NL*
he
needed
was
lying
uppermost
,
the
first
card
in
the
pack
.
He
had
lost
*NL*
more
than
he
could
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
do
n't
ruin
yourself
!
''
said
Dolokhov
with
a
side
glance
at
Rostov
*NL*
as
he
continued
to
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
and
a
half
later
most
of
the
players
were
but
little
interested
*NL*
in
their
own
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
interest
was
concentrated
on
Rostov
.
Instead
of
sixteen
*NL*
hundred
rubles
he
had
a
long
column
of
figures
scored
against
him
,
which
*NL*
he
had
reckoned
up
to
ten
thousand
,
but
that
now
,
as
he
vaguely
*NL*
supposed
,
must
have
risen
to
fifteen
thousand
.
In
reality
it
already
*NL*
exceeded
twenty
thousand
rubles
.
Dolokhov
was
no
longer
listening
to
*NL*
stories
or
telling
them
,
but
followed
every
movement
of
Rostov
's
hands
*NL*
and
occasionally
ran
his
eyes
over
the
score
against
him
.
He
had
decided
*NL*
to
play
until
that
score
reached
forty-three
thousand
.
He
had
fixed
on
*NL*
that
number
because
forty-three
was
the
sum
of
his
and
Sonya
's
joint
*NL*
ages
.
Rostov
,
leaning
his
head
on
both
hands
,
sat
at
the
table
which
was
*NL*
scrawled
over
with
figures
,
wet
with
spilled
wine
,
and
littered
with
*NL*
cards
.
One
tormenting
impression
did
not
leave
him
:
that
those
broad
-
*NL*
boned
reddish
hands
with
hairy
wrists
visible
from
under
the
shirt
*NL*
sleeves
,
those
hands
which
he
loved
and
hated
,
held
him
in
their
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
hundred
rubles
,
ace
,
a
corner
,
a
nine
...
winning
it
back
's
*NL*
impossible
...
Oh
,
how
pleasant
it
was
at
home
!
...
The
knave
,
double
or
*NL*
quits
...
it
ca
n't
be
!
...
And
why
is
he
doing
this
to
me
?
''
Rostov
*NL*
pondered
.
Sometimes
he
staked
a
large
sum
,
but
Dolokhov
refused
to
*NL*
accept
it
and
fixed
the
stake
himself
.
Nicholas
submitted
to
him
,
and
at
*NL*
one
moment
prayed
to
God
as
he
had
done
on
the
battlefield
at
the
bridge
*NL*
over
the
Enns
,
and
then
guessed
that
the
card
that
came
first
to
hand
*NL*
from
the
crumpled
heap
under
the
table
would
save
him
,
now
counted
the
*NL*
cords
on
his
coat
and
took
a
card
with
that
number
and
tried
staking
the
*NL*
total
of
his
losses
on
it
,
then
he
looked
round
for
aid
from
the
other
*NL*
players
,
or
peered
at
the
now
cold
face
of
Dolokhov
and
tried
to
read
*NL*
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
of
course
what
this
loss
means
to
me
.
He
ca
n't
want
my
ruin
.
*NL*
Was
n't
he
my
friend
?
Was
n't
I
fond
of
him
?
But
it
's
not
his
fault
.
*NL*
What
's
he
to
do
if
he
has
such
luck
?
...
And
it
's
not
my
fault
either
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
to
himself
,
``
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
.
Have
I
killed
anyone
,
*NL*
or
insulted
or
wished
harm
to
anyone
?
Why
such
a
terrible
misfortune
?
*NL*
And
when
did
it
begin
?
Such
a
little
while
ago
I
came
to
this
table
with
*NL*
the
thought
of
winning
a
hundred
rubles
to
buy
that
casket
for
Mamma
's
*NL*
name
day
and
then
going
home
.
I
was
so
happy
,
so
free
,
so
lighthearted
!
*NL*
And
I
did
not
realize
how
happy
I
was
!
When
did
that
end
and
when
did
*NL*
this
new
,
terrible
state
of
things
begin
?
What
marked
the
change
?
I
sat
*NL*
all
the
time
in
this
same
place
at
this
table
,
chose
and
placed
cards
,
*NL*
and
watched
those
broad-boned
agile
hands
in
the
same
way
.
When
did
it
*NL*
happen
and
what
has
happened
?
I
am
well
and
strong
and
still
the
same
*NL*
and
in
the
same
place
.
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
Surely
it
will
all
end
in
*NL*
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
flushed
and
bathed
in
perspiration
,
though
the
room
was
not
hot
.
*NL*
His
face
was
terrible
and
piteous
to
see
,
especially
from
its
helpless
*NL*
efforts
to
seem
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
score
against
him
reached
the
fateful
sum
of
forty-three
thousand
.
*NL*
Rostov
had
just
prepared
a
card
,
by
bending
the
corner
of
which
he
meant
*NL*
to
double
the
three
thousand
just
put
down
to
his
score
,
when
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
slamming
down
the
pack
of
cards
,
put
it
aside
and
began
rapidly
adding
*NL*
up
the
total
of
Rostov
's
debt
,
breaking
the
chalk
as
he
marked
the
*NL*
figures
in
his
clear
,
bold
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supper
,
it
's
time
for
supper
!
And
here
are
the
gypsies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
swarthy
men
and
women
were
really
entering
from
the
cold
outside
*NL*
and
saying
something
in
their
gypsy
accents
.
Nicholas
understood
that
it
*NL*
was
all
over
;
but
he
said
in
an
indifferent
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
wo
n't
you
go
on
?
I
had
a
splendid
card
all
ready
,
''
as
if
it
were
*NL*
the
fun
of
the
game
which
interested
him
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
up
!
I
'm
lost
!
''
thought
he
.
``
Now
a
bullet
through
my
brain
--
*NL*
that
's
all
that
's
left
me
!
''
And
at
the
same
time
he
said
in
a
cheerful
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
just
this
one
more
little
card
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
said
Dolokhov
,
having
finished
the
addition
.
``
All
right
!
*NL*
Twenty-one
rubles
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
figure
twenty-one
by
which
*NL*
the
total
exceeded
the
round
sum
of
forty-three
thousand
;
and
taking
up
*NL*
a
pack
he
prepared
to
deal
.
Rostov
submissively
unbent
the
corner
of
his
*NL*
card
and
,
instead
of
the
six
thousand
he
had
intended
,
carefully
wrote
*NL*
twenty-one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
same
to
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
only
want
to
see
whether
you
will
*NL*
let
me
win
this
ten
,
or
beat
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
began
to
deal
seriously
.
Oh
,
how
Rostov
detested
at
that
moment
*NL*
those
hands
with
their
short
reddish
fingers
and
hairy
wrists
,
which
*NL*
held
him
in
their
power
...
The
ten
fell
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
owe
forty-three
thousand
,
Count
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
and
stretching
*NL*
himself
he
rose
from
the
table
.
``
One
does
get
tired
sitting
so
long
,
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
tired
too
,
''
said
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
cut
him
short
,
as
if
to
remind
him
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
*NL*
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
am
I
to
receive
the
money
,
Count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
flushing
,
drew
Dolokhov
into
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
pay
it
all
immediately
.
Will
you
take
an
I.O.U.
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Rostov
,
''
said
Dolokhov
clearly
,
smiling
and
looking
Nicholas
*NL*
straight
in
the
eyes
,
``
you
know
the
saying
,
`
Lucky
in
love
,
unlucky
at
*NL*
cards

Your
cousin
is
in
love
with
you
,
I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
terrible
to
feel
oneself
so
in
this
man
's
power
,
''
thought
*NL*
Rostov
.
He
knew
what
a
shock
he
would
inflict
on
his
father
and
mother
*NL*
by
the
news
of
this
loss
,
he
knew
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
escape
it
*NL*
all
,
and
felt
that
Dolokhov
knew
that
he
could
save
him
from
all
this
*NL*
shame
and
sorrow
,
but
wanted
now
to
play
with
him
as
a
cat
does
with
a
*NL*
mouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
cousin
...
''
Dolokhov
started
to
say
,
but
Nicholas
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
and
it
's
not
necessary
to
mention
*NL*
her
!
''
he
exclaimed
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
when
am
I
to
have
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow

''
replied
Rostov
and
left
the
room
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
``
tomorrow
''
and
keep
up
a
dignified
tone
was
not
difficult
,
but
to
*NL*
go
home
alone
,
see
his
sisters
,
brother
,
mother
,
and
father
,
confess
and
*NL*
ask
for
money
he
had
no
right
to
after
giving
his
word
of
honor
,
was
*NL*
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
they
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
.
The
young
people
,
after
returning
*NL*
from
the
theater
,
had
had
supper
and
were
grouped
round
the
clavichord
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
Nicholas
entered
,
he
was
enfolded
in
that
poetic
atmosphere
*NL*
of
love
which
pervaded
the
Rostov
household
that
winter
and
,
now
after
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
proposal
and
Iogel
's
ball
,
seemed
to
have
grown
thicker
round
*NL*
Sonya
and
Natasha
as
the
air
does
before
a
thunderstorm
.
Sonya
and
*NL*
Natasha
,
in
the
light-blue
dresses
they
had
worn
at
the
theater
,
looking
*NL*
pretty
and
conscious
of
it
,
were
standing
by
the
clavichord
,
happy
and
*NL*
smiling
.
Vera
was
playing
chess
with
Shinshin
in
the
drawing
room
.
The
*NL*
old
countess
,
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
husband
and
son
,
sat
playing
*NL*
patience
with
the
old
gentlewoman
who
lived
in
their
house
.
Denisov
,
*NL*
with
sparkling
eyes
and
ruffled
hair
,
sat
at
the
clavichord
striking
*NL*
chords
with
his
short
fingers
,
his
legs
thrown
back
and
his
eyes
rolling
*NL*
as
he
sang
,
with
his
small
,
husky
,
but
true
voice
,
some
verses
called
*NL*
``
Enchantress
,
''
which
he
had
composed
,
and
to
which
he
was
trying
to
fit
*NL*
music
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Enchantress
,
say
,
to
my
forsaken
lyre
What
magic
power
is
this
recalls
*NL*
me
still
?
What
spark
has
set
my
inmost
soul
on
fire
,
What
is
this
bliss
*NL*
that
makes
my
fingers
thrill
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
singing
in
passionate
tones
,
gazing
with
his
sparkling
black
-
*NL*
agate
eyes
at
the
frightened
and
happy
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
Excellent
!
''
exclaimed
Natasha
.
``
Another
verse
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
without
noticing
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
still
the
same
with
them
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
glancing
into
*NL*
the
drawing
room
,
where
he
saw
Vera
and
his
mother
with
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
here
's
Nicholas
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
running
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Papa
at
home
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
you
've
come
!
''
said
Natasha
,
without
answering
him
.
``
We
are
*NL*
enjoying
ourselves
!
Vasili
Dmitrich
is
staying
a
day
longer
for
my
sake
!
*NL*
Did
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Papa
is
not
back
yet
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
have
you
come
?
Come
here
,
dear
!
''
called
the
old
countess
from
*NL*
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
went
to
her
,
kissed
her
hand
,
and
sitting
down
silently
at
her
*NL*
table
began
to
watch
her
hands
arranging
the
cards
.
From
the
dancing
*NL*
room
,
they
still
heard
the
laughter
and
merry
voices
trying
to
persuade
*NL*
Natasha
to
sing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
wight
!
All
wight
!
''
shouted
Denisov
.
``
It
's
no
good
making
excuses
*NL*
now
!
It
's
your
turn
to
sing
the
ba
`
cawolla
--
I
entweat
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
glanced
at
her
silent
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
said
he
,
as
if
weary
of
being
continually
asked
the
same
*NL*
question
.
``
Will
Papa
be
back
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
the
same
with
them
.
They
know
nothing
about
it
!
Where
am
I
*NL*
to
go
?
''
thought
Nicholas
,
and
went
again
into
the
dancing
room
where
the
*NL*
clavichord
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
sitting
at
the
clavichord
,
playing
the
prelude
to
Denisov
's
*NL*
favorite
barcarolle
.
Natasha
was
preparing
to
sing
.
Denisov
was
looking
*NL*
at
her
with
enraptured
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
they
want
to
make
her
sing
?
How
can
she
sing
?
There
's
nothing
to
*NL*
be
happy
about
!
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
struck
the
first
chord
of
the
prelude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
I
'm
a
ruined
and
dishonored
man
!
A
bullet
through
my
brain
is
*NL*
the
only
thing
left
me
--
not
singing
!
''
his
thoughts
ran
on
.
``
Go
away
?
But
*NL*
where
to
?
It
's
one
--
let
them
sing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
pace
the
room
,
looking
gloomily
at
Denisov
and
the
girls
*NL*
and
avoiding
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolenka
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
Sonya
's
eyes
fixed
on
him
seemed
to
*NL*
ask
.
She
noticed
at
once
that
something
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
turned
away
from
her
.
Natasha
too
,
with
her
quick
instinct
,
had
*NL*
instantly
noticed
her
brother
's
condition
.
But
,
though
she
noticed
it
,
*NL*
she
was
herself
in
such
high
spirits
at
that
moment
,
so
far
from
sorrow
,
*NL*
sadness
,
or
self-reproach
,
that
she
purposely
deceived
herself
as
young
*NL*
people
often
do
.
``
No
,
I
am
too
happy
now
to
spoil
my
enjoyment
by
*NL*
sympathy
with
anyone
's
sorrow
,
''
she
felt
,
and
she
said
to
herself
:
``
No
,
*NL*
I
must
be
mistaken
,
he
must
be
feeling
happy
,
just
as
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Sonya
!
''
she
said
,
going
to
the
very
middle
of
the
room
,
where
she
*NL*
considered
the
resonance
was
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
lifted
her
head
and
let
her
arms
droop
lifelessly
,
as
ballet
*NL*
dancers
do
,
Natasha
,
rising
energetically
from
her
heels
to
her
toes
,
*NL*
stepped
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
me
!
''
she
seemed
to
say
,
answering
the
rapt
gaze
with
which
*NL*
Denisov
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
she
so
pleased
about
?
''
thought
Nicholas
,
looking
at
his
*NL*
sister
.
``
Why
is
n't
she
dull
and
ashamed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
took
the
first
note
,
her
throat
swelled
,
her
chest
rose
,
her
*NL*
eyes
became
serious
.
At
that
moment
she
was
oblivious
of
her
*NL*
surroundings
,
and
from
her
smiling
lips
flowed
sounds
which
anyone
may
*NL*
produce
at
the
same
intervals
and
hold
for
the
same
time
,
but
which
*NL*
leave
you
cold
a
thousand
times
and
the
thousand
and
first
time
thrill
*NL*
you
and
make
you
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
that
winter
,
had
for
the
first
time
begun
to
sing
seriously
,
*NL*
mainly
because
Denisov
so
delighted
in
her
singing
.
She
no
longer
sang
*NL*
as
a
child
,
there
was
no
longer
in
her
singing
that
comical
,
childish
,
*NL*
painstaking
effect
that
had
been
in
it
before
;
but
she
did
not
yet
sing
*NL*
well
,
as
all
the
connoisseurs
who
heard
her
said
:
``
It
is
not
trained
,
*NL*
but
it
is
a
beautiful
voice
that
must
be
trained
.
''
Only
they
generally
*NL*
said
this
some
time
after
she
had
finished
singing
.
While
that
untrained
*NL*
voice
,
with
its
incorrect
breathing
and
labored
transitions
,
was
*NL*
sounding
,
even
the
connoisseurs
said
nothing
,
but
only
delighted
in
it
*NL*
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
.
In
her
voice
there
was
a
virginal
*NL*
freshness
,
an
unconsciousness
of
her
own
powers
,
and
an
as
yet
untrained
*NL*
velvety
softness
,
which
so
mingled
with
her
lack
of
art
in
singing
that
*NL*
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
in
that
voice
could
be
altered
without
spoiling
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
thought
Nicholas
,
listening
to
her
with
widely
opened
*NL*
eyes
.
``
What
has
happened
to
her
?
How
she
is
singing
today
!
''
And
suddenly
*NL*
the
whole
world
centered
for
him
on
anticipation
of
the
next
note
,
the
*NL*
next
phrase
,
and
everything
in
the
world
was
divided
into
three
beats
:
*NL*
``
Oh
mio
crudele
affetto
.
''
...
One
,
two
,
three
...
one
,
two
,
three
...
*NL*
One
...
``
Oh
mio
crudele
affetto
.
''
...
One
,
two
,
three
...
One
.
``
Oh
,
this
*NL*
senseless
life
of
ours
!
''
thought
Nicholas
.
``
All
this
misery
,
and
money
,
*NL*
and
Dolokhov
,
and
anger
,
and
honor
--
it
's
all
nonsense
...
but
this
is
*NL*
real
...
Now
then
,
Natasha
,
now
then
,
dearest
!
Now
then
,
darling
!
How
*NL*
will
she
take
that
si
?
She
's
taken
it
!
Thank
God
!
''
And
without
noticing
*NL*
that
he
was
singing
,
to
strengthen
the
si
he
sung
a
second
,
a
third
*NL*
below
the
high
note
.
``
Ah
,
God
!
How
fine
!
Did
I
really
take
it
?
How
*NL*
fortunate
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
that
chord
vibrated
,
and
how
moved
was
something
that
was
finest
*NL*
in
Rostov
's
soul
!
And
this
something
was
apart
from
everything
else
in
*NL*
the
world
and
above
everything
in
the
world
.
``
What
were
losses
,
and
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
and
words
of
honor
?
...
All
nonsense
!
One
might
kill
and
rob
*NL*
and
yet
be
happy

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
since
Rostov
had
felt
such
enjoyment
from
music
as
he
did
*NL*
that
day
.
But
no
sooner
had
Natasha
finished
her
barcarolle
than
reality
*NL*
again
presented
itself
.
He
got
up
without
saying
a
word
and
went
*NL*
downstairs
to
his
own
room
.
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
old
count
*NL*
came
in
from
his
club
,
cheerful
and
contented
.
Nicholas
,
hearing
him
*NL*
drive
up
,
went
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
had
a
good
time
?
''
said
the
old
count
,
smiling
gaily
and
proudly
*NL*
at
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
tried
to
say
``
Yes
,
''
but
could
not
:
and
he
nearly
burst
into
*NL*
sobs
.
The
count
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
did
not
notice
his
son
's
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
ca
n't
be
avoided
!
''
thought
Nicholas
,
for
the
first
and
last
*NL*
time
.
And
suddenly
,
in
the
most
casual
tone
,
which
made
him
feel
ashamed
*NL*
of
himself
,
he
said
,
as
if
merely
asking
his
father
to
let
him
have
the
*NL*
carriage
to
drive
to
town
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
I
have
come
on
a
matter
of
business
.
I
was
nearly
forgetting
.
I
*NL*
need
some
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
his
father
,
who
was
in
a
specially
good
humor
.
``
I
told
*NL*
you
it
would
not
be
enough
.
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
,
''
said
Nicholas
flushing
,
and
with
a
stupid
careless
smile
,
*NL*
for
which
he
was
long
unable
to
forgive
himself
,
``
I
have
lost
a
little
,
*NL*
I
mean
a
good
deal
,
a
great
deal
--
forty
three
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
To
whom
?
...
Nonsense
!
''
cried
the
count
,
suddenly
reddening
with
*NL*
an
apoplectic
flush
over
neck
and
nape
as
old
people
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
pay
tomorrow
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
...
''
said
the
old
count
,
spreading
out
his
arms
and
sinking
*NL*
helplessly
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
helped
It
happens
to
everyone
!
''
said
the
son
,
with
a
bold
,
*NL*
free
,
and
easy
tone
,
while
in
his
soul
he
regarded
himself
as
a
*NL*
worthless
scoundrel
whose
whole
life
could
not
atone
for
his
crime
.
He
*NL*
longed
to
kiss
his
father
's
hands
and
kneel
to
beg
his
forgiveness
,
but
*NL*
said
,
in
a
careless
and
even
rude
voice
,
that
it
happens
to
everyone
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
cast
down
his
eyes
on
hearing
his
son
's
words
and
began
*NL*
bustlingly
searching
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
it
will
be
difficult
,
I
fear
,
difficult
to
*NL*
raise
...
happens
to
everybody
!
Yes
,
who
has
not
done
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
furtive
glance
at
his
son
's
face
,
the
count
went
out
of
the
*NL*
room
...
Nicholas
had
been
prepared
for
resistance
,
but
had
not
at
all
*NL*
expected
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
!
Pa-pa
!
''
he
called
after
him
,
sobbing
,
``
forgive
me
!
''
And
seizing
*NL*
his
father
's
hand
,
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
father
and
son
were
having
their
explanation
,
the
mother
and
*NL*
daughter
were
having
one
not
less
important
.
Natasha
came
running
to
her
*NL*
mother
,
quite
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
...
Mamma
!
...
He
has
made
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
,
made
me
an
offer
,
Mamma
!
Mamma
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
did
not
believe
her
ears
.
Denisov
had
proposed
.
To
whom
?
To
*NL*
this
chit
of
a
girl
,
Natasha
,
who
not
so
long
ago
was
playing
with
dolls
*NL*
and
who
was
still
having
lessons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Natasha
!
What
nonsense
!
''
she
said
,
hoping
it
was
a
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
indeed
!
I
am
telling
you
the
fact
,
''
said
Natasha
indignantly
.
*NL*
``
I
come
to
ask
you
what
to
do
,
and
you
call
it
`
nonsense
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
true
that
Monsieur
Denisov
has
made
you
a
proposal
,
tell
him
*NL*
he
is
a
fool
,
that
's
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
not
a
fool
!
''
replied
Natasha
indignantly
and
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
what
do
you
want
?
You
're
all
in
love
nowadays
.
Well
,
if
you
*NL*
are
in
love
,
marry
him
!
''
said
the
countess
,
with
a
laugh
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
``
Good
luck
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mamma

I
'm
not
in

I
suppose
I
'm
not
in

with
*NL*
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
tell
him
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

are
you
cross

Do
n't
be
cross

dear
!
Is
it
my
fault

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
what
is
it
,
my
dear
?
Do
you
want
me
to
go
and
tell
him
?
''
said
*NL*
the
countess
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
will
do
it
myself
,
only
tell
me
what
to
say
.
It
's
all
very
well
*NL*
for
you
,
''
said
Natasha
,
with
a
responsive
smile
.
``
You
should
have
seen
*NL*
how
he
said
it
!
I
know
he
did
not
mean
to
say
it
,
but
it
came
out
*NL*
accidently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
the
same
,
you
must
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
must
n't
.
I
am
so
sorry
for
him
!
He
's
so
nice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
accept
his
offer
.
It
's
high
time
for
you
to
be
married
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
countess
sharply
and
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mamma
,
but
I
'm
so
sorry
for
him
.
I
do
n't
know
how
I
'm
to
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
's
nothing
for
you
to
say
.
I
shall
speak
to
him
myself
,
''
said
*NL*
the
countess
,
indignant
that
they
should
have
dared
to
treat
this
little
*NL*
Natasha
as
grown
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
on
any
account
!
I
will
tell
him
myself
,
and
you
'll
listen
at
*NL*
the
door
,
''
and
Natasha
ran
across
the
drawing
room
to
the
dancing
hall
,
*NL*
where
Denisov
was
sitting
on
the
same
chair
by
the
clavichord
with
his
*NL*
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
her
light
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nataly
,
''
he
said
,
moving
with
rapid
steps
toward
her
,
``
decide
my
fate
.
*NL*
It
is
in
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vasili
Dmitrich
,
I
'm
so
sorry
for
you
!
...
No
,
but
you
are
so
nice
...
*NL*
but
it
wo
n't
do
...
not
that
...
but
as
a
friend
,
I
shall
always
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
bent
over
her
hand
and
she
heard
strange
sounds
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
.
She
kissed
his
rough
curly
black
head
.
At
this
instant
,
they
*NL*
heard
the
quick
rustle
of
the
countess
'
dress
.
She
came
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vasili
Dmitrich
,
I
thank
you
for
the
honor
,
''
she
said
,
with
an
*NL*
embarrassed
voice
,
though
it
sounded
severe
to
Denisov
--
``
but
my
daughter
*NL*
is
so
young
,
and
I
thought
that
,
as
my
son
's
friend
,
you
would
have
*NL*
addressed
yourself
first
to
me
.
In
that
case
you
would
not
have
obliged
*NL*
me
to
give
this
refusal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
...
''
said
Denisov
,
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
guilty
face
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
say
more
,
but
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
could
not
remain
calm
,
seeing
him
in
such
a
plight
.
She
began
to
*NL*
sob
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
,
I
have
done
w
`
ong
,
''
Denisov
went
on
in
an
unsteady
voice
,
*NL*
``
but
believe
me
,
I
so
adore
your
daughter
and
all
your
family
that
I
*NL*
would
give
my
life
twice
over
...
''
He
looked
at
the
countess
,
and
seeing
*NL*
her
severe
face
said
:
``
Well
,
good-by
,
Countess
,
''
and
kissing
her
hand
,
*NL*
he
left
the
room
with
quick
resolute
strides
,
without
looking
at
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Rostov
saw
Denisov
off
.
He
did
not
wish
to
stay
another
day
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
All
Denisov
's
Moscow
friends
gave
him
a
farewell
entertainment
*NL*
at
the
gypsies
'
,
with
the
result
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
how
he
*NL*
was
put
in
the
sleigh
or
of
the
first
three
stages
of
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Denisov
's
departure
,
Rostov
spent
another
fortnight
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
without
going
out
of
the
house
,
waiting
for
the
money
his
father
could
*NL*
not
at
once
raise
,
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
girls
'
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
more
tender
and
devoted
to
him
than
ever
.
It
was
as
if
she
*NL*
wanted
to
show
him
that
his
losses
were
an
achievement
that
made
her
*NL*
love
him
all
the
more
,
but
Nicholas
now
considered
himself
unworthy
of
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
filled
the
girls
'
albums
with
verses
and
music
,
and
having
at
last
*NL*
sent
Dolokhov
the
whole
forty-three
thousand
rubles
and
received
his
*NL*
receipt
,
he
left
at
the
end
of
November
,
without
taking
leave
of
any
of
*NL*
his
acquaintances
,
to
overtake
his
regiment
which
was
already
in
Poland

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
interview
with
his
wife
Pierre
left
for
Petersburg
.
At
the
*NL*
Torzhok
post
station
,
either
there
were
no
horses
or
the
postmaster
*NL*
would
not
supply
them
.
Pierre
was
obliged
to
wait
.
Without
undressing
,
*NL*
he
lay
down
on
the
leather
sofa
in
front
of
a
round
table
,
put
his
big
*NL*
feet
in
their
overboots
on
the
table
,
and
began
to
reflect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
the
portmanteaus
brought
in
?
And
a
bed
got
ready
,
and
*NL*
tea
?
''
asked
his
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gave
no
answer
,
for
he
neither
heard
nor
saw
anything
.
He
had
*NL*
begun
to
think
of
the
last
station
and
was
still
pondering
on
the
same
*NL*
question
--
one
so
important
that
he
took
no
notice
of
what
went
on
around
*NL*
him
.
Not
only
was
he
indifferent
as
to
whether
he
got
to
Petersburg
*NL*
earlier
or
later
,
or
whether
he
secured
accommodation
at
this
station
,
*NL*
but
compared
to
the
thoughts
that
now
occupied
him
it
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
indifference
whether
he
remained
there
for
a
few
hours
or
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postmaster
,
his
wife
,
the
valet
,
and
a
peasant
woman
selling
Torzhok
*NL*
embroidery
came
into
the
room
offering
their
services
.
Without
changing
*NL*
his
careless
attitude
,
Pierre
looked
at
them
over
his
spectacles
unable
*NL*
to
understand
what
they
wanted
or
how
they
could
go
on
living
without
*NL*
having
solved
the
problems
that
so
absorbed
him
.
He
had
been
engrossed
*NL*
by
the
same
thoughts
ever
since
the
day
he
returned
from
Sokolniki
after
*NL*
the
duel
and
had
spent
that
first
agonizing
,
sleepless
night
.
But
now
,
*NL*
in
the
solitude
of
the
journey
,
they
seized
him
with
special
force
.
No
*NL*
matter
what
he
thought
about
,
he
always
returned
to
these
same
questions
*NL*
which
he
could
not
solve
and
yet
could
not
cease
to
ask
himself
.
It
was
*NL*
as
if
the
thread
of
the
chief
screw
which
held
his
life
together
were
*NL*
stripped
,
so
that
the
screw
could
not
get
in
or
out
,
but
went
on
turning
*NL*
uselessly
in
the
same
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postmaster
came
in
and
began
obsequiously
to
beg
his
excellency
to
*NL*
wait
only
two
hours
,
when
,
come
what
might
,
he
would
let
his
excellency
*NL*
have
the
courier
horses
.
It
was
plain
that
he
was
lying
and
only
wanted
*NL*
to
get
more
money
from
the
traveler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
good
or
bad
?
''
Pierre
asked
himself
.
``
It
is
good
for
me
,
bad
for
*NL*
another
traveler
,
and
for
himself
it
's
unavoidable
,
because
he
needs
*NL*
money
for
food
;
the
man
said
an
officer
had
once
given
him
a
thrashing
*NL*
for
letting
a
private
traveler
have
the
courier
horses
.
But
the
officer
*NL*
thrashed
him
because
he
had
to
get
on
as
quickly
as
possible
.
And
I
,
''
*NL*
continued
Pierre
,
``
shot
Dolokhov
because
I
considered
myself
injured
,
*NL*
and
Louis
XVI
was
executed
because
they
considered
him
a
criminal
,
and
a
*NL*
year
later
they
executed
those
who
executed
him
--
also
for
some
reason
.
*NL*
What
is
bad
?
What
is
good
?
What
should
one
love
and
what
hate
?
What
does
*NL*
one
live
for
?
And
what
am
I
?
What
is
life
,
and
what
is
death
?
What
power
*NL*
governs
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
to
any
of
these
questions
,
except
one
,
and
that
not
*NL*
a
logical
answer
and
not
at
all
a
reply
to
them
.
The
answer
was
:
``
You
'll
*NL*
die
and
all
will
end
.
You
'll
die
and
know
all
,
or
cease
asking
.
''
But
*NL*
dying
was
also
dreadful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Torzhok
peddler
woman
,
in
a
whining
voice
,
went
on
offering
her
*NL*
wares
,
especially
a
pair
of
goatskin
slippers
.
``
I
have
hundreds
of
*NL*
rubles
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
with
,
and
she
stands
in
her
tattered
*NL*
cloak
looking
timidly
at
me
,
''
he
thought
.
``
And
what
does
she
want
the
*NL*
money
for
?
As
if
that
money
could
add
a
hair
's
breadth
to
happiness
or
*NL*
peace
of
mind
.
Can
anything
in
the
world
make
her
or
me
less
a
prey
to
*NL*
evil
and
death
?
--
death
which
ends
all
and
must
come
today
or
tomorrow
--
*NL*
at
any
rate
,
in
an
instant
as
compared
with
eternity
.
''
And
again
he
*NL*
twisted
the
screw
with
the
stripped
thread
,
and
again
it
turned
*NL*
uselessly
in
the
same
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
servant
handed
him
a
half-cut
novel
,
in
the
form
of
letters
,
by
*NL*
Madame
de
Souza
.
He
began
reading
about
the
sufferings
and
virtuous
*NL*
struggles
of
a
certain
Emilie
de
Mansfeld
.
``
And
why
did
she
resist
her
*NL*
seducer
when
she
loved
him
?
''
he
thought
.
``
God
could
not
have
put
into
*NL*
her
heart
an
impulse
that
was
against
His
will
.
My
wife
--
as
she
once
*NL*
was
--
did
not
struggle
,
and
perhaps
she
was
right
.
Nothing
has
been
found
*NL*
out
,
nothing
discovered
,
''
Pierre
again
said
to
himself
.
``
All
we
can
know
*NL*
is
that
we
know
nothing
.
And
that
's
the
height
of
human
wisdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
within
and
around
him
seemed
confused
,
senseless
,
and
*NL*
repellent
.
Yet
in
this
very
repugnance
to
all
his
circumstances
Pierre
*NL*
found
a
kind
of
tantalizing
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
bold
to
ask
your
excellency
to
move
a
little
for
this
*NL*
gentleman
,
''
said
the
postmaster
,
entering
the
room
followed
by
another
*NL*
traveler
,
also
detained
for
lack
of
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
newcomer
was
a
short
,
large-boned
,
yellow-faced
,
wrinkled
old
man
,
*NL*
with
gray
bushy
eyebrows
overhanging
bright
eyes
of
an
indefinite
*NL*
grayish
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
his
feet
off
the
table
,
stood
up
,
and
lay
down
on
a
bed
that
*NL*
had
been
got
ready
for
him
,
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
newcomer
,
who
,
*NL*
with
a
gloomy
and
tired
face
,
was
wearily
taking
off
his
wraps
with
the
*NL*
aid
of
his
servant
,
and
not
looking
at
Pierre
.
With
a
pair
of
felt
boots
*NL*
on
his
thin
bony
legs
,
and
keeping
on
a
worn
,
nankeen-covered
,
sheepskin
*NL*
coat
,
the
traveler
sat
down
on
the
sofa
,
leaned
back
his
big
head
with
*NL*
its
broad
temples
and
close-cropped
hair
,
and
looked
at
Bezukhov
.
The
*NL*
stern
,
shrewd
,
and
penetrating
expression
of
that
look
struck
Pierre
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
wish
to
speak
to
the
stranger
,
but
by
the
time
he
had
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
ask
him
a
question
about
the
roads
,
the
traveler
had
closed
his
*NL*
eyes
.
His
shriveled
old
hands
were
folded
and
on
the
finger
of
one
of
*NL*
them
Pierre
noticed
a
large
cast
iron
ring
with
a
seal
representing
a
*NL*
death
's
head
.
The
stranger
sat
without
stirring
,
either
resting
or
,
as
*NL*
it
seemed
to
Pierre
,
sunk
in
profound
and
calm
meditation
.
His
servant
*NL*
was
also
a
yellow
,
wrinkled
old
man
,
without
beard
or
mustache
,
*NL*
evidently
not
because
he
was
shaven
but
because
they
had
never
grown
.
*NL*
This
active
old
servant
was
unpacking
the
traveler
's
canteen
and
*NL*
preparing
tea
.
He
brought
in
a
boiling
samovar
.
When
everything
was
*NL*
ready
,
the
stranger
opened
his
eyes
,
moved
to
the
table
,
filled
a
*NL*
tumbler
with
tea
for
himself
and
one
for
the
beardless
old
man
to
whom
*NL*
he
passed
it
.
Pierre
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
uneasiness
,
and
the
need
,
*NL*
even
the
inevitability
,
of
entering
into
conversation
with
this
*NL*
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
brought
back
his
tumbler
turned
upside
down
,
*
with
an
*NL*
unfinished
bit
of
nibbled
sugar
,
and
asked
if
anything
more
would
be
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
indicate
he
did
not
want
more
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Give
me
the
book
,
''
said
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
handed
him
a
book
which
Pierre
took
to
be
a
devotional
work
,
*NL*
and
the
traveler
became
absorbed
in
it
.
Pierre
looked
at
him
.
All
at
*NL*
once
the
stranger
closed
the
book
,
putting
in
a
marker
,
and
again
,
*NL*
leaning
with
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
sat
in
his
former
*NL*
position
with
his
eyes
shut
.
Pierre
looked
at
him
and
had
not
time
to
*NL*
turn
away
when
the
old
man
,
opening
his
eyes
,
fixed
his
steady
and
*NL*
severe
gaze
straight
on
Pierre
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
felt
confused
and
wished
to
avoid
that
look
,
but
the
bright
old
*NL*
eyes
attracted
him
irresistibly
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
pleasure
of
addressing
Count
Bezukhov
,
if
I
am
not
*NL*
mistaken
,
''
said
the
stranger
in
a
deliberate
and
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
silently
and
inquiringly
at
him
over
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
of
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
continued
the
stranger
,
``
and
of
your
*NL*
misfortune
.
''
He
seemed
to
emphasize
the
last
word
,
as
if
to
say
--
``
Yes
,
*NL*
misfortune
!
Call
it
what
you
please
,
I
know
that
what
happened
to
you
in
*NL*
Moscow
was
a
misfortune
.
''
--
``
I
regret
it
very
much
,
my
dear
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
flushed
and
,
hurriedly
putting
his
legs
down
from
the
bed
,
bent
*NL*
forward
toward
the
old
man
with
a
forced
and
timid
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
referred
to
this
out
of
curiosity
,
my
dear
sir
,
but
for
*NL*
greater
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
his
gaze
still
on
Pierre
,
and
moved
aside
on
the
sofa
by
way
*NL*
of
inviting
the
other
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
.
Pierre
felt
reluctant
*NL*
to
enter
into
conversation
with
this
old
man
,
but
,
submitting
to
him
*NL*
involuntarily
,
came
up
and
sat
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unhappy
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
the
stranger
continued
.
``
You
are
young
*NL*
and
I
am
old
.
I
should
like
to
help
you
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
Pierre
,
with
a
forced
smile
.
``
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
.
*NL*
Where
are
you
traveling
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
's
face
was
not
genial
,
it
was
even
cold
and
severe
,
but
in
*NL*
spite
of
this
,
both
the
face
and
words
of
his
new
acquaintance
were
*NL*
irresistibly
attractive
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
for
reason
you
do
n't
feel
inclined
to
talk
to
me
,
''
said
the
old
*NL*
man
,
``
say
so
,
my
dear
sir
.
''
And
he
suddenly
smiled
,
in
an
unexpected
and
*NL*
tenderly
paternal
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
at
all
!
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
very
glad
to
make
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
''
said
Pierre
.
And
again
,
glancing
at
the
stranger
's
hands
,
*NL*
he
looked
more
closely
at
the
ring
,
with
its
skull
--
a
masonic
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
ask
,
''
he
said
,
``
are
you
a
Mason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
belong
to
the
Brotherhood
of
the
Freemasons
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
*NL*
looking
deeper
and
deeper
into
Pierre
's
eyes
.
``
And
in
their
name
and
my
*NL*
own
I
hold
out
a
brotherly
hand
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
said
Pierre
,
smiling
,
and
wavering
between
the
confidence
*NL*
the
personality
of
the
Freemason
inspired
in
him
and
his
own
habit
of
*NL*
ridiculing
the
masonic
beliefs
--
``
I
am
afraid
I
am
very
far
from
*NL*
understanding
--
how
am
I
to
put
it
?
--
I
am
afraid
my
way
of
looking
at
the
*NL*
world
is
so
opposed
to
yours
that
we
shall
not
understand
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
outlook
,
''
said
the
Mason
,
``
and
the
view
of
life
you
*NL*
mention
,
and
which
you
think
is
the
result
of
your
own
mental
efforts
,
*NL*
is
the
one
held
by
the
majority
of
people
,
and
is
the
invariable
fruit
*NL*
of
pride
,
indolence
,
and
ignorance
.
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
sir
,
but
if
I
*NL*
had
not
known
it
I
should
not
have
addressed
you
.
Your
view
of
life
is
a
*NL*
regrettable
delusion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
I
may
suppose
you
to
be
deluded
,
''
said
Pierre
,
with
a
faint
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
dare
to
say
that
I
know
the
truth
,
''
said
the
Mason
,
*NL*
whose
words
struck
Pierre
more
and
more
by
their
precision
and
firmness
.
*NL*
``
No
one
can
attain
to
truth
by
himself

Only
by
laying
stone
on
stone
*NL*
with
the
cooperation
of
all
,
by
the
millions
of
generations
from
our
*NL*
forefather
Adam
to
our
own
times
,
is
that
temple
reared
which
is
to
be
a
*NL*
worthy
dwelling
place
of
the
Great
God

''
he
added
,
and
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
believe

do
not
believe
in
God

''
*NL*
said
Pierre
,
regretfully
and
with
an
effort
,
feeling
it
essential
to
*NL*
speak
the
whole
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mason
looked
intently
at
Pierre
and
smiled
as
a
rich
man
with
*NL*
millions
in
hand
might
smile
at
a
poor
fellow
who
told
him
that
he
,
poor
*NL*
man
,
had
not
the
five
rubles
that
would
make
him
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
not
know
Him
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
said
the
Mason
.
``
You
can
not
*NL*
know
Him
.
You
do
not
know
Him
and
that
is
why
you
are
unhappy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
am
unhappy

assented
Pierre
.
``
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Him
not

my

so
you
are
very
unhappy

He

here

He
is
in
me

He

in
my

He
is
in
thee

*NL*
and
even
in
those
blasphemous
words
thou
hast
just
uttered

''
pronounced
*NL*
the
Mason
in
a
stern
and
tremulous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
sighed
,
evidently
trying
to
calm
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
He
were
not
,
''
he
said
quietly
,
``
you

I
would
not

speaking

Of
what

are
we
speaking

Whom
hast
thou

he
suddenly
asked
with
exulting
austerity
and
authority
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
``
Who
invented
Him

Whence
came
thy

conception

incomprehensible
Being

didst

thou

and
why

the

conceive

such
an
incomprehensible
Being

a
Being
all-powerful
,
eternal
,
and
*NL*
infinite
in
all
His
attributes
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
and
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
could
not
and
did
not
wish
to
break
this
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
exists
,
but
to
understand
Him
is
hard
,
''
the
Mason
began
again
,
*NL*
looking
not
at
Pierre
but
straight
before
him
,
and
turning
the
leaves
of
*NL*
his
book
with
his
old
hands
which
from
excitement
he
could
not
keep
*NL*
still
.
``
If
it
were
a
man
whose
existence
thou
didst
doubt
I
could
bring
*NL*
him
to
thee
,
could
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
to
thee
.
But
how
*NL*
can
I
,
an
insignificant
mortal
,
show
His
omnipotence
,
His
infinity
,
and
*NL*
all
His
mercy
to
one
who
is
blind
,
or
who
shuts
his
eyes
that
he
may
not
*NL*
see
or
understand
Him
and
may
not
see
or
understand
his
own
vileness
and
*NL*
sinfulness
?
''
He
paused
again
.
``
Who
art
thou
?
Thou
dreamest
that
thou
art
*NL*
wise
because
thou
couldst
utter
those
blasphemous
words
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
with
a
somber
and
scornful
smile
.
``
And
thou
art
more
foolish
and
*NL*
unreasonable
than
a
little
child
,
who
,
playing
with
the
parts
of
a
*NL*
skillfully
made
watch
,
dares
to
say
that
,
as
he
does
not
understand
its
*NL*
use
,
he
does
not
believe
in
the
master
who
made
it
.
To
know
Him
is
*NL*
hard
...
For
ages
,
from
our
forefather
Adam
to
our
own
day
,
we
labor
to
*NL*
attain
that
knowledge
and
are
still
infinitely
far
from
our
aim
;
but
in
*NL*
our
lack
of
understanding
we
see
only
our
weakness
and
His
*NL*
greatness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
listened
with
swelling
heart
,
gazing
into
the
Mason
's
face
with
*NL*
shining
eyes
,
not
interrupting
or
questioning
him
,
but
believing
with
*NL*
his
whole
soul
what
the
stranger
said
.
Whether
he
accepted
the
wise
*NL*
reasoning
contained
in
the
Mason
's
words
,
or
believed
as
a
child
*NL*
believes
,
in
the
speaker
's
tone
of
conviction
and
earnestness
,
or
the
*NL*
tremor
of
the
speaker
's
voice
--
which
sometimes
almost
broke
--
or
those
*NL*
brilliant
aged
eyes
grown
old
in
this
conviction
,
or
the
calm
firmness
*NL*
and
certainty
of
his
vocation
,
which
radiated
from
his
whole
being
-LRB-
and
*NL*
which
struck
Pierre
especially
by
contrast
with
his
own
dejection
and
*NL*
hopelessness
-RRB-
--
at
any
rate
,
Pierre
longed
with
his
whole
soul
to
believe
*NL*
and
he
did
believe
,
and
felt
a
joyful
sense
of
comfort
,
regeneration
,
*NL*
and
return
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
to
be
apprehended
by
reason
,
but
by
life
,
''
said
the
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
,
''
said
Pierre
,
feeling
with
dismay
doubts
*NL*
reawakening
.
He
was
afraid
of
any
want
of
clearness
,
any
weakness
,
in
*NL*
the
Mason
's
arguments
;
he
dreaded
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
him
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
it
is
that
the
mind
of
man
can
not
*NL*
attain
the
knowledge
of
which
you
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mason
smiled
with
his
gentle
fatherly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
highest
wisdom
and
truth
are
like
the
purest
liquid
we
may
wish
to
*NL*
imbibe
,
''
he
said
.
``
Can
I
receive
that
pure
liquid
into
an
impure
vessel
*NL*
and
judge
of
its
purity
?
Only
by
the
inner
purification
of
myself
can
I
*NL*
retain
in
some
degree
of
purity
the
liquid
I
receive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
is
so
,
''
said
Pierre
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
highest
wisdom
is
not
founded
on
reason
alone
,
not
on
those
worldly
*NL*
sciences
of
physics
,
history
,
chemistry
,
and
the
like
,
into
which
*NL*
intellectual
knowledge
is
divided
.
The
highest
wisdom
is
one
.
The
*NL*
highest
wisdom
has
but
one
science
--
the
science
of
the
whole
--
the
*NL*
science
explaining
the
whole
creation
and
man
's
place
in
it
.
To
receive
*NL*
that
science
it
is
necessary
to
purify
and
renew
one
's
inner
self
,
and
*NL*
so
before
one
can
know
,
it
is
necessary
to
believe
and
to
perfect
one
's
*NL*
self
.
And
to
attain
this
end
,
we
have
the
light
called
conscience
that
*NL*
God
has
implanted
in
our
souls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

assented
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
then
at
thy
inner
self
with
the
eyes
of
the
spirit
,
and
ask
*NL*
thyself
whether
thou
art
content
with
thyself
.
What
hast
thou
attained
*NL*
relying
on
reason
only
?
What
art
thou
?
You
are
young
,
you
are
rich

you
*NL*
are
clever

you
are
well
educated

And
what
have
you
done
with
all
these
*NL*
good
gifts
?
Are
you
content
with
yourself
and
with
your
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
hate
my
life

Pierre
muttered
,
wincing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hatest
it

Then
change
it
,
purify
thyself
;
and
as
thou
art
*NL*
purified
,
thou
wilt
gain
wisdom
.
Look
at
your
life
,
my
dear
sir
.
How
*NL*
have
you
spent
it
?
In
riotous
orgies
and
debauchery
,
receiving
*NL*
everything
from
society
and
giving
nothing
in
return
.
You
have
become
*NL*
the
possessor
of
wealth
.
How
have
you
used
it
?
What
have
you
done
for
*NL*
your
neighbor
?
Have
you
ever
thought
of
your
tens
of
thousands
of
*NL*
slaves
?
Have
you
helped
them
physically
and
morally
?
No
!
You
have
*NL*
profited
by
their
toil
to
lead
a
profligate
life
.
That
is
what
you
have
*NL*
done
.
Have
you
chosen
a
post
in
which
you
might
be
of
service
to
your
*NL*
neighbor
?
No
!
You
have
spent
your
life
in
idleness
.
Then
you
married
,
my
*NL*
dear
sir
--
took
on
yourself
responsibility
for
the
guidance
of
a
young
*NL*
woman
;
and
what
have
you
done
?
You
have
not
helped
her
to
find
the
way
*NL*
of
truth
,
my
dear
sir
,
but
have
thrust
her
into
an
abyss
of
deceit
and
*NL*
misery
.
A
man
offended
you
and
you
shot
him
,
and
you
say
you
do
not
know
*NL*
God
and
hate
your
life
.
There
is
nothing
strange
in
that
,
my
dear
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
words
,
the
Mason
,
as
if
tired
by
his
long
discourse
,
again
*NL*
leaned
his
arms
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
closed
his
eyes
.
Pierre
*NL*
looked
at
that
aged
,
stern
,
motionless
,
almost
lifeless
face
and
moved
*NL*
his
lips
without
uttering
a
sound
.
He
wished
to
say
,
``
Yes
,
a
vile
,
idle
,
*NL*
vicious
life
!
''
but
dared
not
break
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mason
cleared
his
throat
huskily
,
as
old
men
do
,
and
called
his
*NL*
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
the
horses
?
''
he
asked
,
without
looking
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
exchange
horses
have
just
come
,
''
answered
the
servant
.
``
Will
you
*NL*
not
rest
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
tell
them
to
harness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
he
really
be
going
away
leaving
me
alone
without
having
told
me
*NL*
all
,
and
without
promising
to
help
me
?
''
thought
Pierre
,
rising
with
*NL*
downcast
head
;
and
he
began
to
pace
the
room
,
glancing
occasionally
at
*NL*
the
Mason
.
``
Yes
,
I
never
thought
of
it
,
but
I
have
led
a
contemptible
*NL*
and
profligate
life
,
though
I
did
not
like
it
and
did
not
want
to
,
''
*NL*
thought
Pierre
.
``
But
this
man
knows
the
truth
and
,
if
he
wished
to
,
*NL*
could
disclose
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
say
this
to
the
Mason
,
but
did
not
dare
to
.
The
*NL*
traveler
,
having
packed
his
things
with
his
practiced
hands
,
began
*NL*
fastening
his
coat
.
When
he
had
finished
,
he
turned
to
Bezukhov
,
and
*NL*
said
in
a
tone
of
indifferent
politeness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
to
now
,
my
dear
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
...
I
'm
going
to
Petersburg
,
''
answered
Pierre
,
in
a
childlike
,
*NL*
hesitating
voice
.
``
I
thank
you
.
I
agree
with
all
you
have
said
.
But
do
*NL*
not
suppose
me
to
be
so
bad
.
With
my
whole
soul
I
wish
to
be
what
you
*NL*
would
have
me
be
,
but
I
have
never
had
help
from
anyone
...
But
it
is
I
,
*NL*
above
all
,
who
am
to
blame
for
everything
.
Help
me
,
teach
me
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
I
may
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
could
not
go
on
.
He
gulped
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mason
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
,
evidently
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
comes
from
God
alone
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
such
measure
of
help
as
our
*NL*
Order
can
bestow
it
will
render
you
,
my
dear
sir

You
are
going
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Hand
this
to
Count
Willarski
''
-LRB-
he
took
out
his
notebook
and
*NL*
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
folded
in
four
-RRB-
.
``
Allow
me
*NL*
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
.
When
you
reach
the
capital
,
first
of
all
*NL*
devote
some
time
to
solitude
and
self-examination
and
do
not
resume
your
*NL*
former
way
of
life
.
And
now
I
wish
you
a
good
journey
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
seeing
that
his
servant
had
entered
...
``
and
success

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveler
was
Joseph
Alexeevich
Bazdeev
,
as
Pierre
saw
from
the
*NL*
postmaster
's
book
.
Bazdeev
had
been
one
of
the
best-known
Freemasons
and
*NL*
Martinists
,
even
in
Novikov
's
time
.
For
a
long
while
after
he
had
gone
,
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
go
to
bed
or
order
horses
but
paced
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
pondering
over
his
vicious
past
,
and
with
a
rapturous
sense
of
beginning
*NL*
anew
pictured
to
himself
the
blissful
,
irreproachable
,
virtuous
future
*NL*
that
seemed
to
him
so
easy
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
vicious
*NL*
only
because
he
had
somehow
forgotten
how
good
it
is
to
be
virtuous
.
Not
*NL*
a
trace
of
his
former
doubts
remained
in
his
soul
.
He
firmly
believed
in
*NL*
the
possibility
of
the
brotherhood
of
men
united
in
the
aim
of
*NL*
supporting
one
another
in
the
path
of
virtue
,
and
that
is
how
*NL*
Freemasonry
presented
itself
to
him
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
Petersburg
Pierre
did
not
let
anyone
know
of
his
arrival
,
he
*NL*
went
nowhere
and
spent
whole
days
in
reading
Thomas
a
Kempis
,
whose
book
*NL*
had
been
sent
him
by
someone
unknown
.
One
thing
he
continually
realized
*NL*
as
he
read
that
book
:
the
joy
,
hitherto
unknown
to
him
,
of
believing
in
*NL*
the
possibility
of
attaining
perfection
,
and
in
the
possibility
of
*NL*
active
brotherly
love
among
men
,
which
Joseph
Alexeevich
had
revealed
to
*NL*
him
.
A
week
after
his
arrival
,
the
young
Polish
count
,
Willarski
,
whom
*NL*
Pierre
had
known
slightly
in
Petersburg
society
,
came
into
his
room
one
*NL*
evening
in
the
official
and
ceremonious
manner
in
which
Dolokhov
's
*NL*
second
had
called
on
him
,
and
,
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
*NL*
satisfied
himself
that
there
was
nobody
else
in
the
room
,
addressed
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
and
an
offer
,
Count
,
''
he
said
without
*NL*
sitting
down
.
``
A
person
of
very
high
standing
in
our
Brotherhood
has
*NL*
made
application
for
you
to
be
received
into
our
Order
before
the
usual
*NL*
term
and
has
proposed
to
me
to
be
your
sponsor
.
I
consider
it
a
sacred
*NL*
duty
to
fulfill
that
person
's
wishes
.
Do
you
wish
to
enter
the
*NL*
Brotherhood
of
Freemasons
under
my
sponsorship
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cold
,
austere
tone
of
this
man
,
whom
he
had
almost
always
before
met
*NL*
at
balls
,
amiably
smiling
in
the
society
of
the
most
brilliant
women
,
*NL*
surprised
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
wish
it
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willarski
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
question
,
Count
,
''
he
said
,
``
which
I
beg
you
to
answer
in
all
*NL*
sincerity
--
not
as
a
future
Mason
but
as
an
honest
man
:
have
you
*NL*
renounced
your
former
convictions
--
do
you
believe
in
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
yes
,
I
believe
in
God
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
...
''
began
Willarski
,
but
Pierre
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
believe
in
God
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
we
can
go
,
''
said
Willarski
.
``
My
carriage
is
at
your
*NL*
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Willarski
was
silent
throughout
the
drive
.
To
Pierre
's
inquiries
as
to
*NL*
what
he
must
do
and
how
he
should
answer
,
Willarski
only
replied
that
*NL*
brothers
more
worthy
than
he
would
test
him
and
that
Pierre
had
only
to
*NL*
tell
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
entered
the
courtyard
of
a
large
house
where
the
Lodge
had
its
*NL*
headquarters
,
and
having
ascended
a
dark
staircase
,
they
entered
a
small
*NL*
well-lit
anteroom
where
they
took
off
their
cloaks
without
the
aid
of
a
*NL*
servant
.
From
there
they
passed
into
another
room
.
A
man
in
strange
*NL*
attire
appeared
at
the
door
.
Willarski
,
stepping
toward
him
,
said
*NL*
something
to
him
in
French
in
an
undertone
and
then
went
up
to
a
small
*NL*
wardrobe
in
which
Pierre
noticed
garments
such
as
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
before
.
Having
taken
a
kerchief
from
the
cupboard
,
Willarski
bound
*NL*
Pierre
's
eyes
with
it
and
tied
it
in
a
knot
behind
,
catching
some
hairs
*NL*
painfully
in
the
knot
.
Then
he
drew
his
face
down
,
kissed
him
,
and
*NL*
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
forward
.
The
hairs
tied
in
the
knot
hurt
*NL*
Pierre
and
there
were
lines
of
pain
on
his
face
and
a
shamefaced
smile
.
*NL*
His
huge
figure
,
with
arms
hanging
down
and
with
a
puckered
,
though
*NL*
smiling
face
,
moved
after
Willarski
with
uncertain
,
timid
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
led
him
about
ten
paces
,
Willarski
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
happens
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
bear
it
all
manfully
if
*NL*
you
have
firmly
resolved
to
join
our
Brotherhood
.
''
-LRB-
Pierre
nodded
*NL*
affirmatively
.
-RRB-
``
When
you
hear
a
knock
at
the
door
,
you
will
uncover
*NL*
your
eyes
,
''
added
Willarski
.
``
I
wish
you
courage
and
success
,
''
and
,
*NL*
pressing
Pierre
's
hand
,
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
Pierre
went
on
smiling
in
the
same
way
.
Once
or
twice
he
*NL*
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
hand
to
the
kerchief
,
as
if
*NL*
wishing
to
take
it
off
,
but
let
it
drop
again
.
The
five
minutes
spent
*NL*
with
his
eyes
bandaged
seemed
to
him
an
hour
.
His
arms
felt
numb
,
his
*NL*
legs
almost
gave
way
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
tired
out
.
He
*NL*
experienced
a
variety
of
most
complex
sensations
.
He
felt
afraid
of
what
*NL*
would
happen
to
him
and
still
more
afraid
of
showing
his
fear
.
He
felt
*NL*
curious
to
know
what
was
going
to
happen
and
what
would
be
revealed
to
*NL*
him
;
but
most
of
all
,
he
felt
joyful
that
the
moment
had
come
when
he
*NL*
would
at
last
start
on
that
path
of
regeneration
and
on
the
actively
*NL*
virtuous
life
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
since
he
met
Joseph
*NL*
Alexeevich
.
Loud
knocks
were
heard
at
the
door
.
Pierre
took
the
bandage
*NL*
off
his
eyes
and
glanced
around
him
.
The
room
was
in
black
darkness
,
*NL*
only
a
small
lamp
was
burning
inside
something
white
.
Pierre
went
nearer
*NL*
and
saw
that
the
lamp
stood
on
a
black
table
on
which
lay
an
open
book
.
*NL*
The
book
was
the
Gospel
,
and
the
white
thing
with
the
lamp
inside
was
a
*NL*
human
skull
with
its
cavities
and
teeth
.
After
reading
the
first
words
*NL*
of
the
Gospel
:
``
In
the
beginning
was
the
Word
and
the
Word
was
with
*NL*
God
,
''
Pierre
went
round
the
table
and
saw
a
large
open
box
filled
with
*NL*
something
.
It
was
a
coffin
with
bones
inside
.
He
was
not
at
all
*NL*
surprised
by
what
he
saw
.
Hoping
to
enter
on
an
entirely
new
life
quite
*NL*
unlike
the
old
one
,
he
expected
everything
to
be
unusual
,
even
more
*NL*
unusual
than
what
he
was
seeing
.
A
skull
,
a
coffin
,
the
Gospel
--
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
expected
all
this
and
even
more
.
Trying
to
*NL*
stimulate
his
emotions
he
looked
around
.
``
God
,
death
,
love
,
the
*NL*
brotherhood
of
man
,
''
he
kept
saying
to
himself
,
associating
these
words
*NL*
with
vague
yet
joyful
ideas
.
The
door
opened
and
someone
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
dim
light
,
to
which
Pierre
had
already
become
accustomed
,
he
saw
*NL*
a
rather
short
man
.
Having
evidently
come
from
the
light
into
the
*NL*
darkness
,
the
man
paused
,
then
moved
with
cautious
steps
toward
the
*NL*
table
and
placed
on
it
his
small
leather-gloved
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
short
man
had
on
a
white
leather
apron
which
covered
his
chest
and
*NL*
part
of
his
legs
;
he
had
on
a
kind
of
necklace
above
which
rose
a
high
*NL*
white
ruffle
,
outlining
his
rather
long
face
which
was
lit
up
from
*NL*
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
have
you
come
hither
?
''
asked
the
newcomer
,
turning
in
Pierre
's
*NL*
direction
at
a
slight
rustle
made
by
the
latter
.
``
Why
have
you
,
who
do
*NL*
not
believe
in
the
truth
of
the
light
and
who
have
not
seen
the
light
,
*NL*
come
here
?
What
do
you
seek
from
us
?
Wisdom
,
virtue
,
enlightenment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
stranger
came
in
,
Pierre
felt
a
*NL*
sense
of
awe
and
veneration
such
as
he
had
experienced
in
his
boyhood
at
*NL*
confession
;
he
felt
himself
in
the
presence
of
one
socially
a
complete
*NL*
stranger
,
yet
nearer
to
him
through
the
brotherhood
of
man
.
With
bated
*NL*
breath
and
beating
heart
he
moved
toward
the
Rhetor
-LRB-
by
which
name
the
*NL*
brother
who
prepared
a
seeker
for
entrance
into
the
Brotherhood
was
*NL*
known
-RRB-
.
Drawing
nearer
,
he
recognized
in
the
Rhetor
a
man
he
knew
,
*NL*
Smolyaninov
,
and
it
mortified
him
to
think
that
the
newcomer
was
an
*NL*
acquaintance
--
he
wished
him
simply
a
brother
and
a
virtuous
instructor
.
*NL*
For
a
long
time
he
could
not
utter
a
word
,
so
that
the
Rhetor
had
to
*NL*
repeat
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I.
.
.
I.
.
.
desire
regeneration
,
''
Pierre
uttered
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Smolyaninov
,
and
went
on
at
once
:
``
Have
you
any
idea
*NL*
of
the
means
by
which
our
holy
Order
will
help
you
to
reach
your
aim
?
''
*NL*
said
he
quietly
and
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
hope
...
for
guidance
...
help
...
in
regeneration
,
''
said
Pierre
,
*NL*
with
a
trembling
voice
and
some
difficulty
in
utterance
due
to
his
*NL*
excitement
and
to
being
unaccustomed
to
speak
of
abstract
matters
in
*NL*
Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
conception
of
Freemasonry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
Freemasonry
is
the
fraternity
and
equality
of
men
who
*NL*
have
virtuous
aims
,
''
said
Pierre
,
feeling
ashamed
of
the
inadequacy
of
*NL*
his
words
for
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
,
as
he
spoke
.
``
I
imagine
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
the
Rhetor
quickly
,
apparently
satisfied
with
this
answer
.
*NL*
``
Have
you
sought
for
means
of
attaining
your
aim
in
religion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
considered
it
erroneous
and
did
not
follow
it
,
''
said
Pierre
,
so
*NL*
softly
that
the
Rhetor
did
not
hear
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
.
``
I
have
been
an
atheist
,
''
answered
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
seeking
for
truth
in
order
to
follow
its
laws
in
your
life
,
*NL*
therefore
you
seek
wisdom
and
virtue
.
Is
that
not
so
?
''
said
the
Rhetor
,
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
assented
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rhetor
cleared
his
throat
,
crossed
his
gloved
hands
on
his
breast
,
*NL*
and
began
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
disclose
to
you
the
chief
aim
of
our
Order
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
*NL*
if
this
aim
coincides
with
yours
,
you
may
enter
our
Brotherhood
with
*NL*
profit
.
The
first
and
chief
object
of
our
Order
,
the
foundation
on
which
*NL*
it
rests
and
which
no
human
power
can
destroy
,
is
the
preservation
and
*NL*
handing
on
to
posterity
of
a
certain
important
mystery
...
which
has
come
*NL*
down
to
us
from
the
remotest
ages
,
even
from
the
first
man
--
a
mystery
on
*NL*
which
perhaps
the
fate
of
mankind
depends
.
But
since
this
mystery
is
of
*NL*
such
a
nature
that
nobody
can
know
or
use
it
unless
he
be
prepared
by
*NL*
long
and
diligent
self-purification
,
not
everyone
can
hope
to
attain
it
*NL*
quickly
.
Hence
we
have
a
secondary
aim
,
that
of
preparing
our
members
as
*NL*
much
as
possible
to
reform
their
hearts
,
to
purify
and
enlighten
their
*NL*
minds
,
by
means
handed
on
to
us
by
tradition
from
those
who
have
striven
*NL*
to
attain
this
mystery
,
and
thereby
to
render
them
capable
of
receiving
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
purifying
and
regenerating
our
members
we
try
,
thirdly
,
to
improve
*NL*
the
whole
human
race
,
offering
it
in
our
members
an
example
of
piety
and
*NL*
virtue
,
and
thereby
try
with
all
our
might
to
combat
the
evil
which
*NL*
sways
the
world
.
Think
this
over
and
I
will
come
to
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
combat
the
evil
which
sways
the
world
...
''
Pierre
repeated
,
and
a
*NL*
mental
image
of
his
future
activity
in
this
direction
rose
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
He
imagined
men
such
as
he
had
himself
been
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
he
*NL*
addressed
an
edifying
exhortation
to
them
.
He
imagined
to
himself
*NL*
vicious
and
unfortunate
people
whom
he
would
assist
by
word
and
deed
,
*NL*
imagined
oppressors
whose
victims
he
would
rescue
.
Of
the
three
objects
*NL*
mentioned
by
the
Rhetor
,
this
last
,
that
of
improving
mankind
,
*NL*
especially
appealed
to
Pierre
.
The
important
mystery
mentioned
by
the
*NL*
Rhetor
,
though
it
aroused
his
curiosity
,
did
not
seem
to
him
essential
,
*NL*
and
the
second
aim
,
that
of
purifying
and
regenerating
himself
,
did
not
*NL*
much
interest
him
because
at
that
moment
he
felt
with
delight
that
he
*NL*
was
already
perfectly
cured
of
his
former
faults
and
was
ready
for
all
*NL*
that
was
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
,
the
Rhetor
returned
to
inform
the
seeker
of
the
*NL*
seven
virtues
,
corresponding
to
the
seven
steps
of
Solomon
's
temple
,
*NL*
which
every
Freemason
should
cultivate
in
himself
.
These
virtues
were
:
*NL*
1
.
Discretion
,
the
keeping
of
the
secrets
of
the
Order
.
2
.
Obedience
to
*NL*
those
of
higher
ranks
in
the
Order
.
3
.
Morality
.
4
.
Love
of
mankind
.
5
.
*NL*
Courage
.
6
.
Generosity
.
7
.
The
love
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
seventh
place
,
try
,
by
the
frequent
thought
of
death
,
''
the
*NL*
Rhetor
said
,
``
to
bring
yourself
to
regard
it
not
as
a
dreaded
foe
,
but
*NL*
as
a
friend
that
frees
the
soul
grown
weary
in
the
labors
of
virtue
from
*NL*
this
distressful
life
,
and
leads
it
to
its
place
of
recompense
and
*NL*
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
must
be
so
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
when
after
these
words
the
*NL*
Rhetor
went
away
,
leaving
him
to
solitary
meditation
.
``
It
must
be
so
,
*NL*
but
I
am
still
so
weak
that
I
love
my
life
,
the
meaning
of
which
is
only
*NL*
now
gradually
opening
before
me
.
''
But
five
of
the
other
virtues
which
*NL*
Pierre
recalled
,
counting
them
on
his
fingers
,
he
felt
already
in
his
*NL*
soul
:
courage
,
generosity
,
morality
,
love
of
mankind
,
and
especially
*NL*
obedience
--
which
did
not
even
seem
to
him
a
virtue
,
but
a
joy
.
-LRB-
He
now
*NL*
felt
so
glad
to
be
free
from
his
own
lawlessness
and
to
submit
his
will
*NL*
to
those
who
knew
the
indubitable
truth
.
-RRB-
He
forgot
what
the
seventh
*NL*
virtue
was
and
could
not
recall
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
time
the
Rhetor
came
back
more
quickly
and
asked
Pierre
*NL*
whether
he
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
and
determined
to
submit
to
*NL*
all
that
would
be
required
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
for
everything
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
also
inform
you
,
''
said
the
Rhetor
,
``
that
our
Order
delivers
its
*NL*
teaching
not
in
words
only
but
also
by
other
means
,
which
may
perhaps
*NL*
have
a
stronger
effect
on
the
sincere
seeker
after
wisdom
and
virtue
*NL*
than
mere
words
.
This
chamber
with
what
you
see
therein
should
already
*NL*
have
suggested
to
your
heart
,
if
it
is
sincere
,
more
than
words
could
*NL*
do
.
You
will
perhaps
also
see
in
your
further
initiation
a
like
method
*NL*
of
enlightenment
.
Our
Order
imitates
the
ancient
societies
that
*NL*
explained
their
teaching
by
hieroglyphics
.
A
hieroglyph
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Rhetor
,
``
is
an
emblem
of
something
not
cognizable
by
the
senses
but
*NL*
which
possesses
qualities
resembling
those
of
the
symbol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
knew
very
well
what
a
hieroglyph
was
,
but
dared
not
speak
.
He
*NL*
listened
to
the
Rhetor
in
silence
,
feeling
from
all
he
said
that
his
*NL*
ordeal
was
about
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
resolved
,
I
must
begin
your
initiation
,
''
said
the
Rhetor
*NL*
coming
closer
to
Pierre
.
``
In
token
of
generosity
I
ask
you
to
give
me
*NL*
all
your
valuables
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
nothing
here
,
''
replied
Pierre
,
supposing
that
he
was
asked
*NL*
to
give
up
all
he
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
have
with
you
:
watch
,
money
,
rings
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
quickly
took
out
his
purse
and
watch
,
but
could
not
manage
for
*NL*
some
time
to
get
the
wedding
ring
off
his
fat
finger
.
When
that
had
been
*NL*
done
,
the
Rhetor
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
token
of
obedience
,
I
ask
you
to
undress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
off
his
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
left
boot
according
to
the
*NL*
Rhetor
's
instructions
.
The
Mason
drew
the
shirt
back
from
Pierre
's
left
*NL*
breast
,
and
stooping
down
pulled
up
the
left
leg
of
his
trousers
to
*NL*
above
the
knee
.
Pierre
hurriedly
began
taking
off
his
right
boot
also
*NL*
and
was
going
to
tuck
up
the
other
trouser
leg
to
save
this
stranger
the
*NL*
trouble
,
but
the
Mason
told
him
that
was
not
necessary
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
slipper
for
his
left
foot
.
With
a
childlike
smile
of
embarrassment
,
*NL*
doubt
,
and
self-derision
,
which
appeared
on
his
face
against
his
will
,
*NL*
Pierre
stood
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
legs
apart
,
before
his
*NL*
brother
Rhetor
,
and
awaited
his
further
commands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
in
token
of
candor
,
I
ask
you
to
reveal
to
me
your
chief
*NL*
passion
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
passion
!
I
have
had
so
many
,
''
replied
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
passion
which
more
than
all
others
caused
you
to
waver
on
the
path
*NL*
of
virtue
,
''
said
the
Mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
paused
,
seeking
a
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wine
?
Gluttony
?
Idleness
?
Laziness
?
Irritability
?
Anger
?
Women
?
''
He
*NL*
went
over
his
vices
in
his
mind
,
not
knowing
to
which
of
them
to
give
*NL*
the
pre-eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
,
scarcely
audible
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mason
did
not
move
and
for
a
long
time
said
nothing
after
this
*NL*
answer
.
At
last
he
moved
up
to
Pierre
and
,
taking
the
kerchief
that
lay
*NL*
on
the
table
,
again
bound
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
last
time
I
say
to
you
--
turn
all
your
attention
upon
yourself
,
*NL*
put
a
bridle
on
your
senses
,
and
seek
blessedness
,
not
in
passion
but
in
*NL*
your
own
heart
.
The
source
of
blessedness
is
not
without
us
but
*NL*
within
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
already
long
been
feeling
in
himself
that
refreshing
source
*NL*
of
blessedness
which
now
flooded
his
heart
with
glad
emotion
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
there
came
into
the
dark
chamber
to
fetch
Pierre
,
not
*NL*
the
Rhetor
but
Pierre
's
sponsor
,
Willarski
,
whom
he
recognized
by
his
*NL*
voice
.
To
fresh
questions
as
to
the
firmness
of
his
resolution
Pierre
*NL*
replied
:
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
agree
,
''
and
with
a
beaming
,
childlike
smile
,
his
*NL*
fat
chest
uncovered
,
stepping
unevenly
and
timidly
in
one
slippered
and
*NL*
one
booted
foot
,
he
advanced
,
while
Willarski
held
a
sword
to
his
bare
*NL*
chest
.
He
was
conducted
from
that
room
along
passages
that
turned
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
and
was
at
last
brought
to
the
doors
of
the
*NL*
Lodge
.
Willarski
coughed
,
he
was
answered
by
the
masonic
knock
with
*NL*
mallets
,
the
doors
opened
before
them
.
A
bass
voice
-LRB-
Pierre
was
still
*NL*
blindfolded
-RRB-
questioned
him
as
to
who
he
was
,
when
and
where
he
was
*NL*
born
,
and
so
on
.
Then
he
was
again
led
somewhere
still
blindfolded
,
and
*NL*
as
they
went
along
he
was
told
allegories
of
the
toils
of
his
*NL*
pilgrimage
,
of
holy
friendship
,
of
the
Eternal
Architect
of
the
*NL*
universe
,
and
of
the
courage
with
which
he
should
endure
toils
and
*NL*
dangers
.
During
these
wanderings
,
Pierre
noticed
that
he
was
spoken
of
*NL*
now
as
the
``
Seeker
,
''
now
as
the
``
Sufferer
,
''
and
now
as
the
``
Postulant
,
''
*NL*
to
the
accompaniment
of
various
knockings
with
mallets
and
swords
.
As
he
*NL*
was
being
led
up
to
some
object
he
noticed
a
hesitation
and
uncertainty
*NL*
among
his
conductors
.
He
heard
those
around
him
disputing
in
whispers
*NL*
and
one
of
them
insisting
that
he
should
be
led
along
a
certain
carpet
.
*NL*
After
that
they
took
his
right
hand
,
placed
it
on
something
,
and
told
*NL*
him
to
hold
a
pair
of
compasses
to
his
left
breast
with
the
other
hand
*NL*
and
to
repeat
after
someone
who
read
aloud
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
the
*NL*
laws
of
the
Order
.
The
candles
were
then
extinguished
and
some
spirit
*NL*
lighted
,
as
Pierre
knew
by
the
smell
,
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
now
*NL*
see
the
lesser
light
.
The
bandage
was
taken
off
his
eyes
and
,
by
the
*NL*
faint
light
of
the
burning
spirit
,
Pierre
,
as
in
a
dream
,
saw
several
*NL*
men
standing
before
him
,
wearing
aprons
like
the
Rhetor
's
and
holding
*NL*
swords
in
their
hands
pointed
at
his
breast
.
Among
them
stood
a
man
*NL*
whose
white
shirt
was
stained
with
blood
.
On
seeing
this
,
Pierre
moved
*NL*
forward
with
his
breast
toward
the
swords
,
meaning
them
to
pierce
it
.
*NL*
But
the
swords
were
drawn
back
from
him
and
he
was
at
once
blindfolded
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
thou
hast
seen
the
lesser
light
,
''
uttered
a
voice
.
Then
the
candles
*NL*
were
relit
and
he
was
told
that
he
would
see
the
full
light
;
the
bandage
*NL*
was
again
removed
and
more
than
ten
voices
said
together
:
``
Sic
transit
*NL*
gloria
mundi
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gradually
began
to
recover
himself
and
looked
about
at
the
room
*NL*
and
at
the
people
in
it
.
Round
a
long
table
covered
with
black
sat
some
*NL*
twelve
men
in
garments
like
those
he
had
already
seen
.
Some
of
them
*NL*
Pierre
had
met
in
Petersburg
society
.
In
the
President
's
chair
sat
a
*NL*
young
man
he
did
not
know
,
with
a
peculiar
cross
hanging
from
his
neck
.
*NL*
On
his
right
sat
the
Italian
abbe
whom
Pierre
had
met
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
two
years
before
.
There
were
also
present
a
very
distinguished
dignitary
*NL*
and
a
Swiss
who
had
formerly
been
tutor
at
the
Kuragins
'
.
All
maintained
*NL*
a
solemn
silence
,
listening
to
the
words
of
the
President
,
who
held
a
*NL*
mallet
in
his
hand
.
Let
into
the
wall
was
a
star-shaped
light
.
At
one
*NL*
side
of
the
table
was
a
small
carpet
with
various
figures
worked
upon
*NL*
it
,
at
the
other
was
something
resembling
an
altar
on
which
lay
a
*NL*
Testament
and
a
skull
.
Round
it
stood
seven
large
candlesticks
like
*NL*
those
used
in
churches
.
Two
of
the
brothers
led
Pierre
up
to
the
altar
,
*NL*
placed
his
feet
at
right
angles
,
and
bade
him
lie
down
,
saying
that
he
*NL*
must
prostrate
himself
at
the
Gates
of
the
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
first
receive
the
trowel
,
''
whispered
one
of
the
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hush
,
please
!
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
perplexed
,
looked
round
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
without
*NL*
obeying
,
and
suddenly
doubts
arose
in
his
mind
.
``
Where
am
I
?
What
am
I
*NL*
doing
?
Are
n't
they
laughing
at
me
?
Sha
n't
I
be
ashamed
to
remember
*NL*
this
?
''
But
these
doubts
only
lasted
a
moment
.
Pierre
glanced
at
the
*NL*
serious
faces
of
those
around
,
remembered
all
he
had
already
gone
*NL*
through
,
and
realized
that
he
could
not
stop
halfway
.
He
was
aghast
at
*NL*
his
hesitation
and
,
trying
to
arouse
his
former
devotional
feeling
,
*NL*
prostrated
himself
before
the
Gates
of
the
Temple
.
And
really
,
the
*NL*
feeling
of
devotion
returned
to
him
even
more
strongly
than
before
.
When
*NL*
he
had
lain
there
some
time
,
he
was
told
to
get
up
,
and
a
white
leather
*NL*
apron
,
such
as
the
others
wore
,
was
put
on
him
:
he
was
given
a
trowel
*NL*
and
three
pairs
of
gloves
,
and
then
the
Grand
Master
addressed
him
.
He
*NL*
told
him
that
he
should
try
to
do
nothing
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
that
*NL*
apron
,
which
symbolized
strength
and
purity
;
then
of
the
unexplained
*NL*
trowel
,
he
told
him
to
toil
with
it
to
cleanse
his
own
heart
from
vice
,
*NL*
and
indulgently
to
smooth
with
it
the
heart
of
his
neighbor
.
As
to
the
*NL*
first
pair
of
gloves
,
a
man
's
,
he
said
that
Pierre
could
not
know
their
*NL*
meaning
but
must
keep
them
.
The
second
pair
of
man
's
gloves
he
was
to
*NL*
wear
at
the
meetings
,
and
finally
of
the
third
,
a
pair
of
women
's
*NL*
gloves
,
he
said
:
``
Dear
brother
,
these
woman
's
gloves
are
intended
for
*NL*
you
too
.
Give
them
to
the
woman
whom
you
shall
honor
most
of
all
.
This
*NL*
gift
will
be
a
pledge
of
your
purity
of
heart
to
her
whom
you
select
to
*NL*
be
your
worthy
helpmeet
in
Masonry
.
''
And
after
a
pause
,
he
added
:
``
But
*NL*
beware
,
dear
brother
,
that
these
gloves
do
not
deck
hands
that
are
*NL*
unclean
.
''
While
the
Grand
Master
said
these
last
words
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Pierre
that
he
grew
embarrassed
.
Pierre
himself
grew
still
more
*NL*
confused
,
blushed
like
a
child
till
tears
came
to
his
eyes
,
began
*NL*
looking
about
him
uneasily
,
and
an
awkward
pause
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
silence
was
broken
by
one
of
the
brethren
,
who
led
Pierre
up
to
the
*NL*
rug
and
began
reading
to
him
from
a
manuscript
book
an
explanation
of
*NL*
all
the
figures
on
it
:
the
sun
,
the
moon
,
a
hammer
,
a
plumb
line
,
a
*NL*
trowel
,
a
rough
stone
and
a
squared
stone
,
a
pillar
,
three
windows
,
and
*NL*
so
on
.
Then
a
place
was
assigned
to
Pierre
,
he
was
shown
the
signs
of
*NL*
the
Lodge
,
told
the
password
,
and
at
last
was
permitted
to
sit
down
.
The
*NL*
Grand
Master
began
reading
the
statutes
.
They
were
very
long
,
and
*NL*
Pierre
,
from
joy
,
agitation
,
and
embarrassment
,
was
not
in
a
state
to
*NL*
understand
what
was
being
read
.
He
managed
to
follow
only
the
last
words
*NL*
of
the
statutes
and
these
remained
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
our
temples
we
recognize
no
other
distinctions
,
''
read
the
Grand
*NL*
Master
,
``
but
those
between
virtue
and
vice
.
Beware
of
making
any
*NL*
distinctions
which
may
infringe
equality
.
Fly
to
a
brother
's
aid
whoever
*NL*
he
may
be
,
exhort
him
who
goeth
astray
,
raise
him
that
falleth
,
never
*NL*
bear
malice
or
enmity
toward
thy
brother
.
Be
kindly
and
courteous
.
*NL*
Kindle
in
all
hearts
the
flame
of
virtue
.
Share
thy
happiness
with
thy
*NL*
neighbor
,
and
may
envy
never
dim
the
purity
of
that
bliss
.
Forgive
thy
*NL*
enemy
,
do
not
avenge
thyself
except
by
doing
him
good
.
Thus
fulfilling
*NL*
the
highest
law
thou
shalt
regain
traces
of
the
ancient
dignity
which
*NL*
thou
hast
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
finished
and
,
getting
up
,
embraced
and
kissed
Pierre
,
who
,
with
tears
*NL*
of
joy
in
his
eyes
,
looked
round
him
,
not
knowing
how
to
answer
the
*NL*
congratulations
and
greetings
from
acquaintances
that
met
him
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
He
acknowledged
no
acquaintances
but
saw
in
all
these
men
only
*NL*
brothers
,
and
burned
with
impatience
to
set
to
work
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
rapped
with
his
mallet
.
All
the
Masons
sat
down
in
*NL*
their
places
,
and
one
of
them
read
an
exhortation
on
the
necessity
of
*NL*
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Master
proposed
that
the
last
duty
should
be
performed
,
and
*NL*
the
distinguished
dignitary
who
bore
the
title
of
``
Collector
of
Alms
''
*NL*
went
round
to
all
the
brothers
.
Pierre
would
have
liked
to
subscribe
all
*NL*
he
had
,
but
fearing
that
it
might
look
like
pride
subscribed
the
same
*NL*
amount
as
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
was
at
an
end
,
and
on
reaching
home
Pierre
felt
as
if
he
had
*NL*
returned
from
a
long
journey
on
which
he
had
spent
dozens
of
years
,
had
*NL*
become
completely
changed
,
and
had
quite
left
behind
his
former
habits
*NL*
and
way
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
he
had
been
received
into
the
Lodge
,
Pierre
was
sitting
at
*NL*
home
reading
a
book
and
trying
to
fathom
the
significance
of
the
Square
,
*NL*
one
side
of
which
symbolized
God
,
another
moral
things
,
a
third
physical
*NL*
things
,
and
the
fourth
a
combination
of
these
.
Now
and
then
his
*NL*
attention
wandered
from
the
book
and
the
Square
and
he
formed
in
*NL*
imagination
a
new
plan
of
life
.
On
the
previous
evening
at
the
Lodge
,
he
*NL*
had
heard
that
a
rumor
of
his
duel
had
reached
the
Emperor
and
that
it
*NL*
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
leave
Petersburg
.
Pierre
proposed
going
to
his
*NL*
estates
in
the
south
and
there
attending
to
the
welfare
of
his
serfs
.
He
*NL*
was
joyfully
planning
this
new
life
,
when
Prince
Vasili
suddenly
entered
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
what
have
you
been
up
to
in
Moscow
?
Why
have
you
*NL*
quarreled
with
Helene
,
mon
cher
?
You
are
under
a
delusion
,
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
as
he
entered
.
``
I
know
all
about
it
,
and
I
can
tell
you
*NL*
positively
that
Helene
is
as
innocent
before
you
as
Christ
was
before
*NL*
the
Jews
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
about
to
reply
,
but
Prince
Vasili
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
n't
you
simply
come
straight
to
me
as
to
a
friend
?
I
know
*NL*
all
about
it
and
understand
it
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
behaved
as
becomes
a
*NL*
man
who
values
his
honor
,
perhaps
too
hastily
,
but
we
wo
n't
go
into
*NL*
that
.
But
consider
the
position
in
which
you
are
placing
her
and
me
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
society
,
and
even
of
the
court
,
''
he
added
,
lowering
his
*NL*
voice
.
``
She
is
living
in
Moscow
and
you
are
here
.
Remember
,
dear
boy
,
''
*NL*
and
he
drew
Pierre
's
arm
downwards
,
``
it
is
simply
a
misunderstanding
.
I
*NL*
expect
you
feel
it
so
yourself
.
Let
us
write
her
a
letter
at
once
,
and
*NL*
she
'll
come
here
and
all
will
be
explained
,
or
else
,
my
dear
boy
,
let
me
*NL*
tell
you
it
's
quite
likely
you
'll
have
to
suffer
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
gave
Pierre
a
significant
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
from
reliable
sources
that
the
Dowager
Empress
is
taking
a
keen
*NL*
interest
in
the
whole
affair
.
You
know
she
is
very
gracious
to
Helene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
tried
several
times
to
speak
,
but
,
on
one
hand
,
Prince
Vasili
did
*NL*
not
let
him
and
,
on
the
other
,
Pierre
himself
feared
to
begin
to
speak
*NL*
in
the
tone
of
decided
refusal
and
disagreement
in
which
he
had
firmly
*NL*
resolved
to
answer
his
father-in-law
.
Moreover
,
the
words
of
the
masonic
*NL*
statutes
,
``
be
kindly
and
courteous
,
''
recurred
to
him
.
He
blinked
,
went
*NL*
red
,
got
up
and
sat
down
again
,
struggling
with
himself
to
do
what
was
*NL*
for
him
the
most
difficult
thing
in
life
--
to
say
an
unpleasant
thing
to
*NL*
a
man
's
face
,
to
say
what
the
other
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
did
not
*NL*
expect
.
He
was
so
used
to
submitting
to
Prince
Vasili
's
tone
of
careless
*NL*
self-assurance
that
he
felt
he
would
be
unable
to
withstand
it
now
,
but
*NL*
he
also
felt
that
on
what
he
said
now
his
future
depended
--
whether
he
*NL*
would
follow
the
same
old
road
,
or
that
new
path
so
attractively
shown
*NL*
him
by
the
Masons
,
on
which
he
firmly
believed
he
would
be
reborn
to
a
*NL*
new
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
dear
boy
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
playfully
,
``
say
`
yes
,
'
and
I
'll
*NL*
write
to
her
myself
,
and
we
will
kill
the
fatted
calf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Prince
Vasili
had
finished
his
playful
speech
,
Pierre
,
*NL*
without
looking
at
him
,
and
with
a
kind
of
fury
that
made
him
like
his
*NL*
father
,
muttered
in
a
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
I
did
not
ask
you
here
.
Go
,
please
go
!
''
And
he
jumped
up
and
*NL*
opened
the
door
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
he
repeated
,
amazed
at
himself
and
glad
to
see
the
look
of
*NL*
confusion
and
fear
that
showed
itself
on
Prince
Vasili
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
Are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
the
quivering
voice
repeated
.
And
Prince
Vasili
had
to
go
without
*NL*
receiving
any
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
,
Pierre
,
having
taken
leave
of
his
new
friends
,
the
Masons
,
*NL*
and
leaving
large
sums
of
money
with
them
for
alms
,
went
away
to
his
*NL*
estates
.
His
new
brethren
gave
him
letters
to
the
Kiev
and
Odessa
Masons
*NL*
and
promised
to
write
to
him
and
guide
him
in
his
new
activity

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
duel
between
Pierre
and
Dolokhov
was
hushed
up
and
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
severity
regarding
duels
at
that
time
,
neither
the
principals
*NL*
nor
their
seconds
suffered
for
it
.
But
the
story
of
the
duel
,
confirmed
*NL*
by
Pierre
's
rupture
with
his
wife
,
was
the
talk
of
society
.
Pierre
who
*NL*
had
been
regarded
with
patronizing
condescension
when
he
was
an
*NL*
illegitimate
son
,
and
petted
and
extolled
when
he
was
the
best
match
in
*NL*
Russia
,
had
sunk
greatly
in
the
esteem
of
society
after
his
marriage
--
*NL*
when
the
marriageable
daughters
and
their
mothers
had
nothing
to
hope
*NL*
from
him
--
especially
as
he
did
not
know
how
,
and
did
not
wish
,
to
court
*NL*
society
's
favor
.
Now
he
alone
was
blamed
for
what
had
happened
,
he
was
*NL*
said
to
be
insanely
jealous
and
subject
like
his
father
to
fits
of
*NL*
bloodthirsty
rage
.
And
when
after
Pierre
's
departure
Helene
returned
to
*NL*
Petersburg
,
she
was
received
by
all
her
acquaintances
not
only
*NL*
cordially
,
but
even
with
a
shade
of
deference
due
to
her
misfortune
.
*NL*
When
conversation
turned
on
her
husband
Helene
assumed
a
dignified
*NL*
expression
,
which
with
characteristic
tact
she
had
acquired
though
she
*NL*
did
not
understand
its
significance
.
This
expression
suggested
that
she
*NL*
had
resolved
to
endure
her
troubles
uncomplainingly
and
that
her
husband
*NL*
was
a
cross
laid
upon
her
by
God
.
Prince
Vasili
expressed
his
opinion
*NL*
more
openly
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
Pierre
was
mentioned
and
,
*NL*
pointing
to
his
forehead
,
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bit
touched
--
I
always
said
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
from
the
first
,
''
declared
Anna
Pavlovna
referring
to
Pierre
,
``
I
*NL*
said
at
the
time
and
before
anyone
else
''
-LRB-
she
insisted
on
her
priority
-RRB-
*NL*
``
that
that
senseless
young
man
was
spoiled
by
the
depraved
ideas
of
*NL*
these
days
.
I
said
so
even
at
the
time
when
everybody
was
in
raptures
*NL*
about
him
,
when
he
had
just
returned
from
abroad
,
and
when
,
if
you
*NL*
remember
,
he
posed
as
a
sort
of
Marat
at
one
of
my
soirees
.
And
how
has
*NL*
it
ended
?
I
was
against
this
marriage
even
then
and
foretold
all
that
*NL*
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
continued
to
give
on
free
evenings
the
same
kind
of
*NL*
soirees
as
before
--
such
as
she
alone
had
the
gift
of
arranging
--
at
which
*NL*
was
to
be
found
``
the
cream
of
really
good
society
,
the
bloom
of
the
*NL*
intellectual
essence
of
Petersburg
,
''
as
she
herself
put
it
.
Besides
this
*NL*
refined
selection
of
society
Anna
Pavlovna
's
receptions
were
also
*NL*
distinguished
by
the
fact
that
she
always
presented
some
new
and
*NL*
interesting
person
to
the
visitors
and
that
nowhere
else
was
the
state
*NL*
of
the
political
thermometer
of
legitimate
Petersburg
court
society
so
*NL*
dearly
and
distinctly
indicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
the
end
of
1806
,
when
all
the
sad
details
of
Napoleon
's
*NL*
destruction
of
the
Prussian
army
at
Jena
and
Auerstadt
and
the
surrender
*NL*
of
most
of
the
Prussian
fortresses
had
been
received
,
when
our
troops
*NL*
had
already
entered
Prussia
and
our
second
war
with
Napoleon
was
*NL*
beginning
,
Anna
Pavlovna
gave
one
of
her
soirees
.
The
``
cream
of
really
*NL*
good
society
''
consisted
of
the
fascinating
Helene
,
forsaken
by
her
*NL*
husband
,
Mortemart
,
the
delightful
Prince
Hippolyte
who
had
just
*NL*
returned
from
Vienna
,
two
diplomatists
,
the
old
aunt
,
a
young
man
*NL*
referred
to
in
that
drawing
room
as
``
a
man
of
great
merit
''
-LRB-
un
homme
de
*NL*
beaucoup
de
merite
-RRB-
,
a
newly
appointed
maid
of
honor
and
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
several
other
less
noteworthy
persons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
novelty
Anna
Pavlovna
was
setting
before
her
guests
that
evening
was
*NL*
Boris
Drubetskoy
,
who
had
just
arrived
as
a
special
messenger
from
the
*NL*
Prussian
army
and
was
aide-de-camp
to
a
very
important
personage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
temperature
shown
by
the
political
thermometer
to
the
company
that
*NL*
evening
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
the
European
sovereigns
and
commanders
may
do
to
countenance
*NL*
Bonaparte
,
and
to
cause
me
,
and
us
in
general
,
annoyance
and
*NL*
mortification
,
our
opinion
of
Bonaparte
can
not
alter
.
We
shall
not
cease
*NL*
to
express
our
sincere
views
on
that
subject
,
and
can
only
say
to
the
*NL*
King
of
Prussia
and
others
:
`
So
much
the
worse
for
you
.
Tu
l'as
voulu
,
*NL*
George
Dandin
,
'
that
's
all
we
have
to
say
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Boris
,
who
was
to
be
served
up
to
the
guests
,
entered
the
drawing
*NL*
room
,
almost
all
the
company
had
assembled
,
and
the
conversation
,
guided
*NL*
by
Anna
Pavlovna
,
was
about
our
diplomatic
relations
with
Austria
and
*NL*
the
hope
of
an
alliance
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
,
grown
more
manly
and
looking
fresh
,
rosy
and
self-possessed
,
*NL*
entered
the
drawing
room
elegantly
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
an
aide-de
-
*NL*
camp
and
was
duly
conducted
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
aunt
and
then
*NL*
brought
back
to
the
general
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
gave
him
her
shriveled
hand
to
kiss
and
introduced
him
to
*NL*
several
persons
whom
he
did
not
know
,
giving
him
a
whispered
description
*NL*
of
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Hippolyte
Kuragin
,
M.
Krug
,
the
charge
d'affaires
from
*NL*
Copenhagen
--
a
profound
intellect
,
''
and
simply
,
``
Mr.
Shitov
--
a
man
of
*NL*
great
merit
''
--
this
of
the
man
usually
so
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
Anna
Mikhaylovna
's
efforts
,
his
own
tastes
,
and
the
*NL*
peculiarities
of
his
reserved
nature
,
Boris
had
managed
during
his
*NL*
service
to
place
himself
very
advantageously
.
He
was
aide-de-camp
to
a
*NL*
very
important
personage
,
had
been
sent
on
a
very
important
mission
to
*NL*
Prussia
,
and
had
just
returned
from
there
as
a
special
messenger
.
He
had
*NL*
become
thoroughly
conversant
with
that
unwritten
code
with
which
he
had
*NL*
been
so
pleased
at
Olmutz
and
according
to
which
an
ensign
might
rank
*NL*
incomparably
higher
than
a
general
,
and
according
to
which
what
was
*NL*
needed
for
success
in
the
service
was
not
effort
or
work
,
or
courage
,
or
*NL*
perseverance
,
but
only
the
knowledge
of
how
to
get
on
with
those
who
can
*NL*
grant
rewards
,
and
he
was
himself
often
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
*NL*
success
and
at
the
inability
of
others
to
understand
these
things
.
In
*NL*
consequence
of
this
discovery
his
whole
manner
of
life
,
all
his
*NL*
relations
with
old
friends
,
all
his
plans
for
his
future
,
were
*NL*
completely
altered
.
He
was
not
rich
,
but
would
spend
his
last
groat
to
*NL*
be
better
dressed
than
others
,
and
would
rather
deprive
himself
of
many
*NL*
pleasures
than
allow
himself
to
be
seen
in
a
shabby
equipage
or
appear
*NL*
in
the
streets
of
Petersburg
in
an
old
uniform
.
He
made
friends
with
and
*NL*
sought
the
acquaintance
of
only
those
above
him
in
position
and
who
*NL*
could
therefore
be
of
use
to
him
.
He
liked
Petersburg
and
despised
*NL*
Moscow
.
The
remembrance
of
the
Rostovs
'
house
and
of
his
childish
love
*NL*
for
Natasha
was
unpleasant
to
him
and
he
had
not
once
been
to
see
the
*NL*
Rostovs
since
the
day
of
his
departure
for
the
army
.
To
be
in
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
's
drawing
room
he
considered
an
important
step
up
in
the
*NL*
service
,
and
he
at
once
understood
his
role
,
letting
his
hostess
make
*NL*
use
of
whatever
interest
he
had
to
offer
.
He
himself
carefully
scanned
*NL*
each
face
,
appraising
the
possibilities
of
establishing
intimacy
with
*NL*
each
of
those
present
,
and
the
advantages
that
might
accrue
.
He
took
the
*NL*
seat
indicated
to
him
beside
the
fair
Helene
and
listened
to
the
general
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vienna
considers
the
bases
of
the
proposed
treaty
so
unattainable
that
*NL*
not
even
a
continuity
of
most
brilliant
successes
would
secure
them
,
and
*NL*
she
doubts
the
means
we
have
of
gaining
them
.
That
is
the
actual
phrase
*NL*
used
by
the
Vienna
cabinet
,
''
said
the
Danish
charge
d'affaires
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doubt
is
flattering
,
''
said
``
the
man
of
profound
intellect
,
''
with
a
*NL*
subtle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
distinguish
between
the
Vienna
cabinet
and
the
Emperor
of
*NL*
Austria
,
''
said
Mortemart
.
``
The
Emperor
of
Austria
can
never
have
thought
*NL*
of
such
a
thing
,
it
is
only
the
cabinet
that
says
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
vicomte
,
''
put
in
Anna
Pavlovna
,
``
L'Urope
''
-LRB-
for
some
reason
*NL*
she
called
it
Urope
as
if
that
were
a
specially
refined
French
*NL*
pronunciation
which
she
could
allow
herself
when
conversing
with
a
*NL*
Frenchman
-RRB-
,
``
L'Urope
ne
sera
jamais
notre
alliee
sincere
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Europe
will
never
be
our
sincere
ally

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Anna
Pavlovna
led
up
to
the
courage
and
firmness
of
the
King
*NL*
of
Prussia
,
in
order
to
draw
Boris
into
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
listened
attentively
to
each
of
the
speakers
,
awaiting
his
turn
,
*NL*
but
managed
meanwhile
to
look
round
repeatedly
at
his
neighbor
,
the
*NL*
beautiful
Helene
,
whose
eyes
several
times
met
those
of
the
handsome
*NL*
young
aide-de-camp
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
of
the
position
of
Prussia
,
Anna
Pavlovna
very
naturally
asked
*NL*
Boris
to
tell
them
about
his
journey
to
Glogau
and
in
what
state
he
*NL*
found
the
Prussian
army
.
Boris
,
speaking
with
deliberation
,
told
them
in
*NL*
pure
,
correct
French
many
interesting
details
about
the
armies
and
the
*NL*
court
,
carefully
abstaining
from
expressing
an
opinion
of
his
own
about
*NL*
the
facts
he
was
recounting
.
For
some
time
he
engrossed
the
general
*NL*
attention
,
and
Anna
Pavlovna
felt
that
the
novelty
she
had
served
up
was
*NL*
received
with
pleasure
by
all
her
visitors
.
The
greatest
attention
of
*NL*
all
to
Boris
'
narrative
was
shown
by
Helene
.
She
asked
him
several
*NL*
questions
about
his
journey
and
seemed
greatly
interested
in
the
state
*NL*
of
the
Prussian
army
.
As
soon
as
he
had
finished
she
turned
to
him
with
*NL*
her
usual
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
absolutely
must
come
and
see
me
,
''
she
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
*NL*
that
,
for
certain
considerations
he
could
not
know
of
,
this
was
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Tuesday
between
eight
and
nine
.
It
will
give
me
great
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
promised
to
fulfill
her
wish
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
*NL*
with
her
,
when
Anna
Pavlovna
called
him
away
on
the
pretext
that
her
*NL*
aunt
wished
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
her
husband
,
of
course
?
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
closing
her
eyes
*NL*
and
indicating
Helene
with
a
sorrowful
gesture
.
``
Ah
,
she
is
such
an
*NL*
unfortunate
and
charming
woman
!
Do
n't
mention
him
before
her

*NL*
do

It
is

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Boris
and
Anna
Pavlovna
returned
to
the
others
Prince
Hippolyte
had
*NL*
the
ear
of
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bending
forward
in
his
armchair
he
said
:
``
Le
Roi
de
Prusse
!
''
and
having
*NL*
said
this
laughed
.
Everyone
turned
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
Roi
de
Prusse
?
''
Hippolyte
said
interrogatively
,
again
laughing
,
and
*NL*
then
calmly
and
seriously
sat
back
in
his
chair
.
Anna
Pavlovna
waited
*NL*
for
him
to
go
on
,
but
as
he
seemed
quite
decided
to
say
no
more
she
*NL*
began
to
tell
of
how
at
Potsdam
the
impious
Bonaparte
had
stolen
the
*NL*
sword
of
Frederick
the
Great
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
sword
of
Frederick
the
Great
which
I.
.
.
''
she
began
,
but
*NL*
Hippolyte
interrupted
her
with
the
words
:
``
Le
Roi
de
Prusse
...
''
and
*NL*
again
,
as
soon
as
all
turned
toward
him
,
excused
himself
and
said
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
frowned
.
Mortemart
,
Hippolyte
's
friend
,
addressed
him
*NL*
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
what
about
your
Roi
de
Prusse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hippolyte
laughed
as
if
ashamed
of
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
.
I
only
wished
to
say
...
''
-LRB-
he
wanted
to
repeat
a
joke
*NL*
he
had
heard
in
Vienna
and
which
he
had
been
trying
all
that
evening
to
*NL*
get
in
-RRB-
``
I
only
wished
to
say
that
we
are
wrong
to
fight
pour
le
Roi
de
*NL*
Prusse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
smiled
circumspectly
,
so
that
it
might
be
taken
as
ironical
or
*NL*
appreciative
according
to
the
way
the
joke
was
received
.
Everybody
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
joke
is
too
bad
,
it
's
witty
but
unjust
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
*NL*
shaking
her
little
shriveled
finger
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
fighting
pour
le
Roi
de
Prusse
,
but
for
right
principles
.
*NL*
Oh
,
that
wicked
Prince
Hippolyte
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
did
not
flag
all
evening
and
turned
chiefly
on
the
*NL*
political
news
.
It
became
particularly
animated
toward
the
end
of
the
*NL*
evening
when
the
rewards
bestowed
by
the
Emperor
were
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
N
--
N
--
received
a
snuffbox
with
the
portrait
last
year
?
''
said
*NL*
``
the
man
of
profound
intellect
.
''
``
Why
should
n't
S
--
S
--
get
the
same
*NL*
distinction
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
!
A
snuffbox
with
the
Emperor
's
portrait
is
a
reward
but
not
a
*NL*
distinction
,
''
said
the
diplomatist
--
``
a
gift
,
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
precedents
,
I
may
mention
Schwarzenberg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
,
''
replied
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
bet
?
The
ribbon
of
the
order
is
a
different
matter
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
everybody
rose
to
go
,
Helene
who
had
spoken
very
little
all
the
*NL*
evening
again
turned
to
Boris
,
asking
him
in
a
tone
of
caressing
*NL*
significant
command
to
come
to
her
on
Tuesday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
great
importance
to
me
,
''
she
said
,
turning
with
a
smile
toward
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
,
and
Anna
Pavlovna
,
with
the
same
sad
smile
with
which
she
*NL*
spoke
of
her
exalted
patroness
,
supported
Helene
's
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
from
some
words
Boris
had
spoken
that
evening
about
the
*NL*
Prussian
army
,
Helene
had
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
see
him
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
promise
to
explain
that
necessity
to
him
when
he
came
on
*NL*
Tuesday
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
Tuesday
evening
,
having
come
to
Helene
's
splendid
salon
,
Boris
*NL*
received
no
clear
explanation
of
why
it
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
*NL*
come
.
There
were
other
guests
and
the
countess
talked
little
to
him
,
and
*NL*
only
as
he
kissed
her
hand
on
taking
leave
said
unexpectedly
and
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
with
a
strangely
unsmiling
face
:
``
Come
to
dinner
tomorrow
...
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
You
must
come
...
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
stay
in
Petersburg
,
Boris
became
an
intimate
in
the
*NL*
countess
'
house
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
war
was
flaming
up
and
nearing
the
Russian
frontier
.
Everywhere
one
*NL*
heard
curses
on
Bonaparte
,
``
the
enemy
of
mankind
.
''
Militiamen
and
*NL*
recruits
were
being
enrolled
in
the
villages
,
and
from
the
seat
of
war
*NL*
came
contradictory
news
,
false
as
usual
and
therefore
variously
*NL*
interpreted
.
The
life
of
old
Prince
Bolkonski
,
Prince
Andrew
,
and
*NL*
Princess
Mary
had
greatly
changed
since
1805
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1806
the
old
prince
was
made
one
of
the
eight
commanders
in
chief
*NL*
then
appointed
to
supervise
the
enrollment
decreed
throughout
Russia
.
*NL*
Despite
the
weakness
of
age
,
which
had
become
particularly
noticeable
*NL*
since
the
time
when
he
thought
his
son
had
been
killed
,
he
did
not
think
*NL*
it
right
to
refuse
a
duty
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
Emperor
*NL*
himself
,
and
this
fresh
opportunity
for
action
gave
him
new
energy
and
*NL*
strength
.
He
was
continually
traveling
through
the
three
provinces
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
,
was
pedantic
in
the
fulfillment
of
his
duties
,
severe
*NL*
to
cruel
with
his
subordinates
,
and
went
into
everything
down
to
the
*NL*
minutest
details
himself
.
Princess
Mary
had
ceased
taking
lessons
in
*NL*
mathematics
from
her
father
,
and
when
the
old
prince
was
at
home
went
to
*NL*
his
study
with
the
wet
nurse
and
little
Prince
Nicholas
-LRB-
as
his
*NL*
grandfather
called
him
-RRB-
.
The
baby
Prince
Nicholas
lived
with
his
wet
*NL*
nurse
and
nurse
Savishna
in
the
late
princess
'
rooms
and
Princess
Mary
*NL*
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
nursery
,
taking
a
mother
's
place
to
her
*NL*
little
nephew
as
best
she
could
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
too
,
seemed
*NL*
passionately
fond
of
the
boy
,
and
Princess
Mary
often
deprived
herself
*NL*
to
give
her
friend
the
pleasure
of
dandling
the
little
angel
--
as
she
*NL*
called
her
nephew
--
and
playing
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
altar
of
the
church
at
Bald
Hills
there
was
a
chapel
over
the
*NL*
tomb
of
the
little
princess
,
and
in
this
chapel
was
a
marble
monument
*NL*
brought
from
Italy
,
representing
an
angel
with
outspread
wings
ready
to
*NL*
fly
upwards
.
The
angel
's
upper
lip
was
slightly
raised
as
though
about
*NL*
to
smile
,
and
once
on
coming
out
of
the
chapel
Prince
Andrew
and
*NL*
Princess
Mary
admitted
to
one
another
that
the
angel
's
face
reminded
*NL*
them
strangely
of
the
little
princess
.
But
what
was
still
stranger
,
*NL*
though
of
this
Prince
Andrew
said
nothing
to
his
sister
,
was
that
in
the
*NL*
expression
the
sculptor
had
happened
to
give
the
angel
's
face
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
read
the
same
mild
reproach
he
had
read
on
the
face
of
his
dead
*NL*
wife
:
``
Ah
,
why
have
you
done
this
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Prince
Andrew
's
return
the
old
prince
made
over
to
him
a
*NL*
large
estate
,
Bogucharovo
,
about
twenty-five
miles
from
Bald
Hills
.
*NL*
Partly
because
of
the
depressing
memories
associated
with
Bald
Hills
,
*NL*
partly
because
Prince
Andrew
did
not
always
feel
equal
to
bearing
with
*NL*
his
father
's
peculiarities
,
and
partly
because
he
needed
solitude
,
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
made
use
of
Bogucharovo
,
began
building
and
spent
most
of
*NL*
his
time
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
Austerlitz
campaign
Prince
Andrew
had
firmly
resolved
not
to
*NL*
continue
his
military
service
,
and
when
the
war
recommenced
and
*NL*
everybody
had
to
serve
,
he
took
a
post
under
his
father
in
the
*NL*
recruitment
so
as
to
avoid
active
service
.
The
old
prince
and
his
son
*NL*
seemed
to
have
changed
roles
since
the
campaign
of
1805
.
The
old
man
,
*NL*
roused
by
activity
,
expected
the
best
results
from
the
new
campaign
,
*NL*
while
Prince
Andrew
on
the
contrary
,
taking
no
part
in
the
war
and
*NL*
secretly
regretting
this
,
saw
only
the
dark
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
February
26
,
1807
,
the
old
prince
set
off
on
one
of
his
circuits
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
remained
at
Bald
Hills
as
usual
during
his
father
's
*NL*
absence
.
Little
Nicholas
had
been
unwell
for
four
days
.
The
coachman
who
*NL*
had
driven
the
old
prince
to
town
returned
bringing
papers
and
letters
*NL*
for
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
finding
the
young
prince
in
his
study
the
valet
went
with
the
*NL*
letters
to
Princess
Mary
's
apartments
,
but
did
not
find
him
there
.
He
*NL*
was
told
that
the
prince
had
gone
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
your
excellency
,
Petrusha
has
brought
some
papers
,
''
said
*NL*
one
of
the
nursemaids
to
Prince
Andrew
who
was
sitting
on
a
child
's
*NL*
little
chair
while
,
frowning
and
with
trembling
hands
,
he
poured
drops
*NL*
from
a
medicine
bottle
into
a
wineglass
half
full
of
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
said
crossly
,
and
,
his
hand
shaking
unintentionally
,
he
*NL*
poured
too
many
drops
into
the
glass
.
He
threw
the
mixture
onto
the
*NL*
floor
and
asked
for
some
more
water
.
The
maid
brought
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
in
the
room
a
child
's
cot
,
two
boxes
,
two
armchairs
,
a
table
,
*NL*
a
child
's
table
,
and
the
little
chair
on
which
Prince
Andrew
was
*NL*
sitting
.
The
curtains
were
drawn
,
and
a
single
candle
was
burning
on
the
*NL*
table
,
screened
by
a
bound
music
book
so
that
the
light
did
not
fall
on
*NL*
the
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
addressing
her
brother
from
beside
the
*NL*
cot
where
she
was
standing
,
``
better
wait
a
bit
...
later
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
leave
off
,
you
always
talk
nonsense
and
keep
putting
things
off
--
*NL*
and
this
is
what
comes
of
it
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
in
an
exasperated
*NL*
whisper
,
evidently
meaning
to
wound
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
really
...
it
's
better
not
to
wake
him
...
he
's
asleep
,
''
said
*NL*
the
princess
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
got
up
and
went
on
tiptoe
up
to
the
little
bed
,
wineglass
*NL*
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
'd
really
better
not
wake
him
,
''
he
said
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
...
really
...
I
think
so
...
but
as
you
please
,
''
said
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
evidently
intimidated
and
confused
that
her
opinion
had
*NL*
prevailed
.
She
drew
her
brother
's
attention
to
the
maid
who
was
calling
*NL*
him
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
second
night
that
neither
of
them
had
slept
,
watching
the
boy
*NL*
who
was
in
a
high
fever
.
These
last
days
,
mistrusting
their
household
*NL*
doctor
and
expecting
another
for
whom
they
had
sent
to
town
,
they
had
*NL*
been
trying
first
one
remedy
and
then
another
.
Worn
out
by
sleeplessness
*NL*
and
anxiety
they
threw
their
burden
of
sorrow
on
one
another
and
*NL*
reproached
and
disputed
with
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Petrusha
has
come
with
papers
from
your
father
,
''
whispered
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
them
!
''
he
muttered
,
and
after
listening
to
the
verbal
*NL*
instructions
his
father
had
sent
and
taking
the
correspondence
and
his
*NL*
father
's
letter
,
he
returned
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
the
same
.
Wait
,
for
heaven
's
sake
.
Karl
Ivanich
always
says
that
*NL*
sleep
is
more
important
than
anything
,
''
whispered
Princess
Mary
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
up
to
the
child
and
felt
him
.
He
was
burning
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
you
and
your
Karl
Ivanich
!
''
He
took
the
glass
with
the
drops
*NL*
and
again
went
up
to
the
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
do
n't
!
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
scowled
at
her
angrily
though
also
with
suffering
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
stooped
glass
in
hand
over
the
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wish
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
beg
you
--
give
it
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
took
the
glass
submissively
and
*NL*
calling
the
nurse
began
giving
the
medicine
.
The
child
screamed
*NL*
hoarsely
.
Prince
Andrew
winced
and
,
clutching
his
head
,
went
out
and
sat
*NL*
down
on
a
sofa
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
had
all
the
letters
in
his
hand
.
Opening
them
mechanically
he
*NL*
began
reading
.
The
old
prince
,
now
and
then
using
abbreviations
,
wrote
*NL*
in
his
large
elongated
hand
on
blue
paper
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
Have
just
this
moment
received
by
special
messenger
very
joyful
news
--
if
*NL*
it
's
not
false
.
Bennigsen
seems
to
have
obtained
a
complete
victory
over
*NL*
Buonaparte
at
Eylau
.
In
Petersburg
everyone
is
rejoicing
,
and
the
*NL*
rewards
sent
to
the
army
are
innumerable
.
Though
he
is
a
German
--
I
*NL*
congratulate
him
!
I
ca
n't
make
out
what
the
commander
at
Korchevo
--
a
*NL*
certain
Khandrikov
--
is
up
to
;
till
now
the
additional
men
and
provisions
*NL*
have
not
arrived
.
Gallop
off
to
him
at
once
and
say
I
'll
have
his
head
*NL*
off
if
everything
is
not
here
in
a
week
.
Have
received
another
letter
*NL*
about
the
Preussisch-Eylau
battle
from
Petenka
--
he
took
part
in
it
--
and
*NL*
it
's
all
true
.
When
mischief-makers
do
n't
meddle
even
a
German
beats
*NL*
Buonaparte
.
He
is
said
to
be
fleeing
in
great
disorder
.
Mind
you
gallop
*NL*
off
to
Korchevo
without
delay
and
carry
out
instructions
!
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
sighed
and
broke
the
seal
of
another
envelope
.
It
was
a
*NL*
closely
written
letter
of
two
sheets
from
Bilibin
.
He
folded
it
up
*NL*
without
reading
it
and
reread
his
father
's
letter
,
ending
with
the
*NL*
words
:
``
Gallop
off
to
Korchevo
and
carry
out
instructions
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
pardon
me
,
I
wo
n't
go
now
till
the
child
is
better
,
''
thought
he
,
*NL*
going
to
the
door
and
looking
into
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
still
standing
by
the
cot
,
gently
rocking
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
and
what
else
did
he
say
that
's
unpleasant
?
''
thought
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
recalling
his
father
's
letter
.
``
Yes
,
we
have
gained
a
victory
*NL*
over
Bonaparte
,
just
when
I
'm
not
serving
.
Yes
,
yes
,
he
's
always
poking
*NL*
fun
at
me
...
Ah
,
well
!
Let
him
!
''
And
he
began
reading
Bilibin
's
letter
*NL*
which
was
written
in
French
.
He
read
without
understanding
half
of
it
,
*NL*
read
only
to
forget
,
if
but
for
a
moment
,
what
he
had
too
long
been
*NL*
thinking
of
so
painfully
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
was
now
at
army
headquarters
in
a
diplomatic
capacity
,
and
*NL*
though
he
wrote
in
French
and
used
French
jests
and
French
idioms
,
he
*NL*
described
the
whole
campaign
with
a
fearless
self-censure
and
self
-
*NL*
derision
genuinely
Russian
.
Bilibin
wrote
that
the
obligation
of
*NL*
diplomatic
discretion
tormented
him
,
and
he
was
happy
to
have
in
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
a
reliable
correspondent
to
whom
he
could
pour
out
the
bile
he
*NL*
had
accumulated
at
the
sight
of
all
that
was
being
done
in
the
army
.
The
*NL*
letter
was
old
,
having
been
written
before
the
battle
at
Preussisch
-
*NL*
Eylau
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
the
day
of
our
brilliant
success
at
Austerlitz
,
''
wrote
Bilibin
,
*NL*
``
as
you
know
,
my
dear
prince
,
I
never
leave
headquarters
.
I
have
*NL*
certainly
acquired
a
taste
for
war
,
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
me
;
what
*NL*
I
have
seen
during
these
last
three
months
is
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begin
ab
ovo
.
`
The
enemy
of
the
human
race
,
'
as
you
know
,
attacks
the
*NL*
Prussians
.
The
Prussians
are
our
faithful
allies
who
have
only
betrayed
*NL*
us
three
times
in
three
years
.
We
take
up
their
cause
,
but
it
turns
out
*NL*
that
`
the
enemy
of
the
human
race
'
pays
no
heed
to
our
fine
speeches
and
*NL*
in
his
rude
and
savage
way
throws
himself
on
the
Prussians
without
*NL*
giving
them
time
to
finish
the
parade
they
had
begun
,
and
in
two
twists
*NL*
of
the
hand
he
breaks
them
to
smithereens
and
installs
himself
in
the
*NL*
palace
at
Potsdam
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
most
ardently
desire
,
'
writes
the
King
of
Prussia
to
Bonaparte
,
*NL*
`
that
Your
Majesty
should
be
received
and
treated
in
my
palace
in
a
*NL*
manner
agreeable
to
yourself
,
and
in
so
far
as
circumstances
allowed
,
I
*NL*
have
hastened
to
take
all
steps
to
that
end
.
May
I
have
succeeded
!
'
The
*NL*
Prussian
generals
pride
themselves
on
being
polite
to
the
French
and
lay
*NL*
down
their
arms
at
the
first
demand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
head
of
the
garrison
at
Glogau
,
with
ten
thousand
men
,
asks
the
*NL*
King
of
Prussia
what
he
is
to
do
if
he
is
summoned
to
surrender
...
All
*NL*
this
is
absolutely
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
hoping
to
settle
matters
by
taking
up
a
warlike
attitude
,
it
*NL*
turns
out
that
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
war
,
and
what
is
more
,
in
war
*NL*
on
our
own
frontiers
,
with
and
for
the
King
of
Prussia
.
We
have
*NL*
everything
in
perfect
order
,
only
one
little
thing
is
lacking
,
namely
,
a
*NL*
commander
in
chief
.
As
it
was
considered
that
the
Austerlitz
success
*NL*
might
have
been
more
decisive
had
the
commander-in-chief
not
been
so
*NL*
young
,
all
our
octogenarians
were
reviewed
,
and
of
Prozorovski
and
*NL*
Kamenski
the
latter
was
preferred
.
The
general
comes
to
us
,
Suvorov
-
*NL*
like
,
in
a
kibitka
,
and
is
received
with
acclamations
of
joy
and
*NL*
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
4th
,
the
first
courier
arrives
from
Petersburg
.
The
mails
are
*NL*
taken
to
the
field
marshal
's
room
,
for
he
likes
to
do
everything
*NL*
himself
.
I
am
called
in
to
help
sort
the
letters
and
take
those
meant
*NL*
for
us
.
The
field
marshal
looks
on
and
waits
for
letters
addressed
to
*NL*
him
.
We
search
,
but
none
are
to
be
found
.
The
field
marshal
grows
*NL*
impatient
and
sets
to
work
himself
and
finds
letters
from
the
Emperor
to
*NL*
Count
T.
,
Prince
V.
,
and
others
.
Then
he
bursts
into
one
of
his
wild
*NL*
furies
and
rages
at
everyone
and
everything
,
seizes
the
letters
,
opens
*NL*
them
,
and
reads
those
from
the
Emperor
addressed
to
others
.
`
Ah
!
So
*NL*
that
's
the
way
they
treat
me
!
No
confidence
in
me
!
Ah
,
ordered
to
keep
*NL*
an
eye
on
me
!
Very
well
then
!
Get
along
with
you
!
'
So
he
writes
the
*NL*
famous
order
of
the
day
to
General
Bennigsen
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
wounded
and
can
not
ride
and
consequently
can
not
command
the
army
.
*NL*
You
have
brought
your
army
corps
to
Pultusk
,
routed
:
here
it
is
exposed
,
*NL*
and
without
fuel
or
forage
,
so
something
must
be
done
,
and
,
as
you
*NL*
yourself
reported
to
Count
Buxhowden
yesterday
,
you
must
think
of
*NL*
retreating
to
our
frontier
--
which
do
today
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
From
all
my
riding
,
'
he
writes
to
the
Emperor
,
'
I
have
got
a
saddle
*NL*
sore
which
,
coming
after
all
my
previous
journeys
,
quite
prevents
my
*NL*
riding
and
commanding
so
vast
an
army
,
so
I
have
passed
on
the
command
*NL*
to
the
general
next
in
seniority
,
Count
Buxhowden
,
having
sent
him
my
*NL*
whole
staff
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
,
advising
him
if
there
is
a
lack
*NL*
of
bread
,
to
move
farther
into
the
interior
of
Prussia
,
for
only
one
*NL*
day
's
ration
of
bread
remains
,
and
in
some
regiments
none
at
all
,
as
*NL*
reported
by
the
division
commanders
,
Ostermann
and
Sedmoretzki
,
and
all
*NL*
that
the
peasants
had
has
been
eaten
up
.
I
myself
will
remain
in
*NL*
hospital
at
Ostrolenka
till
I
recover
.
In
regard
to
which
I
humbly
*NL*
submit
my
report
,
with
the
information
that
if
the
army
remains
in
its
*NL*
present
bivouac
another
fortnight
there
will
not
be
a
healthy
man
left
*NL*
in
it
by
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Grant
leave
to
retire
to
his
country
seat
to
an
old
man
who
is
already
*NL*
in
any
case
dishonored
by
being
unable
to
fulfill
the
great
and
glorious
*NL*
task
for
which
he
was
chosen
.
I
shall
await
your
most
gracious
*NL*
permission
here
in
hospital
,
that
I
may
not
have
to
play
the
part
of
a
*NL*
secretary
rather
than
commander
in
the
army
.
My
removal
from
the
army
*NL*
does
not
produce
the
slightest
stir
--
a
blind
man
has
left
it
.
There
are
*NL*
thousands
such
as
I
in
Russia
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
field
marshal
is
angry
with
the
Emperor
and
he
punishes
us
all
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
logical
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
act
.
Those
that
follow
are
naturally
increasingly
*NL*
interesting
and
entertaining
.
After
the
field
marshal
's
departure
it
*NL*
appears
that
we
are
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
must
give
battle
.
*NL*
Buxhowden
is
commander-in-chief
by
seniority
,
but
General
Bennigsen
does
*NL*
not
quite
see
it
;
more
particularly
as
it
is
he
and
his
corps
who
are
*NL*
within
sight
of
the
enemy
and
he
wishes
to
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
*NL*
fight
a
battle
`
on
his
own
hand
'
as
the
Germans
say
.
He
does
so
.
This
is
*NL*
the
battle
of
Pultusk
,
which
is
considered
a
great
victory
but
in
my
*NL*
opinion
was
nothing
of
the
kind
.
We
civilians
,
as
you
know
,
have
a
very
*NL*
bad
way
of
deciding
whether
a
battle
was
won
or
lost
.
Those
who
retreat
*NL*
after
a
battle
have
lost
it
is
what
we
say
;
and
according
to
that
it
is
*NL*
we
who
lost
the
battle
of
Pultusk
.
In
short
,
we
retreat
after
the
battle
*NL*
but
send
a
courier
to
Petersburg
with
news
of
a
victory
,
and
General
*NL*
Bennigsen
,
hoping
to
receive
from
Petersburg
the
post
of
commander
in
*NL*
chief
as
a
reward
for
his
victory
,
does
not
give
up
the
command
of
the
*NL*
army
to
General
Buxhowden
.
During
this
interregnum
we
begin
a
very
*NL*
original
and
interesting
series
of
maneuvers
.
Our
aim
is
no
longer
,
as
*NL*
it
should
be
,
to
avoid
or
attack
the
enemy
,
but
solely
to
avoid
General
*NL*
Buxhowden
who
by
right
of
seniority
should
be
our
chief
.
So
*NL*
energetically
do
we
pursue
this
aim
that
after
crossing
an
unfordable
*NL*
river
we
burn
the
bridges
to
separate
ourselves
from
our
enemy
,
who
at
*NL*
the
moment
is
not
Bonaparte
but
Buxhowden
.
General
Buxhowden
was
all
but
*NL*
attacked
and
captured
by
a
superior
enemy
force
as
a
result
of
one
of
*NL*
these
maneuvers
that
enabled
us
to
escape
him
.
Buxhowden
pursues
us
--
we
*NL*
scuttle
.
He
hardly
crosses
the
river
to
our
side
before
we
recross
to
*NL*
the
other
.
At
last
our
enemy
,
Buxhowden
,
catches
us
and
attacks
.
Both
*NL*
generals
are
angry
,
and
the
result
is
a
challenge
on
Buxhowden
's
part
*NL*
and
an
epileptic
fit
on
Bennigsen
's
.
But
at
the
critical
moment
the
*NL*
courier
who
carried
the
news
of
our
victory
at
Pultusk
to
Petersburg
*NL*
returns
bringing
our
appointment
as
commander-in-chief
,
and
our
first
*NL*
foe
,
Buxhowden
,
is
vanquished
;
we
can
now
turn
our
thoughts
to
the
*NL*
second
,
Bonaparte
.
But
as
it
turns
out
,
just
at
that
moment
a
third
*NL*
enemy
rises
before
us
--
namely
the
Orthodox
Russian
soldiers
,
loudly
*NL*
demanding
bread
,
meat
,
biscuits
,
fodder
,
and
whatnot
!
The
stores
are
*NL*
empty
,
the
roads
impassable
.
The
Orthodox
begin
looting
,
and
in
a
way
of
*NL*
which
our
last
campaign
can
give
you
no
idea
.
Half
the
regiments
form
*NL*
bands
and
scour
the
countryside
and
put
everything
to
fire
and
sword
.
*NL*
The
inhabitants
are
totally
ruined
,
the
hospitals
overflow
with
sick
,
*NL*
and
famine
is
everywhere
.
Twice
the
marauders
even
attack
our
*NL*
headquarters
,
and
the
commander-in-chief
has
to
ask
for
a
battalion
to
*NL*
disperse
them
.
During
one
of
these
attacks
they
carried
off
my
empty
*NL*
portmanteau
and
my
dressing
gown
.
The
Emperor
proposes
to
give
all
*NL*
commanders
of
divisions
the
right
to
shoot
marauders
,
but
I
much
fear
*NL*
this
will
oblige
one
half
the
army
to
shoot
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Prince
Andrew
read
with
his
eyes
only
,
but
after
a
while
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
himself
-LRB-
although
he
knew
how
far
it
was
safe
to
trust
*NL*
Bilibin
-RRB-
,
what
he
had
read
began
to
interest
him
more
and
more
.
When
he
*NL*
had
read
thus
far
,
he
crumpled
the
letter
up
and
threw
it
away
.
It
was
*NL*
not
what
he
had
read
that
vexed
him
,
but
the
fact
that
the
life
out
*NL*
there
in
which
he
had
now
no
part
could
perturb
him
.
He
shut
his
eyes
,
*NL*
rubbed
his
forehead
as
if
to
rid
himself
of
all
interest
in
what
he
had
*NL*
read
,
and
listened
to
what
was
passing
in
the
nursery
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
thought
he
heard
a
strange
noise
through
the
door
.
He
was
seized
with
*NL*
alarm
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
the
child
while
he
was
*NL*
reading
the
letter
.
He
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
went
in
he
saw
that
the
nurse
was
hiding
something
from
him
*NL*
with
a
scared
look
and
that
Princess
Mary
was
no
longer
by
the
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
he
heard
what
seemed
to
him
her
despairing
whisper
behind
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
often
happens
after
long
sleeplessness
and
long
anxiety
,
he
was
*NL*
seized
by
an
unreasoning
panic
--
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
child
was
*NL*
dead
.
All
that
he
saw
and
heard
seemed
to
confirm
this
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
over
,
''
he
thought
,
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
.
*NL*
He
went
to
the
cot
in
confusion
,
sure
that
he
would
find
it
empty
and
*NL*
that
the
nurse
had
been
hiding
the
dead
baby
.
He
drew
the
curtain
aside
*NL*
and
for
some
time
his
frightened
,
restless
eyes
could
not
find
the
baby
.
*NL*
At
last
he
saw
him
:
the
rosy
boy
had
tossed
about
till
he
lay
across
the
*NL*
bed
with
his
head
lower
than
the
pillow
,
and
was
smacking
his
lips
in
*NL*
his
sleep
and
breathing
evenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
as
glad
to
find
the
boy
like
that
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
already
lost
him
.
He
bent
over
him
and
,
as
his
sister
had
taught
him
,
*NL*
tried
with
his
lips
whether
the
child
was
still
feverish
.
The
soft
*NL*
forehead
was
moist
.
Prince
Andrew
touched
the
head
with
his
hand
;
even
*NL*
the
hair
was
wet
,
so
profusely
had
the
child
perspired
.
He
was
not
dead
,
*NL*
but
evidently
the
crisis
was
over
and
he
was
convalescent
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
longed
to
snatch
up
,
to
squeeze
,
to
hold
to
his
heart
,
this
helpless
*NL*
little
creature
,
but
dared
not
do
so
.
He
stood
over
him
,
gazing
at
his
*NL*
head
and
at
the
little
arms
and
legs
which
showed
under
the
blanket
.
He
*NL*
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
a
shadow
appeared
under
the
curtain
of
the
*NL*
cot
.
He
did
not
look
round
,
but
still
gazing
at
the
infant
's
face
*NL*
listened
to
his
regular
breathing
.
The
dark
shadow
was
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
who
had
come
up
to
the
cot
with
noiseless
steps
,
lifted
the
curtain
,
and
*NL*
dropped
it
again
behind
her
.
Prince
Andrew
recognized
her
without
*NL*
looking
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
.
She
pressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
perspired
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
coming
to
tell
you
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
moved
slightly
in
his
sleep
,
smiled
,
and
rubbed
his
forehead
*NL*
against
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
his
sister
.
In
the
dim
shadow
of
the
curtain
her
*NL*
luminous
eyes
shone
more
brightly
than
usual
from
the
tears
of
joy
that
*NL*
were
in
them
.
She
leaned
over
to
her
brother
and
kissed
him
,
slightly
*NL*
catching
the
curtain
of
the
cot
.
Each
made
the
other
a
warning
gesture
*NL*
and
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
beneath
the
curtain
as
if
not
wishing
*NL*
to
leave
that
seclusion
where
they
three
were
shut
off
from
all
the
*NL*
world
.
Prince
Andrew
was
the
first
to
move
away
,
ruffling
his
hair
*NL*
against
the
muslin
of
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
this
is
the
one
thing
left
me
now
,
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
his
admission
to
the
masonic
Brotherhood
,
Pierre
went
to
the
*NL*
Kiev
province
,
where
he
had
the
greatest
number
of
serfs
,
taking
with
*NL*
him
full
directions
which
he
had
written
down
for
his
own
guidance
as
to
*NL*
what
he
should
do
on
his
estates
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
Kiev
he
sent
for
all
his
stewards
to
the
head
office
and
*NL*
explained
to
them
his
intentions
and
wishes
.
He
told
them
that
steps
*NL*
would
be
taken
immediately
to
free
his
serfs
--
and
that
till
then
they
*NL*
were
not
to
be
overburdened
with
labor
,
women
while
nursing
their
babies
*NL*
were
not
to
be
sent
to
work
,
assistance
was
to
be
given
to
the
serfs
,
*NL*
punishments
were
to
be
admonitory
and
not
corporal
,
and
hospitals
,
*NL*
asylums
,
and
schools
were
to
be
established
on
all
the
estates
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
stewards
-LRB-
there
were
semiliterate
foremen
among
them
-RRB-
listened
with
*NL*
alarm
,
supposing
these
words
to
mean
that
the
young
count
was
displeased
*NL*
with
their
management
and
embezzlement
of
money
,
some
after
their
first
*NL*
fright
were
amused
by
Pierre
's
lisp
and
the
new
words
they
had
not
heard
*NL*
before
,
others
simply
enjoyed
hearing
how
the
master
talked
,
while
the
*NL*
cleverest
among
them
,
including
the
chief
steward
,
understood
from
this
*NL*
speech
how
they
could
best
handle
the
master
for
their
own
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
steward
expressed
great
sympathy
with
Pierre
's
intentions
,
but
*NL*
remarked
that
besides
these
changes
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
into
the
*NL*
general
state
of
affairs
which
was
far
from
satisfactory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
Count
Bezukhov
's
enormous
wealth
,
since
he
had
come
into
an
*NL*
income
which
was
said
to
amount
to
five
hundred
thousand
rubles
a
year
,
*NL*
Pierre
felt
himself
far
poorer
than
when
his
father
had
made
him
an
*NL*
allowance
of
ten
thousand
rubles
.
He
had
a
dim
perception
of
the
*NL*
following
budget
:
*NL*
*NL*
About
80,000
went
in
payments
on
all
the
estates
to
the
Land
Bank
,
about
*NL*
30,000
went
for
the
upkeep
of
the
estate
near
Moscow
,
the
town
house
,
*NL*
and
the
allowance
to
the
three
princesses
;
about
15,000
was
given
in
*NL*
pensions
and
the
same
amount
for
asylums
;
150,000
alimony
was
sent
to
*NL*
the
countess
;
about
70,000
went
for
interest
on
debts
.
The
building
of
a
*NL*
new
church
,
previously
begun
,
had
cost
about
10,000
in
each
of
the
last
*NL*
two
years
,
and
he
did
not
know
how
the
rest
,
about
100,000
rubles
,
was
*NL*
spent
,
and
almost
every
year
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
.
Besides
this
the
*NL*
chief
steward
wrote
every
year
telling
him
of
fires
and
bad
harvests
,
or
*NL*
of
the
necessity
of
rebuilding
factories
and
workshops
.
So
the
first
*NL*
task
Pierre
had
to
face
was
one
for
which
he
had
very
little
aptitude
or
*NL*
inclination
--
practical
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discussed
estate
affairs
every
day
with
his
chief
steward
.
But
he
*NL*
felt
that
this
did
not
forward
matters
at
all
.
He
felt
that
these
*NL*
consultations
were
detached
from
real
affairs
and
did
not
link
up
with
*NL*
them
or
make
them
move
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
chief
steward
put
the
state
*NL*
of
things
to
him
in
the
very
worst
light
,
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
*NL*
paying
off
the
debts
and
undertaking
new
activities
with
serf
labor
,
to
*NL*
which
Pierre
did
not
agree
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Pierre
demanded
that
*NL*
steps
should
be
taken
to
liberate
the
serfs
,
which
the
steward
met
by
*NL*
showing
the
necessity
of
first
paying
off
the
loans
from
the
Land
Bank
,
*NL*
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
a
speedy
emancipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steward
did
not
say
it
was
quite
impossible
,
but
suggested
selling
*NL*
the
forests
in
the
province
of
Kostroma
,
the
land
lower
down
the
river
,
*NL*
and
the
Crimean
estate
,
in
order
to
make
it
possible
:
all
of
which
*NL*
operations
according
to
him
were
connected
with
such
complicated
*NL*
measures
--
the
removal
of
injunctions
,
petitions
,
permits
,
and
so
on
--
*NL*
that
Pierre
became
quite
bewildered
and
only
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
none
of
the
practical
persistence
that
would
have
enabled
him
*NL*
to
attend
to
the
business
himself
and
so
he
disliked
it
and
only
tried
*NL*
to
pretend
to
the
steward
that
he
was
attending
to
it
.
The
steward
for
*NL*
his
part
tried
to
pretend
to
the
count
that
he
considered
these
*NL*
consultations
very
valuable
for
the
proprietor
and
troublesome
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Kiev
Pierre
found
some
people
he
knew
,
and
strangers
hastened
to
make
*NL*
his
acquaintance
and
joyfully
welcomed
the
rich
newcomer
,
the
largest
*NL*
landowner
of
the
province
.
Temptations
to
Pierre
's
greatest
weakness
--
*NL*
the
one
to
which
he
had
confessed
when
admitted
to
the
Lodge
--
were
so
*NL*
strong
that
he
could
not
resist
them
.
Again
whole
days
,
weeks
,
and
*NL*
months
of
his
life
passed
in
as
great
a
rush
and
were
as
much
occupied
*NL*
with
evening
parties
,
dinners
,
lunches
,
and
balls
,
giving
him
no
time
*NL*
for
reflection
,
as
in
Petersburg
.
Instead
of
the
new
life
he
had
hoped
*NL*
to
lead
he
still
lived
the
old
life
,
only
in
new
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
three
precepts
of
Freemasonry
Pierre
realized
that
he
did
not
*NL*
fulfill
the
one
which
enjoined
every
Mason
to
set
an
example
of
moral
*NL*
life
,
and
that
of
the
seven
virtues
he
lacked
two
--
morality
and
the
love
*NL*
of
death
.
He
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
fulfilled
another
*NL*
of
the
precepts
--
that
of
reforming
the
human
race
--
and
had
other
*NL*
virtues
--
love
of
his
neighbor
,
and
especially
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
of
1807
he
decided
to
return
to
Petersburg
.
On
the
way
he
*NL*
intended
to
visit
all
his
estates
and
see
for
himself
how
far
his
orders
*NL*
had
been
carried
out
and
in
what
state
were
the
serfs
whom
God
had
*NL*
entrusted
to
his
care
and
whom
he
intended
to
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
steward
,
who
considered
the
young
count
's
attempts
almost
*NL*
insane
--
unprofitable
to
himself
,
to
the
count
,
and
to
the
serfs
--
made
*NL*
some
concessions
.
Continuing
to
represent
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
*NL*
impracticable
,
he
arranged
for
the
erection
of
large
buildings
--
schools
,
*NL*
hospitals
,
and
asylums
--
on
all
the
estates
before
the
master
arrived
.
*NL*
Everywhere
preparations
were
made
not
for
ceremonious
welcomes
-LRB-
which
he
*NL*
knew
Pierre
would
not
like
-RRB-
,
but
for
just
such
gratefully
religious
*NL*
ones
,
with
offerings
of
icons
and
the
bread
and
salt
of
hospitality
,
as
,
*NL*
according
to
his
understanding
of
his
master
,
would
touch
and
delude
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
southern
spring
,
the
comfortable
rapid
traveling
in
a
Vienna
*NL*
carriage
,
and
the
solitude
of
the
road
,
all
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
*NL*
Pierre
.
The
estates
he
had
not
before
visited
were
each
more
picturesque
*NL*
than
the
other
;
the
serfs
everywhere
seemed
thriving
and
touchingly
*NL*
grateful
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
them
.
Everywhere
were
receptions
,
*NL*
which
though
they
embarrassed
Pierre
awakened
a
joyful
feeling
in
the
*NL*
depth
of
his
heart
.
In
one
place
the
peasants
presented
him
with
bread
*NL*
and
salt
and
an
icon
of
Saint
Peter
and
Saint
Paul
,
asking
permission
,
*NL*
as
a
mark
of
their
gratitude
for
the
benefits
he
had
conferred
on
them
,
*NL*
to
build
a
new
chantry
to
the
church
at
their
own
expense
in
honor
of
*NL*
Peter
and
Paul
,
his
patron
saints
.
In
another
place
the
women
with
*NL*
infants
in
arms
met
him
to
thank
him
for
releasing
them
from
hard
work
.
*NL*
On
a
third
estate
the
priest
,
bearing
a
cross
,
came
to
meet
him
*NL*
surrounded
by
children
whom
,
by
the
count
's
generosity
,
he
was
*NL*
instructing
in
reading
,
writing
,
and
religion
.
On
all
his
estates
Pierre
*NL*
saw
with
his
own
eyes
brick
buildings
erected
or
in
course
of
erection
,
*NL*
all
on
one
plan
,
for
hospitals
,
schools
,
and
almshouses
,
which
were
soon
*NL*
to
be
opened
.
Everywhere
he
saw
the
stewards
'
accounts
,
according
to
*NL*
which
the
serfs
'
manorial
labor
had
been
diminished
,
and
heard
the
*NL*
touching
thanks
of
deputations
of
serfs
in
their
full-skirted
blue
*NL*
coats
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Pierre
did
not
know
was
that
the
place
where
they
presented
him
*NL*
with
bread
and
salt
and
wished
to
build
a
chantry
in
honor
of
Peter
and
*NL*
Paul
was
a
market
village
where
a
fair
was
held
on
St.
Peter
's
day
,
and
*NL*
that
the
richest
peasants
-LRB-
who
formed
the
deputation
-RRB-
had
begun
the
*NL*
chantry
long
before
,
but
that
nine
tenths
of
the
peasants
in
that
*NL*
villages
were
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
poverty
.
He
did
not
know
that
*NL*
since
the
nursing
mothers
were
no
longer
sent
to
work
on
his
land
,
they
*NL*
did
still
harder
work
on
their
own
land
.
He
did
not
know
that
the
priest
*NL*
who
met
him
with
the
cross
oppressed
the
peasants
by
his
exactions
,
and
*NL*
that
the
pupils
'
parents
wept
at
having
to
let
him
take
their
children
*NL*
and
secured
their
release
by
heavy
payments
.
He
did
not
know
that
the
*NL*
brick
buildings
,
built
to
plan
,
were
being
built
by
serfs
whose
manorial
*NL*
labor
was
thus
increased
,
though
lessened
on
paper
.
He
did
not
know
that
*NL*
where
the
steward
had
shown
him
in
the
accounts
that
the
serfs
'
payments
*NL*
had
been
diminished
by
a
third
,
their
obligatory
manorial
work
had
been
*NL*
increased
by
a
half
.
And
so
Pierre
was
delighted
with
his
visit
to
his
*NL*
estates
and
quite
recovered
the
philanthropic
mood
in
which
he
had
left
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
wrote
enthusiastic
letters
to
his
``
brother-instructor
''
*NL*
as
he
called
the
Grand
Master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
easy
it
is
,
how
little
effort
it
needs
,
to
do
so
much
good
,
''
*NL*
thought
Pierre
,
``
and
how
little
attention
we
pay
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
pleased
at
the
gratitude
he
received
,
but
felt
abashed
at
*NL*
receiving
it
.
This
gratitude
reminded
him
of
how
much
more
he
might
do
*NL*
for
these
simple
,
kindly
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
steward
,
a
very
stupid
but
cunning
man
who
saw
perfectly
*NL*
through
the
naive
and
intelligent
count
and
played
with
him
as
with
a
*NL*
toy
,
seeing
the
effect
these
prearranged
receptions
had
on
Pierre
,
*NL*
pressed
him
still
harder
with
proofs
of
the
impossibility
and
above
all
*NL*
the
uselessness
of
freeing
the
serfs
,
who
were
quite
happy
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
in
his
secret
soul
agreed
with
the
steward
that
it
would
be
*NL*
difficult
to
imagine
happier
people
,
and
that
God
only
knew
what
would
*NL*
happen
to
them
when
they
were
free
,
but
he
insisted
,
though
reluctantly
,
*NL*
on
what
he
thought
right
.
The
steward
promised
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
count
's
wishes
,
seeing
clearly
that
not
only
would
the
*NL*
count
never
be
able
to
find
out
whether
all
measures
had
been
taken
for
*NL*
the
sale
of
the
land
and
forests
and
to
release
them
from
the
Land
Bank
,
*NL*
but
would
probably
never
even
inquire
and
would
never
know
that
the
*NL*
newly
erected
buildings
were
standing
empty
and
that
the
serfs
continued
*NL*
to
give
in
money
and
work
all
that
other
people
's
serfs
gave
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
all
that
could
be
got
out
of
them
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
from
his
journey
through
South
Russia
in
the
happiest
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
Pierre
carried
out
an
intention
he
had
long
had
of
visiting
his
*NL*
friend
Bolkonski
,
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bogucharovo
lay
in
a
flat
uninteresting
part
of
the
country
among
fields
*NL*
and
forests
of
fir
and
birch
,
which
were
partly
cut
down
.
The
house
lay
*NL*
behind
a
newly
dug
pond
filled
with
water
to
the
brink
and
with
banks
*NL*
still
bare
of
grass
.
It
was
at
the
end
of
a
village
that
stretched
along
*NL*
the
highroad
in
the
midst
of
a
young
copse
in
which
were
a
few
fir
*NL*
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
homestead
consisted
of
a
threshing
floor
,
outhouses
,
stables
,
a
*NL*
bathhouse
,
a
lodge
,
and
a
large
brick
house
with
semicircular
facade
*NL*
still
in
course
of
construction
.
Round
the
house
was
a
garden
newly
laid
*NL*
out
.
The
fences
and
gates
were
new
and
solid
;
two
fire
pumps
and
a
water
*NL*
cart
,
painted
green
,
stood
in
a
shed
;
the
paths
were
straight
,
the
*NL*
bridges
were
strong
and
had
handrails
.
Everything
bore
an
impress
of
*NL*
tidiness
and
good
management
.
Some
domestic
serfs
Pierre
met
,
in
reply
*NL*
to
inquiries
as
to
where
the
prince
lived
,
pointed
out
a
small
newly
*NL*
built
lodge
close
to
the
pond
.
Anton
,
a
man
who
had
looked
after
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
in
his
boyhood
,
helped
Pierre
out
of
his
carriage
,
said
that
the
*NL*
prince
was
at
home
,
and
showed
him
into
a
clean
little
anteroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
struck
by
the
modesty
of
the
small
though
clean
house
after
*NL*
the
brilliant
surroundings
in
which
he
had
last
met
his
friend
in
*NL*
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quickly
entered
the
small
reception
room
with
its
still-unplastered
*NL*
wooden
walls
redolent
of
pine
,
and
would
have
gone
farther
,
but
Anton
*NL*
ran
ahead
on
tiptoe
and
knocked
at
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
came
a
sharp
,
unpleasant
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
visitor
,
''
answered
Anton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
to
wait
,
''
and
the
sound
was
heard
of
a
chair
being
pushed
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
with
rapid
steps
to
the
door
and
suddenly
came
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Prince
Andrew
,
who
came
out
frowning
and
looking
old
.
Pierre
*NL*
embraced
him
and
lifting
his
spectacles
kissed
his
friend
on
the
cheek
*NL*
and
looked
at
him
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
not
expect
you
,
I
am
very
glad
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
said
nothing
;
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
friend
with
surprise
.
He
*NL*
was
struck
by
the
change
in
him
.
His
words
were
kindly
and
there
was
a
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
and
face
,
but
his
eyes
were
dull
and
lifeless
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
evident
wish
to
do
so
he
could
not
give
them
a
joyous
and
*NL*
glad
sparkle
.
Prince
Andrew
had
grown
thinner
,
paler
,
and
more
manly
-
*NL*
looking
,
but
what
amazed
and
estranged
Pierre
till
he
got
used
to
it
*NL*
were
his
inertia
and
a
wrinkle
on
his
brow
indicating
prolonged
*NL*
concentration
on
some
one
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
usually
the
case
with
people
meeting
after
a
prolonged
separation
,
*NL*
it
was
long
before
their
conversation
could
settle
on
anything
.
They
put
*NL*
questions
and
gave
brief
replies
about
things
they
knew
ought
to
be
*NL*
talked
over
at
length
.
At
last
the
conversation
gradually
settled
on
*NL*
some
of
the
topics
at
first
lightly
touched
on
:
their
past
life
,
plans
*NL*
for
the
future
,
Pierre
's
journeys
and
occupations
,
the
war
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
The
preoccupation
and
despondency
which
Pierre
had
noticed
in
his
*NL*
friend
's
look
was
now
still
more
clearly
expressed
in
the
smile
with
*NL*
which
he
listened
to
Pierre
,
especially
when
he
spoke
with
joyful
*NL*
animation
of
the
past
or
the
future
.
It
was
as
if
Prince
Andrew
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
sympathize
with
what
Pierre
was
saying
,
but
could
not
.
The
*NL*
latter
began
to
feel
that
it
was
in
bad
taste
to
speak
of
his
*NL*
enthusiasms
,
dreams
,
and
hopes
of
happiness
or
goodness
,
in
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
presence
.
He
was
ashamed
to
express
his
new
masonic
views
,
*NL*
which
had
been
particularly
revived
and
strengthened
by
his
late
tour
.
*NL*
He
checked
himself
,
fearing
to
seem
naive
,
yet
he
felt
an
irresistible
*NL*
desire
to
show
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
that
he
was
now
a
quite
*NL*
different
,
and
better
,
Pierre
than
he
had
been
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
much
I
have
lived
through
since
then
.
I
hardly
*NL*
know
myself
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
have
altered
much
,
very
much
,
since
then
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
you
?
What
are
your
plans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Plans
!
''
repeated
Prince
Andrew
ironically
.
``
My
plans
?
''
he
said
,
as
if
*NL*
astonished
at
the
word
.
``
Well
,
you
see
,
I
'm
building
.
I
mean
to
settle
*NL*
here
altogether
next
year
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
silently
and
searchingly
into
Prince
Andrew
's
face
,
which
*NL*
had
grown
much
older
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
meant
to
ask
...
''
Pierre
began
,
but
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
talk
of
me
?
...
Talk
to
me
,
yes
,
tell
me
about
your
travels
and
*NL*
all
you
have
been
doing
on
your
estates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
began
describing
what
he
had
done
on
his
estates
,
trying
as
far
*NL*
as
possible
to
conceal
his
own
part
in
the
improvements
that
had
been
*NL*
made
.
Prince
Andrew
several
times
prompted
Pierre
's
story
of
what
he
had
*NL*
been
doing
,
as
though
it
were
all
an
old-time
story
,
and
he
listened
not
*NL*
only
without
interest
but
even
as
if
ashamed
of
what
Pierre
was
telling
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
felt
uncomfortable
and
even
depressed
in
his
friend
's
company
and
*NL*
at
last
became
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
who
evidently
*NL*
also
felt
depressed
and
constrained
with
his
visitor
,
``
I
am
only
*NL*
bivouacking
here
and
have
just
come
to
look
round
.
I
am
going
back
to
my
*NL*
sister
today
.
I
will
introduce
you
to
her
.
But
of
course
you
know
her
*NL*
already
,
''
he
said
,
evidently
trying
to
entertain
a
visitor
with
whom
he
*NL*
now
found
nothing
in
common
.
``
We
will
go
after
dinner
.
And
would
you
now
*NL*
like
to
look
round
my
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
and
walked
about
till
dinnertime
,
talking
of
the
political
*NL*
news
and
common
acquaintances
like
people
who
do
not
know
each
other
*NL*
intimately
.
Prince
Andrew
spoke
with
some
animation
and
interest
only
of
*NL*
the
new
homestead
he
was
constructing
and
its
buildings
,
but
even
here
,
*NL*
while
on
the
scaffolding
,
in
the
midst
of
a
talk
explaining
the
future
*NL*
arrangements
of
the
house
,
he
interrupted
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
this
is
not
at
all
interesting
.
Let
us
have
dinner
,
and
then
*NL*
we
'll
set
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
,
conversation
turned
on
Pierre
's
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
much
surprised
when
I
heard
of
it
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
blushed
,
as
he
always
did
when
it
was
mentioned
,
and
said
*NL*
hurriedly
:
``
I
will
tell
you
some
time
how
it
all
happened
.
But
you
know
*NL*
it
is
all
over
,
and
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forever
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Nothing
's
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
how
it
all
ended
,
do
n't
you
?
You
heard
of
the
duel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
had
to
go
through
that
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
I
thank
God
for
is
that
I
did
not
kill
that
man
,
''
said
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
.
``
To
kill
a
vicious
dog
is
a
very
good
*NL*
thing
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
to
kill
a
man
is
bad
--
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
wrong
?
''
urged
Prince
Andrew
.
``
It
is
not
given
to
man
to
know
*NL*
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
.
Men
always
did
and
always
will
err
,
and
*NL*
in
nothing
more
than
in
what
they
consider
right
and
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
harm
to
another
is
wrong
,
''
said
Pierre
,
feeling
with
pleasure
*NL*
that
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
Prince
Andrew
was
roused
,
had
*NL*
begun
to
talk
,
and
wanted
to
express
what
had
brought
him
to
his
present
*NL*
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
has
told
you
what
is
bad
for
another
man
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
!
Bad
!
''
exclaimed
Pierre
.
``
We
all
know
what
is
bad
for
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
know
that
,
but
the
harm
I
am
conscious
of
in
myself
is
*NL*
something
I
can
not
inflict
on
others
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
growing
more
*NL*
and
more
animated
and
evidently
wishing
to
express
his
new
outlook
to
*NL*
Pierre
.
He
spoke
in
French
.
``
I
only
know
two
very
real
evils
in
life
:
*NL*
remorse
and
illness
.
The
only
good
is
the
absence
of
those
evils
.
To
*NL*
live
for
myself
avoiding
those
two
evils
is
my
whole
philosophy
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
love
of
one
's
neighbor
,
and
self-sacrifice
?
''
began
Pierre
.
``
No
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
agree
with
you
!
To
live
only
so
as
not
to
do
evil
and
not
to
have
*NL*
to
repent
is
not
enough
.
I
lived
like
that
,
I
lived
for
myself
and
*NL*
ruined
my
life
.
And
only
now
when
I
am
living
,
or
at
least
trying

*NL*
-LRB-
Pierre
's
modesty
made
him
correct
himself
-RRB-
``
to
live
for
others
,
only
*NL*
now
have
I
understood
all
the
happiness
of
life

No
,
I
shall
not
agree
*NL*
with
you
,
and
you
do
not
really
believe
what
you
are
saying
.
''
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
looked
silently
at
Pierre
with
an
ironic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
see
my
sister
,
Princess
Mary
,
you
'll
get
on
with
her
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
Perhaps
you
are
right
for
yourself
,
''
he
added
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
,
``
but
everyone
lives
in
his
own
way
.
You
lived
for
yourself
and
*NL*
say
you
nearly
ruined
your
life
and
only
found
happiness
when
you
began
*NL*
living
for
others
.
I
experienced
just
the
reverse
.
I
lived
for
glory
.
--
*NL*
And
after
all
what
is
glory
?
The
same
love
of
others
,
a
desire
to
do
*NL*
something
for
them
,
a
desire
for
their
approval
.
--
So
I
lived
for
others
,
*NL*
and
not
almost
,
but
quite
,
ruined
my
life
.
And
I
have
become
calmer
*NL*
since
I
began
to
live
only
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
mean
by
living
only
for
yourself
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
*NL*
growing
excited
.
``
What
about
your
son
,
your
sister
,
and
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
just
the
same
as
myself

they
are
not
others

explained
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
``
The
others
,
one
's
neighbors

as
you
and
*NL*
Princess
Mary
call
it

are
the
chief
source
of
all
error

evil

Le
*NL*
prochain

your
Kiev
peasants
to
whom
you
want
to
do
good

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
Pierre
with
a
mocking
,
challenging
expression
.
He
*NL*
evidently
wished
to
draw
him
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
joking
,
''
replied
Pierre
,
growing
more
and
more
excited
.
``
What
*NL*
error
or
evil
can
there
be
in
my
wishing
to
do
good
,
and
even
doing
a
*NL*
little
--
though
I
did
very
little
and
did
it
very
badly
?
What
evil
can
*NL*
there
be
in
it
if
unfortunate
people
,
our
serfs
,
people
like
ourselves
,
*NL*
were
growing
up
and
dying
with
no
idea
of
God

truth
beyond
*NL*
ceremonies
and
meaningless
prayers

are
now
instructed
in
a
*NL*
comforting
belief
in
future
life
,
retribution
,
recompense

and
*NL*
consolation
?
What
evil
and
error
are
there
in
it
,
if
people
were
dying
*NL*
of
disease
without
help
while
material
assistance
could
so
easily
be

rendered
,
and
I
supplied
them
with
a
doctor

a
hospital
,
and
an
asylum
*NL*
for
the
aged

And
is
it
not
a
palpable

unquestionable
good
if
a
*NL*
peasant
,
or
a
woman
with
a
baby
,
has
no
rest
day
or
night
and
I
give
*NL*
them
rest
and
leisure
?

said
Pierre
,
hurrying
and
lisping
.
``
And
I
have
*NL*
done
that
though
badly

to
a
small
extent

I
have
done
something
*NL*
toward
it

you
can
not
persuade
me
that
it
was
not
a
good
action

*NL*
more
than
that
,
you
ca
n't
make
me
believe
that
you
do
not
think
so
*NL*
yourself

And
the
main
thing
is
,

he
continued
,
``
that
I
know
,
and
know
*NL*
for
certain

that
the
enjoyment

doing
this
good
is
the
only
sure
*NL*
happiness
in
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
put
it
like

quite
a

Prince
Andrew

``
I
build

out
a
garden

you
build

may
serve
as
a

what

right

good
must
be
judged
by

They
rose
from
the
table
and
sat
down
in
the
entrance
porch
which
served
*NL*
as
a
veranda
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
let
's
argue
then
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
You
talk
of
schools
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
crooking
a
finger
,
``
education
and
so
forth
;
that
is
,
you
want
*NL*
to
raise
him
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
a
peasant
who
passed
by
them
taking
off
his
*NL*
cap
-RRB-
``
from
his
animal
condition
and
awaken
in
him
spiritual
needs
,
while
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
that
animal
happiness
is
the
only
happiness
possible
,
and
*NL*
that
is
just
what
you
want
to
deprive
him
of
.
I
envy
him
,
but
you
want
*NL*
to
make
him
what
I
am
,
without
giving
him
my
means
.
Then
you
say
,
*NL*
`
lighten
his
toil
.
'
But
as
I
see
it
,
physical
labor
is
as
essential
to
*NL*
him
,
as
much
a
condition
of
his
existence
,
as
mental
activity
is
to
you
*NL*
or
me
.
You
ca
n't
help
thinking
.
I
go
to
bed
after
two
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
thoughts
come
and
I
ca
n't
sleep
but
toss
about
till
dawn
,
because
I
*NL*
think
and
ca
n't
help
thinking
,
just
as
he
ca
n't
help
plowing
and
mowing
;
*NL*
if
he
did
n't
,
he
would
go
to
the
drink
shop
or
fall
ill
.
Just
as
I
could
*NL*
not
stand
his
terrible
physical
labor
but
should
die
of
it
in
a
week
,
so
*NL*
he
could
not
stand
my
physical
idleness
,
but
would
grow
fat
and
die
.
The
*NL*
third
thing
--
what
else
was
it
you
talked
about
?
''
and
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
crooked
a
third
finger
.
``
Ah
,
yes
,
hospitals
,
medicine

He
has
a
fit
,
he
*NL*
is
dying
,
and
you
come
and
bleed
him
and
patch
him
up
.
He
will
drag
*NL*
about
as
a
cripple
,
a
burden
to
everybody
,
for
another
ten
years
.
It
*NL*
would
be
far
easier
and
simpler
for
him
to
die
.
Others
are
being
born
*NL*
and
there
are
plenty
of
them
as
it
is
.
It
would
be
different
if
you
*NL*
grudged
losing
a
laborer
--
that
's
how
I
regard
him
--
but
you
want
to
cure
*NL*
him
from
love
of
him
.
And
he
does
not
want
that
.
And
besides
,
what
a
*NL*
notion
that
medicine
ever
cured
anyone
!
Killed
them
,
yes
!
''
said
he
,
*NL*
frowning
angrily
and
turning
away
from
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
expressed
his
ideas
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
it
was
*NL*
evident
he
had
reflected
on
this
subject
more
than
once
,
and
he
spoke
*NL*
readily
and
rapidly
like
a
man
who
has
not
talked
for
a
long
time
.
His
*NL*
glance
became
more
animated
as
his
conclusions
became
more
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
is
dreadful
,
dreadful
!
''
said
Pierre
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
how
*NL*
one
can
live
with
such
ideas

I
had
such
moments
myself
not
long
ago
,
in
*NL*
Moscow
and
when
traveling
,
but
at
such
times
I
collapsed
so
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
live
at
all
--
everything
seems
hateful
to
me
...
myself
most
of
all
.
Then
*NL*
I
do
n't
eat
,
do
n't
wash
...
and
how
is
it
with
you
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
wash
?
That
is
not
cleanly
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
;
``
on
the
*NL*
contrary
one
must
try
to
make
one
's
life
as
pleasant
as
possible
.
I
'm
*NL*
alive
,
that
is
not
my
fault
,
so
I
must
live
out
my
life
as
best
I
can
*NL*
without
hurting
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
with
such
ideas
what
motive
have
you
for
living
?
One
would
sit
*NL*
without
moving
,
undertaking
nothing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
as
it
is
leaves
one
no
peace
.
I
should
be
thankful
to
do
nothing
,
*NL*
but
here
on
the
one
hand
the
local
nobility
have
done
me
the
honor
to
*NL*
choose
me
to
be
their
marshal
;
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
get
out
of
it

*NL*
They
could
not
understand
that
I
have
not
the
necessary
qualifications
*NL*
for
it
--
the
kind
of
good-natured
,
fussy
shallowness
necessary
for
the
*NL*
position
.
Then
there
's
this
house
,
which
must
be
built
in
order
to
have
*NL*
a
nook
of
one
's
own
in
which
to
be
quiet

And
now
there
's
this

recruiting

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

you
serving
in
the
army

``
After
Austerlitz

said
Prince
Andrew
gloomily
.
``
No

thank
you
very
*NL*
much

I
have
promised
myself
not
to
serve
again
in
the
active
Russian

army

And
I
wo
n't
--
not
even
if
Bonaparte
were
here
at
Smolensk
*NL*
threatening
Bald
Hills

even
then
I
would

Russian
army

*NL*
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
''
he
continued
,
recovering
his
composure
,
``
now
*NL*
there
's
this
recruiting
.
My
father
is
chief
in
command
of
the
Third
*NL*
District
,
and
my
only
way
of
avoiding
active
service
is
to
serve
under
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
serving
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
a
little
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
do
you
serve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
for
this
reason
!
My
father
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
*NL*
his
time
.
But
he
is
growing
old
,
and
though
not
exactly
cruel
he
has
too
*NL*
energetic
a
character
.
He
is
so
accustomed
to
unlimited
power
that
he
is
*NL*
terrible
,
and
now
he
has
this
authority
of
a
commander-in-chief
of
the
*NL*
recruiting
,
granted
by
the
Emperor
.
If
I
had
been
two
hours
late
a
*NL*
fortnight
ago
he
would
have
had
a
paymaster
's
clerk
at
Yukhnovna
*NL*
hanged
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
smile
.
``
So
I
am
serving
because
I
*NL*
alone
have
any
influence
with
my
father
,
and
now
and
then
can
save
him
*NL*
from
actions
which
would
torment
him
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
is
not
as
you
imagine
,

Prince
Andrew
continued
.
``
I
did
*NL*
not
,
and
do
not
,
in
the
least
care
about
that
scoundrel
of
a
clerk
who
*NL*
had
stolen
some
boots
from
the
recruits
;
I
should
even
have
been
very
*NL*
glad
to
see
him
hanged
,
but
I
was
sorry
for
my
father
--
that
again
is
for
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
grew
more
and
more
animated
.
His
eyes
glittered
feverishly
*NL*
while
he
tried
to
prove
to
Pierre
that
in
his
actions
there
was
no
*NL*
desire
to
do
good
to
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
you
wish
to
liberate
your
serfs
,
''
he
continued
;
``
that
is
a
*NL*
very
good
thing
,
but
not
for
you
--
I
do
n't
suppose
you
ever
had
anyone
*NL*
flogged
or
sent
to
Siberia
--
and
still
less
for
your
serfs
.
If
they
are
*NL*
beaten
,
flogged
,
or
sent
to
Siberia
,
I
do
n't
suppose
they
are
any
the
*NL*
worse
off
.
In
Siberia
they
lead
the
same
animal
life
,
and
the
stripes
on
*NL*
their
bodies
heal
,
and
they
are
happy
as
before
.
But
it
is
a
good
thing
*NL*
for
proprietors
who
perish
morally
,
bring
remorse
upon
themselves
,
*NL*
stifle
this
remorse
and
grow
callous
,
as
a
result
of
being
able
to
*NL*
inflict
punishments
justly
and
unjustly
.
It
is
those
people
I
pity
,
and
*NL*
for
their
sake
I
should
like
to
liberate
the
serfs
.
You
may
not
have
*NL*
seen
,
but
I
have
seen
,
how
good
men
brought
up
in
those
traditions
of
*NL*
unlimited
power
,
in
time
when
they
grow
more
irritable
,
become
cruel
and
*NL*
harsh
,
are
conscious
of
it
,
but
can
not
restrain
themselves
and
grow
more
*NL*
and
more
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
spoke
so
earnestly
that
Pierre
could
not
help
thinking
*NL*
that
these
thoughts
had
been
suggested
to
Prince
Andrew
by
his
father
's
*NL*
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
what
I
'm
sorry
for

human
dignity
,
peace
of
mind
,
purity
,
and
*NL*
not
the
serfs
'
backs
and
foreheads
,
which
,
beat
and
shave
as
you
may
,
*NL*
always
remain
the
same
backs

foreheads

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
A
thousand
times
no

shall
never
agree

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Andrew
and
Pierre
got
into
the
open
carriage
and
drove
to
*NL*
Bald
Hills
.
Prince
Andrew
,
glancing
at
Pierre
,
broke
the
silence
now
and
*NL*
then
with
remarks
which
showed
that
he
was
in
a
good
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pointing
to
the
fields
,
he
spoke
of
the
improvements
he
was
making
in
*NL*
his
husbandry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
remained
gloomily
silent
,
answering
in
monosyllables
and
*NL*
apparently
immersed
in
his
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
that
Prince
Andrew
was
unhappy
,
had
gone
astray
,
did
not
*NL*
see
the
true
light
,
and
that
he
,
Pierre
,
ought
to
aid
,
enlighten
,
and
*NL*
raise
him
.
But
as
soon
as
he
thought
of
what
he
should
say
,
he
felt
that
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
with
one
word
,
one
argument
,
would
upset
all
his
teaching
,
*NL*
and
he
shrank
from
beginning
,
afraid
of
exposing
to
possible
ridicule
*NL*
what
to
him
was
precious
and
sacred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
why
do
you
think
so
?
''
Pierre
suddenly
began
,
lowering
his
head
*NL*
and
looking
like
a
bull
about
to
charge
,
``
why
do
you
think
so
?
You
*NL*
should
not
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
?
What
about
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
life
,
about
man
's
destiny
.
It
ca
n't
be
so
.
I
myself
thought
like
*NL*
that
,
and
do
you
know
what
saved
me
?
Freemasonry
!
No
,
do
n't
smile
.
*NL*
Freemasonry
is
not
a
religious
ceremonial
sect
,
as
I
thought
it
was
:
*NL*
Freemasonry
is
the
best
expression
of
the
best
,
the
eternal
,
aspects
of
*NL*
humanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
explain
Freemasonry
as
he
understood
it
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
He
said
that
Freemasonry
is
the
teaching
of
Christianity
freed
*NL*
from
the
bonds
of
State
and
Church
,
a
teaching
of
equality
,
brotherhood
,
*NL*
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
our
holy
brotherhood
has
the
real
meaning
of
life
,
all
the
rest
is
*NL*
a
dream
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Understand
,
my
dear
fellow
,
that
outside
this
*NL*
union
all
is
filled
with
deceit
and
falsehood
and
I
agree
with
you
that
*NL*
nothing
is
left
for
an
intelligent
and
good
man
but
to
live
out
his
*NL*
life
,
like
you
,
merely
trying
not
to
harm
others
.
But
make
our
*NL*
fundamental
convictions
your
own
,
join
our
brotherhood
,
give
yourself
up
*NL*
to
us
,
let
yourself
be
guided
,
and
you
will
at
once
feel
yourself
,
as
I
*NL*
have
felt
myself
,
a
part
of
that
vast
invisible
chain
the
beginning
of
*NL*
which
is
hidden
in
heaven
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
looking
straight
in
front
of
him
,
listened
in
silence
to
*NL*
Pierre
's
words
.
More
than
once
,
when
the
noise
of
the
wheels
prevented
*NL*
his
catching
what
Pierre
said
,
he
asked
him
to
repeat
it
,
and
by
the
*NL*
peculiar
glow
that
came
into
Prince
Andrew
's
eyes
and
by
his
silence
,
*NL*
Pierre
saw
that
his
words
were
not
in
vain
and
that
Prince
Andrew
would
*NL*
not
interrupt
him
or
laugh
at
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
a
river
that
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
which
they
had
to
*NL*
cross
by
ferry
.
While
the
carriage
and
horses
were
being
placed
on
it
,
*NL*
they
also
stepped
on
the
raft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
leaning
his
arms
on
the
raft
railing
,
gazed
silently
at
*NL*
the
flooding
waters
glittering
in
the
setting
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
Pierre
asked
.
``
Why
are
you
silent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
think
about
it
?
I
am
listening
to
you
.
It
's
all
very
well
...
*NL*
You
say
:
join
our
brotherhood
and
we
will
show
you
the
aim
of
life
,
the
*NL*
destiny
of
man
,
and
the
laws
which
govern
the
world
.
But
who
are
we
?
*NL*
Men
.
How
is
it
you
know
everything
?
Why
do
I
alone
not
see
what
you
see
?
*NL*
You
see
a
reign
of
goodness
and
truth
on
earth
,
but
I
do
n't
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
in
a
future
life
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
future
life
?
''
Prince
Andrew
repeated
,
but
Pierre
,
giving
him
no
time
*NL*
to
reply
,
took
the
repetition
for
a
denial
,
the
more
readily
as
he
knew
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
former
atheistic
convictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
ca
n't

a
reign

Nor
could

and
it
can
not
be
seen

looks
on
our
life
here
as
the
end
of
*NL*
everything
.
On
earth
,
here
on
this

-LRB-
Pierre
pointed
to
the
*NL*
fields
-RRB-
,
``
there
is
no
truth
,
all
is
false
and
evil
;
but
in
the
universe

*NL*
in
the

there
is
a
kingdom

and
we
who
are
now

the
children
of

are
--
eternally
--
children

Do

in
my
soul

part
of
this
vast
harmonious
whole
?
*NL*
Do
n't
I
feel
that
I
form
one
link
,
one
step
,
between
the
lower
and
*NL*
higher
beings
,
in
this
vast
harmonious
multitude
of
beings
in
whom
the
*NL*
Deity
--
the
Supreme
Power
if
you
prefer
the
term
--
is
manifest
?
If
I
see
,
*NL*
clearly
see
,
that
ladder
leading
from
plant
to
man
,
why
should
I
suppose
*NL*
it
breaks
off
at
me
and
does
not
go
farther
and
farther
?
I
feel
that
I
*NL*
can
not
vanish
,
since
nothing
vanishes
in
this
world
,
but
that
I
shall
*NL*
always
exist
and
always
have
existed
.
I
feel
that
beyond
me
and
above
me
*NL*
there
are
spirits
,
and
that
in
this
world
there
is
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
Herder
's
theory
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
but
it
is
not
that
*NL*
which
can
convince
me
,
dear
friend
--
life
and
death
are
what
convince
.
*NL*
What
convinces
is
when
one
sees
a
being
dear
to
one
,
bound
up
with
one
's
*NL*
own
life
,
before
whom
one
was
to
blame
and
had
hoped
to
make
it
right
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Prince
Andrew
's
voice
trembled
and
he
turned
away
-RRB-
,
``
and
suddenly
that
*NL*
being
is
seized
with
pain
,
suffers
,
and
ceases
to
exist
...
Why
?
It
*NL*
can
not
be
that
there
is
no
answer
.
And
I
believe
there
is
...
That
's
*NL*
what
convinces
,
that
is
what
has
convinced
me
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
of
course
,
''
said
Pierre
,
``
is
n't
that
what
I
'm
saying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
All
I
say
is
that
it
is
not
argument
that
convinces
me
of
the
*NL*
necessity
of
a
future
life
,
but
this
:
when
you
go
hand
in
hand
with
*NL*
someone
and
all
at
once
that
person
vanishes
there
,
into
nowhere
,
and
*NL*
you
yourself
are
left
facing
that
abyss
,
and
look
in
.
And
I
have
looked
*NL*
in
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
it
then
!
You
know
that
there
is
a
there
and
there
is
a
*NL*
Someone
?
There
is
the
future
life
.
The
Someone
is
--
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
did
not
reply
.
The
carriage
and
horses
had
long
since
been
*NL*
taken
off
,
onto
the
farther
bank
,
and
reharnessed
.
The
sun
had
sunk
half
*NL*
below
the
horizon
and
an
evening
frost
was
starring
the
puddles
near
the
*NL*
ferry
,
but
Pierre
and
Andrew
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
footmen
,
*NL*
coachmen
,
and
ferrymen
,
still
stood
on
the
raft
and
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
a
God
and
future
life
,
there
is
truth
and
good
,
and
man
's
*NL*
highest
happiness
consists
in
striving
to
attain
them
.
We
must
live
,
we
*NL*
must
love
,
and
we
must
believe
that
we
live
not
only
today
on
this
scrap
*NL*
of
earth
,
but
have
lived
and
shall
live
forever
,
there
,
in
the
Whole
,
''
*NL*
said
Pierre
,
and
he
pointed
to
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
stood
leaning
on
the
railing
of
the
raft
listening
to
*NL*
Pierre
,
and
he
gazed
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
reflection
of
the
*NL*
sun
gleaming
on
the
blue
waters
.
There
was
perfect
stillness
.
Pierre
*NL*
became
silent
.
The
raft
had
long
since
stopped
and
only
the
waves
of
the
*NL*
current
beat
softly
against
it
below
.
Prince
Andrew
felt
as
if
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
waves
kept
up
a
refrain
to
Pierre
's
words
,
whispering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
,
and
glanced
with
a
radiant
,
childlike
,
tender
look
at
*NL*
Pierre
's
face
,
flushed
and
rapturous
,
but
yet
shy
before
his
superior
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
it
only
were
so
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
However
,
it
is
time
to
*NL*
get
on
,
''
he
added
,
and
,
stepping
off
the
raft
,
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
*NL*
to
which
Pierre
had
pointed
,
and
for
the
first
time
since
Austerlitz
saw
*NL*
that
high
,
everlasting
sky
he
had
seen
while
lying
on
that
battlefield
;
*NL*
and
something
that
had
long
been
slumbering
,
something
that
was
best
*NL*
within
him
,
suddenly
awoke
,
joyful
and
youthful
,
in
his
soul
.
It
*NL*
vanished
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
the
customary
conditions
of
his
life
,
*NL*
but
he
knew
that
this
feeling
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
develop
*NL*
existed
within
him
.
His
meeting
with
Pierre
formed
an
epoch
in
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
life
.
Though
outwardly
he
continued
to
live
in
the
same
old
*NL*
way
,
inwardly
he
began
a
new
life
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
getting
dusk
when
Prince
Andrew
and
Pierre
drove
up
to
the
front
*NL*
entrance
of
the
house
at
Bald
Hills
.
As
they
approached
the
house
,
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
with
a
smile
drew
Pierre
's
attention
to
a
commotion
going
*NL*
on
at
the
back
porch
.
A
woman
,
bent
with
age
,
with
a
wallet
on
her
back
,
*NL*
and
a
short
,
long-haired
,
young
man
in
a
black
garment
had
rushed
back
*NL*
to
the
gate
on
seeing
the
carriage
driving
up
.
Two
women
ran
out
after
*NL*
them
,
and
all
four
,
looking
round
at
the
carriage
,
ran
in
dismay
up
the
*NL*
steps
of
the
back
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
Mary
's
`
God
's
folk
,
'
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
They
have
mistaken
*NL*
us
for
my
father
.
This
is
the
one
matter
in
which
she
disobeys
him
.
He
*NL*
orders
these
pilgrims
to
be
driven
away
,
but
she
receives
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
`
God
's
folk
'
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
no
time
to
answer
.
The
servants
came
out
to
meet
them
,
*NL*
and
he
asked
where
the
old
prince
was
and
whether
he
was
expected
back
*NL*
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
had
gone
to
the
town
and
was
expected
back
any
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
led
Pierre
to
his
own
apartments
,
which
were
always
kept
*NL*
in
perfect
order
and
readiness
for
him
in
his
father
's
house
;
he
himself
*NL*
went
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
and
see
my
sister
,
''
he
said
to
Pierre
when
he
returned
.
``
I
*NL*
have
not
found
her
yet
,
she
is
hiding
now
,
sitting
with
her
`
God
's
*NL*
folk
.
'
It
will
serve
her
right
,
she
will
be
confused
,
but
you
will
see
*NL*
her
`
God
's
folk
.
'
It
's
really
very
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
`
God
's
folk
'
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
and
you
'll
see
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
really
was
disconcerted
and
red
patches
came
on
her
face
*NL*
when
they
went
in
.
In
her
snug
room
,
with
lamps
burning
before
the
icon
*NL*
stand
,
a
young
lad
with
a
long
nose
and
long
hair
,
wearing
a
monk
's
*NL*
cassock
,
sat
on
the
sofa
beside
her
,
behind
a
samovar
.
Near
them
,
in
an
*NL*
armchair
,
sat
a
thin
,
shriveled
,
old
woman
,
with
a
meek
expression
on
*NL*
her
childlike
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
why
did
n't
you
warn
me
?
''
said
the
princess
,
with
mild
reproach
,
*NL*
as
she
stood
before
her
pilgrims
like
a
hen
before
her
chickens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charmee
de
vous
voir
.
Je
suis
tres
contente
de
vous
voir
,
''
*
she
said
*NL*
to
Pierre
as
he
kissed
her
hand
.
She
had
known
him
as
a
child
,
and
now
*NL*
his
friendship
with
Andrew
,
his
misfortune
with
his
wife
,
and
above
all
*NL*
his
kindly
,
simple
face
disposed
her
favorably
toward
him
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
him
with
her
beautiful
radiant
eyes
and
seemed
to
say
,
``
I
like
you
very
*NL*
much
,
but
please
do
n't
laugh
at
my
people
.
''
After
exchanging
the
first
*NL*
greetings
,
they
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Delighted
to
see
you
.
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
Ivanushka
is
here
too
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
glancing
with
a
*NL*
smile
at
the
young
pilgrim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
!
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
imploringly
.
``
Il
faut
que
vous
sachiez
que
*NL*
c'est
une
femme
,
''
*
said
Prince
Andrew
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
au
nom
de
Dieu
!
''
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
Princess
Mary
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
You
must
know
that
this
is
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
``
For
heaven
's
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Prince
Andrew
's
ironical
tone
toward
the
pilgrims
*NL*
and
Princess
Mary
's
helpless
attempts
to
protect
them
were
their
*NL*
customary
long-established
relations
on
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
,
ma
bonne
amie
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
vous
devriez
au
contraire
*NL*

`
etre
reconnaissante

ce
que
j'
explique
a
Pierre

''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
you
ought
on
the
contrary
to
be
grateful
to

for
*NL*
explaining
to
Pierre
your
intimacy
with
this
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
Pierre
,
gazing
over
his
spectacles
with
curiosity
and
*NL*
seriousness
-LRB-
for
which
Princess
Mary
was
specially
grateful
to
him
-RRB-
into
*NL*
Ivanushka
's
face
,
who
,
seeing
that
she
was
being
spoken
about
,
looked
*NL*
round
at
them
all
with
crafty
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
embarrassment
on
her
people
's
account
was
quite
*NL*
unnecessary
.
They
were
not
in
the
least
abashed
.
The
old
woman
,
lowering
*NL*
her
eyes
but
casting
side
glances
at
the
newcomers
,
had
turned
her
cup
*NL*
upside
down
and
placed
a
nibbled
bit
of
sugar
beside
it
,
and
sat
quietly
*NL*
in
her
armchair
,
though
hoping
to
be
offered
another
cup
of
tea
.
*NL*
Ivanushka
,
sipping
out
of
her
saucer
,
looked
with
sly
womanish
eyes
from
*NL*
under
her
brows
at
the
young
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
?
To
Kiev

Prince
Andrew
asked
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
good
sir
,
''
she
answered
garrulously
.
``
Just
at
Christmastime
I

was
deemed
worthy

``
And

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Ivanushka
,
trying
to
speak
in
a
bass
*NL*
voice
.
``
I
only
came
across
Pelageya
in
Yukhnovo

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
interrupted
her
companion
;
she
evidently
wished
to
tell
what
*NL*
she
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Kolyazin

a

*NL*
``
What

asked
Prince

*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew

do

off

said
Princess
Mary
.
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

once
gave

Go

a
wonder-working

*NL*
the
Holy
Mother

God
has
been
revealed

'
On
hearing
those
words
I
said
*NL*
good-by
to
the
holy
folk
and
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
,
only
the
pilgrim
woman
went
on
in
measured
tones
,
*NL*
drawing
in
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
come

naively

who

listened
attentively
to
the
pilgrim

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

master

what
are
you

exclaimed
the
horrified
Pelageya

*NL*
turning
to
Princess
Mary
for
support

*NL*
*NL*
``
They

*NL*
``

exclaimed
the

crossing
herself

``
Oh

There
was
a

said

`
The

as
soon

he
dreamed

catacombs
came
to
him

said
,

So
he
begged

`
Take
*NL*
me
to
her
,
take
me
to
her
.
'
It
's
the
real
truth
I
'm
telling
you
,
I
saw
*NL*
it
myself
.
So
he
was
brought
,
quite
blind
,
straight
to
her
,
and
he
goes
*NL*
up
to
her
and
falls
down
and
says
,
`
Make
me
whole
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
I
'll
*NL*
give
thee
what
the
Tsar
bestowed
on
me
.
'
I
saw
it
myself
,
master
,
the
*NL*
star
is
fixed
into
the
icon
.
Well
,
and
what
do
you
think
?
He
received
*NL*
his
sight
!
It
's
a
sin
to
speak
so
.
God
will
punish
you
,
''
she
said
*NL*
admonishingly
,
turning
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
the
star
get
into
the
icon
?
''
Pierre
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
the
Holy
Mother
promoted
to
the
rank
of
general
?
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
suddenly
grew
quite
pale
and
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
master
,
master
,
what
a
sin
!
And
you
who
have
a
son
!
''
she
began
,
her
*NL*
pallor
suddenly
turning
to
a
vivid
red
.
``
Master
,
what
have
you
said
?
God
*NL*
forgive
you
!
''
And
she
crossed
herself
.
``
Lord
forgive
him
!
My
dear
,
what
*NL*
does
it
mean
?
...
''
she
asked
,
turning
to
Princess
Mary
.
She
got
up
and
,
*NL*
almost
crying
,
began
to
arrange
her
wallet
.
She
evidently
felt
*NL*
frightened
and
ashamed
to
have
accepted
charity
in
a
house
where
such
*NL*
things
could
be
said
,
and
was
at
the
same
time
sorry
to
have
now
to
*NL*
forgo
the
charity
of
this
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
why
need
you
do
it
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
Why
did
you
come
to
*NL*
me
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Pelageya
,
I
was
joking
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Princesse
,
ma
parole
,
je
*NL*
n'ai
pas
voulu
l'offenser
.
*
I
did
not
mean
anything
,
I
was
only
*NL*
joking
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
shyly
and
trying
to
efface
his
offense
.
``
It
*NL*
was
all
my
fault
,
and
Andrew
was
only
joking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Princess
,
on
my
word
,
I
did
not
wish
to
offend
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
stopped
doubtfully
,
but
in
Pierre
's
face
there
was
such
a
look
*NL*
of
sincere
penitence
,
and
Prince
Andrew
glanced
so
meekly
now
at
her
and
*NL*
now
at
Pierre
,
that
she
was
gradually
reassured
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
pilgrim
woman
was
appeased
and
,
being
encouraged
to
talk
,
gave
a
*NL*
long
account
of
Father
Amphilochus
,
who
led
so
holy
a
life
that
his
*NL*
hands
smelled
of
incense
,
and
how
on
her
last
visit
to
Kiev
some
monks
*NL*
she
knew
let
her
have
the
keys
of
the
catacombs
,
and
how
she
,
taking
*NL*
some
dried
bread
with
her
,
had
spent
two
days
in
the
catacombs
with
the
*NL*
saints
.
``
I
'd
pray
awhile
to
one
,
ponder
awhile
,
then
go
on
to
another
.
*NL*
I
'd
sleep
a
bit
and
then
again
go
and
kiss
the
relics
,
and
there
was
*NL*
such
peace
all
around
,
such
blessedness
,
that
one
do
n't
want
to
come
*NL*
out
,
even
into
the
light
of
heaven
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
listened
to
her
attentively
and
seriously
.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
then
,
leaving
``
God
's
folk
''
to
finish
their
tea
,
*NL*
Princess
Mary
took
Pierre
into
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
really
did
not
mean
to
hurt
her
feelings
.
I
understand
them
so
*NL*
well
and
have
the
greatest
respect
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
at
him
silently
and
smiled
affectionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
known
you
a
long
time
,
you
see
,
and
am
as
fond
of
you
as
of
a
*NL*
brother
,
''
she
said
.
``
How
do
you
find
Andrew
?
''
she
added
hurriedly
,
not
*NL*
giving
him
time
to
reply
to
her
affectionate
words
.
``
I
am
very
anxious
*NL*
about
him
.
His
health
was
better
in
the
winter
,
but
last
spring
his
*NL*
wound
reopened
and
the
doctor
said
he
ought
to
go
away
for
a
cure
.
And
I
*NL*
am
also
very
much
afraid
for
him
spiritually
.
He
has
not
a
character
*NL*
like
us
women
who
,
when
we
suffer
,
can
weep
away
our
sorrows
.
He
keeps
*NL*
it
all
within
him
.
Today
he
is
cheerful
and
in
good
spirits
,
but
that
is
*NL*
the
effect
of
your
visit
--
he
is
not
often
like
that
.
If
you
could
*NL*
persuade
him
to
go
abroad
.
He
needs
activity
,
and
this
quiet
regular
*NL*
life
is
very
bad
for
him
.
Others
do
n't
notice
it
,
but
I
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
ten
o'clock
the
men
servants
rushed
to
the
front
door
,
hearing
*NL*
the
bells
of
the
old
prince
's
carriage
approaching
.
Prince
Andrew
and
*NL*
Pierre
also
went
out
into
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
asked
the
old
prince
,
noticing
Pierre
as
he
got
out
of
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Very
glad
!
Kiss
me
,
''
he
said
,
having
learned
who
the
young
stranger
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
was
in
a
good
temper
and
very
gracious
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
supper
,
Prince
Andrew
,
coming
back
to
his
father
's
study
,
found
*NL*
him
disputing
hotly
with
his
visitor
.
Pierre
was
maintaining
that
a
time
*NL*
would
come
when
there
would
be
no
more
wars
.
The
old
prince
disputed
it
*NL*
chaffingly
,
but
without
getting
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drain
the
blood
from
men
's
veins
and
put
in
water
instead
,
then
there
*NL*
will
be
no
more
war
!
Old
women
's
nonsense
--
old
women
's
nonsense
!
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
but
still
he
patted
Pierre
affectionately
on
the
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
then
went
up
to
the
table
where
Prince
Andrew
,
evidently
not
wishing
to
*NL*
join
in
the
conversation
,
was
looking
over
the
papers
his
father
had
*NL*
brought
from
town
.
The
old
prince
went
up
to
him
and
began
to
talk
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marshal
,
a
Count
Rostov
,
has
n't
sent
half
his
contingent
.
He
came
*NL*
to
town
and
wanted
to
invite
me
to
dinner
--
I
gave
him
a
pretty
*NL*
dinner
!
...
And
there
,
look
at
this
...
Well
,
my
boy
,
''
the
old
prince
*NL*
went
on
,
addressing
his
son
and
patting
Pierre
on
the
shoulder
.
``
A
fine
*NL*
fellow
--
your
friend
--
I
like
him
!
He
stirs
me
up
.
Another
says
clever
*NL*
things
and
one
does
n't
care
to
listen
,
but
this
one
talks
rubbish
yet
*NL*
stirs
an
old
fellow
up
.
Well
,
go
!
Get
along
!
Perhaps
I
'll
come
and
sit
*NL*
with
you
at
supper
.
We
'll
have
another
dispute
.
Make
friends
with
my
*NL*
little
fool
,
Princess
Mary
,
''
he
shouted
after
Pierre
,
through
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
now
,
on
his
visit
to
Bald
Hills
,
did
Pierre
fully
realize
the
*NL*
strength
and
charm
of
his
friendship
with
Prince
Andrew
.
That
charm
was
*NL*
not
expressed
so
much
in
his
relations
with
him
as
with
all
his
family
*NL*
and
with
the
household
.
With
the
stern
old
prince
and
the
gentle
,
timid
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
though
he
had
scarcely
known
them
,
Pierre
at
once
felt
*NL*
like
an
old
friend
.
They
were
all
fond
of
him
already
.
Not
only
Princess
*NL*
Mary
,
who
had
been
won
by
his
gentleness
with
the
pilgrims
,
gave
him
her
*NL*
most
radiant
looks
,
but
even
the
one-year-old
``
Prince
Nicholas
''
-LRB-
as
his
*NL*
grandfather
called
him
-RRB-
smiled
at
Pierre
and
let
himself
be
taken
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
Michael
Ivanovich
and
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
pleasant
smiles
when
he
talked
to
the
old
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
came
in
to
supper
;
this
was
evidently
on
Pierre
's
*NL*
account
.
And
during
the
two
days
of
the
young
man
's
visit
he
was
*NL*
extremely
kind
to
him
and
told
him
to
visit
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
had
gone
and
the
members
of
the
household
met
together
,
they
*NL*
began
to
express
their
opinions
of
him
as
people
always
do
after
a
new
*NL*
acquaintance
has
left
,
but
as
seldom
happens
,
no
one
said
anything
but
*NL*
what
was
good
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
When
returning
from
his
leave
,
Rostov
felt
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
*NL*
close
was
the
bond
that
united
him
to
Denisov
and
the
whole
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
approaching
it
,
Rostov
felt
as
he
had
done
when
approaching
his
home
*NL*
in
Moscow
.
When
he
saw
the
first
hussar
with
the
unbuttoned
uniform
of
*NL*
his
regiment
,
when
he
recognized
red-haired
Dementyev
and
saw
the
picket
*NL*
ropes
of
the
roan
horses
,
when
Lavrushka
gleefully
shouted
to
his
*NL*
master
,
``
The
count
has
come
!
''
and
Denisov
,
who
had
been
asleep
on
his
*NL*
bed
,
ran
all
disheveled
out
of
the
mud
hut
to
embrace
him
,
and
the
*NL*
officers
collected
round
to
greet
the
new
arrival
,
Rostov
experienced
*NL*
the
same
feeling
as
when
his
mother
,
his
father
,
and
his
sister
had
*NL*
embraced
him
,
and
tears
of
joy
choked
him
so
that
he
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
The
regiment
was
also
a
home
,
and
as
unalterably
dear
and
precious
as
*NL*
his
parents
'
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
reported
himself
to
the
commander
of
the
regiment
and
had
*NL*
been
reassigned
to
his
former
squadron
,
had
been
on
duty
and
had
gone
*NL*
out
foraging
,
when
he
had
again
entered
into
all
the
little
interests
of
*NL*
the
regiment
and
felt
himself
deprived
of
liberty
and
bound
in
one
*NL*
narrow
,
unchanging
frame
,
he
experienced
the
same
sense
of
peace
,
of
*NL*
moral
support
,
and
the
same
sense
of
being
at
home
here
in
his
own
*NL*
place
,
as
he
had
felt
under
the
parental
roof
.
But
here
was
none
of
all
*NL*
that
turmoil
of
the
world
at
large
,
where
he
did
not
know
his
right
*NL*
place
and
took
mistaken
decisions
;
here
was
no
Sonya
with
whom
he
ought
,
*NL*
or
ought
not
,
to
have
an
explanation
;
here
was
no
possibility
of
going
*NL*
there
or
not
going
there
;
here
there
were
not
twenty-four
hours
in
the
*NL*
day
which
could
be
spent
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
;
there
was
not
that
*NL*
innumerable
crowd
of
people
of
whom
not
one
was
nearer
to
him
or
farther
*NL*
from
him
than
another
;
there
were
none
of
those
uncertain
and
undefined
*NL*
money
relations
with
his
father
,
and
nothing
to
recall
that
terrible
*NL*
loss
to
Dolokhov
.
Here
,
in
the
regiment
,
all
was
clear
and
simple
.
The
*NL*
whole
world
was
divided
into
two
unequal
parts
:
one
,
our
Pavlograd
*NL*
regiment
;
the
other
,
all
the
rest
.
And
the
rest
was
no
concern
of
his
.
*NL*
In
the
regiment
,
everything
was
definite
:
who
was
lieutenant
,
who
*NL*
captain
,
who
was
a
good
fellow
,
who
a
bad
one
,
and
most
of
all
,
who
was
*NL*
a
comrade
.
The
canteenkeeper
gave
one
credit
,
one
's
pay
came
every
four
*NL*
months
,
there
was
nothing
to
think
out
or
decide
,
you
had
only
to
do
*NL*
nothing
that
was
considered
bad
in
the
Pavlograd
regiment
and
,
when
*NL*
given
an
order
,
to
do
what
was
clearly
,
distinctly
,
and
definitely
*NL*
ordered
--
and
all
would
be
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
once
more
entered
into
the
definite
conditions
of
this
regimental
*NL*
life
,
Rostov
felt
the
joy
and
relief
a
tired
man
feels
on
lying
down
to
*NL*
rest
.
Life
in
the
regiment
,
during
this
campaign
,
was
all
the
pleasanter
*NL*
for
him
,
because
,
after
his
loss
to
Dolokhov
-LRB-
for
which
,
in
spite
of
all
*NL*
his
family
's
efforts
to
console
him
,
he
could
not
forgive
himself
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
to
atone
for
his
fault
by
serving
,
not
as
he
had
*NL*
done
before
,
but
really
well
,
and
by
being
a
perfectly
first-rate
*NL*
comrade
and
officer
--
in
a
word
,
a
splendid
man
altogether
,
a
thing
which
*NL*
seemed
so
difficult
out
in
the
world
,
but
so
possible
in
the
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
losses
,
he
had
determined
to
pay
back
his
debt
to
his
parents
*NL*
in
five
years
.
He
received
ten
thousand
rubles
a
year
,
but
now
resolved
*NL*
to
take
only
two
thousand
and
leave
the
rest
to
repay
the
debt
to
his
*NL*
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
army
,
after
repeated
retreats
and
advances
and
battles
at
Pultusk
*NL*
and
Preussisch-Eylau
,
was
concentrated
near
Bartenstein
.
It
was
awaiting
*NL*
the
Emperor
's
arrival
and
the
beginning
of
a
new
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pavlograd
regiment
,
belonging
to
that
part
of
the
army
which
had
*NL*
served
in
the
1805
campaign
,
had
been
recruiting
up
to
strength
in
*NL*
Russia
,
and
arrived
too
late
to
take
part
in
the
first
actions
of
the
*NL*
campaign
.
It
had
been
neither
at
Pultusk
nor
at
Preussisch-Eylau
and
,
*NL*
when
it
joined
the
army
in
the
field
in
the
second
half
of
the
campaign
,
*NL*
was
attached
to
Platov
's
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
Platov
's
division
was
acting
independently
of
the
main
army
.
Several
*NL*
times
parts
of
the
Pavlograd
regiment
had
exchanged
shots
with
the
*NL*
enemy
,
had
taken
prisoners
,
and
once
had
even
captured
Marshal
Oudinot
's
*NL*
carriages
.
In
April
the
Pavlograds
were
stationed
immovably
for
some
*NL*
weeks
near
a
totally
ruined
and
deserted
German
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thaw
had
set
in
,
it
was
muddy
and
cold
,
the
ice
on
the
river
broke
,
*NL*
and
the
roads
became
impassable
.
For
days
neither
provisions
for
the
men
*NL*
nor
fodder
for
the
horses
had
been
issued
.
As
no
transports
could
*NL*
arrive
,
the
men
dispersed
about
the
abandoned
and
deserted
villages
,
*NL*
searching
for
potatoes
,
but
found
few
even
of
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
had
been
eaten
up
and
the
inhabitants
had
all
fled
--
if
any
*NL*
remained
,
they
were
worse
than
beggars
and
nothing
more
could
be
taken
*NL*
from
them
;
even
the
soldiers
,
usually
pitiless
enough
,
instead
of
taking
*NL*
anything
from
them
,
often
gave
them
the
last
of
their
rations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pavlograd
regiment
had
had
only
two
men
wounded
in
action
,
but
had
*NL*
lost
nearly
half
its
men
from
hunger
and
sickness
.
In
the
hospitals
,
*NL*
death
was
so
certain
that
soldiers
suffering
from
fever
,
or
the
swelling
*NL*
that
came
from
bad
food
,
preferred
to
remain
on
duty
,
and
hardly
able
to
*NL*
drag
their
legs
went
to
the
front
rather
than
to
the
hospitals
.
When
*NL*
spring
came
on
,
the
soldiers
found
a
plant
just
showing
out
of
the
*NL*
ground
that
looked
like
asparagus
,
which
,
for
some
reason
,
they
called
*NL*
``
Mashka
's
sweet
root
.
''
It
was
very
bitter
,
but
they
wandered
about
the
*NL*
fields
seeking
it
and
dug
it
out
with
their
sabers
and
ate
it
,
though
*NL*
they
were
ordered
not
to
do
so
,
as
it
was
a
noxious
plant
.
That
spring
a
*NL*
new
disease
broke
out
among
the
soldiers
,
a
swelling
of
the
arms
,
legs
,
*NL*
and
face
,
which
the
doctors
attributed
to
eating
this
root
.
But
in
spite
*NL*
of
all
this
,
the
soldiers
of
Denisov
's
squadron
fed
chiefly
on
``
Mashka
's
*NL*
sweet
root
,
''
because
it
was
the
second
week
that
the
last
of
the
*NL*
biscuits
were
being
doled
out
at
the
rate
of
half
a
pound
a
man
and
the
*NL*
last
potatoes
received
had
sprouted
and
frozen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
also
had
been
fed
for
a
fortnight
on
straw
from
the
thatched
*NL*
roofs
and
had
become
terribly
thin
,
though
still
covered
with
tufts
of
*NL*
felty
winter
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
this
destitution
,
the
soldiers
and
officers
went
on
living
just
*NL*
as
usual
.
Despite
their
pale
swollen
faces
and
tattered
uniforms
,
the
*NL*
hussars
formed
line
for
roll
call
,
kept
things
in
order
,
groomed
their
*NL*
horses
,
polished
their
arms
,
brought
in
straw
from
the
thatched
roofs
in
*NL*
place
of
fodder
,
and
sat
down
to
dine
round
the
caldrons
from
which
they
*NL*
rose
up
hungry
,
joking
about
their
nasty
food
and
their
hunger
.
As
*NL*
usual
,
in
their
spare
time
,
they
lit
bonfires
,
steamed
themselves
before
*NL*
them
naked
;
smoked
,
picked
out
and
baked
sprouting
rotten
potatoes
,
told
*NL*
and
listened
to
stories
of
Potemkin
's
and
Suvorov
's
campaigns
,
or
to
*NL*
legends
of
Alesha
the
Sly
,
or
the
priest
's
laborer
Mikolka
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
,
as
usual
,
lived
in
twos
and
threes
in
the
roofless
,
half
-
*NL*
ruined
houses
.
The
seniors
tried
to
collect
straw
and
potatoes
and
,
in
*NL*
general
,
food
for
the
men
.
The
younger
ones
occupied
themselves
as
*NL*
before
,
some
playing
cards
-LRB-
there
was
plenty
of
money
,
though
there
was
*NL*
no
food
-RRB-
,
some
with
more
innocent
games
,
such
as
quoits
and
skittles
.
*NL*
The
general
trend
of
the
campaign
was
rarely
spoken
of
,
partly
because
*NL*
nothing
certain
was
known
about
it
,
partly
because
there
was
a
vague
*NL*
feeling
that
in
the
main
it
was
going
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
lived
,
as
before
,
with
Denisov
,
and
since
their
furlough
they
had
*NL*
become
more
friendly
than
ever
.
Denisov
never
spoke
of
Rostov
's
family
,
*NL*
but
by
the
tender
friendship
his
commander
showed
him
,
Rostov
felt
that
*NL*
the
elder
hussar
's
luckless
love
for
Natasha
played
a
part
in
*NL*
strengthening
their
friendship
.
Denisov
evidently
tried
to
expose
Rostov
*NL*
to
danger
as
seldom
as
possible
,
and
after
an
action
greeted
his
safe
*NL*
return
with
evident
joy
.
On
one
of
his
foraging
expeditions
,
in
a
*NL*
deserted
and
ruined
village
to
which
he
had
come
in
search
of
*NL*
provisions
,
Rostov
found
a
family
consisting
of
an
old
Pole
and
his
*NL*
daughter
with
an
infant
in
arms
.
They
were
half
clad
,
hungry
,
too
weak
*NL*
to
get
away
on
foot
and
had
no
means
of
obtaining
a
conveyance
.
Rostov
*NL*
brought
them
to
his
quarters
,
placed
them
in
his
own
lodging
,
and
kept
*NL*
them
for
some
weeks
while
the
old
man
was
recovering
.
One
of
his
*NL*
comrades
,
talking
of
women
,
began
chaffing
Rostov
,
saying
that
he
was
*NL*
more
wily
than
any
of
them
and
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
he
*NL*
introduced
to
them
the
pretty
Polish
girl
he
had
saved
.
Rostov
took
the
*NL*
joke
as
an
insult
,
flared
up
,
and
said
such
unpleasant
things
to
the
*NL*
officer
that
it
was
all
Denisov
could
do
to
prevent
a
duel
.
When
the
*NL*
officer
had
gone
away
,
Denisov
,
who
did
not
himself
know
what
Rostov
's
*NL*
relations
with
the
Polish
girl
might
be
,
began
to
upbraid
him
for
his
*NL*
quickness
of
temper
,
and
Rostov
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
you
like
...
She
is
like
a
sister
to
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
you
*NL*
how
it
offended
me
...
because
...
well
,
for
that
reason
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
and
began
rapidly
pacing
the
room
*NL*
without
looking
at
Rostov
,
as
was
his
way
at
moments
of
deep
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
mad
bweed
you
Wostovs
are
!
''
he
muttered
,
and
Rostov
noticed
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
In
April
the
troops
were
enlivened
by
news
of
the
Emperor
's
arrival
,
but
*NL*
Rostov
had
no
chance
of
being
present
at
the
review
he
held
at
*NL*
Bartenstein
,
as
the
Pavlograds
were
at
the
outposts
far
beyond
that
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
bivouacking
.
Denisov
and
Rostov
were
living
in
an
earth
hut
,
*NL*
dug
out
for
them
by
the
soldiers
and
roofed
with
branches
and
turf
.
The
*NL*
hut
was
made
in
the
following
manner
,
which
had
then
come
into
vogue
.
A
*NL*
trench
was
dug
three
and
a
half
feet
wide
,
four
feet
eight
inches
deep
,
*NL*
and
eight
feet
long
.
At
one
end
of
the
trench
,
steps
were
cut
out
and
*NL*
these
formed
the
entrance
and
vestibule
.
The
trench
itself
was
the
room
,
*NL*
in
which
the
lucky
ones
,
such
as
the
squadron
commander
,
had
a
board
,
*NL*
lying
on
piles
at
the
end
opposite
the
entrance
,
to
serve
as
a
table
.
On
*NL*
each
side
of
the
trench
,
the
earth
was
cut
out
to
a
breadth
of
about
two
*NL*
and
a
half
feet
,
and
this
did
duty
for
bedsteads
and
couches
.
The
roof
*NL*
was
so
constructed
that
one
could
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
the
trench
*NL*
and
could
even
sit
up
on
the
beds
if
one
drew
close
to
the
table
.
*NL*
Denisov
,
who
was
living
luxuriously
because
the
soldiers
of
his
squadron
*NL*
liked
him
,
had
also
a
board
in
the
roof
at
the
farther
end
,
with
a
piece
*NL*
of
-LRB-
broken
but
mended
-RRB-
glass
in
it
for
a
window
.
When
it
was
very
cold
,
*NL*
embers
from
the
soldiers
'
campfire
were
placed
on
a
bent
sheet
of
iron
*NL*
on
the
steps
in
the
``
reception
room
''
--
as
Denisov
called
that
part
of
the
*NL*
hut
--
and
it
was
then
so
warm
that
the
officers
,
of
whom
there
were
*NL*
always
some
with
Denisov
and
Rostov
,
sat
in
their
shirt
sleeves
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
April
,
Rostov
was
on
orderly
duty
.
One
morning
,
between
seven
and
*NL*
eight
,
returning
after
a
sleepless
night
,
he
sent
for
embers
,
changed
*NL*
his
rain-soaked
underclothes
,
said
his
prayers
,
drank
tea
,
got
warm
,
*NL*
then
tidied
up
the
things
on
the
table
and
in
his
own
corner
,
and
,
his
*NL*
face
glowing
from
exposure
to
the
wind
and
with
nothing
on
but
his
*NL*
shirt
,
lay
down
on
his
back
,
putting
his
arms
under
his
head
.
He
was
*NL*
pleasantly
considering
the
probability
of
being
promoted
in
a
few
days
*NL*
for
his
last
reconnoitering
expedition
,
and
was
awaiting
Denisov
,
who
*NL*
had
gone
out
somewhere
and
with
whom
he
wanted
a
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
heard
Denisov
shouting
in
a
vibrating
voice
behind
the
hut
,
*NL*
evidently
much
excited
.
Rostov
moved
to
the
window
to
see
whom
he
was
*NL*
speaking
to
,
and
saw
the
quartermaster
,
Topcheenko
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ordered
you
not
to
let
them
eat
that
Mashka
woot
stuff
!
''
Denisov
was
*NL*
shouting
.
``
And
I
saw
with
my
own
eyes
how
Lazarchuk
bwought
some
fwom
*NL*
the
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
the
order
again
and
again
,
your
honor
,
but
they
do
n't
*NL*
obey
,
''
answered
the
quartermaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
lay
down
again
on
his
bed
and
thought
complacently
:
``
Let
him
fuss
*NL*
and
bustle
now
,
my
job
's
done
and
I
'm
lying
down
--
capitally
!
''
He
could
*NL*
hear
that
Lavrushka
--
that
sly
,
bold
orderly
of
Denisov
's
--
was
talking
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
quartermaster
.
Lavrushka
was
saying
something
about
*NL*
loaded
wagons
,
biscuits
,
and
oxen
he
had
seen
when
he
had
gone
out
for
*NL*
provisions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Denisov
's
voice
was
heard
shouting
farther
and
farther
away
.
*NL*
``
Saddle
!
Second
platoon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
off
to
now
?
''
thought
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
,
Denisov
came
into
the
hut
,
climbed
with
muddy
boots
*NL*
on
the
bed
,
lit
his
pipe
,
furiously
scattered
his
things
about
,
took
his
*NL*
leaded
whip
,
buckled
on
his
saber
,
and
went
out
again
.
In
answer
to
*NL*
Rostov
's
inquiry
where
he
was
going
,
he
answered
vaguely
and
crossly
*NL*
that
he
had
some
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
God
and
our
gweat
monarch
judge
me
afterwards
!
''
said
Denisov
going
*NL*
out
,
and
Rostov
heard
the
hoofs
of
several
horses
splashing
through
the
*NL*
mud
.
He
did
not
even
trouble
to
find
out
where
Denisov
had
gone
.
Having
*NL*
got
warm
in
his
corner
,
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
leave
the
hut
till
*NL*
toward
evening
.
Denisov
had
not
yet
returned
.
The
weather
had
cleared
*NL*
up
,
and
near
the
next
hut
two
officers
and
a
cadet
were
playing
svayka
,
*NL*
laughing
as
they
threw
their
missiles
which
buried
themselves
in
the
*NL*
soft
mud
.
Rostov
joined
them
.
In
the
middle
of
the
game
,
the
officers
*NL*
saw
some
wagons
approaching
with
fifteen
hussars
on
their
skinny
horses
*NL*
behind
them
.
The
wagons
escorted
by
the
hussars
drew
up
to
the
picket
*NL*
ropes
and
a
crowd
of
hussars
surrounded
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
Denisov
has
been
worrying
,
''
said
Rostov
,
``
and
here
are
the
*NL*
provisions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
are
!
''
said
the
officers
.
``
Wo
n't
the
soldiers
be
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
behind
the
hussars
came
Denisov
,
accompanied
by
two
infantry
*NL*
officers
with
whom
he
was
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
went
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warn
you
,
Captain
,
''
one
of
the
officers
,
a
short
thin
man
,
evidently
*NL*
very
angry
,
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
I
told
you
I
wo
n't
give
them
up
?
''
replied
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
answer
for
it
,
Captain
.
It
is
mutiny
--
seizing
the
transport
of
*NL*
one
's
own
army
.
Our
men
have
had
nothing
to
eat
for
two
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mine
have
had
nothing
for
two
weeks
,
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
robbery
!
You
'll
answer
for
it
,
sir
!
''
said
the
infantry
officer
,
*NL*
raising
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
what
are
you
pestewing
me
for
?
''
cried
Denisov
,
suddenly
losing
his
*NL*
temper
.
``
I
shall
answer
for
it
and
not
you
,
and
you
'd
better
not
buzz
*NL*
about
here
till
you
get
hurt
.
Be
off
!
Go
!
''
he
shouted
at
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
!
''
shouted
the
little
officer
,
undaunted
and
not
riding
*NL*
away
.
``
If
you
are
determined
to
rob
,
I
'll

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
quick
ma

ch
,
while
you
're
safe
and
sound

''
and
Denisov
*NL*
turned
his
horse
on
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
very
well
!
''
muttered
the
officer
,
threateningly
,
and
turning
*NL*
his
horse
he
trotted
away
,
jolting
in
his
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dog
astwide
a
fence
!
A
weal
dog

''
shouted
Denisov
*NL*
after
him
-LRB-
the
most
insulting
expression
a
cavalryman
can
address
to
a
*NL*
mounted
infantryman
-RRB-
and
riding
up
to
Rostov
,
he
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
taken
twansports
from
the

''
he
said
.
``
After

*NL*
The
wagons
that
had
reached
the
hussars
had
been
consigned
to
an
*NL*
infantry
regiment
,
but
learning
from
Lavrushka
that
the
transport
was
*NL*
unescorted
,
Denisov
with
his
hussars
had
seized
it
by
force
.
The
*NL*
soldiers
had
biscuits
dealt
out
to
them
freely
,
and
they
even
shared
*NL*
them
with
the
other
squadrons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
regimental
commander
sent
for
Denisov
,
and
holding
his
*NL*
fingers
spread
out
before
his
eyes
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
how
I
look
at
this
affair
:
I
know
nothing
about
it
and
wo
n't
*NL*
begin
proceedings
,
but
I
advise
you
to
ride
over
to
the
staff
and
settle
*NL*
the
business
there
in
the
commissariat
department
and
if
possible
sign
a
*NL*
receipt
for
such
and
such
stores
received
.
If
not
,
as
the
demand
was
*NL*
booked
against
an
infantry
regiment
,
there
will
be
a
row
and
the
affair
*NL*
may
end
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
regimental
commander
's
,
Denisov
rode
straight
to
the
staff
with
*NL*
a
sincere
desire
to
act
on
this
advice
.
In
the
evening
he
came
back
to
*NL*
his
dugout
in
a
state
such
as
Rostov
had
never
yet
seen
him
in
.
Denisov
*NL*
could
not
speak
and
gasped
for
breath
.
When
Rostov
asked
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
,
he
only
uttered
some
incoherent
oaths
and
threats
in
a
hoarse
,
*NL*
feeble
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alarmed
at
Denisov
's
condition
,
Rostov
suggested
that
he
should
undress
,
*NL*
drink
some
water
,
and
send
for
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twy
me
for
wobbewy
...
oh
!
Some
more
water
...
Let
them
twy
me
,
but
I
'll
*NL*
always
thwash
scoundwels
...
and
I
'll
tell
the
Empewo
'
...
Ice
...
''
he
*NL*
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regimental
doctor
,
when
he
came
,
said
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
*NL*
bleed
Denisov
.
A
deep
saucer
of
black
blood
was
taken
from
his
hairy
arm
*NL*
and
only
then
was
he
able
to
relate
what
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
get
there
,
''
began
Denisov
.
''
`
Now
then
,
where
's
your
chief
's
*NL*
quarters
?
'
They
were
pointed
out
.
`
Please
to
wait
.
'
`
I
've
widden
twenty
*NL*
miles
and
have
duties
to
attend
to
and
no
time
to
wait
.
Announce
me
.
'
*NL*
Vewy
well
,
so
out
comes
their
head
chief
--
also
took
it
into
his
head
to
*NL*
lecture
me
:
`
It
's
wobbewy
!
'
--
`
Wobbewy
,
'
I
say
,
`
is
not
done
by
man
who
*NL*
seizes
pwovisions
to
feed
his
soldiers
,
but
by
him
who
takes
them
to
*NL*
fill
his
own
pockets
!
'
`
Will
you
please
be
silent
?
'
`
Vewy
good
!
'
Then
he
*NL*
says
:
`
Go
and
give
a
weceipt
to
the
commissioner
,
but
your
affair
will
*NL*
be
passed
on
to
headquarters
.
'
I
go
to
the
commissioner
.
I
enter
,
and
at
*NL*
the
table
...
who
do
you
think
?
No
,
but
wait
a
bit
!
...
Who
is
it
that
's
*NL*
starving
us
?
''
shouted
Denisov
,
hitting
the
table
with
the
fist
of
his
*NL*
newly
bled
arm
so
violently
that
the
table
nearly
broke
down
and
the
*NL*
tumblers
on
it
jumped
about
.
``
Telyanin
!
`
What
?
So
it
's
you
who
's
*NL*
starving
us
to
death
!
Is
it
?
Take
this
and
this
!
'
and
I
hit
him
so
pat
,
*NL*
stwaight
on
his
snout
...
`
Ah
,
what
a.
.
.
what
a.
.
.
!
'
and
I
sta
`
ted
*NL*
fwashing
him
...
Well
,
I
've
had
a
bit
of
fun
I
can
tell
you
!
''
cried
*NL*
Denisov
,
gleeful
and
yet
angry
,
his
white
teeth
showing
under
his
black
*NL*
mustache
.
``
I
'd
have
killed
him
if
they
had
n't
taken
him
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
shouting
for
?
Calm
yourself
,
''
said
Rostov
.
``
You
've
set
*NL*
your
arm
bleeding
afresh
.
Wait
,
we
must
tie
it
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
was
bandaged
up
again
and
put
to
bed
.
Next
day
he
woke
calm
and
*NL*
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
noon
the
adjutant
of
the
regiment
came
into
Rostov
's
and
*NL*
Denisov
's
dugout
with
a
grave
and
serious
face
and
regretfully
showed
*NL*
them
a
paper
addressed
to
Major
Denisov
from
the
regimental
commander
in
*NL*
which
inquiries
were
made
about
yesterday
's
occurrence
.
The
adjutant
*NL*
told
them
that
the
affair
was
likely
to
take
a
very
bad
turn
:
that
a
*NL*
court-martial
had
been
appointed
,
and
that
in
view
of
the
severity
with
*NL*
which
marauding
and
insubordination
were
now
regarded
,
degradation
to
*NL*
the
ranks
would
be
the
best
that
could
be
hoped
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
,
as
represented
by
the
offended
parties
,
was
that
,
after
*NL*
seizing
the
transports
,
Major
Denisov
,
being
drunk
,
went
to
the
chief
*NL*
quartermaster
and
without
any
provocation
called
him
a
thief
,
threatened
*NL*
to
strike
him
,
and
on
being
led
out
had
rushed
into
the
office
and
given
*NL*
two
officials
a
thrashing
,
and
dislocated
the
arm
of
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
answer
to
Rostov
's
renewed
questions
,
Denisov
said
,
laughing
,
that
he
*NL*
thought
he
remembered
that
some
other
fellow
had
got
mixed
up
in
it
,
but
*NL*
that
it
was
all
nonsense
and
rubbish
,
and
he
did
not
in
the
least
fear
*NL*
any
kind
of
trial
,
and
that
if
those
scoundrels
dared
attack
him
he
*NL*
would
give
them
an
answer
that
they
would
not
easily
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
spoke
contemptuously
of
the
whole
matter
,
but
Rostov
knew
him
*NL*
too
well
not
to
detect
that
-LRB-
while
hiding
it
from
others
-RRB-
at
heart
he
*NL*
feared
a
court-martial
and
was
worried
over
the
affair
,
which
was
*NL*
evidently
taking
a
bad
turn
.
Every
day
,
letters
of
inquiry
and
notices
*NL*
from
the
court
arrived
,
and
on
the
first
of
May
,
Denisov
was
ordered
to
*NL*
hand
the
squadron
over
to
the
next
in
seniority
and
appear
before
the
*NL*
staff
of
his
division
to
explain
his
violence
at
the
commissariat
*NL*
office
.
On
the
previous
day
Platov
reconnoitered
with
two
Cossack
*NL*
regiments
and
two
squadrons
of
hussars
.
Denisov
,
as
was
his
wont
,
rode
*NL*
out
in
front
of
the
outposts
,
parading
his
courage
.
A
bullet
fired
by
a
*NL*
French
sharpshooter
hit
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
his
leg
.
Perhaps
at
*NL*
another
time
Denisov
would
not
have
left
the
regiment
for
so
slight
a
*NL*
wound
,
but
now
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
excuse
himself
from
appearing
*NL*
at
the
staff
and
went
into
hospital
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
In
June
the
battle
of
Friedland
was
fought
,
in
which
the
Pavlograds
did
*NL*
not
take
part
,
and
after
that
an
armistice
was
proclaimed
.
Rostov
,
who
*NL*
felt
his
friend
's
absence
very
much
,
having
no
news
of
him
since
he
left
*NL*
and
feeling
very
anxious
about
his
wound
and
the
progress
of
his
*NL*
affairs
,
took
advantage
of
the
armistice
to
get
leave
to
visit
Denisov
*NL*
in
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospital
was
in
a
small
Prussian
town
that
had
been
twice
devastated
*NL*
by
Russian
and
French
troops
.
Because
it
was
summer
,
when
it
is
so
*NL*
beautiful
out
in
the
fields
,
the
little
town
presented
a
particularly
*NL*
dismal
appearance
with
its
broken
roofs
and
fences
,
its
foul
streets
,
*NL*
tattered
inhabitants
,
and
the
sick
and
drunken
soldiers
wandering
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospital
was
in
a
brick
building
with
some
of
the
window
frames
and
*NL*
panes
broken
and
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
the
remains
of
a
wooden
fence
*NL*
that
had
been
pulled
to
pieces
.
Several
bandaged
soldiers
,
with
pale
*NL*
swollen
faces
,
were
sitting
or
walking
about
in
the
sunshine
in
the
*NL*
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
Rostov
entered
the
door
he
was
enveloped
by
a
smell
of
*NL*
putrefaction
and
hospital
air
.
On
the
stairs
he
met
a
Russian
army
*NL*
doctor
smoking
a
cigar
.
The
doctor
was
followed
by
a
Russian
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tear
myself
to
pieces
,
''
the
doctor
was
saying
.
``
Come
to
Makar
*NL*
Alexeevich
in
the
evening
.
I
shall
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
assistant
asked
some
further
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
the
best
you
can
!
Is
n't
it
all
the
same
?
''
The
doctor
noticed
*NL*
Rostov
coming
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
sir
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
The
bullets
*NL*
having
spared
you
,
do
you
want
to
try
typhus
?
This
is
a
pesthouse
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
asked
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Typhus
,
sir
.
It
's
death
to
go
in
.
Only
we
two
,
Makeev
and
I
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
pointed
to
the
assistant
-RRB-
,
``
keep
on
here
.
Some
five
of
us
doctors
have
*NL*
died
in
this
place
...
When
a
new
one
comes
he
is
done
for
in
a
week
,
''
*NL*
said
the
doctor
with
evident
satisfaction
.
``
Prussian
doctors
have
been
*NL*
invited
here
,
but
our
allies
do
n't
like
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
explained
that
he
wanted
to
see
Major
Denisov
of
the
hussars
,
who
*NL*
was
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
sir
.
Only
think
!
I
am
alone
in
charge
*NL*
of
three
hospitals
with
more
than
four
hundred
patients
!
It
's
well
that
*NL*
the
charitable
Prussian
ladies
send
us
two
pounds
of
coffee
and
some
*NL*
lint
each
month
or
we
should
be
lost
!
''
he
laughed
.
``
Four
hundred
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
they
're
always
sending
me
fresh
ones
.
There
are
four
hundred
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
,
turning
to
the
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assistant
looked
fagged
out
.
He
was
evidently
vexed
and
impatient
*NL*
for
the
talkative
doctor
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Major
Denisov
,
''
Rostov
said
again
.
``
He
was
wounded
at
Molliten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
I
fancy
.
Eh
,
Makeev
?
''
queried
the
doctor
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assistant
,
however
,
did
not
confirm
the
doctor
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
tall
and
with
reddish
hair
?
''
asked
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
described
Denisov
's
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
one
like
that
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
as
if
pleased
.
``
That
one
is
*NL*
dead
,
I
fancy
.
However
,
I
'll
look
up
our
list
.
We
had
a
list
.
Have
you
*NL*
got
it
,
Makeev
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Makar
Alexeevich
has
the
list
,
''
answered
the
assistant
.
``
But
if
you
'll
*NL*
step
into
the
officers
'
wards
you
'll
see
for
yourself
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
turning
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
'd
better
not
go
,
sir
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
or
you
may
have
to
*NL*
stay
here
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rostov
bowed
himself
away
from
the
doctor
and
asked
the
assistant
to
*NL*
show
him
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
do
n't
blame
me
!
''
the
doctor
shouted
up
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
and
the
assistant
went
into
the
dark
corridor
.
The
smell
was
so
*NL*
strong
there
that
Rostov
held
his
nose
and
had
to
pause
and
collect
his
*NL*
strength
before
he
could
go
on
.
A
door
opened
to
the
right
,
and
an
*NL*
emaciated
sallow
man
on
crutches
,
barefoot
and
in
underclothing
,
limped
*NL*
out
and
,
leaning
against
the
doorpost
,
looked
with
glittering
envious
*NL*
eyes
at
those
who
were
passing
.
Glancing
in
at
the
door
,
Rostov
saw
that
*NL*
the
sick
and
wounded
were
lying
on
the
floor
on
straw
and
overcoats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
in
and
look
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
to
see
?
''
said
the
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
just
because
the
assistant
evidently
did
not
want
him
to
go
in
,
*NL*
Rostov
entered
the
soldiers
'
ward
.
The
foul
air
,
to
which
he
had
already
*NL*
begun
to
get
used
in
the
corridor
,
was
still
stronger
here
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
different
,
more
pungent
,
and
one
felt
that
this
was
where
it
*NL*
originated
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
long
room
,
brightly
lit
up
by
the
sun
through
the
large
windows
,
*NL*
the
sick
and
wounded
lay
in
two
rows
with
their
heads
to
the
walls
,
and
*NL*
leaving
a
passage
in
the
middle
.
Most
of
them
were
unconscious
and
paid
*NL*
no
attention
to
the
newcomers
.
Those
who
were
conscious
raised
*NL*
themselves
or
lifted
their
thin
yellow
faces
,
and
all
looked
intently
at
*NL*
Rostov
with
the
same
expression
of
hope
,
of
relief
,
reproach
,
and
envy
*NL*
of
another
's
health
.
Rostov
went
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
looking
*NL*
through
the
open
doors
into
the
two
adjoining
rooms
saw
the
same
thing
*NL*
there
.
He
stood
still
,
looking
silently
around
.
He
had
not
at
all
*NL*
expected
such
a
sight
.
Just
before
him
,
almost
across
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
passage
on
the
bare
floor
,
lay
a
sick
man
,
probably
a
Cossack
to
judge
*NL*
by
the
cut
of
his
hair
.
The
man
lay
on
his
back
,
his
huge
arms
and
legs
*NL*
outstretched
.
His
face
was
purple
,
his
eyes
were
rolled
back
so
that
*NL*
only
the
whites
were
seen
,
and
on
his
bare
legs
and
arms
which
were
*NL*
still
red
,
the
veins
stood
out
like
cords
.
He
was
knocking
the
back
of
*NL*
his
head
against
the
floor
,
hoarsely
uttering
some
word
which
he
kept
*NL*
repeating
.
Rostov
listened
and
made
out
the
word
.
It
was
``
drink
,
drink
,
*NL*
a
drink
!
''
Rostov
glanced
round
,
looking
for
someone
who
would
put
this
*NL*
man
back
in
his
place
and
bring
him
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
looks
after
the
sick
here
?
''
he
asked
the
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
commissariat
soldier
,
a
hospital
orderly
,
came
in
from
the
*NL*
next
room
,
marching
stiffly
,
and
drew
up
in
front
of
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
your
honor
!
''
he
shouted
,
rolling
his
eyes
at
Rostov
and
*NL*
evidently
mistaking
him
for
one
of
the
hospital
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
him
to
his
place
and
give
him
some
water
,
''
said
Rostov
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
honor
,
''
the
soldier
replied
complacently
,
and
rolling
his
*NL*
eyes
more
than
ever
he
drew
himself
up
still
straighter
,
but
did
not
*NL*
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
impossible
to
do
anything
here
,
''
thought
Rostov
,
lowering
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
he
was
going
out
,
but
became
aware
of
an
intense
look
fixed
on
*NL*
him
on
his
right
,
and
he
turned
.
Close
to
the
corner
,
on
an
overcoat
,
*NL*
sat
an
old
,
unshaven
,
gray-bearded
soldier
as
thin
as
a
skeleton
,
with
a
*NL*
stern
sallow
face
and
eyes
intently
fixed
on
Rostov
.
The
man
's
neighbor
*NL*
on
one
side
whispered
something
to
him
,
pointing
at
Rostov
,
who
noticed
*NL*
that
the
old
man
wanted
to
speak
to
him
.
He
drew
nearer
and
saw
that
the
*NL*
old
man
had
only
one
leg
bent
under
him
,
the
other
had
been
amputated
*NL*
above
the
knee
.
His
neighbor
on
the
other
side
,
who
lay
motionless
some
*NL*
distance
from
him
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
was
a
young
soldier
with
a
*NL*
snub
nose
.
His
pale
waxen
face
was
still
freckled
and
his
eyes
were
*NL*
rolled
back
.
Rostov
looked
at
the
young
soldier
and
a
cold
chill
ran
*NL*
down
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
one
seems
...
''
he
began
,
turning
to
the
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
we
've
been
begging
,
your
honor
,
''
said
the
old
soldier
,
his
jaw
*NL*
quivering
.
``
He
's
been
dead
since
morning
.
After
all
we
're
men
,
not
*NL*
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
send
someone
at
once
.
He
shall
be
taken
away
--
taken
away
at
once
,
''
*NL*
said
the
assistant
hurriedly
.
``
Let
us
go
,
your
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
let
us
go
,
''
said
Rostov
hastily
,
and
lowering
his
eyes
and
*NL*
shrinking
,
he
tried
to
pass
unnoticed
between
the
rows
of
reproachful
*NL*
envious
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
him
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Going
along
the
corridor
,
the
assistant
led
Rostov
to
the
officers
'
*NL*
wards
,
consisting
of
three
rooms
,
the
doors
of
which
stood
open
.
There
*NL*
were
beds
in
these
rooms
and
the
sick
and
wounded
officers
were
lying
or
*NL*
sitting
on
them
.
Some
were
walking
about
the
rooms
in
hospital
dressing
*NL*
gowns
.
The
first
person
Rostov
met
in
the
officers
'
ward
was
a
thin
*NL*
little
man
with
one
arm
,
who
was
walking
about
the
first
room
in
a
*NL*
nightcap
and
hospital
dressing
gown
,
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
Rostov
looked
at
him
,
trying
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
where
we
've
met
again
!
''
said
the
little
man
.
``
Tushin
,
Tushin
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
remember
,
who
gave
you
a
lift
at
Schon
Grabern
?
And
I
've
had
a
bit
*NL*
cut
off
,
you
see
...
''
he
went
on
with
a
smile
,
pointing
to
the
empty
*NL*
sleeve
of
his
dressing
gown
.
``
Looking
for
Vasili
Dmitrich
Denisov
?
My
*NL*
neighbor
,
''
he
added
,
when
he
heard
who
Rostov
wanted
.
``
Here
,
here
,
''
and
*NL*
Tushin
led
him
into
the
next
room
,
from
whence
came
sounds
of
several
*NL*
laughing
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
they
laugh
,
or
even
live
at
all
here
?
''
thought
Rostov
,
still
*NL*
aware
of
that
smell
of
decomposing
flesh
that
had
been
so
strong
in
the
*NL*
soldiers
'
ward
,
and
still
seeming
to
see
fixed
on
him
those
envious
*NL*
looks
which
had
followed
him
out
from
both
sides
,
and
the
face
of
that
*NL*
young
soldier
with
eyes
rolled
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
lay
asleep
on
his
bed
with
his
head
under
the
blanket
,
though
it
*NL*
was
nearly
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Wostov
?
How
are
you
,
how
are
you
?
''
he
called
out
,
still
in
the
same
*NL*
voice
as
in
the
regiment
,
but
Rostov
noticed
sadly
that
under
this
*NL*
habitual
ease
and
animation
some
new
,
sinister
,
hidden
feeling
showed
*NL*
itself
in
the
expression
of
Denisov
's
face
and
the
intonations
of
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wound
,
though
a
slight
one
,
had
not
yet
healed
even
now
,
six
weeks
*NL*
after
he
had
been
hit
.
His
face
had
the
same
swollen
pallor
as
the
faces
*NL*
of
the
other
hospital
patients
,
but
it
was
not
this
that
struck
Rostov
.
*NL*
What
struck
him
was
that
Denisov
did
not
seem
glad
to
see
him
,
and
*NL*
smiled
at
him
unnaturally
.
He
did
not
ask
about
the
regiment
,
nor
about
*NL*
the
general
state
of
affairs
,
and
when
Rostov
spoke
of
these
matters
did
*NL*
not
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
even
noticed
that
Denisov
did
not
like
to
be
reminded
of
the
*NL*
regiment
,
or
in
general
of
that
other
free
life
which
was
going
on
*NL*
outside
the
hospital
.
He
seemed
to
try
to
forget
that
old
life
and
was
*NL*
only
interested
in
the
affair
with
the
commissariat
officers
.
On
*NL*
Rostov
's
inquiry
as
to
how
the
matter
stood
,
he
at
once
produced
from
*NL*
under
his
pillow
a
paper
he
had
received
from
the
commission
and
the
*NL*
rough
draft
of
his
answer
to
it
.
He
became
animated
when
he
began
*NL*
reading
his
paper
and
specially
drew
Rostov
's
attention
to
the
stinging
*NL*
rejoinders
he
made
to
his
enemies
.
His
hospital
companions
,
who
had
*NL*
gathered
round
Rostov
--
a
fresh
arrival
from
the
world
outside
--
gradually
*NL*
began
to
disperse
as
soon
as
Denisov
began
reading
his
answer
.
Rostov
*NL*
noticed
by
their
faces
that
all
those
gentlemen
had
already
heard
that
*NL*
story
more
than
once
and
were
tired
of
it
.
Only
the
man
who
had
the
next
*NL*
bed
,
a
stout
Uhlan
,
continued
to
sit
on
his
bed
,
gloomily
frowning
and
*NL*
smoking
a
pipe
,
and
little
one-armed
Tushin
still
listened
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
disapprovingly
.
In
the
middle
of
the
reading
,
the
Uhlan
interrupted
*NL*
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
I
say
is
,
''
he
said
,
turning
to
Rostov
,
``
it
would
be
best
*NL*
simply
to
petition
the
Emperor
for
pardon
.
They
say
great
rewards
will
*NL*
now
be
distributed
,
and
surely
a
pardon
would
be
granted
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
petition
the
Empewo
'
!
''
exclaimed
Denisov
,
in
a
voice
to
which
he
*NL*
tried
hard
to
give
the
old
energy
and
fire
,
but
which
sounded
like
an
*NL*
expression
of
irritable
impotence
.
``
What
for
?
If
I
were
a
wobber
I
would
*NL*
ask
mercy
,
but
I
'm
being
court-martialed
for
bwinging
wobbers
to
book
.
*NL*
Let
them
twy
me
,
I
'm
not
afwaid
of
anyone
.
I
've
served
the
Tsar
and
my
*NL*
countwy
honowably
and
have
not
stolen
!
And
am
I
to
be
degwaded
?
...
*NL*
Listen
,
I
'm
w
`
iting
to
them
stwaight
.
This
is
what
I
say
:
`
If
I
had
*NL*
wobbed
the
Tweasuwy
...
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
certainly
well
written
,
''
said
Tushin
,
``
but
that
's
not
the
point
,
*NL*
Vasili
Dmitrich
,
''
and
he
also
turned
to
Rostov
.
``
One
has
to
submit
,
and
*NL*
Vasili
Dmitrich
does
n't
want
to
.
You
know
the
auditor
told
you
it
was
a
*NL*
bad
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
it
be
bad
,
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
auditor
wrote
out
a
petition
for
you
,
''
continued
Tushin
,
``
and
you
*NL*
ought
to
sign
it
and
ask
this
gentleman
to
take
it
.
No
doubt
he
''
*NL*
-LRB-
indicating
Rostov
-RRB-
``
has
connections
on
the
staff
.
You
wo
n't
find
a
*NL*
better
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
I
said
I
'm
not
going
to
gwovel
?
''
Denisov
interrupted
him
,
went
*NL*
on
reading
his
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
not
the
courage
to
persuade
Denisov
,
though
he
instinctively
*NL*
felt
that
the
way
advised
by
Tushin
and
the
other
officers
was
the
*NL*
safest
,
and
though
he
would
have
been
glad
to
be
of
service
to
Denisov
.
*NL*
He
knew
his
stubborn
will
and
straightforward
hasty
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
reading
of
Denisov
's
virulent
reply
,
which
took
more
than
an
*NL*
hour
,
was
over
,
Rostov
said
nothing
,
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
*NL*
a
most
dejected
state
of
mind
amid
Denisov
's
hospital
comrades
,
who
had
*NL*
gathered
round
him
,
telling
them
what
he
knew
and
listening
to
their
*NL*
stories
.
Denisov
was
moodily
silent
all
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
evening
,
when
Rostov
was
about
to
leave
,
he
asked
Denisov
*NL*
whether
he
had
no
commission
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
wait
a
bit
,
''
said
Denisov
,
glancing
round
at
the
officers
,
and
*NL*
taking
his
papers
from
under
his
pillow
he
went
to
the
window
,
where
he
*NL*
had
an
inkpot
,
and
sat
down
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
it
's
no
use
knocking
one
's
head
against
a
wall
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
coming
from
the
window
and
giving
Rostov
a
large
envelope
.
In
it
was
the
*NL*
petition
to
the
Emperor
drawn
up
by
the
auditor
,
in
which
Denisov
,
*NL*
without
alluding
to
the
offenses
of
the
commissariat
officials
,
simply
*NL*
asked
for
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
it
in
.
It
seems
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
,
but
gave
a
painfully
unnatural
smile
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Having
returned
to
the
regiment
and
told
the
commander
the
state
of
*NL*
Denisov
's
affairs
,
Rostov
rode
to
Tilsit
with
the
letter
to
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
thirteenth
of
June
the
French
and
Russian
Emperors
arrived
in
*NL*
Tilsit
.
Boris
Drubetskoy
had
asked
the
important
personage
on
whom
he
*NL*
was
in
attendance
,
to
include
him
in
the
suite
appointed
for
the
stay
at
*NL*
Tilsit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
the
great
man
,
''
he
said
,
alluding
to
Napoleon
,
*NL*
whom
hitherto
he
,
like
everyone
else
,
had
always
called
Buonaparte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
speaking
of
Buonaparte
?
''
asked
the
general
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
looked
at
his
general
inquiringly
and
immediately
saw
that
he
was
*NL*
being
tested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
speaking
,
Prince
,
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon
,
''
he
replied
.
The
*NL*
general
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
far
,
''
he
said
,
and
took
him
to
Tilsit
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
was
among
the
few
present
at
the
Niemen
on
the
day
the
two
*NL*
Emperors
met
.
He
saw
the
raft
,
decorated
with
monograms
,
saw
Napoleon
*NL*
pass
before
the
French
Guards
on
the
farther
bank
of
the
river
,
saw
the
*NL*
pensive
face
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
as
he
sat
in
silence
in
a
tavern
*NL*
on
the
bank
of
the
Niemen
awaiting
Napoleon
's
arrival
,
saw
both
Emperors
*NL*
get
into
boats
,
and
saw
how
Napoleon
--
reaching
the
raft
first
--
stepped
*NL*
quickly
forward
to
meet
Alexander
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
,
and
how
*NL*
they
both
retired
into
the
pavilion
.
Since
he
had
begun
to
move
in
the
*NL*
highest
circles
Boris
had
made
it
his
habit
to
watch
attentively
all
*NL*
that
went
on
around
him
and
to
note
it
down
.
At
the
time
of
the
meeting
*NL*
at
Tilsit
he
asked
the
names
of
those
who
had
come
with
Napoleon
and
*NL*
about
the
uniforms
they
wore
,
and
listened
attentively
to
words
spoken
*NL*
by
important
personages
.
At
the
moment
the
Emperors
went
into
the
*NL*
pavilion
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
did
not
forget
to
look
at
it
again
*NL*
when
Alexander
came
out
.
The
interview
had
lasted
an
hour
and
fifty
-
*NL*
three
minutes
.
He
noted
this
down
that
same
evening
,
among
other
facts
*NL*
he
felt
to
be
of
historic
importance
.
As
the
Emperor
's
suite
was
a
very
*NL*
small
one
,
it
was
a
matter
of
great
importance
,
for
a
man
who
valued
his
*NL*
success
in
the
service
,
to
be
at
Tilsit
on
the
occasion
of
this
*NL*
interview
between
the
two
Emperors
,
and
having
succeeded
in
this
,
Boris
*NL*
felt
that
henceforth
his
position
was
fully
assured
.
He
had
not
only
*NL*
become
known
,
but
people
had
grown
accustomed
to
him
and
accepted
him
.
*NL*
Twice
he
had
executed
commissions
to
the
Emperor
himself
,
so
that
the
*NL*
latter
knew
his
face
,
and
all
those
at
court
,
far
from
cold-shouldering
*NL*
him
as
at
first
when
they
considered
him
a
newcomer
,
would
now
have
been
*NL*
surprised
had
he
been
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
lodged
with
another
adjutant
,
the
Polish
Count
Zhilinski
.
*NL*
Zhilinski
,
a
Pole
brought
up
in
Paris
,
was
rich
,
and
passionately
fond
*NL*
of
the
French
,
and
almost
every
day
of
the
stay
at
Tilsit
,
French
*NL*
officers
of
the
Guard
and
from
French
headquarters
were
dining
and
*NL*
lunching
with
him
and
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fourth
of
June
,
Count
Zhilinski
arranged
a
*NL*
supper
for
his
French
friends
.
The
guest
of
honor
was
an
aide-de-camp
of
*NL*
Napoleon
's
,
there
were
also
several
French
officers
of
the
Guard
,
and
a
*NL*
page
of
Napoleon
's
,
a
young
lad
of
an
old
aristocratic
French
family
.
*NL*
That
same
day
,
Rostov
,
profiting
by
the
darkness
to
avoid
being
*NL*
recognized
in
civilian
dress
,
came
to
Tilsit
and
went
to
the
lodging
*NL*
occupied
by
Boris
and
Zhilinski
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
in
common
with
the
whole
army
from
which
he
came
,
was
far
from
*NL*
having
experienced
the
change
of
feeling
toward
Napoleon
and
the
French
-
*NL*
-
who
from
being
foes
had
suddenly
become
friends
--
that
had
taken
place
*NL*
at
headquarters
and
in
Boris
.
In
the
army
,
Bonaparte
and
the
French
were
*NL*
still
regarded
with
mingled
feelings
of
anger
,
contempt
,
and
fear
.
Only
*NL*
recently
,
talking
with
one
of
Platov
's
Cossack
officers
,
Rostov
had
*NL*
argued
that
if
Napoleon
were
taken
prisoner
he
would
be
treated
not
as
a
*NL*
sovereign
,
but
as
a
criminal
.
Quite
lately
,
happening
to
meet
a
wounded
*NL*
French
colonel
on
the
road
,
Rostov
had
maintained
with
heat
that
peace
*NL*
was
impossible
between
a
legitimate
sovereign
and
the
criminal
*NL*
Bonaparte
.
Rostov
was
therefore
unpleasantly
struck
by
the
presence
of
*NL*
French
officers
in
Boris
'
lodging
,
dressed
in
uniforms
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
see
from
quite
a
different
point
of
view
from
the
outposts
*NL*
of
the
flank
.
As
soon
as
he
noticed
a
French
officer
,
who
thrust
his
*NL*
head
out
of
the
door
,
that
warlike
feeling
of
hostility
which
he
always
*NL*
experienced
at
the
sight
of
the
enemy
suddenly
seized
him
.
He
stopped
at
*NL*
the
threshold
and
asked
in
Russian
whether
Drubetskoy
lived
there
.
*NL*
Boris
,
hearing
a
strange
voice
in
the
anteroom
,
came
out
to
meet
him
.
An
*NL*
expression
of
annoyance
showed
itself
for
a
moment
on
his
face
on
first
*NL*
recognizing
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
you
?
Very
glad
,
very
glad
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
,
however
,
*NL*
coming
toward
him
with
a
smile
.
But
Rostov
had
noticed
his
first
*NL*
impulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
come
at
a
bad
time
I
think
.
I
should
not
have
come
,
but
I
have
*NL*
business
,
''
he
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
only
wonder
how
you
managed
to
get
away
from
your
regiment
.
Dans
*NL*
un
moment
je
suis
a
vous
,
''
*
he
said
,
answering
someone
who
called
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
In
a
minute
I
shall
be
at
your
disposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
I
'm
intruding
,
''
Rostov
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
annoyance
had
already
disappeared
from
Boris
'
face
:
having
*NL*
evidently
reflected
and
decided
how
to
act
,
he
very
quietly
took
both
*NL*
Rostov
's
hands
and
led
him
into
the
next
room
.
His
eyes
,
looking
*NL*
serenely
and
steadily
at
Rostov
,
seemed
to
be
veiled
by
something
,
as
if
*NL*
screened
by
blue
spectacles
of
conventionality
.
So
it
seemed
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
now
!
As
if
you
could
come
at
a
wrong
time
!
''
said
Boris
,
and
he
*NL*
led
him
into
the
room
where
the
supper
table
was
laid
and
introduced
him
*NL*
to
his
guests
,
explaining
that
he
was
not
a
civilian
,
but
an
hussar
*NL*
officer
,
and
an
old
friend
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Zhilinski
--
le
Comte
N.
N.
--
le
Capitaine
S.
S.
,
''
said
he
,
naming
*NL*
his
guests
.
Rostov
looked
frowningly
at
the
Frenchmen
,
bowed
*NL*
reluctantly
,
and
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zhilinski
evidently
did
not
receive
this
new
Russian
person
very
*NL*
willingly
into
his
circle
and
did
not
speak
to
Rostov
.
Boris
did
not
*NL*
appear
to
notice
the
constraint
the
newcomer
produced
and
,
with
the
same
*NL*
pleasant
composure
and
the
same
veiled
look
in
his
eyes
with
which
he
*NL*
had
met
Rostov
,
tried
to
enliven
the
conversation
.
One
of
the
Frenchmen
,
*NL*
with
the
politeness
characteristic
of
his
countrymen
,
addressed
the
*NL*
obstinately
taciturn
Rostov
,
saying
that
the
latter
had
probably
come
to
*NL*
Tilsit
to
see
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
came
on
business
,
''
replied
Rostov
,
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
been
out
of
humor
from
the
moment
he
noticed
the
look
of
*NL*
dissatisfaction
on
Boris
'
face
,
and
as
always
happens
to
those
in
a
bad
*NL*
humor
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
regarded
him
with
aversion
and
*NL*
that
he
was
in
everybody
's
way
.
He
really
was
in
their
way
,
for
he
alone
*NL*
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
which
again
became
general
.
The
looks
*NL*
the
visitors
cast
on
him
seemed
to
say
:
``
And
what
is
he
sitting
here
*NL*
for
?
''
He
rose
and
went
up
to
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
I
'm
in
your
way
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
tone
.
``
Come
and
talk
over
my
*NL*
business
and
I
'll
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
at
all
,
''
said
Boris
.
``
But
if
you
are
tired
,
come
and
lie
*NL*
down
in
my
room
and
have
a
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
really
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
little
room
where
Boris
slept
.
Rostov
,
without
*NL*
sitting
down
,
began
at
once
,
irritably
-LRB-
as
if
Boris
were
to
blame
in
*NL*
some
way
-RRB-
telling
him
about
Denisov
's
affair
,
asking
him
whether
,
*NL*
through
his
general
,
he
could
and
would
intercede
with
the
Emperor
on
*NL*
Denisov
's
behalf
and
get
Denisov
's
petition
handed
in
.
When
he
and
Boris
*NL*
were
alone
,
Rostov
felt
for
the
first
time
that
he
could
not
look
Boris
*NL*
in
the
face
without
a
sense
of
awkwardness
.
Boris
,
with
one
leg
crossed
*NL*
over
the
other
and
stroking
his
left
hand
with
the
slender
fingers
of
*NL*
his
right
,
listened
to
Rostov
as
a
general
listens
to
the
report
of
a
*NL*
subordinate
,
now
looking
aside
and
now
gazing
straight
into
Rostov
's
*NL*
eyes
with
the
same
veiled
look
.
Each
time
this
happened
Rostov
felt
*NL*
uncomfortable
and
cast
down
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
of
such
cases
and
know
that
His
Majesty
is
very
severe
in
*NL*
such
affairs
.
I
think
it
would
be
best
not
to
bring
it
before
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
but
to
apply
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
...
But
in
general
,
*NL*
I
think
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
?
Well
then
,
say
so
!
''
Rostov
almost
*NL*
shouted
,
not
looking
Boris
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
will
do
what
I
can
.
Only
I
thought
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Zhilinski
's
voice
was
heard
calling
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
go
,
go
,
go
...
''
said
Rostov
,
and
refusing
supper
and
*NL*
remaining
alone
in
the
little
room
,
he
walked
up
and
down
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
hearing
the
lighthearted
French
conversation
from
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
come
to
Tilsit
the
day
least
suitable
for
a
petition
on
*NL*
Denisov
's
behalf
.
He
could
not
himself
go
to
the
general
in
attendance
*NL*
as
he
was
in
mufti
and
had
come
to
Tilsit
without
permission
to
do
so
,
*NL*
and
Boris
,
even
had
he
wished
to
,
could
not
have
done
so
on
the
*NL*
following
day
.
On
that
day
,
June
27
,
the
preliminaries
of
peace
were
*NL*
signed
.
The
Emperors
exchanged
decorations
:
Alexander
received
the
Cross
*NL*
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
and
Napoleon
the
Order
of
St.
Andrew
of
the
First
*NL*
Degree
,
and
a
dinner
had
been
arranged
for
the
evening
,
given
by
a
*NL*
battalion
of
the
French
Guards
to
the
Preobrazhensk
battalion
.
The
*NL*
Emperors
were
to
be
present
at
that
banquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
felt
so
ill
at
ease
and
uncomfortable
with
Boris
that
,
when
the
*NL*
latter
looked
in
after
supper
,
he
pretended
to
be
asleep
,
and
early
next
*NL*
morning
went
away
,
avoiding
Boris
.
In
his
civilian
clothes
and
a
round
*NL*
hat
,
he
wandered
about
the
town
,
staring
at
the
French
and
their
*NL*
uniforms
and
at
the
streets
and
houses
where
the
Russian
and
French
*NL*
Emperors
were
staying
.
In
a
square
he
saw
tables
being
set
up
and
*NL*
preparations
made
for
the
dinner
;
he
saw
the
Russian
and
French
colors
*NL*
draped
from
side
to
side
of
the
streets
,
with
huge
monograms
A
and
N
.
In
*NL*
the
windows
of
the
houses
also
flags
and
bunting
were
displayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boris
does
n't
want
to
help
me
and
I
do
n't
want
to
ask
him
.
That
's
*NL*
settled
,
''
thought
Nicholas
.
``
All
is
over
between
us
,
but
I
wo
n't
leave
*NL*
here
without
having
done
all
I
can
for
Denisov
and
certainly
not
without
*NL*
getting
his
letter
to
the
Emperor
.
The
Emperor
!
...
He
is
here
!
''
thought
*NL*
Rostov
,
who
had
unconsciously
returned
to
the
house
where
Alexander
*NL*
lodged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saddled
horses
were
standing
before
the
house
and
the
suite
were
*NL*
assembling
,
evidently
preparing
for
the
Emperor
to
come
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
see
him
at
any
moment
,
''
thought
Rostov
.
``
If
only
I
were
to
hand
*NL*
the
letter
direct
to
him
and
tell
him
all
...
could
they
really
arrest
me
*NL*
for
my
civilian
clothes
?
Surely
not
!
He
would
understand
on
whose
side
*NL*
justice
lies
.
He
understands
everything
,
knows
everything
.
Who
can
be
*NL*
more
just
,
more
magnanimous
than
he
?
And
even
if
they
did
arrest
me
for
*NL*
being
here
,
what
would
it
matter
?
''
thought
he
,
looking
at
an
officer
who
*NL*
was
entering
the
house
the
Emperor
occupied
.
``
After
all
,
people
do
go
*NL*
in
...
It
's
all
nonsense
!
I
'll
go
in
and
hand
the
letter
to
the
Emperor
*NL*
myself
so
much
the
worse
for
Drubetskoy
who
drives
me
to
it
!
''
And
*NL*
suddenly
with
a
determination
he
himself
did
not
expect
,
Rostov
felt
for
*NL*
the
letter
in
his
pocket
and
went
straight
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
miss
my
opportunity
now
,
as
I
did
after
Austerlitz
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
expecting
every
moment
to
meet
the
monarch
,
and
conscious
of
*NL*
the
blood
that
rushed
to
his
heart
at
the
thought
.
``
I
will
fall
at
his
*NL*
feet
and
beseech
him
.
He
will
lift
me
up
,
will
listen
,
and
will
even
*NL*
thank
me
.
'
I
am
happy
when
I
can
do
good
,
but
to
remedy
injustice
is
the
*NL*
greatest
happiness
,
'
''
Rostov
fancied
the
sovereign
saying
.
And
passing
*NL*
people
who
looked
after
him
with
curiosity
,
he
entered
the
porch
of
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
broad
staircase
led
straight
up
from
the
entry
,
and
to
the
right
he
*NL*
saw
a
closed
door
.
Below
,
under
the
staircase
,
was
a
door
leading
to
the
*NL*
lower
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
want
?
''
someone
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
hand
in
a
letter
,
a
petition
,
to
His
Majesty
,
''
said
Nicholas
,
with
a
*NL*
tremor
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
petition
?
This
way
,
to
the
officer
on
duty
''
-LRB-
he
was
shown
the
door
*NL*
leading
downstairs
-RRB-
,
``
only
it
wo
n't
be
accepted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
indifferent
voice
,
Rostov
grew
frightened
at
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
;
the
thought
of
meeting
the
Emperor
at
any
moment
was
so
*NL*
fascinating
and
consequently
so
alarming
that
he
was
ready
to
run
away
,
*NL*
but
the
official
who
had
questioned
him
opened
the
door
,
and
Rostov
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
stout
man
of
about
thirty
,
in
white
breeches
and
high
boots
and
*NL*
a
batiste
shirt
that
he
had
evidently
only
just
put
on
,
standing
in
that
*NL*
room
,
and
his
valet
was
buttoning
on
to
the
back
of
his
breeches
a
new
*NL*
pair
of
handsome
silk-embroidered
braces
that
,
for
some
reason
,
*NL*
attracted
Rostov
's
attention
.
This
man
was
speaking
to
someone
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
figure
and
in
her
first
bloom
,
''
he
was
saying
,
but
on
seeing
*NL*
Rostov
,
he
stopped
short
and
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
A
petition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
the
person
in
the
other
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
petitioner
,
''
answered
the
man
with
the
braces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
to
come
later
.
He
'll
be
coming
out
directly
,
we
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Later
...
later
!
Tomorrow
.
It
's
too
late
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
turned
and
was
about
to
go
,
but
the
man
in
the
braces
stopped
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
have
you
come
from
?
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
Major
Denisov
,
''
answered
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
an
officer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lieutenant
Count
Rostov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
audacity
!
Hand
it
in
through
your
commander
.
And
go
along
with
*NL*
you
...
go
,
''
and
he
continued
to
put
on
the
uniform
the
valet
handed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
went
back
into
the
hall
and
noticed
that
in
the
porch
there
were
*NL*
many
officers
and
generals
in
full
parade
uniform
,
whom
he
had
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cursing
his
temerity
,
his
heart
sinking
at
the
thought
of
finding
*NL*
himself
at
any
moment
face
to
face
with
the
Emperor
and
being
put
to
*NL*
shame
and
arrested
in
his
presence
,
fully
alive
now
to
the
impropriety
*NL*
of
his
conduct
and
repenting
of
it
,
Rostov
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
was
*NL*
making
his
way
out
of
the
house
through
the
brilliant
suite
when
a
*NL*
familiar
voice
called
him
and
a
hand
detained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
,
sir
,
in
civilian
dress
?
''
asked
a
deep
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cavalry
general
who
had
obtained
the
Emperor
's
special
favor
*NL*
during
this
campaign
,
and
who
had
formerly
commanded
the
division
in
*NL*
which
Rostov
was
serving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
in
dismay
,
began
justifying
himself
,
but
seeing
the
kindly
,
*NL*
jocular
face
of
the
general
,
he
took
him
aside
and
in
an
excited
voice
*NL*
told
him
the
whole
affair
,
asking
him
to
intercede
for
Denisov
,
whom
the
*NL*
general
knew
.
Having
heard
Rostov
to
the
end
,
the
general
shook
his
head
*NL*
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
sorry
for
that
fine
fellow
.
Give
me
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
Rostov
handed
him
the
letter
and
finished
explaining
*NL*
Denisov
's
case
,
when
hasty
steps
and
the
jingling
of
spurs
were
heard
on
*NL*
the
stairs
,
and
the
general
,
leaving
him
,
went
to
the
porch
.
The
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
Emperor
's
suite
ran
down
the
stairs
and
went
to
their
*NL*
horses
.
Hayne
,
the
same
groom
who
had
been
at
Austerlitz
,
led
up
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
horse
,
and
the
faint
creak
of
a
footstep
Rostov
knew
at
once
*NL*
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
Forgetting
the
danger
of
being
recognized
,
*NL*
Rostov
went
close
to
the
porch
,
together
with
some
inquisitive
*NL*
civilians
,
and
again
,
after
two
years
,
saw
those
features
he
adored
:
*NL*
that
same
face
and
same
look
and
step
,
and
the
same
union
of
majesty
and
*NL*
mildness
...
And
the
feeling
of
enthusiasm
and
love
for
his
sovereign
*NL*
rose
again
in
Rostov
's
soul
in
all
its
old
force
.
In
the
uniform
of
the
*NL*
Preobrazhensk
regiment
--
white
chamois-leather
breeches
and
high
boots
--
*NL*
and
wearing
a
star
Rostov
did
not
know
-LRB-
it
was
that
of
the
Legion
*NL*
d'honneur
-RRB-
,
the
monarch
came
out
into
the
porch
,
putting
on
his
gloves
*NL*
and
carrying
his
hat
under
his
arm
.
He
stopped
and
looked
about
him
,
*NL*
brightening
everything
around
by
his
glance
.
He
spoke
a
few
words
to
*NL*
some
of
the
generals
,
and
,
recognizing
the
former
commander
of
Rostov
's
*NL*
division
,
smiled
and
beckoned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
suite
drew
back
and
Rostov
saw
the
general
talking
for
some
time
*NL*
to
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
said
a
few
words
to
him
and
took
a
step
toward
his
horse
.
*NL*
Again
the
crowd
of
members
of
the
suite
and
street
gazers
-LRB-
among
whom
*NL*
was
Rostov
-RRB-
moved
nearer
to
the
Emperor
.
Stopping
beside
his
horse
,
with
*NL*
his
hand
on
the
saddle
,
the
Emperor
turned
to
the
cavalry
general
and
*NL*
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
evidently
wishing
to
be
heard
by
all
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
do
it
,
General
.
I
can
not
,
because
the
law
is
stronger
than
I
,
''
*NL*
and
he
raised
his
foot
to
the
stirrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
bowed
his
head
respectfully
,
and
the
monarch
mounted
and
*NL*
rode
down
the
street
at
a
gallop
.
Beside
himself
with
enthusiasm
,
Rostov
*NL*
ran
after
him
with
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
rode
to
the
square
where
,
facing
one
another
,
a
battalion
of
*NL*
the
Preobrazhensk
regiment
stood
on
the
right
and
a
battalion
of
the
*NL*
French
Guards
in
their
bearskin
caps
on
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Tsar
rode
up
to
one
flank
of
the
battalions
,
which
presented
*NL*
arms
,
another
group
of
horsemen
galloped
up
to
the
opposite
flank
,
and
*NL*
at
the
head
of
them
Rostov
recognized
Napoleon
.
It
could
be
no
one
else
.
*NL*
He
came
at
a
gallop
,
wearing
a
small
hat
,
a
blue
uniform
open
over
a
*NL*
white
vest
,
and
the
St.
Andrew
ribbon
over
his
shoulder
.
He
was
riding
a
*NL*
very
fine
thoroughbred
gray
Arab
horse
with
a
crimson
gold-embroidered
*NL*
saddlecloth
.
On
approaching
Alexander
he
raised
his
hat
,
and
as
he
did
*NL*
so
,
Rostov
,
with
his
cavalryman
's
eye
,
could
not
help
noticing
that
*NL*
Napoleon
did
not
sit
well
or
firmly
in
the
saddle
.
The
battalions
*NL*
shouted
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
Napoleon
said
something
to
*NL*
Alexander
,
and
both
Emperors
dismounted
and
took
each
other
's
hands
.
*NL*
Napoleon
's
face
wore
an
unpleasant
and
artificial
smile
.
Alexander
was
*NL*
saying
something
affable
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
trampling
of
the
French
gendarmes
'
horses
,
which
were
*NL*
pushing
back
the
crowd
,
Rostov
kept
his
eyes
on
every
movement
of
*NL*
Alexander
and
Bonaparte
.
It
struck
him
as
a
surprise
that
Alexander
*NL*
treated
Bonaparte
as
an
equal
and
that
the
latter
was
quite
at
ease
with
*NL*
the
Tsar
,
as
if
such
relations
with
an
Emperor
were
an
everyday
matter
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
and
Napoleon
,
with
the
long
train
of
their
suites
,
approached
*NL*
the
right
flank
of
the
Preobrazhensk
battalion
and
came
straight
up
to
*NL*
the
crowd
standing
there
.
The
crowd
unexpectedly
found
itself
so
close
*NL*
to
the
Emperors
that
Rostov
,
standing
in
the
front
row
,
was
afraid
he
*NL*
might
be
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
I
ask
your
permission
to
present
the
Legion
of
Honor
to
the
*NL*
bravest
of
your
soldiers
,
''
said
a
sharp
,
precise
voice
,
articulating
*NL*
every
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
by
the
undersized
Napoleon
,
looking
up
straight
into
*NL*
Alexander
's
eyes
.
Alexander
listened
attentively
to
what
was
said
to
him
*NL*
and
,
bending
his
head
,
smiled
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
him
who
has
borne
himself
most
bravely
in
this
last
war
,
''
added
*NL*
Napoleon
,
accentuating
each
syllable
,
as
with
a
composure
and
assurance
*NL*
exasperating
to
Rostov
,
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
Russian
ranks
drawn
up
*NL*
before
him
,
who
all
presented
arms
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
their
*NL*
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Your
Majesty
allow
me
to
consult
the
colonel
?
''
said
Alexander
and
*NL*
took
a
few
hasty
steps
toward
Prince
Kozlovski
,
the
commander
of
the
*NL*
battalion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bonaparte
meanwhile
began
taking
the
glove
off
his
small
white
hand
,
*NL*
tore
it
in
doing
so
,
and
threw
it
away
.
An
aide-de-camp
behind
him
*NL*
rushed
forward
and
picked
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
shall
it
be
given
?
''
the
Emperor
Alexander
asked
Koslovski
,
in
*NL*
Russian
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whomever
Your
Majesty
commands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
knit
his
brows
with
dissatisfaction
and
,
glancing
back
,
*NL*
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
must
give
him
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kozlovski
scanned
the
ranks
resolutely
and
included
Rostov
in
his
*NL*
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
me
?
''
thought
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lazarev
!
''
the
colonel
called
,
with
a
frown
,
and
Lazarev
,
the
first
*NL*
soldier
in
the
rank
,
stepped
briskly
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
Stop
here
!
''
voices
whispered
to
Lazarev
who
did
*NL*
not
know
where
to
go
.
Lazarev
stopped
,
casting
a
sidelong
look
at
his
*NL*
colonel
in
alarm
.
His
face
twitched
,
as
often
happens
to
soldiers
called
*NL*
before
the
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
slightly
turned
his
head
,
and
put
his
plump
little
hand
out
*NL*
behind
him
as
if
to
take
something
.
The
members
of
his
suite
,
guessing
*NL*
at
once
what
he
wanted
,
moved
about
and
whispered
as
they
passed
*NL*
something
from
one
to
another
,
and
a
page
--
the
same
one
Rostov
had
seen
*NL*
the
previous
evening
at
Boris
'
--
ran
forward
and
,
bowing
respectfully
*NL*
over
the
outstretched
hand
and
not
keeping
it
waiting
a
moment
,
laid
in
*NL*
it
an
Order
on
a
red
ribbon
.
Napoleon
,
without
looking
,
pressed
two
*NL*
fingers
together
and
the
badge
was
between
them
.
Then
he
approached
*NL*
Lazarev
-LRB-
who
rolled
his
eyes
and
persistently
gazed
at
his
own
monarch
-RRB-
,
*NL*
looked
round
at
the
Emperor
Alexander
to
imply
that
what
he
was
now
*NL*
doing
was
done
for
the
sake
of
his
ally
,
and
the
small
white
hand
*NL*
holding
the
Order
touched
one
of
Lazarev
's
buttons
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
Napoleon
knew
that
it
was
only
necessary
for
his
hand
to
deign
to
touch
*NL*
that
soldier
's
breast
for
the
soldier
to
be
forever
happy
,
rewarded
,
and
*NL*
distinguished
from
everyone
else
in
the
world
.
Napoleon
merely
laid
the
*NL*
cross
on
Lazarev
's
breast
and
,
dropping
his
hand
,
turned
toward
*NL*
Alexander
as
though
sure
that
the
cross
would
adhere
there
.
And
it
*NL*
really
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Officious
hands
,
Russian
and
French
,
immediately
seized
the
cross
and
*NL*
fastened
it
to
the
uniform
.
Lazarev
glanced
morosely
at
the
little
man
*NL*
with
white
hands
who
was
doing
something
to
him
and
,
still
standing
*NL*
motionless
presenting
arms
,
looked
again
straight
into
Alexander
's
eyes
,
*NL*
as
if
asking
whether
he
should
stand
there
,
or
go
away
,
or
do
something
*NL*
else
.
But
receiving
no
orders
,
he
remained
for
some
time
in
that
rigid
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperors
remounted
and
rode
away
.
The
Preobrazhensk
battalion
,
*NL*
breaking
rank
,
mingled
with
the
French
Guards
and
sat
down
at
the
tables
*NL*
prepared
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lazarev
sat
in
the
place
of
honor
.
Russian
and
French
officers
embraced
*NL*
him
,
congratulated
him
,
and
pressed
his
hands
.
Crowds
of
officers
and
*NL*
civilians
drew
near
merely
to
see
him
.
A
rumble
of
Russian
and
French
*NL*
voices
and
laughter
filled
the
air
round
the
tables
in
the
square
.
Two
*NL*
officers
with
flushed
faces
,
looking
cheerful
and
happy
,
passed
by
*NL*
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
d'you
think
of
the
treat
?
All
on
silver
plate
,
''
one
of
them
was
*NL*
saying
.
``
Have
you
seen
Lazarev
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
,
I
hear
,
the
Preobrazhenskis
will
give
them
a
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
what
luck
for
Lazarev
!
Twelve
hundred
francs
'
pension
for
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
cap
,
lads
!
''
shouted
a
Preobrazhensk
soldier
,
donning
a
shaggy
*NL*
French
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fine
thing
!
First-rate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
the
password
?
''
asked
one
Guards
'
officer
of
another
.
*NL*
``
The
day
before
yesterday
it
was
`
Napoleon
,
France
,
bravoure
'
;
*NL*
yesterday
,
`
Alexandre
,
Russie
,
grandeur
.
'
One
day
our
Emperor
gives
it
*NL*
and
next
day
Napoleon
.
Tomorrow
our
Emperor
will
send
a
St.
George
's
*NL*
Cross
to
the
bravest
of
the
French
Guards
.
It
has
to
be
done
.
He
must
*NL*
respond
in
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
,
too
,
with
his
friend
Zhilinski
,
came
to
see
the
Preobrazhensk
*NL*
banquet
.
On
his
way
back
,
he
noticed
Rostov
standing
by
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rostov
!
How
d'you
do
?
We
missed
one
another
,
''
he
said
,
and
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
asking
what
was
the
matter
,
so
strangely
dismal
and
*NL*
troubled
was
Rostov
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
,
''
replied
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
call
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
stood
at
that
corner
for
a
long
time
,
watching
the
feast
from
a
*NL*
distance
.
In
his
mind
,
a
painful
process
was
going
on
which
he
could
not
*NL*
bring
to
a
conclusion
.
Terrible
doubts
rose
in
his
soul
.
Now
he
*NL*
remembered
Denisov
with
his
changed
expression
,
his
submission
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
hospital
,
with
arms
and
legs
torn
off
and
its
dirt
and
disease
.
So
*NL*
vividly
did
he
recall
that
hospital
stench
of
dead
flesh
that
he
looked
*NL*
round
to
see
where
the
smell
came
from
.
Next
he
thought
of
that
self
-
*NL*
satisfied
Bonaparte
,
with
his
small
white
hand
,
who
was
now
an
Emperor
,
*NL*
liked
and
respected
by
Alexander
.
Then
why
those
severed
arms
and
legs
*NL*
and
those
dead
men
?
...
Then
again
he
thought
of
Lazarev
rewarded
and
*NL*
Denisov
punished
and
unpardoned
.
He
caught
himself
harboring
such
*NL*
strange
thoughts
that
he
was
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smell
of
the
food
the
Preobrazhenskis
were
eating
and
a
sense
of
*NL*
hunger
recalled
him
from
these
reflections
;
he
had
to
get
something
to
*NL*
eat
before
going
away
.
He
went
to
a
hotel
he
had
noticed
that
morning
.
*NL*
There
he
found
so
many
people
,
among
them
officers
who
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
had
come
in
civilian
clothes
,
that
he
had
difficulty
in
getting
a
*NL*
dinner
.
Two
officers
of
his
own
division
joined
him
.
The
conversation
*NL*
naturally
turned
on
the
peace
.
The
officers
,
his
comrades
,
like
most
of
*NL*
the
army
,
were
dissatisfied
with
the
peace
concluded
after
the
battle
of
*NL*
Friedland
.
They
said
that
had
we
held
out
a
little
longer
Napoleon
would
*NL*
have
been
done
for
,
as
his
troops
had
neither
provisions
nor
ammunition
.
*NL*
Nicholas
ate
and
drank
-LRB-
chiefly
the
latter
-RRB-
in
silence
.
He
finished
a
*NL*
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
by
himself
.
The
process
in
his
mind
went
on
*NL*
tormenting
him
without
reaching
a
conclusion
.
He
feared
to
give
way
to
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
yet
could
not
get
rid
of
them
.
Suddenly
,
on
one
of
the
*NL*
officers
'
saying
that
it
was
humiliating
to
look
at
the
French
,
Rostov
*NL*
began
shouting
with
uncalled-for
wrath
,
and
therefore
much
to
the
*NL*
surprise
of
the
officers
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
judge
what
's
best
?
''
he
cried
,
the
blood
suddenly
rushing
to
*NL*
his
face
.
``
How
can
you
judge
the
Emperor
's
actions
?
What
right
have
we
*NL*
to
argue
?
We
can
not
comprehend
either
the
Emperor
's
aims
or
his
*NL*
actions
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
never
said
a
word
about
the
Emperor
!
''
said
the
officer
,
*NL*
justifying
himself
,
and
unable
to
understand
Rostov
's
outburst
,
except
*NL*
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Rostov
did
not
listen
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
diplomatic
officials
,
we
are
soldiers
and
nothing
more
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
.
``
If
we
are
ordered
to
die
,
we
must
die
.
If
we
're
punished
,
it
*NL*
means
that
we
have
deserved
it
,
it
's
not
for
us
to
judge
.
If
the
Emperor
*NL*
pleases
to
recognize
Bonaparte
as
Emperor
and
to
conclude
an
alliance
*NL*
with
him
,
it
means
that
that
is
the
right
thing
to
do
.
If
once
we
begin
*NL*
judging
and
arguing
about
everything
,
nothing
sacred
will
be
left
!
That
*NL*
way
we
shall
be
saying
there
is
no
God
--
nothing
!
''
shouted
Nicholas
,
*NL*
banging
the
table
--
very
little
to
the
point
as
it
seemed
to
his
*NL*
listeners
,
but
quite
relevantly
to
the
course
of
his
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
business
is
to
do
our
duty
,
to
fight
and
not
to
think
!
That
's
*NL*
all
...
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
drink
,
''
said
one
of
the
officers
,
not
wishing
to
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
to
drink
,
''
assented
Nicholas
.
``
Hullo
there
!
Another
bottle
!
''
*NL*
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1808
the
Emperor
Alexander
went
to
Erfurt
for
a
fresh
interview
with
*NL*
the
Emperor
Napoleon
,
and
in
the
upper
circles
of
Petersburg
there
was
*NL*
much
talk
of
the
grandeur
of
this
important
meeting
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
In
1809
the
intimacy
between
``
the
world
's
two
arbiters
,
''
as
Napoleon
and
*NL*
Alexander
were
called
,
was
such
that
when
Napoleon
declared
war
on
*NL*
Austria
a
Russian
corps
crossed
the
frontier
to
co-operate
with
our
old
*NL*
enemy
Bonaparte
against
our
old
ally
the
Emperor
of
Austria
,
and
in
*NL*
court
circles
the
possibility
of
marriage
between
Napoleon
and
one
of
*NL*
Alexander
's
sisters
was
spoken
of
.
But
besides
considerations
of
foreign
*NL*
policy
,
the
attention
of
Russian
society
was
at
that
time
keenly
*NL*
directed
on
the
internal
changes
that
were
being
undertaken
in
all
the
*NL*
departments
of
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
meanwhile
--
real
life
,
with
its
essential
interests
of
health
and
*NL*
sickness
,
toil
and
rest
,
and
its
intellectual
interests
in
thought
,
*NL*
science
,
poetry
,
music
,
love
,
friendship
,
hatred
,
and
passions
--
went
on
*NL*
as
usual
,
independently
of
and
apart
from
political
friendship
or
enmity
*NL*
with
Napoleon
Bonaparte
and
from
all
the
schemes
of
reconstruction

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
spent
two
years
continuously
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
plans
Pierre
had
attempted
on
his
estates
--
and
constantly
*NL*
changing
from
one
thing
to
another
had
never
accomplished
--
were
carried
*NL*
out
by
Prince
Andrew
without
display
and
without
perceptible
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
in
the
highest
degree
a
practical
tenacity
which
Pierre
lacked
,
*NL*
and
without
fuss
or
strain
on
his
part
this
set
things
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
his
estates
the
three
hundred
serfs
were
liberated
and
became
*NL*
free
agricultural
laborers
--
this
being
one
of
the
first
examples
of
the
*NL*
kind
in
Russia
.
On
other
estates
the
serfs
'
compulsory
labor
was
*NL*
commuted
for
a
quitrent
.
A
trained
midwife
was
engaged
for
Bogucharovo
*NL*
at
his
expense
,
and
a
priest
was
paid
to
teach
reading
and
writing
to
*NL*
the
children
of
the
peasants
and
household
serfs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
spent
half
his
time
at
Bald
Hills
with
his
father
and
his
*NL*
son
,
who
was
still
in
the
care
of
nurses
.
The
other
half
he
spent
in
*NL*
``
Bogucharovo
Cloister
,
''
as
his
father
called
Prince
Andrew
's
estate
.
*NL*
Despite
the
indifference
to
the
affairs
of
the
world
he
had
expressed
to
*NL*
Pierre
,
he
diligently
followed
all
that
went
on
,
received
many
books
,
*NL*
and
to
his
surprise
noticed
that
when
he
or
his
father
had
visitors
from
*NL*
Petersburg
,
the
very
vortex
of
life
,
these
people
lagged
behind
himself
-
*NL*
-
who
never
left
the
country
--
in
knowledge
of
what
was
happening
in
home
*NL*
and
foreign
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
being
occupied
with
his
estates
and
reading
a
great
variety
of
*NL*
books
,
Prince
Andrew
was
at
this
time
busy
with
a
critical
survey
of
our
*NL*
last
two
unfortunate
campaigns
,
and
with
drawing
up
a
proposal
for
a
*NL*
reform
of
the
army
rules
and
regulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
of
1809
he
went
to
visit
the
Ryazan
estates
which
had
been
*NL*
inherited
by
his
son
,
whose
guardian
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Warmed
by
the
spring
sunshine
he
sat
in
the
caleche
looking
at
the
new
*NL*
grass
,
the
first
leaves
on
the
birches
,
and
the
first
puffs
of
white
*NL*
spring
clouds
floating
across
the
clear
blue
sky
.
He
was
not
thinking
of
*NL*
anything
,
but
looked
absent-mindedly
and
cheerfully
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
ferry
where
he
had
talked
with
Pierre
the
year
before
.
*NL*
They
went
through
the
muddy
village
,
past
threshing
floors
and
green
*NL*
fields
of
winter
rye
,
downhill
where
snow
still
lodged
near
the
bridge
,
*NL*
uphill
where
the
clay
had
been
liquefied
by
the
rain
,
past
strips
of
*NL*
stubble
land
and
bushes
touched
with
green
here
and
there
,
and
into
a
*NL*
birch
forest
growing
on
both
sides
of
the
road
.
In
the
forest
it
was
*NL*
almost
hot
,
no
wind
could
be
felt
.
The
birches
with
their
sticky
green
*NL*
leaves
were
motionless
,
and
lilac-colored
flowers
and
the
first
blades
*NL*
of
green
grass
were
pushing
up
and
lifting
last
year
's
leaves
.
The
*NL*
coarse
evergreen
color
of
the
small
fir
trees
scattered
here
and
there
*NL*
among
the
birches
was
an
unpleasant
reminder
of
winter
.
On
entering
the
*NL*
forest
the
horses
began
to
snort
and
sweated
visibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
the
footman
made
some
remark
to
the
coachman
;
the
latter
assented
.
*NL*
But
apparently
the
coachman
's
sympathy
was
not
enough
for
Peter
,
and
he
*NL*
turned
on
the
box
toward
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pleasant
it
is
,
your
excellency
!
''
he
said
with
a
respectful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
pleasant
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
he
talking
about
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Oh
,
the
spring
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
''
he
thought
as
he
turned
round
.
``
Yes
,
really
everything
is
*NL*
green
already
...
How
early
!
The
birches
and
cherry
and
alders
too
are
*NL*
coming
out
...
But
the
oaks
show
no
sign
yet
.
Ah
,
here
is
one
oak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
edge
of
the
road
stood
an
oak
.
Probably
ten
times
the
age
of
the
*NL*
birches
that
formed
the
forest
,
it
was
ten
times
as
thick
and
twice
as
*NL*
tall
as
they
.
It
was
an
enormous
tree
,
its
girth
twice
as
great
as
a
man
*NL*
could
embrace
,
and
evidently
long
ago
some
of
its
branches
had
been
*NL*
broken
off
and
its
bark
scarred
.
With
its
huge
ungainly
limbs
sprawling
*NL*
unsymmetrically
,
and
its
gnarled
hands
and
fingers
,
it
stood
an
aged
,
*NL*
stern
,
and
scornful
monster
among
the
smiling
birch
trees
.
Only
the
*NL*
dead-looking
evergreen
firs
dotted
about
in
the
forest
,
and
this
oak
,
*NL*
refused
to
yield
to
the
charm
of
spring
or
notice
either
the
spring
or
*NL*
the
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spring
,
love
,
happiness
!
''
this
oak
seemed
to
say
.
``
Are
you
not
weary
of
*NL*
that
stupid
,
meaningless
,
constantly
repeated
fraud
?
Always
the
same
and
*NL*
always
a
fraud
?
There
is
no
spring
,
no
sun
,
no
happiness
!
Look
at
those
*NL*
cramped
dead
firs
,
ever
the
same
,
and
at
me
too
,
sticking
out
my
broken
*NL*
and
barked
fingers
just
where
they
have
grown
,
whether
from
my
back
or
*NL*
my
sides
:
as
they
have
grown
so
I
stand
,
and
I
do
not
believe
in
your
*NL*
hopes
and
your
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
passed
through
the
forest
Prince
Andrew
turned
several
times
to
*NL*
look
at
that
oak
,
as
if
expecting
something
from
it
.
Under
the
oak
,
too
,
*NL*
were
flowers
and
grass
,
but
it
stood
among
them
scowling
,
rigid
,
*NL*
misshapen
,
and
grim
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
oak
is
right
,
a
thousand
times
right
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
``
Let
others
--
the
young
--
yield
afresh
to
that
fraud
,
but
we
know
life
,
*NL*
our
life
is
finished
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
whole
sequence
of
new
thoughts
,
hopeless
but
mournfully
pleasant
,
rose
*NL*
in
his
soul
in
connection
with
that
tree
.
During
this
journey
he
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
considered
his
life
afresh
and
arrived
at
his
old
conclusion
,
*NL*
restful
in
its
hopelessness
:
that
it
was
not
for
him
to
begin
anything
*NL*
anew
--
but
that
he
must
live
out
his
life
,
content
to
do
no
harm
,
and
not
*NL*
disturbing
himself
or
desiring
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
to
see
the
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
for
the
district
in
*NL*
connection
with
the
affairs
of
the
Ryazan
estate
of
which
he
was
*NL*
trustee
.
This
Marshal
was
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
and
in
the
middle
of
May
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
to
visit
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
hot
spring
weather
.
The
whole
forest
was
already
clothed
in
*NL*
green
.
It
was
dusty
and
so
hot
that
on
passing
near
water
one
longed
to
*NL*
bathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
depressed
and
preoccupied
with
the
business
about
which
*NL*
he
had
to
speak
to
the
Marshal
,
was
driving
up
the
avenue
in
the
grounds
*NL*
of
the
Rostovs
'
house
at
Otradnoe
.
He
heard
merry
girlish
cries
behind
*NL*
some
trees
on
the
right
and
saw
a
group
of
girls
running
to
cross
the
*NL*
path
of
his
caleche
.
Ahead
of
the
rest
and
nearer
to
him
ran
a
dark
-
*NL*
haired
,
remarkably
slim
,
pretty
girl
in
a
yellow
chintz
dress
,
with
a
*NL*
white
handkerchief
on
her
head
from
under
which
loose
locks
of
hair
*NL*
escaped
.
The
girl
was
shouting
something
but
,
seeing
that
he
was
a
*NL*
stranger
,
ran
back
laughing
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
did
not
know
why
,
he
felt
a
pang
.
The
day
was
so
beautiful
,
*NL*
the
sun
so
bright
,
everything
around
so
gay
,
but
that
slim
pretty
girl
*NL*
did
not
know
,
or
wish
to
know
,
of
his
existence
and
was
contented
and
*NL*
cheerful
in
her
own
separate
--
probably
foolish
--
but
bright
and
happy
*NL*
life
.
``
What
is
she
so
glad
about
?
What
is
she
thinking
of
?
Not
of
the
*NL*
military
regulations
or
of
the
arrangement
of
the
Ryazan
serfs
'
*NL*
quitrents
.
Of
what
is
she
thinking
?
Why
is
she
so
happy
?
''
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
asked
himself
with
instinctive
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1809
Count
Ilya
Rostov
was
living
at
Otradnoe
just
as
he
had
done
in
*NL*
former
years
,
that
is
,
entertaining
almost
the
whole
province
with
*NL*
hunts
,
theatricals
,
dinners
,
and
music
.
He
was
glad
to
see
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
as
he
was
to
see
any
new
visitor
,
and
insisted
on
his
staying
*NL*
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
dull
day
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
entertained
by
his
*NL*
elderly
hosts
and
by
the
more
important
of
the
visitors
-LRB-
the
old
count
's
*NL*
house
was
crowded
on
account
of
an
approaching
name
day
-RRB-
,
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
repeatedly
glanced
at
Natasha
,
gay
and
laughing
among
the
younger
*NL*
members
of
the
company
,
and
asked
himself
each
time
,
``
What
is
she
*NL*
thinking
about
?
Why
is
she
so
glad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
alone
in
new
surroundings
,
he
was
long
unable
to
sleep
.
He
*NL*
read
awhile
and
then
put
out
his
candle
,
but
relit
it
.
It
was
hot
in
the
*NL*
room
,
the
inside
shutters
of
which
were
closed
.
He
was
cross
with
the
*NL*
stupid
old
man
-LRB-
as
he
called
Rostov
-RRB-
,
who
had
made
him
stay
by
assuring
*NL*
him
that
some
necessary
documents
had
not
yet
arrived
from
town
,
and
he
*NL*
was
vexed
with
himself
for
having
stayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
to
open
it
.
As
soon
as
he
opened
the
*NL*
shutters
the
moonlight
,
as
if
it
had
long
been
watching
for
this
,
burst
*NL*
into
the
room
.
He
opened
the
casement
.
The
night
was
fresh
,
bright
,
and
*NL*
very
still
.
Just
before
the
window
was
a
row
of
pollard
trees
,
looking
*NL*
black
on
one
side
and
with
a
silvery
light
on
the
other
.
Beneath
the
*NL*
trees
grew
some
kind
of
lush
,
wet
,
bushy
vegetation
with
silver-lit
*NL*
leaves
and
stems
here
and
there
.
Farther
back
beyond
the
dark
trees
a
*NL*
roof
glittered
with
dew
,
to
the
right
was
a
leafy
tree
with
brilliantly
*NL*
white
trunk
and
branches
,
and
above
it
shone
the
moon
,
nearly
at
its
*NL*
full
,
in
a
pale
,
almost
starless
,
spring
sky
.
Prince
Andrew
leaned
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
window
ledge
and
his
eyes
rested
on
that
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
room
was
on
the
first
floor
.
Those
in
the
rooms
above
were
also
*NL*
awake
.
He
heard
female
voices
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
once
more
,
''
said
a
girlish
voice
above
him
which
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
recognized
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
are
you
coming
to
bed
?
''
replied
another
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
I
ca
n't
sleep
,
what
's
the
use
?
Come
now
for
the
last
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
girlish
voices
sang
a
musical
passage
--
the
end
of
some
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
lovely
!
Now
go
to
sleep
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
to
sleep
,
but
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
the
first
voice
,
coming
nearer
to
*NL*
the
window
.
She
was
evidently
leaning
right
out
,
for
the
rustle
of
her
*NL*
dress
and
even
her
breathing
could
be
heard
.
Everything
was
stone-still
,
*NL*
like
the
moon
and
its
light
and
the
shadows
.
Prince
Andrew
,
too
,
dared
*NL*
not
stir
,
for
fear
of
betraying
his
unintentional
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
Sonya
!
''
he
again
heard
the
first
speaker
.
``
Oh
,
how
can
you
*NL*
sleep
?
Only
look
how
glorious
it
is
!
Ah
,
how
glorious
!
Do
wake
up
,
*NL*
Sonya
!
''
she
said
almost
with
tears
in
her
voice
.
``
There
never
,
never
was
*NL*
such
a
lovely
night
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
made
some
reluctant
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
just
come
and
see
what
a
moon
!
...
Oh
,
how
lovely
!
Come
here
...
*NL*
Darling
,
sweetheart
,
come
here
!
There
,
you
see
?
I
feel
like
sitting
down
*NL*
on
my
heels
,
putting
my
arms
round
my
knees
like
this
,
straining
tight
,
*NL*
as
tight
as
possible
,
and
flying
away
!
Like
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
you
'll
fall
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
and
Sonya
's
disapproving
voice
:
``
It
's
*NL*
past
one
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
only
spoil
things
for
me
.
All
right
,
go
,
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
all
was
silent
,
but
Prince
Andrew
knew
she
was
still
sitting
*NL*
there
.
From
time
to
time
he
heard
a
soft
rustle
and
at
times
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
,
O
God
!
What
does
it
mean
?
''
she
suddenly
exclaimed
.
``
To
bed
then
,
*NL*
if
it
must
be
!
''
and
she
slammed
the
casement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
her
I
might
as
well
not
exist
!
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
while
he
*NL*
listened
to
her
voice
,
for
some
reason
expecting
yet
fearing
that
she
*NL*
might
say
something
about
him
.
``
There
she
is
again
!
As
if
it
were
on
*NL*
purpose
,
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
soul
there
suddenly
arose
such
an
unexpected
turmoil
of
youthful
*NL*
thoughts
and
hopes
,
contrary
to
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
,
that
unable
*NL*
to
explain
his
condition
to
himself
he
lay
down
and
fell
asleep
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
having
taken
leave
of
no
one
but
the
count
,
and
not
*NL*
waiting
for
the
ladies
to
appear
,
Prince
Andrew
set
off
for
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
the
beginning
of
June
when
on
his
return
journey
he
drove
*NL*
into
the
birch
forest
where
the
gnarled
old
oak
had
made
so
strange
and
*NL*
memorable
an
impression
on
him
.
In
the
forest
the
harness
bells
sounded
*NL*
yet
more
muffled
than
they
had
done
six
weeks
before
,
for
now
all
was
*NL*
thick
,
shady
,
and
dense
,
and
the
young
firs
dotted
about
in
the
forest
*NL*
did
not
jar
on
the
general
beauty
but
,
lending
themselves
to
the
mood
*NL*
around
,
were
delicately
green
with
fluffy
young
shoots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
day
had
been
hot
.
Somewhere
a
storm
was
gathering
,
but
only
a
*NL*
small
cloud
had
scattered
some
raindrops
lightly
,
sprinkling
the
road
*NL*
and
the
sappy
leaves
.
The
left
side
of
the
forest
was
dark
in
the
shade
,
*NL*
the
right
side
glittered
in
the
sunlight
,
wet
and
shiny
and
scarcely
*NL*
swayed
by
the
breeze
.
Everything
was
in
blossom
,
the
nightingales
*NL*
trilled
,
and
their
voices
reverberated
now
near
,
now
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
in
this
forest
was
that
oak
with
which
I
agreed
,
''
thought
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
``
But
where
is
it
?
''
he
again
wondered
,
gazing
at
the
left
*NL*
side
of
the
road
,
and
without
recognizing
it
he
looked
with
admiration
*NL*
at
the
very
oak
he
sought
.
The
old
oak
,
quite
transfigured
,
spreading
*NL*
out
a
canopy
of
sappy
dark-green
foliage
,
stood
rapt
and
slightly
*NL*
trembling
in
the
rays
of
the
evening
sun
.
Neither
gnarled
fingers
nor
*NL*
old
scars
nor
old
doubts
and
sorrows
were
any
of
them
in
evidence
now
.
*NL*
Through
the
hard
century-old
bark
,
even
where
there
were
no
twigs
,
*NL*
leaves
had
sprouted
such
as
one
could
hardly
believe
the
old
veteran
*NL*
could
have
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
the
same
oak
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
and
all
at
once
he
was
*NL*
seized
by
an
unreasoning
springtime
feeling
of
joy
and
renewal
.
All
the
*NL*
best
moments
of
his
life
suddenly
rose
to
his
memory
.
Austerlitz
with
*NL*
the
lofty
heavens
,
his
wife
's
dead
reproachful
face
,
Pierre
at
the
*NL*
ferry
,
that
girl
thrilled
by
the
beauty
of
the
night
,
and
that
night
*NL*
itself
and
the
moon
,
and
...
all
this
rushed
suddenly
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
life
is
not
over
at
thirty-one
!
''
Prince
Andrew
suddenly
decided
*NL*
finally
and
decisively
.
``
It
is
not
enough
for
me
to
know
what
I
have
in
*NL*
me
--
everyone
must
know
it
:
Pierre
,
and
that
young
girl
who
wanted
to
fly
*NL*
away
into
the
sky
,
everyone
must
know
me
,
so
that
my
life
may
not
be
*NL*
lived
for
myself
alone
while
others
live
so
apart
from
it
,
but
so
that
*NL*
it
may
be
reflected
in
them
all
,
and
they
and
I
may
live
in
harmony
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
Prince
Andrew
decided
to
go
to
Petersburg
that
autumn
*NL*
and
found
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
this
decision
.
A
whole
series
of
*NL*
sensible
and
logical
considerations
showing
it
to
be
essential
for
him
*NL*
to
go
to
Petersburg
,
and
even
to
re-enter
the
service
,
kept
springing
up
*NL*
in
his
mind
.
He
could
not
now
understand
how
he
could
ever
even
have
*NL*
doubted
the
necessity
of
taking
an
active
share
in
life
,
just
as
a
month
*NL*
before
he
had
not
understood
how
the
idea
of
leaving
the
quiet
country
*NL*
could
ever
enter
his
head
.
It
now
seemed
clear
to
him
that
all
his
*NL*
experience
of
life
must
be
senselessly
wasted
unless
he
applied
it
to
*NL*
some
kind
of
work
and
again
played
an
active
part
in
life
.
He
did
not
*NL*
even
remember
how
formerly
,
on
the
strength
of
similar
wretched
logical
*NL*
arguments
,
it
had
seemed
obvious
that
he
would
be
degrading
himself
if
*NL*
he
now
,
after
the
lessons
he
had
had
in
life
,
allowed
himself
to
believe
*NL*
in
the
possibility
of
being
useful
and
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
*NL*
or
love
.
Now
reason
suggested
quite
the
opposite
.
After
that
journey
to
*NL*
Ryazan
he
found
the
country
dull
;
his
former
pursuits
no
longer
*NL*
interested
him
,
and
often
when
sitting
alone
in
his
study
he
got
up
,
*NL*
went
to
the
mirror
,
and
gazed
a
long
time
at
his
own
face
.
Then
he
would
*NL*
turn
away
to
the
portrait
of
his
dead
Lise
,
who
with
hair
curled
a
la
*NL*
grecque
looked
tenderly
and
gaily
at
him
out
of
the
gilt
frame
.
She
did
*NL*
not
now
say
those
former
terrible
words
to
him
,
but
looked
simply
,
*NL*
merrily
,
and
inquisitively
at
him
.
And
Prince
Andrew
,
crossing
his
arms
*NL*
behind
him
,
long
paced
the
room
,
now
frowning
,
now
smiling
,
as
he
*NL*
reflected
on
those
irrational
,
inexpressible
thoughts
,
secret
as
a
*NL*
crime
,
which
altered
his
whole
life
and
were
connected
with
Pierre
,
with
*NL*
fame
,
with
the
girl
at
the
window
,
the
oak
,
and
woman
's
beauty
and
love
.
*NL*
And
if
anyone
came
into
his
room
at
such
moments
he
was
particularly
*NL*
cold
,
stern
,
and
above
all
unpleasantly
logical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
Princess
Mary
entering
at
such
a
moment
would
say
,
``
little
*NL*
Nicholas
ca
n't
go
out
today
,
it
's
very
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
hot
,
''
Prince
Andrew
would
reply
at
such
times
very
dryly
to
*NL*
his
sister
,
``
he
could
go
out
in
his
smock
,
but
as
it
is
cold
he
must
*NL*
wear
warm
clothes
,
which
were
designed
for
that
purpose
.
That
is
what
*NL*
follows
from
the
fact
that
it
is
cold
;
and
not
that
a
child
who
needs
*NL*
fresh
air
should
remain
at
home
,
''
he
would
add
with
extreme
logic
,
as
if
*NL*
punishing
someone
for
those
secret
illogical
emotions
that
stirred
*NL*
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
such
moments
Princess
Mary
would
think
how
intellectual
work
dries
*NL*
men
up
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
arrived
in
Petersburg
in
August
,
1809
.
It
was
the
time
*NL*
when
the
youthful
Speranski
was
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
and
his
*NL*
reforms
were
being
pushed
forward
with
the
greatest
energy
.
That
same
*NL*
August
the
Emperor
was
thrown
from
his
caleche
,
injured
his
leg
,
and
*NL*
remained
three
weeks
at
Peterhof
,
receiving
Speranski
every
day
and
no
*NL*
one
else
.
At
that
time
the
two
famous
decrees
were
being
prepared
that
*NL*
so
agitated
society
--
abolishing
court
ranks
and
introducing
examinations
*NL*
to
qualify
for
the
grades
of
Collegiate
Assessor
and
State
Councilor
--
*NL*
and
not
merely
these
but
a
whole
state
constitution
,
intended
to
change
*NL*
the
existing
order
of
government
in
Russia
:
legal
,
administrative
,
and
*NL*
financial
,
from
the
Council
of
State
down
to
the
district
tribunals
.
Now
*NL*
those
vague
liberal
dreams
with
which
the
Emperor
Alexander
had
ascended
*NL*
the
throne
,
and
which
he
had
tried
to
put
into
effect
with
the
aid
of
*NL*
his
associates
,
Czartoryski
,
Novosiltsev
,
Kochubey
,
and
Strogonov
--
whom
*NL*
he
himself
in
jest
had
called
his
Comite
de
salut
public
--
were
taking
*NL*
shape
and
being
realized
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
all
these
men
were
replaced
by
Speranski
on
the
civil
side
,
and
*NL*
Arakcheev
on
the
military
.
Soon
after
his
arrival
Prince
Andrew
,
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
chamber
,
presented
himself
at
court
and
at
a
levee
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
,
though
he
met
him
twice
,
did
not
favor
him
with
a
single
word
.
*NL*
It
had
always
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew
before
that
he
was
antipathetic
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
and
that
the
latter
disliked
his
face
and
personality
*NL*
generally
,
and
in
the
cold
,
repellent
glance
the
Emperor
gave
him
,
he
*NL*
now
found
further
confirmation
of
this
surmise
.
The
courtiers
explained
*NL*
the
Emperor
's
neglect
of
him
by
His
Majesty
's
displeasure
at
Bolkonski
's
*NL*
not
having
served
since
1805
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
myself
that
one
can
not
help
one
's
sympathies
and
antipathies
,
''
*NL*
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
``
so
it
will
not
do
to
present
my
proposal
for
the
*NL*
reform
of
the
army
regulations
to
the
Emperor
personally
,
but
the
*NL*
project
will
speak
for
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
mentioned
what
he
had
written
to
an
old
field
marshal
,
a
friend
of
*NL*
his
father
's
.
The
field
marshal
made
an
appointment
to
see
him
,
received
*NL*
him
graciously
,
and
promised
to
inform
the
Emperor
.
A
few
days
later
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
received
notice
that
he
was
to
go
to
see
the
Minister
of
*NL*
War
,
Count
Arakcheev
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
appointed
day
Prince
Andrew
entered
Count
Arakcheev
's
waiting
*NL*
room
at
nine
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
Arakcheev
personally
,
had
never
seen
him
,
and
all
he
had
*NL*
heard
of
him
inspired
him
with
but
little
respect
for
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
Minister
of
War
,
a
man
trusted
by
the
Emperor
,
and
I
need
not
*NL*
concern
myself
about
his
personal
qualities
:
he
has
been
commissioned
to
*NL*
consider
my
project
,
so
he
alone
can
get
it
adopted
,
''
thought
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
as
he
waited
among
a
number
of
important
and
unimportant
people
*NL*
in
Count
Arakcheev
's
waiting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
service
,
chiefly
as
an
adjutant
,
Prince
Andrew
had
seen
the
*NL*
anterooms
of
many
important
men
,
and
the
different
types
of
such
rooms
*NL*
were
well
known
to
him
.
Count
Arakcheev
's
anteroom
had
quite
a
special
*NL*
character
.
The
faces
of
the
unimportant
people
awaiting
their
turn
for
*NL*
an
audience
showed
embarrassment
and
servility
;
the
faces
of
those
of
*NL*
higher
rank
expressed
a
common
feeling
of
awkwardness
,
covered
by
a
mask
*NL*
of
unconcern
and
ridicule
of
themselves
,
their
situation
,
and
the
person
*NL*
for
whom
they
were
waiting
.
Some
walked
thoughtfully
up
and
down
,
others
*NL*
whispered
and
laughed
.
Prince
Andrew
heard
the
nickname
``
Sila
*NL*
Andreevich
''
and
the
words
,
``
Uncle
will
give
it
to
us
hot
,
''
in
reference
*NL*
to
Count
Arakcheev
.
One
general
-LRB-
an
important
personage
-RRB-
,
evidently
*NL*
feeling
offended
at
having
to
wait
so
long
,
sat
crossing
and
uncrossing
*NL*
his
legs
and
smiling
contemptuously
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
moment
the
door
opened
one
feeling
alone
appeared
on
all
faces
--
*NL*
that
of
fear
.
Prince
Andrew
for
the
second
time
asked
the
adjutant
on
*NL*
duty
to
take
in
his
name
,
but
received
an
ironical
look
and
was
told
*NL*
that
his
turn
would
come
in
due
course
.
After
some
others
had
been
shown
*NL*
in
and
out
of
the
minister
's
room
by
the
adjutant
on
duty
,
an
officer
*NL*
who
struck
Prince
Andrew
by
his
humiliated
and
frightened
air
was
*NL*
admitted
at
that
terrible
door
.
This
officer
's
audience
lasted
a
long
*NL*
time
.
Then
suddenly
the
grating
sound
of
a
harsh
voice
was
heard
from
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
door
,
and
the
officer
--
with
pale
face
and
*NL*
trembling
lips
--
came
out
and
passed
through
the
waiting
room
,
clutching
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
Prince
Andrew
was
conducted
to
the
door
and
the
officer
on
*NL*
duty
said
in
a
whisper
,
``
To
the
right
,
at
the
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
entered
a
plain
tidy
room
and
saw
at
the
table
a
man
of
*NL*
forty
with
a
long
waist
,
a
long
closely
cropped
head
,
deep
wrinkles
,
*NL*
scowling
brows
above
dull
greenish-hazel
eyes
and
an
overhanging
red
*NL*
nose
.
Arakcheev
turned
his
head
toward
him
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
petition
?
''
asked
Arakcheev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
petitioning
,
your
excellency
,
''
returned
Prince
Andrew
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arakcheev
's
eyes
turned
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
said
he
.
``
Prince
Bolkonski
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
petitioning
about
anything
.
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
has
*NL*
deigned
to
send
your
excellency
a
project
submitted
by
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
have
read
your
project
,
''
interrupted
Arakcheev
,
*NL*
uttering
only
the
first
words
amiably
and
then
--
again
without
looking
at
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
--
relapsing
gradually
into
a
tone
of
grumbling
contempt
.
*NL*
``
You
are
proposing
new
military
laws
?
There
are
many
laws
but
no
one
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
old
ones
.
Nowadays
everybody
designs
laws
,
it
is
easier
*NL*
writing
than
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
at
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
's
wish
to
learn
from
your
excellency
*NL*
how
you
propose
to
deal
with
the
memorandum
I
have
presented
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
endorsed
a
resolution
on
your
memorandum
and
sent
it
to
the
*NL*
committee
.
I
do
not
approve
of
it
,
''
said
Arakcheev
,
rising
and
taking
a
*NL*
paper
from
his
writing
table
.
``
Here
!
''
and
he
handed
it
to
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
paper
was
scrawled
in
pencil
,
without
capital
letters
,
*NL*
misspelled
,
and
without
punctuation
:
``
Unsoundly
constructed
because
*NL*
resembles
an
imitation
of
the
French
military
code

from
the
Articles

needlessly
deviating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what

has
the

been
referred

''
inquired
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Committee
on
Army
Regulations

recommended

*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Arakcheev
.
``

Eh

bowing

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
While
waiting
for
the
announcement
of
his
appointment
to
the
committee
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
up
his
former
acquaintances
,
particularly
those
he
*NL*
knew
to
be
in
power
and
whose
aid
he
might
need
.
In
Petersburg
he
now
*NL*
experienced
the
same
feeling
he
had
had
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
,
when
*NL*
troubled
by
anxious
curiosity
and
irresistibly
attracted
to
the
ruling
*NL*
circles
where
the
future
,
on
which
the
fate
of
millions
depended
,
was
*NL*
being
shaped
.
From
the
irritation
of
the
older
men
,
the
curiosity
of
the
*NL*
uninitiated
,
the
reserve
of
the
initiated
,
the
hurry
and
preoccupation
*NL*
of
everyone
,
and
the
innumerable
committees
and
commissions
of
whose
*NL*
existence
he
learned
every
day
,
he
felt
that
now
,
in
1809
,
here
in
*NL*
Petersburg
a
vast
civil
conflict
was
in
preparation
,
the
commander
in
*NL*
chief
of
which
was
a
mysterious
person
he
did
not
know
,
but
who
was
*NL*
supposed
to
be
a
man
of
genius
--
Speranski
.
And
this
movement
of
*NL*
reconstruction
of
which
Prince
Andrew
had
a
vague
idea
,
and
Speranski
*NL*
its
chief
promoter
,
began
to
interest
him
so
keenly
that
the
question
of
*NL*
the
army
regulations
quickly
receded
to
a
secondary
place
in
his
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
most
favorably
placed
to
secure
good
reception
in
the
*NL*
highest
and
most
diverse
Petersburg
circles
of
the
day
.
The
reforming
*NL*
party
cordially
welcomed
and
courted
him
,
in
the
first
place
because
he
*NL*
was
reputed
to
be
clever
and
very
well
read
,
and
secondly
because
by
*NL*
liberating
his
serfs
he
had
obtained
the
reputation
of
being
a
liberal
.
*NL*
The
party
of
the
old
and
dissatisfied
,
who
censured
the
innovations
,
*NL*
turned
to
him
expecting
his
sympathy
in
their
disapproval
of
the
*NL*
reforms
,
simply
because
he
was
the
son
of
his
father
.
The
feminine
*NL*
society
world
welcomed
him
gladly
,
because
he
was
rich
,
distinguished
,
a
*NL*
good
match
,
and
almost
a
newcomer
,
with
a
halo
of
romance
on
account
of
*NL*
his
supposed
death
and
the
tragic
loss
of
his
wife
.
Besides
this
the
*NL*
general
opinion
of
all
who
had
known
him
previously
was
that
he
had
*NL*
greatly
improved
during
these
last
five
years
,
having
softened
and
grown
*NL*
more
manly
,
lost
his
former
affectation
,
pride
,
and
contemptuous
irony
,
*NL*
and
acquired
the
serenity
that
comes
with
years
.
People
talked
about
*NL*
him
,
were
interested
in
him
,
and
wanted
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
interview
with
Count
Arakcheev
,
Prince
Andrew
spent
*NL*
the
evening
at
Count
Kochubey
's
.
He
told
the
count
of
his
interview
with
*NL*
Sila
Andreevich
-LRB-
Kochubey
spoke
of
Arakcheev
by
that
nickname
with
the
*NL*
same
vague
irony
Prince
Andrew
had
noticed
in
the
Minister
of
War
's
*NL*
anteroom
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
cher
,
even
in
this
case
you
ca
n't
do
without
Michael
Mikhaylovich
*NL*
Speranski
.
He
manages
everything
.
I
'll
speak
to
him
.
He
has
promised
to
*NL*
come
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
Speranski
to
do
with
the
army
regulations
?
''
asked
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kochubey
shook
his
head
smilingly
,
as
if
surprised
at
Bolkonski
's
*NL*
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
talking
to
him
about
you
a
few
days
ago
,
''
Kochubey
continued
,
*NL*
``
and
about
your
freed
plowmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
it
you
,
Prince
,
who
have
freed
your
serfs
?
''
said
an
old
man
of
*NL*
Catherine
's
day
,
turning
contemptuously
toward
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
small
estate
that
brought
in
no
profit
,
''
replied
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
trying
to
extenuate
his
action
so
as
not
to
irritate
the
old
man
*NL*
uselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
being
late
...
''
said
the
old
man
,
looking
at
Kochubey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
he
continued
.
``
Who
will
plow
the
*NL*
land
if
they
are
set
free
?
It
is
easy
to
write
laws
,
but
difficult
to
*NL*
rule
...
Just
the
same
as
now
--
I
ask
you
,
Count
--
who
will
be
heads
of
*NL*
the
departments
when
everybody
has
to
pass
examinations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
who
pass
the
examinations
,
I
suppose
,
''
replied
Kochubey
,
crossing
*NL*
his
legs
and
glancing
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
Pryanichnikov
serving
under
me
,
a
splendid
man
,
a
*NL*
priceless
man
,
but
he
's
sixty
.
Is
he
to
go
up
for
examination
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
a
difficulty
,
as
education
is
not
at
all
general
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Kochubey
did
not
finish
.
He
rose
,
took
Prince
Andrew
by
the
arm
,
*NL*
and
went
to
meet
a
tall
,
bald
,
fair
man
of
about
forty
with
a
large
open
*NL*
forehead
and
a
long
face
of
unusual
and
peculiar
whiteness
,
who
was
just
*NL*
entering
.
The
newcomer
wore
a
blue
swallow-tail
coat
with
a
cross
*NL*
suspended
from
his
neck
and
a
star
on
his
left
breast
.
It
was
Speranski
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
recognized
him
at
once
,
and
felt
a
throb
within
him
,
as
*NL*
happens
at
critical
moments
of
life
.
Whether
it
was
from
respect
,
envy
,
*NL*
or
anticipation
,
he
did
not
know
.
Speranski
's
whole
figure
was
of
a
*NL*
peculiar
type
that
made
him
easily
recognizable
.
In
the
society
in
which
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
lived
he
had
never
seen
anyone
who
together
with
awkward
*NL*
and
clumsy
gestures
possessed
such
calmness
and
self-assurance
;
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
so
resolute
yet
gentle
an
expression
as
that
in
those
half
-
*NL*
closed
,
rather
humid
eyes
,
or
so
firm
a
smile
that
expressed
nothing
;
*NL*
nor
had
he
heard
such
a
refined
,
smooth
,
soft
voice
;
above
all
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
such
delicate
whiteness
of
face
or
hands
--
hands
which
were
*NL*
broad
,
but
very
plump
,
soft
,
and
white
.
Such
whiteness
and
softness
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
only
seen
on
the
faces
of
soldiers
who
had
been
long
*NL*
in
hospital
.
This
was
Speranski
,
Secretary
of
State
,
reporter
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
and
his
companion
at
Erfurt
,
where
he
had
more
than
once
met
and
*NL*
talked
with
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speranski
did
not
shift
his
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
as
people
*NL*
involuntarily
do
on
entering
a
large
company
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
*NL*
speak
.
He
spoke
slowly
,
with
assurance
that
he
would
be
listened
to
,
and
*NL*
he
looked
only
at
the
person
with
whom
he
was
conversing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
followed
Speranski
's
every
word
and
movement
with
*NL*
particular
attention
.
As
happens
to
some
people
,
especially
to
men
who
*NL*
judge
those
near
to
them
severely
,
he
always
on
meeting
anyone
new
--
*NL*
especially
anyone
whom
,
like
Speranski
,
he
knew
by
reputation
--
expected
*NL*
to
discover
in
him
the
perfection
of
human
qualities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speranski
told
Kochubey
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
unable
to
come
sooner
*NL*
as
he
had
been
detained
at
the
palace
.
He
did
not
say
that
the
Emperor
*NL*
had
kept
him
,
and
Prince
Andrew
noticed
this
affectation
of
modesty
.
*NL*
When
Kochubey
introduced
Prince
Andrew
,
Speranski
slowly
turned
his
eyes
*NL*
to
Bolkonski
with
his
customary
smile
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
I
had
heard
of
you
,
as
*NL*
everyone
has
,
''
he
said
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kochubey
said
a
few
words
about
the
reception
Arakcheev
had
given
*NL*
Bolkonski
.
Speranski
smiled
more
markedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chairman
of
the
Committee
on
Army
Regulations
is
my
good
friend
*NL*
Monsieur
Magnitski
,
''
he
said
,
fully
articulating
every
word
and
*NL*
syllable
,
``
and
if
you
like
I
can
put
you
in
touch
with
him
.
''
He
paused
*NL*
at
the
full
stop
.
``
I
hope
you
will
find
him
sympathetic
and
ready
to
co
-
*NL*
operate
in
promoting
all
that
is
reasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
circle
soon
formed
round
Speranski
,
and
the
old
man
who
had
talked
*NL*
about
his
subordinate
Pryanichnikov
addressed
a
question
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
without
joining
in
the
conversation
watched
every
movement
*NL*
of
Speranski
's
:
this
man
,
not
long
since
an
insignificant
divinity
*NL*
student
,
who
now
,
Bolkonski
thought
,
held
in
his
hands
--
those
plump
*NL*
white
hands
--
the
fate
of
Russia
.
Prince
Andrew
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
extraordinarily
disdainful
composure
with
which
Speranski
answered
the
*NL*
old
man
.
He
appeared
to
address
condescending
words
to
him
from
an
*NL*
immeasurable
height
.
When
the
old
man
began
to
speak
too
loud
,
Speranski
*NL*
smiled
and
said
he
could
not
judge
of
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
*NL*
what
pleased
the
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
talked
for
a
little
while
in
the
general
circle
,
Speranski
rose
*NL*
and
coming
up
to
Prince
Andrew
took
him
along
to
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
room
.
It
was
clear
that
he
thought
it
necessary
to
interest
himself
in
*NL*
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
chance
to
talk
with
you
,
Prince
,
during
the
animated
*NL*
conversation
in
which
that
venerable
gentleman
involved
me
,
''
he
said
*NL*
with
a
mildly
contemptuous
smile
,
as
if
intimating
by
that
smile
that
he
*NL*
and
Prince
Andrew
understood
the
insignificance
of
the
people
with
whom
*NL*
he
had
just
been
talking
.
This
flattered
Prince
Andrew
.
``
I
have
known
of
*NL*
you
for
a
long
time
:
first
from
your
action
with
regard
to
your
serfs
,
a
*NL*
first
example
,
of
which
it
is
very
desirable
that
there
should
be
more
*NL*
imitators
;
and
secondly
because
you
are
one
of
those
gentlemen
of
the
*NL*
chamber
who
have
not
considered
themselves
offended
by
the
new
decree
*NL*
concerning
the
ranks
allotted
to
courtiers
,
which
is
causing
so
much
*NL*
gossip
and
tittle-tattle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
``
my
father
did
not
wish
me
to
take
advantage
*NL*
of
the
privilege
.
I
began
the
service
from
the
lower
grade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
,
a
man
of
the
last
century
,
evidently
stands
above
our
*NL*
contemporaries
who
so
condemn
this
measure
which
merely
reestablishes
*NL*
natural
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
however
,
that
these
condemnations
have
some
ground
,
''
returned
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
trying
to
resist
Speranski
's
influence
,
of
which
he
began
*NL*
to
be
conscious
.
He
did
not
like
to
agree
with
him
in
everything
and
*NL*
felt
a
wish
to
contradict
.
Though
he
usually
spoke
easily
and
well
,
he
*NL*
felt
a
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
now
while
talking
with
*NL*
Speranski
.
He
was
too
much
absorbed
in
observing
the
famous
man
's
*NL*
personality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grounds
of
personal
ambition
maybe
,
''
Speranski
put
in
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
state
interest
to
some
extent
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
asked
Speranski
quietly
,
lowering
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
an
admirer
of
Montesquieu
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
``
and
his
idea
*NL*
that
le
principe
des
monarchies
est
l'honneur
me
parait
incontestable
.
*NL*
Certains

et
privileges

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

``
The

is
honor
seems
to
me
incontestable

*NL*
Certain

privileges
for
the

appear
to
me
a
means
*NL*
of
maintaining
that
sentiment

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
vanished
from
Speranski
's
white
face
,
which
was
much
improved
*NL*
by
the
change
.
Probably
Prince
Andrew
's
thought
interested
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Si
vous
envisagez
la
question
sous
ce
point
de
vue
,
''
*
he
began
,
*NL*
pronouncing
French
with
evident
difficulty
,
and
speaking
even
slower
*NL*
than
in
Russian
but
quite
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
If
you
regard
the
question
from
that
point
of
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Speranski
went
on
to
say
that
honor
,
l'honneur
,
can
not
be
upheld
by
*NL*
privileges
harmful
to
the
service
;
that
honor
,
l'honneur
,
is
either
a
*NL*
negative
concept
of
not
doing
what
is
blameworthy
or
it
is
a
source
of
*NL*
emulation
in
pursuit
of
commendation
and
rewards
,
which
recognize
it
.
*NL*
His
arguments
were
concise
,
simple
,
and
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
institution
upholding
honor
,
the
source
of
emulation
,
is
one
similar
*NL*
to
the
Legion
d'honneur
of
the
great
Emperor
Napoleon
,
not
harmful
but
*NL*
helpful
to
the
success
of
the
service
,
but
not
a
class
or
court
*NL*
privilege
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
dispute
that
,
but
it
can
not
be
denied
that
court
privileges
*NL*
have
attained
the
same
end
,
''
returned
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Every
courtier
*NL*
considers
himself
bound
to
maintain
his
position
worthily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
do
not
care
to
avail
yourself
of
the
privilege
,
Prince
,
''
said
*NL*
Speranski
,
indicating
by
a
smile
that
he
wished
to
finish
amiably
an
*NL*
argument
which
was
embarrassing
for
his
companion
.
``
If
you
will
do
me
*NL*
the
honor
of
calling
on
me
on
Wednesday
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
will
,
after
*NL*
talking
with
Magnitski
,
let
you
know
what
may
interest
you
,
and
shall
*NL*
also
have
the
pleasure
of
a
more
detailed
chat
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Closing
his
eyes
,
he
bowed
a
la
francaise
,
without
taking
leave
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
,
he
left
the
room

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
weeks
of
his
stay
in
Petersburg
Prince
Andrew
felt
the
*NL*
whole
trend
of
thought
he
had
formed
during
his
life
of
seclusion
quite
*NL*
overshadowed
by
the
trifling
cares
that
engrossed
him
in
that
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
home
in
the
evening
he
would
jot
down
in
his
notebook
four
*NL*
or
five
necessary
calls
or
appointments
for
certain
hours
.
The
mechanism
*NL*
of
life
,
the
arrangement
of
the
day
so
as
to
be
in
time
everywhere
,
*NL*
absorbed
the
greater
part
of
his
vital
energy
.
He
did
nothing
,
did
not
*NL*
even
think
or
find
time
to
think
,
but
only
talked
,
and
talked
*NL*
successfully
,
of
what
he
had
thought
while
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sometimes
noticed
with
dissatisfaction
that
he
repeated
the
same
*NL*
remark
on
the
same
day
in
different
circles
.
But
he
was
so
busy
for
*NL*
whole
days
together
that
he
had
no
time
to
notice
that
he
was
thinking
*NL*
of
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
done
on
their
first
meeting
at
Kochubey
's
,
Speranski
produced
*NL*
a
strong
impression
on
Prince
Andrew
on
the
Wednesday
,
when
he
received
*NL*
him
tete-a-tete
at
his
own
house
and
talked
to
him
long
and
*NL*
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Bolkonski
so
many
people
appeared
contemptible
and
insignificant
*NL*
creatures
,
and
he
so
longed
to
find
in
someone
the
living
ideal
of
that
*NL*
perfection
toward
which
he
strove
,
that
he
readily
believed
that
in
*NL*
Speranski
he
had
found
this
ideal
of
a
perfectly
rational
and
virtuous
*NL*
man
.
Had
Speranski
sprung
from
the
same
class
as
himself
and
possessed
*NL*
the
same
breeding
and
traditions
,
Bolkonski
would
soon
have
discovered
*NL*
his
weak
,
human
,
unheroic
sides
;
but
as
it
was
,
Speranski
's
strange
and
*NL*
logical
turn
of
mind
inspired
him
with
respect
all
the
more
because
he
*NL*
did
not
quite
understand
him
.
Moreover
,
Speranski
,
either
because
he
*NL*
appreciated
the
other
's
capacity
or
because
he
considered
it
necessary
*NL*
to
win
him
to
his
side
,
showed
off
his
dispassionate
calm
reasonableness
*NL*
before
Prince
Andrew
and
flattered
him
with
that
subtle
flattery
which
*NL*
goes
hand
in
hand
with
self-assurance
and
consists
in
a
tacit
assumption
*NL*
that
one
's
companion
is
the
only
man
besides
oneself
capable
of
*NL*
understanding
the
folly
of
the
rest
of
mankind
and
the
reasonableness
*NL*
and
profundity
of
one
's
own
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
their
long
conversation
on
Wednesday
evening
,
Speranski
more
than
*NL*
once
remarked
:
``
We
regard
everything
that
is
above
the
common
level
of
*NL*
rooted
custom
...
''
or
,
with
a
smile
:
``
But
we
want
the
wolves
to
be
fed
*NL*
and
the
sheep
to
be
safe
...
''
or
:
``
They
can
not
understand
this
...
''
and
*NL*
all
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
say
:
``
We
,
you
and
I
,
understand
what
they
*NL*
are
and
who
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
long
conversation
with
Speranski
only
strengthened
in
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
the
feeling
he
had
experienced
toward
him
at
their
first
meeting
.
*NL*
He
saw
in
him
a
remarkable
,
clear-thinking
man
of
vast
intellect
who
by
*NL*
his
energy
and
persistence
had
attained
power
,
which
he
was
using
solely
*NL*
for
the
welfare
of
Russia
.
In
Prince
Andrew
's
eyes
Speranski
was
the
man
*NL*
he
would
himself
have
wished
to
be
--
one
who
explained
all
the
facts
of
*NL*
life
reasonably
,
considered
important
only
what
was
rational
,
and
was
*NL*
capable
of
applying
the
standard
of
reason
to
everything
.
Everything
*NL*
seemed
so
simple
and
clear
in
Speranski
's
exposition
that
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
involuntarily
agreed
with
him
about
everything
.
If
he
replied
and
*NL*
argued
,
it
was
only
because
he
wished
to
maintain
his
independence
and
*NL*
not
submit
to
Speranski
's
opinions
entirely
.
Everything
was
right
and
*NL*
everything
was
as
it
should
be
:
only
one
thing
disconcerted
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
This
was
Speranski
's
cold
,
mirrorlike
look
,
which
did
not
allow
*NL*
one
to
penetrate
to
his
soul
,
and
his
delicate
white
hands
,
which
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
involuntarily
watched
as
one
does
watch
the
hands
of
those
who
*NL*
possess
power
.
This
mirrorlike
gaze
and
those
delicate
hands
irritated
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
he
knew
not
why
.
He
was
unpleasantly
struck
,
too
,
by
the
*NL*
excessive
contempt
for
others
that
he
observed
in
Speranski
,
and
by
the
*NL*
diversity
of
lines
of
argument
he
used
to
support
his
opinions
.
He
made
*NL*
use
of
every
kind
of
mental
device
,
except
analogy
,
and
passed
too
*NL*
boldly
,
it
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew
,
from
one
to
another
.
Now
he
would
*NL*
take
up
the
position
of
a
practical
man
and
condemn
dreamers
;
now
that
*NL*
of
a
satirist
,
and
laugh
ironically
at
his
opponents
;
now
grow
severely
*NL*
logical
,
or
suddenly
rise
to
the
realm
of
metaphysics
.
-LRB-
This
last
*NL*
resource
was
one
he
very
frequently
employed
.
-RRB-
He
would
transfer
a
*NL*
question
to
metaphysical
heights
,
pass
on
to
definitions
of
space
,
time
,
*NL*
and
thought
,
and
,
having
deduced
the
refutation
he
needed
,
would
again
*NL*
descend
to
the
level
of
the
original
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
general
the
trait
of
Speranski
's
mentality
which
struck
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
most
was
his
absolute
and
unshakable
belief
in
the
power
and
authority
*NL*
of
reason
.
It
was
evident
that
the
thought
could
never
occur
to
him
*NL*
which
to
Prince
Andrew
seemed
so
natural
,
namely
,
that
it
is
after
all
*NL*
impossible
to
express
all
one
thinks
;
and
that
he
had
never
felt
the
*NL*
doubt
,
``
Is
not
all
I
think
and
believe
nonsense
?
''
And
it
was
just
this
*NL*
peculiarity
of
Speranski
's
mind
that
particularly
attracted
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
period
of
their
acquaintance
Bolkonski
felt
a
*NL*
passionate
admiration
for
him
similar
to
that
which
he
had
once
felt
for
*NL*
Bonaparte
.
The
fact
that
Speranski
was
the
son
of
a
village
priest
,
and
*NL*
that
stupid
people
might
meanly
despise
him
on
account
of
his
humble
*NL*
origin
-LRB-
as
in
fact
many
did
-RRB-
,
caused
Prince
Andrew
to
cherish
his
*NL*
sentiment
for
him
the
more
,
and
unconsciously
to
strengthen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
first
evening
Bolkonski
spent
with
him
,
having
mentioned
the
*NL*
Commission
for
the
Revision
of
the
Code
of
Laws
,
Speranski
told
him
*NL*
sarcastically
that
the
Commission
had
existed
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
years
,
had
cost
millions
,
and
had
done
nothing
except
that
Rosenkampf
*NL*
had
stuck
labels
on
the
corresponding
paragraphs
of
the
different
codes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
all
the
state
has
for
the
millions
it
has
spent
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
We
want
to
give
the
Senate
new
juridical
powers
,
but
we
have
no
laws
.
*NL*
That
is
why
it
is
a
sin
for
men
like
you
,
Prince
,
not
to
serve
in
these
*NL*
times
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
said
that
for
that
work
an
education
in
jurisprudence
was
*NL*
needed
which
he
did
not
possess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
nobody
possesses
it
,
so
what
would
you
have
?
It
is
a
vicious
circle
*NL*
from
which
we
must
break
a
way
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
Prince
Andrew
was
a
member
of
the
Committee
on
Army
*NL*
Regulations
and
--
what
he
had
not
at
all
expected
--
was
chairman
of
a
*NL*
section
of
the
committee
for
the
revision
of
the
laws
.
At
Speranski
's
*NL*
request
he
took
the
first
part
of
the
Civil
Code
that
was
being
drawn
up
*NL*
and
,
with
the
aid
of
the
Code
Napoleon
and
the
Institutes
of
Justinian
,
*NL*
he
worked
at
formulating
the
section
on
Personal
Rights
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
two
years
before
this
,
in
1808
,
Pierre
on
returning
to
Petersburg
*NL*
after
visiting
his
estates
had
involuntarily
found
himself
in
a
leading
*NL*
position
among
the
Petersburg
Freemasons
.
He
arranged
dining
and
funeral
*NL*
lodge
meetings
,
enrolled
new
members
,
and
busied
himself
uniting
various
*NL*
lodges
and
acquiring
authentic
charters
.
He
gave
money
for
the
erection
*NL*
of
temples
and
supplemented
as
far
as
he
could
the
collection
of
alms
,
*NL*
in
regard
to
which
the
majority
of
members
were
stingy
and
irregular
.
He
*NL*
supported
almost
singlehanded
a
poorhouse
the
order
had
founded
in
*NL*
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
life
meanwhile
continued
as
before
,
with
the
same
infatuations
and
*NL*
dissipations
.
He
liked
to
dine
and
drink
well
,
and
though
he
considered
*NL*
it
immoral
and
humiliating
could
not
resist
the
temptations
of
the
*NL*
bachelor
circles
in
which
he
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
turmoil
of
his
activities
and
distractions
,
however
,
Pierre
at
*NL*
the
end
of
a
year
began
to
feel
that
the
more
firmly
he
tried
to
rest
*NL*
upon
it
,
the
more
masonic
ground
on
which
he
stood
gave
way
under
him
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
he
felt
that
the
deeper
the
ground
sank
under
him
the
*NL*
closer
bound
he
involuntarily
became
to
the
order
.
When
he
had
joined
*NL*
the
Freemasons
he
had
experienced
the
feeling
of
one
who
confidently
*NL*
steps
onto
the
smooth
surface
of
a
bog
.
When
he
put
his
foot
down
it
*NL*
sank
in
.
To
make
quite
sure
of
the
firmness
of
the
ground
,
he
put
his
*NL*
other
foot
down
and
sank
deeper
still
,
became
stuck
in
it
,
and
*NL*
involuntarily
waded
knee-deep
in
the
bog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
Alexeevich
was
not
in
Petersburg
--
he
had
of
late
stood
aside
from
*NL*
the
affairs
of
the
Petersburg
lodges
,
and
lived
almost
entirely
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
All
the
members
of
the
lodges
were
men
Pierre
knew
in
ordinary
*NL*
life
,
and
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
regard
them
merely
as
Brothers
in
*NL*
Freemasonry
and
not
as
Prince
B.
or
Ivan
Vasilevich
D.
,
whom
he
knew
in
*NL*
society
mostly
as
weak
and
insignificant
men
.
Under
the
masonic
aprons
*NL*
and
insignia
he
saw
the
uniforms
and
decorations
at
which
they
aimed
in
*NL*
ordinary
life
.
Often
after
collecting
alms
,
and
reckoning
up
twenty
to
*NL*
thirty
rubles
received
for
the
most
part
in
promises
from
a
dozen
*NL*
members
,
of
whom
half
were
as
well
able
to
pay
as
himself
,
Pierre
*NL*
remembered
the
masonic
vow
in
which
each
Brother
promised
to
devote
all
*NL*
his
belongings
to
his
neighbor
,
and
doubts
on
which
he
tried
not
to
*NL*
dwell
arose
in
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
divided
the
Brothers
he
knew
into
four
categories
.
In
the
first
he
*NL*
put
those
who
did
not
take
an
active
part
in
the
affairs
of
the
lodges
*NL*
or
in
human
affairs
,
but
were
exclusively
occupied
with
the
mystical
*NL*
science
of
the
order
:
with
questions
of
the
threefold
designation
of
*NL*
God
,
the
three
primordial
elements
--
sulphur
,
mercury
,
and
salt
--
or
the
*NL*
meaning
of
the
square
and
all
the
various
figures
of
the
temple
of
*NL*
Solomon
.
Pierre
respected
this
class
of
Brothers
to
which
the
elder
ones
*NL*
chiefly
belonged
,
including
,
Pierre
thought
,
Joseph
Alexeevich
himself
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
share
their
interests
.
His
heart
was
not
in
the
mystical
*NL*
aspect
of
Freemasonry
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
category
Pierre
reckoned
himself
and
others
like
him
,
*NL*
seeking
and
vacillating
,
who
had
not
yet
found
in
Freemasonry
a
straight
*NL*
and
comprehensible
path
,
but
hoped
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
third
category
he
included
those
Brothers
-LRB-
the
majority
-RRB-
who
saw
*NL*
nothing
in
Freemasonry
but
the
external
forms
and
ceremonies
,
and
prized
*NL*
the
strict
performance
of
these
forms
without
troubling
about
their
*NL*
purport
or
significance
.
Such
were
Willarski
and
even
the
Grand
Master
*NL*
of
the
principal
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
to
the
fourth
category
also
a
great
many
Brothers
belonged
,
*NL*
particularly
those
who
had
lately
joined
.
These
according
to
Pierre
's
*NL*
observations
were
men
who
had
no
belief
in
anything
,
nor
desire
for
*NL*
anything
,
but
joined
the
Freemasons
merely
to
associate
with
the
wealthy
*NL*
young
Brothers
who
were
influential
through
their
connections
or
rank
,
*NL*
and
of
whom
there
were
very
many
in
the
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
began
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
what
he
was
doing
.
Freemasonry
,
*NL*
at
any
rate
as
he
saw
it
here
,
sometimes
seemed
to
him
based
merely
on
*NL*
externals
.
He
did
not
think
of
doubting
Freemasonry
itself
,
but
*NL*
suspected
that
Russian
Masonry
had
taken
a
wrong
path
and
deviated
from
*NL*
its
original
principles
.
And
so
toward
the
end
of
the
year
he
went
*NL*
abroad
to
be
initiated
into
the
higher
secrets
of
the
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
summer
of
1809
Pierre
returned
to
Petersburg
.
Our
Freemasons
knew
*NL*
from
correspondence
with
those
abroad
that
Bezukhov
had
obtained
the
*NL*
confidence
of
many
highly
placed
persons
,
had
been
initiated
into
many
*NL*
mysteries
,
had
been
raised
to
a
higher
grade
,
and
was
bringing
back
with
*NL*
him
much
that
might
conduce
to
the
advantage
of
the
masonic
cause
in
*NL*
Russia
.
The
Petersburg
Freemasons
all
came
to
see
him
,
tried
to
*NL*
ingratiate
themselves
with
him
,
and
it
seemed
to
them
all
that
he
was
*NL*
preparing
something
for
them
and
concealing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
of
the
second
degree
was
convened
,
at
*NL*
which
Pierre
promised
to
communicate
to
the
Petersburg
Brothers
what
he
*NL*
had
to
deliver
to
them
from
the
highest
leaders
of
their
order
.
The
*NL*
meeting
was
a
full
one
.
After
the
usual
ceremonies
Pierre
rose
and
began
*NL*
his
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Brothers
,
''
he
began
,
blushing
and
stammering
,
with
a
written
*NL*
speech
in
his
hand
,
``
it
is
not
sufficient
to
observe
our
mysteries
in
*NL*
the
seclusion
of
our
lodge
--
we
must
act
--
act
!
We
are
drowsing
,
but
we
*NL*
must
act
.
''
Pierre
raised
his
notebook
and
began
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
dissemination
of
pure
truth
and
to
secure
the
triumph
of
*NL*
virtue
,
''
he
read
,
``
we
must
cleanse
men
from
prejudice
,
diffuse
*NL*
principles
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
the
times
,
undertake
the
*NL*
education
of
the
young
,
unite
ourselves
in
indissoluble
bonds
with
the
*NL*
wisest
men
,
boldly
yet
prudently
overcome
superstitions
,
infidelity
,
and
*NL*
folly
,
and
form
of
those
devoted
to
us
a
body
linked
together
by
unity
*NL*
of
purpose
and
possessed
of
authority
and
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
attain
this
end
we
must
secure
a
preponderance
of
virtue
over
vice
*NL*
and
must
endeavor
to
secure
that
the
honest
man
may
,
even
in
this
world
,
*NL*
receive
a
lasting
reward
for
his
virtue
.
But
in
these
great
endeavors
we
*NL*
are
gravely
hampered
by
the
political
institutions
of
today
.
What
is
to
*NL*
be
done
in
these
circumstances
?
To
favor
revolutions
,
overthrow
*NL*
everything
,
repel
force
by
force
?
...
No
!
We
are
very
far
from
that
.
*NL*
Every
violent
reform
deserves
censure
,
for
it
quite
fails
to
remedy
evil
*NL*
while
men
remain
what
they
are
,
and
also
because
wisdom
needs
no
*NL*
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
plan
of
our
order
should
be
based
on
the
idea
of
preparing
*NL*
men
of
firmness
and
virtue
bound
together
by
unity
of
conviction
--
aiming
*NL*
at
the
punishment
of
vice
and
folly
,
and
patronizing
talent
and
virtue
:
*NL*
raising
worthy
men
from
the
dust
and
attaching
them
to
our
Brotherhood
.
*NL*
Only
then
will
our
order
have
the
power
unobtrusively
to
bind
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
protectors
of
disorder
and
to
control
them
without
their
being
*NL*
aware
of
it
.
In
a
word
,
we
must
found
a
form
of
government
holding
*NL*
universal
sway
,
which
should
be
diffused
over
the
whole
world
without
*NL*
destroying
the
bonds
of
citizenship
,
and
beside
which
all
other
*NL*
governments
can
continue
in
their
customary
course
and
do
everything
*NL*
except
what
impedes
the
great
aim
of
our
order
,
which
is
to
obtain
for
*NL*
virtue
the
victory
over
vice
.
This
aim
was
that
of
Christianity
itself
.
*NL*
It
taught
men
to
be
wise
and
good
and
for
their
own
benefit
to
follow
*NL*
the
example
and
instruction
of
the
best
and
wisest
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
time
,
when
everything
was
plunged
in
darkness
,
preaching
alone
*NL*
was
of
course
sufficient
.
The
novelty
of
Truth
endowed
her
with
special
*NL*
strength
,
but
now
we
need
much
more
powerful
methods
.
It
is
now
*NL*
necessary
that
man
,
governed
by
his
senses
,
should
find
in
virtue
a
*NL*
charm
palpable
to
those
senses
.
It
is
impossible
to
eradicate
the
*NL*
passions
;
but
we
must
strive
to
direct
them
to
a
noble
aim
,
and
it
is
*NL*
therefore
necessary
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
satisfy
his
passions
*NL*
within
the
limits
of
virtue
.
Our
order
should
provide
means
to
that
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
we
have
a
certain
number
of
worthy
men
in
every
state
,
each
*NL*
of
them
again
training
two
others
and
all
being
closely
united
,
*NL*
everything
will
be
possible
for
our
order
,
which
has
already
in
secret
*NL*
accomplished
much
for
the
welfare
of
mankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
not
only
made
a
strong
impression
,
but
created
excitement
in
*NL*
the
lodge
.
The
majority
of
the
Brothers
,
seeing
in
it
dangerous
designs
*NL*
of
Illuminism
,
*
met
it
with
a
coldness
that
surprised
Pierre
.
The
Grand
*NL*
Master
began
answering
him
,
and
Pierre
began
developing
his
views
with
*NL*
more
and
more
warmth
.
It
was
long
since
there
had
been
so
stormy
a
*NL*
meeting
.
Parties
were
formed
,
some
accusing
Pierre
of
Illuminism
,
others
*NL*
supporting
him
.
At
that
meeting
he
was
struck
for
the
first
time
by
the
*NL*
endless
variety
of
men
's
minds
,
which
prevents
a
truth
from
ever
*NL*
presenting
itself
identically
to
two
persons
.
Even
those
members
who
*NL*
seemed
to
be
on
his
side
understood
him
in
their
own
way
with
*NL*
limitations
and
alterations
he
could
not
agree
to
,
as
what
he
always
*NL*
wanted
most
was
to
convey
his
thought
to
others
just
as
he
himself
*NL*
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
Illuminati
sought
to
substitute
republican
for
monarchical
*NL*
institutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
meeting
the
Grand
Master
with
irony
and
ill-will
*NL*
reproved
Bezukhov
for
his
vehemence
and
said
it
was
not
love
of
virtue
*NL*
alone
,
but
also
a
love
of
strife
that
had
moved
him
in
the
dispute
.
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
answer
him
and
asked
briefly
whether
his
proposal
would
*NL*
be
accepted
.
He
was
told
that
it
would
not
,
and
without
waiting
for
the
*NL*
usual
formalities
he
left
the
lodge
and
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Pierre
was
overtaken
by
the
depression
he
so
dreaded
.
For
three
*NL*
days
after
the
delivery
of
his
speech
at
the
lodge
he
lay
on
a
sofa
at
*NL*
home
receiving
no
one
and
going
nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
then
that
he
received
a
letter
from
his
wife
,
who
implored
*NL*
him
to
see
her
,
telling
him
how
grieved
she
was
about
him
and
how
she
*NL*
wished
to
devote
her
whole
life
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
letter
she
informed
him
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
*NL*
return
to
Petersburg
from
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
this
letter
one
of
the
masonic
Brothers
whom
Pierre
respected
*NL*
less
than
the
others
forced
his
way
in
to
see
him
and
,
turning
the
*NL*
conversation
upon
Pierre
's
matrimonial
affairs
,
by
way
of
fraternal
*NL*
advice
expressed
the
opinion
that
his
severity
to
his
wife
was
wrong
and
*NL*
that
he
was
neglecting
one
of
the
first
rules
of
Freemasonry
by
not
*NL*
forgiving
the
penitent
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
his
mother-in-law
,
Prince
Vasili
's
wife
,
sent
to
him
*NL*
imploring
him
to
come
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
a
most
*NL*
important
matter
.
Pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
against
him
and
*NL*
that
they
wanted
to
reunite
him
with
his
wife
,
and
in
the
mood
he
then
*NL*
was
,
this
was
not
even
unpleasant
to
him
.
Nothing
mattered
to
him
.
*NL*
Nothing
in
life
seemed
to
him
of
much
importance
,
and
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
depression
that
possessed
him
he
valued
neither
his
*NL*
liberty
nor
his
resolution
to
punish
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
is
right
and
no
one
is
to
blame
;
so
she
too
is
not
to
blame
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
did
not
at
once
give
his
consent
to
a
reunion
with
his
wife
,
it
*NL*
was
only
because
in
his
state
of
depression
he
did
not
feel
able
to
take
*NL*
any
step
.
Had
his
wife
come
to
him
,
he
would
not
have
turned
her
away
.
*NL*
Compared
to
what
preoccupied
him
,
was
it
not
a
matter
of
indifference
*NL*
whether
he
lived
with
his
wife
or
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
Without
replying
either
to
his
wife
or
his
mother-in-law
,
Pierre
late
*NL*
one
night
prepared
for
a
journey
and
started
for
Moscow
to
see
Joseph
*NL*
Alexeevich
.
This
is
what
he
noted
in
his
diary
:
*NL*
*NL*
Moscow
,
17th
November
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
just
returned
from
my
benefactor
,
and
hasten
to
write
down
what
I
*NL*
have
experienced
.
Joseph
Alexeevich
is
living
poorly
and
has
for
three
*NL*
years
been
suffering
from
a
painful
disease
of
the
bladder
.
No
one
has
*NL*
ever
heard
him
utter
a
groan
or
a
word
of
complaint
.
From
morning
till
*NL*
late
at
night
,
except
when
he
eats
his
very
plain
food
,
he
is
working
at
*NL*
science
.
He
received
me
graciously
and
made
me
sit
down
on
the
bed
on
*NL*
which
he
lay
.
I
made
the
sign
of
the
Knights
of
the
East
and
of
*NL*
Jerusalem
,
and
he
responded
in
the
same
manner
,
asking
me
with
a
mild
*NL*
smile
what
I
had
learned
and
gained
in
the
Prussian
and
Scottish
lodges
.
*NL*
I
told
him
everything
as
best
I
could
,
and
told
him
what
I
had
proposed
*NL*
to
our
Petersburg
lodge
,
of
the
bad
reception
I
had
encountered
,
and
of
*NL*
my
rupture
with
the
Brothers
.
Joseph
Alexeevich
,
having
remained
silent
*NL*
and
thoughtful
for
a
good
while
,
told
me
his
view
of
the
matter
,
which
*NL*
at
once
lit
up
for
me
my
whole
past
and
the
future
path
I
should
follow
.
*NL*
He
surprised
me
by
asking
whether
I
remembered
the
threefold
aim
of
the
*NL*
order
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
The
preservation
and
study
of
the
mystery
.
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
The
*NL*
purification
and
reformation
of
oneself
for
its
reception
,
and
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
The
*NL*
improvement
of
the
human
race
by
striving
for
such
purification
.
Which
*NL*
is
the
principal
aim
of
these
three
?
Certainly
self-reformation
and
*NL*
self-purification
.
Only
to
this
aim
can
we
always
strive
independently
*NL*
of
circumstances
.
But
at
the
same
time
just
this
aim
demands
the
*NL*
greatest
efforts
of
us
;
and
so
,
led
astray
by
pride
,
losing
sight
of
*NL*
this
aim
,
we
occupy
ourselves
either
with
the
mystery
which
in
our
*NL*
impurity
we
are
unworthy
to
receive
,
or
seek
the
reformation
of
the
*NL*
human
race
while
ourselves
setting
an
example
of
baseness
and
*NL*
profligacy
.
Illuminism
is
not
a
pure
doctrine
,
just
because
it
is
*NL*
attracted
by
social
activity
and
puffed
up
by
pride
.
On
this
ground
*NL*
Joseph
Alexeevich
condemned
my
speech
and
my
whole
activity
,
and
in
the
*NL*
depth
of
my
soul
I
agreed
with
him
.
Talking
of
my
family
affairs
he
said
*NL*
to
me
,
``
the
chief
duty
of
a
true
Mason
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
lies
in
*NL*
perfecting
himself
.
We
often
think
that
by
removing
all
the
difficulties
*NL*
of
our
life
we
shall
more
quickly
reach
our
aim
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
my
*NL*
dear
sir
,
it
is
only
in
the
midst
of
worldly
cares
that
we
can
attain
*NL*
our
three
chief
aims
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
Self-knowledge
--
for
man
can
only
know
himself
*NL*
by
comparison
,
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
Self-perfecting
,
which
can
only
be
attained
by
*NL*
conflict
,
and
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
The
attainment
of
the
chief
virtue
--
love
of
death
.
*NL*
Only
the
vicissitudes
of
life
can
show
us
its
vanity
and
develop
our
*NL*
innate
love
of
death
or
of
rebirth
to
a
new
life
.
''
These
words
are
all
*NL*
the
more
remarkable
because
,
in
spite
of
his
great
physical
sufferings
,
*NL*
Joseph
Alexeevich
is
never
weary
of
life
though
he
loves
death
,
for
*NL*
which
--
in
spite
of
the
purity
and
loftiness
of
his
inner
man
--
he
does
*NL*
not
yet
feel
himself
sufficiently
prepared
.
My
benefactor
then
explained
*NL*
to
me
fully
the
meaning
of
the
Great
Square
of
creation
and
pointed
out
*NL*
to
me
that
the
numbers
three
and
seven
are
the
basis
of
everything
.
He
*NL*
advised
me
not
to
avoid
intercourse
with
the
Petersburg
Brothers
,
but
to
*NL*
take
up
only
second-grade
posts
in
the
lodge
,
to
try
,
while
diverting
*NL*
the
Brothers
from
pride
,
to
turn
them
toward
the
true
path
self
-
*NL*
knowledge
and
self-perfecting
.
Besides
this
he
advised
me
for
myself
*NL*
personally
above
all
to
keep
a
watch
over
myself
,
and
to
that
end
he
*NL*
gave
me
a
notebook
,
the
one
I
am
now
writing
in
and
in
which
I
will
in
*NL*
future
note
down
all
my
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petersburg
,
23rd
November
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
again
living
with
my
wife
.
My
mother-in-law
came
to
me
in
tears
and
*NL*
said
that
Helene
was
here
and
that
she
implored
me
to
hear
her
;
that
she
*NL*
was
innocent
and
unhappy
at
my
desertion
,
and
much
more
.
I
knew
that
if
*NL*
I
once
let
myself
see
her
I
should
not
have
strength
to
go
on
refusing
*NL*
what
she
wanted
.
In
my
perplexity
I
did
not
know
whose
aid
and
advice
to
*NL*
seek
.
Had
my
benefactor
been
here
he
would
have
told
me
what
to
do
.
I
*NL*
went
to
my
room
and
reread
Joseph
Alexeevich
's
letters
and
recalled
my
*NL*
conversations
with
him
,
and
deduced
from
it
all
that
I
ought
not
to
*NL*
refuse
a
supplicant
,
and
ought
to
reach
a
helping
hand
to
everyone
--
*NL*
especially
to
one
so
closely
bound
to
me
--
and
that
I
must
bear
my
cross
.
*NL*
But
if
I
forgive
her
for
the
sake
of
doing
right
,
then
let
union
with
*NL*
her
have
only
a
spiritual
aim
.
That
is
what
I
decided
,
and
what
I
wrote
*NL*
to
Joseph
Alexeevich
.
I
told
my
wife
that
I
begged
her
to
forget
the
*NL*
past
,
to
forgive
me
whatever
wrong
I
may
have
done
her
,
and
that
I
had
*NL*
nothing
to
forgive
.
It
gave
me
joy
to
tell
her
this
.
She
need
not
know
*NL*
how
hard
it
was
for
me
to
see
her
again
.
I
have
settled
on
the
upper
*NL*
floor
of
this
big
house
and
am
experiencing
a
happy
feeling
of
*NL*
regeneration
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
as
always
happens
,
the
highest
society
that
met
at
court
*NL*
and
at
the
grand
balls
was
divided
into
several
circles
,
each
with
its
*NL*
own
particular
tone
.
The
largest
of
these
was
the
French
circle
of
the
*NL*
Napoleonic
alliance
,
the
circle
of
Count
Rumyantsev
and
Caulaincourt
.
In
*NL*
this
group
Helene
,
as
soon
as
she
had
settled
in
Petersburg
with
her
*NL*
husband
,
took
a
very
prominent
place
.
She
was
visited
by
the
members
of
*NL*
the
French
embassy
and
by
many
belonging
to
that
circle
and
noted
for
*NL*
their
intellect
and
polished
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
had
been
at
Erfurt
during
the
famous
meeting
of
the
Emperors
and
*NL*
had
brought
from
there
these
connections
with
the
Napoleonic
*NL*
notabilities
.
At
Erfurt
her
success
had
been
brilliant
.
Napoleon
himself
*NL*
had
noticed
her
in
the
theater
and
said
of
her
:
``
C'est
un
superbe
*NL*
animal
.
''
*
Her
success
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
woman
did
not
surprise
*NL*
Pierre
,
for
she
had
become
even
handsomer
than
before
.
What
did
surprise
*NL*
him
was
that
during
these
last
two
years
his
wife
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
gaining
the
reputation
``
d'
une
femme
charmante
,
aussi
spirituelle
que
*NL*
belle
.
''
*
-LRB-

-RRB-
The
distinguished
Prince
de
Ligne
wrote
her
eight-page
*NL*
letters
.
Bilibin
saved
up
his
epigrams
to
produce
them
in
Countess
*NL*
Bezukhova
's
presence
.
To
be
received
in
the
Countess
Bezukhova
's
salon
*NL*
was
regarded
as
a
diploma
of
intellect
.
Young
men
read
books
before
*NL*
attending
Helene
's
evenings
,
to
have
something
to
say
in
her
salon
,
and
*NL*
secretaries
of
the
embassy
,
and
even
ambassadors
,
confided
diplomatic
*NL*
secrets
to
her
,
so
that
in
a
way
Helene
was
a
power
.
Pierre
,
who
knew
*NL*
she
was
very
stupid
,
sometimes
attended
,
with
a
strange
feeling
of
*NL*
perplexity
and
fear
,
her
evenings
and
dinner
parties
,
where
politics
,
*NL*
poetry
,
and
philosophy
were
discussed
.
At
these
parties
his
feelings
*NL*
were
like
those
of
a
conjuror
who
always
expects
his
trick
to
be
found
*NL*
out
at
any
moment
.
But
whether
because
stupidity
was
just
what
was
*NL*
needed
to
run
such
a
salon
,
or
because
those
who
were
deceived
found
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
deception
,
at
any
rate
it
remained
unexposed
and
Helene
*NL*
Bezukhova
's
reputation
as
a
lovely
and
clever
woman
became
so
firmly
*NL*
established
that
she
could
say
the
emptiest
and
stupidest
things
and
*NL*
everybody
would
go
into
raptures
over
every
word
of
hers
and
look
for
a
*NL*
profound
meaning
in
it
of
which
she
herself
had
no
conception
.

Of

''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
just
the
husband
needed
for
a
brilliant
society
woman
.
He
was
*NL*
that
absent-minded
crank
,
a
grand
seigneur
husband
who
was
in
no
one
's
*NL*
way
,
and
far
from
spoiling
the
high
tone
and
general
impression
of
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
he
served
,
by
the
contrast
he
presented
to
her
,
as
an
*NL*
advantageous
background
to
his
elegant
and
tactful
wife
.
Pierre
during
*NL*
the
last
two
years
,
as
a
result
of
his
continual
absorption
in
abstract
*NL*
interests
and
his
sincere
contempt
for
all
else
,
had
acquired
in
his
*NL*
wife
's
circle
,
which
did
not
interest
him
,
that
air
of
unconcern
,
*NL*
indifference
,
and
benevolence
toward
all
,
which
can
not
be
acquired
*NL*
artificially
and
therefore
inspires
involuntary
respect
.
He
entered
his
*NL*
wife
's
drawing
room
as
one
enters
a
theater
,
was
acquainted
with
*NL*
everybody
,
equally
pleased
to
see
everyone
,
and
equally
indifferent
to
*NL*
them
all
.
Sometimes
he
joined
in
a
conversation
which
interested
him
*NL*
and
,
regardless
of
whether
any
``
gentlemen
of
the
embassy
''
were
present
*NL*
or
not
,
lispingly
expressed
his
views
,
which
were
sometimes
not
at
all
*NL*
in
accord
with
the
accepted
tone
of
the
moment
.
But
the
general
opinion
*NL*
concerning
the
queer
husband
of
``
the
most
distinguished
woman
in
*NL*
Petersburg
''
was
so
well
established
that
no
one
took
his
freaks
*NL*
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
many
young
men
who
frequented
her
house
every
day
,
Boris
*NL*
Drubetskoy
,
who
had
already
achieved
great
success
in
the
service
,
was
*NL*
the
most
intimate
friend
of
the
Bezukhov
household
since
Helene
's
return
*NL*
from
Erfurt
.
Helene
spoke
of
him
as
``
mon
page
''
and
treated
him
like
a
*NL*
child
.
Her
smile
for
him
was
the
same
as
for
everybody
,
but
sometimes
*NL*
that
smile
made
Pierre
uncomfortable
.
Toward
him
Boris
behaved
with
a
*NL*
particularly
dignified
and
sad
deference
.
This
shade
of
deference
also
*NL*
disturbed
Pierre
.
He
had
suffered
so
painfully
three
years
before
from
*NL*
the
mortification
to
which
his
wife
had
subjected
him
that
he
now
*NL*
protected
himself
from
the
danger
of
its
repetition
,
first
by
not
being
*NL*
a
husband
to
his
wife
,
and
secondly
by
not
allowing
himself
to
suspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
now
that
she
has
become
a
bluestocking
she
has
finally
renounced
*NL*
her
former
infatuations
,
''
he
told
himself
.
``
There
has
never
been
an
*NL*
instance
of
a
bluestocking
being
carried
away
by
affairs
of
the
heart
''
--
*NL*
a
statement
which
,
though
gathered
from
an
unknown
source
,
he
believed
*NL*
implicitly
.
Yet
strange
to
say
Boris
'
presence
in
his
wife
's
drawing
*NL*
room
-LRB-
and
he
was
almost
always
there
-RRB-
had
a
physical
effect
upon
Pierre
;
*NL*
it
constricted
his
limbs
and
destroyed
the
unconsciousness
and
freedom
*NL*
of
his
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strange
antipathy
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
``
yet
I
used
to
like
him
very
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
eyes
of
the
world
Pierre
was
a
great
gentleman
,
the
rather
blind
*NL*
and
absurd
husband
of
a
distinguished
wife
,
a
clever
crank
who
did
*NL*
nothing
but
harmed
nobody
and
was
a
first-rate
,
good-natured
fellow
.
But
*NL*
a
complex
and
difficult
process
of
internal
development
was
taking
place
*NL*
all
this
time
in
Pierre
's
soul
,
revealing
much
to
him
and
causing
him
*NL*
many
spiritual
doubts
and
joys
.

went

By

Alexeevich
's
advice
Pierre
had
entered
the
service
of
the
state
and
*NL*
served
on
one
of
the
committees
.
-RRB-
Returned
home
for
dinner
and
dined
*NL*
alone
--
the
countess
had
many
visitors
I
do
not
like
.
I
ate
and
drank
*NL*
moderately
and
after
dinner
copied
out
some
passages
for
the
Brothers
.
*NL*
In
the
evening
I
went
down
to
the
countess
and
told
a
funny
story
about
*NL*
B.
,
and
only
remembered
that
I
ought
not
to
have
done
so
when
everybody
*NL*
laughed
loudly
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
going
to
bed
with

happy
and
tranquil
mind

Great

help

*NL*
*NL*
27th
November
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
up
late
.
On
waking
I
lay
long
in
bed
yielding
to
sloth
.
O
God
,
*NL*
help
and
strengthen
me
that
I
may
walk
in
Thy
ways
!
Read
the
Scriptures
,
*NL*
but
without
proper
feeling
.
Brother
Urusov
came
and
we
talked
about
*NL*
worldly
vanities
.
He
told
me
of
the
Emperor
's
new
projects
.
I
began
to
*NL*
criticize
them
,
but
remembered
my
rules
and
my
benefactor
's
words
--
that
*NL*
a
true
Freemason
should
be
a
zealous
worker
for
the
state
when
his
aid
*NL*
is
required
and
a
quiet
onlooker
when
not
called
on
to
assist
.
My
tongue
*NL*
is
my
enemy
.
Brothers
G.
V.
and
O.
visited
me
and
we
had
a
preliminary
*NL*
talk
about
the
reception
of
a
new
Brother
.
They
laid
on
me
the
duty
of
*NL*
Rhetor
.
I
feel
myself
weak
and
unworthy
.
Then
our
talk
turned
to
the
*NL*
interpretation
of
the
seven
pillars
and
steps
of
the
Temple
,
the
seven
*NL*
sciences
,
the
seven
virtues
,
the
seven
vices
,
and
the
seven
gifts
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Spirit
.
Brother
O.
was
very
eloquent
.
In
the
evening
the
admission
*NL*
took
place
.
The
new
decoration
of
the
Premises
contributed
much
to
the
*NL*
magnificence
of
the
spectacle
.
It
was
Boris
Drubetskoy
who
was
admitted
.
*NL*
I
nominated
him
and
was
the
Rhetor
.
A
strange
feeling
agitated
me
all
*NL*
the
time
I
was
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
chamber
.
I
caught
myself
*NL*
harboring
a
feeling
of
hatred
toward
him
which
I
vainly
tried
to
*NL*
overcome
.
That
is
why
I
should
really
like
to
save
him
from
evil
and
*NL*
lead
him
into
the
path
of
truth
,
but
evil
thoughts
of
him
did
not
leave
*NL*
me
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
his
object
in
entering
the
Brotherhood
was
*NL*
merely
to
be
intimate
and
in
favor
with
members
of
our
lodge
.
Apart
from
*NL*
the
fact
that
he
had
asked
me
several
times
whether
N.
and
S.
were
*NL*
members
of
our
lodge
-LRB-
a
question
to
which
I
could
not
reply
-RRB-
and
that
*NL*
according
to
my
observation
he
is
incapable
of
feeling
respect
for
our
*NL*
holy
order
and
is
too
preoccupied
and
satisfied
with
the
outer
man
to
*NL*
desire
spiritual
improvement
,
I
had
no
cause
to
doubt
him
,
but
he
seemed
*NL*
to
me
insincere
,
and
all
the
time
I
stood
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
*NL*
temple
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
smiling
contemptuously
at
my
words
,
*NL*
and
I
wished
really
to
stab
his
bare
breast
with
the
sword
I
held
to
it
.
*NL*
I
could
not
be
eloquent
,
nor
could
I
frankly
mention
my
doubts
to
the
*NL*
Brothers
and
to
the
Grand
Master
.
Great
Architect
of
Nature
,
help
me
to
*NL*
find
the
true
path
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
lies
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
three
pages
were
left
blank
in
the
diary
,
and
then
the
*NL*
following
was
written
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
had
a
long
and
instructive
talk
alone
with
Brother
V.
,
who
*NL*
advised
me
to
hold
fast
by
Brother
A.
Though
I
am
unworthy
,
much
was
*NL*
revealed
to
me
.
Adonai
is
the
name
of
the
creator
of
the
world
.
Elohim
*NL*
is
the
name
of
the
ruler
of
all
.
The
third
name
is
the
name
unutterable
*NL*
which
means
the
All
.
Talks
with
Brother
V.
strengthen
,
refresh
,
and
*NL*
support
me
in
the
path
of
virtue
.
In
his
presence
doubt
has
no
place
.
*NL*
The
distinction
between
the
poor
teachings
of
mundane
science
and
our
*NL*
sacred
all-embracing
teaching
is
clear
to
me
.
Human
sciences
dissect
*NL*
everything
to
comprehend
it
,
and
kill
everything
to
examine
it
.
In
the
*NL*
holy
science
of
our
order
all
is
one
,
all
is
known
in
its
entirety
and
*NL*
life
.
The
Trinity
--
the
three
elements
of
matter
--
are
sulphur
,
mercury
,
*NL*
and
salt
.
Sulphur
is
of
an
oily
and
fiery
nature
;
in
combination
with
*NL*
salt
by
its
fiery
nature
it
arouses
a
desire
in
the
latter
by
means
of
*NL*
which
it
attracts
mercury
,
seizes
it
,
holds
it
,
and
in
combination
*NL*
produces
other
bodies
.
Mercury
is
a
fluid
,
volatile
,
spiritual
essence
.
*NL*
Christ
,
the
Holy
Spirit
,
Him
!

*NL*
3rd
December
*NL*
*NL*
Awoke
late
,
read
the
Scriptures
but
was
apathetic
.
Afterwards
went
and
*NL*
paced
up
and
down
the
large
hall
.
I
wished
to
meditate
,
but
instead
my
*NL*
imagination
pictured
an
occurrence
of
four
years
ago
,
when
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
meeting
me
in
Moscow
after
our
duel
,
said
he
hoped
I
was
enjoying
*NL*
perfect
peace
of
mind
in
spite
of
my
wife
's
absence
.
At
the
time
I
gave
*NL*
him
no
answer
.
Now
I
recalled
every
detail
of
that
meeting
and
in
my
*NL*
mind
gave
him
the
most
malevolent
and
bitter
replies
.
I
recollected
*NL*
myself
and
drove
away
that
thought
only
when
I
found
myself
glowing
with
*NL*
anger
,
but
I
did
not
sufficiently
repent
.
Afterwards
Boris
Drubetskoy
*NL*
came
and
began
relating
various
adventures
.
His
coming
vexed
me
from
the
*NL*
first
,
and
I
said
something
disagreeable
to
him
.
He
replied
.
I
flared
up
*NL*
and
said
much
that
was
unpleasant
and
even
rude
to
him
.
He
became
*NL*
silent
,
and
I
recollected
myself
only
when
it
was
too
late
.
My
God
,
I
*NL*
can
not
get
on
with
him
at
all
.
The
cause
of
this
is
my
egotism
.
I
set
*NL*
myself
above
him
and
so
become
much
worse
than
he
,
for
he
is
lenient
to
*NL*
my
rudeness
while
I
on
the
contrary
nourish
contempt
for
him
.
O
God
,
*NL*
grant
that
in
his
presence
I
may
rather
see
my
own
vileness
,
and
behave
*NL*
so
that
he
too
may
benefit
.
After
dinner
I
fell
asleep
and
as
I
was
*NL*
drowsing
off
I
clearly
heard
a
voice
saying
in
my
left
ear
,
``
Thy
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamed
that
I
was
walking
in
the
dark
and
was
suddenly
surrounded
by
*NL*
dogs
,
but
I
went
on
undismayed
.
Suddenly
a
smallish
dog
seized
my
left
*NL*
thigh
with
its
teeth
and
would
not
let
go
.
I
began
to
throttle
it
with
*NL*
my
hands
.
Scarcely
had
I
torn
it
off
before
another
,
a
bigger
one
,
began
*NL*
biting
me
.
I
lifted
it
up
,
but
the
higher
I
lifted
it
the
bigger
and
*NL*
heavier
it
grew
.
And
suddenly
Brother
A.
came
and
,
taking
my
arm
,
led
me
*NL*
to
a
building
to
enter
which
we
had
to
pass
along
a
narrow
plank
.
I
*NL*
stepped
on
it
,
but
it
bent
and
gave
way
and
I
began
to
clamber
up
a
*NL*
fence
which
I
could
scarcely
reach
with
my
hands
.
After
much
effort
I
*NL*
dragged
myself
up
,
so
that
my
leg
hung
down
on
one
side
and
my
body
on
*NL*
the
other
.
I
looked
round
and
saw
Brother
A.
standing
on
the
fence
and
*NL*
pointing
me
to
a
broad
avenue
and
garden
,
and
in
the
garden
was
a
large
*NL*
and
beautiful
building
.
I
woke
up
.
O
Lord
,
great
Architect
of
Nature
,
*NL*
help
me
to
tear
from
myself
these
dogs
--
my
passions
especially
the
last
,
*NL*
which
unites
in
itself
the
strength
of
all
the
former
ones
,
and
aid
me
*NL*
to
enter
that
temple
of
virtue
to
a
vision
of
which
I
attained
in
my
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
7th
December
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamed
that
Joseph
Alexeevich
was
sitting
in
my
house
,
and
that
I
was
*NL*
very
glad
and
wished
to
entertain
him
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
chattered
*NL*
incessantly
with
other
people
and
suddenly
remembered
that
this
could
*NL*
not
please
him
,
and
I
wished
to
come
close
to
him
and
embrace
him
.
But
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
drew
near
I
saw
that
his
face
had
changed
and
grown
young
,
*NL*
and
he
was
quietly
telling
me
something
about
the
teaching
of
our
order
,
*NL*
but
so
softly
that
I
could
not
hear
it
.
Then
it
seemed
that
we
all
left
*NL*
the
room
and
something
strange
happened
.
We
were
sitting
or
lying
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
He
was
telling
me
something
,
and
I
wished
to
show
him
my
*NL*
sensibility
,
and
not
listening
to
what
he
was
saying
I
began
picturing
*NL*
to
myself
the
condition
of
my
inner
man
and
the
grace
of
God
sanctifying
*NL*
me
.
And
tears
came
into
my
eyes
,
and
I
was
glad
he
noticed
this
.
But
he
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
vexation
and
jumped
up
,
breaking
off
his
remarks
.
I
*NL*
felt
abashed
and
asked
whether
what
he
had
been
saying
did
not
concern
*NL*
me
;
but
he
did
not
reply
,
gave
me
a
kind
look
,
and
then
we
suddenly
*NL*
found
ourselves
in
my
bedroom
where
there
is
a
double
bed
.
He
lay
down
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
it
and
I
burned
with
longing
to
caress
him
and
lie
down
*NL*
too
.
And
he
said
,
``
Tell
me
frankly
what
is
your
chief
temptation
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
it
?
I
think
you
know
it
already
.
''
Abashed
by
this
question
,
I
*NL*
replied
that
sloth
was
my
chief
temptation
.
He
shook
his
head
*NL*
incredulously
;
and
even
more
abashed
,
I
said
that
though
I
was
living
*NL*
with
my
wife
as
he
advised
,
I
was
not
living
with
her
as
her
husband
.
To
*NL*
this
he
replied
that
one
should
not
deprive
a
wife
of
one
's
embraces
and
*NL*
gave
me
to
understand
that
that
was
my
duty
.
But
I
replied
that
I
should
*NL*
be
ashamed
to
do
it
,
and
suddenly
everything
vanished
.
And
I
awoke
and
*NL*
found
in
my
mind
the
text
from
the
Gospel
:
``
The
life
was
the
light
of
*NL*
men
.
And
the
light
shineth
in
darkness
;
and
the
darkness
comprehended
it
*NL*
not
.
''
Joseph
Alexeevich
's
face
had
looked
young
and
bright
.
That
day
I
*NL*
received
a
letter
from
my
benefactor
in
which
he
wrote
about
``
conjugal
*NL*
duties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
9th
December
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
dream
from
which
I
awoke
with
a
throbbing
heart
.
I
saw
that
I
*NL*
was
in
Moscow
in
my
house
,
in
the
big
sitting
room
,
and
Joseph
*NL*
Alexeevich
came
in
from
the
drawing
room
.
I
seemed
to
know
at
once
that
*NL*
the
process
of
regeneration
had
already
taken
place
in
him
,
and
I
rushed
*NL*
to
meet
him
.
I
embraced
him
and
kissed
his
hands
,
and
he
said
,
``
Hast
*NL*
thou
noticed
that
my
face
is
different
?
''
I
looked
at
him
,
still
holding
*NL*
him
in
my
arms
,
and
saw
that
his
face
was
young
,
but
that
he
had
no
hair
*NL*
on
his
head
and
his
features
were
quite
changed
.
And
I
said
,
``
I
should
*NL*
have
known
you
had
I
met
you
by
chance
,
''
and
I
thought
to
myself
,
``
Am
I
*NL*
telling
the
truth
?
''
And
suddenly
I
saw
him
lying
like
a
dead
body
;
then
*NL*
he
gradually
recovered
and
went
with
me
into
my
study
carrying
a
large
*NL*
book
of
sheets
of
drawing
paper
;
I
said
,
``
I
drew
that
,
''
and
he
answered
*NL*
by
bowing
his
head
.
I
opened
the
book
,
and
on
all
the
pages
there
were
*NL*
excellent
drawings
.
And
in
my
dream
I
knew
that
these
drawings
*NL*
represented
the
love
adventures
of
the
soul
with
its
beloved
.
And
on
its
*NL*
pages
I
saw
a
beautiful
representation
of
a
maiden
in
transparent
*NL*
garments
and
with
a
transparent
body
,
flying
up
to
the
clouds
.
And
I
*NL*
seemed
to
know
that
this
maiden
was
nothing
else
than
a
representation
*NL*
of
the
Song
of
Songs
.
And
looking
at
those
drawings
I
dreamed
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
was
doing
wrong
,
but
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
them
.
Lord
,
*NL*
help
me
!
My
God
,
if
Thy
forsaking
me
is
Thy
doing
,
Thy
will
be
done
;
but
*NL*
if
I
am
myself
the
cause
,
teach
me
what
I
should
do
!
I
shall
perish
of
*NL*
my
debauchery
if
Thou
utterly
desertest
me
!

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rostovs
'
monetary
affairs
had
not
improved
during
the
two
years
they
*NL*
had
spent
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Nicholas
Rostov
had
kept
firmly
to
his
resolution
and
was
still
*NL*
serving
modestly
in
an
obscure
regiment
,
spending
comparatively
little
,
*NL*
the
way
of
life
at
Otradnoe
--
Mitenka
's
management
of
affairs
,
in
*NL*
particular
--
was
such
that
the
debts
inevitably
increased
every
year
.
The
*NL*
only
resource
obviously
presenting
itself
to
the
old
count
was
to
apply
*NL*
for
an
official
post
,
so
he
had
come
to
Petersburg
to
look
for
one
and
*NL*
also
,
as
he
said
,
to
let
the
lassies
enjoy
themselves
for
the
last
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
their
arrival
in
Petersburg
Berg
proposed
to
Vera
and
was
*NL*
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
in
Moscow
the
Rostovs
belonged
to
the
best
society
without
*NL*
themselves
giving
it
a
thought
,
yet
in
Petersburg
their
circle
of
*NL*
acquaintances
was
a
mixed
and
indefinite
one
.
In
Petersburg
they
were
*NL*
provincials
,
and
the
very
people
they
had
entertained
in
Moscow
without
*NL*
inquiring
to
what
set
they
belonged
,
here
looked
down
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rostovs
lived
in
the
same
hospitable
way
in
Petersburg
as
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
and
the
most
diverse
people
met
at
their
suppers
.
Country
neighbors
from
*NL*
Otradnoe
,
impoverished
old
squires
and
their
daughters
,
Peronskaya
a
*NL*
maid
of
honor
,
Pierre
Bezukhov
,
and
the
son
of
their
district
postmaster
*NL*
who
had
obtained
a
post
in
Petersburg
.
Among
the
men
who
very
soon
*NL*
became
frequent
visitors
at
the
Rostovs
'
house
in
Petersburg
were
Boris
,
*NL*
Pierre
whom
the
count
had
met
in
the
street
and
dragged
home
with
him
,
*NL*
and
Berg
who
spent
whole
days
at
the
Rostovs
'
and
paid
the
eldest
*NL*
daughter
,
Countess
Vera
,
the
attentions
a
young
man
pays
when
he
intends
*NL*
to
propose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
in
vain
had
Berg
shown
everybody
his
right
hand
wounded
at
*NL*
Austerlitz
and
held
a
perfectly
unnecessary
sword
in
his
left
.
He
*NL*
narrated
that
episode
so
persistently
and
with
so
important
an
air
that
*NL*
everyone
believed
in
the
merit
and
usefulness
of
his
deed
,
and
he
had
*NL*
obtained
two
decorations
for
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Finnish
war
he
also
managed
to
distinguish
himself
.
He
had
picked
*NL*
up
the
scrap
of
a
grenade
that
had
killed
an
aide-de-camp
standing
near
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
and
had
taken
it
to
his
commander
.
Just
as
he
had
*NL*
done
after
Austerlitz
,
he
related
this
occurrence
at
such
length
and
so
*NL*
insistently
that
everyone
again
believed
it
had
been
necessary
to
do
*NL*
this
,
and
he
received
two
decorations
for
the
Finnish
war
also
.
In
1809
*NL*
he
was
a
captain
in
the
Guards
,
wore
medals
,
and
held
some
special
*NL*
lucrative
posts
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
some
skeptics
smiled
when
told
of
Berg
's
merits
,
it
could
not
be
*NL*
denied
that
he
was
a
painstaking
and
brave
officer
,
on
excellent
terms
*NL*
with
his
superiors
,
and
a
moral
young
man
with
a
brilliant
career
before
*NL*
him
and
an
assured
position
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
years
before
,
meeting
a
German
comrade
in
the
stalls
of
a
Moscow
*NL*
theater
,
Berg
had
pointed
out
Vera
Rostova
to
him
and
had
said
in
*NL*
German
,
``
das
soll
mein
Weib
werden
,
''
*
and
from
that
moment
had
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
to
marry
her
.
Now
in
Petersburg
,
having
considered
the
Rostovs
'
*NL*
position
and
his
own
,
he
decided
that
the
time
had
come
to
propose
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
That
girl
shall
be
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
's
proposal
was
at
first
received
with
a
perplexity
that
was
not
*NL*
flattering
to
him
.
At
first
it
seemed
strange
that
the
son
of
an
obscure
*NL*
Livonian
gentleman
should
propose
marriage
to
a
Countess
Rostova
;
but
*NL*
Berg
's
chief
characteristic
was
such
a
naive
and
good
natured
egotism
*NL*
that
the
Rostovs
involuntarily
came
to
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
,
*NL*
since
he
himself
was
so
firmly
convinced
that
it
was
good
,
indeed
*NL*
excellent
.
Moreover
,
the
Rostovs
'
affairs
were
seriously
embarrassed
,
as
*NL*
the
suitor
could
not
but
know
;
and
above
all
,
Vera
was
twenty-four
,
had
*NL*
been
taken
out
everywhere
,
and
though
she
was
certainly
good-looking
and
*NL*
sensible
,
no
one
up
to
now
had
proposed
to
her
.
So
they
gave
their
*NL*
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Berg
to
his
comrade
,
whom
he
called
``
friend
''
only
*NL*
because
he
knew
that
everyone
has
friends
,
``
you
see
,
I
have
considered
*NL*
it
all
,
and
should
not
marry
if
I
had
not
thought
it
all
out
or
if
it
*NL*
were
in
any
way
unsuitable
.
But
on
the
contrary
,
my
papa
and
mamma
are
*NL*
now
provided
for
--
I
have
arranged
that
rent
for
them
in
the
Baltic
*NL*
Provinces
--
and
I
can
live
in
Petersburg
on
my
pay
,
and
with
her
fortune
*NL*
and
my
good
management
we
can
get
along
nicely
.
I
am
not
marrying
for
*NL*
money
--
I
consider
that
dishonorable
--
but
a
wife
should
bring
her
share
*NL*
and
a
husband
his
.
I
have
my
position
in
the
service
,
she
has
*NL*
connections
and
some
means
.
In
our
times
that
is
worth
something
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
But
above
all
,
she
is
a
handsome
,
estimable
girl
,
and
she
loves
*NL*
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
blushed
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
love
her
,
because
her
character
is
sensible
and
very
good
.
Now
*NL*
the
other
sister
,
though
they
are
the
same
family
,
is
quite
different
--
*NL*
an
unpleasant
character
and
has
not
the
same
intelligence
.
She
is
so
...
*NL*
you
know
?
...
Unpleasant
...
But
my
fiancee
!
...
Well
,
you
will
be
coming
,
''
*NL*
he
was
going
to
say
,
``
to
dine
,
''
but
changed
his
mind
and
said
``
to
take
*NL*
tea
with
us
,
''
and
quickly
doubling
up
his
tongue
he
blew
a
small
round
*NL*
ring
of
tobacco
smoke
,
perfectly
embodying
his
dream
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
feeling
of
perplexity
aroused
in
the
parents
by
Berg
's
*NL*
proposal
,
the
holiday
tone
of
joyousness
usual
at
such
times
took
*NL*
possession
of
the
family
,
but
the
rejoicing
was
external
and
insincere
.
*NL*
In
the
family
's
feeling
toward
this
wedding
a
certain
awkwardness
and
*NL*
constraint
was
evident
,
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
not
having
loved
Vera
*NL*
sufficiently
and
of
being
so
ready
to
get
her
off
their
hands
.
The
old
*NL*
count
felt
this
most
.
He
would
probably
have
been
unable
to
state
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
embarrassment
,
but
it
resulted
from
the
state
of
his
*NL*
affairs
.
He
did
not
know
at
all
how
much
he
had
,
what
his
debts
amounted
*NL*
to
,
or
what
dowry
he
could
give
Vera
.
When
his
daughters
were
born
he
*NL*
had
assigned
to
each
of
them
,
for
her
dowry
,
an
estate
with
three
*NL*
hundred
serfs
;
but
one
of
these
estates
had
already
been
sold
,
and
the
*NL*
other
was
mortgaged
and
the
interest
so
much
in
arrears
that
it
would
*NL*
have
to
be
sold
,
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
it
to
Vera
.
Nor
had
*NL*
he
any
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
had
already
been
engaged
a
month
,
and
only
a
week
remained
before
*NL*
the
wedding
,
but
the
count
had
not
yet
decided
in
his
own
mind
the
*NL*
question
of
the
dowry
,
nor
spoken
to
his
wife
about
it
.
At
one
time
the
*NL*
count
thought
of
giving
her
the
Ryazan
estate
or
of
selling
a
forest
,
at
*NL*
another
time
of
borrowing
money
on
a
note
of
hand
.
A
few
days
before
the
*NL*
wedding
Berg
entered
the
count
's
study
early
one
morning
and
,
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
smile
,
respectfully
asked
his
future
father-in-law
to
let
him
*NL*
know
what
Vera
's
dowry
would
be
.
The
count
was
so
disconcerted
by
this
*NL*
long-foreseen
inquiry
that
without
consideration
he
gave
the
first
reply
*NL*
that
came
into
his
head
.
``
I
like
your
being
businesslike
about
it
...
I
*NL*
like
it
.
You
shall
be
satisfied
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
patting
Berg
on
the
shoulder
he
got
up
,
wishing
to
end
the
*NL*
conversation
.
But
Berg
,
smiling
pleasantly
,
explained
that
if
he
did
not
*NL*
know
for
certain
how
much
Vera
would
have
and
did
not
receive
at
least
*NL*
part
of
the
dowry
in
advance
,
he
would
have
to
break
matters
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
consider
,
Count
--
if
I
allowed
myself
to
marry
now
without
*NL*
having
definite
means
to
maintain
my
wife
,
I
should
be
acting
badly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
ended
by
the
count
,
who
wished
to
be
generous
and
to
*NL*
avoid
further
importunity
,
saying
that
he
would
give
a
note
of
hand
for
*NL*
eighty
thousand
rubles
.
Berg
smiled
meekly
,
kissed
the
count
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
said
that
he
was
very
grateful
,
but
that
it
was
impossible
*NL*
for
him
to
arrange
his
new
life
without
receiving
thirty
thousand
in
*NL*
ready
money
.
``
Or
at
least
twenty
thousand
,
Count
,
''
he
added
,
``
and
then
a
*NL*
note
of
hand
for
only
sixty
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
all
right
!
''
said
the
count
hurriedly
.
``
Only
excuse
me
,
my
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
I
'll
give
you
twenty
thousand
and
a
note
of
hand
for
eighty
*NL*
thousand
as
well
.
Yes
,
yes
!
Kiss
me

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
sixteen
and
it
was
the
year
1809
,
the
very
year
to
which
she
*NL*
had
counted
on
her
fingers
with
Boris
after
they
had
kissed
four
years
*NL*
ago
.
Since
then
she
had
not
seen
him
.
Before
Sonya
and
her
mother
,
if
*NL*
Boris
happened
to
be
mentioned
,
she
spoke
quite
freely
of
that
episode
*NL*
as
of
some
childish
,
long-forgotten
matter
that
was
not
worth
*NL*
mentioning
.
But
in
the
secret
depths
of
her
soul
the
question
whether
*NL*
her
engagement
to
Boris
was
a
jest
or
an
important
,
binding
promise
*NL*
tormented
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Boris
left
Moscow
in
1805
to
join
the
army
he
had
not
seen
the
*NL*
Rostovs
.
He
had
been
in
Moscow
several
times
,
and
had
passed
near
*NL*
Otradnoe
,
but
had
never
been
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
it
occurred
to
Natasha
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
,
and
*NL*
this
conjecture
was
confirmed
by
the
sad
tone
in
which
her
elders
spoke
*NL*
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowadays
old
friends
are
not
remembered
,
''
the
countess
would
say
when
*NL*
Boris
was
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
also
had
of
late
visited
them
less
frequently
,
seemed
*NL*
to
hold
herself
with
particular
dignity
,
and
always
spoke
rapturously
*NL*
and
gratefully
of
the
merits
of
her
son
and
the
brilliant
career
on
*NL*
which
he
had
entered
.
When
the
Rostovs
came
to
Petersburg
Boris
called
*NL*
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drove
to
their
house
in
some
agitation
.
The
memory
of
Natasha
was
his
*NL*
most
poetic
recollection
.
But
he
went
with
the
firm
intention
of
letting
*NL*
her
and
her
parents
feel
that
the
childish
relations
between
himself
and
*NL*
Natasha
could
not
be
binding
either
on
her
or
on
him
.
He
had
a
brilliant
*NL*
position
in
society
thanks
to
his
intimacy
with
Countess
Bezukhova
,
a
*NL*
brilliant
position
in
the
service
thanks
to
the
patronage
of
an
*NL*
important
personage
whose
complete
confidence
he
enjoyed
,
and
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
make
plans
for
marrying
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
plans
which
might
very
easily
be
realized
.
When
he
entered
*NL*
the
Rostovs
'
drawing
room
Natasha
was
in
her
own
room
.
When
she
heard
of
*NL*
his
arrival
she
almost
ran
into
the
drawing
room
,
flushed
and
beaming
*NL*
with
a
more
than
cordial
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
remembered
Natasha
in
a
short
dress
,
with
dark
eyes
shining
from
*NL*
under
her
curls
and
boisterous
,
childish
laughter
,
as
he
had
known
her
*NL*
four
years
before
;
and
so
he
was
taken
aback
when
quite
a
different
*NL*
Natasha
entered
,
and
his
face
expressed
rapturous
astonishment
.
This
*NL*
expression
on
his
face
pleased
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
you
recognize
your
little
madcap
playmate
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
kissed
Natasha
's
hand
and
said
that
he
was
astonished
at
the
*NL*
change
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
handsome
you
have
grown
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
replied
Natasha
's
laughing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
Papa
older
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
sat
down
and
,
without
joining
in
Boris
'
conversation
with
the
*NL*
countess
,
silently
and
minutely
studied
her
childhood
's
suitor
.
He
felt
*NL*
the
weight
of
that
resolute
and
affectionate
scrutiny
and
glanced
at
her
*NL*
occasionally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
'
uniform
,
spurs
,
tie
,
and
the
way
his
hair
was
brushed
were
all
*NL*
comme
il
faut
and
in
the
latest
fashion
.
This
Natasha
noticed
at
once
.
*NL*
He
sat
rather
sideways
in
the
armchair
next
to
the
countess
,
arranging
*NL*
with
his
right
hand
the
cleanest
of
gloves
that
fitted
his
left
hand
*NL*
like
a
skin
,
and
he
spoke
with
a
particularly
refined
compression
of
his
*NL*
lips
about
the
amusements
of
the
highest
Petersburg
society
,
recalling
*NL*
with
mild
irony
old
times
in
Moscow
and
Moscow
acquaintances
.
It
was
not
*NL*
accidentally
,
Natasha
felt
,
that
he
alluded
,
when
speaking
of
the
*NL*
highest
aristocracy
,
to
an
ambassador
's
ball
he
had
attended
,
and
to
*NL*
invitations
he
had
received
from
N.N.
and
S.S.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Natasha
sat
silent
,
glancing
up
at
him
from
under
her
*NL*
brows
.
This
gaze
disturbed
and
confused
Boris
more
and
more
.
He
looked
*NL*
round
more
frequently
toward
her
,
and
broke
off
in
what
he
was
saying
.
*NL*
He
did
not
stay
more
than
ten
minutes
,
then
rose
and
took
his
leave
.
The
*NL*
same
inquisitive
,
challenging
,
and
rather
mocking
eyes
still
looked
at
*NL*
him
.
After
his
first
visit
Boris
said
to
himself
that
Natasha
attracted
*NL*
him
just
as
much
as
ever
,
but
that
he
must
not
yield
to
that
feeling
,
*NL*
because
to
marry
her
,
a
girl
almost
without
fortune
,
would
mean
ruin
to
*NL*
his
career
,
while
to
renew
their
former
relations
without
intending
to
*NL*
marry
her
would
be
dishonorable
.
Boris
made
up
his
mind
to
avoid
meeting
*NL*
Natasha
,
but
despite
that
resolution
he
called
again
a
few
days
later
*NL*
and
began
calling
often
and
spending
whole
days
at
the
Rostovs
'
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
an
explanation
with
Natasha
and
tell
*NL*
her
that
the
old
times
must
be
forgotten
,
that
in
spite
of
everything
...
*NL*
she
could
not
be
his
wife
,
that
he
had
no
means
,
and
they
would
never
*NL*
let
her
marry
him
.
But
he
failed
to
do
so
and
felt
awkward
about
*NL*
entering
on
such
an
explanation
.
From
day
to
day
he
became
more
and
more
*NL*
entangled
.
It
seemed
to
her
mother
and
Sonya
that
Natasha
was
in
love
*NL*
with
Boris
as
of
old
.
She
sang
him
his
favorite
songs
,
showed
him
her
*NL*
album
,
making
him
write
in
it
,
did
not
allow
him
to
allude
to
the
past
,
*NL*
letting
it
be
understood
how
delightful
was
the
present
;
and
every
day
*NL*
he
went
away
in
a
fog
,
without
having
said
what
he
meant
to
,
and
not
*NL*
knowing
what
he
was
doing
or
why
he
came
,
or
how
it
would
all
end
.
He
*NL*
left
off
visiting
Helene
and
received
reproachful
notes
from
her
every
*NL*
day
,
and
yet
he
continued
to
spend
whole
days
with
the
Rostovs
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
when
the
old
countess
,
in
nightcap
and
dressing
jacket
,
*NL*
without
her
false
curls
,
and
with
her
poor
little
knob
of
hair
showing
*NL*
under
her
white
cotton
cap
,
knelt
sighing
and
groaning
on
a
rug
and
*NL*
bowing
to
the
ground
in
prayer
,
her
door
creaked
and
Natasha
,
also
in
a
*NL*
dressing
jacket
with
slippers
on
her
bare
feet
and
her
hair
in
*NL*
curlpapers
,
ran
in
.
The
countess
--
her
prayerful
mood
dispelled
--
looked
*NL*
round
and
frowned
.
She
was
finishing
her
last
prayer
:
``
Can
it
be
that
*NL*
this
couch
will
be
my
grave
?
''
Natasha
,
flushed
and
eager
,
seeing
her
*NL*
mother
in
prayer
,
suddenly
checked
her
rush
,
half
sat
down
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
put
out
her
tongue
as
if
chiding
herself
.
Seeing
that
her
*NL*
mother
was
still
praying
she
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bed
and
,
rapidly
*NL*
slipping
one
little
foot
against
the
other
,
pushed
off
her
slippers
and
*NL*
jumped
onto
the
bed
the
countess
had
feared
might
become
her
grave
.
This
*NL*
couch
was
high
,
with
a
feather
bed
and
five
pillows
each
smaller
than
*NL*
the
one
below
.
Natasha
jumped
on
it
,
sank
into
the
feather
bed
,
rolled
*NL*
over
to
the
wall
,
and
began
snuggling
up
the
bedclothes
as
she
settled
*NL*
down
,
raising
her
knees
to
her
chin
,
kicking
out
and
laughing
almost
*NL*
inaudibly
,
now
covering
herself
up
head
and
all
,
and
now
peeping
at
her
*NL*
mother
.
The
countess
finished
her
prayers
and
came
to
the
bed
with
a
*NL*
stern
face
,
but
seeing
,
that
Natasha
's
head
was
covered
,
she
smiled
in
*NL*
her
kind
,
weak
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
now
then
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
can
we
have
a
talk
?
Yes
?
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Now
,
just
one
on
your
*NL*
throat
and
another
...
that
'll
do
!
''
And
seizing
her
mother
round
the
*NL*
neck
,
she
kissed
her
on
the
throat
.
In
her
behavior
to
her
mother
*NL*
Natasha
seemed
rough
,
but
she
was
so
sensitive
and
tactful
that
however
*NL*
she
clasped
her
mother
she
always
managed
to
do
it
without
hurting
her
*NL*
or
making
her
feel
uncomfortable
or
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
tonight
?
''
said
the
mother
,
having
arranged
her
pillows
*NL*
and
waited
until
Natasha
,
after
turning
over
a
couple
of
times
,
had
*NL*
settled
down
beside
her
under
the
quilt
,
spread
out
her
arms
,
and
*NL*
assumed
a
serious
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
visits
of
Natasha
's
at
night
before
the
count
returned
from
his
*NL*
club
were
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
both
mother
,
and
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
tonight
?
--
But
I
have
to
tell
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
put
her
hand
on
her
mother
's
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Boris
...
I
know
,
''
she
said
seriously
;
``
that
's
what
I
have
come
*NL*
about
.
Do
n't
say
it
--
I
know
.
No
,
do
tell
me
!
''
and
she
removed
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
Mamma
!
He
's
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
you
are
sixteen
.
At
your
age
I
was
married
.
You
say
Boris
is
*NL*
nice
.
He
is
very
nice
,
and
I
love
him
like
a
son
.
But
what
then
?
...
What
*NL*
are
you
thinking
about
?
You
have
quite
turned
his
head
,
I
can
see
*NL*
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
said
this
the
countess
looked
round
at
her
daughter
.
Natasha
was
*NL*
lying
looking
steadily
straight
before
her
at
one
of
the
mahogany
*NL*
sphinxes
carved
on
the
corners
of
the
bedstead
,
so
that
the
countess
*NL*
only
saw
her
daughter
's
face
in
profile
.
That
face
struck
her
by
its
*NL*
peculiarly
serious
and
concentrated
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
listening
and
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
quite
turned
his
head
,
and
why
?
What
do
you
want
of
him
?
You
*NL*
know
you
ca
n't
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
Natasha
,
without
changing
her
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
is
young
,
because
he
is
poor
,
because
he
is
a
relation
...
*NL*
and
because
you
yourself
do
n't
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
It
is
not
right
,
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
want
to
...
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
talking
nonsense
,
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
want
to
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
I
am
in
earnest
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
let
her
finish
.
She
drew
the
countess
'
large
hand
to
*NL*
her
,
kissed
it
on
the
back
and
then
on
the
palm
,
then
again
turned
it
*NL*
over
and
began
kissing
first
one
knuckle
,
then
the
space
between
the
*NL*
knuckles
,
then
the
next
knuckle
,
whispering
,
``
January
,
February
,
March
,
*NL*
April
,
May
.
Speak
,
Mamma
,
why
do
n't
you
say
anything
?
Speak
!
''
said
she
,
*NL*
turning
to
her
mother
,
who
was
tenderly
gazing
at
her
daughter
and
in
*NL*
that
contemplation
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
she
had
wished
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
do
,
my
love
!
Not
everyone
will
understand
this
friendship
*NL*
dating
from
your
childish
days
,
and
to
see
him
so
intimate
with
you
may
*NL*
injure
you
in
the
eyes
of
other
young
men
who
visit
us
,
and
above
all
it
*NL*
torments
him
for
nothing
.
He
may
already
have
found
a
suitable
and
*NL*
wealthy
match
,
and
now
he
's
half
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crazy
?
''
repeated
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
some
things
about
myself

I
had
a
cousin

Cyril
Matveich

what
I
'll
do

I
'll
have
a

talk
with
Boris

He
need
not
come
so
often

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
if
he
likes
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
know

No

Mamma

do

speak
to
him

What
nonsense
!
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
in
the
tone
of
one
being
deprived
of
her
property
.
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
marry

but
let
him
come
if
he
enjoys
it

I
enjoy
it

Natasha
*NL*
smiled
and
looked
at
her
mother
.
``
Not
to
marry
,
but
just
so
,

she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so

my
pet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so

There
's
no

marry
him

But
...
just
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
just
so
,
''
repeated
the
countess
,
and
shaking
all
over
,
she
*NL*
went
off
into
a
good
humored
,
unexpected
,
elderly
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
,
stop
!
''
cried
Natasha
.
``
You
're
shaking
the
whole
bed
!
*NL*
You
're
awfully
like
me
,
just
such
another
giggler
...
Wait
...
''
and
she
*NL*
seized
the
countess
'
hands
and
kissed
a
knuckle
of
the
little
finger
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
June
,
''
and
continued
,
kissing
,
``
July
,
August
,
''
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
.
``
But
,
Mamma

is
he
very
much
in
love

What
do
you
think

Was
*NL*
anybody
ever
so
much
in
love
with
you
?
And
he
's
very
nice
,
very
,
very
*NL*
nice
.
Only
not
quite
my
taste
--
he
is
so
narrow
,
like
the
dining-room
*NL*
clock
...
Do
n't
you
understand
?
Narrow
,
you
know
--
gray
,
light
gray

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
rubbish
you
're
talking
!
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
continued
:
``
Do
n't
you
really
understand
?
Nicholas
would
*NL*
understand

Bezukhov
,
now

is
blue
,
dark-blue
and
red
,
and
he
is
*NL*
square
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
flirt
with
him
too
,
''
said
the
countess
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
a
Freemason
,
I
have
found
out
.
He
is
fine
,
dark-blue
and
*NL*
red
...
How
can
I
explain
it
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
countess
!
''
the
count
's
voice
called
from
behind
the
door
.
*NL*
``
You
're
not
asleep
?
''
Natasha
jumped
up
,
snatched
up
her
slippers
,
and
*NL*
ran
barefoot
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
sleep
.
She
kept
thinking
that
no
one
*NL*
could
understand
all
that
she
understood
and
all
there
was
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
?
''
she
thought
,
glancing
at
that
curled-up
,
sleeping
little
kitten
*NL*
with
her
enormous
plait
of
hair
.
``
No
,
how
could
she
?
She
's
virtuous
.
She
*NL*
fell
in
love
with
Nicholas
and
does
not
wish
to
know
anything
more
.
Even
*NL*
Mamma
does
not
understand
.
It
is
wonderful
how
clever
I
am
and
how
...
*NL*
charming
she
is
,
''
she
went
on
,
speaking
of
herself
in
the
third
person
,
*NL*
and
imagining
it
was
some
very
wise
man
--
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
--
who
*NL*
was
saying
it
of
her
.
``
There
is
everything
,
everything
in
her
,
''
*NL*
continued
this
man
.
``
She
is
unusually
intelligent
,
charming
...
and
then
*NL*
she
is
pretty
,
uncommonly
pretty
,
and
agile
--
she
swims
and
rides
*NL*
splendidly
...
and
her
voice
!
One
can
really
say
it
's
a
wonderful
voice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hummed
a
scrap
from
her
favorite
opera
by
Cherubini
,
threw
herself
*NL*
on
her
bed
,
laughed
at
the
pleasant
thought
that
she
would
immediately
*NL*
fall
asleep
,
called
Dunyasha
the
maid
to
put
out
the
candle
,
and
before
*NL*
Dunyasha
had
left
the
room
had
already
passed
into
yet
another
happier
*NL*
world
of
dreams
,
where
everything
was
as
light
and
beautiful
as
in
*NL*
reality
,
and
even
more
so
because
it
was
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
countess
called
Boris
aside
and
had
a
talk
with
him
,
after
*NL*
which
he
ceased
coming
to
the
Rostovs

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
thirty-first
of
December
,
New
Year
's
Eve
,
1809
-
10
an
old
*NL*
grandee
of
Catherine
's
day
was
giving
a
ball
and
midnight
supper
.
The
*NL*
diplomatic
corps
and
the
Emperor
himself
were
to
be
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandee
's
well-known
mansion
on
the
English
Quay
glittered
with
*NL*
innumerable
lights
.
Police
were
stationed
at
the
brightly
lit
entrance
*NL*
which
was
carpeted
with
red
baize
,
and
not
only
gendarmes
but
dozens
of
*NL*
police
officers
and
even
the
police
master
himself
stood
at
the
porch
.
*NL*
Carriages
kept
driving
away
and
fresh
ones
arriving
,
with
red-liveried
*NL*
footmen
and
footmen
in
plumed
hats
.
From
the
carriages
emerged
men
*NL*
wearing
uniforms
,
stars
,
and
ribbons
,
while
ladies
in
satin
and
ermine
*NL*
cautiously
descended
the
carriage
steps
which
were
let
down
for
them
*NL*
with
a
clatter
,
and
then
walked
hurriedly
and
noiselessly
over
the
baize
*NL*
at
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
every
time
a
new
carriage
drove
up
a
whisper
ran
through
the
*NL*
crowd
and
caps
were
doffed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
?
...
No
,
a
minister
...
prince
...
ambassador
.
Do
n't
you
see
*NL*
the
plumes
?
...
''
was
whispered
among
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
person
,
better
dressed
than
the
rest
,
seemed
to
know
everyone
and
*NL*
mentioned
by
name
the
greatest
dignitaries
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
of
the
visitors
had
already
arrived
,
but
the
Rostovs
,
who
were
*NL*
to
be
present
,
were
still
hurrying
to
get
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
many
discussions
and
preparations
for
this
ball
in
the
*NL*
Rostov
family
,
many
fears
that
the
invitation
would
not
arrive
,
that
the
*NL*
dresses
would
not
be
ready
,
or
that
something
would
not
be
arranged
as
*NL*
it
should
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Ignatevna
Peronskaya
,
a
thin
and
shallow
maid
of
honor
at
the
*NL*
court
of
the
Dowager
Empress
,
who
was
a
friend
and
relation
of
the
*NL*
countess
and
piloted
the
provincial
Rostovs
in
Petersburg
high
society
,
*NL*
was
to
accompany
them
to
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
to
call
for
her
at
her
house
in
the
Taurida
Gardens
at
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
but
it
was
already
five
minutes
to
ten
,
and
the
girls
were
not
*NL*
yet
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
going
to
her
first
grand
ball
.
She
had
got
up
at
eight
that
*NL*
morning
and
had
been
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
activity
all
day
.
All
*NL*
her
powers
since
morning
had
been
concentrated
on
ensuring
that
they
*NL*
all
--
she
herself
,
Mamma
,
and
Sonya
--
should
be
as
well
dressed
as
*NL*
possible
.
Sonya
and
her
mother
put
themselves
entirely
in
her
hands
.
The
*NL*
countess
was
to
wear
a
claret-colored
velvet
dress
,
and
the
two
girls
*NL*
white
gauze
over
pink
silk
slips
,
with
roses
on
their
bodices
and
their
*NL*
hair
dressed
a
la
grecque
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
essential
had
already
been
done
;
feet
,
hands
,
necks
,
and
ears
*NL*
washed
,
perfumed
,
and
powdered
,
as
befits
a
ball
;
the
openwork
silk
*NL*
stockings
and
white
satin
shoes
with
ribbons
were
already
on
;
the
*NL*
hairdressing
was
almost
done
.
Sonya
was
finishing
dressing
and
so
was
*NL*
the
countess
,
but
Natasha
,
who
had
bustled
about
helping
them
all
,
was
*NL*
behindhand
.
She
was
still
sitting
before
a
looking-glass
with
a
dressing
*NL*
jacket
thrown
over
her
slender
shoulders
.
Sonya
stood
ready
dressed
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
room
and
,
pressing
the
head
of
a
pin
till
it
hurt
her
*NL*
dainty
finger
,
was
fixing
on
a
last
ribbon
that
squeaked
as
the
pin
went
*NL*
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
the
way
,
that
's
not
the
way
,
Sonya
!
''
cried
Natasha
turning
*NL*
her
head
and
clutching
with
both
hands
at
her
hair
which
the
maid
who
*NL*
was
dressing
it
had
not
time
to
release
.
``
That
bow
is
not
right
.
Come
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
sat
down
and
Natasha
pinned
the
ribbon
on
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
,
Miss
!
I
ca
n't
do
it
like
that
,
''
said
the
maid
who
was
holding
*NL*
Natasha
's
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
Well
then
,
wait
.
That
's
right
,
Sonya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
ready
?
It
is
nearly
ten
,
''
came
the
countess
'
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
!
Directly
!
And
you
,
Mamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
my
cap
to
pin
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
it
without
me
!
''
called
Natasha
.
``
You
wo
n't
do
it
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
already
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
decided
to
be
at
the
ball
by
half
past
ten
,
and
Natasha
had
*NL*
still
to
get
dressed
and
they
had
to
call
at
the
Taurida
Gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
hair
was
done
,
Natasha
,
in
her
short
petticoat
from
under
which
*NL*
her
dancing
shoes
showed
,
and
in
her
mother
's
dressing
jacket
,
ran
up
to
*NL*
Sonya
,
scrutinized
her
,
and
then
ran
to
her
mother
.
Turning
her
mother
's
*NL*
head
this
way
and
that
,
she
fastened
on
the
cap
and
,
hurriedly
kissing
*NL*
her
gray
hair
,
ran
back
to
the
maids
who
were
turning
up
the
hem
of
her
*NL*
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
the
delay
was
Natasha
's
skirt
,
which
was
too
long
.
Two
*NL*
maids
were
turning
up
the
hem
and
hurriedly
biting
off
the
ends
of
*NL*
thread
.
A
third
with
pins
in
her
mouth
was
running
about
between
the
*NL*
countess
and
Sonya
,
and
a
fourth
held
the
whole
of
the
gossamer
garment
*NL*
up
high
on
one
uplifted
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mavra
,
quicker
,
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
my
thimble
,
Miss
,
from
there
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
will
you
be
ready
?
''
asked
the
count
coming
to
the
door
.
``
Here
*NL*
is
some
scent
.
Peronskaya
must
be
tired
of
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ready
,
Miss
,
''
said
the
maid
,
holding
up
the
shortened
gauze
dress
*NL*
with
two
fingers
,
and
blowing
and
shaking
something
off
it
,
as
if
by
*NL*
this
to
express
a
consciousness
of
the
airiness
and
purity
of
what
she
*NL*
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
began
putting
on
the
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
!
In
a
minute
!
Do
n't
come
in
,
Papa
!
''
she
cried
to
her
father
*NL*
as
he
opened
the
door
--
speaking
from
under
the
filmy
skirt
which
still
*NL*
covered
her
whole
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
slammed
the
door
to
.
A
minute
later
they
let
the
count
in
.
He
was
*NL*
wearing
a
blue
swallow-tail
coat
,
shoes
and
stockings
,
and
was
perfumed
*NL*
and
his
hair
pomaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Papa
!
how
nice
you
look
!
Charming
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
as
she
stood
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
room
smoothing
out
the
folds
of
the
gauze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
Miss
!
allow
me
,
''
said
the
maid
,
who
on
her
knees
was
*NL*
pulling
the
skirt
straight
and
shifting
the
pins
from
one
side
of
her
*NL*
mouth
to
the
other
with
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
you
like
,
''
exclaimed
Sonya
,
in
a
despairing
voice
as
she
*NL*
looked
at
Natasha
,
``
say
what
you
like
,
it
's
still
too
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
stepped
back
to
look
at
herself
in
the
pier
glass
.
The
dress
was
*NL*
too
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
madam
,
it
is
not
at
all
too
long
,
''
said
Mavra
,
crawling
on
her
*NL*
knees
after
her
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
's
too
long
we
'll
tack
it
up
...
we
'll
tack
it
up
in
one
*NL*
minute
,
''
said
the
resolute
Dunyasha
taking
a
needle
that
was
stuck
on
*NL*
the
front
of
her
little
shawl
and
,
still
kneeling
on
the
floor
,
set
to
*NL*
work
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
with
soft
steps
,
the
countess
came
in
shyly
,
in
her
cap
*NL*
and
velvet
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oo-oo
,
my
beauty
!
''
exclaimed
the
count
,
``
she
looks
better
than
any
of
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
embraced
her
but
,
blushing
,
she
stepped
aside
fearing
to
*NL*
be
rumpled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
your
cap
,
more
to
this
side
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
I
'll
arrange
it
,
''
*NL*
and
she
rushed
forward
so
that
the
maids
who
were
tacking
up
her
skirt
*NL*
could
not
move
fast
enough
and
a
piece
of
gauze
was
torn
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
goodness
!
What
has
happened
?
Really
it
was
not
my
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
I
'll
run
it
up
,
it
wo
n't
show
,
''
said
Dunyasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
beauty
--
a
very
queen
!
''
said
the
nurse
as
she
came
to
the
door
.
*NL*
``
And
Sonya
!
They
are
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
past
ten
they
at
last
got
into
their
carriages
and
started
.
*NL*
But
they
had
still
to
call
at
the
Taurida
Gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peronskaya
was
quite
ready
.
In
spite
of
her
age
and
plainness
she
had
*NL*
gone
through
the
same
process
as
the
Rostovs
,
but
with
less
flurry
--
for
*NL*
to
her
it
was
a
matter
of
routine
.
Her
ugly
old
body
was
washed
,
*NL*
perfumed
,
and
powdered
in
just
the
same
way
.
She
had
washed
behind
her
*NL*
ears
just
as
carefully
,
and
when
she
entered
her
drawing
room
in
her
*NL*
yellow
dress
,
wearing
her
badge
as
maid
of
honor
,
her
old
lady
's
maid
*NL*
was
as
full
of
rapturous
admiration
as
the
Rostovs
'
servants
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
praised
the
Rostovs
'
toilets
.
They
praised
her
taste
and
toilet
,
and
*NL*
at
eleven
o'clock
,
careful
of
their
coiffures
and
dresses
,
they
settled
*NL*
themselves
in
their
carriages
and
drove
off
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
had
not
had
a
moment
free
since
early
morning
and
had
not
once
*NL*
had
time
to
think
of
what
lay
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
damp
chill
air
and
crowded
closeness
of
the
swaying
carriage
,
she
*NL*
for
the
first
time
vividly
imagined
what
was
in
store
for
her
there
at
*NL*
the
ball
,
in
those
brightly
lighted
rooms
--
with
music
,
flowers
,
dances
,
*NL*
the
Emperor
,
and
all
the
brilliant
young
people
of
Petersburg
.
The
*NL*
prospect
was
so
splendid
that
she
hardly
believed
it
would
come
true
,
so
*NL*
out
of
keeping
was
it
with
the
chill
darkness
and
closeness
of
the
*NL*
carriage
.
She
understood
all
that
awaited
her
only
when
,
after
stepping
*NL*
over
the
red
baize
at
the
entrance
,
she
entered
the
hall
,
took
off
her
*NL*
fur
cloak
,
and
,
beside
Sonya
and
in
front
of
her
mother
,
mounted
the
*NL*
brightly
illuminated
stairs
between
the
flowers
.
Only
then
did
she
*NL*
remember
how
she
must
behave
at
a
ball
,
and
tried
to
assume
the
majestic
*NL*
air
she
considered
indispensable
for
a
girl
on
such
an
occasion
.
But
,
*NL*
fortunately
for
her
,
she
felt
her
eyes
growing
misty
,
she
saw
nothing
*NL*
clearly
,
her
pulse
beat
a
hundred
to
the
minute
,
and
the
blood
throbbed
*NL*
at
her
heart
.
She
could
not
assume
that
pose
,
which
would
have
made
her
*NL*
ridiculous
,
and
she
moved
on
almost
fainting
from
excitement
and
trying
*NL*
with
all
her
might
to
conceal
it
.
And
this
was
the
very
attitude
that
*NL*
became
her
best
.
Before
and
behind
them
other
visitors
were
entering
,
*NL*
also
talking
in
low
tones
and
wearing
ball
dresses
.
The
mirrors
on
the
*NL*
landing
reflected
ladies
in
white
,
pale-blue
,
and
pink
dresses
,
with
*NL*
diamonds
and
pearls
on
their
bare
necks
and
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
in
the
mirrors
and
could
not
distinguish
her
reflection
*NL*
from
the
others
.
All
was
blended
into
one
brilliant
procession
.
On
*NL*
entering
the
ballroom
the
regular
hum
of
voices
,
footsteps
,
and
*NL*
greetings
deafened
Natasha
,
and
the
light
and
glitter
dazzled
her
still
*NL*
more
.
The
host
and
hostess
,
who
had
already
been
standing
at
the
door
*NL*
for
half
an
hour
repeating
the
same
words
to
the
various
arrivals
,
*NL*
``
Charme
de
vous
voir
,
''
*
greeted
the
Rostovs
and
Peronskaya
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Delighted
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
girls
in
their
white
dresses
,
each
with
a
rose
in
her
black
*NL*
hair
,
both
curtsied
in
the
same
way
,
but
the
hostess
'
eye
involuntarily
*NL*
rested
longer
on
the
slim
Natasha
.
She
looked
at
her
and
gave
her
alone
*NL*
a
special
smile
in
addition
to
her
usual
smile
as
hostess
.
Looking
at
*NL*
her
she
may
have
recalled
the
golden
,
irrecoverable
days
of
her
own
*NL*
girlhood
and
her
own
first
ball
.
The
host
also
followed
Natasha
with
his
*NL*
eyes
and
asked
the
count
which
was
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
!
''
said
he
,
kissing
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
ballroom
guests
stood
crowding
at
the
entrance
doors
awaiting
the
*NL*
Emperor
.
The
countess
took
up
a
position
in
one
of
the
front
rows
of
*NL*
that
crowd
.
Natasha
heard
and
felt
that
several
people
were
asking
about
*NL*
her
and
looking
at
her
.
She
realized
that
those
noticing
her
liked
her
,
*NL*
and
this
observation
helped
to
calm
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
like
ourselves
and
some
worse
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peronskaya
was
pointing
out
to
the
countess
the
most
important
people
at
*NL*
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
Dutch
ambassador
,
do
you
see
?
That
gray-haired
man
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
indicating
an
old
man
with
a
profusion
of
silver-gray
curly
hair
,
*NL*
who
was
surrounded
by
ladies
laughing
at
something
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
she
is
,
the
Queen
of
Petersburg
,
Countess
Bezukhova
,
''
said
*NL*
Peronskaya
,
indicating
Helene
who
had
just
entered
.
``
How
lovely
!
She
is
*NL*
quite
equal
to
Marya
Antonovna
.
See
how
the
men
,
young
and
old
,
pay
*NL*
court
to
her
.
Beautiful
and
clever
...
they
say
Prince
--
is
quite
mad
*NL*
about
her
.
But
see
,
those
two
,
though
not
good-looking
,
are
even
more
*NL*
run
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
a
lady
who
was
crossing
the
room
followed
by
a
very
plain
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
splendid
match
,
a
millionairess
,
''
said
Peronskaya
.
``
And
look
,
*NL*
here
come
her
suitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Bezukhova
's
brother
,
Anatole
Kuragin
,
''
she
said
,
indicating
a
*NL*
handsome
officer
of
the
Horse
Guards
who
passed
by
them
with
head
erect
,
*NL*
looking
at
something
over
the
heads
of
the
ladies
.
``
He
's
handsome
,
is
n't
*NL*
he
?
I
hear
they
will
marry
him
to
that
rich
girl
.
But
your
cousin
,
*NL*
Drubetskoy
,
is
also
very
attentive
to
her
.
They
say
she
has
millions
.
Oh
*NL*
yes
,
that
's
the
French
ambassador
himself
!
''
she
replied
to
the
countess
'
*NL*
inquiry
about
Caulaincourt
.
``
Looks
as
if
he
were
a
king
!
All
the
same
,
*NL*
the
French
are
charming
,
very
charming
.
No
one
more
charming
in
society
.
*NL*
Ah
,
here
she
is
!
Yes
,
she
is
still
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
,
our
*NL*
Marya
Antonovna
!
And
how
simply
she
is
dressed
!
Lovely
!
And
that
stout
*NL*
one
in
spectacles
is
the
universal
Freemason
,
''
she
went
on
,
indicating
*NL*
Pierre
.
``
Put
him
beside
his
wife
and
he
looks
a
regular
buffoon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
swaying
his
stout
body
,
advanced
,
making
way
through
the
crowd
*NL*
and
nodding
to
right
and
left
as
casually
and
good-naturedly
as
if
he
*NL*
were
passing
through
a
crowd
at
a
fair
.
He
pushed
through
,
evidently
*NL*
looking
for
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
joyfully
at
the
familiar
face
of
Pierre
,
``
the
buffoon
,
''
*NL*
as
Peronskaya
had
called
him
,
and
knew
he
was
looking
for
them
,
and
for
*NL*
her
in
particular
.
He
had
promised
to
be
at
the
ball
and
introduce
*NL*
partners
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
he
reached
them
Pierre
stopped
beside
a
very
handsome
,
dark
*NL*
man
of
middle
height
,
and
in
a
white
uniform
,
who
stood
by
a
window
*NL*
talking
to
a
tall
man
wearing
stars
and
a
ribbon
.
Natasha
at
once
*NL*
recognized
the
shorter
and
younger
man
in
the
white
uniform
:
it
was
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
who
seemed
to
her
to
have
grown
much
younger
,
happier
,
and
*NL*
better-looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
someone
else
we
know
--
Bolkonski
,
do
you
see
,
Mamma
?
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
,
pointing
out
Prince
Andrew
.
``
You
remember
,
he
stayed
a
night
*NL*
with
us
at
Otradnoe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
him
?
''
said
Peronskaya
.
``
I
ca
n't
bear
him
.
Il
fait
a
*NL*
present
la
pluie
et
le
beau

He
's
too
proud
for
anything
.
Takes
*NL*
after
his
father
.
And
he
's
hand
in
glove
with
Speranski
,
writing
some
*NL*
project
or
other
.
Just
look
how
he
treats
the
ladies
!
There
's
one
*NL*
talking
to
him
and
he
has
turned
away
,

she
said
,
pointing
at
him
.
``
I
'd
*NL*
give
it
to
him
if
he
treated
me
as
he
does
those
ladies

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
everybody
stirred
,
began
talking
,
and
pressed
forward
and
then
*NL*
back
,
and
between
the
two
rows
,
which
separated
,
the
Emperor
entered
to
*NL*
the
sounds
of
music
that
had
immediately
struck
up
.
Behind
him
walked
*NL*
his
host
and
hostess
.
He
walked
in
rapidly
,
bowing
to
right
and
left
as
*NL*
if
anxious
to
get
the
first
moments
of
the
reception
over
.
The
band
*NL*
played
the
polonaise
in
vogue
at
that
time
on
account
of
the
words
that
*NL*
had
been
set
to
it
,
beginning
:
``
Alexander
,
Elisaveta
,
all
our
hearts
you
*NL*
ravish
quite
...
''
The
Emperor
passed
on
to
the
drawing
room
,
the
crowd
*NL*
made
a
rush
for
the
doors
,
and
several
persons
with
excited
faces
*NL*
hurried
there
and
back
again
.
Then
the
crowd
hastily
retired
from
the
*NL*
drawing-room
door
,
at
which
the
Emperor
reappeared
talking
to
the
*NL*
hostess
.
A
young
man
,
looking
distraught
,
pounced
down
on
the
ladies
,
*NL*
asking
them
to
move
aside
.
Some
ladies
,
with
faces
betraying
complete
*NL*
forgetfulness
of
all
the
rules
of
decorum
,
pushed
forward
to
the
*NL*
detriment
of
their
toilets
.
The
men
began
to
choose
partners
and
take
*NL*
their
places
for
the
polonaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
moved
back
,
and
the
Emperor
came
smiling
out
of
the
drawing
*NL*
room
leading
his
hostess
by
the
hand
but
not
keeping
time
to
the
music
.
*NL*
The
host
followed
with
Marya
Antonovna
Naryshkina
;
then
came
*NL*
ambassadors
,
ministers
,
and
various
generals
,
whom
Peronskaya
diligently
*NL*
named
.
More
than
half
the
ladies
already
had
partners
and
were
taking
*NL*
up
,
or
preparing
to
take
up
,
their
positions
for
the
polonaise
.
Natasha
*NL*
felt
that
she
would
be
left
with
her
mother
and
Sonya
among
a
minority
*NL*
of
women
who
crowded
near
the
wall
,
not
having
been
invited
to
dance
.
*NL*
She
stood
with
her
slender
arms
hanging
down
,
her
scarcely
defined
bosom
*NL*
rising
and
falling
regularly
,
and
with
bated
breath
and
glittering
,
*NL*
frightened
eyes
gazed
straight
before
her
,
evidently
prepared
for
the
*NL*
height
of
joy
or
misery
.
She
was
not
concerned
about
the
Emperor
or
any
*NL*
of
those
great
people
whom
Peronskaya
was
pointing
out
--
she
had
but
one
*NL*
thought
:
``
Is
it
possible
no
one
will
ask
me
,
that
I
shall
not
be
among
*NL*
the
first
to
dance
?
Is
it
possible
that
not
one
of
all
these
men
will
*NL*
notice
me
?
They
do
not
even
seem
to
see
me
,
or
if
they
do
they
look
as
*NL*
if
they
were
saying
,
`
Ah
,
she
's
not
the
one
I
'm
after
,
so
it
's
not
worth
*NL*
looking
at
her
!
'
No
,
it
's
impossible
,
''
she
thought
.
``
They
must
know
how
*NL*
I
long
to
dance
,
how
splendidly
I
dance
,
and
how
they
would
enjoy
*NL*
dancing
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strains
of
the
polonaise
,
which
had
continued
for
a
considerable
*NL*
time
,
had
begun
to
sound
like
a
sad
reminiscence
to
Natasha
's
ears
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
cry
.
Peronskaya
had
left
them
.
The
count
was
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
.
She
and
the
countess
and
Sonya
were
standing
by
themselves
*NL*
as
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
amid
that
crowd
of
strangers
,
with
no
one
*NL*
interested
in
them
and
not
wanted
by
anyone
.
Prince
Andrew
with
a
lady
*NL*
passed
by
,
evidently
not
recognizing
them
.
The
handsome
Anatole
was
*NL*
smilingly
talking
to
a
partner
on
his
arm
and
looked
at
Natasha
as
one
*NL*
looks
at
a
wall
.
Boris
passed
them
twice
and
each
time
turned
away
.
Berg
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
who
were
not
dancing
,
came
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
family
gathering
seemed
humiliating
to
Natasha
--
as
if
there
were
*NL*
nowhere
else
for
the
family
to
talk
but
here
at
the
ball
.
She
did
not
*NL*
listen
to
or
look
at
Vera
,
who
was
telling
her
something
about
her
own
*NL*
green
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Emperor
stopped
beside
his
last
partner
-LRB-
he
had
danced
with
*NL*
three
-RRB-
and
the
music
ceased
.
A
worried
aide-de-camp
ran
up
to
the
*NL*
Rostovs
requesting
them
to
stand
farther
back
,
though
as
it
was
they
*NL*
were
already
close
to
the
wall
,
and
from
the
gallery
resounded
the
*NL*
distinct
,
precise
,
enticingly
rhythmical
strains
of
a
waltz
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
looked
smilingly
down
the
room
.
A
minute
passed
but
no
one
had
yet
begun
*NL*
dancing
.
An
aide-de-camp
,
the
Master
of
Ceremonies
,
went
up
to
Countess
*NL*
Bezukhova
and
asked
her
to
dance
.
She
smilingly
raised
her
hand
and
laid
*NL*
it
on
his
shoulder
without
looking
at
him
.
The
aide-de-camp
,
an
adept
in
*NL*
his
art
,
grasping
his
partner
firmly
round
her
waist
,
with
confident
*NL*
deliberation
started
smoothly
,
gliding
first
round
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
circle
,
then
at
the
corner
of
the
room
he
caught
Helene
's
left
hand
and
*NL*
turned
her
,
the
only
sound
audible
,
apart
from
the
ever-quickening
*NL*
music
,
being
the
rhythmic
click
of
the
spurs
on
his
rapid
,
agile
feet
,
*NL*
while
at
every
third
beat
his
partner
's
velvet
dress
spread
out
and
*NL*
seemed
to
flash
as
she
whirled
round
.
Natasha
gazed
at
them
and
was
*NL*
ready
to
cry
because
it
was
not
she
who
was
dancing
that
first
turn
of
*NL*
the
waltz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
in
the
white
uniform
of
a
cavalry
colonel
,
wearing
*NL*
stockings
and
dancing
shoes
,
stood
looking
animated
and
bright
in
the
*NL*
front
row
of
the
circle
not
far
from
the
Rostovs
.
Baron
Firhoff
was
*NL*
talking
to
him
about
the
first
sitting
of
the
Council
of
State
to
be
*NL*
held
next
day
.
Prince
Andrew
,
as
one
closely
connected
with
Speranski
*NL*
and
participating
in
the
work
of
the
legislative
commission
,
could
give
*NL*
reliable
information
about
that
sitting
,
concerning
which
various
rumors
*NL*
were
current
.
But
not
listening
to
what
Firhoff
was
saying
,
he
was
*NL*
gazing
now
at
the
sovereign
and
now
at
the
men
intending
to
dance
who
*NL*
had
not
yet
gathered
courage
to
enter
the
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
watching
these
men
abashed
by
the
Emperor
's
presence
,
*NL*
and
the
women
who
were
breathlessly
longing
to
be
asked
to
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
came
up
to
him
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
dance
.
I
have
a
protegee
,
the
young
Rostova
,
here
.
Ask
her
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
?
''
asked
Bolkonski
.
``
Excuse
me
!
''
he
added
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
baron
,
``
we
will
finish
this
conversation
elsewhere
--
at
a
ball
one
must
*NL*
dance
.
''
He
stepped
forward
in
the
direction
Pierre
indicated
.
The
*NL*
despairing
,
dejected
expression
of
Natasha
's
face
caught
his
eye
.
He
*NL*
recognized
her
,
guessed
her
feelings
,
saw
that
it
was
her
debut
,
*NL*
remembered
her
conversation
at
the
window
,
and
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
pleasure
on
his
face
approached
Countess
Rostova
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
daughter
,
''
said
the
countess
,
with
*NL*
heightened
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
pleasure
of
being
already
acquainted
,
if
the
countess
*NL*
remembers
me
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
low
and
courteous
bow
quite
*NL*
belying
Peronskaya
's
remarks
about
his
rudeness
,
and
approaching
Natasha
*NL*
he
held
out
his
arm
to
grasp
her
waist
before
he
had
completed
his
*NL*
invitation
.
He
asked
her
to
waltz
.
That
tremulous
expression
on
*NL*
Natasha
's
face
,
prepared
either
for
despair
or
rapture
,
suddenly
*NL*
brightened
into
a
happy
,
grateful
,
childlike
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
long
been
waiting
for
you
,
''
that
frightened
happy
little
girl
*NL*
seemed
to
say
by
the
smile
that
replaced
the
threatened
tears
,
as
she
*NL*
raised
her
hand
to
Prince
Andrew
's
shoulder
.
They
were
the
second
couple
*NL*
to
enter
the
circle
.
Prince
Andrew
was
one
of
the
best
dancers
of
his
*NL*
day
and
Natasha
danced
exquisitely
.
Her
little
feet
in
their
white
satin
*NL*
dancing
shoes
did
their
work
swiftly
,
lightly
,
and
independently
of
*NL*
herself
,
while
her
face
beamed
with
ecstatic
happiness
.
Her
slender
bare
*NL*
arms
and
neck
were
not
beautiful
--
compared
to
Helene
's
her
shoulders
*NL*
looked
thin
and
her
bosom
undeveloped
.
But
Helene
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
hardened
by
a
varnish
left
by
the
thousands
of
looks
that
had
scanned
*NL*
her
person
,
while
Natasha
was
like
a
girl
exposed
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
who
would
have
felt
very
much
ashamed
had
she
not
been
assured
that
this
*NL*
was
absolutely
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
liked
dancing
,
and
wishing
to
escape
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
from
the
political
and
clever
talk
which
everyone
addressed
to
*NL*
him
,
wishing
also
to
break
up
the
circle
of
restraint
he
disliked
,
*NL*
caused
by
the
Emperor
's
presence
,
he
danced
,
and
had
chosen
Natasha
*NL*
because
Pierre
pointed
her
out
to
him
and
because
she
was
the
first
*NL*
pretty
girl
who
caught
his
eye
;
but
scarcely
had
he
embraced
that
*NL*
slender
supple
figure
and
felt
her
stirring
so
close
to
him
and
smiling
*NL*
so
near
him
than
the
wine
of
her
charm
rose
to
his
head
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
himself
revived
and
rejuvenated
when
after
leaving
her
he
stood
*NL*
breathing
deeply
and
watching
the
other
dancers
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
After
Prince
Andrew
,
Boris
came
up
to
ask
Natasha
for
a
dance
,
and
then
*NL*
the
aide-de-camp
who
had
opened
the
ball
,
and
several
other
young
men
,
*NL*
so
that
,
flushed
and
happy
,
and
passing
on
her
superfluous
partners
to
*NL*
Sonya
,
she
did
not
cease
dancing
all
the
evening
.
She
noticed
and
saw
*NL*
nothing
of
what
occupied
everyone
else
.
Not
only
did
she
fail
to
notice
*NL*
that
the
Emperor
talked
a
long
time
with
the
French
ambassador
,
and
how
*NL*
particularly
gracious
he
was
to
a
certain
lady
,
or
that
Prince
So-and-so
*NL*
and
So-and-so
did
and
said
this
and
that
,
and
that
Helene
had
great
*NL*
success
and
was
honored
by
the
special
attention
of
So-and-so
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
even
see
the
Emperor
,
and
only
noticed
that
he
had
gone
because
*NL*
the
ball
became
livelier
after
his
departure
.
For
one
of
the
merry
*NL*
cotillions
before
supper
Prince
Andrew
was
again
her
partner
.
He
*NL*
reminded
her
of
their
first
encounter
in
the
Otradnoe
avenue
,
and
how
*NL*
she
had
been
unable
to
sleep
that
moonlight
night
,
and
told
her
how
he
*NL*
had
involuntarily
overheard
her
.
Natasha
blushed
at
that
recollection
*NL*
and
tried
to
excuse
herself
,
as
if
there
had
been
something
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
in
what
Prince
Andrew
had
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
men
who
have
grown
up
in
society
,
Prince
Andrew
liked
meeting
*NL*
someone
there
not
of
the
conventional
society
stamp
.
And
such
was
*NL*
Natasha
,
with
her
surprise
,
her
delight
,
her
shyness
,
and
even
her
*NL*
mistakes
in
speaking
French
.
With
her
he
behaved
with
special
care
and
*NL*
tenderness
,
sitting
beside
her
and
talking
of
the
simplest
and
most
*NL*
unimportant
matters
;
he
admired
her
shy
grace
.
In
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
cotillion
,
having
completed
one
of
the
figures
,
Natasha
,
still
out
of
*NL*
breath
,
was
returning
to
her
seat
when
another
dancer
chose
her
.
She
was
*NL*
tired
and
panting
and
evidently
thought
of
declining
,
but
immediately
*NL*
put
her
hand
gaily
on
the
man
's
shoulder
,
smiling
at
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
be
glad
to
sit
beside
you
and
rest
:
I
'm
tired
;
but
you
see
how
they
*NL*
keep
asking
me
,
and
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
I
'm
happy
and
I
love
everybody
,
and
*NL*
you
and
I
understand
it
all
,
''
and
much
,
much
more
was
said
in
her
smile
.
*NL*
When
her
partner
left
her
Natasha
ran
across
the
room
to
choose
two
*NL*
ladies
for
the
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
goes
to
her
cousin
first
and
then
to
another
lady
,
she
will
be
*NL*
my
wife
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
to
himself
quite
to
his
own
surprise
,
as
he
*NL*
watched
her
.
She
did
go
first
to
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
rubbish
sometimes
enters
one
's
head
!
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
``
but
*NL*
what
is
certain
is
that
that
girl
is
so
charming
,
so
original
,
that
she
*NL*
wo
n't
be
dancing
here
a
month
before
she
will
be
married
...
Such
as
she
*NL*
are
rare
here
,
''
he
thought
,
as
Natasha
,
readjusting
a
rose
that
was
*NL*
slipping
on
her
bodice
,
settled
herself
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cotillion
was
over
the
old
count
in
his
blue
coat
came
up
to
*NL*
the
dancers
.
He
invited
Prince
Andrew
to
come
and
see
them
,
and
asked
*NL*
his
daughter
whether
she
was
enjoying
herself
.
Natasha
did
not
answer
at
*NL*
once
but
only
looked
up
with
a
smile
that
said
reproachfully
:
``
How
can
*NL*
you
ask
such
a
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
before
!
''
she
said
,
and
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
noticed
how
her
thin
arms
rose
quickly
as
if
to
embrace
her
*NL*
father
and
instantly
dropped
again
.
Natasha
was
happier
than
she
had
*NL*
ever
been
in
her
life
.
She
was
at
that
height
of
bliss
when
one
becomes
*NL*
completely
kind
and
good
and
does
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
*NL*
evil
,
unhappiness
,
or
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
ball
Pierre
for
the
first
time
felt
humiliated
by
the
position
*NL*
his
wife
occupied
in
court
circles
.
He
was
gloomy
and
absent-minded
.
A
*NL*
deep
furrow
ran
across
his
forehead
,
and
standing
by
a
window
he
stared
*NL*
over
his
spectacles
seeing
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
way
to
supper
Natasha
passed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
gloomy
,
unhappy
look
struck
her
.
She
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
She
wished
to
help
him
,
to
bestow
on
him
the
superabundance
of
her
own
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
it
is
,
Count
!
''
said
she
.
``
Is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
smiled
absent-mindedly
,
evidently
not
grasping
what
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
very
glad
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
people
be
dissatisfied
with
anything
?
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
``
Especially
such
a
capital
fellow
as
Bezukhov
!
''
In
Natasha
's
eyes
all
*NL*
the
people
at
the
ball
alike
were
good
,
kind
,
and
splendid
people
,
*NL*
loving
one
another
;
none
of
them
capable
of
injuring
another
--
and
so
*NL*
they
ought
all
to
be
happy
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Prince
Andrew
thought
of
the
ball
,
but
his
mind
did
not
dwell
*NL*
on
it
long
.
``
Yes
,
it
was
a
very
brilliant
ball
,
''
and
then
...
``
Yes
,
that
*NL*
little
Rostova
is
very
charming
.
There
's
something
fresh
,
original
,
un
-
*NL*
Petersburg-like
about
her
that
distinguishes
her
.
''
That
was
all
he
*NL*
thought
about
yesterday
's
ball
,
and
after
his
morning
tea
he
set
to
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
either
from
fatigue
or
want
of
sleep
he
was
ill-disposed
for
work
*NL*
and
could
get
nothing
done
.
He
kept
criticizing
his
own
work
,
as
he
*NL*
often
did
,
and
was
glad
when
he
heard
someone
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitor
was
Bitski
,
who
served
on
various
committees
,
frequented
all
*NL*
the
societies
in
Petersburg
,
and
a
passionate
devotee
of
the
new
ideas
*NL*
and
of
Speranski
,
and
a
diligent
Petersburg
newsmonger
--
one
of
those
men
*NL*
who
choose
their
opinions
like
their
clothes
according
to
the
fashion
,
*NL*
but
who
for
that
very
reason
appear
to
be
the
warmest
partisans
.
Hardly
*NL*
had
he
got
rid
of
his
hat
before
he
ran
into
Prince
Andrew
's
room
with
a
*NL*
preoccupied
air
and
at
once
began
talking
.
He
had
just
heard
particulars
*NL*
of
that
morning
's
sitting
of
the
Council
of
State
opened
by
the
Emperor
,
*NL*
and
he
spoke
of
it
enthusiastically
.
The
Emperor
's
speech
had
been
*NL*
extraordinary
.
It
had
been
a
speech
such
as
only
constitutional
monarchs
*NL*
deliver
.
``
The
Sovereign
plainly
said
that
the
Council
and
Senate
are
*NL*
estates
of
the
realm
,
he
said
that
the
government
must
rest
not
on
*NL*
authority
but
on
secure
bases
.
The
Emperor
said
that
the
fiscal
system
*NL*
must
be
reorganized
and
the
accounts
published
,
''
recounted
Bitski
,
*NL*
emphasizing
certain
words
and
opening
his
eyes
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
Today
's
events
mark
an
epoch
,
the
greatest
epoch
in
our
*NL*
history
,
''
he
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
listened
to
the
account
of
the
opening
of
the
Council
of
*NL*
State
,
which
he
had
so
impatiently
awaited
and
to
which
he
had
attached
*NL*
such
importance
,
and
was
surprised
that
this
event
,
now
that
it
had
*NL*
taken
place
,
did
not
affect
him
,
and
even
seemed
quite
insignificant
.
He
*NL*
listened
with
quiet
irony
to
Bitski
's
enthusiastic
account
of
it
.
A
very
*NL*
simple
thought
occurred
to
him
:
``
What
does
it
matter
to
me
or
to
Bitski
*NL*
what
the
Emperor
was
pleased
to
say
at
the
Council
?
Can
all
that
make
me
*NL*
any
happier
or
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
simple
reflection
suddenly
destroyed
all
the
interest
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
had
felt
in
the
impending
reforms
.
He
was
going
to
dine
that
*NL*
evening
at
Speranski
's
,
``
with
only
a
few
friends
,
''
as
the
host
had
said
*NL*
when
inviting
him
.
The
prospect
of
that
dinner
in
the
intimate
home
*NL*
circle
of
the
man
he
so
admired
had
greatly
interested
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
especially
as
he
had
not
yet
seen
Speranski
in
his
domestic
*NL*
surroundings
,
but
now
he
felt
disinclined
to
go
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
hour
,
however
,
he
entered
the
modest
house
Speranski
*NL*
owned
in
the
Taurida
Gardens
.
In
the
parqueted
dining
room
this
small
*NL*
house
,
remarkable
for
its
extreme
cleanliness
-LRB-
suggesting
that
of
a
*NL*
monastery
-RRB-
,
Prince
Andrew
,
who
was
rather
late
,
found
the
friendly
*NL*
gathering
of
Speranski
's
intimate
acquaintances
already
assembled
at
*NL*
five
o'clock
.
There
were
no
ladies
present
except
Speranski
's
little
*NL*
daughter
-LRB-
long-faced
like
her
father
-RRB-
and
her
governess
.
The
other
*NL*
guests
were
Gervais
,
Magnitski
,
and
Stolypin
.
While
still
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
Prince
Andrew
heard
loud
voices
and
a
ringing
staccato
laugh
--
a
*NL*
laugh
such
as
one
hears
on
the
stage
.
Someone
--
it
sounded
like
*NL*
Speranski
--
was
distinctly
ejaculating
ha-ha-ha
.
Prince
Andrew
had
never
*NL*
before
heard
Speranski
's
famous
laugh
,
and
this
ringing
,
high-pitched
*NL*
laughter
from
a
statesman
made
a
strange
impression
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
dining
room
.
The
whole
company
were
standing
between
two
*NL*
windows
at
a
small
table
laid
with
hors-d'oeuvres
.
Speranski
,
wearing
a
*NL*
gray
swallow-tail
coat
with
a
star
on
the
breast
,
and
evidently
still
*NL*
the
same
waistcoat
and
high
white
stock
he
had
worn
at
the
meeting
of
*NL*
the
Council
of
State
,
stood
at
the
table
with
a
beaming
countenance
.
His
*NL*
guests
surrounded
him
.
Magnitski
,
addressing
himself
to
Speranski
,
was
*NL*
relating
an
anecdote
,
and
Speranski
was
laughing
in
advance
at
what
*NL*
Magnitski
was
going
to
say
.
When
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
room
*NL*
Magnitski
's
words
were
again
crowned
by
laughter
.
Stolypin
gave
a
deep
*NL*
bass
guffaw
as
he
munched
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
.
Gervais
laughed
*NL*
softly
with
a
hissing
chuckle
,
and
Speranski
in
a
high-pitched
staccato
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
laughing
,
Speranski
held
out
his
soft
white
hand
to
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pleased
to
see
you
,
Prince
,
''
he
said
.
``
One
moment
...
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
turning
to
Magnitski
and
interrupting
his
story
.
``
We
have
agreed
that
*NL*
this
is
a
dinner
for
recreation
,
with
not
a
word
about
business
!
''
and
*NL*
turning
again
to
the
narrator
he
began
to
laugh
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
the
laughing
Speranski
with
astonishment
,
*NL*
regret
,
and
disillusionment
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
this
was
not
*NL*
Speranski
but
someone
else
.
Everything
that
had
formerly
appeared
*NL*
mysterious
and
fascinating
in
Speranski
suddenly
became
plain
and
*NL*
unattractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
the
conversation
did
not
cease
for
a
moment
and
seemed
to
*NL*
consist
of
the
contents
of
a
book
of
funny
anecdotes
.
Before
Magnitski
*NL*
had
finished
his
story
someone
else
was
anxious
to
relate
something
*NL*
still
funnier
.
Most
of
the
anecdotes
,
if
not
relating
to
the
state
*NL*
service
,
related
to
people
in
the
service
.
It
seemed
that
in
this
*NL*
company
the
insignificance
of
those
people
was
so
definitely
accepted
*NL*
that
the
only
possible
attitude
toward
them
was
one
of
good
humored
*NL*
ridicule
.
Speranski
related
how
at
the
Council
that
morning
a
deaf
*NL*
dignitary
,
when
asked
his
opinion
,
replied
that
he
thought
so
too
.
*NL*
Gervais
gave
a
long
account
of
an
official
revision
,
remarkable
for
the
*NL*
stupidity
of
everybody
concerned
.
Stolypin
,
stuttering
,
broke
into
the
*NL*
conversation
and
began
excitedly
talking
of
the
abuses
that
existed
*NL*
under
the
former
order
of
things
--
threatening
to
give
a
serious
turn
to
*NL*
the
conversation
.
Magnitski
starting
quizzing
Stolypin
about
his
*NL*
vehemence
.
Gervais
intervened
with
a
joke
,
and
the
talk
reverted
to
its
*NL*
former
lively
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Speranski
liked
to
rest
after
his
labors
and
find
amusement
in
*NL*
a
circle
of
friends
,
and
his
guests
,
understanding
his
wish
,
tried
to
*NL*
enliven
him
and
amuse
themselves
.
But
their
gaiety
seemed
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
mirthless
and
tiresome
.
Speranski
's
high-pitched
voice
struck
him
*NL*
unpleasantly
,
and
the
incessant
laughter
grated
on
him
like
a
false
*NL*
note
.
Prince
Andrew
did
not
laugh
and
feared
that
he
would
be
a
damper
*NL*
on
the
spirits
of
the
company
,
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
his
being
*NL*
out
of
harmony
with
the
general
mood
.
They
all
seemed
very
gay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
several
times
to
join
in
the
conversation
,
but
his
remarks
were
*NL*
tossed
aside
each
time
like
a
cork
thrown
out
of
the
water
,
and
he
could
*NL*
not
jest
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
wrong
or
unseemly
in
what
they
said
,
it
was
witty
and
*NL*
might
have
been
funny
,
but
it
lacked
just
that
something
which
is
the
*NL*
salt
of
mirth
,
and
they
were
not
even
aware
that
such
a
thing
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Speranski
's
daughter
and
her
governess
rose
.
He
patted
the
*NL*
little
girl
with
his
white
hand
and
kissed
her
.
And
that
gesture
,
too
,
*NL*
seemed
unnatural
to
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
remained
at
table
over
their
port
--
English
fashion
.
In
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
conversation
that
was
started
about
Napoleon
's
Spanish
affairs
,
*NL*
which
they
all
agreed
in
approving
,
Prince
Andrew
began
to
express
a
*NL*
contrary
opinion
.
Speranski
smiled
and
,
with
an
evident
wish
to
prevent
*NL*
the
conversation
from
taking
an
unpleasant
course
,
told
a
story
that
had
*NL*
no
connection
with
the
previous
conversation
.
For
a
few
moments
all
were
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sat
some
time
at
table
,
Speranski
corked
a
bottle
of
wine
and
,
*NL*
remarking
,
``
Nowadays
good
wine
rides
in
a
carriage
and
pair
,
''
passed
it
*NL*
to
the
servant
and
got
up
.
All
rose
and
continuing
to
talk
loudly
went
*NL*
into
the
drawing
room
.
Two
letters
brought
by
a
courier
were
handed
to
*NL*
Speranski
and
he
took
them
to
his
study
.
As
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
*NL*
the
general
merriment
stopped
and
the
guests
began
to
converse
sensibly
*NL*
and
quietly
with
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
the
recitation
!
''
said
Speranski
on
returning
from
his
study
.
``
A
*NL*
wonderful
talent
!
''
he
said
to
Prince
Andrew
,
and
Magnitski
immediately
*NL*
assumed
a
pose
and
began
reciting
some
humorous
verses
in
French
which
*NL*
he
had
composed
about
various
well-known
Petersburg
people
.
He
was
*NL*
interrupted
several
times
by
applause
.
When
the
verses
were
finished
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
up
to
Speranski
and
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
so
early
?
''
asked
Speranski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
go
to
a
reception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
said
no
more
.
Prince
Andrew
looked
closely
into
those
mirrorlike
,
*NL*
impenetrable
eyes
,
and
felt
that
it
had
been
ridiculous
of
him
to
have
*NL*
expected
anything
from
Speranski
and
from
any
of
his
own
activities
*NL*
connected
with
him
,
or
ever
to
have
attributed
importance
to
what
*NL*
Speranski
was
doing
.
That
precise
,
mirthless
laughter
rang
in
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
ears
long
after
he
had
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
home
Prince
Andrew
began
thinking
of
his
life
in
*NL*
Petersburg
during
those
last
four
months
as
if
it
were
something
new
.
He
*NL*
recalled
his
exertions
and
solicitations
,
and
the
history
of
his
project
*NL*
of
army
reform
,
which
had
been
accepted
for
consideration
and
which
they
*NL*
were
trying
to
pass
over
in
silence
simply
because
another
,
a
very
poor
*NL*
one
,
had
already
been
prepared
and
submitted
to
the
Emperor
.
He
thought
*NL*
of
the
meetings
of
a
committee
of
which
Berg
was
a
member
.
He
remembered
*NL*
how
carefully
and
at
what
length
everything
relating
to
form
and
*NL*
procedure
was
discussed
at
those
meetings
,
and
how
sedulously
and
*NL*
promptly
all
that
related
to
the
gist
of
the
business
was
evaded
.
He
*NL*
recalled
his
labors
on
the
Legal
Code
,
and
how
painstakingly
he
had
*NL*
translated
the
articles
of
the
Roman
and
French
codes
into
Russian
,
and
*NL*
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
.
Then
he
vividly
pictured
to
himself
*NL*
Bogucharovo
,
his
occupations
in
the
country
,
his
journey
to
Ryazan
;
he
*NL*
remembered
the
peasants
and
Dron
the
village
elder
,
and
mentally
*NL*
applying
to
them
the
Personal
Rights
he
had
divided
into
paragraphs
,
he
*NL*
felt
astonished
that
he
could
have
spent
so
much
time
on
such
useless
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Prince
Andrew
called
at
a
few
houses
he
had
not
visited
before
,
*NL*
and
among
them
at
the
Rostovs
'
with
whom
he
had
renewed
acquaintance
at
*NL*
the
ball
.
Apart
from
considerations
of
politeness
which
demanded
the
*NL*
call
,
he
wanted
to
see
that
original
,
eager
girl
who
had
left
such
a
*NL*
pleasant
impression
on
his
mind
,
in
her
own
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
one
of
the
first
to
meet
him
.
She
was
wearing
a
dark-blue
*NL*
house
dress
in
which
Prince
Andrew
thought
her
even
prettier
than
in
her
*NL*
ball
dress
.
She
and
all
the
Rostov
family
welcomed
him
as
an
old
friend
,
*NL*
simply
and
cordially
.
The
whole
family
,
whom
he
had
formerly
judged
*NL*
severely
,
now
seemed
to
him
to
consist
of
excellent
,
simple
,
and
kindly
*NL*
people
.
The
old
count
's
hospitality
and
good
nature
,
which
struck
one
*NL*
especially
in
Petersburg
as
a
pleasant
surprise
,
were
such
that
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
could
not
refuse
to
stay
to
dinner
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
thought
,
``
they
are
*NL*
capital
people
,
who
of
course
have
not
the
slightest
idea
what
a
*NL*
treasure
they
possess
in
Natasha
;
but
they
are
kindly
folk
and
form
the
*NL*
best
possible
setting
for
this
strikingly
poetic
,
charming
girl
,
*NL*
overflowing
with
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Natasha
Prince
Andrew
was
conscious
of
a
strange
world
completely
*NL*
alien
to
him
and
brimful
of
joys
unknown
to
him
,
a
different
world
,
that
*NL*
in
the
Otradnoe
avenue
and
at
the
window
that
moonlight
night
had
*NL*
already
begun
to
disconcert
him
.
Now
this
world
disconcerted
him
no
*NL*
longer
and
was
no
longer
alien
to
him
,
but
he
himself
having
entered
it
*NL*
found
in
it
a
new
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Natasha
,
at
Prince
Andrew
's
request
,
went
to
the
clavichord
*NL*
and
began
singing
.
Prince
Andrew
stood
by
a
window
talking
to
the
ladies
*NL*
and
listened
to
her
.
In
the
midst
of
a
phrase
he
ceased
speaking
and
*NL*
suddenly
felt
tears
choking
him
,
a
thing
he
had
thought
impossible
for
*NL*
him
.
He
looked
at
Natasha
as
she
sang
,
and
something
new
and
joyful
*NL*
stirred
in
his
soul
.
He
felt
happy
and
at
the
same
time
sad
.
He
had
*NL*
absolutely
nothing
to
weep
about
yet
he
was
ready
to
weep
.
What
about
?
*NL*
His
former
love
?
The
little
princess
?
His
disillusionments
?
...
His
hopes
*NL*
for
the
future
?
...
Yes
and
no
.
The
chief
reason
was
a
sudden
,
vivid
*NL*
sense
of
the
terrible
contrast
between
something
infinitely
great
and
*NL*
illimitable
within
him
and
that
limited
and
material
something
that
he
,
*NL*
and
even
she
,
was
.
This
contrast
weighed
on
and
yet
cheered
him
while
*NL*
she
sang
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Natasha
had
finished
she
went
up
to
him
and
asked
how
he
*NL*
liked
her
voice
.
She
asked
this
and
then
became
confused
,
feeling
that
*NL*
she
ought
not
to
have
asked
it
.
He
smiled
,
looking
at
her
,
and
said
he
*NL*
liked
her
singing
as
he
liked
everything
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
left
the
Rostovs
'
late
in
the
evening
.
He
went
to
bed
from
*NL*
habit
,
but
soon
realized
that
he
could
not
sleep
.
Having
lit
his
candle
*NL*
he
sat
up
in
bed
,
then
got
up
,
then
lay
down
again
not
at
all
troubled
*NL*
by
his
sleeplessness
:
his
soul
was
as
fresh
and
joyful
as
if
he
had
*NL*
stepped
out
of
a
stuffy
room
into
God
's
own
fresh
air
.
It
did
not
enter
*NL*
his
head
that
he
was
in
love
with
Natasha
;
he
was
not
thinking
about
*NL*
her
,
but
only
picturing
her
to
himself
,
and
in
consequence
all
life
*NL*
appeared
in
a
new
light
.
``
Why
do
I
strive
,
why
do
I
toil
in
this
narrow
,
*NL*
confined
frame
,
when
life
,
all
life
with
all
its
joys
,
is
open
to
me
?
''
*NL*
said
he
to
himself
.
And
for
the
first
time
for
a
very
long
while
he
*NL*
began
making
happy
plans
for
the
future
.
He
decided
that
he
must
attend
*NL*
to
his
son
's
education
by
finding
a
tutor
and
putting
the
boy
in
his
*NL*
charge
,
then
he
ought
to
retire
from
the
service
and
go
abroad
,
and
see
*NL*
England
,
Switzerland
and
Italy
.
``
I
must
use
my
freedom
while
I
feel
so
*NL*
much
strength
and
youth
in
me
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Pierre
was
right
*NL*
when
he
said
one
must
believe
in
the
possibility
of
happiness
in
order
*NL*
to
be
happy
,
and
now
I
do
believe
in
it
.
Let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
,
*NL*
but
while
one
has
life
one
must
live
and
be
happy
!
''
thought
he
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
Colonel
Berg
,
whom
Pierre
knew
as
he
knew
everybody
in
*NL*
Moscow
and
Petersburg
,
came
to
see
him
.
Berg
arrived
in
an
immaculate
*NL*
brand-new
uniform
,
with
his
hair
pomaded
and
brushed
forward
over
his
*NL*
temples
as
the
Emperor
Alexander
wore
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
been
to
see
the
countess
,
your
wife
.
Unfortunately
she
*NL*
could
not
grant
my
request
,
but
I
hope
,
Count
,
I
shall
be
more
fortunate
*NL*
with
you
,
''
he
said
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
wish
,
Colonel
?
I
am
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
now
quite
settled
in
my
new
rooms
,
Count
''
-LRB-
Berg
said
this
with
*NL*
perfect
conviction
that
this
information
could
not
but
be
agreeable
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
and
so
I
wish
to
arrange
just
a
small
party
for
my
own
and
my
wife
's
*NL*
friends
.
''
-LRB-
He
smiled
still
more
pleasantly
.
-RRB-
``
I
wished
to
ask
the
*NL*
countess
and
you
to
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
to
tea
and
to
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Countess
Helene
,
considering
the
society
of
such
people
as
the
*NL*
Bergs
beneath
her
,
could
be
cruel
enough
to
refuse
such
an
invitation
.
*NL*
Berg
explained
so
clearly
why
he
wanted
to
collect
at
his
house
a
small
*NL*
but
select
company
,
and
why
this
would
give
him
pleasure
,
and
why
though
*NL*
he
grudged
spending
money
on
cards
or
anything
harmful
,
he
was
prepared
*NL*
to
run
into
some
expense
for
the
sake
of
good
society
--
that
Pierre
could
*NL*
not
refuse
,
and
promised
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
be
late
,
Count
,
if
I
may
venture
to
ask
;
about
ten
minutes
to
*NL*
eight
,
please
.
We
shall
make
up
a
rubber
.
Our
general
is
coming
.
He
is
*NL*
very
good
to
me
.
We
shall
have
supper
,
Count
.
So
you
will
do
me
the
*NL*
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Contrary
to
his
habit
of
being
late
,
Pierre
on
that
day
arrived
at
the
*NL*
Bergs
'
house
,
not
at
ten
but
at
fifteen
minutes
to
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
prepared
everything
necessary
for
the
party
,
the
Bergs
were
ready
*NL*
for
their
guests
'
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
new
,
clean
,
and
light
study
with
its
small
busts
and
pictures
*NL*
and
new
furniture
sat
Berg
and
his
wife
.
Berg
,
closely
buttoned
up
in
*NL*
his
new
uniform
,
sat
beside
his
wife
explaining
to
her
that
one
always
*NL*
could
and
should
be
acquainted
with
people
above
one
,
because
only
then
*NL*
does
one
get
satisfaction
from
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
get
to
know
something
,
you
can
ask
for
something
.
See
how
I
*NL*
managed
from
my
first
promotion
.
''
-LRB-
Berg
measured
his
life
not
by
years
*NL*
but
by
promotions
.
-RRB-
``
My
comrades
are
still
nobodies
,
while
I
am
only
*NL*
waiting
for
a
vacancy
to
command
a
regiment
,
and
have
the
happiness
to
*NL*
be
your
husband
.
''
-LRB-
He
rose
and
kissed
Vera
's
hand
,
and
on
the
way
to
her
*NL*
straightened
out
a
turned-up
corner
of
the
carpet
.
-RRB-
``
And
how
have
I
*NL*
obtained
all
this
?
Chiefly
by
knowing
how
to
choose
my
aquaintances
.
It
*NL*
goes
without
saying
that
one
must
be
conscientious
and
methodical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
smiled
with
a
sense
of
his
superiority
over
a
weak
woman
,
and
*NL*
paused
,
reflecting
that
this
dear
wife
of
his
was
after
all
but
a
weak
*NL*
woman
who
could
not
understand
all
that
constitutes
a
man
's
dignity
,
*NL*
what
it
was
ein
Mann
zu
sein
.
*
Vera
at
the
same
time
smiling
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
superiority
over
her
good
,
conscientious
husband
,
who
all
the
*NL*
same
understood
life
wrongly
,
as
according
to
Vera
all
men
did
.
Berg
,
*NL*
judging
by
his
wife
,
thought
all
women
weak
and
foolish
.
Vera
,
judging
*NL*
only
by
her
husband
and
generalizing
from
that
observation
,
supposed
*NL*
that
all
men
,
though
they
understand
nothing
and
are
conceited
and
*NL*
selfish
,
ascribe
common
sense
to
themselves
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
be
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
rose
and
embraced
his
wife
carefully
,
so
as
not
to
crush
her
lace
*NL*
fichu
for
which
he
had
paid
a
good
price
,
kissing
her
straight
on
the
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
is
,
we
must
n't
have
children
too
soon
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
following
an
unconscious
sequence
of
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Vera
,
``
I
do
n't
at
all
want
that
.
We
must
live
for
*NL*
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
Yusupova
wore
one
exactly
like
this
,
''
said
Berg
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
fichu
with
a
happy
and
kindly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Count
Bezukhov
was
announced
.
Husband
and
wife
glanced
at
one
*NL*
another
,
both
smiling
with
self-satisfaction
,
and
each
mentally
claiming
*NL*
the
honor
of
this
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
make
acquaintances
,
''
thought
Berg
.
*NL*
``
This
is
what
comes
of
knowing
how
to
conduct
oneself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
please
do
n't
interrupt
me
when
I
am
entertaining
the
guests
,
''
said
*NL*
Vera
,
``
because
I
know
what
interests
each
of
them
and
what
to
say
to
*NL*
different
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
smiled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
helped
:
men
must
sometimes
have
masculine
conversation
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
received
Pierre
in
their
small
,
new
drawing-room
,
where
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
sit
down
anywhere
without
disturbing
its
symmetry
,
*NL*
neatness
,
and
order
;
so
it
was
quite
comprehensible
and
not
strange
that
*NL*
Berg
,
having
generously
offered
to
disturb
the
symmetry
of
an
armchair
*NL*
or
of
the
sofa
for
his
dear
guest
,
but
being
apparently
painfully
*NL*
undecided
on
the
matter
himself
,
eventually
left
the
visitor
to
settle
*NL*
the
question
of
selection
.
Pierre
disturbed
the
symmetry
by
moving
a
*NL*
chair
for
himself
,
and
Berg
and
Vera
immediately
began
their
evening
*NL*
party
,
interrupting
each
other
in
their
efforts
to
entertain
their
*NL*
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vera
,
having
decided
in
her
own
mind
that
Pierre
ought
to
be
entertained
*NL*
with
conversation
about
the
French
embassy
,
at
once
began
accordingly
.
*NL*
Berg
,
having
decided
that
masculine
conversation
was
required
,
*NL*
interrupted
his
wife
's
remarks
and
touched
on
the
question
of
the
war
*NL*
with
Austria
,
and
unconsciously
jumped
from
the
general
subject
to
*NL*
personal
considerations
as
to
the
proposals
made
him
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
Austrian
campaign
and
the
reasons
why
he
had
declined
them
.
Though
the
*NL*
conversation
was
very
incoherent
and
Vera
was
angry
at
the
intrusion
of
*NL*
the
masculine
element
,
both
husband
and
wife
felt
with
satisfaction
*NL*
that
,
even
if
only
one
guest
was
present
,
their
evening
had
begun
very
*NL*
well
and
was
as
like
as
two
peas
to
every
other
evening
party
with
its
*NL*
talk
,
tea
,
and
lighted
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
long
Boris
,
Berg
's
old
comrade
,
arrived
.
There
was
a
shade
of
*NL*
condescension
and
patronage
in
his
treatment
of
Berg
and
Vera
.
After
*NL*
Boris
came
a
lady
with
the
colonel
,
then
the
general
himself
,
then
the
*NL*
Rostovs
,
and
the
party
became
unquestionably
exactly
like
all
other
*NL*
evening
parties
.
Berg
and
Vera
could
not
repress
their
smiles
of
*NL*
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
all
this
movement
in
their
drawing
room
,
at
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
disconnected
talk
,
the
rustling
of
dresses
,
and
the
*NL*
bowing
and
scraping
.
Everything
was
just
as
everybody
always
has
it
,
*NL*
especially
so
the
general
,
who
admired
the
apartment
,
patted
Berg
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
with
parental
authority
superintended
the
setting
out
of
*NL*
the
table
for
boston
.
The
general
sat
down
by
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
who
was
*NL*
next
to
himself
the
most
important
guest
.
The
old
people
sat
with
the
*NL*
old
,
the
young
with
the
young
,
and
the
hostess
at
the
tea
table
,
on
*NL*
which
stood
exactly
the
same
kind
of
cakes
in
a
silver
cake
basket
as
*NL*
the
Panins
had
at
their
party
.
Everything
was
just
as
it
was
everywhere
*NL*
else
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
as
one
of
the
principal
guests
,
had
to
sit
down
to
boston
with
*NL*
Count
Rostov
,
the
general
,
and
the
colonel
.
At
the
card
table
he
*NL*
happened
to
be
directly
facing
Natasha
,
and
was
struck
by
a
curious
*NL*
change
that
had
come
over
her
since
the
ball
.
She
was
silent
,
and
not
*NL*
only
less
pretty
than
at
the
ball
,
but
only
redeemed
from
plainness
by
*NL*
her
look
of
gentle
indifference
to
everything
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
her
?
''
thought
Pierre
,
glancing
at
her
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
by
her
sister
at
the
tea
table
,
and
reluctantly
,
without
looking
*NL*
at
him
,
made
some
reply
to
Boris
who
sat
down
beside
her
.
After
playing
*NL*
out
a
whole
suit
and
to
his
partner
's
delight
taking
five
tricks
,
*NL*
Pierre
,
hearing
greetings
and
the
steps
of
someone
who
had
entered
the
*NL*
room
while
he
was
picking
up
his
tricks
,
glanced
again
at
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
to
her
?
''
he
asked
himself
with
still
greater
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
standing
before
her
,
saying
something
to
her
with
a
*NL*
look
of
tender
solicitude
.
She
,
having
raised
her
head
,
was
looking
up
*NL*
at
him
,
flushed
and
evidently
trying
to
master
her
rapid
breathing
.
And
*NL*
the
bright
glow
of
some
inner
fire
that
had
been
suppressed
was
again
*NL*
alight
in
her
.
She
was
completely
transformed
and
from
a
plain
girl
had
*NL*
again
become
what
she
had
been
at
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
went
up
to
Pierre
,
and
the
latter
noticed
a
new
and
*NL*
youthful
expression
in
his
friend
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
changed
places
several
times
during
the
game
,
sitting
now
with
*NL*
his
back
to
Natasha
and
now
facing
her
,
but
during
the
whole
of
the
six
*NL*
rubbers
he
watched
her
and
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
very
important
is
happening
between
them
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
*NL*
and
a
feeling
that
was
both
joyful
and
painful
agitated
him
and
made
him
*NL*
neglect
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
six
rubbers
the
general
got
up
,
saying
that
it
was
no
use
playing
*NL*
like
that
,
and
Pierre
was
released
.
Natasha
on
one
side
was
talking
with
*NL*
Sonya
and
Boris
,
and
Vera
with
a
subtle
smile
was
saying
something
to
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
Pierre
went
up
to
his
friend
and
,
asking
whether
they
*NL*
were
talking
secrets
,
sat
down
beside
them
.
Vera
,
having
noticed
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
attentions
to
Natasha
,
decided
that
at
a
party
,
a
real
evening
*NL*
party
,
subtle
allusions
to
the
tender
passion
were
absolutely
necessary
*NL*
and
,
seizing
a
moment
when
Prince
Andrew
was
alone
,
began
a
conversation
*NL*
with
him
about
feelings
in
general
and
about
her
sister
.
With
so
*NL*
intellectual
a
guest
as
she
considered
Prince
Andrew
to
be
,
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
had
to
employ
her
diplomatic
tact
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
went
up
to
them
he
noticed
that
Vera
was
being
carried
away
*NL*
by
her
self-satisfied
talk
,
but
that
Prince
Andrew
seemed
embarrassed
,
a
*NL*
thing
that
rarely
happened
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
?
''
Vera
was
saying
with
an
arch
smile
.
``
You
are
so
*NL*
discerning
,
Prince
,
and
understand
people
's
characters
so
well
at
a
*NL*
glance
.
What
do
you
think
of
Natalie
?
Could
she
be
constant
in
her
*NL*
attachments
?
Could
she
,
like
other
women
''
-LRB-
Vera
meant
herself
-RRB-
,
``
love
a
*NL*
man
once
for
all
and
remain
true
to
him
forever
?
That
is
what
I
consider
*NL*
true
love
.
What
do
you
think
,
Prince
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
sister
too
little
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
with
a
sarcastic
*NL*
smile
under
which
he
wished
to
hide
his
embarrassment
,
``
to
be
able
to
*NL*
solve
so
delicate
a
question
,
and
then
I
have
noticed
that
the
less
*NL*
attractive
a
woman
is
the
more
constant
she
is
likely
to
be
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
and
looked
up
at
Pierre
who
was
just
approaching
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
true
,
Prince
.
In
our
days
,
''
continued
Vera
--
mentioning
*NL*
``
our
days
''
as
people
of
limited
intelligence
are
fond
of
doing
,
*NL*
imagining
that
they
have
discovered
and
appraised
the
peculiarities
of
*NL*
``
our
days
''
and
that
human
characteristics
change
with
the
times
--
``
in
our
*NL*
days
a
girl
has
so
much
freedom
that
the
pleasure
of
being
courted
often
*NL*
stifles
real
feeling
in
her
.
And
it
must
be
confessed
that
Natalie
is
*NL*
very
susceptible
.
''
This
return
to
the
subject
of
Natalie
caused
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
to
knit
his
brows
with
discomfort
:
he
was
about
to
rise
,
but
Vera
*NL*
continued
with
a
still
more
subtle
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
no
one
has
been
more
courted
than
she
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
but
till
*NL*
quite
lately
she
never
cared
seriously
for
anyone
.
Now
you
know
,
Count
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
Pierre
,
``
even
our
dear
cousin
Boris
,
who
,
between
ourselves
,
*NL*
was
very
far
gone
in
the
land
of
tenderness
...
''
-LRB-
alluding
to
a
map
of
*NL*
love
much
in
vogue
at
that
time
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
frowned
and
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
friendly
with
Boris
,
are
n't
you
?
''
asked
Vera
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
he
has
told
you
of
his
childish
love
for
Natasha
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
was
childish
love
?
''
suddenly
asked
Prince
Andrew
,
blushing
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
know
between
cousins
intimacy
often
leads
to
love
.
Le
*NL*
cousinage
est
un
dangereux
voisinage
.
*
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Cousinhood
is
a
dangerous
neighborhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
undoubtedly
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
and
with
sudden
and
unnatural
*NL*
liveliness
he
began
chaffing
Pierre
about
the
need
to
be
very
careful
*NL*
with
his
fifty-year-old
Moscow
cousins
,
and
in
the
midst
of
these
*NL*
jesting
remarks
he
rose
,
taking
Pierre
by
the
arm
,
and
drew
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
seeing
his
friend
's
strange
animation
with
*NL*
surprise
,
and
noticing
the
glance
he
turned
on
Natasha
as
he
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
...
I
must
have
a
talk
with
you
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
You
know
*NL*
that
pair
of
women
's
gloves
?
''
-LRB-
He
referred
to
the
masonic
gloves
given
*NL*
to
a
newly
initiated
Brother
to
present
to
the
woman
he
loved
.
-RRB-
``
I.
.
.
*NL*
but
no
,
I
will
talk
to
you
later
on
,
''
and
with
a
strange
light
in
his
*NL*
eyes
and
restlessness
in
his
movements
,
Prince
Andrew
approached
Natasha
*NL*
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
Pierre
saw
how
Prince
Andrew
asked
her
*NL*
something
and
how
she
flushed
as
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
Berg
came
to
Pierre
and
began
insisting
that
he
*NL*
should
take
part
in
an
argument
between
the
general
and
the
colonel
on
*NL*
the
affairs
in
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
was
satisfied
and
happy
.
The
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
his
face
.
*NL*
The
party
was
very
successful
and
quite
like
other
parties
he
had
seen
.
*NL*
Everything
was
similar
:
the
ladies
'
subtle
talk
,
the
cards
,
the
general
*NL*
raising
his
voice
at
the
card
table
,
and
the
samovar
and
the
tea
cakes
;
*NL*
only
one
thing
was
lacking
that
he
had
always
seen
at
the
evening
*NL*
parties
he
wished
to
imitate
.
They
had
not
yet
had
a
loud
conversation
*NL*
among
the
men
and
a
dispute
about
something
important
and
clever
.
Now
*NL*
the
general
had
begun
such
a
discussion
and
so
Berg
drew
Pierre
to
it
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
having
been
invited
by
the
count
,
Prince
Andrew
dined
with
the
*NL*
Rostovs
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
in
the
house
realized
for
whose
sake
Prince
Andrew
came
,
and
*NL*
without
concealing
it
he
tried
to
be
with
Natasha
all
day
.
Not
only
in
*NL*
the
soul
of
the
frightened
yet
happy
and
enraptured
Natasha
,
but
in
the
*NL*
whole
house
,
there
was
a
feeling
of
awe
at
something
important
that
was
*NL*
bound
to
happen
.
The
countess
looked
with
sad
and
sternly
serious
eyes
*NL*
at
Prince
Andrew
when
he
talked
to
Natasha
and
timidly
started
some
*NL*
artificial
conversation
about
trifles
as
soon
as
he
looked
her
way
.
*NL*
Sonya
was
afraid
to
leave
Natasha
and
afraid
of
being
in
the
way
when
*NL*
she
was
with
them
.
Natasha
grew
pale
,
in
a
panic
of
expectation
,
when
*NL*
she
remained
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
.
Prince
Andrew
surprised
her
by
*NL*
his
timidity
.
She
felt
that
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
her
but
could
*NL*
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
Prince
Andrew
had
left
,
the
countess
went
up
to
*NL*
Natasha
and
whispered
:
``
Well
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
For
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
ask
me
anything
now
!
One
ca
n't
talk
*NL*
about
that
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
the
same
that
night
Natasha
,
now
agitated
and
now
frightened
,
*NL*
lay
a
long
time
in
her
mother
's
bed
gazing
straight
before
her
.
She
told
*NL*
her
how
he
had
complimented
her
,
how
he
told
her
he
was
going
abroad
,
*NL*
asked
her
where
they
were
going
to
spend
the
summer
,
and
then
how
he
had
*NL*
asked
her
about
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
such
a.
.
.
such
a.
.
.
never
happened
to
me
before
!
''
she
said
.
``
Only
I
*NL*
feel
afraid
in
his
presence
.
I
am
always
afraid
when
I
'm
with
him
.
What
*NL*
does
that
mean
?
Does
it
mean
that
it
's
the
real
thing
?
Yes
?
Mamma
,
are
*NL*
you
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
love
;
I
am
frightened
myself
,
''
answered
her
mother
.
``
Now
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
I
sha
n't
sleep
.
What
silliness
,
to
sleep
!
Mummy
!
Mummy
!
*NL*
such
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
,
''
she
said
,
surprised
and
*NL*
alarmed
at
the
feeling
she
was
aware
of
in
herself
.
``
And
could
we
ever
*NL*
have
thought
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Natasha
that
even
at
the
time
she
first
saw
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
at
Otradnoe
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
.
It
was
as
if
she
feared
*NL*
this
strange
,
unexpected
happiness
of
meeting
again
the
very
man
she
had
*NL*
then
chosen
-LRB-
she
was
firmly
convinced
she
had
done
so
-RRB-
and
of
finding
*NL*
him
,
as
it
seemed
,
not
indifferent
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
had
to
happen
that
he
should
come
specially
to
Petersburg
while
*NL*
we
are
here
.
And
it
had
to
happen
that
we
should
meet
at
that
ball
.
It
*NL*
is
fate
.
Clearly
it
is
fate
that
everything
led
up
to
this
!
Already
*NL*
then
,
directly
I
saw
him
I
felt
something
peculiar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
did
he
say
to
you
?
What
are
those
verses
?
Read
them
...
''
said
*NL*
her
mother
,
thoughtfully
,
referring
to
some
verses
Prince
Andrew
had
*NL*
written
in
Natasha
's
album
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
one
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
being
a
widower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Natasha
!
Pray
to
God
.
`
Marriages
are
made
in
heaven
,
'
''
said
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darling
Mummy
,
how
I
love
you
!
How
happy
I
am
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
shedding
*NL*
tears
of
joy
and
excitement
and
embracing
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
very
time
Prince
Andrew
was
sitting
with
Pierre
and
telling
him
*NL*
of
his
love
for
Natasha
and
his
firm
resolve
to
make
her
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
Countess
Helene
had
a
reception
at
her
house
.
The
French
*NL*
ambassador
was
there
,
and
a
foreign
prince
of
the
blood
who
had
of
late
*NL*
become
a
frequent
visitor
of
hers
,
and
many
brilliant
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
.
Pierre
,
who
had
come
downstairs
,
walked
through
the
rooms
and
*NL*
struck
everyone
by
his
preoccupied
,
absent-minded
,
and
morose
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
ball
he
had
felt
the
approach
of
a
fit
of
nervous
depression
*NL*
and
had
made
desperate
efforts
to
combat
it
.
Since
the
intimacy
of
his
*NL*
wife
with
the
royal
prince
,
Pierre
had
unexpectedly
been
made
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
,
and
from
that
time
he
had
begun
to
feel
*NL*
oppressed
and
ashamed
in
court
society
,
and
dark
thoughts
of
the
vanity
*NL*
of
all
things
human
came
to
him
oftener
than
before
.
At
the
same
time
*NL*
the
feeling
he
had
noticed
between
his
protegee
Natasha
and
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
accentuated
his
gloom
by
the
contrast
between
his
own
position
*NL*
and
his
friend
's
.
He
tried
equally
to
avoid
thinking
about
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
about
Natasha
and
Prince
Andrew
;
and
again
everything
seemed
to
him
*NL*
insignificant
in
comparison
with
eternity
;
again
the
question
:
for
what
?
*NL*
presented
itself
;
and
he
forced
himself
to
work
day
and
night
at
masonic
*NL*
labors
,
hoping
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirit
that
threatened
him
.
Toward
*NL*
midnight
,
after
he
had
left
the
countess
'
apartments
,
he
was
sitting
*NL*
upstairs
in
a
shabby
dressing
gown
,
copying
out
the
original
transaction
*NL*
of
the
Scottish
lodge
of
Freemasons
at
a
table
in
his
low
room
cloudy
*NL*
with
tobacco
smoke
,
when
someone
came
in
.
It
was
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
you
!
''
said
Pierre
with
a
preoccupied
,
dissatisfied
air
.
``
And
*NL*
I
,
you
see
,
am
hard
at
it
.
''
He
pointed
to
his
manuscript
book
with
that
*NL*
air
of
escaping
from
the
ills
of
life
with
which
unhappy
people
look
at
*NL*
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
with
a
beaming
,
ecstatic
expression
of
renewed
life
on
*NL*
his
face
,
paused
in
front
of
Pierre
and
,
not
noticing
his
sad
look
,
*NL*
smiled
at
him
with
the
egotism
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
heart
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
yesterday
*NL*
and
I
have
come
to
do
so
today
.
I
never
experienced
anything
like
it
*NL*
before
.
I
am
in
love
,
my
friend
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Pierre
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
dumped
his
heavy
person
down
on
*NL*
the
sofa
beside
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Natasha
Rostova
,
yes
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
Who
else
should
it
be
?
I
should
never
have
believed
it
,
but
*NL*
the
feeling
is
stronger
than
I.
Yesterday
I
tormented
myself
and
*NL*
suffered
,
but
I
would
not
exchange
even
that
torment
for
anything
in
the
*NL*
world
,
I
have
not
lived
till
now
.
At
last
I
live
,
but
I
ca
n't
live
*NL*
without
her
!
But
can
she
love
me
?
...
I
am
too
old
for
her
...
Why
do
n't
*NL*
you
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
?
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Pierre
suddenly
,
rising
and
beginning
*NL*
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
.
``
I
always
thought
it
...
That
girl
is
such
*NL*
a
treasure
...
she
is
a
rare
girl
...
My
dear
friend
,
I
entreat
you
,
*NL*
do
n't
philosophize
,
do
n't
doubt
,
marry
,
marry
,
marry
...
And
I
am
sure
*NL*
there
will
not
be
a
happier
man
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
loves
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
rubbish
...
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
smiling
and
looking
into
*NL*
Pierre
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
,
I
know
,
''
Pierre
cried
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
listen
,
''
returned
Prince
Andrew
,
holding
him
by
the
arm
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
know
the
condition
I
am
in
?
I
must
talk
about
it
to
someone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
on
,
go
on
.
I
am
very
glad
,
''
said
Pierre
,
and
his
face
really
*NL*
changed
,
his
brow
became
smooth
,
and
he
listened
gladly
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
Prince
Andrew
seemed
,
and
really
was
,
quite
a
different
,
quite
a
*NL*
new
man
.
Where
was
his
spleen
,
his
contempt
for
life
,
his
*NL*
disillusionment
?
Pierre
was
the
only
person
to
whom
he
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
speak
openly
;
and
to
him
he
told
all
that
was
in
his
soul
.
Now
he
*NL*
boldly
and
lightly
made
plans
for
an
extended
future
,
said
he
could
not
*NL*
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
his
father
's
caprice
,
and
spoke
of
how
he
*NL*
would
either
make
his
father
consent
to
this
marriage
and
love
her
,
or
*NL*
would
do
without
his
consent
;
then
he
marveled
at
the
feeling
that
had
*NL*
mastered
him
as
at
something
strange
,
apart
from
and
independent
of
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
believed
anyone
who
told
me
that
I
was
capable
of
*NL*
such
love
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
It
is
not
at
all
the
same
feeling
that
*NL*
I
knew
in
the
past
.
The
whole
world
is
now
for
me
divided
into
two
*NL*
halves
:
one
half
is
she
,
and
there
all
is
joy
,
hope
,
light
:
the
other
*NL*
half
is
everything
where
she
is
not
,
and
there
is
all
gloom
and
*NL*
darkness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darkness
and
gloom
,
''
reiterated
Pierre
:
``
yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
loving
the
light
,
it
is
not
my
fault
.
And
I
am
very
*NL*
happy
!
You
understand
me
?
I
know
you
are
glad
for
my
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
Pierre
assented
,
looking
at
his
friend
with
a
touched
and
*NL*
sad
expression
in
his
eyes
.
The
brighter
Prince
Andrew
's
lot
appeared
to
*NL*
him
,
the
gloomier
seemed
his
own
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
needed
his
father
's
consent
to
his
marriage
,
and
to
obtain
*NL*
this
he
started
for
the
country
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
received
his
son
's
communication
with
external
composure
,
but
*NL*
inward
wrath
.
He
could
not
comprehend
how
anyone
could
wish
to
alter
his
*NL*
life
or
introduce
anything
new
into
it
,
when
his
own
life
was
already
*NL*
ending
.
``
If
only
they
would
let
me
end
my
days
as
I
want
to
,
''
thought
*NL*
the
old
man
,
``
then
they
might
do
as
they
please
.
''
With
his
son
,
however
,
*NL*
he
employed
the
diplomacy
he
reserved
for
important
occasions
and
,
*NL*
adopting
a
quiet
tone
,
discussed
the
whole
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
the
marriage
was
not
a
brilliant
one
as
regards
*NL*
birth
,
wealth
,
or
rank
.
Secondly
,
Prince
Andrew
was
no
longer
as
young
*NL*
as
he
had
been
and
his
health
was
poor
-LRB-
the
old
man
laid
special
stress
*NL*
on
this
-RRB-
,
while
she
was
very
young
.
Thirdly
,
he
had
a
son
whom
it
would
*NL*
be
a
pity
to
entrust
to
a
chit
of
a
girl
.
``
Fourthly
and
finally
,
''
the
*NL*
father
said
,
looking
ironically
at
his
son
,
``
I
beg
you
to
put
it
off
for
*NL*
a
year
:
go
abroad
,
take
a
cure
,
look
out
as
you
wanted
to
for
a
German
*NL*
tutor
for
Prince
Nicholas
.
Then
if
your
love
or
passion
or
obstinacy
--
as
*NL*
you
please
--
is
still
as
great
,
marry
!
And
that
's
my
last
word
on
it
.
*NL*
Mind
,
the
last
...
''
concluded
the
prince
,
in
a
tone
which
showed
that
*NL*
nothing
would
make
him
alter
his
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
saw
clearly
that
the
old
man
hoped
that
his
feelings
,
or
*NL*
his
fiancee
's
,
would
not
stand
a
year
's
test
,
or
that
he
-LRB-
the
old
prince
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
would
die
before
then
,
and
he
decided
to
conform
to
his
*NL*
father
's
wish
--
to
propose
,
and
postpone
the
wedding
for
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
after
the
last
evening
he
had
spent
with
the
Rostovs
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
returned
to
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
after
her
talk
with
her
mother
Natasha
expected
Bolkonski
all
*NL*
day
,
but
he
did
not
come
.
On
the
second
and
third
day
it
was
the
same
.
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
come
either
and
Natasha
,
not
knowing
that
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
had
gone
to
see
his
father
,
could
not
explain
his
absence
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
passed
in
this
way
.
Natasha
had
no
desire
to
go
out
anywhere
*NL*
and
wandered
from
room
to
room
like
a
shadow
,
idle
and
listless
;
she
*NL*
wept
secretly
at
night
and
did
not
go
to
her
mother
in
the
evenings
.
She
*NL*
blushed
continually
and
was
irritable
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
everybody
*NL*
knew
about
her
disappointment
and
was
laughing
at
her
and
pitying
her
.
*NL*
Strong
as
was
her
inward
grief
,
this
wound
to
her
vanity
intensified
her
*NL*
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
came
to
her
mother
,
tried
to
say
something
,
and
suddenly
began
*NL*
to
cry
.
Her
tears
were
those
of
an
offended
child
who
does
not
know
why
*NL*
it
is
being
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
began
to
soothe
Natasha
,
who
after
first
listening
to
her
*NL*
mother
's
words
,
suddenly
interrupted
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
off
,
Mamma
!
I
do
n't
think
,
and
do
n't
want
to
think
about
it
!
He
*NL*
just
came
and
then
left
off
,
left
off
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
trembled
,
and
she
again
nearly
cried
,
but
recovered
and
went
*NL*
on
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
at
all
want
to
get
married
.
And
I
am
afraid
of
him
;
I
have
*NL*
now
become
quite
calm
,
quite
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
this
conversation
Natasha
put
on
the
old
dress
which
she
*NL*
knew
had
the
peculiar
property
of
conducing
to
cheerfulness
in
the
*NL*
mornings
,
and
that
day
she
returned
to
the
old
way
of
life
which
she
had
*NL*
abandoned
since
the
ball
.
Having
finished
her
morning
tea
she
went
to
*NL*
the
ballroom
,
which
she
particularly
liked
for
its
loud
resonance
,
and
*NL*
began
singing
her
solfeggio
.
When
she
had
finished
her
first
exercise
*NL*
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sang
a
musical
phrase
that
*NL*
particularly
pleased
her
.
She
listened
joyfully
-LRB-
as
though
she
had
not
*NL*
expected
it
-RRB-
to
the
charm
of
the
notes
reverberating
,
filling
the
whole
*NL*
empty
ballroom
,
and
slowly
dying
away
;
and
all
at
once
she
felt
*NL*
cheerful
.
``
What
's
the
good
of
making
so
much
of
it
?
Things
are
nice
as
*NL*
it
is
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
and
she
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
not
stepping
simply
on
the
resounding
parquet
but
treading
with
each
*NL*
step
from
the
heel
to
the
toe
-LRB-
she
had
on
a
new
and
favorite
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
-RRB-
and
listening
to
the
regular
tap
of
the
heel
and
creak
of
the
toe
*NL*
as
gladly
as
she
had
to
the
sounds
of
her
own
voice
.
Passing
a
mirror
*NL*
she
glanced
into
it
.
``
There
,
that
's
me
!
''
the
expression
of
her
face
*NL*
seemed
to
say
as
she
caught
sight
of
herself
.
``
Well
,
and
very
nice
too
!
*NL*
I
need
nobody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
footman
wanted
to
come
in
to
clear
away
something
in
the
room
but
she
*NL*
would
not
let
him
,
and
having
closed
the
door
behind
him
continued
her
*NL*
walk
.
That
morning
she
had
returned
to
her
favorite
mood
--
love
of
,
and
*NL*
delight
in
,
herself
.
``
How
charming
that
Natasha
is
!
''
she
said
again
,
*NL*
speaking
as
some
third
,
collective
,
male
person
.
``
Pretty
,
a
good
voice
,
*NL*
young
,
and
in
nobody
's
way
if
only
they
leave
her
in
peace
.
''
But
however
*NL*
much
they
left
her
in
peace
she
could
not
now
be
at
peace
,
and
*NL*
immediately
felt
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
the
porch
door
opened
,
and
someone
asked
,
``
At
home
?
''
and
*NL*
then
footsteps
were
heard
.
Natasha
was
looking
at
the
mirror
,
but
did
*NL*
not
see
herself
.
She
listened
to
the
sounds
in
the
hall
.
When
she
saw
*NL*
herself
,
her
face
was
pale
.
It
was
he
.
She
knew
this
for
certain
,
though
*NL*
she
hardly
heard
his
voice
through
the
closed
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pale
and
agitated
,
Natasha
ran
into
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
Bolkonski
has
come
!
''
she
said
.
``
Mamma
,
it
is
awful
,
it
is
*NL*
unbearable
!
I
do
n't
want
...
to
be
tormented
?
What
am
I
to
do
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
countess
could
answer
,
Prince
Andrew
entered
the
room
with
an
*NL*
agitated
and
serious
face
.
As
soon
as
he
saw
Natasha
his
face
*NL*
brightened
.
He
kissed
the
countess
'
hand
and
Natasha
's
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
beside
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
long
since
we
had
the
pleasure
...
''
began
the
countess
,
but
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
interrupted
her
by
answering
her
intended
question
,
obviously
in
*NL*
haste
to
say
what
he
had
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
been
to
see
you
all
this
time
because
I
have
been
at
my
*NL*
father
's
.
I
had
to
talk
over
a
very
important
matter
with
him
.
I
only
*NL*
got
back
last
night
,
''
he
said
glancing
at
Natasha
;
``
I
want
to
have
a
*NL*
talk
with
you
,
Countess
,
''
he
added
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
lowered
her
eyes
,
sighing
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
disposal
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
knew
that
she
ought
to
go
away
,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
:
*NL*
something
gripped
her
throat
,
and
regardless
of
manners
she
stared
*NL*
straight
at
Prince
Andrew
with
wide-open
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
?
This
instant
!
...
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
glanced
at
her
,
and
that
glance
convinced
her
that
she
was
not
*NL*
mistaken
.
Yes
,
at
once
,
that
very
instant
,
her
fate
would
be
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Natasha
!
I
will
call
you
,
''
said
the
countess
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
glanced
with
frightened
imploring
eyes
at
Prince
Andrew
and
at
*NL*
her
mother
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
,
Countess
,
to
ask
for
your
daughter
's
hand
,
''
said
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
'
face
flushed
hotly
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
offer
...
''
she
began
at
last
sedately
.
He
remained
silent
,
looking
*NL*
into
her
eyes
.
``
Your
offer
...
''
-LRB-
she
grew
confused
-RRB-
``
is
agreeable
to
us
,
*NL*
and
I
accept
your
offer
.
I
am
glad
.
And
my
husband
...
I
hope
...
but
it
*NL*
will
depend
on
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
speak
to
her
when
I
have
your
consent
...
Do
you
give
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
countess
.
She
held
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
with
a
*NL*
mixed
feeling
of
estrangement
and
tenderness
pressed
her
lips
to
his
*NL*
forehead
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
her
hand
.
She
wished
to
love
him
as
a
*NL*
son
,
but
felt
that
to
her
he
was
a
stranger
and
a
terrifying
man
.
``
I
am
*NL*
sure
my
husband
will
consent
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
but
your
father
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
to
whom
I
have
told
my
plans
,
has
made
it
an
express
*NL*
condition
of
his
consent
that
the
wedding
is
not
to
take
place
for
a
*NL*
year
.
And
I
wished
to
tell
you
of
that
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
that
Natasha
is
still
young
,
but
--
so
long
as
that
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unavoidable
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
send
her
to
you
,
''
said
the
countess
,
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
''
she
repeated
while
seeking
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
said
that
Natasha
was
in
her
bedroom
.
Natasha
was
sitting
on
the
*NL*
bed
,
pale
and
dry
eyed
,
and
was
gazing
at
the
icons
and
whispering
*NL*
something
as
she
rapidly
crossed
herself
.
Seeing
her
mother
she
jumped
*NL*
up
and
flew
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mamma
?
...
Well
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
to
him
.
He
is
asking
for
your
hand
,
''
said
the
countess
,
coldly
*NL*
it
seemed
to
Natasha
.
``
Go
...
go
,
''
said
the
mother
,
sadly
and
*NL*
reproachfully
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
as
her
daughter
ran
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
never
remembered
how
she
entered
the
drawing
room
.
When
she
came
*NL*
in
and
saw
him
she
paused
.
``
Is
it
possible
that
this
stranger
has
now
*NL*
become
everything
to
me
?
''
she
asked
herself
,
and
immediately
answered
,
*NL*
``
Yes
,
everything
!
He
alone
is
now
dearer
to
me
than
everything
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
Prince
Andrew
came
up
to
her
with
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
moment
I
saw
you
.
May
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
the
serious
impassioned
expression
of
*NL*
her
face
.
Her
face
said
:
``
Why
ask
?
Why
doubt
what
you
can
not
but
know
?
*NL*
Why
speak
,
when
words
can
not
express
what
one
feels
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
near
to
him
and
stopped
.
He
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
Natasha
murmured
as
if
in
vexation
.
Then
she
sighed
loudly
*NL*
and
,
catching
her
breath
more
and
more
quickly
,
began
to
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
so
happy
!
''
she
replied
,
smiled
through
her
tears
,
bent
over
*NL*
closer
to
him
,
paused
for
an
instant
as
if
asking
herself
whether
she
*NL*
might
,
and
then
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
held
her
hands
,
looked
into
her
eyes
,
and
did
not
find
in
*NL*
his
heart
his
former
love
for
her
.
Something
in
him
had
suddenly
*NL*
changed
;
there
was
no
longer
the
former
poetic
and
mystic
charm
of
*NL*
desire
,
but
there
was
pity
for
her
feminine
and
childish
weakness
,
fear
*NL*
at
her
devotion
and
trustfulness
,
and
an
oppressive
yet
joyful
sense
of
*NL*
the
duty
that
now
bound
him
to
her
forever
.
The
present
feeling
,
though
*NL*
not
so
bright
and
poetic
as
the
former
,
was
stronger
and
more
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
mother
tell
you
that
it
can
not
be
for
a
year
?
''
asked
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
still
looking
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
I
--
the
`
chit
of
a
girl
,
'
as
everybody
called
me
,
''
*NL*
thought
Natasha
--
``
is
it
possible
that
I
am
now
to
be
the
wife
and
the
*NL*
equal
of
this
strange
,
dear
,
clever
man
whom
even
my
father
looks
up
to
?
*NL*
Can
it
be
true
?
Can
it
be
true
that
there
can
be
no
more
playing
with
*NL*
life
,
that
now
I
am
grown
up
,
that
on
me
now
lies
a
responsibility
for
*NL*
my
every
word
and
deed
?
Yes
,
but
what
did
he
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
,
but
she
had
not
understood
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
!
''
he
said
.
``
But
you
are
so
young
,
and
I
have
already
been
*NL*
through
so
much
in
life
.
I
am
afraid
for
you
,
you
do
not
yet
know
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
listened
with
concentrated
attention
,
trying
but
failing
to
take
*NL*
in
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hard
as
this
year
which
delays
my
happiness
will
be
,
''
continued
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
``
it
will
give
you
time
to
be
sure
of
yourself
.
I
ask
you
to
make
*NL*
me
happy
in
a
year
,
but
you
are
free
:
our
engagement
shall
remain
a
*NL*
secret
,
and
should
you
find
that
you
do
not
love
me
,
or
should
you
come
*NL*
to
love
...
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
an
unnatural
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
that
?
''
Natasha
interrupted
him
.
``
You
know
that
from
the
*NL*
very
day
you
first
came
to
Otradnoe
I
have
loved
you
,
''
she
cried
,
quite
*NL*
convinced
that
she
spoke
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
year
you
will
learn
to
know
yourself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
whole
year
!
''
Natasha
repeated
suddenly
,
only
now
realizing
that
the
*NL*
marriage
was
to
be
postponed
for
a
year
.
``
But
why
a
year
?
Why
a
*NL*
year
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
began
to
explain
to
her
the
reasons
for
this
delay
.
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ca
n't
it
be
helped
?
''
she
asked
.
Prince
Andrew
did
not
reply
,
but
*NL*
his
face
expressed
the
impossibility
of
altering
that
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
awful
!
Oh
,
it
's
awful
!
awful
!
''
Natasha
suddenly
cried
,
and
again
*NL*
burst
into
sobs
.
``
I
shall
die
,
waiting
a
year
:
it
's
impossible
,
it
's
*NL*
awful
!
''
She
looked
into
her
lover
's
face
and
saw
in
it
a
look
of
*NL*
commiseration
and
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
I
'll
do
anything
!
''
she
said
,
suddenly
checking
her
tears
.
``
I
am
*NL*
so
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
and
mother
came
into
the
room
and
gave
the
betrothed
couple
*NL*
their
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
Prince
Andrew
began
to
frequent
the
Rostovs
'
as
Natasha
's
*NL*
affianced
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
No
betrothal
ceremony
took
place
and
Natasha
's
engagement
to
Bolkonski
*NL*
was
not
announced
;
Prince
Andrew
insisted
on
that
.
He
said
that
as
he
*NL*
was
responsible
for
the
delay
he
ought
to
bear
the
whole
burden
of
it
;
*NL*
that
he
had
given
his
word
and
bound
himself
forever
,
but
that
he
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
bind
Natasha
and
gave
her
perfect
freedom
.
If
after
six
*NL*
months
she
felt
that
she
did
not
love
him
she
would
have
full
right
to
*NL*
reject
him
.
Naturally
neither
Natasha
nor
her
parents
wished
to
hear
of
*NL*
this
,
but
Prince
Andrew
was
firm
.
He
came
every
day
to
the
Rostovs
'
,
but
*NL*
did
not
behave
to
Natasha
as
an
affianced
lover
:
he
did
not
use
the
*NL*
familiar
thou
,
but
said
you
to
her
,
and
kissed
only
her
hand
.
After
*NL*
their
engagement
,
quite
different
,
intimate
,
and
natural
relations
*NL*
sprang
up
between
them
.
It
was
as
if
they
had
not
known
each
other
till
*NL*
now
.
Both
liked
to
recall
how
they
had
regarded
each
other
when
as
yet
*NL*
they
were
nothing
to
one
another
;
they
felt
themselves
now
quite
*NL*
different
beings
:
then
they
were
artificial
,
now
natural
and
sincere
.
At
*NL*
first
the
family
felt
some
constraint
in
intercourse
with
Prince
Andrew
;
*NL*
he
seemed
a
man
from
another
world
,
and
for
a
long
time
Natasha
trained
*NL*
the
family
to
get
used
to
him
,
proudly
assuring
them
all
that
he
only
*NL*
appeared
to
be
different
,
but
was
really
just
like
all
of
them
,
and
that
*NL*
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
and
no
one
else
ought
to
be
.
After
a
few
days
*NL*
they
grew
accustomed
to
him
,
and
without
restraint
in
his
presence
*NL*
pursued
their
usual
way
of
life
,
in
which
he
took
his
part
.
He
could
*NL*
talk
about
rural
economy
with
the
count
,
fashions
with
the
countess
and
*NL*
Natasha
,
and
about
albums
and
fancywork
with
Sonya
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
household
both
among
themselves
and
in
his
presence
expressed
their
*NL*
wonder
at
how
it
had
all
happened
,
and
at
the
evident
omens
there
had
*NL*
been
of
it
:
Prince
Andrew
's
coming
to
Otradnoe
and
their
coming
to
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
the
likeness
between
Natasha
and
Prince
Andrew
which
her
*NL*
nurse
had
noticed
on
his
first
visit
,
and
Andrew
's
encounter
with
*NL*
Nicholas
in
1805
,
and
many
other
incidents
betokening
that
it
had
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
house
that
poetic
dullness
and
quiet
reigned
which
always
*NL*
accompanies
the
presence
of
a
betrothed
couple
.
Often
when
all
sitting
*NL*
together
everyone
kept
silent
.
Sometimes
the
others
would
get
up
and
go
*NL*
away
and
the
couple
,
left
alone
,
still
remained
silent
.
They
rarely
*NL*
spoke
of
their
future
life
.
Prince
Andrew
was
afraid
and
ashamed
to
*NL*
speak
of
it
.
Natasha
shared
this
as
she
did
all
his
feelings
,
which
she
*NL*
constantly
divined
.
Once
she
began
questioning
him
about
his
son
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
blushed
,
as
he
often
did
now
--
Natasha
particularly
liked
it
in
*NL*
him
--
and
said
that
his
son
would
not
live
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Natasha
in
a
frightened
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
take
him
away
from
his
grandfather
,
and
besides
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
should
have
loved
him
!
''
said
Natasha
,
immediately
guessing
his
*NL*
thought
;
``
but
I
know
you
wish
to
avoid
any
pretext
for
finding
fault
*NL*
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
the
old
count
would
come
up
,
kiss
Prince
Andrew
,
and
ask
his
*NL*
advice
about
Petya
's
education
or
Nicholas
'
service
.
The
old
countess
*NL*
sighed
as
she
looked
at
them
;
Sonya
was
always
getting
frightened
lest
*NL*
she
should
be
in
the
way
and
tried
to
find
excuses
for
leaving
them
*NL*
alone
,
even
when
they
did
not
wish
it
.
When
Prince
Andrew
spoke
-LRB-
he
*NL*
could
tell
a
story
very
well
-RRB-
,
Natasha
listened
to
him
with
pride
;
when
*NL*
she
spoke
she
noticed
with
fear
and
joy
that
he
gazed
attentively
and
*NL*
scrutinizingly
at
her
.
She
asked
herself
in
perplexity
:
``
What
does
he
*NL*
look
for
in
me
?
He
is
trying
to
discover
something
by
looking
at
me
!
*NL*
What
if
what
he
seeks
in
me
is
not
there
?
''
Sometimes
she
fell
into
one
*NL*
of
the
mad
,
merry
moods
characteristic
of
her
,
and
then
she
particularly
*NL*
loved
to
hear
and
see
how
Prince
Andrew
laughed
.
He
seldom
laughed
,
but
*NL*
when
he
did
he
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
his
laughter
,
and
after
*NL*
such
a
laugh
she
always
felt
nearer
to
him
.
Natasha
would
have
been
*NL*
completely
happy
if
the
thought
of
the
separation
awaiting
her
and
*NL*
drawing
near
had
not
terrified
her
,
just
as
the
mere
thought
of
it
made
*NL*
him
turn
pale
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
Petersburg
Prince
Andrew
brought
with
*NL*
him
Pierre
,
who
had
not
been
to
the
Rostovs
'
once
since
the
ball
.
Pierre
*NL*
seemed
disconcerted
and
embarrassed
.
He
was
talking
to
the
countess
,
and
*NL*
Natasha
sat
down
beside
a
little
chess
table
with
Sonya
,
thereby
*NL*
inviting
Prince
Andrew
to
come
too
.
He
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
known
Bezukhov
a
long
time
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Do
you
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
a
dear
,
but
very
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
usual
when
speaking
of
Pierre
,
she
began
to
tell
anecdotes
of
his
*NL*
absent-mindedness
,
some
of
which
had
even
been
invented
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
I
have
entrusted
him
with
our
secret
?
I
have
known
him
from
*NL*
childhood
.
He
has
a
heart
of
gold
.
I
beg
you
,
Natalie
,
''
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
said
with
sudden
seriousness
--
``
I
am
going
away
and
heaven
knows
what
may
*NL*
happen
.
You
may
cease
to
...
all
right
,
I
know
I
am
not
to
say
that
.
Only
*NL*
this
,
then
:
whatever
may
happen
to
you
when
I
am
not
here
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
trouble
may
come
,
''
Prince
Andrew
continued
,
``
I
beg
you
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Sophie
,
whatever
may
happen
,
to
turn
to
him
alone
for
*NL*
advice
and
help
!
He
is
a
most
absent-minded
and
absurd
fellow
,
but
he
*NL*
has
a
heart
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
her
father
,
nor
her
mother
,
nor
Sonya
,
nor
Prince
Andrew
himself
*NL*
could
have
foreseen
how
the
separation
from
her
lover
would
act
on
*NL*
Natasha
.
Flushed
and
agitated
she
went
about
the
house
all
that
day
,
*NL*
dry-eyed
,
occupied
with
most
trivial
matters
as
if
not
understanding
*NL*
what
awaited
her
.
She
did
not
even
cry
when
,
on
taking
leave
,
he
kissed
*NL*
her
hand
for
the
last
time
.
``
Do
n't
go
!
''
she
said
in
a
tone
that
made
him
*NL*
wonder
whether
he
really
ought
not
to
stay
and
which
he
remembered
long
*NL*
afterwards
.
Nor
did
she
cry
when
he
was
gone
;
but
for
several
days
she
*NL*
sat
in
her
room
dry-eyed
,
taking
no
interest
in
anything
and
only
saying
*NL*
now
and
then
,
``
Oh
,
why
did
he
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
fortnight
after
his
departure
,
to
the
surprise
of
those
around
*NL*
her
,
she
recovered
from
her
mental
sickness
just
as
suddenly
and
became
*NL*
her
old
self
again
,
but
with
a
change
in
her
moral
physiognomy
,
as
a
*NL*
child
gets
up
after
a
long
illness
with
a
changed
expression
of
face
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
year
after
his
son
's
departure
,
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
's
*NL*
health
and
temper
became
much
worse
.
He
grew
still
more
irritable
,
and
*NL*
it
was
Princess
Mary
who
generally
bore
the
brunt
of
his
frequent
fits
*NL*
of
unprovoked
anger
.
He
seemed
carefully
to
seek
out
her
tender
spots
so
*NL*
as
to
torture
her
mentally
as
harshly
as
possible
.
Princess
Mary
had
two
*NL*
passions
and
consequently
two
joys
--
her
nephew
,
little
Nicholas
,
and
*NL*
religion
--
and
these
were
the
favorite
subjects
of
the
prince
's
attacks
*NL*
and
ridicule
.
Whatever
was
spoken
of
he
would
bring
round
to
the
*NL*
superstitiousness
of
old
maids
,
or
the
petting
and
spoiling
of
children
.
*NL*
``
You
want
to
make
him
''
--
little
Nicholas
--
``
into
an
old
maid
like
*NL*
yourself
!
A
pity
!
Prince
Andrew
wants
a
son
and
not
an
old
maid
,
''
he
*NL*
would
say
.
Or
,
turning
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
he
would
ask
her
in
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
presence
how
she
liked
our
village
priests
and
icons
and
*NL*
would
joke
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continually
hurt
Princess
Mary
's
feelings
and
tormented
her
,
but
it
*NL*
cost
her
no
effort
to
forgive
him
.
Could
he
be
to
blame
toward
her
,
or
*NL*
could
her
father
,
whom
she
knew
loved
her
in
spite
of
it
all
,
be
unjust
?
*NL*
And
what
is
justice
?
The
princess
never
thought
of
that
proud
word
*NL*
``
justice
.
''
All
the
complex
laws
of
man
centered
for
her
in
one
clear
and
*NL*
simple
law
--
the
law
of
love
and
self-sacrifice
taught
us
by
Him
who
*NL*
lovingly
suffered
for
mankind
though
He
Himself
was
God
.
What
had
she
to
*NL*
do
with
the
justice
or
injustice
of
other
people
?
She
had
to
endure
and
*NL*
love
,
and
that
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
winter
Prince
Andrew
had
come
to
Bald
Hills
and
had
been
gay
,
*NL*
gentle
,
and
more
affectionate
than
Princess
Mary
had
known
him
for
a
*NL*
long
time
past
.
She
felt
that
something
had
happened
to
him
,
but
he
said
*NL*
nothing
to
her
about
his
love
.
Before
he
left
he
had
a
long
talk
with
*NL*
his
father
about
something
,
and
Princess
Mary
noticed
that
before
his
*NL*
departure
they
were
dissatisfied
with
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Prince
Andrew
had
gone
,
Princess
Mary
wrote
to
her
friend
*NL*
Julie
Karagina
in
Petersburg
,
whom
she
had
dreamed
-LRB-
as
all
girls
dream
-RRB-
*NL*
of
marrying
to
her
brother
,
and
who
was
at
that
time
in
mourning
for
her
*NL*
own
brother
,
killed
in
Turkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sorrow
,
it
seems
,
is
our
common
lot
,
my
dear
,
tender
friend
Julie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
loss
is
so
terrible
that
I
can
only
explain
it
to
myself
as
a
*NL*
special
providence
of
God
who
,
loving
you
,
wishes
to
try
you
and
your
*NL*
excellent
mother
.
Oh
,
my
friend
!
Religion
,
and
religion
alone
,
can
--
I
*NL*
will
not
say
comfort
us
--
but
save
us
from
despair
.
Religion
alone
can
*NL*
explain
to
us
what
without
its
help
man
can
not
comprehend
:
why
,
for
what
*NL*
cause
,
kind
and
noble
beings
able
to
find
happiness
in
life
--
not
merely
*NL*
harming
no
one
but
necessary
to
the
happiness
of
others
--
are
called
away
*NL*
to
God
,
while
cruel
,
useless
,
harmful
persons
,
or
such
as
are
a
burden
*NL*
to
themselves
and
to
others
,
are
left
living
.
The
first
death
I
saw
,
and
*NL*
one
I
shall
never
forget
--
that
of
my
dear
sister-in-law
--
left
that
*NL*
impression
on
me
.
Just
as
you
ask
destiny
why
your
splendid
brother
had
*NL*
to
die
,
so
I
asked
why
that
angel
Lise
,
who
not
only
never
wronged
*NL*
anyone
,
but
in
whose
soul
there
were
never
any
unkind
thoughts
,
had
to
*NL*
die
.
And
what
do
you
think
,
dear
friend
?
Five
years
have
passed
since
*NL*
then
,
and
already
I
,
with
my
petty
understanding
,
begin
to
see
clearly
*NL*
why
she
had
to
die
,
and
in
what
way
that
death
was
but
an
expression
of
*NL*
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
Creator
,
whose
every
action
,
though
*NL*
generally
incomprehensible
to
us
,
is
but
a
manifestation
of
His
infinite
*NL*
love
for
His
creatures
.
Perhaps
,
I
often
think
,
she
was
too
angelically
*NL*
innocent
to
have
the
strength
to
perform
all
a
mother
's
duties
.
As
a
*NL*
young
wife
she
was
irreproachable
;
perhaps
she
could
not
have
been
so
as
*NL*
a
mother
.
As
it
is
,
not
only
has
she
left
us
,
and
particularly
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
with
the
purest
regrets
and
memories
,
but
probably
she
will
*NL*
there
receive
a
place
I
dare
not
hope
for
myself
.
But
not
to
speak
of
*NL*
her
alone
,
that
early
and
terrible
death
has
had
the
most
beneficent
*NL*
influence
on
me
and
on
my
brother
in
spite
of
all
our
grief
.
Then
,
at
*NL*
the
moment
of
our
loss
,
these
thoughts
could
not
occur
to
me
;
I
should
*NL*
then
have
dismissed
them
with
horror
,
but
now
they
are
very
clear
and
*NL*
certain
.
I
write
all
this
to
you
,
dear
friend
,
only
to
convince
you
of
*NL*
the
Gospel
truth
which
has
become
for
me
a
principle
of
life
:
not
a
*NL*
single
hair
of
our
heads
will
fall
without
His
will
.
And
His
will
is
*NL*
governed
only
by
infinite
love
for
us
,
and
so
whatever
befalls
us
is
for
*NL*
our
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
ask
whether
we
shall
spend
next
winter
in
Moscow
.
In
spite
of
my
*NL*
wish
to
see
you
,
I
do
not
think
so
and
do
not
want
to
do
so
.
You
will
be
*NL*
surprised
to
hear
that
the
reason
for
this
is
Buonaparte
!
The
case
is
*NL*
this
:
my
father
's
health
is
growing
noticeably
worse
,
he
can
not
stand
*NL*
any
contradiction
and
is
becoming
irritable
.
This
irritability
is
,
as
*NL*
you
know
,
chiefly
directed
to
political
questions
.
He
can
not
endure
the
*NL*
notion
that
Buonaparte
is
negotiating
on
equal
terms
with
all
the
*NL*
sovereigns
of
Europe
and
particularly
with
our
own
,
the
grandson
of
the
*NL*
Great
Catherine
!
As
you
know
,
I
am
quite
indifferent
to
politics
,
but
*NL*
from
my
father
's
remarks
and
his
talks
with
Michael
Ivanovich
I
know
all
*NL*
that
goes
on
in
the
world
and
especially
about
the
honors
conferred
on
*NL*
Buonaparte
,
who
only
at
Bald
Hills
in
the
whole
world
,
it
seems
,
is
not
*NL*
accepted
as
a
great
man
,
still
less
as
Emperor
of
France
.
And
my
father
*NL*
can
not
stand
this
.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
is
chiefly
because
of
his
*NL*
political
views
that
my
father
is
reluctant
to
speak
of
going
to
Moscow
;
*NL*
for
he
foresees
the
encounters
that
would
result
from
his
way
of
*NL*
expressing
his
views
regardless
of
anybody
.
All
the
benefit
he
might
*NL*
derive
from
a
course
of
treatment
he
would
lose
as
a
result
of
the
*NL*
disputes
about
Buonaparte
which
would
be
inevitable
.
In
any
case
it
will
*NL*
be
decided
very
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
family
life
goes
on
in
the
old
way
except
for
my
brother
Andrew
's
*NL*
absence
.
He
,
as
I
wrote
you
before
,
has
changed
very
much
of
late
.
After
*NL*
his
sorrow
he
only
this
year
quite
recovered
his
spirits
.
He
has
again
*NL*
become
as
I
used
to
know
him
when
a
child
:
kind
,
affectionate
,
with
that
*NL*
heart
of
gold
to
which
I
know
no
equal
.
He
has
realized
,
it
seems
to
me
,
*NL*
that
life
is
not
over
for
him
.
But
together
with
this
mental
change
he
*NL*
has
grown
physically
much
weaker
.
He
has
become
thinner
and
more
*NL*
nervous
.
I
am
anxious
about
him
and
glad
he
is
taking
this
trip
abroad
*NL*
which
the
doctors
recommended
long
ago
.
I
hope
it
will
cure
him
.
You
*NL*
write
that
in
Petersburg
he
is
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
most
active
,
*NL*
cultivated
,
and
capable
of
the
young
men
.
Forgive
my
vanity
as
a
*NL*
relation
,
but
I
never
doubted
it
.
The
good
he
has
done
to
everybody
*NL*
here
,
from
his
peasants
up
to
the
gentry
,
is
incalculable
.
On
his
*NL*
arrival
in
Petersburg
he
received
only
his
due
.
I
always
wonder
at
the
*NL*
way
rumors
fly
from
Petersburg
to
Moscow
,
especially
such
false
ones
as
*NL*
that
you
write
about
--
I
mean
the
report
of
my
brother
's
betrothal
to
the
*NL*
little
Rostova
.
I
do
not
think
my
brother
will
ever
marry
again
,
and
*NL*
certainly
not
her
;
and
this
is
why
:
first
,
I
know
that
though
he
rarely
*NL*
speaks
about
the
wife
he
has
lost
,
the
grief
of
that
loss
has
gone
too
*NL*
deep
in
his
heart
for
him
ever
to
decide
to
give
her
a
successor
and
our
*NL*
little
angel
a
stepmother
.
Secondly
because
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
that
girl
*NL*
is
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
could
please
Prince
Andrew
.
I
do
not
think
*NL*
he
would
choose
her
for
a
wife
,
and
frankly
I
do
not
wish
it
.
But
I
am
*NL*
running
on
too
long
and
am
at
the
end
of
my
second
sheet
.
Good-bye
,
my
*NL*
dear
friend
.
May
God
keep
you
in
His
holy
and
mighty
care
.
My
dear
*NL*
friend
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
sends
you
kisses
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
summer
Princess
Mary
received
an
unexpected
letter
*NL*
from
Prince
Andrew
in
Switzerland
in
which
he
gave
her
strange
and
*NL*
surprising
news
.
He
informed
her
of
his
engagement
to
Natasha
Rostova
.
*NL*
The
whole
letter
breathed
loving
rapture
for
his
betrothed
and
tender
*NL*
and
confiding
affection
for
his
sister
.
He
wrote
that
he
had
never
loved
*NL*
as
he
did
now
and
that
only
now
did
he
understand
and
know
what
life
*NL*
was
.
He
asked
his
sister
to
forgive
him
for
not
having
told
her
of
his
*NL*
resolve
when
he
had
last
visited
Bald
Hills
,
though
he
had
spoken
of
it
*NL*
to
his
father
.
He
had
not
done
so
for
fear
Princess
Mary
should
ask
her
*NL*
father
to
give
his
consent
,
irritating
him
and
having
to
bear
the
brunt
*NL*
of
his
displeasure
without
attaining
her
object
.
``
Besides
,
''
he
wrote
,
*NL*
``
the
matter
was
not
then
so
definitely
settled
as
it
is
now
.
My
father
*NL*
then
insisted
on
a
delay
of
a
year
and
now
already
six
months
,
half
of
*NL*
that
period
,
have
passed
,
and
my
resolution
is
firmer
than
ever
.
If
the
*NL*
doctors
did
not
keep
me
here
at
the
spas
I
should
be
back
in
Russia
,
but
*NL*
as
it
is
I
have
to
postpone
my
return
for
three
months
.
You
know
me
and
*NL*
my
relations
with
Father
.
I
want
nothing
from
him
.
I
have
been
and
*NL*
always
shall
be
independent
;
but
to
go
against
his
will
and
arouse
his
*NL*
anger
,
now
that
he
may
perhaps
remain
with
us
such
a
short
time
,
would
*NL*
destroy
half
my
happiness
.
I
am
now
writing
to
him
about
the
same
*NL*
question
,
and
beg
you
to
choose
a
good
moment
to
hand
him
the
letter
and
*NL*
to
let
me
know
how
he
looks
at
the
whole
matter
and
whether
there
is
*NL*
hope
that
he
may
consent
to
reduce
the
term
by
four
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
long
hesitations
,
doubts
,
and
prayers
,
Princess
Mary
gave
the
*NL*
letter
to
her
father
.
The
next
day
the
old
prince
said
to
her
quietly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
and
tell
your
brother
to
wait
till
I
am
dead
...
It
wo
n't
be
*NL*
long
--
I
shall
soon
set
him
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
was
about
to
reply
,
but
her
father
would
not
let
her
speak
*NL*
and
,
raising
his
voice
more
and
more
,
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
marry
,
my
boy
!
...
A
good
family
!
...
Clever
people
,
eh
?
Rich
,
eh
?
*NL*
Yes
,
a
nice
stepmother
little
Nicholas
will
have
!
Write
and
tell
him
*NL*
that
he
may
marry
tomorrow
if
he
likes
.
She
will
be
little
Nicholas
'
*NL*
stepmother
and
I
'll
marry
Bourienne
!
...
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
He
must
n't
be
*NL*
without
a
stepmother
either
!
Only
one
thing
,
no
more
women
are
wanted
in
*NL*
my
house
--
let
him
marry
and
live
by
himself
.
Perhaps
you
will
go
and
*NL*
live
with
him
too
?
''
he
added
,
turning
to
Princess
Mary
.
``
Go
in
heaven
's
*NL*
name
!
Go
out
into
the
frost
...
the
frost
...
the
frost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
outburst
the
prince
did
not
speak
any
more
about
the
matter
.
*NL*
But
repressed
vexation
at
his
son
's
poor-spirited
behavior
found
*NL*
expression
in
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
.
To
his
former
pretexts
for
*NL*
irony
a
fresh
one
was
now
added
--
allusions
to
stepmothers
and
*NL*
amiabilities
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
I
marry
her
?
''
he
asked
his
daughter
.
``
She
'll
make
a
*NL*
splendid
princess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
latterly
,
to
her
surprise
and
bewilderment
,
Princess
Mary
noticed
*NL*
that
her
father
was
really
associating
more
and
more
with
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
.
She
wrote
to
Prince
Andrew
about
the
reception
of
his
*NL*
letter
,
but
comforted
him
with
hopes
of
reconciling
their
father
to
the
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Nicholas
and
his
education
,
her
brother
Andrew
,
and
religion
were
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
joys
and
consolations
;
but
besides
that
,
since
everyone
*NL*
must
have
personal
hopes
,
Princess
Mary
in
the
profoundest
depths
of
her
*NL*
heart
had
a
hidden
dream
and
hope
that
supplied
the
chief
consolation
of
*NL*
her
life
.
This
comforting
dream
and
hope
were
given
her
by
God
's
folk
--
*NL*
the
half-witted
and
other
pilgrims
who
visited
her
without
the
prince
's
*NL*
knowledge
.
The
longer
she
lived
,
the
more
experience
and
observation
she
*NL*
had
of
life
,
the
greater
was
her
wonder
at
the
short-sightedness
of
men
*NL*
who
seek
enjoyment
and
happiness
here
on
earth
:
toiling
,
suffering
,
*NL*
struggling
,
and
harming
one
another
,
to
obtain
that
impossible
,
*NL*
visionary
,
sinful
happiness
.
Prince
Andrew
had
loved
his
wife
,
she
died
,
*NL*
but
that
was
not
enough
:
he
wanted
to
bind
his
happiness
to
another
*NL*
woman
.
Her
father
objected
to
this
because
he
wanted
a
more
*NL*
distinguished
and
wealthier
match
for
Andrew
.
And
they
all
struggled
and
*NL*
suffered
and
tormented
one
another
and
injured
their
souls
,
their
*NL*
eternal
souls
,
for
the
attainment
of
benefits
which
endure
but
for
an
*NL*
instant
.
Not
only
do
we
know
this
ourselves
,
but
Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
*NL*
came
down
to
earth
and
told
us
that
this
life
is
but
for
a
moment
and
is
*NL*
a
probation
;
yet
we
cling
to
it
and
think
to
find
happiness
in
it
.
``
How
*NL*
is
it
that
no
one
realizes
this
?
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
``
No
one
except
*NL*
these
despised
God
's
folk
who
,
wallet
on
back
,
come
to
me
by
the
back
*NL*
door
,
afraid
of
being
seen
by
the
prince
,
not
for
fear
of
ill-usage
by
*NL*
him
but
for
fear
of
causing
him
to
sin
.
To
leave
family
,
home
,
and
all
*NL*
the
cares
of
worldly
welfare
,
in
order
without
clinging
to
anything
to
*NL*
wander
in
hempen
rags
from
place
to
place
under
an
assumed
name
,
doing
*NL*
no
one
any
harm
but
praying
for
all
--
for
those
who
drive
one
away
as
*NL*
well
as
for
those
who
protect
one
:
higher
than
that
life
and
truth
there
*NL*
is
no
life
or
truth
!

There
was
one
pilgrim
,
a
quiet
pockmarked
little
woman
of
fifty
called
*NL*
Theodosia
,
who
for
over
thirty
years
had
gone
about
barefoot
and
worn
*NL*
heavy
chains
.
Princess
Mary
was
particularly
fond
of
her
.
Once
,
when
in
*NL*
a
room
with
a
lamp
dimly
lit
before
the
icon
Theodosia
was
talking
of
*NL*
her
life
,
the
thought
that
Theodosia
alone
had
found
the
true
path
of
*NL*
life
suddenly
came
to
Princess
Mary
with
such
force
that
she
resolved
to
*NL*
become
a
pilgrim
herself
.
When
Theodosia
had
gone
to
sleep
Princess
Mary
*NL*
thought
about
this
for
a
long
time
,
and
at
last
made
up
her
mind
that
,
*NL*
strange
as
it
might
seem
,
she
must
go
on
a
pilgrimage
.
She
disclosed
*NL*
this
thought
to
no
one
but
to
her
confessor
,
Father
Akinfi
,
the
monk
,
*NL*
and
he
approved
of
her
intention
.
Under
guise
of
a
present
for
the
*NL*
pilgrims
,
Princess
Mary
prepared
a
pilgrim
's
complete
costume
for
*NL*
herself
:
a
coarse
smock
,
bast
shoes
,
a
rough
coat
,
and
a
black
kerchief
.
*NL*
Often
,
approaching
the
chest
of
drawers
containing
this
secret
treasure
,
*NL*
Princess
Mary
paused
,
uncertain
whether
the
time
had
not
already
come
to
*NL*
put
her
project
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
listening
to
the
pilgrims
'
tales
,
she
was
so
stimulated
by
their
*NL*
simple
speech
,
mechanical
to
them
but
to
her
so
full
of
deep
meaning
,
*NL*
that
several
times
she
was
on
the
point
of
abandoning
everything
and
*NL*
running
away
from
home
.
In
imagination
she
already
pictured
herself
by
*NL*
Theodosia
's
side
,
dressed
in
coarse
rags
,
walking
with
a
staff
,
a
wallet
*NL*
on
her
back
,
along
the
dusty
road
,
directing
her
wanderings
from
one
*NL*
saint
's
shrine
to
another
,
free
from
envy
,
earthly
love
,
or
desire
,
and
*NL*
reaching
at
last
the
place
where
there
is
no
more
sorrow
or
sighing
,
but
*NL*
eternal
joy
and
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
to
a
place
and
pray
there
,
and
before
having
time
to
get
*NL*
used
to
it
or
getting
to
love
it
,
I
shall
go
farther
.
I
will
go
on
till
*NL*
my
legs
fail
,
and
I
'll
lie
down
and
die
somewhere
,
and
shall
at
last
*NL*
reach
that
eternal
,
quiet
haven
,
where
there
is
neither
sorrow
nor
*NL*
sighing
...
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
afterwards
,
when
she
saw
her
father
and
especially
little
Koko
*NL*
-LRB-
Nicholas
-RRB-
,
her
resolve
weakened
.
She
wept
quietly
,
and
felt
that
she
*NL*
was
a
sinner
who
loved
her
father
and
little
nephew
more
than
God
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bible
legend
tells
us
that
the
absence
of
labor
--
idleness
--
was
a
*NL*
condition
of
the
first
man
's
blessedness
before
the
Fall
.
Fallen
man
has
*NL*
retained
a
love
of
idleness
,
but
the
curse
weighs
on
the
race
not
only
*NL*
because
we
have
to
seek
our
bread
in
the
sweat
of
our
brows
,
but
because
*NL*
our
moral
nature
is
such
that
we
can
not
be
both
idle
and
at
ease
.
An
*NL*
inner
voice
tells
us
we
are
in
the
wrong
if
we
are
idle
.
If
man
could
*NL*
find
a
state
in
which
he
felt
that
though
idle
he
was
fulfilling
his
*NL*
duty
,
he
would
have
found
one
of
the
conditions
of
man
's
primitive
*NL*
blessedness
.
And
such
a
state
of
obligatory
and
irreproachable
idleness
*NL*
is
the
lot
of
a
whole
class
--
the
military
.
The
chief
attraction
of
*NL*
military
service
has
consisted
and
will
consist
in
this
compulsory
and
*NL*
irreproachable
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
experienced
this
blissful
condition
to
the
full
when
,
*NL*
after
1807
,
he
continued
to
serve
in
the
Pavlograd
regiment
,
in
which
he
*NL*
already
commanded
the
squadron
he
had
taken
over
from
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
become
a
bluff
,
good-natured
fellow
,
whom
his
Moscow
*NL*
acquaintances
would
have
considered
rather
bad
form
,
but
who
was
liked
*NL*
and
respected
by
his
comrades
,
subordinates
,
and
superiors
,
and
was
well
*NL*
contented
with
his
life
.
Of
late
,
in
1809
,
he
found
in
letters
from
home
*NL*
more
frequent
complaints
from
his
mother
that
their
affairs
were
falling
*NL*
into
greater
and
greater
disorder
,
and
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
come
*NL*
back
to
gladden
and
comfort
his
old
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reading
these
letters
,
Nicholas
felt
a
dread
of
their
wanting
to
take
*NL*
him
away
from
surroundings
in
which
,
protected
from
all
the
*NL*
entanglements
of
life
,
he
was
living
so
calmly
and
quietly
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
re-enter
that
whirlpool
of
life
,
with
*NL*
its
embarrassments
and
affairs
to
be
straightened
out
,
its
accounts
with
*NL*
stewards
,
quarrels
,
and
intrigues
,
its
ties
,
society
,
and
with
Sonya
's
*NL*
love
and
his
promise
to
her
.
It
was
all
dreadfully
difficult
and
*NL*
complicated
;
and
he
replied
to
his
mother
in
cold
,
formal
letters
in
*NL*
French
,
beginning
:
``
My
dear
Mamma
,
''
and
ending
:
``
Your
obedient
son
,
''
*NL*
which
said
nothing
of
when
he
would
return
.
In
1810
he
received
letters
*NL*
from
his
parents
,
in
which
they
told
him
of
Natasha
's
engagement
to
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
and
that
the
wedding
would
be
in
a
year
's
time
because
the
*NL*
old
prince
made
difficulties
.
This
letter
grieved
and
mortified
*NL*
Nicholas
.
In
the
first
place
he
was
sorry
that
Natasha
,
for
whom
he
*NL*
cared
more
than
for
anyone
else
in
the
family
,
should
be
lost
to
the
*NL*
home
;
and
secondly
,
from
his
hussar
point
of
view
,
he
regretted
not
to
*NL*
have
been
there
to
show
that
fellow
Bolkonski
that
connection
with
him
*NL*
was
no
such
great
honor
after
all
,
and
that
if
he
loved
Natasha
he
might
*NL*
dispense
with
permission
from
his
dotard
father
.
For
a
moment
he
*NL*
hesitated
whether
he
should
not
apply
for
leave
in
order
to
see
Natasha
*NL*
before
she
was
married
,
but
then
came
the
maneuvers
,
and
considerations
*NL*
about
Sonya
and
about
the
confusion
of
their
affairs
,
and
Nicholas
again
*NL*
put
it
off
.
But
in
the
spring
of
that
year
,
he
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
his
mother
,
written
without
his
father
's
knowledge
,
and
that
letter
*NL*
persuaded
him
to
return
.
She
wrote
that
if
he
did
not
come
and
take
*NL*
matters
in
hand
,
their
whole
property
would
be
sold
by
auction
and
they
*NL*
would
all
have
to
go
begging
.
The
count
was
so
weak
,
and
trusted
Mitenka
*NL*
so
much
,
and
was
so
good-natured
,
that
everybody
took
advantage
of
him
*NL*
and
things
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
I
implore
you
,
*NL*
come
at
once
if
you
do
not
wish
to
make
me
and
the
whole
family
*NL*
wretched
,
''
wrote
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
touched
Nicholas
.
He
had
that
common
sense
of
a
matter-of
-
*NL*
fact
man
which
showed
him
what
he
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
right
thing
now
was
,
if
not
to
retire
from
the
service
,
at
any
rate
*NL*
to
go
home
on
leave
.
Why
he
had
to
go
he
did
not
know
;
but
after
his
*NL*
after-dinner
nap
he
gave
orders
to
saddle
Mars
,
an
extremely
vicious
*NL*
gray
stallion
that
had
not
been
ridden
for
a
long
time
,
and
when
he
*NL*
returned
with
the
horse
all
in
a
lather
,
he
informed
Lavrushka
*NL*
-LRB-
Denisov
's
servant
who
had
remained
with
him
-RRB-
and
his
comrades
who
*NL*
turned
up
in
the
evening
that
he
was
applying
for
leave
and
was
going
*NL*
home
.
Difficult
and
strange
as
it
was
for
him
to
reflect
that
he
would
*NL*
go
away
without
having
heard
from
the
staff
--
and
this
interested
him
*NL*
extremely
--
whether
he
was
promoted
to
a
captaincy
or
would
receive
the
*NL*
Order
of
St.
Anne
for
the
last
maneuvers
;
strange
as
it
was
to
think
*NL*
that
he
would
go
away
without
having
sold
his
three
roans
to
the
Polish
*NL*
Count
Golukhovski
,
who
was
bargaining
for
the
horses
Rostov
had
betted
*NL*
he
would
sell
for
two
thousand
rubles
;
incomprehensible
as
it
seemed
*NL*
that
the
ball
the
hussars
were
giving
in
honor
of
the
Polish
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Przazdziecka
-LRB-
out
of
rivalry
to
the
uhlans
who
had
given
*NL*
one
in
honor
of
their
Polish
Mademoiselle
Borzozowska
-RRB-
would
take
place
*NL*
without
him
--
he
knew
he
must
go
away
from
this
good
,
bright
world
to
*NL*
somewhere
where
everything
was
stupid
and
confused
.
A
week
later
he
*NL*
obtained
his
leave
.
His
hussar
comrades
--
not
only
those
of
his
own
*NL*
regiment
,
but
the
whole
brigade
--
gave
Rostov
a
dinner
to
which
the
*NL*
subscription
was
fifteen
rubles
a
head
,
and
at
which
there
were
two
*NL*
bands
and
two
choirs
of
singers
.
Rostov
danced
the
Trepak
with
Major
*NL*
Basov
;
the
tipsy
officers
tossed
,
embraced
,
and
dropped
Rostov
;
the
*NL*
soldiers
of
the
third
squadron
tossed
him
too
,
and
shouted
``
hurrah
!
''
and
*NL*
then
they
put
him
in
his
sleigh
and
escorted
him
as
far
as
the
first
*NL*
post
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
half
of
the
journey
--
from
Kremenchug
to
Kiev
--
all
*NL*
Rostov
's
thoughts
,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
,
were
behind
him
,
with
the
*NL*
squadron
;
but
when
he
had
gone
more
than
halfway
he
began
to
forget
his
*NL*
three
roans
and
Dozhoyveyko
,
his
quartermaster
,
and
to
wonder
anxiously
*NL*
how
things
would
be
at
Otradnoe
and
what
he
would
find
there
.
Thoughts
*NL*
of
home
grew
stronger
the
nearer
he
approached
it
--
far
stronger
,
as
*NL*
though
this
feeling
of
his
was
subject
to
the
law
by
which
the
force
of
*NL*
attraction
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
.
At
*NL*
the
last
post
station
before
Otradnoe
he
gave
the
driver
a
three-ruble
*NL*
tip
,
and
on
arriving
he
ran
breathlessly
,
like
a
boy
,
up
the
steps
of
*NL*
his
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
rapture
of
meeting
,
and
after
that
odd
feeling
of
unsatisfied
*NL*
expectation
--
the
feeling
that
``
everything
is
just
the
same
,
so
why
did
I
*NL*
hurry
?
''
--
Nicholas
began
to
settle
down
in
his
old
home
world
.
His
father
*NL*
and
mother
were
much
the
same
,
only
a
little
older
.
What
was
new
in
them
*NL*
was
a
certain
uneasiness
and
occasional
discord
,
which
there
used
not
to
*NL*
be
,
and
which
,
as
Nicholas
soon
found
out
,
was
due
to
the
bad
state
of
*NL*
their
affairs
.
Sonya
was
nearly
twenty
;
she
had
stopped
growing
prettier
*NL*
and
promised
nothing
more
than
she
was
already
,
but
that
was
enough
.
She
*NL*
exhaled
happiness
and
love
from
the
time
Nicholas
returned
,
and
the
*NL*
faithful
,
unalterable
love
of
this
girl
had
a
gladdening
effect
on
him
.
*NL*
Petya
and
Natasha
surprised
Nicholas
most
.
Petya
was
a
big
handsome
boy
*NL*
of
thirteen
,
merry
,
witty
,
and
mischievous
,
with
a
voice
that
was
*NL*
already
breaking
.
As
for
Natasha
,
for
a
long
while
Nicholas
wondered
and
*NL*
laughed
whenever
he
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
the
same
at
all
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
Am
I
uglier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
but
what
dignity
?
A
princess
!
''
he
whispered
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
about
her
romance
with
Prince
Andrew
and
of
his
visit
to
*NL*
Otradnoe
and
showed
him
his
last
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
glad
?
''
Natasha
asked
.
``
I
am
so
tranquil
and
happy
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
,
''
answered
Nicholas
.
``
He
is
an
excellent
fellow
...
And
are
*NL*
you
very
much
in
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
I
put
it
?
''
replied
Natasha
.
``
I
was
in
love
with
Boris
,
with
*NL*
my
teacher
,
and
with
Denisov
,
but
this
is
quite
different
.
I
feel
at
*NL*
peace
and
settled
.
I
know
that
no
better
man
than
he
exists
,
and
I
am
*NL*
calm
and
contented
now
.
Not
at
all
as
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
expressed
his
disapproval
of
the
postponement
of
the
marriage
*NL*
for
a
year
;
but
Natasha
attacked
her
brother
with
exasperation
,
proving
*NL*
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
,
and
that
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
*NL*
to
enter
a
family
against
the
father
's
will
,
and
that
she
herself
wished
*NL*
it
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
at
all
understand
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
was
silent
and
agreed
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
often
wondered
as
he
looked
at
her
.
She
did
not
seem
at
all
*NL*
like
a
girl
in
love
and
parted
from
her
affianced
husband
.
She
was
even
-
*NL*
tempered
and
calm
and
quite
as
cheerful
as
of
old
.
This
amazed
Nicholas
*NL*
and
even
made
him
regard
Bolkonski
's
courtship
skeptically
.
He
could
not
*NL*
believe
that
her
fate
was
sealed
,
especially
as
he
had
not
seen
her
with
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
It
always
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
something
not
*NL*
quite
right
about
this
intended
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
this
delay
?
Why
no
betrothal
?
''
he
thought
.
Once
,
when
he
had
*NL*
touched
on
this
topic
with
his
mother
,
he
discovered
,
to
his
surprise
*NL*
and
somewhat
to
his
satisfaction
,
that
in
the
depth
of
her
soul
she
too
*NL*
had
doubts
about
this
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
he
writes
,
''
said
she
,
showing
her
son
a
letter
of
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
,
with
that
latent
grudge
a
mother
always
has
in
regard
to
a
*NL*
daughter
's
future
married
happiness
,
``
he
writes
that
he
wo
n't
come
*NL*
before
December
.
What
can
be
keeping
him
?
Illness
,
probably
!
His
health
*NL*
is
very
delicate
.
Do
n't
tell
Natasha
.
And
do
n't
attach
importance
to
her
*NL*
being
so
bright
:
that
's
because
she
's
living
through
the
last
days
of
*NL*
her
girlhood
,
but
I
know
what
she
is
like
every
time
we
receive
a
letter
*NL*
from
him
!
However
,
God
grant
that
everything
turns
out
well
!
''
-LRB-
She
*NL*
always
ended
with
these
words
.
-RRB-
``
He
is
an
excellent
man
!

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
After
reaching
home
Nicholas
was
at
first
serious
and
even
dull
.
He
was
*NL*
worried
by
the
impending
necessity
of
interfering
in
the
stupid
business
*NL*
matters
for
which
his
mother
had
called
him
home
.
To
throw
off
this
*NL*
burden
as
quickly
as
possible
,
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
*NL*
went
,
angry
and
scowling
and
without
answering
questions
as
to
where
he
*NL*
was
going
,
to
Mitenka
's
lodge
and
demanded
an
account
of
everything
.
But
*NL*
what
an
account
of
everything
might
be
Nicholas
knew
even
less
than
the
*NL*
frightened
and
bewildered
Mitenka
.
The
conversation
and
the
examination
*NL*
of
the
accounts
with
Mitenka
did
not
last
long
.
The
village
elder
,
a
*NL*
peasant
delegate
,
and
the
village
clerk
,
who
were
waiting
in
the
*NL*
passage
,
heard
with
fear
and
delight
first
the
young
count
's
voice
*NL*
roaring
and
snapping
and
rising
louder
and
louder
,
and
then
words
of
*NL*
abuse
,
dreadful
words
,
ejaculated
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Robber
!
...
Ungrateful
wretch
!
...
I
'll
hack
the
dog
to
pieces
!
I
'm
not
*NL*
my
father
!
...
Robbing
us
!
...
''
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
with
no
less
fear
and
delight
they
saw
how
the
young
count
,
red
in
*NL*
the
face
and
with
bloodshot
eyes
,
dragged
Mitenka
out
by
the
scruff
of
*NL*
the
neck
and
applied
his
foot
and
knee
to
his
behind
with
great
agility
*NL*
at
convenient
moments
between
the
words
,
shouting
,
``
Be
off
!
Never
let
me
*NL*
see
your
face
here
again
,
you
villain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitenka
flew
headlong
down
the
six
steps
and
ran
away
into
the
*NL*
shrubbery
.
-LRB-
This
shrubbery
was
a
well-known
haven
of
refuge
for
culprits
*NL*
at
Otradnoe
.
Mitenka
himself
,
returning
tipsy
from
the
town
,
used
to
*NL*
hide
there
,
and
many
of
the
residents
at
Otradnoe
,
hiding
from
Mitenka
,
*NL*
knew
of
its
protective
qualities
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mitenka
's
wife
and
sisters-in-law
thrust
their
heads
and
frightened
*NL*
faces
out
of
the
door
of
a
room
where
a
bright
samovar
was
boiling
and
*NL*
where
the
steward
's
high
bedstead
stood
with
its
patchwork
quilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
count
paid
no
heed
to
them
,
but
,
breathing
hard
,
passed
by
*NL*
with
resolute
strides
and
went
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
who
heard
at
once
from
the
maids
what
had
happened
at
the
*NL*
lodge
,
was
calmed
by
the
thought
that
now
their
affairs
would
certainly
*NL*
improve
,
but
on
the
other
hand
felt
anxious
as
to
the
effect
this
*NL*
excitement
might
have
on
her
son
.
She
went
several
times
to
his
door
on
*NL*
tiptoe
and
listened
,
as
he
lighted
one
pipe
after
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
old
count
called
his
son
aside
and
,
with
an
embarrassed
*NL*
smile
,
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
,
my
dear
boy
,
it
's
a
pity
you
got
excited
!
Mitenka
has
*NL*
told
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
``
that
I
should
never
understand
anything
in
*NL*
this
crazy
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
angry
that
he
had
not
entered
those
700
rubles
.
But
they
were
*NL*
carried
forward
--
and
you
did
not
look
at
the
other
page
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
he
is
a
blackguard
and
a
thief
!
I
know
he
is
!
And
what
I
have
*NL*
done
,
I
have
done
;
but
,
if
you
like
,
I
wo
n't
speak
to
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
boy
''
-LRB-
the
count
,
too
,
felt
embarrassed
.
He
knew
he
had
*NL*
mismanaged
his
wife
's
property
and
was
to
blame
toward
his
children
,
but
*NL*
he
did
not
know
how
to
remedy
it
-RRB-
.
``
No
,
I
beg
you
to
attend
to
the
*NL*
business
.
I
am
old
.
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Papa
.
Forgive
me
if
I
have
caused
you
unpleasantness
.
I
understand
*NL*
it
all
less
than
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
all
these
peasants
,
and
money
matters
,
and
carryings
forward
*NL*
from
page
to
page
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
used
to
understand
what
a
`
corner
'
*NL*
and
the
stakes
at
cards
meant
,
but
carrying
forward
to
another
page
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
at
all
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
and
after
that
he
did
not
*NL*
meddle
in
business
affairs
.
But
once
the
countess
called
her
son
and
*NL*
informed
him
that
she
had
a
promissory
note
from
Anna
Mikhaylovna
for
*NL*
two
thousand
rubles
,
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
doing
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
answered
Nicholas
.
``
You
say
it
rests
with
me
.
Well
,
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
and
I
do
n't
like
Boris
,
but
they
were
our
friends
and
*NL*
poor
.
Well
then
,
this
!
''
and
he
tore
up
the
note
,
and
by
so
doing
caused
*NL*
the
old
countess
to
weep
tears
of
joy
.
After
that
,
young
Rostov
took
no
*NL*
further
part
in
any
business
affairs
,
but
devoted
himself
with
*NL*
passionate
enthusiasm
to
what
was
to
him
a
new
pursuit
--
the
chase
--
for
*NL*
which
his
father
kept
a
large
establishment
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
already
growing
wintry
and
morning
frosts
congealed
an
*NL*
earth
saturated
by
autumn
rains
.
The
verdure
had
thickened
and
its
*NL*
bright
green
stood
out
sharply
against
the
brownish
strips
of
winter
rye
*NL*
trodden
down
by
the
cattle
,
and
against
the
pale-yellow
stubble
of
the
*NL*
spring
buckwheat
.
The
wooded
ravines
and
the
copses
,
which
at
the
end
of
*NL*
August
had
still
been
green
islands
amid
black
fields
and
stubble
,
had
*NL*
become
golden
and
bright-red
islands
amid
the
green
winter
rye
.
The
*NL*
hares
had
already
half
changed
their
summer
coats
,
the
fox
cubs
were
*NL*
beginning
to
scatter
,
and
the
young
wolves
were
bigger
than
dogs
.
It
was
*NL*
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
the
chase
.
The
hounds
of
that
ardent
young
*NL*
sportsman
Rostov
had
not
merely
reached
hard
winter
condition
,
but
were
*NL*
so
jaded
that
at
a
meeting
of
the
huntsmen
it
was
decided
to
give
them
a
*NL*
three
days
'
rest
and
then
,
on
the
sixteenth
of
September
,
to
go
on
a
*NL*
distant
expedition
,
starting
from
the
oak
grove
where
there
was
an
*NL*
undisturbed
litter
of
wolf
cubs
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
the
hounds
remained
at
home
.
It
was
frosty
and
the
air
was
*NL*
sharp
,
but
toward
evening
the
sky
became
overcast
and
it
began
to
thaw
.
*NL*
On
the
fifteenth
,
when
young
Rostov
,
in
his
dressing
gown
,
looked
out
of
*NL*
the
window
,
he
saw
it
was
an
unsurpassable
morning
for
hunting
:
it
was
*NL*
as
if
the
sky
were
melting
and
sinking
to
the
earth
without
any
wind
.
*NL*
The
only
motion
in
the
air
was
that
of
the
dripping
,
microscopic
*NL*
particles
of
drizzling
mist
.
The
bare
twigs
in
the
garden
were
hung
with
*NL*
transparent
drops
which
fell
on
the
freshly
fallen
leaves
.
The
earth
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
garden
looked
wet
and
black
and
glistened
like
poppy
seed
*NL*
and
at
a
short
distance
merged
into
the
dull
,
moist
veil
of
mist
.
*NL*
Nicholas
went
out
into
the
wet
and
muddy
porch
.
There
was
a
smell
of
*NL*
decaying
leaves
and
of
dog
.
Milka
,
a
black-spotted
,
broad-haunched
bitch
*NL*
with
prominent
black
eyes
,
got
up
on
seeing
her
master
,
stretched
her
*NL*
hind
legs
,
lay
down
like
a
hare
,
and
then
suddenly
jumped
up
and
licked
*NL*
him
right
on
his
nose
and
mustache
.
Another
borzoi
,
a
dog
,
catching
*NL*
sight
of
his
master
from
the
garden
path
,
arched
his
back
and
,
rushing
*NL*
headlong
toward
the
porch
with
lifted
tail
,
began
rubbing
himself
*NL*
against
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O-hoy
!
''
came
at
that
moment
,
that
inimitable
huntsman
's
call
which
*NL*
unites
the
deepest
bass
with
the
shrillest
tenor
,
and
round
the
corner
*NL*
came
Daniel
the
head
huntsman
and
head
kennelman
,
a
gray
,
wrinkled
old
*NL*
man
with
hair
cut
straight
over
his
forehead
,
Ukrainian
fashion
,
a
long
*NL*
bent
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
that
look
of
independence
and
scorn
of
*NL*
everything
that
is
only
seen
in
huntsmen
.
He
doffed
his
Circassian
cap
*NL*
to
his
master
and
looked
at
him
scornfully
.
This
scorn
was
not
offensive
*NL*
to
his
master
.
Nicholas
knew
that
this
Daniel
,
disdainful
of
everybody
*NL*
and
who
considered
himself
above
them
,
was
all
the
same
his
serf
and
*NL*
huntsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daniel
!
''
Nicholas
said
timidly
,
conscious
at
the
sight
of
the
weather
,
*NL*
the
hounds
,
and
the
huntsman
that
he
was
being
carried
away
by
that
*NL*
irresistible
passion
for
sport
which
makes
a
man
forget
all
his
previous
*NL*
resolutions
,
as
a
lover
forgets
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
orders
,
your
excellency
?
''
said
the
huntsman
in
his
deep
bass
,
deep
*NL*
as
a
proto-deacon
's
and
hoarse
with
hallooing
--
and
two
flashing
black
*NL*
eyes
gazed
from
under
his
brows
at
his
master
,
who
was
silent
.
``
Can
you
*NL*
resist
it
?
''
those
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
day
,
eh
?
For
a
hunt
and
a
gallop
,
eh
?
''
asked
Nicholas
,
*NL*
scratching
Milka
behind
the
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daniel
did
not
answer
,
but
winked
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sent
Uvarka
at
dawn
to
listen
,
''
his
bass
boomed
out
after
a
minute
's
*NL*
pause
.
``
He
says
she
's
moved
them
into
the
Otradnoe
enclosure
.
They
were
*NL*
howling
there
.
''
-LRB-
This
meant
that
the
she-wolf
,
about
whom
they
both
*NL*
knew
,
had
moved
with
her
cubs
to
the
Otradnoe
copse
,
a
small
place
a
*NL*
mile
and
a
half
from
the
house
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ought
to
go
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
said
Nicholas
.
``
Come
to
me
with
*NL*
Uvarka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
put
off
feeding
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
Daniel
and
Uvarka
were
standing
in
Nicholas
'
big
*NL*
study
.
Though
Daniel
was
not
a
big
man
,
to
see
him
in
a
room
was
like
*NL*
seeing
a
horse
or
a
bear
on
the
floor
among
the
furniture
and
*NL*
surroundings
of
human
life
.
Daniel
himself
felt
this
,
and
as
usual
stood
*NL*
just
inside
the
door
,
trying
to
speak
softly
and
not
move
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
breaking
something
in
the
master
's
apartment
,
and
he
hastened
to
say
all
*NL*
that
was
necessary
so
as
to
get
from
under
that
ceiling
,
out
into
the
*NL*
open
under
the
sky
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
his
inquiries
and
extorted
from
Daniel
an
opinion
that
*NL*
the
hounds
were
fit
-LRB-
Daniel
himself
wished
to
go
hunting
-RRB-
,
Nicholas
*NL*
ordered
the
horses
to
be
saddled
.
But
just
as
Daniel
was
about
to
go
*NL*
Natasha
came
in
with
rapid
steps
,
not
having
done
up
her
hair
or
*NL*
finished
dressing
and
with
her
old
nurse
's
big
shawl
wrapped
round
her
.
*NL*
Petya
ran
in
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
?
''
asked
Natasha
.
``
I
knew
you
would
!
Sonya
said
you
*NL*
would
n't
go
,
but
I
knew
that
today
is
the
sort
of
day
when
you
could
n't
*NL*
help
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
are
going
,
''
replied
Nicholas
reluctantly
,
for
today
,
as
he
*NL*
intended
to
hunt
seriously
,
he
did
not
want
to
take
Natasha
and
Petya
.
*NL*
``
We
are
going
,
but
only
wolf
hunting
:
it
would
be
dull
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
is
my
greatest
pleasure
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
It
's
not
fair
;
you
*NL*
are
going
by
yourself
,
are
having
the
horses
saddled
and
said
nothing
to
*NL*
us
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
barrier
bars
a
Russian
's
path

--
we
'll
go

shouted

``
But
you

Mamma
said
you
must

Nicholas
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
'll
go

I
shall
certainly
go

said
Natasha
decisively

``
Daniel

us

Michael
must
come
with
my
dogs

''
she
*NL*
added
to
the
huntsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Daniel
irksome
and
improper
to
be
in
a
room
at
all
,
but
to
*NL*
have
anything
to
do
with
a
young
lady
seemed
to
him
impossible
.
He
cast
*NL*
down
his
eyes
and
hurried
out
as
if
it
were
none
of
his
business
,
*NL*
careful
as
he
went
not
to
inflict
any
accidental
injury
on
the
young
*NL*
lady

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
,
who
had
always
kept
up
an
enormous
hunting
establishment
*NL*
but
had
now
handed
it
all
completely
over
to
his
son
's
care
,
being
in
*NL*
very
good
spirits
on
this
fifteenth
of
September
,
prepared
to
go
out
*NL*
with
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
hour
's
time
the
whole
hunting
party
was
at
the
porch
.
Nicholas
,
*NL*
with
a
stern
and
serious
air
which
showed
that
now
was
no
time
for
*NL*
attending
to
trifles
,
went
past
Natasha
and
Petya
who
were
trying
to
*NL*
tell
him
something
.
He
had
a
look
at
all
the
details
of
the
hunt
,
sent
a
*NL*
pack
of
hounds
and
huntsmen
on
ahead
to
find
the
quarry
,
mounted
his
*NL*
chestnut
Donets
,
and
whistling
to
his
own
leash
of
borzois
,
set
off
*NL*
across
the
threshing
ground
to
a
field
leading
to
the
Otradnoe
wood
.
The
*NL*
old
count
's
horse
,
a
sorrel
gelding
called
Viflyanka
,
was
led
by
the
*NL*
groom
in
attendance
on
him
,
while
the
count
himself
was
to
drive
in
a
*NL*
small
trap
straight
to
a
spot
reserved
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
taking
fifty-four
hounds
,
with
six
hunt
attendants
and
*NL*
whippers-in
.
Besides
the
family
,
there
were
eight
borzoi
kennelmen
and
*NL*
more
than
forty
borzois
,
so
that
,
with
the
borzois
on
the
leash
*NL*
belonging
to
members
of
the
family
,
there
were
about
a
hundred
and
*NL*
thirty
dogs
and
twenty
horsemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
dog
knew
its
master
and
its
call
.
Each
man
in
the
hunt
knew
his
*NL*
business
,
his
place
,
what
he
had
to
do
.
As
soon
as
they
had
passed
the
*NL*
fence
they
all
spread
out
evenly
and
quietly
,
without
noise
or
talk
,
*NL*
along
the
road
and
field
leading
to
the
Otradnoe
covert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
stepped
over
the
field
as
over
a
thick
carpet
,
now
and
then
*NL*
splashing
into
puddles
as
they
crossed
a
road
.
The
misty
sky
still
*NL*
seemed
to
descend
evenly
and
imperceptibly
toward
the
earth
,
the
air
was
*NL*
still
,
warm
,
and
silent
.
Occasionally
the
whistle
of
a
huntsman
,
the
*NL*
snort
of
a
horse
,
the
crack
of
a
whip
,
or
the
whine
of
a
straggling
*NL*
hound
could
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
gone
a
little
less
than
a
mile
,
five
more
riders
with
dogs
*NL*
appeared
out
of
the
mist
,
approaching
the
Rostovs
.
In
front
rode
a
*NL*
fresh-looking
,
handsome
old
man
with
a
large
gray
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Uncle
!
''
said
Nicholas
,
when
the
old
man
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
Come
on
!
...
I
was
sure
of
it
,
''
began
``
Uncle
.
''
-LRB-
He
was
a
*NL*
distant
relative
of
the
Rostovs
'
,
a
man
of
small
means
,
and
their
*NL*
neighbor
.
-RRB-
``
I
knew
you
would
n't
be
able
to
resist
it
and
it
's
a
good
*NL*
thing
you
're
going
.
That
's
it
!
Come
on
!
''
-LRB-
This
was
``
Uncle
's
''
favorite
*NL*
expression
.
-RRB-
``
Take
the
covert
at
once
,
for
my
Girchik
says
the
Ilagins
*NL*
are
at
Korniki
with
their
hounds
.
That
's
it
.
Come
on
!
...
They
'll
take
*NL*
the
cubs
from
under
your
very
nose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
where
I
'm
going
.
Shall
we
join
up
our
packs
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hounds
were
joined
into
one
pack
,
and
``
Uncle
''
and
Nicholas
rode
on
*NL*
side
by
side
.
Natasha
,
muffled
up
in
shawls
which
did
not
hide
her
eager
*NL*
face
and
shining
eyes
,
galloped
up
to
them
.
She
was
followed
by
Petya
*NL*
who
always
kept
close
to
her
,
by
Michael
,
a
huntsman
,
and
by
a
groom
*NL*
appointed
to
look
after
her
.
Petya
,
who
was
laughing
,
whipped
and
pulled
*NL*
at
his
horse
.
Natasha
sat
easily
and
confidently
on
her
black
Arabchik
*NL*
and
reined
him
in
without
effort
with
a
firm
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
looked
round
disapprovingly
at
Petya
and
Natasha
.
He
did
not
*NL*
like
to
combine
frivolity
with
the
serious
business
of
hunting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Uncle
!
We
are
going
too
!
''
shouted
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
good
morning
!
But
do
n't
go
overriding
the
hounds
,
''
said
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
what
a
fine
dog
Trunila
is
!
He
knew
me
,
''
said
Natasha
,
*NL*
referring
to
her
favorite
hound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
Trunila
is
not
a
`
dog
,
'
but
a
harrier
,
''
thought
*NL*
Nicholas
,
and
looked
sternly
at
his
sister
,
trying
to
make
her
feel
the
*NL*
distance
that
ought
to
separate
them
at
that
moment
.
Natasha
understood
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
think
we
'll
be
in
anyone
's
way
,
Uncle
,
''
she
said
.
``
We
'll
go
*NL*
to
our
places
and
wo
n't
budge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
thing
too
,
little
countess
,
''
said
``
Uncle
,
''
``
only
mind
you
do
n't
*NL*
fall
off
your
horse
,
''
he
added
,
``
because
--
that
's
it
,
come
on
!
--
you
've
*NL*
nothing
to
hold
on
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
oasis
of
the
Otradnoe
covert
came
in
sight
a
few
hundred
yards
off
,
*NL*
the
huntsmen
were
already
nearing
it
.
Rostov
,
having
finally
settled
*NL*
with
``
Uncle
''
where
they
should
set
on
the
hounds
,
and
having
shown
*NL*
Natasha
where
she
was
to
stand
--
a
spot
where
nothing
could
possibly
run
*NL*
out
--
went
round
above
the
ravine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
nephew
,
you
're
going
for
a
big
wolf
,
''
said
``
Uncle
.
''
``
Mind
and
*NL*
do
n't
let
her
slip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
may
happen
,
''
answered
Rostov
.
``
Karay
,
here
!
''
he
shouted
,
*NL*
answering
``
Uncle
's
''
remark
by
this
call
to
his
borzoi
.
Karay
was
a
*NL*
shaggy
old
dog
with
a
hanging
jowl
,
famous
for
having
tackled
a
big
wolf
*NL*
unaided
.
They
all
took
up
their
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
,
knowing
his
son
's
ardor
in
the
hunt
,
hurried
so
as
not
to
*NL*
be
late
,
and
the
huntsmen
had
not
yet
reached
their
places
when
Count
*NL*
Ilya
Rostov
,
cheerful
,
flushed
,
and
with
quivering
cheeks
,
drove
up
with
*NL*
his
black
horses
over
the
winter
rye
to
the
place
reserved
for
him
,
*NL*
where
a
wolf
might
come
out
.
Having
straightened
his
coat
and
fastened
*NL*
on
his
hunting
knives
and
horn
,
he
mounted
his
good
,
sleek
,
well-fed
,
*NL*
and
comfortable
horse
,
Viflyanka
,
which
was
turning
gray
,
like
himself
.
*NL*
His
horses
and
trap
were
sent
home
.
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
though
not
at
*NL*
heart
a
keen
sportsman
,
knew
the
rules
of
the
hunt
well
,
and
rode
to
the
*NL*
bushy
edge
of
the
road
where
he
was
to
stand
,
arranged
his
reins
,
*NL*
settled
himself
in
the
saddle
,
and
,
feeling
that
he
was
ready
,
looked
*NL*
about
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
him
was
Simon
Chekmar
,
his
personal
attendant
,
an
old
horseman
*NL*
now
somewhat
stiff
in
the
saddle
.
Chekmar
held
in
leash
three
formidable
*NL*
wolfhounds
,
who
had
,
however
,
grown
fat
like
their
master
and
his
horse
.
*NL*
Two
wise
old
dogs
lay
down
unleashed
.
Some
hundred
paces
farther
along
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
wood
stood
Mitka
,
the
count
's
other
groom
,
a
daring
*NL*
horseman
and
keen
rider
to
hounds
.
Before
the
hunt
,
by
old
custom
,
the
*NL*
count
had
drunk
a
silver
cupful
of
mulled
brandy
,
taken
a
snack
,
and
*NL*
washed
it
down
with
half
a
bottle
of
his
favorite
Bordeaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
somewhat
flushed
with
the
wine
and
the
drive
.
His
eyes
were
*NL*
rather
moist
and
glittered
more
than
usual
,
and
as
he
sat
in
his
saddle
,
*NL*
wrapped
up
in
his
fur
coat
,
he
looked
like
a
child
taken
out
for
an
*NL*
outing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thin
,
hollow-cheeked
Chekmar
,
having
got
everything
ready
,
kept
*NL*
glancing
at
his
master
with
whom
he
had
lived
on
the
best
of
terms
for
*NL*
thirty
years
,
and
understanding
the
mood
he
was
in
expected
a
pleasant
*NL*
chat
.
A
third
person
rode
up
circumspectly
through
the
wood
-LRB-
it
was
*NL*
plain
that
he
had
had
a
lesson
-RRB-
and
stopped
behind
the
count
.
This
*NL*
person
was
a
gray-bearded
old
man
in
a
woman
's
cloak
,
with
a
tall
peaked
*NL*
cap
on
his
head
.
He
was
the
buffoon
,
who
went
by
a
woman
's
name
,
*NL*
Nastasya
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Nastasya
Ivanovna
!
''
whispered
the
count
,
winking
at
him
.
``
If
you
*NL*
scare
away
the
beast
,
Daniel
'll
give
it
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
thing
or
two
myself
!
''
said
Nastasya
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
whispered
the
count
and
turned
to
Simon
.
``
Have
you
seen
the
*NL*
young
countess
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
young
Count
Peter
,
by
the
Zharov
rank
grass
,
''
answered
Simon
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
Though
she
's
a
lady
,
she
's
very
fond
of
hunting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
surprised
at
the
way
she
rides
,
Simon
,
eh
?
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
``
She
's
as
good
as
many
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
!
It
's
marvelous
.
So
bold
,
so
easy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Nicholas
?
Where
is
he
?
By
the
Lyadov
upland
,
is
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
He
knows
where
to
stand
.
He
understands
the
matter
so
well
*NL*
that
Daniel
and
I
are
often
quite
astounded
,
''
said
Simon
,
well
knowing
*NL*
what
would
please
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rides
well
,
eh
?
And
how
well
he
looks
on
his
horse
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
perfect
picture
!
How
he
chased
a
fox
out
of
the
rank
grass
by
the
*NL*
Zavarzinsk
thicket
the
other
day
!
Leaped
a
fearful
place
;
what
a
sight
*NL*
when
they
rushed
from
the
covert
...
the
horse
worth
a
thousand
rubles
*NL*
and
the
rider
beyond
all
price
!
Yes
,
one
would
have
to
search
far
to
*NL*
find
another
as
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
search
far
...
''
repeated
the
count
,
evidently
sorry
Simon
had
not
*NL*
said
more
.
``
To
search
far
,
''
he
said
,
turning
back
the
skirt
of
his
coat
*NL*
to
get
at
his
snuffbox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
day
when
he
came
out
from
Mass
in
full
uniform
,
Michael
*NL*
Sidorych
...
''
Simon
did
not
finish
,
for
on
the
still
air
he
had
*NL*
distinctly
caught
the
music
of
the
hunt
with
only
two
or
three
hounds
*NL*
giving
tongue
.
He
bent
down
his
head
and
listened
,
shaking
a
warning
*NL*
finger
at
his
master
.
``
They
are
on
the
scent
of
the
cubs
...
''
he
*NL*
whispered
,
``
straight
to
the
Lyadov
uplands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
,
forgetting
to
smooth
out
the
smile
on
his
face
,
looked
into
*NL*
the
distance
straight
before
him
,
down
the
narrow
open
space
,
holding
*NL*
the
snuffbox
in
his
hand
but
not
taking
any
.
After
the
cry
of
the
hounds
*NL*
came
the
deep
tones
of
the
wolf
call
from
Daniel
's
hunting
horn
;
the
*NL*
pack
joined
the
first
three
hounds
and
they
could
be
heard
in
full
cry
,
*NL*
with
that
peculiar
lift
in
the
note
that
indicates
that
they
are
after
a
*NL*
wolf
.
The
whippers-in
no
longer
set
on
the
hounds
,
but
changed
to
the
*NL*
cry
of
ulyulyu
,
and
above
the
others
rose
Daniel
's
voice
,
now
a
deep
*NL*
bass
,
now
piercingly
shrill
.
His
voice
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
wood
and
*NL*
carried
far
beyond
out
into
the
open
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
listening
a
few
moments
in
silence
,
the
count
and
his
attendant
*NL*
convinced
themselves
that
the
hounds
had
separated
into
two
packs
:
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
larger
pack
,
eagerly
giving
tongue
,
began
to
die
away
in
*NL*
the
distance
,
the
other
pack
rushed
by
the
wood
past
the
count
,
and
it
*NL*
was
with
this
that
Daniel
's
voice
was
heard
calling
ulyulyu
.
The
sounds
*NL*
of
both
packs
mingled
and
broke
apart
again
,
but
both
were
becoming
more
*NL*
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Simon
sighed
and
stooped
to
straighten
the
leash
a
young
borzoi
had
*NL*
entangled
;
the
count
too
sighed
and
,
noticing
the
snuffbox
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
opened
it
and
took
a
pinch
.
``
Back
!
''
cried
Simon
to
a
borzoi
that
was
*NL*
pushing
forward
out
of
the
wood
.
The
count
started
and
dropped
the
*NL*
snuffbox
.
Nastasya
Ivanovna
dismounted
to
pick
it
up
.
The
count
and
*NL*
Simon
were
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
unexpectedly
,
as
often
happens
,
the
sound
of
the
hunt
suddenly
*NL*
approached
,
as
if
the
hounds
in
full
cry
and
Daniel
ulyulyuing
were
just
*NL*
in
front
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
turned
and
saw
on
his
right
Mitka
staring
at
him
with
eyes
*NL*
starting
out
of
his
head
,
raising
his
cap
and
pointing
before
him
to
the
*NL*
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
''
he
shouted
,
in
a
voice
plainly
showing
that
he
had
long
*NL*
fretted
to
utter
that
word
,
and
letting
the
borzois
slip
he
galloped
*NL*
toward
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
and
Simon
galloped
out
of
the
wood
and
saw
on
their
left
a
*NL*
wolf
which
,
softly
swaying
from
side
to
side
,
was
coming
at
a
quiet
lope
*NL*
farther
to
the
left
to
the
very
place
where
they
were
standing
.
The
*NL*
angry
borzois
whined
and
getting
free
of
the
leash
rushed
past
the
*NL*
horses
'
feet
at
the
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wolf
paused
,
turned
its
heavy
forehead
toward
the
dogs
awkwardly
,
*NL*
like
a
man
suffering
from
the
quinsy
,
and
,
still
slightly
swaying
from
*NL*
side
to
side
,
gave
a
couple
of
leaps
and
with
a
swish
of
its
tail
*NL*
disappeared
into
the
skirt
of
the
wood
.
At
the
same
instant
,
with
a
cry
*NL*
like
a
wail
,
first
one
hound
,
then
another
,
and
then
another
,
sprang
*NL*
helter-skelter
from
the
wood
opposite
and
the
whole
pack
rushed
across
*NL*
the
field
toward
the
very
spot
where
the
wolf
had
disappeared
.
The
hazel
*NL*
bushes
parted
behind
the
hounds
and
Daniel
's
chestnut
horse
appeared
,
*NL*
dark
with
sweat
.
On
its
long
back
sat
Daniel
,
hunched
forward
,
capless
,
*NL*
his
disheveled
gray
hair
hanging
over
his
flushed
,
perspiring
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ulyulyulyu
!
ulyulyu
!
...
''
he
cried
.
When
he
caught
sight
of
the
count
*NL*
his
eyes
flashed
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blast
you
!
''
he
shouted
,
holding
up
his
whip
threateningly
at
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
let
the
wolf
go
!
...
What
sportsmen
!
''
and
as
if
scorning
to
say
*NL*
more
to
the
frightened
and
shamefaced
count
,
he
lashed
the
heaving
*NL*
flanks
of
his
sweating
chestnut
gelding
with
all
the
anger
the
count
had
*NL*
aroused
and
flew
off
after
the
hounds
.
The
count
,
like
a
punished
*NL*
schoolboy
,
looked
round
,
trying
by
a
smile
to
win
Simon
's
sympathy
for
*NL*
his
plight
.
But
Simon
was
no
longer
there
.
He
was
galloping
round
by
the
*NL*
bushes
while
the
field
was
coming
up
on
both
sides
,
all
trying
to
head
*NL*
the
wolf
,
but
it
vanished
into
the
wood
before
they
could
do
so
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
meanwhile
remained
at
his
post
,
waiting
for
the
wolf
.
By
*NL*
the
way
the
hunt
approached
and
receded
,
by
the
cries
of
the
dogs
whose
*NL*
notes
were
familiar
to
him
,
by
the
way
the
voices
of
the
huntsmen
*NL*
approached
,
receded
,
and
rose
,
he
realized
what
was
happening
at
the
*NL*
copse
.
He
knew
that
young
and
old
wolves
were
there
,
that
the
hounds
had
*NL*
separated
into
two
packs
,
that
somewhere
a
wolf
was
being
chased
,
and
*NL*
that
something
had
gone
wrong
.
He
expected
the
wolf
to
come
his
way
any
*NL*
moment
.
He
made
thousands
of
different
conjectures
as
to
where
and
from
*NL*
what
side
the
beast
would
come
and
how
he
would
set
upon
it
.
Hope
*NL*
alternated
with
despair
.
Several
times
he
addressed
a
prayer
to
God
that
*NL*
the
wolf
should
come
his
way
.
He
prayed
with
that
passionate
and
*NL*
shamefaced
feeling
with
which
men
pray
at
moments
of
great
excitement
*NL*
arising
from
trivial
causes
.
``
What
would
it
be
to
Thee
to
do
this
for
*NL*
me
?
''
he
said
to
God
.
``
I
know
Thou
art
great
,
and
that
it
is
a
sin
to
ask
*NL*
this
of
Thee
,
but
for
God
's
sake
do
let
the
old
wolf
come
my
way
and
let
*NL*
Karay
spring
at
it
--
in
sight
of
`
Uncle
'
who
is
watching
from
over
there
-
*NL*
-
and
seize
it
by
the
throat
in
a
death
grip
!
''
A
thousand
times
during
*NL*
that
half-hour
Rostov
cast
eager
and
restless
glances
over
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
wood
,
with
the
two
scraggy
oaks
rising
above
the
aspen
undergrowth
*NL*
and
the
gully
with
its
water-worn
side
and
``
Uncle
's
''
cap
just
visible
*NL*
above
the
bush
on
his
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
have
such
luck
,
''
thought
Rostov
,
``
yet
what
would
n't
it
be
*NL*
worth
!
It
is
not
to
be
!
Everywhere
,
at
cards
and
in
war
,
I
am
always
*NL*
unlucky
.
''
Memories
of
Austerlitz
and
of
Dolokhov
flashed
rapidly
and
*NL*
clearly
through
his
mind
.
``
Only
once
in
my
life
to
get
an
old
wolf
,
I
*NL*
want
only
that
!
''
thought
he
,
straining
eyes
and
ears
and
looking
to
the
*NL*
left
and
then
to
the
right
and
listening
to
the
slightest
variation
of
*NL*
note
in
the
cries
of
the
dogs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
looked
to
the
right
and
saw
something
running
toward
him
across
*NL*
the
deserted
field
.
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
''
thought
Rostov
,
taking
a
deep
*NL*
breath
,
as
a
man
does
at
the
coming
of
something
long
hoped
for
.
The
*NL*
height
of
happiness
was
reached
--
and
so
simply
,
without
warning
,
or
*NL*
noise
,
or
display
,
that
Rostov
could
not
believe
his
eyes
and
remained
*NL*
in
doubt
for
over
a
second
.
The
wolf
ran
forward
and
jumped
heavily
over
*NL*
a
gully
that
lay
in
her
path
.
She
was
an
old
animal
with
a
gray
back
and
*NL*
big
reddish
belly
.
She
ran
without
hurry
,
evidently
feeling
sure
that
no
*NL*
one
saw
her
.
Rostov
,
holding
his
breath
,
looked
round
at
the
borzois
.
*NL*
They
stood
or
lay
not
seeing
the
wolf
or
understanding
the
situation
.
*NL*
Old
Karay
had
turned
his
head
and
was
angrily
searching
for
fleas
,
*NL*
baring
his
yellow
teeth
and
snapping
at
his
hind
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ulyulyulyu
!
''
whispered
Rostov
,
pouting
his
lips
.
The
borzois
jumped
up
,
*NL*
jerking
the
rings
of
the
leashes
and
pricking
their
ears
.
Karay
finished
*NL*
scratching
his
hindquarters
and
,
cocking
his
ears
,
got
up
with
quivering
*NL*
tail
from
which
tufts
of
matted
hair
hung
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
loose
them
or
not
?
''
Nicholas
asked
himself
as
the
wolf
*NL*
approached
him
coming
from
the
copse
.
Suddenly
the
wolf
's
whole
*NL*
physiognomy
changed
:
she
shuddered
,
seeing
what
she
had
probably
never
*NL*
seen
before
--
human
eyes
fixed
upon
her
--
and
turning
her
head
a
little
*NL*
toward
Rostov
,
she
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
or
forward
?
Eh
,
no
matter
,
forward
...
''
the
wolf
seemed
to
say
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
she
moved
forward
without
again
looking
round
and
with
a
*NL*
quiet
,
long
,
easy
yet
resolute
lope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ulyulyu
!
''
cried
Nicholas
,
in
a
voice
not
his
own
,
and
of
its
own
accord
*NL*
his
good
horse
darted
headlong
downhill
,
leaping
over
gullies
to
head
*NL*
off
the
wolf
,
and
the
borzois
passed
it
,
running
faster
still
.
Nicholas
*NL*
did
not
hear
his
own
cry
nor
feel
that
he
was
galloping
,
nor
see
the
*NL*
borzois
,
nor
the
ground
over
which
he
went
:
he
saw
only
the
wolf
,
who
,
*NL*
increasing
her
speed
,
bounded
on
in
the
same
direction
along
the
hollow
.
*NL*
The
first
to
come
into
view
was
Milka
,
with
her
black
markings
and
*NL*
powerful
quarters
,
gaining
upon
the
wolf
.
Nearer
and
nearer
...
now
she
*NL*
was
ahead
of
it
;
but
the
wolf
turned
its
head
to
face
her
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
putting
on
speed
as
she
usually
did
Milka
suddenly
raised
her
tail
*NL*
and
stiffened
her
forelegs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ulyulyulyulyu
!
''
shouted
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reddish
Lyubim
rushed
forward
from
behind
Milka
,
sprang
impetuously
*NL*
at
the
wolf
,
and
seized
it
by
its
hindquarters
,
but
immediately
jumped
*NL*
aside
in
terror
.
The
wolf
crouched
,
gnashed
her
teeth
,
and
again
rose
*NL*
and
bounded
forward
,
followed
at
the
distance
of
a
couple
of
feet
by
all
*NL*
the
borzois
,
who
did
not
get
any
closer
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
get
away
!
No
,
it
's
impossible
!
''
thought
Nicholas
,
still
shouting
*NL*
with
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Karay
,
ulyulyu
!
...
''
he
shouted
,
looking
round
for
the
old
borzoi
who
*NL*
was
now
his
only
hope
.
Karay
,
with
all
the
strength
age
had
left
him
,
*NL*
stretched
himself
to
the
utmost
and
,
watching
the
wolf
,
galloped
heavily
*NL*
aside
to
intercept
it
.
But
the
quickness
of
the
wolf
's
lope
and
the
*NL*
borzoi
's
slower
pace
made
it
plain
that
Karay
had
miscalculated
.
*NL*
Nicholas
could
already
see
not
far
in
front
of
him
the
wood
where
the
*NL*
wolf
would
certainly
escape
should
she
reach
it
.
But
,
coming
toward
him
,
*NL*
he
saw
hounds
and
a
huntsman
galloping
almost
straight
at
the
wolf
.
*NL*
There
was
still
hope
.
A
long
,
yellowish
young
borzoi
,
one
Nicholas
did
*NL*
not
know
,
from
another
leash
,
rushed
impetuously
at
the
wolf
from
in
*NL*
front
and
almost
knocked
her
over
.
But
the
wolf
jumped
up
more
quickly
*NL*
than
anyone
could
have
expected
and
,
gnashing
her
teeth
,
flew
at
the
*NL*
yellowish
borzoi
,
which
,
with
a
piercing
yelp
,
fell
with
its
head
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
bleeding
from
a
gash
in
its
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Karay
?
Old
fellow
!
...
''
wailed
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
delay
caused
by
this
crossing
of
the
wolf
's
path
,
the
old
*NL*
dog
with
its
felted
hair
hanging
from
its
thigh
was
within
five
paces
of
*NL*
it
.
As
if
aware
of
her
danger
,
the
wolf
turned
her
eyes
on
Karay
,
tucked
*NL*
her
tail
yet
further
between
her
legs
,
and
increased
her
speed
.
But
here
*NL*
Nicholas
only
saw
that
something
happened
to
Karay
--
the
borzoi
was
*NL*
suddenly
on
the
wolf
,
and
they
rolled
together
down
into
a
gully
just
in
*NL*
front
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
instant
,
when
Nicholas
saw
the
wolf
struggling
in
the
gully
with
*NL*
the
dogs
,
while
from
under
them
could
be
seen
her
gray
hair
and
*NL*
outstretched
hind
leg
and
her
frightened
choking
head
,
with
her
ears
*NL*
laid
back
-LRB-
Karay
was
pinning
her
by
the
throat
-RRB-
,
was
the
happiest
moment
*NL*
of
his
life
.
With
his
hand
on
his
saddlebow
,
he
was
ready
to
dismount
*NL*
and
stab
the
wolf
,
when
she
suddenly
thrust
her
head
up
from
among
that
*NL*
mass
of
dogs
,
and
then
her
forepaws
were
on
the
edge
of
the
gully
.
She
*NL*
clicked
her
teeth
-LRB-
Karay
no
longer
had
her
by
the
throat
-RRB-
,
leaped
with
a
*NL*
movement
of
her
hind
legs
out
of
the
gully
,
and
having
disengaged
*NL*
herself
from
the
dogs
,
with
tail
tucked
in
again
,
went
forward
.
Karay
,
*NL*
his
hair
bristling
,
and
probably
bruised
or
wounded
,
climbed
with
*NL*
difficulty
out
of
the
gully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
my
God
!
Why
?
''
Nicholas
cried
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
's
''
huntsman
was
galloping
from
the
other
side
across
the
wolf
's
*NL*
path
and
his
borzois
once
more
stopped
the
animal
's
advance
.
She
was
*NL*
again
hemmed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
and
his
attendant
,
with
``
Uncle
''
and
his
huntsman
,
were
all
*NL*
riding
round
the
wolf
,
crying
``
ulyulyu
!
''
shouting
and
preparing
to
*NL*
dismount
each
moment
that
the
wolf
crouched
back
,
and
starting
forward
*NL*
again
every
time
she
shook
herself
and
moved
toward
the
wood
where
she
*NL*
would
be
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
,
at
the
beginning
of
this
chase
,
Daniel
,
hearing
the
ulyulyuing
,
*NL*
had
rushed
out
from
the
wood
.
He
saw
Karay
seize
the
wolf
,
and
checked
*NL*
his
horse
,
supposing
the
affair
to
be
over
.
But
when
he
saw
that
the
*NL*
horsemen
did
not
dismount
and
that
the
wolf
shook
herself
and
ran
for
*NL*
safety
,
Daniel
set
his
chestnut
galloping
,
not
at
the
wolf
but
straight
*NL*
toward
the
wood
,
just
as
Karay
had
run
to
cut
the
animal
off
.
As
a
*NL*
result
of
this
,
he
galloped
up
to
the
wolf
just
when
she
had
been
*NL*
stopped
a
second
time
by
``
Uncle
's
''
borzois
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daniel
galloped
up
silently
,
holding
a
naked
dagger
in
his
left
hand
and
*NL*
thrashing
the
laboring
sides
of
his
chestnut
horse
with
his
whip
as
if
*NL*
it
were
a
flail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
neither
saw
nor
heard
Daniel
until
the
chestnut
,
breathing
*NL*
heavily
,
panted
past
him
,
and
he
heard
the
fall
of
a
body
and
saw
Daniel
*NL*
lying
on
the
wolf
's
back
among
the
dogs
,
trying
to
seize
her
by
the
*NL*
ears
.
It
was
evident
to
the
dogs
,
the
hunters
,
and
to
the
wolf
herself
*NL*
that
all
was
now
over
.
The
terrified
wolf
pressed
back
her
ears
and
*NL*
tried
to
rise
,
but
the
borzois
stuck
to
her
.
Daniel
rose
a
little
,
took
*NL*
a
step
,
and
with
his
whole
weight
,
as
if
lying
down
to
rest
,
fell
on
the
*NL*
wolf
,
seizing
her
by
the
ears
.
Nicholas
was
about
to
stab
her
,
but
*NL*
Daniel
whispered
,
``
Do
n't
!
We
'll
gag
her
!
''
and
,
changing
his
position
,
*NL*
set
his
foot
on
the
wolf
's
neck
.
A
stick
was
thrust
between
her
jaws
and
*NL*
she
was
fastened
with
a
leash
,
as
if
bridled
,
her
legs
were
bound
*NL*
together
,
and
Daniel
rolled
her
over
once
or
twice
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
happy
,
exhausted
faces
,
they
laid
the
old
wolf
,
alive
,
on
a
shying
*NL*
and
snorting
horse
and
,
accompanied
by
the
dogs
yelping
at
her
,
took
her
*NL*
to
the
place
where
they
were
all
to
meet
.
The
hounds
had
killed
two
of
*NL*
the
cubs
and
the
borzois
three
.
The
huntsmen
assembled
with
their
booty
*NL*
and
their
stories
,
and
all
came
to
look
at
the
wolf
,
which
,
with
her
*NL*
broad-browed
head
hanging
down
and
the
bitten
stick
between
her
jaws
,
*NL*
gazed
with
great
glassy
eyes
at
this
crowd
of
dogs
and
men
surrounding
*NL*
her
.
When
she
was
touched
,
she
jerked
her
bound
legs
and
looked
wildly
*NL*
yet
simply
at
everybody
.
Old
Count
Rostov
also
rode
up
and
touched
the
*NL*
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
formidable
one
!
''
said
he
.
``
A
formidable
one
,
eh
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
Daniel
,
who
was
standing
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
''
answered
Daniel
,
quickly
doffing
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
remembered
the
wolf
he
had
let
slip
and
his
encounter
with
*NL*
Daniel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
are
a
crusty
fellow
,
friend
!
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
sole
reply
Daniel
gave
him
a
shy
,
childlike
,
meek
,
and
amiable
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
went
home
,
and
Natasha
and
Petya
promised
to
return
very
*NL*
soon
,
but
as
it
was
still
early
the
hunt
went
farther
.
At
midday
they
*NL*
put
the
hounds
into
a
ravine
thickly
overgrown
with
young
trees
.
*NL*
Nicholas
standing
in
a
fallow
field
could
see
all
his
whips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Facing
him
lay
a
field
of
winter
rye
,
there
his
own
huntsman
stood
alone
*NL*
in
a
hollow
behind
a
hazel
bush
.
The
hounds
had
scarcely
been
loosed
*NL*
before
Nicholas
heard
one
he
knew
,
Voltorn
,
giving
tongue
at
intervals
;
*NL*
other
hounds
joined
in
,
now
pausing
and
now
again
giving
tongue
.
A
*NL*
moment
later
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
wooded
ravine
that
a
fox
had
been
*NL*
found
,
and
the
whole
pack
,
joining
together
,
rushed
along
the
ravine
*NL*
toward
the
ryefield
and
away
from
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
whips
in
their
red
caps
galloping
along
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
ravine
,
he
even
saw
the
hounds
,
and
was
expecting
a
fox
to
show
itself
*NL*
at
any
moment
on
the
ryefield
opposite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huntsman
standing
in
the
hollow
moved
and
loosed
his
borzois
,
and
*NL*
Nicholas
saw
a
queer
,
short-legged
red
fox
with
a
fine
brush
going
hard
*NL*
across
the
field
.
The
borzois
bore
down
on
it
...
Now
they
drew
close
to
*NL*
the
fox
which
began
to
dodge
between
the
field
in
sharper
and
sharper
*NL*
curves
,
trailing
its
brush
,
when
suddenly
a
strange
white
borzoi
dashed
*NL*
in
followed
by
a
black
one
,
and
everything
was
in
confusion
;
the
borzois
*NL*
formed
a
star-shaped
figure
,
scarcely
swaying
their
bodies
and
with
*NL*
tails
turned
away
from
the
center
of
the
group
.
Two
huntsmen
galloped
up
*NL*
to
the
dogs
;
one
in
a
red
cap
,
the
other
,
a
stranger
,
in
a
green
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
thought
Nicholas
.
``
Where
's
that
huntsman
from
?
He
is
not
*NL*
`
Uncle
's
'
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
huntsmen
got
the
fox
,
but
stayed
there
a
long
time
without
strapping
*NL*
it
to
the
saddle
.
Their
horses
,
bridled
and
with
high
saddles
,
stood
*NL*
near
them
and
there
too
the
dogs
were
lying
.
The
huntsmen
waved
their
*NL*
arms
and
did
something
to
the
fox
.
Then
from
that
spot
came
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
horn
,
with
the
signal
agreed
on
in
case
of
a
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Ilagin
's
huntsman
having
a
row
with
our
Ivan
,
''
said
Nicholas
'
*NL*
groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
sent
the
man
to
call
Natasha
and
Petya
to
him
,
and
rode
at
a
*NL*
footpace
to
the
place
where
the
whips
were
getting
the
hounds
together
.
*NL*
Several
of
the
field
galloped
to
the
spot
where
the
fight
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
dismounted
,
and
with
Natasha
and
Petya
,
who
had
ridden
up
,
*NL*
stopped
near
the
hounds
,
waiting
to
see
how
the
matter
would
end
.
Out
of
*NL*
the
bushes
came
the
huntsman
who
had
been
fighting
and
rode
toward
his
*NL*
young
master
,
with
the
fox
tied
to
his
crupper
.
While
still
at
a
*NL*
distance
he
took
off
his
cap
and
tried
to
speak
respectfully
,
but
he
was
*NL*
pale
and
breathless
and
his
face
was
angry
.
One
of
his
eyes
was
black
,
*NL*
but
he
probably
was
not
even
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
likely
thing
,
killing
a
fox
our
dogs
had
hunted
!
And
it
was
my
gray
*NL*
bitch
that
caught
it
!
Go
to
law
,
indeed
!
...
He
snatches
at
the
fox
!
I
*NL*
gave
him
one
with
the
fox
.
Here
it
is
on
my
saddle
!
Do
you
want
a
taste
*NL*
of
this
?
...
''
said
the
huntsman
,
pointing
to
his
dagger
and
probably
*NL*
imagining
himself
still
speaking
to
his
foe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
not
stopping
to
talk
to
the
man
,
asked
his
sister
and
Petya
to
*NL*
wait
for
him
and
rode
to
the
spot
where
the
enemy
's
,
Ilagin
's
,
hunting
*NL*
party
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victorious
huntsman
rode
off
to
join
the
field
,
and
there
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
inquiring
sympathizers
,
recounted
his
exploits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facts
were
that
Ilagin
,
with
whom
the
Rostovs
had
a
quarrel
and
were
*NL*
at
law
,
hunted
over
places
that
belonged
by
custom
to
the
Rostovs
,
and
*NL*
had
now
,
as
if
purposely
,
sent
his
men
to
the
very
woods
the
Rostovs
*NL*
were
hunting
and
let
his
man
snatch
a
fox
their
dogs
had
chased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
though
he
had
never
seen
Ilagin
,
with
his
usual
absence
of
*NL*
moderation
in
judgment
,
hated
him
cordially
from
reports
of
his
*NL*
arbitrariness
and
violence
,
and
regarded
him
as
his
bitterest
foe
.
He
*NL*
rode
in
angry
agitation
toward
him
,
firmly
grasping
his
whip
and
fully
*NL*
prepared
to
take
the
most
resolute
and
desperate
steps
to
punish
his
*NL*
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
he
passed
an
angle
of
the
wood
before
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
*NL*
beaver
cap
came
riding
toward
him
on
a
handsome
raven-black
horse
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
two
hunt
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
an
enemy
,
Nicholas
found
in
Ilagin
a
stately
and
courteous
*NL*
gentleman
who
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
the
young
count
's
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Having
ridden
up
to
Nicholas
,
Ilagin
raised
his
beaver
cap
*NL*
and
said
he
much
regretted
what
had
occurred
and
would
have
the
man
*NL*
punished
who
had
allowed
himself
to
seize
a
fox
hunted
by
someone
else
's
*NL*
borzois
.
He
hoped
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
count
and
invited
*NL*
him
to
draw
his
covert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
afraid
that
her
brother
would
do
something
dreadful
,
had
*NL*
followed
him
in
some
excitement
.
Seeing
the
enemies
exchanging
friendly
*NL*
greetings
,
she
rode
up
to
them
.
Ilagin
lifted
his
beaver
cap
still
*NL*
higher
to
Natasha
and
said
,
with
a
pleasant
smile
,
that
the
young
*NL*
countess
resembled
Diana
in
her
passion
for
the
chase
as
well
as
in
her
*NL*
beauty
,
of
which
he
had
heard
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
expiate
his
huntsman
's
offense
,
Ilagin
pressed
the
Rostovs
to
come
to
*NL*
an
upland
of
his
about
a
mile
away
which
he
usually
kept
for
himself
and
*NL*
which
,
he
said
,
swarmed
with
hares
.
Nicholas
agreed
,
and
the
hunt
,
now
*NL*
doubled
,
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
to
Iligin
's
upland
was
across
the
fields
.
The
hunt
servants
fell
*NL*
into
line
.
The
masters
rode
together
.
``
Uncle
,
''
Rostov
,
and
Ilagin
kept
*NL*
stealthily
glancing
at
one
another
's
dogs
,
trying
not
to
be
observed
by
*NL*
their
companions
and
searching
uneasily
for
rivals
to
their
own
borzois
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
was
particularly
struck
by
the
beauty
of
a
small
,
pure-bred
,
red
-
*NL*
spotted
bitch
on
Ilagin
's
leash
,
slender
but
with
muscles
like
steel
,
a
*NL*
delicate
muzzle
,
and
prominent
black
eyes
.
He
had
heard
of
the
swiftness
*NL*
of
Ilagin
's
borzois
,
and
in
that
beautiful
bitch
saw
a
rival
to
his
own
*NL*
Milka
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
a
sober
conversation
begun
by
Ilagin
about
the
year
's
*NL*
harvest
,
Nicholas
pointed
to
the
red-spotted
bitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
little
bitch
,
that
!
''
said
he
in
a
careless
tone
.
``
Is
she
swift
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
?
Yes
,
she
's
a
good
dog
,
gets
what
she
's
after
,
''
answered
*NL*
Ilagin
indifferently
,
of
the
red-spotted
bitch
Erza
,
for
which
,
a
year
*NL*
before
,
he
had
given
a
neighbor
three
families
of
house
serfs
.
``
So
in
*NL*
your
parts
,
too
,
the
harvest
is
nothing
to
boast
of
,
Count
?
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
continuing
the
conversation
they
had
begun
.
And
considering
it
polite
to
*NL*
return
the
young
count
's
compliment
,
Ilagin
looked
at
his
borzois
and
*NL*
picked
out
Milka
who
attracted
his
attention
by
her
breadth
.
``
That
*NL*
black-spotted
one
of
yours
is
fine
--
well
shaped
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
's
fast
enough
,
''
replied
Nicholas
,
and
thought
:
``
If
only
a
*NL*
full-grown
hare
would
cross
the
field
now
I
'd
show
you
what
sort
of
*NL*
borzoi
she
is
,
''
and
turning
to
his
groom
,
he
said
he
would
give
a
ruble
*NL*
to
anyone
who
found
a
hare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
continued
Ilagin
,
``
how
some
sportsmen
can
be
so
*NL*
jealous
about
game
and
dogs
.
For
myself
,
I
can
tell
you
,
Count
,
I
enjoy
*NL*
riding
in
company
such
as
this
...
what
could
be
better
?
''
-LRB-
he
again
*NL*
raised
his
cap
to
Natasha
-RRB-
``
but
as
for
counting
skins
and
what
one
*NL*
takes
,
I
do
n't
care
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
being
upset
because
someone
else
's
borzoi
and
not
mine
catches
*NL*
something
.
All
I
care
about
is
to
enjoy
seeing
the
chase
,
is
it
not
so
,
*NL*
Count
?
For
I
consider
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A-tu
!
''
came
the
long-drawn
cry
of
one
of
the
borzoi
whippers-in
,
who
*NL*
had
halted
.
He
stood
on
a
knoll
in
the
stubble
,
holding
his
whip
aloft
,
*NL*
and
again
repeated
his
long-drawn
cry
,
``
A-tu
!
''
-LRB-
This
call
and
the
*NL*
uplifted
whip
meant
that
he
saw
a
sitting
hare
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
has
found
one
,
I
think
,
''
said
Ilagin
carelessly
.
``
Yes
,
we
must
*NL*
ride
up
...
Shall
we
both
course
it
?
''
answered
Nicholas
,
seeing
in
Erza
*NL*
and
``
Uncle
's
''
red
Rugay
two
rivals
he
had
never
yet
had
a
chance
of
*NL*
pitting
against
his
own
borzois
.
``
And
suppose
they
outdo
my
Milka
at
*NL*
once
!
''
he
thought
as
he
rode
with
``
Uncle
''
and
Ilagin
toward
the
hare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
full-grown
one
?
''
asked
Ilagin
as
he
approached
the
whip
who
had
*NL*
sighted
the
hare
--
and
not
without
agitation
he
looked
round
and
whistled
*NL*
to
Erza
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Michael
Nikanorovich
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
``
Uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
riding
with
a
sullen
expression
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
join
in
?
Why
,
you
've
given
a
village
for
each
of
your
*NL*
borzois
!
That
's
it
,
come
on
!
Yours
are
worth
thousands
.
Try
yours
*NL*
against
one
another
,
you
two
,
and
I
'll
look
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rugay
,
hey
,
hey
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Rugayushka
!
''
he
added
,
involuntarily
by
*NL*
this
diminutive
expressing
his
affection
and
the
hopes
he
placed
on
this
*NL*
red
borzoi
.
Natasha
saw
and
felt
the
agitation
the
two
elderly
men
and
*NL*
her
brother
were
trying
to
conceal
,
and
was
herself
excited
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huntsman
stood
halfway
up
the
knoll
holding
up
his
whip
and
the
*NL*
gentlefolk
rode
up
to
him
at
a
footpace
;
the
hounds
that
were
far
off
on
*NL*
the
horizon
turned
away
from
the
hare
,
and
the
whips
,
but
not
the
*NL*
gentlefolk
,
also
moved
away
.
All
were
moving
slowly
and
sedately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
pointing
?
''
asked
Nicholas
,
riding
a
hundred
paces
toward
the
*NL*
whip
who
had
sighted
the
hare
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
the
whip
could
reply
,
the
hare
,
scenting
the
frost
coming
*NL*
next
morning
,
was
unable
to
rest
and
leaped
up
.
The
pack
on
leash
rushed
*NL*
downhill
in
full
cry
after
the
hare
,
and
from
all
sides
the
borzois
that
*NL*
were
not
on
leash
darted
after
the
hounds
and
the
hare
.
All
the
hunt
,
*NL*
who
had
been
moving
slowly
,
shouted
,
``
Stop
!
''
calling
in
the
hounds
,
*NL*
while
the
borzoi
whips
,
with
a
cry
of
``
A-tu
!
''
galloped
across
the
field
*NL*
setting
the
borzois
on
the
hare
.
The
tranquil
Ilagin
,
Nicholas
,
Natasha
,
*NL*
and
``
Uncle
''
flew
,
reckless
of
where
and
how
they
went
,
seeing
only
the
*NL*
borzois
and
the
hare
and
fearing
only
to
lose
sight
even
for
an
instant
*NL*
of
the
chase
.
The
hare
they
had
started
was
a
strong
and
swift
one
.
When
*NL*
he
jumped
up
he
did
not
run
at
once
,
but
pricked
his
ears
listening
to
*NL*
the
shouting
and
trampling
that
resounded
from
all
sides
at
once
.
He
*NL*
took
a
dozen
bounds
,
not
very
quickly
,
letting
the
borzois
gain
on
him
,
*NL*
and
,
finally
having
chosen
his
direction
and
realized
his
danger
,
laid
*NL*
back
his
ears
and
rushed
off
headlong
.
He
had
been
lying
in
the
stubble
,
*NL*
but
in
front
of
him
was
the
autumn
sowing
where
the
ground
was
soft
.
The
*NL*
two
borzois
of
the
huntsman
who
had
sighted
him
,
having
been
the
*NL*
nearest
,
were
the
first
to
see
and
pursue
him
,
but
they
had
not
gone
far
*NL*
before
Ilagin
's
red-spotted
Erza
passed
them
,
got
within
a
length
,
flew
*NL*
at
the
hare
with
terrible
swiftness
aiming
at
his
scut
,
and
,
thinking
*NL*
she
had
seized
him
,
rolled
over
like
a
ball
.
The
hare
arched
his
back
*NL*
and
bounded
off
yet
more
swiftly
.
From
behind
Erza
rushed
the
broad
-
*NL*
haunched
,
black-spotted
Milka
and
began
rapidly
gaining
on
the
hare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Milashka
,
dear
!
''
rose
Nicholas
'
triumphant
cry
.
It
looked
as
if
Milka
*NL*
would
immediately
pounce
on
the
hare
,
but
she
overtook
him
and
flew
*NL*
past
.
The
hare
had
squatted
.
Again
the
beautiful
Erza
reached
him
,
but
*NL*
when
close
to
the
hare
's
scut
paused
as
if
measuring
the
distance
,
so
as
*NL*
not
to
make
a
mistake
this
time
but
seize
his
hind
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Erza
,
darling
!
''
Ilagin
wailed
in
a
voice
unlike
his
own
.
Erza
did
not
*NL*
hearken
to
his
appeal
.
At
the
very
moment
when
she
would
have
seized
her
*NL*
prey
,
the
hare
moved
and
darted
along
the
balk
between
the
winter
rye
*NL*
and
the
stubble
.
Again
Erza
and
Milka
were
abreast
,
running
like
a
pair
*NL*
of
carriage
horses
,
and
began
to
overtake
the
hare
,
but
it
was
easier
*NL*
for
the
hare
to
run
on
the
balk
and
the
borzois
did
not
overtake
him
so
*NL*
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rugay
,
Rugayushka
!
That
's
it
,
come
on
!
''
came
a
third
voice
just
then
,
*NL*
and
``
Uncle
's
''
red
borzoi
,
straining
and
curving
its
back
,
caught
up
with
*NL*
the
two
foremost
borzois
,
pushed
ahead
of
them
regardless
of
the
*NL*
terrible
strain
,
put
on
speed
close
to
the
hare
,
knocked
it
off
the
balk
*NL*
onto
the
ryefield
,
again
put
on
speed
still
more
viciously
,
sinking
to
*NL*
his
knees
in
the
muddy
field
,
and
all
one
could
see
was
how
,
muddying
*NL*
his
back
,
he
rolled
over
with
the
hare
.
A
ring
of
borzois
surrounded
*NL*
him
.
A
moment
later
everyone
had
drawn
up
round
the
crowd
of
dogs
.
Only
*NL*
the
delighted
``
Uncle
''
dismounted
,
and
cut
off
a
pad
,
shaking
the
hare
*NL*
for
the
blood
to
drip
off
,
and
anxiously
glancing
round
with
restless
*NL*
eyes
while
his
arms
and
legs
twitched
.
He
spoke
without
himself
knowing
*NL*
whom
to
or
what
about
.
``
That
's
it
,
come
on
!
That
's
a
dog
!
...
There
,
it
*NL*
has
beaten
them
all
,
the
thousand-ruble
as
well
as
the
one-ruble
*NL*
borzois
.
That
's
it
,
come
on
!
''
said
he
,
panting
and
looking
wrathfully
*NL*
around
as
if
he
were
abusing
someone
,
as
if
they
were
all
his
enemies
*NL*
and
had
insulted
him
,
and
only
now
had
he
at
last
succeeded
in
*NL*
justifying
himself
.
``
There
are
your
thousand-ruble
ones
...
That
's
it
,
*NL*
come
on
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rugay
,
here
's
a
pad
for
you
!
''
he
said
,
throwing
down
the
hare
's
muddy
*NL*
pad
.
``
You
've
deserved
it
,
that
's
it
,
come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
tired
herself
out
,
she
'd
run
it
down
three
times
by
herself
,
''
*NL*
said
Nicholas
,
also
not
listening
to
anyone
and
regardless
of
whether
he
*NL*
were
heard
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
there
in
running
across
it
like
that
?
''
said
Ilagin
's
groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
she
had
missed
it
and
turned
it
away
,
any
mongrel
could
take
it
,
''
*NL*
Ilagin
was
saying
at
the
same
time
,
breathless
from
his
gallop
and
his
*NL*
excitement
.
At
the
same
moment
Natasha
,
without
drawing
breath
,
screamed
*NL*
joyously
,
ecstatically
,
and
so
piercingly
that
it
set
everyone
's
ear
*NL*
tingling
.
By
that
shriek
she
expressed
what
the
others
expressed
by
all
*NL*
talking
at
once
,
and
it
was
so
strange
that
she
must
herself
have
been
*NL*
ashamed
of
so
wild
a
cry
and
everyone
else
would
have
been
amazed
at
it
*NL*
at
any
other
time
.
``
Uncle
''
himself
twisted
up
the
hare
,
threw
it
neatly
*NL*
and
smartly
across
his
horse
's
back
as
if
by
that
gesture
he
meant
to
*NL*
rebuke
everybody
,
and
,
with
an
air
of
not
wishing
to
speak
to
anyone
,
*NL*
mounted
his
bay
and
rode
off
.
The
others
all
followed
,
dispirited
and
*NL*
shamefaced
,
and
only
much
later
were
they
able
to
regain
their
former
*NL*
affectation
of
indifference
.
For
a
long
time
they
continued
to
look
at
*NL*
red
Rugay
who
,
his
arched
back
spattered
with
mud
and
clanking
the
ring
*NL*
of
his
leash
,
walked
along
just
behind
``
Uncle
's
''
horse
with
the
serene
*NL*
air
of
a
conqueror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
like
any
other
dog
as
long
as
it
's
not
a
question
of
*NL*
coursing
.
But
when
it
is
,
then
look
out
!
''
his
appearance
seemed
to
*NL*
Nicholas
to
be
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
much
later
,
``
Uncle
''
rode
up
to
Nicholas
and
began
talking
to
him
,
*NL*
he
felt
flattered
that
,
after
what
had
happened
,
``
Uncle
''
deigned
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
evening
Ilagin
took
leave
of
Nicholas
,
who
found
that
they
were
*NL*
so
far
from
home
that
he
accepted
``
Uncle
's
''
offer
that
the
hunting
party
*NL*
should
spend
the
night
in
his
little
village
of
Mikhaylovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
put
up
at
my
house
that
will
be
better
still
.
That
's
it
,
*NL*
come
on
!
''
said
``
Uncle
.
''
``
You
see
it
's
damp
weather
,
and
you
could
rest
,
*NL*
and
the
little
countess
could
be
driven
home
in
a
trap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
's
''
offer
was
accepted
.
A
huntsman
was
sent
to
Otradnoe
for
a
*NL*
trap
,
while
Nicholas
rode
with
Natasha
and
Petya
to
``
Uncle
's
''
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
five
male
domestic
serfs
,
big
and
little
,
rushed
out
to
the
front
*NL*
porch
to
meet
their
master
.
A
score
of
women
serfs
,
old
and
young
,
as
*NL*
well
as
children
,
popped
out
from
the
back
entrance
to
have
a
look
at
*NL*
the
hunters
who
were
arriving
.
The
presence
of
Natasha
--
a
woman
,
a
lady
,
*NL*
and
on
horseback
--
raised
the
curiosity
of
the
serfs
to
such
a
degree
*NL*
that
many
of
them
came
up
to
her
,
stared
her
in
the
face
,
and
unabashed
*NL*
by
her
presence
made
remarks
about
her
as
though
she
were
some
prodigy
*NL*
on
show
and
not
a
human
being
able
to
hear
or
understand
what
was
said
*NL*
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arinka
!
Look
,
she
sits
sideways
!
There
she
sits
and
her
skirt
*NL*
dangles
...
See
,
she
's
got
a
little
hunting
horn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
gracious
!
See
her
knife
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
she
a
Tartar
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
you
did
n't
go
head
over
heels
?
''
asked
the
boldest
of
all
,
*NL*
addressing
Natasha
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
dismounted
at
the
porch
of
his
little
wooden
house
which
stood
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
an
overgrown
garden
and
,
after
a
glance
at
his
*NL*
retainers
,
shouted
authoritatively
that
the
superfluous
ones
should
take
*NL*
themselves
off
and
that
all
necessary
preparations
should
be
made
to
*NL*
receive
the
guests
and
the
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serfs
all
dispersed
.
``
Uncle
''
lifted
Natasha
off
her
horse
and
taking
*NL*
her
hand
led
her
up
the
rickety
wooden
steps
of
the
porch
.
The
house
,
*NL*
with
its
bare
,
unplastered
log
walls
,
was
not
overclean
--
it
did
not
seem
*NL*
that
those
living
in
it
aimed
at
keeping
it
spotless
--
but
neither
was
it
*NL*
noticeably
neglected
.
In
the
entry
there
was
a
smell
of
fresh
apples
,
*NL*
and
wolf
and
fox
skins
hung
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
led
the
visitors
through
the
anteroom
into
a
small
hall
with
a
*NL*
folding
table
and
red
chairs
,
then
into
the
drawing
room
with
a
round
*NL*
birchwood
table
and
a
sofa
,
and
finally
into
his
private
room
where
*NL*
there
was
a
tattered
sofa
,
a
worn
carpet
,
and
portraits
of
Suvorov
,
of
*NL*
the
host
's
father
and
mother
,
and
of
himself
in
military
uniform
.
The
*NL*
study
smelt
strongly
of
tobacco
and
dogs
.
``
Uncle
''
asked
his
visitors
to
*NL*
sit
down
and
make
themselves
at
home
,
and
then
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
Rugay
,
his
back
still
muddy
,
came
into
the
room
and
lay
down
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
cleaning
himself
with
his
tongue
and
teeth
.
Leading
from
the
study
*NL*
was
a
passage
in
which
a
partition
with
ragged
curtains
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
From
behind
this
came
women
's
laughter
and
whispers
.
Natasha
,
Nicholas
,
*NL*
and
Petya
took
off
their
wraps
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
.
Petya
,
leaning
*NL*
on
his
elbow
,
fell
asleep
at
once
.
Natasha
and
Nicholas
were
silent
.
*NL*
Their
faces
glowed
,
they
were
hungry
and
very
cheerful
.
They
looked
at
*NL*
one
another
-LRB-
now
that
the
hunt
was
over
and
they
were
in
the
house
,
*NL*
Nicholas
no
longer
considered
it
necessary
to
show
his
manly
superiority
*NL*
over
his
sister
-RRB-
,
Natasha
gave
him
a
wink
,
and
neither
refrained
long
*NL*
from
bursting
into
a
peal
of
ringing
laughter
even
before
they
had
a
*NL*
pretext
ready
to
account
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
``
Uncle
''
came
in
,
in
a
Cossack
coat
,
blue
trousers
,
and
*NL*
small
top
boots
.
And
Natasha
felt
that
this
costume
,
the
very
one
she
*NL*
had
regarded
with
surprise
and
amusement
at
Otradnoe
,
was
just
the
right
*NL*
thing
and
not
at
all
worse
than
a
swallow-tail
or
frock
coat
.
``
Uncle
''
*NL*
too
was
in
high
spirits
and
far
from
being
offended
by
the
brother
's
and
*NL*
sister
's
laughter
-LRB-
it
could
never
enter
his
head
that
they
might
be
*NL*
laughing
at
his
way
of
life
-RRB-
he
himself
joined
in
the
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
young
countess
,
that
's
it
,
come
on
!
I
never
saw
anyone
*NL*
like
her
!
''
said
he
,
offering
Nicholas
a
pipe
with
a
long
stem
and
,
with
*NL*
a
practiced
motion
of
three
fingers
,
taking
down
another
that
had
been
*NL*
cut
short
.
``
She
's
ridden
all
day
like
a
man
,
and
is
as
fresh
as
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
``
Uncle
's
''
reappearance
the
door
was
opened
,
evidently
from
*NL*
the
sound
by
a
barefooted
girl
,
and
a
stout
,
rosy
,
good-looking
woman
of
*NL*
about
forty
,
with
a
double
chin
and
full
red
lips
,
entered
carrying
a
*NL*
large
loaded
tray
.
With
hospitable
dignity
and
cordiality
in
her
glance
*NL*
and
in
every
motion
,
she
looked
at
the
visitors
and
,
with
a
pleasant
*NL*
smile
,
bowed
respectfully
.
In
spite
of
her
exceptional
stoutness
,
which
*NL*
caused
her
to
protrude
her
chest
and
stomach
and
throw
back
her
head
,
*NL*
this
woman
-LRB-
who
was
``
Uncle
's
''
housekeeper
-RRB-
trod
very
lightly
.
She
went
*NL*
to
the
table
,
set
down
the
tray
,
and
with
her
plump
white
hands
deftly
*NL*
took
from
it
the
bottles
and
various
hors
d'oeuvres
and
dishes
and
*NL*
arranged
them
on
the
table
.
When
she
had
finished
,
she
stepped
aside
and
*NL*
stopped
at
the
door
with
a
smile
on
her
face
.
``
Here
I
am
.
I
am
she
!
Now
*NL*
do
you
understand
`
Uncle
'
?
''
her
expression
said
to
Rostov
.
How
could
one
*NL*
help
understanding
?
Not
only
Nicholas
,
but
even
Natasha
understood
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
puckered
brow
and
the
happy
complacent
smile
that
*NL*
slightly
puckered
his
lips
when
Anisya
Fedorovna
entered
.
On
the
tray
*NL*
was
a
bottle
of
herb
wine
,
different
kinds
of
vodka
,
pickled
mushrooms
,
*NL*
rye
cakes
made
with
buttermilk
,
honey
in
the
comb
,
still
mead
and
*NL*
sparkling
mead
,
apples
,
nuts
-LRB-
raw
and
roasted
-RRB-
,
and
nut-and-honey
*NL*
sweets
.
Afterwards
she
brought
a
freshly
roasted
chicken
,
ham
,
preserves
*NL*
made
with
honey
,
and
preserves
made
with
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
the
fruit
of
Anisya
Fedorovna
's
housekeeping
,
gathered
and
*NL*
prepared
by
her
.
The
smell
and
taste
of
it
all
had
a
smack
of
Anisya
*NL*
Fedorovna
herself
:
a
savor
of
juiciness
,
cleanliness
,
whiteness
,
and
*NL*
pleasant
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
,
little
Lady-Countess
!
''
she
kept
saying
,
as
she
offered
*NL*
Natasha
first
one
thing
and
then
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
ate
of
everything
and
thought
she
had
never
seen
or
eaten
such
*NL*
buttermilk
cakes
,
such
aromatic
jam
,
such
honey-and-nut
sweets
,
or
such
*NL*
a
chicken
anywhere
.
Anisya
Fedorovna
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
,
over
their
cherry
brandy
,
Rostov
and
``
Uncle
''
talked
of
*NL*
past
and
future
hunts
,
of
Rugay
and
Ilagin
's
dogs
,
while
Natasha
sat
*NL*
upright
on
the
sofa
and
listened
with
sparkling
eyes
.
She
tried
several
*NL*
times
to
wake
Petya
that
he
might
eat
something
,
but
he
only
muttered
*NL*
incoherent
words
without
waking
up
.
Natasha
felt
so
lighthearted
and
*NL*
happy
in
these
novel
surroundings
that
she
only
feared
the
trap
would
*NL*
come
for
her
too
soon
.
After
a
casual
pause
,
such
as
often
occurs
when
*NL*
receiving
friends
for
the
first
time
in
one
's
own
house
,
``
Uncle
,
''
*NL*
answering
a
thought
that
was
in
his
visitors
'
minds
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
you
see
,
is
how
I
am
finishing
my
days
...
Death
will
come
.
That
's
*NL*
it
,
come
on
!
Nothing
will
remain
.
Then
why
harm
anyone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
's
''
face
was
very
significant
and
even
handsome
as
he
said
this
.
*NL*
Involuntarily
Rostov
recalled
all
the
good
he
had
heard
about
him
from
*NL*
his
father
and
the
neighbors
.
Throughout
the
whole
province
``
Uncle
''
had
*NL*
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
honorable
and
disinterested
of
cranks
.
*NL*
They
called
him
in
to
decide
family
disputes
,
chose
him
as
executor
,
*NL*
confided
secrets
to
him
,
elected
him
to
be
a
justice
and
to
other
posts
;
*NL*
but
he
always
persistently
refused
public
appointments
,
passing
the
*NL*
autumn
and
spring
in
the
fields
on
his
bay
gelding
,
sitting
at
home
in
*NL*
winter
,
and
lying
in
his
overgrown
garden
in
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
enter
the
service
,
Uncle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
once
,
but
gave
it
up
.
I
am
not
fit
for
it
.
That
's
it
,
come
on
!
I
*NL*
ca
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
it
.
That
's
for
you
--
I
have
n't
brains
enough
.
*NL*
Now
,
hunting
is
another
matter
--
that
's
it
,
come
on
!
Open
the
door
,
*NL*
there
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Why
have
you
shut
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
led
to
the
huntsmen
's
room
,
as
they
*NL*
called
the
room
for
the
hunt
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rapid
patter
of
bare
feet
,
and
an
unseen
hand
opened
the
*NL*
door
into
the
huntsmen
's
room
,
from
which
came
the
clear
sounds
of
a
*NL*
balalayka
on
which
someone
,
who
was
evidently
a
master
of
the
art
,
was
*NL*
playing
.
Natasha
had
been
listening
to
those
strains
for
some
time
and
*NL*
now
went
out
into
the
passage
to
hear
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Mitka
,
my
coachman
...
I
have
got
him
a
good
balalayka
.
I
'm
fond
*NL*
of
it
,
''
said
``
Uncle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
custom
for
Mitka
to
play
the
balalayka
in
the
huntsmen
's
room
*NL*
when
``
Uncle
''
returned
from
the
chase
.
``
Uncle
''
was
fond
of
such
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
!
Really
very
good
!
''
said
Nicholas
with
some
unintentional
*NL*
superciliousness
,
as
if
ashamed
to
confess
that
the
sounds
pleased
him
*NL*
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
?
''
said
Natasha
reproachfully
,
noticing
her
brother
's
tone
.
*NL*
``
Not
`
very
good
'
it
's
simply
delicious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
``
Uncle
's
''
pickled
mushrooms
,
honey
,
and
cherry
brandy
had
seemed
*NL*
to
her
the
best
in
the
world
,
so
also
that
song
,
at
that
moment
,
seemed
*NL*
to
her
the
acme
of
musical
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
,
please
,
more
!
''
cried
Natasha
at
the
door
as
soon
as
the
balalayka
*NL*
ceased
.
Mitka
tuned
up
afresh
,
and
recommenced
thrumming
the
balalayka
*NL*
to
the
air
of
My
Lady
,
with
trills
and
variations
.
``
Uncle
''
sat
*NL*
listening
,
slightly
smiling
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
.
The
air
was
*NL*
repeated
a
hundred
times
.
The
balalayka
was
retuned
several
times
and
*NL*
the
same
notes
were
thrummed
again
,
but
the
listeners
did
not
grow
weary
*NL*
of
it
and
wished
to
hear
it
again
and
again
.
Anisya
Fedorovna
came
in
*NL*
and
leaned
her
portly
person
against
the
doorpost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
listening
?
''
she
said
to
Natasha
,
with
a
smile
extremely
like
*NL*
``
Uncle
's
.
''
``
That
's
a
good
player
of
ours
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
play
that
part
right
!
''
said
``
Uncle
''
suddenly
,
with
an
*NL*
energetic
gesture
.
``
Here
he
ought
to
burst
out
--
that
's
it
,
come
on
!
--
*NL*
ought
to
burst
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
play
then
?
''
asked
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
did
not
answer
,
but
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anisya
,
go
and
see
if
the
strings
of
my
guitar
are
all
right
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
touched
it
for
a
long
time
.
That
's
it
--
come
on
!
I
've
given
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anisya
Fedorovna
,
with
her
light
step
,
willingly
went
to
fulfill
her
*NL*
errand
and
brought
back
the
guitar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
looking
at
anyone
,
``
Uncle
''
blew
the
dust
off
it
and
,
tapping
the
*NL*
case
with
his
bony
fingers
,
tuned
the
guitar
and
settled
himself
in
his
*NL*
armchair
.
He
took
the
guitar
a
little
above
the
fingerboard
,
arching
his
*NL*
left
elbow
with
a
somewhat
theatrical
gesture
,
and
,
with
a
wink
at
*NL*
Anisya
Fedorovna
,
struck
a
single
chord
,
pure
and
sonorous
,
and
then
*NL*
quietly
,
smoothly
,
and
confidently
began
playing
in
very
slow
time
,
not
*NL*
My
Lady
,
but
the
well-known
song
:
Came
a
maiden
down
the
street
.
The
*NL*
tune
,
played
with
precision
and
in
exact
time
,
began
to
thrill
in
the
*NL*
hearts
of
Nicholas
and
Natasha
,
arousing
in
them
the
same
kind
of
sober
*NL*
mirth
as
radiated
from
Anisya
Fedorovna
's
whole
being
.
Anisya
Fedorovna
*NL*
flushed
,
and
drawing
her
kerchief
over
her
face
went
laughing
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
``
Uncle
''
continued
to
play
correctly
,
carefully
,
with
energetic
*NL*
firmness
,
looking
with
a
changed
and
inspired
expression
at
the
spot
*NL*
where
Anisya
Fedorovna
had
just
stood
.
Something
seemed
to
be
laughing
a
*NL*
little
on
one
side
of
his
face
under
his
gray
mustaches
,
especially
as
*NL*
the
song
grew
brisker
and
the
time
quicker
and
when
,
here
and
there
,
as
*NL*
he
ran
his
fingers
over
the
strings
,
something
seemed
to
snap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
,
lovely
!
Go
on
,
Uncle
,
go
on
!
''
shouted
Natasha
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
finished
.
She
jumped
up
and
hugged
and
kissed
him
.
``
Nicholas
,
Nicholas
!
''
*NL*
she
said
,
turning
to
her
brother
,
as
if
asking
him
:
``
What
is
it
moves
me
*NL*
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
too
was
greatly
pleased
by
``
Uncle
's
''
playing
,
and
``
Uncle
''
*NL*
played
the
piece
over
again
.
Anisya
Fedorovna
's
smiling
face
reappeared
*NL*
in
the
doorway
and
behind
hers
other
faces
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fetching
water
clear
and
sweet
,
Stop
,
dear
maiden
,
I
entreat
--
*NL*
*NL*
played
``
Uncle
''
once
more
,
running
his
fingers
skillfully
over
the
*NL*
strings
,
and
then
he
stopped
short
and
jerked
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Uncle
dear
,
''
Natasha
wailed
in
an
imploring
tone
as
if
her
life
*NL*
depended
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
rose
,
and
it
was
as
if
there
were
two
men
in
him
:
one
of
them
*NL*
smiled
seriously
at
the
merry
fellow
,
while
the
merry
fellow
struck
a
*NL*
naive
and
precise
attitude
preparatory
to
a
folk
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
niece
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
waving
to
Natasha
the
hand
that
had
*NL*
just
struck
a
chord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
threw
off
the
shawl
from
her
shoulders
,
ran
forward
to
face
*NL*
``
Uncle
,
''
and
setting
her
arms
akimbo
also
made
a
motion
with
her
*NL*
shoulders
and
struck
an
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
,
how
,
and
when
had
this
young
countess
,
educated
by
an
emigree
*NL*
French
governess
,
imbibed
from
the
Russian
air
she
breathed
that
spirit
*NL*
and
obtained
that
manner
which
the
pas
de
chale
*
would
,
one
would
have
*NL*
supposed
,
long
ago
have
effaced
?
But
the
spirit
and
the
movements
were
*NL*
those
inimitable
and
unteachable
Russian
ones
that
``
Uncle
''
had
expected
*NL*
of
her
.
As
soon
as
she
had
struck
her
pose
,
and
smiled
triumphantly
,
*NL*
proudly
,
and
with
sly
merriment
,
the
fear
that
had
at
first
seized
*NL*
Nicholas
and
the
others
that
she
might
not
do
the
right
thing
was
at
an
*NL*
end
,
and
they
were
already
admiring
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
French
shawl
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
the
right
thing
with
such
precision
,
such
complete
precision
,
*NL*
that
Anisya
Fedorovna
,
who
had
at
once
handed
her
the
handkerchief
she
*NL*
needed
for
the
dance
,
had
tears
in
her
eyes
,
though
she
laughed
as
she
*NL*
watched
this
slim
,
graceful
countess
,
reared
in
silks
and
velvets
and
so
*NL*
different
from
herself
,
who
yet
was
able
to
understand
all
that
was
in
*NL*
Anisya
and
in
Anisya
's
father
and
mother
and
aunt
,
and
in
every
Russian
*NL*
man
and
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
little
countess
;
that
's
it
--
come
on
!
''
cried
``
Uncle
,
''
with
a
*NL*
joyous
laugh
,
having
finished
the
dance
.
``
Well
done
,
niece
!
Now
a
fine
*NL*
young
fellow
must
be
found
as
husband
for
you
.
That
's
it
--
come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
chosen
already
,
''
said
Nicholas
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
?
''
said
``
Uncle
''
in
surprise
,
looking
inquiringly
at
Natasha
,
who
*NL*
nodded
her
head
with
a
happy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
a
one
!
''
she
said
.
But
as
soon
as
she
had
said
it
a
new
train
*NL*
of
thoughts
and
feelings
arose
in
her
.
``
What
did
Nicholas
'
smile
mean
*NL*
when
he
said
`
chosen
already
'
?
Is
he
glad
of
it
or
not
?
It
is
as
if
he
*NL*
thought
my
Bolkonski
would
not
approve
of
or
understand
our
gaiety
.
But
*NL*
he
would
understand
it
all
.
Where
is
he
now
?
''
she
thought
,
and
her
face
*NL*
suddenly
became
serious
.
But
this
lasted
only
a
second
.
``
Do
n't
dare
to
*NL*
think
about
it
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
and
sat
down
again
smilingly
*NL*
beside
``
Uncle
,
''
begging
him
to
play
something
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
played
another
song
and
a
valse
;
then
after
a
pause
he
cleared
*NL*
his
throat
and
sang
his
favorite
hunting
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
't
was
growing
dark
last
night
Fell
the
snow
so
soft
and
light
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
''
sang
as
peasants
sing
,
with
full
and
naive
conviction
that
the
*NL*
whole
meaning
of
a
song
lies
in
the
words
and
that
the
tune
comes
of
*NL*
itself
,
and
that
apart
from
the
words
there
is
no
tune
,
which
exists
*NL*
only
to
give
measure
to
the
words
.
As
a
result
of
this
the
unconsidered
*NL*
tune
,
like
the
song
of
a
bird
,
was
extraordinarily
good
.
Natasha
was
in
*NL*
ecstasies
over
``
Uncle
's
''
singing
.
She
resolved
to
give
up
learning
the
*NL*
harp
and
to
play
only
the
guitar
.
She
asked
``
Uncle
''
for
his
guitar
and
*NL*
at
once
found
the
chords
of
the
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
nine
o'clock
two
traps
and
three
mounted
men
,
who
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
look
for
them
,
arrived
to
fetch
Natasha
and
Petya
.
The
count
and
*NL*
countess
did
not
know
where
they
were
and
were
very
anxious
,
said
one
of
*NL*
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
was
carried
out
like
a
log
and
laid
in
the
larger
of
the
two
*NL*
traps
.
Natasha
and
Nicholas
got
into
the
other
.
``
Uncle
''
wrapped
Natasha
*NL*
up
warmly
and
took
leave
of
her
with
quite
a
new
tenderness
.
He
*NL*
accompanied
them
on
foot
as
far
as
the
bridge
that
could
not
be
crossed
,
*NL*
so
that
they
had
to
go
round
by
the
ford
,
and
he
sent
huntsmen
to
ride
*NL*
in
front
with
lanterns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
dear
niece
,
''
his
voice
called
out
of
the
darkness
--
not
the
*NL*
voice
Natasha
had
known
previously
,
but
the
one
that
had
sung
As
't
was
*NL*
growing
dark
last
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
village
through
which
they
passed
there
were
red
lights
and
a
*NL*
cheerful
smell
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
darling
Uncle
is
!
''
said
Natasha
,
when
they
had
come
out
onto
the
*NL*
highroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Nicholas
.
``
You
're
not
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
quite
,
quite
all
right
.
I
feel
so
comfortable
!
''
answered
*NL*
Natasha
,
almost
perplexed
by
her
feelings
.
They
remained
silent
a
long
*NL*
while
.
The
night
was
dark
and
damp
.
They
could
not
see
the
horses
,
but
*NL*
only
heard
them
splashing
through
the
unseen
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
passing
in
that
receptive
childlike
soul
that
so
eagerly
caught
*NL*
and
assimilated
all
the
diverse
impressions
of
life
?
How
did
they
all
*NL*
find
place
in
her
?
But
she
was
very
happy
.
As
they
were
nearing
home
she
*NL*
suddenly
struck
up
the
air
of
As
't
was
growing
dark
last
night
--
the
tune
*NL*
of
which
she
had
all
the
way
been
trying
to
get
and
had
at
last
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
it
?
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
thinking
about
just
now
,
Nicholas
?
''
inquired
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
fond
of
asking
one
another
that
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
Nicholas
,
trying
to
remember
.
``
Well
,
you
see
,
first
I
thought
*NL*
that
Rugay
,
the
red
hound
,
was
like
Uncle
,
and
that
if
he
were
a
man
he
*NL*
would
always
keep
Uncle
near
him
,
if
not
for
his
riding
,
then
for
his
*NL*
manner
.
What
a
good
fellow
Uncle
is
!
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
...
Well
,
and
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Wait
a
bit
,
wait
...
Yes
,
first
I
thought
that
we
are
driving
along
*NL*
and
imagining
that
we
are
going
home
,
but
that
heaven
knows
where
we
are
*NL*
really
going
in
the
darkness
,
and
that
we
shall
arrive
and
suddenly
find
*NL*
that
we
are
not
in
Otradnoe
,
but
in
Fairyland
.
And
then
I
thought
...
No
,
*NL*
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
expect
you
thought
of
him
,
''
said
Nicholas
,
smiling
as
Natasha
*NL*
knew
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Natasha
,
though
she
had
in
reality
been
thinking
about
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
at
the
same
time
as
of
the
rest
,
and
of
how
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
``
Uncle
.
''
``
And
then
I
was
saying
to
myself
all
the
way
,
`
How
well
Anisya
*NL*
carried
herself
,
how
well
!
'
''
And
Nicholas
heard
her
spontaneous
,
happy
,
*NL*
ringing
laughter
.
``
And
do
you
know
,
''
she
suddenly
said
,
``
I
know
that
I
*NL*
shall
never
again
be
as
happy
and
tranquil
as
I
am
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rubbish
,
nonsense
,
humbug
!
''
exclaimed
Nicholas
,
and
he
thought
:
``
How
*NL*
charming
this
Natasha
of
mine
is
!
I
have
no
other
friend
like
her
and
*NL*
never
shall
have
.
Why
should
she
marry
?
We
might
always
drive
about
*NL*
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
darling
this
Nicholas
of
mine
is
!
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
are
still
lights
in
the
drawing-room
!
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
windows
of
the
house
that
gleamed
invitingly
in
the
moist
velvety
*NL*
darkness
of
the
night
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Ilya
Rostov
had
resigned
the
position
of
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
*NL*
because
it
involved
him
in
too
much
expense
,
but
still
his
affairs
did
*NL*
not
improve
.
Natasha
and
Nicholas
often
noticed
their
parents
conferring
*NL*
together
anxiously
and
privately
and
heard
suggestions
of
selling
the
*NL*
fine
ancestral
Rostov
house
and
estate
near
Moscow
.
It
was
not
necessary
*NL*
to
entertain
so
freely
as
when
the
count
had
been
Marshal
,
and
life
at
*NL*
Otradnoe
was
quieter
than
in
former
years
,
but
still
the
enormous
house
*NL*
and
its
lodges
were
full
of
people
and
more
than
twenty
sat
down
to
*NL*
table
every
day
.
These
were
all
their
own
people
who
had
settled
down
in
*NL*
the
house
almost
as
members
of
the
family
,
or
persons
who
were
,
it
*NL*
seemed
,
obliged
to
live
in
the
count
's
house
.
Such
were
Dimmler
the
*NL*
musician
and
his
wife
,
Vogel
the
dancing
master
and
his
family
,
Belova
,
*NL*
an
old
maiden
lady
,
an
inmate
of
the
house
,
and
many
others
such
as
*NL*
Petya
's
tutors
,
the
girls
'
former
governess
,
and
other
people
who
simply
*NL*
found
it
preferable
and
more
advantageous
to
live
in
the
count
's
house
*NL*
than
at
home
.
They
had
not
as
many
visitors
as
before
,
but
the
old
*NL*
habits
of
life
without
which
the
count
and
countess
could
not
conceive
*NL*
of
existence
remained
unchanged
.
There
was
still
the
hunting
*NL*
establishment
which
Nicholas
had
even
enlarged
,
the
same
fifty
horses
*NL*
and
fifteen
grooms
in
the
stables
,
the
same
expensive
presents
and
*NL*
dinner
parties
to
the
whole
district
on
name
days
;
there
were
still
the
*NL*
count
's
games
of
whist
and
boston
,
at
which
--
spreading
out
his
cards
so
*NL*
that
everybody
could
see
them
--
he
let
himself
be
plundered
of
hundreds
*NL*
of
rubles
every
day
by
his
neighbors
,
who
looked
upon
an
opportunity
to
*NL*
play
a
rubber
with
Count
Rostov
as
a
most
profitable
source
of
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
moved
in
his
affairs
as
in
a
huge
net
,
trying
not
to
believe
*NL*
that
he
was
entangled
but
becoming
more
and
more
so
at
every
step
,
and
*NL*
feeling
too
feeble
to
break
the
meshes
or
to
set
to
work
carefully
and
*NL*
patiently
to
disentangle
them
.
The
countess
,
with
her
loving
heart
,
felt
*NL*
that
her
children
were
being
ruined
,
that
it
was
not
the
count
's
fault
*NL*
for
he
could
not
help
being
what
he
was
--
that
-LRB-
though
he
tried
to
hide
*NL*
it
-RRB-
he
himself
suffered
from
the
consciousness
of
his
own
and
his
*NL*
children
's
ruin
,
and
she
tried
to
find
means
of
remedying
the
position
.
*NL*
From
her
feminine
point
of
view
she
could
see
only
one
solution
,
namely
,
*NL*
for
Nicholas
to
marry
a
rich
heiress
.
She
felt
this
to
be
their
last
*NL*
hope
and
that
if
Nicholas
refused
the
match
she
had
found
for
him
,
she
*NL*
would
have
to
abandon
the
hope
of
ever
getting
matters
right
.
This
match
*NL*
was
with
Julie
Karagina
,
the
daughter
of
excellent
and
virtuous
parents
,
*NL*
a
girl
the
Rostovs
had
known
from
childhood
,
and
who
had
now
become
a
*NL*
wealthy
heiress
through
the
death
of
the
last
of
her
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
had
written
direct
to
Julie
's
mother
in
Moscow
suggesting
a
*NL*
marriage
between
their
children
and
had
received
a
favorable
answer
from
*NL*
her
.
Karagina
had
replied
that
for
her
part
she
was
agreeable
,
and
*NL*
everything
depend
on
her
daughter
's
inclination
.
She
invited
Nicholas
to
*NL*
come
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
the
countess
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
told
her
son
that
*NL*
now
both
her
daughters
were
settled
,
her
only
wish
was
to
see
him
*NL*
married
.
She
said
she
could
lie
down
in
her
grave
peacefully
if
that
*NL*
were
accomplished
.
Then
she
told
him
that
she
knew
of
a
splendid
girl
*NL*
and
tried
to
discover
what
he
thought
about
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
other
times
she
praised
Julie
to
him
and
advised
him
to
go
to
Moscow
*NL*
during
the
holidays
to
amuse
himself
.
Nicholas
guessed
what
his
mother
's
*NL*
remarks
were
leading
to
and
during
one
of
these
conversations
induced
*NL*
her
to
speak
quite
frankly
.
She
told
him
that
her
only
hope
of
getting
*NL*
their
affairs
disentangled
now
lay
in
his
marrying
Julie
Karagina
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mamma
,
suppose
I
loved
a
girl
who
has
no
fortune
,
would
you
expect
*NL*
me
to
sacrifice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
the
sake
of
money
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
his
mother
,
not
realizing
the
cruelty
of
his
question
and
only
*NL*
wishing
to
show
his
noble-mindedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
have
not
understood
me
,
''
said
his
mother
,
not
knowing
how
to
*NL*
justify
herself
.
``
You
have
not
understood
me
,
Nikolenka
.
It
is
your
*NL*
happiness
I
wish
for
,
''
she
added
,
feeling
that
she
was
telling
an
*NL*
untruth
and
was
becoming
entangled
.
She
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
do
n't
cry
!
Only
tell
me
that
you
wish
it
,
and
you
know
I
will
*NL*
give
my
life
,
anything
,
to
put
you
at
ease
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
``
I
would
*NL*
sacrifice
anything
for
you
--
even
my
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
countess
did
not
want
the
question
put
like
that
:
she
did
not
*NL*
want
a
sacrifice
from
her
son
,
she
herself
wished
to
make
a
sacrifice
*NL*
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
have
not
understood
me
,
do
n't
let
us
talk
about
it
,
''
she
*NL*
replied
,
wiping
away
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
do
love
a
poor
girl
,
''
said
Nicholas
to
himself
.
``
Am
I
to
*NL*
sacrifice
my
feelings
and
my
honor
for
money
?
I
wonder
how
Mamma
could
*NL*
speak
so
to
me
.
Because
Sonya
is
poor
I
must
not
love
her
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
``
must
not
respond
to
her
faithful
,
devoted
love
?
Yet
I
should
certainly
*NL*
be
happier
with
her
than
with
some
doll-like
Julie
.
I
can
always
*NL*
sacrifice
my
feelings
for
my
family
's
welfare
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
coerce
my
feelings
.
If
I
love
Sonya
,
that
feeling
is
for
me
*NL*
stronger
and
higher
than
all
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
did
not
go
to
Moscow
,
and
the
countess
did
not
renew
the
*NL*
conversation
with
him
about
marriage
.
She
saw
with
sorrow
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
with
exasperation
,
symptoms
of
a
growing
attachment
between
her
son
and
*NL*
the
portionless
Sonya
.
Though
she
blamed
herself
for
it
,
she
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
grumbling
at
and
worrying
Sonya
,
often
pulling
her
up
*NL*
without
reason
,
addressing
her
stiffly
as
``
my
dear
,
''
and
using
the
*NL*
formal
``
you
''
instead
of
the
intimate
``
thou
''
in
speaking
to
her
.
The
*NL*
kindhearted
countess
was
the
more
vexed
with
Sonya
because
that
poor
,
*NL*
dark-eyed
niece
of
hers
was
so
meek
,
so
kind
,
so
devotedly
grateful
to
*NL*
her
benefactors
,
and
so
faithfully
,
unchangingly
,
and
unselfishly
in
*NL*
love
with
Nicholas
,
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
finding
fault
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
was
spending
the
last
of
his
leave
at
home
.
A
fourth
letter
had
*NL*
come
from
Prince
Andrew
,
from
Rome
,
in
which
he
wrote
that
he
would
have
*NL*
been
on
his
way
back
to
Russia
long
ago
had
not
his
wound
unexpectedly
*NL*
reopened
in
the
warm
climate
,
which
obliged
him
to
defer
his
return
till
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
.
Natasha
was
still
as
much
in
love
with
*NL*
her
betrothed
,
found
the
same
comfort
in
that
love
,
and
was
still
as
*NL*
ready
to
throw
herself
into
all
the
pleasures
of
life
as
before
;
but
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
fourth
month
of
their
separation
she
began
to
have
fits
*NL*
of
depression
which
she
could
not
master
.
She
felt
sorry
for
herself
:
*NL*
sorry
that
she
was
being
wasted
all
this
time
and
of
no
use
to
anyone
--
*NL*
while
she
felt
herself
so
capable
of
loving
and
being
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
were
not
cheerful
in
the
Rostovs
'
home
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
came
and
except
for
the
ceremonial
Mass
,
the
solemn
and
*NL*
wearisome
Christmas
congratulations
from
neighbors
and
servants
,
and
the
*NL*
new
dresses
everyone
put
on
,
there
were
no
special
festivities
,
though
*NL*
the
calm
frost
of
twenty
degrees
Reaumur
,
the
dazzling
sunshine
by
day
,
*NL*
and
the
starlight
of
the
winter
nights
seemed
to
call
for
some
special
*NL*
celebration
of
the
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
of
Christmas
week
,
after
the
midday
dinner
,
all
the
*NL*
inmates
of
the
house
dispersed
to
various
rooms
.
It
was
the
dullest
time
*NL*
of
the
day
.
Nicholas
,
who
had
been
visiting
some
neighbors
that
morning
,
*NL*
was
asleep
on
the
sitting-room
sofa
.
The
old
count
was
resting
in
his
*NL*
study
.
Sonya
sat
in
the
drawing
room
at
the
round
table
,
copying
a
*NL*
design
for
embroidery
.
The
countess
was
playing
patience
.
Nastasya
*NL*
Ivanovna
the
buffoon
sat
with
a
sad
face
at
the
window
with
two
old
*NL*
ladies
.
Natasha
came
into
the
room
,
went
up
to
Sonya
,
glanced
at
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
,
and
then
went
up
to
her
mother
and
stood
without
*NL*
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
wandering
about
like
an
outcast
?
''
asked
her
mother
.
``
What
*NL*
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
...
I
want
him
...
now
,
this
minute
!
I
want
him
!
''
said
Natasha
,
with
*NL*
glittering
eyes
and
no
sign
of
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
lifted
her
head
and
looked
attentively
at
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
look
at
me
,
Mamma
!
Do
n't
look
;
I
shall
cry
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
with
me
a
little
,
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
I
want
him
.
Why
should
I
be
wasted
like
this
,
Mamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
broke
,
tears
gushed
from
her
eyes
,
and
she
turned
quickly
to
*NL*
hide
them
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
into
the
sitting
room
,
stood
there
thinking
awhile
,
and
then
*NL*
went
into
the
maids
'
room
.
There
an
old
maidservant
was
grumbling
at
a
*NL*
young
girl
who
stood
panting
,
having
just
run
in
through
the
cold
from
*NL*
the
serfs
'
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
playing
--
there
's
a
time
for
everything
,
''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
alone
,
Kondratevna
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Go
,
Mavrushka
,
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
released
Mavrushka
,
Natasha
crossed
the
dancing
hall
and
went
to
*NL*
the
vestibule
.
There
an
old
footman
and
two
young
ones
were
playing
*NL*
cards
.
They
broke
off
and
rose
as
she
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
with
them
?
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Nikita
,
please
go
...
where
can
I
send
him
?
...
Yes
,
go
to
the
yard
*NL*
and
fetch
a
fowl
,
please
,
a
cock
,
and
you
,
Misha
,
bring
me
some
oats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
few
oats
?
''
said
Misha
,
cheerfully
and
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
quickly
,
''
the
old
man
urged
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Theodore
,
get
me
a
piece
of
chalk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
way
past
the
butler
's
pantry
she
told
them
to
set
a
samovar
,
*NL*
though
it
was
not
at
all
the
time
for
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Foka
,
the
butler
,
was
the
most
ill-tempered
person
in
the
house
.
Natasha
*NL*
liked
to
test
her
power
over
him
.
He
distrusted
the
order
and
asked
*NL*
whether
the
samovar
was
really
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
what
a
young
lady
!
''
said
Foka
,
pretending
to
frown
at
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
in
the
house
sent
people
about
or
gave
them
as
much
trouble
as
*NL*
Natasha
did
.
She
could
not
see
people
unconcernedly
,
but
had
to
send
*NL*
them
on
some
errand
.
She
seemed
to
be
trying
whether
any
of
them
would
*NL*
get
angry
or
sulky
with
her
;
but
the
serfs
fulfilled
no
one
's
orders
so
*NL*
readily
as
they
did
hers
.
``
What
can
I
do
,
where
can
I
go
?
''
thought
she
,
*NL*
as
she
went
slowly
along
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasya
Ivanovna
,
what
sort
of
children
shall
I
have
?
''
she
asked
the
*NL*
buffoon
,
who
was
coming
toward
her
in
a
woman
's
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
fleas
,
crickets
,
grasshoppers
,
''
answered
the
buffoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
,
it
's
always
the
same
!
Oh
,
where
am
I
to
go
?
What
am
I
*NL*
to
do
with
myself
?
''
And
tapping
with
her
heels
,
she
ran
quickly
upstairs
*NL*
to
see
Vogel
and
his
wife
who
lived
on
the
upper
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
governesses
were
sitting
with
the
Vogels
at
a
table
,
on
which
were
*NL*
plates
of
raisins
,
walnuts
,
and
almonds
.
The
governesses
were
discussing
*NL*
whether
it
was
cheaper
to
live
in
Moscow
or
Odessa
.
Natasha
sat
down
,
*NL*
listened
to
their
talk
with
a
serious
and
thoughtful
air
,
and
then
got
*NL*
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
island
of
Madagascar
,
''
she
said
,
``
Ma-da-gas-car
,
''
she
repeated
,
*NL*
articulating
each
syllable
distinctly
,
and
,
not
replying
to
Madame
*NL*
Schoss
who
asked
her
what
she
was
saying
,
she
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
Petya
was
upstairs
too
;
with
the
man
in
attendance
on
him
he
*NL*
was
preparing
fireworks
to
let
off
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Petya
!
Petya
!
''
she
called
to
him
.
``
Carry
me
downstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
ran
up
and
offered
her
his
back
.
She
jumped
on
it
,
putting
her
*NL*
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
he
pranced
along
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
...
the
island
of
Madagascar
!
''
she
said
,
and
jumping
off
his
*NL*
back
she
went
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
as
it
were
reviewed
her
kingdom
,
tested
her
power
,
and
made
sure
*NL*
that
everyone
was
submissive
,
but
that
all
the
same
it
was
dull
,
Natasha
*NL*
betook
herself
to
the
ballroom
,
picked
up
her
guitar
,
sat
down
in
a
dark
*NL*
corner
behind
a
bookcase
,
and
began
to
run
her
fingers
over
the
strings
*NL*
in
the
bass
,
picking
out
a
passage
she
recalled
from
an
opera
she
had
*NL*
heard
in
Petersburg
with
Prince
Andrew
.
What
she
drew
from
the
guitar
*NL*
would
have
had
no
meaning
for
other
listeners
,
but
in
her
imagination
a
*NL*
whole
series
of
reminiscences
arose
from
those
sounds
.
She
sat
behind
*NL*
the
bookcase
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
streak
of
light
escaping
from
the
*NL*
pantry
door
and
listened
to
herself
and
pondered
.
She
was
in
a
mood
for
*NL*
brooding
on
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
passed
to
the
pantry
with
a
glass
in
her
hand
.
Natasha
glanced
at
*NL*
her
and
at
the
crack
in
the
pantry
door
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
*NL*
remembered
the
light
falling
through
that
crack
once
before
and
Sonya
*NL*
passing
with
a
glass
in
her
hand
.
``
Yes
it
was
exactly
the
same
,
''
thought
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
what
is
this
?
''
she
cried
,
twanging
a
thick
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
there
!
''
said
Sonya
with
a
start
,
and
came
near
and
*NL*
listened
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
A
storm
?
''
she
ventured
timidly
,
afraid
of
being
*NL*
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
That
's
just
how
she
started
and
just
how
she
came
up
smiling
*NL*
timidly
when
all
this
happened
before
,
''
thought
Natasha
,
``
and
in
just
*NL*
the
same
way
I
thought
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
the
chorus
from
The
Water-Carrier
,
listen
!
''
and
Natasha
sang
*NL*
the
air
of
the
chorus
so
that
Sonya
should
catch
it
.
``
Where
were
you
*NL*
going
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
change
the
water
in
this
glass
.
I
am
just
finishing
the
design
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
find
something
to
do
,
but
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
And
*NL*
where
's
Nicholas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asleep
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
go
and
wake
him
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Tell
him
I
want
him
to
come
and
*NL*
sing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
awhile
,
wondering
what
the
meaning
of
it
all
having
happened
*NL*
before
could
be
,
and
without
solving
this
problem
,
or
at
all
regretting
*NL*
not
having
done
so
,
she
again
passed
in
fancy
to
the
time
when
she
was
*NL*
with
him
and
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
lover
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
only
he
would
come
quicker
!
I
am
so
afraid
it
will
never
be
!
*NL*
And
,
worst
of
all
,
I
am
growing
old
--
that
's
the
thing
!
There
wo
n't
then
*NL*
be
in
me
what
there
is
now
.
But
perhaps
he
'll
come
today
,
will
come
*NL*
immediately
.
Perhaps
he
has
come
and
is
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
came
yesterday
and
I
have
forgotten
it
.
''
She
rose
,
put
down
*NL*
the
guitar
,
and
went
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
domestic
circle
,
tutors
,
governesses
,
and
guests
,
were
already
*NL*
at
the
tea
table
.
The
servants
stood
round
the
table
--
but
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
was
not
there
and
life
was
going
on
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
she
is
!
''
said
the
old
count
,
when
he
saw
Natasha
enter
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
sit
down
by
me
.
''
But
Natasha
stayed
by
her
mother
and
glanced
round
as
*NL*
if
looking
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
''
she
muttered
,
``
give
him
to
me
,
give
him
,
Mamma
,
quickly
,
*NL*
quickly
!
''
and
she
again
had
difficulty
in
repressing
her
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
at
the
table
and
listened
to
the
conversation
between
the
*NL*
elders
and
Nicholas
,
who
had
also
come
to
the
table
.
``
My
God
,
my
God
!
*NL*
The
same
faces
,
the
same
talk
,
Papa
holding
his
cup
and
blowing
in
the
*NL*
same
way
!
''
thought
Natasha
,
feeling
with
horror
a
sense
of
repulsion
*NL*
rising
up
in
her
for
the
whole
household
,
because
they
were
always
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
Nicholas
,
Sonya
,
and
Natasha
went
to
the
sitting
room
,
to
*NL*
their
favorite
corner
where
their
most
intimate
talks
always
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
ever
happen
to
you
,
''
said
Natasha
to
her
brother
,
when
they
*NL*
settled
down
in
the
sitting
room
,
``
does
it
ever
happen
to
you
to
feel
as
*NL*
if
there
were
nothing
more
to
come
--
nothing
;
that
everything
good
is
*NL*
past
?
And
to
feel
not
exactly
dull
,
but
sad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
he
replied
.
``
I
have
felt
like
that
when
everything
*NL*
was
all
right
and
everyone
was
cheerful
.
The
thought
has
come
into
my
*NL*
mind
that
I
was
already
tired
of
it
all
,
and
that
we
must
all
die
.
Once
*NL*
in
the
regiment
I
had
not
gone
to
some
merrymaking
where
there
was
*NL*
music
...
and
suddenly
I
felt
so
depressed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
know
,
I
know
,
I
know
!
''
Natasha
interrupted
him
.
``
When
I
was
*NL*
quite
little
that
used
to
be
so
with
me
.
Do
you
remember
when
I
was
*NL*
punished
once
about
some
plums
?
You
were
all
dancing
,
and
I
sat
sobbing
*NL*
in
the
schoolroom
?
I
shall
never
forget
it
:
I
felt
sad
and
sorry
for
*NL*
everyone
,
for
myself
,
and
for
everyone
.
And
I
was
innocent
--
that
was
the
*NL*
chief
thing
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Do
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
''
answered
Nicholas
.
``
I
remember
that
I
came
to
you
*NL*
afterwards
and
wanted
to
comfort
you
,
but
do
you
know
,
I
felt
ashamed
*NL*
to
.
We
were
terribly
absurd
.
I
had
a
funny
doll
then
and
wanted
to
give
*NL*
it
to
you
.
Do
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
remember
,
''
Natasha
asked
with
a
pensive
smile
,
``
how
once
,
*NL*
long
,
long
ago
,
when
we
were
quite
little
,
Uncle
called
us
into
the
*NL*
study
--
that
was
in
the
old
house
--
and
it
was
dark
--
we
went
in
and
*NL*
suddenly
there
stood
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Negro
,
''
chimed
in
Nicholas
with
a
smile
of
delight
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
remember
.
Even
now
I
do
n't
know
whether
there
really
was
a
Negro
,
or
if
*NL*
we
only
dreamed
it
or
were
told
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
gray
,
you
remember
,
and
had
white
teeth
,
and
stood
and
looked
at
*NL*
us
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
do
you
remember
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
do
remember
something
too
,
''
Sonya
answered
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
have
asked
Papa
and
Mamma
about
that
Negro
,
''
said
Natasha
,
*NL*
``
and
they
say
there
was
no
Negro
at
all
.
But
you
see
,
you
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
,
I
remember
his
teeth
as
if
I
had
just
seen
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
it
is
!
It
's
as
if
it
were
a
dream
!
I
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
remember
how
we
rolled
hard-boiled
eggs
in
the
ballroom
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
two
old
women
began
spinning
round
on
the
carpet
?
Was
that
real
*NL*
or
not
?
Do
you
remember
what
fun
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
remember
how
Papa
in
his
blue
overcoat
fired
a
gun
in
the
*NL*
porch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
went
through
their
memories
,
smiling
with
pleasure
:
not
the
sad
*NL*
memories
of
old
age
,
but
poetic
,
youthful
ones
--
those
impressions
of
*NL*
one
's
most
distant
past
in
which
dreams
and
realities
blend
--
and
they
*NL*
laughed
with
quiet
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
,
as
always
,
did
not
quite
keep
pace
with
them
,
though
they
shared
*NL*
the
same
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
that
they
remembered
had
slipped
from
her
mind
,
and
what
she
*NL*
recalled
did
not
arouse
the
same
poetic
feeling
as
they
experienced
.
She
*NL*
simply
enjoyed
their
pleasure
and
tried
to
fit
in
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
really
took
part
when
they
recalled
Sonya
's
first
arrival
.
She
*NL*
told
them
how
afraid
she
had
been
of
Nicholas
because
he
had
on
a
corded
*NL*
jacket
and
her
nurse
had
told
her
that
she
,
too
,
would
be
sewn
up
with
*NL*
cords
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
remember
their
telling
me
that
you
had
been
born
under
a
*NL*
cabbage
,
''
said
Natasha
,
``
and
I
remember
that
I
dared
not
disbelieve
it
*NL*
then
,
but
knew
that
it
was
not
true
,
and
I
felt
so
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
a
maid
thrust
her
head
in
at
the
other
door
of
*NL*
the
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
brought
the
cock
,
Miss
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
wanted
,
Petya
.
Tell
them
to
take
it
away
,
''
replied
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
their
talk
in
the
sitting
room
,
Dimmler
came
in
and
*NL*
went
up
to
the
harp
that
stood
there
in
a
corner
.
He
took
off
its
cloth
*NL*
covering
,
and
the
harp
gave
out
a
jarring
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dimmler
,
please
play
my
favorite
nocturne
by
Field
,
''
came
the
old
*NL*
countess
'
voice
from
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dimmler
struck
a
chord
and
,
turning
to
Natasha
,
Nicholas
,
and
Sonya
,
*NL*
remarked
:
``
How
quiet
you
young
people
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
're
philosophizing
,
''
said
Natasha
,
glancing
round
for
a
moment
*NL*
and
then
continuing
the
conversation
.
They
were
now
discussing
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dimmler
began
to
play
;
Natasha
went
on
tiptoe
noiselessly
to
the
table
,
*NL*
took
up
a
candle
,
carried
it
out
,
and
returned
,
seating
herself
quietly
*NL*
in
her
former
place
.
It
was
dark
in
the
room
especially
where
they
were
*NL*
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
but
through
the
big
windows
the
silvery
light
of
*NL*
the
full
moon
fell
on
the
floor
.
Dimmler
had
finished
the
piece
but
*NL*
still
sat
softly
running
his
fingers
over
the
strings
,
evidently
*NL*
uncertain
whether
to
stop
or
to
play
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
said
Natasha
in
a
whisper
,
moving
closer
to
Nicholas
and
*NL*
Sonya
,
``
that
when
one
goes
on
and
on
recalling
memories
,
one
at
last
*NL*
begins
to
remember
what
happened
before
one
was
in
the
world
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
metempsychosis
,
''
said
Sonya
,
who
had
always
learned
well
,
and
*NL*
remembered
everything
.
``
The
Egyptians
believed
that
our
souls
have
lived
*NL*
in
animals
,
and
will
go
back
into
animals
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
believe
we
ever
were
in
animals
,
''
said
Natasha
,
still
in
a
*NL*
whisper
though
the
music
had
ceased
.
``
But
I
am
certain
that
we
were
*NL*
angels
somewhere
there
,
and
have
been
here
,
and
that
is
why
we
*NL*
remember
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
join
you
?
''
said
Dimmler
who
had
come
up
quietly
,
and
he
sat
down
*NL*
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
have
been
angels
,
why
have
we
fallen
lower
?
''
said
Nicholas
.
``
No
,
*NL*
that
ca
n't
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
lower
,
who
said
we
were
lower
?
...
How
do
I
know
what
I
was
before
?
''
*NL*
Natasha
rejoined
with
conviction
.
``
The
soul
is
immortal
--
well
then
,
if
I
*NL*
shall
always
live
I
must
have
lived
before
,
lived
for
a
whole
eternity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
is
hard
for
us
to
imagine
eternity
,
''
remarked
Dimmler
,
who
*NL*
had
joined
the
young
folk
with
a
mildly
condescending
smile
but
now
*NL*
spoke
as
quietly
and
seriously
as
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
hard
to
imagine
eternity
?
''
said
Natasha
.
``
It
is
now
today
,
*NL*
and
it
will
be
tomorrow
,
and
always
;
and
there
was
yesterday
,
and
the
*NL*
day
before
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
!
Now
it
's
your
turn
.
Sing
me
something
,
''
they
heard
the
*NL*
countess
say
.
``
Why
are
you
sitting
there
like
conspirators
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
I
do
n't
at
all
want
to
,
''
replied
Natasha
,
but
all
the
same
she
*NL*
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
them
,
not
even
the
middle-aged
Dimmler
,
wanted
to
break
off
*NL*
their
conversation
and
quit
that
corner
in
the
sitting
room
,
but
Natasha
*NL*
got
up
and
Nicholas
sat
down
at
the
clavichord
.
Standing
as
usual
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
hall
and
choosing
the
place
where
the
resonance
was
best
,
*NL*
Natasha
began
to
sing
her
mother
's
favorite
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
said
she
did
not
want
to
sing
,
but
it
was
long
since
she
had
*NL*
sung
,
and
long
before
she
again
sang
,
as
she
did
that
evening
.
The
*NL*
count
,
from
his
study
where
he
was
talking
to
Mitenka
,
heard
her
and
,
*NL*
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
hurry
to
run
out
to
play
,
blundered
in
his
talk
*NL*
while
giving
orders
to
the
steward
,
and
at
last
stopped
,
while
Mitenka
*NL*
stood
in
front
of
him
also
listening
and
smiling
.
Nicholas
did
not
take
*NL*
his
eyes
off
his
sister
and
drew
breath
in
time
with
her
.
Sonya
,
as
she
*NL*
listened
,
thought
of
the
immense
difference
there
was
between
herself
*NL*
and
her
friend
,
and
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
be
anything
like
as
*NL*
bewitching
as
her
cousin
.
The
old
countess
sat
with
a
blissful
yet
sad
*NL*
smile
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
occasionally
shaking
her
head
.
She
*NL*
thought
of
Natasha
and
of
her
own
youth
,
and
of
how
there
was
something
*NL*
unnatural
and
dreadful
in
this
impending
marriage
of
Natasha
and
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dimmler
,
who
had
seated
himself
beside
the
countess
,
listened
with
*NL*
closed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Countess
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
that
's
a
European
talent
,
she
has
*NL*
nothing
to
learn
--
what
softness
,
tenderness
,
and
strength
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
afraid
I
am
for
her
,
how
afraid
I
am
!
''
said
the
countess
,
not
*NL*
realizing
to
whom
she
was
speaking
.
Her
maternal
instinct
told
her
that
*NL*
Natasha
had
too
much
of
something
,
and
that
because
of
this
she
would
*NL*
not
be
happy
.
Before
Natasha
had
finished
singing
,
fourteen-year-old
*NL*
Petya
rushed
in
delightedly
,
to
say
that
some
mummers
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
stopped
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Idiot
!
''
she
screamed
at
her
brother
and
,
running
to
a
chair
,
threw
*NL*
herself
on
it
,
sobbing
so
violently
that
she
could
not
stop
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
Mamma
,
really
it
's
nothing
;
only
Petya
startled
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
trying
to
smile
,
but
her
tears
still
flowed
and
sobs
still
choked
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mummers
-LRB-
some
of
the
house
serfs
-RRB-
dressed
up
as
bears
,
Turks
,
*NL*
innkeepers
,
and
ladies
--
frightening
and
funny
--
bringing
in
with
them
the
*NL*
cold
from
outside
and
a
feeling
of
gaiety
,
crowded
,
at
first
timidly
,
*NL*
into
the
anteroom
,
then
hiding
behind
one
another
they
pushed
into
the
*NL*
ballroom
where
,
shyly
at
first
and
then
more
and
more
merrily
and
*NL*
heartily
,
they
started
singing
,
dancing
,
and
playing
Christmas
games
.
*NL*
The
countess
,
when
she
had
identified
them
and
laughed
at
their
*NL*
costumes
,
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
The
count
sat
in
the
ballroom
,
*NL*
smiling
radiantly
and
applauding
the
players
.
The
young
people
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
there
appeared
among
the
other
mummers
in
the
*NL*
ballroom
an
old
lady
in
a
hooped
skirt
--
this
was
Nicholas
.
A
Turkish
*NL*
girl
was
Petya
.
A
clown
was
Dimmler
.
An
hussar
was
Natasha
,
and
a
*NL*
Circassian
was
Sonya
with
burnt-cork
mustache
and
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
condescending
surprise
,
nonrecognition
,
and
praise
,
from
those
*NL*
who
were
not
themselves
dressed
up
,
the
young
people
decided
that
their
*NL*
costumes
were
so
good
that
they
ought
to
be
shown
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
who
,
as
the
roads
were
in
splendid
condition
,
wanted
to
take
*NL*
them
all
for
a
drive
in
his
troyka
,
proposed
to
take
with
them
about
a
*NL*
dozen
of
the
serf
mummers
and
drive
to
``
Uncle
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
why
disturb
the
old
fellow
?
''
said
the
countess
.
``
Besides
,
you
*NL*
would
n't
have
room
to
turn
round
there
.
If
you
must
go
,
go
to
the
*NL*
Melyukovs
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Melyukova
was
a
widow
,
who
,
with
her
family
and
their
tutors
and
*NL*
governesses
,
lived
three
miles
from
the
Rostovs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
my
dear
,
''
chimed
in
the
old
count
,
thoroughly
aroused
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
dress
up
at
once
and
go
with
them
.
I
'll
make
Pashette
open
her
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
countess
would
not
agree
to
his
going
;
he
had
had
a
bad
leg
all
*NL*
these
last
days
.
It
was
decided
that
the
count
must
not
go
,
but
that
if
*NL*
Louisa
Ivanovna
-LRB-
Madame
Schoss
-RRB-
would
go
with
them
,
the
young
ladies
*NL*
might
go
to
the
Melyukovs
'
,
Sonya
,
generally
so
timid
and
shy
,
more
*NL*
urgently
than
anyone
begging
Louisa
Ivanovna
not
to
refuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
's
costume
was
the
best
of
all
.
Her
mustache
and
eyebrows
were
*NL*
extraordinarily
becoming
.
Everyone
told
her
she
looked
very
handsome
,
*NL*
and
she
was
in
a
spirited
and
energetic
mood
unusual
with
her
.
Some
*NL*
inner
voice
told
her
that
now
or
never
her
fate
would
be
decided
,
and
in
*NL*
her
male
attire
she
seemed
quite
a
different
person
.
Louisa
Ivanovna
*NL*
consented
to
go
,
and
in
half
an
hour
four
troyka
sleighs
with
large
and
*NL*
small
bells
,
their
runners
squeaking
and
whistling
over
the
frozen
snow
,
*NL*
drove
up
to
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
foremost
in
setting
a
merry
holiday
tone
,
which
,
passing
*NL*
from
one
to
another
,
grew
stronger
and
reached
its
climax
when
they
all
*NL*
came
out
into
the
frost
and
got
into
the
sleighs
,
talking
,
calling
to
*NL*
one
another
,
laughing
,
and
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
troykas
were
the
usual
household
sleighs
,
the
third
was
the
*NL*
old
count
's
with
a
trotter
from
the
Orlov
stud
as
shaft
horse
,
the
*NL*
fourth
was
Nicholas
'
own
with
a
short
shaggy
black
shaft
horse
.
*NL*
Nicholas
,
in
his
old
lady
's
dress
over
which
he
had
belted
his
hussar
*NL*
overcoat
,
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
sleigh
,
reins
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
light
that
he
could
see
the
moonlight
reflected
from
the
metal
*NL*
harness
disks
and
from
the
eyes
of
the
horses
,
who
looked
round
in
alarm
*NL*
at
the
noisy
party
under
the
shadow
of
the
porch
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
Sonya
,
Madame
Schoss
,
and
two
maids
got
into
Nicholas
'
sleigh
;
*NL*
Dimmler
,
his
wife
,
and
Petya
,
into
the
old
count
's
,
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
mummers
seated
themselves
in
the
other
two
sleighs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
ahead
,
Zakhar
!
''
shouted
Nicholas
to
his
father
's
coachman
,
*NL*
wishing
for
a
chance
to
race
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
count
's
troyka
,
with
Dimmler
and
his
party
,
started
forward
,
*NL*
squeaking
on
its
runners
as
though
freezing
to
the
snow
,
its
deep-toned
*NL*
bell
clanging
.
The
side
horses
,
pressing
against
the
shafts
of
the
*NL*
middle
horse
,
sank
in
the
snow
,
which
was
dry
and
glittered
like
sugar
,
*NL*
and
threw
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
set
off
,
following
the
first
sleigh
;
behind
him
the
others
*NL*
moved
noisily
,
their
runners
squeaking
.
At
first
they
drove
at
a
steady
*NL*
trot
along
the
narrow
road
.
While
they
drove
past
the
garden
the
shadows
*NL*
of
the
bare
trees
often
fell
across
the
road
and
hid
the
brilliant
*NL*
moonlight
,
but
as
soon
as
they
were
past
the
fence
,
the
snowy
plain
*NL*
bathed
in
moonlight
and
motionless
spread
out
before
them
glittering
*NL*
like
diamonds
and
dappled
with
bluish
shadows
.
Bang
,
bang
!
went
the
*NL*
first
sleigh
over
a
cradle
hole
in
the
snow
of
the
road
,
and
each
of
the
*NL*
other
sleighs
jolted
in
the
same
way
,
and
rudely
breaking
the
frost
-
*NL*
bound
stillness
,
the
troykas
began
to
speed
along
the
road
,
one
after
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hare
's
track
,
a
lot
of
tracks
!
''
rang
out
Natasha
's
voice
through
the
*NL*
frost-bound
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
light
it
is
,
Nicholas
!
''
came
Sonya
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
glanced
round
at
Sonya
,
and
bent
down
to
see
her
face
closer
.
*NL*
Quite
a
new
,
sweet
face
with
black
eyebrows
and
mustaches
peeped
up
at
*NL*
him
from
her
sable
furs
--
so
close
and
yet
so
distant
--
in
the
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
used
to
be
Sonya
,
''
thought
he
,
and
looked
at
her
closer
and
*NL*
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Nicholas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
he
and
turned
again
to
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
out
onto
the
beaten
highroad
--
polished
by
sleigh
runners
*NL*
and
cut
up
by
rough-shod
hoofs
,
the
marks
of
which
were
visible
in
the
*NL*
moonlight
--
the
horses
began
to
tug
at
the
reins
of
their
own
accord
and
*NL*
increased
their
pace
.
The
near
side
horse
,
arching
his
head
and
breaking
*NL*
into
a
short
canter
,
tugged
at
his
traces
.
The
shaft
horse
swayed
from
*NL*
side
to
side
,
moving
his
ears
as
if
asking
:
``
Is
n't
it
time
to
begin
*NL*
now
?
''
In
front
,
already
far
ahead
the
deep
bell
of
the
sleigh
ringing
*NL*
farther
and
farther
off
,
the
black
horses
driven
by
Zakhar
could
be
*NL*
clearly
seen
against
the
white
snow
.
From
that
sleigh
one
could
hear
the
*NL*
shouts
,
laughter
,
and
voices
of
the
mummers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
up
,
my
darlings
!
''
shouted
Nicholas
,
pulling
the
reins
to
one
side
*NL*
and
flourishing
the
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
by
the
keener
wind
that
met
them
and
the
jerks
given
by
the
*NL*
side
horses
who
pulled
harder
--
ever
increasing
their
gallop
--
that
one
*NL*
noticed
how
fast
the
troyka
was
flying
.
Nicholas
looked
back
.
With
*NL*
screams
squeals
,
and
waving
of
whips
that
caused
even
the
shaft
horses
*NL*
to
gallop
--
the
other
sleighs
followed
.
The
shaft
horse
swung
steadily
*NL*
beneath
the
bow
over
its
head
,
with
no
thought
of
slackening
pace
and
*NL*
ready
to
put
on
speed
when
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
overtook
the
first
sleigh
.
They
were
driving
downhill
and
*NL*
coming
out
upon
a
broad
trodden
track
across
a
meadow
,
near
a
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
?
''
thought
he
.
``
It
's
the
Kosoy
meadow
,
I
suppose
.
But
no
--
*NL*
this
is
something
new
I
've
never
seen
before
.
This
is
n't
the
Kosoy
*NL*
meadow
nor
the
Demkin
hill
,
and
heaven
only
knows
what
it
is
!
It
is
*NL*
something
new
and
enchanted
.
Well
,
whatever
it
may
be
...
''
And
shouting
*NL*
to
his
horses
,
he
began
to
pass
the
first
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zakhar
held
back
his
horses
and
turned
his
face
,
which
was
already
*NL*
covered
with
hoarfrost
to
his
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
gave
the
horses
the
rein
,
and
Zakhar
,
stretching
out
his
arms
,
*NL*
clucked
his
tongue
and
let
his
horses
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
look
out
,
master
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Faster
still
the
two
troykas
flew
side
by
side
,
and
faster
moved
the
*NL*
feet
of
the
galloping
side
horses
.
Nicholas
began
to
draw
ahead
.
Zakhar
,
*NL*
while
still
keeping
his
arms
extended
,
raised
one
hand
with
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
wo
n't
,
master
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
put
all
his
horses
to
a
gallop
and
passed
Zakhar
.
The
horses
*NL*
showered
the
fine
dry
snow
on
the
faces
of
those
in
the
sleigh
--
beside
*NL*
them
sounded
quick
ringing
bells
and
they
caught
confused
glimpses
of
*NL*
swiftly
moving
legs
and
the
shadows
of
the
troyka
they
were
passing
.
The
*NL*
whistling
sound
of
the
runners
on
the
snow
and
the
voices
of
girls
*NL*
shrieking
were
heard
from
different
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
checking
his
horses
,
Nicholas
looked
around
him
.
They
were
still
*NL*
surrounded
by
the
magic
plain
bathed
in
moonlight
and
spangled
with
*NL*
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zakhar
is
shouting
that
I
should
turn
to
the
left
,
but
why
to
the
*NL*
left
?
''
thought
Nicholas
.
``
Are
we
getting
to
the
Melyukovs
'
?
Is
this
*NL*
Melyukovka
?
Heaven
only
knows
where
we
are
going
,
and
heaven
knows
what
*NL*
is
happening
to
us
--
but
it
is
very
strange
and
pleasant
whatever
it
is
.
''
*NL*
And
he
looked
round
in
the
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
his
mustache
and
eyelashes
are
all
white
!
''
said
one
of
the
*NL*
strange
,
pretty
,
unfamiliar
people
--
the
one
with
fine
eyebrows
and
*NL*
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
this
used
to
be
Natasha
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
``
and
that
was
*NL*
Madame
Schoss
,
but
perhaps
it
's
not
,
and
this
Circassian
with
the
*NL*
mustache
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
love
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
cold
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
answer
but
began
to
laugh
.
Dimmler
from
the
sleigh
behind
*NL*
shouted
something
--
probably
something
funny
--
but
they
could
not
make
out
*NL*
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
some
voices
answered
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
was
a
fairy
forest
with
black
moving
shadows
,
and
a
glitter
of
*NL*
diamonds
and
a
flight
of
marble
steps
and
the
silver
roofs
of
fairy
*NL*
buildings
and
the
shrill
yells
of
some
animals
.
And
if
this
is
really
*NL*
Melyukovka
,
it
is
still
stranger
that
we
drove
heaven
knows
where
and
*NL*
have
come
to
Melyukovka
,
''
thought
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
really
was
Melyukovka
,
and
maids
and
footmen
with
merry
faces
came
*NL*
running
,
out
to
the
porch
carrying
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
asked
someone
in
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mummers
from
the
count
's
.
I
know
by
the
horses
,
''
replied
some
*NL*
voices
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
Danilovna
Melyukova
,
a
broadly
built
,
energetic
woman
wearing
*NL*
spectacles
,
sat
in
the
drawing
room
in
a
loose
dress
,
surrounded
by
her
*NL*
daughters
whom
she
was
trying
to
keep
from
feeling
dull
.
They
were
*NL*
quietly
dropping
melted
wax
into
snow
and
looking
at
the
shadows
the
wax
*NL*
figures
would
throw
on
the
wall
,
when
they
heard
the
steps
and
voices
of
*NL*
new
arrivals
in
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hussars
,
ladies
,
witches
,
clowns
,
and
bears
,
after
clearing
their
*NL*
throats
and
wiping
the
hoarfrost
from
their
faces
in
the
vestibule
,
came
*NL*
into
the
ballroom
where
candles
were
hurriedly
lighted
.
The
clown
--
*NL*
Dimmler
--
and
the
lady
--
Nicholas
--
started
a
dance
.
Surrounded
by
the
*NL*
screaming
children
the
mummers
,
covering
their
faces
and
disguising
*NL*
their
voices
,
bowed
to
their
hostess
and
arranged
themselves
about
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
there
's
no
recognizing
them
!
And
Natasha
!
See
whom
she
looks
*NL*
like
!
She
really
reminds
me
of
somebody
.
But
Herr
Dimmler
--
is
n't
he
*NL*
good
!
I
did
n't
know
him
!
And
how
he
dances
.
Dear
me
,
there
's
a
*NL*
Circassian
.
Really
,
how
becoming
it
is
to
dear
Sonya
.
And
who
is
that
?
*NL*
Well
,
you
have
cheered
us
up
!
Nikita
and
Vanya
--
clear
away
the
tables
!
*NL*
And
we
were
sitting
so
quietly
.
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
...
The
hussar
,
the
hussar
!
*NL*
Just
like
a
boy
!
And
the
legs
!
...
I
ca
n't
look
at
him
...
''
different
*NL*
voices
were
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
the
young
Melyukovs
'
favorite
,
disappeared
with
them
into
the
*NL*
back
rooms
where
a
cork
and
various
dressing
gowns
and
male
garments
*NL*
were
called
for
and
received
from
the
footman
by
bare
girlish
arms
from
*NL*
behind
the
door
.
Ten
minutes
later
,
all
the
young
Melyukovs
joined
the
*NL*
mummers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
Danilovna
,
having
given
orders
to
clear
the
rooms
for
the
*NL*
visitors
and
arranged
about
refreshments
for
the
gentry
and
the
serfs
,
*NL*
went
about
among
the
mummers
without
removing
her
spectacles
,
peering
*NL*
into
their
faces
with
a
suppressed
smile
and
failing
to
recognize
any
of
*NL*
them
.
It
was
not
merely
Dimmler
and
the
Rostovs
she
failed
to
recognize
,
*NL*
she
did
not
even
recognize
her
own
daughters
,
or
her
late
husband
's
,
*NL*
dressing
gowns
and
uniforms
,
which
they
had
put
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
this
?
''
she
asked
her
governess
,
peering
into
the
face
of
her
*NL*
own
daughter
dressed
up
as
a
Kazan-Tartar
.
``
I
suppose
it
is
one
of
the
*NL*
Rostovs
!
Well
,
Mr.
Hussar
,
and
what
regiment
do
you
serve
in
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
Natasha
.
``
Here
,
hand
some
fruit
jelly
to
the
Turk
!
''
she
ordered
the
*NL*
butler
who
was
handing
things
round
.
``
That
's
not
forbidden
by
his
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
as
she
looked
at
the
strange
but
amusing
capers
cut
by
the
*NL*
dancers
,
who
--
having
decided
once
for
all
that
being
disguised
,
no
one
*NL*
would
recognize
them
--
were
not
at
all
shy
,
Pelageya
Danilovna
hid
her
*NL*
face
in
her
handkerchief
,
and
her
whole
stout
body
shook
with
*NL*
irrepressible
,
kindly
,
elderly
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
little
Sasha
!
Look
at
Sasha
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Russian
country
dances
and
chorus
dances
,
Pelageya
Danilovna
made
*NL*
the
serfs
and
gentry
join
in
one
large
circle
:
a
ring
,
a
string
,
and
a
*NL*
silver
ruble
were
fetched
and
they
all
played
games
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
hour
,
all
the
costumes
were
crumpled
and
disordered
.
The
corked
*NL*
eyebrows
and
mustaches
were
smeared
over
the
perspiring
,
flushed
,
and
*NL*
merry
faces
.
Pelageya
Danilovna
began
to
recognize
the
mummers
,
admired
*NL*
their
cleverly
contrived
costumes
,
and
particularly
how
they
suited
the
*NL*
young
ladies
,
and
she
thanked
them
all
for
having
entertained
her
so
*NL*
well
.
The
visitors
were
invited
to
supper
in
the
drawing
room
,
and
the
*NL*
serfs
had
something
served
to
them
in
the
ballroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
to
tell
one
's
fortune
in
the
empty
bathhouse
is
frightening
!
''
said
*NL*
an
old
maid
who
lived
with
the
Melyukovs
,
during
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
the
eldest
Melyukov
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
go
,
it
takes
courage
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
what
happened
to
the
young
lady
!
''
said
the
second
Melyukov
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
began
the
old
maid
,
``
a
young
lady
once
went
out
,
took
a
cock
,
*NL*
laid
the
table
for
two
,
all
properly
,
and
sat
down
.
After
sitting
a
*NL*
while
,
she
suddenly
hears
someone
coming
...
a
sleigh
drives
up
with
*NL*
harness
bells
;
she
hears
him
coming
!
He
comes
in
,
just
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
man
,
like
an
officer
--
comes
in
and
sits
down
to
table
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
ah
!
''
screamed
Natasha
,
rolling
her
eyes
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
And
how
...
did
he
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
like
a
man
.
Everything
quite
all
right
,
and
he
began
persuading
*NL*
her
;
and
she
should
have
kept
him
talking
till
cockcrow
,
but
she
got
*NL*
frightened
,
just
got
frightened
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
Then
he
*NL*
caught
her
up
.
It
was
lucky
the
maids
ran
in
just
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
why
frighten
them
?
''
said
Pelageya
Danilovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
you
used
to
try
your
fate
yourself
...
''
said
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
one
do
it
in
a
barn
?
''
inquired
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
say
you
went
to
the
barn
now
,
and
listened
.
It
depends
on
what
*NL*
you
hear
;
hammering
and
knocking
--
that
's
bad
;
but
a
sound
of
shifting
*NL*
grain
is
good
and
one
sometimes
hears
that
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
tell
us
what
happened
to
you
in
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pelageya
Danilovna
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
forgotten
...
''
she
replied
.
``
But
none
of
you
would
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
;
Pelageya
Danilovna
,
let
me
!
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
not
,
if
you
're
not
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louisa
Ivanovna
,
may
I
?
''
asked
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
they
were
playing
the
ring
and
string
game
or
the
ruble
game
or
*NL*
talking
as
now
,
Nicholas
did
not
leave
Sonya
's
side
,
and
gazed
at
her
*NL*
with
quite
new
eyes
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
only
today
,
thanks
to
*NL*
that
burnt-cork
mustache
,
that
he
had
fully
learned
to
know
her
.
And
*NL*
really
,
that
evening
,
Sonya
was
brighter
,
more
animated
,
and
prettier
*NL*
than
Nicholas
had
ever
seen
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
what
she
is
like
;
what
a
fool
I
have
been
!
''
he
thought
gazing
*NL*
at
her
sparkling
eyes
,
and
under
the
mustache
a
happy
rapturous
smile
*NL*
dimpled
her
cheeks
,
a
smile
he
had
never
seen
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
anything
,
''
said
Sonya
.
``
May
I
go
at
once
?
''
She
got
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
told
her
where
the
barn
was
and
how
she
should
stand
and
listen
,
*NL*
and
they
handed
her
a
fur
cloak
.
She
threw
this
over
her
head
and
*NL*
shoulders
and
glanced
at
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
darling
that
girl
is
!
''
thought
he
.
``
And
what
have
I
been
*NL*
thinking
of
till
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
went
out
into
the
passage
to
go
to
the
barn
.
Nicholas
went
hastily
*NL*
to
the
front
porch
,
saying
he
felt
too
hot
.
The
crowd
of
people
really
*NL*
had
made
the
house
stuffy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
,
there
was
the
same
cold
stillness
and
the
same
moon
,
but
even
*NL*
brighter
than
before
.
The
light
was
so
strong
and
the
snow
sparkled
with
*NL*
so
many
stars
that
one
did
not
wish
to
look
up
at
the
sky
and
the
real
*NL*
stars
were
unnoticed
.
The
sky
was
black
and
dreary
,
while
the
earth
was
*NL*
gay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
fool
,
a
fool
!
what
have
I
been
waiting
for
?
''
thought
Nicholas
,
*NL*
and
running
out
from
the
porch
he
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
*NL*
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
back
porch
.
He
knew
Sonya
would
pass
that
*NL*
way
.
Halfway
lay
some
snow-covered
piles
of
firewood
and
across
and
*NL*
along
them
a
network
of
shadows
from
the
bare
old
lime
trees
fell
on
the
*NL*
snow
and
on
the
path
.
This
path
led
to
the
barn
.
The
log
walls
of
the
*NL*
barn
and
its
snow-covered
roof
,
that
looked
as
if
hewn
out
of
some
*NL*
precious
stone
,
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
.
A
tree
in
the
garden
snapped
*NL*
with
the
frost
,
and
then
all
was
again
perfectly
silent
.
His
bosom
*NL*
seemed
to
inhale
not
air
but
the
strength
of
eternal
youth
and
gladness
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
back
porch
came
the
sound
of
feet
descending
the
steps
,
the
*NL*
bottom
step
upon
which
snow
had
fallen
gave
a
ringing
creak
and
he
heard
*NL*
the
voice
of
an
old
maidservant
saying
,
``
Straight
,
straight
,
along
the
*NL*
path
,
Miss.
.
Only
,
do
n't
look
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
afraid
,
''
answered
Sonya
's
voice
,
and
along
the
path
toward
*NL*
Nicholas
came
the
crunching
,
whistling
sound
of
Sonya
's
feet
in
her
thin
*NL*
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
came
along
,
wrapped
in
her
cloak
.
She
was
only
a
couple
of
paces
*NL*
away
when
she
saw
him
,
and
to
her
too
he
was
not
the
Nicholas
she
had
*NL*
known
and
always
slightly
feared
.
He
was
in
a
woman
's
dress
,
with
*NL*
tousled
hair
and
a
happy
smile
new
to
Sonya
.
She
ran
rapidly
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
different
and
yet
the
same
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
face
all
lit
up
by
the
moonlight
.
He
slipped
his
arms
under
the
cloak
*NL*
that
covered
her
head
,
embraced
her
,
pressed
her
to
him
,
and
kissed
her
*NL*
on
the
lips
that
wore
a
mustache
and
had
a
smell
of
burnt
cork
.
Sonya
*NL*
kissed
him
full
on
the
lips
,
and
disengaging
her
little
hands
pressed
*NL*
them
to
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
...
Nicholas
!
''
...
was
all
they
said
.
They
ran
to
the
barn
and
*NL*
then
back
again
,
re-entering
,
he
by
the
front
and
she
by
the
back
porch
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
all
drove
back
from
Pelageya
Danilovna
's
,
Natasha
,
who
always
*NL*
saw
and
noticed
everything
,
arranged
that
she
and
Madame
Schoss
should
*NL*
go
back
in
the
sleigh
with
Dimmler
,
and
Sonya
with
Nicholas
and
the
*NL*
maids
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
back
Nicholas
drove
at
a
steady
pace
instead
of
racing
and
*NL*
kept
peering
by
that
fantastic
all-transforming
light
into
Sonya
's
face
*NL*
and
searching
beneath
the
eyebrows
and
mustache
for
his
former
and
his
*NL*
present
Sonya
from
whom
he
had
resolved
never
to
be
parted
again
.
He
*NL*
looked
and
recognizing
in
her
both
the
old
and
the
new
Sonya
,
and
being
*NL*
reminded
by
the
smell
of
burnt
cork
of
the
sensation
of
her
kiss
,
*NL*
inhaled
the
frosty
air
with
a
full
breast
and
,
looking
at
the
ground
*NL*
flying
beneath
him
and
at
the
sparkling
sky
,
felt
himself
again
in
*NL*
fairyland
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
is
it
well
with
thee
?
''
he
asked
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
replied
.
``
And
with
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
halfway
home
Nicholas
handed
the
reins
to
the
coachman
and
ran
for
*NL*
a
moment
to
Natasha
's
sleigh
and
stood
on
its
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
!
''
he
whispered
in
French
,
``
do
you
know
I
have
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
about
Sonya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
her
?
''
asked
Natasha
,
suddenly
beaming
all
over
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
strange
you
are
with
that
mustache
and
those
eyebrows
!
...
*NL*
Natasha
--
are
you
glad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
,
so
glad
!
I
was
beginning
to
be
vexed
with
you
.
I
did
not
*NL*
tell
you
,
but
you
have
been
treating
her
badly
.
What
a
heart
she
has
,
*NL*
Nicholas
!
I
am
horrid
sometimes
,
but
I
was
ashamed
to
be
happy
while
*NL*
Sonya
was
not
,
''
continued
Natasha
.
``
Now
I
am
so
glad
!
Well
,
run
back
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
a
bit
...
Oh
,
how
funny
you
look
!
''
cried
Nicholas
,
peering
*NL*
into
her
face
and
finding
in
his
sister
too
something
new
,
unusual
,
and
*NL*
bewitchingly
tender
that
he
had
not
seen
in
her
before
.
``
Natasha
,
it
's
*NL*
magical
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
.
``
You
have
done
splendidly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
seen
her
before
as
she
is
now
,
''
thought
Nicholas
,
``
I
should
long
*NL*
ago
have
asked
her
what
to
do
and
have
done
whatever
she
told
me
,
and
*NL*
all
would
have
been
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
glad
and
I
have
done
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quite
right
!
I
had
a
quarrel
with
Mamma
some
time
ago
about
it
.
*NL*
Mamma
said
she
was
angling
for
you
.
How
could
she
say
such
a
thing
!
I
*NL*
nearly
stormed
at
Mamma
.
I
will
never
let
anyone
say
anything
bad
of
*NL*
Sonya
,
for
there
is
nothing
but
good
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
all
right
?
''
said
Nicholas
,
again
scrutinizing
the
expression
*NL*
of
his
sister
's
face
to
see
if
she
was
in
earnest
.
Then
he
jumped
down
*NL*
and
,
his
boots
scrunching
the
snow
,
ran
back
to
his
sleigh
.
The
same
*NL*
happy
,
smiling
Circassian
,
with
mustache
and
beaming
eyes
looking
up
*NL*
from
under
a
sable
hood
,
was
still
sitting
there
,
and
that
Circassian
*NL*
was
Sonya
,
and
that
Sonya
was
certainly
his
future
happy
and
loving
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
home
and
had
told
their
mother
how
they
had
spent
the
*NL*
evening
at
the
Melyukovs
'
,
the
girls
went
to
their
bedroom
.
When
they
*NL*
had
undressed
,
but
without
washing
off
the
cork
mustaches
,
they
sat
a
*NL*
long
time
talking
of
their
happiness
.
They
talked
of
how
they
would
live
*NL*
when
they
were
married
,
how
their
husbands
would
be
friends
,
and
how
*NL*
happy
they
would
be
.
On
Natasha
's
table
stood
two
looking
glasses
which
*NL*
Dunyasha
had
prepared
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
when
will
all
that
be
?
I
am
afraid
never
...
It
would
be
too
*NL*
good
!
''
said
Natasha
,
rising
and
going
to
the
looking
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Natasha
;
perhaps
you
'll
see
him
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
lit
the
candles
,
one
on
each
side
of
one
of
the
looking
glasses
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
someone
with
a
mustache
,
''
said
Natasha
,
seeing
her
own
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
laugh
,
Miss
,
''
said
Dunyasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Sonya
's
help
and
the
maid
's
,
Natasha
got
the
glass
she
held
into
*NL*
the
right
position
opposite
the
other
;
her
face
assumed
a
serious
*NL*
expression
and
she
sat
silent
.
She
sat
a
long
time
looking
at
the
*NL*
receding
line
of
candles
reflected
in
the
glasses
and
expecting
-LRB-
from
*NL*
tales
she
had
heard
-RRB-
to
see
a
coffin
,
or
him
,
Prince
Andrew
,
in
that
*NL*
last
dim
,
indistinctly
outlined
square
.
But
ready
as
she
was
to
take
the
*NL*
smallest
speck
for
the
image
of
a
man
or
of
a
coffin
,
she
saw
nothing
.
*NL*
She
began
blinking
rapidly
and
moved
away
from
the
looking
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
others
see
things
and
I
do
n't
?
''
she
said
.
``
You
sit
down
now
,
*NL*
Sonya
.
You
absolutely
must
,
tonight
!
Do
it
for
me
...
Today
I
feel
so
*NL*
frightened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
sat
down
before
the
glasses
,
got
the
right
position
,
and
began
*NL*
looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Sonya
is
sure
to
see
something
,
''
whispered
Dunyasha
;
``
while
*NL*
you
do
nothing
but
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
heard
this
and
Natasha
's
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
she
will
.
She
saw
something
last
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
about
three
minutes
all
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
will
!
''
whispered
Natasha
,
but
did
not
finish
...
suddenly
*NL*
Sonya
pushed
away
the
glass
she
was
holding
and
covered
her
eyes
with
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Natasha
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
?
Did
you
?
What
was
it
?
''
exclaimed
Natasha
,
holding
up
the
*NL*
looking
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
had
not
seen
anything
,
she
was
just
wanting
to
blink
and
to
get
up
*NL*
when
she
heard
Natasha
say
,
``
Of
course
she
will
!
''
She
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
disappoint
either
Dunyasha
or
Natasha
,
but
it
was
hard
to
sit
still
.
She
*NL*
did
not
herself
know
how
or
why
the
exclamation
escaped
her
when
she
*NL*
covered
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
him
?
''
urged
Natasha
,
seizing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Wait
a
bit
...
I.
.
.
saw
him
,
''
Sonya
could
not
help
saying
,
not
yet
*NL*
knowing
whom
Natasha
meant
by
him
,
Nicholas
or
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
n't
I
say
I
saw
something
?
Others
do
see
!
Besides
who
can
*NL*
tell
whether
I
saw
anything
or
not
?
''
flashed
through
Sonya
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
Standing
or
lying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
saw
...
At
first
there
was
nothing
,
then
I
saw
him
lying
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
lying
?
Is
he
ill
?
''
asked
Natasha
,
her
frightened
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
on
the
contrary
,
on
the
contrary
!
His
face
was
cheerful
,
and
he
*NL*
turned
to
me
.
''
And
when
saying
this
she
herself
fancied
she
had
really
*NL*
seen
what
she
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
then
,
Sonya
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
that
,
I
could
not
make
out
what
there
was
;
something
blue
and
*NL*
red
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
When
will
he
come
back
?
When
shall
I
see
him
!
O
,
God
,
how
afraid
*NL*
I
am
for
him
and
for
myself
and
about
everything
!
...
''
Natasha
began
,
and
*NL*
without
replying
to
Sonya
's
words
of
comfort
she
got
into
bed
,
and
long
*NL*
after
her
candle
was
out
lay
open-eyed
and
motionless
,
gazing
at
the
*NL*
moonlight
through
the
frosty
windowpanes
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
Christmas
holidays
Nicholas
told
his
mother
of
his
love
*NL*
for
Sonya
and
of
his
firm
resolve
to
marry
her
.
The
countess
,
who
had
*NL*
long
noticed
what
was
going
on
between
them
and
was
expecting
this
*NL*
declaration
,
listened
to
him
in
silence
and
then
told
her
son
that
he
*NL*
might
marry
whom
he
pleased
,
but
that
neither
she
nor
his
father
would
*NL*
give
their
blessing
to
such
a
marriage
.
Nicholas
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
felt
that
his
mother
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
,
despite
her
love
*NL*
for
him
,
she
would
not
give
way
.
Coldly
,
without
looking
at
her
son
,
she
*NL*
sent
for
her
husband
and
,
when
he
came
,
tried
briefly
and
coldly
to
*NL*
inform
him
of
the
facts
,
in
her
son
's
presence
,
but
unable
to
restrain
*NL*
herself
she
burst
into
tears
of
vexation
and
left
the
room
.
The
old
*NL*
count
began
irresolutely
to
admonish
Nicholas
and
beg
him
to
abandon
his
*NL*
purpose
.
Nicholas
replied
that
he
could
not
go
back
on
his
word
,
and
his
*NL*
father
,
sighing
and
evidently
disconcerted
,
very
soon
became
silent
and
*NL*
went
in
to
the
countess
.
In
all
his
encounters
with
his
son
,
the
count
*NL*
was
always
conscious
of
his
own
guilt
toward
him
for
having
wasted
the
*NL*
family
fortune
,
and
so
he
could
not
be
angry
with
him
for
refusing
to
*NL*
marry
an
heiress
and
choosing
the
dowerless
Sonya
.
On
this
occasion
,
he
*NL*
was
only
more
vividly
conscious
of
the
fact
that
if
his
affairs
had
not
*NL*
been
in
disorder
,
no
better
wife
for
Nicholas
than
Sonya
could
have
been
*NL*
wished
for
,
and
that
no
one
but
himself
with
his
Mitenka
and
his
*NL*
uncomfortable
habits
was
to
blame
for
the
condition
of
the
family
*NL*
finances
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
and
mother
did
not
speak
of
the
matter
to
their
son
again
,
*NL*
but
a
few
days
later
the
countess
sent
for
Sonya
and
,
with
a
cruelty
*NL*
neither
of
them
expected
,
reproached
her
niece
for
trying
to
catch
*NL*
Nicholas
and
for
ingratitude
.
Sonya
listened
silently
with
downcast
eyes
*NL*
to
the
countess
'
cruel
words
,
without
understanding
what
was
required
of
*NL*
her
.
She
was
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
her
benefactors
.
Self
-
*NL*
sacrifice
was
her
most
cherished
idea
but
in
this
case
she
could
not
see
*NL*
what
she
ought
to
sacrifice
,
or
for
whom
.
She
could
not
help
loving
the
*NL*
countess
and
the
whole
Rostov
family
,
but
neither
could
she
help
loving
*NL*
Nicholas
and
knowing
that
his
happiness
depended
on
that
love
.
She
was
*NL*
silent
and
sad
and
did
not
reply
.
Nicholas
felt
the
situation
to
be
*NL*
intolerable
and
went
to
have
an
explanation
with
his
mother
.
He
first
*NL*
implored
her
to
forgive
him
and
Sonya
and
consent
to
their
marriage
,
*NL*
then
he
threatened
that
if
she
molested
Sonya
he
would
at
once
marry
her
*NL*
secretly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
with
a
coldness
her
son
had
never
seen
in
her
before
,
*NL*
replied
that
he
was
of
age
,
that
Prince
Andrew
was
marrying
without
his
*NL*
father
's
consent
,
and
he
could
do
the
same
,
but
that
she
would
never
*NL*
receive
that
intriguer
as
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exploding
at
the
word
intriguer
,
Nicholas
,
raising
his
voice
,
told
his
*NL*
mother
he
had
never
expected
her
to
try
to
force
him
to
sell
his
*NL*
feelings
,
but
if
that
were
so
,
he
would
say
for
the
last
time
...
But
he
*NL*
had
no
time
to
utter
the
decisive
word
which
the
expression
of
his
face
*NL*
caused
his
mother
to
await
with
terror
,
and
which
would
perhaps
have
*NL*
forever
remained
a
cruel
memory
to
them
both
.
He
had
not
time
to
say
it
,
*NL*
for
Natasha
,
with
a
pale
and
set
face
,
entered
the
room
from
the
door
at
*NL*
which
she
had
been
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
you
are
talking
nonsense
!
Be
quiet
,
be
quiet
,
be
quiet
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
!
...
''
she
almost
screamed
,
so
as
to
drown
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
darling
,
it
's
not
at
all
so
...
my
poor
,
sweet
darling
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
her
mother
,
who
conscious
that
they
had
been
on
the
brink
of
a
*NL*
rupture
gazed
at
her
son
with
terror
,
but
in
the
obstinacy
and
*NL*
excitement
of
the
conflict
could
not
and
would
not
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
I
'll
explain
to
you
.
Go
away
!
Listen
,
Mamma
darling
,
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
words
were
incoherent
,
but
they
attained
the
purpose
at
which
she
*NL*
was
aiming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
sobbing
heavily
,
hid
her
face
on
her
daughter
's
breast
,
*NL*
while
Nicholas
rose
,
clutching
his
head
,
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
set
to
work
to
effect
a
reconciliation
,
and
so
far
succeeded
*NL*
that
Nicholas
received
a
promise
from
his
mother
that
Sonya
should
not
*NL*
be
troubled
,
while
he
on
his
side
promised
not
to
undertake
anything
*NL*
without
his
parents
'
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Firmly
resolved
,
after
putting
his
affairs
in
order
in
the
regiment
,
to
*NL*
retire
from
the
army
and
return
and
marry
Sonya
,
Nicholas
,
serious
,
*NL*
sorrowful
,
and
at
variance
with
his
parents
,
but
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
*NL*
passionately
in
love
,
left
at
the
beginning
of
January
to
rejoin
his
*NL*
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Nicholas
had
gone
things
in
the
Rostov
household
were
more
*NL*
depressing
than
ever
,
and
the
countess
fell
ill
from
mental
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
unhappy
at
the
separation
from
Nicholas
and
still
more
so
on
*NL*
account
of
the
hostile
tone
the
countess
could
not
help
adopting
toward
*NL*
her
.
The
count
was
more
perturbed
than
ever
by
the
condition
of
his
*NL*
affairs
,
which
called
for
some
decisive
action
.
Their
town
house
and
*NL*
estate
near
Moscow
had
inevitably
to
be
sold
,
and
for
this
they
had
to
*NL*
go
to
Moscow
.
But
the
countess
'
health
obliged
them
to
delay
their
*NL*
departure
from
day
to
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
had
borne
the
first
period
of
separation
from
her
betrothed
*NL*
lightly
and
even
cheerfully
,
now
grew
more
agitated
and
impatient
every
*NL*
day
.
The
thought
that
her
best
days
,
which
she
would
have
employed
in
*NL*
loving
him
,
were
being
vainly
wasted
,
with
no
advantage
to
anyone
,
*NL*
tormented
her
incessantly
.
His
letters
for
the
most
part
irritated
her
.
*NL*
It
hurt
her
to
think
that
while
she
lived
only
in
the
thought
of
him
,
he
*NL*
was
living
a
real
life
,
seeing
new
places
and
new
people
that
interested
*NL*
him
.
The
more
interesting
his
letters
were
the
more
vexed
she
felt
.
Her
*NL*
letters
to
him
,
far
from
giving
her
any
comfort
,
seemed
to
her
a
*NL*
wearisome
and
artificial
obligation
.
She
could
not
write
,
because
she
*NL*
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
expressing
sincerely
in
a
letter
*NL*
even
a
thousandth
part
of
what
she
expressed
by
voice
,
smile
,
and
*NL*
glance
.
She
wrote
to
him
formal
,
monotonous
,
and
dry
letters
,
to
which
*NL*
she
attached
no
importance
herself
,
and
in
the
rough
copies
of
which
the
*NL*
countess
corrected
her
mistakes
in
spelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
no
improvement
in
the
countess
'
health
,
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
defer
the
journey
to
Moscow
any
longer
.
Natasha
's
*NL*
trousseau
had
to
be
ordered
and
the
house
sold
.
Moreover
,
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
was
expected
in
Moscow
,
where
old
Prince
Bolkonski
was
spending
the
*NL*
winter
,
and
Natasha
felt
sure
he
had
already
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
countess
remained
in
the
country
,
and
the
count
,
taking
Sonya
and
*NL*
Natasha
with
him
,
went
to
Moscow
at
the
end
of
January
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
After
Prince
Andrew
's
engagement
to
Natasha
,
Pierre
without
any
apparent
*NL*
cause
suddenly
felt
it
impossible
to
go
on
living
as
before
.
Firmly
*NL*
convinced
as
he
was
of
the
truths
revealed
to
him
by
his
benefactor
,
and
*NL*
happy
as
he
had
been
in
perfecting
his
inner
man
,
to
which
he
had
*NL*
devoted
himself
with
such
ardor
--
all
the
zest
of
such
a
life
vanished
*NL*
after
the
engagement
of
Andrew
and
Natasha
and
the
death
of
Joseph
*NL*
Alexeevich
,
the
news
of
which
reached
him
almost
at
the
same
time
.
Only
*NL*
the
skeleton
of
life
remained
:
his
house
,
a
brilliant
wife
who
now
*NL*
enjoyed
the
favors
of
a
very
important
personage
,
acquaintance
with
all
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
his
court
service
with
its
dull
formalities
.
And
this
*NL*
life
suddenly
seemed
to
Pierre
unexpectedly
loathsome
.
He
ceased
keeping
*NL*
a
diary
,
avoided
the
company
of
the
Brothers
,
began
going
to
the
club
*NL*
again
,
drank
a
great
deal
,
and
came
once
more
in
touch
with
the
bachelor
*NL*
sets
,
leading
such
a
life
that
the
Countess
Helene
thought
it
necessary
*NL*
to
speak
severely
to
him
about
it
.
Pierre
felt
that
she
was
right
,
and
*NL*
to
avoid
compromising
her
went
away
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Moscow
as
soon
as
he
entered
his
huge
house
in
which
the
faded
and
*NL*
fading
princesses
still
lived
,
with
its
enormous
retinue
;
as
soon
as
,
*NL*
driving
through
the
town
,
he
saw
the
Iberian
shrine
with
innumerable
*NL*
tapers
burning
before
the
golden
covers
of
the
icons
,
the
Kremlin
Square
*NL*
with
its
snow
undisturbed
by
vehicles
,
the
sleigh
drivers
and
hovels
of
*NL*
the
Sivtsev
Vrazhok
,
those
old
Moscovites
who
desired
nothing
,
hurried
*NL*
nowhere
,
and
were
ending
their
days
leisurely
;
when
he
saw
those
old
*NL*
Moscow
ladies
,
the
Moscow
balls
,
and
the
English
Club
,
he
felt
himself
*NL*
at
home
in
a
quiet
haven
.
In
Moscow
he
felt
at
peace
,
at
home
,
warm
and
*NL*
dirty
as
in
an
old
dressing
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moscow
society
,
from
the
old
women
down
to
the
children
,
received
Pierre
*NL*
like
a
long-expected
guest
whose
place
was
always
ready
awaiting
him
.
*NL*
For
Moscow
society
Pierre
was
the
nicest
,
kindest
,
most
intellectual
,
*NL*
merriest
,
and
most
magnanimous
of
cranks
,
a
heedless
,
genial
nobleman
of
*NL*
the
old
Russian
type
.
His
purse
was
always
empty
because
it
was
open
to
*NL*
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Benefit
performances
,
poor
pictures
,
statues
,
benevolent
societies
,
*NL*
gypsy
choirs
,
schools
,
subscription
dinners
,
sprees
,
Freemasons
,
*NL*
churches
,
and
books
--
no
one
and
nothing
met
with
a
refusal
from
him
,
and
*NL*
had
it
not
been
for
two
friends
who
had
borrowed
large
sums
from
him
and
*NL*
taken
him
under
their
protection
,
he
would
have
given
everything
away
.
*NL*
There
was
never
a
dinner
or
soiree
at
the
club
without
him
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
he
sank
into
his
place
on
the
sofa
after
two
bottles
of
Margaux
he
was
*NL*
surrounded
,
and
talking
,
disputing
,
and
joking
began
.
When
there
were
*NL*
quarrels
,
his
kindly
smile
and
well-timed
jests
reconciled
the
*NL*
antagonists
.
The
masonic
dinners
were
dull
and
dreary
when
he
was
not
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
after
a
bachelor
supper
he
rose
with
his
amiable
and
kindly
smile
,
*NL*
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
the
festive
company
to
drive
off
somewhere
*NL*
with
them
,
shouts
of
delight
and
triumph
arose
among
the
young
men
.
At
*NL*
balls
he
danced
if
a
partner
was
needed
.
Young
ladies
,
married
and
*NL*
unmarried
,
liked
him
because
without
making
love
to
any
of
them
,
he
was
*NL*
equally
amiable
to
all
,
especially
after
supper
.
``
Il
est
charmant
;
il
*NL*
n
'
a
pas
de
sexe
,
''
*
they
said
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
He
is
charming
;
he
has
no
sex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
one
of
those
retired
gentlemen-in-waiting
of
whom
there
were
*NL*
hundreds
good-humoredly
ending
their
days
in
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
horrified
he
would
have
been
seven
years
before
,
when
he
first
*NL*
arrived
from
abroad
,
had
he
been
told
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
*NL*
seek
or
plan
anything
,
that
his
rut
had
long
been
shaped
,
eternally
*NL*
predetermined
,
and
that
wriggle
as
he
might
,
he
would
be
what
all
in
his
*NL*
position
were
.
He
could
not
have
believed
it
!
Had
he
not
at
one
time
*NL*
longed
with
all
his
heart
to
establish
a
republic
in
Russia
;
then
*NL*
himself
to
be
a
Napoleon
;
then
to
be
a
philosopher
;
and
then
a
*NL*
strategist
and
the
conqueror
of
Napoleon
?
Had
he
not
seen
the
*NL*
possibility
of
,
and
passionately
desired
,
the
regeneration
of
the
sinful
*NL*
human
race
,
and
his
own
progress
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
?
*NL*
Had
he
not
established
schools
and
hospitals
and
liberated
his
serfs
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
instead
of
all
that
--
here
he
was
,
the
wealthy
husband
of
an
*NL*
unfaithful
wife
,
a
retired
gentleman-in-waiting
,
fond
of
eating
and
*NL*
drinking
and
,
as
he
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
,
of
abusing
the
government
*NL*
a
bit
,
a
member
of
the
Moscow
English
Club
,
and
a
universal
favorite
in
*NL*
Moscow
society
.
For
a
long
time
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
the
*NL*
idea
that
he
was
one
of
those
same
retired
Moscow
gentlemen-in-waiting
*NL*
he
had
so
despised
seven
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
only
living
*NL*
this
life
temporarily
;
but
then
he
was
shocked
by
the
thought
of
how
*NL*
many
,
like
himself
,
had
entered
that
life
and
that
club
temporarily
,
*NL*
with
all
their
teeth
and
hair
,
and
had
only
left
it
when
not
a
single
*NL*
tooth
or
hair
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
moments
of
pride
,
when
he
thought
of
his
position
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
he
was
quite
different
and
distinct
from
those
other
retired
*NL*
gentlemen-in-waiting
he
had
formerly
despised
:
they
were
empty
,
stupid
,
*NL*
contented
fellows
,
satisfied
with
their
position
,
``
while
I
am
still
*NL*
discontented
and
want
to
do
something
for
mankind
.
But
perhaps
all
these
*NL*
comrades
of
mine
struggled
just
like
me
and
sought
something
new
,
a
path
*NL*
in
life
of
their
own
,
and
like
me
were
brought
by
force
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
society
,
and
race
--
by
that
elemental
force
against
which
*NL*
man
is
powerless
--
to
the
condition
I
am
in
,
''
said
he
to
himself
in
*NL*
moments
of
humility
;
and
after
living
some
time
in
Moscow
he
no
longer
*NL*
despised
,
but
began
to
grow
fond
of
,
to
respect
,
and
to
pity
his
*NL*
comrades
in
destiny
,
as
he
pitied
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
no
longer
suffered
moments
of
despair
,
hypochondria
,
and
disgust
*NL*
with
life
,
but
the
malady
that
had
formerly
found
expression
in
such
*NL*
acute
attacks
was
driven
inwards
and
never
left
him
for
a
moment
.
``
What
*NL*
for
?
Why
?
What
is
going
on
in
the
world
?
''
he
would
ask
himself
in
*NL*
perplexity
several
times
a
day
,
involuntarily
beginning
to
reflect
anew
*NL*
on
the
meaning
of
the
phenomena
of
life
;
but
knowing
by
experience
that
*NL*
there
were
no
answers
to
these
questions
he
made
haste
to
turn
away
from
*NL*
them
,
and
took
up
a
book
,
or
hurried
off
to
the
club
or
to
Apollon
*NL*
Nikolaevich
's
,
to
exchange
the
gossip
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helene
,
who
has
never
cared
for
anything
but
her
own
body
and
is
one
of
*NL*
the
stupidest
women
in
the
world
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
``
is
regarded
by
*NL*
people
as
the
acme
of
intelligence
and
refinement
,
and
they
pay
homage
*NL*
to
her
.
Napoleon
Bonaparte
was
despised
by
all
as
long
as
he
was
great
,
*NL*
but
now
that
he
has
become
a
wretched
comedian
the
Emperor
Francis
wants
*NL*
to
offer
him
his
daughter
in
an
illegal
marriage
.
The
Spaniards
,
through
*NL*
the
Catholic
clergy
,
offer
praise
to
God
for
their
victory
over
the
*NL*
French
on
the
fourteenth
of
June
,
and
the
French
,
also
through
the
*NL*
Catholic
clergy
,
offer
praise
because
on
that
same
fourteenth
of
June
*NL*
they
defeated
the
Spaniards
.
My
brother
Masons
swear
by
the
blood
that
*NL*
they
are
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
their
neighbor
,
but
they
do
*NL*
not
give
a
ruble
each
to
the
collections
for
the
poor
,
and
they
*NL*
intrigue
,
the
Astraea
Lodge
against
the
Manna
Seekers
,
and
fuss
about
an
*NL*
authentic
Scotch
carpet
and
a
charter
that
nobody
needs
,
and
the
meaning
*NL*
of
which
the
very
man
who
wrote
it
does
not
understand
.
We
all
profess
*NL*
the
Christian
law
of
forgiveness
of
injuries
and
love
of
our
neighbors
,
*NL*
the
law
in
honor
of
which
we
have
built
in
Moscow
forty
times
forty
*NL*
churches
--
but
yesterday
a
deserter
was
knouted
to
death
and
a
minister
*NL*
of
that
same
law
of
love
and
forgiveness
,
a
priest
,
gave
the
soldier
a
*NL*
cross
to
kiss
before
his
execution
.
''
So
thought
Pierre
,
and
the
whole
of
*NL*
this
general
deception
which
everyone
accepts
,
accustomed
as
he
was
to
*NL*
it
,
astonished
him
each
time
as
if
it
were
something
new
.
``
I
understand
*NL*
the
deception
and
confusion
,
''
he
thought
,
``
but
how
am
I
to
tell
them
all
*NL*
that
I
see
?
I
have
tried
,
and
have
always
found
that
they
too
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
their
souls
understand
it
as
I
do
,
and
only
try
not
to
see
it
.
*NL*
So
it
appears
that
it
must
be
so
!
But
I
--
what
is
to
become
of
me
?
''
*NL*
thought
he
.
He
had
the
unfortunate
capacity
many
men
,
especially
*NL*
Russians
,
have
of
seeing
and
believing
in
the
possibility
of
goodness
*NL*
and
truth
,
but
of
seeing
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
life
too
clearly
to
*NL*
be
able
to
take
a
serious
part
in
it
.
Every
sphere
of
work
was
*NL*
connected
,
in
his
eyes
,
with
evil
and
deception
.
Whatever
he
tried
to
*NL*
be
,
whatever
he
engaged
in
,
the
evil
and
falsehood
of
it
repulsed
him
*NL*
and
blocked
every
path
of
activity
.
Yet
he
had
to
live
and
to
find
*NL*
occupation
.
It
was
too
dreadful
to
be
under
the
burden
of
these
*NL*
insoluble
problems
,
so
he
abandoned
himself
to
any
distraction
in
order
*NL*
to
forget
them
.
He
frequented
every
kind
of
society
,
drank
much
,
bought
*NL*
pictures
,
engaged
in
building
,
and
above
all
--
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
,
and
read
everything
that
came
to
hand
.
On
coming
home
,
while
*NL*
his
valets
were
still
taking
off
his
things
,
he
picked
up
a
book
and
*NL*
began
to
read
.
From
reading
he
passed
to
sleeping
,
from
sleeping
to
*NL*
gossip
in
drawing
rooms
of
the
club
,
from
gossip
to
carousals
and
women
;
*NL*
from
carousals
back
to
gossip
,
reading
,
and
wine
.
Drinking
became
more
*NL*
and
more
a
physical
and
also
a
moral
necessity
.
Though
the
doctors
*NL*
warned
him
that
with
his
corpulence
wine
was
dangerous
for
him
,
he
drank
*NL*
a
great
deal
.
He
was
only
quite
at
ease
when
having
poured
several
*NL*
glasses
of
wine
mechanically
into
his
large
mouth
he
felt
a
pleasant
*NL*
warmth
in
his
body
,
an
amiability
toward
all
his
fellows
,
and
a
*NL*
readiness
to
respond
superficially
to
every
idea
without
probing
it
*NL*
deeply
.
Only
after
emptying
a
bottle
or
two
did
he
feel
dimly
that
the
*NL*
terribly
tangled
skein
of
life
which
previously
had
terrified
him
was
*NL*
not
as
dreadful
as
he
had
thought
.
He
was
always
conscious
of
some
*NL*
aspect
of
that
skein
,
as
with
a
buzzing
in
his
head
after
dinner
or
*NL*
supper
he
chatted
or
listened
to
conversation
or
read
.
But
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
wine
he
said
to
himself
:
``
It
does
n't
matter
.
I
'll
get
it
*NL*
unraveled
.
I
have
a
solution
ready
,
but
have
no
time
now
--
I
'll
think
it
*NL*
all
out
later
on
!
''
But
the
later
on
never
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
on
an
empty
stomach
,
all
the
old
questions
appeared
as
*NL*
insoluble
and
terrible
as
ever
,
and
Pierre
hastily
picked
up
a
book
,
and
*NL*
if
anyone
came
to
see
him
he
was
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
remembered
how
he
had
heard
that
soldiers
in
war
when
*NL*
entrenched
under
the
enemy
's
fire
,
if
they
have
nothing
to
do
,
try
hard
*NL*
to
find
some
occupation
the
more
easily
to
bear
the
danger
.
To
Pierre
*NL*
all
men
seemed
like
those
soldiers
,
seeking
refuge
from
life
:
some
in
*NL*
ambition
,
some
in
cards
,
some
in
framing
laws
,
some
in
women
,
some
in
*NL*
toys
,
some
in
horses
,
some
in
politics
,
some
in
sport
,
some
in
wine
,
and
*NL*
some
in
governmental
affairs
.
``
Nothing
is
trivial
,
and
nothing
is
*NL*
important
,
it
's
all
the
same
--
only
to
save
oneself
from
it
as
best
one
*NL*
can
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
Only
not
to
see
it
,
that
dreadful
it
!

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
winter
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
and
his
daughter
*NL*
moved
to
Moscow
.
At
that
time
enthusiasm
for
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
*NL*
regime
had
weakened
and
a
patriotic
and
anti-French
tendency
prevailed
*NL*
there
,
and
this
,
together
with
his
past
and
his
intellect
and
his
*NL*
originality
,
at
once
made
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
an
object
of
*NL*
particular
respect
to
the
Moscovites
and
the
center
of
the
Moscow
*NL*
opposition
to
the
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
aged
very
much
that
year
.
He
showed
marked
signs
of
*NL*
senility
by
a
tendency
to
fall
asleep
,
forgetfulness
of
quite
recent
*NL*
events
,
remembrance
of
remote
ones
,
and
the
childish
vanity
with
which
*NL*
he
accepted
the
role
of
head
of
the
Moscow
opposition
.
In
spite
of
this
*NL*
the
old
man
inspired
in
all
his
visitors
alike
a
feeling
of
respectful
*NL*
veneration
--
especially
of
an
evening
when
he
came
in
to
tea
in
his
old
-
*NL*
fashioned
coat
and
powdered
wig
and
,
aroused
by
anyone
,
told
his
abrupt
*NL*
stories
of
the
past
,
or
uttered
yet
more
abrupt
and
scathing
criticisms
*NL*
of
the
present
.
For
them
all
,
that
old-fashioned
house
with
its
gigantic
*NL*
mirrors
,
pre-Revolution
furniture
,
powdered
footmen
,
and
the
stern
*NL*
shrewd
old
man
-LRB-
himself
a
relic
of
the
past
century
-RRB-
with
his
gentle
*NL*
daughter
and
the
pretty
Frenchwoman
who
were
reverently
devoted
to
him
*NL*
presented
a
majestic
and
agreeable
spectacle
.
But
the
visitors
did
not
*NL*
reflect
that
besides
the
couple
of
hours
during
which
they
saw
their
*NL*
host
,
there
were
also
twenty-two
hours
in
the
day
during
which
the
*NL*
private
and
intimate
life
of
the
house
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Latterly
that
private
life
had
become
very
trying
for
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
There
in
Moscow
she
was
deprived
of
her
greatest
pleasures
--
talks
with
*NL*
the
pilgrims
and
the
solitude
which
refreshed
her
at
Bald
Hills
--
and
she
*NL*
had
none
of
the
advantages
and
pleasures
of
city
life
.
She
did
not
go
*NL*
out
into
society
;
everyone
knew
that
her
father
would
not
let
her
go
*NL*
anywhere
without
him
,
and
his
failing
health
prevented
his
going
out
*NL*
himself
,
so
that
she
was
not
invited
to
dinners
and
evening
parties
.
She
*NL*
had
quite
abandoned
the
hope
of
getting
married
.
She
saw
the
coldness
*NL*
and
malevolence
with
which
the
old
prince
received
and
dismissed
the
*NL*
young
men
,
possible
suitors
,
who
sometimes
appeared
at
their
house
.
She
*NL*
had
no
friends
:
during
this
visit
to
Moscow
she
had
been
disappointed
in
*NL*
the
two
who
had
been
nearest
to
her
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
with
whom
*NL*
she
had
never
been
able
to
be
quite
frank
,
had
now
become
unpleasant
to
*NL*
her
,
and
for
various
reasons
Princess
Mary
avoided
her
.
Julie
,
with
whom
*NL*
she
had
corresponded
for
the
last
five
years
,
was
in
Moscow
,
but
proved
*NL*
to
be
quite
alien
to
her
when
they
met
.
Just
then
Julie
,
who
by
the
*NL*
death
of
her
brothers
had
become
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
was
in
the
full
whirl
of
society
pleasures
.
She
was
surrounded
by
young
*NL*
men
who
,
she
fancied
,
had
suddenly
learned
to
appreciate
her
worth
.
*NL*
Julie
was
at
that
stage
in
the
life
of
a
society
woman
when
she
feels
*NL*
that
her
last
chance
of
marrying
has
come
and
that
her
fate
must
be
*NL*
decided
now
or
never
.
On
Thursdays
Princess
Mary
remembered
with
a
*NL*
mournful
smile
that
she
now
had
no
one
to
write
to
,
since
Julie
--
whose
*NL*
presence
gave
her
no
pleasure
was
here
and
they
met
every
week
.
Like
the
*NL*
old
emigre
who
declined
to
marry
the
lady
with
whom
he
had
spent
his
*NL*
evenings
for
years
,
she
regretted
Julie
's
presence
and
having
no
one
to
*NL*
write
to
.
In
Moscow
Princess
Mary
had
no
one
to
talk
to
,
no
one
to
whom
*NL*
to
confide
her
sorrow
,
and
much
sorrow
fell
to
her
lot
just
then
.
The
*NL*
time
for
Prince
Andrew
's
return
and
marriage
was
approaching
,
but
his
*NL*
request
to
her
to
prepare
his
father
for
it
had
not
been
carried
out
;
in
*NL*
fact
,
it
seemed
as
if
matters
were
quite
hopeless
,
for
at
every
mention
*NL*
of
the
young
Countess
Rostova
the
old
prince
-LRB-
who
apart
from
that
was
*NL*
usually
in
a
bad
temper
-RRB-
lost
control
of
himself
.
Another
lately
added
*NL*
sorrow
arose
from
the
lessons
she
gave
her
six
year-old
nephew
.
To
her
*NL*
consternation
she
detected
in
herself
in
relation
to
little
Nicholas
*NL*
some
symptoms
of
her
father
's
irritability
.
However
often
she
told
*NL*
herself
that
she
must
not
get
irritable
when
teaching
her
nephew
,
almost
*NL*
every
time
that
,
pointer
in
hand
,
she
sat
down
to
show
him
the
French
*NL*
alphabet
,
she
so
longed
to
pour
her
own
knowledge
quickly
and
easily
*NL*
into
the
child
--
who
was
already
afraid
that
Auntie
might
at
any
moment
*NL*
get
angry
--
that
at
his
slightest
inattention
she
trembled
,
became
*NL*
flustered
and
heated
,
raised
her
voice
,
and
sometimes
pulled
him
by
the
*NL*
arm
and
put
him
in
the
corner
.
Having
put
him
in
the
corner
she
would
*NL*
herself
begin
to
cry
over
her
cruel
,
evil
nature
,
and
little
Nicholas
,
*NL*
following
her
example
,
would
sob
,
and
without
permission
would
leave
his
*NL*
corner
,
come
to
her
,
pull
her
wet
hands
from
her
face
,
and
comfort
her
.
*NL*
But
what
distressed
the
princess
most
of
all
was
her
father
's
*NL*
irritability
,
which
was
always
directed
against
her
and
had
of
late
*NL*
amounted
to
cruelty
.
Had
he
forced
her
to
prostrate
herself
to
the
*NL*
ground
all
night
,
had
he
beaten
her
or
made
her
fetch
wood
or
water
,
it
*NL*
would
never
have
entered
her
mind
to
think
her
position
hard
;
but
this
*NL*
loving
despot
--
the
more
cruel
because
he
loved
her
and
for
that
reason
*NL*
tormented
himself
and
her
--
knew
how
not
merely
to
hurt
and
humiliate
her
*NL*
deliberately
,
but
to
show
her
that
she
was
always
to
blame
for
*NL*
everything
.
Of
late
he
had
exhibited
a
new
trait
that
tormented
Princess
*NL*
Mary
more
than
anything
else
;
this
was
his
ever-increasing
intimacy
with
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
The
idea
that
at
the
first
moment
of
receiving
*NL*
the
news
of
his
son
's
intentions
had
occurred
to
him
in
jest
--
that
if
*NL*
Andrew
got
married
he
himself
would
marry
Bourienne
--
had
evidently
*NL*
pleased
him
,
and
latterly
he
had
persistently
,
and
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Princess
Mary
merely
to
offend
her
,
shown
special
endearments
to
the
*NL*
companion
and
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
with
his
daughter
by
*NL*
demonstrations
of
love
of
Bourienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
Moscow
in
Princess
Mary
's
presence
-LRB-
she
thought
her
father
*NL*
did
it
purposely
when
she
was
there
-RRB-
the
old
prince
kissed
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
's
hand
and
,
drawing
her
to
him
,
embraced
her
affectionately
.
*NL*
Princess
Mary
flushed
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
A
few
minutes
later
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
came
into
Princess
Mary
's
room
smiling
and
making
*NL*
cheerful
remarks
in
her
agreeable
voice
.
Princess
Mary
hastily
wiped
*NL*
away
her
tears
,
went
resolutely
up
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
and
*NL*
evidently
unconscious
of
what
she
was
doing
began
shouting
in
angry
*NL*
haste
at
the
Frenchwoman
,
her
voice
breaking
:
``
It
's
horrible
,
vile
,
*NL*
inhuman
,
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
...
''
She
did
not
finish
.
*NL*
``
Leave
my
room
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
and
burst
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
prince
did
not
say
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
but
she
noticed
*NL*
that
at
dinner
he
gave
orders
that
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
should
be
*NL*
served
first
.
After
dinner
,
when
the
footman
handed
coffee
and
from
*NL*
habit
began
with
the
princess
,
the
prince
suddenly
grew
furious
,
threw
*NL*
his
stick
at
Philip
,
and
instantly
gave
instructions
to
have
him
*NL*
conscripted
for
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
obey
...
I
said
it
twice
...
and
he
does
n't
obey
!
She
is
the
*NL*
first
person
in
this
house
;
she
's
my
best
friend
,
''
cried
the
prince
.
*NL*
``
And
if
you
allow
yourself
,
''
he
screamed
in
a
fury
,
addressing
Princess
*NL*
Mary
for
the
first
time
,
``
to
forget
yourself
again
before
her
as
you
*NL*
dared
to
do
yesterday
,
I
will
show
you
who
is
master
in
this
house
.
Go
!
*NL*
Do
n't
let
me
set
eyes
on
you
;
beg
her
pardon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
asked
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
pardon
,
and
also
her
*NL*
father
's
pardon
for
herself
and
for
Philip
the
footman
,
who
had
begged
*NL*
for
her
intervention
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
such
moments
something
like
a
pride
of
sacrifice
gathered
in
her
*NL*
soul
.
And
suddenly
that
father
whom
she
had
judged
would
look
for
his
*NL*
spectacles
in
her
presence
,
fumbling
near
them
and
not
seeing
them
,
or
*NL*
would
forget
something
that
had
just
occurred
,
or
take
a
false
step
with
*NL*
his
failing
legs
and
turn
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
his
feebleness
,
*NL*
or
,
worst
of
all
,
at
dinner
when
there
were
no
visitors
to
excite
him
*NL*
would
suddenly
fall
asleep
,
letting
his
napkin
drop
and
his
shaking
head
*NL*
sink
over
his
plate
.
``
He
is
old
and
feeble
,
and
I
dare
to
condemn
him
!
''
*NL*
she
thought
at
such
moments
,
with
a
feeling
of
revulsion
against
*NL*
herself
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
In
1811
there
was
living
in
Moscow
a
French
doctor
--
Metivier
--
who
had
*NL*
rapidly
become
the
fashion
.
He
was
enormously
tall
,
handsome
,
amiable
as
*NL*
Frenchmen
are
,
and
was
,
as
all
Moscow
said
,
an
extraordinarily
clever
*NL*
doctor
.
He
was
received
in
the
best
houses
not
merely
as
a
doctor
,
but
*NL*
as
an
equal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Nicholas
had
always
ridiculed
medicine
,
but
latterly
on
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
advice
had
allowed
this
doctor
to
visit
him
and
*NL*
had
grown
accustomed
to
him
.
Metivier
came
to
see
the
prince
about
twice
*NL*
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
December
6
--
St.
Nicholas
'
Day
and
the
prince
's
name
day
--
all
Moscow
*NL*
came
to
the
prince
's
front
door
but
he
gave
orders
to
admit
no
one
and
*NL*
to
invite
to
dinner
only
a
small
number
,
a
list
of
whom
he
gave
to
*NL*
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Metivier
,
who
came
in
the
morning
with
his
felicitations
,
considered
it
*NL*
proper
in
his
quality
of
doctor
de
forcer
la
consigne
,
*
as
he
told
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
and
went
in
to
see
the
prince
.
It
happened
that
on
that
*NL*
morning
of
his
name
day
the
prince
was
in
one
of
his
worst
moods
.
He
had
*NL*
been
going
about
the
house
all
the
morning
finding
fault
with
everyone
*NL*
and
pretending
not
to
understand
what
was
said
to
him
and
not
to
be
*NL*
understood
himself
.
Princess
Mary
well
knew
this
mood
of
quiet
absorbed
*NL*
querulousness
,
which
generally
culminated
in
a
burst
of
rage
,
and
she
*NL*
went
about
all
that
morning
as
though
facing
a
cocked
and
loaded
gun
and
*NL*
awaited
the
inevitable
explosion
.
Until
the
doctor
's
arrival
the
morning
*NL*
had
passed
off
safely
.
After
admitting
the
doctor
,
Princess
Mary
sat
*NL*
down
with
a
book
in
the
drawing
room
near
the
door
through
which
she
*NL*
could
hear
all
that
passed
in
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
force
the
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
she
heard
only
Metivier
's
voice
,
then
her
father
's
,
then
both
*NL*
voices
began
speaking
at
the
same
time
,
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
on
*NL*
the
threshold
appeared
the
handsome
figure
of
the
terrified
Metivier
*NL*
with
his
shock
of
black
hair
,
and
the
prince
in
his
dressing
gown
and
*NL*
fez
,
his
face
distorted
with
fury
and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
rolled
*NL*
downwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
understand
?
''
shouted
the
prince
,
``
but
I
do
!
French
spy
,
slave
*NL*
of
Buonaparte
,
spy
,
get
out
of
my
house
!
Be
off
,
I
tell
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Metivier
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
went
up
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
who
*NL*
at
the
sound
of
shouting
had
run
in
from
an
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
is
not
very
well
:
bile
and
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
.
Keep
*NL*
calm
,
I
will
call
again
tomorrow
,
''
said
Metivier
;
and
putting
his
*NL*
fingers
to
his
lips
he
hastened
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
study
door
came
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
and
the
cry
:
*NL*
``
Spies
,
traitors
,
traitors
everywhere
!
Not
a
moment
's
peace
in
my
own
*NL*
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
Metivier
's
departure
the
old
prince
called
his
daughter
in
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
weight
of
his
wrath
fell
on
her
.
She
was
to
blame
that
a
spy
*NL*
had
been
admitted
.
Had
he
not
told
her
,
yes
,
told
her
to
make
a
list
,
*NL*
and
not
to
admit
anyone
who
was
not
on
that
list
?
Then
why
was
that
*NL*
scoundrel
admitted
?
She
was
the
cause
of
it
all
.
With
her
,
he
said
,
he
*NL*
could
not
have
a
moment
's
peace
and
could
not
die
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
!
We
must
part
,
we
must
part
!
Understand
that
,
understand
it
!
*NL*
I
can
not
endure
any
more
,
''
he
said
,
and
left
the
room
.
Then
,
as
if
*NL*
afraid
she
might
find
some
means
of
consolation
,
he
returned
and
trying
*NL*
to
appear
calm
added
:
``
And
do
n't
imagine
I
have
said
this
in
a
moment
of
*NL*
anger
.
I
am
calm
.
I
have
thought
it
over
,
and
it
will
be
carried
out
--
we
*NL*
must
part
;
so
find
some
place
for
yourself
...
''
But
he
could
not
*NL*
restrain
himself
and
with
the
virulence
of
which
only
one
who
loves
is
*NL*
capable
,
evidently
suffering
himself
,
he
shook
his
fists
at
her
and
*NL*
screamed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
some
fool
would
marry
her
!
''
Then
he
slammed
the
door
,
sent
for
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
and
subsided
into
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
the
six
chosen
guests
assembled
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
guests
--
the
famous
Count
Rostopchin
,
Prince
Lopukhin
with
his
*NL*
nephew
,
General
Chatrov
an
old
war
comrade
of
the
prince
's
,
and
of
the
*NL*
younger
generation
Pierre
and
Boris
Drubetskoy
--
awaited
the
prince
in
*NL*
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
,
who
had
come
to
Moscow
on
leave
a
few
days
before
,
had
been
*NL*
anxious
to
be
presented
to
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
,
and
had
contrived
*NL*
to
ingratiate
himself
so
well
that
the
old
prince
in
his
case
made
an
*NL*
exception
to
the
rule
of
not
receiving
bachelors
in
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
's
house
did
not
belong
to
what
is
known
as
fashionable
*NL*
society
,
but
his
little
circle
--
though
not
much
talked
about
in
town
--
*NL*
was
one
it
was
more
flattering
to
be
received
in
than
any
other
.
Boris
*NL*
had
realized
this
the
week
before
when
the
commander-in-chief
in
his
*NL*
presence
invited
Rostopchin
to
dinner
on
St.
Nicholas
'
Day
,
and
*NL*
Rostopchin
had
replied
that
he
could
not
come
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
day
I
always
go
to
pay
my
devotions
to
the
relics
of
Prince
*NL*
Nicholas
Bolkonski
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
replied
the
commander-in-chief
.
``
How
is
he
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
group
that
assembled
before
dinner
in
the
lofty
old-fashioned
*NL*
drawing
room
with
its
old
furniture
resembled
the
solemn
gathering
of
a
*NL*
court
of
justice
.
All
were
silent
or
talked
in
low
tones
.
Prince
*NL*
Nicholas
came
in
serious
and
taciturn
.
Princess
Mary
seemed
even
quieter
*NL*
and
more
diffident
than
usual
.
The
guests
were
reluctant
to
address
her
,
*NL*
feeling
that
she
was
in
no
mood
for
their
conversation
.
Count
Rostopchin
*NL*
alone
kept
the
conversation
going
,
now
relating
the
latest
town
news
,
*NL*
and
now
the
latest
political
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lopukhin
and
the
old
general
occasionally
took
part
in
the
conversation
.
*NL*
Prince
Bolkonski
listened
as
a
presiding
judge
receives
a
report
,
only
*NL*
now
and
then
,
silently
or
by
a
brief
word
,
showing
that
he
took
heed
of
*NL*
what
was
being
reported
to
him
.
The
tone
of
the
conversation
was
such
as
*NL*
indicated
that
no
one
approved
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
political
*NL*
world
.
Incidents
were
related
evidently
confirming
the
opinion
that
*NL*
everything
was
going
from
bad
to
worse
,
but
whether
telling
a
story
or
*NL*
giving
an
opinion
the
speaker
always
stopped
,
or
was
stopped
,
at
the
*NL*
point
beyond
which
his
criticism
might
touch
the
sovereign
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
latest
political
news
:
Napoleon
's
*NL*
seizure
of
the
Duke
of
Oldenburg
's
territory
,
and
the
Russian
Note
,
*NL*
hostile
to
Napoleon
,
which
had
been
sent
to
all
the
European
courts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bonaparte
treats
Europe
as
a
pirate
does
a
captured
vessel
,
''
said
Count
*NL*
Rostopchin
,
repeating
a
phrase
he
had
uttered
several
times
before
.
``
One
*NL*
only
wonders
at
the
long-suffering
or
blindness
of
the
crowned
heads
.
*NL*
Now
the
Pope
's
turn
has
come
and
Bonaparte
does
n't
scruple
to
depose
the
*NL*
head
of
the
Catholic
Church
--
yet
all
keep
silent
!
Our
sovereign
alone
*NL*
has
protested
against
the
seizure
of
the
Duke
of
Oldenburg
's
territory
,
*NL*
and
even
...
''
Count
Rostopchin
paused
,
feeling
that
he
had
reached
the
*NL*
limit
beyond
which
censure
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
territories
have
been
offered
in
exchange
for
the
Duchy
of
*NL*
Oldenburg
,
''
said
Prince
Bolkonski
.
``
He
shifts
the
Dukes
about
as
I
might
*NL*
move
my
serfs
from
Bald
Hills
to
Bogucharovo
or
my
Ryazan
estates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Duke
of
Oldenburg
bears
his
misfortunes
with
admirable
strength
of
*NL*
character
and
resignation
,
''
remarked
Boris
,
joining
in
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
because
on
his
journey
from
Petersburg
he
had
had
the
honor
*NL*
of
being
presented
to
the
Duke
.
Prince
Bolkonski
glanced
at
the
young
*NL*
man
as
if
about
to
say
something
in
reply
,
but
changed
his
mind
,
*NL*
evidently
considering
him
too
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
read
our
protests
about
the
Oldenburg
affair
and
was
surprised
*NL*
how
badly
the
Note
was
worded
,
''
remarked
Count
Rostopchin
in
the
casual
*NL*
tone
of
a
man
dealing
with
a
subject
quite
familiar
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
Rostopchin
with
naive
astonishment
,
not
understanding
*NL*
why
he
should
be
disturbed
by
the
bad
composition
of
the
Note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
matter
,
Count
,
how
the
Note
is
worded
,
''
he
asked
,
``
so
long
as
*NL*
its
substance
is
forcible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
with
our
five
hundred
thousand
troops
it
should
be
easy
*NL*
to
have
a
good
style
,
''
returned
Count
Rostopchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
now
understood
the
count
's
dissatisfaction
with
the
wording
of
*NL*
the
Note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
have
thought
quill
drivers
enough
had
sprung
up
,
''
remarked
*NL*
the
old
prince
.
``
There
in
Petersburg
they
are
always
writing
--
not
notes
*NL*
only
but
even
new
laws
.
My
Andrew
there
has
written
a
whole
volume
of
*NL*
laws
for
Russia
.
Nowadays
they
are
always
writing
!
''
and
he
laughed
*NL*
unnaturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
momentary
pause
in
the
conversation
;
the
old
general
cleared
*NL*
his
throat
to
draw
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
of
the
last
event
at
the
review
in
Petersburg
?
The
figure
*NL*
cut
by
the
new
French
ambassador
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Yes
,
I
heard
something
:
he
said
something
awkward
in
His
Majesty
's
*NL*
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
Majesty
drew
attention
to
the
Grenadier
division
and
to
the
march
*NL*
past
,
''
continued
the
general
,
``
and
it
seems
the
ambassador
took
no
*NL*
notice
and
allowed
himself
to
reply
that
:
`
We
in
France
pay
no
attention
*NL*
to
such
trifles
!
'
The
Emperor
did
not
condescend
to
reply
.
At
the
next
*NL*
review
,
they
say
,
the
Emperor
did
not
once
deign
to
address
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
.
On
this
fact
relating
to
the
Emperor
personally
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
pass
any
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impudent
fellows
!
''
said
the
prince
.
``
You
know
Metivier
?
I
turned
him
*NL*
out
of
my
house
this
morning
.
He
was
here
;
they
admitted
him
in
spite
of
*NL*
my
request
that
they
should
let
no
one
in
,
''
he
went
on
,
glancing
angrily
*NL*
at
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
narrated
his
whole
conversation
with
the
French
doctor
and
the
*NL*
reasons
that
convinced
him
that
Metivier
was
a
spy
.
Though
these
reasons
*NL*
were
very
insufficient
and
obscure
,
no
one
made
any
rejoinder
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
roast
,
champagne
was
served
.
The
guests
rose
to
congratulate
*NL*
the
old
prince
.
Princess
Mary
,
too
,
went
round
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
a
cold
,
angry
look
and
offered
her
his
wrinkled
,
clean
-
*NL*
shaven
cheek
to
kiss
.
The
whole
expression
of
his
face
told
her
that
he
*NL*
had
not
forgotten
the
morning
's
talk
,
that
his
decision
remained
in
*NL*
force
,
and
only
the
presence
of
visitors
hindered
his
speaking
of
it
to
*NL*
her
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
into
the
drawing
room
where
coffee
was
served
,
the
old
*NL*
men
sat
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Nicholas
grew
more
animated
and
expressed
his
views
on
the
*NL*
impending
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
that
our
wars
with
Bonaparte
would
be
disastrous
so
long
as
we
*NL*
sought
alliances
with
the
Germans
and
thrust
ourselves
into
European
*NL*
affairs
,
into
which
we
had
been
drawn
by
the
Peace
of
Tilsit
.
``
We
ought
*NL*
not
to
fight
either
for
or
against
Austria
.
Our
political
interests
are
*NL*
all
in
the
East
,
and
in
regard
to
Bonaparte
the
only
thing
is
to
have
an
*NL*
armed
frontier
and
a
firm
policy
,
and
he
will
never
dare
to
cross
the
*NL*
Russian
frontier
,
as
was
the
case
in
1807
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
we
fight
the
French
,
Prince
?
''
said
Count
Rostopchin
.
``
Can
we
*NL*
arm
ourselves
against
our
teachers
and
divinities
?
Look
at
our
youths
,
*NL*
look
at
our
ladies
!
The
French
are
our
Gods
:
Paris
is
our
Kingdom
of
*NL*
Heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
speaking
louder
,
evidently
to
be
heard
by
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
French
dresses
,
French
ideas
,
French
feelings
!
There
now
,
you
turned
*NL*
Metivier
out
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
because
he
is
a
Frenchman
and
a
*NL*
scoundrel
,
but
our
ladies
crawl
after
him
on
their
knees
.
I
went
to
a
*NL*
party
last
night
,
and
there
out
of
five
ladies
three
were
Roman
*NL*
Catholics
and
had
the
Pope
's
indulgence
for
doing
woolwork
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
And
they
themselves
sit
there
nearly
naked
,
like
the
signboards
at
our
*NL*
Public
Baths
if
I
may
say
so
.
Ah
,
when
one
looks
at
our
young
people
,
*NL*
Prince
,
one
would
like
to
take
Peter
the
Great
's
old
cudgel
out
of
the
*NL*
museum
and
belabor
them
in
the
Russian
way
till
all
the
nonsense
jumps
*NL*
out
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
.
The
old
prince
looked
at
Rostopchin
with
a
smile
and
*NL*
wagged
his
head
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
,
your
excellency
,
keep
well
!
''
said
Rostopchin
,
getting
up
*NL*
with
characteristic
briskness
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
dear
fellow
...
His
words
are
music
,
I
never
tire
of
*NL*
hearing
him
!
''
said
the
old
prince
,
keeping
hold
of
the
hand
and
offering
*NL*
his
cheek
to
be
kissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
Rostopchin
's
example

others

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
as
she
sat
listening
to
the
old
men
's
talk
and
*NL*
faultfinding
,
understood
nothing
of
what
she
heard
;
she
only
wondered
*NL*
whether
the
guests
had
all
observed
her
father
's
hostile
attitude
toward
*NL*
her
.
She
did
not
even
notice
the
special
attentions
and
amiabilities
*NL*
shown
her
during
dinner
by
Boris
Drubetskoy
,
who
was
visiting
them
for
*NL*
the
third
time
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
turned
with
absent-minded
questioning
look
to
Pierre
,
who
*NL*
hat
in
hand
and
with
a
smile
on
his
face
was
the
last
of
the
guests
to
*NL*
approach
her
after
the
old
prince
had
gone
out
and
they
were
left
alone
*NL*
in
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
stay
a
little
longer
?
''
he
said
,
letting
his
stout
body
sink
into
*NL*
an
armchair
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
she
answered
.
``
You
noticed
nothing
?
''
her
look
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
in
an
agreeable
after-dinner
mood
.
He
looked
straight
before
*NL*
him
and
smiled
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
known
that
young
man
long
,
Princess
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drubetskoy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
long
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
an
agreeable
young
man
...
Why
do
you
ask
me
that
?
''
said
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
still
thinking
of
that
morning
's
conversation
with
her
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
noticed
that
when
a
young
man
comes
on
leave
from
*NL*
Petersburg
to
Moscow
it
is
usually
with
the
object
of
marrying
an
*NL*
heiress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
observed
that
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Pierre
with
a
smile
,
``
and
this
young
man
now
manages
*NL*
matters
so
that
where
there
is
a
wealthy
heiress
there
he
is
too
.
I
can
*NL*
read
him
like
a
book
.
At
present
he
is
hesitating
whom
to
lay
siege
to
--
*NL*
you
or
Mademoiselle
Julie
Karagina
.
He
is
very
attentive
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
visits
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
often
.
And
do
you
know
the
new
way
of
courting
?
''
said
Pierre
*NL*
with
an
amused
smile
,
evidently
in
that
cheerful
mood
of
good
humored
*NL*
raillery
for
which
he
so
often
reproached
himself
in
his
diary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
please
Moscow
girls
nowadays
one
has
to
be
melancholy
.
He
is
very
*NL*
melancholy
with
Mademoiselle
Karagina
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
asked
Princess
Mary
,
looking
into
Pierre
's
kindly
face
and
*NL*
still
thinking
of
her
own
sorrow
.
``
It
would
be
a
relief
,
''
thought
she
,
*NL*
``
if
I
ventured
to
confide
what
I
am
feeling
to
someone
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
tell
everything
to
Pierre
.
He
is
kind
and
generous
.
It
would
be
a
*NL*
relief
.
He
would
give
me
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
marry
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
Count
,
there
are
moments
when
I
would
marry
anybody
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
suddenly
to
her
own
surprise
and
with
tears
in
her
voice
.
``
Ah
,
how
*NL*
bitter
it
is
to
love
someone
near
to
you
and
to
feel
that
...
''
she
went
*NL*
on
in
a
trembling
voice
,
``
that
you
can
do
nothing
for
him
but
grieve
*NL*
him
,
and
to
know
that
you
can
not
alter
this
.
Then
there
is
only
one
*NL*
thing
left
--
to
go
away
,
but
where
could
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
wrong
?
What
is
it
,
Princess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
without
finishing
what
she
was
saying
,
Princess
Mary
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
today
.
Do
n't
take
any
notice
--
*NL*
forget
what
I
have
said
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
gaiety
vanished
completely
.
He
anxiously
questioned
the
*NL*
princess
,
asked
her
to
speak
out
fully
and
confide
her
grief
to
him
;
but
*NL*
she
only
repeated
that
she
begged
him
to
forget
what
she
had
said
,
that
*NL*
she
did
not
remember
what
she
had
said
,
and
that
she
had
no
trouble
*NL*
except
the
one
he
knew
of
--
that
Prince
Andrew
's
marriage
threatened
to
*NL*
cause
a
rupture
between
father
and
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
news
of
the
Rostovs
?
''
she
asked
,
to
change
the
subject
.
``
I
*NL*
was
told
they
are
coming
soon
.
I
am
also
expecting
Andrew
any
day
.
I
*NL*
should
like
them
to
meet
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
he
now
regard
the
matter
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
referring
to
the
*NL*
old
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
In
a
few
months
the
year
will
be
up
.
The
thing
is
*NL*
impossible
.
I
only
wish
I
could
spare
my
brother
the
first
moments
.
I
*NL*
wish
they
would
come
sooner
.
I
hope
to
be
friends
with
her
.
You
have
*NL*
known
them
a
long
time
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
Tell
me
honestly
the
whole
*NL*
truth
:
what
sort
of
girl
is
she
,
and
what
do
you
think
of
her
?
--
The
real
*NL*
truth
,
because
you
know
Andrew
is
risking
so
much
doing
this
against
his
*NL*
father
's
will
that
I
should
like
to
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
undefined
instinct
told
Pierre
that
these
explanations
,
and
repeated
*NL*
requests
to
be
told
the
whole
truth
,
expressed
ill-will
on
the
princess
'
*NL*
part
toward
her
future
sister-in-law
and
a
wish
that
he
should
*NL*
disapprove
of
Andrew
's
choice
;
but
in
reply
he
said
what
he
felt
rather
*NL*
than
what
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
answer
your
question
,
''
he
said
,
blushing
without
*NL*
knowing
why
.
``
I
really
do
n't
know
what
sort
of
girl
she
is
;
I
ca
n't
*NL*
analyze
her
at
all
.
She
is
enchanting
,
but
what
makes
her
so
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
That
is
all
one
can
say
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
sighed
,
and
the
expression
on
her
face
said
:
``
Yes
,
that
's
*NL*
what
I
expected
and
feared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
clever
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
yet
--
yes

She
does
not
deign
to
be
*NL*
clever
...
Oh
no
,
she
is
simply
enchanting
,
and
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
again
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
so
long

like
her
!
Tell
her
so
if
you
see
her
before
I
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
they
are
expected
very
soon
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
told
Pierre
of
her
plan
to
become
intimate
with
her
future
*NL*
sister-in-law
as
soon
as
the
Rostovs
arrived
and
to
try
to
accustom
the

old
prince
to
her

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
had
not
succeeded
in
making
a
wealthy
match
in
Petersburg
,
so
with
*NL*
the
same
object
in
view
he
came
to
Moscow
.
There
he
wavered
between
the
*NL*
two
richest
heiresses
,
Julie
and
Princess
Mary
.
Though
Princess
Mary
*NL*
despite
her
plainness
seemed
to
him
more
attractive
than
Julie
,
he
,
*NL*
without
knowing
why
,
felt
awkward
about
paying
court
to
her
.
When
they
*NL*
had
last
met
on
the
old
prince
's
name
day
,
she
had
answered
at
random
*NL*
all
his
attempts
to
talk
sentimentally
,
evidently
not
listening
to
what
*NL*
he
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
on
the
contrary
accepted
his
attentions
readily
,
though
in
a
*NL*
manner
peculiar
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
twenty-seven
.
After
the
death
of
her
brothers
she
had
become
*NL*
very
wealthy
.
She
was
by
now
decidedly
plain
,
but
thought
herself
not
*NL*
merely
as
good-looking
as
before
but
even
far
more
attractive
.
She
was
*NL*
confirmed
in
this
delusion
by
the
fact
that
she
had
become
a
very
*NL*
wealthy
heiress
and
also
by
the
fact
that
the
older
she
grew
the
less
*NL*
dangerous
she
became
to
men
,
and
the
more
freely
they
could
associate
*NL*
with
her
and
avail
themselves
of
her
suppers
,
soirees
,
and
the
animated
*NL*
company
that
assembled
at
her
house
,
without
incurring
any
obligation
.
A
*NL*
man
who
would
have
been
afraid
ten
years
before
of
going
every
day
to
*NL*
the
house
when
there
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
there
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
compromising
her
and
committing
himself
,
would
now
go
boldly
every
day
*NL*
and
treat
her
not
as
a
marriageable
girl
but
as
a
sexless
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
winter
the
Karagins
'
house
was
the
most
agreeable
and
hospitable
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
In
addition
to
the
formal
evening
and
dinner
parties
,
a
large
*NL*
company
,
chiefly
of
men
,
gathered
there
every
day
,
supping
at
midnight
*NL*
and
staying
till
three
in
the
morning
.
Julie
never
missed
a
ball
,
a
*NL*
promenade
,
or
a
play
.
Her
dresses
were
always
of
the
latest
fashion
.
But
*NL*
in
spite
of
that
she
seemed
to
be
disillusioned
about
everything
and
*NL*
told
everyone
that
she
did
not
believe
either
in
friendship
or
in
love
,
*NL*
or
any
of
the
joys
of
life
,
and
expected
peace
only
``
yonder
.
''
She
*NL*
adopted
the
tone
of
one
who
has
suffered
a
great
disappointment
,
like
a
*NL*
girl
who
has
either
lost
the
man
she
loved
or
been
cruelly
deceived
by
*NL*
him
.
Though
nothing
of
the
kind
had
happened
to
her
she
was
regarded
in
*NL*
that
light
,
and
had
even
herself
come
to
believe
that
she
had
suffered
*NL*
much
in
life
.
This
melancholy
,
which
did
not
prevent
her
amusing
*NL*
herself
,
did
not
hinder
the
young
people
who
came
to
her
house
from
*NL*
passing
the
time
pleasantly
.
Every
visitor
who
came
to
the
house
paid
*NL*
his
tribute
to
the
melancholy
mood
of
the
hostess
,
and
then
amused
*NL*
himself
with
society
gossip
,
dancing
,
intellectual
games
,
and
bouts
*NL*
rimes
,
which
were
in
vogue
at
the
Karagins
'
.
Only
a
few
of
these
young
*NL*
men
,
among
them
Boris
,
entered
more
deeply
into
Julie
's
melancholy
,
and
*NL*
with
these
she
had
prolonged
conversations
in
private
on
the
vanity
of
*NL*
all
worldly
things
,
and
to
them
she
showed
her
albums
filled
with
*NL*
mournful
sketches
,
maxims
,
and
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Boris
,
Julie
was
particularly
gracious
:
she
regretted
his
early
*NL*
disillusionment
with
life
,
offered
him
such
consolation
of
friendship
as
*NL*
she
who
had
herself
suffered
so
much
could
render
,
and
showed
him
her
*NL*
album
.
Boris
sketched
two
trees
in
the
album
and
wrote
:
``
Rustic
trees
,
*NL*
your
dark
branches
shed
gloom
and
melancholy
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
page
he
drew
a
tomb
,
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
La
mort
est
secourable
et
la
mort
est
tranquille
.
Ah
!
contre
les
*NL*
douleurs
il
n
'
y
a
pas
d'autre
asile
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Death
gives
relief
and
death
is
peaceful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
from
suffering
there
is
no
other
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
said
this
was
charming
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
so
enchanting
in
the
smile
of
melancholy
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
Boris
,
repeating
word
for
word
a
passage
she
had
copied
from
a
book
.
*NL*
``
It
is
a
ray
of
light
in
the
darkness
,
a
shade
between
sadness
and
*NL*
despair
,
showing
the
possibility
of
consolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
Boris
wrote
these
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Aliment
de
poison
d'une
ame
trop
sensible
,
Toi
,
sans
qui
le
bonheur

*NL*
serait

Poisonous
nourishment

a
too
sensitive
soul
,
Thou
,
without
whom
*NL*
happiness
would
for
me
be
impossible
,
Tender

ah

console
me
,
Come
to
calm
the
torments
of
my
gloomy
retreat
,
And
mingle
a
*NL*
secret
sweetness
With
these
tears
that
I
feel
to
be
flowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Boris
,
Julie
played
most
doleful
nocturnes
on
her
harp
.
Boris
read
*NL*
`
Poor
Liza
'
aloud
to
her
,
and
more
than
once
interrupted
the
reading
*NL*
because
of
the
emotions
that
choked
him
.
Meeting
at
large
gatherings
*NL*
Julie
and
Boris
looked
on
one
another
as
the
only
souls
who
understood
*NL*
one
another
in
a
world
of
indifferent
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
,
who
often
visited
the
Karagins
,
while
playing
cards
*NL*
with
the
mother
made
careful
inquiries
as
to
Julie
's
dowry
-LRB-
she
was
to
*NL*
have
two
estates
in
Penza
and
the
Nizhegorod
forests
-RRB-
.
Anna
Mikhaylovna
*NL*
regarded
the
refined
sadness
that
united
her
son
to
the
wealthy
Julie
*NL*
with
emotion
,
and
resignation
to
the
Divine
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
charming
and
melancholy
,
my
dear
Julie
,
''
she
said
to
the
*NL*
daughter
.
``
Boris
says
his
soul
finds
repose
at
your
house
.
He
has
*NL*
suffered
so
many
disappointments
and
is
so
sensitive
,
''
said
she
to
the
*NL*
mother
.
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
fond
I
have
grown
of
Julie
*NL*
latterly
,
''
she
said
to
her
son
.
``
But
who
could
help
loving
her
?
She
is
*NL*
an
angelic
being
!
Ah
,
Boris
,
Boris
!
''
--
she
paused
.
``
And
how
I
pity
her
*NL*
mother
,
''
she
went
on
;
``
today
she
showed
me
her
accounts
and
letters
from
*NL*
Penza
-LRB-
they
have
enormous
estates
there
-RRB-
,
and
she
,
poor
thing
,
has
no
*NL*
one
to
help
her
,
and
they
do
cheat
her
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
smiled
almost
imperceptibly
while
listening
to
his
mother
.
He
*NL*
laughed
blandly
at
her
naive
diplomacy
but
listened
to
what
she
had
to
*NL*
say
,
and
sometimes
questioned
her
carefully
about
the
Penza
and
*NL*
Nizhegorod
estates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
had
long
been
expecting
a
proposal
from
her
melancholy
adorer
and
*NL*
was
ready
to
accept
it
;
but
some
secret
feeling
of
repulsion
for
her
,
*NL*
for
her
passionate
desire
to
get
married
,
for
her
artificiality
,
and
a
*NL*
feeling
of
horror
at
renouncing
the
possibility
of
real
love
still
*NL*
restrained
Boris
.
His
leave
was
expiring
.
He
spent
every
day
and
whole
*NL*
days
at
the
Karagins
'
,
and
every
day
on
thinking
the
matter
over
told
*NL*
himself
that
he
would
propose
tomorrow
.
But
in
Julie
's
presence
,
looking
*NL*
at
her
red
face
and
chin
-LRB-
nearly
always
powdered
-RRB-
,
her
moist
eyes
,
and
*NL*
her
expression
of
continual
readiness
to
pass
at
once
from
melancholy
to
*NL*
an
unnatural
rapture
of
married
bliss
,
Boris
could
not
utter
the
*NL*
decisive
words
,
though
in
imagination
he
had
long
regarded
himself
as
*NL*
the
possessor
of
those
Penza
and
Nizhegorod
estates
and
had
apportioned
*NL*
the
use
of
the
income
from
them
.
Julie
saw
Boris
'
indecision
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
the
thought
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
repulsive
to
him
,
but
*NL*
her
feminine
self-deception
immediately
supplied
her
with
consolation
,
*NL*
and
she
told
herself
that
he
was
only
shy
from
love
.
Her
melancholy
,
*NL*
however
,
began
to
turn
to
irritability
,
and
not
long
before
Boris
'
*NL*
departure
she
formed
a
definite
plan
of
action
.
Just
as
Boris
'
leave
of
*NL*
absence
was
expiring
,
Anatole
Kuragin
made
his
appearance
in
Moscow
,
and
*NL*
of
course
in
the
Karagins
'
drawing
room
,
and
Julie
,
suddenly
abandoning
*NL*
her
melancholy
,
became
cheerful
and
very
attentive
to
Kuragin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
Anna
Mikhaylovna
to
her
son
,
``
I
know
from
a
reliable
*NL*
source
that
Prince
Vasili
has
sent
his
son
to
Moscow
to
get
him
married
*NL*
to
Julie
.
I
am
so
fond
of
Julie
that
I
should
be
sorry
for
her
.
What
do
*NL*
you
think
of
it
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
being
made
a
fool
of
and
of
having
thrown
away
that
whole
*NL*
month
of
arduous
melancholy
service
to
Julie
,
and
of
seeing
all
the
*NL*
revenue
from
the
Penza
estates
which
he
had
already
mentally
apportioned
*NL*
and
put
to
proper
use
fall
into
the
hands
of
another
,
and
especially
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
that
idiot
Anatole
,
pained
Boris
.
He
drove
to
the
*NL*
Karagins
'
with
the
firm
intention
of
proposing
.
Julie
met
him
in
a
gay
,
*NL*
careless
manner
,
spoke
casually
of
how
she
had
enjoyed
yesterday
's
ball
,
*NL*
and
asked
when
he
was
leaving
.
Though
Boris
had
come
intentionally
to
*NL*
speak
of
his
love
and
therefore
meant
to
be
tender
,
he
began
speaking
*NL*
irritably
of
feminine
inconstancy
,
of
how
easily
women
can
turn
from
*NL*
sadness
to
joy
,
and
how
their
moods
depend
solely
on
who
happens
to
be
*NL*
paying
court
to
them
.
Julie
was
offended
and
replied
that
it
was
true
*NL*
that
a
woman
needs
variety
,
and
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
would
*NL*
weary
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
should
advise
you
...
''
Boris
began
,
wishing
to
sting
her
;
but
at
*NL*
that
instant
the
galling
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
to
*NL*
leave
Moscow
without
having
accomplished
his
aim
,
and
have
vainly
wasted
*NL*
his
efforts
--
which
was
a
thing
he
never
allowed
to
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
checked
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
,
lowered
his
eyes
to
*NL*
avoid
seeing
her
unpleasantly
irritated
and
irresolute
face
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
come
here
at
all
to
quarrel
with
you
.
On
the
contrary
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
to
make
sure
that
he
might
go
on
.
Her
irritability
had
*NL*
suddenly
quite
vanished
,
and
her
anxious
,
imploring
eyes
were
fixed
on
*NL*
him
with
greedy
expectation
.
``
I
can
always
arrange
so
as
not
to
see
her
*NL*
often
,
''
thought
Boris
.
``
The
affair
has
been
begun
and
must
be
finished
!
''
*NL*
He
blushed
hotly
,
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
my
feelings
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
need
to
say
more
:
Julie
's
face
shone
with
triumph
and
self
-
*NL*
satisfaction
;
but
she
forced
Boris
to
say
all
that
is
said
on
such
*NL*
occasions
--
that
he
loved
her
and
had
never
loved
any
other
woman
more
*NL*
than
her
.
She
knew
that
for
the
Penza
estates
and
Nizhegorod
forests
she
*NL*
could
demand
this
,
and
she
received
what
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affianced
couple
,
no
longer
alluding
to
trees
that
shed
gloom
and
*NL*
melancholy
upon
them
,
planned
the
arrangements
of
a
splendid
house
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
paid
calls
,
and
prepared
everything
for
a
brilliant
wedding
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
January
old
Count
Rostov
went
to
Moscow
with
Natasha
and
*NL*
Sonya
.
The
countess
was
still
unwell
and
unable
to
travel
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
wait
for
her
recovery
.
Prince
Andrew
was
expected
in
*NL*
Moscow
any
day
,
the
trousseau
had
to
be
ordered
and
the
estate
near
*NL*
Moscow
had
to
be
sold
,
besides
which
the
opportunity
of
presenting
his
*NL*
future
daughter-in-law
to
old
Prince
Bolkonski
while
he
was
in
Moscow
*NL*
could
not
be
missed
.
The
Rostovs
'
Moscow
house
had
not
been
heated
that
*NL*
winter
and
,
as
they
had
come
only
for
a
short
time
and
the
countess
was
*NL*
not
with
them
,
the
count
decided
to
stay
with
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
Akhrosimova
,
who
had
long
been
pressing
her
hospitality
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
one
evening
the
Rostovs
'
four
sleighs
drove
into
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
*NL*
courtyard
in
the
old
Konyusheny
street
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
lived
alone
.
*NL*
She
had
already
married
off
her
daughter
,
and
her
sons
were
all
in
the
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
herself
as
erect
,
told
everyone
her
opinion
as
candidly
,
*NL*
loudly
,
and
bluntly
as
ever
,
and
her
whole
bearing
seemed
a
reproach
to
*NL*
others
for
any
weakness
,
passion
,
or
temptation
--
the
possibility
of
*NL*
which
she
did
not
admit
.
From
early
in
the
morning
,
wearing
a
dressing
*NL*
jacket
,
she
attended
to
her
household
affairs
,
and
then
she
drove
out
:
*NL*
on
holy
days
to
church
and
after
the
service
to
jails
and
prisons
on
*NL*
affairs
of
which
she
never
spoke
to
anyone
.
On
ordinary
days
,
after
*NL*
dressing
,
she
received
petitioners
of
various
classes
,
of
whom
there
*NL*
were
always
some
.
Then
she
had
dinner
,
a
substantial
and
appetizing
meal
*NL*
at
which
there
were
always
three
or
four
guests
;
after
dinner
she
played
*NL*
a
game
of
boston
,
and
at
night
she
had
the
newspapers
or
a
new
book
read
*NL*
to
her
while
she
knitted
.
She
rarely
made
an
exception
and
went
out
to
*NL*
pay
visits
,
and
then
only
to
the
most
important
persons
in
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
when
the
Rostovs
arrived
and
the
pulley
of
*NL*
the
hall
door
squeaked
from
the
cold
as
it
let
in
the
Rostovs
and
their
*NL*
servants
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
with
her
spectacles
hanging
down
on
her
nose
*NL*
and
her
head
flung
back
,
stood
in
the
hall
doorway
looking
with
a
stern
,
*NL*
grim
face
at
the
new
arrivals
.
One
might
have
thought
she
was
angry
with
*NL*
the
travelers
and
would
immediately
turn
them
out
,
had
she
not
at
the
*NL*
same
time
been
giving
careful
instructions
to
the
servants
for
the
*NL*
accommodation
of
the
visitors
and
their
belongings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
's
things
?
Bring
them
here
,
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
portmanteaus
and
not
greeting
anyone
.
``
The
young
ladies
'
?
There
to
the
*NL*
left
.
Now
what
are
you
dawdling
for
?
''
she
cried
to
the
maids
.
``
Get
the
*NL*
samovar
ready
!
...
You
've
grown
plumper
and
prettier
,
''
she
remarked
,
*NL*
drawing
Natasha
-LRB-
whose
cheeks
were
glowing
from
the
cold
-RRB-
to
her
by
the
*NL*
hood
.
``
Foo
!
You
are
cold
!
Now
take
off
your
things
,
quick
!
''
she
shouted
*NL*
to
the
count
who
was
going
to
kiss
her
hand
.
``
You
're
half
frozen
,
I
'm
*NL*
sure
!
Bring
some
rum
for
tea
!
...
Bonjour
,
Sonya
dear
!
''
she
added
,
*NL*
turning
to
Sonya
and
indicating
by
this
French
greeting
her
slightly
*NL*
contemptuous
though
affectionate
attitude
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
in
to
tea
,
having
taken
off
their
outdoor
things
and
*NL*
tidied
themselves
up
after
their
journey
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
kissed
them
*NL*
all
in
due
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
heartily
glad
you
have
come
and
are
staying
with
me
.
It
was
high
*NL*
time
,
''
she
said
,
giving
Natasha
a
significant
look
.
``
The
old
man
is
here
*NL*
and
his
son
's
expected
any
day
.
You
'll
have
to
make
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
But
we
'll
speak
of
that
later
on
,
''
she
added
,
glancing
at
Sonya
with
a
*NL*
look
that
showed
she
did
not
want
to
speak
of
it
in
her
presence
.
``
Now
*NL*
listen
,
''
she
said
to
the
count
.
``
What
do
you
want
tomorrow
?
Whom
will
*NL*
you
send
for
?
Shinshin
?
''
she
crooked
one
of
her
fingers
.
``
The
sniveling
*NL*
Anna
Mikhaylovna
?
That
's
two
.
She
's
here
with
her
son
.
The
son
is
*NL*
getting
married
!
Then
Bezukhov
,
eh
?
He
is
here
too
,
with
his
wife
.
He
*NL*
ran
away
from
her
and
she
came
galloping
after
him
.
He
dined
with
me
on
*NL*
Wednesday
.
As
for
them
''
--
and
she
pointed
to
the
girls
--
``
tomorrow
I
'll
*NL*
take
them
first
to
the
Iberian
shrine
of
the
Mother
of
God
,
and
then
*NL*
we
'll
drive
to
the
Super-Rogue
's
.
I
suppose
you
'll
have
everything
new
.
*NL*
Do
n't
judge
by
me
:
sleeves
nowadays
are
this
size
!
The
other
day
young
*NL*
Princess
Irina
Vasilevna
came
to
see
me
;
she
was
an
awful
sight
--
looked
*NL*
as
if
she
had
put
two
barrels
on
her
arms
.
You
know
not
a
day
passes
now
*NL*
without
some
new
fashion
...
And
what
have
you
to
do
yourself
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
the
count
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
has
come
on
top
of
another
:
her
rags
to
buy
,
and
now
a
*NL*
purchaser
has
turned
up
for
the
Moscow
estate
and
for
the
house
.
If
you
*NL*
will
be
so
kind
,
I
'll
fix
a
time
and
go
down
to
the
estate
just
for
a
*NL*
day
,
and
leave
my
lassies
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
All
right
.
They
'll
be
safe
with
me
,
as
safe
as
in
Chancery
!
*NL*
I
'll
take
them
where
they
must
go
,
scold
them
a
bit
,
and
pet
them
a
*NL*
bit
,
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
touching
her
goddaughter
and
favorite
,
*NL*
Natasha
,
on
the
cheek
with
her
large
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
Marya
Dmitrievna
took
the
young
ladies
to
the
Iberian
*NL*
shrine
of
the
Mother
of
God
and
to
Madame
Suppert-Roguet
,
who
was
so
*NL*
afraid
of
Marya
Dmitrievna
that
she
always
let
her
have
costumes
at
a
*NL*
loss
merely
to
get
rid
of
her
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
ordered
almost
the
whole
*NL*
trousseau
.
When
they
got
home
she
turned
everybody
out
of
the
room
*NL*
except
Natasha
,
and
then
called
her
pet
to
her
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
we
'll
talk
.
I
congratulate
you
on
your
betrothed
.
You
've
*NL*
hooked
a
fine
fellow
!
I
am
glad
for
your
sake
and
I
've
known
him
since
*NL*
he
was
so
high
.
''
She
held
her
hand
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
Natasha
blushed
happily
.
``
I
like
him
and
all
his
family
.
Now
listen
!
You
*NL*
know
that
old
Prince
Nicholas
much
dislikes
his
son
's
marrying
.
The
old
*NL*
fellow
's
crotchety
!
Of
course
Prince
Andrew
is
not
a
child
and
can
shift
*NL*
without
him
,
but
it
's
not
nice
to
enter
a
family
against
a
father
's
*NL*
will
.
One
wants
to
do
it
peacefully
and
lovingly
.
You
're
a
clever
girl
*NL*
and
you
'll
know
how
to
manage
.
Be
kind
,
and
use
your
wits
.
Then
all
will
*NL*
be
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
remained
silent
,
from
shyness
Marya
Dmitrievna
supposed
,
but
*NL*
really
because
she
disliked
anyone
interfering
in
what
touched
her
love
*NL*
of
Prince
Andrew
,
which
seemed
to
her
so
apart
from
all
human
affairs
*NL*
that
no
one
could
understand
it
.
She
loved
and
knew
Prince
Andrew
,
he
*NL*
loved
her
only
,
and
was
to
come
one
of
these
days
and
take
her
.
She
*NL*
wanted
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
have
known
him
a
long
time
and
am
also
fond
of
Mary
,
your
*NL*
future
sister-in-law
.
`
Husbands
'
sisters
bring
up
blisters
,
'
but
this
*NL*
one
would
n't
hurt
a
fly
.
She
has
asked
me
to
bring
you
two
together
.
*NL*
Tomorrow
you
'll
go
with
your
father
to
see
her
.
Be
very
nice
and
*NL*
affectionate
to
her
:
you
're
younger
than
she
.
When
he
comes
,
he
'll
find
*NL*
you
already
know
his
sister
and
father
and
are
liked
by
them
.
Am
I
right
*NL*
or
not
?
Wo
n't
that
be
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
will
,
''
Natasha
answered
reluctantly
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
by
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
advice
,
Count
Rostov
took
Natasha
to
*NL*
call
on
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
.
The
count
did
not
set
out
cheerfully
*NL*
on
this
visit
,
at
heart
he
felt
afraid
.
He
well
remembered
the
last
*NL*
interview
he
had
had
with
the
old
prince
at
the
time
of
the
enrollment
,
*NL*
when
in
reply
to
an
invitation
to
dinner
he
had
had
to
listen
to
an
*NL*
angry
reprimand
for
not
having
provided
his
full
quota
of
men
.
Natasha
,
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
having
put
on
her
best
gown
,
was
in
the
highest
*NL*
spirits
.
``
They
ca
n't
help
liking
me
,
''
she
thought
.
``
Everybody
always
has
*NL*
liked
me
,
and
I
am
so
willing
to
do
anything
they
wish
,
so
ready
to
be
*NL*
fond
of
him
--
for
being
his
father
--
and
of
her
--
for
being
his
sister
--
*NL*
that
there
is
no
reason
for
them
not
to
like
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
up
to
the
gloomy
old
house
on
the
Vozdvizhenka
and
entered
*NL*
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
!
''
said
the
count
,
half
in
jest
,
half
in
*NL*
earnest
;
but
Natasha
noticed
that
her
father
was
flurried
on
entering
*NL*
the
anteroom
and
inquired
timidly
and
softly
whether
the
prince
and
*NL*
princess
were
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
been
announced
a
perturbation
was
noticeable
among
the
*NL*
servants
.
The
footman
who
had
gone
to
announce
them
was
stopped
by
*NL*
another
in
the
large
hall
and
they
whispered
to
one
another
.
Then
a
*NL*
maidservant
ran
into
the
hall
and
hurriedly
said
something
,
mentioning
*NL*
the
princess
.
At
last
an
old
,
cross
looking
footman
came
and
announced
*NL*
to
the
Rostovs
that
the
prince
was
not
receiving
,
but
that
the
princess
*NL*
begged
them
to
walk
up
.
The
first
person
who
came
to
meet
the
visitors
*NL*
was
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
She
greeted
the
father
and
daughter
with
*NL*
special
politeness
and
showed
them
to
the
princess
'
room
.
The
princess
,
*NL*
looking
excited
and
nervous
,
her
face
flushed
in
patches
,
ran
in
to
meet
*NL*
the
visitors
,
treading
heavily
,
and
vainly
trying
to
appear
cordial
and
*NL*
at
ease
.
From
the
first
glance
Princess
Mary
did
not
like
Natasha
.
She
*NL*
thought
her
too
fashionably
dressed
,
frivolously
gay
and
vain
.
She
did
*NL*
not
at
all
realize
that
before
having
seen
her
future
sister-in-law
she
*NL*
was
prejudiced
against
her
by
involuntary
envy
of
her
beauty
,
youth
,
and
*NL*
happiness
,
as
well
as
by
jealousy
of
her
brother
's
love
for
her
.
Apart
*NL*
from
this
insuperable
antipathy
to
her
,
Princess
Mary
was
agitated
just
*NL*
then
because
on
the
Rostovs
'
being
announced
,
the
old
prince
had
shouted
*NL*
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
them
,
that
Princess
Mary
might
do
so
if
she
*NL*
chose
,
but
they
were
not
to
be
admitted
to
him
.
She
had
decided
to
*NL*
receive
them
,
but
feared
lest
the
prince
might
at
any
moment
indulge
in
*NL*
some
freak
,
as
he
seemed
much
upset
by
the
Rostovs
'
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
my
dear
princess
,
I
've
brought
you
my
songstress
,
''
said
the
*NL*
count
,
bowing
and
looking
round
uneasily
as
if
afraid
the
old
prince
*NL*
might
appear
.
``
I
am
so
glad
you
should
get
to
know
one
another
...
very
*NL*
sorry
the
prince
is
still
ailing
,
''
and
after
a
few
more
commonplace
*NL*
remarks
he
rose
.
``
If
you
'll
allow
me
to
leave
my
Natasha
in
your
hands
*NL*
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
Princess
,
I
'll
drive
round
to
see
Anna
*NL*
Semenovna
,
it
's
quite
near
in
the
Dogs
'
Square
,
and
then
I
'll
come
back
*NL*
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
had
devised
this
diplomatic
ruse
-LRB-
as
he
afterwards
told
his
*NL*
daughter
-RRB-
to
give
the
future
sisters-in-law
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
*NL*
one
another
freely
,
but
another
motive
was
to
avoid
the
danger
of
*NL*
encountering
the
old
prince
,
of
whom
he
was
afraid
.
He
did
not
mention
*NL*
this
to
his
daughter
,
but
Natasha
noticed
her
father
's
nervousness
and
*NL*
anxiety
and
felt
mortified
by
it
.
She
blushed
for
him
,
grew
still
*NL*
angrier
at
having
blushed
,
and
looked
at
the
princess
with
a
bold
and
*NL*
defiant
expression
which
said
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
anybody
.
The
*NL*
princess
told
the
count
that
she
would
be
delighted
,
and
only
begged
him
*NL*
to
stay
longer
at
Anna
Semenovna
's
,
and
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
the
uneasy
glances
thrown
at
her
by
Princess
Mary
--
who
wished
to
*NL*
have
a
tete-a-tete
with
Natasha
--
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
remained
in
the
*NL*
room
and
persistently
talked
about
Moscow
amusements
and
theaters
.
*NL*
Natasha
felt
offended
by
the
hesitation
she
had
noticed
in
the
anteroom
,
*NL*
by
her
father
's
nervousness
,
and
by
the
unnatural
manner
of
the
princess
*NL*
who
--
she
thought
--
was
making
a
favor
of
receiving
her
,
and
so
everything
*NL*
displeased
her
.
She
did
not
like
Princess
Mary
,
whom
she
thought
very
*NL*
plain
,
affected
,
and
dry
.
Natasha
suddenly
shrank
into
herself
and
*NL*
involuntarily
assumed
an
offhand
air
which
alienated
Princess
Mary
still
*NL*
more
.
After
five
minutes
of
irksome
,
constrained
conversation
,
they
*NL*
heard
the
sound
of
slippered
feet
rapidly
approaching
.
Princess
Mary
*NL*
looked
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
and
the
old
prince
,
in
a
dressing
gown
and
a
white
*NL*
nightcap
,
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
madam
!
''
he
began
.
``
Madam
,
Countess
...
Countess
Rostova
,
if
I
am
not
*NL*
mistaken
...
I
beg
you
to
excuse
me
,
to
excuse
me
...
I
did
not
know
,
*NL*
madam
.
God
is
my
witness
,
I
did
not
know
you
had
honored
us
with
a
*NL*
visit
,
and
I
came
in
such
a
costume
only
to
see
my
daughter
.
I
beg
you
*NL*
to
excuse
me
...
God
is
my
witness
,
I
did
n't
know
-
''
he
repeated
,
*NL*
stressing
the
word
``
God
''
so
unnaturally
and
so
unpleasantly
that
*NL*
Princess
Mary
stood
with
downcast
eyes
not
daring
to
look
either
at
her
*NL*
father
or
at
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
the
latter
,
having
risen
and
curtsied
,
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
alone
smiled
agreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
excuse
me
,
excuse
me
!
God
is
my
witness
,
I
did
not
know
,
''
*NL*
muttered
the
old
man
,
and
after
looking
Natasha
over
from
head
to
foot
*NL*
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
after
this
*NL*
apparition
and
began
speaking
about
the
prince
's
indisposition
.
Natasha
*NL*
and
Princess
Mary
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
,
and
the
longer
they
*NL*
did
so
without
saying
what
they
wanted
to
say
,
the
greater
grew
their
*NL*
antipathy
to
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
count
returned
,
Natasha
was
impolitely
pleased
and
hastened
to
*NL*
get
away
:
at
that
moment
she
hated
the
stiff
,
elderly
princess
,
who
*NL*
could
place
her
in
such
an
embarrassing
position
and
had
spent
half
an
*NL*
hour
with
her
without
once
mentioning
Prince
Andrew
.
``
I
could
n't
begin
*NL*
talking
about
him
in
the
presence
of
that
Frenchwoman
,
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
The
same
thought
was
meanwhile
tormenting
Princess
Mary
.
She
knew
what
*NL*
she
ought
to
have
said
to
Natasha
,
but
she
had
been
unable
to
say
it
*NL*
because
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
in
the
way
,
and
because
,
without
*NL*
knowing
why
,
she
felt
it
very
difficult
to
speak
of
the
marriage
.
When
*NL*
the
count
was
already
leaving
the
room
,
Princess
Mary
went
up
hurriedly
*NL*
to
Natasha
,
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
said
with
a
deep
sigh
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
I
must
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
glanced
at
her
ironically
without
knowing
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Natalie
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
``
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
am
glad
*NL*
my
brother
has
found
happiness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
feeling
that
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
.
Natasha
noticed
*NL*
this
and
guessed
its
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
Princess
,
it
is
not
convenient
to
speak
of
that
now
,
''
she
said
*NL*
with
external
dignity
and
coldness
,
though
she
felt
the
tears
choking
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
said
and
what
have
I
done
?
''
thought
she
,
as
soon
as
she
was
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
a
long
time
for
Natasha
to
come
to
dinner
that
day
.
She
sat
*NL*
in
her
room
crying
like
a
child
,
blowing
her
nose
and
sobbing
.
Sonya
*NL*
stood
beside
her
,
kissing
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
what
is
it
about
?
''
she
asked
.
``
What
do
they
matter
to
you
?
It
*NL*
will
all
pass
,
Natasha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
only
knew
how
offensive
it
was
...
as
if
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
about
it
,
Natasha
.
It
was
n't
your
fault
so
why
should
you
*NL*
mind
?
Kiss
me
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
raised
her
head
and
,
kissing
her
friend
on
the
lips
,
pressed
her
*NL*
wet
face
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
I
do
n't
know
.
No
one
's
to
blame
,
''
said
Natasha
--
``
It
's
*NL*
my
fault
.
But
it
all
hurts
terribly
.
Oh
,
why
does
n't
he
come
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
in
to
dinner
with
red
eyes
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
who
knew
how
the
*NL*
prince
had
received
the
Rostovs
,
pretended
not
to
notice
how
upset
*NL*
Natasha
was
and
jested
resolutely
and
loudly
at
table
with
the
count
and
*NL*
the
other
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
the
Rostovs
went
to
the
Opera
,
for
which
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
had
taken
a
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
want
to
go
,
but
could
not
refuse
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
kind
*NL*
offer
which
was
intended
expressly
for
her
.
When
she
came
ready
dressed
*NL*
into
the
ballroom
to
await
her
father
,
and
looking
in
the
large
mirror
*NL*
there
saw
that
she
was
pretty
,
very
pretty
,
she
felt
even
more
sad
,
but
*NL*
it
was
a
sweet
,
tender
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
,
if
he
were
here
now
I
would
not
behave
as
I
did
then
,
but
*NL*
differently
.
I
would
not
be
silly
and
afraid
of
things
,
I
would
simply
*NL*
embrace
him
,
cling
to
him
,
and
make
him
look
at
me
with
those
searching
*NL*
inquiring
eyes
with
which
he
has
so
often
looked
at
me
,
and
then
I
would
*NL*
make
him
laugh
as
he
used
to
laugh
.
And
his
eyes
--
how
I
see
those
eyes
!
''
*NL*
thought
Natasha
.
``
And
what
do
his
father
and
sister
matter
to
me
?
I
love
*NL*
him
alone
,
him
,
him
,
with
that
face
and
those
eyes
,
with
his
smile
,
*NL*
manly
and
yet
childlike
...
No
,
I
had
better
not
think
of
him
;
not
think
*NL*
of
him
but
forget
him
,
quite
forget
him
for
the
present
.
I
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
this
waiting
and
I
shall
cry
in
a
minute
!
''
and
she
turned
away
from
the
*NL*
glass
,
making
an
effort
not
to
cry
.
``
And
how
can
Sonya
love
Nicholas
so
*NL*
calmly
and
quietly
and
wait
so
long
and
so
patiently
?
''
thought
she
,
*NL*
looking
at
Sonya
,
who
also
came
in
quite
ready
,
with
a
fan
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
altogether
different
.
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
at
that
moment
felt
so
softened
and
tender
that
it
was
not
*NL*
enough
for
her
to
love
and
know
she
was
beloved
,
she
wanted
now
,
at
*NL*
once
,
to
embrace
the
man
she
loved
,
to
speak
and
hear
from
him
words
of
*NL*
love
such
as
filled
her
heart
.
While
she
sat
in
the
carriage
beside
her
*NL*
father
,
pensively
watching
the
lights
of
the
street
lamps
flickering
on
*NL*
the
frozen
window
,
she
felt
still
sadder
and
more
in
love
,
and
forgot
*NL*
where
she
was
going
and
with
whom
.
Having
fallen
into
the
line
of
*NL*
carriages
,
the
Rostovs
'
carriage
drove
up
to
the
theater
,
its
wheels
*NL*
squeaking
over
the
snow
.
Natasha
and
Sonya
,
holding
up
their
dresses
,
*NL*
jumped
out
quickly
.
The
count
got
out
helped
by
the
footmen
,
and
,
*NL*
passing
among
men
and
women
who
were
entering
and
the
program
sellers
,
*NL*
they
all
three
went
along
the
corridor
to
the
first
row
of
boxes
.
*NL*
Through
the
closed
doors
the
music
was
already
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
your
hair
!
...
''
whispered
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
attendant
deferentially
and
quickly
slipped
before
the
ladies
and
*NL*
opened
the
door
of
their
box
.
The
music
sounded
louder
and
through
the
*NL*
door
rows
of
brightly
lit
boxes
in
which
ladies
sat
with
bare
arms
and
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
noisy
stalls
brilliant
with
uniforms
,
glittered
before
*NL*
their
eyes
.
A
lady
entering
the
next
box
shot
a
glance
of
feminine
envy
*NL*
at
Natasha
.
The
curtain
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
overture
was
being
*NL*
played
.
Natasha
,
smoothing
her
gown
,
went
in
with
Sonya
and
sat
down
,
*NL*
scanning
the
brilliant
tiers
of
boxes
opposite
.
A
sensation
she
had
not
*NL*
experienced
for
a
long
time
--
that
of
hundreds
of
eyes
looking
at
her
*NL*
bare
arms
and
neck
--
suddenly
affected
her
both
agreeably
and
*NL*
disagreeably
and
called
up
a
whole
crowd
of
memories
,
desires
and
*NL*
emotions
associated
with
that
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
remarkably
pretty
girls
,
Natasha
and
Sonya
,
with
Count
Rostov
*NL*
who
had
not
been
seen
in
Moscow
for
a
long
time
,
attracted
general
*NL*
attention
.
Moreover
,
everybody
knew
vaguely
of
Natasha
's
engagement
to
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
and
knew
that
the
Rostovs
had
lived
in
the
country
ever
*NL*
since
,
and
all
looked
with
curiosity
at
a
fiancee
who
was
making
one
of
*NL*
the
best
matches
in
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
looks
,
as
everyone
told
her
,
had
improved
in
the
country
,
and
*NL*
that
evening
thanks
to
her
agitation
she
was
particularly
pretty
.
She
*NL*
struck
those
who
saw
her
by
her
fullness
of
life
and
beauty
,
combined
*NL*
with
her
indifference
to
everything
about
her
.
Her
black
eyes
looked
at
*NL*
the
crowd
without
seeking
anyone
,
and
her
delicate
arm
,
bare
to
above
*NL*
the
elbow
,
lay
on
the
velvet
edge
of
the
box
,
while
,
evidently
*NL*
unconsciously
,
she
opened
and
closed
her
hand
in
time
to
the
music
,
*NL*
crumpling
her
program
.
``
Look
,
there
's
Alenina
,
''
said
Sonya
,
``
with
her
*NL*
mother
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
Michael
Kirilovich
has
grown
still
stouter
!
''
remarked
the
*NL*
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
our
Anna
Mikhaylovna
--
what
a
headdress
she
has
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Karagins
,
Julie
--
and
Boris
with
them
.
One
can
see
at
once
that
*NL*
they
're
engaged
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drubetskoy
has
proposed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
heard
it
today
,
''
said
Shinshin
,
coming
into
the
Rostovs
'
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
her
father
's
eyes
were
turned
*NL*
and
saw
Julie
sitting
beside
her
mother
with
a
happy
look
on
her
face
*NL*
and
a
string
of
pearls
round
her
thick
red
neck
--
which
Natasha
knew
was
*NL*
covered
with
powder
.
Behind
them
,
wearing
a
smile
and
leaning
over
with
*NL*
an
ear
to
Julie
's
mouth
,
was
Boris
'
handsome
smoothly
brushed
head
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
the
Rostovs
from
under
his
brows
and
said
something
,
smiling
,
*NL*
to
his
betrothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
talking
about
us
,
about
me
and
him
!
''
thought
Natasha
.
``
And
he
*NL*
no
doubt
is
calming
her
jealousy
of
me
.
They
need
n't
trouble
themselves
!
*NL*
If
only
they
knew
how
little
I
am
concerned
about
any
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
them
sat
Anna
Mikhaylovna
wearing
a
green
headdress
and
with
a
*NL*
happy
look
of
resignation
to
the
will
of
God
on
her
face
.
Their
box
was
*NL*
pervaded
by
that
atmosphere
of
an
affianced
couple
which
Natasha
knew
so
*NL*
well
and
liked
so
much
.
She
turned
away
and
suddenly
remembered
all
that
*NL*
had
been
so
humiliating
in
her
morning
's
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
right
has
he
not
to
wish
to
receive
me
into
his
family
?
Oh
,
better
*NL*
not
think
of
it
--
not
till
he
comes
back
!
''
she
told
herself
,
and
began
*NL*
looking
at
the
faces
,
some
strange
and
some
familiar
,
in
the
stalls
.
In
*NL*
the
front
,
in
the
very
center
,
leaning
back
against
the
orchestra
rail
,
*NL*
stood
Dolokhov
in
a
Persian
dress
,
his
curly
hair
brushed
up
into
a
huge
*NL*
shock
.
He
stood
in
full
view
of
the
audience
,
well
aware
that
he
was
*NL*
attracting
everyone
's
attention
,
yet
as
much
at
ease
as
though
he
were
*NL*
in
his
own
room
.
Around
him
thronged
Moscow
's
most
brilliant
young
men
,
*NL*
whom
he
evidently
dominated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
,
laughing
,
nudged
the
blushing
Sonya
and
pointed
to
her
former
*NL*
adorer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
recognize
him
?
''
said
he
.
``
And
where
has
he
sprung
from
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
turning
to
Shinshin
.
``
Did
n't
he
vanish
somewhere
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
,
''
replied
Shinshin
.
``
He
was
in
the
Caucasus
and
ran
away
from
*NL*
there
.
They
say
he
has
been
acting
as
minister
to
some
ruling
prince
in
*NL*
Persia
,
where
he
killed
the
Shah
's
brother
.
Now
all
the
Moscow
ladies
*NL*
are
mad
about
him
!
It
's
`
Dolokhov
the
Persian
'
that
does
it
!
We
never
*NL*
hear
a
word
but
Dolokhov
is
mentioned
.
They
swear
by
him
,
they
offer
him
*NL*
to
you
as
they
would
a
dish
of
choice
sterlet
.
Dolokhov
and
Anatole
*NL*
Kuragin
have
turned
all
our
ladies
'
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
,
beautiful
woman
with
a
mass
of
plaited
hair
and
much
exposed
*NL*
plump
white
shoulders
and
neck
,
round
which
she
wore
a
double
string
of
*NL*
large
pearls
,
entered
the
adjoining
box
rustling
her
heavy
silk
dress
*NL*
and
took
a
long
time
settling
into
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
involuntarily
gazed
at
that
neck
,
those
shoulders
,
and
pearls
*NL*
and
coiffure
,
and
admired
the
beauty
of
the
shoulders
and
the
pearls
.
*NL*
While
Natasha
was
fixing
her
gaze
on
her
for
the
second
time
the
lady
*NL*
looked
round
and
,
meeting
the
count
's
eyes
,
nodded
to
him
and
smiled
.
*NL*
She
was
the
Countess
Bezukhova
,
Pierre
's
wife
,
and
the
count
,
who
knew
*NL*
everyone
in
society
,
leaned
over
and
spoke
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
here
long
,
Countess
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
I
'll
call
,
I
'll
call
*NL*
to
kiss
your
hand
.
I
'm
here
on
business
and
have
brought
my
girls
with
*NL*
me
.
They
say
Semenova
acts
marvelously
.
Count
Pierre
never
used
to
*NL*
forget
us
.
Is
he
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
meant
to
look
in
,
''
answered
Helene
,
and
glanced
attentively
at
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostov
resumed
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
,
is
n't
she
?
''
he
whispered
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderful
!
''
answered
Natasha
.
``
She
's
a
woman
one
could
easily
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
last
chords
of
the
overture
were
heard
and
the
conductor
*NL*
tapped
with
his
stick
.
Some
latecomers
took
their
seats
in
the
stalls
,
*NL*
and
the
curtain
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
rose
everyone
in
the
boxes
and
stalls
became
silent
,
and
*NL*
all
the
men
,
old
and
young
,
in
uniform
and
evening
dress
,
and
all
the
*NL*
women
with
gems
on
their
bare
flesh
,
turned
their
whole
attention
with
*NL*
eager
curiosity
to
the
stage
.
Natasha
too
began
to
look
at
it
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
floor
of
the
stage
consisted
of
smooth
boards
,
at
the
sides
was
some
*NL*
painted
cardboard
representing
trees
,
and
at
the
back
was
a
cloth
*NL*
stretched
over
boards
.
In
the
center
of
the
stage
sat
some
girls
in
red
*NL*
bodices
and
white
skirts
.
One
very
fat
girl
in
a
white
silk
dress
sat
*NL*
apart
on
a
low
bench
,
to
the
back
of
which
a
piece
of
green
cardboard
*NL*
was
glued
.
They
all
sang
something
.
When
they
had
finished
their
song
*NL*
the
girl
in
white
went
up
to
the
prompter
's
box
and
a
man
with
tight
*NL*
silk
trousers
over
his
stout
legs
,
and
holding
a
plume
and
a
dagger
,
*NL*
went
up
to
her
and
began
singing
,
waving
his
arms
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
the
man
in
the
tight
trousers
sang
alone
,
then
she
sang
,
then
they
*NL*
both
paused
while
the
orchestra
played
and
the
man
fingered
the
hand
of
*NL*
the
girl
in
white
,
obviously
awaiting
the
beat
to
start
singing
with
*NL*
her
.
They
sang
together
and
everyone
in
the
theater
began
clapping
and
*NL*
shouting
,
while
the
man
and
woman
on
the
stage
--
who
represented
lovers
--
*NL*
began
smiling
,
spreading
out
their
arms
,
and
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
life
in
the
country
,
and
in
her
present
serious
mood
,
all
this
*NL*
seemed
grotesque
and
amazing
to
Natasha
.
She
could
not
follow
the
opera
*NL*
nor
even
listen
to
the
music
;
she
saw
only
the
painted
cardboard
and
the
*NL*
queerly
dressed
men
and
women
who
moved
,
spoke
,
and
sang
so
strangely
in
*NL*
that
brilliant
light
.
She
knew
what
it
was
all
meant
to
represent
,
but
*NL*
it
was
so
pretentiously
false
and
unnatural
that
she
first
felt
ashamed
*NL*
for
the
actors
and
then
amused
at
them
.
She
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
*NL*
audience
,
seeking
in
them
the
same
sense
of
ridicule
and
perplexity
she
*NL*
herself
experienced
,
but
they
all
seemed
attentive
to
what
was
happening
*NL*
on
the
stage
,
and
expressed
delight
which
to
Natasha
seemed
feigned
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
it
has
to
be
like
this
!
''
she
thought
.
She
kept
looking
round
in
*NL*
turn
at
the
rows
of
pomaded
heads
in
the
stalls
and
then
at
the
seminude
*NL*
women
in
the
boxes
,
especially
at
Helene
in
the
next
box
,
who
--
*NL*
apparently
quite
unclothed
--
sat
with
a
quiet
tranquil
smile
,
not
taking
*NL*
her
eyes
off
the
stage
.
And
feeling
the
bright
light
that
flooded
the
*NL*
whole
place
and
the
warm
air
heated
by
the
crowd
,
Natasha
little
by
*NL*
little
began
to
pass
into
a
state
of
intoxication
she
had
not
*NL*
experienced
for
a
long
while
.
She
did
not
realize
who
and
where
she
was
,
*NL*
nor
what
was
going
on
before
her
.
As
she
looked
and
thought
,
the
*NL*
strangest
fancies
unexpectedly
and
disconnectedly
passed
through
her
*NL*
mind
:
the
idea
occurred
to
her
of
jumping
onto
the
edge
of
the
box
and
*NL*
singing
the
air
the
actress
was
singing
,
then
she
wished
to
touch
with
*NL*
her
fan
an
old
gentleman
sitting
not
far
from
her
,
then
to
lean
over
to
*NL*
Helene
and
tickle
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
moment
when
all
was
quiet
before
the
commencement
of
a
song
,
a
door
*NL*
leading
to
the
stalls
on
the
side
nearest
the
Rostovs
'
box
creaked
,
and
*NL*
the
steps
of
a
belated
arrival
were
heard
.
``
There
's
Kuragin
!
''
whispered
*NL*
Shinshin
.
Countess
Bezukhova
turned
smiling
to
the
newcomer
,
and
*NL*
Natasha
,
following
the
direction
of
that
look
,
saw
an
exceptionally
*NL*
handsome
adjutant
approaching
their
box
with
a
self-assured
yet
*NL*
courteous
bearing
.
This
was
Anatole
Kuragin
whom
she
had
seen
and
*NL*
noticed
long
ago
at
the
ball
in
Petersburg
.
He
was
now
in
an
adjutant
's
*NL*
uniform
with
one
epaulet
and
a
shoulder
knot
.
He
moved
with
a
restrained
*NL*
swagger
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
had
he
not
been
so
good-looking
*NL*
and
had
his
handsome
face
not
worn
such
an
expression
of
good-humored
*NL*
complacency
and
gaiety
.
Though
the
performance
was
proceeding
,
he
walked
*NL*
deliberately
down
the
carpeted
gangway
,
his
sword
and
spurs
slightly
*NL*
jingling
and
his
handsome
perfumed
head
held
high
.
Having
looked
at
*NL*
Natasha
he
approached
his
sister
,
laid
his
well
gloved
hand
on
the
edge
*NL*
of
her
box
,
nodded
to
her
,
and
leaning
forward
asked
a
question
,
with
a
*NL*
motion
toward
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
charmante
!
''
said
he
,
evidently
referring
to
Natasha
,
who
did
not
*NL*
exactly
hear
his
words
but
understood
them
from
the
movement
of
his
*NL*
lips
.
Then
he
took
his
place
in
the
first
row
of
the
stalls
and
sat
down
*NL*
beside
Dolokhov
,
nudging
with
his
elbow
in
a
friendly
and
offhand
way
*NL*
that
Dolokhov
whom
others
treated
so
fawningly
.
He
winked
at
him
gaily
,
*NL*
smiled
,
and
rested
his
foot
against
the
orchestra
screen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
like
the
brother
is
to
the
sister
,
''
remarked
the
count
.
``
And
how
*NL*
handsome
they
both
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shinshin
,
lowering
his
voice
,
began
to
tell
the
count
of
some
intrigue
*NL*
of
Kuragin
's
in
Moscow
,
and
Natasha
tried
to
overhear
it
just
because
he
*NL*
had
said
she
was
``
charmante
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
act
was
over
.
In
the
stalls
everyone
began
moving
about
,
going
*NL*
out
and
coming
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
came
to
the
Rostovs
'
box
,
received
their
congratulations
very
*NL*
simply
,
and
raising
his
eyebrows
with
an
absent-minded
smile
conveyed
to
*NL*
Natasha
and
Sonya
his
fiancee
's
invitation
to
her
wedding
,
and
went
*NL*
away
.
Natasha
with
a
gay
,
coquettish
smile
talked
to
him
,
and
*NL*
congratulated
on
his
approaching
wedding
that
same
Boris
with
whom
she
*NL*
had
formerly
been
in
love
.
In
the
state
of
intoxication
she
was
in
,
*NL*
everything
seemed
simple
and
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scantily
clad
Helene
smiled
at
everyone
in
the
same
way
,
and
Natasha
*NL*
gave
Boris
a
similar
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
's
box
was
filled
and
surrounded
from
the
stalls
by
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
and
intellectual
men
,
who
seemed
to
vie
with
one
another
*NL*
in
their
wish
to
let
everyone
see
that
they
knew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
that
entr
`
acte
Kuragin
stood
with
Dolokhov
in
front
*NL*
of
the
orchestra
partition
,
looking
at
the
Rostovs
'
box
.
Natasha
knew
he
*NL*
was
talking
about
her
and
this
afforded
her
pleasure
.
She
even
turned
so
*NL*
that
he
should
see
her
profile
in
what
she
thought
was
its
most
becoming
*NL*
aspect
.
Before
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
Pierre
appeared
in
the
*NL*
stalls
.
The
Rostovs
had
not
seen
him
since
their
arrival
.
His
face
*NL*
looked
sad
,
and
he
had
grown
still
stouter
since
Natasha
last
saw
him
.
*NL*
He
passed
up
to
the
front
rows
,
not
noticing
anyone
.
Anatole
went
up
to
*NL*
him
and
began
speaking
to
him
,
looking
at
and
indicating
the
Rostovs
'
*NL*
box
.
On
seeing
Natasha
Pierre
grew
animated
and
,
hastily
passing
between
*NL*
the
rows
,
came
toward
their
box
.
When
he
got
there
he
leaned
on
his
*NL*
elbows
and
,
smiling
,
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
.
While
conversing
*NL*
with
Pierre
,
Natasha
heard
a
man
's
voice
in
Countess
Bezukhova
's
box
and
*NL*
something
told
her
it
was
Kuragin
.
She
turned
and
their
eyes
met
.
Almost
*NL*
smiling
,
he
gazed
straight
into
her
eyes
with
such
an
enraptured
*NL*
caressing
look
that
it
seemed
strange
to
be
so
near
him
,
to
look
at
him
*NL*
like
that
,
to
be
so
sure
he
admired
her
,
and
not
to
be
acquainted
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
act
there
was
scenery
representing
tombstones
,
there
was
a
*NL*
round
hole
in
the
canvas
to
represent
the
moon
,
shades
were
raised
over
*NL*
the
footlights
,
and
from
horns
and
contrabass
came
deep
notes
while
many
*NL*
people
appeared
from
right
and
left
wearing
black
cloaks
and
holding
*NL*
things
like
daggers
in
their
hands
.
They
began
waving
their
arms
.
Then
*NL*
some
other
people
ran
in
and
began
dragging
away
the
maiden
who
had
been
*NL*
in
white
and
was
now
in
light
blue
.
They
did
not
drag
her
away
at
once
,
*NL*
but
sang
with
her
for
a
long
time
and
then
at
last
dragged
her
off
,
and
*NL*
behind
the
scenes
something
metallic
was
struck
three
times
and
everyone
*NL*
knelt
down
and
sang
a
prayer
.
All
these
things
were
repeatedly
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
enthusiastic
shouts
of
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
act
every
time
Natasha
looked
toward
the
stalls
she
saw
*NL*
Anatole
Kuragin
with
an
arm
thrown
across
the
back
of
his
chair
,
staring
*NL*
at
her
.
She
was
pleased
to
see
that
he
was
captivated
by
her
and
it
did
*NL*
not
occur
to
her
that
there
was
anything
wrong
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
second
act
was
over
Countess
Bezukhova
rose
,
turned
to
the
*NL*
Rostovs
'
box
--
her
whole
bosom
completely
exposed
--
beckoned
the
old
count
*NL*
with
a
gloved
finger
,
and
paying
no
attention
to
those
who
had
entered
*NL*
her
box
began
talking
to
him
with
an
amiable
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
make
me
acquainted
with
your
charming
daughters
,
''
said
she
.
``
The
*NL*
whole
town
is
singing
their
praises
and
I
do
n't
even
know
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
rose
and
curtsied
to
the
splendid
countess
.
She
was
so
pleased
*NL*
by
praise
from
this
brilliant
beauty
that
she
blushed
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
become
a
Moscovite
too
,
now
,
''
said
Helene
.
``
How
is
it
you
're
*NL*
not
ashamed
to
bury
such
pearls
in
the
country
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Bezukhova
quite
deserved
her
reputation
of
being
a
fascinating
*NL*
woman
.
She
could
say
what
she
did
not
think
--
especially
what
was
*NL*
flattering
--
quite
simply
and
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
count
,
you
must
let
me
look
after
your
daughters
!
Though
I
am
not
*NL*
staying
here
long
this
time
--
nor
are
you
--
I
will
try
to
amuse
them
.
I
*NL*
have
already
heard
much
of
you
in
Petersburg
and
wanted
to
get
to
know
*NL*
you
,
''
said
she
to
Natasha
with
her
stereotyped
and
lovely
smile
.
``
I
had
*NL*
heard
about
you
from
my
page
,
Drubetskoy
.
Have
you
heard
he
is
getting
*NL*
married
?
And
also
from
my
husband
's
friend
Bolkonski
,
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
''
she
went
on
with
special
emphasis
,
implying
that
she
knew
of
*NL*
his
relation
to
Natasha
.
To
get
better
acquainted
she
asked
that
one
of
*NL*
the
young
ladies
should
come
into
her
box
for
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
performance
,
and
Natasha
moved
over
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
of
the
third
act
represented
a
palace
in
which
many
candles
*NL*
were
burning
and
pictures
of
knights
with
short
beards
hung
on
the
*NL*
walls
.
In
the
middle
stood
what
were
probably
a
king
and
a
queen
.
The
*NL*
king
waved
his
right
arm
and
,
evidently
nervous
,
sang
something
badly
*NL*
and
sat
down
on
a
crimson
throne
.
The
maiden
who
had
been
first
in
white
*NL*
and
then
in
light
blue
,
now
wore
only
a
smock
,
and
stood
beside
the
*NL*
throne
with
her
hair
down
.
She
sang
something
mournfully
,
addressing
the
*NL*
queen
,
but
the
king
waved
his
arm
severely
,
and
men
and
women
with
bare
*NL*
legs
came
in
from
both
sides
and
began
dancing
all
together
.
Then
the
*NL*
violins
played
very
shrilly
and
merrily
and
one
of
the
women
with
thick
*NL*
bare
legs
and
thin
arms
,
separating
from
the
others
,
went
behind
the
*NL*
wings
,
adjusted
her
bodice
,
returned
to
the
middle
of
the
stage
,
and
*NL*
began
jumping
and
striking
one
foot
rapidly
against
the
other
.
In
the
*NL*
stalls
everyone
clapped
and
shouted
``
bravo
!
''
Then
one
of
the
men
went
*NL*
into
a
corner
of
the
stage
.
The
cymbals
and
horns
in
the
orchestra
*NL*
struck
up
more
loudly
,
and
this
man
with
bare
legs
jumped
very
high
and
*NL*
waved
his
feet
about
very
rapidly
.
-LRB-
He
was
Duport
,
who
received
sixty
*NL*
thousand
rubles
a
year
for
this
art
.
-RRB-
Everybody
in
the
stalls
,
boxes
,
*NL*
and
galleries
began
clapping
and
shouting
with
all
their
might
,
and
the
*NL*
man
stopped
and
began
smiling
and
bowing
to
all
sides
.
Then
other
men
*NL*
and
women
danced
with
bare
legs
.
Then
the
king
again
shouted
to
the
*NL*
sound
of
music
,
and
they
all
began
singing
.
But
suddenly
a
storm
came
*NL*
on
,
chromatic
scales
and
diminished
sevenths
were
heard
in
the
*NL*
orchestra
,
everyone
ran
off
,
again
dragging
one
of
their
number
away
,
*NL*
and
the
curtain
dropped
.
Once
more
there
was
a
terrible
noise
and
*NL*
clatter
among
the
audience
,
and
with
rapturous
faces
everyone
began
*NL*
shouting
:
``
Duport
!
Duport
!
Duport
!
''
Natasha
no
longer
thought
this
*NL*
strange
.
She
looked
about
with
pleasure
,
smiling
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
Duport
delightful
?
''
Helene
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
replied
Natasha
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
entr
`
acte
a
whiff
of
cold
air
came
into
Helene
's
box
,
the
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
Anatole
entered
,
stooping
and
trying
not
to
brush
*NL*
against
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
introduce
my
brother
to
you
,
''
said
Helene
,
her
eyes
shifting
*NL*
uneasily
from
Natasha
to
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
turned
her
pretty
little
head
toward
the
elegant
young
officer
*NL*
and
smiled
at
him
over
her
bare
shoulder
.
Anatole
,
who
was
as
handsome
*NL*
at
close
quarters
as
at
a
distance
,
sat
down
beside
her
and
told
her
he
*NL*
had
long
wished
to
have
this
happiness
--
ever
since
the
Naryshkins
'
ball
*NL*
in
fact
,
at
which
he
had
had
the
well-remembered
pleasure
of
seeing
her
.
*NL*
Kuragin
was
much
more
sensible
and
simple
with
women
than
among
men
.
He
*NL*
talked
boldly
and
naturally
,
and
Natasha
was
strangely
and
agreeably
*NL*
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
formidable
in
this
man
about
*NL*
whom
there
was
so
much
talk
,
but
that
on
the
contrary
his
smile
was
most
*NL*
naive
,
cheerful
,
and
good-natured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kuragin
asked
her
opinion
of
the
performance
and
told
her
how
at
a
*NL*
previous
performance
Semenova
had
fallen
down
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
Countess
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
addressing
her
as
an
old
,
*NL*
familiar
acquaintance
,
``
we
are
getting
up
a
costume
tournament
;
you
*NL*
ought
to
take
part
in
it
!
It
will
be
great
fun
.
We
shall
all
meet
at
the
*NL*
Karagins
'
!
Please
come
!
No
!
Really
,
eh
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
saying
this
he
never
removed
his
smiling
eyes
from
her
face
,
her
*NL*
neck
,
and
her
bare
arms
.
Natasha
knew
for
certain
that
he
was
enraptured
*NL*
by
her
.
This
pleased
her
,
yet
his
presence
made
her
feel
constrained
and
*NL*
oppressed
.
When
she
was
not
looking
at
him
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
*NL*
at
her
shoulders
,
and
she
involuntarily
caught
his
eye
so
that
he
should
*NL*
look
into
hers
rather
than
this
.
But
looking
into
his
eyes
she
was
*NL*
frightened
,
realizing
that
there
was
not
that
barrier
of
modesty
she
had
*NL*
always
felt
between
herself
and
other
men
.
She
did
not
know
how
it
was
*NL*
that
within
five
minutes
she
had
come
to
feel
herself
terribly
near
to
*NL*
this
man
.
When
she
turned
away
she
feared
he
might
seize
her
from
behind
*NL*
by
her
bare
arm
and
kiss
her
on
the
neck
.
They
spoke
of
most
ordinary
*NL*
things
,
yet
she
felt
that
they
were
closer
to
one
another
than
she
had
*NL*
ever
been
to
any
man
.
Natasha
kept
turning
to
Helene
and
to
her
father
,
*NL*
as
if
asking
what
it
all
meant
,
but
Helene
was
engaged
in
conversation
*NL*
with
a
general
and
did
not
answer
her
look
,
and
her
father
's
eyes
said
*NL*
nothing
but
what
they
always
said
:
``
Having
a
good
time
?
Well
,
I
'm
glad
*NL*
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
one
of
these
moments
of
awkward
silence
when
Anatole
's
prominent
*NL*
eyes
were
gazing
calmly
and
fixedly
at
her
,
Natasha
,
to
break
the
*NL*
silence
,
asked
him
how
he
liked
Moscow
.
She
asked
the
question
and
*NL*
blushed
.
She
felt
all
the
time
that
by
talking
to
him
she
was
doing
*NL*
something
improper
.
Anatole
smiled
as
though
to
encourage
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
first
I
did
not
like
it
much
,
because
what
makes
a
town
pleasant
ce
*NL*
sont
les
jolies
femmes
,
*
is
n't
that
so
?
But
now
I
like
it
very
much
*NL*
indeed
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
significantly
.
``
You
'll
come
to
the
*NL*
costume
tournament
,
Countess
?
Do
come
!
''
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
her
*NL*
bouquet
and
dropping
his
voice
,
he
added
,
``
You
will
be
the
prettiest
*NL*
there
.
Do
come
,
dear
countess
,
and
give
me
this
flower
as
a
pledge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Are
the
pretty
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
any
more
than
he
did
*NL*
himself
,
but
she
felt
that
his
incomprehensible
words
had
an
improper
*NL*
intention
.
She
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
turned
away
as
if
she
had
*NL*
not
heard
his
remark
.
But
as
soon
as
she
had
turned
away
she
felt
that
*NL*
he
was
there
,
behind
,
so
close
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
he
now
?
Confused
?
Angry
?
Ought
I
to
put
it
right
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
herself
,
and
she
could
not
refrain
from
turning
round
.
She
looked
*NL*
straight
into
his
eyes
,
and
his
nearness
,
self-assurance
,
and
the
good
-
*NL*
natured
tenderness
of
his
smile
vanquished
her
.
She
smiled
just
as
he
*NL*
was
doing
,
gazing
straight
into
his
eyes
.
And
again
she
felt
with
horror
*NL*
that
no
barrier
lay
between
him
and
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtain
rose
again
.
Anatole
left
the
box
,
serene
and
gay
.
Natasha
*NL*
went
back
to
her
father
in
the
other
box
,
now
quite
submissive
to
the
*NL*
world
she
found
herself
in
.
All
that
was
going
on
before
her
now
seemed
*NL*
quite
natural
,
but
on
the
other
hand
all
her
previous
thoughts
of
her
*NL*
betrothed
,
of
Princess
Mary
,
or
of
life
in
the
country
did
not
once
*NL*
recur
to
her
mind
and
were
as
if
belonging
to
a
remote
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fourth
act
there
was
some
sort
of
devil
who
sang
waving
his
arm
*NL*
about
,
till
the
boards
were
withdrawn
from
under
him
and
he
disappeared
*NL*
down
below
.
That
was
the
only
part
of
the
fourth
act
that
Natasha
saw
.
*NL*
She
felt
agitated
and
tormented
,
and
the
cause
of
this
was
Kuragin
whom
*NL*
she
could
not
help
watching
.
As
they
were
leaving
the
theater
Anatole
*NL*
came
up
to
them
,
called
their
carriage
,
and
helped
them
in
.
As
he
was
*NL*
putting
Natasha
in
he
pressed
her
arm
above
the
elbow
.
Agitated
and
*NL*
flushed
she
turned
round
.
He
was
looking
at
her
with
glittering
eyes
,
*NL*
smiling
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
after
she
had
reached
home
was
Natasha
able
clearly
to
think
over
*NL*
what
had
happened
to
her
,
and
suddenly
remembering
Prince
Andrew
she
was
*NL*
horrified
,
and
at
tea
to
which
all
had
sat
down
after
the
opera
,
she
*NL*
gave
a
loud
exclamation
,
flushed
,
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
I
am
lost
!
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
How
could
I
let
him
?
''
She
sat
*NL*
for
a
long
time
hiding
her
flushed
face
in
her
hands
trying
to
realize
*NL*
what
had
happened
to
her
,
but
was
unable
either
to
understand
what
had
*NL*
happened
or
what
she
felt
.
Everything
seemed
dark
,
obscure
,
and
*NL*
terrible
.
There
in
that
enormous
,
illuminated
theater
where
the
bare
-
*NL*
legged
Duport
,
in
a
tinsel-decorated
jacket
,
jumped
about
to
the
music
*NL*
on
wet
boards
,
and
young
girls
and
old
men
,
and
the
nearly
naked
Helene
*NL*
with
her
proud
,
calm
smile
,
rapturously
cried
``
bravo
!
''
--
there
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
that
Helene
it
had
all
seemed
clear
and
simple
;
but
now
,
*NL*
alone
by
herself
,
it
was
incomprehensible
.
``
What
is
it
?
What
was
that
*NL*
terror
I
felt
of
him
?
What
is
this
gnawing
of
conscience
I
am
feeling
*NL*
now
?
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
to
the
old
countess
at
night
in
bed
could
Natasha
have
told
all
she
*NL*
was
feeling
.
She
knew
that
Sonya
with
her
severe
and
simple
views
would
*NL*
either
not
understand
it
at
all
or
would
be
horrified
at
such
a
*NL*
confession
.
So
Natasha
tried
to
solve
what
was
torturing
her
by
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
spoiled
for
Andrew
's
love
or
not
?
''
she
asked
herself
,
and
with
*NL*
soothing
irony
replied
:
``
What
a
fool
I
am
to
ask
that
!
What
did
happen
*NL*
to
me
?
Nothing
!
I
have
done
nothing
,
I
did
n't
lead
him
on
at
all
.
Nobody
*NL*
will
know
and
I
shall
never
see
him
again
,
''
she
told
herself
.
``
So
it
is
*NL*
plain
that
nothing
has
happened
and
there
is
nothing
to
repent
of
,
and
*NL*
Andrew
can
love
me
still
.
But
why
`
still
?
'
O
God
,
why
is
n't
he
here
?
''
*NL*
Natasha
quieted
herself
for
a
moment
,
but
again
some
instinct
told
her
*NL*
that
though
all
this
was
true
,
and
though
nothing
had
happened
,
yet
the
*NL*
former
purity
of
her
love
for
Prince
Andrew
had
perished
.
And
again
in
*NL*
imagination
she
went
over
her
whole
conversation
with
Kuragin
,
and
again
*NL*
saw
the
face
,
gestures
,
and
tender
smile
of
that
bold
handsome
man
when
*NL*
he
pressed
her
arm
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
Kuragin
was
staying
in
Moscow
because
his
father
had
sent
him
*NL*
away
from
Petersburg
,
where
he
had
been
spending
twenty
thousand
rubles
*NL*
a
year
in
cash
,
besides
running
up
debts
for
as
much
more
,
which
his
*NL*
creditors
demanded
from
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
announced
to
him
that
he
would
now
pay
half
his
debts
for
the
*NL*
last
time
,
but
only
on
condition
that
he
went
to
Moscow
as
adjutant
to
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
--
a
post
his
father
had
procured
for
him
--
and
*NL*
would
at
last
try
to
make
a
good
match
there
.
He
indicated
to
him
*NL*
Princess
Mary
and
Julie
Karagina
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
consented
and
went
to
Moscow
,
where
he
put
up
at
Pierre
's
house
.
*NL*
Pierre
received
him
unwillingly
at
first
,
but
got
used
to
him
after
a
*NL*
while
,
sometimes
even
accompanied
him
on
his
carousals
,
and
gave
him
*NL*
money
under
the
guise
of
loans
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Shinshin
had
remarked
,
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
Anatole
had
*NL*
turned
the
heads
of
the
Moscow
ladies
,
especially
by
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
slighted
them
and
plainly
preferred
the
gypsy
girls
and
French
*NL*
actresses
--
with
the
chief
of
whom
,
Mademoiselle
George
,
he
was
said
to
*NL*
be
on
intimate
relations
.
He
had
never
missed
a
carousal
at
Danilov
's
or
*NL*
other
Moscow
revelers
'
,
drank
whole
nights
through
,
outvying
everyone
*NL*
else
,
and
was
at
all
the
balls
and
parties
of
the
best
society
.
There
*NL*
was
talk
of
his
intrigues
with
some
of
the
ladies
,
and
he
flirted
with
a
*NL*
few
of
them
at
the
balls
.
But
he
did
not
run
after
the
unmarried
girls
,
*NL*
especially
the
rich
heiresses
who
were
most
of
them
plain
.
There
was
a
*NL*
special
reason
for
this
,
as
he
had
got
married
two
years
before
--
a
fact
*NL*
known
only
to
his
most
intimate
friends
.
At
that
time
while
with
his
*NL*
regiment
in
Poland
,
a
Polish
landowner
of
small
means
had
forced
him
to
*NL*
marry
his
daughter
.
Anatole
had
very
soon
abandoned
his
wife
and
,
for
a
*NL*
payment
which
he
agreed
to
send
to
his
father-in-law
,
had
arranged
to
be
*NL*
free
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
was
always
content
with
his
position
,
with
himself
,
and
with
*NL*
others
.
He
was
instinctively
and
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
him
to
live
otherwise
than
as
he
did
and
that
he
had
*NL*
never
in
his
life
done
anything
base
.
He
was
incapable
of
considering
*NL*
how
his
actions
might
affect
others
or
what
the
consequences
of
this
or
*NL*
that
action
of
his
might
be
.
He
was
convinced
that
,
as
a
duck
is
so
made
*NL*
that
it
must
live
in
water
,
so
God
had
made
him
such
that
he
must
spend
*NL*
thirty
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
always
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
*NL*
society
.
He
believed
this
so
firmly
that
others
,
looking
at
him
,
were
*NL*
persuaded
of
it
too
and
did
not
refuse
him
either
a
leading
place
in
*NL*
society
or
money
,
which
he
borrowed
from
anyone
and
everyone
and
*NL*
evidently
would
not
repay
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
a
gambler
,
at
any
rate
he
did
not
care
about
winning
.
He
was
*NL*
not
vain
.
He
did
not
mind
what
people
thought
of
him
.
Still
less
could
*NL*
he
be
accused
of
ambition
.
More
than
once
he
had
vexed
his
father
by
*NL*
spoiling
his
own
career
,
and
he
laughed
at
distinctions
of
all
kinds
.
He
*NL*
was
not
mean
,
and
did
not
refuse
anyone
who
asked
of
him
.
All
he
cared
*NL*
about
was
gaiety
and
women
,
and
as
according
to
his
ideas
there
was
*NL*
nothing
dishonorable
in
these
tastes
,
and
he
was
incapable
of
*NL*
considering
what
the
gratification
of
his
tastes
entailed
for
others
,
he
*NL*
honestly
considered
himself
irreproachable
,
sincerely
despised
rogues
*NL*
and
bad
people
,
and
with
a
tranquil
conscience
carried
his
head
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rakes
,
those
male
Magdalenes
,
have
a
secret
feeling
of
innocence
similar
*NL*
to
that
which
female
Magdalenes
have
,
based
on
the
same
hope
of
*NL*
forgiveness
.
``
All
will
be
forgiven
her
,
for
she
loved
much
;
and
all
will
*NL*
be
forgiven
him
,
for
he
enjoyed
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
who
had
reappeared
that
year
in
Moscow
after
his
exile
and
his
*NL*
Persian
adventures
,
and
was
leading
a
life
of
luxury
,
gambling
,
and
*NL*
dissipation
,
associated
with
his
old
Petersburg
comrade
Kuragin
and
made
*NL*
use
of
him
for
his
own
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
was
sincerely
fond
of
Dolokhov
for
his
cleverness
and
audacity
.
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
who
needed
Anatole
Kuragin
's
name
,
position
,
and
connections
*NL*
as
a
bait
to
draw
rich
young
men
into
his
gambling
set
,
made
use
of
him
*NL*
and
amused
himself
at
his
expense
without
letting
the
other
feel
it
.
*NL*
Apart
from
the
advantage
he
derived
from
Anatole
,
the
very
process
of
*NL*
dominating
another
's
will
was
in
itself
a
pleasure
,
a
habit
,
and
a
*NL*
necessity
to
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
had
made
a
strong
impression
on
Kuragin
.
At
supper
after
the
*NL*
opera
he
described
to
Dolokhov
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
the
*NL*
attractions
of
her
arms
,
shoulders
,
feet
,
and
hair
and
expressed
his
*NL*
intention
of
making
love
to
her
.
Anatole
had
no
notion
and
was
incapable
*NL*
of
considering
what
might
come
of
such
love-making
,
as
he
never
had
any
*NL*
notion
of
the
outcome
of
any
of
his
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
first-rate
,
my
dear
fellow
,
but
not
for
us
,
''
replied
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
my
sister
to
ask
her
to
dinner
,
''
said
Anatole
.
``
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
wait
till
she
's
married
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
I
adore
little
girls
,
they
lose
their
heads
at
once
,
''
pursued
*NL*
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
caught
once
already
by
a
`
little
girl
,
'
''
said
Dolokhov
*NL*
who
knew
of
Kuragin
's
marriage
.
``
Take
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
ca
n't
happen
twice
!
Eh
?

said
Anatole
,
with
a
good-humored
*NL*
laugh

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
the
opera
the
Rostovs
went
nowhere
and
nobody
came
to
see
*NL*
them
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
talked
to
the
count
about
something
which
they
*NL*
concealed
from
Natasha
.
Natasha
guessed
they
were
talking
about
the
old
*NL*
prince
and
planning
something
,
and
this
disquieted
and
offended
her
.
She
*NL*
was
expecting
Prince
Andrew
any
moment
and
twice
that
day
sent
a
*NL*
manservant
to
the
Vozdvizhenka
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
come
.
He
had
*NL*
not
arrived
.
She
suffered
more
now
than
during
her
first
days
in
Moscow
.
*NL*
To
her
impatience
and
pining
for
him
were
now
added
the
unpleasant
*NL*
recollection
of
her
interview
with
Princess
Mary
and
the
old
prince
,
and
*NL*
a
fear
and
anxiety
of
which
she
did
not
understand
the
cause
.
She
*NL*
continually
fancied
that
either
he
would
never
come
or
that
something
*NL*
would
happen
to
her
before
he
came
.
She
could
no
longer
think
of
him
by
*NL*
herself
calmly
and
continuously
as
she
had
done
before
.
As
soon
as
she
*NL*
began
to
think
of
him
,
the
recollection
of
the
old
prince
,
of
Princess
*NL*
Mary
,
of
the
theater
,
and
of
Kuragin
mingled
with
her
thoughts
.
The
*NL*
question
again
presented
itself
whether
she
was
not
guilty
,
whether
she
*NL*
had
not
already
broken
faith
with
Prince
Andrew
,
and
again
she
found
*NL*
herself
recalling
to
the
minutest
detail
every
word
,
every
gesture
,
and
*NL*
every
shade
in
the
play
of
expression
on
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
*NL*
been
able
to
arouse
in
her
such
an
incomprehensible
and
terrifying
*NL*
feeling
.
To
the
family
Natasha
seemed
livelier
than
usual
,
but
she
was
*NL*
far
less
tranquil
and
happy
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
morning
Marya
Dmitrievna
invited
her
visitors
to
Mass
at
her
*NL*
parish
church
--
the
Church
of
the
Assumption
built
over
the
graves
of
*NL*
victims
of
the
plague
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
those
fashionable
churches
,
''
she
said
,
evidently
priding
*NL*
herself
on
her
independence
of
thought
.
``
God
is
the
same
everywhere
.
We
*NL*
have
an
excellent
priest
,
he
conducts
the
service
decently
and
with
*NL*
dignity
,
and
the
deacon
is
the
same
.
What
holiness
is
there
in
giving
*NL*
concerts
in
the
choir
?
I
do
n't
like
it
,
it
's
just
self-indulgence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
liked
Sundays
and
knew
how
to
keep
them
.
Her
whole
*NL*
house
was
scrubbed
and
cleaned
on
Saturdays
;
neither
she
nor
the
*NL*
servants
worked
,
and
they
all
wore
holiday
dress
and
went
to
church
.
At
*NL*
her
table
there
were
extra
dishes
at
dinner
,
and
the
servants
had
vodka
*NL*
and
roast
goose
or
suckling
pig
.
But
in
nothing
in
the
house
was
the
*NL*
holiday
so
noticeable
as
in
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
broad
,
stern
face
,
which
*NL*
on
that
day
wore
an
invariable
look
of
solemn
festivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Mass
,
when
they
had
finished
their
coffee
in
the
dining
room
where
*NL*
the
loose
covers
had
been
removed
from
the
furniture
,
a
servant
*NL*
announced
that
the
carriage
was
ready
,
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
rose
with
a
*NL*
stern
air
.
She
wore
her
holiday
shawl
,
in
which
she
paid
calls
,
and
*NL*
announced
that
she
was
going
to
see
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
to
have
an
*NL*
explanation
with
him
about
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
she
had
gone
,
a
dressmaker
from
Madame
Suppert-Roguet
waited
on
*NL*
the
Rostovs
,
and
Natasha
,
very
glad
of
this
diversion
,
having
shut
*NL*
herself
into
a
room
adjoining
the
drawing
room
,
occupied
herself
trying
*NL*
on
the
new
dresses
.
Just
as
she
had
put
on
a
bodice
without
sleeves
and
*NL*
only
tacked
together
,
and
was
turning
her
head
to
see
in
the
glass
how
*NL*
the
back
fitted
,
she
heard
in
the
drawing
room
the
animated
sounds
of
*NL*
her
father
's
voice
and
another
's
--
a
woman
's
--
that
made
her
flush
.
It
was
*NL*
Helene
.
Natasha
had
not
time
to
take
off
the
bodice
before
the
door
*NL*
opened
and
Countess
Bezukhova
,
dressed
in
a
purple
velvet
gown
with
a
*NL*
high
collar
,
came
into
the
room
beaming
with
good-humored
amiable
*NL*
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
enchantress
!
''
she
cried
to
the
blushing
Natasha
.
``
Charming
!
No
,
*NL*
this
is
really
beyond
anything
,
my
dear
count
,
''
said
she
to
Count
Rostov
*NL*
who
had
followed
her
in
.
``
How
can
you
live
in
Moscow
and
go
nowhere
?
No
,
*NL*
I
wo
n't
let
you
off
!
Mademoiselle
George
will
recite
at
my
house
tonight
*NL*
and
there
'll
be
some
people
,
and
if
you
do
n't
bring
your
lovely
girls
--
*NL*
who
are
prettier
than
Mademoiselle
George
--
I
wo
n't
know
you
!
My
husband
*NL*
is
away
in
Tver
or
I
would
send
him
to
fetch
you
.
You
must
come
.
You
*NL*
positively
must
!
Between
eight
and
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
to
the
dressmaker
,
whom
she
knew
and
who
had
curtsied
*NL*
respectfully
to
her
,
and
seated
herself
in
an
armchair
beside
the
*NL*
looking
glass
,
draping
the
folds
of
her
velvet
dress
picturesquely
.
She
*NL*
did
not
cease
chattering
good-naturedly
and
gaily
,
continually
praising
*NL*
Natasha
's
beauty
.
She
looked
at
Natasha
's
dresses
and
praised
them
,
as
*NL*
well
as
a
new
dress
of
her
own
made
of
``
metallic
gauze
,
''
which
she
had
*NL*
received
from
Paris
,
and
advised
Natasha
to
have
one
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
anything
suits
you
,
my
charmer
!
''
she
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
of
pleasure
never
left
Natasha
's
face
.
She
felt
happy
and
as
if
*NL*
she
were
blossoming
under
the
praise
of
this
dear
Countess
Bezukhova
who
*NL*
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
so
unapproachable
and
important
and
was
now
*NL*
so
kind
to
her
.
Natasha
brightened
up
and
felt
almost
in
love
with
this
*NL*
woman
,
who
was
so
beautiful
and
so
kind
.
Helene
for
her
part
was
*NL*
sincerely
delighted
with
Natasha
and
wished
to
give
her
a
good
time
.
*NL*
Anatole
had
asked
her
to
bring
him
and
Natasha
together
,
and
she
was
*NL*
calling
on
the
Rostovs
for
that
purpose
.
The
idea
of
throwing
her
*NL*
brother
and
Natasha
together
amused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
at
one
time
,
in
Petersburg
,
she
had
been
annoyed
with
Natasha
for
*NL*
drawing
Boris
away
,
she
did
not
think
of
that
now
,
and
in
her
own
way
*NL*
heartily
wished
Natasha
well
.
As
she
was
leaving
the
Rostovs
she
called
*NL*
her
protegee
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
dined
with
me
yesterday
--
we
nearly
died
of
laughter
--
he
ate
*NL*
nothing
and
kept
sighing
for
you
,
my
charmer
!
He
is
madly
,
quite
madly
,
*NL*
in
love
with
you
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
blushed
scarlet
when
she
heard
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
she
blushes
,
how
she
blushes
,
my
pretty
!
''
said
Helene
.
``
You
must
*NL*
certainly
come
.
If
you
love
somebody
,
my
charmer
,
that
is
not
a
reason
*NL*
to
shut
yourself
up
.
Even
if
you
are
engaged
,
I
am
sure
your
fiance
*NL*
would
wish
you
to
go
into
society
rather
than
be
bored
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
knows
I
am
engaged
,
and
she
and
her
husband
Pierre
--
that
good
*NL*
Pierre
--
have
talked
and
laughed
about
this
.
So
it
's
all
right
.
''
And
*NL*
again
,
under
Helene
's
influence
,
what
had
seemed
terrible
now
seemed
*NL*
simple
and
natural
.
``
And
she
is
such
a
grande
dame
,
so
kind
,
and
*NL*
evidently
likes
me
so
much
.
And
why
not
enjoy
myself
?
''
thought
Natasha
,
*NL*
gazing
at
Helene
with
wide-open
,
wondering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
came
back
to
dinner
taciturn
and
serious
,
having
*NL*
evidently
suffered
a
defeat
at
the
old
prince
's
.
She
was
still
too
*NL*
agitated
by
the
encounter
to
be
able
to
talk
of
the
affair
calmly
.
In
*NL*
answer
to
the
count
's
inquiries
she
replied
that
things
were
all
right
*NL*
and
that
she
would
tell
about
it
next
day
.
On
hearing
of
Countess
*NL*
Bezukhova
's
visit
and
the
invitation
for
that
evening
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
to
have
anything
to
do
with
Bezukhova
and
do
n't
advise
you
*NL*
to
;
however
,
if
you
've
promised
--
go
.
It
will
divert
your
thoughts
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
addressing
Natasha
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostov
took
the
girls
to
Countess
Bezukhova
's
.
There
were
a
good
*NL*
many
people
there
,
but
nearly
all
strangers
to
Natasha
.
Count
Rostov
was
*NL*
displeased
to
see
that
the
company
consisted
almost
entirely
of
men
and
*NL*
women
known
for
the
freedom
of
their
conduct
.
Mademoiselle
George
was
*NL*
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
drawing
room
surrounded
by
young
men
.
There
*NL*
were
several
Frenchmen
present
,
among
them
Metivier
who
from
the
time
*NL*
Helene
reached
Moscow
had
been
an
intimate
in
her
house
.
The
count
*NL*
decided
not
to
sit
down
to
cards
or
let
his
girls
out
of
his
sight
and
*NL*
to
get
away
as
soon
as
Mademoiselle
George
's
performance
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
was
at
the
door
,
evidently
on
the
lookout
for
the
Rostovs
.
*NL*
Immediately
after
greeting
the
count
he
went
up
to
Natasha
and
followed
*NL*
her
.
As
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
was
seized
by
the
same
feeling
she
had
*NL*
had
at
the
opera
--
gratified
vanity
at
his
admiration
of
her
and
fear
at
*NL*
the
absence
of
a
moral
barrier
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
welcomed
Natasha
delightedly
and
was
loud
in
admiration
of
her
*NL*
beauty
and
her
dress
.
Soon
after
their
arrival
Mademoiselle
George
went
*NL*
out
of
the
room
to
change
her
costume
.
In
the
drawing
room
people
began
*NL*
arranging
the
chairs
and
taking
their
seats
.
Anatole
moved
a
chair
for
*NL*
Natasha
and
was
about
to
sit
down
beside
her
,
but
the
count
,
who
never
*NL*
lost
sight
of
her
,
took
the
seat
himself
.
Anatole
sat
down
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
George
,
with
her
bare
,
fat
,
dimpled
arms
,
and
a
red
shawl
*NL*
draped
over
one
shoulder
,
came
into
the
space
left
vacant
for
her
,
and
*NL*
assumed
an
unnatural
pose
.
Enthusiastic
whispering
was
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
George
looked
sternly
and
gloomily
at
the
audience
and
*NL*
began
reciting
some
French
verses
describing
her
guilty
love
for
her
*NL*
son
.
In
some
places
she
raised
her
voice
,
in
others
she
whispered
,
*NL*
lifting
her
head
triumphantly
;
sometimes
she
paused
and
uttered
hoarse
*NL*
sounds
,
rolling
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adorable
!
divine
!
delicious
!
''
was
heard
from
every
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
the
fat
actress
,
but
neither
saw
nor
heard
nor
*NL*
understood
anything
of
what
went
on
before
her
.
She
only
felt
herself
*NL*
again
completely
borne
away
into
this
strange
senseless
world
--
so
remote
*NL*
from
her
old
world
--
a
world
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
was
*NL*
good
or
bad
,
reasonable
or
senseless
.
Behind
her
sat
Anatole
,
and
*NL*
conscious
of
his
proximity
she
experienced
a
frightened
sense
of
*NL*
expectancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
monologue
the
whole
company
rose
and
surrounded
*NL*
Mademoiselle
George
,
expressing
their
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
she
is
!
''
Natasha
remarked
to
her
father
who
had
also
*NL*
risen
and
was
moving
through
the
crowd
toward
the
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
when
I
look
at
you
!
''
said
Anatole
,
following
Natasha
.
*NL*
He
said
this
at
a
moment
when
she
alone
could
hear
him
.
``
You
are
*NL*
enchanting
...
from
the
moment
I
saw
you
I
have
never
ceased
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Natasha
!
''
said
the
count
,
as
he
turned
back
for
his
*NL*
daughter
.
``
How
beautiful
she
is
!
''
Natasha
without
saying
anything
*NL*
stepped
up
to
her
father
and
looked
at
him
with
surprised
inquiring
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
giving
several
recitations
,
Mademoiselle
George
left
,
and
Countess
*NL*
Bezukhova
asked
her
visitors
into
the
ballroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
wished
to
go
home
,
but
Helene
entreated
him
not
to
spoil
her
*NL*
improvised
ball
,
and
the
Rostovs
stayed
on
.
Anatole
asked
Natasha
for
a
*NL*
valse
and
as
they
danced
he
pressed
her
waist
and
hand
and
told
her
she
*NL*
was
bewitching
and
that
he
loved
her
.
During
the
ecossaise
,
which
she
*NL*
also
danced
with
him
,
Anatole
said
nothing
when
they
happened
to
be
by
*NL*
themselves
,
but
merely
gazed
at
her
.
Natasha
lifted
her
frightened
eyes
*NL*
to
him
,
but
there
was
such
confident
tenderness
in
his
affectionate
look
*NL*
and
smile
that
she
could
not
,
whilst
looking
at
him
,
say
what
she
had
to
*NL*
say
.
She
lowered
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
such
things
to
me
.
I
am
betrothed
and
love
another
,
''
she
said
*NL*
rapidly
...
She
glanced
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
was
not
upset
or
pained
by
what
she
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
me
of
that
!
What
can
I
do
?
''
said
he
.
``
I
tell
you
I
am
*NL*
madly
,
madly
,
in
love
with
you
!
Is
it
my
fault
that
you
are
*NL*
enchanting
?
...
It
's
our
turn
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
animated
and
excited
,
looked
about
her
with
wide-open
*NL*
frightened
eyes
and
seemed
merrier
than
usual
.
She
understood
hardly
*NL*
anything
that
went
on
that
evening
.
They
danced
the
ecossaise
and
the
*NL*
Grossvater
.
Her
father
asked
her
to
come
home
,
but
she
begged
to
remain
.
*NL*
Wherever
she
went
and
whomever
she
was
speaking
to
,
she
felt
his
eyes
*NL*
upon
her
.
Later
on
she
recalled
how
she
had
asked
her
father
to
let
her
*NL*
go
to
the
dressing
room
to
rearrange
her
dress
,
that
Helene
had
followed
*NL*
her
and
spoken
laughingly
of
her
brother
's
love
,
and
that
she
again
met
*NL*
Anatole
in
the
little
sitting
room
.
Helene
had
disappeared
leaving
them
*NL*
alone
,
and
Anatole
had
taken
her
hand
and
said
in
a
tender
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
come
to
visit
you
but
is
it
possible
that
I
shall
never
see
*NL*
you
?
I
love
you
madly
.
Can
I
never
...
?
''
and
,
blocking
her
path
,
he
*NL*
brought
his
face
close
to
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
large
,
glittering
,
masculine
eyes
were
so
close
to
hers
that
she
saw
*NL*
nothing
but
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natalie
?
''
he
whispered
inquiringly
while
she
felt
her
hands
being
*NL*
painfully
pressed
.
``
Natalie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
''
her
eyes
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Burning
lips
were
pressed
to
hers
,
and
at
the
same
instant
she
felt
*NL*
herself
released
,
and
Helene
's
footsteps
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
*NL*
were
heard
in
the
room
.
Natasha
looked
round
at
her
,
and
then
,
red
and
*NL*
trembling
,
threw
a
frightened
look
of
inquiry
at
Anatole
and
moved
*NL*
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
,
just
one
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
cried
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
.
She
so
wanted
a
word
from
him
that
would
explain
to
her
what
*NL*
had
happened
and
to
which
she
could
find
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natalie
,
just
a
word
,
only
one
!
''
he
kept
repeating
,
evidently
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
say
and
he
repeated
it
till
Helene
came
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
returned
with
Natasha
to
the
drawing
room
.
The
Rostovs
went
away
*NL*
without
staying
for
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reaching
home
Natasha
did
not
sleep
all
night
.
She
was
tormented
*NL*
by
the
insoluble
question
whether
she
loved
Anatole
or
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
She
loved
Prince
Andrew
--
she
remembered
distinctly
how
deeply
she
loved
*NL*
him
.
But
she
also
loved
Anatole
,
of
that
there
was
no
doubt
.
``
Else
how
*NL*
could
all
this
have
happened
?
''
thought
she
.
``
If
,
after
that
,
I
could
*NL*
return
his
smile
when
saying
good-by
,
if
I
was
able
to
let
it
come
to
*NL*
that
,
it
means
that
I
loved
him
from
the
first
.
It
means
that
he
is
*NL*
kind
,
noble
,
and
splendid
,
and
I
could
not
help
loving
him
.
What
am
I
to
*NL*
do
if
I
love
him
and
the
other
one
too
?
''
she
asked
herself
,
unable
to
*NL*
find
an
answer
to
these
terrible
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
came
with
its
cares
and
bustle
.
Everyone
got
up
and
began
to
*NL*
move
about
and
talk
,
dressmakers
came
again
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
appeared
,
*NL*
and
they
were
called
to
breakfast
.
Natasha
kept
looking
uneasily
at
*NL*
everybody
with
wide-open
eyes
,
as
if
wishing
to
intercept
every
glance
*NL*
directed
toward
her
,
and
tried
to
appear
the
same
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
which
was
her
best
time
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
sat
down
in
*NL*
her
armchair
and
called
Natasha
and
the
count
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
friends
,
I
have
now
thought
the
whole
matter
over
and
this
is
my
*NL*
advice
,
''
she
began
.
``
Yesterday
,
as
you
know
,
I
went
to
see
Prince
*NL*
Bolkonski
.
Well
,
I
had
a
talk
with
him
...
He
took
it
into
his
head
to
*NL*
begin
shouting
,
but
I
am
not
one
to
be
shouted
down
.
I
said
what
I
had
*NL*
to
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
he
?
''
asked
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
He
's
crazy
...
he
did
not
want
to
listen
.
But
what
's
the
use
of
*NL*
talking
?
As
it
is
we
have
worn
the
poor
girl
out
,
''
said
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
.
``
My
advice
to
you
is
finish
your
business
and
go
back
home
*NL*
to
Otradnoe
...
and
wait
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
exclaimed
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
back
,
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
``
and
wait
there
.
If
your
*NL*
betrothed
comes
here
now
--
there
will
be
no
avoiding
a
quarrel
;
but
alone
*NL*
with
the
old
man
he
will
talk
things
over
and
then
come
on
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostov
approved
of
this
suggestion
,
appreciating
its
*NL*
reasonableness
.
If
the
old
man
came
round
it
would
be
all
the
better
to
*NL*
visit
him
in
Moscow
or
at
Bald
Hills
later
on
;
and
if
not
,
the
wedding
,
*NL*
against
his
wishes
,
could
only
be
arranged
at
Otradnoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
perfectly
true
.
And
I
am
sorry
I
went
to
see
him
and
took
her
,
''
*NL*
said
the

*NL*
``
No

why
be
sorry

Being
here

you
had
to
pay
your
respects

But
if
he

that

said
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
looking
for
something
*NL*
in
her
reticule

``
Besides

*NL*
*NL*
Having
found
what
she
was
looking
for
in
the
reticule
she
handed
it
to
*NL*
Natasha
.
It
was
a
letter
from
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
written
to
you
.
How
she
torments
herself
,
poor
thing
!
She
's
*NL*
afraid
you
might
think
that
she
does
not
like
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
does
n't
like
me
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
!
''
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
believe
anyone
,
I
know
she
does
n't
like
me
,
''
replied
Natasha
*NL*
boldly
as
she
took
the
letter
,
and
her
face
expressed
a
cold
and
angry
*NL*
resolution
that
caused
Marya
Dmitrievna
to
look
at
her
more
intently
and
*NL*
to
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
answer
like
that
,
my
good
girl
!
''
she
said
.
``
What
I
say
is
true
!
*NL*
Write
an
answer
!
''
Natasha
did
not
reply
and
went
to
her
own
room
to
read
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
wrote
that
she
was
in
despair
at
the
misunderstanding
that
*NL*
had
occurred
between
them
.
Whatever
her
father
's
feelings
might
be
,
she
*NL*
begged
Natasha
to
believe
that
she
could
not
help
loving
her
as
the
one
*NL*
chosen
by
her
brother
,
for
whose
happiness
she
was
ready
to
sacrifice
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
think
,
however
,
''
she
wrote
,
``
that
my
father
is
ill-disposed
*NL*
toward
you
.
He
is
an
invalid
and
an
old
man
who
must
be
forgiven
;
but
he
*NL*
is
good
and
magnanimous
and
will
love
her
who
makes
his
son
happy
.
''
*NL*
Princess
Mary
went
on
to
ask
Natasha
to
fix
a
time
when
she
could
see
*NL*
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reading
the
letter
Natasha
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
to
answer
*NL*
it
.
``
Dear
Princess
,
''
she
wrote
in
French
quickly
and
mechanically
,
and
*NL*
then
paused
.
What
more
could
she
write
after
all
that
had
happened
the
*NL*
evening
before
?
``
Yes
,
yes
!
All
that
has
happened
,
and
now
all
is
*NL*
changed
,
''
she
thought
as
she
sat
with
the
letter
she
had
begun
before
*NL*
her
.
``
Must
I
break
off
with
him
?
Must
I
really
?
That
's
awful
...
''
and
to
*NL*
escape
from
these
dreadful
thoughts
she
went
to
Sonya
and
began
sorting
*NL*
patterns
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Natasha
went
to
her
room
and
again
took
up
Princess
Mary
's
*NL*
letter
.
``
Can
it
be
that
it
is
all
over
?
''
she
thought
.
``
Can
it
be
that
*NL*
all
this
has
happened
so
quickly
and
has
destroyed
all
that
went
*NL*
before
?
''
She
recalled
her
love
for
Prince
Andrew
in
all
its
former
*NL*
strength
,
and
at
the
same
time
felt
that
she
loved
Kuragin
.
She
vividly
*NL*
pictured
herself
as
Prince
Andrew
's
wife
,
and
the
scenes
of
happiness
*NL*
with
him
she
had
so
often
repeated
in
her
imagination
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
aglow
with
excitement
,
recalled
every
detail
of
yesterday
's
*NL*
interview
with
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
could
that
not
be
as
well
?
''
she
sometimes
asked
herself
in
complete
*NL*
bewilderment
.
``
Only
so
could
I
be
completely
happy
;
but
now
I
have
to
*NL*
choose
,
and
I
ca
n't
be
happy
without
either
of
them
.
Only
,
''
she
thought
,
*NL*
``
to
tell
Prince
Andrew
what
has
happened
or
to
hide
it
from
him
are
both
*NL*
equally
impossible
.
But
with
that
one
nothing
is
spoiled
.
But
am
I
*NL*
really
to
abandon
forever
the
joy
of
Prince
Andrew
's
love
,
in
which
I
*NL*
have
lived
so
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Miss
!
''
whispered
a
maid
entering
the
room
with
a
mysterious
*NL*
air
.
``
A
man
told
me
to
give
you
this
-
''
and
she
handed
Natasha
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
,
for
Christ
's
sake
...
''
the
girl
went
on
,
as
Natasha
,
without
*NL*
thinking
,
mechanically
broke
the
seal
and
read
a
love
letter
from
*NL*
Anatole
,
of
which
,
without
taking
in
a
word
,
she
understood
only
that
it
*NL*
was
a
letter
from
him
--
from
the
man
she
loved
.
Yes
,
she
loved
him
,
or
*NL*
else
how
could
that
have
happened
which
had
happened
?
And
how
could
she
*NL*
have
a
love
letter
from
him
in
her
hand
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
trembling
hands
Natasha
held
that
passionate
love
letter
which
*NL*
Dolokhov
had
composed
for
Anatole
,
and
as
she
read
it
she
found
in
it
an
*NL*
echo
of
all
that
she
herself
imagined
she
was
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
yesterday
evening
my
fate
has
been
sealed
;
to
be
loved
by
you
or
*NL*
to
die
.
There
is
no
other
way
for
me
,
''
the
letter
began
.
Then
he
went
on
*NL*
to
say
that
he
knew
her
parents
would
not
give
her
to
him
--
for
this
*NL*
there
were
secret
reasons
he
could
reveal
only
to
her
--
but
that
if
she
*NL*
loved
him
she
need
only
say
the
word
yes
,
and
no
human
power
could
*NL*
hinder
their
bliss
.
Love
would
conquer
all
.
He
would
steal
her
away
and
*NL*
carry
her
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
I
love
him
!
''
thought
Natasha
,
reading
the
letter
for
the
*NL*
twentieth
time
and
finding
some
peculiarly
deep
meaning
in
each
word
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Marya
Dmitrievna
was
going
to
the
Akharovs
'
and
proposed
to
*NL*
take
the
girls
with
her
.
Natasha
,
pleading
a
headache
,
remained
at
home

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
late
in
the
evening
Sonya
went
to
Natasha
's
room
,
and
to
*NL*
her
surprise
found
her
still
dressed
and
asleep
on
the
sofa
.
Open
on
the
*NL*
table
,
beside
her
lay
Anatole
's
letter
.
Sonya
picked
it
up
and
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
read
she
glanced
at
the
sleeping
Natasha
,
trying
to
find
in
her
*NL*
face
an
explanation
of
what
she
was
reading
,
but
did
not
find
it
.
Her
*NL*
face
was
calm
,
gentle
,
and
happy
.
Clutching
her
breast
to
keep
herself
*NL*
from
choking
,
Sonya
,
pale
and
trembling
with
fear
and
agitation
,
sat
*NL*
down
in
an
armchair
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
I
noticed
nothing
?
How
could
it
go
so
far
?
Can
she
have
left
*NL*
off
loving
Prince
Andrew
?
And
how
could
she
let
Kuragin
go
to
such
*NL*
lengths
?
He
is
a
deceiver
and
a
villain
,
that
's
plain
!
What
will
*NL*
Nicholas
,
dear
noble
Nicholas
,
do
when
he
hears
of
it
?
So
this
is
the
*NL*
meaning
of
her
excited
,
resolute
,
unnatural
look
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
,
yesterday
,
and
today
,
''
thought
Sonya
.
``
But
it
ca
n't
be
that
*NL*
she
loves
him
!
She
probably
opened
the
letter
without
knowing
who
it
was
*NL*
from
.
Probably
she
is
offended
by
it
.
She
could
not
do
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
wiped
away
her
tears
and
went
up
to
Natasha
,
again
scanning
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
!
''
she
said
,
just
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
awoke
and
saw
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
're
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
the
decision
and
tenderness
that
often
come
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
awakening
,
she
embraced
her
friend
,
but
noticing
Sonya
's
look
of
*NL*
embarrassment
,
her
own
face
expressed
confusion
and
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
you
've
read
that
letter
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Sonya
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
smiled
rapturously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Sonya
,
I
ca
n't
any
longer
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
hide
it
from
you
any
*NL*
longer
.
You
know
,
we
love
one
another
!
Sonya
,
darling
,
he
writes
...
*NL*
Sonya
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
stared
open-eyed
at
Natasha
,
unable
to
believe
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Bolkonski
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Sonya
,
if
you
only
knew
how
happy
I
am
!
''
cried
Natasha
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
love
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Natasha
,
can
that
be
all
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
Sonya
with
wide-open
eyes
as
if
she
could
not
grasp
*NL*
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
are
you
refusing
Prince
Andrew
?
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
understand
anything
!
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
just
listen
!
''
*NL*
said
Natasha
,
with
momentary
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
believe
it
,
''
insisted
Sonya
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
How
is
it
*NL*
you
have
loved
a
man
for
a
whole
year
and
suddenly
...
Why
,
you
have
only
*NL*
seen
him
three
times
!
Natasha
,
I
do
n't
believe
you
,
you
're
joking
!
In
*NL*
three
days
to
forget
everything
and
so
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
days
?
''
said
Natasha
.
``
It
seems
to
me
I
've
loved
him
a
hundred
*NL*
years
.
It
seems
to
me
that
I
have
never
loved
anyone
before
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
it
...
Sonya
,
wait
a
bit
,
sit
here
,
''
and
Natasha
embraced
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
heard
that
it
happens
like
this
,
and
you
must
have
heard
it
too
,
*NL*
but
it
's
only
now
that
I
feel
such
love
.
It
's
not
the
same
as
before
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
I
saw
him
I
felt
he
was
my
master
and
I
his
slave
,
and
that
I
*NL*
could
not
help
loving
him
.
Yes
,
his
slave
!
Whatever
he
orders
I
shall
*NL*
do

You
do
n't
understand
that

What
can
I
do

What
can
I
do
,
Sonya
?

*NL*
cried
Natasha
with
a
happy
yet
frightened
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
what
you
are
doing
,
''
cried
Sonya
.
``
I
ca
n't
leave
it

*NL*
this

This
secret
correspondence

How
could
you
let
him
go
so
far
?
''
*NL*
she
went
on
,
with
a
horror
and
disgust
she
could
hardly
conceal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
that
I
have
no
will

Natasha
replied
.
``
Why

n't
you
*NL*
understand

I
love
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
wo
n't

come

cried
Sonya
,
*NL*
bursting
into
tears

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

For
God
's

If
you
tell

you
are
my
enemy

*NL*
declared
Natasha
.
``
You
want
me
to
be
miserable

you
want
us
to
be
*NL*
separated

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
Natasha
's
fright
,
Sonya
shed
tears
of
shame
and
pity
for
*NL*
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
happened
between
you

''
she
asked
.
``
What
has
he
said
to

you

Why
does

he
come
to
the
house

*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
answer
her
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's

Sonya

tell
anyone

Natasha
*NL*
entreated
.
``
Remember
no

But
why
this
secrecy

asked
Sonya

*NL*
``
Why

openly
ask

you
complete
freedom

if

really
so

I
do

*NL*
Natasha

have
you
considered
what
these
secret
reasons
can
be

*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
Sonya
with
astonishment
.
Evidently
this
question
*NL*
presented
itself
to
her
mind
for
the
first
time
and
she
did
not
know
how
*NL*
to
answer
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

what
the
reasons

there
must

reasons

*NL*
Sonya
sighed
and
shook
her
head
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
were
reasons

she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Natasha
,
guessing
her
doubts
,
interrupted
her
in
alarm

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya

one

she
cried

*NL*
``
Does

*NL*
``

Natasha
repeated
with
a
smile
of
pity
at
her
friend

*NL*
lack
of
comprehension
.
``
Why

you
have
read
his
letter

you
have
seen

him

Natasha

*NL*
``
If

resolutely

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
live
without
him
!
''
cried
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
And
what
are
you
saying
!
Think
of
your
*NL*
father
and
of
Nicholas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
anyone
,
I
do
n't
love
anyone
but
him
.
How
dare
you
say
he
*NL*
is
dishonorable
?
Do
n't
you
know
that
I
love
him
?
''
screamed
Natasha
.
``
Go
*NL*
away
,
Sonya
!
I
do
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
you
,
but
go
,
for
God
's
sake
*NL*
go
!
You
see
how
I
am
suffering
!
''
Natasha
cried
angrily
,
in
a
voice
of
*NL*
despair
and
repressed
irritation
.
Sonya
burst
into
sobs
and
ran
from
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
went
to
the
table
and
without
a
moment
's
reflection
wrote
that
*NL*
answer
to
Princess
Mary
which
she
had
been
unable
to
write
all
the
*NL*
morning
.
In
this
letter
she
said
briefly
that
all
their
*NL*
misunderstandings
were
at
an
end
;
that
availing
herself
of
the
*NL*
magnanimity
of
Prince
Andrew
who
when
he
went
abroad
had
given
her
her
*NL*
freedom
,
she
begged
Princess
Mary
to
forget
everything
and
forgive
her
*NL*
if
she
had
been
to
blame
toward
her
,
but
that
she
could
not
be
his
wife
.
*NL*
At
that
moment
this
all
seemed
quite
easy
,
simple
,
and
clear
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Friday
the
Rostovs
were
to
return
to
the
country
,
but
on
Wednesday
*NL*
the
count
went
with
the
prospective
purchaser
to
his
estate
near
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
the
count
left
,
Sonya
and
Natasha
were
invited
to
a
big
*NL*
dinner
party
at
the
Karagins
'
,
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
took
them
there
.
At
*NL*
that
party
Natasha
again
met
Anatole
,
and
Sonya
noticed
that
she
spoke
*NL*
to
him
,
trying
not
to
be
overheard
,
and
that
all
through
dinner
she
was
*NL*
more
agitated
than
ever
.
When
they
got
home
Natasha
was
the
first
to
*NL*
begin
the
explanation
Sonya
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Sonya
,
you
were
talking
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
him
,
''
*NL*
Natasha
began
in
a
mild
voice
such
as
children
use
when
they
wish
to
be
*NL*
praised
.
``
We
have
had
an
explanation
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
happened
?
What
did
he
say
?
Natasha
,
how
glad
I
am
you
're
not
*NL*
angry
with
me
!
Tell
me
everything
--
the
whole
truth
.
What
did
he
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
became
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Sonya
,
if
you
knew
him
as
I
do
!
He
said
...
He
asked
me
what
I
had
*NL*
promised
Bolkonski
.
He
was
glad
I
was
free
to
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
sighed
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
n't
refused
Bolkonski
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
have
.
Perhaps
all
is
over
between
me
and
Bolkonski
.
Why
do
*NL*
you
think
so
badly
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
anything
,
only
I
do
n't
understand
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
Sonya
,
you
'll
understand
everything
.
You
'll
see
what
a
man
*NL*
he
is
!
Now
do
n't
think
badly
of
me
or
of
him
.
I
do
n't
think
badly
of
*NL*
anyone
:
I
love
and
pity
everybody
.
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
did
not
succumb
to
the
tender
tone
Natasha
used
toward
her
.
The
*NL*
more
emotional
and
ingratiating
the
expression
of
Natasha
's
face
became
,
*NL*
the
more
serious
and
stern
grew
Sonya
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
asked
me
not
to
speak
to
you
,
and
I
have
n't
*NL*
spoken
,
but
now
you
yourself
have
begun
.
I
do
n't
trust
him
,
Natasha
.
Why
*NL*
this
secrecy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
,
again
!
''
interrupted
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
I
am
afraid
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
're
going
to
your
ruin
,
''
said
Sonya
resolutely
,
and
was
*NL*
herself
horrified
at
what
she
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anger
again
showed
in
Natasha
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
go
to
my
ruin
,
I
will
,
as
soon
as
possible
!
It
's
not
your
*NL*
business
!
It
wo
n't
be
you
,
but
I
,
who
'll
suffer
.
Leave
me
alone
,
leave
*NL*
me
alone
!
I
hate
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
!
''
moaned
Sonya
,
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
you
,
I
hate
you
!
You
're
my
enemy
forever
!
''
And
Natasha
ran
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
speak
to
Sonya
again
and
avoided
her
.
With
the
same
*NL*
expression
of
agitated
surprise
and
guilt
she
went
about
the
house
,
*NL*
taking
up
now
one
occupation
,
now
another
,
and
at
once
abandoning
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hard
as
it
was
for
Sonya
,
she
watched
her
friend
and
did
not
let
her
out
*NL*
of
her
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
before
the
count
was
to
return
,
Sonya
noticed
that
Natasha
sat
*NL*
by
the
drawing-room
window
all
the
morning
as
if
expecting
something
and
*NL*
that
she
made
a
sign
to
an
officer
who
drove
past
,
whom
Sonya
took
to
be
*NL*
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
began
watching
her
friend
still
more
attentively
and
noticed
that
*NL*
at
dinner
and
all
that
evening
Natasha
was
in
a
strange
and
unnatural
*NL*
state
.
She
answered
questions
at
random
,
began
sentences
she
did
not
*NL*
finish
,
and
laughed
at
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
Sonya
noticed
a
housemaid
at
Natasha
's
door
timidly
waiting
to
*NL*
let
her
pass
.
She
let
the
girl
go
in
,
and
then
listening
at
the
door
*NL*
learned
that
another
letter
had
been
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
it
became
clear
to
Sonya
that
Natasha
had
some
dreadful
*NL*
plan
for
that
evening
.
Sonya
knocked
at
her
door
.
Natasha
did
not
let
*NL*
her
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
run
away
with
him
!
''
thought
Sonya
.
``
She
is
capable
of
*NL*
anything
.
There
was
something
particularly
pathetic
and
resolute
in
her
*NL*
face
today
.
She
cried
as
she
said
good-by
to
Uncle
,
''
Sonya
remembered
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
,
she
means
to
elope
with
him
,
but
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
thought
she
,
recalling
all
the
signs
that
clearly
indicated
that
Natasha
*NL*
had
some
terrible
intention
.
``
The
count
is
away
.
What
am
I
to
do
?
Write
*NL*
to
Kuragin
demanding
an
explanation
?
But
what
is
there
to
oblige
him
to
*NL*
reply
?
Write
to
Pierre
,
as
Prince
Andrew
asked
me
to
in
case
of
some
*NL*
misfortune
?
...
But
perhaps
she
really
has
already
refused
Bolkonski
--
she
*NL*
sent
a
letter
to
Princess
Mary
yesterday
.
And
Uncle
is
away
...
''
To
tell
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
who
had
such
faith
in
Natasha
seemed
to
Sonya
terrible
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyway
,
''
thought
Sonya
as
she
stood
in
the
dark
passage
,
``
now
or
*NL*
never
I
must
prove
that
I
remember
the
family
's
goodness
to
me
and
that
*NL*
I
love
Nicholas
.
Yes
!
If
I
do
n't
sleep
for
three
nights
I
'll
not
leave
*NL*
this
passage
and
will
hold
her
back
by
force
and
will
and
not
let
the
*NL*
family
be
disgraced
,

thought
she
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
had
lately
moved
to
Dolokhov
's
.
The
plan
for
Natalie
Rostova
's
*NL*
abduction
had
been
arranged
and
the
preparations
made
by
Dolokhov
a
few
*NL*
days
before
,
and
on
the
day
that
Sonya
,
after
listening
at
Natasha
's
*NL*
door
,
resolved
to
safeguard
her
,
it
was
to
have
been
put
into
execution
.
*NL*
Natasha
had
promised
to
come
out
to
Kuragin
at
the
back
porch
at
ten
*NL*
that
evening
.
Kuragin
was
to
put
her
into
a
troyka
he
would
have
ready
*NL*
and
to
drive
her
forty
miles
to
the
village
of
Kamenka
,
where
an
*NL*
unfrocked
priest
was
in
readiness
to
perform
a
marriage
ceremony
over
*NL*
them
.
At
Kamenka
a
relay
of
horses
was
to
wait
which
would
take
them
to
*NL*
the
Warsaw
highroad
,
and
from
there
they
would
hasten
abroad
with
post
*NL*
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
had
a
passport
,
an
order
for
post
horses
,
ten
thousand
rubles
he
*NL*
had
taken
from
his
sister
and
another
ten
thousand
borrowed
with
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
witnesses
for
the
mock
marriage
--
Khvostikov
,
a
retired
petty
*NL*
official
whom
Dolokhov
made
use
of
in
his
gambling
transactions
,
and
*NL*
Makarin
,
a
retired
hussar
,
a
kindly
,
weak
fellow
who
had
an
unbounded
*NL*
affection
for
Kuragin
--
were
sitting
at
tea
in
Dolokhov
's
front
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
large
study
,
the
walls
of
which
were
hung
to
the
ceiling
with
*NL*
Persian
rugs
,
bearskins
,
and
weapons
,
sat
Dolokhov
in
a
traveling
cloak
*NL*
and
high
boots
,
at
an
open
desk
on
which
lay
an
abacus
and
some
bundles
of
*NL*
paper
money
.
Anatole
,
with
uniform
unbuttoned
,
walked
to
and
fro
from
*NL*
the
room
where
the
witnesses
were
sitting
,
through
the
study
to
the
room
*NL*
behind
,
where
his
French
valet
and
others
were
packing
the
last
of
his
*NL*
things
.
Dolokhov
was
counting
the
money
and
noting
something
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
Khvostikov
must
have
two
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
him
,
then
,
''
said
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Makarka
''
-LRB-
their
name
for
Makarin
-RRB-
``
will
go
through
fire
and
water
for
*NL*
you
for
nothing
.
So
here
are
our
accounts
all
settled
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
showing
him
the
memorandum
.
``
Is
that
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
returned
Anatole
,
evidently
not
listening
to
Dolokhov
*NL*
and
looking
straight
before
him
with
a
smile
that
did
not
leave
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
banged
down
the
lid
of
his
desk
and
turned
to
Anatole
with
an
*NL*
ironic
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
?
You
'd
really
better
drop
it
all
.
There
's
still
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
,
''
retorted
Anatole
.
``
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
!
If
you
only
knew
...
it
's
*NL*
the
devil
knows
what
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
really
,
give
it
up
!
''
said
Dolokhov
.
``
I
am
speaking
seriously
.
It
's
*NL*
no
joke
,
this
plot
you
've
hatched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
teasing
again
?
Go
to
the
devil
!
Eh
?
''
said
Anatole
,
making
a
*NL*
grimace
.
``
Really
it
's
no
time
for
your
stupid
jokes
,
''
and
he
left
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
smiled
contemptuously
and
condescendingly
when
Anatole
had
gone
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wait
a
bit
,
''
he
called
after
him
.
``
I
'm
not
joking
,
I
'm
talking
*NL*
sense
.
Come
here
,
come
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
returned
and
looked
at
Dolokhov
,
trying
to
give
him
his
*NL*
attention
and
evidently
submitting
to
him
involuntarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
listen
to
me
.
I
'm
telling
you
this
for
the
last
time
.
Why
should
I
*NL*
joke
about
it
?
Did
I
hinder
you
?
Who
arranged
everything
for
you
?
Who
*NL*
found
the
priest
and
got
the
passport
?
Who
raised
the
money
?
I
did
it
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
thank
you
for
it
.
Do
you
think
I
am
not
grateful
?
''
And
Anatole
*NL*
sighed
and
embraced
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
helped
you
,
but
all
the
same
I
must
tell
you
the
truth
;
it
is
a
*NL*
dangerous
business
,
and
if
you
think
about
it
--
a
stupid
business
.
Well
,
*NL*
you
'll
carry
her
off
--
all
right
!
Will
they
let
it
stop
at
that
?
It
will
*NL*
come
out
that
you
're
already
married
.
Why
,
they
'll
have
you
in
the
*NL*
criminal
court
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
nonsense
!
''
Anatole
ejaculated
and
again
made
a
grimace
.
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
explain
to
you
?
What
?
''
And
Anatole
,
with
the
partiality
dull
-
*NL*
witted
people
have
for
any
conclusion
they
have
reached
by
their
own
*NL*
reasoning
,
repeated
the
argument
he
had
already
put
to
Dolokhov
a
*NL*
hundred
times
.
``
Did
n't
I
explain
to
you
that
I
have
come
to
this
*NL*
conclusion
:
if
this
marriage
is
invalid
,
''
he
went
on
,
crooking
one
*NL*
finger
,
``
then
I
have
nothing
to
answer
for
;
but
if
it
is
valid
,
no
*NL*
matter
!
Abroad
no
one
will
know
anything
about
it
.
Is
n't
that
so
?
And
*NL*
do
n't
talk
to
me
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seriously
,
you
'd
better
drop
it
!
You
'll
only
get
yourself
into
a
mess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
''
cried
Anatole
and
,
clutching
his
hair
,
left
the
room
,
*NL*
but
returned
at
once
and
dropped
into
an
armchair
in
front
of
Dolokhov
*NL*
with
his
feet
turned
under
him
.
``
It
's
the
very
devil
!
What
?
Feel
how
it
*NL*
beats
!
''
He
took
Dolokhov
's
hand
and
put
it
on
his
heart
.
``
What
a
foot
,
*NL*
my
dear
fellow
!
What
a
glance
!
A
goddess
!
''
he
added
in
French
.
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
with
a
cold
smile
and
a
gleam
in
his
handsome
insolent
eyes
*NL*
looked
at
him
--
evidently
wishing
to
get
some
more
amusement
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
and
when
the
money
's
gone
,
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
Eh
?
''
repeated
Anatole
,
sincerely
perplexed
by
a
thought
of
*NL*
the
future
.
``
What
then
?
...
Then
,
I
do
n't
know
...
But
why
talk
*NL*
nonsense
!
''
He
glanced
at
his
watch
.
``
It
's
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
went
into
the
back
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
!
Nearly
ready
?
You
're
dawdling
!
''
he
shouted
to
the
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
put
away
the
money
,
called
a
footman
whom
he
ordered
to
bring
*NL*
something
for
them
to
eat
and
drink
before
the
journey
,
and
went
into
*NL*
the
room
where
Khvostikov
and
Makarin
were
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
study
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
smiling
*NL*
pensively
,
while
his
handsome
lips
muttered
tenderly
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
eat
something
.
Have
a
drink
!
''
Dolokhov
shouted
to
him
from
the
*NL*
other
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
answered
Anatole
continuing
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Balaga
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
rose
and
went
into
the
dining
room
.
Balaga
was
a
famous
troyka
*NL*
driver
who
had
known
Dolokhov
and
Anatole
some
six
years
and
had
given
*NL*
them
good
service
with
his
troykas
.
More
than
once
when
Anatole
's
*NL*
regiment
was
stationed
at
Tver
he
had
taken
him
from
Tver
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
brought
him
to
Moscow
by
daybreak
,
and
driven
him
back
again
*NL*
the
next
night
.
More
than
once
he
had
enabled
Dolokhov
to
escape
when
*NL*
pursued
.
More
than
once
he
had
driven
them
through
the
town
with
gypsies
*NL*
and
``
ladykins
''
as
he
called
the
cocottes
.
More
than
once
in
their
*NL*
service
he
had
run
over
pedestrians
and
upset
vehicles
in
the
streets
of
*NL*
Moscow
and
had
always
been
protected
from
the
consequences
by
``
my
*NL*
gentlemen
''
as
he
called
them
.
He
had
ruined
more
than
one
horse
in
their
*NL*
service
.
More
than
once
they
had
beaten
him
,
and
more
than
once
they
had
*NL*
made
him
drunk
on
champagne
and
Madeira
,
which
he
loved
;
and
he
knew
*NL*
more
than
one
thing
about
each
of
them
which
would
long
ago
have
sent
an
*NL*
ordinary
man
to
Siberia
.
They
often
called
Balaga
into
their
orgies
and
*NL*
made
him
drink
and
dance
at
the
gypsies
'
,
and
more
than
one
thousand
*NL*
rubles
of
their
money
had
passed
through
his
hands
.
In
their
service
he
*NL*
risked
his
skin
and
his
life
twenty
times
a
year
,
and
in
their
service
*NL*
had
lost
more
horses
than
the
money
he
had
from
them
would
buy
.
But
he
*NL*
liked
them
;
liked
that
mad
driving
at
twelve
miles
an
hour
,
liked
*NL*
upsetting
a
driver
or
running
down
a
pedestrian
,
and
flying
at
full
*NL*
gallop
through
the
Moscow
streets
.
He
liked
to
hear
those
wild
,
tipsy
*NL*
shouts
behind
him
:
``
Get
on
!
Get
on
!
''
when
it
was
impossible
to
go
any
*NL*
faster
.
He
liked
giving
a
painful
lash
on
the
neck
to
some
peasant
who
,
*NL*
more
dead
than
alive
,
was
already
hurrying
out
of
his
way
.
``
Real
*NL*
gentlemen
!
''
he
considered
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
and
Dolokhov
liked
Balaga
too
for
his
masterly
driving
and
*NL*
because
he
liked
the
things
they
liked
.
With
others
Balaga
bargained
,
*NL*
charging
twenty-five
rubles
for
a
two
hours
'
drive
,
and
rarely
drove
*NL*
himself
,
generally
letting
his
young
men
do
so
.
But
with
``
his
gentlemen
''
*NL*
he
always
drove
himself
and
never
demanded
anything
for
his
work
.
Only
a
*NL*
couple
of
times
a
year
--
when
he
knew
from
their
valets
that
they
had
*NL*
money
in
hand
--
he
would
turn
up
of
a
morning
quite
sober
and
with
a
deep
*NL*
bow
would
ask
them
to
help
him
.
The
gentlemen
always
made
him
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
help
me
out
,
Theodore
Ivanych
,
sir
,
''
or
``
your
excellency
,
''
he
would
*NL*
say
.
``
I
am
quite
out
of
horses
.
Let
me
have
what
you
can
to
go
to
the
*NL*
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Anatole
and
Dolokhov
,
when
they
had
money
,
would
give
him
a
thousand
*NL*
or
a
couple
of
thousand
rubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balaga
was
a
fair-haired
,
short
,
and
snub-nosed
peasant
of
about
twenty
-
*NL*
seven
;
red-faced
,
with
a
particularly
red
thick
neck
,
glittering
little
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
small
beard
.
He
wore
a
fine
,
dark-blue
,
silk-lined
cloth
*NL*
coat
over
a
sheepskin
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
room
now
he
crossed
himself
,
turning
toward
the
front
*NL*
corner
of
the
room
,
and
went
up
to
Dolokhov
,
holding
out
a
small
,
black
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Theodore
Ivanych
!
''
he
said
,
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
d'you
do
,
friend
?
Well
,
here
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
your
excellency
!
''
he
said
,
again
holding
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
Anatole
who
had
just
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Balaga
,
''
said
Anatole
,
putting
his
hands
on
the
man
's
shoulders
,
*NL*
``
do
you
care
for
me
or
not
?
Eh
?
Now
,
do
me
a
service
...
What
horses
*NL*
have
you
come
with
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
your
messenger
ordered
,
your
special
beasts
,
''
replied
Balaga
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
listen
,
Balaga
!
Drive
all
three
to
death
but
get
me
there
in
*NL*
three
hours
.
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
are
dead
,
what
shall
I
drive
?
''
said
Balaga
with
a
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
I
'll
smash
your
face
in
!
Do
n't
make
jokes
!
''
cried
Anatole
,
*NL*
suddenly
rolling
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
joke
?
''
said
the
driver
,
laughing
.
``
As
if
I
'd
grudge
my
gentlemen
*NL*
anything
!
As
fast
as
ever
the
horses
can
gallop
,
so
fast
we
'll
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Anatole
.
``
Well
,
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sit
down
!
''
said
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stand
,
Theodore
Ivanych
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
;
nonsense
!
Have
a
drink
!
''
said
Anatole
,
and
filled
a
large
*NL*
glass
of
Madeira
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
driver
's
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sight
of
the
wine
.
After
refusing
it
*NL*
for
manners
'
sake
,
he
drank
it
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
a
red
silk
*NL*
handkerchief
he
took
out
of
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
are
we
to
start
,
your
excellency
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
''
Anatole
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
We
'll
start
at
once
.
Mind
,
*NL*
Balaga
!
You
'll
get
there
in
time
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
depends
on
our
luck
in
starting
,
else
why
should
n't
we
be
there
in
*NL*
time
?
''
replied
Balaga
.
``
Did
n't
we
get
you
to
Tver
in
seven
hours
?
I
*NL*
think
you
remember
that
,
your
excellency
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
one
Christmas
I
drove
from
Tver
,
''
said
Anatole
,
smilingly
*NL*
at
the
recollection
and
turning
to
Makarin
who
gazed
rapturously
at
him
*NL*
with
wide-open
eyes
.
``
Will
you
believe
it
,
Makarka
,
it
took
one
's
breath
*NL*
away
,
the
rate
we
flew
.
We
came
across
a
train
of
loaded
sleighs
and
*NL*
drove
right
over
two
of
them
.
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
were
horses
!
''
Balaga
continued
the
tale
.
``
That
time
I
'd
harnessed
*NL*
two
young
side
horses
with
the
bay
in
the
shafts
,
''
he
went
on
,
turning
*NL*
to
Dolokhov
.
``
Will
you
believe
it
,
Theodore
Ivanych
,
those
animals
flew
*NL*
forty
miles
?
I
could
n't
hold
them
in
,
my
hands
grew
numb
in
the
sharp
*NL*
frost
so
that
I
threw
down
the
reins
--
`
Catch
hold
yourself
,
your
*NL*
excellency
!
'
says
I
,
and
I
just
tumbled
on
the
bottom
of
the
sleigh
and
*NL*
sprawled
there
.
It
was
n't
a
case
of
urging
them
on
,
there
was
no
holding
*NL*
them
in
till
we
reached
the
place
.
The
devils
took
us
there
in
three
*NL*
hours
!
Only
the
near
one
died
of
it

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
went
out
of
the
room
and
returned
a
few
minutes
later
wearing
a
*NL*
fur
coat
girt
with
a
silver
belt
,
and
a
sable
cap
jauntily
set
on
one
*NL*
side
and
very
becoming
to
his
handsome
face
.
Having
looked
in
a
mirror
,
*NL*
and
standing
before
Dolokhov
in
the
same
pose
he
had
assumed
before
it
,
*NL*
he
lifted
a
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
,
Theodore
.
Thank
you
for
everything
and
farewell
!
''
said
*NL*
Anatole
.
``
Well
,
comrades
and
friends
...
''
he
considered
for
a
moment
*NL*
''
...
of
my
youth
,
farewell
!
''
he
said
,
turning
to
Makarin
and
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
they
were
all
going
with
him
,
Anatole
evidently
wished
to
make
*NL*
something
touching
and
solemn
out
of
this
address
to
his
comrades
.
He
*NL*
spoke
slowly
in
a
loud
voice
and
throwing
out
his
chest
slightly
swayed
*NL*
one
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
take
glasses
;
you
too
,
Balaga
.
Well
,
comrades
and
friends
of
my
*NL*
youth
,
we
've
had
our
fling
and
lived
and
reveled
.
Eh
?
And
now
,
when
*NL*
shall
we
meet
again
?
I
am
going
abroad
.
We
have
had
a
good
time
--
now
*NL*
farewell
,
lads
!
To
our
health
!
Hurrah
!
...
''
he
cried
,
and
emptying
his
*NL*
glass
flung
it
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
your
health
!
''
said
Balaga
who
also
emptied
his
glass
,
and
wiped
his
*NL*
mouth
with
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Makarin
embraced
Anatole
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Prince
,
how
sorry
I
am
to
part
from
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
.
Let
's
go
!
''
cried
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balaga
was
about
to
leave
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
stop
!
''
said
Anatole
.
``
Shut
the
door
;
we
have
first
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
That
's
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
shut
the
door
and
all
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
quick
march
,
lads
!
''
said
Anatole
,
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
,
his
valet
,
handed
him
his
sabretache
and
saber
,
and
they
all
*NL*
went
out
into
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
's
the
fur
cloak
?
''
asked
Dolokhov
.
``
Hey
,
Ignatka
!
Go
to
*NL*
Matrena
Matrevna
and
ask
her
for
the
sable
cloak
.
I
have
heard
what
*NL*
elopements
are
like
,
''
continued
Dolokhov
with
a
wink
.
``
Why
,
she
'll
rush
*NL*
out
more
dead
than
alive
just
in
the
things
she
is
wearing
;
if
you
delay
*NL*
at
all
there
'll
be
tears
and
`
Papa
'
and
`
Mamma
,
'
and
she
's
frozen
in
a
*NL*
minute
and
must
go
back
--
but
you
wrap
the
fur
cloak
round
her
first
*NL*
thing
and
carry
her
to
the
sleigh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
brought
a
woman
's
fox-lined
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
,
I
told
you
the
sable
one
!
Hey
,
Matrena
,
the
sable
!
''
he
shouted
so
*NL*
that
his
voice
rang
far
through
the
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
handsome
,
slim
,
and
pale-faced
gypsy
girl
with
glittering
black
eyes
*NL*
and
curly
blue-black
hair
,
wearing
a
red
shawl
,
ran
out
with
a
sable
*NL*
mantle
on
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
I
do
n't
grudge
it
--
take
it
!
''
she
said
,
evidently
afraid
of
her
*NL*
master
and
yet
regretful
of
her
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
without
answering
,
took
the
cloak
,
threw
it
over
Matrena
,
and
*NL*
wrapped
her
up
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
,
''
said
Dolokhov
,
``
and
then
so
!
''
and
he
turned
the
collar
*NL*
up
round
her
head
,
leaving
only
a
little
of
the
face
uncovered
.
``
And
*NL*
then
so
,
do
you
see
?
''
and
he
pushed
Anatole
's
head
forward
to
meet
the
*NL*
gap
left
by
the
collar
,
through
which
Matrena
's
brilliant
smile
was
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
,
Matrena
,
''
said
Anatole
,
kissing
her
.
``
Ah
,
my
revels
here
*NL*
are
over
.
Remember
me
to
Steshka

There
,
good-by

Good-bye

Matrena

*NL*
wish
me
luck

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Prince
,
may
God
give
you
great
luck
!
''
said
Matrena
in
her
gypsy
*NL*
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
troykas
were
standing
before
the
porch
and
two
young
drivers
were
*NL*
holding
the
horses
.
Balaga
took
his
seat
in
the
front
one
and
holding
*NL*
his
elbows
high
arranged
the
reins
deliberately
.
Anatole
and
Dolokhov
*NL*
got
in
with
him
.
Makarin
,
Khvostikov
,
and
a
valet
seated
themselves
in
*NL*
the
other
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
ready
?
''
asked
Balaga
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
''
he
cried
,
twisting
the
reins
round
his
hands
,
and
the
troyka
tore
*NL*
down
the
Nikitski
Boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tproo
!
Get
out
of
the
way
!
Hi
!
...
Tproo
!
...
''
The
shouting
of
Balaga
and
*NL*
of
the
sturdy
young
fellow
seated
on
the
box
was
all
that
could
be
*NL*
heard
.
On
the
Arbat
Square
the
troyka
caught
against
a
carriage
;
*NL*
something
cracked
,
shouts
were
heard
,
and
the
troyka
flew
along
the
*NL*
Arbat
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
taking
a
turn
along
the
Podnovinski
Boulevard
,
Balaga
began
to
*NL*
rein
in
,
and
turning
back
drew
up
at
the
crossing
of
the
old
Konyusheny
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
fellow
on
the
box
jumped
down
to
hold
the
horses
and
Anatole
*NL*
and
Dolokhov
went
along
the
pavement
.
When
they
reached
the
gate
*NL*
Dolokhov
whistled
.
The
whistle
was
answered
,
and
a
maidservant
ran
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
into
the
courtyard
or
you
'll
be
seen
;
she
'll
come
out
directly
,
''
*NL*
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
stayed
by
the
gate
.
Anatole
followed
the
maid
into
the
*NL*
courtyard
,
turned
the
corner
,
and
ran
up
into
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
met
by
Gabriel
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
gigantic
footman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
the
mistress
,
please
,
''
said
the
footman
in
his
deep
bass
,
*NL*
intercepting
any
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
what
Mistress
?
Who
are
you
?
''
asked
Anatole
in
a
breathless
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
step
in
,
my
orders
are
to
bring
you
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kuragin
!
Come
back
!
''
shouted
Dolokhov
.
``
Betrayed
!
Back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
after
Anatole
entered
,
had
remained
at
the
wicket
gate
and
was
*NL*
struggling
with
the
yard
porter
who
was
trying
to
lock
it
.
With
a
last
*NL*
desperate
effort
Dolokhov
pushed
the
porter
aside
,
and
when
Anatole
ran
*NL*
back
seized
him
by
the
arm
,
pulled
him
through
the
wicket
,
and
ran
back
*NL*
with
him
to
the
troyka

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
having
found
Sonya
weeping
in
the
corridor
,
made
her
*NL*
confess
everything
,
and
intercepting
the
note
to
Natasha
she
read
it
and
*NL*
went
into
Natasha
's
room
with
it
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shameless
good-for-nothing
!
''
said
she
.
``
I
wo
n't
hear
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pushing
back
Natasha
who
looked
at
her
with
astonished
but
tearless
*NL*
eyes
,
she
locked
her
in
;
and
having
given
orders
to
the
yard
porter
to
*NL*
admit
the
persons
who
would
be
coming
that
evening
,
but
not
to
let
them
*NL*
out
again
,
and
having
told
the
footman
to
bring
them
up
to
her
,
she
*NL*
seated
herself
in
the
drawing
room
to
await
the
abductors
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gabriel
came
to
inform
her
that
the
men
who
had
come
had
run
away
*NL*
again
,
she
rose
frowning
,
and
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
paced
*NL*
through
the
rooms
a
long
time
considering
what
she
should
do
.
Toward
*NL*
midnight
she
went
to
Natasha
's
room
fingering
the
key
in
her
pocket
.
*NL*
Sonya
was
sitting
sobbing
in
the
corridor
.
``
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
let
me
in
to
her
!
''
she
pleaded
,
but
Marya
Dmitrievna
unlocked
the
*NL*
door
and
went
in
without
giving
her
an
answer
...
``
Disgusting
,
*NL*
abominable
...
In
my
house
...
horrid
girl
,
hussy
!
I
'm
only
sorry
for
her
*NL*
father
!
''
thought
she
,
trying
to
restrain
her
wrath
.
``
Hard
as
it
may
be
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
them
all
to
hold
their
tongues
and
will
hide
it
from
the
*NL*
count
.
''
She
entered
the
room
with
resolute
steps
.
Natasha
lying
on
the
*NL*
sofa
,
her
head
hidden
in
her
hands
,
and
she
did
not
stir
.
She
was
in
*NL*
just
the
same
position
in
which
Marya
Dmitrievna
had
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
girl
!
Very
nice
!
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
``
Arranging
meetings
*NL*
with
lovers
in
my
house
!
It
's
no
use
pretending
:
you
listen
when
I
speak
*NL*
to
you
!
''
And
Marya
Dmitrievna
touched
her
arm
.
``
Listen
when
I
speak
!
*NL*
You
've
disgraced
yourself
like
the
lowest
of
hussies
.
I
'd
treat
you
*NL*
differently
,
but
I
'm
sorry
for
your
father
,
so
I
will
conceal
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
change
her
position
,
but
her
whole
body
heaved
with
*NL*
noiseless
,
convulsive
sobs
which
choked
her
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
glanced
*NL*
round
at
Sonya
and
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
beside
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
lucky
for
him
that
he
escaped
me
;
but
I
'll
find
him
!
''
she
said
in
*NL*
her
rough
voice
.
``
Do
you
hear
what
I
am
saying
or
not
?
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
large
hand
under
Natasha
's
face
and
turned
it
toward
her
.
*NL*
Both
Marya
Dmitrievna
and
Sonya
were
amazed
when
they
saw
how
Natasha
*NL*
looked
.
Her
eyes
were
dry
and
glistening
,
her
lips
compressed
,
her
*NL*
cheeks
sunken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
!
...
What
is
it
to
me
?
...
I
shall
die
!
''
she
muttered
,
*NL*
wrenching
herself
from
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
hands
with
a
vicious
effort
*NL*
and
sinking
down
again
into
her
former
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natalie
!
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
``
I
wish
for
your
good
.
Lie
still
,
stay
*NL*
like
that
then
,
I
wo
n't
touch
you
.
But
listen
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
how
*NL*
guilty
you
are
.
You
know
that
yourself
.
But
when
your
father
comes
back
*NL*
tomorrow
what
am
I
to
tell
him
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Natasha
's
body
shook
with
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
he
finds
out
,
and
your
brother
,
and
your
betrothed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
betrothed
:
I
have
refused
him
!
''
cried
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
the
same
,
''
continued
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
``
If
they
hear
of
*NL*
this
,
will
they
let
it
pass
?
He
,
your
father
,
I
know
him
...
if
he
*NL*
challenges
him
to
a
duel
will
that
be
all
right
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
me
be
!
Why
have
you
interfered
at
all
?
Why
?
Why
?
Who
asked
you
*NL*
to
?
''
shouted
Natasha
,
raising
herself
on
the
sofa
and
looking
*NL*
malignantly
at
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
you
want
?
''
cried
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
growing
angry
again
.
*NL*
``
Were
you
kept
under
lock
and
key
?
Who
hindered
his
coming
to
the
house
?
*NL*
Why
carry
you
off
as
if
you
were
some
gypsy
singing
girl
?
...
Well
,
if
he
*NL*
had
carried
you
off
...
do
you
think
they
would
n't
have
found
him
?
Your
*NL*
father
,
or
brother
,
or
your
betrothed
?
And
he
's
a
scoundrel
,
a
wretch
--
*NL*
that
's
a
fact
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
better
than
any
of
you
!
''
exclaimed
Natasha
getting
up
.
``
If
you
*NL*
had
n't
interfered
...
Oh
,
my
God
!
What
is
it
all
?
What
is
it
?
Sonya
,
*NL*
why
?
...
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
burst
into
sobs
with
the
despairing
vehemence
with
which
people
*NL*
bewail
disasters
they
feel
they
have
themselves
occasioned
.
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
was
to
speak
again
but
Natasha
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
Go
away
!
You
all
hate
and
despise
me
!
''
and
she
threw
herself
*NL*
back
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
went
on
admonishing
her
for
some
time
,
enjoining
on
her
*NL*
that
it
must
all
be
kept
from
her
father
and
assuring
her
that
nobody
*NL*
would
know
anything
about
it
if
only
Natasha
herself
would
undertake
to
*NL*
forget
it
all
and
not
let
anyone
see
that
something
had
happened
.
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
reply
,
nor
did
she
sob
any
longer
,
but
she
grew
cold
and
*NL*
had
a
shivering
fit
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
put
a
pillow
under
her
head
,
*NL*
covered
her
with
two
quilts
,
and
herself
brought
her
some
lime-flower
*NL*
water
,
but
Natasha
did
not
respond
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
her
sleep
,
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
*NL*
supposing
Natasha
to
be
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Natasha
was
not
asleep
;
with
pale
face
and
fixed
wide-open
eyes
she
*NL*
looked
straight
before
her
.
All
that
night
she
did
not
sleep
or
weep
and
*NL*
did
not
speak
to
Sonya
who
got
up
and
went
to
her
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Count
Rostov
returned
from
his
estate
near
Moscow
in
time
for
*NL*
lunch
as
he
had
promised
.
He
was
in
very
good
spirits
;
the
affair
with
*NL*
the
purchaser
was
going
on
satisfactorily
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
keep
*NL*
him
any
longer
in
Moscow
,
away
from
the
countess
whom
he
missed
.
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
met
him
and
told
him
that
Natasha
had
been
very
unwell
the
*NL*
day
before
and
that
they
had
sent
for
the
doctor
,
but
that
she
was
*NL*
better
now
.
Natasha
had
not
left
her
room
that
morning
.
With
compressed
*NL*
and
parched
lips
and
dry
fixed
eyes
,
she
sat
at
the
window
,
uneasily
*NL*
watching
the
people
who
drove
past
and
hurriedly
glancing
round
at
*NL*
anyone
who
entered
the
room
.
She
was
evidently
expecting
news
of
him
and
*NL*
that
he
would
come
or
would
write
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
count
came
to
see
her
she
turned
anxiously
round
at
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
man
's
footstep
,
and
then
her
face
resumed
its
cold
and
malevolent
*NL*
expression
.
She
did
not
even
get
up
to
greet
him
.
``
What
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
,
my
angel
?
Are
you
ill
?
''
asked
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
silence
Natasha
answered
:
``
Yes
,
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
the
count
's
anxious
inquiries
as
to
why
she
was
so
dejected
*NL*
and
whether
anything
had
happened
to
her
betrothed
,
she
assured
him
that
*NL*
nothing
had
happened
and
asked
him
not
to
worry
.
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
confirmed
Natasha
's
assurances
that
nothing
had
happened
.
From
the
*NL*
pretense
of
illness
,
from
his
daughter
's
distress
,
and
by
the
*NL*
embarrassed
faces
of
Sonya
and
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
the
count
saw
clearly
*NL*
that
something
had
gone
wrong
during
his
absence
,
but
it
was
so
terrible
*NL*
for
him
to
think
that
anything
disgraceful
had
happened
to
his
beloved
*NL*
daughter
,
and
he
so
prized
his
own
cheerful
tranquillity
,
that
he
*NL*
avoided
inquiries
and
tried
to
assure
himself
that
nothing
particularly
*NL*
had
happened
;
and
he
was
only
dissatisfied
that
her
indisposition
*NL*
delayed
their
return
to
the
country
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
day
his
wife
arrived
in
Moscow
Pierre
had
been
intending
to
go
*NL*
away
somewhere
,
so
as
not
to
be
near
her
.
Soon
after
the
Rostovs
came
to
*NL*
Moscow
the
effect
Natasha
had
on
him
made
him
hasten
to
carry
out
his
*NL*
intention
.
He
went
to
Tver
to
see
Joseph
Alexeevich
's
widow
,
who
had
*NL*
long
since
promised
to
hand
over
to
him
some
papers
of
her
deceased
*NL*
husband
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
to
Moscow
Pierre
was
handed
a
letter
from
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
asking
him
to
come
and
see
her
on
a
matter
of
great
*NL*
importance
relating
to
Andrew
Bolkonski
and
his
betrothed
.
Pierre
had
*NL*
been
avoiding
Natasha
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
feeling
for
her
*NL*
was
stronger
than
a
married
man
's
should
be
for
his
friend
's
fiancee
.
*NL*
Yet
some
fate
constantly
threw
them
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
have
happened
?
And
what
can
they
want
with
me
?
''
thought
he
as
*NL*
he
dressed
to
go
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
.
``
If
only
Prince
Andrew
would
*NL*
hurry
up
and
come
and
marry
her
!
''
thought
he
on
his
way
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Tverskoy
Boulevard
a
familiar
voice
called
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierre
!
Been
back
long
?
''
someone
shouted
.
Pierre
raised
his
head
.
In
a
*NL*
sleigh
drawn
by
two
gray
trotting-horses
that
were
bespattering
the
*NL*
dashboard
with
snow
,
Anatole
and
his
constant
companion
Makarin
dashed
*NL*
past
.
Anatole
was
sitting
upright
in
the
classic
pose
of
military
*NL*
dandies
,
the
lower
part
of
his
face
hidden
by
his
beaver
collar
and
his
*NL*
head
slightly
bent
.
His
face
was
fresh
and
rosy
,
his
white-plumed
hat
,
*NL*
tilted
to
one
side
,
disclosed
his
curled
and
pomaded
hair
besprinkled
*NL*
with
powdery
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
that
's
a
true
sage
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
He
sees
nothing
*NL*
beyond
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
,
nothing
troubles
him
and
so
he
is
*NL*
always
cheerful
,
satisfied
,
and
serene
.
What
would
n't
I
give
to
be
like
*NL*
him
!
''
he
thought
enviously
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
anteroom
the
footman
who
helped
him
off
with
his
*NL*
fur
coat
said
that
the
mistress
asked
him
to
come
to
her
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
opened
the
ballroom
door
Pierre
saw
Natasha
sitting
at
the
*NL*
window
,
with
a
thin
,
pale
,
and
spiteful
face
.
She
glanced
round
at
him
,
*NL*
frowned
,
and
left
the
room
with
an
expression
of
cold
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
entering
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
doings
!
''
answered
Dmitrievna
.
``
For
fifty-eight
years
have
I
lived
*NL*
in
this
world
and
never
known
anything
so
disgraceful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
put
him
on
his
honor
not
to
repeat
anything
she
told
him
,
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
informed
him
that
Natasha
had
refused
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
without
her
parents
'
knowledge
and
that
the
cause
of
this
was
Anatole
*NL*
Kuragin
into
whose
society
Pierre
's
wife
had
thrown
her
and
with
whom
*NL*
Natasha
had
tried
to
elope
during
her
father
's
absence
,
in
order
to
be
*NL*
married
secretly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
raised
his
shoulders
and
listened
open-mouthed
to
what
was
told
*NL*
him
,
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
own
ears
.
That
Prince
Andrew
's
deeply
*NL*
loved
affianced
wife
--
the
same
Natasha
Rostova
who
used
to
be
so
*NL*
charming
--
should
give
up
Bolkonski
for
that
fool
Anatole
who
was
already
*NL*
secretly
married
-LRB-
as
Pierre
knew
-RRB-
,
and
should
be
so
in
love
with
him
as
*NL*
to
agree
to
run
away
with
him
,
was
something
Pierre
could
not
conceive
*NL*
and
could
not
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
reconcile
the
charming
impression
he
had
of
Natasha
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
known
from
a
child
,
with
this
new
conception
of
her
baseness
,
*NL*
folly
,
and
cruelty
.
He
thought
of
his
wife
.
``
They
are
all
alike
!
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
reflecting
that
he
was
not
the
only
man
unfortunate
*NL*
enough
to
be
tied
to
a
bad
woman
.
But
still
he
pitied
Prince
Andrew
to
*NL*
the
point
of
tears
and
sympathized
with
his
wounded
pride
,
and
the
more
*NL*
he
pitied
his
friend
the
more
did
he
think
with
contempt
and
even
with
*NL*
disgust
of
that
Natasha
who
had
just
passed
him
in
the
ballroom
with
*NL*
such
a
look
of
cold
dignity
.
He
did
not
know
that
Natasha
's
soul
was
*NL*
overflowing
with
despair
,
shame
,
and
humiliation
,
and
that
it
was
not
*NL*
her
fault
that
her
face
happened
to
assume
an
expression
of
calm
dignity
*NL*
and
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
get
married
?
''
said
Pierre
,
in
answer
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
``
He
*NL*
could
not
marry
--
he
is
married
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
get
worse
from
hour
to
hour
!
''
ejaculated
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
``
A
*NL*
nice
youth
!
What
a
scoundrel
!
And
she
's
expecting
him
--
expecting
him
*NL*
since
yesterday
.
She
must
be
told
!
Then
at
least
she
wo
n't
go
on
*NL*
expecting
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
hearing
the
details
of
Anatole
's
marriage
from
Pierre
,
and
giving
*NL*
vent
to
her
anger
against
Anatole
in
words
of
abuse
,
Marya
Dmitrievna
*NL*
told
Pierre
why
she
had
sent
for
him
.
She
was
afraid
that
the
count
or
*NL*
Bolkonski
,
who
might
arrive
at
any
moment
,
if
they
knew
of
this
affair
*NL*
-LRB-
which
she
hoped
to
hide
from
them
-RRB-
might
challenge
Anatole
to
a
duel
,
*NL*
and
she
therefore
asked
Pierre
to
tell
his
brother-in-law
in
her
name
to
*NL*
leave
Moscow
and
not
dare
to
let
her
set
eyes
on
him
again
.
Pierre
--
only
*NL*
now
realizing
the
danger
to
the
old
count
,
Nicholas
,
and
Prince
Andrew
--
*NL*
promised
to
do
as
she
wished
.
Having
briefly
and
exactly
explained
her
*NL*
wishes
to
him
,
she
let
him
go
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
the
count
knows
nothing
.
Behave
as
if
you
know
nothing
either
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
And
I
will
go
and
tell
her
it
is
no
use
expecting
him
!
And
*NL*
stay
to
dinner
if
you
care
to
!
''
she
called
after
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
met
the
old
count
,
who
seemed
nervous
and
upset
.
That
morning
*NL*
Natasha
had
told
him
that
she
had
rejected
Bolkonski
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Troubles
,
troubles
,
my
dear
fellow
!
''
he
said
to
Pierre
.
``
What
troubles
*NL*
one
has
with
these
girls
without
their
mother
!
I
do
so
regret
having
*NL*
come
here
...
I
will
be
frank
with
you
.
Have
you
heard
she
has
broken
*NL*
off
her
engagement
without
consulting
anybody
?
It
's
true
this
engagement
*NL*
never
was
much
to
my
liking
.
Of
course
he
is
an
excellent
man
,
but
*NL*
still
,
with
his
father
's
disapproval
they
would
n't
have
been
happy
,
and
*NL*
Natasha
wo
n't
lack
suitors
.
Still
,
it
has
been
going
on
so
long
,
and
to
*NL*
take
such
a
step
without
father
's
or
mother
's
consent
!
And
now
she
's
*NL*
ill
,
and
God
knows
what
!
It
's
hard
,
Count
,
hard
to
manage
daughters
in
*NL*
their
mother
's
absence
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
saw
that
the
count
was
much
upset
and
tried
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
,
but
the
count
returned
to
his
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
entered
the
room
with
an
agitated
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
is
not
quite
well
;
she
's
in
her
room
and
would
like
to
see
you
.
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
is
with
her
and
she
too
asks
you
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
a
great
friend
of
Bolkonski
's
,
no
doubt
she
wants
to
send
*NL*
him
a
message
,
''
said
the
count
.
``
Oh
dear
!
Oh
dear
!
How
happy
it
all
*NL*
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
clutching
the
spare
gray
locks
on
his
temples
the
count
left
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marya
Dmitrievna
told
Natasha
that
Anatole
was
married
,
Natasha
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
believe
it
and
insisted
on
having
it
confirmed
by
Pierre
*NL*
himself
.
Sonya
told
Pierre
this
as
she
led
him
along
the
corridor
to
*NL*
Natasha
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
pale
and
stern
,
was
sitting
beside
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
,
glittering
feverishly
,
met
Pierre
with
a
questioning
look
the
*NL*
moment
he
entered
.
She
did
not
smile
or
nod
,
but
only
gazed
fixedly
at
*NL*
him
,
and
her
look
asked
only
one
thing
:
was
he
a
friend
,
or
like
the
*NL*
others
an
enemy
in
regard
to
Anatole
?
As
for
Pierre
,
he
evidently
did
*NL*
not
exist
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
all
about
it
,
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
pointing
to
Pierre
and
*NL*
addressing
Natasha
.
``
Let
him
tell
you
whether
I
have
told
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
a
hunted
and
wounded
animal
*NL*
looks
at
the
approaching
dogs
and
sportsmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natalya
Ilynichna
,
''
Pierre
began
,
dropping
his
eyes
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
pity
for
her
and
loathing
for
the
thing
he
had
to
do
,
``
whether
it
is
*NL*
true
or
not
should
make
no
difference
to
you
,
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
not
true
that
he
's
married
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
been
married
long
?
''
she
asked
.
``
On
your
honor
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gave
his
word
of
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
still
here
?
''
she
asked
,
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
just
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
evidently
unable
to
speak
and
made
a
sign
with
her
hands
that
*NL*
they
should
leave
her
alone
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
stay
for
dinner
,
but
left
the
room
and
went
away
at
once
.
*NL*
He
drove
through
the
town
seeking
Anatole
Kuragin
,
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
whom
now
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
and
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
*NL*
breathing
.
He
was
not
at
the
ice
hills
,
nor
at
the
gypsies
'
,
nor
at
*NL*
Komoneno
's
.
Pierre
drove
to
the
club
.
In
the
club
all
was
going
on
as
*NL*
usual
.
The
members
who
were
assembling
for
dinner
were
sitting
about
in
*NL*
groups
;
they
greeted
Pierre
and
spoke
of
the
town
news
.
The
footman
*NL*
having
greeted
him
,
knowing
his
habits
and
his
acquaintances
,
told
him
*NL*
there
was
a
place
left
for
him
in
the
small
dining
room
and
that
Prince
*NL*
Michael
Zakharych
was
in
the
library
,
but
Paul
Timofeevich
had
not
yet
*NL*
arrived
.
One
of
Pierre
's
acquaintances
,
while
they
were
talking
about
*NL*
the
weather
,
asked
if
he
had
heard
of
Kuragin
's
abduction
of
Rostova
*NL*
which
was
talked
of
in
the
town
,
and
was
it
true
?
Pierre
laughed
and
*NL*
said
it
was
nonsense
for
he
had
just
come
from
the
Rostovs
'
.
He
asked
*NL*
everyone
about
Anatole
.
One
man
told
him
he
had
not
come
yet
,
and
*NL*
another
that
he
was
coming
to
dinner
.
Pierre
felt
it
strange
to
see
this
*NL*
calm
,
indifferent
crowd
of
people
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
*NL*
soul
.
He
paced
through
the
ballroom
,
waited
till
everyone
had
come
,
and
*NL*
as
Anatole
had
not
turned
up
did
not
stay
for
dinner
but
drove
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
,
for
whom
Pierre
was
looking
,
dined
that
day
with
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
consulting
him
as
to
how
to
remedy
this
unfortunate
affair
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
him
essential
to
see
Natasha
.
In
the
evening
he
drove
to
his
sister
's
to
*NL*
discuss
with
her
how
to
arrange
a
meeting
.
When
Pierre
returned
home
*NL*
after
vainly
hunting
all
over
Moscow
,
his
valet
informed
him
that
Prince
*NL*
Anatole
was
with
the
countess
.
The
countess
'
drawing
room
was
full
of
*NL*
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
without
greeting
his
wife
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
return
--
*NL*
at
that
moment
she
was
more
repulsive
to
him
than
ever
--
entered
the
*NL*
drawing
room
and
seeing
Anatole
went
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Pierre
,
''
said
the
countess
going
up
to
her
husband
.
``
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
a
plight
our
Anatole
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
seeing
in
the
forward
thrust
of
her
husband
's
head
,
in
his
*NL*
glowing
eyes
and
his
resolute
gait
,
the
terrible
indications
of
that
*NL*
rage
and
strength
which
she
knew
and
had
herself
experienced
after
his
*NL*
duel
with
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
are
,
there
is
vice
and
evil
!
''
said
Pierre
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
``
Anatole
,
come
with
me
!
I
must
speak
to
you
,
''
he
added
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
glanced
round
at
his
sister
and
rose
submissively
,
ready
to
*NL*
follow
Pierre
.
Pierre
,
taking
him
by
the
arm
,
pulled
him
toward
himself
*NL*
and
was
leading
him
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
allow
yourself
in
my
drawing
room
...
''
whispered
Helene
,
but
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
reply
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
followed
him
with
his
usual
jaunty
step
but
his
face
betrayed
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
entered
his
study
Pierre
closed
the
door
and
addressed
Anatole
*NL*
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promised
Countess
Rostova
to
marry
her
and
were
about
to
elope
with
*NL*
her
,
is
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
cher
,
''
answered
Anatole
-LRB-
their
whole
conversation
was
in
French
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
consider
myself
bound
to
answer
questions
put
to
me
in
that
*NL*
tone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
face
,
already
pale
,
became
distorted
by
fury
.
He
seized
Anatole
*NL*
by
the
collar
of
his
uniform
with
his
big
hand
and
shook
him
from
side
*NL*
to
side
till
Anatole
's
face
showed
a
sufficient
degree
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
tell
you
that
I
must
talk
to
you
!
...
''
repeated
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
this
is
stupid
.
What
?
''
said
Anatole
,
fingering
a
button
of
*NL*
his
collar
that
had
been
wrenched
loose
with
a
bit
of
the
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
scoundrel
and
a
blackguard
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
deprives
me
*NL*
from
the
pleasure
of
smashing
your
head
with
this
!
''
said
Pierre
,
*NL*
expressing
himself
so
artificially
because
he
was
talking
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
heavy
paperweight
and
lifted
it
threateningly
,
but
at
once
put
*NL*
it
back
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
promise
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
.
.
I
did
n't
think
of
it
.
I
never
promised
,
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
letters
of
hers
?
Any
letters
?
''
he
said
,
moving
toward
*NL*
Anatole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
glanced
at
him
and
immediately
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
*NL*
and
drew
out
his
pocketbook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
the
letter
Anatole
handed
him
and
,
pushing
aside
a
table
*NL*
that
stood
in
his
way
,
threw
himself
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
be
violent
,
do
n't
be
afraid
!
''
said
Pierre
in
answer
to
a
*NL*
frightened
gesture
of
Anatole
's
.
``
First
,
the
letters
,
''
said
he
,
as
if
*NL*
repeating
a
lesson
to
himself
.
``
Secondly
,
''
he
continued
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
,
again
rising
and
again
pacing
the
room
,
``
tomorrow
you
must
get
*NL*
out
of
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
I
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirdly
,
''
Pierre
continued
without
listening
to
him
,
``
you
must
never
*NL*
breathe
a
word
of
what
has
passed
between
you
and
Countess
Rostova
.
I
*NL*
know
I
ca
n't
prevent
your
doing
so
,
but
if
you
have
a
spark
of
*NL*
conscience
...
''
Pierre
paced
the
room
several
times
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
sat
at
a
table
frowning
and
biting
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
you
must
understand
that
besides
your
pleasure
there
is
such
*NL*
a
thing
as
other
people
's
happiness
and
peace
,
and
that
you
are
ruining
*NL*
a
whole
life
for
the
sake
of
amusing
yourself
!
Amuse
yourself
with
women
*NL*
like
my
wife
--
with
them
you
are
within
your
rights
,
for
they
know
what
*NL*
you
want
of
them
.
They
are
armed
against
you
by
the
same
experience
of
*NL*
debauchery
;
but
to
promise
a
maid
to
marry
her
...
to
deceive
,
to
*NL*
kidnap
...
Do
n't
you
understand
that
it
is
as
mean
as
beating
an
old
man
*NL*
or
a
child
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
paused
and
looked
at
Anatole
no
longer
with
an
angry
but
with
a
*NL*
questioning
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
eh
?
''
said
Anatole
,
growing
more
confident
as
*NL*
Pierre
mastered
his
wrath
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
and
do
n't
want
to
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
not
looking
at
Pierre
and
with
a
slight
tremor
of
his
lower
jaw
,
*NL*
``
but
you
have
used
such
words
to
me
--
`
mean
'
and
so
on
--
which
as
a
man
of
*NL*
honor
I
ca
n't
allow
anyone
to
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
glanced
at
him
with
amazement
,
unable
to
understand
what
he
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
it
was
tete-a-tete
,
''
Anatole
continued
,
``
still
I
ca
n't
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
satisfaction
you
want
?
''
said
Pierre
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
at
least
take
back
your
words
.
What
?
If
you
want
me
to
do
as
*NL*
you
wish
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
them
back
,
I
take
them
back
!
''
said
Pierre
,
``
and
I
ask
you
to
*NL*
forgive
me
.
''
Pierre
involuntarily
glanced
at
the
loose
button
.
``
And
if
*NL*
you
require
money
for
your
journey
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anatole
smiled
.
The
expression
of
that
base
and
cringing
smile
,
which
*NL*
Pierre
knew
so
well
in
his
wife
,
revolted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
vile
and
heartless
brood
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
and
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Anatole
left
for
Petersburg

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
drove
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
to
tell
her
of
the
fulfillment
of
her
*NL*
wish
that
Kuragin
should
be
banished
from
Moscow
.
The
whole
house
was
in
*NL*
a
state
of
alarm
and
commotion
.
Natasha
was
very
ill
,
having
,
as
Marya
*NL*
Dmitrievna
told
him
in
secret
,
poisoned
herself
the
night
after
she
had
*NL*
been
told
that
Anatole
was
married
,
with
some
arsenic
she
had
stealthily
*NL*
procured
.
After
swallowing
a
little
she
had
been
so
frightened
that
she
*NL*
woke
Sonya
and
told
her
what
she
had
done
.
The
necessary
antidotes
had
*NL*
been
administered
in
time
and
she
was
now
out
of
danger
,
though
still
so
*NL*
weak
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
move
her
to
the
country
,
and
so
*NL*
the
countess
had
been
sent
for
.
Pierre
saw
the
distracted
count
,
and
*NL*
Sonya
,
who
had
a
tear-stained
face
,
but
he
could
not
see
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
dined
at
the
club
that
day
and
heard
on
all
sides
gossip
about
*NL*
the
attempted
abduction
of
Rostova
.
He
resolutely
denied
these
rumors
,
*NL*
assuring
everyone
that
nothing
had
happened
except
that
his
brother-in
-
*NL*
law
had
proposed
to
her
and
been
refused
.
It
seemed
to
Pierre
that
it
*NL*
was
his
duty
to
conceal
the
whole
affair
and
re-establish
Natasha
's
*NL*
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
awaiting
Prince
Andrew
's
return
with
dread
and
went
every
day
to
*NL*
the
old
prince
's
for
news
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Prince
Bolkonski
heard
all
the
rumors
current
in
the
town
from
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
had
read
the
note
to
Princess
Mary
in
which
*NL*
Natasha
had
broken
off
her
engagement
.
He
seemed
in
better
spirits
than
*NL*
usual
and
awaited
his
son
with
great
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
after
Anatole
's
departure
Pierre
received
a
note
from
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
informing
him
of
his
arrival
and
asking
him
to
come
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
reached
Moscow
,
Prince
Andrew
had
received
from
his
father
*NL*
Natasha
's
note
to
Princess
Mary
breaking
off
her
engagement
*NL*
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
had
purloined
it
from
Princess
Mary
and
given
it
*NL*
to
the
old
prince
-RRB-
,
and
he
heard
from
him
the
story
of
Natasha
's
*NL*
elopement
,
with
additions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
arrived
in
the
evening
and
Pierre
came
to
see
him
next
*NL*
morning
.
Pierre
expected
to
find
Prince
Andrew
in
almost
the
same
state
*NL*
as
Natasha
and
was
therefore
surprised
on
entering
the
drawing
room
to
*NL*
hear
him
in
the
study
talking
in
a
loud
animated
voice
about
some
*NL*
intrigue
going
on
in
Petersburg
.
The
old
prince
's
voice
and
another
now
*NL*
and
then
interrupted
him
.
Princess
Mary
came
out
to
meet
Pierre
.
She
*NL*
sighed
,
looking
toward
the
door
of
the
room
where
Prince
Andrew
was
,
*NL*
evidently
intending
to
express
her
sympathy
with
his
sorrow
,
but
Pierre
*NL*
saw
by
her
face
that
she
was
glad
both
at
what
had
happened
and
at
the
*NL*
way
her
brother
had
taken
the
news
of
Natasha
's
faithlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
expected
it
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
I
know
his
pride
will
not
let
*NL*
him
express
his
feelings
,
but
still
he
has
taken
it
better
,
far
better
,
*NL*
than
I
expected
.
Evidently
it
had
to
be
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
possible
that
all
is
really
ended
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
.
She
did
not
understand
*NL*
how
he
could
ask
such
a
question
.
Pierre
went
into
the
study
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
greatly
changed
and
plainly
in
better
health
,
but
with
a
fresh
*NL*
horizontal
wrinkle
between
his
brows
,
stood
in
civilian
dress
facing
his
*NL*
father
and
Prince
Meshcherski
,
warmly
disputing
and
vigorously
*NL*
gesticulating
.
The
conversation
was
about
Speranski
--
the
news
of
whose
*NL*
sudden
exile
and
alleged
treachery
had
just
reached
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
he
is
censured
and
accused
by
all
who
were
enthusiastic
about
him
a
*NL*
month
ago
,
''
Prince
Andrew
was
saying
,
``
and
by
those
who
were
unable
to
*NL*
understand
his
aims
.
To
judge
a
man
who
is
in
disfavor
and
to
throw
on
*NL*
him
all
the
blame
of
other
men
's
mistakes
is
very
easy
,
but
I
maintain
*NL*
that
if
anything
good
has
been
accomplished
in
this
reign
it
was
done
by
*NL*
him
,
by
him
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
at
the
sight
of
Pierre
.
His
face
quivered
and
immediately
*NL*
assumed
a
vindictive
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Posterity
will
do
him
justice
,
''
he
concluded
,
and
at
once
turned
to
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
you
?
Still
getting
stouter
?
''
he
said
with
animation
,
but
*NL*
the
new
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
deepened
.
``
Yes
,
I
am
well
,
''
he
said
in
*NL*
answer
to
Pierre
's
question
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Pierre
that
smile
said
plainly
:
``
I
am
well
,
but
my
health
is
now
of
*NL*
no
use
to
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
words
to
Pierre
about
the
awful
roads
from
the
Polish
*NL*
frontier
,
about
people
he
had
met
in
Switzerland
who
knew
Pierre
,
and
*NL*
about
M.
Dessalles
,
whom
he
had
brought
from
abroad
to
be
his
son
's
*NL*
tutor
,
Prince
Andrew
again
joined
warmly
in
the
conversation
about
*NL*
Speranski
which
was
still
going
on
between
the
two
old
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
were
treason
,
or
proofs
of
secret
relations
with
Napoleon
,
*NL*
they
would
have
been
made
public
,
''
he
said
with
warmth
and
haste
.
``
I
do
*NL*
not
,
and
never
did
,
like
Speranski
personally
,
but
I
like
justice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
now
recognized
in
his
friend
a
need
with
which
he
was
only
too
*NL*
familiar
,
to
get
excited
and
to
have
arguments
about
extraneous
matters
*NL*
in
order
to
stifle
thoughts
that
were
too
oppressive
and
too
intimate
.
*NL*
When
Prince
Meshcherski
had
left
,
Prince
Andrew
took
Pierre
's
arm
and
*NL*
asked
him
into
the
room
that
had
been
assigned
him
.
A
bed
had
been
made
*NL*
up
there
,
and
some
open
portmanteaus
and
trunks
stood
about
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
went
to
one
and
took
out
a
small
casket
,
from
which
he
drew
a
*NL*
packet
wrapped
in
paper
.
He
did
it
all
silently
and
very
quickly
.
He
*NL*
stood
up
and
coughed
.
His
face
was
gloomy
and
his
lips
compressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
troubling
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
saw
that
Prince
Andrew
was
going
to
speak
of
Natasha
,
and
his
*NL*
broad
face
expressed
pity
and
sympathy
.
This
expression
irritated
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
and
in
a
determined
,
ringing
,
and
unpleasant
tone
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
received
a
refusal
from
Countess
Rostova
and
have
heard
reports
*NL*
of
your
brother-in-law
having
sought
her
hand
,
or
something
of
that
*NL*
kind
.
Is
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
true
and
untrue
,
''
Pierre
began
;
but
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
her
letters
and
her
portrait
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
packet
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
this
to
the
countess
...
if
you
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
ill
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
is
here
still
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
And
Prince
Kuragin
?
''
he
*NL*
added
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
left
long
ago
.
She
has
been
at
death
's
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
much
regret
her
illness
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
;
and
he
smiled
like
his
*NL*
father
,
coldly
,
maliciously
,
and
unpleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Monsieur
Kuragin
has
not
honored
Countess
Rostova
with
his
hand
?
''
*NL*
said
Prince
Andrew
,
and
he
snorted
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
not
marry
,
for
he
was
married
already
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
laughed
disagreeably
,
again
reminding
one
of
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
your
brother-in-law
now
,
if
I
may
ask
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
gone
to
Peters
...
But
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Tell
Countess
Rostova
*NL*
that
she
was
and
is
perfectly
free
and
that
I
wish
her
all
that
is
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
the
packet
.
Prince
Andrew
,
as
if
trying
to
remember
whether
*NL*
he
had
something
more
to
say
,
or
waiting
to
see
if
Pierre
would
say
*NL*
anything
,
looked
fixedly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
do
you
remember
our
discussion
in
Petersburg
?
''
asked
Pierre
,
*NL*
``
about
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Prince
Andrew
hastily
.
``
I
said
that
a
fallen
woman
*NL*
should
be
forgiven
,
but
I
did
n't
say
I
could
forgive
her
.
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
this
be
compared
...
?
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
him
and
cried
sharply
:
``
Yes
,
ask
her
hand
*NL*
again
,
be
magnanimous
,
and
so
on
?
...
Yes
,
that
would
be
very
noble
,
but
*NL*
I
am
unable
to
follow
in
that
gentleman
's
footsteps
.
If
you
wish
to
be
*NL*
my
friend
never
speak
to
me
of
that
...
of
all
that
!
Well
,
good-by
.
So
*NL*
you
'll
give
her
the
packet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
old
prince
and
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
seemed
livelier
than
usual
.
Princess
Mary
was
the
same
as
*NL*
always
,
but
beneath
her
sympathy
for
her
brother
,
Pierre
noticed
her
*NL*
satisfaction
that
the
engagement
had
been
broken
off
.
Looking
at
them
*NL*
Pierre
realized
what
contempt
and
animosity
they
all
felt
for
the
*NL*
Rostovs
,
and
that
it
was
impossible
in
their
presence
even
to
mention
*NL*
the
name
of
her
who
could
give
up
Prince
Andrew
for
anyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
the
talk
turned
on
the
war
,
the
approach
of
which
was
becoming
*NL*
evident
.
Prince
Andrew
talked
incessantly
,
arguing
now
with
his
father
,
*NL*
now
with
the
Swiss
tutor
Dessalles
,
and
showing
an
unnatural
animation
,
*NL*
the
cause
of
which
Pierre
so
well
understood
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
Pierre
went
to
the
Rostovs
'
to
fulfill
the
commission
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
.
Natasha
was
in
bed
,
the
count
at
the
club
,
and
Pierre
,
*NL*
after
giving
the
letters
to
Sonya
,
went
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
who
was
*NL*
interested
to
know
how
Prince
Andrew
had
taken
the
news
.
Ten
minutes
*NL*
later
Sonya
came
to
Marya
Dmitrievna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
insists
on
seeing
Count
Peter
Kirilovich
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
?
Are
we
to
take
him
up
to
her
?
The
room
there
has
not
been
*NL*
tidied
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
has
dressed
and
gone
into
the
drawing
room
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Dmitrievna
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
her
mother
come
?
She
has
worried
me
to
death
!
Now
mind
,
do
n't
*NL*
tell
her
everything
!

said
she
to
Pierre
.
``
One
has
n't
the
heart
to
scold
*NL*
her
,
she
is
so

*NL*
Natasha
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
,
emaciated
,
with
*NL*
a
pale
set
face
,
but
not
at
all
shamefaced
as
Pierre
expected
to
find
*NL*
her
.
When
he
appeared
at
the
door
she
grew
flurried
,
evidently
undecided
*NL*
whether
to
go
to
meet
him
or
to
wait
till
he
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
hastened
to
her
.
He
thought
she
would
give
him
her
hand
as
usual
;
*NL*
but
she
,
stepping
up
to
him
,
stopped
,
breathing
heavily
,
her
arms
*NL*
hanging
lifelessly
just
in
the
pose
she
used
to
stand
in
when
she
went
*NL*
to
the
middle
of
the
ballroom
to
sing
,
but
with
quite
a
different
*NL*
expression
of
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Kirilovich
,
''
she
began
rapidly
,
``
Prince
Bolkonski
was
your
*NL*
friend
--
is
your
friend
,
''
she
corrected
herself
.
-LRB-
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
everything
that
had
once
been
must
now
be
different
.
-RRB-
``
He
told
me
once
*NL*
to
apply
to
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
sniffed
as
he
looked
at
her
,
but
did
not
speak
.
Till
then
he
had
*NL*
reproached
her
in
his
heart
and
tried
to
despise
her
,
but
he
now
felt
so
*NL*
sorry
for
her
that
there
was
no
room
in
his
soul
for
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
here
now
:
tell
him
...
to
for
...
forgive
me
!
''
She
stopped
and
*NL*
breathed
still
more
quickly
,
but
did
not
shed
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
will
tell
him
,
''
answered
Pierre
;
``
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
evidently
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
what
he
might
think
she
*NL*
had
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
know
all
is
over
,
''
she
said
hurriedly
.
``
No
,
that
can
never
be
.
*NL*
I
'm
only
tormented
by
the
wrong
I
have
done
him
.
Tell
him
only
that
I
*NL*
beg
him
to
forgive
,
forgive
,
forgive
me
for
everything

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
trembled
all
over
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sense
of
pity
he
had
never
before
known
overflowed
Pierre
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
him
,
I
will
tell
him
everything
once
more
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
``
But
...
I
should
like
to
know
one
thing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
what

''
Natasha
's
eyes
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
,
did
you
love
...
''
Pierre
did
not
know
how
to
*NL*
refer
to
Anatole
and
flushed
at
the
thought
of
him
--
``
did
you
love
that
*NL*
bad
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
call
him
bad
!
''
said
Natasha
.
``
But
I
do
n't
know
,
do
n't
know
at
*NL*
all
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
cry
and
a
still
greater
sense
of
pity
,
tenderness
,
and
love
*NL*
welled
up
in
Pierre
.
He
felt
the
tears
trickle
under
his
spectacles
and
*NL*
hoped
they
would
not
be
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
speak
of
it
any
more
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Pierre
,
and
his
gentle
,
*NL*
cordial
tone
suddenly
seemed
very
strange
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
speak
of
it
,
my
dear

I
'll
tell
him
everything

but
one
thing
*NL*
I
beg
of
you
,
consider
me
your
friend
and
if
you
want
help
,
advice
,
or
*NL*
simply
to
open
your
heart
to
someone
--
not
now
,
but
when
your
mind
is
*NL*
clearer
think
of
me
!
''
He
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
``
I
shall
be
happy
*NL*
if
it
's
in
my
power
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
grew
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
me
like
that
.
I
am
not
worth
it
!
''
exclaimed
Natasha
and
*NL*
turned
to
leave
the
room
,
but
Pierre
held
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
he
had
something
more
to
say
to
her
.
But
when
he
said
it
he
was
*NL*
amazed
at
his
own
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
stop
!
You
have
your
whole
life
before
you
,
''
said
he
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
me
?
No
!
All
is
over
for
me
,
''
she
replied
with
shame
and
self
-
*NL*
abasement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
over
?
''
he
repeated
.
``
If
I
were
not
myself
,
but
the
handsomest
,
*NL*
cleverest
,
and
best
man
in
the
world
,
and
were
free
,
I
would
this
moment
*NL*
ask
on
my
knees
for
your
hand
and
your
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
for
many
days
Natasha
wept
tears
of
gratitude
and
*NL*
tenderness
,
and
glancing
at
Pierre
she
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
too
when
she
had
gone
almost
ran
into
the
anteroom
,
restraining
*NL*
tears
of
tenderness
and
joy
that
choked
him
,
and
without
finding
the
*NL*
sleeves
of
his
fur
cloak
threw
it
on
and
got
into
his
sleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
now
,
your
excellency
?
''
asked
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
Pierre
asked
himself
.
``
Where
can
I
go
now
?
Surely
not
to
the
*NL*
club
or
to
pay
calls
?
''
All
men
seemed
so
pitiful
,
so
poor
,
in
comparison
*NL*
with
this
feeling
of
tenderness
and
love
he
experienced
:
in
comparison
*NL*
with
that
softened
,
grateful
,
last
look
she
had
given
him
through
her
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
!
''
said
Pierre
,
and
despite
twenty-two
degrees
of
frost
Fahrenheit
*NL*
he
threw
open
the
bearskin
cloak
from
his
broad
chest
and
inhaled
the
*NL*
air
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
and
frosty
.
Above
the
dirty
,
ill-lit
streets
,
above
the
*NL*
black
roofs
,
stretched
the
dark
starry
sky
.
Only
looking
up
at
the
sky
*NL*
did
Pierre
cease
to
feel
how
sordid
and
humiliating
were
all
mundane
*NL*
things
compared
with
the
heights
to
which
his
soul
had
just
been
raised
.
*NL*
At
the
entrance
to
the
Arbat
Square
an
immense
expanse
of
dark
starry
*NL*
sky
presented
itself
to
his
eyes
.
Almost
in
the
center
of
it
,
above
the
*NL*
Prechistenka
Boulevard
,
surrounded
and
sprinkled
on
all
sides
by
stars
*NL*
but
distinguished
from
them
all
by
its
nearness
to
the
earth
,
its
white
*NL*
light
,
and
its
long
uplifted
tail
,
shone
the
enormous
and
brilliant
*NL*
comet
of
1812
--
the
comet
which
was
said
to
portend
all
kinds
of
woes
and
*NL*
the
end
of
the
world
.
In
Pierre
,
however
,
that
comet
with
its
long
*NL*
luminous
tail
aroused
no
feeling
of
fear
.
On
the
contrary
he
gazed
*NL*
joyfully
,
his
eyes
moist
with
tears
,
at
this
bright
comet
which
,
having
*NL*
traveled
in
its
orbit
with
inconceivable
velocity
through
immeasurable
*NL*
space
,
seemed
suddenly
--
like
an
arrow
piercing
the
earth
--
to
remain
*NL*
fixed
in
a
chosen
spot
,
vigorously
holding
its
tail
erect
,
shining
and
*NL*
displaying
its
white
light
amid
countless
other
scintillating
stars
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
Pierre
that
this
comet
fully
responded
to
what
was
passing
in
*NL*
his
own
softened
and
uplifted
soul
,
now
blossoming
into
a
new
life
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
close
of
the
year
1811
intensified
arming
and
concentrating
of
*NL*
the
forces
of
Western
Europe
began
,
and
in
1812
these
forces
--
millions
*NL*
of
men
,
reckoning
those
transporting
and
feeding
the
army
--
moved
from
*NL*
the
west
eastwards
to
the
Russian
frontier
,
toward
which
since
1811
*NL*
Russian
forces
had
been
similarly
drawn
.
On
the
twelfth
of
June
,
1812
,
*NL*
the
forces
of
Western
Europe
crossed
the
Russian
frontier
and
war
began
,
*NL*
that
is
,
an
event
took
place
opposed
to
human
reason
and
to
human
*NL*
nature
.
Millions
of
men
perpetrated
against
one
another
such
innumerable
*NL*
crimes
,
frauds
,
treacheries
,
thefts
,
forgeries
,
issues
of
false
money
,
*NL*
burglaries
,
incendiarisms
,
and
murders
as
in
whole
centuries
are
not
*NL*
recorded
in
the
annals
of
all
the
law
courts
of
the
world
,
but
which
*NL*
those
who
committed
them
did
not
at
the
time
regard
as
being
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
produced
this
extraordinary
occurrence
?
What
were
its
causes
?
The
*NL*
historians
tell
us
with
naive
assurance
that
its
causes
were
the
wrongs
*NL*
inflicted
on
the
Duke
of
Oldenburg
,
the
nonobservance
of
the
Continental
*NL*
System
,
the
ambition
of
Napoleon
,
the
firmness
of
Alexander
,
the
*NL*
mistakes
of
the
diplomatists
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consequently
,
it
would
only
have
been
necessary
for
Metternich
,
*NL*
Rumyantsev
,
or
Talleyrand
,
between
a
levee
and
an
evening
party
,
to
have
*NL*
taken
proper
pains
and
written
a
more
adroit
note
,
or
for
Napoleon
to
*NL*
have
written
to
Alexander
:
``
My
respected
Brother
,
I
consent
to
restore
*NL*
the
duchy
to
the
Duke
of
Oldenburg
''
--
and
there
would
have
been
no
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
understand
that
the
matter
seemed
like
that
to
contemporaries
.
It
*NL*
naturally
seemed
to
Napoleon
that
the
war
was
caused
by
England
's
*NL*
intrigues
-LRB-
as
in
fact
he
said
on
the
island
of
St.
Helena
-RRB-
.
It
naturally
*NL*
seemed
to
members
of
the
English
Parliament
that
the
cause
of
the
war
*NL*
was
Napoleon
's
ambition
;
to
the
Duke
of
Oldenburg
,
that
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
war
was
the
violence
done
to
him
;
to
businessmen
that
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
war
was
the
Continental
System
which
was
ruining
Europe
;
to
the
generals
*NL*
and
old
soldiers
that
the
chief
reason
for
the
war
was
the
necessity
of
*NL*
giving
them
employment
;
to
the
legitimists
of
that
day
that
it
was
the
*NL*
need
of
re-establishing
les
bons
principes
,
and
to
the
diplomatists
of
*NL*
that
time
that
it
all
resulted
from
the
fact
that
the
alliance
between
*NL*
Russia
and
Austria
in
1809
had
not
been
sufficiently
well
concealed
from
*NL*
Napoleon
,
and
from
the
awkward
wording
of
Memorandum
No.
178
.
It
is
*NL*
natural
that
these
and
a
countless
and
infinite
quantity
of
other
*NL*
reasons
,
the
number
depending
on
the
endless
diversity
of
points
of
*NL*
view
,
presented
themselves
to
the
men
of
that
day
;
but
to
us
,
to
*NL*
posterity
who
view
the
thing
that
happened
in
all
its
magnitude
and
*NL*
perceive
its
plain
and
terrible
meaning
,
these
causes
seem
insufficient
.
*NL*
To
us
it
is
incomprehensible
that
millions
of
Christian
men
killed
and
*NL*
tortured
each
other
either
because
Napoleon
was
ambitious
or
Alexander
*NL*
was
firm
,
or
because
England
's
policy
was
astute
or
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Oldenburg
wronged
.
We
can
not
grasp
what
connection
such
circumstances
*NL*
have
with
the
actual
fact
of
slaughter
and
violence
:
why
because
the
*NL*
Duke
was
wronged
,
thousands
of
men
from
the
other
side
of
Europe
killed
*NL*
and
ruined
the
people
of
Smolensk
and
Moscow
and
were
killed
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
us
,
their
descendants
,
who
are
not
historians
and
are
not
carried
*NL*
away
by
the
process
of
research
and
can
therefore
regard
the
event
with
*NL*
unclouded
common
sense
,
an
incalculable
number
of
causes
present
*NL*
themselves
.
The
deeper
we
delve
in
search
of
these
causes
the
more
of
*NL*
them
we
find
;
and
each
separate
cause
or
whole
series
of
causes
appears
*NL*
to
us
equally
valid
in
itself
and
equally
false
by
its
insignificance
*NL*
compared
to
the
magnitude
of
the
events
,
and
by
its
impotence
--
apart
*NL*
from
the
cooperation
of
all
the
other
coincident
causes
--
to
occasion
the
*NL*
event
.
To
us
,
the
wish
or
objection
of
this
or
that
French
corporal
to
*NL*
serve
a
second
term
appears
as
much
a
cause
as
Napoleon
's
refusal
to
*NL*
withdraw
his
troops
beyond
the
Vistula
and
to
restore
the
duchy
of
*NL*
Oldenburg
;
for
had
he
not
wished
to
serve
,
and
had
a
second
,
a
third
,
*NL*
and
a
thousandth
corporal
and
private
also
refused
,
there
would
have
*NL*
been
so
many
less
men
in
Napoleon
's
army
and
the
war
could
not
have
*NL*
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Napoleon
not
taken
offense
at
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
*NL*
beyond
the
Vistula
,
and
not
ordered
his
troops
to
advance
,
there
would
*NL*
have
been
no
war
;
but
had
all
his
sergeants
objected
to
serving
a
second
*NL*
term
then
also
there
could
have
been
no
war
.
Nor
could
there
have
been
a
*NL*
war
had
there
been
no
English
intrigues
and
no
Duke
of
Oldenburg
,
and
*NL*
had
Alexander
not
felt
insulted
,
and
had
there
not
been
an
autocratic
*NL*
government
in
Russia
,
or
a
Revolution
in
France
and
a
subsequent
*NL*
dictatorship
and
Empire
,
or
all
the
things
that
produced
the
French
*NL*
Revolution
,
and
so
on
.
Without
each
of
these
causes
nothing
could
have
*NL*
happened
.
So
all
these
causes
--
myriads
of
causes
--
coincided
to
bring
it
*NL*
about
.
And
so
there
was
no
one
cause
for
that
occurrence
,
but
it
had
to
*NL*
occur
because
it
had
to
.
Millions
of
men
,
renouncing
their
human
*NL*
feelings
and
reason
,
had
to
go
from
west
to
east
to
slay
their
fellows
,
*NL*
just
as
some
centuries
previously
hordes
of
men
had
come
from
the
east
*NL*
to
the
west
,
slaying
their
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
actions
of
Napoleon
and
Alexander
,
on
whose
words
the
event
seemed
*NL*
to
hang
,
were
as
little
voluntary
as
the
actions
of
any
soldier
who
was
*NL*
drawn
into
the
campaign
by
lot
or
by
conscription
.
This
could
not
be
*NL*
otherwise
,
for
in
order
that
the
will
of
Napoleon
and
Alexander
-LRB-
on
whom
*NL*
the
event
seemed
to
depend
-RRB-
should
be
carried
out
,
the
concurrence
of
*NL*
innumerable
circumstances
was
needed
without
any
one
of
which
the
event
*NL*
could

It

millions

lay
the

the
soldiers
who
fired

transported
*NL*

should
consent

so

that

*NL*
performed
at

becomes
irrevocable

his

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-ninth
of
May
Napoleon
left
Dresden
,
where
he
had
spent
*NL*
three
weeks
surrounded
by
a
court
that
included
princes
,
dukes
,
kings
,
*NL*
and
even
an
emperor
.
Before
leaving
,
Napoleon
showed
favor
to
the
*NL*
emperor
,
kings
,
and
princes
who
had
deserved
it
,
reprimanded
the
kings
*NL*
and
princes
with
whom
he
was
dissatisfied
,
presented
pearls
and
diamonds
*NL*
of
his
own
--
that
is
,
which
he
had
taken
from
other
kings
--
to
the
Empress
*NL*
of
Austria
,
and
having
,
as
his
historian
tells
us
,
tenderly
embraced
the
*NL*
Empress
Marie
Louise
--
who
regarded
him
as
her
husband
,
though
he
had
*NL*
left
another
wife
in
Paris
--
left
her
grieved
by
the
parting
which
she
*NL*
seemed
hardly
able
to
bear
.
Though
the
diplomatists
still
firmly
*NL*
believed
in
the
possibility
of
peace
and
worked
zealously
to
that
end
,
*NL*
and
though
the
Emperor
Napoleon
himself
wrote
a
letter
to
Alexander
,
*NL*
calling
him
Monsieur
mon
frere
,
and
sincerely
assured
him
that
he
did
*NL*
not
want
war
and
would
always
love
and
honor
him
--
yet
he
set
off
to
join
*NL*
his
army
,
and
at
every
station
gave
fresh
orders
to
accelerate
the
*NL*
movement
of
his
troops
from
west
to
east
.
He
went
in
a
traveling
coach
*NL*
with
six
horses
,
surrounded
by
pages
,
aides-de-camp
,
and
an
escort
,
*NL*
along
the
road
to
Posen
,
Thorn
,
Danzig
,
and
Konigsberg
.
At
each
of
these
*NL*
towns
thousands
of
people
met
him
with
excitement
and
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
army
was
moving
from
west
to
east
,
and
relays
of
six
horses
carried
*NL*
him
in
the
same
direction
.
On
the
tenth
of
June
,
*
coming
up
with
the
*NL*
army
,
he
spent
the
night
in
apartments
prepared
for
him
on
the
estate
of
*NL*
a
Polish
count
in
the
Vilkavisski
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Old
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
overtaking
the
army
,
he
went
in
a
carriage
to
the
Niemen
,
and
,
*NL*
changing
into
a
Polish
uniform
,
he
drove
to
the
riverbank
in
order
to
*NL*
select
a
place
for
the
crossing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
,
on
the
other
side
,
some
Cossacks
-LRB-

Cosaques
-RRB-
and
the
wide
-
*NL*
spreading
steppes
in
the
midst
of
which
lay
the
holy
city
of
Moscow
*NL*
-LRB-
Moscou
,
la
ville
sainte
-RRB-
,
the
capital
of
a
realm
such
as
the
Scythia
*NL*
into
which
Alexander
the
Great
had
marched
--
Napoleon
unexpectedly
,
and
*NL*
contrary
alike
to
strategic
and
diplomatic
considerations
,
ordered
an
*NL*
advance
,
and
the
next
day
his
army
began
to
cross
the
Niemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
of
the
twelfth
of
June
he
came
out
of
his
tent
,
*NL*
which
was
pitched
that
day
on
the
steep
left
bank
of
the
Niemen
,
and
*NL*
looked
through
a
spyglass
at
the
streams
of
his
troops
pouring
out
of
*NL*
the
Vilkavisski
forest
and
flowing
over
the
three
bridges
thrown
across
*NL*
the
river
.
The
troops
,
knowing
of
the
Emperor
's
presence
,
were
on
the
*NL*
lookout
for
him
,
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
a
figure
in
an
overcoat
*NL*
and
a
cocked
hat
standing
apart
from
his
suite
in
front
of
his
tent
on
*NL*
the
hill
,
they
threw
up
their
caps
and
shouted
:
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
and
*NL*
one
after
another
poured
in
a
ceaseless
stream
out
of
the
vast
forest
*NL*
that
had
concealed
them
and
,
separating
,
flowed
on
and
on
by
the
three
*NL*
bridges
to
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
go
into

it

came
*NL*
the
voices
of
men
,
old
and
young
,
of
most
diverse
characters
and
social
*NL*
positions
.
On
the
faces
of
all
was
one
common
expression
of
joy
at
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
long-expected
campaign
and
of
rapture
and
devotion
*NL*
to
the
man
in
the
gray
coat
who
was
standing
on
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
thirteenth
of
June
a
rather
small
,
thoroughbred
Arab
horse
was
*NL*
brought
to
Napoleon
.
He
mounted
it
and
rode
at
a
gallop
to
one
of
the
*NL*
bridges
over
the
Niemen
,
deafened
continually
by
incessant
and
rapturous
*NL*
acclamations
which
he
evidently
endured
only
because
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
forbid
the
soldiers
to
express
their
love
of
him
by
such
shouting
,
*NL*
but
the
shouting
which
accompanied
him
everywhere
disturbed
him
and
*NL*
distracted
him
from
the
military
cares
that
had
occupied
him
from
the
*NL*
time
he
joined
the
army
.
He
rode
across
one
of
the
swaying
pontoon
*NL*
bridges
to
the
farther
side
,
turned
sharply
to
the
left
,
and
galloped
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
Kovno
,
preceded
by
enraptured
,
mounted
chasseurs
of
the
*NL*
Guard
who
,
breathless
with
delight
,
galloped
ahead
to
clear
a
path
for
*NL*
him
through
the
troops
.
On
reaching
the
broad
river
Viliya
,
he
stopped
*NL*
near
a
regiment
of
Polish
uhlans
stationed
by
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vivat
!
''
shouted
the
Poles
,
ecstatically
,
breaking
their
ranks
and
*NL*
pressing
against
one
another
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
looked
up
and
down
the
river
,
dismounted
,
and
sat
down
on
a
log
*NL*
that
lay
on
the
bank
.
At
a
mute
sign
from
him
,
a
telescope
was
handed
*NL*
him
which
he
rested
on
the
back
of
a
happy
page
who
had
run
up
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
gazed
at
the
opposite
bank
.
Then
he
became
absorbed
in
a
map
laid
*NL*
out
on
the
logs
.
Without
lifting
his
head
he
said
something
,
and
two
of
*NL*
his
aides-de-camp
galloped
off
to
the
Polish
uhlans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
did
he
say
?
''
was
heard
in
the
ranks
of
the
Polish
uhlans
*NL*
when
one
of
the
aides-de-camp
rode
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
was
to
find
a
ford
and
to
cross
the
river
.
The
colonel
of
the
*NL*
Polish
uhlans
,
a
handsome
old
man
,
flushed
and
,
fumbling
in
his
speech
*NL*
from
excitement
,
asked
the
aide-de-camp
whether
he
would
be
permitted
to
*NL*
swim
the
river
with
his
uhlans
instead
of
seeking
a
ford
.
In
evident
*NL*
fear
of
refusal
,
like
a
boy
asking
for
permission
to
get
on
a
horse
,
he
*NL*
begged
to
be
allowed
to
swim
across
the
river
before
the
Emperor
's
eyes
.
*NL*
The
aide-de-camp
replied
that
probably
the
Emperor
would
not
be
*NL*
displeased
at
this
excess
of
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
aide-de-camp
had
said
this
,
the
old
mustached
officer
,
*NL*
with
happy
face
and
sparkling
eyes
,
raised
his
saber
,
shouted
``
Vivat
!
''
*NL*
and
,
commanding
the
uhlans
to
follow
him
,
spurred
his
horse
and
galloped
*NL*
into
the
river
.
He
gave
an
angry
thrust
to
his
horse
,
which
had
grown
*NL*
restive
under
him
,
and
plunged
into
the
water
,
heading
for
the
deepest
*NL*
part
where
the
current
was
swift
.
Hundreds
of
uhlans
galloped
in
after
*NL*
him
.
It
was
cold
and
uncanny
in
the
rapid
current
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
stream
,
and
the
uhlans
caught
hold
of
one
another
as
they
fell
off
their
*NL*
horses
.
Some
of
the
horses
were
drowned
and
some
of
the
men
;
the
others
*NL*
tried
to
swim
on
,
some
in
the
saddle
and
some
clinging
to
their
horses
'
*NL*
manes
.
They
tried
to
make
their
way
forward
to
the
opposite
bank
and
,
*NL*
though
there
was
a
ford
one
third
of
a
mile
away
,
were
proud
that
they
*NL*
were
swimming
and
drowning
in
this
river
under
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
*NL*
sat
on
the
log
and
was
not
even
looking
at
what
they
were
doing
.
When
*NL*
the
aide-de-camp
,
having
returned
and
choosing
an
opportune
moment
,
*NL*
ventured
to
draw
the
Emperor
's
attention
to
the
devotion
of
the
Poles
to
*NL*
his
person
,
the
little
man
in
the
gray
overcoat
got
up
and
,
having
*NL*
summoned
Berthier
,
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
bank
with
him
,
giving
*NL*
him
instructions
and
occasionally
glancing
disapprovingly
at
the
*NL*
drowning
uhlans
who
distracted
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
him
it
was
no
new
conviction
that
his
presence
in
any
part
of
the
*NL*
world
,
from
Africa
to
the
steppes
of
Muscovy
alike
,
was
enough
to
*NL*
dumfound
people
and
impel
them
to
insane
self-oblivion
.
He
called
for
*NL*
his
horse
and
rode
to
his
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
forty
uhlans
were
drowned
in
the
river
,
though
boats
were
sent
to
*NL*
their
assistance
.
The
majority
struggled
back
to
the
bank
from
which
*NL*
they
had
started
.
The
colonel
and
some
of
his
men
got
across
and
with
*NL*
difficulty
clambered
out
on
the
further
bank
.
And
as
soon
as
they
had
*NL*
got
out
,
in
their
soaked
and
streaming
clothes
,
they
shouted
``
Vivat
!
''
*NL*
and
looked
ecstatically
at
the
spot
where
Napoleon
had
been
but
where
he
*NL*
no
longer
was
and
at
that
moment
considered
themselves
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
between
issuing
one
order
that
the
forged
Russian
paper
*NL*
money
prepared
for
use
in
Russia
should
be
delivered
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
and
another
that
a
Saxon
should
be
shot
,
on
whom
a
letter
*NL*
containing
information
about
the
orders
to
the
French
army
had
been
*NL*
found
,
Napoleon
also
gave
instructions
that
the
Polish
colonel
who
had
*NL*
needlessly
plunged
into
the
river
should
be
enrolled
in
the
Legion
*NL*
d'honneur
of
which
Napoleon
was
himself
the
head
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
of
Russia
had
,
meanwhile
,
been
in
Vilna
for
more
than
a
*NL*
month
,
reviewing
troops
and
holding
maneuvers
.
Nothing
was
ready
for
the
*NL*
war
that
everyone
expected
and
to
prepare
for
which
the
Emperor
had
come
*NL*
from
Petersburg
.
There
was
no
general
plan
of
action
.
The
vacillation
*NL*
between
the
various
plans
that
were
proposed
had
even
increased
after
*NL*
the
Emperor
had
been
at
headquarters
for
a
month
.
Each
of
the
three
*NL*
armies
had
its
own
commander-in-chief
,
but
there
was
no
supreme
*NL*
commander
of
all
the
forces
,
and
the
Emperor
did
not
assume
that
*NL*
responsibility
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
longer
the
Emperor
remained
in
Vilna
the
less
did
everybody
--
tired
*NL*
of
waiting
--
prepare
for
the
war
.
All
the
efforts
of
those
who
surrounded
*NL*
the
sovereign
seemed
directed
merely
to
making
him
spend
his
time
*NL*
pleasantly
and
forget
that
war
was
impending
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
June
,
after
many
balls
and
fetes
given
by
the
Polish
magnates
,
by
the
*NL*
courtiers
,
and
by
the
Emperor
himself
,
it
occurred
to
one
of
the
Polish
*NL*
aides-de-camp
in
attendance
that
a
dinner
and
ball
should
be
given
for
*NL*
the
Emperor
by
his
aides-de-camp
.
This
idea
was
eagerly
received
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
gave
his
consent
.
The
aides-de-camp
collected
money
by
*NL*
subscription
.
The
lady
who
was
thought
to
be
most
pleasing
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
was
invited
to
act
as
hostess
.
Count
Bennigsen
,
being
a
*NL*
landowner
in
the
Vilna
province
,
offered
his
country
house
for
the
fete
,
*NL*
and
the
thirteenth
of
June
was
fixed
for
a
ball
,
dinner
,
regatta
,
and
*NL*
fireworks
at
Zakret
,
Count
Bennigsen
's
country
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
day
that
Napoleon
issued
the
order
to
cross
the
Niemen
,
and
his
*NL*
vanguard
,
driving
off
the
Cossacks
,
crossed
the
Russian
frontier
,
*NL*
Alexander
spent
the
evening
at
the
entertainment
given
by
his
aides-de
-
*NL*
camp
at
Bennigsen
's
country
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
gay
and
brilliant
fete
.
Connoisseurs
of
such
matters
declared
*NL*
that
rarely
had
so
many
beautiful
women
been
assembled
in
one
place
.
*NL*
Countess
Bezukhova
was
present
among
other
Russian
ladies
who
had
*NL*
followed
the
sovereign
from
Petersburg
to
Vilna
and
eclipsed
the
refined
*NL*
Polish
ladies
by
her
massive
,
so-called
Russian
type
of
beauty
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
noticed
her
and
honored
her
with
a
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
Drubetskoy
,
having
left
his
wife
in
Moscow
and
being
for
the
*NL*
present
en
garcon
-LRB-
as
he
phrased
it
-RRB-
,
was
also
there
and
,
though
not
an
*NL*
aide-de-camp
,
had
subscribed
a
large
sum
toward
the
expenses
.
Boris
was
*NL*
now
a
rich
man
who
had
risen
to
high
honors
and
no
longer
sought
*NL*
patronage
but
stood
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
highest
of
those
of
his
*NL*
own
age
.
He
was
meeting
Helene
in
Vilna
after
not
having
seen
her
for
a
*NL*
long
time
and
did
not
recall
the
past
,
but
as
Helene
was
enjoying
the
*NL*
favors
of
a
very
important
personage
and
Boris
had
only
recently
*NL*
married
,
they
met
as
good
friends
of
long
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
dancing
was
still
going
on
.
Helene
,
not
having
a
suitable
*NL*
partner
,
herself
offered
to
dance
the
mazurka
with
Boris
.
They
were
the
*NL*
third
couple
.
Boris
,
coolly
looking
at
Helene
's
dazzling
bare
shoulders
*NL*
which
emerged
from
a
dark
,
gold-embroidered
,
gauze
gown
,
talked
to
her
*NL*
of
old
acquaintances
and
at
the
same
time
,
unaware
of
it
himself
and
*NL*
unnoticed
by
others
,
never
for
an
instant
ceased
to
observe
the
Emperor
*NL*
who
was
in
the
same
room
.
The
Emperor
was
not
dancing
,
he
stood
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
stopping
now
one
pair
and
now
another
with
gracious
words
which
*NL*
he
alone
knew
how
to
utter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
mazurka
began
,
Boris
saw
that
Adjutant
General
Balashev
,
one
of
*NL*
those
in
closest
attendance
on
the
Emperor
,
went
up
to
him
and
contrary
*NL*
to
court
etiquette
stood
near
him
while
he
was
talking
to
a
Polish
lady
.
*NL*
Having
finished
speaking
to
her
,
the
Emperor
looked
inquiringly
at
*NL*
Balashev
and
,
evidently
understanding
that
he
only
acted
thus
because
*NL*
there
were
important
reasons
for
so
doing
,
nodded
slightly
to
the
lady
*NL*
and
turned
to
him
.
Hardly
had
Balashev
begun
to
speak
before
a
look
of
*NL*
amazement
appeared
on
the
Emperor
's
face
.
He
took
Balashev
by
the
arm
*NL*
and
crossed
the
room
with
him
,
unconsciously
clearing
a
path
seven
yards
*NL*
wide
as
the
people
on
both
sides
made
way
for
him
.
Boris
noticed
*NL*
Arakcheev
's
excited
face
when
the
sovereign
went
out
with
Balashev
.
*NL*
Arakcheev
looked
at
the
Emperor
from
under
his
brow
and
,
sniffing
with
*NL*
his
red
nose
,
stepped
forward
from
the
crowd
as
if
expecting
the
Emperor
*NL*
to
address
him
.
-LRB-
Boris
understood
that
Arakcheev
envied
Balashev
and
was
*NL*
displeased
that
evidently
important
news
had
reached
the
Emperor
*NL*
otherwise
than
through
himself
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Emperor
and
Balashev
passed
out
into
the
illuminated
garden
*NL*
without
noticing
Arakcheev
who
,
holding
his
sword
and
glancing
*NL*
wrathfully
around
,
followed
some
twenty
paces
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
Boris
was
going
through
the
figures
of
the
mazurka
,
he
was
*NL*
worried
by
the
question
of
what
news
Balashev
had
brought
and
how
he
*NL*
could
find
it
out
before
others
.
In
the
figure
in
which
he
had
to
choose
*NL*
two
ladies
,
he
whispered
to
Helene
that
he
meant
to
choose
Countess
*NL*
Potocka
who
,
he
thought
,
had
gone
out
onto
the
veranda
,
and
glided
over
*NL*
the
parquet
to
the
door
opening
into
the
garden
,
where
,
seeing
Balashev
*NL*
and
the
Emperor
returning
to
the
veranda
,
he
stood
still
.
They
were
*NL*
moving
toward
the
door
.
Boris
,
fluttering
as
if
he
had
not
had
time
to
*NL*
withdraw
,
respectfully
pressed
close
to
the
doorpost
with
bowed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
,
with
the
agitation
of
one
who
has
been
personally
*NL*
affronted
,
was
finishing
with
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
enter
Russia
without
declaring
war
!
I
will
not
make
peace
as
long
as
*NL*
a
single
armed
enemy
remains
in
my
country
!
''
It
seemed
to
Boris
that
it
*NL*
gave
the
Emperor
pleasure
to
utter
these
words
.
He
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
form
in
which
he
had
expressed
his
thoughts
,
but
displeased
that
*NL*
Boris
had
overheard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
no
one
know
of
it
!
''
the
Emperor
added
with
a
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
understood
that
this
was
meant
for
him
and
,
closing
his
eyes
,
*NL*
slightly
bowed
his
head
.
The
Emperor
re-entered
the
ballroom
and
*NL*
remained
there
about
another
half-hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
was
thus
the
first
to
learn
the
news
that
the
French
army
had
*NL*
crossed
the
Niemen
and
,
thanks
to
this
,
was
able
to
show
certain
*NL*
important
personages
that
much
that
was
concealed
from
others
was
*NL*
usually
known
to
him
,
and
by
this
means
he
rose
higher
in
their
*NL*
estimation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unexpected
news
of
the
French
having
crossed
the
Niemen
was
*NL*
particularly
startling
after
a
month
of
unfulfilled
expectations
,
and
at
*NL*
a
ball
.
On
first
receiving
the
news
,
under
the
influence
of
indignation
*NL*
and
resentment
the
Emperor
had
found
a
phrase
that
pleased
him
,
fully
*NL*
expressed
his
feelings
,
and
has
since
become
famous
.
On
returning
home
*NL*
at
two
o'clock
that
night
he
sent
for
his
secretary
,
Shishkov
,
and
told
*NL*
him
to
write
an
order
to
the
troops
and
a
rescript
to
Field
Marshal
*NL*
Prince
Saltykov
,
in
which
he
insisted
on
the
words
being
inserted
that
*NL*
he
would
not
make
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
Frenchman
remained
on
*NL*
Russian
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
following
letter
was
sent
to
Napoleon
:
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
mon
frere
,
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
I
learned
that
,
despite
the
loyalty
with
which
I
have
kept
my
*NL*
engagements
with
Your
Majesty
,
your
troops
have
crossed
the
Russian
*NL*
frontier
,
and
I
have
this
moment
received
from
Petersburg
a
note
,
in
*NL*
which
Count
Lauriston
informs
me
,
as
a
reason
for
this
aggression
,
that
*NL*
Your
Majesty
has
considered
yourself
to
be
in
a
state
of
war
with
me
*NL*
from
the
time
Prince
Kuragin
asked
for
his
passports
.
The
reasons
on
*NL*
which
the
Duc
de
Bassano
based
his
refusal
to
deliver
them
to
him
would
*NL*
never
have
led
me
to
suppose
that
that
could
serve
as
a
pretext
for
*NL*
aggression
.
In
fact
,
the
ambassador
,
as
he
himself
has
declared
,
was
*NL*
never
authorized
to
make
that
demand
,
and
as
soon
as
I
was
informed
of
*NL*
it
I
let
him
know
how
much
I
disapproved
of
it
and
ordered
him
to
remain
*NL*
at
his
post
.
If
Your
Majesty
does
not
intend
to
shed
the
blood
of
our
*NL*
peoples
for
such
a
misunderstanding
,
and
consents
to
withdraw
your
*NL*
troops
from
Russian
territory
,
I
will
regard
what
has
passed
as
not
*NL*
having
occurred
and
an
understanding
between
us
will
be
possible
.
In
the
*NL*
contrary
case
,
Your
Majesty
,
I
shall
see
myself
forced
to
repel
an
*NL*
attack
that
nothing
on
my
part
has
provoked
.
It
still
depends
on
Your
*NL*
Majesty
to
preserve
humanity
from
the
calamity
of
another
war
.
I
am
,
*NL*
etc.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
in
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
June
,
the
Emperor
,
having
*NL*
sent
for
Balashev
and
read
him
his
letter
to
Napoleon
,
ordered
him
to
*NL*
take
it
and
hand
it
personally
to
the
French
Emperor
.
When
dispatching
*NL*
Balashev
,
the
Emperor
repeated
to
him
the
words
that
he
would
not
make
*NL*
peace
so
long
as
a
single
armed
enemy
remained
on
Russian
soil
and
told
*NL*
him
to
transmit
those
words
to
Napoleon
.
Alexander
did
not
insert
them
*NL*
in
his
letter
to
Napoleon
,
because
with
his
characteristic
tact
he
felt
*NL*
it
would
be
injudicious
to
use
them
at
a
moment
when
a
last
attempt
at
*NL*
reconciliation
was
being
made
,
but
he
definitely
instructed
Balashev
to
*NL*
repeat
them
personally
to
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
set
off
in
the
small
hours
of
the
fourteenth
,
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
bugler
and
two
Cossacks
,
Balashev
reached
the
French
outposts
at
the
*NL*
village
of
Rykonty
,
on
the
Russian
side
of
the
Niemen
,
by
dawn
.
There
he
*NL*
was
stopped
by
French
cavalry
sentinels
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
French
noncommissioned
officer
of
hussars
,
in
crimson
uniform
and
a
*NL*
shaggy
cap
,
shouted
to
the
approaching
Balashev
to
halt
.
Balashev
did
*NL*
not
do
so
at
once
,
but
continued
to
advance
along
the
road
at
a
walking
*NL*
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noncommissioned
officer
frowned
and
,
muttering
words
of
abuse
,
*NL*
advanced
his
horse
's
chest
against
Balashev
,
put
his
hand
to
his
saber
,
*NL*
and
shouted
rudely
at
the
Russian
general
,
asking
:
was
he
deaf
that
he
*NL*
did
not
do
as
he
was
told
?
Balashev
mentioned
who
he
was
.
The
*NL*
noncommissioned
officer
began
talking
with
his
comrades
about
regimental
*NL*
matters
without
looking
at
the
Russian
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
living
at
the
seat
of
the
highest
authority
and
power
,
after
*NL*
conversing
with
the
Emperor
less
than
three
hours
before
,
and
in
general
*NL*
being
accustomed
to
the
respect
due
to
his
rank
in
the
service
,
Balashev
*NL*
found
it
very
strange
here
on
Russian
soil
to
encounter
this
hostile
,
*NL*
and
still
more
this
disrespectful
,
application
of
brute
force
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
only
just
appearing
from
behind
the
clouds
,
the
air
was
*NL*
fresh
and
dewy
.
A
herd
of
cattle
was
being
driven
along
the
road
from
*NL*
the
village
,
and
over
the
fields
the
larks
rose
trilling
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
like
bubbles
rising
in
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
looked
around
him
,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
an
officer
from
the
*NL*
village
.
The
Russian
Cossacks
and
bugler
and
the
French
hussars
looked
*NL*
silently
at
one
another
from
time
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
French
colonel
of
hussars
,
who
had
evidently
just
left
his
bed
,
came
*NL*
riding
from
the
village
on
a
handsome
sleek
gray
horse
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
two
hussars
.
The
officer
,
the
soldiers
,
and
their
horses
all
looked
*NL*
smart
and
well
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
that
first
period
of
a
campaign
when
troops
are
still
in
full
*NL*
trim
,
almost
like
that
of
peacetime
maneuvers
,
but
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
martial
swagger
in
their
clothes
,
and
a
touch
of
the
gaiety
and
spirit
*NL*
of
enterprise
which
always
accompany
the
opening
of
a
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
colonel
with
difficulty
repressed
a
yawn
,
but
was
polite
and
*NL*
evidently
understood
Balashev
's
importance
.
He
led
him
past
his
soldiers
*NL*
and
behind
the
outposts
and
told
him
that
his
wish
to
be
presented
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
would
most
likely
be
satisfied
immediately
,
as
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
quarters
were
,
he
believed
,
not
far
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
rode
through
the
village
of
Rykonty
,
past
tethered
French
hussar
*NL*
horses
,
past
sentinels
and
men
who
saluted
their
colonel
and
stared
with
*NL*
curiosity
at
a
Russian
uniform
,
and
came
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
village
.
The
colonel
said
that
the
commander
of
the
division
was
a
mile
*NL*
and
a
quarter
away
and
would
receive
Balashev
and
conduct
him
to
his
*NL*
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
by
now
risen
and
shone
gaily
on
the
bright
verdure
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
hardly
ridden
up
a
hill
,
past
a
tavern
,
before
they
saw
a
group
*NL*
of
horsemen
coming
toward
them
.
In
front
of
the
group
,
on
a
black
horse
*NL*
with
trappings
that
glittered
in
the
sun
,
rode
a
tall
man
with
plumes
in
*NL*
his
hat
and
black
hair
curling
down
to
his
shoulders
.
He
wore
a
red
*NL*
mantle
,
and
stretched
his
long
legs
forward
in
French
fashion
.
This
man
*NL*
rode
toward
Balashev
at
a
gallop
,
his
plumes
flowing
and
his
gems
and
*NL*
gold
lace
glittering
in
the
bright
June
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
was
only
two
horses
'
length
from
the
equestrian
with
the
*NL*
bracelets
,
plumes
,
necklaces
,
and
gold
embroidery
,
who
was
galloping
*NL*
toward
him
with
a
theatrically
solemn
countenance
,
when
Julner
,
the
*NL*
French
colonel
,
whispered
respectfully
:
``
The
King
of
Naples
!
''
It
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
Murat
,
now
called
``
King
of
Naples
.
''
Though
it
was
quite
*NL*
incomprehensible
why
he
should
be
King
of
Naples
,
he
was
called
so
,
and
*NL*
was
himself
convinced
that
he
was
so
,
and
therefore
assumed
a
more
*NL*
solemn
and
important
air
than
formerly
.
He
was
so
sure
that
he
really
*NL*
was
the
King
of
Naples
that
when
,
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
that
*NL*
city
,
while
walking
through
the
streets
with
his
wife
,
some
Italians
*NL*
called
out
to
him
:
``
Viva
il
re
!
''
*
he
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
pensive
*NL*
smile
and
said
:
``
Poor
fellows
,
they
do
n't
know
that
I
am
leaving
them
*NL*
tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Long
live
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
he
firmly
believed
himself
to
be
King
of
Naples
and
pitied
*NL*
the
grief
felt
by
the
subjects
he
was
abandoning
,
latterly
,
after
he
had
*NL*
been
ordered
to
return
to
military
service
--
and
especially
since
his
*NL*
last
interview
with
Napoleon
in
Danzig
,
when
his
august
brother-in-law
*NL*
had
told
him
:
``
I
made
you
King
that
you
should
reign
in
my
way
,
but
not
*NL*
in
yours
!
''
--
he
had
cheerfully
taken
up
his
familiar
business
,
and
--
like
*NL*
a
well-fed
but
not
overfat
horse
that
feels
himself
in
harness
and
grows
*NL*
skittish
between
the
shafts
--
he
dressed
up
in
clothes
as
variegated
and
*NL*
expensive
as
possible
,
and
gaily
and
contentedly
galloped
along
the
*NL*
roads
of
Poland
,
without
himself
knowing
why
or
whither
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
the
Russian
general
he
threw
back
his
head
,
with
its
long
hair
*NL*
curling
to
his
shoulders
,
in
a
majestically
royal
manner
,
and
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
the
French
colonel
.
The
colonel
respectfully
informed
His
*NL*
Majesty
of
Balashev
's
mission
,
whose
name
he
could
not
pronounce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Bal-macheve
!
''
said
the
King
-LRB-
overcoming
by
his
assurance
the
*NL*
difficulty
that
had
presented
itself
to
the
colonel
-RRB-
.
``
Charmed
to
make
*NL*
your
acquaintance
,
General
!
''
he
added
,
with
a
gesture
of
kingly
*NL*
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
King
began
to
speak
loud
and
fast
his
royal
dignity
*NL*
instantly
forsook
him
,
and
without
noticing
it
he
passed
into
his
*NL*
natural
tone
of
good-natured
familiarity
.
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
withers
of
Balashev
's
horse
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
General
,
it
all
looks
like
war
,
''
as
if
regretting
a
circumstance
*NL*
of
which
he
was
unable
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Majesty
,
''
replied
Balashev
,
``
my
master
,
the
Emperor
,
does
not
*NL*
desire
war
and
as
Your
Majesty
sees
...
''
said
Balashev
,
using
the
words
*NL*
Your
Majesty
at
every
opportunity
,
with
the
affectation
unavoidable
in
*NL*
frequently
addressing
one
to
whom
the
title
was
still
a
novelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murat
's
face
beamed
with
stupid
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
``
Monsieur
*NL*
de
Bal-macheve
.
''
But
royaute
oblige
!
*
and
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
,
*NL*
as
a
king
and
an
ally
,
to
confer
on
state
affairs
with
Alexander
's
*NL*
envoy
.
He
dismounted
,
took
Balashev
's
arm
,
and
moving
a
few
steps
away
*NL*
from
his
suite
,
which
waited
respectfully
,
began
to
pace
up
and
down
*NL*
with
him
,
trying
to
speak
significantly
.
He
referred
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
Emperor
Napoleon
had
resented
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
his
*NL*
troops
from
Prussia
,
especially
when
that
demand
became
generally
known
*NL*
and
the
dignity
of
France
was
thereby
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Royalty
has
its
obligations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
replied
that
there
was
``
nothing
offensive
in
the
demand
,
*NL*
because
...
''
but
Murat
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
consider
the
Emperor
Alexander
the
aggressor
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
with
a
kindly
and
foolish
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
told
him
why
he
considered
Napoleon
to
be
the
originator
of
the
*NL*
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
general
!
''
Murat
again
interrupted
him
,
``
with
all
my
heart
I
*NL*
wish
the
Emperors
may
arrange
the
affair
between
them
,
and
that
the
war
*NL*
begun
by
no
wish
of
mine
may
finish
as
quickly
as
possible
!
''
said
he
,
in
*NL*
the
tone
of
a
servant
who
wants
to
remain
good
friends
with
another
*NL*
despite
a
quarrel
between
their
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
on
to
inquiries
about
the
Grand
Duke
and
the
state
of
his
*NL*
health
,
and
to
reminiscences
of
the
gay
and
amusing
times
he
had
spent
*NL*
with
him
in
Naples
.
Then
suddenly
,
as
if
remembering
his
royal
dignity
,
*NL*
Murat
solemnly
drew
himself
up
,
assumed
the
pose
in
which
he
had
stood
*NL*
at
his
coronation
,
and
,
waving
his
right
arm
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
detain
you
longer
,
General
.
I
wish
success
to
your
mission
,
''
*NL*
and
with
his
embroidered
red
mantle
,
his
flowing
feathers
,
and
his
*NL*
glittering
ornaments
,
he
rejoined
his
suite
who
were
respectfully
*NL*
awaiting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
rode
on
,
supposing
from
Murat
's
words
that
he
would
very
soon
*NL*
be
brought
before
Napoleon
himself
.
But
instead
of
that
,
at
the
next
*NL*
village
the
sentinels
of
Davout
's
infantry
corps
detained
him
as
the
*NL*
pickets
of
the
vanguard
had
done
,
and
an
adjutant
of
the
corps
*NL*
commander
,
who
was
fetched
,
conducted
him
into
the
village
to
Marshal
*NL*
Davout
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
was
to
Napoleon
what
Arakcheev
was
to
Alexander
--
though
not
a
*NL*
coward
like
Arakcheev
,
he
was
as
precise
,
as
cruel
,
and
as
unable
to
*NL*
express
his
devotion
to
his
monarch
except
by
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
organism
of
states
such
men
are
necessary
,
as
wolves
are
*NL*
necessary
in
the
organism
of
nature
,
and
they
always
exist
,
always
*NL*
appear
and
hold
their
own
,
however
incongruous
their
presence
and
their
*NL*
proximity
to
the
head
of
the
government
may
be
.
This
inevitability
alone
*NL*
can
explain
how
the
cruel
Arakcheev
,
who
tore
out
a
grenadier
's
mustache
*NL*
with
his
own
hands
,
whose
weak
nerves
rendered
him
unable
to
face
*NL*
danger
,
and
who
was
neither
an
educated
man
nor
a
courtier
,
was
able
to
*NL*
maintain
his
powerful
position
with
Alexander
,
whose
own
character
was
*NL*
chivalrous
,
noble
,
and
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
found
Davout
seated
on
a
barrel
in
the
shed
of
a
peasant
's
hut
,
*NL*
writing
--
he
was
auditing
accounts
.
Better
quarters
could
have
been
found
*NL*
him
,
but
Marshal
Davout
was
one
of
those
men
who
purposely
put
*NL*
themselves
in
most
depressing
conditions
to
have
a
justification
for
*NL*
being
gloomy
.
For
the
same
reason
they
are
always
hard
at
work
and
in
a
*NL*
hurry
.
``
How
can
I
think
of
the
bright
side
of
life
when
,
as
you
see
,
I
*NL*
am
sitting
on
a
barrel
and
working
in
a
dirty
shed
?
''
the
expression
of
*NL*
his
face
seemed
to
say
.
The
chief
pleasure
and
necessity
of
such
men
,
*NL*
when
they
encounter
anyone
who
shows
animation
,
is
to
flaunt
their
own
*NL*
dreary
,
persistent
activity
.
Davout
allowed
himself
that
pleasure
when
*NL*
Balashev
was
brought
in
.
He
became
still
more
absorbed
in
his
task
when
*NL*
the
Russian
general
entered
,
and
after
glancing
over
his
spectacles
at
*NL*
Balashev
's
face
,
which
was
animated
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
and
by
*NL*
his
talk
with
Murat
,
he
did
not
rise
or
even
stir
,
but
scowled
still
*NL*
more
and
sneered
malevolently
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
noticed
in
Balashev
's
face
the
disagreeable
impression
this
*NL*
reception
produced
,
Davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
he
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
he
could
have
been
received
in
such
a
manner
only
because
*NL*
Davout
did
not
know
that
he
was
adjutant
general
to
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
and
even
his
envoy
to
Napoleon
,
Balashev
hastened
to
inform
*NL*
him
of
his
rank
and
mission
.
Contrary
to
his
expectation
,
Davout
,
after
*NL*
hearing
him
,
became
still
surlier
and
ruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
your
dispatch
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
Give
it
to
me
.
I
will
send
it
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
replied
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
hand
it
personally
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Emperor
's
orders
are
obeyed
in
your
army
,
but
here
,
''
said
Davout
,
*NL*
``
you
must
do
as
you
're
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
if
to
make
the
Russian
general
still
more
conscious
of
his
*NL*
dependence
on
brute
force
,
Davout
sent
an
adjutant
to
call
the
officer
*NL*
on
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
took
out
the
packet
containing
the
Emperor
's
letter
and
laid
it
*NL*
on
the
table
-LRB-
made
of
a
door
with
its
hinges
still
hanging
on
it
,
laid
*NL*
across
two
barrels
-RRB-
.
Davout
took
the
packet
and
read
the
inscription
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
treat
me
with
respect
or
not
,
''
*NL*
protested
Balashev
,
``
but
permit
me
to
observe
that
I
have
the
honor
to
*NL*
be
adjutant
general
to
His
Majesty
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
glanced
at
him
silently
and
plainly
derived
pleasure
from
the
*NL*
signs
of
agitation
and
confusion
which
appeared
on
Balashev
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
treated
as
is
fitting
,
''
said
he
and
,
putting
the
packet
in
*NL*
his
pocket
,
left
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
the
marshal
's
adjutant
,
de
Castres
,
came
in
and
conducted
*NL*
Balashev
to
the
quarters
assigned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
he
dined
with
the
marshal
,
at
the
same
board
on
the
barrels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Davout
rode
out
early
and
,
after
asking
Balashev
to
come
to
*NL*
him
,
peremptorily
requested
him
to
remain
there
,
to
move
on
with
the
*NL*
baggage
train
should
orders
come
for
it
to
move
,
and
to
talk
to
no
one
*NL*
except
Monsieur
de
Castres
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
four
days
of
solitude
,
ennui
,
and
consciousness
of
his
impotence
*NL*
and
insignificance
--
particularly
acute
by
contrast
with
the
sphere
of
*NL*
power
in
which
he
had
so
lately
moved
--
and
after
several
marches
with
*NL*
the
marshal
's
baggage
and
the
French
army
,
which
occupied
the
whole
*NL*
district
,
Balashev
was
brought
to
Vilna
--
now
occupied
by
the
French
--
*NL*
through
the
very
gate
by
which
he
had
left
it
four
days
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
imperial
gentleman-in-waiting
,
the
Comte
de
Turenne
,
came
*NL*
to
Balashev
and
informed
him
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon
's
wish
to
honor
him
*NL*
with
an
audience

Four
days
before
,
sentinels
of
the
Preobrazhensk
regiment
had
stood
in
*NL*
front
of
the
house
to
which
Balashev
was
conducted
,
and
now
two
French
*NL*
grenadiers
stood
there
in
blue
uniforms
unfastened
in
front
and
with
*NL*
shaggy
caps
on
their
heads
,
and
an
escort
of
hussars
and
uhlans
and
a
*NL*
brilliant
suite
of
aides-de-camp
,
pages
,
and
generals
,
who
were
waiting
*NL*
for
Napoleon
to
come
out
,
were
standing
at
the
porch
,
round
his
saddle
*NL*
horse
and
his
Mameluke
,
Rustan
.
Napoleon
received
Balashev
in
the
very
*NL*
house
in
Vilna
from
which
Alexander
had
dispatched
him
on
his
mission
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Balashev
was
used
to
imperial
pomp
,
he
was
amazed
at
the
luxury
*NL*
and
magnificence
of
Napoleon
's
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Comte
de
Turenne
showed
him
into
a
big
reception
room
where
many
*NL*
generals
,
gentlemen-in-waiting
,
and
Polish
magnates
--
several
of
whom
*NL*
Balashev
had
seen
at
the
court
of
the
Emperor
of
Russia
--
were
waiting
.
*NL*
Duroc
said
that
Napoleon
would
receive
the
Russian
general
before
going
*NL*
for
his
ride
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
minutes
,
the
gentleman-in-waiting
who
was
on
duty
came
into
*NL*
the
great
reception
room
and
,
bowing
politely
,
asked
Balashev
to
follow
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
went
into
a
small
reception
room
,
one
door
of
which
led
into
a
*NL*
study
,
the
very
one
from
which
the
Russian
Emperor
had
dispatched
him
on
*NL*
his
mission
.
He
stood
a
minute
or
two
,
waiting
.
He
heard
hurried
*NL*
footsteps
beyond
the
door
,
both
halves
of
it
were
opened
rapidly
;
all
*NL*
was
silent
and
then
from
the
study
the
sound
was
heard
of
other
steps
,
*NL*
firm
and
resolute
--
they
were
those
of
Napoleon
.
He
had
just
finished
*NL*
dressing
for
his
ride
,
and
wore
a
blue
uniform
,
opening
in
front
over
a
*NL*
white
waistcoat
so
long
that
it
covered
his
rotund
stomach
,
white
*NL*
leather
breeches
tightly
fitting
the
fat
thighs
of
his
short
legs
,
and
*NL*
Hessian
boots
.
His
short
hair
had
evidently
just
been
brushed
,
but
one
*NL*
lock
hung
down
in
the
middle
of
his
broad
forehead
.
His
plump
white
neck
*NL*
stood
out
sharply
above
the
black
collar
of
his
uniform
,
and
he
smelled
*NL*
of
Eau
de
Cologne
.
His
full
face
,
rather
young-looking
,
with
its
*NL*
prominent
chin
,
wore
a
gracious
and
majestic
expression
of
imperial
*NL*
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
briskly
,
with
a
jerk
at
every
step
and
his
head
slightly
*NL*
thrown
back
.
His
whole
short
corpulent
figure
with
broad
thick
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
chest
and
stomach
involuntarily
protruding
,
had
that
*NL*
imposing
and
stately
appearance
one
sees
in
men
of
forty
who
live
in
*NL*
comfort
.
It
was
evident
,
too
,
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
in
answer
to
Balashav
's
low
and
respectful
bow
,
and
coming
up
*NL*
to
him
at
once
began
speaking
like
a
man
who
values
every
moment
of
his
*NL*
time
and
does
not
condescend
to
prepare
what
he
has
to
say
but
is
sure
*NL*
he
will
always
say
the
right
thing
and
say
it
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
General
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
received
the
letter
you
brought
*NL*
from
the
Emperor
Alexander
and
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
He
glanced
with
*NL*
his
large
eyes
into
Balashav
's
face
and
immediately
looked
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
Balashev
's
personality
did
not
interest
him
at
all
.
*NL*
Evidently
only
what
took
place
within
his
own
mind
interested
him
.
*NL*
Nothing
outside
himself
had
any
significance
for
him
,
because
everything
*NL*
in
the
world
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
depended
entirely
on
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
,
and
did
not
,
desire
war
,
''
he
continued
,
``
but
it
has
been
*NL*
forced
on
me
.
Even
now
''
-LRB-
he
emphasized
the
word
-RRB-
``
I
am
ready
to
receive
*NL*
any
explanations
you
can
give
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
clearly
and
concisely
to
explain
his
reasons
for
*NL*
dissatisfaction
with
the
Russian
government
.
Judging
by
the
calmly
*NL*
moderate
and
amicable
tone
in
which
the
French
Emperor
spoke
,
Balashev
*NL*
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
wished
for
peace
and
intended
to
enter
into
*NL*
negotiations
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Napoleon
,
having
finished
speaking
,
looked
inquiringly
at
the
*NL*
Russian
envoy
,
Balashev
began
a
speech
he
had
prepared
long
before
:
*NL*
``
Sire
!
The
Emperor
,
my
master
...
''
but
the
sight
of
the
Emperor
's
eyes
*NL*
bent
on
him
confused
him
.
``
You
are
flurried
--
compose
yourself
!
''
Napoleon
*NL*
seemed
to
say
,
as
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
he
looked
at
*NL*
Balashev
's
uniform
and
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
recovered
himself
and
began
to
speak
.
He
said
that
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
did
not
consider
Kurakin
's
demand
for
his
passports
a
*NL*
sufficient
cause
for
war
;
that
Kurakin
had
acted
on
his
own
initiative
*NL*
and
without
his
sovereign
's
assent
,
that
the
Emperor
Alexander
did
not
*NL*
desire
war
,
and
had
no
relations
with
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
!
''
interposed
Napoleon
,
and
,
as
if
fearing
to
give
vent
to
his
*NL*
feelings
,
he
frowned
and
nodded
slightly
as
a
sign
that
Balashev
might
*NL*
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
saying
all
he
had
been
instructed
to
say
,
Balashev
added
that
the
*NL*
Emperor
Alexander
wished
for
peace
,
but
would
not
enter
into
*NL*
negotiations
except
on
condition
that
...
Here
Balashev
hesitated
:
he
*NL*
remembered
the
words
the
Emperor
Alexander
had
not
written
in
his
*NL*
letter
,
but
had
specially
inserted
in
the
rescript
to
Saltykov
and
had
*NL*
told
Balashev
to
repeat
to
Napoleon
.
Balashev
remembered
these
words
,
*NL*
``
So
long
as
a
single
armed
foe
remains
on
Russian
soil
,
''
but
some
*NL*
complex
feeling
restrained
him
.
He
could
not
utter
them
,
though
he
*NL*
wished
to
do
so
.
He
grew
confused
and
said
:
``
On
condition
that
the
*NL*
French
army
retires
beyond
the
Niemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
noticed
Balashev
's
embarrassment
when
uttering
these
last
*NL*
words
;
his
face
twitched
and
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
began
to
quiver
*NL*
rhythmically
.
Without
moving
from
where
he
stood
he
began
speaking
in
a
*NL*
louder
tone
and
more
hurriedly
than
before
.
During
the
speech
that
*NL*
followed
,
Balashev
,
who
more
than
once
lowered
his
eyes
,
involuntarily
*NL*
noticed
the
quivering
of
Napoleon
's
left
leg
which
increased
the
more
*NL*
Napoleon
raised
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
desire
peace
,
no
less
than
the
Emperor
Alexander
,
''
he
began
.
``
Have
I
*NL*
not
for
eighteen
months
been
doing
everything
to
obtain
it
?
I
have
*NL*
waited
eighteen
months
for
explanations
.
But
in
order
to
begin
*NL*
negotiations
,
what
is
demanded
of
me
?
''
he
said
,
frowning
and
making
an
*NL*
energetic
gesture
of
inquiry
with
his
small
white
plump
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
withdrawal
of
your
army
beyond
the
Niemen
,
sire
,
''
replied
Balashev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Niemen
?
''
repeated
Napoleon
.
``
So
now
you
want
me
to
retire
beyond
*NL*
the
Niemen
--
only
the
Niemen
?
''
repeated
Napoleon
,
looking
straight
at
*NL*
Balashev
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
bowed
his
head
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
the
demand
of
four
months
earlier
to
withdraw
from
Pomerania
,
*NL*
only
a
withdrawal
beyond
the
Niemen
was
now
demanded
.
Napoleon
turned
*NL*
quickly
and
began
to
pace
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
the
demand
now
is
that
I
am
to
withdraw
beyond
the
Niemen
*NL*
before
commencing
negotiations
,
but
in
just
the
same
way
two
months
ago
*NL*
the
demand
was
that
I
should
withdraw
beyond
the
Vistula
and
the
Oder
,
*NL*
and
yet
you
are
willing
to
negotiate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
in
silence
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
again
*NL*
stopped
in
front
of
Balashev
.
Balashev
noticed
that
his
left
leg
was
*NL*
quivering
faster
than
before
and
his
face
seemed
petrified
in
its
stern
*NL*
expression
.
This
quivering
of
his
left
leg
was
a
thing
Napoleon
was
*NL*
conscious
of
.
``
The
vibration
of
my
left
calf
is
a
great
sign
with
me
,
''
*NL*
he
remarked
at
a
later
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
demands
as
to
retreat
beyond
the
Vistula
and
Oder
may
be
made
to
a
*NL*
Prince
of
Baden
,
but
not
to
me
!
''
Napoleon
almost
screamed
,
quite
to
his
*NL*
own
surprise
.
``
If
you
gave
me
Petersburg
and
Moscow
I
could
not
accept
*NL*
such
conditions
.
You
say
I
have
begun
this
war
!
But
who
first
joined
his
*NL*
army
?
The
Emperor
Alexander
,
not
I
!
And
you
offer
me
negotiations
when
I
*NL*
have
expended
millions
,
when
you
are
in
alliance
with
England
,
and
when
*NL*
your
position
is
a
bad
one
.
You
offer
me
negotiations
!
But
what
is
the
*NL*
aim
of
your
alliance
with
England
?
What
has
she
given
you
?
''
he
continued
*NL*
hurriedly
,
evidently
no
longer
trying
to
show
the
advantages
of
peace
*NL*
and
discuss
its
possibility
,
but
only
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
*NL*
power
and
Alexander
's
errors
and
duplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commencement
of
his
speech
had
obviously
been
made
with
the
*NL*
intention
of
demonstrating
the
advantages
of
his
position
and
showing
*NL*
that
he
was
nevertheless
willing
to
negotiate
.
But
he
had
begun
talking
,
*NL*
and
the
more
he
talked
the
less
could
he
control
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
purport
of
his
remarks
now
was
evidently
to
exalt
himself
and
*NL*
insult
Alexander
--
just
what
he
had
least
desired
at
the
commencement
of
*NL*
the
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
you
have
made
peace
with
Turkey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
bowed
his
head
affirmatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
has
been
concluded
...
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Napoleon
did
not
let
him
speak
.
He
evidently
wanted
to
do
all
the
*NL*
talking
himself
,
and
continued
to
talk
with
the
sort
of
eloquence
and
*NL*
unrestrained
irritability
to
which
spoiled
people
are
so
prone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
you
have
made
peace
with
the
Turks
without
obtaining
*NL*
Moldavia
and
Wallachia
;
I
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
*NL*
provinces
as
I
gave
him
Finland
.
Yes
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
I
promised
and
would
*NL*
have
given
the
Emperor
Alexander
Moldavia
and
Wallachia
,
and
now
he
*NL*
wo
n't
have
those
splendid
provinces
.
Yet
he
might
have
united
them
to
*NL*
his
empire
and
in
a
single
reign
would
have
extended
Russia
from
the
*NL*
Gulf
of
Bothnia
to
the
mouths
of
the
Danube
.
Catherine
the
Great
could
*NL*
not
have
done
more
,
''
said
Napoleon
,
growing
more
and
more
excited
as
he
*NL*
paced
up
and
down
the
room
,
repeating
to
Balashev
almost
the
very
words
*NL*
he
had
used
to
Alexander
himself
at
Tilsit
.
``
All
that
,
he
would
have
*NL*
owed
to
my
friendship
.
Oh
,
what
a
splendid
reign
!
''
he
repeated
several
*NL*
times
,
then
paused
,
drew
from
his
pocket
a
gold
snuffbox
,
lifted
it
to
*NL*
his
nose
,
and
greedily
sniffed
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
splendid
reign
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
might
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
compassionately
at
Balashev
,
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
tried
*NL*
to
make
some
rejoinder
hastily
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
could
he
wish
or
look
for
that
he
would
not
have
obtained
through
*NL*
my
friendship
?
''
demanded
Napoleon
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
*NL*
perplexity
.
``
But
no
,
he
has
preferred
to
surround
himself
with
my
*NL*
enemies
,
and
with
whom
?
With
Steins
,
Armfeldts
,
Bennigsens
,
and
*NL*
Wintzingerodes
!
Stein
,
a
traitor
expelled
from
his
own
country
;
*NL*
Armfeldt
,
a
rake
and
an
intriguer
;
Wintzingerode
,
a
fugitive
French
*NL*
subject
;
Bennigsen
,
rather
more
of
a
soldier
than
the
others
,
but
all
*NL*
the
same
an
incompetent
who
was
unable
to
do
anything
in
1807
and
who
*NL*
should
awaken
terrible
memories
in
the
Emperor
Alexander
's
mind
...
*NL*
Granted
that
were
they
competent
they
might
be
made
use
of
,
''
continued
*NL*
Napoleon
--
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
in
words
with
the
rush
of
thoughts
*NL*
that
incessantly
sprang
up
,
proving
how
right
and
strong
he
was
-LRB-
in
his
*NL*
perception
the
two
were
one
and
the
same
-RRB-
--
``
but
they
are
not
even
that
!
*NL*
They
are
neither
fit
for
war
nor
peace
!
Barclay
is
said
to
be
the
most
*NL*
capable
of
them
all
,
but
I
can
not
say
so
,
judging
by
his
first
*NL*
movements
.
And
what
are
they
doing
,
all
these
courtiers
?
Pfuel
proposes
,
*NL*
Armfeldt
disputes
,
Bennigsen
considers
,
and
Barclay
,
called
on
to
act
,
*NL*
does
not
know
what
to
decide
on
,
and
time
passes
bringing
no
result
.
*NL*
Bagration
alone
is
a
military
man
.
He
's
stupid
,
but
he
has
experience
,
a
*NL*
quick
eye
,
and
resolution
...
And
what
role
is
your
young
monarch
*NL*
playing
in
that
monstrous
crowd
?
They
compromise
him
and
throw
on
him
*NL*
the
responsibility
for
all
that
happens
.
A
sovereign
should
not
be
with
*NL*
the
army
unless
he
is
a
general
!
''
said
Napoleon
,
evidently
uttering
*NL*
these
words
as
a
direct
challenge
to
the
Emperor
.
He
knew
how
Alexander
*NL*
desired
to
be
a
military
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
campaign
began
only
a
week
ago
,
and
you
have
n't
even
been
able
to
*NL*
defend
Vilna
.
You
are
cut
in
two
and
have
been
driven
out
of
the
Polish
*NL*
provinces
.
Your
army
is
grumbling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
Your
Majesty
,
''
said
Balashev
,
hardly
able
to
remember
*NL*
what
had
been
said
to
him
and
following
these
verbal
fireworks
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
``
the
troops
are
burning
with
eagerness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
everything
!
''
Napoleon
interrupted
him
.
``
I
know
everything
.
I
*NL*
know
the
number
of
your
battalions
as
exactly
as
I
know
my
own
.
You
have
*NL*
not
two
hundred
thousand
men
,
and
I
have
three
times
that
number
.
I
give
*NL*
you
my
word
of
honor
,
''
said
Napoleon
,
forgetting
that
his
word
of
honor
*NL*
could
carry
no
weight
--
``
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
I
have
five
*NL*
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
this
side
of
the
Vistula
.
The
Turks
will
*NL*
be
of
no
use
to
you
;
they
are
worth
nothing
and
have
shown
it
by
making
*NL*
peace
with
you
.
As
for
the
Swedes
--
it
is
their
fate
to
be
governed
by
*NL*
mad
kings
.
Their
king
was
insane
and
they
changed
him
for
another
--
*NL*
Bernadotte
,
who
promptly
went
mad
--
for
no
Swede
would
ally
himself
with
*NL*
Russia
unless
he
were
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
grinned
maliciously
and
again
raised
his
snuffbox
to
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
knew
how
to
reply
to
each
of
Napoleon
's
remarks
,
and
would
have
*NL*
done
so
;
he
continually
made
the
gesture
of
a
man
wishing
to
say
*NL*
something
,
but
Napoleon
always
interrupted
him
.
To
the
alleged
insanity
*NL*
of
the
Swedes
,
Balashev
wished
to
reply
that
when
Russia
is
on
her
side
*NL*
Sweden
is
practically
an
island
:
but
Napoleon
gave
an
angry
exclamation
*NL*
to
drown
his
voice
.
Napoleon
was
in
that
state
of
irritability
in
which
*NL*
a
man
has
to
talk
,
talk
,
and
talk
,
merely
to
convince
himself
that
he
is
*NL*
in
the
right
.
Balashev
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
:
as
envoy
he
feared
*NL*
to
demean
his
dignity
and
felt
the
necessity
of
replying
;
but
,
as
a
man
,
*NL*
he
shrank
before
the
transport
of
groundless
wrath
that
had
evidently
*NL*
seized
Napoleon
.
He
knew
that
none
of
the
words
now
uttered
by
Napoleon
*NL*
had
any
significance
,
and
that
Napoleon
himself
would
be
ashamed
of
them
*NL*
when
he
came
to
his
senses
.
Balashev
stood
with
downcast
eyes
,
looking
*NL*
at
the
movements
of
Napoleon
's
stout
legs
and
trying
to
avoid
meeting
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
I
care
about
your
allies
?
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
I
have
allies
--
*NL*
the
Poles
.
There
are
eighty
thousand
of
them
and
they
fight
like
lions
.
*NL*
And
there
will
be
two
hundred
thousand
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
probably
still
more
perturbed
by
the
fact
that
he
had
uttered
this
*NL*
obvious
falsehood
,
and
that
Balashev
still
stood
silently
before
him
in
*NL*
the
same
attitude
of
submission
to
fate
,
Napoleon
abruptly
turned
round
,
*NL*
drew
close
to
Balashev
's
face
,
and
,
gesticulating
rapidly
and
*NL*
energetically
with
his
white
hands
,
almost
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
that
if
you
stir
up
Prussia
against
me
,
I
'll
wipe
it
off
the
map
*NL*
of
Europe
!
''
he
declared
,
his
face
pale
and
distorted
by
anger
,
and
he
*NL*
struck
one
of
his
small
hands
energetically
with
the
other
.
``
Yes
,
I
will
*NL*
throw
you
back
beyond
the
Dvina
and
beyond
the
Dnieper
,
and
will
re
-
*NL*
erect
against
you
that
barrier
which
it
was
criminal
and
blind
of
Europe
*NL*
to
allow
to
be
destroyed
.
Yes
,
that
is
what
will
happen
to
you
.
That
is
*NL*
what
you
have
gained
by
alienating
me
!
''
And
he
walked
silently
several
*NL*
times
up
and
down
the
room
,
his
fat
shoulders
twitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
snuffbox
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
took
it
out
again
,
lifted
*NL*
it
several
times
to
his
nose
,
and
stopped
in
front
of
Balashev
.
He
*NL*
paused
,
looked
ironically
straight
into
Balashev
's
eyes
,
and
said
in
a
*NL*
quiet
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
what
a
splendid
reign
your
master
might
have
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
him
to
reply
,
said
that
from
the
*NL*
Russian
side
things
did
not
appear
in
so
gloomy
a
light
.
Napoleon
was
*NL*
silent
,
still
looking
derisively
at
him
and
evidently
not
listening
to
*NL*
him
.
Balashev
said
that
in
Russia
the
best
results
were
expected
from
*NL*
the
war
.
Napoleon
nodded
condescendingly
,
as
if
to
say
,
``
I
know
it
's
*NL*
your
duty
to
say
that
,
but
you
do
n't
believe
it
yourself
.
I
have
*NL*
convinced
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Balashev
had
ended
,
Napoleon
again
took
out
his
snuffbox
,
sniffed
*NL*
at
it
,
and
stamped
his
foot
twice
on
the
floor
as
a
signal
.
The
door
*NL*
opened
,
a
gentleman-in-waiting
,
bending
respectfully
,
handed
the
Emperor
*NL*
his
hat
and
gloves
;
another
brought
him
a
pocket
handkerchief
.
Napoleon
,
*NL*
without
giving
them
a
glance
,
turned
to
Balashev
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Assure
the
Emperor
Alexander
from
me
,
''
said
he
,
taking
his
hat
,
``
that
I
*NL*
am
as
devoted
to
him
as
before
:
I
know
him
thoroughly
and
very
highly
*NL*
esteem
his
lofty
qualities
.
I
will
detain
you
no
longer
,
General
;
you
*NL*
shall
receive
my
letter
to
the
Emperor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Napoleon
went
quickly
to
the
door
.
Everyone
in
the
reception
room
*NL*
rushed
forward
and
descended
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
that
Napoleon
had
said
to
him
--
those
bursts
of
anger
and
the
*NL*
last
dryly
spoken
words
:
``
I
will
detain
you
no
longer
,
General
;
you
*NL*
shall
receive
my
letter
,
''
Balashev
felt
convinced
that
Napoleon
would
*NL*
not
wish
to
see
him
,
and
would
even
avoid
another
meeting
with
him
--
an
*NL*
insulted
envoy
--
especially
as
he
had
witnessed
his
unseemly
anger
.
But
,
*NL*
to
his
surprise
,
Balashev
received
,
through
Duroc
,
an
invitation
to
dine
*NL*
with
the
Emperor
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessieres
,
Caulaincourt
,
and
Berthier
were
present
at
that
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
met
Balashev
cheerfully
and
amiably
.
He
not
only
showed
no
sign
*NL*
of
constraint
or
self-reproach
on
account
of
his
outburst
that
morning
,
*NL*
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
tried
to
reassure
Balashev
.
It
was
evident
that
he
*NL*
had
long
been
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
*NL*
mistake
,
and
that
in
his
perception
whatever
he
did
was
right
,
not
*NL*
because
it
harmonized
with
any
idea
of
right
and
wrong
,
but
because
he
*NL*
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
was
in
very
good
spirits
after
his
ride
through
Vilna
,
where
*NL*
crowds
of
people
had
rapturously
greeted
and
followed
him
.
From
all
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
streets
through
which
he
rode
,
rugs
,
flags
,
and
his
*NL*
monogram
were
displayed
,
and
the
Polish
ladies
,
welcoming
him
,
waved
*NL*
their
handkerchiefs
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
,
having
placed
Balashev
beside
him
,
Napoleon
not
only
treated
*NL*
him
amiably
but
behaved
as
if
Balashev
were
one
of
his
own
courtiers
,
*NL*
one
of
those
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
ought
to
rejoice
at
his
*NL*
success
.
In
the
course
of
conversation
he
mentioned
Moscow
and
*NL*
questioned
Balashev
about
the
Russian
capital
,
not
merely
as
an
*NL*
interested
traveler
asks
about
a
new
city
he
intends
to
visit
,
but
as
if
*NL*
convinced
that
Balashev
,
as
a
Russian
,
must
be
flattered
by
his
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
inhabitants
are
there
in
Moscow
?
How
many
houses
?
Is
it
true
*NL*
that
Moscow
is
called
`
Holy
Moscow
'
?
How
many
churches
are
there
in
*NL*
Moscow
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
receiving
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
churches
,
*NL*
he
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
such
a
quantity
of
churches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Russians
are
very
devout
,
''
replied
Balashev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
large
number
of
monasteries
and
churches
is
always
a
sign
of
the
*NL*
backwardness
of
a
people
,
''
said
Napoleon
,
turning
to
Caulaincourt
for
*NL*
appreciation
of
this
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
respectfully
ventured
to
disagree
with
the
French
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
country
has
its
own
character
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
nowhere
in
Europe
is
there
anything
like
that
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
Majesty
's
pardon
,
''
returned
Balashev
,
``
besides
Russia
there
*NL*
is
Spain
,
where
there
are
also
many
churches
and
monasteries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reply
of
Balashev
's
,
which
hinted
at
the
recent
defeats
of
the
*NL*
French
in
Spain
,
was
much
appreciated
when
he
related
it
at
Alexander
's
*NL*
court
,
but
it
was
not
much
appreciated
at
Napoleon
's
dinner
,
where
it
*NL*
passed
unnoticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
uninterested
and
perplexed
faces
of
the
marshals
showed
that
they
*NL*
were
puzzled
as
to
what
Balashev
's
tone
suggested
.
``
If
there
is
a
point
*NL*
we
do
n't
see
it
,
or
it
is
not
at
all
witty
,
''
their
expressions
seemed
to
*NL*
say
.
So
little
was
his
rejoinder
appreciated
that
Napoleon
did
not
*NL*
notice
it
at
all
and
naively
asked
Balashev
through
what
towns
the
*NL*
direct
road
from
there
to
Moscow
passed
.
Balashev
,
who
was
on
the
alert
*NL*
all
through
the
dinner
,
replied
that
just
as
``
all
roads
lead
to
Rome
,
''
*NL*
so
all
roads
lead
to
Moscow
:
there
were
many
roads
,
and
``
among
them
the
*NL*
road
through
Poltava
,
which
Charles
XII
chose
.
''
Balashev
involuntarily
*NL*
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
aptitude
of
this
reply
,
but
hardly
had
he
*NL*
uttered
the
word
Poltava
before
Caulaincourt
began
speaking
of
the
*NL*
badness
of
the
road
from
Petersburg
to
Moscow
and
of
his
Petersburg
*NL*
reminiscences
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
they
went
to
drink
coffee
in
Napoleon
's
study
,
which
four
*NL*
days
previously
had
been
that
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
.
Napoleon
sat
*NL*
down
,
toying
with
his
Sevres
coffee
cup
,
and
motioned
Balashev
to
a
*NL*
chair
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
was
in
that
well-known
after-dinner
mood
which
,
more
than
any
*NL*
reasoned
cause
,
makes
a
man
contented
with
himself
and
disposed
to
*NL*
consider
everyone
his
friend
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
*NL*
men
who
adored
him
:
and
he
felt
convinced
that
,
after
his
dinner
,
*NL*
Balashev
too
was
his
friend
and
worshiper
.
Napoleon
turned
to
him
with
a
*NL*
pleasant
,
though
slightly
ironic
,
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
tell
me
this
is
the
room
the
Emperor
Alexander
occupied
?
Strange
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
,
General
?
''
he
said
,
evidently
not
doubting
that
this
remark
*NL*
would
be
agreeable
to
his
hearer
since
it
went
to
prove
his
,
Napoleon
's
,
*NL*
superiority
to
Alexander
.
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
made
no
reply
and
bowed
his
head
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Four
days
ago
in
this
room
,
Wintzingerode
and
Stein
were
*NL*
deliberating
,
''
continued
Napoleon
with
the
same
derisive
and
self
-
*NL*
confident
smile
.
``
What
I
ca
n't
understand
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
is
that
the
*NL*
Emperor
Alexander
has
surrounded
himself
with
my
personal
enemies
.
That
*NL*
I
do
not
...
understand
.
Has
he
not
thought
that
I
may
do
the
same
?
''
and
*NL*
he
turned
inquiringly
to
Balashev
,
and
evidently
this
thought
turned
him
*NL*
back
on
to
the
track
of
his
morning
's
anger
,
which
was
still
fresh
in
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
let
him
know
that
I
will
do
so
!
''
said
Napoleon
,
rising
and
pushing
*NL*
his
cup
away
with
his
hand
.
``
I
'll
drive
all
his
Wurttemberg
,
Baden
,
and
*NL*
Weimar
relations
out
of
Germany
...
Yes
.
I
'll
drive
them
out
.
Let
him
*NL*
prepare
an
asylum
for
them
in
Russia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Balashev
bowed
his
head
with
an
air
indicating
that
he
would
like
to
*NL*
make
his
bow
and
leave
,
and
only
listened
because
he
could
not
help
*NL*
hearing
what
was
said
to
him
.
Napoleon
did
not
notice
this
expression
;
*NL*
he
treated
Balashev
not
as
an
envoy
from
his
enemy
,
but
as
a
man
now
*NL*
fully
devoted
to
him
and
who
must
rejoice
at
his
former
master
's
*NL*
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
has
the
Emperor
Alexander
taken
command
of
the
armies
?
What
is
*NL*
the
good
of
that
?
War
is
my
profession
,
but
his
business
is
to
reign
and
*NL*
not
to
command
armies
!
Why
has
he
taken
on
himself
such
a
*NL*
responsibility
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Napoleon
brought
out
his
snuffbox
,
paced
several
times
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
in
silence
,
and
then
,
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
,
went
up
to
*NL*
Balashev
and
with
a
slight
smile
,
as
confidently
,
quickly
,
and
simply
as
*NL*
if
he
were
doing
something
not
merely
important
but
pleasing
to
*NL*
Balashev
,
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
forty-year-old
Russian
general
's
*NL*
face
and
,
taking
him
by
the
ear
,
pulled
it
gently
,
smiling
with
his
lips
*NL*
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
one
's
ear
pulled
by
the
Emperor
was
considered
the
greatest
*NL*
honor
and
mark
of
favor
at
the
French
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
adorer
and
courtier
of
the
Emperor
Alexander
,
why
do
n't
you
say
*NL*
anything
?
''
said
he
,
as
if
it
was
ridiculous
,
in
his
presence
,
to
be
the
*NL*
adorer
and
courtier
of
anyone
but
himself
,
Napoleon
.
``
Are
the
horses
*NL*
ready
for
the
general
?
''
he
added
,
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
*NL*
in
reply
to
Balashev
's
bow

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
interview
with
Pierre
in
Moscow
,
Prince
Andrew
went
to
*NL*
Petersburg
,
on
business
as
he
told
his
family
,
but
really
to
meet
*NL*
Anatole
Kuragin
whom
he
felt
it
necessary
to
encounter
.
On
reaching
*NL*
Petersburg
he
inquired
for
Kuragin
but
the
latter
had
already
left
the
*NL*
city
.
Pierre
had
warned
his
brother-in-law
that
Prince
Andrew
was
on
his
*NL*
track
.
Anatole
Kuragin
promptly
obtained
an
appointment
from
the
*NL*
Minister
of
War
and
went
to
join
the
army
in
Moldavia
.
While
in
*NL*
Petersburg
Prince
Andrew
met
Kutuzov
,
his
former
commander
who
was
*NL*
always
well
disposed
toward
him
,
and
Kutuzov
suggested
that
he
should
*NL*
accompany
him
to
the
army
in
Moldavia
,
to
which
the
old
general
had
been
*NL*
appointed
commander-in-chief
.
So
Prince
Andrew
,
having
received
an
*NL*
appointment
on
the
headquarters
staff
,
left
for
Turkey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
did
not
think
it
proper
to
write
and
challenge
Kuragin
.
He
*NL*
thought
that
if
he
challenged
him
without
some
fresh
cause
it
might
*NL*
compromise
the
young
Countess
Rostova
and
so
he
wanted
to
meet
Kuragin
*NL*
personally
in
order
to
find
a
fresh
pretext
for
a
duel
.
But
he
again
*NL*
failed
to
meet
Kuragin
in
Turkey
,
for
soon
after
Prince
Andrew
arrived
,
*NL*
the
latter
returned
to
Russia
.
In
a
new
country
,
amid
new
conditions
,
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
found
life
easier
to
bear
.
After
his
betrothed
had
broken
*NL*
faith
with
him
--
which
he
felt
the
more
acutely
the
more
he
tried
to
*NL*
conceal
its
effects
--
the
surroundings
in
which
he
had
been
happy
became
*NL*
trying
to
him
,
and
the
freedom
and
independence
he
had
once
prized
so
*NL*
highly
were
still
more
so
.
Not
only
could
he
no
longer
think
the
*NL*
thoughts
that
had
first
come
to
him
as
he
lay
gazing
at
the
sky
on
the
*NL*
field
of
Austerlitz
and
had
later
enlarged
upon
with
Pierre
,
and
which
*NL*
had
filled
his
solitude
at
Bogucharovo
and
then
in
Switzerland
and
Rome
,
*NL*
but
he
even
dreaded
to
recall
them
and
the
bright
and
boundless
horizons
*NL*
they
had
revealed
.
He
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
nearest
practical
*NL*
matters
unrelated
to
his
past
interests
,
and
he
seized
on
these
the
more
*NL*
eagerly
the
more
those
past
interests
were
closed
to
him
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
that
lofty
,
infinite
canopy
of
heaven
that
had
once
towered
above
him
*NL*
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
low
,
solid
vault
that
weighed
him
down
,
in
*NL*
which
all
was
clear
,
but
nothing
eternal
or
mysterious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
to
him
,
army
service
was
the
*NL*
simplest
and
most
familiar
.
As
a
general
on
duty
on
Kutuzov
's
staff
,
he
*NL*
applied
himself
to
business
with
zeal
and
perseverance
and
surprised
*NL*
Kutuzov
by
his
willingness
and
accuracy
in
work
.
Not
having
found
*NL*
Kuragin
in
Turkey
,
Prince
Andrew
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
rush
back
*NL*
to
Russia
after
him
,
but
all
the
same
he
knew
that
however
long
it
might
*NL*
be
before
he
met
Kuragin
,
despite
his
contempt
for
him
and
despite
all
*NL*
the
proofs
he
deduced
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
not
worth
stooping
*NL*
to
a
conflict
with
him
--
he
knew
that
when
he
did
meet
him
he
would
not
*NL*
be
able
to
resist
calling
him
out
,
any
more
than
a
ravenous
man
can
help
*NL*
snatching
at
food
.
And
the
consciousness
that
the
insult
was
not
yet
*NL*
avenged
,
that
his
rancor
was
still
unspent
,
weighed
on
his
heart
and
*NL*
poisoned
the
artificial
tranquillity
which
he
managed
to
obtain
in
*NL*
Turkey
by
means
of
restless
,
plodding
,
and
rather
vainglorious
and
*NL*
ambitious
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
year
1812
,
when
news
of
the
war
with
Napoleon
reached
Bucharest
--
*NL*
where
Kutuzov
had
been
living
for
two
months
,
passing
his
days
and
*NL*
nights
with
a
Wallachian
woman
--
Prince
Andrew
asked
Kutuzov
to
transfer
*NL*
him
to
the
Western
Army
.
Kutuzov
,
who
was
already
weary
of
Bolkonski
's
*NL*
activity
which
seemed
to
reproach
his
own
idleness
,
very
readily
let
him
*NL*
go
and
gave
him
a
mission
to
Barclay
de
Tolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
joining
the
Western
Army
which
was
then
,
in
May
,
encamped
at
*NL*
Drissa
,
Prince
Andrew
visited
Bald
Hills
which
was
directly
on
his
way
,
*NL*
being
only
two
miles
off
the
Smolensk
highroad
.
During
the
last
three
*NL*
years
there
had
been
so
many
changes
in
his
life
,
he
had
thought
,
felt
,
*NL*
and
seen
so
much
-LRB-
having
traveled
both
in
the
east
and
the
west
-RRB-
,
that
*NL*
on
reaching
Bald
Hills
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
unexpected
to
find
*NL*
the
way
of
life
there
unchanged
and
still
the
same
in
every
detail
.
He
*NL*
entered
through
the
gates
with
their
stone
pillars
and
drove
up
the
*NL*
avenue
leading
to
the
house
as
if
he
were
entering
an
enchanted
,
*NL*
sleeping
castle
.
The
same
old
stateliness
,
the
same
cleanliness
,
the
*NL*
same
stillness
reigned
there
,
and
inside
there
was
the
same
furniture
,
*NL*
the
same
walls
,
sounds
,
and
smell
,
and
the
same
timid
faces
,
only
*NL*
somewhat
older
.
Princess
Mary
was
still
the
same
timid
,
plain
maiden
*NL*
getting
on
in
years
,
uselessly
and
joylessly
passing
the
best
years
of
*NL*
her
life
in
fear
and
constant
suffering
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
the
*NL*
same
coquettish
,
self-satisfied
girl
,
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
*NL*
existence
and
full
of
joyous
hopes
for
the
future
.
She
had
merely
become
*NL*
more
self-confident
,
Prince
Andrew
thought
.
Dessalles
,
the
tutor
he
had
*NL*
brought
from
Switzerland
,
was
wearing
a
coat
of
Russian
cut
and
talking
*NL*
broken
Russian
to
the
servants
,
but
was
still
the
same
narrowly
*NL*
intelligent
,
conscientious
,
and
pedantic
preceptor
.
The
old
prince
had
*NL*
changed
in
appearance
only
by
the
loss
of
a
tooth
,
which
left
a
*NL*
noticeable
gap
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
;
in
character
he
was
the
same
as
*NL*
ever
,
only
showing
still
more
irritability
and
skepticism
as
to
what
was
*NL*
happening
in
the
world
.
Little
Nicholas
alone
had
changed
.
He
had
grown
,
*NL*
become
rosier
,
had
curly
dark
hair
,
and
,
when
merry
and
laughing
,
quite
*NL*
unconsciously
lifted
the
upper
lip
of
his
pretty
little
mouth
just
as
*NL*
the
little
princess
used
to
do
.
He
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
of
*NL*
immutability
in
the
enchanted
,
sleeping
castle
.
But
though
externally
*NL*
all
remained
as
of
old
,
the
inner
relations
of
all
these
people
had
*NL*
changed
since
Prince
Andrew
had
seen
them
last
.
The
household
was
*NL*
divided
into
two
alien
and
hostile
camps
,
who
changed
their
habits
for
*NL*
his
sake
and
only
met
because
he
was
there
.
To
the
one
camp
belonged
the
*NL*
old
prince
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
and
the
architect
;
to
the
other
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
Dessalles
,
little
Nicholas
,
and
all
the
old
nurses
and
*NL*
maids
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
stay
at
Bald
Hills
all
the
family
dined
together
,
but
they
*NL*
were
ill
at
ease
and
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
he
was
a
visitor
for
whose
*NL*
sake
an
exception
was
being
made
and
that
his
presence
made
them
all
*NL*
feel
awkward
.
Involuntarily
feeling
this
at
dinner
on
the
first
day
,
he
*NL*
was
taciturn
,
and
the
old
prince
noticing
this
also
became
morosely
dumb
*NL*
and
retired
to
his
apartments
directly
after
dinner
.
In
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
Prince
Andrew
went
to
him
and
,
trying
to
rouse
him
,
began
to
tell
*NL*
him
of
the
young
Count
Kamensky
's
campaign
,
the
old
prince
began
*NL*
unexpectedly
to
talk
about
Princess
Mary
,
blaming
her
for
her
*NL*
superstitions
and
her
dislike
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
who
,
he
said
,
*NL*
was
the
only
person
really
attached
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
said
that
if
he
was
ill
it
was
only
because
of
Princess
*NL*
Mary
:
that
she
purposely
worried
and
irritated
him
,
and
that
by
*NL*
indulgence
and
silly
talk
she
was
spoiling
little
Prince
Nicholas
.
The
*NL*
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
he
tormented
his
daughter
and
that
her
*NL*
life
was
very
hard
,
but
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
help
tormenting
*NL*
her
and
that
she
deserved
it
.
``
Why
does
Prince
Andrew
,
who
sees
this
,
*NL*
say
nothing
to
me
about
his
sister
?
Does
he
think
me
a
scoundrel
,
or
an
*NL*
old
fool
who
,
without
any
reason
,
keeps
his
own
daughter
at
a
distance
*NL*
and
attaches
this
Frenchwoman
to
himself
?
He
does
n't
understand
,
so
I
*NL*
must
explain
it
,
and
he
must
hear
me
out
,
''
thought
the
old
prince
.
And
*NL*
he
began
explaining
why
he
could
not
put
up
with
his
daughter
's
*NL*
unreasonable
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ask
me
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
without
looking
up
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
censuring
his
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
-RRB-
,
``
I
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
speak
about
it
,
but
as
you
ask
me
I
will
give
you
my
frank
opinion
.
If
*NL*
there
is
any
misunderstanding
and
discord
between
you
and
Mary
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
blame
her
for
it
at
all
.
I
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
you
.
Since
*NL*
you
ask
me
,
''
continued
Prince
Andrew
,
becoming
irritable
--
as
he
was
*NL*
always
liable
to
do
of
late
--
``
I
can
only
say
that
if
there
are
any
*NL*
misunderstandings
they
are
caused
by
that
worthless
woman
,
who
is
not
*NL*
fit
to
be
my
sister
's
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
at
first
stared
fixedly
at
his
son
,
and
an
unnatural
smile
*NL*
disclosed
the
fresh
gap
between
his
teeth
to
which
Prince
Andrew
could
*NL*
not
get
accustomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
companion
,
my
dear
boy
?
Eh
?
You
've
already
been
talking
it
over
!
*NL*
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
did
not
want
to
judge
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
in
a
hard
and
*NL*
bitter
tone
,
``
but
you
challenged
me
,
and
I
have
said
,
and
always
shall
*NL*
say
,
that
Mary
is
not
to
blame
,
but
those
to
blame
--
the
one
to
blame
--
is
*NL*
that
Frenchwoman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
has
passed
judgment
...
passed
judgement
!
''
said
the
old
man
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
*NL*
but
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
cried
:
``
Be
off
,
be
off
!
Let
not
a
*NL*
trace
of
you
remain
here
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
wished
to
leave
at
once
,
but
Princess
Mary
persuaded
him
*NL*
to
stay
another
day
.
That
day
he
did
not
see
his
father
,
who
did
not
*NL*
leave
his
room
and
admitted
no
one
but
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
*NL*
Tikhon
,
but
asked
several
times
whether
his
son
had
gone
.
Next
day
,
*NL*
before
leaving
,
Prince
Andrew
went
to
his
son
's
rooms
.
The
boy
,
curly
-
*NL*
headed
like
his
mother
and
glowing
with
health
,
sat
on
his
knee
,
and
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
began
telling
him
the
story
of
Bluebeard
,
but
fell
into
a
*NL*
reverie
without
finishing
the
story
.
He
thought
not
of
this
pretty
*NL*
child
,
his
son
whom
he
held
on
his
knee
,
but
of
himself
.
He
sought
in
*NL*
himself
either
remorse
for
having
angered
his
father
or
regret
at
*NL*
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
on
bad
terms
with
him
,
and
*NL*
was
horrified
to
find
neither
.
What
meant
still
more
to
him
was
that
he
*NL*
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
*NL*
which
he
had
hoped
to
reawaken
by
caressing
the
boy
and
taking
him
on
*NL*
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
on
!
''
said
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
without
replying
,
put
him
down
from
his
knee
and
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Prince
Andrew
had
given
up
his
daily
occupations
,
and
*NL*
especially
on
returning
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
amid
which
he
had
*NL*
been
happy
,
weariness
of
life
overcame
him
with
its
former
intensity
,
*NL*
and
he
hastened
to
escape
from
these
memories
and
to
find
some
work
as
*NL*
soon
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
decided
to
go
,
Andrew
?
''
asked
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
that
I
can
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
.
``
I
am
very
sorry
you
*NL*
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
that
?
''
replied
Princess
Mary
.
``
Why
do
you
say
that
,
when
*NL*
you
are
going
to
this
terrible
war
,
and
he
is
so
old
?
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
says
he
has
been
asking
about
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
of
that
,
her
lips
trembled
and
her
tears
*NL*
began
to
fall
.
Prince
Andrew
turned
away
and
began
pacing
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
God
!
my
God
!
When
one
thinks
who
and
what
--
what
trash
--
can
cause
*NL*
people
misery
!
''
he
said
with
a
malignity
that
alarmed
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
understood
that
when
speaking
of
``
trash
''
he
referred
not
only
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
the
cause
of
her
misery
,
but
also
to
the
man
who
*NL*
had
ruined
his
own
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
!
One
thing
I
beg
,
I
entreat
of
you
!
''
she
said
,
touching
his
*NL*
elbow
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
shone
through
her
tears
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
you
''
-LRB-
she
looked
down
-RRB-
.
``
Do
n't
imagine
that
sorrow
is
the
*NL*
work
of
men
.
Men
are
His
tools
.
''
She
looked
a
little
above
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
head
with
the
confident
,
accustomed
look
with
which
one
looks
*NL*
at
the
place
where
a
familiar
portrait
hangs
.
``
Sorrow
is
sent
by
Him
,
*NL*
not
by
men
.
Men
are
His
instruments
,
they
are
not
to
blame
.
If
you
think
*NL*
someone
has
wronged
you
,
forget
it
and
forgive
!
We
have
no
right
to
*NL*
punish
.
And
then
you
will
know
the
happiness
of
forgiving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
a
woman
I
would
do
so
,
Mary
.
That
is
a
woman
's
virtue
.
But
a
*NL*
man
should
not
and
can
not
forgive
and
forget
,
''
he
replied
,
and
though
*NL*
till
that
moment
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
Kuragin
,
all
his
unexpended
*NL*
anger
suddenly
swelled
up
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mary
is
already
persuading
me
to
forgive
,
it
means
that
I
ought
long
*NL*
ago
to
have
punished
him
,
''
he
thought
.
And
giving
her
no
further
reply
,
*NL*
he
began
thinking
of
the
glad
vindictive
moment
when
he
would
meet
*NL*
Kuragin
who
he
knew
was
now
in
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
begged
him
to
stay
one
day
more
,
saying
that
she
knew
how
*NL*
unhappy
her
father
would
be
if
Andrew
left
without
being
reconciled
to
*NL*
him
,
but
Prince
Andrew
replied
that
he
would
probably
soon
be
back
again
*NL*
from
the
army
and
would
certainly
write
to
his
father
,
but
that
the
*NL*
longer
he
stayed
now
the
more
embittered
their
differences
would
become
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Andrew
!
Remember
that
misfortunes
come
from
God
,
and
men
are
*NL*
never
to
blame
,
''
were
the
last
words
he
heard
from
his
sister
when
he
*NL*
took
leave
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
must
be
so
!
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
drove
out
of
the
*NL*
avenue
from
the
house
at
Bald
Hills
.
``
She
,
poor
innocent
creature
,
is
*NL*
left
to
be
victimized
by
an
old
man
who
has
outlived
his
wits
.
The
old
*NL*
man
feels
he
is
guilty
,
but
can
not
change
himself
.
My
boy
is
growing
up
*NL*
and
rejoices
in
life
,
in
which
like
everybody
else
he
will
deceive
or
be
*NL*
deceived
.
And
I
am
off
to
the
army
.
Why
?
I
myself
do
n't
know
.
I
want
to
*NL*
meet
that
man
whom
I
despise
,
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
to
kill
and
*NL*
laugh
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
conditions
of
life
had
been
the
same
before
,
but
then
they
were
*NL*
all
connected
,
while
now
they
had
all
tumbled
to
pieces
.
Only
senseless
*NL*
things
,
lacking
coherence
,
presented
themselves
one
after
another
to
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
mind
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
general
headquarters
of
the
army
at
the
end
of
*NL*
June
.
The
first
army
,
with
which
was
the
Emperor
,
occupied
the
fortified
*NL*
camp
at
Drissa
;
the
second
army
was
retreating
,
trying
to
effect
a
*NL*
junction
with
the
first
one
from
which
it
was
said
to
be
cut
off
by
*NL*
large
French
forces
.
Everyone
was
dissatisfied
with
the
general
course
*NL*
of
affairs
in
the
Russian
army
,
but
no
one
anticipated
any
danger
of
*NL*
invasion
of
the
Russian
provinces
,
and
no
one
thought
the
war
would
*NL*
extend
farther
than
the
western
,
the
Polish
,
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
found
Barclay
de
Tolly
,
to
whom
he
had
been
assigned
,
on
*NL*
the
bank
of
the
Drissa
.
As
there
was
not
a
single
town
or
large
village
*NL*
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp
,
the
immense
number
of
generals
and
*NL*
courtiers
accompanying
the
army
were
living
in
the
best
houses
of
the
*NL*
villages
on
both
sides
of
the
river
,
over
a
radius
of
six
miles
.
Barclay
*NL*
de
Tolly
was
quartered
nearly
three
miles
from
the
Emperor
.
He
received
*NL*
Bolkonski
stiffly
and
coldly
and
told
him
in
his
foreign
accent
that
he
*NL*
would
mention
him
to
the
Emperor
for
a
decision
as
to
his
employment
,
*NL*
but
asked
him
meanwhile
to
remain
on
his
staff
.
Anatole
Kuragin
,
whom
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
hoped
to
find
with
the
army
,
was
not
there
.
He
had
*NL*
gone
to
Petersburg
,
but
Prince
Andrew
was
glad
to
hear
this
.
His
mind
*NL*
was
occupied
by
the
interests
of
the
center
that
was
conducting
a
*NL*
gigantic
war
,
and
he
was
glad
to
be
free
for
a
while
from
the
*NL*
distraction
caused
by
the
thought
of
Kuragin
.
During
the
first
four
*NL*
days
,
while
no
duties
were
required
of
him
,
Prince
Andrew
rode
round
the
*NL*
whole
fortified
camp
and
,
by
the
aid
of
his
own
knowledge
and
by
talks
*NL*
with
experts
,
tried
to
form
a
definite
opinion
about
it
.
But
the
*NL*
question
whether
the
camp
was
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
remained
*NL*
for
him
undecided
.
Already
from
his
military
experience
and
what
he
had
*NL*
seen
in
the
Austrian
campaign
,
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
war
*NL*
the
most
deeply
considered
plans
have
no
significance
and
that
all
*NL*
depends
on
the
way
unexpected
movements
of
the
enemy
--
that
can
not
be
*NL*
foreseen
--
are
met
,
and
on
how
and
by
whom
the
whole
matter
is
handled
.
*NL*
To
clear
up
this
last
point
for
himself
,
Prince
Andrew
,
utilizing
his
*NL*
position
and
acquaintances
,
tried
to
fathom
the
character
of
the
control
*NL*
of
the
army
and
of
the
men
and
parties
engaged
in
it
,
and
he
deduced
for
*NL*
himself
the
following
of
the
state
of
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
Emperor
had
still
been
at
Vilna
,
the
forces
had
been
divided
*NL*
into
three
armies
.
First
,
the
army
under
Barclay
de
Tolly
,
secondly
,
the
*NL*
army
under
Bagration
,
and
thirdly
,
the
one
commanded
by
Tormasov
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
was
with
the
first
army
,
but
not
as
commander-in-chief
.
In
the
*NL*
orders
issued
it
was
stated
,
not
that
the
Emperor
would
take
command
,
*NL*
but
only
that
he
would
be
with
the
army
.
The
Emperor
,
moreover
,
had
with
*NL*
him
not
a
commander-in-chief
's
staff
but
the
imperial
headquarters
*NL*
staff
.
In
attendance
on
him
was
the
head
of
the
imperial
staff
,
*NL*
Quartermaster
General
Prince
Volkonski
,
as
well
as
generals
,
imperial
*NL*
aides-de-camp
,
diplomatic
officials
,
and
a
large
number
of
foreigners
,
*NL*
but
not
the
army
staff
.
Besides
these
,
there
were
in
attendance
on
the
*NL*
Emperor
without
any
definite
appointments
:
Arakcheev
,
the
ex-Minister
of
*NL*
War
;
Count
Bennigsen
,
the
senior
general
in
rank
;
the
Grand
Duke
*NL*
Tsarevich
Constantine
Pavlovich
;
Count
Rumyantsev
,
the
Chancellor
;
*NL*
Stein
,
a
former
Prussian
minister
;
Armfeldt
,
a
Swedish
general
;
Pfuel
,
*NL*
the
chief
author
of
the
plan
of
campaign
;
Paulucci
,
an
adjutant
general
*NL*
and
Sardinian
emigre
;
Wolzogen
--
and
many
others
.
Though
these
men
had
no
*NL*
military
appointment
in
the
army
,
their
position
gave
them
influence
,
*NL*
and
often
a
corps
commander
,
or
even
the
commander-in-chief
,
did
not
*NL*
know
in
what
capacity
he
was
questioned
by
Bennigsen
,
the
Grand
Duke
,
*NL*
Arakcheev
,
or
Prince
Volkonski
,
or
was
given
this
or
that
advice
and
did
*NL*
not
know
whether
a
certain
order
received
in
the
form
of
advice
emanated
*NL*
from
the
man
who
gave
it
or
from
the
Emperor
and
whether
it
had
to
be
*NL*
executed
or
not
.
But
this
was
only
the
external
condition
;
the
essential
*NL*
significance
of
the
presence
of
the
Emperor
and
of
all
these
people
,
*NL*
from
a
courtier
's
point
of
view
-LRB-
and
in
an
Emperor
's
vicinity
all
became
*NL*
courtiers
-RRB-
,
was
clear
to
everyone
.
It
was
this
:
the
Emperor
did
not
*NL*
assume
the
title
of
commander-in-chief
,
but
disposed
of
all
the
armies
;
*NL*
the
men
around
him
were
his
assistants
.
Arakcheev
was
a
faithful
*NL*
custodian
to
enforce
order
and
acted
as
the
sovereign
's
bodyguard
.
*NL*
Bennigsen
was
a
landlord
in
the
Vilna
province
who
appeared
to
be
doing
*NL*
the
honors
of
the
district
,
but
was
in
reality
a
good
general
,
useful
as
*NL*
an
adviser
and
ready
at
hand
to
replace
Barclay
.
The
Grand
Duke
was
*NL*
there
because
it
suited
him
to
be
.
The
ex-Minister
Stein
was
there
*NL*
because
his
advice
was
useful
and
the
Emperor
Alexander
held
him
in
high
*NL*
esteem
personally
.
Armfeldt
virulently
hated
Napoleon
and
was
a
general
*NL*
full
of
self-confidence
,
a
quality
that
always
influenced
Alexander
.
*NL*
Paulucci
was
there
because
he
was
bold
and
decided
in
speech
.
The
*NL*
adjutants
general
were
there
because
they
always
accompanied
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
and
lastly
and
chiefly
Pfuel
was
there
because
he
had
drawn
up
*NL*
the
plan
of
campaign
against
Napoleon
and
,
having
induced
Alexander
to
*NL*
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
that
plan
,
was
directing
the
whole
business
*NL*
of
the
war
.
With
Pfuel
was
Wolzogen
,
who
expressed
Pfuel
's
thoughts
in
a
*NL*
more
comprehensible
way
than
Pfuel
himself
-LRB-
who
was
a
harsh
,
bookish
*NL*
theorist
,
self-confident
to
the
point
of
despising
everyone
else
-RRB-
was
*NL*
able
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
these
Russians
and
foreigners
who
propounded
new
and
unexpected
*NL*
ideas
every
day
--
especially
the
foreigners
,
who
did
so
with
a
boldness
*NL*
characteristic
of
people
employed
in
a
country
not
their
own
--
there
were
*NL*
many
secondary
personages
accompanying
the
army
because
their
principals
*NL*
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
opinions
and
voices
in
this
immense
,
restless
,
brilliant
,
and
*NL*
proud
sphere
,
Prince
Andrew
noticed
the
following
sharply
defined
*NL*
subdivisions
of
tendencies
and
parties
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
party
consisted
of
Pfuel
and
his
adherents
--
military
theorists
*NL*
who
believed
in
a
science
of
war
with
immutable
laws
--
laws
of
oblique
*NL*
movements
,
outflankings
,
and
so
forth
.
Pfuel
and
his
adherents
demanded
*NL*
a
retirement
into
the
depths
of
the
country
in
accordance
with
precise
*NL*
laws
defined
by
a
pseudo-theory
of
war
,
and
they
saw
only
barbarism
,
*NL*
ignorance
,
or
evil
intention
in
every
deviation
from
that
theory
.
To
*NL*
this
party
belonged
the
foreign
nobles
,
Wolzogen
,
Wintzingerode
,
and
*NL*
others
,
chiefly
Germans
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
party
was
directly
opposed
to
the
first
;
one
extreme
,
as
*NL*
always
happens
,
was
met
by
representatives
of
the
other
.
The
members
of
*NL*
this
party
were
those
who
had
demanded
an
advance
from
Vilna
into
Poland
*NL*
and
freedom
from
all
prearranged
plans
.
Besides
being
advocates
of
bold
*NL*
action
,
this
section
also
represented
nationalism
,
which
made
them
still
*NL*
more
one-sided
in
the
dispute
.
They
were
Russians
:
Bagration
,
Ermolov
*NL*
-LRB-
who
was
beginning
to
come
to
the
front
-RRB-
,
and
others
.
At
that
time
a
*NL*
famous
joke
of
Ermolov
's
was
being
circulated
,
that
as
a
great
favor
he
*NL*
had
petitioned
the
Emperor
to
make
him
a
German
.
The
men
of
that
party
,
*NL*
remembering
Suvorov
,
said
that
what
one
had
to
do
was
not
to
reason
,
or
*NL*
stick
pins
into
maps
,
but
to
fight
,
beat
the
enemy
,
keep
him
out
of
*NL*
Russia
,
and
not
let
the
army
get
discouraged
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
third
party
--
in
which
the
Emperor
had
most
confidence
--
belonged
*NL*
the
courtiers
who
tried
to
arrange
compromises
between
the
other
two
.
*NL*
The
members
of
this
party
,
chiefly
civilians
and
to
whom
Arakcheev
*NL*
belonged
,
thought
and
said
what
men
who
have
no
convictions
but
wish
to
*NL*
seem
to
have
some
generally
say
.
They
said
that
undoubtedly
war
,
*NL*
particularly
against
such
a
genius
as
Bonaparte
-LRB-
they
called
him
*NL*
Bonaparte
now
-RRB-
,
needs
most
deeply
devised
plans
and
profound
scientific
*NL*
knowledge
and
in
that
respect
Pfuel
was
a
genius
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
it
had
to
be
acknowledged
that
the
theorists
are
often
one-sided
,
and
*NL*
therefore
one
should
not
trust
them
absolutely
,
but
should
also
listen
*NL*
to
what
Pfuel
's
opponents
and
practical
men
of
experience
in
warfare
had
*NL*
to
say
,
and
then
choose
a
middle
course
.
They
insisted
on
the
retention
*NL*
of
the
camp
at
Drissa
,
according
to
Pfuel
's
plan
,
but
on
changing
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
other
armies
.
Though
,
by
this
course
,
neither
one
aim
*NL*
nor
the
other
could
be
attained
,
yet
it
seemed
best
to
the
adherents
of
*NL*
this
third
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
fourth
opinion
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
*NL*
Tsarevich
,
who
could
not
forget
his
disillusionment
at
Austerlitz
,
where
*NL*
he
had
ridden
out
at
the
head
of
the
Guards
,
in
his
casque
and
cavalry
*NL*
uniform
as
to
a
review
,
expecting
to
crush
the
French
gallantly
;
but
*NL*
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
front
line
had
narrowly
escaped
amid
*NL*
the
general
confusion
.
The
men
of
this
party
had
both
the
quality
and
*NL*
the
defect
of
frankness
in
their
opinions
.
They
feared
Napoleon
,
*NL*
recognized
his
strength
and
their
own
weakness
,
and
frankly
said
so
.
*NL*
They
said
:
``
Nothing
but
sorrow
,
shame
,
and
ruin
will
come
of
all
this
!
*NL*
We
have
abandoned
Vilna
and
Vitebsk
and
shall
abandon
Drissa
.
The
only
*NL*
reasonable
thing
left
to
do
is
to
conclude
peace
as
soon
as
possible
,
*NL*
before
we
are
turned
out
of
Petersburg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
view
was
very
general
in
the
upper
army
circles
and
found
support
*NL*
also
in
Petersburg
and
from
the
chancellor
,
Rumyantsev
,
who
,
for
other
*NL*
reasons
of
state
,
was
in
favor
of

*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
party
consisted
of
those
who
were
adherents
of
Barclay
de
*NL*
Tolly
,
not
so
much
as
a
man
but
as
minister
of
war
and
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
.
``
Be
he
what
he
may
''
-LRB-
they
always
began
like
that
-RRB-
,
``
he
is
an
*NL*
honest
,
practical
man
and
we
have
nobody
better
.
Give
him
real
power
,
*NL*
for
war
can
not
be
conducted
successfully
without
unity
of
command
,
and
*NL*
he
will
show
what
he
can
do
,
as
he
did
in
Finland
.
If
our
army
is
well
*NL*
organized
and
strong
and
has
withdrawn
to
Drissa
without
suffering
any
*NL*
defeats
,
we
owe
this
entirely
to
Barclay
.
If
Barclay
is
now
to
be
*NL*
superseded
by
Bennigsen
all
will
be
lost
,
for
Bennigsen
showed
his
*NL*
incapacity
already
in
1807
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixth
party
,
the
Bennigsenites
,
said
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
at
any
*NL*
rate
there
was
no
one
more
active
and
experienced
than
Bennigsen
:
``
and
*NL*
twist
about
as
you
may
,
you
will
have
to
come
to
Bennigsen
eventually
.
*NL*
Let
the
others
make
mistakes
now
!
''
said
they
,
arguing
that
our
*NL*
retirement
to
Drissa
was
a
most
shameful
reverse
and
an
unbroken
series
*NL*
of
blunders
.
``
The
more
mistakes
that
are
made
the
better
.
It
will
at
any
*NL*
rate
be
understood
all
the
sooner
that
things
can
not
go
on
like
this
.
*NL*
What
is
wanted
is
not
some
Barclay
or
other
,
but
a
man
like
Bennigsen
,
*NL*
who
made
his
mark
in
1807
,
and
to
whom
Napoleon
himself
did
justice
--
a
*NL*
man
whose
authority
would
be
willingly
recognized
,
and
Bennigsen
is
the
*NL*
only
such
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
seventh
party
consisted
of
the
sort
of
people
who
are
always
to
be
*NL*
found
,
especially
around
young
sovereigns
,
and
of
whom
there
were
*NL*
particularly
many
round
Alexander
--
generals
and
imperial
aides-de-camp
*NL*
passionately
devoted
to
the
Emperor
,
not
merely
as
a
monarch
but
as
a
*NL*
man
,
adoring
him
sincerely
and
disinterestedly
,
as
Rostov
had
done
in
*NL*
1805
,
and
who
saw
in
him
not
only
all
the
virtues
but
all
human
*NL*
capabilities
as
well
.
These
men
,
though
enchanted
with
the
sovereign
for
*NL*
refusing
the
command
of
the
army
,
yet
blamed
him
for
such
excessive
*NL*
modesty
,
and
only
desired
and
insisted
that
their
adored
sovereign
*NL*
should
abandon
his
diffidence
and
openly
announce
that
he
would
place
*NL*
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army
,
gather
round
him
a
commander-in-chief
's
*NL*
staff
,
and
,
consulting
experienced
theoreticians
and
practical
men
where
*NL*
necessary
,
would
himself
lead
the
troops
,
whose
spirits
would
thereby
be
*NL*
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eighth
and
largest
group
,
which
in
its
enormous
numbers
was
to
the
*NL*
others
as
ninety-nine
to
one
,
consisted
of
men
who
desired
neither
peace
*NL*
nor
war
,
neither
an
advance
nor
a
defensive
camp
at
the
Drissa
or
*NL*
anywhere
else
,
neither
Barclay
nor
the
Emperor
,
neither
Pfuel
nor
*NL*
Bennigsen
,
but
only
the
one
most
essential
thing
--
as
much
advantage
and
*NL*
pleasure
for
themselves
as
possible
.
In
the
troubled
waters
of
*NL*
conflicting
and
intersecting
intrigues
that
eddied
about
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
headquarters
,
it
was
possible
to
succeed
in
many
ways
unthinkable
at
*NL*
other
times
.
A
man
who
simply
wished
to
retain
his
lucrative
post
would
*NL*
today
agree
with
Pfuel
,
tomorrow
with
his
opponent
,
and
the
day
after
,
*NL*
merely
to
avoid
responsibility
or
to
please
the
Emperor
,
would
declare
*NL*
that
he
had
no
opinion
at
all
on
the
matter
.
Another
who
wished
to
gain
*NL*
some
advantage
would
attract
the
Emperor
's
attention
by
loudly
*NL*
advocating
the
very
thing
the
Emperor
had
hinted
at
the
day
before
,
and
*NL*
would
dispute
and
shout
at
the
council
,
beating
his
breast
and
*NL*
challenging
those
who
did
not
agree
with
him
to
duels
,
thereby
proving
*NL*
that
he
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
common
good
.
A
third
,
*NL*
in
the
absence
of
opponents
,
between
two
councils
would
simply
solicit
a
*NL*
special
gratuity
for
his
faithful
services
,
well
knowing
that
at
that
*NL*
moment
people
would
be
too
busy
to
refuse
him
.
A
fourth
while
seemingly
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
work
would
often
come
accidentally
under
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
eye
.
A
fifth
,
to
achieve
his
long-cherished
aim
of
dining
with
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
would
stubbornly
insist
on
the
correctness
or
falsity
of
some
*NL*
newly
emerging
opinion
and
for
this
object
would
produce
arguments
more
*NL*
or
less
forcible
and
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
men
of
this
party
were
fishing
for
rubles
,
decorations
,
and
*NL*
promotions
,
and
in
this
pursuit
watched
only
the
weathercock
of
imperial
*NL*
favor
,
and
directly
they
noticed
it
turning
in
any
direction
,
this
whole
*NL*
drone
population
of
the
army
began
blowing
hard
that
way
,
so
that
it
was
*NL*
all
the
harder
for
the
Emperor
to
turn
it
elsewhere
.
Amid
the
*NL*
uncertainties
of
the
position
,
with
the
menace
of
serious
danger
giving
*NL*
a
peculiarly
threatening
character
to
everything
,
amid
this
vortex
of
*NL*
intrigue
,
egotism
,
conflict
of
views
and
feelings
,
and
the
diversity
of
*NL*
race
among
these
people
--
this
eighth
and
largest
party
of
those
*NL*
preoccupied
with
personal
interests
imparted
great
confusion
and
*NL*
obscurity
to
the
common
task
.
Whatever
question
arose
,
a
swarm
of
these
*NL*
drones
,
without
having
finished
their
buzzing
on
a
previous
theme
,
flew
*NL*
over
to
the
new
one
and
by
their
hum
drowned
and
obscured
the
voices
of
*NL*
those
who
were
disputing
honestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
among
all
these
parties
,
just
at
the
time
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
*NL*
army
,
another
,
a
ninth
party
,
was
being
formed
and
was
beginning
to
*NL*
raise
its
voice
.
This
was
the
party
of
the
elders
,
reasonable
men
*NL*
experienced
and
capable
in
state
affairs
,
who
,
without
sharing
any
of
*NL*
those
conflicting
opinions
,
were
able
to
take
a
detached
view
of
what
*NL*
was
going
on
at
the
staff
at
headquarters
and
to
consider
means
of
*NL*
escape
from
this
muddle
,
indecision
,
intricacy
,
and
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
of
this
party
said
and
thought
that
what
was
wrong
resulted
*NL*
chiefly
from
the
Emperor
's
presence
in
the
army
with
his
military
court
*NL*
and
from
the
consequent
presence
there
of
an
indefinite
,
conditional
,
*NL*
and
unsteady
fluctuation
of
relations
,
which
is
in
place
at
court
but
*NL*
harmful
in
an
army
;
that
a
sovereign
should
reign
but
not
command
the
*NL*
army
,
and
that
the
only
way
out
of
the
position
would
be
for
the
Emperor
*NL*
and
his
court
to
leave
the
army
;
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
Emperor
*NL*
paralyzed
the
action
of
fifty
thousand
men
required
to
secure
his
*NL*
personal
safety
,
and
that
the
worst
commander-in-chief
,
if
independent
,
*NL*
would
be
better
than
the
very
best
one
trammeled
by
the
presence
and
*NL*
authority
of
the
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
the
time
Prince
Andrew
was
living
unoccupied
at
Drissa
,
*NL*
Shishkov
,
the
Secretary
of
State
and
one
of
the
chief
representatives
of
*NL*
this
party
,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Emperor
which
Arakcheev
and
Balashev
*NL*
agreed
to
sign
.
In
this
letter
,
availing
himself
of
permission
given
him
*NL*
by
the
Emperor
to
discuss
the
general
course
of
affairs
,
he
respectfully
*NL*
suggested
--
on
the
plea
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
sovereign
to
arouse
*NL*
a
warlike
spirit
in
the
people
of
the
capital
--
that
the
Emperor
should
*NL*
leave
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
arousing
of
the
people
by
their
sovereign
and
his
call
to
them
to
*NL*
defend
their
country
--
the
very
incitement
which
was
the
chief
cause
of
*NL*
Russia
's
triumph
in
so
far
as
it
was
produced
by
the
Tsar
's
personal
*NL*
presence
in
Moscow
--
was
suggested
to
the
Emperor
,
and
accepted
by
him
,
*NL*
as
a
pretext
for
quitting
the
army
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
had
not
yet
been
presented
to
the
Emperor
when
Barclay
,
one
*NL*
day
at
dinner
,
informed
Bolkonski
that
the
sovereign
wished
to
see
him
*NL*
personally
,
to
question
him
about
Turkey
,
and
that
Prince
Andrew
was
to
*NL*
present
himself
at
Bennigsen
's
quarters
at
six
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
News
was
received
at
the
Emperor
's
quarters
that
very
day
of
a
fresh
*NL*
movement
by
Napoleon
which
might
endanger
the
army
--
news
subsequently
*NL*
found
to
be
false
.
And
that
morning
Colonel
Michaud
had
ridden
round
the
*NL*
Drissa
fortifications
with
the
Emperor
and
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
*NL*
this
fortified
camp
constructed
by
Pfuel
,
and
till
then
considered
a
*NL*
chef-d'oeuvre
of
tactical
science
which
would
ensure
Napoleon
's
*NL*
destruction
,
was
an
absurdity
,
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
*NL*
Russian
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
arrived
at
Bennigsen
's
quarters
--
a
country
gentleman
's
*NL*
house
of
moderate
size
,
situated
on
the
very
banks
of
the
river
.
Neither
*NL*
Bennigsen
nor
the
Emperor
was
there
,
but
Chernyshev
,
the
Emperor
's
aide
-
*NL*
de-camp
,
received
Bolkonski
and
informed
him
that
the
Emperor
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
General
Bennigsen
and
Marquis
Paulucci
,
had
gone
a
second
*NL*
time
that
day
to
inspect
the
fortifications
of
the
Drissa
camp
,
of
the
*NL*
suitability
of
which
serious
doubts
were
beginning
to
be
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chernyshev
was
sitting
at
a
window
in
the
first
room
with
a
French
novel
*NL*
in
his
hand
.
This
room
had
probably
been
a
music
room
;
there
was
still
*NL*
an
organ
in
it
on
which
some
rugs
were
piled
,
and
in
one
corner
stood
*NL*
the
folding
bedstead
of
Bennigsen
's
adjutant
.
This
adjutant
was
also
*NL*
there
and
sat
dozing
on
the
rolled-up
bedding
,
evidently
exhausted
by
*NL*
work
or
by
feasting
.
Two
doors
led
from
the
room
,
one
straight
on
into
*NL*
what
had
been
the
drawing
room
,
and
another
,
on
the
right
,
to
the
study
.
*NL*
Through
the
first
door
came
the
sound
of
voices
conversing
in
German
and
*NL*
occasionally
in
French
.
In
that
drawing
room
were
gathered
,
by
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
wish
,
not
a
military
council
-LRB-
the
Emperor
preferred
*NL*
indefiniteness
-RRB-
,
but
certain
persons
whose
opinions
he
wished
to
know
in
*NL*
view
of
the
impending
difficulties
.
It
was
not
a
council
of
war
,
but
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
a
council
to
elucidate
certain
questions
for
the
Emperor
*NL*
personally
.
To
this
semicouncil
had
been
invited
the
Swedish
General
*NL*
Armfeldt
,
Adjutant
General
Wolzogen
,
Wintzingerode
-LRB-
whom
Napoleon
had
*NL*
referred
to
as
a
renegade
French
subject
-RRB-
,
Michaud
,
Toll
,
Count
Stein
*NL*
who
was
not
a
military
man
at
all
,
and
Pfuel
himself
,
who
,
as
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
had
heard
,
was
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
affair
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
had
an
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
look
at
him
,
for
Pfuel
arrived
soon
*NL*
after
himself
and
,
in
passing
through
to
the
drawing
room
,
stopped
a
*NL*
minute
to
speak
to
Chernyshev
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
sight
,
Pfuel
,
in
his
ill-made
uniform
of
a
Russian
general
,
*NL*
which
fitted
him
badly
like
a
fancy
costume
,
seemed
familiar
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
though
he
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
.
There
was
about
him
*NL*
something
of
Weyrother
,
Mack
,
and
Schmidt
,
and
many
other
German
*NL*
theorist-generals
whom
Prince
Andrew
had
seen
in
1805
,
but
he
was
more
*NL*
typical
than
any
of
them
.
Prince
Andrew
had
never
yet
seen
a
German
*NL*
theorist
in
whom
all
the
characteristics
of
those
others
were
united
to
*NL*
such
an
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pfuel
was
short
and
very
thin
but
broad-boned
,
of
coarse
,
robust
build
,
*NL*
broad
in
the
hips
,
and
with
prominent
shoulder
blades
.
His
face
was
much
*NL*
wrinkled
and
his
eyes
deep
set
.
His
hair
had
evidently
been
hastily
*NL*
brushed
smooth
in
front
of
the
temples
,
but
stuck
up
behind
in
quaint
*NL*
little
tufts
.
He
entered
the
room
,
looking
restlessly
and
angrily
*NL*
around
,
as
if
afraid
of
everything
in
that
large
apartment
.
Awkwardly
*NL*
holding
up
his
sword
,
he
addressed
Chernyshev
and
asked
in
German
where
*NL*
the
Emperor
was
.
One
could
see
that
he
wished
to
pass
through
the
rooms
*NL*
as
quickly
as
possible
,
finish
with
the
bows
and
greetings
,
and
sit
down
*NL*
to
business
in
front
of
a
map
,
where
he
would
feel
at
home
.
He
nodded
*NL*
hurriedly
in
reply
to
Chernyshev
,
and
smiled
ironically
on
hearing
that
*NL*
the
sovereign
was
inspecting
the
fortifications
that
he
,
Pfuel
,
had
*NL*
planned
in
accord
with
his
theory
.
He
muttered
something
to
himself
*NL*
abruptly
and
in
a
bass
voice
,
as
self-assured
Germans
do
--
it
might
have
*NL*
been
``
stupid
fellow
''
...
or
``
the
whole
affair
will
be
ruined
,
''
or
*NL*
``
something
absurd
will
come
of
it
.
''
...
Prince
Andrew
did
not
catch
what
*NL*
he
said
and
would
have
passed
on
,
but
Chernyshev
introduced
him
to
*NL*
Pfuel
,
remarking
that
Prince
Andrew
was
just
back
from
Turkey
where
the
*NL*
war
had
terminated
so
fortunately
.
Pfuel
barely
glanced
--
not
so
much
at
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
as
past
him
--
and
said
,
with
a
laugh
:
``
That
must
have
been
*NL*
a
fine
tactical
war
''
;
and
,
laughing
contemptuously
,
went
on
into
the
*NL*
room
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
was
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pfuel
,
always
inclined
to
be
irritably
sarcastic
,
was
particularly
*NL*
disturbed
that
day
,
evidently
by
the
fact
that
they
had
dared
to
inspect
*NL*
and
criticize
his
camp
in
his
absence
.
From
this
short
interview
with
*NL*
Pfuel
,
Prince
Andrew
,
thanks
to
his
Austerlitz
experiences
,
was
able
to
*NL*
form
a
clear
conception
of
the
man
.
Pfuel
was
one
of
those
hopelessly
*NL*
and
immutably
self-confident
men
,
self-confident
to
the
point
of
*NL*
martyrdom
as
only
Germans
are
,
because
only
Germans
are
self-confident
*NL*
on
the
basis
of
an
abstract
notion
--
science
,
that
is
,
the
supposed
*NL*
knowledge
of
absolute
truth
.
A
Frenchman
is
self-assured
because
he
*NL*
regards
himself
personally
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
as
irresistibly
*NL*
attractive
to
men
and
women
.
An
Englishman
is
self-assured
,
as
being
a
*NL*
citizen
of
the
best-organized
state
in
the
world
,
and
therefore
as
an
*NL*
Englishman
always
knows
what
he
should
do
and
knows
that
all
he
does
as
*NL*
an
Englishman
is
undoubtedly
correct
.
An
Italian
is
self-assured
because
*NL*
he
is
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
other
people
.
A
Russian
*NL*
is
self-assured
just
because
he
knows
nothing
and
does
not
want
to
know
*NL*
anything
,
since
he
does
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
known
.
The
*NL*
German
's
self-assurance
is
worst
of
all
,
stronger
and
more
repulsive
*NL*
than
any
other
,
because
he
imagines
that
he
knows
the
truth
--
science
--
*NL*
which
he
himself
has
invented
but
which
is
for
him
the
absolute
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pfuel
was
evidently
of
that
sort
.
He
had
a
science
--
the
theory
of
*NL*
oblique
movements
deduced
by
him
from
the
history
of
Frederick
the
*NL*
Great
's
wars
,
and
all
he
came
across
in
the
history
of
more
recent
*NL*
warfare
seemed
to
him
absurd
and
barbarous
--
monstrous
collisions
in
*NL*
which
so
many
blunders
were
committed
by
both
sides
that
these
wars
*NL*
could
not
be
called
wars
,
they
did
not
accord
with
the
theory
,
and
*NL*
therefore
could
not
serve
as
material
for
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1806
Pfuel
had
been
one
of
those
responsible
,
for
the
plan
of
*NL*
campaign
that
ended
in
Jena
and
Auerstadt
,
but
he
did
not
see
the
least
*NL*
proof
of
the
fallibility
of
his
theory
in
the
disasters
of
that
war
.
On
*NL*
the
contrary
,
the
deviations
made
from
his
theory
were
,
in
his
opinion
,
*NL*
the
sole
cause
of
the
whole
disaster
,
and
with
characteristically
*NL*
gleeful
sarcasm
he
would
remark
,
``
There
,
I
said
the
whole
affair
would
*NL*
go
to
the
devil
!
''
Pfuel
was
one
of
those
theoreticians
who
so
love
their
*NL*
theory
that
they
lose
sight
of
the
theory
's
object
--
its
practical
*NL*
application
.
His
love
of
theory
made
him
hate
everything
practical
,
and
*NL*
he
would
not
listen
to
it
.
He
was
even
pleased
by
failures
,
for
failures
*NL*
resulting
from
deviations
in
practice
from
the
theory
only
proved
to
him
*NL*
the
accuracy
of
his
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
a
few
words
to
Prince
Andrew
and
Chernyshev
about
the
present
*NL*
war
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
all
will
go
wrong
,
*NL*
and
who
is
not
displeased
that
it
should
be
so
.
The
unbrushed
tufts
of
*NL*
hair
sticking
up
behind
and
the
hastily
brushed
hair
on
his
temples
*NL*
expressed
this
most
eloquently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
into
the
next
room
,
and
the
deep
,
querulous
sounds
of
his
*NL*
voice
were
at
once
heard
from
there
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
eyes
were
still
following
Pfuel
out
of
the
room
when
*NL*
Count
Bennigsen
entered
hurriedly
,
and
nodding
to
Bolkonski
,
but
not
*NL*
pausing
,
went
into
the
study
,
giving
instructions
to
his
adjutant
as
he
*NL*
went
.
The
Emperor
was
following
him
,
and
Bennigsen
had
hastened
on
to
*NL*
make
some
preparations
and
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
sovereign
.
*NL*
Chernyshev
and
Prince
Andrew
went
out
into
the
porch
,
where
the
Emperor
,
*NL*
who
looked
fatigued
,
was
dismounting
.
Marquis
Paulucci
was
talking
to
*NL*
him
with
particular
warmth
and
the
Emperor
,
with
his
head
bent
to
the
*NL*
left
,
was
listening
with
a
dissatisfied
air
.
The
Emperor
moved
forward
*NL*
evidently
wishing
to
end
the
conversation
,
but
the
flushed
and
excited
*NL*
Italian
,
oblivious
of
decorum
,
followed
him
and
continued
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
for
the
man
who
advised
forming
this
camp
--
the
Drissa
camp
,
''
*NL*
said
Paulucci
,
as
the
Emperor
mounted
the
steps
and
noticing
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
scanned
his
unfamiliar
face
,
``
as
to
that
person
,
sire
...
''
*NL*
continued
Paulucci
,
desperately
,
apparently
unable
to
restrain
himself
,
*NL*
``
the
man
who
advised
the
Drissa
camp
--
I
see
no
alternative
but
the
*NL*
lunatic
asylum
or
the
gallows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
heeding
the
end
of
the
Italian
's
remarks
,
and
as
though
not
*NL*
hearing
them
,
the
Emperor
,
recognizing
Bolkonski
,
addressed
him
*NL*
graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
!
Go
in
there
where
they
are
meeting
,
and
wait
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
went
into
the
study
.
He
was
followed
by
Prince
Peter
*NL*
Mikhaylovich
Volkonski
and
Baron
Stein
,
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
taking
advantage
of
the
Emperor
's
permission
,
accompanied
*NL*
Paulucci
,
whom
he
had
known
in
Turkey
,
into
the
drawing
room
where
the
*NL*
council
was
assembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Peter
Mikhaylovich
Volkonski
occupied
the
position
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
of
chief
of
the
Emperor
's
staff
.
He
came
out
of
the
study
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
with
some
maps
which
he
spread
on
a
table
,
and
put
*NL*
questions
on
which
he
wished
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
gentlemen
*NL*
present
.
What
had
happened
was
that
news
-LRB-
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
*NL*
false
-RRB-
had
been
received
during
the
night
of
a
movement
by
the
French
to
*NL*
outflank
the
Drissa
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
speak
was
General
Armfeldt
who
,
to
meet
the
difficulty
that
*NL*
presented
itself
,
unexpectedly
proposed
a
perfectly
new
position
away
*NL*
from
the
Petersburg
and
Moscow
roads
.
The
reason
for
this
was
*NL*
inexplicable
-LRB-
unless
he
wished
to
show
that
he
,
too
,
could
have
an
*NL*
opinion
-RRB-
,
but
he
urged
that
at
this
point
the
army
should
unite
and
*NL*
there
await
the
enemy
.
It
was
plain
that
Armfeldt
had
thought
out
that
*NL*
plan
long
ago
and
now
expounded
it
not
so
much
to
answer
the
questions
*NL*
put
--
which
,
in
fact
,
his
plan
did
not
answer
--
as
to
avail
himself
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
to
air
it
.
It
was
one
of
the
millions
of
proposals
,
one
as
*NL*
good
as
another
,
that
could
be
made
as
long
as
it
was
quite
unknown
what
*NL*
character
the
war
would
take
.
Some
disputed
his
arguments
,
others
*NL*
defended
them
.
Young
Count
Toll
objected
to
the
Swedish
general
's
views
*NL*
more
warmly
than
anyone
else
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
drew
from
*NL*
his
side
pocket
a
well-filled
notebook
,
which
he
asked
permission
to
*NL*
read
to
them
.
In
these
voluminous
notes
Toll
suggested
another
scheme
,
*NL*
totally
different
from
Armfeldt
's
or
Pfuel
's
plan
of
campaign
.
In
answer
*NL*
to
Toll
,
Paulucci
suggested
an
advance
and
an
attack
,
which
,
he
urged
,
*NL*
could
alone
extricate
us
from
the
present
uncertainty
and
from
the
trap
*NL*
-LRB-
as
he
called
the
Drissa
camp
-RRB-
in
which
we
were
situated
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
these
discussions
Pfuel
and
his
interpreter
,
Wolzogen
-LRB-
his
*NL*
``
bridge
''
in
court
relations
-RRB-
,
were
silent
.
Pfuel
only
snorted
*NL*
contemptuously
and
turned
away
,
to
show
that
he
would
never
demean
*NL*
himself
by
replying
to
such
nonsense
as
he
was
now
hearing
.
So
when
*NL*
Prince
Volkonski
,
who
was
in
the
chair
,
called
on
him
to
give
his
*NL*
opinion
,
he
merely
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ask
me
?
General
Armfeldt
has
proposed
a
splendid
position
with
an
*NL*
exposed
rear
,
or
why
not
this
Italian
gentleman
's
attack
--
very
fine
,
or
*NL*
a
retreat
,
also
good
!
Why
ask
me
?
''
said
he
.
``
Why
,
you
yourselves
know
*NL*
everything
better
than
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Volkonski
said
,
with
a
frown
,
that
it
was
in
the
Emperor
's
name
*NL*
that
he
asked
his
opinion
,
Pfuel
rose
and
,
suddenly
growing
animated
,
*NL*
began
to
speak
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
has
been
spoiled
,
everything
muddled
,
everybody
thought
they
*NL*
knew
better
than
I
did
,
and
now
you
come
to
me
!
How
mend
matters
?
There
*NL*
is
nothing
to
mend
!
The
principles
laid
down
by
me
must
be
strictly
*NL*
adhered
to
,
''
said
he
,
drumming
on
the
table
with
his
bony
fingers
.
``
What
*NL*
is
the
difficulty
?
Nonsense
,
childishness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
the
map
and
speaking
rapidly
began
proving
that
no
*NL*
eventuality
could
alter
the
efficiency
of
the
Drissa
camp
,
that
*NL*
everything
had
been
foreseen
,
and
that
if
the
enemy
were
really
going
to
*NL*
outflank
it
,
the
enemy
would
inevitably
be
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paulucci
,
who
did
not
know
German
,
began
questioning
him
in
French
.
*NL*
Wolzogen
came
to
the
assistance
of
his
chief
,
who
spoke
French
badly
,
*NL*
and
began
translating
for
him
,
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
with
Pfuel
,
who
*NL*
was
rapidly
demonstrating
that
not
only
all
that
had
happened
,
but
all
*NL*
that
could
happen
,
had
been
foreseen
in
his
scheme
,
and
that
if
there
*NL*
were
now
any
difficulties
the
whole
fault
lay
in
the
fact
that
his
plan
*NL*
had
not
been
precisely
executed
.
He
kept
laughing
sarcastically
,
he
*NL*
demonstrated
,
and
at
last
contemptuously
ceased
to
demonstrate
,
like
a
*NL*
mathematician
who
ceases
to
prove
in
various
ways
the
accuracy
of
a
*NL*
problem
that
has
already
been
proved
.
Wolzogen
took
his
place
and
*NL*
continued
to
explain
his
views
in
French
,
every
now
and
then
turning
to
*NL*
Pfuel
and
saying
,
``
Is
it
not
so
,
your
excellency
?
''
But
Pfuel
,
like
a
man
*NL*
heated
in
a
fight
who
strikes
those
on
his
own
side
,
shouted
angrily
at
*NL*
his
own
supporter
,
Wolzogen
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
what
more
is
there
to
explain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paulucci
and
Michaud
both
attacked
Wolzogen
simultaneously
in
French
.
*NL*
Armfeldt
addressed
Pfuel
in
German
.
Toll
explained
to
Volkonski
in
*NL*
Russian
.
Prince
Andrew
listened
and
observed
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
these
men
Prince
Andrew
sympathized
most
with
Pfuel
,
angry
,
*NL*
determined
,
and
absurdly
self-confident
as
he
was
.
Of
all
those
present
,
*NL*
evidently
he
alone
was
not
seeking
anything
for
himself
,
nursed
no
*NL*
hatred
against
anyone
,
and
only
desired
that
the
plan
,
formed
on
a
*NL*
theory
arrived
at
by
years
of
toil
,
should
be
carried
out
.
He
was
*NL*
ridiculous
,
and
unpleasantly
sarcastic
,
but
yet
he
inspired
involuntary
*NL*
respect
by
his
boundless
devotion
to
an
idea
.
Besides
this
,
the
remarks
*NL*
of
all
except
Pfuel
had
one
common
trait
that
had
not
been
noticeable
at
*NL*
the
council
of
war
in
1805
:
there
was
now
a
panic
fear
of
Napoleon
's
*NL*
genius
,
which
,
though
concealed
,
was
noticeable
in
every
rejoinder
.
*NL*
Everything
was
assumed
to
be
possible
for
Napoleon
,
they
expected
him
*NL*
from
every
side
,
and
invoked
his
terrible
name
to
shatter
each
other
's
*NL*
proposals
.
Pfuel
alone
seemed
to
consider
Napoleon
a
barbarian
like
*NL*
everyone
else
who
opposed
his
theory
.
But
besides
this
feeling
of
*NL*
respect
,
Pfuel
evoked
pity
in
Prince
Andrew
.
From
the
tone
in
which
the
*NL*
courtiers
addressed
him
and
the
way
Paulucci
had
allowed
himself
to
*NL*
speak
of
him
to
the
Emperor
,
but
above
all
from
a
certain
desperation
in
*NL*
Pfuel
's
own
expressions
,
it
was
clear
that
the
others
knew
,
and
Pfuel
*NL*
himself
felt
,
that
his
fall
was
at
hand
.
And
despite
his
self-confidence
*NL*
and
grumpy
German
sarcasm
he
was
pitiable
,
with
his
hair
smoothly
*NL*
brushed
on
the
temples
and
sticking
up
in
tufts
behind
.
Though
he
*NL*
concealed
the
fact
under
a
show
of
irritation
and
contempt
,
he
was
*NL*
evidently
in
despair
that
the
sole
remaining
chance
of
verifying
his
*NL*
theory
by
a
huge
experiment
and
proving
its
soundness
to
the
whole
world
*NL*
was
slipping
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussions
continued
a
long
time
,
and
the
longer
they
lasted
the
*NL*
more
heated
became
the
disputes
,
culminating
in
shouts
and
*NL*
personalities
,
and
the
less
was
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
general
*NL*
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been
said
.
Prince
Andrew
,
listening
to
this
*NL*
polyglot
talk
and
to
these
surmises
,
plans
,
refutations
,
and
shouts
,
*NL*
felt
nothing
but
amazement
at
what
they
were
saying
.
A
thought
that
had
*NL*
long
since
and
often
occurred
to
him
during
his
military
activities
--
the
*NL*
idea
that
there
is
not
and
can
not
be
any
science
of
war
,
and
that
*NL*
therefore
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
military
genius
--
now
appeared
*NL*
to
him
an
obvious
truth
.
``
What
theory
and
science
is
possible
about
a
*NL*
matter
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
which
are
unknown
and
can
not
*NL*
be
defined
,
especially
when
the
strength
of
the
acting
forces
can
not
be
*NL*
ascertained
?
No
one
was
or
is
able
to
foresee
in
what
condition
our
or
*NL*
the
enemy
's
armies
will
be
in
a
day
's
time
,
and
no
one
can
gauge
the
*NL*
force
of
this
or
that
detachment
.
Sometimes
--
when
there
is
not
a
coward
*NL*
at
the
front
to
shout
,
`
We
are
cut
off
!
'
and
start
running
,
but
a
brave
*NL*
and
jolly
lad
who
shouts
,
`
Hurrah
!
'
--
a
detachment
of
five
thousand
is
*NL*
worth
thirty
thousand
,
as
at
Schon
Grabern
,
while
at
times
fifty
*NL*
thousand
run
from
eight
thousand
,
as
at
Austerlitz
.
What
science
can
*NL*
there
be
in
a
matter
in
which
,
as
in
all
practical
matters
,
nothing
can
*NL*
be
defined
and
everything
depends
on
innumerable
conditions
,
the
*NL*
significance
of
which
is
determined
at
a
particular
moment
which
arrives
*NL*
no
one
knows
when
?
Armfeldt
says
our
army
is
cut
in
half
,
and
Paulucci
*NL*
says
we
have
got
the
French
army
between
two
fires
;
Michaud
says
that
*NL*
the
worthlessness
of
the
Drissa
camp
lies
in
having
the
river
behind
it
,
*NL*
and
Pfuel
says
that
is
what
constitutes
its
strength
;
Toll
proposes
one
*NL*
plan
,
Armfeldt
another
,
and
they
are
all
good
and
all
bad
,
and
the
*NL*
advantages
of
any
suggestions
can
be
seen
only
at
the
moment
of
trial
.
*NL*
And
why
do
they
all
speak
of
a
`
military
genius
'
?
Is
a
man
a
genius
who
*NL*
can
order
bread
to
be
brought
up
at
the
right
time
and
say
who
is
to
go
*NL*
to
the
right
and
who
to
the
left
?
It
is
only
because
military
men
are
*NL*
invested
with
pomp
and
power
and
crowds
of
sychophants
flatter
power
,
*NL*
attributing
to
it
qualities
of
genius
it
does
not
possess
.
The
best
*NL*
generals
I
have
known
were
,
on
the
contrary
,
stupid
or
absent-minded
*NL*
men
.
Bagration
was
the
best
,
Napoleon
himself
admitted
that
.
And
of
*NL*
Bonaparte
himself
!
I
remember
his
limited
,
self-satisfied
face
on
the
*NL*
field
of
Austerlitz
.
Not
only
does
a
good
army
commander
not
need
any
*NL*
special
qualities
,
on
the
contrary
he
needs
the
absence
of
the
highest
*NL*
and
best
human
attributes
--
love
,
poetry
,
tenderness
,
and
philosophic
*NL*
inquiring
doubt
.
He
should
be
limited
,
firmly
convinced
that
what
he
is
*NL*
doing
is
very
important
-LRB-
otherwise
he
will
not
have
sufficient
*NL*
patience
-RRB-
,
and
only
then
will
he
be
a
brave
leader
.
God
forbid
that
he
*NL*
should
be
humane
,
should
love
,
or
pity
,
or
think
of
what
is
just
and
*NL*
unjust
.
It
is
understandable
that
a
theory
of
their
`
genius
'
was
*NL*
invented
for
them
long
ago
because
they
have
power
!
The
success
of
a
*NL*
military
action
depends
not
on
them
,
but
on
the
man
in
the
ranks
who
*NL*
shouts
,
`
We
are
lost
!
'
or
who
shouts
,
`
Hurrah
!
'
And
only
in
the
ranks
*NL*
can
one
serve
with
assurance
of
being
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
listened
to
the
talking
,
and
he
roused
*NL*
himself
only
when
Paulucci
called
him
and
everyone
was
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
review
next
day
the
Emperor
asked
Prince
Andrew
where
he
would
*NL*
like
to
serve
,
and
Prince
Andrew
lost
his
standing
in
court
circles
*NL*
forever
by
not
asking
to
remain
attached
to
the
sovereign
's
person
,
but
*NL*
for
permission
to
serve
in
the
army
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
,
Rostov
had
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
his
parents
in
which
they
told
him
briefly
of
Natasha
's
illness
and
the
*NL*
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
to
Prince
Andrew
-LRB-
which
they
explained
by
*NL*
Natasha
's
having
rejected
him
-RRB-
and
again
asked
Nicholas
to
retire
from
*NL*
the
army
and
return
home
.
On
receiving
this
letter
,
Nicholas
did
not
*NL*
even
make
any
attempt
to
get
leave
of
absence
or
to
retire
from
the
*NL*
army
,
but
wrote
to
his
parents
that
he
was
sorry
Natasha
was
ill
and
her
*NL*
engagement
broken
off
,
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
meet
their
*NL*
wishes
.
To
Sonya
he
wrote
separately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adored
friend
of
my
soul
!
''
he
wrote
.
``
Nothing
but
honor
could
keep
me
*NL*
from
returning
to
the
country
.
But
now
,
at
the
commencement
of
the
*NL*
campaign
,
I
should
feel
dishonored
,
not
only
in
my
comrades
'
eyes
but
in
*NL*
my
own
,
if
I
preferred
my
own
happiness
to
my
love
and
duty
to
the
*NL*
Fatherland
.
But
this
shall
be
our
last
separation
.
Believe
me
,
directly
*NL*
the
war
is
over
,
if
I
am
still
alive
and
still
loved
by
you
,
I
will
*NL*
throw
up
everything
and
fly
to
you
,
to
press
you
forever
to
my
ardent
*NL*
breast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
only
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
that
prevented
*NL*
Rostov
from
returning
home
as
he
had
promised
and
marrying
Sonya
.
The
*NL*
autumn
in
Otradnoe
with
the
hunting
,
and
the
winter
with
the
Christmas
*NL*
holidays
and
Sonya
's
love
,
had
opened
out
to
him
a
vista
of
tranquil
*NL*
rural
joys
and
peace
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
,
and
which
now
*NL*
allured
him
.
``
A
splendid
wife
,
children
,
a
good
pack
of
hounds
,
a
dozen
*NL*
leashes
of
smart
borzois
,
agriculture
,
neighbors
,
service
by
*NL*
election
...
''
thought
he
.
But
now
the
campaign
was
beginning
,
and
he
had
*NL*
to
remain
with
his
regiment
.
And
since
it
had
to
be
so
,
Nicholas
Rostov
,
*NL*
as
was
natural
to
him
,
felt
contented
with
the
life
he
led
in
the
*NL*
regiment
and
was
able
to
find
pleasure
in
that
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
from
his
furlough
Nicholas
,
having
been
joyfully
welcomed
*NL*
by
his
comrades
,
was
sent
to
obtain
remounts
and
brought
back
from
the
*NL*
Ukraine
excellent
horses
which
pleased
him
and
earned
him
commendation
*NL*
from
his
commanders
.
During
his
absence
he
had
been
promoted
captain
,
*NL*
and
when
the
regiment
was
put
on
war
footing
with
an
increase
in
*NL*
numbers
,
he
was
again
allotted
his
old
squadron
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
campaign
began
,
the
regiment
was
moved
into
Poland
on
double
pay
,
*NL*
new
officers
arrived
,
new
men
and
horses
,
and
above
all
everybody
was
*NL*
infected
with
the
merrily
excited
mood
that
goes
with
the
commencement
*NL*
of
a
war
,
and
Rostov
,
conscious
of
his
advantageous
position
in
the
*NL*
regiment
,
devoted
himself
entirely
to
the
pleasures
and
interests
of
*NL*
military
service
,
though
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
*NL*
relinquish
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troops
retired
from
Vilna
for
various
complicated
reasons
of
state
,
*NL*
political
and
strategic
.
Each
step
of
the
retreat
was
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
complicated
interplay
of
interests
,
arguments
,
and
passions
at
*NL*
headquarters
.
For
the
Pavlograd
hussars
,
however
,
the
whole
of
this
*NL*
retreat
during
the
finest
period
of
summer
and
with
sufficient
supplies
*NL*
was
a
very
simple
and
agreeable
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
at
headquarters
that
there
was
depression
,
uneasiness
,
and
*NL*
intriguing
;
in
the
body
of
the
army
they
did
not
ask
themselves
where
*NL*
they
were
going
or
why
.
If
they
regretted
having
to
retreat
,
it
was
only
*NL*
because
they
had
to
leave
billets
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
,
or
some
*NL*
pretty
young
Polish
lady
.
If
the
thought
that
things
looked
bad
chanced
*NL*
to
enter
anyone
's
head
,
he
tried
to
be
as
cheerful
as
befits
a
good
*NL*
soldier
and
not
to
think
of
the
general
trend
of
affairs
,
but
only
of
*NL*
the
task
nearest
to
hand
.
First
they
camped
gaily
before
Vilna
,
making
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
Polish
landowners
,
preparing
for
reviews
and
being
*NL*
reviewed
by
the
Emperor
and
other
high
commanders
.
Then
came
an
order
to
*NL*
retreat
to
Sventsyani
and
destroy
any
provisions
they
could
not
carry
*NL*
away
with
them
.
Sventsyani
was
remembered
by
the
hussars
only
as
the
*NL*
drunken
camp
,
a
name
the
whole
army
gave
to
their
encampment
there
,
and
*NL*
because
many
complaints
were
made
against
the
troops
,
who
,
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
the
order
to
collect
provisions
,
took
also
horses
,
*NL*
carriages
,
and
carpets
from
the
Polish
proprietors
.
Rostov
remembered
*NL*
Sventsyani
,
because
on
the
first
day
of
their
arrival
at
that
small
town
*NL*
he
changed
his
sergeant
major
and
was
unable
to
manage
all
the
drunken
*NL*
men
of
his
squadron
who
,
unknown
to
him
,
had
appropriated
five
barrels
*NL*
of
old
beer
.
From
Sventsyani
they
retired
farther
and
farther
to
Drissa
,
*NL*
and
thence
again
beyond
Drissa
,
drawing
near
to
the
frontier
of
Russia
*NL*
proper
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
thirteenth
of
July
the
Pavlograds
took
part
in
a
serious
action
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twelfth
of
July
,
on
the
eve
of
that
action
,
there
was
a
heavy
*NL*
storm
of
rain
and
hail
.
In
general
,
the
summer
of
1812
was
remarkable
*NL*
for
its
storms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Pavlograd
squadrons
were
bivouacking
on
a
field
of
rye
,
which
*NL*
was
already
in
ear
but
had
been
completely
trodden
down
by
cattle
and
*NL*
horses
.
The
rain
was
descending
in
torrents
,
and
Rostov
,
with
a
young
*NL*
officer
named
Ilyin
,
his
protege
,
was
sitting
in
a
hastily
constructed
*NL*
shelter
.
An
officer
of
their
regiment
,
with
long
mustaches
extending
*NL*
onto
his
cheeks
,
who
after
riding
to
the
staff
had
been
overtaken
by
the
*NL*
rain
,
entered
Rostov
's
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
from
the
staff
,
Count
.
Have
you
heard
of
Raevski
's
*NL*
exploit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
officer
gave
them
details
of
the
Saltanov
battle
,
which
he
had
*NL*
heard
at
the
staff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
smoking
his
pipe
and
turning
his
head
about
as
the
water
*NL*
trickled
down
his
neck
,
listened
inattentively
,
with
an
occasional
*NL*
glance
at
Ilyin
,
who
was
pressing
close
to
him
.
This
officer
,
a
lad
of
*NL*
sixteen
who
had
recently
joined
the
regiment
,
was
now
in
the
same
*NL*
relation
to
Nicholas
that
Nicholas
had
been
to
Denisov
seven
years
*NL*
before
.
Ilyin
tried
to
imitate
Rostov
in
everything
and
adored
him
as
a
*NL*
girl
might
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zdrzhinski
,
the
officer
with
the
long
mustache
,
spoke
grandiloquently
of
*NL*
the
Saltanov
dam
being
``
a
Russian
Thermopylae
,
''
and
of
how
a
deed
worthy
*NL*
of
antiquity
had
been
performed
by
General
Raevski
.
He
recounted
how
*NL*
Raevski
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
under
terrific
fire
and
had
*NL*
charged
with
them
beside
him
.
Rostov
heard
the
story
and
not
only
said
*NL*
nothing
to
encourage
Zdrzhinski
's
enthusiasm
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
looked
like
a
man
ashamed
of
what
he
was
hearing
,
though
with
no
*NL*
intention
of
contradicting
it
.
Since
the
campaigns
of
Austerlitz
and
of
*NL*
1807
Rostov
knew
by
experience
that
men
always
lie
when
describing
*NL*
military
exploits
,
as
he
himself
had
done
when
recounting
them
;
besides
*NL*
that
,
he
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
nothing
happens
in
war
at
*NL*
all
as
we
can
imagine
or
relate
it
.
And
so
he
did
not
like
Zdrzhinski
's
*NL*
tale
,
nor
did
he
like
Zdrzhinski
himself
who
,
with
his
mustaches
*NL*
extending
over
his
cheeks
,
bent
low
over
the
face
of
his
hearer
,
as
was
*NL*
his
habit
,
and
crowded
Rostov
in
the
narrow
shanty
.
Rostov
looked
at
him
*NL*
in
silence
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
there
must
have
been
such
a
confusion
*NL*
and
crowding
on
the
dam
that
was
being
attacked
that
if
Raevski
did
lead
*NL*
his
sons
there
,
it
could
have
had
no
effect
except
perhaps
on
some
dozen
*NL*
men
nearest
to
him
,
''
thought
he
,
``
the
rest
could
not
have
seen
how
or
*NL*
with
whom
Raevski
came
onto
the
dam
.
And
even
those
who
did
see
it
would
*NL*
not
have
been
much
stimulated
by
it
,
for
what
had
they
to
do
with
*NL*
Raevski
's
tender
paternal
feelings
when
their
own
skins
were
in
danger
?
*NL*
And
besides
,
the
fate
of
the
Fatherland
did
not
depend
on
whether
they
*NL*
took
the
Saltanov
dam
or
not
,
as
we
are
told
was
the
case
at
*NL*
Thermopylae
.
So
why
should
he
have
made
such
a
sacrifice
?
And
why
expose
*NL*
his
own
children
in
the
battle
?
I
would
not
have
taken
my
brother
Petya
*NL*
there
,
or
even
Ilyin
,
who
's
a
stranger
to
me
but
a
nice
lad
,
but
would
*NL*
have
tried
to
put
them
somewhere
under
cover
,
''
Nicholas
continued
to
*NL*
think
,
as
he
listened
to
Zdrzhinski
.
But
he
did
not
express
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
for
in
such
matters
,
too
,
he
had
gained
experience
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
this
tale
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
so
one
had
to
*NL*
pretend
not
to
doubt
it
.
And
he
acted
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
this
any
more
,
''
said
Ilyin
,
noticing
that
Rostov
did
not
*NL*
relish
Zdrzhinski
's
conversation
.
``
My
stockings
and
shirt
...
and
the
*NL*
water
is
running
on
my
seat
!
I
'll
go
and
look
for
shelter
.
The
rain
*NL*
seems
less
heavy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ilyin
went
out
and
Zdrzhinski
rode
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
Ilyin
,
splashing
through
the
mud
,
came
running
back
*NL*
to
the
shanty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
Rostov
,
come
quick
!
I
've
found
it
!
About
two
hundred
yards
away
*NL*
there
's
a
tavern
where
ours
have
already
gathered
.
We
can
at
least
get
*NL*
dry
there
,
and
Mary
Hendrikhovna
's
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Hendrikhovna
was
the
wife
of
the
regimental
doctor
,
a
pretty
young
*NL*
German
woman
he
had
married
in
Poland
.
The
doctor
,
whether
from
lack
of
*NL*
means
or
because
he
did
not
like
to
part
from
his
young
wife
in
the
*NL*
early
days
of
their
marriage
,
took
her
about
with
him
wherever
the
*NL*
hussar
regiment
went
and
his
jealousy
had
become
a
standing
joke
among
*NL*
the
hussar
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
threw
his
cloak
over
his
shoulders
,
shouted
to
Lavrushka
to
*NL*
follow
with
the
things
,
and
--
now
slipping
in
the
mud
,
now
splashing
*NL*
right
through
it
--
set
off
with
Ilyin
in
the
lessening
rain
and
the
*NL*
darkness
that
was
occasionally
rent
by
distant
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rostov
,
where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

What
lightning
!

they
called
to
one
another

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tavern
,
before
which
stood
the
doctor
's
covered
cart
,
there
were
*NL*
already
some
five
officers
.
Mary
Hendrikhovna
,
a
plump
little
blonde
*NL*
German
,
in
a
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
,
was
sitting
on
a
broad
bench
*NL*
in
the
front
corner
.
Her
husband
,
the
doctor
,
lay
asleep
behind
her
.
*NL*
Rostov
and
Ilyin
,
on
entering
the
room
,
were
welcomed
with
merry
shouts
*NL*
and
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
how
jolly
we
are
!
''
said
Rostov
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
do
you
stand
there
gaping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
swells
they
are
!
Why
,
the
water
streams
from
them
!
Do
n't
make
our
*NL*
drawing
room
so
wet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mess
Mary
Hendrikhovna
's
dress
!
''
cried
other
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
and
Ilyin
hastened
to
find
a
corner
where
they
could
change
into
*NL*
dry
clothes
without
offending
Mary
Hendrikhovna
's
modesty
.
They
were
*NL*
going
into
a
tiny
recess
behind
a
partition
to
change
,
but
found
it
*NL*
completely
filled
by
three
officers
who
sat
playing
cards
by
the
light
*NL*
of
a
solitary
candle
on
an
empty
box
,
and
these
officers
would
on
no
*NL*
account
yield
their
position
.
Mary
Hendrikhovna
obliged
them
with
the
*NL*
loan
of
a
petticoat
to
be
used
as
a
curtain
,
and
behind
that
screen
*NL*
Rostov
and
Ilyin
,
helped
by
Lavrushka
who
had
brought
their
kits
,
*NL*
changed
their
wet
things
for
dry
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fire
was
made
up
in
the
dilapidated
brick
stove
.
A
board
was
found
,
*NL*
fixed
on
two
saddles
and
covered
with
a
horsecloth
,
a
small
samovar
was
*NL*
produced
and
a
cellaret
and
half
a
bottle
of
rum
,
and
having
asked
Mary
*NL*
Hendrikhovna
to
preside
,
they
all
crowded
round
her
.
One
offered
her
a
*NL*
clean
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
charming
hands
,
another
spread
a
jacket
*NL*
under
her
little
feet
to
keep
them
from
the
damp
,
another
hung
his
coat
*NL*
over
the
window
to
keep
out
the
draft
,
and
yet
another
waved
the
flies
*NL*
off
her
husband
's
face
,
lest
he
should
wake
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
,
''
said
Mary
Hendrikhovna
,
smiling
timidly
and
happily
.
*NL*
``
He
is
sleeping
well
as
it
is
,
after
a
sleepless
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Mary
Hendrikhovna
,
''
replied
the
officer
,
``
one
must
look
after
*NL*
the
doctor
.
Perhaps
he
'll
take
pity
on
me
someday
,
when
it
comes
to
*NL*
cutting
off
a
leg
or
an
arm
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
three
tumblers
,
the
water
was
so
muddy
that
one
could
*NL*
not
make
out
whether
the
tea
was
strong
or
weak
,
and
the
samovar
held
*NL*
only
six
tumblers
of
water
,
but
this
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
to
take
*NL*
turns
in
order
of
seniority
to
receive
one
's
tumbler
from
Mary
*NL*
Hendrikhovna
's
plump
little
hands
with
their
short
and
not
overclean
*NL*
nails
.
All
the
officers
appeared
to
be
,
and
really
were
,
in
love
with
*NL*
her
that
evening
.
Even
those
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
*NL*
left
their
game
and
came
over
to
the
samovar
,
yielding
to
the
general
*NL*
mood
of
courting
Mary
Hendrikhovna
.
She
,
seeing
herself
surrounded
by
*NL*
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
men
,
beamed
with
satisfaction
,
try
as
*NL*
she
might
to
hide
it
,
and
perturbed
as
she
evidently
was
each
time
her
*NL*
husband
moved
in
his
sleep
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
spoon
,
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
else
,
*NL*
but
it
took
too
long
to
dissolve
,
so
it
was
decided
that
Mary
*NL*
Hendrikhovna
should
stir
the
sugar
for
everyone
in
turn
.
Rostov
received
*NL*
his
tumbler
,
and
adding
some
rum
to
it
asked
Mary
Hendrikhovna
to
stir
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
take
it
without
sugar
?
''
she
said
,
smiling
all
the
time
,
as
if
*NL*
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
amusing
and
*NL*
had
a
double
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
the
sugar
I
want
,
but
only
that
your
little
hand
should
stir
*NL*
my
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
Hendrikhovna
assented
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone
*NL*
meanwhile
had
pounced
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Use
your
finger
,
Mary
Hendrikhovna
,
it
will
be
still
nicer
,
''
said
*NL*
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
hot
!
''
she
replied
,
blushing
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ilyin
put
a
few
drops
of
rum
into
the
bucket
of
water
and
brought
it
to
*NL*
Mary
Hendrikhovna
,
asking
her
to
stir
it
with
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
cup
,
''
said
he
.
``
Only
dip
your
finger
in
it
and
I
'll
drink
it
*NL*
all
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
emptied
the
samovar
,
Rostov
took
a
pack
of
cards
and
*NL*
proposed
that
they
should
play
``
Kings
''
with
Mary
Hendrikhovna
.
They
drew
*NL*
lots
to
settle
who
should
make
up
her
set
.
At
Rostov
's
suggestion
it
was
*NL*
agreed
that
whoever
became
``
King
''
should
have
the
right
to
kiss
Mary
*NL*
Hendrikhovna
's
hand
,
and
that
the
``
Booby
''
should
go
to
refill
and
reheat
*NL*
the
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
the
latter
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
supposing
Mary
Hendrikhovna
is
`
King
'
?
''
asked
Ilyin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
it
is
,
she
is
Queen
,
and
her
word
is
law
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
hardly
begun
to
play
before
the
doctor
's
disheveled
head
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
Mary
Hendrikhovna
.
He
had
been
awake
for
*NL*
some
time
,
listening
to
what
was
being
said
,
and
evidently
found
nothing
*NL*
entertaining
or
amusing
in
what
was
going
on
.
His
face
was
sad
and
*NL*
depressed
.
Without
greeting
the
officers
,
he
scratched
himself
and
asked
*NL*
to
be
allowed
to
pass
as
they
were
blocking
the
way
.
As
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
left
the
room
all
the
officers
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
Mary
*NL*
Hendrikhovna
blushed
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thereby
became
*NL*
still
more
attractive
to
them
.
Returning
from
the
yard
,
the
doctor
told
*NL*
his
wife
-LRB-
who
had
ceased
to
smile
so
happily
,
and
looked
at
him
in
*NL*
alarm
,
awaiting
her
sentence
-RRB-
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
they
must
go
*NL*
to
sleep
in
their
covered
cart
,
or
everything
in
it
would
be
stolen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
send
an
orderly
...
Two
of
them
!
''
said
Rostov
.
``
What
an
idea
,
*NL*
doctor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stand
guard
on
it
myself
!
''
said
Ilyin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
gentlemen
,
you
have
had
your
sleep
,
but
I
have
not
slept
for
two
*NL*
nights
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
and
he
sat
down
morosely
beside
his
wife
,
*NL*
waiting
for
the
game
to
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
his
gloomy
face
as
he
frowned
at
his
wife
,
the
officers
grew
*NL*
still
merrier
,
and
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
laughter
,
for
*NL*
which
they
hurriedly
sought
plausible
pretexts
.
When
he
had
gone
,
taking
*NL*
his
wife
with
him
,
and
had
settled
down
with
her
in
their
covered
cart
,
*NL*
the
officers
lay
down
in
the
tavern
,
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
*NL*
cloaks
,
but
they
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
;
now
they
exchanged
*NL*
remarks
,
recalling
the
doctor
's
uneasiness
and
his
wife
's
delight
,
now
*NL*
they
ran
out
into
the
porch
and
reported
what
was
taking
place
in
the
*NL*
covered
trap
.
Several
times
Rostov
,
covering
his
head
,
tried
to
go
to
*NL*
sleep
,
but
some
remark
would
arouse
him
and
conversation
would
be
*NL*
resumed
,
to
the
accompaniment
of
unreasoning
,
merry
,
childlike
laughter
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
three
o'clock
but
no
one
was
yet
asleep
,
when
the
*NL*
quartermaster
appeared
with
an
order
to
move
on
to
the
little
town
of
*NL*
Ostrovna
.
Still
laughing
and
talking
,
the
officers
began
hurriedly
*NL*
getting
ready
and
again
boiled
some
muddy
water
in
the
samovar
.
But
*NL*
Rostov
went
off
to
his
squadron
without
waiting
for
tea
.
Day
was
*NL*
breaking
,
the
rain
had
ceased
,
and
the
clouds
were
dispersing
.
It
felt
*NL*
damp
and
cold
,
especially
in
clothes
that
were
still
moist
.
As
they
left
*NL*
the
tavern
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn
,
Rostov
and
Ilyin
both
glanced
*NL*
under
the
wet
and
glistening
leather
hood
of
the
doctor
's
cart
,
from
*NL*
under
the
apron
of
which
his
feet
were
sticking
out
,
and
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
which
his
wife
's
nightcap
was
visible
and
her
sleepy
breathing
*NL*
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
really
is
a
dear
little
thing
,
''
said
Rostov
to
Ilyin
,
who
was
*NL*
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
charming
woman
!
''
said
Ilyin
,
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
boy
of
*NL*
sixteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
the
squadron
was
lined
up
on
the
road
.
The
command
*NL*
was
heard
to
``
mount
''
and
the
soldiers
crossed
themselves
and
mounted
.
*NL*
Rostov
riding
in
front
gave
the
order
``
Forward
!
''
and
the
hussars
,
with
*NL*
clanking
sabers
and
subdued
talk
,
their
horses
'
hoofs
splashing
in
the
*NL*
mud
,
defiled
in
fours
and
moved
along
the
broad
road
planted
with
birch
*NL*
trees
on
each
side
,
following
the
infantry
and
a
battery
that
had
gone
*NL*
on
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tattered
,
blue-purple
clouds
,
reddening
in
the
east
,
were
scudding
*NL*
before
the
wind
.
It
was
growing
lighter
and
lighter
.
That
curly
grass
*NL*
which
always
grows
by
country
roadsides
became
clearly
visible
,
still
*NL*
wet
with
the
night
's
rain
;
the
drooping
branches
of
the
birches
,
also
*NL*
wet
,
swayed
in
the
wind
and
flung
down
bright
drops
of
water
to
one
*NL*
side
.
The
soldiers
'
faces
were
more
and
more
clearly
visible
.
Rostov
,
*NL*
always
closely
followed
by
Ilyin
,
rode
along
the
side
of
the
road
*NL*
between
two
rows
of
birch
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
campaigning
,
Rostov
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
riding
not
a
*NL*
regimental
but
a
Cossack
horse
.
A
judge
of
horses
and
a
sportsman
,
he
*NL*
had
lately
procured
himself
a
large
,
fine
,
mettlesome
,
Donets
horse
,
*NL*
dun-colored
,
with
light
mane
and
tail
,
and
when
he
rode
it
no
one
could
*NL*
outgallop
him
.
To
ride
this
horse
was
a
pleasure
to
him
,
and
he
thought
*NL*
of
the
horse
,
of
the
morning
,
of
the
doctor
's
wife
,
but
not
once
of
the
*NL*
impending
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Formerly
,
when
going
into
action
,
Rostov
had
felt
afraid
;
now
he
had
not
*NL*
the
least
feeling
of
fear
.
He
was
fearless
,
not
because
he
had
grown
*NL*
used
to
being
under
fire
-LRB-
one
can
not
grow
used
to
danger
-RRB-
,
but
because
*NL*
he
had
learned
how
to
manage
his
thoughts
when
in
danger
.
He
had
grown
*NL*
accustomed
when
going
into
action
to
think
about
anything
but
what
would
*NL*
seem
most
likely
to
interest
him
--
the
impending
danger
.
During
the
first
*NL*
period
of
his
service
,
hard
as
he
tried
and
much
as
he
reproached
*NL*
himself
with
cowardice
,
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
this
,
but
with
time
*NL*
it
had
come
of
itself
.
Now
he
rode
beside
Ilyin
under
the
birch
trees
,
*NL*
occasionally
plucking
leaves
from
a
branch
that
met
his
hand
,
sometimes
*NL*
touching
his
horse
's
side
with
his
foot
,
or
,
without
turning
round
,
*NL*
handing
a
pipe
he
had
finished
to
an
hussar
riding
behind
him
,
with
as
*NL*
calm
and
careless
an
air
as
though
he
were
merely
out
for
a
ride
.
He
*NL*
glanced
with
pity
at
the
excited
face
of
Ilyin
,
who
talked
much
and
in
*NL*
great
agitation
.
He
knew
from
experience
the
tormenting
expectation
of
*NL*
terror
and
death
the
cornet
was
suffering
and
knew
that
only
time
could
*NL*
help
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
sun
appeared
in
a
clear
strip
of
sky
beneath
the
clouds
,
*NL*
the
wind
fell
,
as
if
it
dared
not
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
summer
morning
*NL*
after
the
storm
;
drops
still
continued
to
fall
,
but
vertically
now
,
and
*NL*
all
was
still
.
The
whole
sun
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
disappeared
*NL*
behind
a
long
narrow
cloud
that
hung
above
it
.
A
few
minutes
later
it
*NL*
reappeared
brighter
still
from
behind
the
top
of
the
cloud
,
tearing
its
*NL*
edge
.
Everything
grew
bright
and
glittered
.
And
with
that
light
,
and
as
*NL*
if
in
reply
to
it
,
came
the
sound
of
guns
ahead
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Rostov
had
had
time
to
consider
and
determine
the
distance
of
*NL*
that
firing
,
Count
Ostermann-Tolstoy
's
adjutant
came
galloping
from
*NL*
Vitebsk
with
orders
to
advance
at
a
trot
along
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squadron
overtook
and
passed
the
infantry
and
the
battery
--
which
had
*NL*
also
quickened
their
pace
--
rode
down
a
hill
,
and
passing
through
an
*NL*
empty
and
deserted
village
again
ascended
.
The
horses
began
to
lather
*NL*
and
the
men
to
flush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halt
!

the
order
of
the
regimental
commander
was
*NL*
heard
ahead
.
``
Forward
by
the
left
.
Walk
,
march
!
''
came
the
order
from
in
*NL*
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
hussars
,
passing
along
the
line
of
troops
on
the
left
flank
of
*NL*
our
position
,
halted
behind
our
uhlans
who
were
in
the
front
line
.
To
*NL*
the
right
stood
our
infantry
in
a
dense
column
:
they
were
the
reserve
.
*NL*
Higher
up
the
hill
,
on
the
very
horizon
,
our
guns
were
visible
through
*NL*
the
wonderfully
clear
air
,
brightly
illuminated
by
slanting
morning
*NL*
sunbeams
.
In
front
,
beyond
a
hollow
dale
,
could
be
seen
the
enemy
's
*NL*
columns
and
guns
.
Our
advanced
line
,
already
in
action
,
could
be
heard
*NL*
briskly
exchanging
shots
with
the
enemy
in
the
dale
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
sounds
,
long
unheard
,
Rostov
's
spirits
rose
,
as
at
the
strains
*NL*
of
the
merriest
music
.
Trap-ta-ta-tap
!
cracked
the
shots
,
now
together
,
*NL*
now
several
quickly
one
after
another
.
Again
all
was
silent
and
then
*NL*
again
it
sounded
as
if
someone
were
walking
on
detonators
and
exploding
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussars
remained
in
the
same
place
for
about
an
hour
.
A
cannonade
*NL*
began
.
Count
Ostermann
with
his
suite
rode
up
behind
the
squadron
,
*NL*
halted
,
spoke
to
the
commander
of
the
regiment
,
and
rode
up
the
hill
to
*NL*
the
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Ostermann
had
gone
,
a
command
rang
out
to
the
uhlans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Form
column
!
Prepare
to
charge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
infantry
in
front
of
them
parted
into
platoons
to
allow
the
cavalry
*NL*
to
pass
.
The
uhlans
started
,
the
streamers
on
their
spears
fluttering
,
*NL*
and
trotted
downhill
toward
the
French
cavalry
which
was
seen
below
to
*NL*
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
uhlans
descended
the
hill
,
the
hussars
were
ordered
up
*NL*
the
hill
to
support
the
battery
.
As
they
took
the
places
vacated
by
the
*NL*
uhlans
,
bullets
came
from
the
front
,
whining
and
whistling
,
but
fell
*NL*
spent
without
taking
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
,
which
he
had
not
heard
for
so
long
,
had
an
even
more
*NL*
pleasurable
and
exhilarating
effect
on
Rostov
than
the
previous
sounds
*NL*
of
firing
.
Drawing
himself
up
,
he
viewed
the
field
of
battle
opening
out
*NL*
before
him
from
the
hill
,
and
with
his
whole
soul
followed
the
movement
*NL*
of
the
uhlans
.
They
swooped
down
close
to
the
French
dragoons
,
something
*NL*
confused
happened
there
amid
the
smoke
,
and
five
minutes
later
our
*NL*
uhlans
were
galloping
back
,
not
to
the
place
they
had
occupied
but
more
*NL*
to
the
left
,
and
among
the
orange-colored
uhlans
on
chestnut
horses
and
*NL*
behind
them
,
in
a
large
group
,
blue
French
dragoons
on
gray
horses
could
*NL*
be
seen
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
with
his
keen
sportsman
's
eye
,
was
one
of
the
first
to
catch
*NL*
sight
of
these
blue
French
dragoons
pursuing
our
uhlans
.
Nearer
and
*NL*
nearer
in
disorderly
crowds
came
the
uhlans
and
the
French
dragoons
*NL*
pursuing
them
.
He
could
already
see
how
these
men
,
who
looked
so
small
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
jostled
and
overtook
one
another
,
waving
their
*NL*
arms
and
their
sabers
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
gazed
at
what
was
happening
before
him
as
at
a
hunt
.
He
felt
*NL*
instinctively
that
if
the
hussars
struck
at
the
French
dragoons
now
,
the
*NL*
latter
could
not
withstand
them
,
but
if
a
charge
was
to
be
made
it
must
*NL*
be
done
now
,
at
that
very
moment
,
or
it
would
be
too
late
.
He
looked
*NL*
around
.
A
captain
,
standing
beside
him
,
was
gazing
like
himself
with
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
cavalry
below
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
Sevastyanych
!
''
said
Rostov
.
``
You
know
,
we
could
crush
them
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
thing
too
!
''
replied
the
captain
,
``
and
really
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
without
waiting
to
hear
him
out
,
touched
his
horse
,
galloped
to
*NL*
the
front
of
his
squadron
,
and
before
he
had
time
to
finish
giving
the
*NL*
word
of
command
,
the
whole
squadron
,
sharing
his
feeling
,
was
following
*NL*
him
.
Rostov
himself
did
not
know
how
or
why
he
did
it
.
He
acted
as
he
*NL*
did
when
hunting
,
without
reflecting
or
considering
.
He
saw
the
dragoons
*NL*
near
and
that
they
were
galloping
in
disorder
;
he
knew
they
could
not
*NL*
withstand
an
attack
--
knew
there
was
only
that
moment
and
that
if
he
let
*NL*
it
slip
it
would
not
return
.
The
bullets
were
whining
and
whistling
so
*NL*
stimulatingly
around
him
and
his
horse
was
so
eager
to
go
that
he
could
*NL*
not
restrain
himself
.
He
touched
his
horse
,
gave
the
word
of
command
,
*NL*
and
immediately
,
hearing
behind
him
the
tramp
of
the
horses
of
his
*NL*
deployed
squadron
,
rode
at
full
trot
downhill
toward
the
dragoons
.
*NL*
Hardly
had
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
before
their
pace
*NL*
instinctively
changed
to
a
gallop
,
which
grew
faster
and
faster
as
they
*NL*
drew
nearer
to
our
uhlans
and
the
French
dragoons
who
galloped
after
*NL*
them
.
The
dragoons
were
now
close
at
hand
.
On
seeing
the
hussars
,
the
*NL*
foremost
began
to
turn
,
while
those
behind
began
to
halt
.
With
the
same
*NL*
feeling
with
which
he
had
galloped
across
the
path
of
a
wolf
,
Rostov
*NL*
gave
rein
to
his
Donets
horse
and
galloped
to
intersect
the
path
of
the
*NL*
dragoons
'
disordered
lines
.
One
Uhlan
stopped
,
another
who
was
on
foot
*NL*
flung
himself
to
the
ground
to
avoid
being
knocked
over
,
and
a
riderless
*NL*
horse
fell
in
among
the
hussars
.
Nearly
all
the
French
dragoons
were
*NL*
galloping
back
.
Rostov
,
picking
out
one
on
a
gray
horse
,
dashed
after
*NL*
him
.
On
the
way
he
came
upon
a
bush
,
his
gallant
horse
cleared
it
,
and
*NL*
almost
before
he
had
righted
himself
in
his
saddle
he
saw
that
he
would
*NL*
immediately
overtake
the
enemy
he
had
selected
.
That
Frenchman
,
by
his
*NL*
uniform
an
officer
,
was
going
at
a
gallop
,
crouching
on
his
gray
horse
*NL*
and
urging
it
on
with
his
saber
.
In
another
moment
Rostov
's
horse
dashed
*NL*
its
breast
against
the
hindquarters
of
the
officer
's
horse
,
almost
*NL*
knocking
it
over
,
and
at
the
same
instant
Rostov
,
without
knowing
why
,
*NL*
raised
his
saber
and
struck
the
Frenchman
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
he
had
done
this
,
all
Rostov
's
animation
vanished
.
The
*NL*
officer
fell
,
not
so
much
from
the
blow
--
which
had
but
slightly
cut
his
*NL*
arm
above
the
elbow
--
as
from
the
shock
to
his
horse
and
from
fright
.
*NL*
Rostov
reined
in
his
horse
,
and
his
eyes
sought
his
foe
to
see
whom
he
*NL*
had
vanquished
.
The
French
dragoon
officer
was
hopping
with
one
foot
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
the
other
being
caught
in
the
stirrup
.
His
eyes
,
screwed
up
*NL*
with
fear
as
if
he
every
moment
expected
another
blow
,
gazed
up
at
*NL*
Rostov
with
shrinking
terror
.
His
pale
and
mud-stained
face
--
fair
and
*NL*
young
,
with
a
dimple
in
the
chin
and
light-blue
eyes
--
was
not
an
enemy
's
*NL*
face
at
all
suited
to
a
battlefield
,
but
a
most
ordinary
,
homelike
face
.
*NL*
Before
Rostov
had
decided
what
to
do
with
him
,
the
officer
cried
,
``
I
*NL*
surrender
!
''
He
hurriedly
but
vainly
tried
to
get
his
foot
out
of
the
*NL*
stirrup
and
did
not
remove
his
frightened
blue
eyes
from
Rostov
's
face
.
*NL*
Some
hussars
who
galloped
up
disengaged
his
foot
and
helped
him
into
the
*NL*
saddle
.
On
all
sides
,
the
hussars
were
busy
with
the
dragoons
;
one
was
*NL*
wounded
,
but
though
his
face
was
bleeding
,
he
would
not
give
up
his
*NL*
horse
;
another
was
perched
up
behind
an
hussar
with
his
arms
round
him
;
*NL*
a
third
was
being
helped
by
an
hussar
to
mount
his
horse
.
In
front
,
the
*NL*
French
infantry
were
firing
as
they
ran
.
The
hussars
galloped
hastily
*NL*
back
with
their
prisoners
.
Rostov
galloped
back
with
the
rest
,
aware
of
*NL*
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
depression
in
his
heart
.
Something
vague
and
*NL*
confused
,
which
he
could
not
at
all
account
for
,
had
come
over
him
with
*NL*
the
capture
of
that
officer
and
the
blow
he
had
dealt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Ostermann-Tolstoy
met
the
returning
hussars
,
sent
for
Rostov
,
*NL*
thanked
him
,
and
said
he
would
report
his
gallant
deed
to
the
Emperor
*NL*
and
would
recommend
him
for
a
St.
George
's
Cross
.
When
sent
for
by
Count
*NL*
Ostermann
,
Rostov
,
remembering
that
he
had
charged
without
orders
,
felt
*NL*
sure
his
commander
was
sending
for
him
to
punish
him
for
breach
of
*NL*
discipline
.
Ostermann
's
flattering
words
and
promise
of
a
reward
should
*NL*
therefore
have
struck
him
all
the
more
pleasantly
,
but
he
still
felt
*NL*
that
same
vaguely
disagreeable
feeling
of
moral
nausea
.
``
But
what
on
*NL*
earth
is
worrying
me
?
''
he
asked
himself
as
he
rode
back
from
the
*NL*
general
.
``
Ilyin
?
No
,
he
's
safe
.
Have
I
disgraced
myself
in
any
way
?
No
,
*NL*
that
's
not
it
.
''
Something
else
,
resembling
remorse
,
tormented
him
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
oh
yes
,
that
French
officer
with
the
dimple
.
And
I
remember
how
my
arm
*NL*
paused
when
I
raised
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
saw
the
prisoners
being
led
away
and
galloped
after
them
to
have
*NL*
a
look
at
his
Frenchman
with
the
dimple
on
his
chin
.
He
was
sitting
in
*NL*
his
foreign
uniform
on
an
hussar
packhorse
and
looked
anxiously
about
*NL*
him
;
The
sword
cut
on
his
arm
could
scarcely
be
called
a
wound
.
He
*NL*
glanced
at
Rostov
with
a
feigned
smile
and
waved
his
hand
in
greeting
.
*NL*
Rostov
still
had
the
same
indefinite
feeling
,
as
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
and
the
next
his
friends
and
comrades
noticed
that
Rostov
,
*NL*
without
being
dull
or
angry
,
was
silent
,
thoughtful
,
and
preoccupied
.
He
*NL*
drank
reluctantly
,
tried
to
remain
alone
,
and
kept
turning
something
*NL*
over
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
was
always
thinking
about
that
brilliant
exploit
of
his
,
which
to
*NL*
his
amazement
had
gained
him
the
St.
George
's
Cross
and
even
given
him
a
*NL*
reputation
for
bravery
,
and
there
was
something
he
could
not
at
all
*NL*
understand
.
``
So
others
are
even
more
afraid
than
I
am
!
''
he
thought
.
``
So
*NL*
that
's
all
there
is
in
what
is
called
heroism
!
And
did
I
do
it
for
my
*NL*
country
's
sake
?
And
how
was
he
to
blame
,
with
his
dimple
and
blue
eyes
?
*NL*
And
how
frightened
he
was
!
He
thought
that
I
should
kill
him
.
Why
should
*NL*
I
kill
him
?
My
hand
trembled
.
And
they
have
given
me
a
St.
George
's
*NL*
Cross
...
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
Nicholas
was
considering
these
questions
and
still
could
reach
*NL*
no
clear
solution
of
what
puzzled
him
so
,
the
wheel
of
fortune
in
the
*NL*
service
,
as
often
happens
,
turned
in
his
favor
.
After
the
affair
at
*NL*
Ostrovna
he
was
brought
into
notice
,
received
command
of
an
hussar
*NL*
battalion
,
and
when
a
brave
officer
was
needed
he
was
chosen
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
On
receiving
news
of
Natasha
's
illness
,
the
countess
,
though
not
quite
*NL*
well
yet
and
still
weak
,
went
to
Moscow
with
Petya
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
household
,
and
the
whole
family
moved
from
Marya
Dmitrievna
's
house
to
*NL*
their
own
and
settled
down
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
illness
was
so
serious
that
,
fortunately
for
her
and
for
her
*NL*
parents
,
the
consideration
of
all
that
had
caused
the
illness
,
her
*NL*
conduct
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
,
receded
into
the
*NL*
background
.
She
was
so
ill
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
consider
*NL*
in
how
far
she
was
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
.
She
could
not
eat
or
*NL*
sleep
,
grew
visibly
thinner
,
coughed
,
and
,
as
the
doctors
made
them
*NL*
feel
,
was
in
danger
.
They
could
not
think
of
anything
but
how
to
help
*NL*
her
.
Doctors
came
to
see
her
singly
and
in
consultation
,
talked
much
in
*NL*
French
,
German
,
and
Latin
,
blamed
one
another
,
and
prescribed
a
great
*NL*
variety
of
medicines
for
all
the
diseases
known
to
them
,
but
the
simple
*NL*
idea
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
that
they
could
not
know
the
disease
*NL*
Natasha
was
suffering
from
,
as
no
disease
suffered
by
a
live
man
can
be
*NL*
known
,
for
every
living
person
has
his
own
peculiarities
and
always
has
*NL*
his
own
peculiar
,
personal
,
novel
,
complicated
disease
,
unknown
to
*NL*
medicine
--
not
a
disease
of
the
lungs
,
liver
,
skin
,
heart
,
nerves
,
and
so
*NL*
on
mentioned
in
medical
books
,
but
a
disease
consisting
of
one
of
the
*NL*
innumerable
combinations
of
the
maladies
of
those
organs
.
This
simple
*NL*
thought
could
not
occur
to
the
doctors
-LRB-
as
it
can
not
occur
to
a
wizard
*NL*
that
he
is
unable
to
work
his
charms
-RRB-
because
the
business
of
their
*NL*
lives
was
to
cure
,
and
they
received
money
for
it
and
had
spent
the
best
*NL*
years
of
their
lives
on
that
business
.
But
,
above
all
,
that
thought
was
*NL*
kept
out
of
their
minds
by
the
fact
that
they
saw
they
were
really
*NL*
useful
,
as
in
fact
they
were
to
the
whole
Rostov
family
.
Their
*NL*
usefulness
did
not
depend
on
making
the
patient
swallow
substances
for
*NL*
the
most
part
harmful
-LRB-
the
harm
was
scarcely
perceptible
,
as
they
were
*NL*
given
in
small
doses
-RRB-
,
but
they
were
useful
,
necessary
,
and
*NL*
indispensable
because
they
satisfied
a
mental
need
of
the
invalid
and
of
*NL*
those
who
loved
her
--
and
that
is
why
there
are
,
and
always
will
be
,
*NL*
pseudo-healers
,
wise
women
,
homeopaths
,
and
allopaths
.
They
satisfied
*NL*
that
eternal
human
need
for
hope
of
relief
,
for
sympathy
,
and
that
*NL*
something
should
be
done
,
which
is
felt
by
those
who
are
suffering
.
They
*NL*
satisfied
the
need
seen
in
its
most
elementary
form
in
a
child
,
when
it
*NL*
wants
to
have
a
place
rubbed
that
has
been
hurt
.
A
child
knocks
itself
*NL*
and
runs
at
once
to
the
arms
of
its
mother
or
nurse
to
have
the
aching
*NL*
spot
rubbed
or
kissed
,
and
it
feels
better
when
this
is
done
.
The
child
*NL*
can
not
believe
that
the
strongest
and
wisest
of
its
people
have
no
*NL*
remedy
for
its
pain
,
and
the
hope
of
relief
and
the
expression
of
its
*NL*
mother
's
sympathy
while
she
rubs
the
bump
comforts
it
.
The
doctors
were
*NL*
of
use
to
Natasha
because
they
kissed
and
rubbed
her
bump
,
assuring
her
*NL*
that
it
would
soon
pass
if
only
the
coachman
went
to
the
chemist
's
in
*NL*
the
Arbat
and
got
a
powder
and
some
pills
in
a
pretty
box
for
a
ruble
*NL*
and
seventy
kopeks
,
and
if
she
took
those
powders
in
boiled
water
at
*NL*
intervals
of
precisely
two
hours
,
neither
more
nor
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
Sonya
and
the
count
and
countess
have
done
,
how
would
they
*NL*
have
looked
,
if
nothing
had
been
done
,
if
there
had
not
been
those
pills
*NL*
to
give
by
the
clock
,
the
warm
drinks
,
the
chicken
cutlets
,
and
all
the
*NL*
other
details
of
life
ordered
by
the
doctors
,
the
carrying
out
of
which
*NL*
supplied
an
occupation
and
consolation
to
the
family
circle
?
How
would
*NL*
the
count
have
borne
his
dearly
loved
daughter
's
illness
had
he
not
*NL*
known
that
it
was
costing
him
a
thousand
rubles
,
and
that
he
would
not
*NL*
grudge
thousands
more
to
benefit
her
,
or
had
he
not
known
that
if
her
*NL*
illness
continued
he
would
not
grudge
yet
other
thousands
and
would
take
*NL*
her
abroad
for
consultations
there
,
and
had
he
not
been
able
to
explain
*NL*
the
details
of
how
Metivier
and
Feller
had
not
understood
the
symptoms
,
*NL*
but
Frise
had
,
and
Mudrov
had
diagnosed
them
even
better
?
What
would
the
*NL*
countess
have
done
had
she
not
been
able
sometimes
to
scold
the
invalid
*NL*
for
not
strictly
obeying
the
doctor
's
orders
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
never
get
well
like
that
,
''
she
would
say
,
forgetting
her
grief
*NL*
in
her
vexation
,
``
if
you
wo
n't
obey
the
doctor
and
take
your
medicine
at
*NL*
the
right
time
!
You
must
n't
trifle
with
it
,
you
know
,
or
it
may
turn
to
*NL*
pneumonia
,
''
she
would
go
on
,
deriving
much
comfort
from
the
utterance
of
*NL*
that
foreign
word
,
incomprehensible
to
others
as
well
as
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
Sonya
have
done
without
the
glad
consciousness
that
she
had
*NL*
not
undressed
during
the
first
three
nights
,
in
order
to
be
ready
to
*NL*
carry
out
all
the
doctor
's
injunctions
with
precision
,
and
that
she
*NL*
still
kept
awake
at
night
so
as
not
to
miss
the
proper
time
when
the
*NL*
slightly
harmful
pills
in
the
little
gilt
box
had
to
be
administered
?
*NL*
Even
to
Natasha
herself
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
so
many
sacrifices
*NL*
were
being
made
for
her
sake
,
and
to
know
that
she
had
to
take
medicine
*NL*
at
certain
hours
,
though
she
declared
that
no
medicine
would
cure
her
*NL*
and
that
it
was
all
nonsense
.
And
it
was
even
pleasant
to
be
able
to
*NL*
show
,
by
disregarding
the
orders
,
that
she
did
not
believe
in
medical
*NL*
treatment
and
did
not
value
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
every
day
,
felt
her
pulse
,
looked
at
her
tongue
,
and
*NL*
regardless
of
her
grief-stricken
face
joked
with
her
.
But
when
he
had
*NL*
gone
into
another
room
,
to
which
the
countess
hurriedly
followed
him
,
he
*NL*
assumed
a
grave
air
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
said
that
though
*NL*
there
was
danger
,
he
had
hopes
of
the
effect
of
this
last
medicine
and
*NL*
one
must
wait
and
see
,
that
the
malady
was
chiefly
mental
,
but
...
And
*NL*
the
countess
,
trying
to
conceal
the
action
from
herself
and
from
him
,
*NL*
slipped
a
gold
coin
into
his
hand
and
always
returned
to
the
patient
*NL*
with
a
more
tranquil
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
symptoms
of
Natasha
's
illness
were
that
she
ate
little
,
slept
*NL*
little
,
coughed
,
and
was
always
low-spirited
.
The
doctors
said
that
she
*NL*
could
not
get
on
without
medical
treatment
,
so
they
kept
her
in
the
*NL*
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
town
,
and
the
Rostovs
did
not
move
to
the
*NL*
country
that
summer
of
1812
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
many
pills
she
swallowed
and
the
drops
and
powders
out
*NL*
of
the
little
bottles
and
boxes
of
which
Madame
Schoss
who
was
fond
of
*NL*
such
things
made
a
large
collection
,
and
in
spite
of
being
deprived
of
*NL*
the
country
life
to
which
she
was
accustomed
,
youth
prevailed
.
Natasha
's
*NL*
grief
began
to
be
overlaid
by
the
impressions
of
daily
life
,
it
ceased
*NL*
to
press
so
painfully
on
her
heart
,
it
gradually
faded
into
the
past
,
*NL*
and
she
began
to
recover
physically
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
calmer
but
no
happier
.
She
not
merely
avoided
all
external
*NL*
forms
of
pleasure
--
balls
,
promenades
,
concerts
,
and
theaters
--
but
she
*NL*
never
laughed
without
a
sound
of
tears
in
her
laughter
.
She
could
not
*NL*
sing
.
As
soon
as
she
began
to
laugh
,
or
tried
to
sing
by
herself
,
tears
*NL*
choked
her
:
tears
of
remorse
,
tears
at
the
recollection
of
those
pure
*NL*
times
which
could
never
return
,
tears
of
vexation
that
she
should
so
*NL*
uselessly
have
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
so
happy
.
*NL*
Laughter
and
singing
in
particular
seemed
to
her
like
a
blasphemy
,
in
*NL*
face
of
her
sorrow
.
Without
any
need
of
self-restraint
,
no
wish
to
*NL*
coquet
ever
entered
her
head
.
She
said
and
felt
at
that
time
that
no
man
*NL*
was
more
to
her
than
Nastasya
Ivanovna
,
the
buffoon
.
Something
stood
*NL*
sentinel
within
her
and
forbade
her
every
joy
.
Besides
,
she
had
lost
all
*NL*
the
old
interests
of
her
carefree
girlish
life
that
had
been
so
full
of
*NL*
hope
.
The
previous
autumn
,
the
hunting
,
``
Uncle
,
''
and
the
Christmas
*NL*
holidays
spent
with
Nicholas
at
Otradnoe
were
what
she
recalled
oftenest
*NL*
and
most
painfully
.
What
would
she
not
have
given
to
bring
back
even
a
*NL*
single
day
of
that
time
!
But
it
was
gone
forever
.
Her
presentiment
at
*NL*
the
time
had
not
deceived
her
--
that
that
state
of
freedom
and
readiness
*NL*
for
any
enjoyment
would
not
return
again
.
Yet
it
was
necessary
to
live
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
comforted
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
not
better
as
she
had
formerly
*NL*
imagined
,
but
worse
,
much
worse
,
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
But
*NL*
this
was
not
enough
.
She
knew
that
,
and
asked
herself
,
``
What
next
?
''
But
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
come
.
There
was
no
joy
in
life
,
yet
life
was
*NL*
passing
.
Natasha
apparently
tried
not
to
be
a
burden
or
a
hindrance
to
*NL*
anyone
,
but
wanted
nothing
for
herself
.
She
kept
away
from
everyone
in
*NL*
the
house
and
felt
at
ease
only
with
her
brother
Petya
.
She
liked
to
be
*NL*
with
him
better
than
with
the
others
,
and
when
alone
with
him
she
*NL*
sometimes
laughed
.
She
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
of
those
who
came
*NL*
to
see
them
was
glad
to
see
only
one
person
,
Pierre
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
impossible
to
treat
her
with
more
delicacy
,
greater
care
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
more
seriously
than
did
Count
Bezukhov
.
Natasha
unconsciously
*NL*
felt
this
delicacy
and
so
found
great
pleasure
in
his
society
.
But
she
*NL*
was
not
even
grateful
to
him
for
it
;
nothing
good
on
Pierre
's
part
*NL*
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
effort
,
it
seemed
so
natural
for
him
to
be
kind
*NL*
to
everyone
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
kindness
.
Sometimes
Natasha
*NL*
noticed
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
on
his
part
in
her
presence
,
*NL*
especially
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
please
her
,
or
feared
that
*NL*
something
they
spoke
of
would
awaken
memories
distressing
to
her
.
She
*NL*
noticed
this
and
attributed
it
to
his
general
kindness
and
shyness
,
*NL*
which
she
imagined
must
be
the
same
toward
everyone
as
it
was
to
her
.
*NL*
After
those
involuntary
words
--
that
if
he
were
free
he
would
have
asked
*NL*
on
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
her
love
--
uttered
at
a
moment
when
she
was
*NL*
so
strongly
agitated
,
Pierre
never
spoke
to
Natasha
of
his
feelings
;
and
*NL*
it
seemed
plain
to
her
that
those
words
,
which
had
then
so
comforted
*NL*
her
,
were
spoken
as
all
sorts
of
meaningless
words
are
spoken
to
comfort
*NL*
a
crying
child
.
It
was
not
because
Pierre
was
a
married
man
,
but
because
*NL*
Natasha
felt
very
strongly
with
him
that
moral
barrier
the
absence
of
*NL*
which
she
had
experienced
with
Kuragin
that
it
never
entered
her
head
*NL*
that
the
relations
between
him
and
herself
could
lead
to
love
on
her
*NL*
part
,
still
less
on
his
,
or
even
to
the
kind
of
tender
,
self-conscious
,
*NL*
romantic
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
of
which
she
had
known
*NL*
several
instances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
end
of
the
fast
of
St.
Peter
,
Agrafena
Ivanovna
Belova
,
a
*NL*
country
neighbor
of
the
Rostovs
,
came
to
Moscow
to
pay
her
devotions
at
*NL*
the
shrines
of
the
Moscow
saints
.
She
suggested
that
Natasha
should
fast
*NL*
and
prepare
for
Holy
Communion
,
and
Natasha
gladly
welcomed
the
idea
.
*NL*
Despite
the
doctor
's
orders
that
she
should
not
go
out
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
Natasha
insisted
on
fasting
and
preparing
for
the
sacrament
,
*NL*
not
as
they
generally
prepared
for
it
in
the
Rostov
family
by
attending
*NL*
three
services
in
their
own
house
,
but
as
Agrafena
Ivanovna
did
,
by
*NL*
going
to
church
every
day
for
a
week
and
not
once
missing
Vespers
,
*NL*
Matins
,
or
Mass.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
pleased
with
Natasha
's
zeal
;
after
the
poor
results
of
*NL*
the
medical
treatment
,
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
hoped
that
prayer
*NL*
might
help
her
daughter
more
than
medicines
and
,
though
not
without
fear
*NL*
and
concealing
it
from
the
doctor
,
she
agreed
to
Natasha
's
wish
and
*NL*
entrusted
her
to
Belova
.
Agrafena
Ivanovna
used
to
come
to
wake
Natasha
*NL*
at
three
in
the
morning
,
but
generally
found
her
already
awake
.
She
was
*NL*
afraid
of
being
late
for
Matins
.
Hastily
washing
,
and
meekly
putting
on
*NL*
her
shabbiest
dress
and
an
old
mantilla
,
Natasha
,
shivering
in
the
fresh
*NL*
air
,
went
out
into
the
deserted
streets
lit
by
the
clear
light
of
dawn
.
*NL*
By
Agrafena
Ivanovna
's
advice
Natasha
prepared
herself
not
in
their
own
*NL*
parish
,
but
at
a
church
where
,
according
to
the
devout
Agrafena
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
the
priest
was
a
man
of
very
severe
and
lofty
life
.
There
were
*NL*
never
many
people
in
the
church
;
Natasha
always
stood
beside
Belova
in
*NL*
the
customary
place
before
an
icon
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
let
into
the
*NL*
screen
before
the
choir
on
the
left
side
,
and
a
feeling
,
new
to
her
,
of
*NL*
humility
before
something
great
and
incomprehensible
,
seized
her
when
at
*NL*
that
unusual
morning
hour
,
gazing
at
the
dark
face
of
the
Virgin
*NL*
illuminated
by
the
candles
burning
before
it
and
by
the
morning
light
*NL*
falling
from
the
window
,
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
service
which
*NL*
she
tried
to
follow
with
understanding
.
When
she
understood
them
her
*NL*
personal
feeling
became
interwoven
in
the
prayers
with
shades
of
its
*NL*
own
.
When
she
did
not
understand
,
it
was
sweeter
still
to
think
that
the
*NL*
wish
to
understand
everything
is
pride
,
that
it
is
impossible
to
*NL*
understand
all
,
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
believe
and
to
commit
*NL*
oneself
to
God
,
whom
she
felt
guiding
her
soul
at
those
moments
.
She
*NL*
crossed
herself
,
bowed
low
,
and
when
she
did
not
understand
,
in
horror
*NL*
at
her
own
vileness
,
simply
asked
God
to
forgive
her
everything
,
*NL*
everything
,
to
have
mercy
upon
her
.
The
prayers
to
which
she
surrendered
*NL*
herself
most
of
all
were
those
of
repentance
.
On
her
way
home
at
an
*NL*
early
hour
when
she
met
no
one
but
bricklayers
going
to
work
or
men
*NL*
sweeping
the
street
,
and
everybody
within
the
houses
was
still
asleep
,
*NL*
Natasha
experienced
a
feeling
new
to
her
,
a
sense
of
the
possibility
of
*NL*
correcting
her
faults
,
the
possibility
of
a
new
,
clean
life
,
and
of
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
week
she
spent
in
this
way
,
that
feeling
grew
every
*NL*
day
.
And
the
happiness
of
taking
communion
,
or
``
communing
''
as
Agrafena
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
joyously
playing
with
the
word
,
called
it
,
seemed
to
Natasha
*NL*
so
great
that
she
felt
she
should
never
live
till
that
blessed
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
happy
day
came
,
and
on
that
memorable
Sunday
,
when
,
dressed
in
*NL*
white
muslin
,
she
returned
home
after
communion
,
for
the
first
time
for
*NL*
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
oppressed
by
the
thought
of
the
life
*NL*
that
lay
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
who
came
to
see
her
that
day
ordered
her
to
continue
the
*NL*
powders
he
had
prescribed
a
fortnight
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
certainly
go
on
taking
them
morning
and
evening
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
evidently
sincerely
satisfied
with
his
success
.
``
Only
,
please
be
*NL*
particular
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quite
easy
,
''
he
continued
playfully
,
as
he
adroitly
took
the
gold
*NL*
coin
in
his
palm
.
``
She
will
soon
be
singing
and
frolicking
about
.
The
*NL*
last
medicine
has
done
her
a
very
great
deal
of
good
.
She
has
freshened
*NL*
up
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
with
a
cheerful
expression
on
her
face
,
looked
down
at
her
*NL*
nails
and
spat
a
little
for
luck
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
July
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
about
the
war
*NL*
began
to
spread
in
Moscow
;
people
spoke
of
an
appeal
by
the
Emperor
to
*NL*
the
people
,
and
of
his
coming
himself
from
the
army
to
Moscow
.
And
as
up
*NL*
to
the
eleventh
of
July
no
manifesto
or
appeal
had
been
received
,
*NL*
exaggerated
reports
became
current
about
them
and
about
the
position
of
*NL*
Russia
.
It
was
said
that
the
Emperor
was
leaving
the
army
because
it
was
*NL*
in
danger
,
it
was
said
that
Smolensk
had
surrendered
,
that
Napoleon
had
*NL*
an
army
of
a
million
and
only
a
miracle
could
save
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eleventh
of
July
,
which
was
Saturday
,
the
manifesto
was
received
*NL*
but
was
not
yet
in
print
,
and
Pierre
,
who
was
at
the
Rostovs
'
,
promised
*NL*
to
come
to
dinner
next
day
,
Sunday
,
and
bring
a
copy
of
the
manifesto
*NL*
and
appeal
,
which
he
would
obtain
from
Count
Rostopchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Sunday
,
the
Rostovs
went
to
Mass
at
the
Razumovskis
'
private
chapel
*NL*
as
usual
.
It
was
a
hot
July
day
.
Even
at
ten
o'clock
,
when
the
Rostovs
*NL*
got
out
of
their
carriage
at
the
chapel
,
the
sultry
air
,
the
shouts
of
*NL*
hawkers
,
the
light
and
gay
summer
clothes
of
the
crowd
,
the
dusty
leaves
*NL*
of
the
trees
on
the
boulevard
,
the
sounds
of
the
band
and
the
white
*NL*
trousers
of
a
battalion
marching
to
parade
,
the
rattling
of
wheels
on
*NL*
the
cobblestones
,
and
the
brilliant
,
hot
sunshine
were
all
full
of
that
*NL*
summer
languor
,
that
content
and
discontent
with
the
present
,
which
is
*NL*
most
strongly
felt
on
a
bright
,
hot
day
in
town
.
All
the
Moscow
*NL*
notabilities
,
all
the
Rostovs
'
acquaintances
,
were
at
the
Razumovskis
'
*NL*
chapel
,
for
,
as
if
expecting
something
to
happen
,
many
wealthy
families
*NL*
who
usually
left
town
for
their
country
estates
had
not
gone
away
that
*NL*
summer
.
As
Natasha
,
at
her
mother
's
side
,
passed
through
the
crowd
*NL*
behind
a
liveried
footman
who
cleared
the
way
for
them
,
she
heard
a
*NL*
young
man
speaking
about
her
in
too
loud
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Rostova
,
the
one
who
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
much
thinner
,
but
all
the
same
she
's
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
,
or
thought
she
heard
,
the
names
of
Kuragin
and
Bolkonski
.
But
*NL*
she
was
always
imagining
that
.
It
always
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
who
*NL*
looked
at
her
was
thinking
only
of
what
had
happened
to
her
.
With
a
*NL*
sinking
heart
,
wretched
as
she
always
was
now
when
she
found
herself
in
*NL*
a
crowd
,
Natasha
in
her
lilac
silk
dress
trimmed
with
black
lace
walked
-
*NL*
-
as
women
can
walk
--
with
the
more
repose
and
stateliness
the
greater
the
*NL*
pain
and
shame
in
her
soul
.
She
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
pretty
,
*NL*
but
this
no
longer
gave
her
satisfaction
as
it
used
to
.
On
the
contrary
*NL*
it
tormented
her
more
than
anything
else
of
late
,
and
particularly
so
on
*NL*
this
bright
,
hot
summer
day
in
town
.
``
It
's
Sunday
again
--
another
week
*NL*
past
,
''
she
thought
,
recalling
that
she
had
been
here
the
Sunday
before
,
*NL*
``
and
always
the
same
life
that
is
no
life
,
and
the
same
surroundings
in
*NL*
which
it
used
to
be
so
easy
to
live
.
I
'm
pretty
,
I
'm
young
,
and
I
know
*NL*
that
now
I
am
good
.
I
used
to
be
bad
,
but
now
I
know
I
am
good
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
,
``
but
yet
my
best
years
are
slipping
by
and
are
no
good
to
*NL*
anyone
.
''
She
stood
by
her
mother
's
side
and
exchanged
nods
with
*NL*
acquaintances
near
her
.
From
habit
she
scrutinized
the
ladies
'
dresses
,
*NL*
condemned
the
bearing
of
a
lady
standing
close
by
who
was
not
crossing
*NL*
herself
properly
but
in
a
cramped
manner
,
and
again
she
thought
with
*NL*
vexation
that
she
was
herself
being
judged
and
was
judging
others
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
,
at
the
sound
of
the
service
,
she
felt
horrified
at
her
own
*NL*
vileness
,
horrified
that
the
former
purity
of
her
soul
was
again
lost
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
comely
,
fresh-looking
old
man
was
conducting
the
service
with
that
*NL*
mild
solemnity
which
has
so
elevating
and
soothing
an
effect
on
the
*NL*
souls
of
the
worshipers
.
The
gates
of
the
sanctuary
screen
were
closed
,
*NL*
the
curtain
was
slowly
drawn
,
and
from
behind
it
a
soft
mysterious
voice
*NL*
pronounced
some
words
.
Tears
,
the
cause
of
which
she
herself
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
made
Natasha
's
breast
heave
,
and
a
joyous
but
oppressive
*NL*
feeling
agitated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Teach
me
what
I
should
do
,
how
to
live
my
life
,
how
I
may
grow
good
*NL*
forever
,
forever
!
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deacon
came
out
onto
the
raised
space
before
the
altar
screen
and
,
*NL*
holding
his
thumb
extended
,
drew
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
*NL*
and
,
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast
,
began
in
a
loud
and
*NL*
solemn
voice
to
recite
the
words
of
the
prayer
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
peace
let
us
pray
unto
the
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
one
community
,
without
distinction
of
class
,
without
enmity
,
united
*NL*
by
brotherly
love
--
let
us
pray
!
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
peace
that
is
from
above
,
and
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
world
of
angels
and
all
the
spirits
who
dwell
above
us
,
''
prayed
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
prayed
for
the
warriors
,
she
thought
of
her
brother
and
*NL*
Denisov
.
When
they
prayed
for
all
traveling
by
land
and
sea
,
she
*NL*
remembered
Prince
Andrew
,
prayed
for
him
,
and
asked
God
to
forgive
her
*NL*
all
the
wrongs
she
had
done
him
.
When
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
us
,
*NL*
she
prayed
for
the
members
of
her
own
family
,
her
father
and
mother
and
*NL*
Sonya
,
realizing
for
the
first
time
how
wrongly
she
had
acted
toward
*NL*
them
,
and
feeling
all
the
strength
of
her
love
for
them
.
When
they
*NL*
prayed
for
those
who
hate
us
,
she
tried
to
think
of
her
enemies
and
*NL*
people
who
hated
her
,
in
order
to
pray
for
them
.
She
included
among
her
*NL*
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
who
had
business
dealings
with
her
father
,
*NL*
and
always
at
the
thought
of
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
she
*NL*
remembered
Anatole
who
had
done
her
so
much
harm
--
and
though
he
did
not
*NL*
hate
her
she
gladly
prayed
for
him
as
for
an
enemy
.
Only
at
prayer
did
*NL*
she
feel
able
to
think
clearly
and
calmly
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Anatole
,
*NL*
as
men
for
whom
her
feelings
were
as
nothing
compared
with
her
awe
and
*NL*
devotion
to
God
.
When
they
prayed
for
the
Imperial
family
and
the
Synod
,
*NL*
she
bowed
very
low
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
,
saying
to
herself
*NL*
that
even
if
she
did
not
understand
,
still
she
could
not
doubt
,
and
at
*NL*
any
rate
loved
the
governing
Synod
and
prayed
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
the
Litany
the
deacon
crossed
the
stole
over
his
*NL*
breast
and
said
,
``
Let
us
commit
ourselves
and
our
whole
lives
to
Christ
*NL*
the
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Commit
ourselves
to
God
,
''
Natasha
inwardly
repeated
.
``
Lord
God
,
I
*NL*
submit
myself
to
Thy
will
!
''
she
thought
.
``
I
want
nothing
,
wish
for
*NL*
nothing
;
teach
me
what
to
do
and
how
to
use
my
will
!
Take
me
,
take
me
!
''
*NL*
prayed
Natasha
,
with
impatient
emotion
in
her
heart
,
not
crossing
*NL*
herself
but
letting
her
slender
arms
hang
down
as
if
expecting
some
*NL*
invisible
power
at
any
moment
to
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
herself
,
*NL*
from
her
regrets
,
desires
,
remorse
,
hopes
,
and
sins
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
looked
round
several
times
at
her
daughter
's
softened
face
*NL*
and
shining
eyes
and
prayed
God
to
help
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unexpectedly
,
in
the
middle
of
the
service
,
and
not
in
the
usual
order
*NL*
Natasha
knew
so
well
,
the
deacon
brought
out
a
small
stool
,
the
one
he
*NL*
knelt
on
when
praying
on
Trinity
Sunday
,
and
placed
it
before
the
doors
*NL*
of
the
sanctuary
screen
.
The
priest
came
out
with
his
purple
velvet
*NL*
biretta
on
his
head
,
adjusted
his
hair
,
and
knelt
down
with
an
effort
.
*NL*
Everybody
followed
his
example
and
they
looked
at
one
another
in
*NL*
surprise
.
Then
came
the
prayer
just
received
from
the
Synod
--
a
prayer
*NL*
for
the
deliverance
of
Russia
from
hostile
invasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
God
of
might
,
God
of
our
salvation
!
''
began
the
priest
in
that
*NL*
voice
,
clear
,
not
grandiloquent
but
mild
,
in
which
only
the
Slav
clergy
*NL*
read
and
which
acts
so
irresistibly
on
a
Russian
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
God
of
might
,
God
of
our
salvation

Look
this
day
in

people

and
graciously
hear

have

This
foe
confounding
Thy
land

desiring
to
lay
waste
*NL*
the
whole

rises
against

together

to
defile

triumph

them
swiftly
beneath
*NL*
the
feet
of
Thy
faithful
servants
!
For
Thou
art
the
defense
,
the
succor
,
*NL*
and
the
victory
of
them
that
put
their
trust
in
Thee
,
and
to
Thee
be
all
*NL*
glory
,
to
Father
,
Son
,
and
Holy
Ghost
,
now
and
forever
,
world
without
*NL*
end
.
Amen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Natasha
's
receptive
condition
of
soul
this
prayer
affected
her
*NL*
strongly
.
She
listened
to
every
word
about
the
victory
of
Moses
over
*NL*
Amalek
,
of
Gideon
over
Midian
,
and
of
David
over
Goliath
,
and
about
the
*NL*
destruction
of
``
Thy
Jerusalem
,
''
and
she
prayed
to
God
with
the
*NL*
tenderness
and
emotion
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowing
,
but
without
*NL*
fully
understanding
what
she
was
asking
of
God
in
that
prayer
.
She
*NL*
shared
with
all
her
heart
in
the
prayer
for
the
spirit
of
righteousness
,
*NL*
for
the
strengthening
of
the
heart
by
faith
and
hope
,
and
its
animation
*NL*
by
love
.
But
she
could
not
pray
that
her
enemies
might
be
trampled
under
*NL*
foot
when
but
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
wishing
she
had
more
of
*NL*
them
that
she
might
pray
for
them
.
But
neither
could
she
doubt
the
*NL*
righteousness
of
the
prayer
that
was
being
read
on
bended
knees
.
She
*NL*
felt
in
her
heart
a
devout
and
tremulous
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
*NL*
punishment
that
overtakes
men
for
their
sins
,
and
especially
of
her
own
*NL*
sins
,
and
she
prayed
to
God
to
forgive
them
all
,
and
her
too
,
and
to
*NL*
give
them
all
,
and
her
too
,
peace
and
happiness
.
And
it
seemed
to
her
*NL*
that
God
heard
her
prayer
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
day
when
Pierre
,
after
leaving
the
Rostovs
'
with
Natasha
's
*NL*
grateful
look
fresh
in
his
mind
,
had
gazed
at
the
comet
that
seemed
to
*NL*
be
fixed
in
the
sky
and
felt
that
something
new
was
appearing
on
his
own
*NL*
horizon
--
from
that
day
the
problem
of
the
vanity
and
uselessness
of
all
*NL*
earthly
things
,
that
had
incessantly
tormented
him
,
no
longer
presented
*NL*
itself
.
That
terrible
question
``
Why
?
''
``
Wherefore
?
''
which
had
come
to
him
*NL*
amid
every
occupation
,
was
now
replaced
,
not
by
another
question
or
by
a
*NL*
reply
to
the
former
question
,
but
by
her
image
.
When
he
listened
to
,
or
*NL*
himself
took
part
in
,
trivial
conversations
,
when
he
read
or
heard
of
*NL*
human
baseness
or
folly
,
he
was
not
horrified
as
formerly
,
and
did
not
*NL*
ask
himself
why
men
struggled
so
about
these
things
when
all
is
so
*NL*
transient
and
incomprehensible
--
but
he
remembered
her
as
he
had
last
*NL*
seen
her
,
and
all
his
doubts
vanished
--
not
because
she
had
answered
the
*NL*
questions
that
had
haunted
him
,
but
because
his
conception
of
her
*NL*
transferred
him
instantly
to
another
,
a
brighter
,
realm
of
spiritual
*NL*
activity
in
which
no
one
could
be
justified
or
guilty
--
a
realm
of
beauty
*NL*
and
love
which
it
was
worth
living
for
.
Whatever
worldly
baseness
*NL*
presented
itself
to
him
,
he
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
supposing
N.
N.
swindled
the
country
and
the
Tsar
,
and
the
*NL*
country
and
the
Tsar
confer
honors
upon
him
,
what
does
that
matter
?
She
*NL*
smiled
at
me
yesterday
and
asked
me
to
come
again
,
and
I
love
her
,
and
*NL*
no
one
will
ever
know
it
.
''
And
his
soul
felt
calm
and
peaceful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
still
went
into
society
,
drank
as
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
*NL*
dissipated
life
,
because
besides
the
hours
he
spent
at
the
Rostovs
'
*NL*
there
were
other
hours
he
had
to
spend
somehow
,
and
the
habits
and
*NL*
acquaintances
he
had
made
in
Moscow
formed
a
current
that
bore
him
along
*NL*
irresistibly
.
But
latterly
,
when
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
came
*NL*
from
the
seat
of
war
and
Natasha
's
health
began
to
improve
and
she
no
*NL*
longer
aroused
in
him
the
former
feeling
of
careful
pity
,
an
ever
-
*NL*
increasing
restlessness
,
which
he
could
not
explain
,
took
possession
of
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
that
the
condition
he
was
in
could
not
continue
long
,
that
*NL*
a
catastrophe
was
coming
which
would
change
his
whole
life
,
and
he
*NL*
impatiently
sought
everywhere
for
signs
of
that
approaching
catastrophe
.
*NL*
One
of
his
brother
Masons
had
revealed
to
Pierre
the
following
prophecy
*NL*
concerning
Napoleon
,
drawn
from
the
Revelation
of
St.
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
chapter
13
,
verse
18
,
of
the
Apocalypse
,
it
is
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
Here
is
wisdom
.
Let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
*NL*
beast
:
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man
;
and
his
number
is
Six
hundred
*NL*
threescore
and
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
fifth
verse
of
the
same
chapter
:
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
*NL*
blasphemies
;
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
*NL*
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
alphabet
,
written
out
with
the
same
numerical
values
as
the
*NL*
Hebrew
,
in
which
the
first
nine
letters
denote
units
and
the
others
*NL*
tens
,
will
have
the
following
significance

Writing
the
words
L'Empereur
Napoleon
in
numbers
,
it
appears
that
the
*NL*
sum
of
them
is
666
,
and
that
Napoleon
was
therefore
the
beast
foretold
*NL*
in
the
Apocalypse
.
Moreover
,
by
applying
the
same
system
to
the
words
*NL*
quarante-deux
,
*
which
was
the
term
allowed
to
the
beast
that
``
spoke
*NL*
great
things
and
blasphemies
,
''
the
same
number
666
was
obtained
;
from
*NL*
which
it
followed
that
the
limit
fixed
for
Napoleon
's
power
had
come
in
*NL*
the
year
1812
when
the
French
emperor
was
forty-two
.
This
prophecy
*NL*
pleased
Pierre
very
much
and
he
often
asked
himself
what
would
put
an
*NL*
end
to
the
power
of
the
beast
,
that
is
,
of
Napoleon
,
and
tried
by
the
*NL*
same
system
of
using
letters
as
numbers
and
adding
them
up
,
to
find
an
*NL*
answer
to
the
question
that
engrossed
him
.
He
wrote
the
words
L'Empereur
*NL*
Alexandre
,
La
nation
russe
and
added
up
their
numbers
,
but
the
sums
were
*NL*
either
more
or
less
than
666
.
Once
when
making
such
calculations
he
*NL*
wrote
down
his
own
name
in
French
,
Comte
Pierre
Besouhoff
,
but
the
sum
*NL*
of
the
numbers
did
not
come
right
.
Then
he
changed
the
spelling
,
*NL*
substituting
a
z
for
the
s
and
adding
de
and
the
article
le
,
still
*NL*
without
obtaining
the
desired
result
.
Then
it
occurred
to
him
:
if
the
*NL*
answer
to
the
question
were
contained
in
his
name
,
his
nationality
would
*NL*
also
be
given
in
the
answer
.
So
he
wrote
Le
russe
Besuhof
and
adding
up
*NL*
the
numbers
got
671
.
This
was
only
five
too
much
,
and
five
was
*NL*
represented
by
e
,
the
very
letter
elided
from
the
article
le
before
the
*NL*
word
Empereur
.
By
omitting
the
e
,
though
incorrectly
,
Pierre
got
the
*NL*
answer
he
sought
.
L'russe
Besuhof
made
666
.
This
discovery
excited
him
.
*NL*
How
,
or
by
what
means
,
he
was
connected
with
the
great
event
foretold
in
*NL*
the
Apocalypse
he
did
not
know
,
but
he
did
not
doubt
that
connection
for
*NL*
a
moment
.
His
love
for
Natasha
,
Antichrist
,
Napoleon
,
the
invasion
,
the
*NL*
comet
,
666
,
L'Empereur
Napoleon
,
and
L'russe
Besuhof
--
all
this
had
to
*NL*
mature
and
culminate
,
to
lift
him
out
of
that
spellbound
,
petty
sphere
*NL*
of
Moscow
habits
in
which
he
felt
himself
held
captive
and
lead
him
to
a
*NL*
great
achievement
and
great
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Forty-two
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eve
of
the
Sunday
when
the
special
prayer
was
read
,
Pierre
had
*NL*
promised
the
Rostovs
to
bring
them
,
from
Count
Rostopchin
whom
he
knew
*NL*
well
,
both
the
appeal
to
the
people
and
the
news
from
the
army
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
,
when
he
went
to
call
at
Rostopchin
's
he
met
there
a
courier
*NL*
fresh
from
the
army
,
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
,
who
often
danced
at
*NL*
Moscow
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
please
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
relieve
me
of
something
!
''
said
the
*NL*
courier
.
``
I
have
a
sackful
of
letters
to
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Among
these
letters
was
one
from
Nicholas
Rostov
to
his
father
.
Pierre
*NL*
took
that
letter
,
and
Rostopchin
also
gave
him
the
Emperor
's
appeal
to
*NL*
Moscow
,
which
had
just
been
printed
,
the
last
army
orders
,
and
his
own
*NL*
most
recent
bulletin
.
Glancing
through
the
army
orders
,
Pierre
found
in
*NL*
one
of
them
,
in
the
lists
of
killed
,
wounded
,
and
rewarded
,
the
name
of
*NL*
Nicholas
Rostov
,
awarded
a
St.
George
's
Cross
of
the
Fourth
Class
for
*NL*
courage
shown
in
the
Ostrovna
affair
,
and
in
the
same
order
the
name
of
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
,
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
*NL*
Chasseurs
.
Though
he
did
not
want
to
remind
the
Rostovs
of
Bolkonski
,
*NL*
Pierre
could
not
refrain
from
making
them
happy
by
the
news
of
their
*NL*
son
's
having
received
a
decoration
,
so
he
sent
that
printed
army
order
*NL*
and
Nicholas
'
letter
to
the
Rostovs
,
keeping
the
appeal
,
the
bulletin
,
*NL*
and
the
other
orders
to
take
with
him
when
he
went
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
conversation
with
Count
Rostopchin
and
the
latter
's
tone
of
anxious
*NL*
hurry
,
the
meeting
with
the
courier
who
talked
casually
of
how
badly
*NL*
things
were
going
in
the
army
,
the
rumors
of
the
discovery
of
spies
in
*NL*
Moscow
and
of
a
leaflet
in
circulation
stating
that
Napoleon
promised
to
*NL*
be
in
both
the
Russian
capitals
by
the
autumn
,
and
the
talk
of
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
being
expected
to
arrive
next
day
--
all
aroused
with
fresh
*NL*
force
that
feeling
of
agitation
and
expectation
in
Pierre
which
he
had
*NL*
been
conscious
of
ever
since
the
appearance
of
the
comet
,
and
especially
*NL*
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
long
been
thinking
of
entering
the
army
and
would
have
done
so
*NL*
had
he
not
been
hindered
,
first
,
by
his
membership
of
the
Society
of
*NL*
Freemasons
to
which
he
was
bound
by
oath
and
which
preached
perpetual
*NL*
peace
and
the
abolition
of
war
,
and
secondly
,
by
the
fact
that
when
he
*NL*
saw
the
great
mass
of
Muscovites
who
had
donned
uniform
and
were
talking
*NL*
patriotism
,
he
somehow
felt
ashamed
to
take
the
step
.
But
the
chief
*NL*
reason
for
not
carrying
out
his
intention
to
enter
the
army
lay
in
the
*NL*
vague
idea
that
he
was
L'russe
Besuhof
who
had
the
number
of
the
beast
,
*NL*
666
;
that
his
part
in
the
great
affair
of
setting
a
limit
to
the
power
*NL*
of
the
beast
that
spoke
great
and
blasphemous
things
had
been
*NL*
predestined
from
eternity
,
and
that
therefore
he
ought
not
to
undertake
*NL*
anything
,
but
wait
for
what
was
bound
to
come
to
pass
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
intimate
friends
were
dining
with
the
Rostovs
that
day
,
as
usual
*NL*
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
came
early
so
as
to
find
them
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
grown
so
stout
this
year
that
he
would
have
been
abnormal
had
he
*NL*
not
been
so
tall
,
so
broad
of
limb
,
and
so
strong
that
he
carried
his
*NL*
bulk
with
evident
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
the
stairs
,
puffing
and
muttering
something
.
His
coachman
did
*NL*
not
even
ask
whether
he
was
to
wait
.
He
knew
that
when
his
master
was
at
*NL*
the
Rostovs
'
he
stayed
till
midnight
.
The
Rostovs
'
footman
rushed
*NL*
eagerly
forward
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak
and
take
his
hat
and
*NL*
stick
.
Pierre
,
from
club
habit
,
always
left
both
hat
and
stick
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
he
saw
in
the
house
was
Natasha
.
Even
before
he
saw
*NL*
her
,
while
taking
off
his
cloak
,
he
heard
her
.
She
was
practicing
solfa
*NL*
exercises
in
the
music
room
.
He
knew
that
she
had
not
sung
since
her
*NL*
illness
,
and
so
the
sound
of
her
voice
surprised
and
delighted
him
.
He
*NL*
opened
the
door
softly
and
saw
her
,
in
the
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
at
*NL*
church
,
walking
about
the
room
singing
.
She
had
her
back
to
him
when
he
*NL*
opened
the
door
,
but
when
,
turning
quickly
,
she
saw
his
broad
,
surprised
*NL*
face
,
she
blushed
and
came
rapidly
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
try
to
sing
again
,
''
she
said
,
adding
as
if
by
way
of
excuse
,
*NL*
``
it
is
,
at
least
,
something
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
've
come
!
I
am
so
happy
today
,
''
she
said
,
with
the
old
*NL*
animation
Pierre
had
not
seen
in
her
for
a
long
time
.
``
You
know
Nicholas
*NL*
has
received
a
St.
George
's
Cross
?
I
am
so
proud
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
sent
that
announcement
.
But
I
do
n't
want
to
interrupt
you
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
and
was
about
to
go
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
sing
?
''
she
said
blushing
,
and
fixing
her
*NL*
eyes
inquiringly
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
...
Why
should
it
be
?
On
the
contrary
...
But
why
do
you
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
myself
,
''
Natasha
answered
quickly
,
``
but
I
should
not
like
*NL*
to
do
anything
you
disapproved
of
.
I
believe
in
you
completely
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
important
you
are
to
me
,
how
much
you
've
done
for
me
...
''
*NL*
She
spoke
rapidly
and
did
not
notice
how
Pierre
flushed
at
her
words
.
``
I
*NL*
saw
in
that
same
army
order
that
he
,
Bolkonski
''
-LRB-
she
whispered
the
name
*NL*
hastily
-RRB-
,
``
is
in
Russia
,
and
in
the
army
again
.
What
do
you
think
?
''
--
she
*NL*
was
speaking
hurriedly
,
evidently
afraid
her
strength
might
fail
her
--
*NL*
``
Will
he
ever
forgive
me
?
Will
he
not
always
have
a
bitter
feeling
*NL*
toward
me
?
What
do
you
think
?
What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
...
''
Pierre
replied
,
``
that
he
has
nothing
to
forgive
...
If
I
*NL*
were
in
his
place
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
association
of
ideas
,
Pierre
was
at
once
carried
back
to
the
day
*NL*
when
,
trying
to
comfort
her
,
he
had
said
that
if
he
were
not
himself
but
*NL*
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
free
,
he
would
ask
on
his
knees
for
her
*NL*
hand
;
and
the
same
feeling
of
pity
,
tenderness
,
and
love
took
possession
*NL*
of
him
and
the
same
words
rose
to
his
lips
.
But
she
did
not
give
him
*NL*
time
to
say
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
...
you
...
''
she
said
,
uttering
the
word
you
rapturously
--
*NL*
``
that
's
a
different
thing
.
I
know
no
one
kinder
,
more
generous
,
or
*NL*
better
than
you
;
nobody
could
be
!
Had
you
not
been
there
then
,
and
now
*NL*
too
,
I
do
n't
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
,
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
suddenly
rose
in
her
eyes
,
she
turned
away
,
lifted
her
music
*NL*
before
her
eyes
,
began
singing
again
,
and
again
began
walking
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Petya
came
running
in
from
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
was
now
a
handsome
rosy
lad
of
fifteen
with
full
red
lips
and
*NL*
resembled
Natasha
.
He
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university
,
but
he
and
*NL*
his
friend
Obolenski
had
lately
,
in
secret
,
agreed
to
join
the
hussars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
had
come
rushing
out
to
talk
to
his
namesake
about
this
affair
.
He
*NL*
had
asked
Pierre
to
find
out
whether
he
would
be
accepted
in
the
*NL*
hussars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
walked
up
and
down
the
drawing
room
,
not
listening
to
what
Petya
*NL*
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
pulled
him
by
the
arm
to
attract
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
about
my
plan
?
Peter
Kirilych
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
You
are
my
*NL*
only
hope
,
''
said
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
your
plan
.
To
join
the
hussars
?
I
'll
mention
it
,
I
'll
bring
it
*NL*
all
up
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mon
cher
,
have
you
got
the
manifesto
?
''
asked
the
old
count
.
``
The
*NL*
countess
has
been
to
Mass
at
the
Razumovskis
'
and
heard
the
new
prayer
.
*NL*
She
says
it
's
very
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
got
it
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
The
Emperor
is
to
be
here
tomorrow
...
*NL*
there
's
to
be
an
Extraordinary
Meeting
of
the
nobility
,
and
they
are
*NL*
talking
of
a
levy
of
ten
men
per
thousand
.
Oh
yes
,
let
me
congratulate
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
thank
God
!
Well
,
and
what
news
from
the
army
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
again
retreating
.
They
say
we
're
already
near
Smolensk
,
''
replied
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
!
''
exclaimed
the
count
.
``
Where
is
the
manifesto
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
's
appeal
?
Oh
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
began
feeling
in
his
pockets
for
the
papers
,
but
could
not
find
*NL*
them
.
Still
slapping
his
pockets
,
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
countess
who
*NL*
entered
the
room
and
glanced
uneasily
around
,
evidently
expecting
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
had
left
off
singing
but
had
not
yet
come
into
the
drawing
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
word
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
've
done
with
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
always
losing
everything
!
''
remarked
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
entered
with
a
softened
and
agitated
expression
of
face
and
sat
*NL*
down
looking
silently
at
Pierre
.
As
soon
as
she
entered
,
Pierre
's
*NL*
features
,
which
had
been
gloomy
,
suddenly
lighted
up
,
and
while
still
*NL*
searching
for
the
papers
he
glanced
at
her
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
really
!
I
'll
drive
home
,
I
must
have
left
them
there
.
I
'll
*NL*
certainly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
be
late
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
And
my
coachman
has
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sonya
,
who
had
gone
to
look
for
the
papers
in
the
anteroom
,
had
*NL*
found
them
in
Pierre
's
hat
,
where
he
had
carefully
tucked
them
under
the
*NL*
lining
.
Pierre
was
about
to
begin
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
after
dinner
,
''
said
the
old
count
,
evidently
expecting
much
*NL*
enjoyment
from
that
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
,
at
which
champagne
was
drunk
to
the
health
of
the
new
*NL*
chevalier
of
St.
George
,
Shinshin
told
them
the
town
news
,
of
the
*NL*
illness
of
the
old
Georgian
princess
,
of
Metivier
's
disappearance
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
of
how
some
German
fellow
had
been
brought
to
Rostopchin
and
*NL*
accused
of
being
a
French
``
spyer
''
-LRB-
so
Count
Rostopchin
had
told
the
*NL*
story
-RRB-
,
and
how
Rostopchin
let
him
go
and
assured
the
people
that
he
was
*NL*
``
not
a
spire
at
all
,
but
only
an
old
German
ruin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
are
being
arrested
...
''
said
the
count
.
``
I
've
told
the
countess
*NL*
she
should
not
speak
French
so
much
.
It
's
not
the
time
for
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
heard
?
''
Shinshin
asked
.
``
Prince
Golitsyn
has
engaged
a
*NL*
master
to
teach
him
Russian
.
It
is
becoming
dangerous
to
speak
French
in
*NL*
the
streets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
about
you
,
Count
Peter
Kirilych
?
If
they
call
up
the
militia
,
*NL*
you
too
will
have
to
mount
a
horse
,
''
remarked
the
old
count
,
addressing
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
been
silent
and
preoccupied
all
through
dinner
,
seeming
not
*NL*
to
grasp
what
was
said
.
He
looked
at
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
the
war
,
''
he
said
.
``
No
!
What
sort
of
warrior
should
I
make
?
And
*NL*
yet
everything
is
so
strange
,
so
strange
!
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
I
am
very
far
from
having
military
tastes
,
but
in
these
times
no
*NL*
one
can
answer
for
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
the
count
settled
himself
comfortably
in
an
easy
chair
and
*NL*
with
a
serious
face
asked
Sonya
,
who
was
considered
an
excellent
reader
,
*NL*
to
read
the
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Moscow
,
our
ancient
Capital
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
enemy
has
entered
the
borders
of
Russia
with
immense
forces
.
He
*NL*
comes
to
despoil
our
beloved
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
read
painstakingly
in
her
high-pitched
voice
.
The
count
listened
*NL*
with
closed
eyes
,
heaving
abrupt
sighs
at
certain
passages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
sat
erect
,
gazing
with
a
searching
look
now
at
her
father
and
*NL*
now
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
felt
her
eyes
on
him
and
tried
not
to
look
round
.
The
countess
*NL*
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
and
angrily
at
every
solemn
expression
in
*NL*
the
manifesto
.
In
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
danger
*NL*
threatening
her
son
would
not
soon
be
over
.
Shinshin
,
with
a
sarcastic
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
,
was
evidently
preparing
to
make
fun
of
anything
that
*NL*
gave
him
the
opportunity
:
Sonya
's
reading
,
any
remark
of
the
count
's
,
or
*NL*
even
the
manifesto
itself
should
no
better
pretext
present
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reading
about
the
dangers
that
threatened
Russia
,
the
hopes
the
*NL*
Emperor
placed
on
Moscow
and
especially
on
its
illustrious
nobility
,
*NL*
Sonya
,
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
due
chiefly
to
the
attention
that
was
*NL*
being
paid
to
her
,
read
the
last
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ourselves
will
not
delay
to
appear
among
our
people
in
that
Capital
*NL*
and
in
other
parts
of
our
realm
for
consultation
,
and
for
the
direction
*NL*
of
all
our
levies
,
both
those
now
barring
the
enemy
's
path
and
those
*NL*
freshly
formed
to
defeat
him
wherever
he
may
appear
.
May
the
ruin
he
*NL*
hopes
to
bring
upon
us
recoil
on
his
own
head
,
and
may
Europe
delivered
*NL*
from
bondage
glorify
the
name
of
Russia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
!
''
cried
the
count
,
opening
his
moist
eyes
and
sniffing
*NL*
repeatedly
,
as
if
a
strong
vinaigrette
had
been
held
to
his
nose
;
and
he
*NL*
added
,
``
Let
the
Emperor
but
say
the
word
and
we
'll
sacrifice
everything
*NL*
and
begrudge
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Shinshin
had
time
to
utter
the
joke
he
was
ready
to
make
on
the
*NL*
count
's
patriotism
,
Natasha
jumped
up
from
her
place
and
ran
to
her
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
darling
our
Papa
is
!
''
she
cried
,
kissing
him
,
and
she
again
*NL*
looked
at
Pierre
with
the
unconscious
coquetry
that
had
returned
to
her
*NL*
with
her
better
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
Here
's
a
patriot
for
you
!
''
said
Shinshin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
patriot
at
all
,
but
simply
...
''
Natasha
replied
in
an
injured
*NL*
tone
.
``
Everything
seems
funny
to
you
,
but
this
is
n't
at
all
a
joke
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
joke
indeed
!
''
put
in
the
count
.
``
Let
him
but
say
the
word
and
we
'll
*NL*
all
go
...
We
're
not
Germans
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
notice
,
it
says
,
`
for
consultation
'
?
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
what
it
's
for
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
Petya
,
to
whom
nobody
was
paying
any
attention
,
came
up
*NL*
to
his
father
with
a
very
flushed
face
and
said
in
his
breaking
voice
*NL*
that
was
now
deep
and
now
shrill
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Papa
,
I
tell
you
definitely
,
and
Mamma
too
,
it
's
as
you
please
,
*NL*
but
I
say
definitely
that
you
must
let
me
enter
the
army
,
because
I
*NL*
ca
n't
...
that
's
all
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
in
dismay
,
looked
up
to
heaven
,
clasped
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
turned
angrily
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
comes
of
your
talking
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
count
had
already
recovered
from
his
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
''
said
he
.
``
Here
's
a
fine
warrior
!
No
!
Nonsense
!
You
must
*NL*
study
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
nonsense
,
Papa

Fedya
Obolenski
is
younger
than
I
,
and
he
's
*NL*
going
too
.
Besides
,
all
the
same
I
ca
n't
study
now
when
...
''
Petya
*NL*
stopped
short
,
flushed
till
he
perspired
,
but
still
got
out
the
words
,
*NL*
``
when
our
Fatherland
is
in
danger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
that
'll
do

nonsense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
yourself
that
we
would
sacrifice
everything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Petya
!
Be
quiet
,
I
tell
you
!
''
cried
the
count
,
with
a
glance
at
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
had
turned
pale
and
was
staring
fixedly
at
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
--
Peter
Kirilych
here
will
also
tell
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

I
tell
you

Your
mother
's
milk
has
hardly
dried
on
your
lips
*NL*

you
want
to
go
into
the
army
!
There
,
there
,
I
tell
you
,
''
and
the
*NL*
count
moved
to
go
out
of
the
room
,
taking
the
papers
,
probably
to
reread
*NL*
them
in
his
study
before
having
a
nap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Peter
Kirilych
,
let
's
go
and
have
a
smoke
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
agitated
and
undecided
.
Natasha
's
unwontedly
brilliant
eyes
,
*NL*
continually
glancing
at
him
with
a
more
than
cordial
look
,
had
reduced
*NL*
him
to
this
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
I
'll
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
?
Why
,
you
meant
to
spend
the
evening
with
us

You
do
n't
often
*NL*
come
nowadays
as
it
is

and
this
girl
of
mine

said
the
count
good
-
*NL*
naturedly
,
pointing
to
Natasha

``
only
brightens
up
when
you
're
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
had
forgotten
...
I
really
must
go
home

business

''
said
*NL*
Pierre
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
au
revoir
!
''
said
the
count
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
going
?
Why
are
you
upset
?
''
asked
Natasha
,
and
she
looked
*NL*
challengingly
into
Pierre
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
love
you
!
''
was
what
he
wanted
to
say
,
but
he
did
not
say
it
,
*NL*
and
only
blushed
till
the
tears
came
,
and
lowered
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
is
better
for
me
to
come
less
often
...
because
...
No
,
simply
*NL*
I
have
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
No
,
tell
me
!
''
Natasha
began
resolutely
and
suddenly
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
with
dismayed
and
embarrassed
faces
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
smile
but
could
not
:
his
smile
expressed
suffering
,
and
he
silently
*NL*
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
to
the
Rostovs

any
more

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
definite
refusal
he
had
received
,
Petya
went
to
his
room
and
*NL*
there
locked
himself
in
and
wept
bitterly
.
When
he
came
in
to
tea
,
*NL*
silent
,
morose
,
and
with
tear-stained
face
,
everybody
pretended
not
to
*NL*
notice
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
Emperor
arrived
in
Moscow
,
and
several
of
the
Rostovs
'
*NL*
domestic
serfs
begged
permission
to
go
to
have
a
look
at
him
.
That
*NL*
morning
Petya
was
a
long
time
dressing
and
arranging
his
hair
and
collar
*NL*
to
look
like
a
grown-up
man
.
He
frowned
before
his
looking
glass
,
*NL*
gesticulated
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
finally
,
without
saying
a
word
*NL*
to
anyone
,
took
his
cap
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door
,
trying
to
*NL*
avoid
notice
.
Petya
decided
to
go
straight
to
where
the
Emperor
was
and
*NL*
to
explain
frankly
to
some
gentleman-in-waiting
-LRB-
he
imagined
the
Emperor
*NL*
to
be
always
surrounded
by
gentlemen-in-waiting
-RRB-
that
he
,
Count
Rostov
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
youth
wished
to
serve
his
country
;
that
youth
could
be
*NL*
no
hindrance
to
loyalty
,
and
that
he
was
ready
to
...
While
dressing
,
*NL*
Petya
had
prepared
many
fine
things
he
meant
to
say
to
the
gentleman-in
-
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
very
fact
of
being
so
young
that
Petya
counted
for
success
*NL*
in
reaching
the
Emperor
--
he
even
thought
how
surprised
everyone
would
be
*NL*
at
his
youthfulness
--
and
yet
in
the
arrangement
of
his
collar
and
hair
*NL*
and
by
his
sedate
deliberate
walk
he
wished
to
appear
a
grown-up
man
.
*NL*
But
the
farther
he
went
and
the
more
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
*NL*
ever-increasing
crowds
moving
toward
the
Kremlin
,
the
less
he
remembered
*NL*
to
walk
with
the
sedateness
and
deliberation
of
a
man
.
As
he
approached
*NL*
the
Kremlin
he
even
began
to
avoid
being
crushed
and
resolutely
stuck
*NL*
out
his
elbows
in
a
menacing
way
.
But
within
the
Trinity
Gateway
he
was
*NL*
so
pressed
to
the
wall
by
people
who
probably
were
unaware
of
the
*NL*
patriotic
intentions
with
which
he
had
come
that
in
spite
of
all
his
*NL*
determination
he
had
to
give
in
,
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
in
,
*NL*
rumbling
beneath
the
archway
.
Beside
Petya
stood
a
peasant
woman
,
a
*NL*
footman
,
two
tradesmen
,
and
a
discharged
soldier
.
After
standing
some
*NL*
time
in
the
gateway
,
Petya
tried
to
move
forward
in
front
of
the
others
*NL*
without
waiting
for
all
the
carriages
to
pass
,
and
he
began
resolutely
*NL*
working
his
way
with
his
elbows
,
but
the
woman
just
in
front
of
him
,
who
*NL*
was
the
first
against
whom
he
directed
his
efforts
,
angrily
shouted
at
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
shoving
for
,
young
lordling
?
Do
n't
you
see
we
're
all
*NL*
standing
still
?
Then
why
push
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
can
shove
,
''
said
the
footman
,
and
also
began
working
his
elbows
*NL*
to
such
effect
that
he
pushed
Petya
into
a
very
filthy
corner
of
the
*NL*
gateway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
wiped
his
perspiring
face
with
his
hands
and
pulled
up
the
damp
*NL*
collar
which
he
had
arranged
so
well
at
home
to
seem
like
a
man
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
no
longer
looked
presentable
,
and
feared
that
if
he
were
*NL*
now
to
approach
the
gentlemen-in-waiting
in
that
plight
he
would
not
be
*NL*
admitted
to
the
Emperor
.
But
it
was
impossible
to
smarten
oneself
up
or
*NL*
move
to
another
place
,
because
of
the
crowd
.
One
of
the
generals
who
*NL*
drove
past
was
an
acquaintance
of
the
Rostovs
'
,
and
Petya
thought
of
*NL*
asking
his
help
,
but
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
would
not
be
a
*NL*
manly
thing
to
do
.
When
the
carriages
had
all
passed
in
,
the
crowd
,
*NL*
carrying
Petya
with
it
,
streamed
forward
into
the
Kremlin
Square
which
*NL*
was
already
full
of
people
.
There
were
people
not
only
in
the
square
,
*NL*
but
everywhere
--
on
the
slopes
and
on
the
roofs
.
As
soon
as
Petya
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
square
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
joyous
*NL*
voices
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
whole
Kremlin
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
while
the
crowd
was
less
dense
,
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
bared
,
*NL*
and
everyone
rushed
forward
in
one
direction
.
Petya
was
being
pressed
so
*NL*
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
,
and
everybody
shouted
,
``
Hurrah
!
hurrah
!
*NL*
hurrah
!
''
Petya
stood
on
tiptoe
and
pushed
and
pinched
,
but
could
see
*NL*
nothing
except
the
people
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
faces
bore
the
same
expression
of
excitement
and
enthusiasm
.
A
*NL*
tradesman
's
wife
standing
beside
Petya
sobbed
,
and
the
tears
ran
down
*NL*
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
Angel
!
Dear
one
!
''
she
kept
repeating
,
wiping
away
her
tears
*NL*
with
her
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
was
heard
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
crowd
stood
still
,
but
then
it
made
another
rush
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
beside
himself
,
Petya
,
clinching
his
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
*NL*
ferociously
,
pushed
forward
,
elbowing
his
way
and
shouting
``
hurrah
!
''
as
*NL*
if
he
were
prepared
that
instant
to
kill
himself
and
everyone
else
,
but
*NL*
on
both
sides
of
him
other
people
with
similarly
ferocious
faces
pushed
*NL*
forward
and
everybody
shouted
``
hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
what
the
Emperor
is
!
''
thought
Petya
.
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
petition
*NL*
him
myself
--
that
would
be
too
bold
.
''
But
in
spite
of
this
he
continued
*NL*
to
struggle
desperately
forward
,
and
from
between
the
backs
of
those
in
*NL*
front
he
caught
glimpses
of
an
open
space
with
a
strip
of
red
cloth
*NL*
spread
out
on
it
;
but
just
then
the
crowd
swayed
back
--
the
police
in
*NL*
front
were
pushing
back
those
who
had
pressed
too
close
to
the
*NL*
procession
:
the
Emperor
was
passing
from
the
palace
to
the
Cathedral
of
*NL*
the
Assumption
--
and
Petya
unexpectedly
received
such
a
blow
on
his
side
*NL*
and
ribs
and
was
squeezed
so
hard
that
suddenly
everything
grew
dim
*NL*
before
his
eyes
and
he
lost
consciousness
.
When
he
came
to
himself
,
a
*NL*
man
of
clerical
appearance
with
a
tuft
of
gray
hair
at
the
back
of
his
*NL*
head
and
wearing
a
shabby
blue
cassock
--
probably
a
church
clerk
and
*NL*
chanter
--
was
holding
him
under
the
arm
with
one
hand
while
warding
off
*NL*
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
crushed
the
young
gentleman
!
''
said
the
clerk
.
``
What
are
you
up
*NL*
to
?
Gently
!
...
They
've
crushed
him
,
crushed
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
entered
the
Cathedral
of
the
Assumption
.
The
crowd
spread
*NL*
out
again
more
evenly
,
and
the
clerk
led
Petya
--
pale
and
breathless
--
to
*NL*
the
Tsar-cannon
.
Several
people
were
sorry
for
Petya
,
and
suddenly
a
*NL*
crowd
turned
toward
him
and
pressed
round
him
.
Those
who
stood
nearest
*NL*
him
attended
to
him
,
unbuttoned
his
coat
,
seated
him
on
the
raised
*NL*
platform
of
the
cannon
,
and
reproached
those
others
-LRB-
whoever
they
might
*NL*
be
-RRB-
who
had
crushed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
easily
get
killed
that
way
!
What
do
they
mean
by
it
?
Killing
*NL*
people
!
Poor
dear
,
he
's
as
white
as
a
sheet
!
''
--
various
voices
were
heard
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
soon
came
to
himself
,
the
color
returned
to
his
face
,
the
pain
had
*NL*
passed
,
and
at
the
cost
of
that
temporary
unpleasantness
he
had
obtained
*NL*
a
place
by
the
cannon
from
where
he
hoped
to
see
the
Emperor
who
would
*NL*
be
returning
that
way
.
Petya
no
longer
thought
of
presenting
his
*NL*
petition
.
If
he
could
only
see
the
Emperor
he
would
be
happy
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
service
was
proceeding
in
the
Cathedral
of
the
Assumption
--
it
*NL*
was
a
combined
service
of
prayer
on
the
occasion
of
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
arrival
and
of
thanksgiving
for
the
conclusion
of
peace
with
the
Turks
--
*NL*
the
crowd
outside
spread
out
and
hawkers
appeared
,
selling
kvas
,
*NL*
gingerbread
,
and
poppyseed
sweets
-LRB-
of
which
Petya
was
particularly
*NL*
fond
-RRB-
,
and
ordinary
conversation
could
again
be
heard
.
A
tradesman
's
*NL*
wife
was
showing
a
rent
in
her
shawl
and
telling
how
much
the
shawl
had
*NL*
cost
;
another
was
saying
that
all
silk
goods
had
now
got
dear
.
The
clerk
*NL*
who
had
rescued
Petya
was
talking
to
a
functionary
about
the
priests
who
*NL*
were
officiating
that
day
with
the
bishop
.
The
clerk
several
times
used
*NL*
the
word
``
plenary
''
-LRB-
of
the
service
-RRB-
,
a
word
Petya
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
Two
young
citizens
were
joking
with
some
serf
girls
who
were
cracking
*NL*
nuts
.
All
these
conversations
,
especially
the
joking
with
the
girls
,
*NL*
were
such
as
might
have
had
a
particular
charm
for
Petya
at
his
age
,
but
*NL*
they
did
not
interest
him
now
.
He
sat
on
his
elevation
--
the
pedestal
of
*NL*
the
cannon
--
still
agitated
as
before
by
the
thought
of
the
Emperor
and
*NL*
by
his
love
for
him
.
The
feeling
of
pain
and
fear
he
had
experienced
*NL*
when
he
was
being
crushed
,
together
with
that
of
rapture
,
still
further
*NL*
intensified
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
sound
of
a
firing
of
cannon
was
heard
from
the
embankment
,
*NL*
to
celebrate
the
signing
of
peace
with
the
Turks
,
and
the
crowd
rushed
*NL*
impetuously
toward
the
embankment
to
watch
the
firing
.
Petya
too
would
*NL*
have
run
there
,
but
the
clerk
who
had
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
*NL*
his
protection
stopped
him
.
The
firing
was
still
proceeding
when
*NL*
officers
,
generals
,
and
gentlemen-in-waiting
came
running
out
of
the
*NL*
cathedral
,
and
after
them
others
in
a
more
leisurely
manner
:
caps
were
*NL*
again
raised
,
and
those
who
had
run
to
look
at
the
cannon
ran
back
*NL*
again
.
At
last
four
men
in
uniforms
and
sashes
emerged
from
the
*NL*
cathedral
doors
.
``
Hurrah
!
hurrah
!
''
shouted
the
crowd
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
he
?
Which
?
''
asked
Petya
in
a
tearful
voice
,
of
those
around
*NL*
him
,
but
no
one
answered
him
,
everybody
was
too
excited
;
and
Petya
,
*NL*
fixing
on
one
of
those
four
men
,
whom
he
could
not
clearly
see
for
the
*NL*
tears
of
joy
that
filled
his
eyes
,
concentrated
all
his
enthusiasm
on
*NL*
him
--
though
it
happened
not
to
be
the
Emperor
--
frantically
shouted
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
resolved
that
tomorrow
,
come
what
might
,
he
would
join
the
*NL*
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
ran
after
the
Emperor
,
followed
him
to
the
palace
,
and
began
*NL*
to
disperse
.
It
was
already
late
,
and
Petya
had
not
eaten
anything
and
*NL*
was
drenched
with
perspiration
,
yet
he
did
not
go
home
but
stood
with
*NL*
that
diminishing
,
but
still
considerable
,
crowd
before
the
palace
while
*NL*
the
Emperor
dined
--
looking
in
at
the
palace
windows
,
expecting
he
knew
*NL*
not
what
,
and
envying
alike
the
notables
he
saw
arriving
at
the
entrance
*NL*
to
dine
with
the
Emperor
and
the
court
footmen
who
served
at
table
,
*NL*
glimpses
of
whom
could
be
seen
through
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
Emperor
was
dining
,
Valuev
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
people
are
still
hoping
to
see
Your
Majesty
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
nearly
over
,
and
the
Emperor
,
munching
a
biscuit
,
rose
*NL*
and
went
out
onto
the
balcony
.
The
people
,
with
Petya
among
them
,
rushed
*NL*
toward
the
balcony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angel
!
Dear
one
!
Hurrah
!
Father
!
...
''
cried
the
crowd
,
and
Petya
with
*NL*
it
,
and
again
the
women
and
men
of
weaker
mold
,
Petya
among
them
,
wept
*NL*
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
largish
piece
of
the
biscuit
the
Emperor
was
holding
in
his
hand
broke
*NL*
off
,
fell
on
the
balcony
parapet
,
and
then
to
the
ground
.
A
coachman
in
*NL*
a
jerkin
,
who
stood
nearest
,
sprang
forward
and
snatched
it
up
.
Several
*NL*
people
in
the
crowd
rushed
at
the
coachman
.
Seeing
this
the
Emperor
had
*NL*
a
plateful
of
biscuits
brought
him
and
began
throwing
them
down
from
the
*NL*
balcony
.
Petya
's
eyes
grew
bloodshot
,
and
still
more
excited
by
the
*NL*
danger
of
being
crushed
,
he
rushed
at
the
biscuits
.
He
did
not
know
why
,
*NL*
but
he
had
to
have
a
biscuit
from
the
Tsar
's
hand
and
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
must
not
give
way
.
He
sprang
forward
and
upset
an
old
woman
who
was
*NL*
catching
at
a
biscuit
;
the
old
woman
did
not
consider
herself
defeated
*NL*
though
she
was
lying
on
the
ground
--
she
grabbed
at
some
biscuits
but
her
*NL*
hand
did
not
reach
them
.
Petya
pushed
her
hand
away
with
his
knee
,
*NL*
seized
a
biscuit
,
and
as
if
fearing
to
be
too
late
,
again
shouted
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
with
a
voice
already
hoarse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
went
in
,
and
after
that
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
began
*NL*
to
disperse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
I
said
if
only
we
waited
--
and
so
it
was
!
''
was
being
joyfully
*NL*
said
by
various
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
as
Petya
was
,
he
felt
sad
at
having
to
go
home
knowing
that
all
*NL*
the
enjoyment
of
that
day
was
over
.
He
did
not
go
straight
home
from
the
*NL*
Kremlin
,
but
called
on
his
friend
Obolenski
,
who
was
fifteen
and
was
*NL*
also
entering
the
regiment
.
On
returning
home
Petya
announced
resolutely
*NL*
and
firmly
that
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
service
he
would
run
*NL*
away
.
And
next
day
,
Count
Ilya
Rostov
--
though
he
had
not
yet
quite
*NL*
yielded
--
went
to
inquire
how
he
could
arrange
for
Petya
to
serve
where
*NL*
there
would
be
least
danger
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
on
the
fifteenth
of
July
,
an
immense
number
of
carriages
*NL*
were
standing
outside
the
Sloboda
Palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
halls
were
full
.
In
the
first
were
the
nobility
and
gentry
in
*NL*
their
uniforms
,
in
the
second
bearded
merchants
in
full-skirted
coats
of
*NL*
blue
cloth
and
wearing
medals
.
In
the
noblemen
's
hall
there
was
an
*NL*
incessant
movement
and
buzz
of
voices
.
The
chief
magnates
sat
on
high
-
*NL*
backed
chairs
at
a
large
table
under
the
portrait
of
the
Emperor
,
but
*NL*
most
of
the
gentry
were
strolling
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
nobles
,
whom
Pierre
met
every
day
at
the
club
or
in
their
own
*NL*
houses
,
were
in
uniform
--
some
in
that
of
Catherine
's
day
,
others
in
that
*NL*
of
Emperor
Paul
,
others
again
in
the
new
uniforms
of
Alexander
's
time
or
*NL*
the
ordinary
uniform
of
the
nobility
,
and
the
general
characteristic
of
*NL*
being
in
uniform
imparted
something
strange
and
fantastic
to
these
*NL*
diverse
and
familiar
personalities
,
both
old
and
young
.
The
old
men
,
*NL*
dim-eyed
,
toothless
,
bald
,
sallow
,
and
bloated
,
or
gaunt
and
wrinkled
,
*NL*
were
especially
striking
.
For
the
most
part
they
sat
quietly
in
their
*NL*
places
and
were
silent
,
or
,
if
they
walked
about
and
talked
,
attached
*NL*
themselves
to
someone
younger
.
On
all
these
faces
,
as
on
the
faces
of
*NL*
the
crowd
Petya
had
seen
in
the
Square
,
there
was
a
striking
*NL*
contradiction
:
the
general
expectation
of
a
solemn
event
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
the
everyday
interests
in
a
boston
card
party
,
Peter
the
cook
,
*NL*
Zinaida
Dmitrievna
's
health
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
there
too
,
buttoned
up
since
early
morning
in
a
nobleman
's
*NL*
uniform
that
had
become
too
tight
for
him
.
He
was
agitated
;
this
*NL*
extraordinary
gathering
not
only
of
nobles
but
also
of
the
merchant
-
*NL*
class
--
les
etats
generaux
-LRB-
States-General
-RRB-
--
evoked
in
him
a
whole
series
*NL*
of
ideas
he
had
long
laid
aside
but
which
were
deeply
graven
in
his
*NL*
soul
:
thoughts
of
the
Contrat
Social
and
the
French
Revolution
.
The
*NL*
words
that
had
struck
him
in
the
Emperor
's
appeal
--
that
the
sovereign
*NL*
was
coming
to
the
capital
for
consultation
with
his
people
--
strengthened
*NL*
this
idea
.
And
imagining
that
in
this
direction
something
important
*NL*
which
he
had
long
awaited
was
drawing
near
,
he
strolled
about
watching
*NL*
and
listening
to
conversations
,
but
nowhere
finding
any
confirmation
of
*NL*
the
ideas
that
occupied
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
's
manifesto
was
read
,
evoking
enthusiasm
,
and
then
all
moved
*NL*
about
discussing
it
.
Besides
the
ordinary
topics
of
conversation
,
Pierre
*NL*
heard
questions
of
where
the
marshals
of
the
nobility
were
to
stand
when
*NL*
the
Emperor
entered
,
when
a
ball
should
be
given
in
the
Emperor
's
honor
,
*NL*
whether
they
should
group
themselves
by
districts
or
by
whole
*NL*
provinces
...
and
so
on
;
but
as
soon
as
the
war
was
touched
on
,
or
what
*NL*
the
nobility
had
been
convened
for
,
the
talk
became
undecided
and
*NL*
indefinite
.
Then
all
preferred
listening
to
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
middle-aged
man
,
handsome
and
virile
,
in
the
uniform
of
a
retired
*NL*
naval
officer
,
was
speaking
in
one
of
the
rooms
,
and
a
small
crowd
was
*NL*
pressing
round
him
.
Pierre
went
up
to
the
circle
that
had
formed
round
*NL*
the
speaker
and
listened
.
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
in
a
military
uniform
of
*NL*
Catherine
's
time
,
was
sauntering
with
a
pleasant
smile
among
the
crowd
,
*NL*
with
all
of
whom
he
was
acquainted
.
He
too
approached
that
group
and
*NL*
listened
with
a
kindly
smile
and
nods
of
approval
,
as
he
always
did
,
to
*NL*
what
the
speaker
was
saying
.
The
retired
naval
man
was
speaking
very
*NL*
boldly
,
as
was
evident
from
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
listeners
*NL*
and
from
the
fact
that
some
people
Pierre
knew
as
the
meekest
and
*NL*
quietest
of
men
walked
away
disapprovingly
or
expressed
disagreement
*NL*
with
him
.
Pierre
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
of
the
group
,
listened
,
*NL*
and
convinced
himself
that
the
man
was
indeed
a
liberal
,
but
of
views
*NL*
quite
different
from
his
own
.
The
naval
officer
spoke
in
a
particularly
*NL*
sonorous
,
musical
,
and
aristocratic
baritone
voice
,
pleasantly
*NL*
swallowing
his
r
's
and
generally
slurring
his
consonants
:
the
voice
of
a
*NL*
man
calling
out
to
his
servant
,
``
Heah
!
Bwing
me
my
pipe
!
''
It
was
*NL*
indicative
of
dissipation
and
the
exercise
of
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
the
Smolensk
people
have
offahd
to
waise
militia
for
the
*NL*
Empewah
?
Ah
we
to
take
Smolensk
as
our
patte
`
n
?
If
the
noble
awistocwacy
*NL*
of
the
pwovince
of
Moscow
thinks
fit
,
it
can
show
its
loyalty
to
our
*NL*
sov
`
weign
the
Empewah
in
other
ways
.
Have
we
fo
`
gotten
the
waising
of
*NL*
the
militia
in
the
yeah
`
seven
?
All
that
did
was
to
enwich
the
pwiests
'
*NL*
sons
and
thieves
and
wobbahs
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Ilya
Rostov
smiled
blandly
and
nodded
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
our
militia
of
any
use
to
the
Empia
?
Not
at
all
!
It
only
wuined
*NL*
our
farming

Bettah

*NL*
The
nobility

n't
gwudge

lives
--
evewy
one
of
us
will
go
and
bwing
*NL*
in
more
wecwuits
,
and
the
sov
`
weign
''
-LRB-
that
was
the
way
he
referred
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
-RRB-
``
need
only
say
the
word
and
we
'll
all
die
fo
'
him
!
''
added
*NL*
the
orator
with
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostov
's
mouth
watered
with
pleasure
and
he
nudged
Pierre
,
but
*NL*
Pierre
wanted
to
speak
himself
.
He
pushed
forward
,
feeling
stirred
,
but
*NL*
not
yet
sure
what
stirred
him
or
what
he
would
say
.
Scarcely
had
he
*NL*
opened
his
mouth
when
one
of
the
senators
,
a
man
without
a
tooth
in
his
*NL*
head
,
with
a
shrewd
though
angry
expression
,
standing
near
the
first
*NL*
speaker
,
interrupted
him
.
Evidently
accustomed
to
managing
debates
and
*NL*
to
maintaining
an
argument
,
he
began
in
low
but
distinct
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
mumbling
with
his
toothless
mouth
,
``
that
we
*NL*
have
been
summoned
here
not
to
discuss
whether
it
's
best
for
the
empire
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
to
adopt
conscription
or
to
call
out
the
militia
.
*NL*
We
have
been
summoned
to
reply
to
the
appeal
with
which
our
sovereign
*NL*
the
Emperor
has
honored
us
.
But
to
judge
what
is
best
--
conscription
or
*NL*
the
militia
--
we
can
leave
to
the
supreme
authority
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
suddenly
saw
an
outlet
for
his
excitement
.
He
hardened
his
heart
*NL*
against
the
senator
who
was
introducing
this
set
and
narrow
attitude
*NL*
into
the
deliberations
of
the
nobility
.
Pierre
stepped
forward
and
*NL*
interrupted
him
.
He
himself
did
not
yet
know
what
he
would
say
,
but
he
*NL*
began
to
speak
eagerly
,
occasionally
lapsing
into
French
or
expressing
*NL*
himself
in
bookish
Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
your
excellency
,
''
he
began
.
-LRB-
He
was
well
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
senator
,
but
thought
it
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
address
him
*NL*
formally
.
-RRB-
``
Though
I
do
n't
agree
with
the
gentleman
...
''
-LRB-
he
hesitated
:
*NL*
he
wished
to
say
,
``
Mon
tres
honorable
preopinant
''
--
``
My
very
honorable
*NL*
opponent
''
-RRB-
``
with
the
gentleman
...
whom
I
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
,
*NL*
I
suppose
that
the
nobility
have
been
summoned
not
merely
to
express
*NL*
their
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
but
also
to
consider
the
means
by
which
we
*NL*
can
assist
our
Fatherland
!
I
imagine
,
''
he
went
on
,
warming
to
his
*NL*
subject
,
``
that
the
Emperor
himself
would
not
be
satisfied
to
find
in
us
*NL*
merely
owners
of
serfs
whom
we
are
willing
to
devote
to
his
service
,
and
*NL*
chair
a
canon
*
we
are
ready
to
make
of
ourselves
--
and
not
to
obtain
*NL*
from
us
any
co-co-counsel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Food
for
cannon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
persons
withdrew
from
the
circle
,
noticing
the
senator
's
sarcastic
*NL*
smile
and
the
freedom
of
Pierre
's
remarks
.
Only
Count
Rostov
was
pleased
*NL*
with
them
as
he
had
been
pleased
with
those
of
the
naval
officer
,
the
*NL*
senator
,
and
in
general
with
whatever
speech
he
had
last
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
before
discussing
these
questions
,
''
Pierre
continued
,
``
we
*NL*
should
ask
the
Emperor
--
most
respectfully
ask
His
Majesty
--
to
let
us
*NL*
know
the
number
of
our
troops
and
the
position
in
which
our
army
and
our
*NL*
forces
now
are
,
and
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
scarcely
had
Pierre
uttered
these
words
before
he
was
attacked
from
*NL*
three
sides
.
The
most
vigorous
attack
came
from
an
old
acquaintance
,
a
*NL*
boston
player
who
had
always
been
well
disposed
toward
him
,
Stepan
*NL*
Stepanovich
Adraksin
.
Adraksin
was
in
uniform
,
and
whether
as
a
result
*NL*
of
the
uniform
or
from
some
other
cause
Pierre
saw
before
him
quite
a
*NL*
different
man
.
With
a
sudden
expression
of
malevolence
on
his
aged
face
,
*NL*
Adraksin
shouted
at
Pierre
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
tell
you
we
have
no
right
to
question
the
Emperor
*NL*
about
that
,
and
secondly
,
if
the
Russian
nobility
had
that
right
,
the
*NL*
Emperor
could
not
answer
such
a
question
.
The
troops
are
moved
according
*NL*
to
the
enemy
's
movements
and
the
number
of
men
increases
and
*NL*
decreases
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
voice
,
that
of
a
nobleman
of
medium
height
and
about
forty
years
*NL*
of
age
,
whom
Pierre
had
formerly
met
at
the
gypsies
'
and
knew
as
a
bad
*NL*
cardplayer
,
and
who
,
also
transformed
by
his
uniform
,
came
up
to
Pierre
,
*NL*
interrupted
Adraksin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
this
is
not
a
time
for
discussing
,
''
he
continued
,
``
but
for
*NL*
acting
:
there
is
war
in
Russia
!
The
enemy
is
advancing
to
destroy
*NL*
Russia
,
to
desecrate
the
tombs
of
our
fathers
,
to
carry
off
our
wives
*NL*
and
children
.
''
The
nobleman
smote
his
breast
.
``
We
will
all
arise
,
every
*NL*
one
of
us
will
go
,
for
our
father
the
Tsar
!
''
he
shouted
,
rolling
his
*NL*
bloodshot
eyes
.
Several
approving
voices
were
heard
in
the
crowd
.
``
We
*NL*
are
Russians
and
will
not
grudge
our
blood
in
defense
of
our
faith
,
the
*NL*
throne
,
and
the
Fatherland
!
We
must
cease
raving
if
we
are
sons
of
our
*NL*
Fatherland
!
We
will
show
Europe
how
Russia
rises
to
the
defense
of
*NL*
Russia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
reply
,
but
could
not
get
in
a
word
.
He
felt
that
his
*NL*
words
,
apart
from
what
meaning
they
conveyed
,
were
less
audible
than
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
opponent
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostov
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
was
expressing
approval
;
several
*NL*
persons
,
briskly
turning
a
shoulder
to
the
orator
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
phrase
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
quite
right
!
Just
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
money
,
his
*NL*
serfs
,
or
himself
,
only
one
ought
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
in
order
*NL*
to
be
able
to
improve
it
,
but
he
was
unable
to
speak
.
Many
voices
*NL*
shouted
and
talked
at
the
same
time
,
so
that
Count
Rostov
had
not
time
*NL*
to
signify
his
approval
of
them
all
,
and
the
group
increased
,
dispersed
,
*NL*
re-formed
,
and
then
moved
with
a
hum
of
talk
into
the
largest
hall
and
*NL*
to
the
big
table
.
Not
only
was
Pierre
's
attempt
to
speak
unsuccessful
,
*NL*
but
he
was
rudely
interrupted
,
pushed
aside
,
and
people
turned
away
from
*NL*
him
as
from
a
common
enemy
.
This
happened
not
because
they
were
*NL*
displeased
by
the
substance
of
his
speech
,
which
had
even
been
forgotten
*NL*
after
the
many
subsequent
speeches
,
but
to
animate
it
the
crowd
needed
a
*NL*
tangible
object
to
love
and
a
tangible
object
to
hate
.
Pierre
became
the
*NL*
latter
.
Many
other
orators
spoke
after
the
excited
nobleman
,
and
all
in
*NL*
the
same
tone
.
Many
spoke
eloquently
and
with
originality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glinka
,
the
editor
of
the
Russian
Messenger
,
who
was
recognized
-LRB-
cries
*NL*
of
``
author
!
author
!
''
were
heard
in
the
crowd
-RRB-
,
said
that
``
hell
must
be
*NL*
repulsed
by
hell
,
''
and
that
he
had
seen
a
child
smiling
at
lightning
*NL*
flashes
and
thunderclaps
,
but
``
we
will
not
be
that
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
at
thunderclaps
!
''
was
repeated
approvingly
in
the
back
rows
*NL*
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
drew
up
to
the
large
table
,
at
which
sat
gray-haired
or
bald
*NL*
seventy-year-old
magnates
,
uniformed
and
besashed
almost
all
of
whom
*NL*
Pierre
had
seen
in
their
own
homes
with
their
buffoons
,
or
playing
*NL*
boston
at
the
clubs
.
With
an
incessant
hum
of
voices
the
crowd
advanced
*NL*
to
the
table
.
Pressed
by
the
throng
against
the
high
backs
of
the
*NL*
chairs
,
the
orators
spoke
one
after
another
and
sometimes
two
together
.
*NL*
Those
standing
behind
noticed
what
a
speaker
omitted
to
say
and
hastened
*NL*
to
supply
it
.
Others
in
that
heat
and
crush
racked
their
brains
to
find
*NL*
some
thought
and
hastened
to
utter
it
.
The
old
magnates
,
whom
Pierre
*NL*
knew
,
sat
and
turned
to
look
first
at
one
and
then
at
another
,
and
their
*NL*
faces
for
the
most
part
only
expressed
the
fact
that
they
found
it
very
*NL*
hot
.
Pierre
,
however
,
felt
excited
,
and
the
general
desire
to
show
that
*NL*
they
were
ready
to
go
to
all
lengths
--
which
found
expression
in
the
*NL*
tones
and
looks
more
than
in
the
substance
of
the
speeches
--
infected
him
*NL*
too
.
He
did
not
renounce
his
opinions
,
but
felt
himself
in
some
way
to
*NL*
blame
and
wished
to
justify
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
said
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
make
sacrifices
*NL*
when
we
know
what
is
needed
!
''
said
he
,
trying
to
be
heard
above
the
*NL*
other
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
old
men
nearest
to
him
looked
round
,
but
his
attention
was
*NL*
immediately
diverted
by
an
exclamation
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Moscow
will
be
surrendered
!
She
will
be
our
expiation
!
''
shouted
*NL*
one
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
enemy
of
mankind
!
''
cried
another
.
``
Allow
me
to
speak
...
''
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
you
are
crushing
me
!
...

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Count
Rostopchin
with
his
protruding
chin
and
alert
eyes
,
*NL*
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
general
with
sash
over
his
shoulder
,
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
stepping
briskly
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
of
gentry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
sovereign
the
Emperor
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
''
said
Rostopchin
.
*NL*
``
I
am
straight
from
the
palace
.
Seeing
the
position
we
are
in
,
I
think
*NL*
there
is
little
need
for
discussion
.
The
Emperor
has
deigned
to
summon
*NL*
us
and
the
merchants
.
Millions
will
pour
forth
from
there
''
--
he
pointed
*NL*
to
the
merchants
'
hall
--
``
but
our
business
is
to
supply
men
and
not
spare
*NL*
ourselves
...
That
is
the
least
we
can
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
conference
took
place
confined
to
the
magnates
sitting
at
the
table
.
*NL*
The
whole
consultation
passed
more
than
quietly
.
After
all
the
preceding
*NL*
noise
the
sound
of
their
old
voices
saying
one
after
another
,
``
I
agree
,
''
*NL*
or
for
variety
,
``
I
too
am
of
that
opinion
,
''
and
so
on
had
even
a
*NL*
mournful
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
secretary
was
told
to
write
down
the
resolution
of
the
Moscow
*NL*
nobility
and
gentry
,
that
they
would
furnish
ten
men
,
fully
equipped
,
*NL*
out
of
every
thousand
serfs
,
as
the
Smolensk
gentry
had
done
.
Their
*NL*
chairs
made
a
scraping
noise
as
the
gentlemen
who
had
conferred
rose
*NL*
with
apparent
relief
,
and
began
walking
up
and
down
,
arm
in
arm
,
to
*NL*
stretch
their
legs
and
converse
in
couples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
!
The
Emperor
!
''
a
sudden
cry
resounded
through
the
halls
and
*NL*
the
whole
throng
hurried
to
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
entered
the
hall
through
a
broad
path
between
two
lines
of
*NL*
nobles
.
Every
face
expressed
respectful
,
awe-struck
curiosity
.
Pierre
*NL*
stood
rather
far
off
and
could
not
hear
all
that
the
Emperor
said
.
From
*NL*
what
he
did
hear
he
understood
that
the
Emperor
spoke
of
the
danger
*NL*
threatening
the
empire
and
of
the
hopes
he
placed
on
the
Moscow
*NL*
nobility
.
He
was
answered
by
a
voice
which
informed
him
of
the
*NL*
resolution
just
arrived
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
!
''
said
the
Emperor
with
a
quivering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustling
among
the
crowd
and
it
again
subsided
,
so
that
*NL*
Pierre
distinctly
heard
the
pleasantly
human
voice
of
the
Emperor
saying
*NL*
with
emotion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
doubted
the
devotion
of
the
Russian
nobles
,
but
today
it
has
*NL*
surpassed
my
expectations
.
I
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
Fatherland
!
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
let
us
act
!
Time
is
most
precious
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
ceased
speaking
,
the
crowd
began
pressing
round
him
,
and
*NL*
rapturous
exclamations
were
heard
from
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
most
precious
...
a
royal
word
,
''
said
Count
Rostov
,
with
a
sob
.
He
*NL*
stood
at
the
back
,
and
,
though
he
had
heard
hardly
anything
,
understood
*NL*
everything
in
his
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
hall
of
the
nobility
the
Emperor
went
to
that
of
the
merchants
.
*NL*
There
he
remained
about
ten
minutes
.
Pierre
was
among
those
who
saw
him
*NL*
come
out
from
the
merchants
'
hall
with
tears
of
emotion
in
his
eyes
.
As
*NL*
became
known
later
,
he
had
scarcely
begun
to
address
the
merchants
*NL*
before
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
he
concluded
in
a
trembling
voice
.
*NL*
When
Pierre
saw
the
Emperor
he
was
coming
out
accompanied
by
two
*NL*
merchants
,
one
of
whom
Pierre
knew
,
a
fat
otkupshchik
.
The
other
was
the
*NL*
mayor
,
a
man
with
a
thin
sallow
face
and
narrow
beard
.
Both
were
*NL*
weeping
.
Tears
filled
the
thin
man
's
eyes
,
and
the
fat
otkupshchik
*NL*
sobbed
outright
like
a
child
and
kept
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
lives
and
property
--
take
them
,
Your
Majesty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
one
feeling
at
the
moment
was
a
desire
to
show
that
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
go
all
lengths
and
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
everything
.
He
now
*NL*
felt
ashamed
of
his
speech
with
its
constitutional
tendency
and
sought
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
effacing
it
.
Having
heard
that
Count
Mamonov
was
*NL*
furnishing
a
regiment
,
Bezukhov
at
once
informed
Rostopchin
that
he
*NL*
would
give
a
thousand
men
and
their
maintenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Rostov
could
not
tell
his
wife
of
what
had
passed
without
tears
,
and
*NL*
at
once
consented
to
Petya
's
request
and
went
himself
to
enter
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
Emperor
left
Moscow
.
The
assembled
nobles
all
took
off
*NL*
their
uniforms
and
settled
down
again
in
their
homes
and
clubs
,
and
not
*NL*
without
some
groans
gave
orders
to
their
stewards
about
the
enrollment
,
*NL*
feeling
amazed
themselves
at
what
they
had
done
.

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
began
the
war
with
Russia
because
he
could
not
resist
going
to
*NL*
Dresden
,
could
not
help
having
his
head
turned
by
the
homage
he
*NL*
received
,
could
not
help
donning
a
Polish
uniform
and
yielding
to
the
*NL*
stimulating
influence
of
a
June
morning
,
and
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
bursts
of
anger
in
the
presence
of
Kurakin
and
then
of
Balashev
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
refused
negotiations
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
personally
*NL*
insulted
.
Barclay
de
Tolly
tried
to
command
the
army
in
the
best
way
,
*NL*
because
he
wished
to
fulfill
his
duty
and
earn
fame
as
a
great
*NL*
commander
.
Rostov
charged
the
French
because
he
could
not
restrain
his
*NL*
wish
for
a
gallop
across
a
level
field
;
and
in
the
same
way
the
*NL*
innumerable
people
who
took
part
in
the
war
acted
in
accord
with
their
*NL*
personal
characteristics
,
habits
,
circumstances
,
and
aims
.
They
were
*NL*
moved
by
fear
or
vanity
,
rejoiced
or
were
indignant
,
reasoned
,
imagining
*NL*
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
did
it
of
their
own
free
will
,
*NL*
but
they
all
were
involuntary
tools
of
history
,
carrying
on
a
work
*NL*
concealed
from
them
but
comprehensible
to
us
.
Such
is
the
inevitable
*NL*
fate
of
men
of
action
,
and
the
higher
they
stand
in
the
social
hierarchy
*NL*
the
less
are
they
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
actors
of
1812
have
long
since
left
the
stage
,
their
personal
*NL*
interests
have
vanished
leaving
no
trace
,
and
nothing
remains
of
that
*NL*
time
but
its
historic
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Providence
compelled
all
these
men
,
striving
to
attain
personal
aims
,
to
*NL*
further
the
accomplishment
of
a
stupendous
result
no
one
of
them
at
all
*NL*
expected
--
neither
Napoleon
,
nor
Alexander
,
nor
still
less
any
of
those
*NL*
who
did
the
actual
fighting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
French
army
in
1812
is
clear
to
us
*NL*
now
.
No
one
will
deny
that
that
cause
was
,
on
the
one
hand
,
its
advance
*NL*
into
the
heart
of
Russia
late
in
the
season
without
any
preparation
for
*NL*
a
winter
campaign
and
,
on
the
other
,
the
character
given
to
the
war
by
*NL*
the
burning
of
Russian
towns
and
the
hatred
of
the
foe
this
aroused
*NL*
among
the
Russian
people
.
But
no
one
at
the
time
foresaw
-LRB-
what
now
seems
*NL*
so
evident
-RRB-
that
this
was
the
only
way
an
army
of
eight
hundred
thousand
*NL*
men
--
the
best
in
the
world
and
led
by
the
best
general
--
could
be
*NL*
destroyed
in
conflict
with
a
raw
army
of
half
its
numerical
strength
,
*NL*
and
led
by
inexperienced
commanders
as
the
Russian
army
was
.
Not
only
*NL*
did
no
one
see
this
,
but
on
the
Russian
side
every
effort
was
made
to
*NL*
hinder
the
only
thing
that
could
save
Russia
,
while
on
the
French
side
,
*NL*
despite
Napoleon
's
experience
and
so-called
military
genius
,
every
*NL*
effort
was
directed
to
pushing
on
to
Moscow
at
the
end
of
the
summer
,
*NL*
that
is
,
to
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
bound
to
lead
to
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
historical
works
on
the
year
1812
French
writers
are
very
fond
of
*NL*
saying
that
Napoleon
felt
the
danger
of
extending
his
line
,
that
he
*NL*
sought
a
battle
and
that
his
marshals
advised
him
to
stop
at
Smolensk
,
*NL*
and
of
making
similar
statements
to
show
that
the
danger
of
the
campaign
*NL*
was
even
then
understood
.
Russian
authors
are
still
fonder
of
telling
us
*NL*
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
a
Scythian
war
plan
was
*NL*
adopted
to
lure
Napoleon
into
the
depths
of
Russia
,
and
this
plan
some
*NL*
of
them
attribute
to
Pfuel
,
others
to
a
certain
Frenchman
,
others
to
*NL*
Toll
,
and
others
again
to
Alexander
himself
--
pointing
to
notes
,
*NL*
projects
,
and
letters
which
contain
hints
of
such
a
line
of
action
.
But
*NL*
all
these
hints
at
what
happened
,
both
from
the
French
side
and
the
*NL*
Russian
,
are
advanced
only
because
they
fit
in
with
the
event
.
Had
that
*NL*
event
not
occurred
these
hints
would
have
been
forgotten
,
as
we
have
*NL*
forgotten
the
thousands
and
millions
of
hints
and
expectations
to
the
*NL*
contrary
which
were
current
then
but
have
now
been
forgotten
because
the
*NL*
event
falsified
them
.
There
are
always
so
many
conjectures
as
to
the
*NL*
issue
of
any
event
that
however
it
may
end
there
will
always
be
people
*NL*
to
say
:
``
I
said
then
that
it
would
be
so
,
''
quite
forgetting
that
amid
*NL*
their
innumerable
conjectures
many
were
to
quite
the
contrary
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conjectures
as
to
Napoleon
's
awareness
of
the
danger
of
extending
his
*NL*
line
,
and
-LRB-
on
the
Russian
side
-RRB-
as
to
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
*NL*
of
Russia
,
are
evidently
of
that
kind
,
and
only
by
much
straining
can
*NL*
historians
attribute
such
conceptions
to
Napoleon
and
his
marshals
,
or
*NL*
such
plans
to
the
Russian
commanders
.
All
the
facts
are
in
flat
*NL*
contradiction
to
such
conjectures
.
During
the
whole
period
of
the
war
*NL*
not
only
was
there
no
wish
on
the
Russian
side
to
draw
the
French
into
*NL*
the
heart
of
the
country
,
but
from
their
first
entry
into
Russia
*NL*
everything
was
done
to
stop
them
.
And
not
only
was
Napoleon
not
afraid
*NL*
to
extend
his
line
,
but
he
welcomed
every
step
forward
as
a
triumph
and
*NL*
did
not
seek
battle
as
eagerly
as
in
former
campaigns
,
but
very
lazily
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
our
armies
were
divided
,
and
our
sole
*NL*
aim
was
to
unite
them
,
though
uniting
the
armies
was
no
advantage
if
we
*NL*
meant
to
retire
and
lure
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
the
country
.
Our
*NL*
Emperor
joined
the
army
to
encourage
it
to
defend
every
inch
of
Russian
*NL*
soil
and
not
to
retreat
.
The
enormous
Drissa
camp
was
formed
on
Pfuel
's
*NL*
plan
,
and
there
was
no
intention
of
retiring
farther
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
reproached
the
commanders
in
chief
for
every
step
they
retired
.
He
could
*NL*
not
bear
the
idea
of
letting
the
enemy
even
reach
Smolensk
,
still
less
*NL*
could
he
contemplate
the
burning
of
Moscow
,
and
when
our
armies
did
*NL*
unite
he
was
displeased
that
Smolensk
was
abandoned
and
burned
without
a
*NL*
general
engagement
having
been
fought
under
its
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
thought
the
Emperor
,
and
the
Russian
commanders
and
people
were
still
*NL*
more
provoked
at
the
thought
that
our
forces
were
retreating
into
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
apart
advanced
far
into
the
country
and
*NL*
missed
several
chances
of
forcing
an
engagement
.
In
August
he
was
at
*NL*
Smolensk
and
thought
only
of
how
to
advance
farther
,
though
as
we
now
*NL*
see
that
advance
was
evidently
ruinous
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facts
clearly
show
that
Napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
of
the
*NL*
advance
on
Moscow
,
nor
did
Alexander
and
the
Russian
commanders
then
*NL*
think
of
luring
Napoleon
on
,
but
quite
the
contrary
.
The
luring
of
*NL*
Napoleon
into
the
depths
of
the
country
was
not
the
result
of
any
plan
,
*NL*
for
no
one
believed
it
to
be
possible
;
it
resulted
from
a
most
complex
*NL*
interplay
of
intrigues
,
aims
,
and
wishes
among
those
who
took
part
in
*NL*
the
war
and
had
no
perception
whatever
of
the
inevitable
,
or
of
the
one
*NL*
way
of
saving
Russia
.
Everything
came
about
fortuitously
.
The
armies
*NL*
were
divided
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
.
We
tried
to
unite
*NL*
them
,
with
the
evident
intention
of
giving
battle
and
checking
the
*NL*
enemy
's
advance
,
and
by
this
effort
to
unite
them
while
avoiding
battle
*NL*
with
a
much
stronger
enemy
,
and
necessarily
withdrawing
the
armies
at
an
*NL*
acute
angle
--
we
led
the
French
on
to
Smolensk
.
But
we
withdrew
at
an
*NL*
acute
angle
not
only
because
the
French
advanced
between
our
two
armies
;
*NL*
the
angle
became
still
more
acute
and
we
withdrew
still
farther
,
because
*NL*
Barclay
de
Tolly
was
an
unpopular
foreigner
disliked
by
Bagration
-LRB-
who
*NL*
would
come
under
his
command
-RRB-
,
and
Bagration
--
being
in
command
of
the
*NL*
second
army
--
tried
to
postpone
joining
up
and
coming
under
Barclay
's
*NL*
command
as
long
as
he
could
.
Bagration
was
slow
in
effecting
the
*NL*
junction
--
though
that
was
the
chief
aim
of
all
at
headquarters
--
because
,
*NL*
as
he
alleged
,
he
exposed
his
army
to
danger
on
this
march
,
and
it
was
*NL*
best
for
him
to
retire
more
to
the
left
and
more
to
the
south
,
worrying
*NL*
the
enemy
from
flank
and
rear
and
securing
from
the
Ukraine
recruits
for
*NL*
his
army
;
and
it
looks
as
if
he
planned
this
in
order
not
to
come
under
*NL*
the
command
of
the
detested
foreigner
Barclay
,
whose
rank
was
inferior
*NL*
to
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
was
with
the
army
to
encourage
it
,
but
his
presence
and
*NL*
ignorance
of
what
steps
to
take
,
and
the
enormous
number
of
advisers
and
*NL*
plans
,
destroyed
the
first
army
's
energy
and
it
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intention
was
to
make
a
stand
at
the
Drissa
camp
,
but
Paulucci
,
*NL*
aiming
at
becoming
commander-in-chief
,
unexpectedly
employed
his
energy
*NL*
to
influence
Alexander
,
and
Pfuel
's
whole
plan
was
abandoned
and
the
*NL*
command
entrusted
to
Barclay
.
But
as
Barclay
did
not
inspire
confidence
*NL*
his
power
was
limited
.
The
armies
were
divided
,
there
was
no
unity
of
*NL*
command
,
and
Barclay
was
unpopular
;
but
from
this
confusion
,
division
,
*NL*
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
foreign
commander-in-chief
,
there
resulted
*NL*
on
the
one
hand
indecision
and
the
avoidance
of
a
battle
-LRB-
which
we
could
*NL*
not
have
refrained
from
had
the
armies
been
united
and
had
someone
else
,
*NL*
instead
of
Barclay
,
been
in
command
-RRB-
and
on
the
other
an
ever-increasing
*NL*
indignation
against
the
foreigners
and
an
increase
in
patriotic
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Emperor
left
the
army
,
and
as
the
most
convenient
and
indeed
*NL*
the
only
pretext
for
his
departure
it
was
decided
that
it
was
necessary
*NL*
for
him
to
inspire
the
people
in
the
capitals
and
arouse
the
nation
in
*NL*
general
to
a
patriotic
war
.
And
by
this
visit
of
the
Emperor
to
Moscow
*NL*
the
strength
of
the
Russian
army
was
trebled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
in
order
not
to
obstruct
the
commander-in-chief
's
undivided
*NL*
control
of
the
army
,
and
hoping
that
more
decisive
action
would
then
be
*NL*
taken
,
but
the
command
of
the
armies
became
still
more
confused
and
*NL*
enfeebled
.
Bennigsen
,
the
Tsarevich
,
and
a
swarm
of
adjutants
general
*NL*
remained
with
the
army
to
keep
the
commander-in-chief
under
observation
*NL*
and
arouse
his
energy
,
and
Barclay
,
feeling
less
free
than
ever
under
*NL*
the
observation
of
all
these
``
eyes
of
the
Emperor
,
''
became
still
more
*NL*
cautious
of
undertaking
any
decisive
action
and
avoided
giving
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barclay
stood
for
caution
.
The
Tsarevich
hinted
at
treachery
and
*NL*
demanded
a
general
engagement
.
Lubomirski
,
Bronnitski
,
Wlocki
,
and
the
*NL*
others
of
that
group
stirred
up
so
much
trouble
that
Barclay
,
under
*NL*
pretext
of
sending
papers
to
the
Emperor
,
dispatched
these
Polish
*NL*
adjutants
general
to
Petersburg
and
plunged
into
an
open
struggle
with
*NL*
Bennigsen
and
the
Tsarevich
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Smolensk
the
armies
at
last
reunited
,
much
as
Bagration
disliked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bagration
drove
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
occupied
by
Barclay
.
*NL*
Barclay
donned
his
sash
and
came
out
to
meet
and
report
to
his
senior
*NL*
officer
Bagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
his
seniority
in
rank
Bagration
,
in
this
contest
of
magnanimity
,
*NL*
took
his
orders
from
Barclay
,
but
,
having
submitted
,
agreed
with
him
*NL*
less
than
ever
.
By
the
Emperor
's
orders
Bagration
reported
direct
to
*NL*
him
.
He
wrote
to
Arakcheev
,
the
Emperor
's
confidant
:
``
It
must
be
as
my
*NL*
sovereign
pleases
,
but
I
can
not
work
with
the
Minister
-LRB-
meaning
*NL*
Barclay
-RRB-
.
For
God
's
sake
send
me
somewhere
else
if
only
in
command
of
a
*NL*
regiment
.
I
can
not
stand
it
here
.
Headquarters
are
so
full
of
Germans
*NL*
that
a
Russian
can
not
exist
and
there
is
no
sense
in
anything
.
I
thought
*NL*
I
was
really
serving
my
sovereign
and
the
Fatherland
,
but
it
turns
out
*NL*
that
I
am
serving
Barclay
.
I
confess
I
do
not
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
swarm
of
Bronnitskis
and
Wintzingerodes
and
their
like
still
further
*NL*
embittered
the
relations
between
the
commanders
in
chief
,
and
even
less
*NL*
unity
resulted
.
Preparations
were
made
to
fight
the
French
before
*NL*
Smolensk
.
A
general
was
sent
to
survey
the
position
.
This
general
,
*NL*
hating
Barclay
,
rode
to
visit
a
friend
of
his
own
,
a
corps
commander
,
*NL*
and
,
having
spent
the
day
with
him
,
returned
to
Barclay
and
condemned
,
*NL*
as
unsuitable
from
every
point
of
view
,
the
battleground
he
had
not
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
disputes
and
intrigues
were
going
on
about
the
future
field
of
*NL*
battle
,
and
while
we
were
looking
for
the
French
--
having
lost
touch
with
*NL*
them
--
the
French
stumbled
upon
Neverovski
's
division
and
reached
the
*NL*
walls
of
Smolensk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
fight
an
unexpected
battle
at
Smolensk
to
save
our
*NL*
lines
of
communication
.
The
battle
was
fought
and
thousands
were
killed
*NL*
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smolensk
was
abandoned
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
Emperor
and
of
the
*NL*
whole
people
.
But
Smolensk
was
burned
by
its
own
inhabitants-who
had
*NL*
been
misled
by
their
governor
.
And
these
ruined
inhabitants
,
setting
an
*NL*
example
to
other
Russians
,
went
to
Moscow
thinking
only
of
their
own
*NL*
losses
but
kindling
hatred
of
the
foe
.
Napoleon
advanced
farther
and
we
*NL*
retired
,
thus
arriving
at
the
very
result
which
caused
his
destruction
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
son
had
left
,
Prince
Nicholas
sent
for
Princess
Mary
*NL*
to
come
to
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
Are
you
satisfied
now
?
''
said
he
.
``
You
've
made
me
quarrel
with
my
*NL*
son
!
Satisfied
,
are
you
?
That
's
all
you
wanted
!
Satisfied
?
...
It
hurts
*NL*
me
,
it
hurts
.
I
'm
old
and
weak
and
this
is
what
you
wanted
.
Well
then
,
*NL*
gloat
over
it
!
Gloat
over
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Princess
Mary
did
not
see
her
father
for
a
whole
week
.
He
was
*NL*
ill
and
did
not
leave
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
noticed
to
her
surprise
that
during
this
illness
the
old
*NL*
prince
not
only
excluded
her
from
his
room
,
but
did
not
admit
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
either
.
Tikhon
alone
attended
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
week
the
prince
reappeared
and
resumed
his
former
way
*NL*
of
life
,
devoting
himself
with
special
activity
to
building
operations
*NL*
and
the
arrangement
of
the
gardens
and
completely
breaking
off
his
*NL*
relations
with
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
His
looks
and
cold
tone
to
his
*NL*
daughter
seemed
to
say
:
``
There
,
you
see
?
You
plotted
against
me
,
you
*NL*
lied
to
Prince
Andrew
about
my
relations
with
that
Frenchwoman
and
made
*NL*
me
quarrel
with
him
,
but
you
see
I
need
neither
her
nor
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
spent
half
of
every
day
with
little
Nicholas
,
watching
his
*NL*
lessons
,
teaching
him
Russian
and
music
herself
,
and
talking
to
*NL*
Dessalles
;
the
rest
of
the
day
she
spent
over
her
books
,
with
her
old
*NL*
nurse
,
or
with
``
God
's
folk
''
who
sometimes
came
by
the
back
door
to
see
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
war
Princess
Mary
thought
as
women
do
think
about
wars
.
She
*NL*
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
in
it
,
was
horrified
by
and
amazed
at
the
*NL*
strange
cruelty
that
impels
men
to
kill
one
another
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
the
significance
of
this
war
,
which
seemed
to
her
like
all
*NL*
previous
wars
.
She
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
war
,
though
*NL*
Dessalles
with
whom
she
constantly
conversed
was
passionately
interested
*NL*
in
its
progress
and
tried
to
explain
his
own
conception
of
it
to
her
,
*NL*
and
though
the
``
God
's
folk
''
who
came
to
see
her
reported
,
in
their
own
*NL*
way
,
the
rumors
current
among
the
people
of
an
invasion
by
Antichrist
,
*NL*
and
though
Julie
-LRB-
now
Princess
Drubetskaya
-RRB-
,
who
had
resumed
*NL*
correspondence
with
her
,
wrote
patriotic
letters
from
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
write
you
in
Russian
,
my
good
friend
,
''
wrote
Julie
in
her
Frenchified
*NL*
Russian
,
``
because
I
have
a
detestation
for
all
the
French
,
and
the
same
*NL*
for
their
language
which
I
can
not
support
to
hear
spoken
...
We
in
*NL*
Moscow
are
elated
by
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
husband
is
enduring
pains
and
hunger
in
Jewish
taverns
,
but
the
*NL*
news
which
I
have
inspires
me
yet
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
heard
probably
of
the
heroic
exploit
of
Raevski
,
embracing
his
two
*NL*
sons
and
saying
:
'
I
will
perish
with
them
but
we
will
not
be
shaken
!
'
*NL*
And
truly
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
than
we
,
we
were
*NL*
unshakable
.
We
pass
the
time
as
we
can
,
but
in
war
as
in
war
!
The
*NL*
princesses
Aline
and
Sophie
sit
whole
days
with
me
,
and
we
,
unhappy
*NL*
widows
of
live
men
,
make
beautiful
conversations
over
our
`
charpie
'
,
*NL*
only
you
,
my
friend
,
are
missing
...
''
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
reason
Princess
Mary
did
not
realize
the
full
significance
of
*NL*
this
war
was
that
the
old
prince
never
spoke
of
it
,
did
not
recognize
*NL*
it
,
and
laughed
at
Dessalles
when
he
mentioned
it
at
dinner
.
The
*NL*
prince
's
tone
was
so
calm
and
confident
that
Princess
Mary
*NL*
unhesitatingly
believed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
July
the
old
prince
was
exceedingly
active
and
even
animated
.
*NL*
He
planned
another
garden
and
began
a
new
building
for
the
domestic
*NL*
serfs
.
The
only
thing
that
made
Princess
Mary
anxious
about
him
was
that
*NL*
he
slept
very
little
and
,
instead
of
sleeping
in
his
study
as
usual
,
*NL*
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
day
.
One
day
he
would
order
his
camp
*NL*
bed
to
be
set
up
in
the
glass
gallery
,
another
day
he
remained
on
the
*NL*
couch
or
on
the
lounge
chair
in
the
drawing
room
and
dozed
there
without
*NL*
undressing
,
while
--
instead
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
--
a
serf
boy
read
to
*NL*
him
.
Then
again
he
would
spend
a
night
in
the
dining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
August
1
,
a
second
letter
was
received
from
Prince
Andrew
.
In
his
*NL*
first
letter
which
came
soon
after
he
had
left
home
,
Prince
Andrew
had
*NL*
dutifully
asked
his
father
's
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
allowed
himself
*NL*
to
say
and
begged
to
be
restored
to
his
favor
.
To
this
letter
the
old
*NL*
prince
had
replied
affectionately
,
and
from
that
time
had
kept
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
at
a
distance
.
Prince
Andrew
's
second
letter
,
written
near
*NL*
Vitebsk
after
the
French
had
occupied
that
town
,
gave
a
brief
account
of
*NL*
the
whole
campaign
,
enclosed
for
them
a
plan
he
had
drawn
and
forecasts
*NL*
as
to
the
further
progress
of
the
war
.
In
this
letter
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
pointed
out
to
his
father
the
danger
of
staying
at
Bald
Hills
,
so
near
*NL*
the
theater
of
war
and
on
the
army
's
direct
line
of
march
,
and
advised
*NL*
him
to
move
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
that
day
,
on
Dessalles
'
mentioning
that
the
French
were
said
*NL*
to
have
already
entered
Vitebsk
,
the
old
prince
remembered
his
son
's
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
letter
from
Prince
Andrew
today
,
''
he
said
to
Princess
Mary
-
*NL*
-
``
Have
n't
you
read
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Father
,
''
she
replied
in
a
frightened
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
have
read
the
letter
as
she
did
not
even
know
it
had
*NL*
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
writes
about
this
war
,
''
said
the
prince
,
with
the
ironic
smile
that
*NL*
had
become
habitual
to
him
in
speaking
of
the
present
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
very
interesting
,
''
said
Dessalles
.
``
Prince
Andrew
is
in
a
*NL*
position
to
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
interesting
!
''
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
get
it
for
me
,
''
said
the
old
prince
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
*NL*
``
You
know
--
under
the
paperweight
on
the
little
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
jumped
up
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
!
''
he
exclaimed
with
a
frown
.
``
You
go
,
Michael
Ivanovich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Michael
Ivanovich
rose
and
went
to
the
study
.
But
as
soon
as
he
had
left
*NL*
the
room
the
old
prince
,
looking
uneasily
round
,
threw
down
his
napkin
*NL*
and
went
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
do
anything
...
always
make
some
muddle
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
away
Princess
Mary
,
Dessalles
,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
and
*NL*
even
little
Nicholas
exchanged
looks
in
silence
.
The
old
prince
returned
*NL*
with
quick
steps
,
accompanied
by
Michael
Ivanovich
,
bringing
the
letter
*NL*
and
a
plan
.
These
he
put
down
beside
him
--
not
letting
anyone
read
them
*NL*
at
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
moving
to
the
drawing
room
he
handed
the
letter
to
Princess
Mary
and
,
*NL*
spreading
out
before
him
the
plan
of
the
new
building
and
fixing
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
it
,
told
her
to
read
the
letter
aloud
.
When
she
had
done
so
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
inquiringly
at
her
father
.
He
was
examining
the
*NL*
plan
,
evidently
engrossed
in
his
own
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
it
,
Prince
?
''
Dessalles
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
?
...
''
said
the
prince
as
if
unpleasantly
awakened
,
and
not
taking
*NL*
his
eyes
from
the
plan
of
the
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
the
theater
of
war
will
move
so
near
to
us
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
ha
ha
!
The
theater
of
war
!
''
said
the
prince
.
``
I
have
said
and
still
*NL*
say
that
the
theater
of
war
is
Poland
and
the
enemy
will
never
get
*NL*
beyond
the
Niemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dessalles
looked
in
amazement
at
the
prince
,
who
was
talking
of
the
*NL*
Niemen
when
the
enemy
was
already
at
the
Dnieper
,
but
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
forgetting
the
geographical
position
of
the
Niemen
,
thought
that
what
*NL*
her
father
was
saying
was
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
snow
melts
they
'll
sink
in
the
Polish
swamps
.
Only
they
could
*NL*
fail
to
see
it
,
''
the
prince
continued
,
evidently
thinking
of
the
*NL*
campaign
of
1807
which
seemed
to
him
so
recent
.
``
Bennigsen
should
have
*NL*
advanced
into
Prussia
sooner
,
then
things
would
have
taken
a
different
*NL*
turn
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Prince
,
''
Dessalles
began
timidly
,
``
the
letter
mentions
*NL*
Vitebsk
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
letter
?
Yes
...
''
replied
the
prince
peevishly
.
``
Yes
...
yes
...
''
*NL*
His
face
suddenly
took
on
a
morose
expression
.
He
paused
.
``
Yes
,
he
*NL*
writes
that
the
French
were
beaten
at
...
at
...
what
river
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dessalles
dropped
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
says
nothing
about
that
,
''
he
remarked
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
he
?
But
I
did
n't
invent
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
spoke
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
yes
...
Well
,
Michael
Ivanovich
,
''
he
suddenly
went
on
,
raising
*NL*
his
head
and
pointing
to
the
plan
of
the
building
,
``
tell
me
how
you
mean
*NL*
to
alter
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Michael
Ivanovich
went
up
to
the
plan
,
and
the
prince
after
speaking
to
*NL*
him
about
the
building
looked
angrily
at
Princess
Mary
and
Dessalles
and
*NL*
went
to
his
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
saw
Dessalles
'
embarrassed
and
astonished
look
fixed
on
*NL*
her
father
,
noticed
his
silence
,
and
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
her
*NL*
father
had
forgotten
his
son
's
letter
on
the
drawing-room
table
;
but
she
*NL*
was
not
only
afraid
to
speak
of
it
and
ask
Dessalles
the
reason
of
his
*NL*
confusion
and
silence
,
but
was
afraid
even
to
think
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Michael
Ivanovich
,
sent
by
the
prince
,
came
to
Princess
*NL*
Mary
for
Prince
Andrew
's
letter
which
had
been
forgotten
in
the
drawing
*NL*
room
.
She
gave
it
to
him
and
,
unpleasant
as
it
was
to
her
to
do
so
,
*NL*
ventured
to
ask
him
what
her
father
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
busy
,
''
replied
Michael
Ivanovich
with
a
respectfully
ironic
*NL*
smile
which
caused
Princess
Mary
to
turn
pale
.
``
He
's
worrying
very
much
*NL*
about
the
new
building
.
He
has
been
reading
a
little
,
but
now
''
--
Michael
*NL*
Ivanovich
went
on
,
lowering
his
voice
--
``
now
he
's
at
his
desk
,
busy
with
*NL*
his
will
,
I
expect
.
''
-LRB-
One
of
the
prince
's
favorite
occupations
of
late
*NL*
had
been
the
preparation
of
some
papers
he
meant
to
leave
at
his
death
*NL*
and
which
he
called
his
``
will

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
When
Michael
Ivanovich
returned
to
the
study
with
the
letter
,
the
old
*NL*
prince
,
with
spectacles
on
and
a
shade
over
his
eyes
,
was
sitting
at
his
*NL*
open
bureau
with
screened
candles
,
holding
a
paper
in
his
outstretched
*NL*
hand
,
and
in
a
somewhat
dramatic
attitude
was
reading
his
manuscript
--
*NL*
his
``
Remarks
''
as
he
termed
it
--
which
was
to
be
transmitted
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
after
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Michael
Ivanovich
went
in
there
were
tears
in
the
prince
's
eyes
*NL*
evoked
by
the
memory
of
the
time
when
the
paper
he
was
now
reading
had
*NL*
been
written
.
He
took
the
letter
from
Michael
Ivanovich
's
hand
,
put
it
*NL*
in
his
pocket
,
folded
up
his
papers
,
and
called
in
Alpatych
who
had
long
*NL*
been
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
had
a
list
of
things
to
be
bought
in
Smolensk
and
,
walking
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
past
Alpatych
who
stood
by
the
door
,
he
gave
his
*NL*
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
notepaper
--
do
you
hear
?
Eight
quires
,
like
this
sample
,
gilt
-
*NL*
edged
...
it
must
be
exactly
like
the
sample
.
Varnish
,
sealing
wax
,
as
in
*NL*
Michael
Ivanovich
's
list
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paced
up
and
down
for
a
while
and
glanced
at
his
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
hand
to
the
governor
in
person
a
letter
about
the
deed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
bolts
for
the
doors
of
the
new
building
were
wanted
and
had
to
be
*NL*
of
a
special
shape
the
prince
had
himself
designed
,
and
a
leather
case
*NL*
had
to
be
ordered
to
keep
the
``
will
''
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instructions
to
Alpatych
took
over
two
hours
and
still
the
prince
*NL*
did
not
let
him
go
.
He
sat
down
,
sank
into
thought
,
closed
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
dozed
off
.
Alpatych
made
a
slight
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
,
go
!
If
anything
more
is
wanted
I
'll
send
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
went
out
.
The
prince
again
went
to
his
bureau
,
glanced
into
it
,
*NL*
fingered
his
papers
,
closed
the
bureau
again
,
and
sat
down
at
the
table
*NL*
to
write
to
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
late
when
he
rose
after
sealing
the
letter
.
He
wished
to
*NL*
sleep
,
but
he
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
and
that
most
depressing
*NL*
thoughts
came
to
him
in
bed
.
So
he
called
Tikhon
and
went
through
the
*NL*
rooms
with
him
to
show
him
where
to
set
up
the
bed
for
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
about
looking
at
every
corner
.
Every
place
seemed
*NL*
unsatisfactory
,
but
worst
of
all
was
his
customary
couch
in
the
study
.
*NL*
That
couch
was
dreadful
to
him
,
probably
because
of
the
oppressive
*NL*
thoughts
he
had
had
when
lying
there
.
It
was
unsatisfactory
everywhere
,
*NL*
but
the
corner
behind
the
piano
in
the
sitting
room
was
better
than
*NL*
other
places
:
he
had
never
slept
there
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
help
of
a
footman
Tikhon
brought
in
the
bedstead
and
began
*NL*
putting
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
right
!
That
's
not
right
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
and
himself
*NL*
pushed
it
a
few
inches
from
the
corner
and
then
closer
in
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
at
last
I
've
finished
,
now
I
'll
rest
,
''
thought
the
prince
,
and
*NL*
let
Tikhon
undress
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frowning
with
vexation
at
the
effort
necessary
to
divest
himself
of
his
*NL*
coat
and
trousers
,
the
prince
undressed
,
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bed
,
*NL*
and
appeared
to
be
meditating
as
he
looked
contemptuously
at
his
*NL*
withered
yellow
legs
.
He
was
not
meditating
,
but
only
deferring
the
*NL*
moment
of
making
the
effort
to
lift
those
legs
up
and
turn
over
on
the
*NL*
bed
.
``
Ugh
,
how
hard
it
is
!
Oh
,
that
this
toil
might
end
and
you
would
*NL*
release
me
!
''
thought
he
.
Pressing
his
lips
together
he
made
that
effort
*NL*
for
the
twenty-thousandth
time
and
lay
down
.
But
hardly
had
he
done
so
*NL*
before
he
felt
the
bed
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
beneath
him
as
if
*NL*
it
were
breathing
heavily
and
jolting
.
This
happened
to
him
almost
every
*NL*
night
.
He
opened
his
eyes
as
they
were
closing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
peace
,
damn
them
!
''
he
muttered
,
angry
he
knew
not
with
whom
.
``
Ah
*NL*
yes
,
there
was
something
else
important
,
very
important
,
that
I
was
*NL*
keeping
till
I
should
be
in
bed
.
The
bolts
?
No
,
I
told
him
about
them
.
*NL*
No
,
it
was
something
,
something
in
the
drawing
room
.
Princess
Mary
*NL*
talked
some
nonsense
.
Dessalles
,
that
fool
,
said
something
.
Something
in
*NL*
my
pocket
--
ca
n't
remember
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tikhon
,
what
did
we
talk
about
at
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Prince
Michael
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
quiet
!
''
The
prince
slapped
his
hand
on
the
table
.
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
know
,
Prince
Andrew
's
letter
!
Princess
Mary
read
it
.
Dessalles
said
*NL*
something
about
Vitebsk
.
Now
I
'll
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
letter
taken
from
his
pocket
and
the
table
--
on
which
stood
a
*NL*
glass
of
lemonade
and
a
spiral
wax
candle
--
moved
close
to
the
bed
,
and
*NL*
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
began
reading
.
Only
now
in
the
stillness
of
*NL*
the
night
,
reading
it
by
the
faint
light
under
the
green
shade
,
did
he
*NL*
grasp
its
meaning
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
French
at
Vitebsk
,
in
four
days
'
march
they
may
be
at
Smolensk
;
*NL*
perhaps
are
already
there
!
Tikhon
!
''
Tikhon
jumped
up
.
``
No
,
no
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
anything
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
letter
under
the
candlestick
and
closed
his
eyes
.
And
there
*NL*
rose
before
him
the
Danube
at
bright
noonday
:
reeds
,
the
Russian
camp
,
*NL*
and
himself
a
young
general
without
a
wrinkle
on
his
ruddy
face
,
*NL*
vigorous
and
alert
,
entering
Potemkin
's
gaily
colored
tent
,
and
a
*NL*
burning
sense
of
jealousy
of
``
the
favorite
''
agitated
him
now
as
strongly
*NL*
as
it
had
done
then
.
He
recalled
all
the
words
spoken
at
that
first
*NL*
meeting
with
Potemkin
.
And
he
saw
before
him
a
plump
,
rather
sallow
-
*NL*
faced
,
short
,
stout
woman
,
the
Empress
Mother
,
with
her
smile
and
her
*NL*
words
at
her
first
gracious
reception
of
him
,
and
then
that
same
face
on
*NL*
the
catafalque
,
and
the
encounter
he
had
with
Zubov
over
her
coffin
*NL*
about
his
right
to
kiss
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quicker
,
quicker
!
To
get
back
to
that
time
and
have
done
with
all
*NL*
the
present

Quicker

quicker

and
that
they
should
leave
me
in
peace

lay
forty
miles
east
*NL*
from
Smolensk
and
two
miles
from
the
main
road
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
that
the
prince
gave
his
instructions
to
Alpatych
,
*NL*
Dessalles
,
having
asked
to
see
Princess
Mary
,
told
her
that
,
as
the
*NL*
prince
was
not
very
well
and
was
taking
no
steps
to
secure
his
safety
,
*NL*
though
from
Prince
Andrew
's
letter
it
was
evident
that
to
remain
at
Bald
*NL*
Hills
might
be
dangerous
,
he
respectfully
advised
her
to
send
a
letter
*NL*
by
Alpatych
to
the
Provincial
Governor
at
Smolensk
,
asking
him
to
let
*NL*
her
know
the
state
of
affairs
and
the
extent
of
the
danger
to
which
Bald
*NL*
Hills
was
exposed
.
Dessalles
wrote
this
letter
to
the
Governor
for
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
she
signed
it
,
and
it
was
given
to
Alpatych
with
*NL*
instructions
to
hand
it
to
the
Governor
and
to
come
back
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
if
there
was
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
received
all
his
orders
Alpatych
,
wearing
a
white
beaver
hat
--
a
*NL*
present
from
the
prince
--
and
carrying
a
stick
as
the
prince
did
,
went
*NL*
out
accompanied
by
his
family
.
Three
well-fed
roans
stood
ready
*NL*
harnessed
to
a
small
conveyance
with
a
leather
hood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
larger
bell
was
muffled
and
the
little
bells
on
the
harness
stuffed
*NL*
with
paper
.
The
prince
allowed
no
one
at
Bald
Hills
to
drive
with
*NL*
ringing
bells
;
but
on
a
long
journey
Alpatych
liked
to
have
them
.
His
*NL*
satellites
--
the
senior
clerk
,
a
countinghouse
clerk
,
a
scullery
maid
,
a
*NL*
cook
,
two
old
women
,
a
little
pageboy
,
the
coachman
,
and
various
*NL*
domestic
serfs
--
were
seeing
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
placed
chintz-covered
down
cushions
for
him
to
sit
on
and
*NL*
behind
his
back
.
His
old
sister-in-law
popped
in
a
small
bundle
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
coachmen
helped
him
into
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
There
!
Women
's
fuss
!
Women
,
women
!
''
said
Alpatych
,
puffing
and
*NL*
speaking
rapidly
just
as
the
prince
did
,
and
he
climbed
into
the
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
giving
the
clerk
orders
about
the
work
to
be
done
,
Alpatych
,
not
*NL*
trying
to
imitate
the
prince
now
,
lifted
the
hat
from
his
bald
head
and
*NL*
crossed
himself
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
anything
...
come
back
,
Yakov
Alpatych
!
For
Christ
's
sake
*NL*
think
of
us
!
''
cried
his
wife
,
referring
to
the
rumors
of
war
and
the
*NL*
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
,
women
!
Women
's
fuss
!
''
muttered
Alpatych
to
himself
and
started
*NL*
on
his
journey
,
looking
round
at
the
fields
of
yellow
rye
and
the
still
-
*NL*
green
,
thickly
growing
oats
,
and
at
other
quite
black
fields
just
being
*NL*
plowed
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
along
he
looked
with
pleasure
at
the
year
's
splendid
crop
of
*NL*
corn
,
scrutinized
the
strips
of
ryefield
which
here
and
there
were
*NL*
already
being
reaped
,
made
his
calculations
as
to
the
sowing
and
the
*NL*
harvest
,
and
asked
himself
whether
he
had
not
forgotten
any
of
the
*NL*
prince
's
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
baited
the
horses
twice
on
the
way
,
he
arrived
at
the
town
toward
*NL*
evening
on
the
fourth
of
August
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
kept
meeting
and
overtaking
baggage
trains
and
troops
on
the
*NL*
road
.
As
he
approached
Smolensk
he
heard
the
sounds
of
distant
firing
,
*NL*
but
these
did
not
impress
him
.
What
struck
him
most
was
the
sight
of
a
*NL*
splendid
field
of
oats
in
which
a
camp
had
been
pitched
and
which
was
*NL*
being
mown
down
by
the
soldiers
,
evidently
for
fodder
.
This
fact
*NL*
impressed
Alpatych
,
but
in
thinking
about
his
own
business
he
soon
*NL*
forgot
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
interests
of
his
life
for
more
than
thirty
years
had
been
*NL*
bounded
by
the
will
of
the
prince
,
and
he
never
went
beyond
that
limit
.
*NL*
Everything
not
connected
with
the
execution
of
the
prince
's
orders
did
*NL*
not
interest
and
did
not
even
exist
for
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
Smolensk
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
August
he
put
up
in
*NL*
the
Gachina
suburb
across
the
Dnieper
,
at
the
inn
kept
by
Ferapontov
,
*NL*
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
putting
up
for
the
last
thirty
years
.
*NL*
Some
thirty
years
ago
Ferapontov
,
by
Alpatych
's
advice
,
had
bought
a
*NL*
wood
from
the
prince
,
had
begun
to
trade
,
and
now
had
a
house
,
an
inn
,
*NL*
and
a
corn
dealer
's
shop
in
that
province
.
He
was
a
stout
,
dark
,
red
-
*NL*
faced
peasant
in
the
forties
,
with
thick
lips
,
a
broad
knob
of
a
nose
,
*NL*
similar
knobs
over
his
black
frowning
brows
,
and
a
round
belly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wearing
a
waistcoat
over
his
cotton
shirt
,
Ferapontov
was
standing
*NL*
before
his
shop
which
opened
onto
the
street
.
On
seeing
Alpatych
he
went
*NL*
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
welcome
,
Yakov
Alpatych
.
Folks
are
leaving
the
town
,
but
you
*NL*
have
come
to
it
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
they
leaving
the
town
?
''
asked
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
say
.
Folks
are
foolish
!
Always
afraid
of
the
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
's
fuss
,
women
's
fuss
!
''
said
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
I
think
,
Yakov
Alpatych
.
What
I
say
is
:
orders
have
been
*NL*
given
not
to
let
them
in
,
so
that
must
be
right
.
And
the
peasants
are
*NL*
asking
three
rubles
for
carting
--
it
is
n't
Christian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yakov
Alpatych
heard
without
heeding
.
He
asked
for
a
samovar
and
for
hay
*NL*
for
his
horses
,
and
when
he
had
had
his
tea
he
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
long
troops
were
moving
past
the
inn
.
Next
morning
Alpatych
*NL*
donned
a
jacket
he
wore
only
in
town
and
went
out
on
business
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sunny
morning
and
by
eight
o'clock
it
was
already
hot
.
``
A
good
day
for
*NL*
harvesting
,
''
thought
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
beyond
the
town
firing
had
been
heard
since
early
morning
.
At
eight
*NL*
o'clock
the
booming
of
cannon
was
added
to
the
sound
of
musketry
.
Many
*NL*
people
were
hurrying
through
the
streets
and
there
were
many
soldiers
,
*NL*
but
cabs
were
still
driving
about
,
tradesmen
stood
at
their
shops
,
and
*NL*
service
was
being
held
in
the
churches
as
usual
.
Alpatych
went
to
the
*NL*
shops
,
to
government
offices
,
to
the
post
office
,
and
to
the
Governor
's
.
*NL*
In
the
offices
and
shops
and
at
the
post
office
everyone
was
talking
*NL*
about
the
army
and
about
the
enemy
who
was
already
attacking
the
town
,
*NL*
everybody
was
asking
what
should
be
done
,
and
all
were
trying
to
calm
*NL*
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
the
Governor
's
house
Alpatych
found
a
large
number
of
*NL*
people
,
Cossacks
,
and
a
traveling
carriage
of
the
Governor
's
.
At
the
*NL*
porch
he
met
two
of
the
landed
gentry
,
one
of
whom
he
knew
.
This
man
,
an
*NL*
ex-captain
of
police
,
was
saying
angrily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
joke
,
you
know
!
It
's
all
very
well
if
you
're
single
.
`
One
man
*NL*
though
undone
is
but
one
,
'
as
the
proverb
says
,
but
with
thirteen
in
*NL*
your
family
and
all
the
property
...
They
've
brought
us
to
utter
ruin
!
*NL*
What
sort
of
governors
are
they
to
do
that
?
They
ought
to
be
hanged
--
the
*NL*
brigands
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
come
,
that
's
enough
!
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
care
?
Let
him
hear
!
We
're
not
dogs
,
''
said
the
ex-captain
of
*NL*
police
,
and
looking
round
he
noticed
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Yakov
Alpatych
!
What
have
you
come
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
the
Governor
by
his
excellency
's
order
,
''
answered
Alpatych
,
*NL*
lifting
his
head
and
proudly
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
bosom
of
his
*NL*
coat
as
he
always
did
when
he
mentioned
the
prince
...
``
He
has
ordered
*NL*
me
to
inquire
into
the
position
of
affairs
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
and
find
out
!
''
shouted
the
angry
gentleman
.
``
They
've
brought
*NL*
things
to
such
a
pass
that
there
are
no
carts
or
anything
!
...
There
it
*NL*
is
again
,
do
you
hear
?
''
said
he
,
pointing
in
the
direction
whence
came
*NL*
the
sounds
of
firing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
brought
us
all
to
ruin
...
the
brigands
!
''
he
repeated
,
and
*NL*
descended
the
porch
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
swayed
his
head
and
went
upstairs
.
In
the
waiting
room
were
*NL*
tradesmen
,
women
,
and
officials
,
looking
silently
at
one
another
.
The
*NL*
door
of
the
Governor
's
room
opened
and
they
all
rose
and
moved
forward
.
*NL*
An
official
ran
out
,
said
some
words
to
a
merchant
,
called
a
stout
*NL*
official
with
a
cross
hanging
on
his
neck
to
follow
him
,
and
vanished
*NL*
again
,
evidently
wishing
to
avoid
the
inquiring
looks
and
questions
*NL*
addressed
to
him
.
Alpatych
moved
forward
and
next
time
the
official
came
*NL*
out
addressed
him
,
one
hand
placed
in
the
breast
of
his
buttoned
coat
,
*NL*
and
handed
him
two
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
his
Honor
Baron
Asch
,
from
General-in-Chief
Prince
Bolkonski
,
''
he
*NL*
announced
with
such
solemnity
and
significance
that
the
official
turned
*NL*
to
him
and
took
the
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
the
Governor
received
Alpatych
and
hurriedly
said
to
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inform
the
prince
and
princess
that
I
knew
nothing
:
I
acted
on
the
*NL*
highest
instructions
--
here
...
''
and
he
handed
a
paper
to
Alpatych
.
*NL*
``
Still
,
as
the
prince
is
unwell
my
advice
is
that
they
should
go
to
*NL*
Moscow
.
I
am
just
starting
myself
.
Inform
them
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Governor
did
not
finish
:
a
dusty
perspiring
officer
ran
into
the
*NL*
room
and
began
to
say
something
in
French
.
The
Governor
's
face
expressed
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
he
said
,
nodding
his
head
to
Alpatych
,
and
began
questioning
the
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eager
,
frightened
,
helpless
glances
were
turned
on
Alpatych
when
he
came
*NL*
out
of
the
Governor
's
room
.
Involuntarily
listening
now
to
the
firing
,
*NL*
which
had
drawn
nearer
and
was
increasing
in
strength
,
Alpatych
hurried
*NL*
to
his
inn
.
The
paper
handed
to
him
by
the
Governor
said
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
that
the
town
of
Smolensk
is
not
in
the
slightest
danger
*NL*
as
yet
and
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
threatened
with
any
.
I
from
*NL*
the
one
side
and
Prince
Bagration
from
the
other
are
marching
to
unite
*NL*
our
forces
before
Smolensk
,
which
junction
will
be
effected
on
the
22nd
*NL*
instant
,
and
both
armies
with
their
united
forces
will
defend
our
*NL*
compatriots
of
the
province
entrusted
to
your
care
till
our
efforts
*NL*
shall
have
beaten
back
the
enemies
of
our
Fatherland
,
or
till
the
last
*NL*
warrior
in
our
valiant
ranks
has
perished
.
From
this
you
will
see
that
*NL*
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
of
Smolensk
,
for
*NL*
those
defended
by
two
such
brave
armies
may
feel
assured
of
victory

-LRB-
Instructions
from
Barclay
de
Tolly
to
Baron
Asch
,
the
civil
governor
of
*NL*
Smolensk
,
1812
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
People
were
anxiously
roaming
about
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carts
piled
high
with
household
utensils
,
chairs
,
and
cupboards
kept
*NL*
emerging
from
the
gates
of
the
yards
and
moving
along
the
streets
.
*NL*
Loaded
carts
stood
at
the
house
next
to
Ferapontov
's
and
women
were
*NL*
wailing
and
lamenting
as
they
said
good-by
.
A
small
watchdog
ran
round
*NL*
barking
in
front
of
the
harnessed
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
entered
the
innyard
at
a
quicker
pace
than
usual
and
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
shed
where
his
horses
and
trap
were
.
The
coachman
was
*NL*
asleep
.
He
woke
him
up
,
told
him
to
harness
,
and
went
into
the
passage
.
*NL*
From
the
host
's
room
came
the
sounds
of
a
child
crying
,
the
despairing
*NL*
sobs
of
a
woman
,
and
the
hoarse
angry
shouting
of
Ferapontov
.
The
cook
*NL*
began
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
passage
like
a
frightened
hen
,
*NL*
just
as
Alpatych
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
done
her
to
death
.
Killed
the
mistress
!
...
Beat
her
...
dragged
her
*NL*
about
so
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
asked
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
kept
begging
to
go
away
.
She
's
a
woman
!
`
Take
me
away
,
'
says
she
,
*NL*
`
do
n't
let
me
perish
with
my
little
children

Folks
,

she
says
,
`
are
all
*NL*
gone
,
so
why
,
'
she
says
,
`
do
n't
we
go
?
'
And
he
began
beating
and
pulling
*NL*
her
about
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Alpatych
nodded
as
if
in
approval
,
and
not
wishing
to
*NL*
hear
more
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
opposite
the
innkeeper
's
,
where
*NL*
he
had
left
his
purchases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
brute
,
you
murderer

screamed
a
thin
,
pale
woman
who
,
with
a
baby
*NL*
in
her
arms
and
her
kerchief
torn
from
her
head
,
burst
through
the
door
*NL*
at
that
moment
and
down
the
steps
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ferapontov
came
out
after
her
,
but
on
seeing
Alpatych
adjusted
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
smoothed
his
hair
,
yawned
,
and
followed
Alpatych
into
the
*NL*
opposite
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
already
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
,
without
answering
or
looking
at
his
host
,
sorted
his
packages
*NL*
and
asked
how
much
he
owed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
reckon
up
!
Well
,
have
you
been
to
the
Governor
's
?
''
asked
*NL*
Ferapontov
.
``
What
has
been
decided
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
replied
that
the
Governor
had
not
told
him
anything
definite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
our
business
,
how
can
we
get
away
?
''
said
Ferapontov
.
``
We
'd
have
to
*NL*
pay
seven
rubles
a
cartload
to
Dorogobuzh
and
I
tell
them
they
're
not
*NL*
Christians
to
ask
it
!
Selivanov
,
now
,
did
a
good
stroke
last
Thursday
--
*NL*
sold
flour
to
the
army
at
nine
rubles
a
sack
.
Will
you
have
some
tea
?
''
*NL*
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
horses
were
being
harnessed
Alpatych
and
Ferapontov
over
their
*NL*
tea
talked
of
the
price
of
corn
,
the
crops
,
and
the
good
weather
for
*NL*
harvesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
seems
to
be
getting
quieter
,
''
remarked
Ferapontov
,
finishing
*NL*
his
third
cup
of
tea
and
getting
up
.
``
Ours
must
have
got
the
best
of
it
.
*NL*
The
orders
were
not
to
let
them
in
.
So
we
're
in
force
,
it
seems
...
They
*NL*
say
the
other
day
Matthew
Ivanych
Platov
drove
them
into
the
river
*NL*
Marina
and
drowned
some
eighteen
thousand
in
one
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
collected
his
parcels
,
handed
them
to
the
coachman
who
had
come
*NL*
in
,
and
settled
up
with
the
innkeeper
.
The
noise
of
wheels
,
hoofs
,
and
*NL*
bells
was
heard
from
the
gateway
as
a
little
trap
passed
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
by
now
late
in
the
afternoon
.
Half
the
street
was
in
shadow
,
the
*NL*
other
half
brightly
lit
by
the
sun
.
Alpatych
looked
out
of
the
window
*NL*
and
went
to
the
door
.
Suddenly
the
strange
sound
of
a
far-off
whistling
*NL*
and
thud
was
heard
,
followed
by
a
boom
of
cannon
blending
into
a
dull
*NL*
roar
that
set
the
windows
rattling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
into
the
street
:
two
men
were
running
past
toward
the
*NL*
bridge
.
From
different
sides
came
whistling
sounds
and
the
thud
of
*NL*
cannon
balls
and
bursting
shells
falling
on
the
town
.
But
these
sounds
*NL*
were
hardly
heard
in
comparison
with
the
noise
of
the
firing
outside
the
*NL*
town
and
attracted
little
attention
from
the
inhabitants
.
The
town
was
*NL*
being
bombarded
by
a
hundred
and
thirty
guns
which
Napoleon
had
ordered
*NL*
up
after
four
o'clock
.
The
people
did
not
at
once
realize
the
meaning
of
*NL*
this
bombardment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
noise
of
the
falling
bombs
and
shells
only
aroused
*NL*
curiosity
.
Ferapontov
's
wife
,
who
till
then
had
not
ceased
wailing
under
*NL*
the
shed
,
became
quiet
and
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
went
to
the
gate
,
*NL*
listening
to
the
sounds
and
looking
in
silence
at
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cook
and
a
shop
assistant
came
to
the
gate
.
With
lively
curiosity
*NL*
everyone
tried
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
projectiles
as
they
flew
over
*NL*
their
heads
.
Several
people
came
round
the
corner
talking
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
force
!
''
remarked
one
.
``
Knocked
the
roof
and
ceiling
all
to
*NL*
splinters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Routed
up
the
earth
like
a
pig
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
grand
,
it
bucks
one
up
!
''
laughed
the
first
.
``
Lucky
you
jumped
*NL*
aside
,
or
it
would
have
wiped
you
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Others
joined
those
men
and
stopped
and
told
how
cannon
balls
had
fallen
*NL*
on
a
house
close
to
them
.
Meanwhile
still
more
projectiles
,
now
with
the
*NL*
swift
sinister
whistle
of
a
cannon
ball
,
now
with
the
agreeable
*NL*
intermittent
whistle
of
a
shell
,
flew
over
people
's
heads
incessantly
,
*NL*
but
not
one
fell
close
by
,
they
all
flew
over
.
Alpatych
was
getting
into
*NL*
his
trap
.
The
innkeeper
stood
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
staring
at
?
''
he
shouted
to
the
cook
,
who
in
her
red
skirt
,
*NL*
with
sleeves
rolled
up
,
swinging
her
bare
elbows
,
had
stepped
to
the
*NL*
corner
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
marvels
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
but
hearing
her
master
's
voice
she
turned
*NL*
back
,
pulling
down
her
tucked-up
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
something
whistled
,
but
this
time
quite
close
,
swooping
*NL*
downwards
like
a
little
bird
;
a
flame
flashed
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
street
,
something
exploded
,
and
the
street
was
shrouded
in
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scoundrel
,
what
are
you
doing
?
''
shouted
the
innkeeper
,
rushing
to
the
*NL*
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
pitiful
wailing
of
women
was
heard
from
different
*NL*
sides
,
the
frightened
baby
began
to
cry
,
and
people
crowded
silently
*NL*
with
pale
faces
round
the
cook
.
The
loudest
sound
in
that
crowd
was
her
*NL*
wailing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-h-h
!
Dear
souls
,
dear
kind
souls
!
Do
n't
let
me
die
!
My
good
*NL*
souls
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
no
one
remained
in
the
street
.
The
cook
,
with
her
*NL*
thigh
broken
by
a
shell
splinter
,
had
been
carried
into
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
Alpatych
,
his
coachman
,
Ferapontov
's
wife
and
children
and
the
house
*NL*
porter
were
all
sitting
in
the
cellar
,
listening
.
The
roar
of
guns
,
the
*NL*
whistling
of
projectiles
,
and
the
piteous
moaning
of
the
cook
,
which
*NL*
rose
above
the
other
sounds
,
did
not
cease
for
a
moment
.
The
mistress
*NL*
rocked
and
hushed
her
baby
and
when
anyone
came
into
the
cellar
asked
in
*NL*
a
pathetic
whisper
what
had
become
of
her
husband
who
had
remained
in
*NL*
the
street
.
A
shopman
who
entered
told
her
that
her
husband
had
gone
*NL*
with
others
to
the
cathedral
,
whence
they
were
fetching
the
wonder
-
*NL*
working
icon
of
Smolensk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
dusk
the
cannonade
began
to
subside
.
Alpatych
left
the
cellar
and
*NL*
stopped
in
the
doorway
.
The
evening
sky
that
had
been
so
clear
was
*NL*
clouded
with
smoke
,
through
which
,
high
up
,
the
sickle
of
the
new
moon
*NL*
shone
strangely
.
Now
that
the
terrible
din
of
the
guns
had
ceased
a
hush
*NL*
seemed
to
reign
over
the
town
,
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
footsteps
,
*NL*
the
moaning
,
the
distant
cries
,
and
the
crackle
of
fires
which
seemed
*NL*
widespread
everywhere
.
The
cook
's
moans
had
now
subsided
.
On
two
sides
*NL*
black
curling
clouds
of
smoke
rose
and
spread
from
the
fires
.
Through
*NL*
the
streets
soldiers
in
various
uniforms
walked
or
ran
confusedly
in
*NL*
different
directions
like
ants
from
a
ruined
ant-hill
.
Several
of
them
*NL*
ran
into
Ferapontov
's
yard
before
Alpatych
's
eyes
.
Alpatych
went
out
to
*NL*
the
gate
.
A
retreating
regiment
,
thronging
and
hurrying
,
blocked
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
him
,
an
officer
said
:
``
The
town
is
being
abandoned
.
Get
away
,
*NL*
get
away
!
''
and
then
,
turning
to
the
soldiers
,
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
teach
you
to
run
into
the
yards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
went
back
to
the
house
,
called
the
coachman
,
and
told
him
to
*NL*
set
off
.
Ferapontov
's
whole
household
came
out
too
,
following
Alpatych
*NL*
and
the
coachman
.
The
women
,
who
had
been
silent
till
then
,
suddenly
*NL*
began
to
wail
as
they
looked
at
the
fires
--
the
smoke
and
even
the
flames
*NL*
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
failing
twilight
--
and
as
if
in
reply
the
*NL*
same
kind
of
lamentation
was
heard
from
other
parts
of
the
street
.
*NL*
Inside
the
shed
Alpatych
and
the
coachman
arranged
the
tangled
reins
and
*NL*
traces
of
their
horses
with
trembling
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Alpatych
was
driving
out
of
the
gate
he
saw
some
ten
soldiers
in
*NL*
Ferapontov
's
open
shop
,
talking
loudly
and
filling
their
bags
and
*NL*
knapsacks
with
flour
and
sunflower
seeds
.
Just
then
Ferapontov
returned
*NL*
and
entered
his
shop
.
On
seeing
the
soldiers
he
was
about
to
shout
at
*NL*
them
,
but
suddenly
stopped
and
,
clutching
at
his
hair
,
burst
into
sobs
*NL*
and
laughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Loot
everything
,
lads
!
Do
n't
let
those
devils
get
it
!
''
he
cried
,
taking
*NL*
some
bags
of
flour
himself
and
throwing
them
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
soldiers
were
frightened
and
ran
away
,
others
went
on
*NL*
filling
their
bags
.
On
seeing
Alpatych
,
Ferapontov
turned
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Russia
is
done
for
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Alpatych
,
I
'll
set
the
place
on
fire
*NL*
myself
.
We
're
done
for
!
...
''
and
Ferapontov
ran
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soldiers
were
passing
in
a
constant
stream
along
the
street
blocking
it
*NL*
completely
,
so
that
Alpatych
could
not
pass
out
and
had
to
wait
.
*NL*
Ferapontov
's
wife
and
children
were
also
sitting
in
a
cart
waiting
till
*NL*
it
was
possible
to
drive
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
come
.
There
were
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
new
moon
shone
out
*NL*
amid
the
smoke
that
screened
it
.
On
the
sloping
descent
to
the
Dnieper
*NL*
Alpatych
's
cart
and
that
of
the
innkeeper
's
wife
,
which
were
slowly
*NL*
moving
amid
the
rows
of
soldiers
and
of
other
vehicles
,
had
to
stop
.
In
*NL*
a
side
street
near
the
crossroads
where
the
vehicles
had
stopped
,
a
*NL*
house
and
some
shops
were
on
fire
.
This
fire
was
already
burning
itself
*NL*
out
.
The
flames
now
died
down
and
were
lost
in
the
black
smoke
,
now
*NL*
suddenly
flared
up
again
brightly
,
lighting
up
with
strange
distinctness
*NL*
the
faces
of
the
people
crowding
at
the
crossroads
.
Black
figures
*NL*
flitted
about
before
the
fire
,
and
through
the
incessant
crackling
of
*NL*
the
flames
talking
and
shouting
could
be
heard
.
Seeing
that
his
trap
*NL*
would
not
be
able
to
move
on
for
some
time
,
Alpatych
got
down
and
turned
*NL*
into
the
side
street
to
look
at
the
fire
.
Soldiers
were
continually
*NL*
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
near
it
,
and
he
saw
two
of
them
and
a
man
*NL*
in
a
frieze
coat
dragging
burning
beams
into
another
yard
across
the
*NL*
street
,
while
others
carried
bundles
of
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
went
up
to
a
large
crowd
standing
before
a
high
barn
which
was
*NL*
blazing
briskly
.
The
walls
were
all
on
fire
and
the
back
wall
had
fallen
*NL*
in
,
the
wooden
roof
was
collapsing
,
and
the
rafters
were
alight
.
The
*NL*
crowd
was
evidently
watching
for
the
roof
to
fall
in
,
and
Alpatych
*NL*
watched
for
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alpatych
!
''
a
familiar
voice
suddenly
hailed
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
Your
excellency
!
''
answered
Alpatych
,
immediately
*NL*
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
young
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
in
his
riding
cloak
,
mounted
on
a
black
horse
,
was
looking
*NL*
at
Alpatych
from
the
back
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
...
your
excellency
,
''
stammered
Alpatych
and
broke
into
sobs
.
``
Are
*NL*
we
really
lost
?
Master
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
here
?
''
Prince
Andrew
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
flames
flared
up
and
showed
his
young
master
's
pale
*NL*
worn
face
.
Alpatych
told
how
he
had
been
sent
there
and
how
difficult
it
*NL*
was
to
get
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
really
quite
lost
,
your
excellency
?
''
he
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
without
replying
took
out
a
notebook
and
raising
his
knee
*NL*
began
writing
in
pencil
on
a
page
he
tore
out
.
He
wrote
to
his
sister
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smolensk
is
being
abandoned
.
Bald
Hills
will
be
occupied
by
the
enemy
*NL*
within
a
week
.
Set
off
immediately
for
Moscow
.
Let
me
know
at
once
when
*NL*
you
will
start
.
Send
by
special
messenger
to
Usvyazh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
written
this
and
given
the
paper
to
Alpatych
,
he
told
him
how
to
*NL*
arrange
for
departure
of
the
prince
,
the
princess
,
his
son
,
and
the
*NL*
boy
's
tutor
,
and
how
and
where
to
let
him
know
immediately
.
Before
he
*NL*
had
had
time
to
finish
giving
these
instructions
,
a
chief
of
staff
*NL*
followed
by
a
suite
galloped
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
colonel
?
''
shouted
the
chief
of
staff
with
a
German
accent
,
in
*NL*
a
voice
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew
.
``
Houses
are
set
on
fire
in
your
*NL*
presence
and
you
stand
by
!
What
does
this
mean
?
You
will
answer
for
it
!
''
*NL*
shouted
Berg
,
who
was
now
assistant
to
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
*NL*
commander
of
the
left
flank
of
the
infantry
of
the
first
army
,
a
place
,
*NL*
as
Berg
said
,
``
very
agreeable
and
well
en
evidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
him
and
without
replying
went
on
speaking
to
*NL*
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
tell
them
that
I
shall
await
a
reply
till
the
tenth
,
and
if
by
the
*NL*
tenth
I
do
n't
receive
news
that
they
have
all
got
away
I
shall
have
to
*NL*
throw
up
everything
and
come
myself
to
Bald
Hills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
''
said
Berg
,
recognizing
Prince
Andrew
,
``
I
only
spoke
because
I
*NL*
have
to
obey
orders
,
because
I
always
do
obey
exactly
...
You
must
*NL*
please
excuse
me
,
''
he
went
on
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
cracked
in
the
flames
.
The
fire
died
down
for
a
moment
and
*NL*
wreaths
of
black
smoke
rolled
from
under
the
roof
.
There
was
another
*NL*
terrible
crash
and
something
huge
collapsed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ou-rou-rou
!
''
yelled
the
crowd
,
echoing
the
crash
of
the
collapsing
roof
*NL*
of
the
barn
,
the
burning
grain
in
which
diffused
a
cakelike
aroma
all
*NL*
around
.
The
flames
flared
up
again
,
lighting
the
animated
,
delighted
,
*NL*
exhausted
faces
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
frieze
coat
raised
his
arms
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
fine
,
lads
!
Now
it
's
raging
...
It
's
fine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
owner
himself
,
''
cried
several
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
continued
Prince
Andrew
to
Alpatych
,
``
report
to
them
as
I
*NL*
have
told
you
''
;
and
not
replying
a
word
to
Berg
who
was
now
mute
beside
*NL*
him
,
he
touched
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
side
street
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
From
Smolensk
the
troops
continued
to
retreat
,
followed
by
the
enemy
.
On
*NL*
the
tenth
of
August
the
regiment
Prince
Andrew
commanded
was
marching
*NL*
along
the
highroad
past
the
avenue
leading
to
Bald
Hills
.
Heat
and
*NL*
drought
had
continued
for
more
than
three
weeks
.
Each
day
fleecy
clouds
*NL*
floated
across
the
sky
and
occasionally
veiled
the
sun
,
but
toward
*NL*
evening
the
sky
cleared
again
and
the
sun
set
in
reddish-brown
mist
.
*NL*
Heavy
night
dews
alone
refreshed
the
earth
.
The
unreaped
corn
was
*NL*
scorched
and
shed
its
grain
.
The
marshes
dried
up
.
The
cattle
lowed
from
*NL*
hunger
,
finding
no
food
on
the
sun-parched
meadows
.
Only
at
night
and
in
*NL*
the
forests
while
the
dew
lasted
was
there
any
freshness
.
But
on
the
*NL*
road
,
the
highroad
along
which
the
troops
marched
,
there
was
no
such
*NL*
freshness
even
at
night
or
when
the
road
passed
through
the
forest
;
the
*NL*
dew
was
imperceptible
on
the
sandy
dust
churned
up
more
than
six
inches
*NL*
deep
.
As
soon
as
day
dawned
the
march
began
.
The
artillery
and
baggage
*NL*
wagons
moved
noiselessly
through
the
deep
dust
that
rose
to
the
very
*NL*
hubs
of
the
wheels
,
and
the
infantry
sank
ankle-deep
in
that
soft
,
*NL*
choking
,
hot
dust
that
never
cooled
even
at
night
.
Some
of
this
dust
was
*NL*
kneaded
by
the
feet
and
wheels
,
while
the
rest
rose
and
hung
like
a
*NL*
cloud
over
the
troops
,
settling
in
eyes
,
ears
,
hair
,
and
nostrils
,
and
*NL*
worst
of
all
in
the
lungs
of
the
men
and
beasts
as
they
moved
along
that
*NL*
road
.
The
higher
the
sun
rose
the
higher
rose
that
cloud
of
dust
,
and
*NL*
through
the
screen
of
its
hot
fine
particles
one
could
look
with
naked
*NL*
eye
at
the
sun
,
which
showed
like
a
huge
crimson
ball
in
the
unclouded
*NL*
sky
.
There
was
no
wind
,
and
the
men
choked
in
that
motionless
*NL*
atmosphere
.
They
marched
with
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
noses
and
*NL*
mouths
.
When
they
passed
through
a
village
they
all
rushed
to
the
wells
*NL*
and
fought
for
the
water
and
drank
it
down
to
the
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
in
command
of
a
regiment
,
and
the
management
of
that
*NL*
regiment
,
the
welfare
of
the
men
and
the
necessity
of
receiving
and
*NL*
giving
orders
,
engrossed
him
.
The
burning
of
Smolensk
and
its
*NL*
abandonment
made
an
epoch
in
his
life
.
A
novel
feeling
of
anger
against
*NL*
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
sorrow
.
He
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
*NL*
affairs
of
his
regiment
and
was
considerate
and
kind
to
his
men
and
*NL*
officers
.
In
the
regiment
they
called
him
``
our
prince
,
''
were
proud
of
*NL*
him
and
loved
him
.
But
he
was
kind
and
gentle
only
to
those
of
his
*NL*
regiment
,
to
Timokhin
and
the
like
--
people
quite
new
to
him
,
belonging
*NL*
to
a
different
world
and
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
past
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
came
across
a
former
acquaintance
or
anyone
from
the
staff
,
*NL*
he
bristled
up
immediately
and
grew
spiteful
,
ironical
,
and
*NL*
contemptuous
.
Everything
that
reminded
him
of
his
past
was
repugnant
to
*NL*
him
,
and
so
in
his
relations
with
that
former
circle
he
confined
himself
*NL*
to
trying
to
do
his
duty
and
not
to
be
unfair
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
everything
presented
itself
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
light
to
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
especially
after
the
abandonment
of
Smolensk
on
the
sixth
*NL*
of
August
-LRB-
he
considered
that
it
could
and
should
have
been
defended
-RRB-
*NL*
and
after
his
sick
father
had
had
to
flee
to
Moscow
,
abandoning
to
*NL*
pillage
his
dearly
beloved
Bald
Hills
which
he
had
built
and
peopled
.
*NL*
But
despite
this
,
thanks
to
his
regiment
,
Prince
Andrew
had
something
to
*NL*
think
about
entirely
apart
from
general
questions
.
Two
days
previously
*NL*
he
had
received
news
that
his
father
,
son
,
and
sister
had
left
for
*NL*
Moscow
;
and
though
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
Bald
Hills
,
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
with
a
characteristic
desire
to
foment
his
own
grief
decided
that
*NL*
he
must
ride
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
and
,
leaving
his
regiment
on
the
*NL*
march
,
rode
to
his
father
's
estate
where
he
had
been
born
and
spent
his
*NL*
childhood
.
Riding
past
the
pond
where
there
used
always
to
be
dozens
of
*NL*
women
chattering
as
they
rinsed
their
linen
or
beat
it
with
wooden
*NL*
beetles
,
Prince
Andrew
noticed
that
there
was
not
a
soul
about
and
that
*NL*
the
little
washing
wharf
,
torn
from
its
place
and
half
submerged
,
was
*NL*
floating
on
its
side
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
.
He
rode
to
the
keeper
's
*NL*
lodge
.
No
one
at
the
stone
entrance
gates
of
the
drive
and
the
door
*NL*
stood
open
.
Grass
had
already
begun
to
grow
on
the
garden
paths
,
and
*NL*
horses
and
calves
were
straying
in
the
English
park
.
Prince
Andrew
rode
*NL*
up
to
the
hothouse
;
some
of
the
glass
panes
were
broken
,
and
of
the
*NL*
trees
in
tubs
some
were
overturned
and
others
dried
up
.
He
called
for
*NL*
Taras
the
gardener
,
but
no
one
replied
.
Having
gone
round
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
hothouse
to
the
ornamental
garden
,
he
saw
that
the
carved
garden
*NL*
fence
was
broken
and
branches
of
the
plum
trees
had
been
torn
off
with
*NL*
the
fruit
.
An
old
peasant
whom
Prince
Andrew
in
his
childhood
had
often
*NL*
seen
at
the
gate
was
sitting
on
a
green
garden
seat
,
plaiting
a
bast
*NL*
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
deaf
and
did
not
hear
Prince
Andrew
ride
up
.
He
was
sitting
on
*NL*
the
seat
the
old
prince
used
to
like
to
sit
on
,
and
beside
him
strips
of
*NL*
bast
were
hanging
on
the
broken
and
withered
branch
of
a
magnolia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
rode
up
to
the
house
.
Several
limes
in
the
old
garden
had
*NL*
been
cut
down
and
a
piebald
mare
and
her
foal
were
wandering
in
front
of
*NL*
the
house
among
the
rosebushes
.
The
shutters
were
all
closed
,
except
at
*NL*
one
window
which
was
open
.
A
little
serf
boy
,
seeing
Prince
Andrew
,
ran
*NL*
into
the
house
.
Alpatych
,
having
sent
his
family
away
,
was
alone
at
Bald
*NL*
Hills
and
was
sitting
indoors
reading
the
Lives
of
the
Saints
.
On
*NL*
hearing
that
Prince
Andrew
had
come
,
he
went
out
with
his
spectacles
on
*NL*
his
nose
,
buttoning
his
coat
,
and
,
hastily
stepping
up
,
without
a
word
*NL*
began
weeping
and
kissing
Prince
Andrew
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
vexed
at
his
own
weakness
,
he
turned
away
and
began
to
report
on
*NL*
the
position
of
affairs
.
Everything
precious
and
valuable
had
been
*NL*
removed
to
Bogucharovo
.
Seventy
quarters
of
grain
had
also
been
carted
*NL*
away
.
The
hay
and
the
spring
corn
,
of
which
Alpatych
said
there
had
been
*NL*
a
remarkable
crop
that
year
,
had
been
commandeered
by
the
troops
and
*NL*
mown
down
while
still
green
.
The
peasants
were
ruined
;
some
of
them
too
*NL*
had
gone
to
Bogucharovo
,
only
a
few
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
to
hear
him
out
,
Prince
Andrew
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
my
father
and
sister
leave
?
''
meaning
when
did
they
leave
for
*NL*
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
,
understanding
the
question
to
refer
to
their
departure
for
*NL*
Bogucharovo
,
replied
that
they
had
left
on
the
seventh
and
again
went
*NL*
into
details
concerning
the
estate
management
,
asking
for
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
let
the
troops
have
the
oats
,
and
to
take
a
receipt
for
them
?
*NL*
We
have
still
six
hundred
quarters
left
,
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
say
to
him
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
looking
down
on
the
*NL*
old
man
's
bald
head
shining
in
the
sun
and
seeing
by
the
expression
on
*NL*
his
face
that
the
old
man
himself
understood
how
untimely
such
questions
*NL*
were
and
only
asked
them
to
allay
his
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
let
them
have
it
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
noticed
some
disorder
in
the
garden
,
''
said
Alpatych
,
``
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
prevent
it
.
Three
regiments
have
been
here
and
spent
the
*NL*
night
,
dragoons
mostly
.
I
took
down
the
name
and
rank
of
their
*NL*
commanding
officer
,
to
hand
in
a
complaint
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
Will
you
stay
here
if
the
enemy
*NL*
occupies
the
place
?
''
asked
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
turned
his
face
to
Prince
Andrew
,
looked
at
him
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
with
a
solemn
gesture
raised
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
my
refuge
!
His
will
be
done
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
group
of
bareheaded
peasants
was
approaching
across
the
meadow
toward
*NL*
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
bending
over
to
Alpatych
.
``
You
must
*NL*
go
away
too
,
take
away
what
you
can
and
tell
the
serfs
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Ryazan
estate
or
to
the
one
near
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
clung
to
Prince
Andrew
's
leg
and
burst
into
sobs
.
Gently
*NL*
disengaging
himself
,
the
prince
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
*NL*
avenue
at
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
still
sitting
in
the
ornamental
garden
,
like
a
fly
*NL*
impassive
on
the
face
of
a
loved
one
who
is
dead
,
tapping
the
last
on
*NL*
which
he
was
making
the
bast
shoe
,
and
two
little
girls
,
running
out
*NL*
from
the
hot
house
carrying
in
their
skirts
plums
they
had
plucked
from
*NL*
the
trees
there
,
came
upon
Prince
Andrew
.
On
seeing
the
young
master
,
*NL*
the
elder
one
with
frightened
look
clutched
her
younger
companion
by
the
*NL*
hand
and
hid
with
her
behind
a
birch
tree
,
not
stopping
to
pick
up
some
*NL*
green
plums
they
had
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
turned
away
with
startled
haste
,
unwilling
to
let
them
see
*NL*
that
they
had
been
observed
.
He
was
sorry
for
the
pretty
frightened
*NL*
little
girl
,
was
afraid
of
looking
at
her
,
and
yet
felt
an
irresistible
*NL*
desire
to
do
so
.
A
new
sensation
of
comfort
and
relief
came
over
him
*NL*
when
,
seeing
these
girls
,
he
realized
the
existence
of
other
human
*NL*
interests
entirely
aloof
from
his
own
and
just
as
legitimate
as
those
*NL*
that
occupied
him
.
Evidently
these
girls
passionately
desired
one
thing
-
*NL*
-
to
carry
away
and
eat
those
green
plums
without
being
caught
--
and
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
shared
their
wish
for
the
success
of
their
enterprise
.
He
*NL*
could
not
resist
looking
at
them
once
more
.
Believing
their
danger
past
,
*NL*
they
sprang
from
their
ambush
and
,
chirruping
something
in
their
shrill
*NL*
little
voices
and
holding
up
their
skirts
,
their
bare
little
sunburned
*NL*
feet
scampered
merrily
and
quickly
across
the
meadow
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
somewhat
refreshed
by
having
ridden
off
the
dusty
*NL*
highroad
along
which
the
troops
were
moving
.
But
not
far
from
Bald
Hills
*NL*
he
again
came
out
on
the
road
and
overtook
his
regiment
at
its
halting
*NL*
place
by
the
dam
of
a
small
pond
.
It
was
past
one
o'clock
.
The
sun
,
a
*NL*
red
ball
through
the
dust
,
burned
and
scorched
his
back
intolerably
*NL*
through
his
black
coat
.
The
dust
always
hung
motionless
above
the
buzz
*NL*
of
talk
that
came
from
the
resting
troops
.
There
was
no
wind
.
As
he
*NL*
crossed
the
dam
Prince
Andrew
smelled
the
ooze
and
freshness
of
the
*NL*
pond
.
He
longed
to
get
into
that
water
,
however
dirty
it
might
be
,
and
*NL*
he
glanced
round
at
the
pool
from
whence
came
sounds
of
shrieks
and
*NL*
laughter
.
The
small
,
muddy
,
green
pond
had
risen
visibly
more
than
a
*NL*
foot
,
flooding
the
dam
,
because
it
was
full
of
the
naked
white
bodies
of
*NL*
soldiers
with
brick-red
hands
,
necks
,
and
faces
,
who
were
splashing
*NL*
about
in
it
.
All
this
naked
white
human
flesh
,
laughing
and
shrieking
,
*NL*
floundered
about
in
that
dirty
pool
like
carp
stuffed
into
a
watering
*NL*
can
,
and
the
suggestion
of
merriment
in
that
floundering
mass
rendered
*NL*
it
specially
pathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fair-haired
young
soldier
of
the
third
company
,
whom
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
knew
and
who
had
a
strap
round
the
calf
of
one
leg
,
crossed
himself
,
*NL*
stepped
back
to
get
a
good
run
,
and
plunged
into
the
water
;
another
,
a
*NL*
dark
noncommissioned
officer
who
was
always
shaggy
,
stood
up
to
his
*NL*
waist
in
the
water
joyfully
wriggling
his
muscular
figure
and
snorted
*NL*
with
satisfaction
as
he
poured
the
water
over
his
head
with
hands
*NL*
blackened
to
the
wrists
.
There
were
sounds
of
men
slapping
one
another
,
*NL*
yelling
,
and
puffing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
on
the
bank
,
on
the
dam
,
and
in
the
pond
,
there
was
healthy
,
*NL*
white
,
muscular
flesh
.
The
officer
,
Timokhin
,
with
his
red
little
nose
,
*NL*
standing
on
the
dam
wiping
himself
with
a
towel
,
felt
confused
at
seeing
*NL*
the
prince
,
but
made
up
his
mind
to
address
him
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
nice
,
your
excellency
!
Would
n't
you
like
to
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
dirty
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
making
a
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
clear
it
out
for
you
in
a
minute
,
''
said
Timokhin
,
and
,
still
*NL*
undressed
,
ran
off
to
clear
the
men
out
of
the
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prince
wants
to
bathe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
prince
?
Ours
?
''
said
many
voices
,
and
the
men
were
in
such
haste
to
*NL*
clear
out
that
the
prince
could
hardly
stop
them
.
He
decided
that
he
*NL*
would
rather
wash
himself
with
water
in
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flesh
,
bodies
,
cannon
fodder
!
''
he
thought
,
and
he
looked
at
his
own
*NL*
naked
body
and
shuddered
,
not
from
cold
but
from
a
sense
of
disgust
and
*NL*
horror
he
did
not
himself
understand
,
aroused
by
the
sight
of
that
*NL*
immense
number
of
bodies
splashing
about
in
the
dirty
pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
seventh
of
August
Prince
Bagration
wrote
as
follows
from
his
*NL*
quarters
at
Mikhaylovna
on
the
Smolensk
road
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Count
Alexis
Andreevich
--
-LRB-
He
was
writing
to
Arakcheev
but
knew
that
*NL*
his
letter
would
be
read
by
the
Emperor
,
and
therefore
weighed
every
*NL*
word
in
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
expect
the
Minister
-LRB-
Barclay
de
Tolly
-RRB-
has
already
reported
the
*NL*
abandonment
of
Smolensk
to
the
enemy
.
It
is
pitiable
and
sad
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
army
is
in
despair
that
this
most
important
place
has
been
*NL*
wantonly
abandoned
.
I
,
for
my
part
,
begged
him
personally
most
urgently
*NL*
and
finally
wrote
him
,
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
consent
.
I
swear
*NL*
to
you
on
my
honor
that
Napoleon
was
in
such
a
fix
as
never
before
and
*NL*
might
have
lost
half
his
army
but
could
not
have
taken
Smolensk
.
Our
*NL*
troops
fought
,
and
are
fighting
,
as
never
before
.
With
fifteen
thousand
*NL*
men
I
held
the
enemy
at
bay
for
thirty-five
hours
and
beat
him
;
but
he
*NL*
would
not
hold
out
even
for
fourteen
hours
.
It
is
disgraceful
,
a
stain
*NL*
on
our
army
,
and
as
for
him
,
he
ought
,
it
seems
to
me
,
not
to
live
.
If
*NL*
he
reports
that
our
losses
were
great
,
it
is
not
true
;
perhaps
about
*NL*
four
thousand
,
not
more
,
and
not
even
that
;
but
even
were
they
ten
*NL*
thousand
,
that
's
war
!
But
the
enemy
has
lost
masses
...
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
it
have
cost
him
to
hold
out
for
another
two
days
?
They
would
*NL*
have
had
to
retire
of
their
own
accord
,
for
they
had
no
water
for
men
or
*NL*
horses
.
He
gave
me
his
word
he
would
not
retreat
,
but
suddenly
sent
*NL*
instructions
that
he
was
retiring
that
night
.
We
can
not
fight
in
this
*NL*
way
,
or
we
may
soon
bring
the
enemy
to
Moscow
...
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
rumor
that
you
are
thinking
of
peace
.
God
forbid
that
you
*NL*
should
make
peace
after
all
our
sacrifices
and
such
insane
retreats
!
You
*NL*
would
set
all
Russia
against
you
and
every
one
of
us
would
feel
ashamed
*NL*
to
wear
the
uniform
.
If
it
has
come
to
this
--
we
must
fight
as
long
as
*NL*
Russia
can
and
as
long
as
there
are
men
able
to
stand
...
*NL*
*NL*
One
man
ought
to
be
in
command
,
and
not
two
.
Your
Minister
may
perhaps
*NL*
be
good
as
a
Minister
,
but
as
a
general
he
is
not
merely
bad
but
*NL*
execrable
,
yet
to
him
is
entrusted
the
fate
of
our
whole
country
...
I
*NL*
am
really
frantic
with
vexation
;
forgive
my
writing
boldly
.
It
is
clear
*NL*
that
the
man
who
advocates
the
conclusion
of
a
peace
,
and
that
the
*NL*
Minister
should
command
the
army
,
does
not
love
our
sovereign
and
*NL*
desires
the
ruin
of
us
all
.
So
I
write
you
frankly
:
call
out
the
*NL*
militia
.
For
the
Minister
is
leading
these
visitors
after
him
to
Moscow
*NL*
in
a
most
masterly
way
.
The
whole
army
feels
great
suspicion
of
the
*NL*
Imperial
aide-de-camp
Wolzogen
.
He
is
said
to
be
more
Napoleon
's
man
*NL*
than
ours
,
and
he
is
always
advising
the
Minister
.
I
am
not
merely
civil
*NL*
to
him
but
obey
him
like
a
corporal
,
though
I
am
his
senior
.
This
is
*NL*
painful
,
but
,
loving
my
benefactor
and
sovereign
,
I
submit
.
Only
I
am
*NL*
sorry
for
the
Emperor
that
he
entrusts
our
fine
army
to
such
as
he
.
*NL*
Consider
that
on
our
retreat
we
have
lost
by
fatigue
and
left
in
the
*NL*
hospital
more
than
fifteen
thousand
men
,
and
had
we
attacked
this
would
*NL*
not
have
happened
.
Tell
me
,
for
God
's
sake
,
what
will
Russia
,
our
mother
*NL*
Russia
,
say
to
our
being
so
frightened
,
and
why
are
we
abandoning
our
*NL*
good
and
gallant
Fatherland
to
such
rabble
and
implanting
feelings
of
*NL*
hatred
and
shame
in
all
our
subjects
?
What
are
we
scared
at
and
of
whom
*NL*
are
we
afraid
?
I
am
not
to
blame
that
the
Minister
is
vacillating
,
a
*NL*
coward
,
dense
,
dilatory
,
and
has
all
bad
qualities
.
The
whole
army
*NL*
bewails
it
and
calls
down
curses
upon
him
...

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
innumerable
categories
applicable
to
the
phenomena
of
human
*NL*
life
one
may
discriminate
between
those
in
which
substance
prevails
and
*NL*
those
in
which
form
prevails
.
To
the
latter
--
as
distinguished
from
*NL*
village
,
country
,
provincial
,
or
even
Moscow
life
--
we
may
allot
*NL*
Petersburg
life
,
and
especially
the
life
of
its
salons
.
That
life
of
the
*NL*
salons
is
unchanging
.
Since
the
year
1805
we
had
made
peace
and
had
*NL*
again
quarreled
with
Bonaparte
and
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade
*NL*
them
again
,
but
the
salons
of
Anna
Pavlovna
and
Helene
remained
just
as
*NL*
they
had
been
--
the
one
seven
and
the
other
five
years
before
.
At
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
's
they
talked
with
perplexity
of
Bonaparte
's
successes
just
as
*NL*
before
and
saw
in
them
and
in
the
subservience
shown
to
him
by
the
*NL*
European
sovereigns
a
malicious
conspiracy
,
the
sole
object
of
which
was
*NL*
to
cause
unpleasantness
and
anxiety
to
the
court
circle
of
which
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
was
the
representative
.
And
in
Helene
's
salon
,
which
Rumyantsev
*NL*
himself
honored
with
his
visits
,
regarding
Helene
as
a
remarkably
*NL*
intelligent
woman
,
they
talked
with
the
same
ecstasy
in
1812
as
in
1808
*NL*
of
the
``
great
nation
''
and
the
``
great
man
,
''
and
regretted
our
rupture
*NL*
with
France
,
a
rupture
which
,
according
to
them
,
ought
to
be
promptly
*NL*
terminated
by
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
late
,
since
the
Emperor
's
return
from
the
army
,
there
had
been
some
*NL*
excitement
in
these
conflicting
salon
circles
and
some
demonstrations
of
*NL*
hostility
to
one
another
,
but
each
camp
retained
its
own
tendency
.
In
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
circle
only
those
Frenchmen
were
admitted
who
were
deep
-
*NL*
rooted
legitimists
,
and
patriotic
views
were
expressed
to
the
effect
*NL*
that
one
ought
not
to
go
to
the
French
theater
and
that
to
maintain
the
*NL*
French
troupe
was
costing
the
government
as
much
as
a
whole
army
corps
.
*NL*
The
progress
of
the
war
was
eagerly
followed
,
and
only
the
reports
most
*NL*
flattering
to
our
army
were
circulated
.
In
the
French
circle
of
Helene
*NL*
and
Rumyantsev
the
reports
of
the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
and
of
the
war
*NL*
were
contradicted
and
all
Napoleon
's
attempts
at
conciliation
were
*NL*
discussed
.
In
that
circle
they
discountenanced
those
who
advised
hurried
*NL*
preparations
for
a
removal
to
Kazan
of
the
court
and
the
girls
'
*NL*
educational
establishments
under
the
patronage
of
the
Dowager
Empress
.
*NL*
In
Helene
's
circle
the
war
in
general
was
regarded
as
a
series
of
formal
*NL*
demonstrations
which
would
very
soon
end
in
peace
,
and
the
view
*NL*
prevailed
expressed
by
Bilibin
--
who
now
in
Petersburg
was
quite
at
home
*NL*
in
Helene
's
house
,
which
every
clever
man
was
obliged
to
visit
--
that
not
*NL*
by
gunpowder
but
by
those
who
invented
it
would
matters
be
settled
.
In
*NL*
that
circle
the
Moscow
enthusiasm
--
news
of
which
had
reached
Petersburg
*NL*
simultaneously
with
the
Emperor
's
return
--
was
ridiculed
sarcastically
*NL*
and
very
cleverly
,
though
with
much
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
circle
on
the
contrary
was
enraptured
by
this
enthusiasm
*NL*
and
spoke
of
it
as
Plutarch
speaks
of
the
deeds
of
the
ancients
.
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
,
who
still
occupied
his
former
important
posts
,
formed
a
*NL*
connecting
link
between
these
two
circles
.
He
visited
his
``
good
friend
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
''
as
well
as
his
daughter
's
``
diplomatic
salon
,
''
and
often
*NL*
in
his
constant
comings
and
goings
between
the
two
camps
became
confused
*NL*
and
said
at
Helene
's
what
he
should
have
said
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
and
*NL*
vice
versa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
Emperor
's
return
Prince
Vasili
in
a
conversation
about
*NL*
the
war
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
severely
condemned
Barclay
de
Tolly
,
but
was
*NL*
undecided
as
to
who
ought
to
be
appointed
commander-in-chief
.
One
of
the
*NL*
visitors
,
usually
spoken
of
as
``
a
man
of
great
merit
,
''
having
described
*NL*
how
he
had
that
day
seen
Kutuzov
,
the
newly
chosen
chief
of
the
*NL*
Petersburg
militia
,
presiding
over
the
enrollment
of
recruits
at
the
*NL*
Treasury
,
cautiously
ventured
to
suggest
that
Kutuzov
would
be
the
man
*NL*
to
satisfy
all
requirements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
remarked
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
Kutuzov
had
done
*NL*
nothing
but
cause
the
Emperor
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
talked
and
talked
at
the
Assembly
of
the
Nobility
,
''
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
interrupted
,
``
but
they
did
not
listen
to
me
.
I
told
them
his
*NL*
election
as
chief
of
the
militia
would
not
please
the
Emperor
.
They
did
*NL*
not
listen
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
this
mania
for
opposition
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
And
who
for
?
It
is
*NL*
all
because
we
want
to
ape
the
foolish
enthusiasm
of
those
Muscovites
,
''
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
continued
,
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
though
at
Helene
's
*NL*
one
had
to
ridicule
the
Moscow
enthusiasm
,
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
one
had
to
*NL*
be
ecstatic
about
it
.
But
he
retrieved
his
mistake
at
once
.
``
Now
,
is
it
*NL*
suitable
that
Count
Kutuzov
,
the
oldest
general
in
Russia
,
should
*NL*
preside
at
that
tribunal
?
He
will
get
nothing
for
his
pains
!
How
could
*NL*
they
make
a
man
commander-in-chief
who
can
not
mount
a
horse
,
who
drops
*NL*
asleep
at
a
council
,
and
has
the
very
worst
morals
!
A
good
reputation
he
*NL*
made
for
himself
at
Bucharest
!
I
do
n't
speak
of
his
capacity
as
a
*NL*
general
,
but
at
a
time
like
this
how
they
appoint
a
decrepit
,
blind
old
*NL*
man
,
positively
blind
?
A
fine
idea
to
have
a
blind
general
!
He
ca
n't
see
*NL*
anything
.
To
play
blindman
's
bluff
?
He
ca
n't
see
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
to
his
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
quite
correct
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
July
.
But
on
the
twenty
-
*NL*
ninth
of
July
Kutuzov
received
the
title
of
Prince
.
This
might
indicate
*NL*
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
therefore
Prince
Vasili
's
opinion
*NL*
continued
to
be
correct
though
he
was
not
now
in
any
hurry
to
express
*NL*
it
.
But
on
the
eighth
of
August
a
committee
,
consisting
of
Field
Marshal
*NL*
Saltykov
,
Arakcheev
,
Vyazmitinov
,
Lopukhin
,
and
Kochubey
met
to
consider
*NL*
the
progress
of
the
war
.
This
committee
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
*NL*
failures
were
due
to
a
want
of
unity
in
the
command
and
though
the
*NL*
members
of
the
committee
were
aware
of
the
Emperor
's
dislike
of
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
after
a
short
deliberation
they
agreed
to
advise
his
appointment
as
*NL*
commander
in
chief
.
That
same
day
Kutuzov
was
appointed
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
with
full
powers
over
the
armies
and
over
the
whole
region
*NL*
occupied
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
ninth
of
August
Prince
Vasili
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
again
met
the
*NL*
``
man
of
great
merit
.
''
The
latter
was
very
attentive
to
Anna
Pavlovna
*NL*
because
he
wanted
to
be
appointed
director
of
one
of
the
educational
*NL*
establishments
for
young
ladies
.
Prince
Vasili
entered
the
room
with
the
*NL*
air
of
a
happy
conqueror
who
has
attained
the
object
of
his
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
heard
the
great
news
?
Prince
Kutuzov
is
field
marshal
!
*NL*
All
dissensions
are
at
an
end
!
I
am
so
glad
,
so
delighted
!
At
last
we
*NL*
have
a
man
!
''
said
he
,
glancing
sternly
and
significantly
round
at
*NL*
everyone
in
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
man
of
great
merit
,
''
despite
his
desire
to
obtain
the
post
of
*NL*
director
,
could
not
refrain
from
reminding
Prince
Vasili
of
his
former
*NL*
opinion
.
Though
this
was
impolite
to
Prince
Vasili
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
*NL*
drawing
room
,
and
also
to
Anna
Pavlovna
herself
who
had
received
the
*NL*
news
with
delight
,
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Prince
,
they
say
he
is
blind
!
''
said
he
,
reminding
Prince
Vasili
of
*NL*
his
own
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Nonsense
!
He
sees
well
enough
,
''
said
Prince
Vasili
rapidly
,
in
a
*NL*
deep
voice
and
with
a
slight
cough
--
the
voice
and
cough
with
which
he
*NL*
was
wont
to
dispose
of
all
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sees
well
enough
,
''
he
added
.
``
And
what
I
am
so
pleased
about
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
``
is
that
our
sovereign
has
given
him
full
powers
over
all
the
*NL*
armies
and
the
whole
region
--
powers
no
commander-in-chief
ever
had
*NL*
before
.
He
is
a
second
autocrat
,
''
he
concluded
with
a
victorious
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
!
God
grant
it
!
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
man
of
great
merit
,
''
who
was
still
a
novice
in
court
circles
,
*NL*
wishing
to
flatter
Anna
Pavlovna
by
defending
her
former
position
on
*NL*
this
question
,
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
said
that
the
Emperor
was
reluctant
to
give
Kutuzov
those
powers
.
*NL*
They
say
he
blushed
like
a
girl
to
whom
Joconde
is
read
,
when
he
said
to
*NL*
Kutuzov
:
`
Your
Emperor
and
the
Fatherland
award
you
this
honor
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
heart
took
no
part
in
that
speech
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
warmly
rejoined
Prince
Vasili
,
who
would
not
now
yield
*NL*
Kutuzov
to
anyone
;
in
his
opinion
Kutuzov
was
not
only
admirable
*NL*
himself
,
but
was
adored
by
everybody
.
``
No
,
that
's
impossible
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
for
our
sovereign
appreciated
him
so
highly
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
only
that
Prince
Kutuzov
assumes
real
power
and
does
not
*NL*
allow
anyone
to
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel
,
''
observed
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Understanding
at
once
to
whom
she
alluded
,
Prince
Vasili
said
in
a
*NL*
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
for
a
fact
that
Kutuzov
made
it
an
absolute
condition
that
the
*NL*
Tsarevich
should
not
be
with
the
army
.
Do
you
know
what
he
said
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Prince
Vasili
repeated
the
words
supposed
to
have
been
spoken
by
*NL*
Kutuzov
to
the
Emperor
.
``
I
can
neither
punish
him
if
he
does
wrong
nor
*NL*
reward
him
if
he
does
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
very
wise
man
is
Prince
Kutuzov
!
I
have
known
him
a
long
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
even
say
,
''
remarked
the
``
man
of
great
merit
''
who
did
not
yet
*NL*
possess
courtly
tact
,
``
that
his
excellency
made
it
an
express
condition
*NL*
that
the
sovereign
himself
should
not
be
with
the
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
said
this
both
Prince
Vasili
and
Anna
Pavlovna
turned
away
*NL*
from
him
and
glanced
sadly
at
one
another
with
a
sigh
at
his
naivete
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
taking
place
in
Petersburg
the
French
had
already
passed
*NL*
Smolensk
and
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
Moscow
.
Napoleon
's
*NL*
historian
Thiers
,
like
other
of
his
historians
,
trying
to
justify
his
*NL*
hero
says
that
he
was
drawn
to
the
walls
of
Moscow
against
his
will
.
He
*NL*
is
as
right
as
other
historians
who
look
for
the
explanation
of
historic
*NL*
events
in
the
will
of
one
man
;
he
is
as
right
as
the
Russian
historians
*NL*
who
maintain
that
Napoleon
was
drawn
to
Moscow
by
the
skill
of
the
*NL*
Russian
commanders
.
Here
besides
the
law
of
retrospection
,
which
regards
*NL*
all
the
past
as
a
preparation
for
events
that
subsequently
occur
,
the
*NL*
law
of
reciprocity
comes
in
,
confusing
the
whole
matter
.
A
good
*NL*
chessplayer
having
lost
a
game
is
sincerely
convinced
that
his
loss
*NL*
resulted
from
a
mistake
he
made
and
looks
for
that
mistake
in
the
*NL*
opening
,
but
forgets
that
at
each
stage
of
the
game
there
were
similar
*NL*
mistakes
and
that
none
of
his
moves
were
perfect
.
He
only
notices
the
*NL*
mistake
to
which
he
pays
attention
,
because
his
opponent
took
advantage
*NL*
of
it
.
How
much
more
complex
than
this
is
the
game
of
war
,
which
occurs
*NL*
under
certain
limits
of
time
,
and
where
it
is
not
one
will
that
*NL*
manipulates
lifeless
objects
,
but
everything
results
from
innumerable
*NL*
conflicts
of
various
wills
!
*NL*
*NL*
After
Smolensk
Napoleon
sought
a
battle
beyond
Dorogobuzh
at
Vyazma
,
and
*NL*
then
at
Tsarevo-Zaymishche
,
but
it
happened
that
owing
to
a
conjunction
*NL*
of
innumerable
circumstances
the
Russians
could
not
give
battle
till
*NL*
they
reached
Borodino
,
seventy
miles
from
Moscow
.
From
Vyazma
Napoleon
*NL*
ordered
a
direct
advance
on
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moscou
,
la
capitale
asiatique
de
ce
grand
empire
,
la
ville
sacree
des
*NL*
peuples
d'Alexandre
,
Moscou
avec
ses
innombrables
eglises
en
forme
de
*NL*
pagodes
chinoises
,
*
this
Moscow
gave
Napoleon
's
imagination
no
rest
.
On
*NL*
the
march
from
Vyazma
to
Tsarevo-Zaymishche
he
rode
his
light
bay
*NL*
bobtailed
ambler
accompanied
by
his
Guards
,
his
bodyguard
,
his
pages
,
*NL*
and
aides-de-camp
.
Berthier
,
his
chief
of
staff
,
dropped
behind
to
*NL*
question
a
Russian
prisoner
captured
by
the
cavalry
.
Followed
by
*NL*
Lelorgne
d'Ideville
,
an
interpreter
,
he
overtook
Napoleon
at
a
gallop
*NL*
and
reined
in
his
horse
with
an
amused
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Moscow
,
the
Asiatic
capital
of
this
great
empire
,
the
sacred
city
of
*NL*
Alexander
's
people
,
Moscow
with
its
innumerable
churches
shaped
like
*NL*
Chinese
pagodas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
Platov
's
Cossacks
says
that
Platov
's
corps
is
joining
up
with
*NL*
the
main
army
and
that
Kutuzov
has
been
appointed
commander-in-chief
.
He
*NL*
is
a
very
shrewd
and
garrulous
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
smiled
and
told
them
to
give
the
Cossack
a
horse
and
bring
the
*NL*
man
to
him
.
He
wished
to
talk
to
him
himself
.
Several
adjutants
galloped
*NL*
off
,
and
an
hour
later
,
Lavrushka
,
the
serf
Denisov
had
handed
over
to
*NL*
Rostov
,
rode
up
to
Napoleon
in
an
orderly
's
jacket
and
on
a
French
*NL*
cavalry
saddle
,
with
a
merry
,
and
tipsy
face
.
Napoleon
told
him
to
ride
*NL*
by
his
side
and
began
questioning
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
Cossack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
Cossack
,
your
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Cossack
,
not
knowing
in
what
company
he
was
,
for
Napoleon
's
plain
*NL*
appearance
had
nothing
about
it
that
would
reveal
to
an
Oriental
mind
*NL*
the
presence
of
a
monarch
,
talked
with
extreme
familiarity
of
the
*NL*
incidents
of
the
war
,
''
says
Thiers
,
narrating
this
episode
.
In
reality
*NL*
Lavrushka
,
having
got
drunk
the
day
before
and
left
his
master
*NL*
dinnerless
,
had
been
whipped
and
sent
to
the
village
in
quest
of
*NL*
chickens
,
where
he
engaged
in
looting
till
the
French
took
him
prisoner
.
*NL*
Lavrushka
was
one
of
those
coarse
,
bare-faced
lackeys
who
have
seen
all
*NL*
sorts
of
things
,
consider
it
necessary
to
do
everything
in
a
mean
and
*NL*
cunning
way
,
are
ready
to
render
any
sort
of
service
to
their
master
,
*NL*
and
are
keen
at
guessing
their
master
's
baser
impulses
,
especially
those
*NL*
prompted
by
vanity
and
pettiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
himself
in
the
company
of
Napoleon
,
whose
identity
he
had
easily
*NL*
and
surely
recognized
,
Lavrushka
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
but
merely
*NL*
did
his
utmost
to
gain
his
new
master
's
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
very
well
that
this
was
Napoleon
,
but
Napoleon
's
presence
could
*NL*
no
more
intimidate
him
than
Rostov
's
,
or
a
sergeant
major
's
with
the
*NL*
rods
,
would
have
done
,
for
he
had
nothing
that
either
the
sergeant
major
*NL*
or
Napoleon
could
deprive
him
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
rattled
on
,
telling
all
the
gossip
he
had
heard
among
the
*NL*
orderlies
.
Much
of
it
true
.
But
when
Napoleon
asked
him
whether
the
*NL*
Russians
thought
they
would
beat
Bonaparte
or
not
,
Lavrushka
screwed
up
*NL*
his
eyes
and
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
question
he
saw
subtle
cunning
,
as
men
of
his
type
see
cunning
*NL*
in
everything
,
so
he
frowned
and
did
not
answer
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
this
,
''
he
said
thoughtfully
,
``
if
there
's
a
battle
soon
,
yours
*NL*
will
win
.
That
's
right
.
But
if
three
days
pass
,
then
after
that
,
well
,
*NL*
then
that
same
battle
will
not
soon
be
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lelorgne
d'Ideville
smilingly
interpreted
this
speech
to
Napoleon
thus
:
*NL*
``
If
a
battle
takes
place
within
the
next
three
days
the
French
will
win
,
*NL*
but
if
later
,
God
knows
what
will
happen
.
''
Napoleon
did
not
smile
,
*NL*
though
he
was
evidently
in
high
good
humor
,
and
he
ordered
these
words
*NL*
to
be
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lavrushka
noticed
this
and
to
entertain
him
further
,
pretending
not
to
*NL*
know
who
Napoleon
was
,
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
that
you
have
Bonaparte
and
that
he
has
beaten
everybody
in
the
*NL*
world
,
but
we
are
a
different
matter
...
''
--
without
knowing
why
or
how
*NL*
this
bit
of
boastful
patriotism
slipped
out
at
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interpreter
translated
these
words
without
the
last
phrase
,
and
*NL*
Bonaparte
smiled
.
``
The
young
Cossack
made
his
mighty
interlocutor
*NL*
smile
,
''
says
Thiers
.
After
riding
a
few
paces
in
silence
,
Napoleon
*NL*
turned
to
Berthier
and
said
he
wished
to
see
how
the
news
that
he
was
*NL*
talking
to
the
Emperor
himself
,
to
that
very
Emperor
who
had
written
his
*NL*
immortally
victorious
name
on
the
Pyramids
,
would
affect
this
enfant
du
*NL*
Don
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Child
of
the
Don
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
accordingly
conveyed
to
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lavrushka
,
understanding
that
this
was
done
to
perplex
him
and
that
*NL*
Napoleon
expected
him
to
be
frightened
,
to
gratify
his
new
masters
*NL*
promptly
pretended
to
be
astonished
and
awe-struck
,
opened
his
eyes
*NL*
wide
,
and
assumed
the
expression
he
usually
put
on
when
taken
to
be
*NL*
whipped
.
``
As
soon
as
Napoleon
's
interpreter
had
spoken
,
''
says
Thiers
,
*NL*
``
the
Cossack
,
seized
by
amazement
,
did
not
utter
another
word
,
but
rode
*NL*
on
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
conqueror
whose
fame
had
reached
him
across
*NL*
the
steppes
of
the
East
.
All
his
loquacity
was
suddenly
arrested
and
*NL*
replaced
by
a
naive
and
silent
feeling
of
admiration
.
Napoleon
,
after
*NL*
making
the
Cossack
a
present
,
had
him
set
free
like
a
bird
restored
to
*NL*
its
native
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
rode
on
,
dreaming
of
the
Moscow
that
so
appealed
to
his
*NL*
imagination
,
and
``
the
bird
restored
to
its
native
fields
''
galloped
to
*NL*
our
outposts
,
inventing
on
the
way
all
that
had
not
taken
place
but
that
*NL*
he
meant
to
relate
to
his
comrades
.
What
had
really
taken
place
he
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
relate
because
it
seemed
to
him
not
worth
telling
.
He
found
*NL*
the
Cossacks
,
inquired
for
the
regiment
operating
with
Platov
's
*NL*
detachment
and
by
evening
found
his
master
,
Nicholas
Rostov
,
quartered
*NL*
at
Yankovo
.
Rostov
was
just
mounting
to
go
for
a
ride
round
the
*NL*
neighboring
villages
with
Ilyin
;
he
let
Lavrushka
have
another
horse
and
*NL*
took
him
along
with
him
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
not
in
Moscow
and
out
of
danger
as
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
return
of
Alpatych
from
Smolensk
the
old
prince
suddenly
*NL*
seemed
to
awake
as
from
a
dream
.
He
ordered
the
militiamen
to
be
called
*NL*
up
from
the
villages
and
armed
,
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
informing
him
that
he
had
resolved
to
remain
at
Bald
Hills
to
the
*NL*
last
extremity
and
to
defend
it
,
leaving
to
the
commander-in-chief
's
*NL*
discretion
to
take
measures
or
not
for
the
defense
of
Bald
Hills
,
where
*NL*
one
of
Russia
's
oldest
generals
would
be
captured
or
killed
,
and
he
*NL*
announced
to
his
household
that
he
would
remain
at
Bald
Hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
himself
remaining
,
he
gave
instructions
for
the
departure
of
*NL*
the
princess
and
Dessalles
with
the
little
prince
to
Bogucharovo
and
*NL*
thence
to
Moscow
.
Princess
Mary
,
alarmed
by
her
father
's
feverish
and
*NL*
sleepless
activity
after
his
previous
apathy
,
could
not
bring
herself
to
*NL*
leave
him
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ventured
to
disobey
*NL*
him
.
She
refused
to
go
away
and
her
father
's
fury
broke
over
her
in
a
*NL*
terrible
storm
.
He
repeated
every
injustice
he
had
ever
inflicted
on
*NL*
her
.
Trying
to
convict
her
,
he
told
her
she
had
worn
him
out
,
had
caused
*NL*
his
quarrel
with
his
son
,
had
harbored
nasty
suspicions
of
him
,
making
*NL*
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
poison
his
existence
,
and
he
drove
her
from
*NL*
his
study
telling
her
that
if
she
did
not
go
away
it
was
all
the
same
to
*NL*
him
.
He
declared
that
he
did
not
wish
to
remember
her
existence
and
*NL*
warned
her
not
to
dare
to
let
him
see
her
.
The
fact
that
he
did
not
,
as
*NL*
she
had
feared
,
order
her
to
be
carried
away
by
force
but
only
told
her
*NL*
not
to
let
him
see
her
cheered
Princess
Mary
.
She
knew
it
was
a
proof
*NL*
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
was
glad
she
was
remaining
at
home
and
*NL*
had
not
gone
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
little
Nicholas
had
left
,
the
old
prince
donned
his
*NL*
full
uniform
and
prepared
to
visit
the
commander-in-chief
.
His
caleche
*NL*
was
already
at
the
door
.
Princess
Mary
saw
him
walk
out
of
the
house
in
*NL*
his
uniform
wearing
all
his
orders
and
go
down
the
garden
to
review
his
*NL*
armed
peasants
and
domestic
serfs
.
She
sat
by
the
window
listening
to
*NL*
his
voice
which
reached
her
from
the
garden
.
Suddenly
several
men
came
*NL*
running
up
the
avenue
with
frightened
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
ran
out
to
the
porch
,
down
the
flower-bordered
path
,
and
*NL*
into
the
avenue
.
A
large
crowd
of
militiamen
and
domestics
were
moving
*NL*
toward
her
,
and
in
their
midst
several
men
were
supporting
by
the
*NL*
armpits
and
dragging
along
a
little
old
man
in
a
uniform
and
*NL*
decorations
.
She
ran
up
to
him
and
,
in
the
play
of
the
sunlight
that
*NL*
fell
in
small
round
spots
through
the
shade
of
the
lime-tree
avenue
,
*NL*
could
not
be
sure
what
change
there
was
in
his
face
.
All
she
could
see
*NL*
was
that
his
former
stern
and
determined
expression
had
altered
to
one
*NL*
of
timidity
and
submission
.
On
seeing
his
daughter
he
moved
his
helpless
*NL*
lips
and
made
a
hoarse
sound
.
It
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
*NL*
wanted
.
He
was
lifted
up
,
carried
to
his
study
,
and
laid
on
the
very
*NL*
couch
he
had
so
feared
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
who
was
fetched
that
same
night
,
bled
him
and
said
that
the
*NL*
prince
had
had
a
seizure
paralyzing
his
right
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
becoming
more
and
more
dangerous
to
remain
at
Bald
Hills
,
and
*NL*
next
day
they
moved
the
prince
to
Bogucharovo
,
the
doctor
accompanying
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
they
reached
Bogucharovo
,
Dessalles
and
the
little
prince
*NL*
had
already
left
for
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
weeks
the
old
prince
lay
stricken
by
paralysis
in
the
new
*NL*
house
Prince
Andrew
had
built
at
Bogucharovo
,
ever
in
the
same
state
,
*NL*
getting
neither
better
nor
worse
.
He
was
unconscious
and
lay
like
a
*NL*
distorted
corpse
.
He
muttered
unceasingly
,
his
eyebrows
and
lips
*NL*
twitching
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
understood
what
was
*NL*
going
on
around
him
or
not
.
One
thing
was
certain
--
that
he
was
suffering
*NL*
and
wished
to
say
something
.
But
what
it
was
,
no
one
could
tell
:
it
*NL*
might
be
some
caprice
of
a
sick
and
half-crazy
man
,
or
it
might
relate
*NL*
to
public
affairs
,
or
possibly
to
family
concerns
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
said
this
restlessness
did
not
mean
anything
and
was
due
to
*NL*
physical
causes
;
but
Princess
Mary
thought
he
wished
to
tell
her
*NL*
something
,
and
the
fact
that
her
presence
always
increased
his
*NL*
restlessness
confirmed
her
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
evidently
suffering
both
physically
and
mentally
.
There
was
no
*NL*
hope
of
recovery
.
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
travel
,
it
would
not
do
*NL*
to
let
him
die
on
the
road
.
``
Would
it
not
be
better
if
the
end
did
come
,
*NL*
the
very
end
?
''
Princess
Mary
sometimes
thought
.
Night
and
day
,
hardly
*NL*
sleeping
at
all
,
she
watched
him
and
,
terrible
to
say
,
often
watched
him
*NL*
not
with
hope
of
finding
signs
of
improvement
but
wishing
to
find
*NL*
symptoms
of
the
approach
of
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
as
it
was
to
her
to
acknowledge
this
feeling
in
herself
,
yet
*NL*
there
it
was
.
And
what
seemed
still
more
terrible
to
her
was
that
since
*NL*
her
father
's
illness
began
-LRB-
perhaps
even
sooner
,
when
she
stayed
with
*NL*
him
expecting
something
to
happen
-RRB-
,
all
the
personal
desires
and
hopes
*NL*
that
had
been
forgotten
or
sleeping
within
her
had
awakened
.
Thoughts
*NL*
that
had
not
entered
her
mind
for
years
--
thoughts
of
a
life
free
from
*NL*
the
fear
of
her
father
,
and
even
the
possibility
of
love
and
of
family
*NL*
happiness
--
floated
continually
in
her
imagination
like
temptations
of
*NL*
the
devil
.
Thrust
them
aside
as
she
would
,
questions
continually
*NL*
recurred
to
her
as
to
how
she
would
order
her
life
now
,
after
that
.
*NL*
These
were
temptations
of
the
devil
and
Princess
Mary
knew
it
.
She
knew
*NL*
that
the
sole
weapon
against
him
was
prayer
,
and
she
tried
to
pray
.
She
*NL*
assumed
an
attitude
of
prayer
,
looked
at
the
icons
,
repeated
the
words
*NL*
of
a
prayer
,
but
she
could
not
pray
.
She
felt
that
a
different
world
had
*NL*
now
taken
possession
of
her
--
the
life
of
a
world
of
strenuous
and
free
*NL*
activity
,
quite
opposed
to
the
spiritual
world
in
which
till
now
she
had
*NL*
been
confined
and
in
which
her
greatest
comfort
had
been
prayer
.
She
*NL*
could
not
pray
,
could
not
weep
,
and
worldly
cares
took
possession
of
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
becoming
dangerous
to
remain
in
Bogucharovo
.
News
of
the
approach
*NL*
of
the
French
came
from
all
sides
,
and
in
one
village
,
ten
miles
from
*NL*
Bogucharovo
,
a
homestead
had
been
looted
by
French
marauders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
moving
the
prince
;
the
*NL*
provincial
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
sent
an
official
to
Princess
Mary
to
*NL*
persuade
her
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
the
head
of
the
*NL*
rural
police
having
come
to
Bogucharovo
urged
the
same
thing
,
saying
*NL*
that
the
French
were
only
some
twenty-five
miles
away
,
that
French
*NL*
proclamations
were
circulating
in
the
villages
,
and
that
if
the
princess
*NL*
did
not
take
her
father
away
before
the
fifteenth
,
he
could
not
answer
*NL*
for
the
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
decided
to
leave
on
the
fifteenth
.
The
cares
of
preparation
*NL*
and
giving
orders
,
for
which
everyone
came
to
her
,
occupied
her
all
day
.
*NL*
She
spent
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
as
usual
,
without
undressing
,
in
*NL*
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
the
prince
lay
.
Several
times
,
waking
up
,
*NL*
she
heard
his
groans
and
muttering
,
the
creak
of
his
bed
,
and
the
steps
*NL*
of
Tikhon
and
the
doctor
when
they
turned
him
over
.
Several
times
she
*NL*
listened
at
the
door
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
mutterings
were
*NL*
louder
than
usual
and
that
they
turned
him
over
oftener
.
She
could
not
*NL*
sleep
and
several
times
went
to
the
door
and
listened
,
wishing
to
enter
*NL*
but
not
deciding
to
do
so
.
Though
he
did
not
speak
,
Princess
Mary
saw
*NL*
and
knew
how
unpleasant
every
sign
of
anxiety
on
his
account
was
to
him
.
*NL*
She
had
noticed
with
what
dissatisfaction
he
turned
from
the
look
she
*NL*
sometimes
involuntarily
fixed
on
him
.
She
knew
that
her
going
in
during
*NL*
the
night
at
an
unusual
hour
would
irritate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
never
had
she
felt
so
grieved
for
him
or
so
much
afraid
of
losing
*NL*
him
.
She
recalled
all
her
life
with
him
and
in
every
word
and
act
of
his
*NL*
found
an
expression
of
his
love
of
her
.
Occasionally
amid
these
memories
*NL*
temptations
of
the
devil
would
surge
into
her
imagination
:
thoughts
of
*NL*
how
things
would
be
after
his
death
,
and
how
her
new
,
liberated
life
*NL*
would
be
ordered
.
But
she
drove
these
thoughts
away
with
disgust
.
Toward
*NL*
morning
he
became
quiet
and
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
woke
late
.
That
sincerity
which
often
comes
with
waking
showed
her
*NL*
clearly
what
chiefly
concerned
her
about
her
father
's
illness
.
On
waking
*NL*
she
listened
to
what
was
going
on
behind
the
door
and
,
hearing
him
*NL*
groan
,
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
that
things
were
still
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
could
have
happened
?
What
did
I
want
?
I
want
his
death
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
with
a
feeling
of
loathing
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
washed
,
dressed
,
said
her
prayers
,
and
went
out
to
the
porch
.
In
*NL*
front
of
it
stood
carriages
without
horses
and
things
were
being
packed
*NL*
into
the
vehicles
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
gray
morning
.
Princess
Mary
stopped
at
the
porch
,
still
*NL*
horrified
by
her
spiritual
baseness
and
trying
to
arrange
her
thoughts
*NL*
before
going
to
her
father
.
The
doctor
came
downstairs
and
went
out
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
little
better
today
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
was
looking
for
you
.
One
can
*NL*
make
out
something
of
what
he
is
saying
.
His
head
is
clearer
.
Come
in
,
*NL*
he
is
asking
for
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
heart
beat
so
violently
at
this
news
that
she
grew
pale
*NL*
and
leaned
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
falling
.
To
see
him
,
talk
to
*NL*
him
,
feel
his
eyes
on
her
now
that
her
whole
soul
was
overflowing
with
*NL*
those
dreadful
,
wicked
temptations
,
was
a
torment
of
joy
and
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
entered
her
father
's
room
and
went
up
to
his
bed
.
He
was
*NL*
lying
on
his
back
propped
up
high
,
and
his
small
bony
hands
with
their
*NL*
knotted
purple
veins
were
lying
on
the
quilt
;
his
left
eye
gazed
*NL*
straight
before
him
,
his
right
eye
was
awry
,
and
his
brows
and
lips
*NL*
motionless
.
He
seemed
altogether
so
thin
,
small
,
and
pathetic
.
His
face
*NL*
seemed
to
have
shriveled
or
melted
;
his
features
had
grown
smaller
.
*NL*
Princess
Mary
went
up
and
kissed
his
hand
.
His
left
hand
pressed
hers
so
*NL*
that
she
understood
that
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
to
come
.
He
*NL*
twitched
her
hand
,
and
his
brows
and
lips
quivered
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
in
dismay
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
of
her
.
When
*NL*
she
changed
her
position
so
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
he
*NL*
calmed
down
,
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
for
some
seconds
.
Then
his
lips
*NL*
and
tongue
moved
,
sounds
came
,
and
he
began
to
speak
,
gazing
timidly
and
*NL*
imploringly
at
her
,
evidently
afraid
that
she
might
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Straining
all
her
faculties
Princess
Mary
looked
at
him
.
The
comic
*NL*
efforts
with
which
he
moved
his
tongue
made
her
drop
her
eyes
and
with
*NL*
difficulty
repress
the
sobs
that
rose
to
her
throat
.
He
said
something
,
*NL*
repeating
the
same
words
several
times
.
She
could
not
understand
them
,
*NL*
but
tried
to
guess
what
he
was
saying
and
inquiringly
repeated
the
words
*NL*
he
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mmm
...
ar
...
ate
...
ate
...
''
he
repeated
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
impossible
to
understand
these
sounds
.
The
doctor
thought
*NL*
he
had
guessed
them
,
and
inquiringly
repeated
:
``
Mary
,
are
you
afraid
?
''
*NL*
The
prince
shook
his
head
,
again
repeated
the
same
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mind
,
my
mind
aches
?
''
questioned
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
mumbling
sound
in
confirmation
of
this
,
took
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
began
pressing
it
to
different
parts
of
his
breast
as
if
trying
to
find
*NL*
the
right
place
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
thoughts
...
about
you
...
thoughts
...
''
he
then
uttered
much
more
*NL*
clearly
than
he
had
done
before
,
now
that
he
was
sure
of
being
*NL*
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
pressed
her
head
against
his
hand
,
trying
to
hide
her
sobs
*NL*
and
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
his
hand
over
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
calling
you
all
night
...
''
he
brought
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
I
had
known
...
''
she
said
through
her
tears
.
``
I
was
afraid
to
*NL*
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
n't
you
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
not
sleep
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unconsciously
imitating
her
father
,
she
now
tried
to
express
herself
as
*NL*
he
did
,
as
much
as
possible
by
signs
,
and
her
tongue
too
seemed
to
move
*NL*
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
one
...
Dearest
...
''
Princess
Mary
could
not
quite
make
out
what
he
*NL*
had
said
,
but
from
his
look
it
was
clear
that
he
had
uttered
a
tender
*NL*
caressing
word
such
as
he
had
never
used
to
her
before
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
*NL*
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
was
wishing
for
his
death
!
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
...
daughter
dear
!
...
for
all
,
for
all
...
forgive
!
...
thank
*NL*
you
!
...
forgive
!
...
thank
you
!
...
''
and
tears
began
to
flow
from
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Call
Andrew
!
''
he
said
suddenly
,
and
a
childish
,
timid
expression
*NL*
of
doubt
showed
itself
on
his
face
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
himself
seemed
aware
that
his
demand
was
meaningless
.
So
at
least
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
letter
from
him
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
with
timid
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
with
the
army
,
Father
,
at
Smolensk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
a
long
time
.
Then
as
if
in
answer
*NL*
to
his
doubts
and
to
confirm
the
fact
that
now
he
understood
and
*NL*
remembered
everything
,
he
nodded
his
head
and
reopened
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
softly
and
distinctly
.
``
Russia
has
perished
.
They
've
*NL*
destroyed
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
sob
,
and
again
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes
.
Princess
Mary
*NL*
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
wept
while
she
gazed
at
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
closed
his
eyes
.
His
sobs
ceased
,
he
pointed
to
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
Tikhon
,
understanding
him
,
wiped
away
the
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
again
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
none
of
them
could
*NL*
understand
for
a
long
time
,
till
at
last
Tikhon
understood
and
repeated
*NL*
it
.
Princess
Mary
had
sought
the
meaning
of
his
words
in
the
mood
in
*NL*
which
he
had
just
been
speaking
.
She
thought
he
was
speaking
of
Russia
,
*NL*
or
Prince
Andrew
,
of
herself
,
of
his
grandson
,
or
of
his
own
death
,
and
*NL*
so
she
could
not
guess
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
your
white
dress
.
I
like
it
,
''
was
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
understood
this
Princess
Mary
sobbed
still
louder
,
and
the
doctor
*NL*
taking
her
arm
led
her
out
to
the
veranda
,
soothing
her
and
trying
to
*NL*
persuade
her
to
prepare
for
her
journey
.
When
she
had
left
the
room
the
*NL*
prince
again
began
speaking
about
his
son
,
about
the
war
,
and
about
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
angrily
twitching
his
brows
and
raising
his
hoarse
voice
,
and
*NL*
then
he
had
a
second
and
final
stroke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
stayed
on
the
veranda
.
The
day
had
cleared
,
it
was
hot
and
*NL*
sunny
.
She
could
understand
nothing
,
think
of
nothing
and
feel
nothing
,
*NL*
except
passionate
love
for
her
father
,
love
such
as
she
thought
she
had
*NL*
never
felt
till
that
moment
.
She
ran
out
sobbing
into
the
garden
and
as
*NL*
far
as
the
pond
,
along
the
avenues
of
young
lime
trees
Prince
Andrew
had
*NL*
planted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I.
.
.
I.
.
.
I
wished
for
his
death
!
Yes
,
I
wanted
it
to
end
*NL*
quicker
...
I
wished
to
be
at
peace
...
And
what
will
become
of
me
?
What
*NL*
use
will
peace
be
when
he
is
no
longer
here
?
''
Princess
Mary
murmured
,
*NL*
pacing
the
garden
with
hurried
steps
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
bosom
*NL*
which
heaved
with
convulsive
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
completed
the
tour
of
the
garden
,
which
brought
her
again
*NL*
to
the
house
,
she
saw
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
--
who
had
remained
at
*NL*
Bogucharovo
and
did
not
wish
to
leave
it
--
coming
toward
her
with
a
*NL*
stranger
.
This
was
the
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
of
the
district
,
who
had
*NL*
come
personally
to
point
out
to
the
princess
the
necessity
for
her
*NL*
prompt
departure
.
Princess
Mary
listened
without
understanding
him
;
she
*NL*
led
him
to
the
house
,
offered
him
lunch
,
and
sat
down
with
him
.
Then
,
*NL*
excusing
herself
,
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
old
prince
's
room
.
The
*NL*
doctor
came
out
with
an
agitated
face
and
said
she
could
not
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Princess
!
Go
away
...
go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
slope
by
the
pond
,
where
no
one
could
see
her
.
She
did
not
know
how
long
*NL*
she
had
been
there
when
she
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
woman
's
*NL*
footsteps
running
along
the
path
.
She
rose
and
saw
Dunyasha
her
maid
,
*NL*
who
was
evidently
looking
for
her
,
and
who
stopped
suddenly
as
if
in
*NL*
alarm
on
seeing
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
,
Princess
...
The
Prince
,
''
said
Dunyasha
in
a
breaking
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
I
'm
coming
,
I
'm
coming
!
''
replied
the
princess
hurriedly
,
*NL*
not
giving
Dunyasha
time
to
finish
what
she
was
saying
,
and
trying
to
*NL*
avoid
seeing
the
girl
she
ran
toward
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
it
's
God
's
will
!
You
must
be
prepared
for
everything
,
''
said
*NL*
the
Marshal
,
meeting
her
at
the
house
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
;
it
's
not
true
!
''
she
cried
angrily
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
tried
to
stop
her
.
She
pushed
him
aside
and
ran
to
her
*NL*
father
's
door
.
``
Why
are
these
people
with
frightened
faces
stopping
me
?
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
any
of
them
!
And
what
are
they
doing
here
?
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
She
opened
the
door
and
the
bright
daylight
in
that
previously
darkened
*NL*
room
startled
her
.
In
the
room
were
her
nurse
and
other
women
.
They
all
*NL*
drew
back
from
the
bed
,
making
way
for
her
.
He
was
still
lying
on
the
*NL*
bed
as
before
,
but
the
stern
expression
of
his
quiet
face
made
Princess
*NL*
Mary
stop
short
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
not
dead
--
it
's
impossible
!
''
she
told
herself
and
approached
*NL*
him
,
and
repressing
the
terror
that
seized
her
,
she
pressed
her
lips
to
*NL*
his
cheek
.
But
she
stepped
back
immediately
.
All
the
force
of
the
*NL*
tenderness
she
had
been
feeling
for
him
vanished
instantly
and
was
*NL*
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
horror
at
what
lay
there
before
her
.
``
No
,
he
is
*NL*
no
more
!
He
is
not
,
but
here
where
he
was
is
something
unfamiliar
and
*NL*
hostile
,
some
dreadful
,
terrifying
,
and
repellent
mystery
!
''
And
hiding
*NL*
her
face
in
her
hands
,
Princess
Mary
sank
into
the
arms
of
the
doctor
,
*NL*
who
held
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
presence
of
Tikhon
and
the
doctor
the
women
washed
what
had
been
*NL*
the
prince
,
tied
his
head
up
with
a
handkerchief
that
the
mouth
should
*NL*
not
stiffen
while
open
,
and
with
another
handkerchief
tied
together
the
*NL*
legs
that
were
already
spreading
apart
.
Then
they
dressed
him
in
uniform
*NL*
with
his
decorations
and
placed
his
shriveled
little
body
on
a
table
.
*NL*
Heaven
only
knows
who
arranged
all
this
and
when
,
but
it
all
got
done
as
*NL*
if
of
its
own
accord
.
Toward
night
candles
were
burning
round
his
*NL*
coffin
,
a
pall
was
spread
over
it
,
the
floor
was
strewn
with
sprays
of
*NL*
juniper
,
a
printed
band
was
tucked
in
under
his
shriveled
head
,
and
in
a
*NL*
corner
of
the
room
sat
a
chanter
reading
the
psalms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
horses
shy
and
snort
and
gather
about
a
dead
horse
,
so
the
*NL*
inmates
of
the
house
and
strangers
crowded
into
the
drawing
room
round
*NL*
the
coffin
--
the
Marshal
,
the
village
Elder
,
peasant
women
--
and
all
with
*NL*
fixed
and
frightened
eyes
,
crossing
themselves
,
bowed
and
kissed
the
old
*NL*
prince
's
cold
and
stiffened
hand
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Until
Prince
Andrew
settled
in
Bogucharovo
its
owners
had
always
been
*NL*
absentees
,
and
its
peasants
were
of
quite
a
different
character
from
*NL*
those
of
Bald
Hills
.
They
differed
from
them
in
speech
,
dress
,
and
*NL*
disposition
.
They
were
called
steppe
peasants
.
The
old
prince
used
to
*NL*
approve
of
them
for
their
endurance
at
work
when
they
came
to
Bald
Hills
*NL*
to
help
with
the
harvest
or
to
dig
ponds
,
and
ditches
,
but
he
disliked
*NL*
them
for
their
boorishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
last
stay
at
Bogucharovo
,
when
he
introduced
hospitals
*NL*
and
schools
and
reduced
the
quitrent
the
peasants
had
to
pay
,
had
not
*NL*
softened
their
disposition
but
had
on
the
contrary
strengthened
in
them
*NL*
the
traits
of
character
the
old
prince
called
boorishness
.
Various
*NL*
obscure
rumors
were
always
current
among
them
:
at
one
time
a
rumor
that
*NL*
they
would
all
be
enrolled
as
Cossacks
;
at
another
of
a
new
religion
to
*NL*
which
they
were
all
to
be
converted
;
then
of
some
proclamation
of
the
*NL*
Tsar
's
and
of
an
oath
to
the
Tsar
Paul
in
1797
-LRB-
in
connection
with
which
*NL*
it
was
rumored
that
freedom
had
been
granted
them
but
the
landowners
had
*NL*
stopped
it
-RRB-
,
then
of
Peter
Fedorovich
's
return
to
the
throne
in
seven
*NL*
years
'
time
,
when
everything
would
be
made
free
and
so
``
simple
''
that
*NL*
there
would
be
no
restrictions
.
Rumors
of
the
war
with
Bonaparte
and
his
*NL*
invasion
were
connected
in
their
minds
with
the
same
sort
of
vague
*NL*
notions
of
Antichrist
,
the
end
of
the
world
,
and
``
pure
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
vicinity
of
Bogucharovo
were
large
villages
belonging
to
the
*NL*
crown
or
to
owners
whose
serfs
paid
quitrent
and
could
work
where
they
*NL*
pleased
.
There
were
very
few
resident
landlords
in
the
neighborhood
and
*NL*
also
very
few
domestic
or
literate
serfs
,
and
in
the
lives
of
the
*NL*
peasantry
of
those
parts
the
mysterious
undercurrents
in
the
life
of
the
*NL*
Russian
people
,
the
causes
and
meaning
of
which
are
so
baffling
to
*NL*
contemporaries
,
were
more
clearly
and
strongly
noticeable
than
among
*NL*
others
.
One
instance
,
which
had
occurred
some
twenty
years
before
,
was
a
*NL*
movement
among
the
peasants
to
emigrate
to
some
unknown
``
warm
rivers
.
''
*NL*
Hundreds
of
peasants
,
among
them
the
Bogucharovo
folk
,
suddenly
began
*NL*
selling
their
cattle
and
moving
in
whole
families
toward
the
southeast
.
*NL*
As
birds
migrate
to
somewhere
beyond
the
sea
,
so
these
men
with
their
*NL*
wives
and
children
streamed
to
the
southeast
,
to
parts
where
none
of
*NL*
them
had
ever
been
.
They
set
off
in
caravans
,
bought
their
freedom
one
*NL*
by
one
or
ran
away
,
and
drove
or
walked
toward
the
``
warm
rivers
.
''
Many
*NL*
of
them
were
punished
,
some
sent
to
Siberia
,
many
died
of
cold
and
*NL*
hunger
on
the
road
,
many
returned
of
their
own
accord
,
and
the
movement
*NL*
died
down
of
itself
just
as
it
had
sprung
up
,
without
apparent
reason
.
*NL*
But
such
undercurrents
still
existed
among
the
people
and
gathered
new
*NL*
forces
ready
to
manifest
themselves
just
as
strangely
,
unexpectedly
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
simply
,
naturally
,
and
forcibly
.
Now
in
1812
,
to
anyone
*NL*
living
in
close
touch
with
these
people
it
was
apparent
that
these
*NL*
undercurrents
were
acting
strongly
and
nearing
an
eruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
,
who
had
reached
Bogucharovo
shortly
before
the
old
prince
's
*NL*
death
,
noticed
an
agitation
among
the
peasants
,
and
that
contrary
to
*NL*
what
was
happening
in
the
Bald
Hills
district
,
where
over
a
radius
of
*NL*
forty
miles
all
the
peasants
were
moving
away
and
leaving
their
villages
*NL*
to
be
devastated
by
the
Cossacks
,
the
peasants
in
the
steppe
region
*NL*
round
Bogucharovo
were
,
it
was
rumored
,
in
touch
with
the
French
,
*NL*
received
leaflets
from
them
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
,
and
did
not
*NL*
migrate
.
He
learned
from
domestic
serfs
loyal
to
him
that
the
peasant
*NL*
Karp
,
who
possessed
great
influence
in
the
village
commune
and
had
*NL*
recently
been
away
driving
a
government
transport
,
had
returned
with
*NL*
news
that
the
Cossacks
were
destroying
deserted
villages
,
but
that
the
*NL*
French
did
not
harm
them
.
Alpatych
also
knew
that
on
the
previous
day
*NL*
another
peasant
had
even
brought
from
the
village
of
Visloukhovo
,
which
*NL*
was
occupied
by
the
French
,
a
proclamation
by
a
French
general
that
no
*NL*
harm
would
be
done
to
the
inhabitants
,
and
if
they
remained
they
would
*NL*
be
paid
for
anything
taken
from
them
.
As
proof
of
this
the
peasant
had
*NL*
brought
from
Visloukhovo
a
hundred
rubles
in
notes
-LRB-
he
did
not
know
that
*NL*
they
were
false
-RRB-
paid
to
him
in
advance
for
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
important
still
,
Alpatych
learned
that
on
the
morning
of
the
very
*NL*
day
he
gave
the
village
Elder
orders
to
collect
carts
to
move
the
*NL*
princess
'
luggage
from
Bogucharovo
,
there
had
been
a
village
meeting
at
*NL*
which
it
had
been
decided
not
to
move
but
to
wait
.
Yet
there
was
no
time
*NL*
to
waste
.
On
the
fifteenth
,
the
day
of
the
old
prince
's
death
,
the
*NL*
Marshal
had
insisted
on
Princess
Mary
's
leaving
at
once
,
as
it
was
*NL*
becoming
dangerous
.
He
had
told
her
that
after
the
sixteenth
he
could
*NL*
not
be
responsible
for
what
might
happen
.
On
the
evening
of
the
day
the
*NL*
old
prince
died
the
Marshal
went
away
,
promising
to
return
next
day
for
*NL*
the
funeral
.
But
this
he
was
unable
to
do
,
for
he
received
tidings
that
*NL*
the
French
had
unexpectedly
advanced
,
and
had
barely
time
to
remove
his
*NL*
own
family
and
valuables
from
his
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
thirty
years
Bogucharovo
had
been
managed
by
the
village
Elder
,
*NL*
Dron
,
whom
the
old
prince
called
by
the
diminutive
``
Dronushka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
was
one
of
those
physically
and
mentally
vigorous
peasants
who
grow
*NL*
big
beards
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
and
go
on
unchanged
till
they
are
*NL*
sixty
or
seventy
,
without
a
gray
hair
or
the
loss
of
a
tooth
,
as
*NL*
straight
and
strong
at
sixty
as
at
thirty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
migration
to
the
``
warm
rivers
,
''
in
which
he
had
taken
*NL*
part
like
the
rest
,
Dron
was
made
village
Elder
and
overseer
of
*NL*
Bogucharovo
,
and
had
since
filled
that
post
irreproachably
for
twenty
-
*NL*
three
years
.
The
peasants
feared
him
more
than
they
did
their
master
.
*NL*
The
masters
,
both
the
old
prince
and
the
young
,
and
the
steward
*NL*
respected
him
and
jestingly
called
him
``
the
Minister
.
''
During
the
whole
*NL*
time
of
his
service
Dron
had
never
been
drunk
or
ill
,
never
after
*NL*
sleepless
nights
or
the
hardest
tasks
had
he
shown
the
least
fatigue
,
*NL*
and
though
he
could
not
read
he
had
never
forgotten
a
single
money
*NL*
account
or
the
number
of
quarters
of
flour
in
any
of
the
endless
*NL*
cartloads
he
sold
for
the
prince
,
nor
a
single
shock
of
the
whole
corn
*NL*
crop
on
any
single
acre
of
the
Bogucharovo
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
,
arriving
from
the
devastated
Bald
Hills
estate
,
sent
for
his
*NL*
Dron
on
the
day
of
the
prince
's
funeral
and
told
him
to
have
twelve
*NL*
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess
'
carriages
and
eighteen
carts
for
the
*NL*
things
to
be
removed
from
Bogucharovo
.
Though
the
peasants
paid
*NL*
quitrent
,
Alpatych
thought
no
difficulty
would
be
made
about
complying
*NL*
with
this
order
,
for
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
at
*NL*
work
in
Bogucharovo
and
the
peasants
were
well
to
do
.
But
on
hearing
the
*NL*
order
Dron
lowered
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
.
Alpatych
named
certain
*NL*
peasants
he
knew
,
from
whom
he
told
him
to
take
the
carts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
replied
that
the
horses
of
these
peasants
were
away
carting
.
*NL*
Alpatych
named
others
,
but
they
too
,
according
to
Dron
,
had
no
horses
*NL*
available
:
some
horses
were
carting
for
the
government
,
others
were
too
*NL*
weak
,
and
others
had
died
for
want
of
fodder
.
It
seemed
that
no
horses
*NL*
could
be
had
even
for
the
carriages
,
much
less
for
the
carting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
looked
intently
at
Dron
and
frowned
.
Just
as
Dron
was
a
model
*NL*
village
Elder
,
so
Alpatych
had
not
managed
the
prince
's
estates
for
*NL*
twenty
years
in
vain
.
He
was
a
model
steward
,
possessing
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
the
faculty
of
divining
the
needs
and
instincts
of
those
he
dealt
*NL*
with
.
Having
glanced
at
Dron
he
at
once
understood
that
his
answers
did
*NL*
not
express
his
personal
views
but
the
general
mood
of
the
Bogucharovo
*NL*
commune
,
by
which
the
Elder
had
already
been
carried
away
.
But
he
also
*NL*
knew
that
Dron
,
who
had
acquired
property
and
was
hated
by
the
commune
,
*NL*
must
be
hesitating
between
the
two
camps
:
the
masters
'
and
the
serfs
'
.
*NL*
He
noticed
this
hesitation
in
Dron
's
look
and
therefore
frowned
and
*NL*
moved
closer
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
just
listen
,
Dronushka
,
''
said
he
.
``
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
to
me
.
His
*NL*
excellency
Prince
Andrew
himself
gave
me
orders
to
move
all
the
people
*NL*
away
and
not
leave
them
with
the
enemy
,
and
there
is
an
order
from
the
*NL*
Tsar
about
it
too
.
Anyone
who
stays
is
a
traitor
to
the
Tsar
.
Do
you
*NL*
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
,
''
Dron
answered
without
lifting
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Dron
,
it
will
turn
out
badly
!
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
power
is
in
your
hands
,
''
Dron
rejoined
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Dron
,
drop
it
!
''
Alpatych
repeated
,
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
*NL*
bosom
and
solemnly
pointing
to
the
floor
at
Dron
's
feet
.
``
I
can
see
*NL*
through
you
and
three
yards
into
the
ground
under
you
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
gazing
at
the
floor
in
front
of
Dron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
was
disconcerted
,
glanced
furtively
at
Alpatych
and
again
lowered
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
to
get
ready
to
leave
their
*NL*
homes
and
go
to
Moscow
and
to
get
carts
ready
for
tomorrow
morning
for
*NL*
the
princess
'
things
.
And
do
n't
go
to
any
meeting
yourself
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
suddenly
fell
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yakov
Alpatych
,
discharge
me
!
Take
the
keys
from
me
and
discharge
me
,
*NL*
for
Christ
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
that
!
''
cried
Alpatych
sternly
.
``
I
see
through
you
and
three
yards
*NL*
under
you
,
''
he
repeated
,
knowing
that
his
skill
in
beekeeping
,
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
right
time
to
sow
the
oats
,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
been
able
to
retain
the
old
prince
's
favor
for
twenty
years
had
long
*NL*
since
gained
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
wizard
,
and
that
the
power
of
*NL*
seeing
three
yards
under
a
man
is
considered
an
attribute
of
wizards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
got
up
and
was
about
to
say
something
,
but
Alpatych
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
have
got
into
your
heads
,
eh
?
...
What
are
you
thinking
*NL*
of
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
with
the
people
?
''
said
Dron
.
``
They
're
quite
beside
*NL*
themselves
;
I
have
already
told
them
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Told
them
,
'
I
dare
say
!
''
said
Alpatych
.
``
Are
they
drinking
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
beside
themselves
,
Yakov
Alpatych
;
they
've
fetched
another
*NL*
barrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
listen
!
I
'll
go
to
the
police
officer
,
and
you
tell
them
*NL*
so
,
and
that
they
must
stop
this
and
the
carts
must
be
got
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
did
not
insist
further
.
He
had
managed
people
for
a
long
time
*NL*
and
knew
that
the
chief
way
to
make
them
obey
is
to
show
no
suspicion
*NL*
that
they
can
possibly
disobey
.
Having
wrung
a
submissive
``
I
understand
''
*NL*
from
Dron
,
Alpatych
contented
himself
with
that
,
though
he
not
only
*NL*
doubted
but
felt
almost
certain
that
without
the
help
of
troops
the
*NL*
carts
would
not
be
forthcoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
,
for
when
evening
came
no
carts
had
been
provided
.
In
the
*NL*
village
,
outside
the
drink
shop
,
another
meeting
was
being
held
,
which
*NL*
decided
that
the
horses
should
be
driven
out
into
the
woods
and
the
*NL*
carts
should
not
be
provided
.
Without
saying
anything
of
this
to
the
*NL*
princess
,
Alpatych
had
his
own
belongings
taken
out
of
the
carts
which
*NL*
had
arrived
from
Bald
Hills
and
had
those
horses
got
ready
for
the
*NL*
princess
'
carriages
.
Meanwhile
he
went
himself
to
the
police
*NL*
authorities
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
father
's
funeral
Princess
Mary
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
*NL*
did
not
admit
anyone
.
A
maid
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
Alpatych
was
*NL*
asking
for
orders
about
their
departure
.
-LRB-
This
was
before
his
talk
with
*NL*
Dron
.
-RRB-
Princess
Mary
raised
herself
on
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
*NL*
lying
and
replied
through
the
closed
door
that
she
did
not
mean
to
go
*NL*
away
and
begged
to
be
left
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
windows
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
lying
looked
westward
.
She
lay
*NL*
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
to
the
wall
,
fingering
the
buttons
of
the
*NL*
leather
cushion
and
seeing
nothing
but
that
cushion
,
and
her
confused
*NL*
thoughts
were
centered
on
one
subject
--
the
irrevocability
of
death
and
*NL*
her
own
spiritual
baseness
,
which
she
had
not
suspected
,
but
which
had
*NL*
shown
itself
during
her
father
's
illness
.
She
wished
to
pray
but
did
not
*NL*
dare
to
,
dared
not
in
her
present
state
of
mind
address
herself
to
God
.
*NL*
She
lay
for
a
long
time
in
that
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
house
,
and
its
slanting
rays
*NL*
shone
into
the
open
window
,
lighting
up
the
room
and
part
of
the
morocco
*NL*
cushion
at
which
Princess
Mary
was
looking
.
The
flow
of
her
thoughts
*NL*
suddenly
stopped
.
Unconsciously
she
sat
up
,
smoothed
her
hair
,
got
up
,
*NL*
and
went
to
the
window
,
involuntarily
inhaling
the
freshness
of
the
*NL*
clear
but
windy
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
can
well
enjoy
the
evening
now
!
He
is
gone
and
no
one
will
*NL*
hinder
you
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
and
sinking
into
a
chair
she
let
her
*NL*
head
fall
on
the
window
sill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Someone
spoke
her
name
in
a
soft
and
tender
voice
from
the
garden
and
*NL*
kissed
her
head
.
She
looked
up
.
It
was
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
in
a
black
*NL*
dress
and
weepers
.
She
softly
approached
Princess
Mary
,
sighed
,
kissed
*NL*
her
,
and
immediately
began
to
cry
.
The
princess
looked
up
at
her
.
All
*NL*
their
former
disharmony
and
her
own
jealousy
recurred
to
her
mind
.
But
*NL*
she
remembered
too
how
he
had
changed
of
late
toward
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
and
could
not
bear
to
see
her
,
thereby
showing
how
unjust
were
*NL*
the
reproaches
Princess
Mary
had
mentally
addressed
to
her
.
``
Besides
,
is
*NL*
it
for
me
,
for
me
who
desired
his
death
,
to
condemn
anyone
?
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
vividly
pictured
to
herself
the
position
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
,
whom
she
had
of
late
kept
at
a
distance
,
but
who
yet
was
*NL*
dependent
on
her
and
living
in
her
house
.
She
felt
sorry
for
her
and
*NL*
held
out
her
hand
with
a
glance
of
gentle
inquiry
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
at
once
began
crying
again
and
kissed
that
hand
,
speaking
of
*NL*
the
princess
'
sorrow
and
making
herself
a
partner
in
it
.
She
said
her
*NL*
only
consolation
was
the
fact
that
the
princess
allowed
her
to
share
her
*NL*
sorrow
,
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
sink
into
nothing
but
*NL*
this
great
grief
;
that
she
felt
herself
blameless
in
regard
to
everyone
,
*NL*
and
that
he
,
from
above
,
saw
her
affection
and
gratitude
.
The
princess
*NL*
heard
her
,
not
heeding
her
words
but
occasionally
looking
up
at
her
and
*NL*
listening
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
position
is
doubly
terrible
,
dear
princess
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
after
a
pause
.
``
I
understand
that
you
could
not
,
and
can
not
,
*NL*
think
of
yourself
,
but
with
my
love
for
you
I
must
do
so
...
Has
*NL*
Alpatych
been
to
you
?
Has
he
spoken
to
you
of
going
away
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
did
not
answer
.
She
did
not
understand
who
was
to
go
or
*NL*
where
to
.
``
Is
it
possible
to
plan
or
think
of
anything
now
?
Is
it
not
*NL*
all
the
same
?
''
she
thought
,
and
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
chere
Marie
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
``
that
we
are
in
*NL*
danger
--
are
surrounded
by
the
French
.
It
would
be
dangerous
to
move
now
.
*NL*
If
we
go
we
are
almost
sure
to
be
taken
prisoners
,
and
God
knows
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
at
her
companion
without
understanding
what
she
was
*NL*
talking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
anyone
knew
how
little
anything
matters
to
me
now
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
would
on
no
account
wish
to
go
away
from
him
...
Alpatych
*NL*
did
say
something
about
going
...
Speak
to
him
;
I
can
do
nothing
,
*NL*
nothing
,
and
do
n't
want
to
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
spoken
to
him
.
He
hopes
we
should
be
in
time
to
get
away
tomorrow
,
*NL*
but
I
think
it
would
now
be
better
to
stay
here
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Bourienne
.
``
Because
,
you
will
agree
,
chere
Marie
,
to
fall
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
soldiers
or
of
riotous
peasants
would
be
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
a
proclamation
-LRB-
not
*NL*
printed
on
ordinary
Russian
paper
-RRB-
of
General
Rameau
's
,
telling
people
*NL*
not
to
leave
their
homes
and
that
the
French
authorities
would
afford
*NL*
them
proper
protection
.
She
handed
this
to
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
would
be
best
to
appeal
to
that
general
,
''
she
continued
,
*NL*
``
and
I
am
sure
that
all
due
respect
would
be
shown
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
read
the
paper
,
and
her
face
began
to
quiver
with
stifled
*NL*
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
whom
did
you
get
this
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
probably
recognized
that
I
am
French
,
by
my
name
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
with
the
paper
in
her
hand
,
rose
from
the
window
and
with
*NL*
a
pale
face
went
out
of
the
room
and
into
what
had
been
Prince
Andrew
's
*NL*
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dunyasha
,
send
Alpatych
,
or
Dronushka
,
or
somebody
to
me
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
and
tell
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
not
to
come
to
me
,
''
she
added
,
hearing
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
voice
.
``
We
must
go
at
once
,
at
once
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
appalled
at
the
thought
of
being
left
in
the
hands
of
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Prince
Andrew
heard
that
I
was
in
the
power
of
the
French
!
That
I
,
*NL*
the
daughter
of
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
,
asked
General
Rameau
for
*NL*
protection
and
accepted
his
favor
!
''
This
idea
horrified
her
,
made
her
*NL*
shudder
,
blush
,
and
feel
such
a
rush
of
anger
and
pride
as
she
had
never
*NL*
experienced
before
.
All
that
was
distressing
,
and
especially
all
that
*NL*
was
humiliating
,
in
her
position
rose
vividly
to
her
mind
.
``
They
,
the
*NL*
French
,
would
settle
in
this
house
:
M.
le
General
Rameau
would
occupy
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
study
and
amuse
himself
by
looking
through
and
reading
*NL*
his
letters
and
papers
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
would
do
the
honors
of
*NL*
Bogucharovo
for
him
.
I
should
be
given
a
small
room
as
a
favor
,
the
*NL*
soldiers
would
violate
my
father
's
newly
dug
grave
to
steal
his
crosses
*NL*
and
stars
,
they
would
tell
me
of
their
victories
over
the
Russians
,
and
*NL*
would
pretend
to
sympathize
with
my
sorrow
...
''
thought
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
not
thinking
her
own
thoughts
but
feeling
bound
to
think
like
her
father
*NL*
and
her
brother
.
For
herself
she
did
not
care
where
she
remained
or
what
*NL*
happened
to
her
,
but
she
felt
herself
the
representative
of
her
dead
*NL*
father
and
of
Prince
Andrew
.
Involuntarily
she
thought
their
thoughts
*NL*
and
felt
their
feelings
.
What
they
would
have
said
and
what
they
would
*NL*
have
done
she
felt
bound
to
say
and
do
.
She
went
into
Prince
Andrew
's
*NL*
study
,
trying
to
enter
completely
into
his
ideas
,
and
considered
her
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
demands
of
life
,
which
had
seemed
to
her
annihilated
by
her
father
's
*NL*
death
,
all
at
once
rose
before
her
with
a
new
,
previously
unknown
force
*NL*
and
took
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agitated
and
flushed
she
paced
the
room
,
sending
now
for
Michael
*NL*
Ivanovich
and
now
for
Tikhon
or
Dron
.
Dunyasha
,
the
nurse
,
and
the
other
*NL*
maids
could
not
say
in
how
far
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
statement
was
*NL*
correct
.
Alpatych
was
not
at
home
,
he
had
gone
to
the
police
.
Neither
*NL*
could
the
architect
Michael
Ivanovich
,
who
on
being
sent
for
came
in
*NL*
with
sleepy
eyes
,
tell
Princess
Mary
anything
.
With
just
the
same
smile
*NL*
of
agreement
with
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
*NL*
answer
the
old
prince
without
expressing
views
of
his
own
,
he
now
*NL*
replied
to
Princess
Mary
,
so
that
nothing
definite
could
be
got
from
his
*NL*
answers
.
The
old
valet
Tikhon
,
with
sunken
,
emaciated
face
that
bore
the
*NL*
stamp
of
inconsolable
grief
,
replied
:
``
Yes
,
Princess
''
to
all
Princess
*NL*
Mary
's
questions
and
hardly
refrained
from
sobbing
as
he
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Dron
,
the
village
Elder
,
entered
the
room
and
with
a
deep
bow
*NL*
to
Princess
Mary
came
to
a
halt
by
the
doorpost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dronushka
,
''
she
said
,
regarding
as
a
sure
friend
this
Dronushka
who
*NL*
always
used
to
bring
a
special
kind
of
gingerbread
from
his
visit
to
the
*NL*
fair
at
Vyazma
every
year
and
smilingly
offer
it
to
her
,
``
Dronushka
,
now
*NL*
since
our
misfortune
...
''
she
began
,
but
could
not
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
in
God
's
hands
,
''
said
he
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dronushka
,
Alpatych
has
gone
off
somewhere
and
I
have
no
one
to
turn
*NL*
to
.
Is
it
true
,
as
they
tell
me
,
that
I
ca
n't
even
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
you
go
away
,
your
excellency
?
You
can
go
,
''
said
Dron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
told
it
would
be
dangerous
because
of
the
enemy
.
Dear
friend
,
I
*NL*
can
do
nothing
.
I
understand
nothing
.
I
have
nobody
!
I
want
to
go
away
*NL*
tonight
or
early
tomorrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
paused
.
He
looked
askance
at
Princess
Mary
and
said
:
``
There
are
no
*NL*
horses
;
I
told
Yakov
Alpatych
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
there
none
?
''
asked
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
God
's
scourge
,
''
said
Dron
.
``
What
horses
we
had
have
been
taken
*NL*
for
the
army
or
have
died
--
this
is
such
a
year
!
It
's
not
a
case
of
*NL*
feeding
horses
--
we
may
die
of
hunger
ourselves
!
As
it
is
,
some
go
three
*NL*
days
without
eating
.
We
've
nothing
,
we
've
been
ruined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
listened
attentively
to
what
he
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
peasants
are
ruined
?
They
have
no
bread
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
dying
of
hunger
,
''
said
Dron
.
``
It
's
not
a
case
of
carting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
,
Dronushka
?
Is
n't
it
possible
to
help
them
?
*NL*
I
'll
do
all
I
can
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Princess
Mary
it
was
strange
that
now
,
at
a
moment
when
such
sorrow
*NL*
was
filling
her
soul
,
there
could
be
rich
people
and
poor
,
and
the
rich
*NL*
could
refrain
from
helping
the
poor
.
She
had
heard
vaguely
that
there
*NL*
was
such
a
thing
as
``
landlord
's
corn
''
which
was
sometimes
given
to
the
*NL*
peasants
.
She
also
knew
that
neither
her
father
nor
her
brother
would
*NL*
refuse
to
help
the
peasants
in
need
,
she
only
feared
to
make
some
*NL*
mistake
in
speaking
about
the
distribution
of
the
grain
she
wished
to
*NL*
give
.
She
was
glad
such
cares
presented
themselves
,
enabling
her
without
*NL*
scruple
to
forget
her
own
grief
.
She
began
asking
Dron
about
the
*NL*
peasants
'
needs
and
what
there
was
in
Bogucharovo
that
belonged
to
the
*NL*
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
grain
belonging
to
my
brother
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
landlord
's
grain
is
all
safe
,
''
replied
Dron
proudly
.
``
Our
prince
*NL*
did
not
order
it
to
be
sold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
the
peasants
,
let
them
have
all
they
need
;
I
give
you
leave
*NL*
in
my
brother
's
name
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
made
no
answer
but
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
them
that
corn
if
there
is
enough
of
it
.
Distribute
it
all
.
I
give
*NL*
this
order
in
my
brother
's
name
;
and
tell
them
that
what
is
ours
is
*NL*
theirs
.
We
do
not
grudge
them
anything
.
Tell
them
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
looked
intently
at
the
princess
while
she
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Discharge
me
,
little
mother
,
for
God
's
sake
!
Order
the
keys
to
be
taken
*NL*
from
me
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
served
twenty-three
years
and
have
done
no
*NL*
wrong
.
Discharge
me
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
did
not
understand
what
he
wanted
of
her
or
why
he
was
*NL*
asking
to
be
discharged
.
She
replied
that
she
had
never
doubted
his
*NL*
devotion
and
that
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
and
for
the
*NL*
peasants
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
Dunyasha
came
to
tell
the
princess
that
Dron
had
come
,
and
*NL*
all
the
peasants
had
assembled
at
the
barn
by
the
princess
'
order
and
*NL*
wished
to
have
word
with
their
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
never
told
them
to
come
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
I
only
told
Dron
*NL*
to
let
them
have
the
grain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
,
for
God
's
sake
,
Princess
dear
,
have
them
sent
away
and
do
n't
go
*NL*
out
to
them
.
It
's
all
a
trick
,
''
said
Dunyasha
,
``
and
when
Yakov
Alpatych
*NL*
returns
let
us
get
away
...
and
please
do
n't
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
trick
?
''
asked
Princess
Mary
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
is
,
only
listen
to
me
for
God
's
sake
!
Ask
nurse
too
.
They
say
*NL*
they
do
n't
agree
to
leave
Bogucharovo
as
you
ordered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
making
some
mistake
.
I
never
ordered
them
to
go
away
,
''
said
*NL*
Princess
Mary
.
``
Call
Dronushka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
came
and
confirmed
Dunyasha
's
words
;
the
peasants
had
come
by
the
*NL*
princess
'
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
never
sent
for
them
,
''
declared
the
princess
.
``
You
must
have
given
*NL*
my
message
wrong
.
I
only
said
that
you
were
to
give
them
the
grain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dron
only
sighed
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
order
it
they
will
go
away
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
I
'll
go
out
to
them
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
and
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
nurse
's
and
Dunyasha
's
protests
she
went
out
into
the
porch
;
Dron
,
*NL*
Dunyasha
,
the
nurse
,
and
Michael
Ivanovich
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
probably
think
I
am
offering
them
the
grain
to
bribe
them
to
*NL*
remain
here
,
while
I
myself
go
away
leaving
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
*NL*
French
,
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
``
I
will
offer
them
monthly
rations
and
*NL*
housing
at
our
Moscow
estate
.
I
am
sure
Andrew
would
do
even
more
in
my
*NL*
place
,
''
she
thought
as
she
went
out
in
the
twilight
toward
the
crowd
*NL*
standing
on
the
pasture
by
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
crowded
closer
together
,
stirred
,
and
rapidly
took
off
their
*NL*
hats
.
Princess
Mary
lowered
her
eyes
and
,
tripping
over
her
skirt
,
came
*NL*
close
up
to
them
.
So
many
different
eyes
,
old
and
young
,
were
fixed
on
*NL*
her
,
and
there
were
so
many
different
faces
,
that
she
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
any
of
them
and
,
feeling
that
she
must
speak
to
them
all
at
*NL*
once
,
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
.
But
again
the
sense
that
she
*NL*
represented
her
father
and
her
brother
gave
her
courage
,
and
she
boldly
*NL*
began
her
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
you
have
come
,
''
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes
,
and
*NL*
feeling
her
heart
beating
quickly
and
violently
.
``
Dronushka
tells
me
*NL*
that
the
war
has
ruined
you
.
That
is
our
common
misfortune
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
grudge
nothing
to
help
you
.
I
am
myself
going
away
because
it
is
*NL*
dangerous
here
...
the
enemy
is
near
...
because
...
I
am
giving
you
*NL*
everything
,
my
friends
,
and
I
beg
you
to
take
everything
,
all
our
grain
,
*NL*
so
that
you
may
not
suffer
want
!
And
if
you
have
been
told
that
I
am
*NL*
giving
you
the
grain
to
keep
you
here
--
that
is
not
true
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
ask
you
to
go
with
all
your
belongings
to
our
estate
near
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
I
promise
you
I
will
see
to
it
that
there
you
shall
want
for
*NL*
nothing
.
You
shall
be
given
food
and
lodging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
stopped
.
Sighs
were
the
only
sound
heard
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
doing
this
on
my
own
account
,
''
she
continued
,
``
I
do
it
in
the
*NL*
name
of
my
dead
father
,
who
was
a
good
master
to
you
,
and
of
my
brother
*NL*
and
his
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
paused
.
No
one
broke
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ours
is
a
common
misfortune
and
we
will
share
it
together
.
All
that
is
*NL*
mine
is
yours
,
''
she
concluded
,
scanning
the
faces
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
gazing
at
her
with
one
and
the
same
expression
.
She
could
*NL*
not
fathom
whether
it
was
curiosity
,
devotion
,
gratitude
,
or
*NL*
apprehension
and
distrust
--
but
the
expression
on
all
the
faces
was
*NL*
identical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
all
very
thankful
for
your
bounty
,
but
it
wo
n't
do
for
us
to
*NL*
take
the
landlord
's
grain
,
''
said
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
not
?
''
asked
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
and
Princess
Mary
,
looking
round
at
the
crowd
,
found
that
*NL*
every
eye
she
met
now
was
immediately
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
do
n't
you
want
to
take
it
?
''
she
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
began
to
oppress
the
princess
and
she
tried
to
catch
*NL*
someone
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
speak
?
''
she
inquired
of
a
very
old
man
who
stood
just
in
*NL*
front
of
her
leaning
on
his
stick
.
``
If
you
think
something
more
is
*NL*
wanted
,
tell
me
!
I
will
do
anything
,
''
said
she
,
catching
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
if
this
angered
him
,
he
bent
his
head
quite
low
and
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
agree
?
We
do
n't
want
the
grain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
give
up
everything
?
We
do
n't
agree
.
Do
n't
agree
...
We
*NL*
are
sorry
for
you
,
but
we
're
not
willing
.
Go
away
yourself
,
alone
...
''
*NL*
came
from
various
sides
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
all
the
faces
in
that
crowd
bore
an
identical
expression
,
*NL*
though
now
it
was
certainly
not
an
expression
of
curiosity
or
gratitude
,
*NL*
but
of
angry
resolve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
have
understood
me
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
with
a
sad
smile
.
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
want
to
go
?
I
promise
to
house
and
feed
you
,
while
here
*NL*
the
enemy
would
ruin
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
voices
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
willing
.
Let
them
ruin
us
!
We
wo
n't
take
your
grain
.
We
do
n't
*NL*
agree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Princess
Mary
tried
to
catch
someone
's
eye
,
but
not
a
single
eye
*NL*
in
the
crowd
was
turned
to
her
;
evidently
they
were
all
trying
to
avoid
*NL*
her
look
.
She
felt
strange
and
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
an
artful
tale
!
Follow
her
into
slavery
!
Pull
down
your
houses
*NL*
and
go
into
bondage
!
I
dare
say
!
`
I
'll
give
you
grain
,
indeed
!
'
she
*NL*
says
,
''
voices
in
the
crowd
were
heard
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
drooping
head
Princess
Mary
left
the
crowd
and
went
back
to
the
*NL*
house
.
Having
repeated
her
order
to
Dron
to
have
horses
ready
for
her
*NL*
departure
next
morning
,
she
went
to
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
*NL*
own
thoughts
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
that
night
Princess
Mary
sat
by
the
open
window
of
her
*NL*
room
hearing
the
sound
of
the
peasants
'
voices
that
reached
her
from
the
*NL*
village
,
but
it
was
not
of
them
she
was
thinking
.
She
felt
that
she
*NL*
could
not
understand
them
however
much
she
might
think
about
them
.
She
*NL*
thought
only
of
one
thing
,
her
sorrow
,
which
,
after
the
break
caused
by
*NL*
cares
for
the
present
,
seemed
already
to
belong
to
the
past
.
Now
she
*NL*
could
remember
it
and
weep
or
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
sunset
the
wind
had
dropped
.
The
night
was
calm
and
fresh
.
Toward
*NL*
midnight
the
voices
began
to
subside
,
a
cock
crowed
,
the
full
moon
began
*NL*
to
show
from
behind
the
lime
trees
,
a
fresh
white
dewy
mist
began
to
*NL*
rise
,
and
stillness
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pictures
of
the
near
past
--
her
father
's
illness
and
last
moments
--
rose
*NL*
one
after
another
to
her
memory
.
With
mournful
pleasure
she
now
lingered
*NL*
over
these
images
,
repelling
with
horror
only
the
last
one
,
the
picture
*NL*
of
his
death
,
which
she
felt
she
could
not
contemplate
even
in
*NL*
imagination
at
this
still
and
mystic
hour
of
night
.
And
these
pictures
*NL*
presented
themselves
to
her
so
clearly
and
in
such
detail
that
they
*NL*
seemed
now
present
,
now
past
,
and
now
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
vividly
recalled
the
moment
when
he
had
his
first
stroke
and
was
*NL*
being
dragged
along
by
his
armpits
through
the
garden
at
Bald
Hills
,
*NL*
muttering
something
with
his
helpless
tongue
,
twitching
his
gray
*NL*
eyebrows
and
looking
uneasily
and
timidly
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
then
he
wanted
to
tell
me
what
he
told
me
the
day
he
died
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
``
He
had
always
thought
what
he
said
then
.
''
And
she
recalled
in
*NL*
all
its
detail
the
night
at
Bald
Hills
before
he
had
the
last
stroke
,
*NL*
when
with
a
foreboding
of
disaster
she
had
remained
at
home
against
his
*NL*
will
.
She
had
not
slept
and
had
stolen
downstairs
on
tiptoe
,
and
going
*NL*
to
the
door
of
the
conservatory
where
he
slept
that
night
had
listened
*NL*
at
the
door
.
In
a
suffering
and
weary
voice
he
was
saying
something
to
*NL*
Tikhon
,
speaking
of
the
Crimea
and
its
warm
nights
and
of
the
Empress
.
*NL*
Evidently
he
had
wanted
to
talk
.
``
And
why
did
n't
he
call
me
?
Why
did
n't
*NL*
he
let
me
be
there
instead
of
Tikhon
?
''
Princess
Mary
had
thought
and
*NL*
thought
again
now
.
``
Now
he
will
never
tell
anyone
what
he
had
in
his
*NL*
soul
.
Never
will
that
moment
return
for
him
or
for
me
when
he
might
have
*NL*
said
all
he
longed
to
say
,
and
not
Tikhon
but
I
might
have
heard
and
*NL*
understood
him
.
Why
did
n't
I
enter
the
room
?
''
she
thought
.
``
Perhaps
he
*NL*
would
then
have
said
to
me
what
he
said
the
day
he
died
.
While
talking
*NL*
to
Tikhon
he
asked
about
me
twice
.
He
wanted
to
see
me
,
and
I
was
*NL*
standing
close
by
,
outside
the
door
.
It
was
sad
and
painful
for
him
to
*NL*
talk
to
Tikhon
who
did
not
understand
him
.
I
remember
how
he
began
*NL*
speaking
to
him
about
Lise
as
if
she
were
alive
--
he
had
forgotten
she
*NL*
was
dead
--
and
Tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
no
more
,
and
he
shouted
,
*NL*
`
Fool
!
'
He
was
greatly
depressed
.
From
behind
the
door
I
heard
how
he
*NL*
lay
down
on
his
bed
groaning
and
loudly
exclaimed
,
`
My
God
!
'
Why
did
n't
*NL*
I
go
in
then
?
What
could
he
have
done
to
me
?
What
could
I
have
lost
?
And
*NL*
perhaps
he
would
then
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
said
that
word
*NL*
to
me
.
''
And
Princess
Mary
uttered
aloud
the
caressing
word
he
had
said
*NL*
to
her
on
the
day
of
his
death
.
``
Dear-est
!
''
she
repeated
,
and
began
*NL*
sobbing
,
with
tears
that
relieved
her
soul
.
She
now
saw
his
face
before
*NL*
her
.
And
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
*NL*
had
always
seen
at
a
distance
,
but
the
timid
,
feeble
face
she
had
seen
*NL*
for
the
first
time
quite
closely
,
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
details
,
*NL*
when
she
stooped
near
to
his
mouth
to
catch
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear-est
!
''
she
repeated
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
he
thinking
when
he
uttered
that
word
?
What
is
he
thinking
*NL*
now
?
''
This
question
suddenly
presented
itself
to
her
,
and
in
answer
she
*NL*
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expression
that
was
on
his
face
as
he
lay
in
*NL*
his
coffin
with
his
chin
bound
up
with
a
white
handkerchief
.
And
the
*NL*
horror
that
had
seized
her
when
she
touched
him
and
convinced
herself
*NL*
that
that
was
not
he
,
but
something
mysterious
and
horrible
,
seized
her
*NL*
again
.
She
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
to
pray
,
but
could
do
*NL*
neither
.
With
wide-open
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows
,
*NL*
expecting
every
moment
to
see
his
dead
face
,
and
she
felt
that
the
*NL*
silence
brooding
over
the
house
and
within
it
held
her
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dunyasha
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
Dunyasha
!
''
she
screamed
wildly
,
and
tearing
*NL*
herself
out
of
this
silence
she
ran
to
the
servants
'
quarters
to
meet
*NL*
her
old
nurse
and
the
maidservants
who
came
running
toward
her
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
seventeenth
of
August
Rostov
and
Ilyin
,
accompanied
by
Lavrushka
*NL*
who
had
just
returned
from
captivity
and
by
an
hussar
orderly
,
left
*NL*
their
quarters
at
Yankovo
,
ten
miles
from
Bogucharovo
,
and
went
for
a
*NL*
ride
--
to
try
a
new
horse
Ilyin
had
bought
and
to
find
out
whether
there
*NL*
was
any
hay
to
be
had
in
the
villages
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
three
days
Bogucharovo
had
lain
between
the
two
hostile
*NL*
armies
,
so
that
it
was
as
easy
for
the
Russian
rearguard
to
get
to
it
as
*NL*
for
the
French
vanguard
;
Rostov
,
as
a
careful
squadron
commander
,
wished
*NL*
to
take
such
provisions
as
remained
at
Bogucharovo
before
the
French
*NL*
could
get
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
and
Ilyin
were
in
the
merriest
of
moods
.
On
the
way
to
*NL*
Bogucharovo
,
a
princely
estate
with
a
dwelling
house
and
farm
where
they
*NL*
hoped
to
find
many
domestic
serfs
and
pretty
girls
,
they
questioned
*NL*
Lavrushka
about
Napoleon
and
laughed
at
his
stories
,
and
raced
one
*NL*
another
to
try
Ilyin
's
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
had
no
idea
that
the
village
he
was
entering
was
the
property
of
*NL*
that
very
Bolkonski
who
had
been
engaged
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
and
Ilyin
gave
rein
to
their
horses
for
a
last
race
along
the
*NL*
incline
before
reaching
Bogucharovo
,
and
Rostov
,
outstripping
Ilyin
,
was
*NL*
the
first
to
gallop
into
the
village
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
first
!
''
cried
Ilyin
,
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
always
first
both
on
the
grassland
and
here
,
''
answered
Rostov
,
*NL*
stroking
his
heated
Donets
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'd
have
won
on
my
Frenchy
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Lavrushka
from
*NL*
behind
,
alluding
to
his
shabby
cart
horse
,
``
only
I
did
n't
wish
to
*NL*
mortify
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rode
at
a
footpace
to
the
barn
,
where
a
large
crowd
of
peasants
was
*NL*
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
men
bared
their
heads
,
others
stared
at
the
new
arrivals
*NL*
without
doffing
their
caps
.
Two
tall
old
peasants
with
wrinkled
faces
*NL*
and
scanty
beards
emerged
from
the
tavern
,
smiling
,
staggering
,
and
*NL*
singing
some
incoherent
song
,
and
approached
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
fellows
!
''
said
Rostov
laughing
.
``
Is
there
any
hay
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
like
one
another
,
''
said
Ilyin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mo-o-st
me-r-r-y
co-o-m-pa
...
!
''
sang
one
of
the
peasants
with
a
*NL*
blissful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
men
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
went
up
to
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
belong
to
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
French
,
''
replied
Ilyin
jestingly
,
``
and
here
is
Napoleon
himself
''
--
*NL*
and
he
pointed
to
Lavrushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
Russians
?
''
the
peasant
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
there
a
large
force
of
you
here
?
''
said
another
,
a
short
man
,
*NL*
coming
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
large
,
''
answered
Rostov
.
``
But
why
have
you
collected
here
?
''
he
*NL*
added
.
``
Is
it
a
holiday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
men
have
met
to
talk
over
the
business
of
the
commune
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
peasant
,
moving
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
on
the
road
leading
from
the
big
house
,
two
women
and
a
*NL*
man
in
a
white
hat
were
seen
coming
toward
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
in
pink
is
mine
,
so
keep
off
!
''
said
Ilyin
on
seeing
Dunyasha
*NL*
running
resolutely
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
be
ours
!
''
said
Lavrushka
to
Ilyin
,
winking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
my
pretty
?
''
said
Ilyin
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
princess
ordered
me
to
ask
your
regiment
and
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Count
Rostov
,
squadron
commander
,
and
I
am
your
humble
*NL*
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Co-o-om-pa-ny
!
''
roared
the
tipsy
peasant
with
a
beatific
smile
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
Ilyin
talking
to
the
girl
.
Following
Dunyasha
,
Alpatych
*NL*
advanced
to
Rostov
,
having
bared
his
head
while
still
at
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
make
bold
to
trouble
your
honor
?
''
said
he
respectfully
,
but
with
*NL*
a
shade
of
contempt
for
the
youthfulness
of
this
officer
and
with
a
hand
*NL*
thrust
into
his
bosom
.
``
My
mistress
,
daughter
of
General
in
Chief
Prince
*NL*
Nicholas
Bolkonski
who
died
on
the
fifteenth
of
this
month
,
finding
*NL*
herself
in
difficulties
owing
to
the
boorishness
of
these
people
''
--
he
*NL*
pointed
to
the
peasants
--
``
asks
you
to
come
up
to
the
house
...
Wo
n't
*NL*
you
,
please
,
ride
on
a
little
farther
,
''
said
Alpatych
with
a
melancholy
*NL*
smile
,
``
as
it
is
not
convenient
in
the
presence
of
...
?
''
He
pointed
to
*NL*
the
two
peasants
who
kept
as
close
to
him
as
horseflies
to
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
...
Alpatych
...
Ah
,
Yakov
Alpatych
...
Grand
!
Forgive
us
for
Christ
's
*NL*
sake
,
eh
?
''
said
the
peasants
,
smiling
joyfully
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
looked
at
the
tipsy
peasants
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
perhaps
they
amuse
your
honor
?
''
remarked
Alpatych
with
a
staid
air
,
*NL*
as
he
pointed
at
the
old
men
with
his
free
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
there
's
not
much
to
be
amused
at
here
,
''
said
Rostov
,
and
rode
on
a
*NL*
little
way
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
bold
to
inform
your
honor
that
the
rude
peasants
here
do
n't
wish
*NL*
to
let
the
mistress
leave
the
estate
,
and
threaten
to
unharness
her
*NL*
horses
,
so
that
though
everything
has
been
packed
up
since
morning
,
her
*NL*
excellency
can
not
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
exclaimed
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
to
report
to
you
the
actual
truth
,
''
said
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
dismounted
,
gave
his
horse
to
the
orderly
,
and
followed
Alpatych
*NL*
to
the
house
,
questioning
him
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
.
It
appeared
*NL*
that
the
princess
'
offer
of
corn
to
the
peasants
the
previous
day
,
and
*NL*
her
talk
with
Dron
and
at
the
meeting
,
had
actually
had
so
bad
an
effect
*NL*
that
Dron
had
finally
given
up
the
keys
and
joined
the
peasants
and
had
*NL*
not
appeared
when
Alpatych
sent
for
him
;
and
that
in
the
morning
when
*NL*
the
princess
gave
orders
to
harness
for
her
journey
,
the
peasants
had
*NL*
come
in
a
large
crowd
to
the
barn
and
sent
word
that
they
would
not
let
*NL*
her
leave
the
village
:
that
there
was
an
order
not
to
move
,
and
that
*NL*
they
would
unharness
the
horses
.
Alpatych
had
gone
out
to
admonish
them
,
*NL*
but
was
told
-LRB-
it
was
chiefly
Karp
who
did
the
talking
,
Dron
not
showing
*NL*
himself
in
the
crowd
-RRB-
that
they
could
not
let
the
princess
go
,
that
*NL*
there
was
an
order
to
the
contrary
,
but
that
if
she
stayed
they
would
*NL*
serve
her
as
before
and
obey
her
in
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Rostov
and
Ilyin
were
galloping
along
the
road
,
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
despite
the
dissuasions
of
Alpatych
,
her
nurse
,
and
the
*NL*
maids
,
had
given
orders
to
harness
and
intended
to
start
,
but
when
the
*NL*
cavalrymen
were
espied
they
were
taken
for
Frenchmen
,
the
coachman
ran
*NL*
away
,
and
the
women
in
the
house
began
to
wail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
Benefactor
!
God
has
sent
you
!
''
exclaimed
deeply
moved
voices
as
*NL*
Rostov
passed
through
the
anteroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
sitting
helpless
and
bewildered
in
the
large
sitting
*NL*
room
,
when
Rostov
was
shown
in
.
She
could
not
grasp
who
he
was
and
why
*NL*
he
had
come
,
or
what
was
happening
to
her
.
When
she
saw
his
Russian
*NL*
face
,
and
by
his
walk
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
recognized
him
as
a
*NL*
man
of
her
own
class
,
she
glanced
at
him
with
her
deep
radiant
look
and
*NL*
began
speaking
in
a
voice
that
faltered
and
trembled
with
emotion
.
This
*NL*
meeting
immediately
struck
Rostov
as
a
romantic
event
.
``
A
helpless
girl
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
grief
,
left
to
the
mercy
of
coarse
,
rioting
peasants
!
*NL*
And
what
a
strange
fate
sent
me
here
!
What
gentleness
and
nobility
there
*NL*
are
in
her
features
and
expression
!
''
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
her
and
*NL*
listened
to
her
timid
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
began
to
tell
him
that
all
this
had
happened
the
day
after
her
*NL*
father
's
funeral
,
her
voice
trembled
.
She
turned
away
,
and
then
,
as
if
*NL*
fearing
he
might
take
her
words
as
meant
to
move
him
to
pity
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
with
an
apprehensive
glance
of
inquiry
.
There
were
tears
in
Rostov
's
*NL*
eyes
.
Princess
Mary
noticed
this
and
glanced
gratefully
at
him
with
that
*NL*
radiant
look
which
caused
the
plainness
of
her
face
to
be
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
express
,
Princess
,
how
glad
I
am
that
I
happened
to
ride
here
*NL*
and
am
able
to
show
my
readiness
to
serve
you
,
''
said
Rostov
,
rising
.
``
Go
*NL*
when
you
please
,
and
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
no
one
shall
dare
*NL*
to
cause
you
annoyance
if
only
you
will
allow
me
to
act
as
your
escort
.
''
*NL*
And
bowing
respectfully
,
as
if
to
a
lady
of
royal
blood
,
he
moved
toward
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
's
deferential
tone
seemed
to
indicate
that
though
he
would
*NL*
consider
himself
happy
to
be
acquainted
with
her
,
he
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
take
advantage
of
her
misfortunes
to
intrude
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
understood
this
and
appreciated
his
delicacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
,
very
grateful
to
you
,
''
she
said
in
French
,
``
but
I
hope
it
*NL*
was
all
a
misunderstanding
and
that
no
one
is
to
blame
for
it
.
''
She
*NL*
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
,
knitting
his
brows
,
left
the
room
with
another
low
bow
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
she
pretty
?
Ah
,
friend
--
my
pink
one
is
delicious
;
her
name
is
*NL*
Dunyasha
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
glancing
at
Rostov
's
face
Ilyin
stopped
short
.
He
saw
that
his
*NL*
hero
and
commander
was
following
quite
a
different
train
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
glanced
angrily
at
Ilyin
and
without
replying
strode
off
with
*NL*
rapid
steps
to
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
them
;
I
'll
give
it
to
them
,
the
brigands
!
''
said
he
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
at
a
gliding
trot
,
only
just
managing
not
to
run
,
kept
up
with
*NL*
him
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
decision
have
you
been
pleased
to
come
to
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
stopped
and
,
clenching
his
fists
,
suddenly
and
sternly
turned
on
*NL*
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decision
?
What
decision
?
Old
dotard
!
...
''
cried
he
.
``
What
have
you
been
*NL*
about
?
Eh
?
The
peasants
are
rioting
,
and
you
ca
n't
manage
them
?
You
're
a
*NL*
traitor
yourself
!
I
know
you
.
I
'll
flay
you
all
alive
!
...
''
And
as
if
*NL*
afraid
of
wasting
his
store
of
anger
,
he
left
Alpatych
and
went
rapidly
*NL*
forward
.
Alpatych
,
mastering
his
offended
feelings
,
kept
pace
with
*NL*
Rostov
at
a
gliding
gait
and
continued
to
impart
his
views
.
He
said
the
*NL*
peasants
were
obdurate
and
that
at
the
present
moment
it
would
be
*NL*
imprudent
to
``
overresist
''
them
without
an
armed
force
,
and
would
it
not
*NL*
be
better
first
to
send
for
the
military
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
them
armed
force
...
I
'll
`
overresist
'
them
!
''
uttered
Rostov
*NL*
meaninglessly
,
breathless
with
irrational
animal
fury
and
the
need
to
*NL*
vent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
considering
what
he
would
do
he
moved
unconciously
with
quick
,
*NL*
resolute
steps
toward
the
crowd
.
And
the
nearer
he
drew
to
it
the
more
*NL*
Alpatych
felt
that
this
unreasonable
action
might
produce
good
results
.
*NL*
The
peasants
in
the
crowd
were
similarly
impressed
when
they
saw
*NL*
Rostov
's
rapid
,
firm
steps
and
resolute
,
frowning
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
hussars
had
come
to
the
village
and
Rostov
had
gone
to
see
the
*NL*
princess
,
a
certain
confusion
and
dissension
had
arisen
among
the
crowd
.
*NL*
Some
of
the
peasants
said
that
these
new
arrivals
were
Russians
and
*NL*
might
take
it
amiss
that
the
mistress
was
being
detained
.
Dron
was
of
*NL*
this
opinion
,
but
as
soon
as
he
expressed
it
Karp
and
others
attacked
*NL*
their
ex-Elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
years
have
you
been
fattening
on
the
commune
?
''
Karp
shouted
at
*NL*
him
.
``
It
's
all
one
to
you
!
You
'll
dig
up
your
pot
of
money
and
take
it
*NL*
away
with
you
...
What
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
our
homes
are
*NL*
ruined
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
been
told
to
keep
order
,
and
that
no
one
is
to
leave
their
homes
*NL*
or
take
away
a
single
grain
,
and
that
's
all
about
it
!
''
cried
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
your
son
's
turn
to
be
conscripted
,
but
no
fear
!
You
begrudged
*NL*
your
lump
of
a
son
,
''
a
little
old
man
suddenly
began
attacking
Dron
--
*NL*
``
and
so
they
took
my
Vanka
to
be
shaved
for
a
soldier
!
But
we
all
have
*NL*
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
we
all
have
to
die
.
I
'm
not
against
the
commune
,
''
said
*NL*
Dron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
--
not
against
it
!
You
've
filled
your
belly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
tall
peasants
had
their
say
.
As
soon
as
Rostov
,
followed
by
*NL*
Ilyin
,
Lavrushka
,
and
Alpatych
,
came
up
to
the
crowd
,
Karp
,
thrusting
*NL*
his
fingers
into
his
belt
and
smiling
a
little
,
walked
to
the
front
.
*NL*
Dron
on
the
contrary
retired
to
the
rear
and
the
crowd
drew
closer
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
your
Elder
here
?
Hey
?
''
shouted
Rostov
,
coming
up
to
the
crowd
*NL*
with
quick
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Elder
?
What
do
you
want
with
him
?
...
''
asked
Karp
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
,
his
cap
flew
off
and
a
*NL*
fierce
blow
jerked
his
head
to
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caps
off
,
traitors
!
''
shouted
Rostov
in
a
wrathful
voice
.
``
Where
's
the
*NL*
Elder
?
''
he
cried
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Elder
...
He
wants
the
Elder
!
...
Dron
Zakharych
,
you
!
''
meek
and
*NL*
flustered
voices
here
and
there
were
heard
calling
and
caps
began
to
*NL*
come
off
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
riot
,
we
're
following
the
orders
,
''
declared
Karp
,
and
at
that
*NL*
moment
several
voices
began
speaking
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
the
old
men
have
decided
--
there
's
too
many
of
you
giving
*NL*
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arguing
?
Mutiny
!
...
Brigands
!
Traitors
!
''
cried
Rostov
unmeaningly
in
a
*NL*
voice
not
his
own
,
gripping
Karp
by
the
collar
.
``
Bind
him
,
bind
him
!
''
he
*NL*
shouted
,
though
there
was
no
one
to
bind
him
but
Lavrushka
and
Alpatych
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lavrushka
,
however
,
ran
up
to
Karp
and
seized
him
by
the
arms
from
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
call
up
our
men
from
beyond
the
hill
?
''
he
called
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alpatych
turned
to
the
peasants
and
ordered
two
of
them
by
name
to
come
*NL*
and
bind
Karp
.
The
men
obediently
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
began
taking
*NL*
off
their
belts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
Elder
?
''
demanded
Rostov
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
pale
and
frowning
face
Dron
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
Elder
?
Bind
him
,
Lavrushka
!
''
shouted
Rostov
,
as
if
that
*NL*
order
,
too
,
could
not
possibly
meet
with
any
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
fact
two
more
peasants
began
binding
Dron
,
who
took
off
his
own
*NL*
belt
and
handed
it
to
them
,
as
if
to
aid
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
all
listen
to
me
!
''
said
Rostov
to
the
peasants
.
``
Be
off
to
your
*NL*
houses
at
once

and
do
n't
let
one
of
your
voices
be
heard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

we
've
not
done
any
harm

We
did
it
just
out
of
foolishness

It
's
*NL*
all
nonsense
...
I
said
then
that
it
was
not
in
order

voices
were
heard
*NL*
bickering
with
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
What
did
I
say
?
''
said
Alpatych
,
coming
into
his
own
again
.
``
It
's
*NL*
wrong
,
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
our
stupidity

Yakov
Alpatych

''
came
the
answers
,
and
the
crowd
*NL*
began
at
once
to
disperse
through
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
bound
men
were
led
off
to
the
master
's
house
.
The
two
drunken
*NL*
peasants
followed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
when
I
look
at
you
!
...
''
said
one
of
them
to
Karp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
one
talk
to
the
masters
like
that
?
What
were
you
thinking
of

*NL*
you
fool

added
the
other
--
``
A
real
fool

''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
later
the
carts
were
standing
in
the
courtyard
of
the
*NL*
Bogucharovo
house
.
The
peasants
were
briskly
carrying
out
the
*NL*
proprietor
's
goods
and
packing
them
on
the
carts
,
and
Dron
,
liberated
at
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
wish
from
the
cupboard
where
he
had
been
confined
,
was
*NL*
standing
in
the
yard
directing
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
it
in
so
carelessly
,
''
said
one
of
the
peasants
,
a
man
with
a
*NL*
round
smiling
face
,
taking
a
casket
from
a
housemaid
.
``
You
know
it
has
*NL*
cost
money
!
How
can
you
chuck
it
in
like
that
or
shove
it
under
the
cord
*NL*
where
it
'll
get
rubbed
?
I
do
n't
like
that
way
of
doing
things
.
Let
it
*NL*
all
be
done
properly
,
according
to
rule
.
Look
here
,
put
it
under
the
*NL*
bast
matting
and
cover
it
with
hay
--
that
's
the
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
books
,
books
!
''
said
another
peasant
,
bringing
out
Prince
Andrew
's
*NL*
library
cupboards
.
``
Do
n't
catch
up
against
it
!
It
's
heavy
,
lads
--
solid
*NL*
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
worked
all
day
and
did

play

''
remarked
the
tall
,
round
-
*NL*
faced
peasant
gravely
,
pointing
with
a
significant
wink
at
the
*NL*
dictionaries
that
were
on
the
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unwilling
to
obtrude
himself
on
the
princess
,
Rostov
did
not
go
back
to
*NL*
the
house
but
remained
in
the
village
awaiting
her
departure
.
When
her
*NL*
carriage
drove
out
of
the
house
,
he
mounted
and
accompanied
her
eight
*NL*
miles
from
Bogucharovo
to
where
the
road
was
occupied
by
our
troops
.
At
*NL*
the
inn
at
Yankovo
he
respectfully
took
leave
of
her
,
for
the
first
time
*NL*
permitting
himself
to
kiss
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
speak
so
!
''
he
blushingly
replied
to
Princess
Mary
's
*NL*
expressions
of
gratitude
for
her
deliverance
,
as
she
termed
what
had
*NL*
occurred
.
``
Any
police
officer
would
have
done
as
much
!
If
we
had
had
*NL*
only
peasants
to
fight
,
we
should
not
have
let
the
enemy
come
so
far
,
''
*NL*
said
he
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
wishing
to
change
the
subject
.
``
I
am
*NL*
only
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
making
your
acquaintance
.
*NL*
Good-bye
,
Princess
.
I
wish
you
happiness
and
consolation
and
hope
to
*NL*
meet
you
again
in
happier
circumstances
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
make
me
*NL*
blush
,
please
do
n't
thank
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
princess
,
if
she
did
not
again
thank
him
in
words
,
thanked
him
*NL*
with
the
whole
expression
of
her
face
,
radiant
with
gratitude
and
*NL*
tenderness
.
She
could
not
believe
that
there
was
nothing
to
thank
him
*NL*
for
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
seemed
to
her
certain
that
had
he
not
been
*NL*
there
she
would
have
perished
at
the
hands
of
the
mutineers
and
of
the
*NL*
French
,
and
that
he
had
exposed
himself
to
terrible
and
obvious
danger
*NL*
to
save
her
,
and
even
more
certain
was
it
that
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
and
*NL*
noble
soul
,
able
to
understand
her
position
and
her
sorrow
.
His
kind
,
*NL*
honest
eyes
,
with
the
tears
rising
in
them
when
she
herself
had
begun
to
*NL*
cry
as
she
spoke
of
her
loss
,
did
not
leave
her
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
taken
leave
of
him
and
remained
alone
she
suddenly
felt
her
*NL*
eyes
filling
with
tears
,
and
then
not
for
the
first
time
the
strange
*NL*
question
presented
itself
to
her
:
did
she
love
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Moscow
,
though
the
princess
'
position
was
not
*NL*
a
cheerful
one
,
Dunyasha
,
who
went
with
her
in
the
carriage
,
more
than
*NL*
once
noticed
that
her
mistress
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
smiled
at
*NL*
something
with
an
expression
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
supposing
I
do
love
him
?
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ashamed
as
she
was
of
acknowledging
to
herself
that
she
had
fallen
in
*NL*
love
with
a
man
who
would
perhaps
never
love
her
,
she
comforted
herself
*NL*
with
the
thought
that
no
one
would
ever
know
it
and
that
she
would
not
*NL*
be
to
blame
if
,
without
ever
speaking
of
it
to
anyone
,
she
continued
to
*NL*
the
end
of
her
life
to
love
the
man
with
whom
she
had
fallen
in
love
for
*NL*
the
first
and
last
time
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
when
she
recalled
his
looks
,
his
sympathy
,
and
his
words
,
*NL*
happiness
did
not
appear
impossible
to
her
.
It
was
at
those
moments
that
*NL*
Dunyasha
noticed
her
smiling
as
she
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
not
fate
that
brought
him
to
Bogucharovo
,
and
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
?
''
thought
Princess
Mary
.
``
And
that
caused
his
sister
to
refuse
my
*NL*
brother
?
''
And
in
all
this
Princess
Mary
saw
the
hand
of
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
the
princess
made
on
Rostov
was
a
very
agreeable
one
.
To
*NL*
remember
her
gave
him
pleasure
,
and
when
his
comrades
,
hearing
of
his
*NL*
adventure
at
Bogucharovo
,
rallied
him
on
having
gone
to
look
for
hay
and
*NL*
having
picked
up
one
of
the
wealthiest
heiresses
in
Russia
,
he
grew
*NL*
angry
.
It
made
him
angry
just
because
the
idea
of
marrying
the
gentle
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
who
was
attractive
to
him
and
had
an
enormous
fortune
,
*NL*
had
against
his
will
more
than
once
entered
his
head
.
For
himself
*NL*
personally
Nicholas
could
not
wish
for
a
better
wife
:
by
marrying
her
he
*NL*
would
make
the
countess
his
mother
happy
,
would
be
able
to
put
his
*NL*
father
's
affairs
in
order
,
and
would
even
--
he
felt
it
--
ensure
Princess
*NL*
Mary
's
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sonya
?
And
his
plighted
word
?
That
was
why
Rostov
grew
angry
when
he
*NL*
was
rallied
about
Princess
Bolkonskaya
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
On
receiving
command
of
the
armies
Kutuzov
remembered
Prince
Andrew
and
*NL*
sent
an
order
for
him
to
report
at
headquarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
arrived
at
Tsarevo-Zaymishche
on
the
very
day
and
at
the
*NL*
very
hour
that
Kutuzov
was
reviewing
the
troops
for
the
first
time
.
He
*NL*
stopped
in
the
village
at
the
priest
's
house
in
front
of
which
stood
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
's
carriage
,
and
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
at
the
gate
*NL*
awaiting
his
Serene
Highness
,
as
everyone
now
called
Kutuzov
.
From
the
*NL*
field
beyond
the
village
came
now
sounds
of
regimental
music
and
now
the
*NL*
roar
of
many
voices
shouting
``
Hurrah
!
''
to
the
new
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
Two
orderlies
,
a
courier
and
a
major-domo
,
stood
near
by
,
some
ten
paces
*NL*
from
Prince
Andrew
,
availing
themselves
of
Kutuzov
's
absence
and
of
the
*NL*
fine
weather
.
A
short
,
swarthy
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
with
thick
*NL*
mustaches
and
whiskers
rode
up
to
the
gate
and
,
glancing
at
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
inquired
whether
his
Serene
Highness
was
putting
up
there
and
*NL*
whether
he
would
soon
be
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
replied
that
he
was
not
on
his
Serene
Highness
'
staff
but
*NL*
was
himself
a
new
arrival
.
The
lieutenant
colonel
turned
to
a
smart
*NL*
orderly
,
who
,
with
the
peculiar
contempt
with
which
a
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
's
orderly
speaks
to
officers
,
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
His
Serene
Highness
?
I
expect
he
'll
be
here
soon
.
What
do
you
*NL*
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
smiled
beneath
his
mustache
at
the
*NL*
orderly
's
tone
,
dismounted
,
gave
his
horse
to
a
dispatch
runner
,
and
*NL*
approached
Bolkonski
with
a
slight
bow
.
Bolkonski
made
room
for
him
on
*NL*
the
bench
and
the
lieutenant
colonel
sat
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
also
waiting
for
the
commander-in-chief
?
''
said
he
.
``
They
say
he
*NL*
weceives
evewyone
,
thank
God
!
...
It
's
awful
with
those
sausage
eaters
!
*NL*
Ermolov
had
weason
to
ask
to
be
pwomoted
to
be
a
German
!
Now
p
`
waps
*NL*
Wussians
will
get
a
look
in
.
As
it
was
,
devil
only
knows
what
was
*NL*
happening
.
We
kept
wetweating
and
wetweating
.
Did
you
take
part
in
the
*NL*
campaign
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
the
pleasure
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
``
not
only
of
taking
part
in
*NL*
the
retreat
but
of
losing
in
that
retreat
all
I
held
dear
--
not
to
*NL*
mention
the
estate
and
home
of
my
birth
--
my
father
,
who
died
of
grief
.
I
*NL*
belong
to
the
province
of
Smolensk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
You
're
Pwince
Bolkonski
?
Vewy
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
!
I
'm
*NL*
Lieutenant
Colonel
Denisov
,
better
known
as
`
Vaska
,
'
''
said
Denisov
,
*NL*
pressing
Prince
Andrew
's
hand
and
looking
into
his
face
with
a
*NL*
particularly
kindly
attention
.
``
Yes
,
I
heard
,
''
said
he
sympathetically
,
*NL*
and
after
a
short
pause
added
:
``
Yes
,
it
's
Scythian
warfare
.
It
's
all
*NL*
vewy
well
--
only
not
for
those
who
get
it
in
the
neck
.
So
you
are
Pwince
*NL*
Andwew
Bolkonski
?
''
He
swayed
his
head
.
``
Vewy
pleased
,
Pwince
,
to
make
*NL*
your
acquaintance
!
''
he
repeated
again
,
smiling
sadly
,
and
he
again
*NL*
pressed
Prince
Andrew
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
knew
Denisov
from
what
Natasha
had
told
him
of
her
first
*NL*
suitor
.
This
memory
carried
him
sadly
and
sweetly
back
to
those
painful
*NL*
feelings
of
which
he
had
not
thought
lately
,
but
which
still
found
place
*NL*
in
his
soul
.
Of
late
he
had
received
so
many
new
and
very
serious
*NL*
impressions
--
such
as
the
retreat
from
Smolensk
,
his
visit
to
Bald
Hills
,
*NL*
and
the
recent
news
of
his
father
's
death
--
and
had
experienced
so
many
*NL*
emotions
,
that
for
a
long
time
past
those
memories
had
not
entered
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
now
that
they
did
,
they
did
not
act
on
him
with
nearly
their
*NL*
former
strength
.
For
Denisov
,
too
,
the
memories
awakened
by
the
name
of
*NL*
Bolkonski
belonged
to
a
distant
,
romantic
past
,
when
after
supper
and
*NL*
after
Natasha
's
singing
he
had
proposed
to
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
*NL*
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
.
He
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
*NL*
that
time
and
of
his
love
for
Natasha
,
and
passed
at
once
to
what
now
*NL*
interested
him
passionately
and
exclusively
.
This
was
a
plan
of
campaign
*NL*
he
had
devised
while
serving
at
the
outposts
during
the
retreat
.
He
had
*NL*
proposed
that
plan
to
Barclay
de
Tolly
and
now
wished
to
propose
it
to
*NL*
Kutuzov
.
The
plan
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
French
line
of
*NL*
operation
was
too
extended
,
and
it
proposed
that
instead
of
,
or
*NL*
concurrently
with
,
action
on
the
front
to
bar
the
advance
of
the
French
,
*NL*
we
should
attack
their
line
of
communication
.
He
began
explaining
his
*NL*
plan
to
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
hold
all
that
line
.
It
's
impossible
.
I
will
undertake
to
*NL*
bweak
thwough
.
Give
me
five
hundwed
men
and
I
will
bweak
the
line
,
*NL*
that
's
certain
!
There
's
only
one
way
--
guewilla
warfare
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
rose
and
began
gesticulating
as
he
explained
his
plan
to
*NL*
Bolkonski
.
In
the
midst
of
his
explanation
shouts
were
heard
from
the
*NL*
army
,
growing
more
incoherent
and
more
diffused
,
mingling
with
music
and
*NL*
songs
and
coming
from
the
field
where
the
review
was
held
.
Sounds
of
*NL*
hoofs
and
shouts
were
nearing
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
coming
!
He
's
coming
!
''
shouted
a
Cossack
standing
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkonski
and
Denisov
moved
to
the
gate
,
at
which
a
knot
of
soldiers
-LRB-
a
*NL*
guard
of
honor
-RRB-
was
standing
,
and
they
saw
Kutuzov
coming
down
the
*NL*
street
mounted
on
a
rather
small
sorrel
horse
.
A
huge
suite
of
generals
*NL*
rode
behind
him
.
Barclay
was
riding
almost
beside
him
,
and
a
crowd
of
*NL*
officers
ran
after
and
around
them
shouting
,
``
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
adjutants
galloped
into
the
yard
before
him
.
Kutuzov
was
impatiently
*NL*
urging
on
his
horse
,
which
ambled
smoothly
under
his
weight
,
and
he
*NL*
raised
his
hand
to
his
white
Horse
Guard
's
cap
with
a
red
band
and
no
*NL*
peak
,
nodding
his
head
continually
.
When
he
came
up
to
the
guard
of
*NL*
honor
,
a
fine
set
of
Grenadiers
mostly
wearing
decorations
,
who
were
*NL*
giving
him
the
salute
,
he
looked
at
them
silently
and
attentively
for
*NL*
nearly
a
minute
with
the
steady
gaze
of
a
commander
and
then
turned
to
*NL*
the
crowd
of
generals
and
officers
surrounding
him
.
Suddenly
his
face
*NL*
assumed
a
subtle
expression
,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
*NL*
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
such
fine
fellows
to
retreat
and
retreat
!
Well
,
good-by
,
*NL*
General
,
''
he
added
,
and
rode
into
the
yard
past
Prince
Andrew
and
*NL*
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
hurrah
!
hurrah
!
''
shouted
those
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Prince
Andrew
had
last
seen
him
Kutuzov
had
grown
still
more
*NL*
corpulent
,
flaccid
,
and
fat
.
But
the
bleached
eyeball
,
the
scar
,
and
the
*NL*
familiar
weariness
of
his
expression
were
still
the
same
.
He
was
wearing
*NL*
the
white
Horse
Guard
's
cap
and
a
military
overcoat
with
a
whip
hanging
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
by
a
thin
strap
.
He
sat
heavily
and
swayed
limply
on
*NL*
his
brisk
little
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whew
...
whew
...
whew
!
''
he
whistled
just
audibly
as
he
rode
into
the
*NL*
yard
.
His
face
expressed
the
relief
of
relaxed
strain
felt
by
a
man
who
*NL*
means
to
rest
after
a
ceremony
.
He
drew
his
left
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
*NL*
and
,
lurching
with
his
whole
body
and
puckering
his
face
with
the
*NL*
effort
,
raised
it
with
difficulty
onto
the
saddle
,
leaned
on
his
knee
,
*NL*
groaned
,
and
slipped
down
into
the
arms
of
the
Cossacks
and
adjutants
*NL*
who
stood
ready
to
assist
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
himself
together
,
looked
round
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
,
glanced
*NL*
at
Prince
Andrew
,
and
,
evidently
not
recognizing
him
,
moved
with
his
*NL*
waddling
gait
to
the
porch
.
``
Whew
...
whew
...
whew
!
''
he
whistled
,
and
*NL*
again
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew
.
As
often
occurs
with
old
men
,
it
was
*NL*
only
after
some
seconds
that
the
impression
produced
by
Prince
Andrew
's
*NL*
face
linked
itself
up
with
Kutuzov
's
remembrance
of
his
personality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
do
you
do
,
my
dear
prince
?
How
do
you
do
,
my
dear
boy
?
Come
*NL*
along
...
''
said
he
,
glancing
wearily
round
,
and
he
stepped
onto
the
porch
*NL*
which
creaked
under
his
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
received
news
of
his
death
,
yesterday
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
dismay
and
then
took
off
*NL*
his
cap
and
crossed
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
be
his
!
God
's
will
be
done
to
us
all
!
''
He
*NL*
sighed
deeply
,
his
whole
chest
heaving
,
and
was
silent
for
a
while
.
``
I
*NL*
loved
him
and
respected
him
,
and
sympathize
with
you
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
embraced
Prince
Andrew
,
pressing
him
to
his
fat
breast
,
and
for
some
*NL*
time
did
not
let
him
go
.
When
he
released
him
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
flabby
lips
were
trembling
and
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
sighed
and
pressed
on
the
bench
with
both
hands
to
raise
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Come
with
me
,
we
'll
have
a
talk
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
Denisov
,
no
more
intimidated
by
his
superiors
than
by
*NL*
the
enemy
,
came
with
jingling
spurs
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
,
despite
*NL*
the
angry
whispers
of
the
adjutants
who
tried
to
stop
him
.
Kutuzov
,
his
*NL*
hands
still
pressed
on
the
seat
,
glanced
at
him
glumly
.
Denisov
,
having
*NL*
given
his
name
,
announced
that
he
had
to
communicate
to
his
Serene
*NL*
Highness
a
matter
of
great
importance
for
their
country
's
welfare
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
wearily
at
him
and
,
lifting
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
*NL*
annoyance
,
folded
them
across
his
stomach
,
repeating
the
words
:
``
For
our
*NL*
country
's
welfare
?
Well
,
what
is
it
?
Speak
!
''
Denisov
blushed
like
a
girl
*NL*
-LRB-
it
was
strange
to
see
the
color
rise
in
that
shaggy
,
bibulous
,
time
-
*NL*
worn
face
-RRB-
and
boldly
began
to
expound
his
plan
of
cutting
the
enemy
's
*NL*
lines
of
communication
between
Smolensk
and
Vyazma
.
Denisov
came
from
*NL*
those
parts
and
knew
the
country
well
.
His
plan
seemed
decidedly
a
good
*NL*
one
,
especially
from
the
strength
of
conviction
with
which
he
spoke
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
down
at
his
own
legs
,
occasionally
glancing
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
adjoining
hut
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
to
emerge
from
*NL*
it
.
And
from
that
hut
,
while
Denisov
was
speaking
,
a
general
with
a
*NL*
portfolio
under
his
arm
really
did
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Kutuzov
,
in
the
midst
of
Denisov
's
explanations
,
``
are
you
*NL*
ready
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
your
Serene
Highness
,
''
replied
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
swayed
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
How
is
one
man
to
deal
with
*NL*
it
all
?
''
and
again
listened
to
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
my
word
of
honor
as
a
Wussian
officer
,
''
said
Denisov
,
``
that
I
*NL*
can
bweak
Napoleon
's
line
of
communication
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
relation
are
you
to
Intendant
General
Kiril
Andreevich
Denisov
?
''
*NL*
asked
Kutuzov
,
interrupting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
my
uncle
,
your
Sewene
Highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
we
were
friends
,
''
said
Kutuzov
cheerfully
.
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
*NL*
friend
,
stay
here
at
the
staff
and
tomorrow
we
'll
have
a
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
nod
to
Denisov
he
turned
away
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
had
brought
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
your
Serene
Highness
like
to
come
inside
?
''
said
the
general
*NL*
on
duty
in
a
discontented
voice
,
``
the
plans
must
be
examined
and
several
*NL*
papers
have
to
be
signed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
adjutant
came
out
and
announced
that
everything
was
in
readiness
*NL*
within
.
But
Kutuzov
evidently
did
not
wish
to
enter
that
room
till
he
*NL*
was
disengaged
.
He
made
a
grimace
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
tell
them
to
bring
a
small
table
out
here
,
my
dear
boy
.
I
'll
look
*NL*
at
them
here
,
''
said
he
.
``
Do
n't
go
away
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
who
remained
in
the
porch
and
listened
to
the
general
's
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
being
given
,
Prince
Andrew
heard
the
whisper
of
a
woman
's
*NL*
voice
and
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
behind
the
door
.
Several
times
on
*NL*
glancing
that
way
he
noticed
behind
that
door
a
plump
,
rosy
,
handsome
*NL*
woman
in
a
pink
dress
with
a
lilac
silk
kerchief
on
her
head
,
holding
a
*NL*
dish
and
evidently
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
adjutant
whispered
to
Prince
Andrew
that
this
was
the
wife
of
*NL*
the
priest
whose
home
it
was
,
and
that
she
intended
to
offer
his
Serene
*NL*
Highness
bread
and
salt
.
``
Her
husband
has
welcomed
his
Serene
Highness
*NL*
with
the
cross
at
the
church
,
and
she
intends
to
welcome
him
in
the
*NL*
house
...
She
's
very
pretty
,
''
added
the
adjutant
with
a
smile
.
At
those
*NL*
words
Kutuzov
looked
round
.
He
was
listening
to
the
general
's
report
--
*NL*
which
consisted
chiefly
of
a
criticism
of
the
position
at
Tsarevo
-
*NL*
Zaymishche
--
as
he
had
listened
to
Denisov
,
and
seven
years
previously
*NL*
had
listened
to
the
discussion
at
the
Austerlitz
council
of
war
.
He
*NL*
evidently
listened
only
because
he
had
ears
which
,
though
there
was
a
*NL*
piece
of
tow
in
one
of
them
,
could
not
help
hearing
;
but
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
nothing
the
general
could
say
would
surprise
or
even
interest
him
,
*NL*
that
he
knew
all
that
would
be
said
beforehand
,
and
heard
it
all
only
*NL*
because
he
had
to
,
as
one
has
to
listen
to
the
chanting
of
a
service
of
*NL*
prayer
.
All
that
Denisov
had
said
was
clever
and
to
the
point
.
What
the
*NL*
general
was
saying
was
even
more
clever
and
to
the
point
,
but
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
Kutuzov
despised
knowledge
and
cleverness
,
and
knew
of
*NL*
something
else
that
would
decide
the
matter
--
something
independent
of
*NL*
cleverness
and
knowledge
.
Prince
Andrew
watched
the
commander-in-chief
's
*NL*
face
attentively
,
and
the
only
expression
he
could
see
there
was
one
of
*NL*
boredom
,
curiosity
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
feminine
whispering
behind
*NL*
the
door
,
and
a
desire
to
observe
propriety
.
It
was
evident
that
Kutuzov
*NL*
despised
cleverness
and
learning
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
by
*NL*
Denisov
,
but
despised
them
not
because
of
his
own
intellect
,
feelings
,
*NL*
or
knowledge
--
he
did
not
try
to
display
any
of
these
--
but
because
of
*NL*
something
else
.
He
despised
them
because
of
his
old
age
and
experience
*NL*
of
life
.
The
only
instruction
Kutuzov
gave
of
his
own
accord
during
that
*NL*
report
referred
to
looting
by
the
Russian
troops
.
At
the
end
of
the
*NL*
report
the
general
put
before
him
for
signature
a
paper
relating
to
the
*NL*
recovery
of
payment
from
army
commanders
for
green
oats
mown
down
by
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
when
landowners
lodged
petitions
for
compensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
hearing
the
matter
,
Kutuzov
smacked
his
lips
together
and
shook
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
the
stove
...
into
the
fire
with
it
!
I
tell
you
once
for
all
,
my
*NL*
dear
fellow
,
''
said
he
,
``
into
the
fire
with
all
such
things
!
Let
them
cut
*NL*
the
crops
and
burn
wood
to
their
hearts
'
content
.
I
do
n't
order
it
or
*NL*
allow
it
,
but
I
do
n't
exact
compensation
either
.
One
ca
n't
get
on
*NL*
without
it
.
`
When
wood
is
chopped
the
chips
will
fly
.
'
''
He
looked
at
the
*NL*
paper
again
.
``
Oh
,
this
German
precision
!
''
he
muttered
,
shaking
his
head
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
!
''
said
Kutuzov
as
he
signed
the
last
of
the
documents
,
*NL*
and
rising
heavily
and
smoothing
out
the
folds
in
his
fat
white
neck
he
*NL*
moved
toward
the
door
with
a
more
cheerful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
's
wife
,
flushing
rosy
red
,
caught
up
the
dish
she
had
after
*NL*
all
not
managed
to
present
at
the
right
moment
,
though
she
had
so
long
*NL*
been
preparing
for
it
,
and
with
a
low
bow
offered
it
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
smiled
,
lifted
her
chin
with
his
hand
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
beauty
!
Thank
you
,
sweetheart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
some
gold
pieces
from
his
trouser
pocket
and
put
them
on
the
*NL*
dish
for
her
.
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
and
how
are
we
getting
on
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
moving
to
the
door
of
the
room
assigned
to
him
.
The
priest
's
wife
*NL*
smiled
,
and
with
dimples
in
her
rosy
cheeks
followed
him
into
the
room
.
*NL*
The
adjutant
came
out
to
the
porch
and
asked
Prince
Andrew
to
lunch
with
*NL*
him
.
Half
an
hour
later
Prince
Andrew
was
again
called
to
Kutuzov
.
He
*NL*
found
him
reclining
in
an
armchair
,
still
in
the
same
unbuttoned
*NL*
overcoat
.
He
had
in
his
hand
a
French
book
which
he
closed
as
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
entered
,
marking
the
place
with
a
knife
.
Prince
Andrew
saw
by
the
*NL*
cover
that
it
was
Les
Chevaliers
du
Cygne
by
Madame
de
Genlis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sit
down
,
sit
down
here
.
Let
's
have
a
talk
,
''
said
Kutuzov
.
``
It
's
*NL*
sad
,
very
sad
.
But
remember
,
my
dear
fellow
,
that
I
am
a
father
to
you
,
*NL*
a
second
father
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
told
Kutuzov
all
he
knew
of
his
father
's
death
,
and
what
*NL*
he
had
seen
at
Bald
Hills
when
he
passed
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
...
what
they
have
brought
us
to
!
''
Kutuzov
suddenly
cried
in
an
*NL*
agitated
voice
,
evidently
picturing
vividly
to
himself
from
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
story
the
condition
Russia
was
in
.
``
But
give
me
time
,
give
me
*NL*
time
!
''
he
said
with
a
grim
look
,
evidently
not
wishing
to
continue
this
*NL*
agitating
conversation
,
and
added
:
``
I
sent
for
you
to
keep
you
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
your
Serene
Highness
,
but
I
fear
I
am
no
longer
fit
for
the
*NL*
staff
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
with
a
smile
which
Kutuzov
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
glanced
inquiringly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
above
all
,
''
added
Prince
Andrew
,
``
I
have
grown
used
to
my
regiment
,
*NL*
am
fond
of
the
officers
,
and
I
fancy
the
men
also
like
me
.
I
should
be
*NL*
sorry
to
leave
the
regiment
.
If
I
decline
the
honor
of
being
with
you
,
*NL*
believe
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shrewd
,
kindly
,
yet
subtly
derisive
expression
lit
up
Kutuzov
's
podgy
*NL*
face
.
He
cut
Bolkonski
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
for
I
need
you
.
But
you
're
right
,
you
're
right
!
It
's
not
*NL*
here
that
men
are
needed
.
Advisers
are
always
plentiful
,
but
men
are
*NL*
not
.
The
regiments
would
not
be
what
they
are
if
the
would-be
advisers
*NL*
served
there
as
you
do
.
I
remember
you
at
Austerlitz
...
I
remember
,
*NL*
yes
,
I
remember
you
with
the
standard
!
''
said
Kutuzov
,
and
a
flush
of
*NL*
pleasure
suffused
Prince
Andrew
's
face
at
this
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
downwards
,
Kutuzov
offered
his
cheek
to
*NL*
be
kissed
,
and
again
Prince
Andrew
noticed
tears
in
the
old
man
's
eyes
.
*NL*
Though
Prince
Andrew
knew
that
Kutuzov
's
tears
came
easily
,
and
that
he
*NL*
was
particularly
tender
to
and
considerate
of
him
from
a
wish
to
show
*NL*
sympathy
with
his
loss
,
yet
this
reminder
of
Austerlitz
was
both
*NL*
pleasant
and
flattering
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
your
way
and
God
be
with
you
.
I
know
your
path
is
the
path
of
*NL*
honor
!
''
He
paused
.
``
I
missed
you
at
Bucharest
,
but
I
needed
someone
to
*NL*
send
.
''
And
changing
the
subject
,
Kutuzov
began
to
speak
of
the
Turkish
*NL*
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
concluded
.
``
Yes
,
I
have
been
much
*NL*
blamed
,
''
he
said
,
``
both
for
that
war
and
the
peace
...
but
everything
*NL*
came
at
the
right
time
.
Tout
vient
a
point
a
celui
qui
sait
attendre
.
*
*NL*
And
there
were
as
many
advisers
there
as
here
...
''
he
went
on
,
returning
*NL*
to
the
subject
of
``
advisers
''
which
evidently
occupied
him
.
``
Ah
,
those
*NL*
advisers
!
''
said
he
.
``
If
we
had
listened
to
them
all
we
should
not
have
*NL*
made
peace
with
Turkey
and
should
not
have
been
through
with
that
war
.
*NL*
Everything
in
haste
,
but
more
haste
,
less
speed
.
Kamenski
would
have
*NL*
been
lost
if
he
had
not
died
.
He
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
*NL*
men
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
capture
a
fortress
but
it
is
difficult
to
*NL*
win
a
campaign
.
For
that
,
not
storming
and
attacking
but
patience
and
*NL*
time
are
wanted
.
Kamenski
sent
soldiers
to
Rustchuk
,
but
I
only
employed
*NL*
these
two
things
and
took
more
fortresses
than
Kamenski
and
made
them
*NL*
Turks
eat
horseflesh
!
''
He
swayed
his
head
.
``
And
the
French
shall
too
,
*NL*
believe
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
growing
warmer
and
beating
his
chest
,
``
I
'll
*NL*
make
them
eat
horseflesh
!
''
And
tears
again
dimmed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Everything
comes
in
time
to
him
who
knows
how
to
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
sha
n't
we
have
to
accept
battle
?
''
remarked
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
if
everybody
wants
it
;
it

But
believe
me
,
*NL*
my
dear
boy
,
there
is
nothing
stronger
than
those
two
:
patience
and
*NL*
time
,
they
will
do
it
all
.
But
the
advisers

Some
want
a
thing
--
others
do

.
What
's
one
to
*NL*
do
?
''
he
asked
,
evidently
expecting
an
answer
.
``
Well
,
what
do
you
want
us
*NL*
to
do
?
''
he
repeated
and
his
eye
shone
with
a
deep
,
shrewd
look
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
what
to
do
,
''
he
continued
,
as
Prince
Andrew
still
did
not
*NL*
reply
:
``
I
will
tell
you
what
to
do

and
what
I
do

''
he
paused
,
``
abstiens-toi

-LRB-

-RRB-
--
he
articulated
the
French
proverb
*NL*
deliberately
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Do
n't
see
it
that

-LRB-

-RRB-
``

*NL*
``

your

I
am
not

*NL*
nor
a
commander-in-chief
,
but
a
father

If
you
want
anything
come
*NL*
straight
to
me
.
Good-bye

my
dear
boy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
embraced
and
kissed
Prince
Andrew
,
but
before
the
latter
had
*NL*
left
the
room
Kutuzov
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
on
with
his
*NL*
unfinished
novel
,
Les
Chevaliers
du
Cygne
by
Madame
de
Genlis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
could
not
have
explained
how
or
why
it
was
,
but
after
that
*NL*
interview
with
Kutuzov
he
went
back
to
his
regiment
reassured
as
to
the
*NL*
general
course
of
affairs
and
as
to
the
man
to
whom
it
had
been
*NL*
entrusted
.
The
more
he
realized
the
absence
of
all
personal
motive
in
*NL*
that
old
man
--
in
whom
there
seemed
to
remain
only
the
habit
of
passions
,
*NL*
and
in
place
of
an
intellect
-LRB-
grouping
events
and
drawing
conclusions
-RRB-
*NL*
only
the
capacity
calmly
to
contemplate
the
course
of
events
--
the
more
*NL*
reassured
he
was
that
everything
would
be
as
it
should
.
``
He
will
not
*NL*
bring
in
any
plan
of
his
own
.
He
will
not
devise
or
undertake
anything
,
''
*NL*
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
``
but
he
will
hear
everything
,
remember
*NL*
everything
,
and
put
everything
in
its
place
.
He
will
not
hinder
anything
*NL*
useful
nor
allow
anything
harmful
.
He
understands
that
there
is
*NL*
something
stronger
and
more
important
than
his
own
will
--
the
inevitable
*NL*
course
of
events
,
and
he
can
see
them
and
grasp
their
significance
,
and
*NL*
seeing
that
significance
can
refrain
from
meddling
and
renounce
his
*NL*
personal
wish
directed
to
something
else
.
And
above
all
,
''
thought
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
,
``
one
believes
in
him
because
he
's
Russian
,
despite
the
novel
by
*NL*
Genlis
and
the
French
proverbs
,
and
because
his
voice
shook
when
he
*NL*
said
:
`
What
they
have
brought
us
to
!
'
and
had
a
sob
in
it
when
he
said
*NL*
he
would
`
make
them
eat
horseflesh
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
such
feelings
,
more
or
less
dimly
shared
by
all
,
the
unanimity
and
*NL*
general
approval
were
founded
with
which
,
despite
court
influences
,
the
*NL*
popular
choice
of
Kutuzov
as
commander-in-chief
was
received
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
Emperor
had
left
Moscow
,
life
flowed
on
there
in
its
usual
*NL*
course
,
and
its
course
was
so
very
usual
that
it
was
difficult
to
*NL*
remember
the
recent
days
of
patriotic
elation
and
ardor
,
hard
to
believe
*NL*
that
Russia
was
really
in
danger
and
that
the
members
of
the
English
*NL*
Club
were
also
sons
of
the
Fatherland
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
*NL*
it
.
The
one
thing
that
recalled
the
patriotic
fervor
everyone
had
*NL*
displayed
during
the
Emperor
's
stay
was
the
call
for
contributions
of
*NL*
men
and
money
,
a
necessity
that
as
soon
as
the
promises
had
been
made
*NL*
assumed
a
legal
,
official
form
and
became
unavoidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
enemy
's
approach
to
Moscow
,
the
Moscovites
'
view
of
their
*NL*
situation
did
not
grow
more
serious
but
on
the
contrary
became
even
more
*NL*
frivolous
,
as
always
happens
with
people
who
see
a
great
danger
*NL*
approaching
.
At
the
approach
of
danger
there
are
always
two
voices
that
*NL*
speak
with
equal
power
in
the
human
soul
:
one
very
reasonably
tells
a
*NL*
man
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
danger
and
the
means
of
escaping
it
;
*NL*
the
other
,
still
more
reasonably
,
says
that
it
is
too
depressing
and
*NL*
painful
to
think
of
the
danger
,
since
it
is
not
in
man
's
power
to
*NL*
foresee
everything
and
avert
the
general
course
of
events
,
and
it
is
*NL*
therefore
better
to
disregard
what
is
painful
till
it
comes
,
and
to
*NL*
think
about
what
is
pleasant
.
In
solitude
a
man
generally
listens
to
the
*NL*
first
voice
,
but
in
society
to
the
second
.
So
it
was
now
with
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Moscow
.
It
was
long
since
people
had
been
as
gay
in
*NL*
Moscow
as
that
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostopchin
's
broadsheets
,
headed
by
woodcuts
of
a
drink
shop
,
a
potman
,
*NL*
and
a
Moscow
burgher
called
Karpushka
Chigirin
,
``
who
--
having
been
a
*NL*
militiaman
and
having
had
rather
too
much
at
the
pub
--
heard
that
*NL*
Napoleon
wished
to
come
to
Moscow
,
grew
angry
,
abused
the
French
in
very
*NL*
bad
language
,
came
out
of
the
drink
shop
,
and
,
under
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
eagle
,
began
to
address
the
assembled
people
,
''
were
read
and
discussed
,
*NL*
together
with
the
latest
of
Vasili
Lvovich
Pushkin
's
bouts
rimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
corner
room
at
the
club
,
members
gathered
to
read
these
*NL*
broadsheets
,
and
some
liked
the
way
Karpushka
jeered
at
the
French
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
They
will
swell
up
with
Russian
cabbage
,
burst
with
our
*NL*
buckwheat
porridge
,
and
choke
themselves
with
cabbage
soup
.
They
are
all
*NL*
dwarfs
and
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
of
them
with
a
hayfork
.
''
*NL*
Others
did
not
like
that
tone
and
said
it
was
stupid
and
vulgar
.
It
was
*NL*
said
that
Rostopchin
had
expelled
all
Frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
*NL*
from
Moscow
,
and
that
there
had
been
some
spies
and
agents
of
Napoleon
*NL*
among
them
;
but
this
was
told
chiefly
to
introduce
Rostopchin
's
witty
*NL*
remark
on
that
occasion
.
The
foreigners
were
deported
to
Nizhni
by
boat
,
*NL*
and
Rostopchin
had
said
to
them
in
French
:
``
Rentrez
en
vousmemes
;
entrez
*NL*
dans
la
barque
,
et
n'en
faites
pas
une
barque
de
Charon
.
''
*
There
was
*NL*
talk
of
all
the
government
offices
having
been
already
removed
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
to
this
Shinshin
's
witticism
was
added
--
that
for
that
alone
*NL*
Moscow
ought
to
be
grateful
to
Napoleon
.
It
was
said
that
Mamonov
's
*NL*
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
rubles
,
and
that
Bezukhov
*NL*
had
spent
even
more
on
his
,
but
that
the
best
thing
about
Bezukhov
's
*NL*
action
was
that
he
himself
was
going
to
don
a
uniform
and
ride
at
the
*NL*
head
of
his
regiment
without
charging
anything
for
the
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Think
it
over
;
get
into
the
barque
,
and
take
care
not
to
make
it
a
*NL*
barque
of
Charon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
spare
anyone
,
''
said
Julie
Drubetskaya
as
she
collected
and
*NL*
pressed
together
a
bunch
of
raveled
lint
with
her
thin
,
beringed
*NL*
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julie
was
preparing
to
leave
Moscow
next
day
and
was
giving
a
farewell
*NL*
soiree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bezukhov
est
ridicule
,
but
he
is
so
kind
and
good-natured
.
What
*NL*
pleasure
is
there
to
be
so
caustique
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
forfeit
!
''
cried
a
young
man
in
militia
uniform
whom
Julie
called
``
mon
*NL*
chevalier
,
''
and
who
was
going
with
her
to
Nizhni
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Julie
's
set
,
as
in
many
other
circles
in
Moscow
,
it
had
been
agreed
*NL*
that
they
would
speak
nothing
but
Russian
and
that
those
who
made
a
slip
*NL*
and
spoke
French
should
pay
fines
to
the
Committee
of
Voluntary
*NL*
Contributions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
forfeit
for
a
Gallicism
,
''
said
a
Russian
writer
who
was
*NL*
present
.
''
`
What
pleasure
is
there
to
be
'
is
not
Russian
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spare
no
one
,
''
continued
Julie
to
the
young
man
without
heeding
the
*NL*
author
's
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
caustique
--
I
am
guilty
and
will
pay

pleasure
of
telling
you
the
truth

I
wo
n't
be
*NL*
responsible

she
remarked
,
turning
to
the
author
:
``
I
have
neither
the
*NL*
money

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

she
added
.
``
Quand

she
said
to
the
*NL*
militia
officer
,
``

Speak
of
the
sun
and

see
its
*NL*
rays

and
she
smiled
amiably
at
Pierre
.
``
We
were
just
talking
of
you
,
''
*NL*
she
said
with
the
facility
in
lying
natural
to
a
society
woman
.
``
We
were
*NL*
saying
that
your
regiment
would
be
sure
to
be
better
than
Mamonov
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
to
me
of
my
regiment
,
''
replied
Pierre
,
kissing
his
*NL*
hostess
'
hand
and
taking
a
seat
beside
her
.
``
I
am
so
sick
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
of
course
,
command
it
yourself

''
said
Julie
,
directing
a
sly
,
*NL*
sarcastic
glance
toward
the
militia
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
in
Pierre
's
presence
had
ceased
to
be
caustic
,
and
his
face
*NL*
expressed
perplexity
as
to
what
Julie
's
smile
might
mean
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
his
absent-mindedness
and
good
nature
,
Pierre
's
personality
immediately
*NL*
checked
any
attempt
to
ridicule
him
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Pierre
,
with
a
laughing
glance
at
his
big
,
stout
body
.
``
I
*NL*
should
make
too
good
a
target
for
the
French

besides
I
am
afraid

be
able
to
climb
onto
a
horse

*NL*
*NL*
Among
those
whom
Julie
's
guests
happened
to
choose
to
gossip
about
were
*NL*
the
Rostovs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
that
their
affairs

Julie
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

someone

``
If

Rostov

his
*NL*
feet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
Count
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
were
friendly
with
Natalie
,
and
so
...

I
was
always
more

friendly

that
dear
Vera

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

madame
!

Pierre
continued
in
a
tone
of
displeasure
,
``
I
have
not
*NL*
taken
on
myself
the
role
of
Natalie
Rostova

knight

all

not
been
to
their
house

nearly
a
month

I
can
not
understand
the
*NL*
cruelty

*NL*
*NL*
``

accuse

''
*
said
Julie
,
smiling
and
waving
the
lint
*NL*
triumphantly
,
and
to
have
the
last
word
she
promptly
changed
the
*NL*
subject
.
``
Do
you
know
what
I
heard
today
?
Poor
Mary
Bolkonskaya
arrived
*NL*
in
Moscow
yesterday

Do
you

that
she
has
lost
her
father
?

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Who
excuses
himself
,
accuses
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
Where
is
she
?
I
should
like
very
much
to
see
her

said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
spent
the
evening
with
her
yesterday

She

going

today

tomorrow

with
her
nephew

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
is
she

asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
well

but
sad

But
do
you
know
who
rescued
her

It
is
quite
a

romance

Nicholas
Rostov

She
was
surrounded
,
and
they
wanted
to
kill
*NL*
her
and
had
wounded
some
of
her
people

He
rushed
in

saved
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
romance

said
the
militia
officer
.
``
Really

this
general

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
returned
home
he
was
handed
two
of
Rostopchin
's
broadsheets
*NL*
that
had
been
brought
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
declared
that
the
report
that
Count
Rostopchin
had
forbidden
*NL*
people
to
leave
Moscow
was
false
;
on
the
contrary
he
was
glad
that
*NL*
ladies
and
tradesmen
's
wives
were
leaving
the
city
.
``
There
will
be
less
*NL*
panic
and
less
gossip
,
''
ran
the
broadsheet
``
but
I
will
stake
my
life
on
*NL*
it
that
scoundrel
will
not
enter
Moscow
.
''
These
words
showed
Pierre
*NL*
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
French
would
enter
Moscow
.
The
*NL*
second
broadsheet
stated
that
our
headquarters
were
at
Vyazma
,
that
*NL*
Count
Wittgenstein
had
defeated
the
French
,
but
that
as
many
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Moscow
wished
to
be
armed
,
weapons
were
ready
for
them
at
*NL*
the
arsenal
:
sabers
,
pistols
,
and
muskets
which
could
be
had
at
a
low
*NL*
price
.
The
tone
of
the
proclamation
was
not
as
jocose
as
in
the
former
*NL*
Chigirin
talks
.
Pierre
pondered
over
these
broadsheets
.
Evidently
the
*NL*
terrible
stormcloud
he
had
desired
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
soul
*NL*
but
which
yet
aroused
involuntary
horror
in
him
was
drawing
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
join
the
army
and
enter
the
service
,
or
wait
?
''
he
asked
himself
*NL*
for
the
hundredth
time
.
He
took
a
pack
of
cards
that
lay
on
the
table
*NL*
and
began
to
lay
them
out
for
a
game
of
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
patience
comes
out
,
''
he
said
to
himself
after
shuffling
the
*NL*
cards
,
holding
them
in
his
hand
,
and
lifting
his
head
,
``
if
it
comes
out
,
*NL*
it
means
...
what
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
decided
what
it
should
mean
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
eldest
princess
at
the
door
asking
whether
she
might
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
will
mean
that
I
must
go
to
the
army
,
''
said
Pierre
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
come
in
!
''
he
added
to
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
eldest
princess
,
the
one
with
the
stony
face
and
long
waist
,
*NL*
was
still
living
in
Pierre
's
house
.
The
two
younger
ones
had
both
*NL*
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
my
coming
to
you
,
cousin
,
''
she
said
in
a
reproachful
and
*NL*
agitated
voice
.
``
You
know
some
decision
must
be
come
to
.
What
is
going
*NL*
to
happen
?
Everyone
has
left
Moscow
and
the
people
are
rioting
.
How
is
*NL*
it
that
we
are
staying
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
things
seem
satisfactory
,
ma
cousine
,
''
said
Pierre
in
*NL*
the
bantering
tone
he
habitually
adopted
toward
her
,
always
feeling
*NL*
uncomfortable
in
the
role
of
her
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Satisfactory
,
indeed
!
Very
satisfactory
!
Barbara
Ivanovna
told
me
today
*NL*
how
our
troops
are
distinguishing
themselves
.
It
certainly
does
them
*NL*
credit
!
And
the
people
too
are
quite
mutinous
--
they
no
longer
obey
,
even
*NL*
my
maid
has
taken
to
being
rude
.
At
this
rate
they
will
soon
begin
*NL*
beating
us
.
One
ca
n't
walk
in
the
streets
.
But
,
above
all
,
the
French
*NL*
will
be
here
any
day
now
,
so
what
are
we
waiting
for
?
I
ask
just
one
*NL*
thing
of
you
,
cousin
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
arrange
for
me
to
be
taken
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Whatever
I
may
be
,
I
ca
n't
live
under
Bonaparte
's
rule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
ma
cousine
!
Where
do
you
get
your
information
from
?
On
the
*NL*
contrary
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
submit
to
your
Napoleon
!
Others
may
if
they
please
...
If
you
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
do
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
,
I
'll
give
the
order
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
was
apparently
vexed
at
not
having
anyone
to
be
angry
with
.
*NL*
Muttering
to
herself
,
she
sat
down
on
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
been
misinformed
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Everything
is
quiet
in
*NL*
the
city
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger
.
See
!
I
've
just
been
*NL*
reading
...
''
He
showed
her
the
broadsheet
.
``
Count
Rostopchin
writes
that
*NL*
he
will
stake
his
life
on
it
that
the
enemy
will
not
enter
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
count
of
yours
!
''
said
the
princess
malevolently
.
``
He
is
a
*NL*
hypocrite
,
a
rascal
who
has
himself
roused
the
people
to
riot
.
Did
n't
he
*NL*
write
in
those
idiotic
broadsheets
that
anyone
,
`
whoever
it
might
be
,
*NL*
should
be
dragged
to
the
lockup
by
his
hair
'
?
-LRB-
How
silly
!
-RRB-
`
And
honor
*NL*
and
glory
to
whoever
captures
him
,
'
he
says
.
This
is
what
his
cajolery
*NL*
has
brought
us
to
!
Barbara
Ivanovna
told
me
the
mob
near
killed
her
*NL*
because
she
said
something
in
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
it
's
so
...
You
take
everything
so
to
heart
,
''
said
Pierre
,
and
*NL*
began
laying
out
his
cards
for
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
that
patience
did
come
out
,
Pierre
did
not
join
the
army
,
but
*NL*
remained
in
deserted
Moscow
ever
in
the
same
state
of
agitation
,
*NL*
irresolution
,
and
alarm
,
yet
at
the
same
time
joyfully
expecting
*NL*
something
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
toward
evening
the
princess
set
off
,
and
Pierre
's
head
steward
*NL*
came
to
inform
him
that
the
money
needed
for
the
equipment
of
his
*NL*
regiment
could
not
be
found
without
selling
one
of
the
estates
.
In
*NL*
general
the
head
steward
made
out
to
Pierre
that
his
project
of
raising
*NL*
a
regiment
would
ruin
him
.
Pierre
listened
to
him
,
scarcely
able
to
*NL*
repress
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
sell
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
What
's
to
be
done
?
I
ca
n't
draw
back
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
worse
everything
became
,
especially
his
own
affairs
,
the
better
was
*NL*
Pierre
pleased
and
the
more
evident
was
it
that
the
catastrophe
he
*NL*
expected
was
approaching
.
Hardly
anyone
he
knew
was
left
in
town
.
Julie
*NL*
had
gone
,
and
so
had
Princess
Mary
.
Of
his
intimate
friends
only
the
*NL*
Rostovs
remained
,
but
he
did
not
go
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
distract
his
thoughts
he
drove
that
day
to
the
village
of
Vorontsovo
*NL*
to
see
the
great
balloon
Leppich
was
constructing
to
destroy
the
foe
,
*NL*
and
a
trial
balloon
that
was
to
go
up
next
day
.
The
balloon
was
not
yet
*NL*
ready
,
but
Pierre
learned
that
it
was
being
constructed
by
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
desire
.
The
Emperor
had
written
to
Count
Rostopchin
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Leppich
is
ready
,
get
together
a
crew
of
reliable
and
*NL*
intelligent
men
for
his
car
and
send
a
courier
to
General
Kutuzov
to
let
*NL*
him
know
.
I
have
informed
him
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Please
impress
upon
Leppich
to
be
very
careful
where
he
descends
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
that
he
may
not
make
a
mistake
and
fall
into
the
enemy
's
*NL*
hands
.
It
is
essential
for
him
to
combine
his
movements
with
those
of
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
home
from
Vorontsovo
,
as
he
was
passing
the
Bolotnoe
Place
*NL*
Pierre
,
seeing
a
large
crowd
round
the
Lobnoe
Place
,
stopped
and
got
out
*NL*
of
his
trap
.
A
French
cook
accused
of
being
a
spy
was
being
flogged
.
The
*NL*
flogging
was
only
just
over
,
and
the
executioner
was
releasing
from
the
*NL*
flogging
bench
a
stout
man
with
red
whiskers
,
in
blue
stockings
and
a
*NL*
green
jacket
,
who
was
moaning
piteously
.
Another
criminal
,
thin
and
*NL*
pale
,
stood
near
.
Judging
by
their
faces
they
were
both
Frenchmen
.
With
*NL*
a
frightened
and
suffering
look
resembling
that
on
the
thin
Frenchman
's
*NL*
face
,
Pierre
pushed
his
way
in
through
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
Who
is
it
?
What
is
it
for
?
''
he
kept
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
attention
of
the
crowd
--
officials
,
burghers
,
shopkeepers
,
*NL*
peasants
,
and
women
in
cloaks
and
in
pelisses
--
was
so
eagerly
centered
*NL*
on
what
was
passing
in
Lobnoe
Place
that
no
one
answered
him
.
The
stout
*NL*
man
rose
,
frowned
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
evidently
trying
to
*NL*
appear
firm
began
to
pull
on
his
jacket
without
looking
about
him
,
but
*NL*
suddenly
his
lips
trembled
and
he
began
to
cry
,
in
the
way
full-blooded
*NL*
grown-up
men
cry
,
though
angry
with
himself
for
doing
so
.
In
the
crowd
*NL*
people
began
talking
loudly
,
to
stifle
their
feelings
of
pity
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
cook
to
some
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
mounseer
,
Russian
sauce
seems
to
be
sour
to
a
Frenchman
...
sets
his
*NL*
teeth
on
edge
!
''
said
a
wrinkled
clerk
who
was
standing
behind
Pierre
,
*NL*
when
the
Frenchman
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
glanced
round
,
evidently
hoping
that
his
joke
would
be
*NL*
appreciated
.
Some
people
began
to
laugh
,
others
continued
to
watch
in
*NL*
dismay
the
executioner
who
was
undressing
the
other
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
choked
,
his
face
puckered
,
and
he
turned
hastily
away
,
went
back
*NL*
to
his
trap
muttering
something
to
himself
as
he
went
,
and
took
his
*NL*
seat
.
As
they
drove
along
he
shuddered
and
exclaimed
several
times
so
*NL*
audibly
that
the
coachman
asked
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
shouted
Pierre
to
the
man
,
who
was
driving
to
*NL*
Lubyanka
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Governor
's
,
as
you
ordered
,
''
answered
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fool
!
Idiot
!
''
shouted
Pierre
,
abusing
his
coachman
--
a
thing
he
rarely
*NL*
did
.
``
Home
,
I
told
you
!
And
drive
faster
,
blockhead
!
''
``
I
must
get
away
*NL*
this
very
day
,
''
he
murmured
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
the
tortured
Frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the
*NL*
Lobnoe
Place
,
Pierre
had
so
definitely
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
no
*NL*
longer
remain
in
Moscow
and
would
leave
for
the
army
that
very
day
that
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
either
he
had
told
the
coachman
this
or
that
the
*NL*
man
ought
to
have
known
it
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
Pierre
gave
orders
to
Evstafey
--
his
head
coachman
who
*NL*
knew
everything
,
could
do
anything
,
and
was
known
to
all
Moscow
--
that
he
*NL*
would
leave
that
night
for
the
army
at
Mozhaysk
,
and
that
his
saddle
*NL*
horses
should
be
sent
there
.
This
could
not
all
be
arranged
that
day
,
so
*NL*
on
Evstafey
's
representation
Pierre
had
to
put
off
his
departure
till
*NL*
next
day
to
allow
time
for
the
relay
horses
to
be
sent
on
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-fourth
the
weather
cleared
up
after
a
spell
of
rain
,
and
*NL*
after
dinner
Pierre
left
Moscow
.
When
changing
horses
that
night
in
*NL*
Perkhushkovo
,
he
learned
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
that
*NL*
evening
.
-LRB-
This
was
the
battle
of
Shevardino
.
-RRB-
He
was
told
that
there
in
*NL*
Perkhushkovo
the
earth
trembled
from
the
firing
,
but
nobody
could
answer
*NL*
his
questions
as
to
who
had
won
.
At
dawn
next
day
Pierre
was
approaching
*NL*
Mozhaysk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
house
in
Mozhaysk
had
soldiers
quartered
in
it
,
and
at
the
hostel
*NL*
where
Pierre
was
met
by
his
groom
and
coachman
there
was
no
room
to
be
*NL*
had
.
It
was
full
of
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
in
Mozhaysk
and
beyond
it
,
troops
were
stationed
or
on
the
*NL*
march
.
Cossacks
,
foot
and
horse
soldiers
,
wagons
,
caissons
,
and
cannon
*NL*
were
everywhere
.
Pierre
pushed
forward
as
fast
as
he
could
,
and
the
*NL*
farther
he
left
Moscow
behind
and
the
deeper
he
plunged
into
that
sea
of
*NL*
troops
the
more
was
he
overcome
by
restless
agitation
and
a
new
and
*NL*
joyful
feeling
he
had
not
experienced
before
.
It
was
a
feeling
akin
to
*NL*
what
he
had
felt
at
the
Sloboda
Palace
during
the
Emperor
's
visit
--
a
*NL*
sense
of
the
necessity
of
undertaking
something
and
sacrificing
*NL*
something
.
He
now
experienced
a
glad
consciousness
that
everything
that
*NL*
constitutes
men
's
happiness
--
the
comforts
of
life
,
wealth
,
even
life
*NL*
itself
--
is
rubbish
it
is
pleasant
to
throw
away
,
compared
with
*NL*
something
...
With
what
?
Pierre
could
not
say
,
and
he
did
not
try
to
*NL*
determine
for
whom
and
for
what
he
felt
such
particular
delight
in
*NL*
sacrificing
everything
.
He
was
not
occupied
with
the
question
of
what
to
*NL*
sacrifice
for
;
the
fact
of
sacrificing
in
itself
afforded
him
a
new
and
*NL*
joyous
sensation
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
the
battle
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
*NL*
fought
,
on
the
twenty-fifth
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
either
side
,
and
on
*NL*
the
twenty-sixth
the
battle
of
Borodino
itself
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
and
how
were
the
battles
of
Shevardino
and
Borodino
given
and
*NL*
accepted
?
Why
was
the
battle
of
Borodino
fought
?
There
was
not
the
least
*NL*
sense
in
it
for
either
the
French
or
the
Russians
.
Its
immediate
result
*NL*
for
the
Russians
was
,
and
was
bound
to
be
,
that
we
were
brought
nearer
*NL*
to
the
destruction
of
Moscow
--
which
we
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
for
the
French
its
immediate
result
was
that
they
were
*NL*
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
their
whole
army
--
which
they
feared
*NL*
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
What
the
result
must
be
was
quite
*NL*
obvious
,
and
yet
Napoleon
offered
and
Kutuzov
accepted
that
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
commanders
had
been
guided
by
reason
,
it
would
seem
that
it
must
*NL*
have
been
obvious
to
Napoleon
that
by
advancing
thirteen
hundred
miles
*NL*
and
giving
battle
with
a
probability
of
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
,
he
*NL*
was
advancing
to
certain
destruction
,
and
it
must
have
been
equally
*NL*
clear
to
Kutuzov
that
by
accepting
battle
and
risking
the
loss
of
a
*NL*
quarter
of
his
army
he
would
certainly
lose
Moscow
.
For
Kutuzov
this
was
*NL*
mathematically
clear
,
as
it
is
that
if
when
playing
draughts
I
have
one
*NL*
man
less
and
go
on
exchanging
,
I
shall
certainly
lose
,
and
therefore
*NL*
should
not
exchange
.
When
my
opponent
has
sixteen
men
and
I
have
*NL*
fourteen
,
I
am
only
one
eighth
weaker
than
he
,
but
when
I
have
exchanged
*NL*
thirteen
more
men
he
will
be
three
times
as
strong
as
I
am
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
battle
of
Borodino
our
strength
in
proportion
to
the
French
*NL*
was
about
as
five
to
six
,
but
after
that
battle
it
was
little
more
than
*NL*
one
to
two
:
previously
we
had
a
hundred
thousand
against
a
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
thousand
;
afterwards
little
more
than
fifty
thousand
against
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
.
Yet
the
shrewd
and
experienced
Kutuzov
accepted
the
*NL*
battle
,
while
Napoleon
,
who
was
said
to
be
a
commander
of
genius
,
gave
*NL*
it
,
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
and
lengthening
his
lines
of
*NL*
communication
still
more
.
If
it
is
said
that
he
expected
to
end
the
*NL*
campaign
by
occupying
Moscow
as
he
had
ended
a
previous
campaign
by
*NL*
occupying
Vienna
,
there
is
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
.
Napoleon
's
*NL*
historians
themselves
tell
us
that
from
Smolensk
onwards
he
wished
to
*NL*
stop
,
knew
the
danger
of
his
extended
position
,
and
knew
that
the
*NL*
occupation
of
Moscow
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
campaign
,
for
he
had
*NL*
seen
at
Smolensk
the
state
in
which
Russian
towns
were
left
to
him
,
and
*NL*
had
not
received
a
single
reply
to
his
repeated
announcements
of
his
*NL*
wish
to
negotiate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
giving
and
accepting
battle
at
Borodino
,
Kutuzov
acted
involuntarily
*NL*
and
irrationally
.
But
later
on
,
to
fit
what
had
occurred
,
the
historians
*NL*
provided
cunningly
devised
evidence
of
the
foresight
and
genius
of
the
*NL*
generals
who
,
of
all
the
blind
tools
of
history
were
the
most
enslaved
*NL*
and
involuntary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ancients
have
left
us
model
heroic
poems
in
which
the
heroes
furnish
*NL*
the
whole
interest
of
the
story
,
and
we
are
still
unable
to
accustom
*NL*
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
for
our
epoch
histories
of
that
kind
are
*NL*
meaningless
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
question
,
how
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
the
preceding
*NL*
battle
of
Shevardino
were
fought
,
there
also
exists
a
definite
and
well
-
*NL*
known
,
but
quite
false
,
conception
.
All
the
historians
describe
the
*NL*
affair
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
army
,
they
say
,
in
its
retreat
from
Smolensk
sought
out
for
*NL*
itself
the
best
position
for
a
general
engagement
and
found
such
a
*NL*
position
at
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
,
they
say
,
fortified
this
position
in
advance
on
the
left
*NL*
of
the
highroad
-LRB-
from
Moscow
to
Smolensk
-RRB-
and
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
*NL*
it
,
from
Borodino
to
Utitsa
,
at
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
*NL*
fought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
this
position
,
they
say
,
a
fortified
outpost
was
set
up
on
*NL*
the
Shevardino
mound
to
observe
the
enemy
.
On
the
twenty-fourth
,
we
are
*NL*
told
,
Napoleon
attacked
this
advanced
post
and
took
it
,
and
,
on
the
*NL*
twenty-sixth
,
attacked
the
whole
Russian
army
,
which
was
in
position
on
*NL*
the
field
of
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
histories
say
,
and
it
is
all
quite
wrong
,
as
anyone
who
cares
to
*NL*
look
into
the
matter
can
easily
convince
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
did
not
seek
out
the
best
position
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
during
the
retreat
passed
many
positions
better
than
Borodino
.
They
did
*NL*
not
stop
at
any
one
of
these
positions
because
Kutuzov
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
occupy
a
position
he
had
not
himself
chosen
,
because
the
popular
demand
*NL*
for
a
battle
had
not
yet
expressed
itself
strongly
enough
,
and
because
*NL*
Miloradovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
militia
,
and
for
many
other
*NL*
reasons
.
The
fact
is
that
other
positions
they
had
passed
were
stronger
,
*NL*
and
that
the
position
at
Borodino
-LRB-
the
one
where
the
battle
was
fought
-RRB-
,
*NL*
far
from
being
strong
,
was
no
more
a
position
than
any
other
spot
one
*NL*
might
find
in
the
Russian
Empire
by
sticking
a
pin
into
the
map
at
*NL*
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
did
the
Russians
not
fortify
the
position
on
the
field
of
*NL*
Borodino
to
the
left
of
,
and
at
a
right
angle
to
,
the
highroad
-LRB-
that
is
,
*NL*
the
position
on
which
the
battle
took
place
-RRB-
,
but
never
till
the
twenty
-
*NL*
fifth
of
August
,
1812
,
did
they
think
that
a
battle
might
be
fought
*NL*
there
.
This
was
shown
first
by
the
fact
that
there
were
no
entrenchments
*NL*
there
by
the
twenty
fifth
and
that
those
begun
on
the
twenty-fifth
and
*NL*
twenty-sixth
were
not
completed
,
and
secondly
,
by
the
position
of
the
*NL*
Shevardino
Redoubt
.
That
redoubt
was
quite
senseless
in
front
of
the
*NL*
position
where
the
battle
was
accepted
.
Why
was
it
more
strongly
*NL*
fortified
than
any
other
post
?
And
why
were
all
efforts
exhausted
and
*NL*
six
thousand
men
sacrificed
to
defend
it
till
late
at
night
on
the
*NL*
twenty-fourth
?
A
Cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
to
observe
the
*NL*
enemy
.
Thirdly
,
as
proof
that
the
position
on
which
the
battle
was
*NL*
fought
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
not
an
*NL*
advanced
post
of
that
position
,
we
have
the
fact
that
up
to
the
twenty
-
*NL*
fifth
,
Barclay
de
Tolly
and
Bagration
were
convinced
that
the
Shevardino
*NL*
Redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
the
position
,
and
that
Kutuzov
himself
in
*NL*
his
report
,
written
in
hot
haste
after
the
battle
,
speaks
of
the
*NL*
Shevardino
Redoubt
as
the
left
flank
of
the
position
.
It
was
much
later
,
*NL*
when
reports
on
the
battle
of
Borodino
were
written
at
leisure
,
that
the
*NL*
incorrect
and
extraordinary
statement
was
invented
-LRB-
probably
to
justify
*NL*
the
mistakes
of
a
commander-in-chief
who
had
to
be
represented
as
*NL*
infallible
-RRB-
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
an
advanced
post
--
whereas
in
*NL*
reality
it
was
simply
a
fortified
point
on
the
left
flank
--
and
that
the
*NL*
battle
of
Borodino
was
fought
by
us
on
an
entrenched
position
previously
*NL*
selected
,
where
as
it
was
fought
on
a
quite
unexpected
spot
which
was
*NL*
almost
unentrenched
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
evidently
this
:
a
position
was
selected
along
the
river
*NL*
Kolocha
--
which
crosses
the
highroad
not
at
a
right
angle
but
at
an
acute
*NL*
angle
--
so
that
the
left
flank
was
at
Shevardino
,
the
right
flank
near
*NL*
the
village
of
Novoe
,
and
the
center
at
Borodino
at
the
confluence
of
*NL*
the
rivers
Kolocha
and
Voyna
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
anyone
who
looks
at
the
field
of
Borodino
without
thinking
of
how
the
*NL*
battle
was
actually
fought
,
this
position
,
protected
by
the
river
*NL*
Kolocha
,
presents
itself
as
obvious
for
an
army
whose
object
was
to
*NL*
prevent
an
enemy
from
advancing
along
the
Smolensk
road
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
riding
to
Valuevo
on
the
twenty-fourth
,
did
not
see
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
history
books
say
he
did
-RRB-
the
position
of
the
Russians
from
Utitsa
to
*NL*
Borodino
-LRB-
he
could
not
have
seen
that
position
because
it
did
not
*NL*
exist
-RRB-
,
nor
did
he
see
an
advanced
post
of
the
Russian
army
,
but
while
*NL*
pursuing
the
Russian
rearguard
he
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
the
*NL*
Russian
position
--
at
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
--
and
unexpectedly
for
the
*NL*
Russians
moved
his
army
across
the
Kolocha
.
And
the
Russians
,
not
having
*NL*
time
to
begin
a
general
engagement
,
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
*NL*
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
and
took
up
a
new
position
which
*NL*
had
not
been
foreseen
and
was
not
fortified
.
By
crossing
to
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
Kolocha
to
the
left
of
the
highroad
,
Napoleon
shifted
the
*NL*
whole
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left
-LRB-
looking
from
the
Russian
*NL*
side
-RRB-
and
transferred
it
to
the
plain
between
Utitsa
,
Semenovsk
,
and
*NL*
Borodino
--
a
plain
no
more
advantageous
as
a
position
than
any
other
*NL*
plain
in
Russia
--
and
there
the
whole
battle
of
the
twenty-sixth
of
*NL*
August
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Napoleon
not
ridden
out
on
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fourth
to
the
*NL*
Kolocha
,
and
had
he
not
then
ordered
an
immediate
attack
on
the
redoubt
*NL*
but
had
begun
the
attack
next
morning
,
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
*NL*
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
our
position
,
and
the
*NL*
battle
would
have
taken
place
where
we
expected
it
.
In
that
case
we
*NL*
should
probably
have
defended
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
--
our
left
flank
--
*NL*
still
more
obstinately
.
We
should
have
attacked
Napoleon
in
the
center
*NL*
or
on
the
right
,
and
the
engagement
would
have
taken
place
on
the
*NL*
twenty-fifth
,
in
the
position
we
intended
and
had
fortified
.
But
as
the
*NL*
attack
on
our
left
flank
took
place
in
the
evening
after
the
retreat
of
*NL*
our
rear
guard
-LRB-
that
is
,
immediately
after
the
fight
at
Gridneva
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
as
the
Russian
commanders
did
not
wish
,
or
were
not
in
time
,
to
begin
a
*NL*
general
engagement
then
on
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fourth
,
the
first
*NL*
and
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
already
lost
on
the
*NL*
twenty-fourth
,
and
obviously
led
to
the
loss
of
the
one
fought
on
the
*NL*
twenty-sixth
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
loss
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
,
we
found
ourselves
on
the
*NL*
morning
of
the
twenty-fifth
without
a
position
for
our
left
flank
,
and
*NL*
were
forced
to
bend
it
back
and
hastily
entrench
it
where
it
chanced
to
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
was
the
Russian
army
on
the
twenty-sixth
defended
by
weak
,
*NL*
unfinished
entrenchments
,
but
the
disadvantage
of
that
position
was
*NL*
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
Russian
commanders
--
not
having
fully
*NL*
realized
what
had
happened
,
namely
the
loss
of
our
position
on
the
left
*NL*
flank
and
the
shifting
of
the
whole
field
of
the
forthcoming
battle
from
*NL*
right
to
left
--
maintained
their
extended
position
from
the
village
of
*NL*
Novoe
to
Utitsa
,
and
consequently
had
to
move
their
forces
from
right
to
*NL*
left
during
the
battle
.
So
it
happened
that
throughout
the
whole
battle
*NL*
the
Russians
opposed
the
entire
French
army
launched
against
our
left
*NL*
flank
with
but
half
as
many
men
.
-LRB-
Poniatowski
's
action
against
Utitsa
,
*NL*
and
Uvarov
's
on
the
right
flank
against
the
French
,
were
actions
*NL*
distinct
from
the
main
course
of
the
battle
.
-RRB-
So
the
battle
of
Borodino
*NL*
did
not
take
place
at
all
as
-LRB-
in
an
effort
to
conceal
our
commanders
'
*NL*
mistakes
even
at
the
cost
of
diminishing
the
glory
due
to
the
Russian
*NL*
army
and
people
-RRB-
it
has
been
described
.
The
battle
of
Borodino
was
not
*NL*
fought
on
a
chosen
and
entrenched
position
with
forces
only
slightly
*NL*
weaker
than
those
of
the
enemy
,
but
,
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
the
*NL*
Shevardino
Redoubt
,
the
Russians
fought
the
battle
of
Borodino
on
an
*NL*
open
and
almost
unentrenched
position
,
with
forces
only
half
as
numerous
*NL*
as
the
French
;
that
is
to
say
,
under
conditions
in
which
it
was
not
*NL*
merely
unthinkable
to
fight
for
ten
hours
and
secure
an
indecisive
*NL*
result
,
but
unthinkable
to
keep
an
army
even
from
complete
*NL*
disintegration
and
flight
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
twenty-fifth
Pierre
was
leaving
Mozhaysk
.
At
the
*NL*
descent
of
the
high
steep
hill
,
down
which
a
winding
road
led
out
of
the
*NL*
town
past
the
cathedral
on
the
right
,
where
a
service
was
being
held
and
*NL*
the
bells
were
ringing
,
Pierre
got
out
of
his
vehicle
and
proceeded
on
*NL*
foot
.
Behind
him
a
cavalry
regiment
was
coming
down
the
hill
preceded
by
*NL*
its
singers
.
Coming
up
toward
him
was
a
train
of
carts
carrying
men
who
*NL*
had
been
wounded
in
the
engagement
the
day
before
.
The
peasant
drivers
,
*NL*
shouting
and
lashing
their
horses
,
kept
crossing
from
side
to
side
.
The
*NL*
carts
,
in
each
of
which
three
or
four
wounded
soldiers
were
lying
or
*NL*
sitting
,
jolted
over
the
stones
that
had
been
thrown
on
the
steep
*NL*
incline
to
make
it
something
like
a
road
.
The
wounded
,
bandaged
with
*NL*
rags
,
with
pale
cheeks
,
compressed
lips
,
and
knitted
brows
,
held
on
to
*NL*
the
sides
of
the
carts
as
they
were
jolted
against
one
another
.
Almost
*NL*
all
of
them
stared
with
naive
,
childlike
curiosity
at
Pierre
's
white
hat
*NL*
and
green
swallow-tail
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
coachman
shouted
angrily
at
the
convoy
of
wounded
to
keep
to
*NL*
one
side
of
the
road
.
The
cavalry
regiment
,
as
it
descended
the
hill
*NL*
with
its
singers
,
surrounded
Pierre
's
carriage
and
blocked
the
road
.
*NL*
Pierre
stopped
,
being
pressed
against
the
side
of
the
cutting
in
which
*NL*
the
road
ran
.
The
sunshine
from
behind
the
hill
did
not
penetrate
into
*NL*
the
cutting
and
there
it
was
cold
and
damp
,
but
above
Pierre
's
head
was
*NL*
the
bright
August
sunshine
and
the
bells
sounded
merrily
.
One
of
the
*NL*
carts
with
wounded
stopped
by
the
side
of
the
road
close
to
Pierre
.
The
*NL*
driver
in
his
bast
shoes
ran
panting
up
to
it
,
placed
a
stone
under
one
*NL*
of
its
tireless
hind
wheels
,
and
began
arranging
the
breech-band
on
his
*NL*
little
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
wounded
,
an
old
soldier
with
a
bandaged
arm
who
was
following
*NL*
the
cart
on
foot
,
caught
hold
of
it
with
his
sound
hand
and
turned
to
*NL*
look
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
fellow
countryman
!
Will
they
set
us
down
here
or
take
us
on
to
*NL*
Moscow
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
so
deep
in
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
the
question
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
now
at
the
cavalry
regiment
that
had
met
the
convoy
of
wounded
,
*NL*
now
at
the
cart
by
which
he
was
standing
,
in
which
two
wounded
men
were
*NL*
sitting
and
one
was
lying
.
One
of
those
sitting
up
in
the
cart
had
*NL*
probably
been
wounded
in
the
cheek
.
His
whole
head
was
wrapped
in
rags
*NL*
and
one
cheek
was
swollen
to
the
size
of
a
baby
's
head
.
His
nose
and
*NL*
mouth
were
twisted
to
one
side
.
This
soldier
was
looking
at
the
*NL*
cathedral
and
crossing
himself
.
Another
,
a
young
lad
,
a
fair-haired
*NL*
recruit
as
white
as
though
there
was
no
blood
in
his
thin
face
,
looked
*NL*
at
Pierre
kindly
,
with
a
fixed
smile
.
The
third
lay
prone
so
that
his
*NL*
face
was
not
visible
.
The
cavalry
singers
were
passing
close
by
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
lost
,
quite
lost
...
is
my
head
so
keen
,
Living
in
a
foreign
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
they
sang
their
soldiers
'
dance
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
responding
to
them
but
with
a
different
sort
of
merriment
,
the
*NL*
metallic
sound
of
the
bells
reverberated
high
above
and
the
hot
rays
of
*NL*
the
sun
bathed
the
top
of
the
opposite
slope
with
yet
another
sort
of
*NL*
merriment
.
But
beneath
the
slope
,
by
the
cart
with
the
wounded
near
the
*NL*
panting
little
nag
where
Pierre
stood
,
it
was
damp
,
somber
,
and
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
with
the
swollen
cheek
looked
angrily
at
the
cavalry
*NL*
singers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
coxcombs
!
''
he
muttered
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
soldiers
only
,
but
I
've
seen
peasants
today
,
too
...
The
*NL*
peasants
--
even
they
have
to
go
,
''
said
the
soldier
behind
the
cart
,
*NL*
addressing
Pierre
with
a
sad
smile
.
``
No
distinctions
made
nowadays
...
*NL*
They
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them
--
in
a
word
,
it
's
Moscow
!
They
*NL*
want
to
make
an
end
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
obscurity
of
the
soldier
's
words
Pierre
understood
what
*NL*
he
wanted
to
say
and
nodded
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
was
clear
again
;
Pierre
descended
the
hill
and
drove
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
looking
to
either
side
of
the
road
for
familiar
faces
,
but
only
*NL*
saw
everywhere
the
unfamiliar
faces
of
various
military
men
of
different
*NL*
branches
of
the
service
,
who
all
looked
with
astonishment
at
his
white
*NL*
hat
and
green
tail
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
gone
nearly
three
miles
he
at
last
met
an
acquaintance
and
*NL*
eagerly
addressed
him
.
This
was
one
of
the
head
army
doctors
.
He
was
*NL*
driving
toward
Pierre
in
a
covered
gig
,
sitting
beside
a
young
surgeon
,
*NL*
and
on
recognizing
Pierre
he
told
the
Cossack
who
occupied
the
driver
's
*NL*
seat
to
pull
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
!
Your
excellency
,
how
come
you
to
be
here
?
''
asked
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
I
wanted
to
see
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
there
will
be
something
to
see
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
got
out
and
talked
to
the
doctor
,
explaining
his
intention
of
*NL*
taking
part
in
a
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
advised
him
to
apply
direct
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
God
knows
where
out
of
sight
,
during
the
battle
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
exchanging
glances
with
his
young
companion
.
``
Anyhow
his
Serene
*NL*
Highness
knows
you
and
will
receive
you
graciously
.
That
's
what
you
must
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
seemed
tired
and
in
a
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
?
...
Ah
,
I
also
wanted
to
ask
you
where
our
position
is
*NL*
exactly
?
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
position
?
''
repeated
the
doctor
.
``
Well
,
that
's
not
my
line
.
Drive
*NL*
past
Tatarinova
,
a
lot
of
digging
is
going
on
there
.
Go
up
the
hillock
*NL*
and
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
one
see
from
there
?
...
If
you
would
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
moved
toward
his
gig
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
go
with
you
but
on
my
honor
I
'm
up
to
here
''
--
and
he
pointed
to
*NL*
his
throat
.
``
I
'm
galloping
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
.
How
do
matters
*NL*
stand
?
...
You
know
,
Count
,
there
'll
be
a
battle
tomorrow
.
Out
of
an
army
*NL*
of
a
hundred
thousand
we
must
expect
at
least
twenty
thousand
wounded
,
*NL*
and
we
have
n't
stretchers
,
or
bunks
,
or
dressers
,
or
doctors
enough
for
*NL*
six
thousand
.
We
have
ten
thousand
carts
,
but
we
need
other
things
as
*NL*
well
--
we
must
manage
as
best
we
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
thought
that
of
the
thousands
of
men
,
young
and
old
,
who
had
*NL*
stared
with
merry
surprise
at
his
hat
-LRB-
perhaps
the
very
men
he
had
*NL*
noticed
-RRB-
,
twenty
thousand
were
inevitably
doomed
to
wounds
and
death
*NL*
amazed
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
die
tomorrow
;
why
are
they
thinking
of
anything
but
death
?
''
*NL*
And
by
some
latent
sequence
of
thought
the
descent
of
the
Mozhaysk
hill
,
*NL*
the
carts
with
the
wounded
,
the
ringing
bells
,
the
slanting
rays
of
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
the
songs
of
the
cavalrymen
vividly
recurred
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cavalry
ride
to
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
do
not
for
a
moment
*NL*
think
of
what
awaits
them
,
but
pass
by
,
winking
at
the
wounded
.
Yet
from
*NL*
among
these
men
twenty
thousand
are
doomed
to
die
,
and
they
wonder
at
my
*NL*
hat
!
Strange
!
''
thought
Pierre
,
continuing
his
way
to
Tatarinova
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
a
landowner
's
house
to
the
left
of
the
road
stood
carriages
,
*NL*
wagons
,
and
crowds
of
orderlies
and
sentinels
.
The
commander-in-chief
*NL*
was
putting
up
there
,
but
just
when
Pierre
arrived
he
was
not
in
and
*NL*
hardly
any
of
the
staff
were
there
--
they
had
gone
to
the
church
service
.
*NL*
Pierre
drove
on
toward
Gorki
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
ascended
the
hill
and
reached
the
little
village
street
,
he
*NL*
saw
for
the
first
time
peasant
militiamen
in
their
white
shirts
and
with
*NL*
crosses
on
their
caps
,
who
,
talking
and
laughing
loudly
,
animated
and
*NL*
perspiring
,
were
at
work
on
a
huge
knoll
overgrown
with
grass
to
the
*NL*
right
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
them
were
digging
,
others
were
wheeling
barrowloads
of
earth
*NL*
along
planks
,
while
others
stood
about
doing
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
officers
were
standing
on
the
knoll
,
directing
the
men
.
On
seeing
*NL*
these
peasants
,
who
were
evidently
still
amused
by
the
novelty
of
their
*NL*
position
as
soldiers
,
Pierre
once
more
thought
of
the
wounded
men
at
*NL*
Mozhaysk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
when
he
said
:
``
They
*NL*
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them
.
''
The
sight
of
these
bearded
*NL*
peasants
at
work
on
the
battlefield
,
with
their
queer
,
clumsy
boots
and
*NL*
perspiring
necks
,
and
their
shirts
opening
from
the
left
toward
the
*NL*
middle
,
unfastened
,
exposing
their
sunburned
collarbones
,
impressed
*NL*
Pierre
more
strongly
with
the
solemnity
and
importance
of
the
moment
*NL*
than
anything
he
had
yet
seen
or
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
stepped
out
of
his
carriage
and
,
passing
the
toiling
militiamen
,
*NL*
ascended
the
knoll
from
which
,
according
to
the
doctor
,
the
battlefield
*NL*
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
eleven
o'clock
.
The
sun
shone
somewhat
to
the
left
and
*NL*
behind
him
and
brightly
lit
up
the
enormous
panorama
which
,
rising
like
*NL*
an
amphitheater
,
extended
before
him
in
the
clear
rarefied
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
above
on
the
left
,
bisecting
that
amphitheater
,
wound
the
Smolensk
*NL*
highroad
,
passing
through
a
village
with
a
white
church
some
five
*NL*
hundred
paces
in
front
of
the
knoll
and
below
it
.
This
was
Borodino
.
*NL*
Below
the
village
the
road
crossed
the
river
by
a
bridge
and
,
winding
*NL*
down
and
up
,
rose
higher
and
higher
to
the
village
of
Valuevo
visible
*NL*
about
four
miles
away
,
where
Napoleon
was
then
stationed
.
Beyond
Valuevo
*NL*
the
road
disappeared
into
a
yellowing
forest
on
the
horizon
.
Far
in
the
*NL*
distance
in
that
birch
and
fir
forest
to
the
right
of
the
road
,
the
*NL*
cross
and
belfry
of
the
Kolocha
Monastery
gleamed
in
the
sun
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
over
the
whole
of
that
blue
expanse
,
to
right
and
left
of
the
*NL*
forest
and
the
road
,
smoking
campfires
could
be
seen
and
indefinite
*NL*
masses
of
troops
--
ours
and
the
enemy
's
.
The
ground
to
the
right
--
along
*NL*
the
course
of
the
Kolocha
and
Moskva
rivers
--
was
broken
and
hilly
.
*NL*
Between
the
hollows
the
villages
of
Bezubova
and
Zakharino
showed
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
On
the
left
the
ground
was
more
level
;
there
were
fields
of
*NL*
grain
,
and
the
smoking
ruins
of
Semenovsk
,
which
had
been
burned
down
,
*NL*
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
Pierre
saw
was
so
indefinite
that
neither
the
left
nor
the
*NL*
right
side
of
the
field
fully
satisfied
his
expectations
.
Nowhere
could
*NL*
he
see
the
battlefield
he
had
expected
to
find
,
but
only
fields
,
*NL*
meadows
,
troops
,
woods
,
the
smoke
of
campfires
,
villages
,
mounds
,
and
*NL*
streams
;
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
descry
no
military
``
position
''
in
*NL*
this
place
which
teemed
with
life
,
nor
could
he
even
distinguish
our
*NL*
troops
from
the
enemy
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
ask
someone
who
knows
,
''
he
thought
,
and
addressed
an
officer
who
*NL*
was
looking
with
curiosity
at
his
huge
unmilitary
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
you
,
''
said
Pierre
,
``
what
village
that
is
in
front
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burdino
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
the
officer
,
turning
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Borodino
,
''
the
other
corrected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
,
evidently
glad
of
an
opportunity
for
a
talk
,
moved
up
to
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
those
our
men
there
?
''
Pierre
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
there
,
further
on
,
are
the
French
,
''
said
the
officer
.
``
There
*NL*
they
are
,
there
...
you
can
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
Where
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
see
them
with
the
naked
eye
...
Why
,
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
smoke
visible
on
the
left
*NL*
beyond
the
river
,
and
the
same
stern
and
serious
expression
that
Pierre
*NL*
had
noticed
on
many
of
the
faces
he
had
met
came
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
those
are
the
French
!
And
over
there
?
...
''
Pierre
pointed
to
a
knoll
*NL*
on
the
left
,
near
which
some
troops
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ours
!
And
there
?
...
''
Pierre
pointed
to
another
knoll
in
the
*NL*
distance
with
a
big
tree
on
it
,
near
a
village
that
lay
in
a
hollow
*NL*
where
also
some
campfires
were
smoking
and
something
black
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
his
again
,
''
said
the
officer
.
-LRB-
It
was
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
.
-RRB-
*NL*
``
It
was
ours
yesterday
,
but
now
it
is
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
about
our
position
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
position
?
''
replied
the
officer
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
``
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
quite
clearly
,
because
I
constructed
nearly
all
our
*NL*
entrenchments
.
There
,
you
see
?
There
's
our
center
,
at
Borodino
,
just
*NL*
there
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
village
in
front
of
them
with
the
white
*NL*
church
.
``
That
's
where
one
crosses
the
Kolocha
.
You
see
down
there
where
*NL*
the
rows
of
hay
are
lying
in
the
hollow
,
there
's
the
bridge
.
That
's
our
*NL*
center
.
Our
right
flank
is
over
there
''
--
he
pointed
sharply
to
the
right
,
*NL*
far
away
in
the
broken
ground
--
``
That
's
where
the
Moskva
River
is
,
and
we
*NL*
have
thrown
up
three
redoubts
there
,
very
strong
ones
.
The
left
*NL*
flank
...
''
here
the
officer
paused
.
``
Well
,
you
see
,
that
's
difficult
to
*NL*
explain
...
Yesterday
our
left
flank
was
there
at
Shevardino
,
you
see
,
*NL*
where
the
oak
is
,
but
now
we
have
withdrawn
our
left
wing
--
now
it
is
*NL*
over
there
,
do
you
see
that
village
and
the
smoke
?
That
's
Semenovsk
,
*NL*
yes
,
there
,
''
he
pointed
to
Raevski
's
knoll
.
``
But
the
battle
will
hardly
*NL*
be
there
.
His
having
moved
his
troops
there
is
only
a
ruse
;
he
will
*NL*
probably
pass
round
to
the
right
of
the
Moskva
.
But
wherever
it
may
be
,
*NL*
many
a
man
will
be
missing
tomorrow
!
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
elderly
sergeant
who
had
approached
the
officer
while
he
was
giving
*NL*
these
explanations
had
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
finish
speaking
,
but
*NL*
at
this
point
,
evidently
not
liking
the
officer
's
remark
,
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabions
must
be
sent
for
,
''
said
he
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
appeared
abashed
,
as
though
he
understood
that
one
might
*NL*
think
of
how
many
men
would
be
missing
tomorrow
but
ought
not
to
speak
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
send
number
three
company
again
,
''
the
officer
replied
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
are
you
one
of
the
doctors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
come
on
my
own
,
''
answered
Pierre
,
and
he
went
down
the
hill
*NL*
again
,
passing
the
militiamen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
those
damned
fellows
!
''
muttered
the
officer
who
followed
him
,
*NL*
holding
his
nose
as
he
ran
past
the
men
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
they
are
...
bringing
her
,
coming
...
There
they
are
...
They
'll
be
*NL*
here
in
a
minute
...
''
voices
were
suddenly
heard
saying
;
and
officers
,
*NL*
soldiers
,
and
militiamen
began
running
forward
along
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
church
procession
was
coming
up
the
hill
from
Borodino
.
First
along
*NL*
the
dusty
road
came
the
infantry
in
ranks
,
bareheaded
and
with
arms
*NL*
reversed
.
From
behind
them
came
the
sound
of
church
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soldiers
and
militiamen
ran
bareheaded
past
Pierre
toward
the
*NL*
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
bringing
her
,
our
Protectress
!
...
The
Iberian
Mother
of
God
!
''
*NL*
someone
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Smolensk
Mother
of
God
,
''
another
corrected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
militiamen
,
both
those
who
had
been
in
the
village
and
those
who
had
*NL*
been
at
work
on
the
battery
,
threw
down
their
spades
and
ran
to
meet
the
*NL*
church
procession
.
Following
the
battalion
that
marched
along
the
dusty
*NL*
road
came
priests
in
their
vestments
--
one
little
old
man
in
a
hood
with
*NL*
attendants
and
singers
.
Behind
them
soldiers
and
officers
bore
a
large
,
*NL*
dark-faced
icon
with
an
embossed
metal
cover
.
This
was
the
icon
that
had
*NL*
been
brought
from
Smolensk
and
had
since
accompanied
the
army
.
Behind
,
*NL*
before
,
and
on
both
sides
,
crowds
of
militiamen
with
bared
heads
walked
,
*NL*
ran
,
and
bowed
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
summit
of
the
hill
they
stopped
with
the
icon
;
the
men
who
had
*NL*
been
holding
it
up
by
the
linen
bands
attached
to
it
were
relieved
by
*NL*
others
,
the
chanters
relit
their
censers
,
and
service
began
.
The
hot
*NL*
rays
of
the
sun
beat
down
vertically
and
a
fresh
soft
wind
played
with
*NL*
the
hair
of
the
bared
heads
and
with
the
ribbons
decorating
the
icon
.
*NL*
The
singing
did
not
sound
loud
under
the
open
sky
.
An
immense
crowd
of
*NL*
bareheaded
officers
,
soldiers
,
and
militiamen
surrounded
the
icon
.
*NL*
Behind
the
priest
and
a
chanter
stood
the
notabilities
on
a
spot
*NL*
reserved
for
them
.
A
bald
general
with
a
St.
George
's
Cross
on
his
neck
*NL*
stood
just
behind
the
priest
's
back
,
and
without
crossing
himself
-LRB-
he
*NL*
was
evidently
a
German
-RRB-
patiently
awaited
the
end
of
the
service
,
which
*NL*
he
considered
it
necessary
to
hear
to
the
end
,
probably
to
arouse
the
*NL*
patriotism
of
the
Russian
people
.
Another
general
stood
in
a
martial
*NL*
pose
,
crossing
himself
by
shaking
his
hand
in
front
of
his
chest
while
*NL*
looking
about
him
.
Standing
among
the
crowd
of
peasants
,
Pierre
*NL*
recognized
several
acquaintances
among
these
notables
,
but
did
not
look
*NL*
at
them
--
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
serious
*NL*
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
of
soldiers
and
militiamen
who
were
*NL*
all
gazing
eagerly
at
the
icon
.
As
soon
as
the
tired
chanters
,
who
were
*NL*
singing
the
service
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
,
began
lazily
and
*NL*
mechanically
to
sing
:
``
Save
from
calamity
Thy
servants
,
O
Mother
of
*NL*
God
,
''
and
the
priest
and
deacon
chimed
in
:
``
For
to
Thee
under
God
we
all
*NL*
flee
as
to
an
inviolable
bulwark
and
protection
,
''
there
again
kindled
in
*NL*
all
those
faces
the
same
expression
of
consciousness
of
the
solemnity
of
*NL*
the
impending
moment
that
Pierre
had
seen
on
the
faces
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
hill
at
Mozhaysk
and
momentarily
on
many
and
many
faces
he
had
met
*NL*
that
morning
;
and
heads
were
bowed
more
frequently
and
hair
tossed
back
,
*NL*
and
sighs
and
the
sound
men
made
as
they
crossed
themselves
were
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
round
the
icon
suddenly
parted
and
pressed
against
Pierre
.
*NL*
Someone
,
a
very
important
personage
judging
by
the
haste
with
which
way
*NL*
was
made
for
him
,
was
approaching
the
icon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Kutuzov
,
who
had
been
riding
round
the
position
and
on
his
way
*NL*
back
to
Tatarinova
had
stopped
where
the
service
was
being
held
.
Pierre
*NL*
recognized
him
at
once
by
his
peculiar
figure
,
which
distinguished
him
*NL*
from
everybody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
long
overcoat
on
his
exceedingly
stout
,
round-shouldered
body
,
*NL*
with
uncovered
white
head
and
puffy
face
showing
the
white
ball
of
the
*NL*
eye
he
had
lost
,
Kutuzov
walked
with
plunging
,
swaying
gait
into
the
*NL*
crowd
and
stopped
behind
the
priest
.
He
crossed
himself
with
an
*NL*
accustomed
movement
,
bent
till
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
bowed
his
white
head
with
a
deep
sigh
.
Behind
Kutuzov
was
Bennigsen
and
*NL*
the
suite
.
Despite
the
presence
of
the
commander-in-chief
,
who
attracted
*NL*
the
attention
of
all
the
superior
officers
,
the
militiamen
and
soldiers
*NL*
continued
their
prayers
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
service
was
over
,
Kutuzov
stepped
up
to
the
icon
,
sank
heavily
*NL*
to
his
knees
,
bowed
to
the
ground
,
and
for
a
long
time
tried
vainly
to
*NL*
rise
,
but
could
not
do
so
on
account
of
his
weakness
and
weight
.
His
*NL*
white
head
twitched
with
the
effort
.
At
last
he
rose
,
kissed
the
icon
as
*NL*
a
child
does
with
naively
pouting
lips
,
and
again
bowed
till
he
touched
*NL*
the
ground
with
his
hand
.
The
other
generals
followed
his
example
,
then
*NL*
the
officers
,
and
after
them
with
excited
faces
,
pressing
on
one
*NL*
another
,
crowding
,
panting
,
and
pushing
,
scrambled
the
soldiers
and
*NL*
militiamen
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Staggering
amid
the
crush
,
Pierre
looked
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Peter
Kirilovich
!
How
did
you
get
here
?
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
round
.
Boris
Drubetskoy
,
brushing
his
knees
with
his
hand
*NL*
-LRB-
he
had
probably
soiled
them
when
he
,
too
,
had
knelt
before
the
icon
-RRB-
,
*NL*
came
up
to
him
smiling
.
Boris
was
elegantly
dressed
,
with
a
slightly
*NL*
martial
touch
appropriate
to
a
campaign
.
He
wore
a
long
coat
and
like
*NL*
Kutuzov
had
a
whip
slung
across
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Kutuzov
had
reached
the
village
and
seated
himself
in
the
*NL*
shade
of
the
nearest
house
,
on
a
bench
which
one
Cossack
had
run
to
*NL*
fetch
and
another
had
hastily
covered
with
a
rug
.
An
immense
and
*NL*
brilliant
suite
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
icon
was
carried
further
,
accompanied
by
the
throng
.
Pierre
stopped
*NL*
some
thirty
paces
from
Kutuzov
,
talking
to
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
explained
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
to
see
the
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
you
must
do
,
''
said
Boris
.
``
I
will
do
the
honors
of
the
*NL*
camp
to
you
.
You
will
see
everything
best
from
where
Count
Bennigsen
*NL*
will
be
.
I
am
in
attendance
on
him
,
you
know
;
I
'll
mention
it
to
him
.
*NL*
But
if
you
want
to
ride
round
the
position
,
come
along
with
us
.
We
are
*NL*
just
going
to
the
left
flank
.
Then
when
we
get
back
,
do
spend
the
night
*NL*
with
me
and
we
'll
arrange
a
game
of
cards
.
Of
course
you
know
Dmitri
*NL*
Sergeevich
?
Those
are
his
quarters
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
third
house
*NL*
in
the
village
of
Gorki
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
should
like
to
see
the
right
flank
.
They
say
it
's
very
strong
,
''
*NL*
said
Pierre
.
``
I
should
like
to
start
from
the
Moskva
River
and
ride
*NL*
round
the
whole
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
do
that
later
,
but
the
chief
thing
is
the
left
flank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
But
where
is
Prince
Bolkonski
's
regiment
?
Can
you
point
it
*NL*
out
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Andrew
's
?
We
shall
pass
it
and
I
'll
take
you
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
the
left
flank
?
''
asked
Pierre
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
between
ourselves
,
God
only
knows
what
state
our
*NL*
left
flank
is
in
,
''
said
Boris
confidentially
lowering
his
voice
.
``
It
is
*NL*
not
at
all
what
Count
Bennigsen
intended
.
He
meant
to
fortify
that
knoll
*NL*
quite
differently
,
but
...
''
Boris
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
``
his
Serene
*NL*
Highness
would
not
have
it
,
or
someone
persuaded
him
.
You
see
...
''
but
*NL*
Boris
did
not
finish
,
for
at
that
moment
Kaysarov
,
Kutuzov
's
adjutant
,
*NL*
came
up
to
Pierre
.
``
Ah
,
Kaysarov
!
''
said
Boris
,
addressing
him
with
an
*NL*
unembarrassed
smile
,
``
I
was
just
trying
to
explain
our
position
to
the
*NL*
count
.
It
is
amazing
how
his
Serene
Highness
could
so
foresee
the
*NL*
intentions
of
the
French
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
left
flank
?
''
asked
Kaysarov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
exactly
;
the
left
flank
is
now
extremely
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Kutuzov
had
dismissed
all
unnecessary
men
from
the
staff
,
Boris
*NL*
had
contrived
to
remain
at
headquarters
after
the
changes
.
He
had
*NL*
established
himself
with
Count
Bennigsen
,
who
,
like
all
on
whom
Boris
*NL*
had
been
in
attendance
,
considered
young
Prince
Drubetskoy
an
invaluable
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
higher
command
there
were
two
sharply
defined
parties
:
Kutuzov
's
*NL*
party
and
that
of
Bennigsen
,
the
chief
of
staff
.
Boris
belonged
to
the
*NL*
latter
and
no
one
else
,
while
showing
servile
respect
to
Kutuzov
,
could
*NL*
so
create
an
impression
that
the
old
fellow
was
not
much
good
and
that
*NL*
Bennigsen
managed
everything
.
Now
the
decisive
moment
of
battle
had
come
*NL*
when
Kutuzov
would
be
destroyed
and
the
power
pass
to
Bennigsen
,
or
even
*NL*
if
Kutuzov
won
the
battle
it
would
be
felt
that
everything
was
done
by
*NL*
Bennigsen
.
In
any
case
many
great
rewards
would
have
to
be
given
for
*NL*
tomorrow
's
action
,
and
new
men
would
come
to
the
front
.
So
Boris
was
*NL*
full
of
nervous
vivacity
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Kaysarov
,
others
whom
Pierre
knew
came
up
to
him
,
and
he
had
not
*NL*
time
to
reply
to
all
the
questions
about
Moscow
that
were
showered
upon
*NL*
him
,
or
to
listen
to
all
that
was
told
him
.
The
faces
all
expressed
*NL*
animation
and
apprehension
,
but
it
seemed
to
Pierre
that
the
cause
of
*NL*
the
excitement
shown
in
some
of
these
faces
lay
chiefly
in
questions
of
*NL*
personal
success
;
his
mind
,
however
,
was
occupied
by
the
different
*NL*
expression
he
saw
on
other
faces
--
an
expression
that
spoke
not
of
*NL*
personal
matters
but
of
the
universal
questions
of
life
and
death
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
noticed
Pierre
's
figure
and
the
group
gathered
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
him
to
me
,
''
said
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
adjutant
told
Pierre
of
his
Serene
Highness
'
wish
,
and
Pierre
went
*NL*
toward
Kutuzov
's
bench
.
But
a
militiaman
got
there
before
him
.
It
was
*NL*
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
that
fellow
get
here
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
creature
that
wriggles
in
anywhere
!
''
was
the
answer
.
``
He
has
*NL*
been
degraded
,
you
know
.
Now
he
wants
to
bob
up
again
.
He
's
been
*NL*
proposing
some
scheme
or
other
and
has
crawled
into
the
enemy
's
picket
*NL*
line
at
night
...
He
's
a
brave
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
respectfully
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
concluded
that
if
I
reported
to
your
Serene
Highness
you
might
send
*NL*
me
away
or
say
that
you
knew
what
I
was
reporting
,
but
then
I
should
n't
*NL*
lose
anything
...
''
Dolokhov
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
were
right
,
I
should
be
rendering
a
service
to
my
Fatherland
*NL*
for
which
I
am
ready
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
should
your
Serene
Highness
require
a
man
who
will
not
spare
his
*NL*
skin
,
please
think
of
me
...
Perhaps
I
may
prove
useful
to
your
Serene
*NL*
Highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
Yes
...
''
Kutuzov
repeated
,
his
laughing
eye
narrowing
more
and
*NL*
more
as
he
looked
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Boris
,
with
his
courtierlike
adroitness
,
stepped
up
to
*NL*
Pierre
's
side
near
Kutuzov
and
in
a
most
natural
manner
,
without
raising
*NL*
his
voice
,
said
to
Pierre
,
as
though
continuing
an
interrupted
*NL*
conversation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
militia
have
put
on
clean
white
shirts
to
be
ready
to
die
.
What
*NL*
heroism
,
Count
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
evidently
said
this
to
Pierre
in
order
to
be
overheard
by
his
*NL*
Serene
Highness
.
He
knew
Kutuzov
's
attention
would
be
caught
by
those
*NL*
words
,
and
so
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
saying
about
the
militia
?
''
he
asked
Boris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Preparing
for
tomorrow
,
your
Serene
Highness
--
for
death
--
they
have
put
*NL*
on
clean
shirts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
...
a
wonderful
,
a
matchless
people
!
''
said
Kutuzov
;
and
he
closed
his
*NL*
eyes
and
swayed
his
head
.
``
A
matchless
people
!
''
he
repeated
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
want
to
smell
gunpowder
?
''
he
said
to
Pierre
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
*NL*
pleasant
smell
.
I
have
the
honor
to
be
one
of
your
wife
's
adorers
.
Is
*NL*
she
well
?
My
quarters
are
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
often
happens
with
old
people
,
Kutuzov
began
looking
about
*NL*
absent-mindedly
as
if
forgetting
all
he
wanted
to
say
or
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
evidently
remembering
what
he
wanted
,
he
beckoned
to
Andrew
*NL*
Kaysarov
,
his
adjutant
's
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
verses
...
those
verses
of
Marin
's
...
how
do
they
go
,
eh
?
Those
he
*NL*
wrote
about
Gerakov
:
`
Lectures
for
the
corps
inditing
'
...
Recite
them
,
*NL*
recite
them
!
''
said
he
,
evidently
preparing
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kaysarov
recited
...
Kutuzov
smilingly
nodded
his
head
to
the
rhythm
of
*NL*
the
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
had
left
Kutuzov
,
Dolokhov
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
here
,
Count
,
''
he
said
aloud
,
regardless
of
*NL*
the
presence
of
strangers
and
in
a
particularly
resolute
and
solemn
*NL*
tone
.
``
On
the
eve
of
a
day
when
God
alone
knows
who
of
us
is
fated
to
*NL*
survive
,
I
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
tell
you
that
I
regret
the
*NL*
misunderstandings
that
occurred
between
us
and
should
wish
you
not
to
*NL*
have
any
ill
feeling
for
me
.
I
beg
you
to
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
Dolokhov
with
a
smile
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
him
.
*NL*
With
tears
in
his
eyes
Dolokhov
embraced
Pierre
and
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boris
said
a
few
words
to
his
general
,
and
Count
Bennigsen
turned
to
*NL*
Pierre
and
proposed
that
he
should
ride
with
him
along
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
interest
you
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
much
,
''
replied
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
Kutuzov
left
for
Tatarinova
,
and
Bennigsen
and
his
*NL*
suite
,
with
Pierre
among
them
,
set
out
on
their
ride
along
the
line
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
From
Gorki
,
Bennigsen
descended
the
highroad
to
the
bridge
which
,
when
*NL*
they
had
looked
at
it
from
the
hill
,
the
officer
had
pointed
out
as
*NL*
being
the
center
of
our
position
and
where
rows
of
fragrant
new-mown
hay
*NL*
lay
by
the
riverside
.
They
rode
across
that
bridge
into
the
village
of
*NL*
Borodino
and
thence
turned
to
the
left
,
passing
an
enormous
number
of
*NL*
troops
and
guns
,
and
came
to
a
high
knoll
where
militiamen
were
digging
.
*NL*
This
was
the
redoubt
,
as
yet
unnamed
,
which
afterwards
became
known
as
*NL*
the
Raevski
Redoubt
,
or
the
Knoll
Battery
,
but
Pierre
paid
no
special
*NL*
attention
to
it
.
He
did
not
know
that
it
would
become
more
memorable
to
*NL*
him
than
any
other
spot
on
the
plain
of
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
crossed
the
hollow
to
Semenovsk
,
where
the
soldiers
were
*NL*
dragging
away
the
last
logs
from
the
huts
and
barns
.
Then
they
rode
*NL*
downhill
and
uphill
,
across
a
ryefield
trodden
and
beaten
down
as
if
by
*NL*
hail
,
following
a
track
freshly
made
by
the
artillery
over
the
furrows
*NL*
of
the
plowed
land
,
and
reached
some
fleches
*
which
were
still
being
*NL*
dug
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
kind
of
entrenchment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
fleches
Bennigsen
stopped
and
began
looking
at
the
Shevardino
*NL*
Redoubt
opposite
,
which
had
been
ours
the
day
before
and
where
several
*NL*
horsemen
could
be
descried
.
The
officers
said
that
either
Napoleon
or
*NL*
Murat
was
there
,
and
they
all
gazed
eagerly
at
this
little
group
of
*NL*
horsemen
.
Pierre
also
looked
at
them
,
trying
to
guess
which
of
the
*NL*
scarcely
discernible
figures
was
Napoleon
.
At
last
those
mounted
men
*NL*
rode
away
from
the
mound
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bennigsen
spoke
to
a
general
who
approached
him
,
and
began
explaining
*NL*
the
whole
position
of
our
troops
.
Pierre
listened
to
him
,
straining
each
*NL*
faculty
to
understand
the
essential
points
of
the
impending
battle
,
but
*NL*
was
mortified
to
feel
that
his
mental
capacity
was
inadequate
for
the
*NL*
task
.
He
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
Bennigsen
stopped
speaking
and
,
*NL*
noticing
that
Pierre
was
listening
,
suddenly
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
this
interests
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
it
's
very
interesting
!
''
replied
Pierre
not
quite
*NL*
truthfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
fleches
they
rode
still
farther
to
the
left
,
along
a
road
*NL*
winding
through
a
thick
,
low-growing
birch
wood
.
In
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
wood
a
brown
hare
with
white
feet
sprang
out
and
,
scared
by
the
tramp
of
*NL*
the
many
horses
,
grew
so
confused
that
it
leaped
along
the
road
in
front
*NL*
of
them
for
some
time
,
arousing
general
attention
and
laughter
,
and
only
*NL*
when
several
voices
shouted
at
it
did
it
dart
to
one
side
and
disappear
*NL*
in
the
thicket
.
After
going
through
the
wood
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
*NL*
they
came
out
on
a
glade
where
troops
of
Tuchkov
's
corps
were
stationed
*NL*
to
defend
the
left
flank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
at
the
extreme
left
flank
,
Bennigsen
talked
a
great
deal
and
with
*NL*
much
heat
,
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
Pierre
,
gave
orders
of
great
military
*NL*
importance
.
In
front
of
Tuchkov
's
troops
was
some
high
ground
not
*NL*
occupied
by
troops
.
Bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
mistake
,
saying
*NL*
that
it
was
madness
to
leave
a
height
which
commanded
the
country
around
*NL*
unoccupied
and
to
place
troops
below
it
.
Some
of
the
generals
expressed
*NL*
the
same
opinion
.
One
in
particular
declared
with
martial
heat
that
they
*NL*
were
put
there
to
be
slaughtered
.
Bennigsen
on
his
own
authority
ordered
*NL*
the
troops
to
occupy
the
high
ground
.
This
disposition
on
the
left
flank
*NL*
increased
Pierre
's
doubt
of
his
own
capacity
to
understand
military
*NL*
matters
.
Listening
to
Bennigsen
and
the
generals
criticizing
the
*NL*
position
of
the
troops
behind
the
hill
,
he
quite
understood
them
and
*NL*
shared
their
opinion
,
but
for
that
very
reason
he
could
not
understand
*NL*
how
the
man
who
put
them
there
behind
the
hill
could
have
made
so
gross
*NL*
and
palpable
a
blunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
were
not
,
as
Bennigsen
supposed
,
*NL*
put
there
to
defend
the
position
,
but
were
in
a
concealed
position
as
an
*NL*
ambush
,
that
they
should
not
be
seen
and
might
be
able
to
strike
an
*NL*
approaching
enemy
unexpectedly
.
Bennigsen
did
not
know
this
and
moved
*NL*
the
troops
forward
according
to
his
own
ideas
without
mentioning
the
*NL*
matter
to
the
commander-in-chief
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
bright
evening
of
August
25
,
Prince
Andrew
lay
leaning
on
his
*NL*
elbow
in
a
broken-down
shed
in
the
village
of
Knyazkovo
at
the
further
*NL*
end
of
his
regiment
's
encampment
.
Through
a
gap
in
the
broken
wall
he
*NL*
could
see
,
beside
the
wooden
fence
,
a
row
of
thirty
year-old
birches
*NL*
with
their
lower
branches
lopped
off
,
a
field
on
which
shocks
of
oats
*NL*
were
standing
,
and
some
bushes
near
which
rose
the
smoke
of
campfires
--
*NL*
the
soldiers
'
kitchens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Narrow
and
burdensome
and
useless
to
anyone
as
his
life
now
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
Prince
Andrew
on
the
eve
of
battle
felt
agitated
and
irritable
as
*NL*
he
had
done
seven
years
before
at
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
received
and
given
the
orders
for
next
day
's
battle
and
had
*NL*
nothing
more
to
do
.
But
his
thoughts
--
the
simplest
,
clearest
,
and
*NL*
therefore
most
terrible
thoughts
--
would
give
him
no
peace
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
tomorrow
's
battle
would
be
the
most
terrible
of
all
he
had
taken
part
*NL*
in
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
possibility
of
death
*NL*
presented
itself
to
him
--
not
in
relation
to
any
worldly
matter
or
with
*NL*
reference
to
its
effect
on
others
,
but
simply
in
relation
to
himself
,
to
*NL*
his
own
soul
--
vividly
,
plainly
,
terribly
,
and
almost
as
a
certainty
.
And
*NL*
from
the
height
of
this
perception
all
that
had
previously
tormented
and
*NL*
preoccupied
him
suddenly
became
illumined
by
a
cold
white
light
without
*NL*
shadows
,
without
perspective
,
without
distinction
of
outline
.
All
life
*NL*
appeared
to
him
like
magic-lantern
pictures
at
which
he
had
long
been
*NL*
gazing
by
artificial
light
through
a
glass
.
Now
he
suddenly
saw
those
*NL*
badly
daubed
pictures
in
clear
daylight
and
without
a
glass
.
``
Yes
,
yes
!
*NL*
There
they
are
,
those
false
images
that
agitated
,
enraptured
,
and
*NL*
tormented
me
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
passing
in
review
the
principal
*NL*
pictures
of
the
magic
lantern
of
life
and
regarding
them
now
in
the
cold
*NL*
white
daylight
of
his
clear
perception
of
death
.
``
There
they
are
,
those
*NL*
rudely
painted
figures
that
once
seemed
splendid
and
mysterious
.
Glory
,
*NL*
the
good
of
society
,
love
of
a
woman
,
the
Fatherland
itself
--
how
*NL*
important
these
pictures
appeared
to
me
,
with
what
profound
meaning
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
filled
!
And
it
is
all
so
simple
,
pale
,
and
crude
in
the
*NL*
cold
white
light
of
this
morning
which
I
feel
is
dawning
for
me
.
''
The
*NL*
three
great
sorrows
of
his
life
held
his
attention
in
particular
:
his
*NL*
love
for
a
woman
,
his
father
's
death
,
and
the
French
invasion
which
had
*NL*
overrun
half
Russia
.
``
Love
...
that
little
girl
who
seemed
to
me
brimming
*NL*
over
with
mystic
forces
!
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
loved
her
.
I
made
romantic
plans
*NL*
of
love
and
happiness
with
her
!
Oh
,
what
a
boy
I
was
!
''
he
said
aloud
*NL*
bitterly
.
``
Ah
me
!
I
believed
in
some
ideal
love
which
was
to
keep
her
*NL*
faithful
to
me
for
the
whole
year
of
my
absence
!
Like
the
gentle
dove
in
*NL*
the
fable
she
was
to
pine
apart
from
me
...
But
it
was
much
simpler
*NL*
really
...
It
was
all
very
simple
and
horrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
father
built
Bald
Hills
he
thought
the
place
was
his
:
his
land
,
*NL*
his
air
,
his
peasants
.
But
Napoleon
came
and
swept
him
aside
,
*NL*
unconscious
of
his
existence
,
as
he
might
brush
a
chip
from
his
path
,
*NL*
and
his
Bald
Hills
and
his
whole
life
fell
to
pieces
.
Princess
Mary
says
*NL*
it
is
a
trial
sent
from
above
.
What
is
the
trial
for
,
when
he
is
not
*NL*
here
and
will
never
return
?
He
is
not
here
!
For
whom
then
is
the
trial
*NL*
intended
?
The
Fatherland
,
the
destruction
of
Moscow
!
And
tomorrow
I
*NL*
shall
be
killed
,
perhaps
not
even
by
a
Frenchman
but
by
one
of
our
own
*NL*
men
,
by
a
soldier
discharging
a
musket
close
to
my
ear
as
one
of
them
*NL*
did
yesterday
,
and
the
French
will
come
and
take
me
by
head
and
heels
*NL*
and
fling
me
into
a
hole
that
I
may
not
stink
under
their
noses
,
and
new
*NL*
conditions
of
life
will
arise
,
which
will
seem
quite
ordinary
to
others
*NL*
and
about
which
I
shall
know
nothing
.
I
shall
not
exist
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
row
of
birches
shining
in
the
sunshine
,
with
their
*NL*
motionless
green
and
yellow
foliage
and
white
bark
.
``
To
die
...
to
be
*NL*
killed
tomorrow
...
That
I
should
not
exist
...
That
all
this
should
still
*NL*
be
,
but
no
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
birches
with
their
light
and
shade
,
the
curly
clouds
,
the
smoke
*NL*
of
the
campfires
,
and
all
that
was
around
him
changed
and
seemed
*NL*
terrible
and
menacing
.
A
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
.
He
rose
*NL*
quickly
,
went
out
of
the
shed
,
and
began
to
walk
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
returned
,
voices
were
heard
outside
the
shed
.
``
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red-nosed
Captain
Timokhin
,
formerly
Dolokhov
's
squadron
commander
,
*NL*
but
now
from
lack
of
officers
a
battalion
commander
,
shyly
entered
the
*NL*
shed
followed
by
an
adjutant
and
the
regimental
paymaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
rose
hastily
,
listened
to
the
business
they
had
come
*NL*
about
,
gave
them
some
further
instructions
,
and
was
about
to
dismiss
*NL*
them
when
he
heard
a
familiar
,
lisping
,
voice
behind
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
it
!
''
said
the
voice
of
a
man
stumbling
over
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
looked
out
of
the
shed
and
saw
Pierre
,
who
had
tripped
*NL*
over
a
pole
on
the
ground
and
had
nearly
fallen
,
coming
his
way
.
It
was
*NL*
unpleasant
to
Prince
Andrew
to
meet
people
of
his
own
set
in
general
,
*NL*
and
Pierre
especially
,
for
he
reminded
him
of
all
the
painful
moments
of
*NL*
his
last
visit
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
What
a
surprise
!
''
said
he
.
``
What
brings
you
here
?
This
is
*NL*
unexpected
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
his
eyes
and
face
expressed
more
than
coldness
--
they
*NL*
expressed
hostility
,
which
Pierre
noticed
at
once
.
He
had
approached
the
*NL*
shed
full
of
animation
,
but
on
seeing
Prince
Andrew
's
face
he
felt
*NL*
constrained
and
ill
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come
...
simply
...
you
know
...
come
...
it
interests
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Pierre
,
who
had
so
often
that
day
senselessly
repeated
that
word
*NL*
``
interesting
.
''
``
I
wish
to
see
the
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
and
what
do
the
masonic
brothers
say
about
war
?
How
would
they
*NL*
stop
it
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
sarcastically
.
``
Well
,
and
how
's
Moscow
?
And
*NL*
my
people
?
Have
they
reached
Moscow
at
last
?
''
he
asked
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
have
.
Julie
Drubetskaya
told
me
so
.
I
went
to
see
them
,
but
*NL*
missed
them
.
They
have
gone
to
your
estate
near
Moscow

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
were
about
to
take
leave
,
but
Prince
Andrew
,
apparently
*NL*
reluctant
to
be
left
alone
with
his
friend
,
asked
them
to
stay
and
have
*NL*
tea
.
Seats
were
brought
in
and
so
was
the
tea
.
The
officers
gazed
with
*NL*
surprise
at
Pierre
's
huge
stout
figure
and
listened
to
his
talk
of
*NL*
Moscow
and
the
position
of
our
army
,
round
which
he
had
ridden
.
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
remained
silent
,
and
his
expression
was
so
forbidding
that
Pierre
*NL*
addressed
his
remarks
chiefly
to
the
good-natured
battalion
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
understand
the
whole
position
of
our
troops
?
''
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
is
,
how
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Not
being
a
military
man
*NL*
I
ca
n't
say
I
have
understood
it
fully
,
but
I
understand
the
general
*NL*
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
know
more
than
anyone
else
,
be
it
who
it
may
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Pierre
,
looking
over
his
spectacles
in
perplexity
at
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
``
Well
,
and
what
do
you
think
of
Kutuzov
's
appointment
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
glad
of
his
appointment
,
that
's
all
I
know
,
''
replied
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
me
your
opinion
of
Barclay
de
Tolly
.
In
Moscow
they
are
saying
*NL*
heaven
knows
what
about
him
...
What
do
you
think
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
them
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
indicating
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
Timokhin
with
the
condescendingly
interrogative
smile
*NL*
with
which
everybody
involuntarily
addressed
that
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
see
light
again
,
since
his
Serenity
has
been
appointed
,
your
*NL*
excellency
,
''
said
Timokhin
timidly
,
and
continually
turning
to
glance
at
*NL*
his
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
mention
only
firewood
and
fodder
,
let
me
inform
you
.
Why
,
when
*NL*
we
were
retreating
from
Sventsyani
we
dare
not
touch
a
stick
or
a
wisp
*NL*
of
hay
or
anything
.
You
see
,
we
were
going
away
,
so
he
would
get
it
all
;
*NL*
was
n't
it
so
,
your
excellency
?
''
and
again
Timokhin
turned
to
the
prince
.
*NL*
``
But
we
dare
n't
.
In
our
regiment
two
officers
were
court-martialed
for
*NL*
that
kind
of
thing
.
But
when
his
Serenity
took
command
everything
became
*NL*
straight
forward
.
Now
we
see
light
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
was
it
forbidden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Timokhin
looked
about
in
confusion
,
not
knowing
what
or
how
to
answer
*NL*
such
a
question
.
Pierre
put
the
same
question
to
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
as
not
to
lay
waste
the
country
we
were
abandoning
to
the
*NL*
enemy
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
venomous
irony
.
``
It
is
very
sound
:
one
*NL*
ca
n't
permit
the
land
to
be
pillaged
and
accustom
the
troops
to
*NL*
marauding
.
At
Smolensk
too
he
judged
correctly
that
the
French
might
*NL*
outflank
us
,
as
they
had
larger
forces
.
But
he
could
not
understand
*NL*
this
,
''
cried
Prince
Andrew
in
a
shrill
voice
that
seemed
to
escape
him
*NL*
involuntarily
:
``
he
could
not
understand
that
there
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
we
were
fighting
for
Russian
soil
,
and
that
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
*NL*
men
such
as
I
had
never
seen
before
,
that
we
had
held
the
French
for
two
*NL*
days
,
and
that
that
success
had
increased
our
strength
tenfold
.
He
*NL*
ordered
us
to
retreat
,
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
nothing
.
*NL*
He
had
no
thought
of
betraying
us
,
he
tried
to
do
the
best
he
could
,
he
*NL*
thought
out
everything
,
and
that
is
why
he
is
unsuitable
.
He
is
*NL*
unsuitable
now
,
just
because
he
plans
out
everything
very
thoroughly
and
*NL*
accurately
as
every
German
has
to
.
How
can
I
explain
?
...
Well
,
say
your
*NL*
father
has
a
German
valet
,
and
he
is
a
splendid
valet
and
satisfies
your
*NL*
father
's
requirements
better
than
you
could
,
then
it
's
all
right
to
let
*NL*
him
serve
.
But
if
your
father
is
mortally
sick
you
'll
send
the
valet
*NL*
away
and
attend
to
your
father
with
your
own
unpracticed
,
awkward
hands
,
*NL*
and
will
soothe
him
better
than
a
skilled
man
who
is
a
stranger
could
.
*NL*
So
it
has
been
with
Barclay
.
While
Russia
was
well
,
a
foreigner
could
*NL*
serve
her
and
be
a
splendid
minister
;
but
as
soon
as
she
is
in
danger
*NL*
she
needs
one
of
her
own
kin
.
But
in
your
club
they
have
been
making
him
*NL*
out
a
traitor
!
They
slander
him
as
a
traitor
,
and
the
only
result
will
*NL*
be
that
afterwards
,
ashamed
of
their
false
accusations
,
they
will
make
*NL*
him
out
a
hero
or
a
genius
instead
of
a
traitor
,
and
that
will
be
still
*NL*
more
unjust
.
He
is
an
honest
and
very
punctilious
German
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
say
he
's
a
skillful
commander
,
''
rejoined
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
is
meant
by
'
a
skillful
commander
,
'
''
replied
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
skillful
commander
?
''
replied
Pierre
.
``
Why
,
one
who
foresees
all
*NL*
contingencies
...
and
foresees
the
adversary
's
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
impossible
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
as
if
it
were
a
matter
*NL*
settled
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
they
say
that
war
is
like
a
game
of
chess
?
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Prince
Andrew
,
``
but
with
this
little
difference
,
that
in
*NL*
chess
you
may
think
over
each
move
as
long
as
you
please
and
are
not
*NL*
limited
for
time
,
and
with
this
difference
too
,
that
a
knight
is
always
*NL*
stronger
than
a
pawn
,
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
one
,
while
*NL*
in
war
a
battalion
is
sometimes
stronger
than
a
division
and
sometimes
*NL*
weaker
than
a
company
.
The
relative
strength
of
bodies
of
troops
can
*NL*
never
be
known
to
anyone
.
Believe
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
if
things
depended
*NL*
on
arrangements
made
by
the
staff
,
I
should
be
there
making
*NL*
arrangements
,
but
instead
of
that
I
have
the
honor
to
serve
here
in
the
*NL*
regiment
with
these
gentlemen
,
and
I
consider
that
on
us
tomorrow
's
*NL*
battle
will
depend
and
not
on
those
others
...
Success
never
depends
,
*NL*
and
never
will
depend
,
on
position
,
or
equipment
,
or
even
on
numbers
,
*NL*
and
least
of
all
on
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
on
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
feeling
that
is
in
me
and
in
him
,
''
he
pointed
to
Timokhin
,
``
and
*NL*
in
each
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
glanced
at
Timokhin
,
who
looked
at
his
commander
in
alarm
*NL*
and
bewilderment
.
In
contrast
to
his
former
reticent
taciturnity
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
now
seemed
excited
.
He
could
apparently
not
refrain
from
*NL*
expressing
the
thoughts
that
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
battle
is
won
by
those
who
firmly
resolve
to
win
it
!
Why
did
we
lose
*NL*
the
battle
at
Austerlitz
?
The
French
losses
were
almost
equal
to
ours
,
*NL*
but
very
early
we
said
to
ourselves
that
we
were
losing
the
battle
,
and
*NL*
we
did
lose
it
.
And
we
said
so
because
we
had
nothing
to
fight
for
*NL*
there
,
we
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
battlefield
as
soon
as
we
could
.
*NL*
`
We
've
lost
,
so
let
us
run
,
'
and
we
ran
.
If
we
had
not
said
that
till
*NL*
the
evening
,
heaven
knows
what
might
not
have
happened
.
But
tomorrow
we
*NL*
sha
n't
say
it
!
You
talk
about
our
position
,
the
left
flank
weak
and
the
*NL*
right
flank
too
extended
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
That
's
all
nonsense
,
there
's
*NL*
nothing
of
the
kind
.
But
what
awaits
us
tomorrow
?
A
hundred
million
most
*NL*
diverse
chances
which
will
be
decided
on
the
instant
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
our
men
or
theirs
run
or
do
not
run
,
and
that
this
man
or
that
man
is
*NL*
killed
,
but
all
that
is
being
done
at
present
is
only
play
.
The
fact
is
*NL*
that
those
men
with
whom
you
have
ridden
round
the
position
not
only
do
*NL*
not
help
matters
,
but
hinder
.
They
are
only
concerned
with
their
own
*NL*
petty
interests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
such
a
moment
?
''
said
Pierre
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
such
a
moment
!
''
Prince
Andrew
repeated
.
``
To
them
it
is
only
a
moment
*NL*
affording
opportunities
to
undermine
a
rival
and
obtain
an
extra
cross
*NL*
or
ribbon
.
For
me
tomorrow
means
this
:
a
Russian
army
of
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
and
a
French
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
have
met
to
fight
,
and
*NL*
the
thing
is
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
the
side
*NL*
that
fights
more
fiercely
and
spares
itself
least
will
win
.
And
if
you
*NL*
like
I
will
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
and
whatever
muddles
those
at
*NL*
the
top
may
make
,
we
shall
win
tomorrow
's
battle
.
Tomorrow
,
happen
what
*NL*
may
,
we
shall
win
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
your
excellency
!
That
's
the
truth
,
the
real
truth
,
''
said
*NL*
Timokhin
.
``
Who
would
spare
himself
now
?
The
soldiers
in
my
battalion
,
*NL*
believe
me
,
would
n't
drink
their
vodka
!
`
It
's
not
the
day
for
that
!
'
*NL*
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
.
The
officers
rose
.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
of
the
shed
*NL*
with
them
,
giving
final
orders
to
the
adjutant
.
After
they
had
gone
*NL*
Pierre
approached
Prince
Andrew
and
was
about
to
start
a
conversation
*NL*
when
they
heard
the
clatter
of
three
horses
'
hoofs
on
the
road
not
far
*NL*
from
the
shed
,
and
looking
in
that
direction
Prince
Andrew
recognized
*NL*
Wolzogen
and
Clausewitz
accompanied
by
a
Cossack
.
They
rode
close
by
*NL*
continuing
to
converse
,
and
Prince
Andrew
involuntarily
heard
these
*NL*
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Der
Krieg
muss
in
Raum
verlegt
werden
.
Der
Ansicht
kann
ich
nicht
genug
*NL*
Preis
geben
,
''
*
said
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
The
war
must
be
extended
widely
.
I
can
not
sufficiently
commend
that
*NL*
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ja
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
der
Zweck
ist
nur
den
Feind
zu
schwaechen
,
so
*NL*
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
Verlust
der
Privat-Personen
in
Achtung
*NL*
nehmen
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
the
only
aim
is
to
weaken
the
enemy
,
so
of
course
one
can
not
*NL*
take
into
account
the
loss
of
private
individuals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
agreed
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extend
widely
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
with
an
angry
snort
,
when
they
had
*NL*
ridden
past
.
``
In
that
`
extend
'
were
my
father
,
son
,
and
sister
,
at
Bald
*NL*
Hills
.
That
's
all
the
same
to
him
!
That
's
what
I
was
saying
to
you
--
*NL*
those
German
gentlemen
wo
n't
win
the
battle
tomorrow
but
will
only
make
*NL*
all
the
mess
they
can
,
because
they
have
nothing
in
their
German
heads
*NL*
but
theories
not
worth
an
empty
eggshell
and
have
n't
in
their
hearts
the
*NL*
one
thing
needed
tomorrow
--
that
which
Timokhin
has
.
They
have
yielded
up
*NL*
all
Europe
to
him
,
and
have
now
come
to
teach
us
.
Fine
teachers
!
''
and
*NL*
again
his
voice
grew
shrill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think
we
shall
win
tomorrow
's
battle
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
answered
Prince
Andrew
absently
.
``
One
thing
I
would
do
if
I
*NL*
had
the
power
,
''
he
began
again
,
``
I
would
not
take
prisoners
.
Why
take
*NL*
prisoners
?
It
's
chivalry
!
The
French
have
destroyed
my
home
and
are
on
*NL*
their
way
to
destroy
Moscow
,
they
have
outraged
and
are
outraging
me
*NL*
every
moment
.
They
are
my
enemies
.
In
my
opinion
they
are
all
criminals
.
*NL*
And
so
thinks
Timokhin
and
the
whole
army
.
They
should
be
executed
!
*NL*
Since
they
are
my
foes
they
can
not
be
my
friends
,
whatever
may
have
been
*NL*
said
at
Tilsit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
muttered
Pierre
,
looking
with
shining
eyes
at
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
``
I
quite
agree
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
that
had
perturbed
Pierre
on
the
Mozhaysk
hill
and
all
that
*NL*
day
now
seemed
to
him
quite
clear
and
completely
solved
.
He
now
*NL*
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
importance
of
this
war
and
of
the
*NL*
impending
battle
.
All
he
had
seen
that
day
,
all
the
significant
and
*NL*
stern
expressions
on
the
faces
he
had
seen
in
passing
,
were
lit
up
for
*NL*
him
by
a
new
light
.
He
understood
that
latent
heat
-LRB-
as
they
say
in
*NL*
physics
-RRB-
of
patriotism
which
was
present
in
all
these
men
he
had
seen
,
*NL*
and
this
explained
to
him
why
they
all
prepared
for
death
calmly
,
and
as
*NL*
it
were
lightheartedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
take
prisoners
,
''
Prince
Andrew
continued
:
``
That
by
itself
would
*NL*
quite
change
the
whole
war
and
make
it
less
cruel
.
As
it
is
we
have
*NL*
played
at
war
--
that
's
what
's
vile
!
We
play
at
magnanimity
and
all
that
*NL*
stuff
.
Such
magnanimity
and
sensibility
are
like
the
magnanimity
and
*NL*
sensibility
of
a
lady
who
faints
when
she
sees
a
calf
being
killed
:
she
*NL*
is
so
kindhearted
that
she
ca
n't
look
at
blood
,
but
enjoys
eating
the
*NL*
calf
served
up
with
sauce
.
They
talk
to
us
of
the
rules
of
war
,
of
*NL*
chivalry
,
of
flags
of
truce
,
of
mercy
to
the
unfortunate
and
so
on
.
It
's
*NL*
all
rubbish
!
I
saw
chivalry
and
flags
of
truce
in
1805
;
they
humbugged
*NL*
us
and
we
humbugged
them
.
They
plunder
other
people
's
houses
,
issue
*NL*
false
paper
money
,
and
worst
of
all
they
kill
my
children
and
my
father
,
*NL*
and
then
talk
of
rules
of
war
and
magnanimity
to
foes
!
Take
no
*NL*
prisoners
,
but
kill
and
be
killed
!
He
who
has
come
to
this
as
I
have
*NL*
through
the
same
sufferings
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
who
had
thought
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
or
not
*NL*
Moscow
was
taken
as
Smolensk
had
been
,
was
suddenly
checked
in
his
*NL*
speech
by
an
unexpected
cramp
in
his
throat
.
He
paced
up
and
down
a
few
*NL*
times
in
silence
,
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
his
lips
*NL*
quivered
as
he
began
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
was
none
of
this
magnanimity
in
war
,
we
should
go
to
war
only
*NL*
when
it
was
worth
while
going
to
certain
death
,
as
now
.
Then
there
would
*NL*
not
be
war
because
Paul
Ivanovich
had
offended
Michael
Ivanovich
.
And
*NL*
when
there
was
a
war
,
like
this
one
,
it
would
be
war
!
And
then
the
*NL*
determination
of
the
troops
would
be
quite
different
.
Then
all
these
*NL*
Westphalians
and
Hessians
whom
Napoleon
is
leading
would
not
follow
him
*NL*
into
Russia
,
and
we
should
not
go
to
fight
in
Austria
and
Prussia
*NL*
without
knowing
why
.
War
is
not
courtesy
but
the
most
horrible
thing
in
*NL*
life
;
and
we
ought
to
understand
that
and
not
play
at
war
.
We
ought
to
*NL*
accept
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
seriously
.
It
all
lies
in
*NL*
that
:
get
rid
of
falsehood
and
let
war
be
war
and
not
a
game
.
As
it
is
*NL*
now
,
war
is
the
favorite
pastime
of
the
idle
and
frivolous
.
The
military
*NL*
calling
is
the
most
highly
honored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
war
?
What
is
needed
for
success
in
warfare
?
What
are
the
*NL*
habits
of
the
military
?
The
aim
of
war
is
murder
;
the
methods
of
war
are
*NL*
spying
,
treachery
,
and
their
encouragement
,
the
ruin
of
a
country
's
*NL*
inhabitants
,
robbing
them
or
stealing
to
provision
the
army
,
and
fraud
*NL*
and
falsehood
termed
military
craft
.
The
habits
of
the
military
class
*NL*
are
the
absence
of
freedom
,
that
is
,
discipline
,
idleness
,
ignorance
,
*NL*
cruelty
,
debauchery
,
and
drunkenness
.
And
in
spite
of
all
this
it
is
the
*NL*
highest
class
,
respected
by
everyone
.
All
the
kings
,
except
the
Chinese
,
*NL*
wear
military
uniforms
,
and
he
who
kills
most
people
receives
the
*NL*
highest
rewards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
meet
,
as
we
shall
meet
tomorrow
,
to
murder
one
another
;
they
kill
*NL*
and
maim
tens
of
thousands
,
and
then
have
thanksgiving
services
for
*NL*
having
killed
so
many
people
-LRB-
they
even
exaggerate
the
number
-RRB-
,
and
they
*NL*
announce
a
victory
,
supposing
that
the
more
people
they
have
killed
the
*NL*
greater
their
achievement
.
How
does
God
above
look
at
them
and
hear
*NL*
them
?
''
exclaimed
Prince
Andrew
in
a
shrill
,
piercing
voice
.
``
Ah
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
it
has
of
late
become
hard
for
me
to
live
.
I
see
that
I
have
*NL*
begun
to
understand
too
much
.
And
it
does
n't
do
for
man
to
taste
of
the
*NL*
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
...
Ah
,
well
,
it
's
not
for
long
!
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
you
're
sleepy
,
and
it
's
time
for
me
to
sleep
.
Go
back
to
*NL*
Gorki
!
''
said
Prince
Andrew
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
Pierre
replied
,
looking
at
Prince
Andrew
with
frightened
,
*NL*
compassionate
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
go
!
Before
a
battle
one
must
have
one
's
sleep
out
,
''
repeated
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
quickly
up
to
Pierre
and
embraced
and
kissed
him
.
``
Good-bye
,
be
*NL*
off
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Whether
we
meet
again
or
not
...
''
and
turning
away
*NL*
hurriedly
he
entered
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
dark
,
and
Pierre
could
not
make
out
whether
the
*NL*
expression
of
Prince
Andrew
's
face
was
angry
or
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
he
stood
in
silence
considering
whether
he
should
follow
*NL*
him
or
go
away
.
``
No
,
he
does
not
want
it
!
''
Pierre
concluded
.
``
And
I
know
*NL*
that
this
is
our
last
meeting
!
''
He
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
to
Gorki
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
re-entering
the
shed
Prince
Andrew
lay
down
on
a
rug
,
but
he
could
*NL*
not
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
.
One
picture
succeeded
another
in
his
imagination
.
On
*NL*
one
of
them
he
dwelt
long
and
joyfully
.
He
vividly
recalled
an
evening
*NL*
in
Petersburg
.
Natasha
with
animated
and
excited
face
was
telling
him
*NL*
how
she
had
gone
to
look
for
mushrooms
the
previous
summer
and
had
lost
*NL*
her
way
in
the
big
forest
.
She
incoherently
described
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
forest
,
her
feelings
,
and
a
talk
with
a
beekeeper
she
met
,
and
*NL*
constantly
interrupted
her
story
to
say
:
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
!
I
'm
not
telling
*NL*
it
right
;
no
,
you
do
n't
understand
,
''
though
he
encouraged
her
by
saying
*NL*
that
he
did
understand
,
and
he
really
had
understood
all
she
wanted
to
*NL*
say
.
But
Natasha
was
not
satisfied
with
her
own
words
:
she
felt
that
*NL*
they
did
not
convey
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
she
had
experienced
*NL*
that
day
and
wished
to
convey
.
``
He
was
such
a
delightful
old
man
,
and
it
*NL*
was
so
dark
in
the
forest
...
and
he
had
such
kind
...
No
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
describe
it
,
''
she
had
said
,
flushed
and
excited
.
Prince
Andrew
smiled
*NL*
now
the
same
happy
smile
as
then
when
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes
.
``
I
*NL*
understood
her
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
not
only
understood
her
,
but
it
was
just
*NL*
that
inner
,
spiritual
force
,
that
sincerity
,
that
frankness
of
soul
--
*NL*
that
very
soul
of
hers
which
seemed
to
be
fettered
by
her
body
--
it
was
*NL*
that
soul
I
loved
in
her
...
loved
so
strongly
and
happily
...
''
and
*NL*
suddenly
he
remembered
how
his
love
had
ended
.
``
He
did
not
need
anything
*NL*
of
that
kind
.
He
neither
saw
nor
understood
anything
of
the
sort
.
He
*NL*
only
saw
in
her
a
pretty
and
fresh
young
girl
,
with
whom
he
did
not
*NL*
deign
to
unite
his
fate
.
And
I
?
...
and
he
is
still
alive
and
gay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
jumped
up
as
if
someone
had
burned
him
,
and
again
began
*NL*
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
shed
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
On
August
25
,
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
M.
de
Beausset
,
prefect
*NL*
of
the
French
Emperor
's
palace
,
arrived
at
Napoleon
's
quarters
at
*NL*
Valuevo
with
Colonel
Fabvier
,
the
former
from
Paris
and
the
latter
from
*NL*
Madrid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Donning
his
court
uniform
,
M.
de
Beausset
ordered
a
box
he
had
brought
*NL*
for
the
Emperor
to
be
carried
before
him
and
entered
the
first
*NL*
compartment
of
Napoleon
's
tent
,
where
he
began
opening
the
box
while
*NL*
conversing
with
Napoleon
's
aides-de-camp
who
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fabvier
,
not
entering
the
tent
,
remained
at
the
entrance
talking
to
some
*NL*
generals
of
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
Napoleon
had
not
yet
left
his
bedroom
and
was
finishing
his
*NL*
toilet
.
Slightly
snorting
and
grunting
,
he
presented
now
his
back
and
*NL*
now
his
plump
hairy
chest
to
the
brush
with
which
his
valet
was
rubbing
*NL*
him
down
.
Another
valet
,
with
his
finger
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle
,
was
*NL*
sprinkling
Eau
de
Cologne
on
the
Emperor
's
pampered
body
with
an
*NL*
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
alone
knew
where
and
how
much
Eau
*NL*
de
Cologne
should
be
sprinkled
.
Napoleon
's
short
hair
was
wet
and
matted
*NL*
on
the
forehead
,
but
his
face
,
though
puffy
and
yellow
,
expressed
*NL*
physical
satisfaction
.
``
Go
on
,
harder
,
go
on
!
''
he
muttered
to
the
valet
*NL*
who
was
rubbing
him
,
slightly
twitching
and
grunting
.
An
aide-de-camp
,
*NL*
who
had
entered
the
bedroom
to
report
to
the
Emperor
the
number
of
*NL*
prisoners
taken
in
yesterday
's
action
,
was
standing
by
the
door
after
*NL*
delivering
his
message
,
awaiting
permission
to
withdraw
.
Napoleon
,
*NL*
frowning
,
looked
at
him
from
under
his
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
prisoners
!
''
said
he
,
repeating
the
aide-de-camp
's
words
.
``
They
are
*NL*
forcing
us
to
exterminate
them
.
So
much
the
worse
for
the
Russian
*NL*
army
...
Go
on
...
harder
,
harder
!
''
he
muttered
,
hunching
his
back
and
*NL*
presenting
his
fat
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
Let
Monsieur
de
Beausset
enter
,
and
Fabvier
too
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
nodding
to
the
aide-de-camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
''
and
the
aide-de-camp
disappeared
through
the
door
of
the
*NL*
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
valets
rapidly
dressed
His
Majesty
,
and
wearing
the
blue
uniform
of
*NL*
the
Guards
he
went
with
firm
quick
steps
to
the
reception
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
De
Beausset
's
hands
meanwhile
were
busily
engaged
arranging
the
present
*NL*
he
had
brought
from
the
Empress
,
on
two
chairs
directly
in
front
of
the
*NL*
entrance
.
But
Napoleon
had
dressed
and
come
out
with
such
unexpected
*NL*
rapidity
that
he
had
not
time
to
finish
arranging
the
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
noticed
at
once
what
they
were
about
and
guessed
that
they
were
*NL*
not
ready
.
He
did
not
wish
to
deprive
them
of
the
pleasure
of
giving
him
*NL*
a
surprise
,
so
he
pretended
not
to
see
de
Beausset
and
called
Fabvier
to
*NL*
him
,
listening
silently
and
with
a
stern
frown
to
what
Fabvier
told
him
*NL*
of
the
heroism
and
devotion
of
his
troops
fighting
at
Salamanca
,
at
the
*NL*
other
end
of
Europe
,
with
but
one
thought
--
to
be
worthy
of
their
*NL*
Emperor
--
and
but
one
fear
--
to
fail
to
please
him
.
The
result
of
that
*NL*
battle
had
been
deplorable
.
Napoleon
made
ironic
remarks
during
*NL*
Fabvier
's
account
,
as
if
he
had
not
expected
that
matters
could
go
*NL*
otherwise
in
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
make
up
for
that
in
Moscow
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
I
'll
see
you
*NL*
later
,
''
he
added
,
and
summoned
de
Beausset
,
who
by
that
time
had
*NL*
prepared
the
surprise
,
having
placed
something
on
the
chairs
and
covered
*NL*
it
with
a
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
De
Beausset
bowed
low
,
with
that
courtly
French
bow
which
only
the
old
*NL*
retainers
of
the
Bourbons
knew
how
to
make
,
and
approached
him
,
*NL*
presenting
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
turned
to
him
gaily
and
pulled
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
hurried
here
.
I
am
very
glad
.
Well
,
what
is
Paris
saying
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
suddenly
changing
his
former
stern
expression
for
a
most
cordial
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
all
Paris
regrets
your
absence
,
''
replied
de
Beausset
as
was
*NL*
proper
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Napoleon
knew
that
de
Beausset
had
to
say
something
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
and
though
in
his
lucid
moments
he
knew
it
was
untrue
,
he
was
*NL*
pleased
to
hear
it
from
him
.
Again
he
honored
him
by
touching
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
to
have
made
you
travel
so
far
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
I
expected
nothing
less
than
to
find
you
at
the
gates
of
Moscow
,
''
*NL*
replied
de
Beausset
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
smiled
and
,
lifting
his
head
absent-mindedly
,
glanced
to
the
*NL*
right
.
An
aide-de-camp
approached
with
gliding
steps
and
offered
him
a
*NL*
gold
snuffbox
,
which
he
took
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
has
happened
luckily
for
you
,
''
he
said
,
raising
the
open
*NL*
snuffbox
to
his
nose
.
``
You
are
fond
of
travel
,
and
in
three
days
you
*NL*
will
see
Moscow
.
You
surely
did
not
expect
to
see
that
Asiatic
capital
.
*NL*
You
will
have
a
pleasant
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Beausset
bowed
gratefully
at
this
regard
for
his
taste
for
travel
-LRB-
of
*NL*
which
he
had
not
till
then
been
aware
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
what
's
this
?
''
asked
Napoleon
,
noticing
that
all
the
courtiers
were
*NL*
looking
at
something
concealed
under
a
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
courtly
adroitness
de
Beausset
half
turned
and
without
turning
his
*NL*
back
to
the
Emperor
retired
two
steps
,
twitching
off
the
cloth
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
present
to
Your
Majesty
from
the
Empress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
portrait
,
painted
in
bright
colors
by
Gerard
,
of
the
son
borne
*NL*
to
Napoleon
by
the
daughter
of
the
Emperor
of
Austria
,
the
boy
whom
for
*NL*
some
reason
everyone
called
``
The
King
of
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
pretty
curly-headed
boy
with
a
look
of
the
Christ
in
the
Sistine
*NL*
Madonna
was
depicted
playing
at
stick
and
ball
.
The
ball
represented
the
*NL*
terrestrial
globe
and
the
stick
in
his
other
hand
a
scepter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
not
clear
what
the
artist
meant
to
express
by
depicting
*NL*
the
so-called
King
of
Rome
spiking
the
earth
with
a
stick
,
the
allegory
*NL*
apparently
seemed
to
Napoleon
,
as
it
had
done
to
all
who
had
seen
it
in
*NL*
Paris
,
quite
clear
and
very
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
King
of
Rome
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
portrait
with
a
graceful
*NL*
gesture
.
``
Admirable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
natural
capacity
of
an
Italian
for
changing
the
expression
of
*NL*
his
face
at
will
,
he
drew
nearer
to
the
portrait
and
assumed
a
look
of
*NL*
pensive
tenderness
.
He
felt
that
what
he
now
said
and
did
would
be
*NL*
historical
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
now
be
best
for
him
--
*NL*
whose
grandeur
enabled
his
son
to
play
stick
and
ball
with
the
*NL*
terrestrial
globe
--
to
show
,
in
contrast
to
that
grandeur
,
the
simplest
*NL*
paternal
tenderness
.
His
eyes
grew
dim
,
he
moved
forward
,
glanced
round
*NL*
at
a
chair
-LRB-
which
seemed
to
place
itself
under
him
-RRB-
,
and
sat
down
on
it
*NL*
before
the
portrait
.
At
a
single
gesture
from
him
everyone
went
out
on
*NL*
tiptoe
,
leaving
the
great
man
to
himself
and
his
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sat
still
for
a
while
he
touched
--
himself
not
knowing
why
--
the
*NL*
thick
spot
of
paint
representing
the
highest
light
in
the
portrait
,
*NL*
rose
,
and
recalled
de
Beausset
and
the
officer
on
duty
.
He
ordered
the
*NL*
portrait
to
be
carried
outside
his
tent
,
that
the
Old
Guard
,
stationed
*NL*
round
it
,
might
not
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
King
of
*NL*
Rome
,
the
son
and
heir
of
their
adored
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
he
was
doing
M.
de
Beausset
the
honor
of
breakfasting
with
*NL*
him
,
they
heard
,
as
Napoleon
had
anticipated
,
the
rapturous
cries
of
the
*NL*
officers
and
men
of
the
Old
Guard
who
had
run
up
to
see
the
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
Vive
le
roi
de
Rome
!
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
came
those
*NL*
ecstatic
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
Napoleon
in
de
Beausset
's
presence
dictated
his
order
of
*NL*
the
day
to
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Short
and
energetic
!
''
he
remarked
when
he
had
read
over
the
*NL*
proclamation
which
he
had
dictated
straight
off
without
corrections
.
It
*NL*
ran
:
*NL*
*NL*
Soldiers
!
This
is
the
battle
you
have
so
longed
for
.
Victory
depends
on
*NL*
you
.
It
is
essential
for
us
;
it
will
give
us
all
we
need
:
comfortable
*NL*
quarters
and
a
speedy
return
to
our
country
.
Behave
as
you
did
at
*NL*
Austerlitz
,
Friedland
,
Vitebsk
,
and
Smolensk
.
Let
our
remotest
posterity
*NL*
recall
your
achievements
this
day
with
pride
.
Let
it
be
said
of
each
of
*NL*
you
:
``
He
was
in
the
great
battle
before
Moscow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
Moscow
!
''
repeated
Napoleon
,
and
inviting
M.
de
Beausset
,
who
was
*NL*
so
fond
of
travel
,
to
accompany
him
on
his
ride
,
he
went
out
of
the
tent
*NL*
to
where
the
horses
stood
saddled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Majesty
is
too
kind
!
''
replied
de
Beausset
to
the
invitation
to
*NL*
accompany
the
Emperor
;
he
wanted
to
sleep
,
did
not
know
how
to
ride
and
*NL*
was
afraid
of
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Napoleon
nodded
to
the
traveler
,
and
de
Beausset
had
to
mount
.
When
*NL*
Napoleon
came
out
of
the
tent
the
shouting
of
the
Guards
before
his
*NL*
son
's
portrait
grew
still
louder
.
Napoleon
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
him
away
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
with
a
gracefully
majestic
gesture
to
*NL*
the
portrait
.
``
It
is
too
soon
for
him
to
see
a
field
of
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Beausset
closed
his
eyes
,
bowed
his
head
,
and
sighed
deeply
,
to
*NL*
indicate
how
profoundly
he
valued
and
comprehended
the
Emperor
's
words
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-fifth
of
August
,
so
his
historians
tell
us
,
Napoleon
spent
*NL*
the
whole
day
on
horseback
inspecting
the
locality
,
considering
plans
*NL*
submitted
to
him
by
his
marshals
,
and
personally
giving
commands
to
his
*NL*
generals
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
original
line
of
the
Russian
forces
along
the
river
Kolocha
had
been
*NL*
dislocated
by
the
capture
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
on
the
twenty
-
*NL*
fourth
,
and
part
of
the
line
--
the
left
flank
--
had
been
drawn
back
.
That
*NL*
part
of
the
line
was
not
entrenched
and
in
front
of
it
the
ground
was
*NL*
more
open
and
level
than
elsewhere
.
It
was
evident
to
anyone
,
military
*NL*
or
not
,
that
it
was
here
the
French
should
attack
.
It
would
seem
that
*NL*
not
much
consideration
was
needed
to
reach
this
conclusion
,
nor
any
*NL*
particular
care
or
trouble
on
the
part
of
the
Emperor
and
his
marshals
,
*NL*
nor
was
there
any
need
of
that
special
and
supreme
quality
called
genius
*NL*
that
people
are
so
apt
to
ascribe
to
Napoleon
;
yet
the
historians
who
*NL*
described
the
event
later
and
the
men
who
then
surrounded
Napoleon
,
and
*NL*
he
himself
,
thought
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
rode
over
the
plain
and
surveyed
the
locality
with
a
profound
*NL*
air
and
in
silence
,
nodded
with
approval
or
shook
his
head
dubiously
,
*NL*
and
without
communicating
to
the
generals
around
him
the
profound
course
*NL*
of
ideas
which
guided
his
decisions
merely
gave
them
his
final
*NL*
conclusions
in
the
form
of
commands
.
Having
listened
to
a
suggestion
*NL*
from
Davout
,
who
was
now
called
Prince
d'Eckmuhl
,
to
turn
the
Russian
*NL*
left
wing
,
Napoleon
said
it
should
not
be
done
,
without
explaining
why
*NL*
not
.
To
a
proposal
made
by
General
Campan
-LRB-
who
was
to
attack
the
*NL*
fleches
-RRB-
to
lead
his
division
through
the
woods
,
Napoleon
agreed
,
though
*NL*
the
so-called
Duke
of
Elchingen
-LRB-
Ney
-RRB-
ventured
to
remark
that
a
movement
*NL*
through
the
woods
was
dangerous
and
might
disorder
the
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
inspected
the
country
opposite
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
,
Napoleon
*NL*
pondered
a
little
in
silence
and
then
indicated
the
spots
where
two
*NL*
batteries
should
be
set
up
by
the
morrow
to
act
against
the
Russian
*NL*
entrenchments
,
and
the
places
where
,
in
line
with
them
,
the
field
*NL*
artillery
should
be
placed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
giving
these
and
other
commands
he
returned
to
his
tent
,
and
the
*NL*
dispositions
for
the
battle
were
written
down
from
his
dictation
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
dispositions
,
of
which
the
French
historians
write
with
enthusiasm
*NL*
and
other
historians
with
profound
respect
,
were
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
At
dawn
the
two
new
batteries
established
during
the
night
on
the
plain
*NL*
occupied
by
the
Prince
d'Eckmuhl
will
open
fire
on
the
opposing
*NL*
batteries
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
the
commander
of
the
artillery
of
the
1st
Corps
,
*NL*
General
Pernetti
,
with
thirty
cannon
of
Campan
's
division
and
all
the
*NL*
howitzers
of
Dessaix
's
and
Friant
's
divisions
,
will
move
forward
,
open
*NL*
fire
,
and
overwhelm
with
shellfire
the
enemy
's
battery
,
against
which
*NL*
will
operate
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
24
guns
of
the
artillery
of
the
Guards
30
guns
of
Campan
's
division
*NL*
*NL*
and
8
guns
of
Friant
's
and
Dessaix
's
divisions
--
*NL*
*NL*
in
all
62
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
artillery
of
the
3rd
Corps
,
General
Fouche
,
will
*NL*
place
the
howitzers
of
the
3rd
and
8th
Corps
,
sixteen
in
all
,
on
the
*NL*
flanks
of
the
battery
that
is
to
bombard
the
entrenchment
on
the
left
,
*NL*
which
will
have
forty
guns
in
all
directed
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
Sorbier
must
be
ready
at
the
first
order
to
advance
with
all
the
*NL*
howitzers
of
the
Guard
's
artillery
against
either
one
or
other
of
the
*NL*
entrenchments
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
cannonade
Prince
Poniatowski
is
to
advance
through
the
wood
*NL*
on
the
village
and
turn
the
enemy
's
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
General
Campan
will
move
through
the
wood
to
seize
the
first
*NL*
fortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
advance
has
begun
in
this
manner
,
orders
will
be
given
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
enemy
's
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cannonade
on
the
left
flank
will
begin
as
soon
as
the
guns
of
the
*NL*
right
wing
are
heard
.
The
sharpshooters
of
Morand
's
division
and
of
the
*NL*
vice-King
's
division
will
open
a
heavy
fire
on
seeing
the
attack
*NL*
commence
on
the
right
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vice-King
will
occupy
the
village
and
cross
by
its
three
bridges
,
*NL*
advancing
to
the
same
heights
as
Morand
's
and
Gibrard
's
divisions
,
which
*NL*
under
his
leadership
will
be
directed
against
the
redoubt
and
come
into
*NL*
line
with
the
rest
of
the
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
must
be
done
in
good
order
-LRB-
le
tout
se
fera
avec
ordre
et

as
far
as
possible
retaining
troops
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Imperial
Camp
near
Mozhaysk
,
*NL*
*NL*
September
,
6
,
1812
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
dispositions
,
which
are
very
obscure
and
confused
if
one
allows
*NL*
oneself
to
regard
the
arrangements
without
religious
awe
of
his
genius
,
*NL*
related
to
Napoleon
's
orders
to
deal
with
four
points
--
four
different
*NL*
orders
.
Not
one
of
these
was
,
or
could
be
,
carried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
disposition
it
is
said
first
that
the
batteries
placed
on
the
*NL*
spot
chosen
by
Napoleon
,
with
the
guns
of
Pernetti
and
Fouche
;
which
*NL*
were
to
come
in
line
with
them
,
102
guns
in
all
,
were
to
open
fire
and
*NL*
shower
shells
on
the
Russian
fleches
and
redoubts
.
This
could
not
be
*NL*
done
,
as
from
the
spots
selected
by
Napoleon
the
projectiles
did
not
*NL*
carry
to
the
Russian
works
,
and
those
102
guns
shot
into
the
air
until
*NL*
the
nearest
commander
,
contrary
to
Napoleon
's
instructions
,
moved
them
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
order
was
that
Poniatowski
,
moving
to
the
village
through
the
*NL*
wood
,
should
turn
the
Russian
left
flank
.
This
could
not
be
done
and
was
*NL*
not
done
,
because
Poniatowski
,
advancing
on
the
village
through
the
*NL*
wood
,
met
Tuchkov
there
barring
his
way
,
and
could
not
and
did
not
turn
*NL*
the
Russian
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
order
was
:
General
Campan
will
move
through
the
wood
to
seize
*NL*
the
first
fortification
.
General
Campan
's
division
did
not
seize
the
*NL*
first
fortification
but
was
driven
back
,
for
on
emerging
from
the
wood
*NL*
it
had
to
reform
under
grapeshot
,
of
which
Napoleon
was
unaware
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fourth
order
was
:
The
vice-King
will
occupy
the
village
-LRB-
Borodino
-RRB-
*NL*
and
cross
by
its
three
bridges
,
advancing
to
the
same
heights
as
*NL*
Morand
's
and
Gibrard
's
divisions
-LRB-
for
whose
movements
no
directions
are
*NL*
given
-RRB-
,
which
under
his
leadership
will
be
directed
against
the
redoubt
*NL*
and
come
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
one
can
make
out
,
not
so
much
from
this
unintelligible
*NL*
sentence
as
from
the
attempts
the
vice-King
made
to
execute
the
orders
*NL*
given
him
,
he
was
to
advance
from
the
left
through
Borodino
to
the
*NL*
redoubt
while
the
divisions
of
Morand
and
Gerard
were
to
advance
*NL*
simultaneously
from
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
like
the
other
parts
of
the
disposition
,
was
not
and
could
not
*NL*
be
executed
.
After
passing
through
Borodino
the
vice-King
was
driven
*NL*
back
to
the
Kolocha
and
could
get
no
farther
;
while
the
divisions
of
*NL*
Morand
and
Gerard
did
not
take
the
redoubt
but
were
driven
back
,
and
the
*NL*
redoubt
was
only
taken
at
the
end
of
the
battle
by
the
cavalry
-LRB-
a
thing
*NL*
probably
unforeseen
and
not
heard
of
by
Napoleon
-RRB-
.
So
not
one
of
the
*NL*
orders
in
the
disposition
was
,
or
could
be
,
executed
.
But
in
the
*NL*
disposition
it
is
said
that
,
after
the
fight
has
commenced
in
this
*NL*
manner
,
orders
will
be
given
in
accordance
with
the
enemy
's
movements
,
*NL*
and
so
it
might
be
supposed
that
all
necessary
arrangements
would
be
*NL*
made
by
Napoleon
during
the
battle
.
But
this
was
not
and
could
not
be
*NL*
done
,
for
during
the
whole
battle
Napoleon
was
so
far
away
that
,
as
*NL*
appeared
later
,
he
could
not
know
the
course
of
the
battle
and
not
one
*NL*
of
his
orders
during
the
fight
could
be
executed
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Many
historians
say
that
the
French
did
not
win
the
battle
of
Borodino
*NL*
because
Napoleon
had
a
cold
,
and
that
if
he
had
not
had
a
cold
the
*NL*
orders
he
gave
before
and
during
the
battle
would
have
been
still
more
*NL*
full
of
genius
and
Russia
would
have
been
lost
and
the
face
of
the
world
*NL*
have
been
changed
.
To
historians
who
believe
that
Russia
was
shaped
by
*NL*
the
will
of
one
man
--
Peter
the
Great
--
and
that
France
from
a
republic
*NL*
became
an
empire
and
French
armies
went
to
Russia
at
the
will
of
one
*NL*
man
--
Napoleon
--
to
say
that
Russia
remained
a
power
because
Napoleon
had
*NL*
a
bad
cold
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
may
seem
logical
and
*NL*
convincing
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
depended
on
Napoleon
's
will
to
fight
or
not
to
fight
the
*NL*
battle
of
Borodino
,
and
if
this
or
that
other
arrangement
depended
on
*NL*
his
will
,
then
evidently
a
cold
affecting
the
manifestation
of
his
will
*NL*
might
have
saved
Russia
,
and
consequently
the
valet
who
omitted
to
bring
*NL*
Napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
on
the
twenty-fourth
would
have
been
the
*NL*
savior
of
Russia
.
Along
that
line
of
thought
such
a
deduction
is
*NL*
indubitable
,
as
indubitable
as
the
deduction
Voltaire
made
in
jest
*NL*
-LRB-
without
knowing
what
he
was
jesting
at
-RRB-
when
he
saw
that
the
Massacre
*NL*
of
St.
Bartholomew
was
due
to
Charles
IX
's
stomach
being
deranged
.
But
*NL*
to
men
who
do
not
admit
that
Russia
was
formed
by
the
will
of
one
man
,
*NL*
Peter
I
,
or
that
the
French
Empire
was
formed
and
the
war
with
Russia
*NL*
begun
by
the
will
of
one
man
,
Napoleon
,
that
argument
seems
not
merely
*NL*
untrue
and
irrational
,
but
contrary
to
all
human
reality
.
To
the
*NL*
question
of
what
causes
historic
events
another
answer
presents
itself
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
the
course
of
human
events
is
predetermined
from
on
high
--
*NL*
depends
on
the
coincidence
of
the
wills
of
all
who
take
part
in
the
*NL*
events
,
and
that
a
Napoleon
's
influence
on
the
course
of
these
events
is
*NL*
purely
external
and
fictitious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
as
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
Massacre
of
*NL*
St.
Bartholomew
was
not
due
to
Charles
IX
's
will
,
though
he
gave
the
*NL*
order
for
it
and
thought
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
that
order
;
and
*NL*
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
slaughter
of
eighty
thousand
*NL*
men
at
Borodino
was
not
due
to
Napoleon
's
will
,
though
he
ordered
the
*NL*
commencement
and
conduct
of
the
battle
and
thought
it
was
done
because
*NL*
he
ordered
it
;
strange
as
these
suppositions
appear
,
yet
human
dignity
--
*NL*
which
tells
me
that
each
of
us
is
,
if
not
more
at
least
not
less
a
man
*NL*
than
the
great
Napoleon
--
demands
the
acceptance
of
that
solution
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
historic
investigation
abundantly
confirms
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
battle
of
Borodino
Napoleon
shot
at
no
one
and
killed
no
one
.
*NL*
That
was
all
done
by
the
soldiers
.
Therefore
it
was
not
he
who
killed
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
soldiers
went
to
kill
and
be
killed
at
the
battle
of
Borodino
*NL*
not
because
of
Napoleon
's
orders
but
by
their
own
volition
.
The
whole
*NL*
army
--
French
,
Italian
,
German
,
Polish
,
and
Dutch
--
hungry
,
ragged
,
and
*NL*
weary
of
the
campaign
,
felt
at
the
sight
of
an
army
blocking
their
road
*NL*
to
Moscow
that
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
be
drunk
.
Had
Napoleon
then
*NL*
forbidden
them
to
fight
the
Russians
,
they
would
have
killed
him
and
*NL*
have
proceeded
to
fight
the
Russians
because
it
was
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
heard
Napoleon
's
proclamation
offering
them
,
as
compensation
*NL*
for
mutilation
and
death
,
the
words
of
posterity
about
their
having
been
*NL*
in
the
battle
before
Moscow
,
they
cried
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
just
as
they
*NL*
had
cried
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
at
the
sight
of
the
portrait
of
the
boy
*NL*
piercing
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
toy
stick
,
and
just
as
they
would
*NL*
have
cried
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
at
any
nonsense
that
might
be
told
them
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
cry
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
and
go
*NL*
to
fight
,
in
order
to
get
food
and
rest
as
conquerors
in
Moscow
.
So
it
*NL*
was
not
because
of
Napoleon
's
commands
that
they
killed
their
fellow
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
not
Napoleon
who
directed
the
course
of
the
battle
,
for
none
*NL*
of
his
orders
were
executed
and
during
the
battle
he
did
not
know
what
*NL*
was
going
on
before
him
.
So
the
way
in
which
these
people
killed
one
*NL*
another
was
not
decided
by
Napoleon
's
will
but
occurred
independently
of
*NL*
him
,
in
accord
with
the
will
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
took
*NL*
part
in
the
common
action
.
It
only
seemed
to
Napoleon
that
it
all
took
*NL*
place
by
his
will
.
And
so
the
question
whether
he
had
or
had
not
a
cold
*NL*
has
no
more
historic
interest
than
the
cold
of
the
least
of
the
*NL*
transport
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
assertion
made
by
various
writers
that
his
cold
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
his
dispositions
not
being
as
well-planned
as
on
former
*NL*
occasions
,
and
of
his
orders
during
the
battle
not
being
as
good
as
*NL*
previously
,
is
quite
baseless
,
which
again
shows
that
Napoleon
's
cold
on
*NL*
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
was
unimportant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispositions
cited
above
are
not
at
all
worse
,
but
are
even
better
,
*NL*
than
previous
dispositions
by
which
he
had
won
victories
.
His
pseudo
-
*NL*
orders
during
the
battle
were
also
no
worse
than
formerly
,
but
much
the
*NL*
same
as
usual
.
These
dispositions
and
orders
only
seem
worse
than
*NL*
previous
ones
because
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
the
first
Napoleon
did
*NL*
not
win
.
The
profoundest
and
most
excellent
dispositions
and
orders
seem
*NL*
very
bad
,
and
every
learned
militarist
criticizes
them
with
looks
of
*NL*
importance
,
when
they
relate
to
a
battle
that
has
been
lost
,
and
the
*NL*
very
worst
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
good
,
and
serious
people
*NL*
fill
whole
volumes
to
demonstrate
their
merits
,
when
they
relate
to
a
*NL*
battle
that
has
been
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispositions
drawn
up
by
Weyrother
for
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
were
*NL*
a
model
of
perfection
for
that
kind
of
composition
,
but
still
they
were
*NL*
criticized
--
criticized
for
their
very
perfection
,
for
their
excessive
*NL*
minuteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
at
the
battle
of
Borodino
fulfilled
his
office
as
*NL*
representative
of
authority
as
well
as
,
and
even
better
than
,
at
other
*NL*
battles
.
He
did
nothing
harmful
to
the
progress
of
the
battle
;
he
*NL*
inclined
to
the
most
reasonable
opinions
,
he
made
no
confusion
,
did
not
*NL*
contradict
himself
,
did
not
get
frightened
or
run
away
from
the
field
of
*NL*
battle
,
but
with
his
great
tact
and
military
experience
carried
out
his
*NL*
role
of
appearing
to
command
,
calmly
and
with
dignity
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
from
a
second
inspection
of
the
lines
,
Napoleon
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chessmen
are
set
up
,
the
game
will
begin
tomorrow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ordered
punch
and
summoned
de
Beausset
,
he
began
to
talk
to
him
*NL*
about
Paris
and
about
some
changes
he
meant
to
make
in
the
Empress
'
*NL*
household
,
surprising
the
prefect
by
his
memory
of
minute
details
*NL*
relating
to
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
an
interest
in
trifles
,
joked
about
de
Beausset
's
love
of
*NL*
travel
,
and
chatted
carelessly
,
as
a
famous
,
self-confident
surgeon
who
*NL*
knows
his
job
does
when
turning
up
his
sleeves
and
putting
on
his
apron
*NL*
while
a
patient
is
being
strapped
to
the
operating
table
.
``
The
matter
is
*NL*
in
my
hands
and
is
clear
and
definite
in
my
head
.
When
the
time
comes
to
*NL*
set
to
work
I
shall
do
it
as
no
one
else
could
,
but
now
I
can
jest
,
and
*NL*
the
more
I
jest
and
the
calmer
I
am
the
more
tranquil
and
confident
you
*NL*
ought
to
be
,
and
the
more
amazed
at
my
genius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
his
second
glass
of
punch
,
Napoleon
went
to
rest
before
*NL*
the
serious
business
which
,
he
considered
,
awaited
him
next
day
.
He
was
*NL*
so
much
interested
in
that
task
that
he
was
unable
to
sleep
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
cold
which
had
grown
worse
from
the
dampness
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
he
went
into
the
large
division
of
the
tent
at
three
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
loudly
blowing
his
nose
.
He
asked
whether
the
Russians
had
*NL*
not
withdrawn
,
and
was
told
that
the
enemy
's
fires
were
still
in
the
*NL*
same
places
.
He
nodded
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
in
attendance
came
into
the
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Rapp
,
do
you
think
we
shall
do
good
business
today
?
''
Napoleon
*NL*
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
,
sire
,
''
replied
Rapp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
,
sire
,
what
you
did
me
the
honor
to
say
at
Smolensk
?
''
*NL*
continued
Rapp
.
``
The
wine
is
drawn
and
must
be
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
frowned
and
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
leaning
his
head
on
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
poor
army
!
''
he
suddenly
remarked
.
``
It
has
diminished
greatly
since
*NL*
Smolensk
.
Fortune
is
frankly
a
courtesan
,
Rapp
.
I
have
always
said
so
*NL*
and
I
am
beginning
to
experience
it
.
But
the
Guards
,
Rapp
,
the
Guards
*NL*
are
intact
?
''
he
remarked
interrogatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
''
replied
Rapp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
took
a
lozenge
,
put
it
in
his
mouth
,
and
glanced
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
He
was
not
sleepy
and
it
was
still
not
nearly
morning
.
It
was
impossible
*NL*
to
give
further
orders
for
the
sake
of
killing
time
,
for
the
orders
had
*NL*
all
been
given
and
were
now
being
executed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
the
biscuits
and
rice
been
served
out
to
the
regiments
of
the
*NL*
Guards
?
''
asked
Napoleon
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rice
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rapp
replied
that
he
had
given
the
Emperor
's
order
about
the
rice
,
but
*NL*
Napoleon
shook
his
head
in
dissatisfaction
as
if
not
believing
that
his
*NL*
order
had
been
executed
.
An
attendant
came
in
with
punch
.
Napoleon
*NL*
ordered
another
glass
to
be
brought
for
Rapp
,
and
silently
sipped
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
neither
taste
nor
smell
,
''
he
remarked
,
sniffing
at
his
glass
.
*NL*
``
This
cold
is
tiresome
.
They
talk
about
medicine
--
what
is
the
good
of
*NL*
medicine
when
it
ca
n't
cure
a
cold
!
Corvisart
gave
me
these
lozenges
but
*NL*
they
do
n't
help
at
all
.
What
can
doctors
cure
?
One
ca
n't
cure
anything
.
*NL*
Our
body
is
a
machine
for
living
.
It
is
organized
for
that
,
it
is
its
*NL*
nature
.
Let
life
go
on
in
it
unhindered
and
let
it
defend
itself
,
it
*NL*
will
do
more
than
if
you
paralyze
it
by
encumbering
it
with
remedies
.
*NL*
Our
body
is
like
a
perfect
watch
that
should
go
for
a
certain
time
;
the
*NL*
watchmaker
can
not
open
it
,
he
can
only
adjust
it
by
fumbling
,
and
that
*NL*
blindfold
...
Yes
,
our
body
is
just
a
machine
for
living
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
entered
on
the
path
of
definition
,
of
which
he
was
fond
,
*NL*
Napoleon
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
gave
a
new
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Rapp
,
what
military
art
is
?
''
asked
he
.
``
It
is
the
art
of
*NL*
being
stronger
than
the
enemy
at
a
given
moment
.
That
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rapp
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
we
shall
have
to
deal
with
Kutuzov
!
''
said
Napoleon
.
``
We
shall
*NL*
see
!
Do
you
remember
at
Braunau
he
commanded
an
army
for
three
weeks
and
*NL*
did
not
once
mount
a
horse
to
inspect
his
entrenchments
...
We
shall
*NL*
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
It
was
still
only
four
o'clock
.
He
did
not
feel
*NL*
sleepy
.
The
punch
was
finished
and
there
was
still
nothing
to
do
.
He
*NL*
rose
,
walked
to
and
fro
,
put
on
a
warm
overcoat
and
a
hat
,
and
went
out
*NL*
of
the
tent
.
The
night
was
dark
and
damp
,
a
scarcely
perceptible
*NL*
moisture
was
descending
from
above
.
Near
by
,
the
campfires
were
dimly
*NL*
burning
among
the
French
Guards
,
and
in
the
distance
those
of
the
*NL*
Russian
line
shone
through
the
smoke
.
The
weather
was
calm
,
and
the
*NL*
rustle
and
tramp
of
the
French
troops
already
beginning
to
move
to
take
*NL*
up
their
positions
were
clearly
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
walked
about
in
front
of
his
tent
,
looked
at
the
fires
and
*NL*
listened
to
these
sounds
,
and
as
he
was
passing
a
tall
guardsman
in
a
*NL*
shaggy
cap
,
who
was
standing
sentinel
before
his
tent
and
had
drawn
*NL*
himself
up
like
a
black
pillar
at
sight
of
the
Emperor
,
Napoleon
stopped
*NL*
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
year
did
you
enter
the
service
?
''
he
asked
with
that
affectation
of
*NL*
military
bluntness
and
geniality
with
which
he
always
addressed
the
*NL*
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
answered
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
One
of
the
old
ones
!
Has
your
regiment
had
its
rice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
,
Your
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
nodded
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
five
Napoleon
rode
to
the
village
of
Shevardino
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
growing
light
,
the
sky
was
clearing
,
only
a
single
cloud
lay
in
*NL*
the
east
.
The
abandoned
campfires
were
burning
themselves
out
in
the
*NL*
faint
morning
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
right
a
single
deep
report
of
a
cannon
resounded
and
died
away
in
*NL*
the
prevailing
silence
.
Some
minutes
passed
.
A
second
and
a
third
report
*NL*
shook
the
air
,
then
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
boomed
solemnly
near
by
on
the
*NL*
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
shots
had
not
yet
ceased
to
reverberate
before
others
rang
out
*NL*
and
yet
more
were
heard
mingling
with
and
overtaking
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
with
his
suite
rode
up
to
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
where
he
*NL*
dismounted
.
The
game
had
begun
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
to
Gorki
after
having
seen
Prince
Andrew
,
Pierre
ordered
*NL*
his
groom
to
get
the
horses
ready
and
to
call
him
early
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
then
immediately
fell
asleep
behind
a
partition
in
a
corner
Boris
*NL*
had
given
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
was
thoroughly
awake
next
morning
everybody
had
already
left
*NL*
the
hut
.
The
panes
were
rattling
in
the
little
windows
and
his
groom
was
*NL*
shaking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
!
Your
excellency
!
Your
excellency
!
''
he
kept
repeating
*NL*
pertinaciously
while
he
shook
Pierre
by
the
shoulder
without
looking
at
*NL*
him
,
having
apparently
lost
hope
of
getting
him
to
wake
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Has
it
begun
?
Is
it
time
?
''
Pierre
asked
,
waking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
the
firing
,
''
said
the
groom
,
a
discharged
soldier
.
``
All
the
*NL*
gentlemen
have
gone
out
,
and
his
Serene
Highness
himself
rode
past
long
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
dressed
hastily
and
ran
out
to
the
porch
.
Outside
all
was
bright
,
*NL*
fresh
,
dewy
,
and
cheerful
.
The
sun
,
just
bursting
forth
from
behind
a
*NL*
cloud
that
had
concealed
it
,
was
shining
,
with
rays
still
half
broken
by
*NL*
the
clouds
,
over
the
roofs
of
the
street
opposite
,
on
the
dew
-
*NL*
besprinkled
dust
of
the
road
,
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
,
on
the
*NL*
windows
,
the
fence
,
and
on
Pierre
's
horses
standing
before
the
hut
.
The
*NL*
roar
of
guns
sounded
more
distinct
outside
.
An
adjutant
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
Cossack
passed
by
at
a
sharp
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
,
Count
;
it
's
time
!
''
cried
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Telling
the
groom
to
follow
him
with
the
horses
,
Pierre
went
down
the
*NL*
street
to
the
knoll
from
which
he
had
looked
at
the
field
of
battle
the
*NL*
day
before
.
A
crowd
of
military
men
was
assembled
there
,
members
of
the
*NL*
staff
could
be
heard
conversing
in
French
,
and
Kutuzov
's
gray
head
in
a
*NL*
white
cap
with
a
red
band
was
visible
,
his
gray
nape
sunk
between
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
He
was
looking
through
a
field
glass
down
the
highroad
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mounting
the
steps
to
the
knoll
Pierre
looked
at
the
scene
before
him
,
*NL*
spellbound
by
beauty
.
It
was
the
same
panorama
he
had
admired
from
that
*NL*
spot
the
day
before
,
but
now
the
whole
place
was
full
of
troops
and
*NL*
covered
by
smoke
clouds
from
the
guns
,
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
*NL*
bright
sun
,
rising
slightly
to
the
left
behind
Pierre
,
cast
upon
it
*NL*
through
the
clear
morning
air
penetrating
streaks
of
rosy
,
golden-tinted
*NL*
light
and
long
dark
shadows
.
The
forest
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
*NL*
panorama
seemed
carved
in
some
precious
stone
of
a
yellowish-green
*NL*
color
;
its
undulating
outline
was
silhouetted
against
the
horizon
and
*NL*
was
pierced
beyond
Valuevo
by
the
Smolensk
highroad
crowded
with
troops
.
*NL*
Nearer
at
hand
glittered
golden
cornfields
interspersed
with
copses
.
*NL*
There
were
troops
to
be
seen
everywhere
,
in
front
and
to
the
right
and
*NL*
left
.
All
this
was
vivid
,
majestic
,
and
unexpected
;
but
what
impressed
*NL*
Pierre
most
of
all
was
the
view
of
the
battlefield
itself
,
of
Borodino
*NL*
and
the
hollows
on
both
sides
of
the
Kolocha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
Kolocha
,
in
Borodino
and
on
both
sides
of
it
,
especially
to
*NL*
the
left
where
the
Voyna
flowing
between
its
marshy
banks
falls
into
the
*NL*
Kolocha
,
a
mist
had
spread
which
seemed
to
melt
,
to
dissolve
,
and
to
*NL*
become
translucent
when
the
brilliant
sun
appeared
and
magically
colored
*NL*
and
outlined
everything
.
The
smoke
of
the
guns
mingled
with
this
mist
,
*NL*
and
over
the
whole
expanse
and
through
that
mist
the
rays
of
the
morning
*NL*
sun
were
reflected
,
flashing
back
like
lightning
from
the
water
,
from
*NL*
the
dew
,
and
from
the
bayonets
of
the
troops
crowded
together
by
the
*NL*
riverbanks
and
in
Borodino
.
A
white
church
could
be
seen
through
the
*NL*
mist
,
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
of
huts
in
Borodino
as
well
as
dense
*NL*
masses
of
soldiers
,
or
green
ammunition
chests
and
ordnance
.
And
all
*NL*
this
moved
,
or
seemed
to
move
,
as
the
smoke
and
mist
spread
out
over
the
*NL*
whole
space
.
Just
as
in
the
mist-enveloped
hollow
near
Borodino
,
so
*NL*
along
the
entire
line
outside
and
above
it
and
especially
in
the
woods
*NL*
and
fields
to
the
left
,
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
summits
of
the
high
*NL*
ground
,
clouds
of
powder
smoke
seemed
continually
to
spring
up
out
of
*NL*
nothing
,
now
singly
,
now
several
at
a
time
,
some
translucent
,
others
*NL*
dense
,
which
,
swelling
,
growing
,
rolling
,
and
blending
,
extended
over
*NL*
the
whole
expanse
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
puffs
of
smoke
and
-LRB-
strange
to
say
-RRB-
the
sound
of
the
firing
*NL*
produced
the
chief
beauty
of
the
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Puff
!
''
--
suddenly
a
round
compact
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
merging
from
*NL*
violet
into
gray
and
milky
white
,
and
``
boom
!
''
came
the
report
a
second
*NL*
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Puff
!
puff
!
''
--
and
two
clouds
arose
pushing
one
another
and
blending
*NL*
together
;
and
``
boom
,
boom
!
''
came
the
sounds
confirming
what
the
eye
had
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
glanced
round
at
the
first
cloud
,
which
he
had
seen
as
a
round
*NL*
compact
ball
,
and
in
its
place
already
were
balloons
of
smoke
floating
*NL*
to
one
side
,
and
--
``
puff
''
-LRB-
with
a
pause
-RRB-
--
``
puff
,
puff
!
''
three
and
then
*NL*
four
more
appeared
and
then
from
each
,
with
the
same
interval
--
``
boom
--
*NL*
boom
,
boom
!
''
came
the
fine
,
firm
,
precise
sounds
in
reply
.
It
seemed
as
*NL*
if
those
smoke
clouds
sometimes
ran
and
sometimes
stood
still
while
*NL*
woods
,
fields
,
and
glittering
bayonets
ran
past
them
.
From
the
left
,
*NL*
over
fields
and
bushes
,
those
large
balls
of
smoke
were
continually
*NL*
appearing
followed
by
their
solemn
reports
,
while
nearer
still
,
in
the
*NL*
hollows
and
woods
,
there
burst
from
the
muskets
small
cloudlets
that
had
*NL*
no
time
to
become
balls
,
but
had
their
little
echoes
in
just
the
same
*NL*
way
.
``
Trakh-ta-ta-takh
!
''
came
the
frequent
crackle
of
musketry
,
but
it
*NL*
was
irregular
and
feeble
in
comparison
with
the
reports
of
the
cannon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
wished
to
be
there
with
that
smoke
,
those
shining
bayonets
,
that
*NL*
movement
,
and
those
sounds
.
He
turned
to
look
at
Kutuzov
and
his
suite
,
*NL*
to
compare
his
impressions
with
those
of
others
.
They
were
all
looking
*NL*
at
the
field
of
battle
as
he
was
,
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
with
the
*NL*
same
feelings
.
All
their
faces
were
now
shining
with
that
latent
warmth
*NL*
of
feeling
Pierre
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
had
fully
understood
*NL*
after
his
talk
with
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
dear
fellow
,
go
...
and
Christ
be
with
you
!
''
Kutuzov
was
saying
*NL*
to
a
general
who
stood
beside
him
,
not
taking
his
eye
from
the
*NL*
battlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
received
this
order
the
general
passed
by
Pierre
on
his
way
down
*NL*
the
knoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
crossing
!
''
said
the
general
coldly
and
sternly
in
reply
to
one
*NL*
of
the
staff
who
asked
where
he
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
there
too
,
I
too
!
''
thought
Pierre
,
and
followed
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
mounted
a
horse
a
Cossack
had
brought
him
.
Pierre
went
to
*NL*
his
groom
who
was
holding
his
horses
and
,
asking
which
was
the
quietest
,
*NL*
clambered
onto
it
,
seized
it
by
the
mane
,
and
turning
out
his
toes
*NL*
pressed
his
heels
against
its
sides
and
,
feeling
that
his
spectacles
*NL*
were
slipping
off
but
unable
to
let
go
of
the
mane
and
reins
,
he
*NL*
galloped
after
the
general
,
causing
the
staff
officers
to
smile
as
they
*NL*
watched
him
from
the
knoll
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
Having
descended
the
hill
the
general
after
whom
Pierre
was
galloping
*NL*
turned
sharply
to
the
left
,
and
Pierre
,
losing
sight
of
him
,
galloped
in
*NL*
among
some
ranks
of
infantry
marching
ahead
of
him
.
He
tried
to
pass
*NL*
either
in
front
of
them
or
to
the
right
or
left
,
but
there
were
soldiers
*NL*
everywhere
,
all
with
the
same
preoccupied
expression
and
busy
with
some
*NL*
unseen
but
evidently
important
task
.
They
all
gazed
with
the
same
*NL*
dissatisfied
and
inquiring
expression
at
this
stout
man
in
a
white
hat
,
*NL*
who
for
some
unknown
reason
threatened
to
trample
them
under
his
horse
's
*NL*
hoofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ride
into
the
middle
of
the
battalion
?
''
one
of
them
shouted
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
prodded
his
horse
with
the
butt
end
of
a
musket
,
and
Pierre
,
*NL*
bending
over
his
saddlebow
and
hardly
able
to
control
his
shying
horse
,
*NL*
galloped
ahead
of
the
soldiers
where
there
was
a
free
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
bridge
ahead
of
him
,
where
other
soldiers
stood
firing
.
*NL*
Pierre
rode
up
to
them
.
Without
being
aware
of
it
he
had
come
to
the
*NL*
bridge
across
the
Kolocha
between
Gorki
and
Borodino
,
which
the
French
*NL*
-LRB-
having
occupied
Borodino
-RRB-
were
attacking
in
the
first
phase
of
the
*NL*
battle
.
Pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
bridge
in
front
of
him
and
that
*NL*
soldiers
were
doing
something
on
both
sides
of
it
and
in
the
meadow
,
*NL*
among
the
rows
of
new-mown
hay
which
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
amid
the
*NL*
smoke
of
the
campfires
the
day
before
;
but
despite
the
incessant
firing
*NL*
going
on
there
he
had
no
idea
that
this
was
the
field
of
battle
.
He
did
*NL*
not
notice
the
sound
of
the
bullets
whistling
from
every
side
,
or
the
*NL*
projectiles
that
flew
over
him
,
did
not
see
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
river
,
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
notice
the
killed
and
wounded
,
*NL*
though
many
fell
near
him
.
He
looked
about
him
with
a
smile
which
did
*NL*
not
leave
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
's
that
fellow
in
front
of
the
line
?
''
shouted
somebody
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
left
!
...
Keep
to
the
right
!
''
the
men
shouted
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
to
the
right
,
and
unexpectedly
encountered
one
of
Raevski
's
*NL*
adjutants
whom
he
knew
.
The
adjutant
looked
angrily
at
him
,
evidently
*NL*
also
intending
to
shout
at
him
,
but
on
recognizing
him
he
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
got
here
?
''
he
said
,
and
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
feeling
out
of
place
there
,
having
nothing
to
do
,
and
afraid
of
*NL*
getting
in
someone
's
way
again
,
galloped
after
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
happening
here
?
May
I
come
with
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
one
moment
!
''
replied
the
adjutant
,
and
riding
up
to
a
stout
*NL*
colonel
who
was
standing
in
the
meadow
,
he
gave
him
some
message
and
*NL*
then
addressed
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
come
here
,
Count
?
''
he
asked
with
a
smile
.
``
Still
*NL*
inquisitive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
assented
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
adjutant
turned
his
horse
about
and
rode
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
's
tolerable
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
with
Bagration
on
the
left
flank
*NL*
they
're
getting
it
frightfully
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Where
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
with
me
to
our
knoll
.
We
can
get
a
view
from
there
and
in
*NL*
our
battery
it
is
still
bearable
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
``
Will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'll
come
with
you
,
''
replied
Pierre
,
looking
round
for
his
groom
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
now
that
he
noticed
wounded
men
staggering
along
or
being
*NL*
carried
on
stretchers
.
On
that
very
meadow
he
had
ridden
over
the
day
*NL*
before
,
a
soldier
was
lying
athwart
the
rows
of
scented
hay
,
with
his
*NL*
head
thrown
awkwardly
back
and
his
shako
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
n't
they
carried
him
away
?
''
Pierre
was
about
to
ask
,
but
seeing
*NL*
the
stern
expression
of
the
adjutant
who
was
also
looking
that
way
,
he
*NL*
checked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
find
his
groom
and
rode
along
the
hollow
with
the
*NL*
adjutant
to
Raevski
's
Redoubt
.
His
horse
lagged
behind
the
adjutant
's
*NL*
and
jolted
him
at
every
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
seem
to
be
used
to
riding
,
Count
?
''
remarked
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
it
's
not
that
,
but
her
action
seems
so
jerky
,
''
said
Pierre
in
a
*NL*
puzzled
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
...
she
's
wounded
!
''
said
the
adjutant
.
``
In
the
off
foreleg
above
the
*NL*
knee
.
A
bullet
,
no
doubt
.
I
congratulate
you
,
Count
,
on
your
baptism
of
*NL*
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ridden
in
the
smoke
past
the
Sixth
Corps
,
behind
the
artillery
*NL*
which
had
been
moved
forward
and
was
in
action
,
deafening
them
with
the
*NL*
noise
of
firing
,
they
came
to
a
small
wood
.
There
it
was
cool
and
quiet
,
*NL*
with
a
scent
of
autumn
.
Pierre
and
the
adjutant
dismounted
and
walked
up
*NL*
the
hill
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
general
here
?
''
asked
the
adjutant
on
reaching
the
knoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
here
a
minute
ago
but
has
just
gone
that
way
,
''
someone
told
him
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
looked
at
Pierre
as
if
puzzled
what
to
do
with
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
about
me
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
I
'll
go
up
onto
the
knoll
if
I
*NL*
may
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
do
.
You
'll
see
everything
from
there
and
it
's
less
dangerous
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
come
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
to
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
on
.
They
did
not
meet
*NL*
again
,
and
only
much
later
did
Pierre
learn
that
he
lost
an
arm
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knoll
to
which
Pierre
ascended
was
that
famous
one
afterwards
known
*NL*
to
the
Russians
as
the
Knoll
Battery
or
Raevski
's
Redoubt
,
and
to
the
*NL*
French
as
la
grande
redoute
,
la
fatale
redoute
,
la
redoute
du
centre
,
*NL*
around
which
tens
of
thousands
fell
,
and
which
the
French
regarded
as
*NL*
the
key
to
the
whole
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
redoubt
consisted
of
a
knoll
,
on
three
sides
of
which
trenches
had
*NL*
been
dug
.
Within
the
entrenchment
stood
ten
guns
that
were
being
fired
*NL*
through
openings
in
the
earthwork
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
line
with
the
knoll
on
both
sides
stood
other
guns
which
also
fired
*NL*
incessantly
.
A
little
behind
the
guns
stood
infantry
.
When
ascending
*NL*
that
knoll
Pierre
had
no
notion
that
this
spot
,
on
which
small
trenches
*NL*
had
been
dug
and
from
which
a
few
guns
were
firing
,
was
the
most
*NL*
important
point
of
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
just
because
he
happened
to
be
there
he
thought
it
one
*NL*
of
the
least
significant
parts
of
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
reached
the
knoll
,
Pierre
sat
down
at
one
end
of
a
trench
*NL*
surrounding
the
battery
and
gazed
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
with
*NL*
an
unconsciously
happy
smile
.
Occasionally
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
*NL*
battery
still
with
that
same
smile
,
trying
not
to
obstruct
the
soldiers
*NL*
who
were
loading
,
hauling
the
guns
,
and
continually
running
past
him
*NL*
with
bags
and
charges
.
The
guns
of
that
battery
were
being
fired
*NL*
continually
one
after
another
with
a
deafening
roar
,
enveloping
the
*NL*
whole
neighborhood
in
powder
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
contrast
with
the
dread
felt
by
the
infantrymen
placed
in
support
,
*NL*
here
in
the
battery
where
a
small
number
of
men
busy
at
their
work
were
*NL*
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
trench
,
everyone
experienced
a
common
and
*NL*
as
it
were
family
feeling
of
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intrusion
of
Pierre
's
nonmilitary
figure
in
a
white
hat
made
an
*NL*
unpleasant
impression
at
first
.
The
soldiers
looked
askance
at
him
with
*NL*
surprise
and
even
alarm
as
they
went
past
him
.
The
senior
artillery
*NL*
officer
,
a
tall
,
long-legged
,
pockmarked
man
,
moved
over
to
Pierre
as
if
*NL*
to
see
the
action
of
the
farthest
gun
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
round-faced
officer
,
quite
a
boy
still
and
evidently
only
just
*NL*
out
of
the
Cadet
College
,
who
was
zealously
commanding
the
two
guns
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
,
addressed
Pierre
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
permit
me
to
ask
you
to
stand
aside
.
You
must
not
be
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
as
they
looked
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
But
when
they
had
convinced
themselves
that
this
man
in
the
white
hat
*NL*
was
doing
no
harm
,
but
either
sat
quietly
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
*NL*
with
a
shy
smile
or
,
politely
making
way
for
the
soldiers
,
paced
up
and
*NL*
down
the
battery
under
fire
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
on
a
boulevard
,
*NL*
their
feeling
of
hostile
distrust
gradually
began
to
change
into
a
*NL*
kindly
and
bantering
sympathy
,
such
as
soldiers
feel
for
their
dogs
,
*NL*
cocks
,
goats
,
and
in
general
for
the
animals
that
live
with
the
*NL*
regiment
.
The
men
soon
accepted
Pierre
into
their
family
,
adopted
him
,
*NL*
gave
him
a
nickname
-LRB-
``
our
gentleman
''
-RRB-
,
and
made
kindly
fun
of
him
among
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shell
tore
up
the
earth
two
paces
from
Pierre
and
he
looked
around
*NL*
with
a
smile
as
he
brushed
from
his
clothes
some
earth
it
had
thrown
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
it
you
're
not
afraid
,
sir
,
really
now
?
''
a
red-faced
,
broad
-
*NL*
shouldered
soldier
asked
Pierre
,
with
a
grin
that
disclosed
a
set
of
*NL*
sound
,
white
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
afraid
,
then
?
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
do
you
expect
?
''
answered
the
soldier
.
``
She
has
no
mercy
,
you
*NL*
know
!
When
she
comes
spluttering
down
,
out
go
your
innards
.
One
ca
n't
*NL*
help
being
afraid
,
''
he
said
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
the
men
,
with
bright
kindly
faces
,
stopped
beside
Pierre
.
*NL*
They
seemed
not
to
have
expected
him
to
talk
like
anybody
else
,
and
the
*NL*
discovery
that
he
did
so
delighted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
business
of
us
soldiers
.
But
in
a
gentleman
it
's
wonderful
!
*NL*
There
's
a
gentleman
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
your
places
!
''
cried
the
young
officer
to
the
men
gathered
round
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
was
evidently
exercising
his
duties
for
the
first
or
*NL*
second
time
and
therefore
treated
both
his
superiors
and
the
men
with
*NL*
great
precision
and
formality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
booming
cannonade
and
the
fusillade
of
musketry
were
growing
more
*NL*
intense
over
the
whole
field
,
especially
to
the
left
where
Bagration
's
*NL*
fleches
were
,
but
where
Pierre
was
the
smoke
of
the
firing
made
it
*NL*
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
.
Moreover
,
his
whole
attention
*NL*
was
engrossed
by
watching
the
family
circle
--
separated
from
all
else
--
*NL*
formed
by
the
men
in
the
battery
.
His
first
unconscious
feeling
of
*NL*
joyful
animation
produced
by
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
battlefield
*NL*
was
now
replaced
by
another
,
especially
since
he
had
seen
that
soldier
*NL*
lying
alone
in
the
hayfield
.
Now
,
seated
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
,
he
*NL*
observed
the
faces
of
those
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
ten
o'clock
some
twenty
men
had
already
been
carried
away
from
the
*NL*
battery
;
two
guns
were
smashed
and
cannon
balls
fell
more
and
more
*NL*
frequently
on
the
battery
and
spent
bullets
buzzed
and
whistled
around
.
*NL*
But
the
men
in
the
battery
seemed
not
to
notice
this
,
and
merry
voices
*NL*
and
jokes
were
heard
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
live
one
!
''
shouted
a
man
as
a
whistling
shell
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
this
way
!
To
the
infantry
!
''
added
another
with
loud
laughter
,
*NL*
seeing
the
shell
fly
past
and
fall
into
the
ranks
of
the
supports
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
bowing
to
a
friend
,
eh
?
''
remarked
another
,
chaffing
a
peasant
*NL*
who
ducked
low
as
a
cannon
ball
flew
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
soldiers
gathered
by
the
wall
of
the
trench
,
looking
out
to
see
*NL*
what
was
happening
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
withdrawn
the
front
line
,
it
has
retired
,
''
said
they
,
pointing
*NL*
over
the
earthwork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
your
own
business
,
''
an
old
sergeant
shouted
at
them
.
``
If
they
've
*NL*
retired
it
's
because
there
's
work
for
them
to
do
farther
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
sergeant
,
taking
one
of
the
men
by
the
shoulders
,
gave
him
a
*NL*
shove
with
his
knee
.
This
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
fifth
gun
,
wheel
it
up
!
''
came
shouts
from
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
all
together
,
like
bargees
!
''
rose
the
merry
voices
of
those
*NL*
who
were
moving
the
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
nearly
knocked
our
gentleman
's
hat
off
!
''
cried
the
red-faced
*NL*
humorist
,
showing
his
teeth
chaffing
Pierre
.
``
Awkward
baggage
!
''
he
added
*NL*
reproachfully
to
a
cannon
ball
that
struck
a
cannon
wheel
and
a
man
's
*NL*
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
you
foxes
!
''
said
another
,
laughing
at
some
militiamen
who
,
*NL*
stooping
low
,
entered
the
battery
to
carry
away
the
wounded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
gruel
is
n't
to
your
taste
?
Oh
,
you
crows
!
You
're
scared
!
''
they
*NL*
shouted
at
the
militiamen
who
stood
hesitating
before
the
man
whose
leg
*NL*
had
been
torn
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
lads
...
oh
,
oh
!
''
they
mimicked
the
peasants
,
``
they
do
n't
like
it
*NL*
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
noticed
that
after
every
ball
that
hit
the
redoubt
,
and
after
*NL*
every
loss
,
the
liveliness
increased
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
flames
of
the
fire
hidden
within
come
more
and
more
vividly
and
*NL*
rapidly
from
an
approaching
thundercloud
,
so
,
as
if
in
opposition
to
*NL*
what
was
taking
place
,
the
lightning
of
hidden
fire
growing
more
and
*NL*
more
intense
glowed
in
the
faces
of
these
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
look
out
at
the
battlefield
and
was
not
concerned
to
know
*NL*
what
was
happening
there
;
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
watching
this
fire
*NL*
which
burned
ever
more
brightly
and
which
he
felt
was
flaming
up
in
the
*NL*
same
way
in
his
own
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
the
infantry
that
had
been
among
the
bushes
in
front
of
*NL*
the
battery
and
along
the
Kamenka
streamlet
retreated
.
From
the
battery
*NL*
they
could
be
seen
running
back
past
it
carrying
their
wounded
on
their
*NL*
muskets
.
A
general
with
his
suite
came
to
the
battery
,
and
after
*NL*
speaking
to
the
colonel
gave
Pierre
an
angry
look
and
went
away
again
*NL*
having
ordered
the
infantry
supports
behind
the
battery
to
lie
down
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
less
exposed
to
fire
.
After
this
from
amid
the
ranks
of
*NL*
infantry
to
the
right
of
the
battery
came
the
sound
of
a
drum
and
shouts
*NL*
of
command
,
and
from
the
battery
one
saw
how
those
ranks
of
infantry
*NL*
moved
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
over
the
wall
of
the
trench
and
was
particularly
struck
by
*NL*
a
pale
young
officer
who
,
letting
his
sword
hang
down
,
was
walking
*NL*
backwards
and
kept
glancing
uneasily
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ranks
of
the
infantry
disappeared
amid
the
smoke
but
their
long
-
*NL*
drawn
shout
and
rapid
musketry
firing
could
still
be
heard
.
A
few
*NL*
minutes
later
crowds
of
wounded
men
and
stretcher-bearers
came
back
from
*NL*
that
direction
.
Projectiles
began
to
fall
still
more
frequently
in
the
*NL*
battery
.
Several
men
were
lying
about
who
had
not
been
removed
.
Around
*NL*
the
cannon
the
men
moved
still
more
briskly
and
busily
.
No
one
any
*NL*
longer
took
notice
of
Pierre
.
Once
or
twice
he
was
shouted
at
for
being
*NL*
in
the
way
.
The
senior
officer
moved
with
big
,
rapid
strides
from
one
*NL*
gun
to
another
with
a
frowning
face
.
The
young
officer
,
with
his
face
*NL*
still
more
flushed
,
commanded
the
men
more
scrupulously
than
ever
.
The
*NL*
soldiers
handed
up
the
charges
,
turned
,
loaded
,
and
did
their
business
*NL*
with
strained
smartness
.
They
gave
little
jumps
as
they
walked
,
as
*NL*
though
they
were
on
springs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stormcloud
had
come
upon
them
,
and
in
every
face
the
fire
which
*NL*
Pierre
had
watched
kindle
burned
up
brightly
.
Pierre
standing
beside
the
*NL*
commanding
officer
.
The
young
officer
,
his
hand
to
his
shako
,
ran
up
to
*NL*
his
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
to
report
,
sir
,
that
only
eight
rounds
are
left
.
Are
*NL*
we
to
continue
firing
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grapeshot
!
''
the
senior
shouted
,
without
answering
the
question
,
looking
*NL*
over
the
wall
of
the
trench
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
something
happened
:
the
young
officer
gave
a
gasp
and
bending
*NL*
double
sat
down
on
the
ground
like
a
bird
shot
on
the
wing
.
Everything
*NL*
became
strange
,
confused
,
and
misty
in
Pierre
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
cannon
ball
after
another
whistled
by
and
struck
the
earthwork
,
a
*NL*
soldier
,
or
a
gun
.
Pierre
,
who
had
not
noticed
these
sounds
before
,
now
*NL*
heard
nothing
else
.
On
the
right
of
the
battery
soldiers
shouting
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
were
running
not
forwards
but
backwards
,
it
seemed
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cannon
ball
struck
the
very
end
of
the
earth
work
by
which
he
was
*NL*
standing
,
crumbling
down
the
earth
;
a
black
ball
flashed
before
his
eyes
*NL*
and
at
the
same
instant
plumped
into
something
.
Some
militiamen
who
were
*NL*
entering
the
battery
ran
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
with
grapeshot
!
''
shouted
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
ran
up
to
the
officer
and
in
a
frightened
whisper
informed
*NL*
him
-LRB-
as
a
butler
at
dinner
informs
his
master
that
there
is
no
more
of
*NL*
some
wine
asked
for
-RRB-
that
there
were
no
more
charges
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scoundrels
!
What
are
they
doing
?
''
shouted
the
officer
,
turning
to
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
's
face
was
red
and
perspiring
and
his
eyes
glittered
under
*NL*
his
frowning
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
to
the
reserves
and
bring
up
the
ammunition
boxes
!
''
he
yelled
,
*NL*
angrily
avoiding
Pierre
with
his
eyes
and
speaking
to
his
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
,
without
answering
him
,
strode
across
to
the
opposite
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
fire
...
Wait
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
been
ordered
to
go
for
ammunition
stumbled
against
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
sir
,
this
is
no
place
for
you
,
''
said
he
,
and
ran
down
the
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
ran
after
him
,
avoiding
the
spot
where
the
young
officer
was
*NL*
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
cannon
ball
,
another
,
and
a
third
flew
over
him
,
falling
in
front
,
*NL*
beside
,
and
behind
him
.
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope
.
``
Where
am
I
going
?
''
*NL*
he
suddenly
asked
himself
when
he
was
already
near
the
green
ammunition
*NL*
wagons
.
He
halted
irresolutely
,
not
knowing
whether
to
return
or
go
on
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
terrible
concussion
threw
him
backwards
to
the
ground
.
At
the
*NL*
same
instant
he
was
dazzled
by
a
great
flash
of
flame
,
and
immediately
a
*NL*
deafening
roar
,
crackling
,
and
whistling
made
his
ears
tingle
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
to
himself
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
leaning
on
his
*NL*
hands
;
the
ammunition
wagons
he
had
been
approaching
no
longer
existed
,
*NL*
only
charred
green
boards
and
rags
littered
the
scorched
grass
,
and
a
*NL*
horse
,
dangling
fragments
of
its
shaft
behind
it
,
galloped
past
,
while
*NL*
another
horse
lay
,
like
Pierre
,
on
the
ground
,
uttering
prolonged
and
*NL*
piercing
cries
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
himself
with
terror
Pierre
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
battery
,
*NL*
as
to
the
only
refuge
from
the
horrors
that
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
earthwork
he
noticed
that
there
were
men
doing
something
*NL*
there
but
that
no
shots
were
being
fired
from
the
battery
.
He
had
no
*NL*
time
to
realize
who
these
men
were
.
He
saw
the
senior
officer
lying
on
*NL*
the
earth
wall
with
his
back
turned
as
if
he
were
examining
something
*NL*
down
below
and
that
one
of
the
soldiers
he
had
noticed
before
was
*NL*
struggling
forward
shouting
``
Brothers
!
''
and
trying
to
free
himself
from
*NL*
some
men
who
were
holding
him
by
the
arm
.
He
also
saw
something
else
*NL*
that
was
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
not
time
to
realize
that
the
colonel
had
been
killed
,
that
*NL*
the
soldier
shouting
``
Brothers
!
''
was
a
prisoner
,
and
that
another
man
*NL*
had
been
bayoneted
in
the
back
before
his
eyes
,
for
hardly
had
he
run
*NL*
into
the
redoubt
before
a
thin
,
sallow-faced
,
perspiring
man
in
a
blue
*NL*
uniform
rushed
on
him
sword
in
hand
,
shouting
something
.
Instinctively
*NL*
guarding
against
the
shock
--
for
they
had
been
running
together
at
full
*NL*
speed
before
they
saw
one
another
--
Pierre
put
out
his
hands
and
seized
*NL*
the
man
-LRB-
a
French
officer
-RRB-
by
the
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
by
the
*NL*
throat
with
the
other
.
The
officer
,
dropping
his
sword
,
seized
Pierre
by
*NL*
his
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
seconds
they
gazed
with
frightened
eyes
at
one
another
's
*NL*
unfamiliar
faces
and
both
were
perplexed
at
what
they
had
done
and
what
*NL*
they
were
to
do
next
.
``
Am
I
taken
prisoner
or
have
I
taken
him
*NL*
prisoner
?
''
each
was
thinking
.
But
the
French
officer
was
evidently
more
*NL*
inclined
to
think
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
because
Pierre
's
strong
*NL*
hand
,
impelled
by
instinctive
fear
,
squeezed
his
throat
ever
tighter
and
*NL*
tighter
.
The
Frenchman
was
about
to
say
something
,
when
just
above
their
*NL*
heads
,
terrible
and
low
,
a
cannon
ball
whistled
,
and
it
seemed
to
Pierre
*NL*
that
the
French
officer
's
head
had
been
torn
off
,
so
swiftly
had
he
*NL*
ducked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
too
bent
his
head
and
let
his
hands
fall
.
Without
further
thought
*NL*
as
to
who
had
taken
whom
prisoner
,
the
Frenchman
ran
back
to
the
battery
*NL*
and
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope
stumbling
over
the
dead
and
wounded
who
,
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
,
caught
at
his
feet
.
But
before
he
reached
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
knoll
he
was
met
by
a
dense
crowd
of
Russian
soldiers
who
,
*NL*
stumbling
,
tripping
up
,
and
shouting
,
ran
merrily
and
wildly
toward
the
*NL*
battery
.
-LRB-
This
was
the
attack
for
which
Ermolov
claimed
the
credit
,
*NL*
declaring
that
only
his
courage
and
good
luck
made
such
a
feat
possible
:
*NL*
it
was
the
attack
in
which
he
was
said
to
have
thrown
some
St.
George
's
*NL*
Crosses
he
had
in
his
pocket
into
the
battery
for
the
first
soldiers
to
*NL*
take
who
got
there
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
who
had
occupied
the
battery
fled
,
and
our
troops
shouting
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
pursued
them
so
far
beyond
the
battery
that
it
was
difficult
*NL*
to
call
them
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoners
were
brought
down
from
the
battery
and
among
them
was
a
*NL*
wounded
French
general
,
whom
the
officers
surrounded
.
Crowds
of
wounded
-
*NL*
-
some
known
to
Pierre
and
some
unknown
--
Russians
and
French
,
with
faces
*NL*
distorted
by
suffering
,
walked
,
crawled
,
and
were
carried
on
stretchers
*NL*
from
the
battery
.
Pierre
again
went
up
onto
the
knoll
where
he
had
spent
*NL*
over
an
hour
,
and
of
that
family
circle
which
had
received
him
as
a
*NL*
member
he
did
not
find
a
single
one
.
There
were
many
dead
whom
he
did
*NL*
not
know
,
but
some
he
recognized
.
The
young
officer
still
sat
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
bent
double
,
in
a
pool
of
blood
at
the
edge
of
the
earth
wall
.
*NL*
The
red-faced
man
was
still
twitching
,
but
they
did
not
carry
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
they
will
stop
it
,
now
they
will
be
horrified
at
what
they
have
*NL*
done
!
''
he
thought
,
aimlessly
going
toward
a
crowd
of
stretcher
bearers
*NL*
moving
from
the
battlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
behind
the
veil
of
smoke
the
sun
was
still
high
,
and
in
front
and
*NL*
especially
to
the
left
,
near
Semenovsk
,
something
seemed
to
be
seething
*NL*
in
the
smoke
,
and
the
roar
of
cannon
and
musketry
did
not
diminish
,
but
*NL*
even
increased
to
desperation
like
a
man
who
,
straining
himself
,
shrieks
*NL*
with
all
his
remaining
strength
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
fought
within
the
seven
*NL*
thousand
feet
between
Borodino
and
Bagration
's
fleches
.
Beyond
that
*NL*
space
there
was
,
on
the
one
side
,
a
demonstration
made
by
the
Russians
*NL*
with
Uvarov
's
cavalry
at
midday
,
and
on
the
other
side
,
beyond
Utitsa
,
*NL*
Poniatowski
's
collision
with
Tuchkov
;
but
these
two
were
detached
and
*NL*
feeble
actions
in
comparison
with
what
took
place
in
the
center
of
the
*NL*
battlefield
.
On
the
field
between
Borodino
and
the
fleches
,
beside
the
*NL*
wood
,
the
chief
action
of
the
day
took
place
on
an
open
space
visible
*NL*
from
both
sides
and
was
fought
in
the
simplest
and
most
artless
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
began
on
both
sides
with
a
cannonade
from
several
hundred
*NL*
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
when
the
whole
field
was
covered
with
smoke
,
two
divisions
,
*NL*
Campan
's
and
Dessaix
's
,
advanced
from
the
French
right
,
while
Murat
's
*NL*
troops
advanced
on
Borodino
from
their
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
where
Napoleon
was
standing
the
fleches
were
*NL*
two
thirds
of
a
mile
away
,
and
it
was
more
than
a
mile
as
the
crow
flies
*NL*
to
Borodino
,
so
that
Napoleon
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there
,
*NL*
especially
as
the
smoke
mingling
with
the
mist
hid
the
whole
locality
.
*NL*
The
soldiers
of
Dessaix
's
division
advancing
against
the
fleches
could
*NL*
only
be
seen
till
they
had
entered
the
hollow
that
lay
between
them
and
*NL*
the
fleches
.
As
soon
as
they
had
descended
into
that
hollow
,
the
smoke
*NL*
of
the
guns
and
musketry
on
the
fleches
grew
so
dense
that
it
covered
*NL*
the
whole
approach
on
that
side
of
it
.
Through
the
smoke
glimpses
could
*NL*
be
caught
of
something
black
--
probably
men
--
and
at
times
the
glint
of
*NL*
bayonets
.
But
whether
they
were
moving
or
stationary
,
whether
they
were
*NL*
French
or
Russian
,
could
not
be
discovered
from
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
risen
brightly
and
its
slanting
rays
struck
straight
into
*NL*
Napoleon
's
face
as
,
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
fleches
.
The
smoke
spread
out
before
them
,
and
at
times
it
looked
as
if
*NL*
the
smoke
were
moving
,
at
times
as
if
the
troops
moved
.
Sometimes
shouts
*NL*
were
heard
through
the
firing
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
*NL*
being
done
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
standing
on
the
knoll
,
looked
through
a
field
glass
,
and
in
*NL*
its
small
circlet
saw
smoke
and
men
,
sometimes
his
own
and
sometimes
*NL*
Russians
,
but
when
he
looked
again
with
the
naked
eye
,
he
could
not
tell
*NL*
where
what
he
had
seen
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
the
knoll
and
began
walking
up
and
down
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
he
stopped
,
listened
to
the
firing
,
and
gazed
intently
at
*NL*
the
battlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
only
was
it
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
happening
from
where
*NL*
he
was
standing
down
below
,
or
from
the
knoll
above
on
which
some
of
his
*NL*
generals
had
taken
their
stand
,
but
even
from
the
fleches
themselves
--
in
*NL*
which
by
this
time
there
were
now
Russian
and
now
French
soldiers
,
*NL*
alternately
or
together
,
dead
,
wounded
,
alive
,
frightened
,
or
maddened
--
*NL*
even
at
those
fleches
themselves
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
*NL*
taking
place
.
There
for
several
hours
amid
incessant
cannon
and
musketry
*NL*
fire
,
now
Russians
were
seen
alone
,
now
Frenchmen
alone
,
now
infantry
,
*NL*
and
now
cavalry
:
they
appeared
,
fired
,
fell
,
collided
,
not
knowing
what
*NL*
to
do
with
one
another
,
screamed
,
and
ran
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
battlefield
adjutants
he
had
sent
out
,
and
orderlies
from
his
*NL*
marshals
,
kept
galloping
up
to
Napoleon
with
reports
of
the
progress
of
*NL*
the
action
,
but
all
these
reports
were
false
,
both
because
it
was
*NL*
impossible
in
the
heat
of
battle
to
say
what
was
happening
at
any
given
*NL*
moment
and
because
many
of
the
adjutants
did
not
go
to
the
actual
place
*NL*
of
conflict
but
reported
what
they
had
heard
from
others
;
and
also
*NL*
because
while
an
adjutant
was
riding
more
than
a
mile
to
Napoleon
*NL*
circumstances
changed
and
the
news
he
brought
was
already
becoming
*NL*
false
.
Thus
an
adjutant
galloped
up
from
Murat
with
tidings
that
*NL*
Borodino
had
been
occupied
and
the
bridge
over
the
Kolocha
was
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
French
.
The
adjutant
asked
whether
Napoleon
wished
the
*NL*
troops
to
cross
it
?
Napoleon
gave
orders
that
the
troops
should
form
up
*NL*
on
the
farther
side
and
wait
.
But
before
that
order
was
given
--
almost
as
*NL*
soon
in
fact
as
the
adjutant
had
left
Borodino
--
the
bridge
had
been
*NL*
retaken
by
the
Russians
and
burned
,
in
the
very
skirmish
at
which
Pierre
*NL*
had
been
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
adjutant
galloped
up
from
the
fleches
with
a
pale
and
frightened
face
*NL*
and
reported
to
Napoleon
that
their
attack
had
been
repulsed
,
Campan
*NL*
wounded
,
and
Davout
killed
;
yet
at
the
very
time
the
adjutant
had
been
*NL*
told
that
the
French
had
been
repulsed
,
the
fleches
had
in
fact
been
*NL*
recaptured
by
other
French
troops
,
and
Davout
was
alive
and
only
*NL*
slightly
bruised
.
On
the
basis
of
these
necessarily
untrustworthy
*NL*
reports
Napoleon
gave
his
orders
,
which
had
either
been
executed
before
*NL*
he
gave
them
or
could
not
be
and
were
not
executed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marshals
and
generals
,
who
were
nearer
to
the
field
of
battle
but
,
*NL*
like
Napoleon
,
did
not
take
part
in
the
actual
fighting
and
only
*NL*
occasionally
went
within
musket
range
,
made
their
own
arrangements
*NL*
without
asking
Napoleon
and
issued
orders
where
and
in
what
direction
to
*NL*
fire
and
where
cavalry
should
gallop
and
infantry
should
run
.
But
even
*NL*
their
orders
,
like
Napoleon
's
,
were
seldom
carried
out
,
and
then
but
*NL*
partially
.
For
the
most
part
things
happened
contrary
to
their
orders
.
*NL*
Soldiers
ordered
to
advance
ran
back
on
meeting
grapeshot
;
soldiers
*NL*
ordered
to
remain
where
they
were
,
suddenly
,
seeing
Russians
*NL*
unexpectedly
before
them
,
sometimes
rushed
back
and
sometimes
forward
,
*NL*
and
the
cavalry
dashed
without
orders
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
Russians
.
*NL*
In
this
way
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
Semenovsk
hollow
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
incline
turned
round
and
*NL*
galloped
full
speed
back
again
.
The
infantry
moved
in
the
same
way
,
*NL*
sometimes
running
to
quite
other
places
than
those
they
were
ordered
to
*NL*
go
to
.
All
orders
as
to
where
and
when
to
move
the
guns
,
when
to
send
*NL*
infantry
to
shoot
or
horsemen
to
ride
down
the
Russian
infantry
--
all
*NL*
such
orders
were
given
by
the
officers
on
the
spot
nearest
to
the
units
*NL*
concerned
,
without
asking
either
Ney
,
Davout
,
or
Murat
,
much
less
*NL*
Napoleon
.
They
did
not
fear
getting
into
trouble
for
not
fulfilling
*NL*
orders
or
for
acting
on
their
own
initiative
,
for
in
battle
what
is
at
*NL*
stake
is
what
is
dearest
to
man
--
his
own
life
--
and
it
sometimes
seems
*NL*
that
safety
lies
in
running
back
,
sometimes
in
running
forward
;
and
*NL*
these
men
who
were
right
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
acted
according
to
*NL*
the
mood
of
the
moment
.
In
reality
,
however
,
all
these
movements
forward
*NL*
and
backward
did
not
improve
or
alter
the
position
of
the
troops
.
All
*NL*
their
rushing
and
galloping
at
one
another
did
little
harm
,
the
harm
of
*NL*
disablement
and
death
was
caused
by
the
balls
and
bullets
that
flew
over
*NL*
the
fields
on
which
these
men
were
floundering
about
.
As
soon
as
they
*NL*
left
the
place
where
the
balls
and
bullets
were
flying
about
,
their
*NL*
superiors
,
located
in
the
background
,
re-formed
them
and
brought
them
*NL*
under
discipline
and
under
the
influence
of
that
discipline
led
them
*NL*
back
to
the
zone
of
fire
,
where
under
the
influence
of
fear
of
death
*NL*
they
lost
their
discipline
and
rushed
about
according
to
the
chance
*NL*
promptings
of
the
throng
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
's
generals
--
Davout
,
Ney
,
and
Murat
,
who
were
near
that
region
*NL*
of
fire
and
sometimes
even
entered
it
--
repeatedly
led
into
it
huge
*NL*
masses
of
well-ordered
troops
.
But
contrary
to
what
had
always
happened
*NL*
in
their
former
battles
,
instead
of
the
news
they
expected
of
the
*NL*
enemy
's
flight
,
these
orderly
masses
returned
thence
as
disorganized
and
*NL*
terrified
mobs
.
The
generals
re-formed
them
,
but
their
numbers
*NL*
constantly
decreased
.
In
the
middle
of
the
day
Murat
sent
his
adjutant
*NL*
to
Napoleon
to
demand
reinforcements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
knoll
,
drinking
punch
,
when
Murat
's
*NL*
adjutant
galloped
up
with
an
assurance
that
the
Russians
would
be
routed
*NL*
if
His
Majesty
would
let
him
have
another
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reinforcements
?
''
said
Napoleon
in
a
tone
of
stern
surprise
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
adjutant
--
a
handsome
lad
with
long
black
curls
arranged
like
Murat
's
*NL*
own
--
as
though
he
did
not
understand
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reinforcements
!
''
thought
Napoleon
to
himself
.
``
How
can
they
need
*NL*
reinforcements
when
they
already
have
half
the
army
directed
against
a
*NL*
weak
,
unentrenched
Russian
wing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
the
King
of
Naples
,
''
said
he
sternly
,
``
that
it
is
not
noon
yet
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
yet
see
my
chessboard
clearly
.
Go
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
boy
adjutant
with
the
long
hair
sighed
deeply
without
*NL*
removing
his
hand
from
his
hat
and
galloped
back
to
where
men
were
being
*NL*
slaughtered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
rose
and
having
summoned
Caulaincourt
and
Berthier
began
*NL*
talking
to
them
about
matters
unconnected
with
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
conversation
,
which
was
beginning
to
interest
*NL*
Napoleon
,
Berthier
's
eyes
turned
to
look
at
a
general
with
a
suite
,
who
*NL*
was
galloping
toward
the
knoll
on
a
lathering
horse
.
It
was
Belliard
.
*NL*
Having
dismounted
he
went
up
to
the
Emperor
with
rapid
strides
and
in
a
*NL*
loud
voice
began
boldly
demonstrating
the
necessity
of
sending
*NL*
reinforcements
.
He
swore
on
his
honor
that
the
Russians
were
lost
if
the
*NL*
Emperor
would
give
another
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
*NL*
without
replying
.
Belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
eagerly
to
the
*NL*
generals
of
the
suite
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
fiery
,
Belliard
,
''
said
Napoleon
,
when
he
again
came
up
to
*NL*
the
general
.
``
In
the
heat
of
a
battle
it
is
easy
to
make
a
mistake
.
Go
*NL*
and
have
another
look
and
then
come
back
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Belliard
was
out
of
sight
,
a
messenger
from
another
part
of
the
*NL*
battlefield
galloped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
what
do
you
want
?
''
asked
Napoleon
in
the
tone
of
a
man
*NL*
irritated
at
being
continually
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
the
prince
...
''
began
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asks
for
reinforcements
?
''
said
Napoleon
with
an
angry
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
bent
his
head
affirmatively
and
began
to
report
,
but
the
*NL*
Emperor
turned
from
him
,
took
a
couple
of
steps
,
stopped
,
came
back
,
and
*NL*
called
Berthier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
reserves
,
''
he
said
,
moving
his
arms
slightly
apart
.
``
Who
*NL*
do
you
think
should
be
sent
there
?
''
he
asked
of
Berthier
-LRB-
whom
he
*NL*
subsequently
termed
``
that
gosling
I
have
made
an
eagle
''
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
Claparede
's
division
,
sire
,
''
replied
Berthier
,
who
knew
all
the
*NL*
division
's
regiments
,
and
battalions
by
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
nodded
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
galloped
to
Claparede
's
division
and
a
few
minutes
later
*NL*
the
Young
Guards
stationed
behind
the
knoll
moved
forward
.
Napoleon
*NL*
gazed
silently
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
he
suddenly
said
to
Berthier
.
``
I
ca
n't
send
Claparede
.
Send
*NL*
Friant
's
division
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
was
no
advantage
in
sending
Friant
's
division
instead
of
*NL*
Claparede
's
,
and
even
an
obvious
inconvenience
and
delay
in
stopping
*NL*
Claparede
and
sending
Friant
now
,
the
order
was
carried
out
exactly
.
*NL*
Napoleon
did
not
notice
that
in
regard
to
his
army
he
was
playing
the
*NL*
part
of
a
doctor
who
hinders
by
his
medicines
--
a
role
he
so
justly
*NL*
understood
and
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friant
's
division
disappeared
as
the
others
had
done
into
the
smoke
of
*NL*
the
battlefield
.
From
all
sides
adjutants
continued
to
arrive
at
a
*NL*
gallop
and
as
if
by
agreement
all
said
the
same
thing
.
They
all
asked
*NL*
for
reinforcements
and
all
said
that
the
Russians
were
holding
their
*NL*
positions
and
maintaining
a
hellish
fire
under
which
the
French
army
was
*NL*
melting
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
sat
on
a
campstool
,
wrapped
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Beausset
,
the
man
so
fond
of
travel
,
having
fasted
since
morning
,
*NL*
came
up
to
the
Emperor
and
ventured
respectfully
to
suggest
lunch
to
His
*NL*
Majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
may
now
congratulate
Your
Majesty
on
a
victory
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
silently
shook
his
head
in
negation
.
Assuming
the
negation
to
*NL*
refer
only
to
the
victory
and
not
to
the
lunch
,
M.
de
Beausset
ventured
*NL*
with
respectful
jocularity
to
remark
that
there
is
no
reason
for
not
*NL*
having
lunch
when
one
can
get
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
...
''
exclaimed
Napoleon
suddenly
and
morosely
,
and
turned
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
beatific
smile
of
regret
,
repentance
,
and
ecstasy
beamed
on
M.
de
*NL*
Beausset
's
face
and
he
glided
away
to
the
other
generals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
was
experiencing
a
feeling
of
depression
like
that
of
an
ever
-
*NL*
lucky
gambler
who
,
after
recklessly
flinging
money
about
and
always
*NL*
winning
,
suddenly
just
when
he
has
calculated
all
the
chances
of
the
*NL*
game
,
finds
that
the
more
he
considers
his
play
the
more
surely
he
*NL*
loses
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
troops
were
the
same
,
his
generals
the
same
,
the
same
preparations
*NL*
had
been
made
,
the
same
dispositions
,
and
the
same
proclamation
courte
*NL*
et
energique
,
he
himself
was
still
the
same
:
he
knew
that
and
knew
that
*NL*
he
was
now
even
more
experienced
and
skillful
than
before
.
Even
the
*NL*
enemy
was
the
same
as
at
Austerlitz
and
Friedland
--
yet
the
terrible
*NL*
stroke
of
his
arm
had
supernaturally
become
impotent
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
old
methods
that
had
been
unfailingly
crowned
with
success
:
the
*NL*
concentration
of
batteries
on
one
point
,
an
attack
by
reserves
to
break
*NL*
the
enemy
's
line
,
and
a
cavalry
attack
by
``
the
men
of
iron
,
''
all
these
*NL*
methods
had
already
been
employed
,
yet
not
only
was
there
no
victory
,
*NL*
but
from
all
sides
came
the
same
news
of
generals
killed
and
wounded
,
of
*NL*
reinforcements
needed
,
of
the
impossibility
of
driving
back
the
*NL*
Russians
,
and
of
disorganization
among
his
own
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Formerly
,
after
he
had
given
two
or
three
orders
and
uttered
a
few
*NL*
phrases
,
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
up
with
*NL*
congratulations
and
happy
faces
,
announcing
the
trophies
taken
,
the
*NL*
corps
of
prisoners
,
bundles
of
enemy
eagles
and
standards
,
cannon
and
*NL*
stores
,
and
Murat
had
only
begged
leave
to
loose
the
cavalry
to
gather
*NL*
in
the
baggage
wagons
.
So
it
had
been
at
Lodi
,
Marengo
,
Arcola
,
Jena
,
*NL*
Austerlitz
,
Wagram
,
and
so
on
.
But
now
something
strange
was
happening
*NL*
to
his
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
news
of
the
capture
of
the
fleches
,
Napoleon
saw
that
this
was
*NL*
not
the
same
,
not
at
all
the
same
,
as
what
had
happened
in
his
former
*NL*
battles
.
He
saw
that
what
he
was
feeling
was
felt
by
all
the
men
about
*NL*
him
experienced
in
the
art
of
war
.
All
their
faces
looked
dejected
,
and
*NL*
they
all
shunned
one
another
's
eyes
--
only
a
de
Beausset
could
fail
to
*NL*
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
was
happening
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Napoleon
with
his
long
experience
of
war
well
knew
the
meaning
of
a
*NL*
battle
not
gained
by
the
attacking
side
in
eight
hours
,
after
all
*NL*
efforts
had
been
expended
.
He
knew
that
it
was
a
lost
battle
and
that
*NL*
the
least
accident
might
now
--
with
the
fight
balanced
on
such
a
strained
*NL*
center
--
destroy
him
and
his
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
ran
his
mind
over
the
whole
of
this
strange
Russian
campaign
in
*NL*
which
not
one
battle
had
been
won
,
and
in
which
not
a
flag
,
or
cannon
,
*NL*
or
army
corps
had
been
captured
in
two
months
,
when
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
concealed
depression
on
the
faces
around
him
and
heard
reports
of
the
*NL*
Russians
still
holding
their
ground
--
a
terrible
feeling
like
a
nightmare
*NL*
took
possession
of
him
,
and
all
the
unlucky
accidents
that
might
destroy
*NL*
him
occurred
to
his
mind
.
The
Russians
might
fall
on
his
left
wing
,
*NL*
might
break
through
his
center
,
he
himself
might
be
killed
by
a
stray
*NL*
cannon
ball
.
All
this
was
possible
.
In
former
battles
he
had
only
*NL*
considered
the
possibilities
of
success
,
but
now
innumerable
unlucky
*NL*
chances
presented
themselves
,
and
he
expected
them
all
.
Yes
,
it
was
like
*NL*
a
dream
in
which
a
man
fancies
that
a
ruffian
is
coming
to
attack
him
,
*NL*
and
raises
his
arm
to
strike
that
ruffian
a
terrible
blow
which
he
knows
*NL*
should
annihilate
him
,
but
then
feels
that
his
arm
drops
powerless
and
*NL*
limp
like
a
rag
,
and
the
horror
of
unavoidable
destruction
seizes
him
in
*NL*
his
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
that
the
Russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
of
the
French
*NL*
army
aroused
that
horror
in
Napoleon
.
He
sat
silently
on
a
campstool
*NL*
below
the
knoll
,
with
head
bowed
and
elbows
on
his
knees
.
Berthier
*NL*
approached
and
suggested
that
they
should
ride
along
the
line
to
*NL*
ascertain
the
position
of
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
do
you
say
?
''
asked
Napoleon
.
``
Yes
,
tell
them
to
bring
me
my
*NL*
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
and
rode
toward
Semenovsk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
powder
smoke
,
slowly
dispersing
over
the
whole
space
through
*NL*
which
Napoleon
rode
,
horses
and
men
were
lying
in
pools
of
blood
,
singly
*NL*
or
in
heaps
.
Neither
Napoleon
nor
any
of
his
generals
had
ever
before
*NL*
seen
such
horrors
or
so
many
slain
in
such
a
small
area
.
The
roar
of
*NL*
guns
,
that
had
not
ceased
for
ten
hours
,
wearied
the
ear
and
gave
a
*NL*
peculiar
significance
to
the
spectacle
,
as
music
does
to
tableaux
*NL*
vivants
.
Napoleon
rode
up
the
high
ground
at
Semenovsk
,
and
through
the
*NL*
smoke
saw
ranks
of
men
in
uniforms
of
a
color
unfamiliar
to
him
.
They
*NL*
were
Russians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
stood
in
serried
ranks
behind
Semenovsk
village
and
its
*NL*
knoll
,
and
their
guns
boomed
incessantly
along
their
line
and
sent
forth
*NL*
clouds
of
smoke
.
It
was
no
longer
a
battle
:
it
was
a
continuous
*NL*
slaughter
which
could
be
of
no
avail
either
to
the
French
or
the
*NL*
Russians
.
Napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
the
reverie
*NL*
from
which
Berthier
had
aroused
him
.
He
could
not
stop
what
was
going
on
*NL*
before
him
and
around
him
and
was
supposed
to
be
directed
by
him
and
to
*NL*
depend
on
him
,
and
from
its
lack
of
success
this
affair
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
and
horrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
generals
rode
up
to
Napoleon
and
ventured
to
offer
to
lead
*NL*
the
Old
Guard
into
action
.
Ney
and
Berthier
,
standing
near
Napoleon
,
*NL*
exchanged
looks
and
smiled
contemptuously
at
this
general
's
senseless
*NL*
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
bowed
his
head
and
remained
silent
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
eight
hundred
leagues
from
France
,
I
will
not
have
my
Guard
*NL*
destroyed
!
''
he
said
,
and
turning
his
horse
rode
back
to
Shevardino
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
rug-covered
bench
where
Pierre
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sat
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
his
gray
head
hanging
,
his
heavy
body
relaxed
.
He
gave
no
*NL*
orders
,
but
only
assented
to
or
dissented
from
what
others
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
do
that
,
''
he
replied
to
various
proposals
.
``
Yes
,
yes
:
go
,
*NL*
dear
boy
,
and
have
a
look
,
''
he
would
say
to
one
or
another
of
those
*NL*
about
him
;
or
,
``
No
,
do
n't
,
we
'd
better
wait
!
''
He
listened
to
the
reports
*NL*
that
were
brought
him
and
gave
directions
when
his
subordinates
demanded
*NL*
that
of
him
;
but
when
listening
to
the
reports
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
*NL*
not
interested
in
the
import
of
the
words
spoken
,
but
rather
in
*NL*
something
else
--
in
the
expression
of
face
and
tone
of
voice
of
those
who
*NL*
were
reporting
.
By
long
years
of
military
experience
he
knew
,
and
with
*NL*
the
wisdom
of
age
understood
,
that
it
is
impossible
for
one
man
to
*NL*
direct
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
struggling
with
death
,
and
he
*NL*
knew
that
the
result
of
a
battle
is
decided
not
by
the
orders
of
a
*NL*
commander-in-chief
,
nor
the
place
where
the
troops
are
stationed
,
nor
by
*NL*
the
number
of
cannon
or
of
slaughtered
men
,
but
by
that
intangible
force
*NL*
called
the
spirit
of
the
army
,
and
he
watched
this
force
and
guided
it
*NL*
in
as
far
as
that
was
in
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
general
expression
was
one
of
concentrated
quiet
attention
,
*NL*
and
his
face
wore
a
strained
look
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
master
*NL*
the
fatigue
of
his
old
and
feeble
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
they
brought
him
news
that
the
fleches
captured
by
the
*NL*
French
had
been
retaken
,
but
that
Prince
Bagration
was
wounded
.
Kutuzov
*NL*
groaned
and
swayed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ride
over
to
Prince
Peter
Ivanovich
and
find
out
about
it
exactly
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
one
of
his
adjutants
,
and
then
turned
to
the
Duke
of
Wurttemberg
*NL*
who
was
standing
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Your
Highness
please
take
command
of
the
first
army
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
duke
's
departure
--
before
he
could
possibly
have
reached
*NL*
Semenovsk
--
his
adjutant
came
back
from
him
and
told
Kutuzov
that
the
*NL*
duke
asked
for
more
troops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
made
a
grimace
and
sent
an
order
to
Dokhturov
to
take
over
the
*NL*
command
of
the
first
army
,
and
a
request
to
the
duke
--
whom
he
said
he
*NL*
could
not
spare
at
such
an
important
moment
--
to
return
to
him
.
When
they
*NL*
brought
him
news
that
Murat
had
been
taken
prisoner
,
and
the
staff
*NL*
officers
congratulated
him
,
Kutuzov
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
little
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
battle
is
won
,
and
there
is
*NL*
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
capture
of
Murat
.
Still
,
it
is
better
to
*NL*
wait
before
we
rejoice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
sent
an
adjutant
to
take
the
news
round
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Scherbinin
came
galloping
from
the
left
flank
with
news
that
the
*NL*
French
had
captured
the
fleches
and
the
village
of
Semenovsk
,
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
guessing
by
the
sounds
of
the
battle
and
by
Scherbinin
's
looks
that
the
*NL*
news
was
bad
,
rose
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
and
,
taking
Scherbinin
's
*NL*
arm
,
led
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
he
said
to
Ermolov
,
``
and
see
whether
something
*NL*
ca
n't
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
in
Gorki
,
near
the
center
of
the
Russian
position
.
The
*NL*
attack
directed
by
Napoleon
against
our
left
flank
had
been
several
*NL*
times
repulsed
.
In
the
center
the
French
had
not
got
beyond
Borodino
,
*NL*
and
on
their
left
flank
Uvarov
's
cavalry
had
put
the
French
to
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
three
o'clock
the
French
attacks
ceased
.
On
the
faces
of
all
who
*NL*
came
from
the
field
of
battle
,
and
of
those
who
stood
around
him
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
noticed
an
expression
of
extreme
tension
.
He
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
the
day
's
success
--
a
success
exceeding
his
expectations
,
but
the
old
*NL*
man
's
strength
was
failing
him
.
Several
times
his
head
dropped
low
as
if
*NL*
it
were
falling
and
he
dozed
off
.
Dinner
was
brought
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adjutant
General
Wolzogen
,
the
man
who
when
riding
past
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
had
said
,
``
the
war
should
be
extended
widely
,
''
and
whom
Bagration
so
*NL*
detested
,
rode
up
while
Kutuzov
was
at
dinner
.
Wolzogen
had
come
from
*NL*
Barclay
de
Tolly
to
report
on
the
progress
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
.
*NL*
The
sagacious
Barclay
de
Tolly
,
seeing
crowds
of
wounded
men
running
*NL*
back
and
the
disordered
rear
of
the
army
,
weighed
all
the
circumstances
,
*NL*
concluded
that
the
battle
was
lost
,
and
sent
his
favorite
officer
to
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
with
that
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
chewing
a
piece
of
roast
chicken
with
difficulty
and
glanced
*NL*
at
Wolzogen
with
eyes
that
brightened
under
their
puckering
lids
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wolzogen
,
nonchalantly
stretching
his
legs
,
approached
Kutuzov
with
a
*NL*
half-contemptuous
smile
on
his
lips
,
scarcely
touching
the
peak
of
his
*NL*
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
treated
his
Serene
Highness
with
a
somewhat
affected
nonchalance
*NL*
intended
to
show
that
,
as
a
highly
trained
military
man
,
he
left
it
to
*NL*
Russians
to
make
an
idol
of
this
useless
old
man
,
but
that
he
knew
whom
*NL*
he
was
dealing
with
.
``
Der
alte
Herr
''
-LRB-
as
in
their
own
set
the
Germans
*NL*
called
Kutuzov
-RRB-
``
is
making
himself
very
comfortable
,
''
thought
Wolzogen
,
*NL*
and
looking
severely
at
the
dishes
in
front
of
Kutuzov
he
began
to
*NL*
report
to
``
the
old
gentleman
''
the
position
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
*NL*
as
Barclay
had
ordered
him
to
and
as
he
himself
had
seen
and
understood
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
points
of
our
position
are
in
the
enemy
's
hands
and
we
can
not
*NL*
dislodge
them
for
lack
of
troops
,
the
men
are
running
away
and
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
stop
them
,
''
he
reported
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
ceased
chewing
and
fixed
an
astonished
gaze
on
Wolzogen
,
as
if
*NL*
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
him
.
Wolzogen
,
noticing
``
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
's
''
agitation
,
said
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
considered
it
right
to
conceal
from
your
Serene
Highness
*NL*
what
I
have
seen
.
The
troops
are
in
complete
disorder
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
seen
?
You
have
seen
?
...
''
Kutuzov
shouted
.
Frowning
and
rising
*NL*
quickly
,
he
went
up
to
Wolzogen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
...
how
dare
you
!
...
''
he
shouted
,
choking
and
making
a
threatening
*NL*
gesture
with
his
trembling
arms
:
``
How
dare
you
,
sir
,
say
that
to
me
?
You
*NL*
know
nothing
about
it
.
Tell
General
Barclay
from
me
that
his
information
*NL*
is
incorrect
and
that
the
real
course
of
the
battle
is
better
known
to
*NL*
me
,
the
commander-in-chief
,
than
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wolzogen
was
about
to
make
a
rejoinder
,
but
Kutuzov
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
enemy
has
been
repulsed
on
the
left
and
defeated
on
the
right
*NL*
flank
.
If
you
have
seen
amiss
,
sir
,
do
not
allow
yourself
to
say
what
*NL*
you
do
n't
know
!
Be
so
good
as
to
ride
to
General
Barclay
and
inform
him
*NL*
of
my
firm
intention
to
attack
the
enemy
tomorrow
,
''
said
Kutuzov
*NL*
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
,
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
heavy
breathing
of
*NL*
the
panting
old
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
repulsed
everywhere
,
for
which
I
thank
God
and
our
brave
army
!
*NL*
The
enemy
is
beaten
,
and
tomorrow
we
shall
drive
him
from
the
sacred
*NL*
soil
of
Russia
,
''
said
Kutuzov
crossing
himself
,
and
he
suddenly
sobbed
*NL*
as
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wolzogen
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
curling
his
lips
,
stepped
silently
*NL*
aside
,
marveling
at
``
the
old
gentleman
's
''
conceited
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
he
is
,
my
hero
!
''
said
Kutuzov
to
a
portly
,
handsome
,
dark
-
*NL*
haired
general
who
was
just
ascending
the
knoll
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Raevski
,
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
most
important
part
*NL*
of
the
field
of
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raevski
reported
that
the
troops
were
firmly
holding
their
ground
and
*NL*
that
the
French
no
longer
ventured
to
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
hearing
him
,
Kutuzov
said
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
not
think
,
like
some
others
,
that
we
must
retreat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
your
Highness
,
in
indecisive
actions
it
is
always
the
*NL*
most
stubborn
who
remain
victors
,
''
replied
Raevski
,
``
and
in
my
*NL*
opinion
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kaysarov
!
''
Kutuzov
called
to
his
adjutant
.
``
Sit
down
and
write
out
the
*NL*
order
of
the
day
for
tomorrow
.
And
you
,
''
he
continued
,
addressing
*NL*
another
,
``
ride
along
the
line
and
announce
that
tomorrow
we
attack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Kutuzov
was
talking
to
Raevski
and
dictating
the
order
of
the
day
,
*NL*
Wolzogen
returned
from
Barclay
and
said
that
General
Barclay
wished
to
*NL*
have
written
confirmation
of
the
order
the
field
marshal
had
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
without
looking
at
Wolzogen
,
gave
directions
for
the
order
to
*NL*
be
written
out
which
the
former
commander-in-chief
,
to
avoid
personal
*NL*
responsibility
,
very
judiciously
wished
to
receive
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
means
of
that
mysterious
indefinable
bond
which
maintains
*NL*
throughout
an
army
one
and
the
same
temper
,
known
as
``
the
spirit
of
the
*NL*
army
,
''
and
which
constitutes
the
sinew
of
war
,
Kutuzov
's
words
,
his
*NL*
order
for
a
battle
next
day
,
immediately
became
known
from
one
end
of
*NL*
the
army
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
far
from
being
the
same
words
or
the
same
order
that
reached
the
*NL*
farthest
links
of
that
chain
.
The
tales
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
*NL*
different
ends
of
the
army
did
not
even
resemble
what
Kutuzov
had
said
,
*NL*
but
the
sense
of
his
words
spread
everywhere
because
what
he
said
was
*NL*
not
the
outcome
of
cunning
calculations
,
but
of
a
feeling
that
lay
in
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
's
soul
as
in
that
of
every
Russian
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
learning
that
tomorrow
they
were
to
attack
the
enemy
,
and
hearing
*NL*
from
the
highest
quarters
a
confirmation
of
what
they
wanted
to
believe
,
*NL*
the
exhausted
,
wavering
men
felt
comforted
and
inspirited
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
regiment
was
among
the
reserves
which
till
after
one
*NL*
o'clock
were
stationed
inactive
behind
Semenovsk
,
under
heavy
artillery
*NL*
fire
.
Toward
two
o'clock
the
regiment
,
having
already
lost
more
than
two
*NL*
hundred
men
,
was
moved
forward
into
a
trampled
oatfield
in
the
gap
*NL*
between
Semenovsk
and
the
Knoll
Battery
,
where
thousands
of
men
perished
*NL*
that
day
and
on
which
an
intense
,
concentrated
fire
from
several
hundred
*NL*
enemy
guns
was
directed
between
one
and
two
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
moving
from
that
spot
or
firing
a
single
shot
the
regiment
here
*NL*
lost
another
third
of
its
men
.
From
in
front
and
especially
from
the
*NL*
right
,
in
the
unlifting
smoke
the
guns
boomed
,
and
out
of
the
mysterious
*NL*
domain
of
smoke
that
overlay
the
whole
space
in
front
,
quick
hissing
*NL*
cannon
balls
and
slow
whistling
shells
flew
unceasingly
.
At
times
,
as
if
*NL*
to
allow
them
a
respite
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
during
which
the
*NL*
cannon
balls
and
shells
all
flew
overhead
,
but
sometimes
several
men
*NL*
were
torn
from
the
regiment
in
a
minute
and
the
slain
were
continually
*NL*
being
dragged
away
and
the
wounded
carried
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
each
fresh
blow
less
and
less
chance
of
life
remained
for
those
not
*NL*
yet
killed
.
The
regiment
stood
in
columns
of
battalion
,
three
hundred
*NL*
paces
apart
,
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
always
in
one
and
the
same
*NL*
mood
.
All
alike
were
taciturn
and
morose
.
Talk
was
rarely
heard
in
the
*NL*
ranks
,
and
it
ceased
altogether
every
time
the
thud
of
a
successful
shot
*NL*
and
the
cry
of
``
stretchers
!
''
was
heard
.
Most
of
the
time
,
by
their
*NL*
officers
'
order
,
the
men
sat
on
the
ground
.
One
,
having
taken
off
his
*NL*
shako
,
carefully
loosened
the
gathers
of
its
lining
and
drew
them
tight
*NL*
again
;
another
,
rubbing
some
dry
clay
between
his
palms
,
polished
his
*NL*
bayonet
;
another
fingered
the
strap
and
pulled
the
buckle
of
his
*NL*
bandolier
,
while
another
smoothed
and
refolded
his
leg
bands
and
put
his
*NL*
boots
on
again
.
Some
built
little
houses
of
the
tufts
in
the
plowed
*NL*
ground
,
or
plaited
baskets
from
the
straw
in
the
cornfield
.
All
seemed
*NL*
fully
absorbed
in
these
pursuits
.
When
men
were
killed
or
wounded
,
when
*NL*
rows
of
stretchers
went
past
,
when
some
troops
retreated
,
and
when
great
*NL*
masses
of
the
enemy
came
into
view
through
the
smoke
,
no
one
paid
any
*NL*
attention
to
these
things
.
But
when
our
artillery
or
cavalry
advanced
or
*NL*
some
of
our
infantry
were
seen
to
move
forward
,
words
of
approval
were
*NL*
heard
on
all
sides
.
But
the
liveliest
attention
was
attracted
by
*NL*
occurrences
quite
apart
from
,
and
unconnected
with
,
the
battle
.
It
was
*NL*
as
if
the
minds
of
these
morally
exhausted
men
found
relief
in
everyday
,
*NL*
commonplace
occurrences
.
A
battery
of
artillery
was
passing
in
front
of
*NL*
the
regiment
.
The
horse
of
an
ammunition
cart
put
its
leg
over
a
trace
.
*NL*
``
Hey
,
look
at
the
trace
horse
!
...
Get
her
leg
out
!
She
'll
fall
...
Ah
,
*NL*
they
do
n't
see
it
!
''
came
identical
shouts
from
the
ranks
all
along
the
*NL*
regiment
.
Another
time
,
general
attention
was
attracted
by
a
small
brown
*NL*
dog
,
coming
heaven
knows
whence
,
which
trotted
in
a
preoccupied
manner
*NL*
in
front
of
the
ranks
with
tail
stiffly
erect
till
suddenly
a
shell
fell
*NL*
close
by
,
when
it
yelped
,
tucked
its
tail
between
its
legs
,
and
darted
*NL*
aside
.
Yells
and
shrieks
of
laughter
rose
from
the
whole
regiment
.
But
*NL*
such
distractions
lasted
only
a
moment
,
and
for
eight
hours
the
men
had
*NL*
been
inactive
,
without
food
,
in
constant
fear
of
death
,
and
their
pale
*NL*
and
gloomy
faces
grew
ever
paler
and
gloomier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
,
pale
and
gloomy
like
everyone
in
the
regiment
,
paced
up
*NL*
and
down
from
the
border
of
one
patch
to
another
,
at
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
meadow
beside
an
oatfield
,
with
head
bowed
and
arms
behind
his
back
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
and
no
orders
to
be
given
.
Everything
*NL*
went
on
of
itself
.
The
killed
were
dragged
from
the
front
,
the
wounded
*NL*
carried
away
,
and
the
ranks
closed
up
.
If
any
soldiers
ran
to
the
rear
*NL*
they
returned
immediately
and
hastily
.
At
first
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
considering
it
his
duty
to
rouse
the
courage
of
the
men
and
to
set
them
*NL*
an
example
,
walked
about
among
the
ranks
,
but
he
soon
became
convinced
*NL*
that
this
was
unnecessary
and
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
teach
*NL*
them
.
All
the
powers
of
his
soul
,
as
of
every
soldier
there
,
were
*NL*
unconsciously
bent
on
avoiding
the
contemplation
of
the
horrors
of
their
*NL*
situation
.
He
walked
along
the
meadow
,
dragging
his
feet
,
rustling
the
*NL*
grass
,
and
gazing
at
the
dust
that
covered
his
boots
;
now
he
took
big
*NL*
strides
trying
to
keep
to
the
footprints
left
on
the
meadow
by
the
*NL*
mowers
,
then
he
counted
his
steps
,
calculating
how
often
he
must
walk
*NL*
from
one
strip
to
another
to
walk
a
mile
,
then
he
stripped
the
flowers
*NL*
from
the
wormwood
that
grew
along
a
boundary
rut
,
rubbed
them
in
his
*NL*
palms
,
and
smelled
their
pungent
,
sweetly
bitter
scent
.
Nothing
remained
*NL*
of
the
previous
day
's
thoughts
.
He
thought
of
nothing
.
He
listened
with
*NL*
weary
ears
to
the
ever-recurring
sounds
,
distinguishing
the
whistle
of
*NL*
flying
projectiles
from
the
booming
of
the
reports
,
glanced
at
the
*NL*
tiresomely
familiar
faces
of
the
men
of
the
first
battalion
,
and
waited
.
*NL*
``
Here
it
comes
...
this
one
is
coming
our
way
again
!
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
listening
to
an
approaching
whistle
in
the
hidden
region
of
smoke
.
``
One
,
*NL*
another
!
Again
!
It
has
hit
...
''
He
stopped
and
looked
at
the
ranks
.
``
No
,
*NL*
it
has
gone
over
.
But
this
one
has
hit
!
''
And
again
he
started
trying
to
*NL*
reach
the
boundary
strip
in
sixteen
paces
.
A
whizz
and
a
thud
!
Five
*NL*
paces
from
him
,
a
cannon
ball
tore
up
the
dry
earth
and
disappeared
.
A
*NL*
chill
ran
down
his
back
.
Again
he
glanced
at
the
ranks
.
Probably
many
*NL*
had
been
hit
--
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
near
the
second
battalion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adjutant
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Order
them
not
to
crowd
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjutant
,
having
obeyed
this
instruction
,
approached
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
From
the
other
side
a
battalion
commander
rode
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
''
came
a
frightened
cry
from
a
soldier
and
,
like
a
bird
*NL*
whirring
in
rapid
flight
and
alighting
on
the
ground
,
a
shell
dropped
*NL*
with
little
noise
within
two
steps
of
Prince
Andrew
and
close
to
the
*NL*
battalion
commander
's
horse
.
The
horse
first
,
regardless
of
whether
it
*NL*
was
right
or
wrong
to
show
fear
,
snorted
,
reared
almost
throwing
the
*NL*
major
,
and
galloped
aside
.
The
horse
's
terror
infected
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
down
!
''
cried
the
adjutant
,
throwing
himself
flat
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
hesitated
.
The
smoking
shell
spun
like
a
top
between
him
*NL*
and
the
prostrate
adjutant
,
near
a
wormwood
plant
between
the
field
and
*NL*
the
meadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
this
be
death
?
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
looking
with
a
quite
new
,
*NL*
envious
glance
at
the
grass
,
the
wormwood
,
and
the
streamlet
of
smoke
*NL*
that
curled
up
from
the
rotating
black
ball
.
``
I
can
not
,
I
do
not
wish
to
*NL*
die
.
I
love
life
--
I
love
this
grass
,
this
earth
,
this
air
...
''
He
*NL*
thought
this
,
and
at
the
same
time
remembered
that
people
were
looking
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
shameful
,
sir
!
''
he
said
to
the
adjutant
.
``
What
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
speaking
.
At
one
and
the
same
moment
came
the
sound
of
*NL*
an
explosion
,
a
whistle
of
splinters
as
from
a
breaking
window
frame
,
a
*NL*
suffocating
smell
of
powder
,
and
Prince
Andrew
started
to
one
side
,
*NL*
raising
his
arm
,
and
fell
on
his
chest
.
Several
officers
ran
up
to
him
.
*NL*
From
the
right
side
of
his
abdomen
,
blood
was
welling
out
making
a
large
*NL*
stain
on
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
militiamen
with
stretchers
who
were
called
up
stood
behind
the
*NL*
officers
.
Prince
Andrew
lay
on
his
chest
with
his
face
in
the
grass
,
*NL*
breathing
heavily
and
noisily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasants
went
up
and
took
him
by
his
shoulders
and
legs
,
but
he
*NL*
moaned
piteously
and
,
exchanging
looks
,
they
set
him
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pick
him
up
,
lift
him
,
it
's
all
the
same
!
''
cried
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
again
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
laid
him
on
the
stretcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
God
!
My
God
!
What
is
it
?
The
stomach
?
That
means
death
!
My
God
!
''
--
*NL*
voices
among
the
officers
were
heard
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
flew
a
hair
's
breadth
past
my
ear
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasants
,
adjusting
the
stretcher
to
their
shoulders
,
started
*NL*
hurriedly
along
the
path
they
had
trodden
down
,
to
the
dressing
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
in
step
!
Ah
...
those
peasants
!
''
shouted
an
officer
,
seizing
by
*NL*
their
shoulders
and
checking
the
peasants
,
who
were
walking
unevenly
and
*NL*
jolting
the
stretcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
into
step
,
Fedor
...
I
say
,
Fedor
!
''
said
the
foremost
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
's
right
!
''
said
the
one
behind
joyfully
,
when
he
had
got
into
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
!
Eh
,
Prince
!
''
said
the
trembling
voice
of
Timokhin
,
who
*NL*
had
run
up
and
was
looking
down
on
the
stretcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
at
the
speaker
from
the
*NL*
stretcher
into
which
his
head
had
sunk
deep
and
again
his
eyelids
*NL*
drooped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
militiamen
carried
Prince
Andrew
to
the
dressing
station
by
the
*NL*
wood
,
where
wagons
were
stationed
.
The
dressing
station
consisted
of
*NL*
three
tents
with
flaps
turned
back
,
pitched
at
the
edge
of
a
birch
wood
.
*NL*
In
the
wood
,
wagons
and
horses
were
standing
.
The
horses
were
eating
*NL*
oats
from
their
movable
troughs
and
sparrows
flew
down
and
pecked
the
*NL*
grains
that
fell
.
Some
crows
,
scenting
blood
,
flew
among
the
birch
trees
*NL*
cawing
impatiently
.
Around
the
tents
,
over
more
than
five
acres
,
*NL*
bloodstained
men
in
various
garbs
stood
,
sat
,
or
lay
.
Around
the
wounded
*NL*
stood
crowds
of
soldier
stretcher-bearers
with
dismal
and
attentive
*NL*
faces
,
whom
the
officers
keeping
order
tried
in
vain
to
drive
from
the
*NL*
spot
.
Disregarding
the
officers
'
orders
,
the
soldiers
stood
leaning
*NL*
against
their
stretchers
and
gazing
intently
,
as
if
trying
to
comprehend
*NL*
the
difficult
problem
of
what
was
taking
place
before
them
.
From
the
*NL*
tents
came
now
loud
angry
cries
and
now
plaintive
groans
.
Occasionally
*NL*
dressers
ran
out
to
fetch
water
,
or
to
point
out
those
who
were
to
be
*NL*
brought
in
next
.
The
wounded
men
awaiting
their
turn
outside
the
tents
*NL*
groaned
,
sighed
,
wept
,
screamed
,
swore
,
or
asked
for
vodka
.
Some
were
*NL*
delirious
.
Prince
Andrew
's
bearers
,
stepping
over
the
wounded
who
had
*NL*
not
yet
been
bandaged
,
took
him
,
as
a
regimental
commander
,
close
up
to
*NL*
one
of
the
tents
and
there
stopped
,
awaiting
instructions
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
opened
his
eyes
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
on
*NL*
around
him
.
He
remembered
the
meadow
,
the
wormwood
,
the
field
,
the
*NL*
whirling
black
ball
,
and
his
sudden
rush
of
passionate
love
of
life
.
Two
*NL*
steps
from
him
,
leaning
against
a
branch
and
talking
loudly
and
*NL*
attracting
general
attention
,
stood
a
tall
,
handsome
,
black-haired
*NL*
noncommissioned
officer
with
a
bandaged
head
.
He
had
been
wounded
in
the
*NL*
head
and
leg
by
bullets
.
Around
him
,
eagerly
listening
to
his
talk
,
a
*NL*
crowd
of
wounded
and
stretcher-bearers
was
gathered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
kicked
him
out
from
there
so
that
he
chucked
everything
,
we
grabbed
*NL*
the
King
himself
!
''
cried
he
,
looking
around
him
with
eyes
that
glittered
*NL*
with
fever
.
``
If
only
reserves
had
come
up
just
then
,
lads
,
there
*NL*
would
n't
have
been
nothing
left
of
him
!
I
tell
you
surely
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
the
others
near
the
speaker
,
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
shining
eyes
and
experienced
a
sense
of
comfort
.
``
But
is
n't
it
all
the
*NL*
same
now
?
''
thought
he
.
``
And
what
will
be
there
,
and
what
has
there
been
*NL*
here
?
Why
was
I
so
reluctant
to
part
with
life
?
There
was
something
in
*NL*
this
life
I
did
not
and
do
not
understand
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
doctors
came
out
of
the
tent
in
a
bloodstained
apron
,
holding
*NL*
a
cigar
between
the
thumb
and
little
finger
of
one
of
his
small
*NL*
bloodstained
hands
,
so
as
not
to
smear
it
.
He
raised
his
head
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
,
but
above
the
level
of
the
wounded
men
.
He
evidently
wanted
a
*NL*
little
respite
.
After
turning
his
head
from
right
to
left
for
some
time
,
*NL*
he
sighed
and
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
immediately
,
''
he
replied
to
a
dresser
who
pointed
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
out
to
him
,
and
he
told
them
to
carry
him
into
the
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murmurs
arose
among
the
wounded
who
were
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
that
even
in
the
next
world
only
the
gentry
are
to
have
a
*NL*
chance
!
''
remarked
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
carried
in
and
laid
on
a
table
that
had
only
just
been
*NL*
cleared
and
which
a
dresser
was
washing
down
.
Prince
Andrew
could
not
*NL*
make
out
distinctly
what
was
in
that
tent
.
The
pitiful
groans
from
all
*NL*
sides
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
thigh
,
stomach
,
and
back
distracted
*NL*
him
.
All
he
saw
about
him
merged
into
a
general
impression
of
naked
,
*NL*
bleeding
human
bodies
that
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
of
the
low
tent
,
as
*NL*
a
few
weeks
previously
,
on
that
hot
August
day
,
such
bodies
had
filled
*NL*
the
dirty
pond
beside
the
Smolensk
road
.
Yes
,
it
was
the
same
flesh
,
the
*NL*
same
chair
a
canon
,
the
sight
of
which
had
even
then
filled
him
with
*NL*
horror
,
as
by
a
presentiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
operating
tables
in
the
tent
.
Two
were
occupied
,
and
on
*NL*
the
third
they
placed
Prince
Andrew
.
For
a
little
while
he
was
left
*NL*
alone
and
involuntarily
witnessed
what
was
taking
place
on
the
other
two
*NL*
tables
.
On
the
nearest
one
sat
a
Tartar
,
probably
a
Cossack
,
judging
by
*NL*
the
uniform
thrown
down
beside
him
.
Four
soldiers
were
holding
him
,
and
*NL*
a
spectacled
doctor
was
cutting
into
his
muscular
brown
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ooh
,
ooh
,
ooh
!
''
grunted
the
Tartar
,
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
swarthy
*NL*
snub-nosed
face
with
its
high
cheekbones
,
and
baring
his
white
teeth
,
he
*NL*
began
to
wriggle
and
twitch
his
body
and
utter
piercing
,
ringing
,
and
*NL*
prolonged
yells
.
On
the
other
table
,
round
which
many
people
were
*NL*
crowding
,
a
tall
well-fed
man
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
back
.
*NL*
His
curly
hair
,
its
color
,
and
the
shape
of
his
head
seemed
strangely
*NL*
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew
.
Several
dressers
were
pressing
on
his
chest
*NL*
to
hold
him
down
.
One
large
,
white
,
plump
leg
twitched
rapidly
all
the
*NL*
time
with
a
feverish
tremor
.
The
man
was
sobbing
and
choking
*NL*
convulsively
.
Two
doctors
--
one
of
whom
was
pale
and
trembling
--
were
*NL*
silently
doing
something
to
this
man
's
other
,
gory
leg
.
When
he
had
*NL*
finished
with
the
Tartar
,
whom
they
covered
with
an
overcoat
,
the
*NL*
spectacled
doctor
came
up
to
Prince
Andrew
,
wiping
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew
's
face
and
quickly
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undress
him
!
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
''
he
cried
angrily
to
the
*NL*
dressers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
very
first
,
remotest
recollections
of
childhood
came
back
to
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
mind
when
the
dresser
with
sleeves
rolled
up
began
hastily
to
*NL*
undo
the
buttons
of
his
clothes
and
undressed
him
.
The
doctor
bent
down
*NL*
over
the
wound
,
felt
it
,
and
sighed
deeply
.
Then
he
made
a
sign
to
*NL*
someone
,
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
abdomen
caused
Prince
Andrew
to
*NL*
lose
consciousness
.
When
he
came
to
himself
the
splintered
portions
of
*NL*
his
thighbone
had
been
extracted
,
the
torn
flesh
cut
away
,
and
the
wound
*NL*
bandaged
.
Water
was
being
sprinkled
on
his
face
.
As
soon
as
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
opened
his
eyes
,
the
doctor
bent
over
,
kissed
him
silently
on
the
*NL*
lips
,
and
hurried
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
sufferings
he
had
been
enduring
,
Prince
Andrew
enjoyed
a
*NL*
blissful
feeling
such
as
he
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time
.
All
the
*NL*
best
and
happiest
moments
of
his
life
--
especially
his
earliest
*NL*
childhood
,
when
he
used
to
be
undressed
and
put
to
bed
,
and
when
leaning
*NL*
over
him
his
nurse
sang
him
to
sleep
and
he
,
burying
his
head
in
the
*NL*
pillow
,
felt
happy
in
the
mere
consciousness
of
life
--
returned
to
his
*NL*
memory
,
not
merely
as
something
past
but
as
something
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctors
were
busily
engaged
with
the
wounded
man
the
shape
of
whose
*NL*
head
seemed
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew
:
they
were
lifting
him
up
and
*NL*
trying
to
quiet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
it
to
me
...
Oh
,
ooh
...
Oh
!
Oh
,
ooh
!
''
his
frightened
moans
could
*NL*
be
heard
,
subdued
by
suffering
and
broken
by
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
those
moans
Prince
Andrew
wanted
to
weep
.
Whether
because
he
was
*NL*
dying
without
glory
,
or
because
he
was
sorry
to
part
with
life
,
or
*NL*
because
of
those
memories
of
a
childhood
that
could
not
return
,
or
*NL*
because
he
was
suffering
and
others
were
suffering
and
that
man
near
him
*NL*
was
groaning
so
piteously
--
he
felt
like
weeping
childlike
,
kindly
,
and
*NL*
almost
happy
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wounded
man
was
shown
his
amputated
leg
stained
with
clotted
blood
*NL*
and
with
the
boot
still
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Oh
,
ooh
!
''
he
sobbed
,
like
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
who
had
been
standing
beside
him
,
preventing
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
from
seeing
his
face
,
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
What
is
this
?
Why
is
he
here
?
''
said
Prince
Andrew
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
miserable
,
sobbing
,
enfeebled
man
whose
leg
had
just
been
*NL*
amputated
,
he
recognized
Anatole
Kuragin
.
Men
were
supporting
him
in
*NL*
their
arms
and
offering
him
a
glass
of
water
,
but
his
trembling
,
swollen
*NL*
lips
could
not
grasp
its
rim
.
Anatole
was
sobbing
painfully
.
``
Yes
,
it
is
*NL*
he
!
Yes
,
that
man
is
somehow
closely
and
painfully
connected
with
me
,
''
*NL*
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
not
yet
clearly
grasping
what
he
saw
before
him
.
*NL*
``
What
is
the
connection
of
that
man
with
my
childhood
and
life
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
himself
without
finding
an
answer
.
And
suddenly
a
new
unexpected
*NL*
memory
from
that
realm
of
pure
and
loving
childhood
presented
itself
to
*NL*
him
.
He
remembered
Natasha
as
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
at
the
*NL*
ball
in
1810
,
with
her
slender
neck
and
arms
and
with
a
frightened
happy
*NL*
face
ready
for
rapture
,
and
love
and
tenderness
for
her
,
stronger
and
*NL*
more
vivid
than
ever
,
awoke
in
his
soul
.
He
now
remembered
the
*NL*
connection
that
existed
between
himself
and
this
man
who
was
dimly
*NL*
gazing
at
him
through
tears
that
filled
his
swollen
eyes
.
He
remembered
*NL*
everything
,
and
ecstatic
pity
and
love
for
that
man
overflowed
his
happy
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
and
wept
tender
loving
*NL*
tears
for
his
fellow
men
,
for
himself
,
and
for
his
own
and
their
errors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compassion
,
love
of
our
brothers
,
for
those
who
love
us
and
for
those
*NL*
who
hate
us
,
love
of
our
enemies
;
yes
,
that
love
which
God
preached
on
*NL*
earth
and
which
Princess
Mary
taught
me
and
I
did
not
understand
--
that
*NL*
is
what
made
me
sorry
to
part
with
life
,
that
is
what
remained
for
me
*NL*
had
I
lived
.
But
now
it
is
too
late
.
I
know
it
!

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
terrible
spectacle
of
the
battlefield
covered
with
dead
and
wounded
,
*NL*
together
with
the
heaviness
of
his
head
and
the
news
that
some
twenty
*NL*
generals
he
knew
personally
had
been
killed
or
wounded
,
and
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
impotence
of
his
once
mighty
arm
,
produced
an
*NL*
unexpected
impression
on
Napoleon
who
usually
liked
to
look
at
the
*NL*
killed
and
wounded
,
thereby
,
he
considered
,
testing
his
strength
of
*NL*
mind
.
This
day
the
horrible
appearance
of
the
battlefield
overcame
that
*NL*
strength
of
mind
which
he
thought
constituted
his
merit
and
his
*NL*
greatness
.
He
rode
hurriedly
from
the
battlefield
and
returned
to
the
*NL*
Shevardino
knoll
,
where
he
sat
on
his
campstool
,
his
sallow
face
swollen
*NL*
and
heavy
,
his
eyes
dim
,
his
nose
red
,
and
his
voice
hoarse
,
*NL*
involuntarily
listening
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
to
the
sounds
of
firing
.
*NL*
With
painful
dejection
he
awaited
the
end
of
this
action
,
in
which
he
*NL*
regarded
himself
as
a
participant
and
which
he
was
unable
to
arrest
.
A
*NL*
personal
,
human
feeling
for
a
brief
moment
got
the
better
of
the
*NL*
artificial
phantasm
of
life
he
had
served
so
long
.
He
felt
in
his
own
*NL*
person
the
sufferings
and
death
he
had
witnessed
on
the
battlefield
.
The
*NL*
heaviness
of
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
of
the
possibility
of
*NL*
suffering
and
death
for
himself
.
At
that
moment
he
did
not
desire
*NL*
Moscow
,
or
victory
,
or
glory
-LRB-
what
need
had
he
for
any
more
glory
?
-RRB-
.
The
*NL*
one
thing
he
wished
for
was
rest
,
tranquillity
,
and
freedom
.
But
when
he
*NL*
had
been
on
the
Semenovsk
heights
the
artillery
commander
had
proposed
*NL*
to
him
to
bring
several
batteries
of
artillery
up
to
those
heights
to
*NL*
strengthen
the
fire
on
the
Russian
troops
crowded
in
front
of
Knyazkovo
.
*NL*
Napoleon
had
assented
and
had
given
orders
that
news
should
be
brought
*NL*
to
him
of
the
effect
those
batteries
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
adjutant
came
now
to
inform
him
that
the
fire
of
two
hundred
guns
had
*NL*
been
concentrated
on
the
Russians
,
as
he
had
ordered
,
but
that
they
*NL*
still
held
their
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
fire
is
mowing
them
down
by
rows
,
but
still
they
hold
on
,
''
said
the
*NL*
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
more
!
...
''
said
Napoleon
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
?
''
asked
the
adjutant
who
had
not
heard
the
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
more
!
''
croaked
Napoleon
frowning
.
``
Let
them
have
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
before
he
gave
that
order
the
thing
he
did
not
desire
,
and
for
*NL*
which
he
gave
the
order
only
because
he
thought
it
was
expected
of
him
,
*NL*
was
being
done
.
And
he
fell
back
into
that
artificial
realm
of
imaginary
*NL*
greatness
,
and
again
--
as
a
horse
walking
a
treadmill
thinks
it
is
doing
*NL*
something
for
itself
--
he
submissively
fulfilled
the
cruel
,
sad
,
gloomy
,
*NL*
and
inhuman
role
predestined
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
for
that
day
and
hour
alone
were
the
mind
and
conscience
*NL*
darkened
of
this
man
on
whom
the
responsibility
for
what
was
happening
*NL*
lay
more
than
on
all
the
others
who
took
part
in
it
.
Never
to
the
end
of
*NL*
his
life
could
he
understand
goodness
,
beauty
,
or
truth
,
or
the
*NL*
significance
of
his
actions
which
were
too
contrary
to
goodness
and
*NL*
truth
,
too
remote
from
everything
human
,
for
him
ever
to
be
able
to
*NL*
grasp
their
meaning
.
He
could
not
disavow
his
actions
,
belauded
as
they
*NL*
were
by
half
the
world
,
and
so
he
had
to
repudiate
truth
,
goodness
,
and
*NL*
all
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
on
that
day
,
as
he
rode
over
the
battlefield
strewn
with
men
*NL*
killed
and
maimed
-LRB-
by
his
will
as
he
believed
-RRB-
,
did
he
reckon
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
them
how
many
Russians
there
were
for
each
Frenchman
and
,
*NL*
deceiving
himself
,
find
reason
for
rejoicing
in
the
calculation
that
*NL*
there
were
five
Russians
for
every
Frenchman
.
Not
on
that
day
alone
did
*NL*
he
write
in
a
letter
to
Paris
that
``
the
battle
field
was
superb
,
''
*NL*
because
fifty
thousand
corpses
lay
there
,
but
even
on
the
island
of
St.
*NL*
Helena
in
the
peaceful
solitude
where
he
said
he
intended
to
devote
his
*NL*
leisure
to
an
account
of
the
great
deeds
he
had
done
,
he
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
war
should
have
been
the
most
popular
war
of
modern
times
:
*NL*
it
was
a
war
of
good
sense
,
for
real
interests
,
for
the
tranquillity
and
*NL*
security
of
all
;
it
was
purely
pacific
and
conservative
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
war
for
a
great
cause
,
the
end
of
uncertainties
and
the
*NL*
beginning
of
security
.
A
new
horizon
and
new
labors
were
opening
out
,
*NL*
full
of
well-being
and
prosperity
for
all
.
The
European
system
was
*NL*
already
founded
;
all
that
remained
was
to
organize
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
on
these
great
points
and
with
tranquility
everywhere
,
I
too
*NL*
should
have
had
my
Congress
and
my
Holy
Alliance
.
Those
ideas
were
*NL*
stolen
from
me
.
In
that
reunion
of
great
sovereigns
we
should
have
*NL*
discussed
our
interests
like
one
family
,
and
have
rendered
account
to
*NL*
the
peoples
as
clerk
to
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Europe
would
in
this
way
soon
have
been
,
in
fact
,
but
one
people
,
and
*NL*
anyone
who
traveled
anywhere
would
have
found
himself
always
in
the
*NL*
common
fatherland
.
I
should
have
demanded
the
freedom
of
all
navigable
*NL*
rivers
for
everybody
,
that
the
seas
should
be
common
to
all
,
and
that
*NL*
the
great
standing
armies
should
be
reduced
henceforth
to
mere
guards
*NL*
for
the
sovereigns
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
to
France
,
to
the
bosom
of
the
great
,
strong
,
magnificent
,
*NL*
peaceful
,
and
glorious
fatherland
,
I
should
have
proclaimed
her
*NL*
frontiers
immutable
;
all
future
wars
purely
defensive
,
all
*NL*
aggrandizement
antinational
.
I
should
have
associated
my
son
in
the
*NL*
Empire
;
my
dictatorship
would
have
been
finished
,
and
his
constitutional
*NL*
reign
would
have
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
would
have
been
the
capital
of
the
world
,
and
the
French
the
envy
*NL*
of
the
nations
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
leisure
then
,
and
my
old
age
,
would
have
been
devoted
,
in
company
*NL*
with
the
Empress
and
during
the
royal
apprenticeship
of
my
son
,
to
*NL*
leisurely
visiting
,
with
our
own
horses
and
like
a
true
country
couple
,
*NL*
every
corner
of
the
Empire
,
receiving
complaints
,
redressing
wrongs
,
and
*NL*
scattering
public
buildings
and
benefactions
on
all
sides
and
*NL*
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
predestined
by
Providence
for
the
gloomy
role
of
executioner
*NL*
of
the
peoples
,
assured
himself
that
the
aim
of
his
actions
had
been
the
*NL*
peoples
'
welfare
and
that
he
could
control
the
fate
of
millions
and
by
*NL*
the
employment
of
power
confer
benefactions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
four
hundred
thousand
who
crossed
the
Vistula
,
''
he
wrote
further
of
*NL*
the
Russian
war
,
``
half
were
Austrians
,
Prussians
,
Saxons
,
Poles
,
*NL*
Bavarians
,
Wurttembergers
,
Mecklenburgers
,
Spaniards
,
Italians
,
and
*NL*
Neapolitans
.
The
Imperial
army
,
strictly
speaking
,
was
one
third
*NL*
composed
of
Dutch
,
Belgians
,
men
from
the
borders
of
the
Rhine
,
*NL*
Piedmontese
,
Swiss
,
Genevese
,
Tuscans
,
Romans
,
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
Thirty-second
Military
Division
,
of
Bremen
,
of
Hamburg
,
and
so
on
:
it
*NL*
included
scarcely
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
who
spoke
French
.
The
*NL*
Russian
expedition
actually
cost
France
less
than
fifty
thousand
men
;
*NL*
the
Russian
army
in
its
retreat
from
Vilna
to
Moscow
lost
in
the
various
*NL*
battles
four
times
more
men
than
the
French
army
;
the
burning
of
Moscow
*NL*
cost
the
lives
of
a
hundred
thousand
Russians
who
died
of
cold
and
want
*NL*
in
the
woods
;
finally
,
in
its
march
from
Moscow
to
the
Oder
the
Russian
*NL*
army
also
suffered
from
the
severity
of
the
season
;
so
that
by
the
time
*NL*
it
reached
Vilna
it
numbered
only
fifty
thousand
,
and
at
Kalisch
less
*NL*
than
eighteen
thousand
.

He
imagined
that
the
war
with
Russia
came
about
by
his
will
,
and
the
*NL*
horrors
that
occurred
did
not
stagger
his
soul
.
He
boldly
took
the
whole
*NL*
responsibility
for
what
happened
,
and
his
darkened
mind
found
*NL*
justification
in
the
belief
that
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who

perished
there
were
fewer
Frenchmen

Hessians

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
Several
tens
of
thousands
of
the
slain
lay
in
diverse
postures
and
*NL*
various
uniforms
on
the
fields
and
meadows
belonging
to
the
Davydov
*NL*
family
and
to
the
crown
serfs
--
those
fields
and
meadows
where
for
*NL*
hundreds
of
years
the
peasants
of
Borodino
,
Gorki
,
Shevardino
,
and
*NL*
Semenovsk
had
reaped
their
harvests
and
pastured
their
cattle
.
At
the
*NL*
dressing
stations
the
grass
and
earth
were
soaked
with
blood
for
a
space
*NL*
of
some
three
acres
around
.
Crowds
of
men
of
various
arms
,
wounded
and
*NL*
unwounded
,
with
frightened
faces
,
dragged
themselves
back
to
Mozhaysk
*NL*
from
the
one
army
and
back
to
Valuevo
from
the
other
.
Other
crowds
,
*NL*
exhausted
and
hungry
,
went
forward
led
by
their
officers
.
Others
held
*NL*
their
ground
and
continued
to
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
whole
field
,
previously
so
gaily
beautiful
with
the
glitter
of
*NL*
bayonets
and
cloudlets
of
smoke
in
the
morning
sun
,
there
now
spread
a
*NL*
mist
of
damp
and
smoke
and
a
strange
acid
smell
of
saltpeter
and
blood
.
*NL*
Clouds
gathered
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
dead
and
wounded
,
*NL*
on
the
frightened
,
exhausted
,
and
hesitating
men
,
as
if
to
say
:
``
Enough
,
*NL*
men
!
Enough
!
Cease
...
bethink
yourselves
!
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
men
of
both
sides
alike
,
worn
out
by
want
of
food
and
rest
,
it
*NL*
began
equally
to
appear
doubtful
whether
they
should
continue
to
*NL*
slaughter
one
another
;
all
the
faces
expressed
hesitation
,
and
the
*NL*
question
arose
in
every
soul
:
``
For
what
,
for
whom
,
must
I
kill
and
be
*NL*
killed
?
...
You
may
go
and
kill
whom
you
please
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
do
*NL*
so
anymore
!
''
By
evening
this
thought
had
ripened
in
every
soul
.
At
any
*NL*
moment
these
men
might
have
been
seized
with
horror
at
what
they
were
*NL*
doing
and
might
have
thrown
up
everything
and
run
away
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
toward
the
end
of
the
battle
the
men
felt
all
the
horror
of
*NL*
what
they
were
doing
,
though
they
would
have
been
glad
to
leave
off
,
*NL*
some
incomprehensible
,
mysterious
power
continued
to
control
them
,
and
*NL*
they
still
brought
up
the
charges
,
loaded
,
aimed
,
and
applied
the
match
,
*NL*
though
only
one
artilleryman
survived
out
of
every
three
,
and
though
*NL*
they
stumbled
and
panted
with
fatigue
,
perspiring
and
stained
with
blood
*NL*
and
powder
.
The
cannon
balls
flew
just
as
swiftly
and
cruelly
from
both
*NL*
sides
,
crushing
human
bodies
,
and
that
terrible
work
which
was
not
done
*NL*
by
the
will
of
a
man
but
at
the
will
of
Him
who
governs
men
and
worlds
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anyone
looking
at
the
disorganized
rear
of
the
Russian
army
would
have
*NL*
said
that
,
if
only
the
French
made
one
more
slight
effort
,
it
would
*NL*
disappear
;
and
anyone
looking
at
the
rear
of
the
French
army
would
have
*NL*
said
that
the
Russians
need
only
make
one
more
slight
effort
and
the
*NL*
French
would
be
destroyed
.
But
neither
the
French
nor
the
Russians
made
*NL*
that
effort
,
and
the
flame
of
battle
burned
slowly
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
did
not
make
that
effort
because
they
were
not
attacking
*NL*
the
French
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
battle
they
stood
blocking
the
way
*NL*
to
Moscow
and
they
still
did
so
at
the
end
of
the
battle
as
at
the
*NL*
beginning
.
But
even
had
the
aim
of
the
Russians
been
to
drive
the
French
*NL*
from
their
positions
,
they
could
not
have
made
this
last
effort
,
for
all
*NL*
the
Russian
troops
had
been
broken
up
,
there
was
no
part
of
the
Russian
*NL*
army
that
had
not
suffered
in
the
battle
,
and
though
still
holding
their
*NL*
positions
they
had
lost
ONE
HALF
of
their
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
with
the
memory
of
all
their
former
victories
during
fifteen
*NL*
years
,
with
the
assurance
of
Napoleon
's
invincibility
,
with
the
*NL*
consciousness
that
they
had
captured
part
of
the
battlefield
and
had
*NL*
lost
only
a
quarter
of
their
men
and
still
had
their
Guards
intact
,
*NL*
twenty
thousand
strong
,
might
easily
have
made
that
effort
.
The
French
*NL*
who
had
attacked
the
Russian
army
in
order
to
drive
it
from
its
position
*NL*
ought
to
have
made
that
effort
,
for
as
long
as
the
Russians
continued
to
*NL*
block
the
road
to
Moscow
as
before
,
the
aim
of
the
French
had
not
been
*NL*
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
in
vain
.
But
the
French
*NL*
did
not
make
that
effort
.
Some
historians
say
that
Napoleon
need
only
*NL*
have
used
his
Old
Guards
,
who
were
intact
,
and
the
battle
would
have
*NL*
been
won
.
To
speak
of
what
would
have
happened
had
Napoleon
sent
his
*NL*
Guards
is
like
talking
of
what
would
happen
if
autumn
became
spring
.
It
*NL*
could
not
be
.
Napoleon
did
not
give
his
Guards
,
not
because
he
did
not
*NL*
want
to
,
but
because
it
could
not
be
done
.
All
the
generals
,
officers
,
*NL*
and
soldiers
of
the
French
army
knew
it
could
not
be
done
,
because
the
*NL*
flagging
spirit
of
the
troops
would
not
permit
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
Napoleon
alone
who
had
experienced
that
nightmare
feeling
of
*NL*
the
mighty
arm
being
stricken
powerless
,
but
all
the
generals
and
*NL*
soldiers
of
his
army
whether
they
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
or
not
,
*NL*
after
all
their
experience
of
previous
battles
--
when
after
one
tenth
of
*NL*
such
efforts
the
enemy
had
fled
--
experienced
a
similar
feeling
of
terror
*NL*
before
an
enemy
who
,
after
losing
HALF
his
men
,
stood
as
threateningly
*NL*
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
.
The
moral
force
of
the
*NL*
attacking
French
army
was
exhausted
.
Not
that
sort
of
victory
which
is
*NL*
defined
by
the
capture
of
pieces
of
material
fastened
to
sticks
,
called
*NL*
standards
,
and
of
the
ground
on
which
the
troops
had
stood
and
were
*NL*
standing
,
but
a
moral
victory
that
convinces
the
enemy
of
the
moral
*NL*
superiority
of
his
opponent
and
of
his
own
impotence
was
gained
by
the
*NL*
Russians
at
Borodino
.
The
French
invaders
,
like
an
infuriated
animal
*NL*
that
has
in
its
onslaught
received
a
mortal
wound
,
felt
that
they
were
*NL*
perishing
,
but
could
not
stop
,
any
more
than
the
Russian
army
,
weaker
by
*NL*
one
half
,
could
help
swerving
.
By
impetus
gained
,
the
French
army
was
*NL*
still
able
to
roll
forward
to
Moscow
,
but
there
,
without
further
effort
*NL*
on
the
part
of
the
Russians
,
it
had
to
perish
,
bleeding
from
the
mortal
*NL*
wound
it
had
received
at
Borodino
.
The
direct
consequence
of
the
battle
*NL*
of
Borodino
was
Napoleon
's
senseless
flight
from
Moscow
,
his
retreat
*NL*
along
the
old
Smolensk
road
,
the
destruction
of
the
invading
army
of
*NL*
five
hundred
thousand
men
,
and
the
downfall
of
Napoleonic
France
,
on
*NL*
which
at
Borodino
for
the
first
time
the
hand
of
an
opponent
of
stronger
*NL*
spirit
had
been
laid
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Absolute
continuity
of
motion
is
not
comprehensible
to
the
human
mind
.
*NL*
Laws
of
motion
of
any
kind
become
comprehensible
to
man
only
when
he
*NL*
examines
arbitrarily
selected
elements
of
that
motion
;
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
a
large
proportion
of
human
error
comes
from
the
arbitrary
*NL*
division
of
continuous
motion
into
discontinuous
elements
.
There
is
a
*NL*
well
known
,
so-called
sophism
of
the
ancients
consisting
in
this
,
that
*NL*
Achilles
could
never
catch
up
with
a
tortoise
he
was
following
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
he
traveled
ten
times
as
fast
as
the
tortoise
.
By
the
*NL*
time
Achilles
has
covered
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
*NL*
tortoise
,
the
tortoise
has
covered
one
tenth
of
that
distance
ahead
of
*NL*
him
:
when
Achilles
has
covered
that
tenth
,
the
tortoise
has
covered
*NL*
another
one
hundredth
,
and
so
on
forever
.
This
problem
seemed
to
the
*NL*
ancients
insoluble
.
The
absurd
answer
-LRB-
that
Achilles
could
never
*NL*
overtake
the
tortoise
-RRB-
resulted
from
this
:
that
motion
was
arbitrarily
*NL*
divided
into
discontinuous
elements
,
whereas
the
motion
both
of
Achilles
*NL*
and
of
the
tortoise
was
continuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
adopting
smaller
and
smaller
elements
of
motion
we
only
approach
a
*NL*
solution
of
the
problem
,
but
never
reach
it
.
Only
when
we
have
admitted
*NL*
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
small
,
and
the
resulting
geometrical
*NL*
progression
with
a
common
ratio
of
one
tenth
,
and
have
found
the
sum
of
*NL*
this
progression
to
infinity
,
do
we
reach
a
solution
of
the
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
modern
branch
of
mathematics
having
achieved
the
art
of
dealing
with
*NL*
the
infinitely
small
can
now
yield
solutions
in
other
more
complex
*NL*
problems
of
motion
which
used
to
appear
insoluble
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
modern
branch
of
mathematics
,
unknown
to
the
ancients
,
when
dealing
*NL*
with
problems
of
motion
admits
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
small
,
*NL*
and
so
conforms
to
the
chief
condition
of
motion
-LRB-
absolute
continuity
-RRB-
*NL*
and
thereby
corrects
the
inevitable
error
which
the
human
mind
can
not
*NL*
avoid
when
it
deals
with
separate
elements
of
motion
instead
of
*NL*
examining
continuous
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
seeking
the
laws
of
historical
movement
just
the
same
thing
happens
.
*NL*
The
movement
of
humanity
,
arising
as
it
does
from
innumerable
arbitrary
*NL*
human
wills
,
is
continuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
understand
the
laws
of
this
continuous
movement
is
the
aim
of
*NL*
history
.
But
to
arrive
at
these
laws
,
resulting
from
the
sum
of
all
*NL*
those
human
wills
,
man
's
mind
postulates
arbitrary
and
disconnected
*NL*
units
.
The
first
method
of
history
is
to
take
an
arbitrarily
selected
*NL*
series
of
continuous
events
and
examine
it
apart
from
others
,
though
*NL*
there
is
and
can
be
no
beginning
to
any
event
,
for
one
event
always
*NL*
flows
uninterruptedly
from
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
method
is
to
consider
the
actions
of
some
one
man
--
a
king
or
*NL*
a
commander
--
as
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
many
individual
wills
;
whereas
*NL*
the
sum
of
individual
wills
is
never
expressed
by
the
activity
of
a
*NL*
single
historic
personage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Historical
science
in
its
endeavor
to
draw
nearer
to
truth
continually
*NL*
takes
smaller
and
smaller
units
for
examination
.
But
however
small
the
*NL*
units
it
takes
,
we
feel
that
to
take
any
unit
disconnected
from
others
,
*NL*
or
to
assume
a
beginning
of
any
phenomenon
,
or
to
say
that
the
will
of
*NL*
many
men
is
expressed
by
the
actions
of
any
one
historic
personage
,
is
*NL*
in
itself
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
needs
no
critical
exertion
to
reduce
utterly
to
dust
any
deductions
*NL*
drawn
from
history
.
It
is
merely
necessary
to
select
some
larger
or
*NL*
smaller
unit
as
the
subject
of
observation
--
as
criticism
has
every
right
*NL*
to
do
,
seeing
that
whatever
unit
history
observes
must
always
be
*NL*
arbitrarily
selected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
taking
infinitesimally
small
units
for
observation
-LRB-
the
*NL*
differential
of
history
,
that
is
,
the
individual
tendencies
of
men
-RRB-
and
*NL*
attaining
to
the
art
of
integrating
them
-LRB-
that
is
,
finding
the
sum
of
*NL*
these
infinitesimals
-RRB-
can
we
hope
to
arrive
at
the
laws
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
fifteen
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
Europe
present
an
*NL*
extraordinary
movement
of
millions
of
people
.
Men
leave
their
customary
*NL*
pursuits
,
hasten
from
one
side
of
Europe
to
the
other
,
plunder
and
*NL*
slaughter
one
another
,
triumph
and
are
plunged
in
despair
,
and
for
some
*NL*
years
the
whole
course
of
life
is
altered
and
presents
an
intensive
*NL*
movement
which
first
increases
and
then
slackens
.
What
was
the
cause
of
*NL*
this
movement
,
by
what
laws
was
it
governed
?
asks
the
mind
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
,
replying
to
this
question
,
lay
before
us
the
sayings
and
*NL*
doings
of
a
few
dozen
men
in
a
building
in
the
city
of
Paris
,
calling
*NL*
these
sayings
and
doings
``
the
Revolution
''
;
then
they
give
a
detailed
*NL*
biography
of
Napoleon
and
of
certain
people
favorable
or
hostile
to
him
;
*NL*
tell
of
the
influence
some
of
these
people
had
on
others
,
and
say
:
that
*NL*
is
why
this
movement
took
place
and
those
are
its
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
mind
of
man
not
only
refuses
to
believe
this
explanation
,
but
*NL*
plainly
says
that
this
method
of
explanation
is
fallacious
,
because
in
*NL*
it
a
weaker
phenomenon
is
taken
as
the
cause
of
a
stronger
.
The
sum
of
*NL*
human
wills
produced
the
Revolution
and
Napoleon
,
and
only
the
sum
of
*NL*
those
wills
first
tolerated
and
then
destroyed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
every
time
there
have
been
conquests
there
have
been
conquerors
;
*NL*
every
time
there
has
been
a
revolution
in
any
state
there
have
been
*NL*
great
men
,
''
says
history
.
And
,
indeed
,
human
reason
replies
:
every
time
*NL*
conquerors
appear
there
have
been
wars
,
but
this
does
not
prove
that
the
*NL*
conquerors
caused
the
wars
and
that
it
is
possible
to
find
the
laws
of
a
*NL*
war
in
the
personal
activity
of
a
single
man
.
Whenever
I
look
at
my
*NL*
watch
and
its
hands
point
to
ten
,
I
hear
the
bells
of
the
neighboring
*NL*
church
;
but
because
the
bells
begin
to
ring
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
*NL*
reach
ten
,
I
have
no
right
to
assume
that
the
movement
of
the
bells
is
*NL*
caused
by
the
position
of
the
hands
of
the
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
I
see
the
movement
of
a
locomotive
I
hear
the
whistle
and
see
*NL*
the
valves
opening
and
wheels
turning
;
but
I
have
no
right
to
conclude
*NL*
that
the
whistling
and
the
turning
of
wheels
are
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
engine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasants
say
that
a
cold
wind
blows
in
late
spring
because
the
oaks
*NL*
are
budding
,
and
really
every
spring
cold
winds
do
blow
when
the
oak
is
*NL*
budding
.
But
though
I
do
not
know
what
causes
the
cold
winds
to
blow
*NL*
when
the
oak
buds
unfold
,
I
can
not
agree
with
the
peasants
that
the
*NL*
unfolding
of
the
oak
buds
is
the
cause
of
the
cold
wind
,
for
the
force
*NL*
of
the
wind
is
beyond
the
influence
of
the
buds
.
I
see
only
a
*NL*
coincidence
of
occurrences
such
as
happens
with
all
the
phenomena
of
*NL*
life
,
and
I
see
that
however
much
and
however
carefully
I
observe
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
watch
,
and
the
valves
and
wheels
of
the
engine
,
and
the
*NL*
oak
,
I
shall
not
discover
the
cause
of
the
bells
ringing
,
the
engine
*NL*
moving
,
or
of
the
winds
of
spring
.
To
that
I
must
entirely
change
my
*NL*
point
of
view
and
study
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
steam
,
of
the
bells
,
*NL*
and
of
the
wind
.
History
must
do
the
same
.
And
attempts
in
this
*NL*
direction
have
already
been
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
study
the
laws
of
history
we
must
completely
change
the
subject
of
*NL*
our
observation
,
must
leave
aside
kings
,
ministers
,
and
generals
,
and
*NL*
study
the
common
,
infinitesimally
small
elements
by
which
the
masses
are
*NL*
moved
.
No
one
can
say
in
how
far
it
is
possible
for
man
to
advance
in
*NL*
this
way
toward
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
history
;
but
it
is
*NL*
evident
that
only
along
that
path
does
the
possibility
of
discovering
*NL*
the
laws
of
history
lie
,
and
that
as
yet
not
a
millionth
part
as
much
*NL*
mental
effort
has
been
applied
in
this
direction
by
historians
as
has
*NL*
been
devoted
to
describing
the
actions
of
various
kings
,
commanders
,
and
*NL*
ministers
and
propounding
the
historians
'
own
reflections
concerning
*NL*
these
actions
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
forces
of
a
dozen
European
nations
burst
into
Russia
.
The
Russian
*NL*
army
and
people
avoided
a
collision
till
Smolensk
was
reached
,
and
again
*NL*
from
Smolensk
to
Borodino
.
The
French
army
pushed
on
to
Moscow
,
its
*NL*
goal
,
its
impetus
ever
increasing
as
it
neared
its
aim
,
just
as
the
*NL*
velocity
of
a
falling
body
increases
as
it
approaches
the
earth
.
Behind
*NL*
it
were
seven
hundred
miles
of
hunger-stricken
,
hostile
country
;
ahead
*NL*
were
a
few
dozen
miles
separating
it
from
its
goal
.
Every
soldier
in
*NL*
Napoleon
's
army
felt
this
and
the
invasion
moved
on
by
its
own
momentum
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
the
Russian
army
retreated
the
more
fiercely
a
spirit
of
hatred
*NL*
of
the
enemy
flared
up
,
and
while
it
retreated
the
army
increased
and
*NL*
consolidated
.
At
Borodino
a
collision
took
place
.
Neither
army
was
*NL*
broken
up
,
but
the
Russian
army
retreated
immediately
after
the
*NL*
collision
as
inevitably
as
a
ball
recoils
after
colliding
with
another
*NL*
having
a
greater
momentum
,
and
with
equal
inevitability
the
ball
of
*NL*
invasion
that
had
advanced
with
such
momentum
rolled
on
for
some
*NL*
distance
,
though
the
collision
had
deprived
it
of
all
its
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
retreated
eighty
miles
--
to
beyond
Moscow
--
and
the
French
*NL*
reached
Moscow
and
there
came
to
a
standstill
.
For
five
weeks
after
that
*NL*
there
was
not
a
single
battle
.
The
French
did
not
move
.
As
a
bleeding
,
*NL*
mortally
wounded
animal
licks
its
wounds
,
they
remained
inert
in
Moscow
*NL*
for
five
weeks
,
and
then
suddenly
,
with
no
fresh
reason
,
fled
back
:
they
*NL*
made
a
dash
for
the
Kaluga
road
,
and
-LRB-
after
a
victory
--
for
at
Malo
-
*NL*
Yaroslavets
the
field
of
conflict
again
remained
theirs
-RRB-
without
*NL*
undertaking
a
single
serious
battle
,
they
fled
still
more
rapidly
back
*NL*
to
Smolensk
,
beyond
Smolensk
,
beyond
the
Berezina
,
beyond
Vilna
,
and
*NL*
farther
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
,
Kutuzov
and
the
whole
*NL*
Russian
army
were
convinced
that
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
a
victory
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
reported
so
to
the
Emperor
.
He
gave
orders
to
prepare
for
a
*NL*
fresh
conflict
to
finish
the
enemy
and
did
this
not
to
deceive
anyone
,
*NL*
but
because
he
knew
that
the
enemy
was
beaten
,
as
everyone
who
had
taken
*NL*
part
in
the
battle
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
that
evening
and
next
day
reports
came
in
one
after
another
of
*NL*
unheard-of
losses
,
of
the
loss
of
half
the
army
,
and
a
fresh
battle
*NL*
proved
physically
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
give
battle
before
information
had
been
collected
,
*NL*
the
wounded
gathered
in
,
the
supplies
of
ammunition
replenished
,
the
*NL*
slain
reckoned
up
,
new
officers
appointed
to
replace
those
who
had
been
*NL*
killed
,
and
before
the
men
had
had
food
and
sleep
.
And
meanwhile
,
the
*NL*
very
next
morning
after
the
battle
,
the
French
army
advanced
of
itself
*NL*
upon
the
Russians
,
carried
forward
by
the
force
of
its
own
momentum
now
*NL*
seemingly
increased
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
*NL*
from
its
aim
.
Kutuzov
's
wish
was
to
attack
next
day
,
and
the
whole
army
*NL*
desired
to
do
so
.
But
to
make
an
attack
the
wish
to
do
so
is
not
*NL*
sufficient
,
there
must
also
be
a
possibility
of
doing
it
,
and
that
*NL*
possibility
did
not
exist
.
It
was
impossible
not
to
retreat
a
day
's
*NL*
march
,
and
then
in
the
same
way
it
was
impossible
not
to
retreat
another
*NL*
and
a
third
day
's
march
,
and
at
last
,
on
the
first
of
September
when
the
*NL*
army
drew
near
Moscow
--
despite
the
strength
of
the
feeling
that
had
*NL*
arisen
in
all
ranks
--
the
force
of
circumstances
compelled
it
to
retire
*NL*
beyond
Moscow
.
And
the
troops
retired
one
more
,
last
,
day
's
march
,
and
*NL*
abandoned
Moscow
to
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
people
accustomed
to
think
that
plans
of
campaign
and
battles
are
*NL*
made
by
generals
--
as
any
one
of
us
sitting
over
a
map
in
his
study
may
*NL*
imagine
how
he
would
have
arranged
things
in
this
or
that
battle
--
the
*NL*
questions
present
themselves
:
Why
did
Kutuzov
during
the
retreat
not
do
*NL*
this
or
that
?
Why
did
he
not
take
up
a
position
before
reaching
Fili
?
*NL*
Why
did
he
not
retire
at
once
by
the
Kaluga
road
,
abandoning
Moscow
?
and
*NL*
so
on
.
People
accustomed
to
think
in
that
way
forget
,
or
do
not
know
,
*NL*
the
inevitable
conditions
which
always
limit
the
activities
of
any
*NL*
commander
in
chief
.
The
activity
of
a
commander-in-chief
does
not
at
all
*NL*
resemble
the
activity
we
imagine
to
ourselves
when
we
sit
at
ease
in
our
*NL*
studies
examining
some
campaign
on
the
map
,
with
a
certain
number
of
*NL*
troops
on
this
and
that
side
in
a
certain
known
locality
,
and
begin
our
*NL*
plans
from
some
given
moment
.
A
commander-in-chief
is
never
dealing
with
*NL*
the
beginning
of
any
event
--
the
position
from
which
we
always
*NL*
contemplate
it
.
The
commander-in-chief
is
always
in
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
series
of
shifting
events
and
so
he
never
can
at
any
moment
consider
the
*NL*
whole
import
of
an
event
that
is
occurring
.
Moment
by
moment
the
event
*NL*
is
imperceptibly
shaping
itself
,
and
at
every
moment
of
this
continuous
,
*NL*
uninterrupted
shaping
of
events
the
commander-in-chief
is
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
most
complex
play
of
intrigues
,
worries
,
contingencies
,
*NL*
authorities
,
projects
,
counsels
,
threats
,
and
deceptions
and
is
*NL*
continually
obliged
to
reply
to
innumerable
questions
addressed
to
him
,
*NL*
which
constantly
conflict
with
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Learned
military
authorities
quite
seriously
tell
us
that
Kutuzov
should
*NL*
have
moved
his
army
to
the
Kaluga
road
long
before
reaching
Fili
,
and
*NL*
that
somebody
actually
submitted
such
a
proposal
to
him
.
But
a
commander
*NL*
in
chief
,
especially
at
a
difficult
moment
,
has
always
before
him
not
*NL*
one
proposal
but
dozens
simultaneously
.
And
all
these
proposals
,
based
*NL*
on
strategics
and
tactics
,
contradict
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
commander-in-chief
's
business
,
it
would
seem
,
is
simply
to
choose
one
*NL*
of
these
projects
.
But
even
that
he
can
not
do
.
Events
and
time
do
not
*NL*
wait
.
For
instance
,
on
the
twenty-eighth
it
is
suggested
to
him
to
cross
*NL*
to
the
Kaluga
road
,
but
just
then
an
adjutant
gallops
up
from
*NL*
Miloradovich
asking
whether
he
is
to
engage
the
French
or
retire
.
An
*NL*
order
must
be
given
him
at
once
,
that
instant
.
And
the
order
to
retreat
*NL*
carries
us
past
the
turn
to
the
Kaluga
road
.
And
after
the
adjutant
*NL*
comes
the
commissary
general
asking
where
the
stores
are
to
be
taken
,
*NL*
and
the
chief
of
the
hospitals
asks
where
the
wounded
are
to
go
,
and
a
*NL*
courier
from
Petersburg
brings
a
letter
from
the
sovereign
which
does
*NL*
not
admit
of
the
possibility
of
abandoning
Moscow
,
and
the
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
's
rival
,
the
man
who
is
undermining
him
-LRB-
and
there
are
always
not
*NL*
merely
one
but
several
such
-RRB-
,
presents
a
new
project
diametrically
*NL*
opposed
to
that
of
turning
to
the
Kaluga
road
,
and
the
commander-in
-
*NL*
chief
himself
needs
sleep
and
refreshment
to
maintain
his
energy
and
a
*NL*
respectable
general
who
has
been
overlooked
in
the
distribution
of
*NL*
rewards
comes
to
complain
,
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
pray
to
*NL*
be
defended
,
and
an
officer
sent
to
inspect
the
locality
comes
in
and
*NL*
gives
a
report
quite
contrary
to
what
was
said
by
the
officer
previously
*NL*
sent
;
and
a
spy
,
a
prisoner
,
and
a
general
who
has
been
on
*NL*
reconnaissance
,
all
describe
the
position
of
the
enemy
's
army
*NL*
differently
.
People
accustomed
to
misunderstand
or
to
forget
these
*NL*
inevitable
conditions
of
a
commander-in-chief
's
actions
describe
to
us
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
the
position
of
the
army
at
Fili
and
assume
that
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
could
,
on
the
first
of
September
,
quite
freely
decide
*NL*
whether
to
abandon
Moscow
or
defend
it
;
whereas
,
with
the
Russian
army
*NL*
less
than
four
miles
from
Moscow
,
no
such
question
existed
.
When
had
*NL*
that
question
been
settled
?
At
Drissa
and
at
Smolensk
and
most
palpably
*NL*
of
all
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
at
Shevardino
and
on
the
twenty
-
*NL*
sixth
at
Borodino
,
and
each
day
and
hour
and
minute
of
the
retreat
from
*NL*
Borodino
to
Fili
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ermolov
,
having
been
sent
by
Kutuzov
to
inspect
the
position
,
told
*NL*
the
field
marshal
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
there
before
Moscow
*NL*
and
that
they
must
retreat
,
Kutuzov
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
hand
,
''
said
he
and
,
turning
it
over
so
as
to
feel
the
*NL*
pulse
,
added
:
``
You
are
not
well
,
my
dear
fellow
.
Think
what
you
are
*NL*
saying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
could
not
yet
admit
the
possibility
of
retreating
beyond
Moscow
*NL*
without
a
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Poklonny
Hill
,
four
miles
from
the
Dorogomilov
gate
of
Moscow
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
got
out
of
his
carriage
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
roadside
.
*NL*
A
great
crowd
of
generals
gathered
round
him
,
and
Count
Rostopchin
,
who
*NL*
had
come
out
from
Moscow
,
joined
them
.
This
brilliant
company
separated
*NL*
into
several
groups
who
all
discussed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
*NL*
of
the
position
,
the
state
of
the
army
,
the
plans
suggested
,
the
*NL*
situation
of
Moscow
,
and
military
questions
generally
.
Though
they
had
*NL*
not
been
summoned
for
the
purpose
,
and
though
it
was
not
so
called
,
they
*NL*
all
felt
that
this
was
really
a
council
of
war
.
The
conversations
all
*NL*
dealt
with
public
questions
.
If
anyone
gave
or
asked
for
personal
news
,
*NL*
it
was
done
in
a
whisper
and
they
immediately
reverted
to
general
*NL*
matters
.
No
jokes
,
or
laughter
,
or
smiles
even
,
were
seen
among
all
*NL*
these
men
.
They
evidently
all
made
an
effort
to
hold
themselves
at
the
*NL*
height
the
situation
demanded
.
And
all
these
groups
,
while
talking
among
*NL*
themselves
,
tried
to
keep
near
the
commander-in-chief
-LRB-
whose
bench
*NL*
formed
the
center
of
the
gathering
-RRB-
and
to
speak
so
that
he
might
*NL*
overhear
them
.
The
commander
in
chief
listened
to
what
was
being
said
*NL*
and
sometimes
asked
them
to
repeat
their
remarks
,
but
did
not
himself
*NL*
take
part
in
the
conversations
or
express
any
opinion
.
After
hearing
*NL*
what
was
being
said
by
one
or
other
of
these
groups
he
generally
turned
*NL*
away
with
an
air
of
disappointment
,
as
though
they
were
not
speaking
of
*NL*
anything
he
wished
to
hear
.
Some
discussed
the
position
that
had
been
*NL*
chosen
,
criticizing
not
the
position
itself
so
much
as
the
mental
*NL*
capacity
of
those
who
had
chosen
it
.
Others
argued
that
a
mistake
had
*NL*
been
made
earlier
and
that
a
battle
should
have
been
fought
two
days
*NL*
before
.
Others
again
spoke
of
the
battle
of
Salamanca
,
which
was
*NL*
described
by
Crosart
,
a
newly
arrived
Frenchman
in
a
Spanish
uniform
.
*NL*
-LRB-
This
Frenchman
and
one
of
the
German
princes
serving
with
the
Russian
*NL*
army
were
discussing
the
siege
of
Saragossa
and
considering
the
*NL*
possibility
of
defending
Moscow
in
a
similar
manner
.
-RRB-
Count
Rostopchin
*NL*
was
telling
a
fourth
group
that
he
was
prepared
to
die
with
the
city
*NL*
train
bands
under
the
walls
of
the
capital
,
but
that
he
still
could
not
*NL*
help
regretting
having
been
left
in
ignorance
of
what
was
happening
,
and
*NL*
that
had
he
known
it
sooner
things
would
have
been
different
...
A
fifth
*NL*
group
,
displaying
the
profundity
of
their
strategic
perceptions
,
*NL*
discussed
the
direction
the
troops
would
now
have
to
take
.
A
sixth
group
*NL*
was
talking
absolute
nonsense
.
Kutuzov
's
expression
grew
more
and
more
*NL*
preoccupied
and
gloomy
.
From
all
this
talk
he
saw
only
one
thing
:
that
*NL*
to
defend
Moscow
was
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
full
meaning
of
*NL*
those
words
,
that
is
to
say
,
so
utterly
impossible
that
if
any
senseless
*NL*
commander
were
to
give
orders
to
fight
,
confusion
would
result
but
the
*NL*
battle
would
still
not
take
place
.
It
would
not
take
place
because
the
*NL*
commanders
not
merely
all
recognized
the
position
to
be
impossible
,
but
*NL*
in
their
conversations
were
only
discussing
what
would
happen
after
its
*NL*
inevitable
abandonment
.
How
could
the
commanders
lead
their
troops
to
a
*NL*
field
of
battle
they
considered
impossible
to
hold
?
The
lower-grade
*NL*
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
-LRB-
who
too
reason
-RRB-
also
considered
the
*NL*
position
impossible
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
fight
,
fully
convinced
*NL*
as
they
were
of
defeat
.
If
Bennigsen
insisted
on
the
position
being
*NL*
defended
and
others
still
discussed
it
,
the
question
was
no
longer
*NL*
important
in
itself
but
only
as
a
pretext
for
disputes
and
intrigue
.
*NL*
This
Kutuzov
knew
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bennigsen
,
who
had
chosen
the
position
,
warmly
displayed
his
Russian
*NL*
patriotism
-LRB-
Kutuzov
could
not
listen
to
this
without
wincing
-RRB-
by
*NL*
insisting
that
Moscow
must
be
defended
.
His
aim
was
as
clear
as
daylight
*NL*
to
Kutuzov
:
if
the
defense
failed
,
to
throw
the
blame
on
Kutuzov
who
had
*NL*
brought
the
army
as
far
as
the
Sparrow
Hills
without
giving
battle
;
if
*NL*
it
succeeded
,
to
claim
the
success
as
his
own
;
or
if
battle
were
not
*NL*
given
,
to
clear
himself
of
the
crime
of
abandoning
Moscow
.
But
this
*NL*
intrigue
did
not
now
occupy
the
old
man
's
mind
.
One
terrible
question
*NL*
absorbed
him
and
to
that
question
he
heard
no
reply
from
anyone
.
The
*NL*
question
for
him
now
was
:
``
Have
I
really
allowed
Napoleon
to
reach
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
when
did
I
do
so
?
When
was
it
decided
?
Can
it
have
been
*NL*
yesterday
when
I
ordered
Platov
to
retreat
,
or
was
it
the
evening
*NL*
before
,
when
I
had
a
nap
and
told
Bennigsen
to
issue
orders
?
Or
was
it
*NL*
earlier
still
?
...
When
,
when
was
this
terrible
affair
decided
?
Moscow
*NL*
must
be
abandoned
.
The
army
must
retreat
and
the
order
to
do
so
must
be
*NL*
given
.
''
To
give
that
terrible
order
seemed
to
him
equivalent
to
*NL*
resigning
the
command
of
the
army
.
And
not
only
did
he
love
power
to
*NL*
which
he
was
accustomed
-LRB-
the
honours
awarded
to
Prince
Prozorovski
,
*NL*
under
whom
he
had
served
in
Turkey
,
galled
him
-RRB-
,
but
he
was
convinced
*NL*
that
he
was
destined
to
save
Russia
and
that
that
was
why
,
against
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
wish
and
by
the
will
of
the
people
,
he
had
been
chosen
*NL*
commander-in-chief
.
He
was
convinced
that
he
alone
could
maintain
*NL*
command
of
the
army
in
these
difficult
circumstances
,
and
that
in
all
*NL*
the
world
he
alone
could
encounter
the
invincible
Napoleon
without
fear
,
*NL*
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
order
he
had
to
issue
.
But
*NL*
something
had
to
be
decided
,
and
these
conversations
around
him
which
*NL*
were
assuming
too
free
a
character
must
be
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
the
most
important
generals
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
,
be
it
good
or
bad
,
must
depend
on
itself
,
''
said
he
,
rising
*NL*
from
the
bench
,
and
he
rode
to
Fili
where
his
carriages
were
waiting
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Council
of
War
began
to
assemble
at
two
in
the
afternoon
in
the
*NL*
better
and
roomier
part
of
Andrew
Savostyanov
's
hut
.
The
men
,
women
,
and
*NL*
children
of
the
large
peasant
family
crowded
into
the
back
room
across
*NL*
the
passage
.
Only
Malasha
,
Andrew
's
six-year-old
granddaughter
whom
his
*NL*
Serene
Highness
had
petted
and
to
whom
he
had
given
a
lump
of
sugar
*NL*
while
drinking
his
tea
,
remained
on
the
top
of
the
brick
oven
in
the
*NL*
larger
room
.
Malasha
looked
down
from
the
oven
with
shy
delight
at
the
*NL*
faces
,
uniforms
,
and
decorations
of
the
generals
,
who
one
after
another
*NL*
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
broad
benches
in
the
corner
under
*NL*
the
icons
.
``
Granddad
''
himself
,
as
Malasha
in
her
own
mind
called
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
sat
apart
in
a
dark
corner
behind
the
oven
.
He
sat
,
sunk
deep
*NL*
in
a
folding
armchair
,
and
continually
cleared
his
throat
and
pulled
at
*NL*
the
collar
of
his
coat
which
,
though
it
was
unbuttoned
,
still
seemed
to
*NL*
pinch
his
neck
.
Those
who
entered
went
up
one
by
one
to
the
field
*NL*
marshal
;
he
pressed
the
hands
of
some
and
nodded
to
others
.
His
adjutant
*NL*
Kaysarov
was
about
to
draw
back
the
curtain
of
the
window
facing
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
but
the
latter
moved
his
hand
angrily
and
Kaysarov
understood
*NL*
that
his
Serene
Highness
did
not
wish
his
face
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Round
the
peasant
's
deal
table
,
on
which
lay
maps
,
plans
,
pencils
,
and
*NL*
papers
,
so
many
people
gathered
that
the
orderlies
brought
in
another
*NL*
bench
and
put
it
beside
the
table
.
Ermolov
,
Kaysarov
,
and
Toll
,
who
had
*NL*
just
arrived
,
sat
down
on
this
bench
.
In
the
foremost
place
,
immediately
*NL*
under
the
icons
,
sat
Barclay
de
Tolly
,
his
high
forehead
merging
into
*NL*
his
bald
crown
.
He
had
a
St.
George
's
Cross
round
his
neck
and
looked
*NL*
pale
and
ill
.
He
had
been
feverish
for
two
days
and
was
now
shivering
*NL*
and
in
pain
.
Beside
him
sat
Uvarov
,
who
with
rapid
gesticulations
was
*NL*
giving
him
some
information
,
speaking
in
low
tones
as
they
all
did
.
*NL*
Chubby
little
Dokhturov
was
listening
attentively
with
eyebrows
raised
*NL*
and
arms
folded
on
his
stomach
.
On
the
other
side
sat
Count
Ostermann
-
*NL*
Tolstoy
,
seemingly
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
.
His
broad
head
with
its
*NL*
bold
features
and
glittering
eyes
was
resting
on
his
hand
.
Raevski
,
*NL*
twitching
forward
the
black
hair
on
his
temples
as
was
his
habit
,
*NL*
glanced
now
at
Kutuzov
and
now
at
the
door
with
a
look
of
impatience
.
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
's
firm
,
handsome
,
and
kindly
face
was
lit
up
by
a
tender
,
*NL*
sly
smile
.
His
glance
met
Malasha
's
,
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
*NL*
caused
the
little
girl
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
waiting
for
Bennigsen
,
who
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
*NL*
the
position
was
finishing
his
savory
dinner
.
They
waited
for
him
from
*NL*
four
till
six
o'clock
and
did
not
begin
their
deliberations
all
that
*NL*
time
but
talked
in
low
tones
of
other
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
Bennigsen
had
entered
the
hut
did
Kutuzov
leave
his
corner
and
*NL*
draw
toward
the
table
,
but
not
near
enough
for
the
candles
that
had
been
*NL*
placed
there
to
light
up
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
question
:
``
Are
we
to
abandon
*NL*
Russia
's
ancient
and
sacred
capital
without
a
struggle
,
or
are
we
to
*NL*
defend
it
?
''
A
prolonged
and
general
silence
followed
.
There
was
a
frown
*NL*
on
every
face
and
only
Kutuzov
's
angry
grunts
and
occasional
cough
broke
*NL*
the
silence
.
All
eyes
were
gazing
at
him
.
Malasha
too
looked
at
*NL*
``
Granddad
.
''
She
was
nearest
to
him
and
saw
how
his
face
puckered
;
he
*NL*
seemed
about
to
cry
,
but
this
did
not
last
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Russia
's
ancient
and
sacred
capital
!
''
he
suddenly
said
,
repeating
*NL*
Bennigsen
's
words
in
an
angry
voice
and
thereby
drawing
attention
to
the
*NL*
false
note
in
them
.
``
Allow
me
to
tell
you
,
your
excellency
,
that
that
*NL*
question
has
no
meaning
for
a
Russian
.
''
-LRB-
He
lurched
his
heavy
body
*NL*
forward
.
-RRB-
``
Such
a
question
can
not
be
put
;
it
is
senseless
!
The
question
*NL*
I
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
meet
to
discuss
is
a
military
one
.
The
*NL*
question
is
that
of
saving
Russia
.
Is
it
better
to
give
up
Moscow
*NL*
without
a
battle
,
or
by
accepting
battle
to
risk
losing
the
army
as
well
*NL*
as
Moscow
?
That
is
the
question
on
which
I
want
your
opinion
,
''
and
he
*NL*
sank
back
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
began
.
Bennigsen
did
not
yet
consider
his
game
lost
.
*NL*
Admitting
the
view
of
Barclay
and
others
that
a
defensive
battle
at
Fili
*NL*
was
impossible
,
but
imbued
with
Russian
patriotism
and
the
love
of
*NL*
Moscow
,
he
proposed
to
move
troops
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
*NL*
during
the
night
and
attack
the
French
right
flank
the
following
day
.
*NL*
Opinions
were
divided
,
and
arguments
were
advanced
for
and
against
that
*NL*
project
.
Ermolov
,
Dokhturov
,
and
Raevski
agreed
with
Bennigsen
.
Whether
*NL*
feeling
it
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
*NL*
or
guided
by
other
,
personal
considerations
,
these
generals
seemed
not
*NL*
to
understand
that
this
council
could
not
alter
the
inevitable
course
of
*NL*
events
and
that
Moscow
was
in
effect
already
abandoned
.
The
other
*NL*
generals
,
however
,
understood
it
and
,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
*NL*
Moscow
,
spoke
of
the
direction
the
army
should
take
in
its
retreat
.
*NL*
Malasha
,
who
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
what
was
going
on
before
her
,
*NL*
understood
the
meaning
of
the
council
differently
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
it
was
only
a
personal
struggle
between
``
Granddad
''
and
``
Long-coat
''
as
*NL*
she
termed
Bennigsen
.
She
saw
that
they
grew
spiteful
when
they
spoke
to
*NL*
one
another
,
and
in
her
heart
she
sided
with
``
Granddad
.
''
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
conversation
she
noticed
``
Granddad
''
give
Bennigsen
a
quick
,
subtle
*NL*
glance
,
and
then
to
her
joys
she
saw
that
``
Granddad
''
said
something
to
*NL*
``
Long-coat
''
which
settled
him
.
Bennigsen
suddenly
reddened
and
paced
*NL*
angrily
up
and
down
the
room
.
What
so
affected
him
was
Kutuzov
's
calm
*NL*
and
quiet
comment
on
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
Bennigsen
's
*NL*
proposal
to
move
troops
by
night
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
to
*NL*
attack
the
French
right
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Kutuzov
,
``
I
can
not
approve
of
the
count
's
plan
.
Moving
*NL*
troops
in
close
proximity
to
an
enemy
is
always
dangerous
,
and
military
*NL*
history
supports
that
view
.
For
instance
...
''
Kutuzov
seemed
to
reflect
,
*NL*
searching
for
an
example
,
then
with
a
clear
,
naive
look
at
Bennigsen
he
*NL*
added
:
``
Oh
yes
;
take
the
battle
of
Friedland
,
which
I
think
the
count
*NL*
well
remembers
,
and
which
was
...
not
fully
successful
,
only
because
our
*NL*
troops
were
rearranged
too
near
the
enemy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
followed
a
momentary
pause
,
which
seemed
very
long
to
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
recommenced
,
but
pauses
frequently
occurred
and
they
all
*NL*
felt
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
one
of
these
pauses
Kutuzov
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
if
preparing
to
*NL*
speak
.
They
all
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
I
see
that
it
is
I
who
will
have
to
pay
for
the
broken
*NL*
crockery
,
''
said
he
,
and
rising
slowly
he
moved
to
the
table
.
``
Gentlemen
,
*NL*
I
have
heard
your
views
.
Some
of
you
will
not
agree
with
me
.
But
I
,
''
he
*NL*
paused
,
``
by
the
authority
entrusted
to
me
by
my
Sovereign
and
country
,
*NL*
order
a
retreat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
the
generals
began
to
disperse
with
the
solemnity
and
*NL*
circumspect
silence
of
people
who
are
leaving
,
after
a
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
generals
,
in
low
tones
and
in
a
strain
very
different
from
*NL*
the
way
they
had
spoken
during
the
council
,
communicated
something
to
*NL*
their
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Malasha
,
who
had
long
been
expected
for
supper
,
climbed
carefully
*NL*
backwards
down
from
the
oven
,
her
bare
little
feet
catching
at
its
*NL*
projections
,
and
slipping
between
the
legs
of
the
generals
she
darted
*NL*
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
dismissed
the
generals
Kutuzov
sat
a
long
time
with
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
table
,
thinking
always
of
the
same
terrible
question
:
*NL*
``
When
,
when
did
the
abandonment
of
Moscow
become
inevitable
?
When
was
*NL*
that
done
which
settled
the
matter
?
And
who
was
to
blame
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
this
,
''
said
he
to
his
adjutant
Schneider
when
the
*NL*
latter
came
in
late
that
night
.
``
I
did
not
expect
this
!
I
did
not
think
*NL*
this
would
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
take
some
rest
,
your
Serene
Highness
,
''
replied
Schneider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
!
They
shall
eat
horseflesh
yet
,
like
the
Turks
!
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Kutuzov
without
replying
,
striking
the
table
with
his
podgy
fist
.
``
They
*NL*
shall
too
,
if
only
...

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
very
time
,
in
circumstances
even
more
important
than
retreating
*NL*
without
a
battle
,
namely
the
evacuation
and
burning
of
Moscow
,
*NL*
Rostopchin
,
who
is
usually
represented
as
being
the
instigator
of
that
*NL*
event
,
acted
in
an
altogether
different
manner
from
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
battle
of
Borodino
the
abandonment
and
burning
of
Moscow
was
*NL*
as
inevitable
as
the
retreat
of
the
army
beyond
Moscow
without
fighting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
Russian
might
have
predicted
it
,
not
by
reasoning
but
by
the
*NL*
feeling
implanted
in
each
of
us
and
in
our
fathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
thing
that
took
place
in
Moscow
had
happened
in
all
the
towns
*NL*
and
villages
on
Russian
soil
beginning
with
Smolensk
,
without
the
*NL*
participation
of
Count
Rostopchin
and
his
broadsheets
.
The
people
*NL*
awaited
the
enemy
unconcernedly
,
did
not
riot
or
become
excited
or
tear
*NL*
anyone
to
pieces
,
but
faced
its
fate
,
feeling
within
it
the
strength
to
*NL*
find
what
it
should
do
at
that
most
difficult
moment
.
And
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
enemy
drew
near
the
wealthy
classes
went
away
abandoning
their
property
,
*NL*
while
the
poorer
remained
and
burned
and
destroyed
what
was
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
consciousness
that
this
would
be
so
and
would
always
be
so
was
and
*NL*
is
present
in
the
heart
of
every
Russian
.
And
a
consciousness
of
this
,
*NL*
and
a
foreboding
that
Moscow
would
be
taken
,
was
present
in
Russian
*NL*
Moscow
society
in
1812
.
Those
who
had
quitted
Moscow
already
in
July
and
*NL*
at
the
beginning
of
August
showed
that
they
expected
this
.
Those
who
*NL*
went
away
,
taking
what
they
could
and
abandoning
their
houses
and
half
*NL*
their
belongings
,
did
so
from
the
latent
patriotism
which
expresses
*NL*
itself
not
by
phrases
or
by
giving
one
's
children
to
save
the
fatherland
*NL*
and
similar
unnatural
exploits
,
but
unobtrusively
,
simply
,
organically
,
*NL*
and
therefore
in
the
way
that
always
produces
the
most
powerful
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
disgraceful
to
run
away
from
danger
;
only
cowards
are
running
*NL*
away
from
Moscow
,
''
they
were
told
.
In
his
broadsheets
Rostopchin
*NL*
impressed
on
them
that
to
leave
Moscow
was
shameful
.
They
were
ashamed
*NL*
to
be
called
cowards
,
ashamed
to
leave
,
but
still
they
left
,
knowing
it
*NL*
had
to
be
done
.
Why
did
they
go
?
It
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
*NL*
Rostopchin
had
scared
them
by
his
accounts
of
horrors
Napoleon
had
*NL*
committed
in
conquered
countries
.
The
first
people
to
go
away
were
the
*NL*
rich
educated
people
who
knew
quite
well
that
Vienna
and
Berlin
had
*NL*
remained
intact
and
that
during
Napoleon
's
occupation
the
inhabitants
*NL*
had
spent
their
time
pleasantly
in
the
company
of
the
charming
Frenchmen
*NL*
whom
the
Russians
,
and
especially
the
Russian
ladies
,
then
liked
so
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
away
because
for
Russians
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
*NL*
whether
things
would
go
well
or
ill
under
French
rule
in
Moscow
.
It
was
*NL*
out
of
the
question
to
be
under
French
rule
,
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
*NL*
that
could
happen
.
They
went
away
even
before
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
*NL*
still
more
rapidly
after
it
,
despite
Rostopchin
's
calls
to
defend
Moscow
*NL*
or
the
announcement
of
his
intention
to
take
the
wonder-working
icon
of
*NL*
the
Iberian
Mother
of
God
and
go
to
fight
,
or
of
the
balloons
that
were
*NL*
to
destroy
the
French
,
and
despite
all
the
nonsense
Rostopchin
wrote
in
*NL*
his
broadsheets
.
They
knew
that
it
was
for
the
army
to
fight
,
and
that
*NL*
if
it
could
not
succeed
it
would
not
do
to
take
young
ladies
and
house
*NL*
serfs
to
the
Three
Hills
quarter
of
Moscow
to
fight
Napoleon
,
and
that
*NL*
they
must
go
away
,
sorry
as
they
were
to
abandon
their
property
to
*NL*
destruction
.
They
went
away
without
thinking
of
the
tremendous
*NL*
significance
of
that
immense
and
wealthy
city
being
given
over
to
*NL*
destruction
,
for
a
great
city
with
wooden
buildings
was
certain
when
*NL*
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
to
be
burned
.
They
went
away
each
on
his
*NL*
own
account
,
and
yet
it
was
only
in
consequence
of
their
going
away
that
*NL*
the
momentous
event
was
accomplished
that
will
always
remain
the
*NL*
greatest
glory
of
the
Russian
people
.
The
lady
who
,
afraid
of
being
*NL*
stopped
by
Count
Rostopchin
's
orders
,
had
already
in
June
moved
with
her
*NL*
Negroes
and
her
women
jesters
from
Moscow
to
her
Saratov
estate
,
with
a
*NL*
vague
consciousness
that
she
was
not
Bonaparte
's
servant
,
was
really
,
*NL*
simply
,
and
truly
carrying
out
the
great
work
which
saved
Russia
.
But
*NL*
Count
Rostopchin
,
who
now
taunted
those
who
left
Moscow
and
now
had
the
*NL*
government
offices
removed
;
now
distributed
quite
useless
weapons
to
the
*NL*
drunken
rabble
;
now
had
processions
displaying
the
icons
,
and
now
*NL*
forbade
Father
Augustin
to
remove
icons
or
the
relics
of
saints
;
now
*NL*
seized
all
the
private
carts
in
Moscow
and
on
one
hundred
and
thirty-six
*NL*
of
them
removed
the
balloon
that
was
being
constructed
by
Leppich
;
now
*NL*
hinted
that
he
would
burn
Moscow
and
related
how
he
had
set
fire
to
his
*NL*
own
house
;
now
wrote
a
proclamation
to
the
French
solemnly
upbraiding
*NL*
them
for
having
destroyed
his
Orphanage
;
now
claimed
the
glory
of
having
*NL*
hinted
that
he
would
burn
Moscow
and
now
repudiated
the
deed
;
now
*NL*
ordered
the
people
to
catch
all
spies
and
bring
them
to
him
,
and
now
*NL*
reproached
them
for
doing
so
;
now
expelled
all
the
French
residents
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
now
allowed
Madame
Aubert-Chalme
-LRB-
the
center
of
the
whole
*NL*
French
colony
in
Moscow
-RRB-
to
remain
,
but
ordered
the
venerable
old
*NL*
postmaster
Klyucharev
to
be
arrested
and
exiled
for
no
particular
*NL*
offense
;
now
assembled
the
people
at
the
Three
Hills
to
fight
the
French
*NL*
and
now
,
to
get
rid
of
them
,
handed
over
to
them
a
man
to
be
killed
and
*NL*
himself
drove
away
by
a
back
gate
;
now
declared
that
he
would
not
*NL*
survive
the
fall
of
Moscow
,
and
now
wrote
French
verses
in
albums
*NL*
concerning
his
share
in
the
affair
--
this
man
did
not
understand
the
*NL*
meaning
of
what
was
happening
but
merely
wanted
to
do
something
himself
*NL*
that
would
astonish
people
,
to
perform
some
patriotically
heroic
feat
;
*NL*
and
like
a
child
he
made
sport
of
the
momentous
,
and
unavoidable
event
--
*NL*
the
abandonment
and
burning
of
Moscow
--
and
tried
with
his
puny
hand
now
*NL*
to
speed
and
now
to
stay
the
enormous
,
popular
tide
that
bore
him
along
*NL*
with
it
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
,
having
returned
with
the
court
from
Vilna
to
Petersburg
,
found
*NL*
herself
in
a
difficult
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Petersburg
she
had
enjoyed
the
special
protection
of
a
grandee
who
*NL*
occupied
one
of
the
highest
posts
in
the
Empire
.
In
Vilna
she
had
formed
*NL*
an
intimacy
with
a
young
foreign
prince
.
When
she
returned
to
Petersburg
*NL*
both
the
magnate
and
the
prince
were
there
,
and
both
claimed
their
*NL*
rights
.
Helene
was
faced
by
a
new
problem
--
how
to
preserve
her
intimacy
*NL*
with
both
without
offending
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
have
seemed
difficult
or
even
impossible
to
another
woman
did
*NL*
not
cause
the
least
embarrassment
to
Countess
Bezukhova
,
who
evidently
*NL*
deserved
her
reputation
of
being
a
very
clever
woman
.
Had
she
attempted
*NL*
concealment
,
or
tried
to
extricate
herself
from
her
awkward
position
by
*NL*
cunning
,
she
would
have
spoiled
her
case
by
acknowledging
herself
*NL*
guilty
.
But
Helene
,
like
a
really
great
man
who
can
do
whatever
he
*NL*
pleases
,
at
once
assumed
her
own
position
to
be
correct
,
as
she
*NL*
sincerely
believed
it
to
be
,
and
that
everyone
else
was
to
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
the
young
foreigner
allowed
himself
to
reproach
her
,
she
*NL*
lifted
her
beautiful
head
and
,
half
turning
to
him
,
said
firmly
:
``
That
's
*NL*
just
like
a
man
--
selfish
and
cruel
!
I
expected
nothing
else
.
A
woman
*NL*
sacrifices
herself
for
you
,
she
suffers
,
and
this
is
her
reward
!
What
*NL*
right
have
you
,
monseigneur
,
to
demand
an
account
of
my
attachments
and
*NL*
friendships
?
He
is
a
man
who
has
been
more
than
a
father
to
me
!
''
The
*NL*
prince
was
about
to
say
something
,
but
Helene
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
may
be
that
he
has
other
sentiments
for
me
*NL*
than
those
of
a
father
,
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
me
to
shut
my
door
*NL*
on
him
.
I
am
not
a
man
,
that
I
should
repay
kindness
with
ingratitude
!
*NL*
Know
,
monseigneur
,
that
in
all
that
relates
to
my
intimate
feelings
I
*NL*
render
account
only
to
God
and
to
my
conscience
,
''
she
concluded
,
laying
*NL*
her
hand
on
her
beautiful
,
fully
expanded
bosom
and
looking
up
to
*NL*
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
heaven
's
sake
listen
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
me
,
and
I
will
be
your
slave
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
deign
to
demean
yourself
by
marrying
me
,
you
...
''
said
Helene
,
*NL*
beginning
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
tried
to
comfort
her
,
but
Helene
,
as
if
quite
distraught
,
*NL*
said
through
her
tears
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
marrying
,
*NL*
that
there
were
precedents
-LRB-
there
were
up
to
that
time
very
few
,
but
she
*NL*
mentioned
Napoleon
and
some
other
exalted
personages
-RRB-
,
that
she
had
*NL*
never
been
her
husband
's
wife
,
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
law
,
religion
...
''
said
the
prince
,
already
yielding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
law
,
religion
...
What
have
they
been
invented
for
if
they
ca
n't
*NL*
arrange
that
?
''
said
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
surprised
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
applied
for
advice
to
the
holy
brethren
of
the
Society
of
Jesus
,
*NL*
with
whom
he
was
on
intimate
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
at
one
of
those
enchanting
fetes
which
Helene
gave
at
*NL*
her
country
house
on
the
Stone
Island
,
the
charming
Monsieur
de
Jobert
,
*NL*
a
man
no
longer
young
,
with
snow
white
hair
and
brilliant
black
eyes
,
a
*NL*
Jesuit
a
robe
courte
*
was
presented
to
her
,
and
in
the
garden
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
illuminations
and
to
the
sound
of
music
talked
to
her
for
a
*NL*
long
time
of
the
love
of
God
,
of
Christ
,
of
the
Sacred
Heart
,
and
of
the
*NL*
consolations
the
one
true
Catholic
religion
affords
in
this
world
and
*NL*
the
next
.
Helene
was
touched
,
and
more
than
once
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
*NL*
and
to
those
of
Monsieur
de
Jobert
and
their
voices
trembled
.
A
dance
,
*NL*
for
which
her
partner
came
to
seek
her
,
put
an
end
to
her
discourse
with
*NL*
her
future
directeur
de
conscience
,
but
the
next
evening
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Jobert
came
to
see
Helene
when
she
was
alone
,
and
after
that
often
came
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Lay
member
of
the
Society
of
Jesus
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
took
the
countess
to
a
Roman
Catholic
church
,
where
she
knelt
*NL*
down
before
the
altar
to
which
she
was
led
.
The
enchanting
,
middle-aged
*NL*
Frenchman
laid
his
hands
on
her
head
and
,
as
she
herself
afterward
*NL*
described
it
,
she
felt
something
like
a
fresh
breeze
wafted
into
her
*NL*
soul
.
It
was
explained
to
her
that
this
was
la
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
a
long-frocked
abbe
was
brought
to
her
.
She
confessed
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
absolved
her
from
her
sins
.
Next
day
she
received
a
box
*NL*
containing
the
Sacred
Host
,
which
was
left
at
her
house
for
her
to
*NL*
partake
of
.
A
few
days
later
Helene
learned
with
pleasure
that
she
had
*NL*
now
been
admitted
to
the
true
Catholic
Church
and
that
in
a
few
days
the
*NL*
Pope
himself
would
hear
of
her
and
would
send
her
a
certain
document
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
was
done
around
her
and
to
her
at
this
time
,
all
the
attention
*NL*
devoted
to
her
by
so
many
clever
men
and
expressed
in
such
pleasant
,
*NL*
refined
ways
,
and
the
state
of
dove-like
purity
she
was
now
in
-LRB-
she
wore
*NL*
only
white
dresses
and
white
ribbons
all
that
time
-RRB-
gave
her
pleasure
,
*NL*
but
her
pleasure
did
not
cause
her
for
a
moment
to
forget
her
aim
.
And
*NL*
as
it
always
happens
in
contests
of
cunning
that
a
stupid
person
gets
*NL*
the
better
of
cleverer
ones
,
Helene
--
having
realized
that
the
main
*NL*
object
of
all
these
words
and
all
this
trouble
was
,
after
converting
her
*NL*
to
Catholicism
,
to
obtain
money
from
her
for
Jesuit
institutions
-LRB-
as
to
*NL*
which
she
received
indications
-RRB-
-
before
parting
with
her
money
insisted
*NL*
that
the
various
operations
necessary
to
free
her
from
her
husband
*NL*
should
be
performed
.
In
her
view
the
aim
of
every
religion
was
merely
to
*NL*
preserve
certain
proprieties
while
affording
satisfaction
to
human
*NL*
desires
.
And
with
this
aim
,
in
one
of
her
talks
with
her
Father
*NL*
Confessor
,
she
insisted
on
an
answer
to
the
question
,
in
how
far
was
she
*NL*
bound
by
her
marriage
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
a
window
in
the
drawing
room
.
The
*NL*
scent
of
flowers
came
in
at
the
window
.
Helene
was
wearing
a
white
*NL*
dress
,
transparent
over
her
shoulders
and
bosom
.
The
abbe
,
a
well-fed
*NL*
man
with
a
plump
,
clean-shaven
chin
,
a
pleasant
firm
mouth
,
and
white
*NL*
hands
meekly
folded
on
his
knees
,
sat
close
to
Helene
and
,
with
a
subtle
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
peaceful
look
of
delight
at
her
beauty
,
*NL*
occasionally
glanced
at
her
face
as
he
explained
his
opinion
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
Helene
with
an
uneasy
smile
looked
at
his
curly
hair
and
his
*NL*
plump
,
clean-shaven
,
blackish
cheeks
and
every
moment
expected
the
*NL*
conversation
to
take
a
fresh
turn
.
But
the
abbe
,
though
he
evidently
*NL*
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
his
companion
,
was
absorbed
in
his
mastery
of
the
*NL*
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
course
of
the
Father
Confessor
's
arguments
ran
as
follows
:
``
Ignorant
*NL*
of
the
import
of
what
you
were
undertaking
,
you
made
a
vow
of
conjugal
*NL*
fidelity
to
a
man
who
on
his
part
,
by
entering
the
married
state
without
*NL*
faith
in
the
religious
significance
of
marriage
,
committed
an
act
of
*NL*
sacrilege
.
That
marriage
lacked
the
dual
significance
it
should
have
*NL*
had
.
Yet
in
spite
of
this
your
vow
was
binding
.
You
swerved
from
it
.
*NL*
What
did
you
commit
by
so
acting
?
A
venial
,
or
a
mortal
,
sin
?
A
venial
*NL*
sin
,
for
you
acted
without
evil
intention
.
If
now
you
married
again
with
*NL*
the
object
of
bearing
children
,
your
sin
might
be
forgiven
.
But
the
*NL*
question
is
again
a
twofold
one
:
firstly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
Helene
,
who
was
getting
bored
,
said
with
one
of
her
*NL*
bewitching
smiles
:
``
But
I
think
that
having
espoused
the
true
religion
I
*NL*
can
not
be
bound
by
what
a
false
religion
laid
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
director
of
her
conscience
was
astounded
at
having
the
case
*NL*
presented
to
him
thus
with
the
simplicity
of
Columbus
'
egg
.
He
was
*NL*
delighted
at
the
unexpected
rapidity
of
his
pupil
's
progress
,
but
could
*NL*
not
abandon
the
edifice
of
argument
he
had
laboriously
constructed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
understand
one
another
,
Countess
,
''
said
he
with
a
smile
,
and
*NL*
began
refuting
his
spiritual
daughter
's
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
understood
that
the
question
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
*NL*
ecclesiastical
point
of
view
,
and
that
her
directors
were
making
*NL*
difficulties
only
because
they
were
apprehensive
as
to
how
the
matter
*NL*
would
be
regarded
by
the
secular
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
the
opinion
of
society
.
*NL*
She
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
elderly
magnate
and
told
him
what
she
*NL*
had
told
her
other
suitor
;
that
is
,
she
put
the
matter
so
that
the
only
*NL*
way
for
him
to
obtain
a
right
over
her
was
to
marry
her
.
The
elderly
*NL*
magnate
was
at
first
as
much
taken
aback
by
this
suggestion
of
marriage
*NL*
with
a
woman
whose
husband
was
alive
,
as
the
younger
man
had
been
,
but
*NL*
Helene
's
imperturbable
conviction
that
it
was
as
simple
and
natural
as
*NL*
marrying
a
maiden
had
its
effect
on
him
too
.
Had
Helene
herself
shown
*NL*
the
least
sign
of
hesitation
,
shame
,
or
secrecy
,
her
cause
would
*NL*
certainly
have
been
lost
;
but
not
only
did
she
show
no
signs
of
secrecy
*NL*
or
shame
,
on
the
contrary
,
with
good-natured
naivete
she
told
her
*NL*
intimate
friends
-LRB-
and
these
were
all
Petersburg
-RRB-
that
both
the
prince
*NL*
and
the
magnate
had
proposed
to
her
and
that
she
loved
both
and
was
*NL*
afraid
of
grieving
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rumor
immediately
spread
in
Petersburg
,
not
that
Helene
wanted
to
be
*NL*
divorced
from
her
husband
-LRB-
had
such
a
report
spread
many
would
have
*NL*
opposed
so
illegal
an
intention
-RRB-
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
and
*NL*
interesting
Helene
was
in
doubt
which
of
the
two
men
she
should
marry
.
*NL*
The
question
was
no
longer
whether
this
was
possible
,
but
only
which
was
*NL*
the
better
match
and
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
at
court
.
There
*NL*
were
,
it
is
true
,
some
rigid
individuals
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
*NL*
such
a
question
,
who
saw
in
the
project
a
desecration
of
the
sacrament
*NL*
of
marriage
,
but
there
were
not
many
such
and
they
remained
silent
,
*NL*
while
the
majority
were
interested
in
Helene
's
good
fortune
and
in
the
*NL*
question
which
match
would
be
the
more
advantageous
.
Whether
it
was
*NL*
right
or
wrong
to
remarry
while
one
had
a
husband
living
they
did
not
*NL*
discuss
,
for
that
question
had
evidently
been
settled
by
people
``
wiser
*NL*
than
you
or
me
,
''
as
they
said
,
and
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
that
*NL*
decision
would
be
to
risk
exposing
one
's
stupidity
and
incapacity
to
*NL*
live
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Marya
Dmitrievna
Akhrosimova
,
who
had
come
to
Petersburg
that
*NL*
summer
to
see
one
of
her
sons
,
allowed
herself
plainly
to
express
an
*NL*
opinion
contrary
to
the
general
one
.
Meeting
Helene
at
a
ball
she
*NL*
stopped
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
,
amid
general
silence
,
said
in
*NL*
her
gruff
voice
:
``
So
wives
of
living
men
have
started
marrying
again
!
*NL*
Perhaps
you
think
you
have
invented
a
novelty
?
You
have
been
*NL*
forestalled
,
my
dear
!
It
was
thought
of
long
ago
.
It
is
done
in
all
the
*NL*
brothels
,
''
and
with
these
words
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
turning
up
her
wide
*NL*
sleeves
with
her
usual
threatening
gesture
and
glancing
sternly
round
,
*NL*
moved
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
people
were
afraid
of
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
was
regarded
in
*NL*
Petersburg
as
a
buffoon
,
and
so
of
what
she
had
said
they
only
noticed
,
*NL*
and
repeated
in
a
whisper
,
the
one
coarse
word
she
had
used
,
supposing
*NL*
the
whole
sting
of
her
remark
to
lie
in
that
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
,
who
of
late
very
often
forgot
what
he
had
said
and
*NL*
repeated
one
and
the
same
thing
a
hundred
times
,
remarked
to
his
*NL*
daughter
whenever
he
chanced
to
see
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Helene
,
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
,
''
and
he
would
lead
her
aside
,
*NL*
drawing
her
hand
downward
.
``
I
have
heard
of
certain
projects
*NL*
concerning
...
you
know
.
Well
my
dear
child
,
you
know
how
your
father
's
*NL*
heart
rejoices
to
know
that
you
...
You
have
suffered
so
much
...
But
,
my
*NL*
dear
child
,
consult
only
your
own
heart
.
That
is
all
I
have
to
say
,
''
and
*NL*
concealing
his
unvarying
emotion
he
would
press
his
cheek
against
his
*NL*
daughter
's
and
move
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
,
who
had
not
lost
his
reputation
of
an
exceedingly
clever
man
,
*NL*
and
who
was
one
of
the
disinterested
friends
so
brilliant
a
woman
as
*NL*
Helene
always
has
--
men
friends
who
can
never
change
into
lovers
--
once
*NL*
gave
her
his
view
of
the
matter
at
a
small
and
intimate
gathering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Bilibin
,
''
said
Helene
-LRB-
she
always
called
friends
of
that
sort
*NL*
by
their
surnames
-RRB-
,
and
she
touched
his
coat
sleeve
with
her
white
,
*NL*
beringed
fingers
.
``
Tell
me
,
as
you
would
a
sister
,
what
I
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
Which
of
the
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
wrinkled
up
the
skin
over
his
eyebrows
and
pondered
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
taking
me
unawares
,
you
know
,
''
said
he
.
``
As
a
true
friend
,
*NL*
I
have
thought
and
thought
again
about
your
affair
.
You
see
,
if
you
*NL*
marry
the
prince
''
--
he
meant
the
younger
man
--
and
he
crooked
one
finger
,
*NL*
``
you
forever
lose
the
chance
of
marrying
the
other
,
and
you
will
*NL*
displease
the
court
besides
.
-LRB-
You
know
there
is
some
kind
of
*NL*
connection
.
-RRB-
But
if
you
marry
the
old
count
you
will
make
his
last
days
*NL*
happy
,
and
as
widow
of
the
Grand
...
the
prince
would
no
longer
be
making
*NL*
a
mesalliance
by
marrying
you
,
''
and
Bilibin
smoothed
out
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
true
friend
!
''
said
Helene
beaming
,
and
again
touching
*NL*
Bilibin
's
sleeve
.
``
But
I
love
them
,
you
know
,
and
do
n't
want
to
distress
*NL*
either
of
them
.
I
would
give
my
life
for
the
happiness
of
them
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
as
much
as
to
say
that
not
even
he
could
*NL*
help
in
that
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Une
maitresse-femme
!
*
That
's
what
is
called
putting
things
squarely
.
*NL*
She
would
like
to
be
married
to
all
three
at
the
same
time
,
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
masterly
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
how
will
your
husband
look
at
the
matter
?
''
Bilibin
asked
,
*NL*
his
reputation
being
so
well
established
that
he
did
not
fear
to
ask
so
*NL*
naive
a
question
.
``
Will
he
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
loves
me
so
!
''
said
Helene
,
who
for
some
reason
imagined
that
*NL*
Pierre
too
loved
her
.
``
He
will
do
anything
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
puckered
his
skin
in
preparation
for
something
witty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
divorce
you
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helene
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
those
who
ventured
to
doubt
the
justifiability
of
the
proposed
*NL*
marriage
was
Helene
's
mother
,
Princess
Kuragina
.
She
was
continually
*NL*
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
daughter
,
and
now
that
jealousy
concerned
a
*NL*
subject
near
to
her
own
heart
,
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
*NL*
idea
.
She
consulted
a
Russian
priest
as
to
the
possibility
of
divorce
*NL*
and
remarriage
during
a
husband
's
lifetime
,
and
the
priest
told
her
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
,
and
to
her
delight
showed
her
a
text
in
the
Gospel
*NL*
which
-LRB-
as
it
seemed
to
him
-RRB-
plainly
forbids
remarriage
while
the
husband
*NL*
is
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Armed
with
these
arguments
,
which
appeared
to
her
unanswerable
,
she
*NL*
drove
to
her
daughter
's
early
one
morning
so
as
to
find
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
listened
to
her
mother
's
objections
,
Helene
smiled
blandly
and
*NL*
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
says
plainly
:
`
Whosoever
shall
marry
her
that
is
divorced
...
'
''
*NL*
said
the
old
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Maman
,
ne
dites
pas
de
betises
.
Vous
ne
comprenez
rien
.
Dans
ma
*NL*
position
j'
ai
des
devoirs
,
''
*
said
Helene
changing
from
Russian
,
in
*NL*
which
language
she
always
felt
that
her
case
did
not
sound
quite
clear
,
*NL*
into
French
which
suited
it
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Oh
,
Mamma
,
do
n't
talk
nonsense
!
You
do
n't
understand
anything
.
In
my
*NL*
position
I
have
obligations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mamma
,
how
is
it
you
do
n't
understand
that
the
Holy
Father
,
who
has
*NL*
the
right
to
grant
dispensations
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
lady
companion
who
lived
with
Helene
came
in
to
announce
*NL*
that
His
Highness
was
in
the
ballroom
and
wished
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Non
,
dites-lui
que
je
ne
veux
pas
le
voir
,
que
je
suis
furieuse
contre

parce
qu'il

a

*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
No

him
I
do
n't
wish

see
him
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comtesse
,
a
tout

''
*
said
a
fair-haired
young
man
*NL*
with
a
long
face
and
nose
,
as
he
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Countess
,
there
is
mercy
for
every
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
princess
rose
respectfully
and
curtsied
.
The
young
man
who
had
*NL*
entered
took
no
notice
of
her
.
The
princess
nodded
to
her
daughter
and
*NL*
sidled
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
right
,
''
thought
the
old
princess
,
all
her
convictions
*NL*
dissipated
by
the
appearance
of
His
Highness
.
``
She
is
right
,
but
how
is
*NL*
it
that
we
in
our
irrecoverable
youth
did
not
know
it
?
Yet
it
is
so
*NL*
simple
,
''
she
thought
as
she
got
into
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
beginning
of
August
Helene
's
affairs
were
clearly
defined
and
she
*NL*
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband
--
who
,
as
she
imagined
,
loved
her
very
*NL*
much
--
informing
him
of
her
intention
to
marry
N.N.
and
of
her
having
*NL*
embraced
the
one
true
faith
,
and
asking
him
to
carry
out
all
the
*NL*
formalities
necessary
for
a
divorce
,
which
would
be
explained
to
him
by
*NL*
the
bearer
of
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
pray
God
to
have
you
,
my
friend
,
in
His
holy
and
powerful
*NL*
keeping
--
Your
friend
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
was
brought
to
Pierre
's
house
when
he
was
on
the
field
of
*NL*
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
the
end
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
Pierre
,
having
run
down
from
*NL*
Raevski
's
battery
a
second
time
,
made
his
way
through
a
gully
to
*NL*
Knyazkovo
with
a
crowd
of
soldiers
,
reached
the
dressing
station
,
and
*NL*
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
groans
hurried
on
,
still
entangled
in
*NL*
the
crowds
of
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
thing
he
now
desired
with
his
whole
soul
was
to
get
away
quickly
*NL*
from
the
terrible
sensations
amid
which
he
had
lived
that
day
and
return
*NL*
to
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
sleep
quietly
in
a
room
in
his
own
*NL*
bed
.
He
felt
that
only
in
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
would
he
be
*NL*
able
to
understand
himself
and
all
he
had
seen
and
felt
.
But
such
*NL*
ordinary
conditions
of
life
were
nowhere
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
shells
and
bullets
did
not
whistle
over
the
road
along
which
he
*NL*
was
going
,
still
on
all
sides
there
was
what
there
had
been
on
the
field
*NL*
of
battle
.
There
were
still
the
same
suffering
,
exhausted
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
strangely
indifferent
faces
,
the
same
blood
,
the
same
soldiers
'
*NL*
overcoats
,
the
same
sounds
of
firing
which
,
though
distant
now
,
still
*NL*
aroused
terror
,
and
besides
this
there
were
the
foul
air
and
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
gone
a
couple
of
miles
along
the
Mozhaysk
road
,
Pierre
sat
down
*NL*
by
the
roadside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dusk
had
fallen
,
and
the
roar
of
guns
died
away
.
Pierre
lay
leaning
on
*NL*
his
elbow
for
a
long
time
,
gazing
at
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
in
*NL*
the
darkness
.
He
was
continually
imagining
that
a
cannon
ball
was
flying
*NL*
toward
him
with
a
terrific
whizz
,
and
then
he
shuddered
and
sat
up
.
He
*NL*
had
no
idea
how
long
he
had
been
there
.
In
the
middle
of
the
night
three
*NL*
soldiers
,
having
brought
some
firewood
,
settled
down
near
him
and
began
*NL*
lighting
a
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
,
who
threw
sidelong
glances
at
Pierre
,
got
the
fire
to
burn
*NL*
and
placed
an
iron
pot
on
it
into
which
they
broke
some
dried
bread
and
*NL*
put
a
little
dripping
.
The
pleasant
odor
of
greasy
viands
mingled
with
*NL*
the
smell
of
smoke
.
Pierre
sat
up
and
sighed
.
The
three
soldiers
were
*NL*
eating
and
talking
among
themselves
,
taking
no
notice
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
may
you
be
?
''
one
of
them
suddenly
asked
Pierre
,
evidently
*NL*
meaning
what
Pierre
himself
had
in
mind
,
namely
:
``
If
you
want
to
eat
*NL*
we
'll
give
you
some
food
,
only
let
us
know
whether
you
are
an
honest
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
I.
.
.
''
said
Pierre
,
feeling
it
necessary
to
minimize
his
social
*NL*
position
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
be
nearer
to
the
soldiers
and
*NL*
better
understood
by
them
.
``
By
rights
I
am
a
militia
officer
,
but
my
men
*NL*
are
not
here
.
I
came
to
the
battle
and
have
lost
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
said
one
of
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
a
little
mash
?
''
the
first
soldier
asked
,
and
handed
*NL*
Pierre
a
wooden
spoon
after
licking
it
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
began
eating
the
mash
,
as
they
called
*NL*
the
food
in
the
cauldron
,
and
he
thought
it
more
delicious
than
any
food
*NL*
he
had
ever
tasted
.
As
he
sat
bending
greedily
over
it
,
helping
himself
*NL*
to
large
spoonfuls
and
chewing
one
after
another
,
his
face
was
lit
up
by
*NL*
the
fire
and
the
soldiers
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
to
go
to
?
Tell
us
!
''
said
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Mozhaysk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
gentleman
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Kirilych
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
Peter
Kirilych
,
come
along
with
us
,
we
'll
take
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
total
darkness
the
soldiers
walked
with
Pierre
to
Mozhaysk
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
they
got
near
Mozhaysk
and
began
ascending
the
steep
hill
*NL*
into
the
town
,
the
cocks
were
already
crowing
.
Pierre
went
on
with
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
quite
forgetting
that
his
inn
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
*NL*
and
that
he
had
already
passed
it
.
He
would
not
soon
have
remembered
*NL*
this
,
such
was
his
state
of
forgetfulness
,
had
he
not
halfway
up
the
*NL*
hill
stumbled
upon
his
groom
,
who
had
been
to
look
for
him
in
the
town
*NL*
and
was
returning
to
the
inn
.
The
groom
recognized
Pierre
in
the
*NL*
darkness
by
his
white
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
!
''
he
said
.
``
Why
,
we
were
beginning
to
despair
!
How
is
*NL*
it
you
are
on
foot
?
And
where
are
you
going
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
found
your
folk
?
''
said
one
of
them
.
``
Well
,
good-by
,
Peter
*NL*
Kirilych
--
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Peter
Kirilych
!
''
Pierre
heard
the
other
voices
repeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
he
said
and
turned
with
his
groom
toward
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
give
them
something
!
''
he
thought
,
and
felt
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
``
No
,
better
not
!
''
said
another
,
inner
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
a
room
to
be
had
at
the
inn
,
they
were
all
occupied
.
*NL*
Pierre
went
out
into
the
yard
and
,
covering
himself
up
head
and
all
,
lay
*NL*
down
in
his
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
Pierre
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
before
he
felt
himself
*NL*
falling
asleep
,
but
suddenly
,
almost
with
the
distinctness
of
reality
,
*NL*
he
heard
the
boom
,
boom
,
boom
of
firing
,
the
thud
of
projectiles
,
groans
*NL*
and
cries
,
and
smelled
blood
and
powder
,
and
a
feeling
of
horror
and
*NL*
dread
of
death
seized
him
.
Filled
with
fright
he
opened
his
eyes
and
*NL*
lifted
his
head
from
under
his
cloak
.
All
was
tranquil
in
the
yard
.
Only
*NL*
someone
's
orderly
passed
through
the
gateway
,
splashing
through
the
mud
,
*NL*
and
talked
to
the
innkeeper
.
Above
Pierre
's
head
some
pigeons
,
disturbed
*NL*
by
the
movement
he
had
made
in
sitting
up
,
fluttered
under
the
dark
roof
*NL*
of
the
penthouse
.
The
whole
courtyard
was
permeated
by
a
strong
peaceful
*NL*
smell
of
stable
yards
,
delightful
to
Pierre
at
that
moment
.
He
could
see
*NL*
the
clear
starry
sky
between
the
dark
roofs
of
two
penthouses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
there
is
no
more
of
that
!
''
he
thought
,
covering
up
his
head
*NL*
again
.
``
Oh
,
what
a
terrible
thing
is
fear
,
and
how
shamefully
I
yielded
*NL*
to
it
!
But
they
...
they
were
steady
and
calm
all
the
time
,
to
the
*NL*
end
...
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
,
in
Pierre
's
mind
,
were
the
soldiers
,
those
who
had
been
at
the
*NL*
battery
,
those
who
had
given
him
food
,
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
*NL*
the
icon
.
They
,
those
strange
men
he
had
not
previously
known
,
stood
out
*NL*
clearly
and
sharply
from
everyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
a
soldier
,
just
a
soldier
!
''
thought
Pierre
as
he
fell
asleep
,
``
to
*NL*
enter
communal
life
completely
,
to
be
imbued
by
what
makes
them
what
*NL*
they
are
.
But
how
cast
off
all
the
superfluous
,
devilish
burden
of
my
*NL*
outer
man
?
There
was
a
time
when
I
could
have
done
it
.
I
could
have
run
*NL*
away
from
my
father
,
as
I
wanted
to
.
Or
I
might
have
been
sent
to
serve
*NL*
as
a
soldier
after
the
duel
with
Dolokhov
.
''
And
the
memory
of
the
dinner
*NL*
at
the
English
Club
when
he
had
challenged
Dolokhov
flashed
through
*NL*
Pierre
's
mind
,
and
then
he
remembered
his
benefactor
at
Torzhok
.
And
now
*NL*
a
picture
of
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
presented
itself
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
It
was
taking
place
at
the
English
Club
and
someone
near
and
dear
to
him
*NL*
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
.
``
Yes
,
that
is
he
!
It
is
my
benefactor
.
But
*NL*
he
died
!
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
Yes
,
he
died
,
and
I
did
not
know
he
was
*NL*
alive
.
How
sorry
I
am
that
he
died
,
and
how
glad
I
am
that
he
is
alive
*NL*
again
!
''
On
one
side
of
the
table
sat
Anatole
,
Dolokhov
,
Nesvitski
,
*NL*
Denisov
,
and
others
like
them
-LRB-
in
his
dream
the
category
to
which
these
*NL*
men
belonged
was
as
clearly
defined
in
his
mind
as
the
category
of
those
*NL*
he
termed
they
-RRB-
,
and
he
heard
those
people
,
Anatole
and
Dolokhov
,
*NL*
shouting
and
singing
loudly
;
yet
through
their
shouting
the
voice
of
his
*NL*
benefactor
was
heard
speaking
all
the
time
and
the
sound
of
his
words
*NL*
was
as
weighty
and
uninterrupted
as
the
booming
on
the
battlefield
,
but
*NL*
pleasant
and
comforting
.
Pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
*NL*
was
saying
,
but
he
knew
-LRB-
the
categories
of
thoughts
were
also
quite
*NL*
distinct
in
his
dream
-RRB-
that
he
was
talking
of
goodness
and
the
*NL*
possibility
of
being
what
they
were
.
And
they
with
their
simple
,
kind
,
*NL*
firm
faces
surrounded
his
benefactor
on
all
sides
.
But
though
they
were
*NL*
kindly
they
did
not
look
at
Pierre
and
did
not
know
him
.
Wishing
to
*NL*
speak
and
to
attract
their
attention
,
he
got
up
,
but
at
that
moment
his
*NL*
legs
grew
cold
and
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
ashamed
,
and
with
one
arm
covered
his
legs
from
which
his
cloak
*NL*
had
in
fact
slipped
.
For
a
moment
as
he
was
rearranging
his
cloak
Pierre
*NL*
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
penthouse
roofs
,
posts
,
and
yard
,
but
*NL*
now
they
were
all
bluish
,
lit
up
,
and
glittering
with
frost
or
dew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
dawn
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
But
that
's
not
what
I
want
.
I
want
to
*NL*
hear
and
understand
my
benefactor
's
words
.
''
Again
he
covered
himself
up
*NL*
with
his
cloak
,
but
now
neither
the
lodge
nor
his
benefactor
was
there
.
*NL*
There
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
in
words
,
thoughts
that
*NL*
someone
was
uttering
or
that
he
himself
was
formulating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
when
he
recalled
those
thoughts
Pierre
was
convinced
that
*NL*
someone
outside
himself
had
spoken
them
,
though
the
impressions
of
that
*NL*
day
had
evoked
them
.
He
had
never
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
been
able
to
think
*NL*
and
express
his
thoughts
like
that
when
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
endure
war
is
the
most
difficult
subordination
of
man
's
freedom
to
*NL*
the
law
of
God
,
''
the
voice
had
said
.
``
Simplicity
is
submission
to
the
*NL*
will
of
God
;
you
can
not
escape
from
Him
.
And
they
are
simple
.
They
do
*NL*
not
talk
,
but
act
.
The
spoken
word
is
silver
but
the
unspoken
is
golden
.
*NL*
Man
can
be
master
of
nothing
while
he
fears
death
,
but
he
who
does
not
*NL*
fear
it
possesses
all
.
If
there
were
no
suffering
,
man
would
not
know
*NL*
his
limitations
,
would
not
know
himself
.
The
hardest
thing
-LRB-
Pierre
went
*NL*
on
thinking
,
or
hearing
,
in
his
dream
-RRB-
is
to
be
able
in
your
soul
to
*NL*
unite
the
meaning
of
all
.
To
unite
all
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
``
No
,
not
to
*NL*
unite
.
Thoughts
can
not
be
united
,
but
to
harness
all
these
thoughts
*NL*
together
is
what
we
need
!
Yes
,
one
must
harness
them
,
must
harness
*NL*
them
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
with
inward
rapture
,
feeling
that
these
*NL*
words
and
they
alone
expressed
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
solved
the
*NL*
question
that
tormented
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
one
must
harness
,
it
is
time
to
harness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
to
harness
,
time
to
harness
,
your
excellency
!
Your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
some
voice
was
repeating
.
``
We
must
harness
,
it
is
time
to
harness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
voice
of
the
groom
,
trying
to
wake
him
.
The
sun
shone
*NL*
straight
into
Pierre
's
face
.
He
glanced
at
the
dirty
innyard
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
which
soldiers
were
watering
their
lean
horses
at
the
pump
*NL*
while
carts
were
passing
out
of
the
gate
.
Pierre
turned
away
with
*NL*
repugnance
,
and
closing
his
eyes
quickly
fell
back
on
the
carriage
seat
.
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
want
that
,
I
do
n't
want
to
see
and
understand
that
.
I
want
*NL*
to
understand
what
was
revealing
itself
to
me
in
my
dream
.
One
second
*NL*
more
and
I
should
have
understood
it
all
!
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
Harness
,
*NL*
but
how
can
I
harness
everything
?
''
and
Pierre
felt
with
horror
that
the
*NL*
meaning
of
all
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
the
dream
had
been
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
groom
,
the
coachman
,
and
the
innkeeper
told
Pierre
that
an
officer
*NL*
had
come
with
news
that
the
French
were
already
near
Mozhaysk
and
that
*NL*
our
men
were
leaving
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
got
up
and
,
having
told
them
to
harness
and
overtake
him
,
went
on
*NL*
foot
through
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troops
were
moving
on
,
leaving
about
ten
thousand
wounded
behind
*NL*
them
.
There
were
wounded
in
the
yards
,
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
,
and
*NL*
the
streets
were
crowded
with
them
.
In
the
streets
,
around
carts
that
*NL*
were
to
take
some
of
the
wounded
away
,
shouts
,
curses
,
and
blows
could
*NL*
be
heard
.
Pierre
offered
the
use
of
his
carriage
,
which
had
overtaken
*NL*
him
,
to
a
wounded
general
he
knew
,
and
drove
with
him
to
Moscow
.
On
the
*NL*
way
Pierre
was
told
of
the
death
of
his
brother-in-law
Anatole
and
of
*NL*
that
of
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
thirteenth
of
August
Pierre
reached
Moscow
.
Close
to
the
gates
of
*NL*
the
city
he
was
met
by
Count
Rostopchin
's
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
``
The
count
*NL*
wants
to
see
you
particularly
.
He
asks
you
to
come
to
him
at
once
on
a
*NL*
very
important
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
going
home
,
Pierre
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
see
the
Moscow
*NL*
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostopchin
had
only
that
morning
returned
to
town
from
his
summer
*NL*
villa
at
Sokolniki
.
The
anteroom
and
reception
room
of
his
house
were
*NL*
full
of
officials
who
had
been
summoned
or
had
come
for
orders
.
*NL*
Vasilchikov
and
Platov
had
already
seen
the
count
and
explained
to
him
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
defend
Moscow
and
that
it
would
have
to
be
*NL*
surrendered
.
Though
this
news
was
being
concealed
from
the
inhabitants
,
*NL*
the
officials
--
the
heads
of
the
various
government
departments
--
knew
*NL*
that
Moscow
would
soon
be
in
the
enemy
's
hands
,
just
as
Count
Rostopchin
*NL*
himself
knew
it
,
and
to
escape
personal
responsibility
they
had
all
come
*NL*
to
the
governor
to
ask
how
they
were
to
deal
with
their
various
*NL*
departments
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Pierre
was
entering
the
reception
room
a
courier
from
the
army
came
*NL*
out
of
Rostopchin
's
private
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
answer
to
questions
with
which
he
was
greeted
,
the
courier
made
a
*NL*
despairing
gesture
with
his
hand
and
passed
through
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
waiting
in
the
reception
room
Pierre
with
weary
eyes
watched
the
*NL*
various
officials
,
old
and
young
,
military
and
civilian
,
who
were
there
.
*NL*
They
all
seemed
dissatisfied
and
uneasy
.
Pierre
went
up
to
a
group
of
*NL*
men
,
one
of
whom
he
knew
.
After
greeting
Pierre
they
continued
their
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
're
sent
out
and
brought
back
again
later
on
it
will
do
no
harm
,
*NL*
but
as
things
are
now
one
ca
n't
answer
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
see
what
he
writes
...
''
said
another
,
pointing
to
a
printed
*NL*
sheet
he
held
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
another
matter
.
That
's
necessary
for
the
people
,
''
said
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
fresh
broadsheet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
it
and
began
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Serene
Highness
has
passed
through
Mozhaysk
in
order
to
join
up
with
*NL*
the
troops
moving
toward
him
and
has
taken
up
a
strong
position
where
*NL*
the
enemy
will
not
soon
attack
him
.
Forty
eight
guns
with
ammunition
*NL*
have
been
sent
him
from
here
,
and
his
Serene
Highness
says
he
will
*NL*
defend
Moscow
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
and
is
even
ready
to
fight
in
*NL*
the
streets
.
Do
not
be
upset
,
brothers
,
that
the
law
courts
are
closed
;
*NL*
things
have
to
be
put
in
order
,
and
we
will
deal
with
villains
in
our
*NL*
own
way
!
When
the
time
comes
I
shall
want
both
town
and
peasant
lads
and
*NL*
will
raise
the
cry
a
day
or
two
beforehand
,
but
they
are
not
wanted
yet
*NL*
so
I
hold
my
peace
.
An
ax
will
be
useful
,
a
hunting
spear
not
bad
,
but
a
*NL*
three-pronged
fork
will
be
best
of
all
:
a
Frenchman
is
no
heavier
than
a
*NL*
sheaf
of
rye
.
Tomorrow
after
dinner
I
shall
take
the
Iberian
icon
of
the
*NL*
Mother
of
God
to
the
wounded
in
the
Catherine
Hospital
where
we
will
*NL*
have
some
water
blessed
.
That
will
help
them
to
get
well
quicker
.
I
,
*NL*
too
,
am
well
now
:
one
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
I
am
on
the
lookout
*NL*
with
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
military
men
have
told
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
fight
in
the
*NL*
town
,
''
said
Pierre
,
``
and
that
the
position
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
!
That
's
what
we
were
saying
,
''
replied
the
first
*NL*
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
he
mean
by
`
One
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
I
am
on
the
*NL*
lookout
with
both
'
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
had
a
sty
,
''
replied
the
adjutant
smiling
,
``
and
was
very
much
*NL*
upset
when
I
told
him
people
had
come
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
*NL*
him
.
By
the
by
,
Count
,
''
he
added
suddenly
,
addressing
Pierre
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
``
we
heard
that
you
have
family
troubles
and
that
the
countess
,
*NL*
your
wife
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
nothing
,
''
Pierre
replied
unconcernedly
.
``
But
what
have
you
*NL*
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
you
know
people
often
invent
things
.
I
only
say
what
I
*NL*
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
say
,
''
continued
the
adjutant
with
the
same
smile
,
``
that
the
*NL*
countess
,
your
wife
,
is
preparing
to
go
abroad
.
I
expect
it
's
*NL*
nonsense
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
''
remarked
Pierre
,
looking
about
him
absent-mindedly
.
``
And
who
*NL*
is
that
?
''
he
asked
,
indicating
a
short
old
man
in
a
clean
blue
peasant
*NL*
overcoat
,
with
a
big
snow-white
beard
and
eyebrows
and
a
ruddy
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
That
's
a
tradesman
,
that
is
to
say
,
he
's
the
restaurant
keeper
,
*NL*
Vereshchagin
.
Perhaps
you
have
heard
of
that
affair
with
the
*NL*
proclamation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
that
is
Vereshchagin
!
''
said
Pierre
,
looking
at
the
firm
,
calm
*NL*
face
of
the
old
man
and
seeking
any
indication
of
his
being
a
traitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
he
himself
,
that
's
the
father
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
*NL*
proclamation
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
``
The
young
man
is
in
prison
and
I
*NL*
expect
it
will
go
hard
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
gentleman
wearing
a
star
and
another
official
,
a
German
wearing
a
*NL*
cross
round
his
neck
,
approached
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
complicated
story
,
you
know
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
``
That
*NL*
proclamation
appeared
about
two
months
ago
.
The
count
was
informed
of
*NL*
it
.
He
gave
orders
to
investigate
the
matter
.
Gabriel
Ivanovich
here
*NL*
made
the
inquiries
.
The
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
sixty
-
*NL*
three
hands
.
He
asked
one
,
`
From
whom
did
you
get
it
?
'
`
From
so-and-so
.
'
*NL*
He
went
to
the
next
one
.
`
From
whom
did
you
get
it
?
'
and
so
on
till
he
*NL*
reached
Vereshchagin
,
a
half
educated
tradesman
,
you
know
,
'
a
pet
of
a
*NL*
trader
,
'
''
said
the
adjutant
smiling
.
``
They
asked
him
,
`
Who
gave
it
you
?
'
*NL*
And
the
point
is
that
we
knew
whom
he
had
it
from
.
He
could
only
have
*NL*
had
it
from
the
Postmaster
.
But
evidently
they
had
come
to
some
*NL*
understanding
.
He
replied
:
`
From
no
one
;
I
made
it
up
myself
.
'
They
*NL*
threatened
and
questioned
him
,
but
he
stuck
to
that
:
'
I
made
it
up
*NL*
myself
.
'
And
so
it
was
reported
to
the
count
,
who
sent
for
the
man
.
*NL*
`
From
whom
did
you
get
the
proclamation
?
'
'
I
wrote
it
myself
.
'
Well
,
you
*NL*
know
the
count
,
''
said
the
adjutant
cheerfully
,
with
a
smile
of
pride
,
*NL*
``
he
flared
up
dreadfully
--
and
just
think
of
the
fellow
's
audacity
,
*NL*
lying
,
and
obstinacy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
count
wanted
him
to
say
it
was
from
Klyucharev
?
I
understand
!
''
*NL*
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
rejoined
the
adjutant
in
dismay
.
``
Klyucharev
had
his
own
*NL*
sins
to
answer
for
without
that
and
that
is
why
he
has
been
banished
.
*NL*
But
the
point
is
that
the
count
was
much
annoyed
.
`
How
could
you
have
*NL*
written
it
yourself
?
'
said
he
,
and
he
took
up
the
Hamburg
Gazette
that
*NL*
was
lying
on
the
table
.
`
Here
it
is
!
You
did
not
write
it
yourself
but
*NL*
translated
it
,
and
translated
it
abominably
,
because
you
do
n't
even
know
*NL*
French
,
you
fool
.
'
And
what
do
you
think
?
`
No
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
have
not
*NL*
read
any
papers
,
I
made
it
up
myself
.
'
`
If
that
's
so
,
you
're
a
traitor
*NL*
and
I
'll
have
you
tried
,
and
you
'll
be
hanged
!
Say
from
whom
you
had
*NL*
it

'
I
have
seen
no
papers
,
I
made
it
up
myself
.
'
And
that
was
the
end
*NL*
of
it
.
The
count
had
the
father
fetched
,
but
the
fellow
stuck
to
it
.
He
*NL*
was
sent
for
trial
and
condemned
to
hard
labor
,
I
believe
.
Now
the
*NL*
father
has
come
to
intercede
for
him
.
But
he
's
a
good-for-nothing
lad
!
*NL*
You
know
that
sort
of
tradesman
's
son
,
a
dandy
and
lady-killer
.
He
*NL*
attended
some
lectures
somewhere
and
imagines
that
the
devil
is
no
match
*NL*
for
him
.
That
's
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is
.
His
father
keeps
a
cookshop
*NL*
here
by
the
Stone
Bridge
,
and
you
know
there
was
a
large
icon
of
God
*NL*
Almighty
painted
with
a
scepter
in
one
hand
and
an
orb
in
the
other
.
*NL*
Well
,
he
took
that
icon
home
with
him
for
a
few
days
and
what
did
he
do
?
*NL*
He
found
some
scoundrel
of
a
painter

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
fresh
tale
Pierre
was
summoned
to
the
commander
in
*NL*
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
the
private
room
Count
Rostopchin
,
puckering
his
face
,
*NL*
was
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyes
with
his
hand
.
A
short
man
was
saying
*NL*
something
,
but
when
Pierre
entered
he
stopped
speaking
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
do
you
do
,
great
warrior
?
''
said
Rostopchin
as
soon
as
the
short
*NL*
man
had
left
the
room
.
``
We
have
heard
of
your
prowess
.
But
that
's
not
*NL*
the
point
.
Between
ourselves
,
mon
cher
,
do
you
belong
to
the
Masons
?
''
he
*NL*
went
on
severely
,
as
though
there
were
something
wrong
about
it
which
he
*NL*
nevertheless
intended
to
pardon
.
Pierre
remained
silent
.
``
I
am
well
*NL*
informed
,
my
friend
,
but
I
am
aware
that
there
are
Masons
and
I
hope
*NL*
that
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
on
pretense
of
saving
mankind
wish
to
*NL*
ruin
Russia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
a
Mason
,
''
Pierre
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
mon
cher
!
I
expect
you
know
that
Messrs.
Speranski
and
*NL*
Magnitski
have
been
deported
to
their
proper
place
.
Mr.
Klyucharev
has
*NL*
been
treated
in
the
same
way
,
and
so
have
others
who
on
the
plea
of
*NL*
building
up
the
temple
of
Solomon
have
tried
to
destroy
the
temple
of
*NL*
their
fatherland
.
You
can
understand
that
there
are
reasons
for
this
and
*NL*
that
I
could
not
have
exiled
the
Postmaster
had
he
not
been
a
harmful
*NL*
person
.
It
has
now
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
lent
him
your
carriage
*NL*
for
his
removal
from
town
,
and
that
you
have
even
accepted
papers
from
*NL*
him
for
safe
custody
.
I
like
you
and
do
n't
wish
you
any
harm
and
--
as
you
*NL*
are
only
half
my
age
--
I
advise
you
,
as
a
father
would
,
to
cease
all
*NL*
communication
with
men
of
that
stamp
and
to
leave
here
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
Klyucharev
do
wrong
,
Count
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
for
me
to
know
,
but
not
for
you
to
ask
,
''
shouted
Rostopchin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
accused
of
circulating
Napoleon
's
proclamation
it
is
not
*NL*
proved
that
he
did
so
,
''
said
Pierre
without
looking
at
Rostopchin
,
``
and
*NL*
Vereshchagin
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
are
!
''
Rostopchin
shouted
at
Pierre
louder
than
before
,
*NL*
frowning
suddenly
.
``
Vereshchagin
is
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
who
will
be
*NL*
punished
as
he
deserves
,
''
said
he
with
the
vindictive
heat
with
which
*NL*
people
speak
when
recalling
an
insult
.
``
But
I
did
not
summon
you
to
*NL*
discuss
my
actions
,
but
to
give
you
advice
--
or
an
order
if
you
prefer
*NL*
it
.
I
beg
you
to
leave
the
town
and
break
off
all
communication
with
*NL*
such
men
as
Klyucharev
.
And
I
will
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
anybody
''
--
*NL*
but
probably
realizing
that
he
was
shouting
at
Bezukhov
who
so
far
was
*NL*
not
guilty
of
anything
,
he
added
,
taking
Pierre
's
hand
in
a
friendly
*NL*
manner
,
``
We
are
on
the
eve
of
a
public
disaster
and
I
have
n't
time
to
be
*NL*
polite
to
everybody
who
has
business
with
me
.
My
head
is
sometimes
in
a
*NL*
whirl
.
Well
,
mon
cher
,
what
are
you
doing
personally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nothing
,
''
answered
Pierre
without
raising
his
eyes
or
changing
the
*NL*
thoughtful
expression
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
word
of
friendly
advice
,
mon
cher
.
Be
off
as
soon
as
you
can
,
that
's
*NL*
all
I
have
to
tell
you
.
Happy
he
who
has
ears
to
hear
.
Good-bye
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
.
Oh
,
by
the
by
!
''
he
shouted
through
the
doorway
after
Pierre
,
``
is
*NL*
it
true
that
the
countess
has
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
holy
*NL*
fathers
of
the
Society
of
Jesus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
answer
and
left
Rostopchin
's
room
more
sullen
and
angry
*NL*
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
home
it
was
already
getting
dark
.
Some
eight
people
had
*NL*
come
to
see
him
that
evening
:
the
secretary
of
a
committee
,
the
colonel
*NL*
of
his
battalion
,
his
steward
,
his
major-domo
,
and
various
petitioners
.
*NL*
They
all
had
business
with
Pierre
and
wanted
decisions
from
him
.
Pierre
*NL*
did
not
understand
and
was
not
interested
in
any
of
these
questions
and
*NL*
only
answered
them
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
people
.
When
left
alone
*NL*
at
last
he
opened
and
read
his
wife
's
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
,
the
soldiers
at
the
battery
,
Prince
Andrew
killed
...
that
old
*NL*
man
...
Simplicity
is
submission
to
God
.
Suffering
is
necessary
...
the
*NL*
meaning
of
all
...
one
must
harness
...
my
wife
is
getting
married
...
One
*NL*
must
forget
and
understand
...
''
And
going
to
his
bed
he
threw
himself
on
*NL*
it
without
undressing
and
immediately
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
awoke
next
morning
the
major-domo
came
to
inform
him
that
a
*NL*
special
messenger
,
a
police
officer
,
had
come
from
Count
Rostopchin
to
*NL*
know
whether
Count
Bezukhov
had
left
or
was
leaving
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dozen
persons
who
had
business
with
Pierre
were
awaiting
him
in
the
*NL*
drawing
room
.
Pierre
dressed
hurriedly
and
,
instead
of
going
to
see
*NL*
them
,
went
to
the
back
porch
and
out
through
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
till
the
end
of
the
destruction
of
Moscow
no
one
of
*NL*
Bezukhov
's
household
,
despite
all
the
search
they
made
,
saw
Pierre
again
*NL*
or
knew
where
he
was
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rostovs
remained
in
Moscow
till
the
first
of
September
,
that
is
,
*NL*
till
the
eve
of
the
enemy
's
entry
into
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Petya
had
joined
Obolenski
's
regiment
of
Cossacks
and
left
for
*NL*
Belaya
Tserkov
where
that
regiment
was
forming
,
the
countess
was
seized
*NL*
with
terror
.
The
thought
that
both
her
sons
were
at
the
war
,
had
both
*NL*
gone
from
under
her
wing
,
that
today
or
tomorrow
either
or
both
of
them
*NL*
might
be
killed
like
the
three
sons
of
one
of
her
acquaintances
,
struck
*NL*
her
that
summer
for
the
first
time
with
cruel
clearness
.
She
tried
to
*NL*
get
Nicholas
back
and
wished
to
go
herself
to
join
Petya
,
or
to
get
him
*NL*
an
appointment
somewhere
in
Petersburg
,
but
neither
of
these
proved
*NL*
possible
.
Petya
could
not
return
unless
his
regiment
did
so
or
unless
he
*NL*
was
transferred
to
another
regiment
on
active
service
.
Nicholas
was
*NL*
somewhere
with
the
army
and
had
not
sent
a
word
since
his
last
letter
,
*NL*
in
which
he
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
his
meeting
with
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
The
countess
did
not
sleep
at
night
,
or
when
she
did
fall
asleep
*NL*
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
sons
lying
dead
.
After
many
consultations
and
*NL*
conversations
,
the
count
at
last
devised
means
to
tranquillize
her
.
He
*NL*
got
Petya
transferred
from
Obolenski
's
regiment
to
Bezukhov
's
,
which
was
*NL*
in
training
near
Moscow
.
Though
Petya
would
remain
in
the
service
,
this
*NL*
transfer
would
give
the
countess
the
consolation
of
seeing
at
least
one
*NL*
of
her
sons
under
her
wing
,
and
she
hoped
to
arrange
matters
for
her
*NL*
Petya
so
as
not
to
let
him
go
again
,
but
always
get
him
appointed
to
*NL*
places
where
he
could
not
possibly
take
part
in
a
battle
.
As
long
as
*NL*
Nicholas
alone
was
in
danger
the
countess
imagined
that
she
loved
her
*NL*
first-born
more
than
all
her
other
children
and
even
reproached
herself
*NL*
for
it
;
but
when
her
youngest
:
the
scapegrace
who
had
been
bad
at
*NL*
lessons
,
was
always
breaking
things
in
the
house
and
making
himself
a
*NL*
nuisance
to
everybody
,
that
snub-nosed
Petya
with
his
merry
black
eyes
*NL*
and
fresh
rosy
cheeks
where
soft
down
was
just
beginning
to
show
--
when
*NL*
he
was
thrown
amid
those
big
,
dreadful
,
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
*NL*
somewhere
about
something
and
apparently
finding
pleasure
in
it
--
then
*NL*
his
mother
thought
she
loved
him
more
,
much
more
,
than
all
her
other
*NL*
children
.
The
nearer
the
time
came
for
Petya
to
return
,
the
more
uneasy
*NL*
grew
the
countess
.
She
began
to
think
she
would
never
live
to
see
such
*NL*
happiness
.
The
presence
of
Sonya
,
of
her
beloved
Natasha
,
or
even
of
her
*NL*
husband
irritated
her
.
``
What
do
I
want
with
them
?
I
want
no
one
but
*NL*
Petya
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
August
the
Rostovs
received
another
letter
from
Nicholas
.
*NL*
He
wrote
from
the
province
of
Voronezh
where
he
had
been
sent
to
procure
*NL*
remounts
,
but
that
letter
did
not
set
the
countess
at
ease
.
Knowing
that
*NL*
one
son
was
out
of
danger
she
became
the
more
anxious
about
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
by
the
twentieth
of
August
nearly
all
the
Rostovs
'
acquaintances
*NL*
had
left
Moscow
,
and
though
everybody
tried
to
persuade
the
countess
to
*NL*
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
,
she
would
not
hear
of
leaving
before
*NL*
her
treasure
,
her
adored
Petya
,
returned
.
On
the
twenty-eighth
of
August
*NL*
he
arrived
.
The
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
received
him
*NL*
did
not
please
the
sixteen-year-old
officer
.
Though
she
concealed
from
*NL*
him
her
intention
of
keeping
him
under
her
wing
,
Petya
guessed
her
*NL*
designs
,
and
instinctively
fearing
that
he
might
give
way
to
emotion
*NL*
when
with
her
--
might
``
become
womanish
''
as
he
termed
it
to
himself
--
he
*NL*
treated
her
coldly
,
avoided
her
,
and
during
his
stay
in
Moscow
attached
*NL*
himself
exclusively
to
Natasha
for
whom
he
had
always
had
a
particularly
*NL*
brotherly
tenderness
,
almost
lover-like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
the
count
's
customary
carelessness
nothing
was
ready
for
their
*NL*
departure
by
the
twenty-eighth
of
August
and
the
carts
that
were
to
come
*NL*
from
their
Ryazan
and
Moscow
estates
to
remove
their
household
*NL*
belongings
did
not
arrive
till
the
thirtieth
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
twenty-eighth
till
the
thirty-first
all
Moscow
was
in
a
bustle
*NL*
and
commotion
.
Every
day
thousands
of
men
wounded
at
Borodino
were
*NL*
brought
in
by
the
Dorogomilov
gate
and
taken
to
various
parts
of
Moscow
,
*NL*
and
thousands
of
carts
conveyed
the
inhabitants
and
their
possessions
*NL*
out
by
the
other
gates
.
In
spite
of
Rostopchin
's
broadsheets
,
or
because
*NL*
of
them
or
independently
of
them
,
the
strangest
and
most
contradictory
*NL*
rumors
were
current
in
the
town
.
Some
said
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
*NL*
to
leave
the
city
,
others
on
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
*NL*
been
taken
out
of
the
churches
and
everybody
was
to
be
ordered
to
leave
.
*NL*
Some
said
there
had
been
another
battle
after
Borodino
at
which
the
*NL*
French
had
been
routed
,
while
others
on
the
contrary
reported
that
the
*NL*
Russian
army
had
been
destroyed
.
Some
talked
about
the
Moscow
militia
*NL*
which
,
preceded
by
the
clergy
,
would
go
to
the
Three
Hills
;
others
*NL*
whispered
that
Augustin
had
been
forbidden
to
leave
,
that
traitors
had
*NL*
been
seized
,
that
the
peasants
were
rioting
and
robbing
people
on
their
*NL*
way
from
Moscow
,
and
so
on
.
But
all
this
was
only
talk
;
in
reality
*NL*
-LRB-
though
the
Council
of
Fili
,
at
which
it
was
decided
to
abandon
Moscow
,
*NL*
had
not
yet
been
held
-RRB-
both
those
who
went
away
and
those
who
remained
*NL*
behind
felt
,
though
they
did
not
show
it
,
that
Moscow
would
certainly
be
*NL*
abandoned
,
and
that
they
ought
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
*NL*
save
their
belongings
.
It
was
felt
that
everything
would
suddenly
break
*NL*
up
and
change
,
but
up
to
the
first
of
September
nothing
had
done
so
.
As
*NL*
a
criminal
who
is
being
led
to
execution
knows
that
he
must
die
*NL*
immediately
,
but
yet
looks
about
him
and
straightens
the
cap
that
is
*NL*
awry
on
his
head
,
so
Moscow
involuntarily
continued
its
wonted
life
,
*NL*
though
it
knew
that
the
time
of
its
destruction
was
near
when
the
*NL*
conditions
of
life
to
which
its
people
were
accustomed
to
submit
would
*NL*
be
completely
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
three
days
preceding
the
occupation
of
Moscow
the
whole
*NL*
Rostov
family
was
absorbed
in
various
activities
.
The
head
of
the
*NL*
family
,
Count
Ilya
Rostov
,
continually
drove
about
the
city
collecting
*NL*
the
current
rumors
from
all
sides
and
gave
superficial
and
hasty
orders
*NL*
at
home
about
the
preparations
for
their
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
watched
the
things
being
packed
,
was
dissatisfied
with
*NL*
everything
,
was
constantly
in
pursuit
of
Petya
who
was
always
running
*NL*
away
from
her
,
and
was
jealous
of
Natasha
with
whom
he
spent
all
his
*NL*
time
.
Sonya
alone
directed
the
practical
side
of
matters
by
getting
*NL*
things
packed
.
But
of
late
Sonya
had
been
particularly
sad
and
silent
.
*NL*
Nicholas
'
letter
in
which
he
mentioned
Princess
Mary
had
elicited
,
in
*NL*
her
presence
,
joyous
comments
from
the
countess
,
who
saw
an
intervention
*NL*
of
Providence
in
this
meeting
of
the
princess
and
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
pleased
at
Bolkonski
's
engagement
to
Natasha
,
''
said
the
*NL*
countess
,
``
but
I
always
wanted
Nicholas
to
marry
the
princess
,
and
had
a
*NL*
presentiment
that
it
would
happen
.
What
a
good
thing
it
would
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
felt
that
this
was
true
:
that
the
only
possibility
of
retrieving
*NL*
the
Rostovs
'
affairs
was
by
Nicholas
marrying
a
rich
woman
,
and
that
the
*NL*
princess
was
a
good
match
.
It
was
very
bitter
for
her
.
But
despite
her
*NL*
grief
,
or
perhaps
just
because
of
it
,
she
took
on
herself
all
the
*NL*
difficult
work
of
directing
the
storing
and
packing
of
their
things
and
*NL*
was
busy
for
whole
days
.
The
count
and
countess
turned
to
her
when
they
*NL*
had
any
orders
to
give
.
Petya
and
Natasha
on
the
contrary
,
far
from
*NL*
helping
their
parents
,
were
generally
a
nuisance
and
a
hindrance
to
*NL*
everyone
.
Almost
all
day
long
the
house
resounded
with
their
running
*NL*
feet
,
their
cries
,
and
their
spontaneous
laughter
.
They
laughed
and
were
*NL*
gay
not
because
there
was
any
reason
to
laugh
,
but
because
gaiety
and
*NL*
mirth
were
in
their
hearts
and
so
everything
that
happened
was
a
cause
*NL*
for
gaiety
and
laughter
to
them
.
Petya
was
in
high
spirits
because
*NL*
having
left
home
a
boy
he
had
returned
-LRB-
as
everybody
told
him
-RRB-
a
fine
*NL*
young
man
,
because
he
was
at
home
,
because
he
had
left
Belaya
Tserkov
*NL*
where
there
was
no
hope
of
soon
taking
part
in
a
battle
and
had
come
to
*NL*
Moscow
where
there
was
to
be
fighting
in
a
few
days
,
and
chiefly
because
*NL*
Natasha
,
whose
lead
he
always
followed
,
was
in
high
spirits
.
Natasha
was
*NL*
gay
because
she
had
been
sad
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
of
*NL*
the
cause
of
her
sadness
,
and
because
she
was
feeling
well
.
She
was
also
*NL*
happy
because
she
had
someone
to
adore
her
:
the
adoration
of
others
was
*NL*
a
lubricant
the
wheels
of
her
machine
needed
to
make
them
run
freely
--
*NL*
and
Petya
adored
her
.
Above
all
,
they
were
gay
because
there
was
a
war
*NL*
near
Moscow
,
there
would
be
fighting
at
the
town
gates
,
arms
were
being
*NL*
given
out
,
everybody
was
escaping
--
going
away
somewhere
,
and
in
general
*NL*
something
extraordinary
was
happening
,
and
that
is
always
exciting
,
*NL*
especially
to
the
young
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
,
the
thirty-first
of
August
,
everything
in
the
Rostovs
'
*NL*
house
seemed
topsy-turvy
.
All
the
doors
were
open
,
all
the
furniture
was
*NL*
being
carried
out
or
moved
about
,
and
the
mirrors
and
pictures
had
been
*NL*
taken
down
.
There
were
trunks
in
the
rooms
,
and
hay
,
wrapping
paper
,
and
*NL*
ropes
were
scattered
about
.
The
peasants
and
house
serfs
carrying
out
*NL*
the
things
were
treading
heavily
on
the
parquet
floors
.
The
yard
was
*NL*
crowded
with
peasant
carts
,
some
loaded
high
and
already
corded
up
,
*NL*
others
still
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
many
servants
and
of
the
peasants
who
*NL*
had
come
with
the
carts
resounded
as
they
shouted
to
one
another
in
the
*NL*
yard
and
in
the
house
.
The
count
had
been
out
since
morning
.
The
*NL*
countess
had
a
headache
brought
on
by
all
the
noise
and
turmoil
and
was
*NL*
lying
down
in
the
new
sitting
room
with
a
vinegar
compress
on
her
head
.
*NL*
Petya
was
not
at
home
,
he
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
with
whom
he
meant
*NL*
to
obtain
a
transfer
from
the
militia
to
the
active
army
.
Sonya
was
in
*NL*
the
ballroom
looking
after
the
packing
of
the
glass
and
china
.
Natasha
*NL*
was
sitting
on
the
floor
of
her
dismantled
room
with
dresses
,
ribbons
,
*NL*
and
scarves
strewn
all
about
her
,
gazing
fixedly
at
the
floor
and
*NL*
holding
in
her
hands
the
old
ball
dress
-LRB-
already
out
of
fashion
-RRB-
which
*NL*
she
had
worn
at
her
first
Petersburg
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
when
everyone
else
was
so
busy
,
and
*NL*
several
times
that
morning
had
tried
to
set
to
work
,
but
her
heart
was
*NL*
not
in
it
,
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
except
*NL*
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
might
.
For
a
while
she
had
stood
beside
*NL*
Sonya
while
the
china
was
being
packed
and
tried
to
help
,
but
soon
gave
*NL*
it
up
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
her
own
things
.
At
first
she
found
it
*NL*
amusing
to
give
away
dresses
and
ribbons
to
the
maids
,
but
when
that
was
*NL*
done
and
what
was
left
had
still
to
be
packed
,
she
found
it
dull
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dunyasha
,
you
pack
!
You
will
,
wo
n't
you
,
dear
?
''
And
when
Dunyasha
*NL*
willingly
promised
to
do
it
all
for
her
,
Natasha
sat
down
on
the
floor
,
*NL*
took
her
old
ball
dress
,
and
fell
into
a
reverie
quite
unrelated
to
what
*NL*
ought
to
have
occupied
her
thoughts
now
.
She
was
roused
from
her
reverie
*NL*
by
the
talk
of
the
maids
in
the
next
room
-LRB-
which
was
theirs
-RRB-
and
by
the
*NL*
sound
of
their
hurried
footsteps
going
to
the
back
porch
.
Natasha
got
up
*NL*
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
An
enormously
long
row
of
carts
full
of
*NL*
wounded
men
had
stopped
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
housekeeper
,
the
old
nurse
,
the
cooks
,
coachmen
,
maids
,
footmen
,
*NL*
postilions
,
and
scullions
stood
at
the
gate
,
staring
at
the
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
throwing
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
over
her
hair
and
holding
*NL*
an
end
of
it
in
each
hand
,
went
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
former
housekeeper
,
old
Mavra
Kuzminichna
,
had
stepped
out
of
the
*NL*
crowd
by
the
gate
,
gone
up
to
a
cart
with
a
hood
constructed
of
bast
*NL*
mats
,
and
was
speaking
to
a
pale
young
officer
who
lay
inside
.
Natasha
*NL*
moved
a
few
steps
forward
and
stopped
shyly
,
still
holding
her
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
listened
to
what
the
housekeeper
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
nobody
in
Moscow
?
''
she
was
saying
.
``
You
would
be
more
*NL*
comfortable
somewhere
in
a
house
...
in
ours
,
for
instance
...
the
family
*NL*
are
leaving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
if
it
would
be
allowed
,
''
replied
the
officer
in
a
weak
*NL*
voice
.
``
Here
is
our
commanding
officer
...
ask
him
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
a
*NL*
stout
major
who
was
walking
back
along
the
street
past
the
row
of
carts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
glanced
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
face
of
the
wounded
officer
*NL*
and
at
once
went
to
meet
the
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
wounded
men
stay
in
our
house
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
major
raised
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
one
do
you
want
,
Ma'am
`
selle
?
''
said
he
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
quietly
repeated
her
question
,
and
her
face
and
whole
manner
*NL*
were
so
serious
,
though
she
was
still
holding
the
ends
of
her
*NL*
handkerchief
,
that
the
major
ceased
smiling
and
after
some
reflection
--
*NL*
as
if
considering
in
how
far
the
thing
was
possible
--
replied
in
the
*NL*
affirmative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
why
not
?
They
may
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
,
Natasha
stepped
back
quickly
to
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
,
who
stood
talking
compassionately
to
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
.
He
says
they
may
!
''
whispered
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cart
in
which
the
officer
lay
was
turned
into
the
Rostovs
'
yard
,
and
*NL*
dozens
of
carts
with
wounded
men
began
at
the
invitation
of
the
*NL*
townsfolk
to
turn
into
the
yards
and
to
draw
up
at
the
entrances
of
the
*NL*
houses
in
Povarskaya
Street
.
Natasha
was
evidently
pleased
to
be
dealing
*NL*
with
new
people
outside
the
ordinary
routine
of
her
life
.
She
and
Mavra
*NL*
Kuzminichna
tried
to
get
as
many
of
the
wounded
as
possible
into
their
*NL*
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Papa
must
be
told
,
though
,
''
said
Mavra
Kuzminichna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
never
mind
,
what
does
it
matter
?
For
one
day
we
can
move
*NL*
into
the
drawing
room
.
They
can
have
all
our
half
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
young
lady
,
you
do
take
things
into
your
head
!
Even
if
we
*NL*
put
them
into
the
wing
,
the
men
's
room
,
or
the
nurse
's
room
,
we
must
ask
*NL*
permission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
ran
into
the
house
and
went
on
tiptoe
through
the
half-open
door
*NL*
into
the
sitting
room
,
where
there
was
a
smell
of
vinegar
and
Hoffman
's
*NL*
drops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
asleep
,
Mamma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
sleep
-
?
''
said
the
countess
,
waking
up
just
as
she
was
dropping
*NL*
into
a
doze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
darling
!
''
said
Natasha
,
kneeling
by
her
mother
and
bringing
her
*NL*
face
close
to
her
mother
's
,
``
I
am
sorry
,
forgive
me
,
I
'll
never
do
it
*NL*
again
;
I
woke
you
up
!
Mavra
Kuzminichna
has
sent
me
:
they
have
brought
*NL*
some
wounded
here
--
officers
.
Will
you
let
them
come
?
They
have
nowhere
*NL*
to
go
.
I
knew
you
'd
let
them
come
!
''
she
said
quickly
all
in
one
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
officers
?
Whom
have
they
brought
?
I
do
n't
understand
anything
*NL*
about
it
,
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
laughed
,
and
the
countess
too
smiled
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
'd
give
permission
...
so
I
'll
tell
them
,
''
and
,
having
kissed
*NL*
her
mother
,
Natasha
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
she
met
her
father
,
who
had
returned
with
bad
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
stayed
too
long
!
''
said
the
count
with
involuntary
vexation
.
``
The
*NL*
club
is
closed
and
the
police
are
leaving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
is
it
all
right
--
I
've
invited
some
of
the
wounded
into
the
*NL*
house
?
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
he
answered
absently
.
``
That
's
not
the
point
.
I
beg
*NL*
you
not
to
indulge
in
trifles
now
,
but
to
help
to
pack
,
and
tomorrow
we
*NL*
must
go
,
go
,
go
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
count
gave
a
similar
order
to
the
major-domo
and
the
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
Petya
having
returned
home
told
them
the
news
he
had
heard
.
He
*NL*
said
the
people
had
been
getting
arms
in
the
Kremlin
,
and
that
though
*NL*
Rostopchin
's
broadsheet
had
said
that
he
would
sound
a
call
two
or
three
*NL*
days
in
advance
,
the
order
had
certainly
already
been
given
for
everyone
*NL*
to
go
armed
to
the
Three
Hills
tomorrow
,
and
that
there
would
be
a
big
*NL*
battle
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
looked
with
timid
horror
at
her
son
's
eager
,
excited
face
*NL*
as
he
said
this
.
She
realized
that
if
she
said
a
word
about
his
not
*NL*
going
to
the
battle
-LRB-
she
knew
he
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
impending
*NL*
engagement
-RRB-
he
would
say
something
about
men
,
honor
,
and
the
fatherland
-
*NL*
-
something
senseless
,
masculine
,
and
obstinate
which
there
would
be
no
*NL*
contradicting
,
and
her
plans
would
be
spoiled
;
and
so
,
hoping
to
arrange
*NL*
to
leave
before
then
and
take
Petya
with
her
as
their
protector
and
*NL*
defender
,
she
did
not
answer
him
,
but
after
dinner
called
the
count
*NL*
aside
and
implored
him
with
tears
to
take
her
away
quickly
,
that
very
*NL*
night
if
possible
.
With
a
woman
's
involuntary
loving
cunning
she
,
who
*NL*
till
then
had
not
shown
any
alarm
,
said
that
she
would
die
of
fright
if
*NL*
they
did
not
leave
that
very
night
.
Without
any
pretense
she
was
now
*NL*
afraid
of
everything
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Schoss
,
who
had
been
out
to
visit
her
daughter
,
increased
the
*NL*
countess
'
fears
still
more
by
telling
what
she
had
seen
at
a
spirit
*NL*
dealer
's
in
Myasnitski
Street
.
When
returning
by
that
street
she
had
*NL*
been
unable
to
pass
because
of
a
drunken
crowd
rioting
in
front
of
the
*NL*
shop
.
She
had
taken
a
cab
and
driven
home
by
a
side
street
and
the
*NL*
cabman
had
told
her
that
the
people
were
breaking
open
the
barrels
at
*NL*
the
drink
store
,
having
received
orders
to
do
so

*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
the
whole
Rostov
household
set
to
work
with
enthusiastic
*NL*
haste
packing
their
belongings
and
preparing
for
their
departure
.
The
*NL*
old
count
,
suddenly
setting
to
work
,
kept
passing
from
the
yard
to
the
*NL*
house
and
back
again
,
shouting
confused
instructions
to
the
hurrying
*NL*
people
,
and
flurrying
them
still
more
.
Petya
directed
things
in
the
*NL*
yard
.
Sonya
,
owing
to
the
count
's
contradictory
orders
,
lost
her
head
*NL*
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
The
servants
ran
noisily
about
the
house
*NL*
and
yard
,
shouting
and
disputing
.
Natasha
,
with
the
ardor
characteristic
*NL*
of
all
she
did
suddenly
set
to
work
too
.
At
first
her
intervention
in
*NL*
the
business
of
packing
was
received
skeptically
.
Everybody
expected
*NL*
some
prank
from
her
and
did
not
wish
to
obey
her
;
but
she
resolutely
and
*NL*
passionately
demanded
obedience
,
grew
angry
and
nearly
cried
because
*NL*
they
did
not
heed
her
,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
making
them
believe
her
.
*NL*
Her
first
exploit
,
which
cost
her
immense
effort
and
established
her
*NL*
authority
,
was
the
packing
of
the
carpets
.
The
count
had
valuable
*NL*
Gobelin
tapestries
and
Persian
carpets
in
the
house
.
When
Natasha
set
to
*NL*
work
two
cases
were
standing
open
in
the
ballroom
,
one
almost
full
up
*NL*
with
crockery
,
the
other
with
carpets
.
There
was
also
much
china
*NL*
standing
on
the
tables
,
and
still
more
was
being
brought
in
from
the
*NL*
storeroom
.
A
third
case
was
needed
and
servants
had
gone
to
fetch
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
wait
a
bit
--
we
'll
pack
everything
into
these
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
,
Miss
,
we
have
tried
to
,
''
said
the
butler
's
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
a
minute
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Natasha
began
rapidly
taking
out
of
the
case
dishes
and
plates
*NL*
wrapped
in
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dishes
must
go
in
here
among
the
carpets
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
a
mercy
if
we
can
get
the
carpets
alone
into
three
cases
,
''
*NL*
said
the
butler
's
assistant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
wait
,
please
!
''
And
Natasha
began
rapidly
and
deftly
sorting
out
the
*NL*
things
.
``
These
are
n't
needed
,
''
said
she
,
putting
aside
some
plates
of
*NL*
Kiev
ware
.
``
These
--
yes
,
these
must
go
among
the
carpets
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
referring
to
the
Saxony
china
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Natasha
!
Leave
it
alone
!
We
'll
get
it
all
packed
,
''
urged
Sonya
*NL*
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
young
lady
she
is
!
''
remarked
the
major-domo
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Natasha
would
not
give
in
.
She
turned
everything
out
and
began
*NL*
quickly
repacking
,
deciding
that
the
inferior
Russian
carpets
and
*NL*
unnecessary
crockery
should
not
be
taken
at
all
.
When
everything
had
*NL*
been
taken
out
of
the
cases
,
they
recommenced
packing
,
and
it
turned
out
*NL*
that
when
the
cheaper
things
not
worth
taking
had
nearly
all
been
*NL*
rejected
,
the
valuable
ones
really
did
all
go
into
the
two
cases
.
Only
*NL*
the
lid
of
the
case
containing
the
carpets
would
not
shut
down
.
A
few
*NL*
more
things
might
have
been
taken
out
,
but
Natasha
insisted
on
having
*NL*
her
own
way
.
She
packed
,
repacked
,
pressed
,
made
the
butler
's
assistant
*NL*
and
Petya
--
whom
she
had
drawn
into
the
business
of
packing
--
press
on
the
*NL*
lid
,
and
made
desperate
efforts
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
Natasha
,
''
said
Sonya
.
``
I
see
you
were
right
,
but
just
*NL*
take
out
the
top
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
with
one
hand
holding
back
the
hair
that
hung
*NL*
over
her
perspiring
face
,
while
with
the
other
she
pressed
down
the
*NL*
carpets
.
``
Now
press
,
Petya
!
Press
,
Vasilich
,
press
hard
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carpets
yielded
and
the
lid
closed
;
Natasha
,
clapping
her
hands
,
*NL*
screamed
with
delight
and
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
.
But
this
only
lasted
*NL*
a
moment
.
She
at
once
set
to
work
afresh
and
they
now
trusted
her
*NL*
completely
.
The
count
was
not
angry
even
when
they
told
him
that
Natasha
*NL*
had
countermanded
an
order
of
his
,
and
the
servants
now
came
to
her
to
*NL*
ask
whether
a
cart
was
sufficiently
loaded
,
and
whether
it
might
be
*NL*
corded
up
.
Thanks
to
Natasha
's
directions
the
work
now
went
on
*NL*
expeditiously
,
unnecessary
things
were
left
,
and
the
most
valuable
*NL*
packed
as
compactly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
hard
as
they
all
worked
till
quite
late
that
night
,
they
could
not
*NL*
get
everything
packed
.
The
countess
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
count
,
*NL*
having
put
off
their
departure
till
next
morning
,
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
and
Natasha
slept
in
the
sitting
room
without
undressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
another
wounded
man
was
driven
down
the
Povarskaya
,
and
Mavra
*NL*
Kuzminichna
,
who
was
standing
at
the
gate
,
had
him
brought
into
the
*NL*
Rostovs
'
yard
.
Mavra
Kuzminichna
concluded
that
he
was
a
very
important
*NL*
man
.
He
was
being
conveyed
in
a
caleche
with
a
raised
hood
,
and
was
*NL*
quite
covered
by
an
apron
.
On
the
box
beside
the
driver
sat
a
venerable
*NL*
old
attendant
.
A
doctor
and
two
soldiers
followed
the
carriage
in
a
*NL*
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
in
here
.
The
masters
are
going
away
and
the
whole
house
*NL*
will
be
empty
,
''
said
the
old
woman
to
the
old
attendant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
,
''
said
he
with
a
sigh
.
``
We
do
n't
expect
to
get
him
home
*NL*
alive
!
We
have
a
house
of
our
own
in
Moscow
,
but
it
's
a
long
way
from
*NL*
here
,
and
there
's
nobody
living
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
us
the
honor
to
come
in
,
there
's
plenty
of
everything
in
the
*NL*
master
's
house
.
Come
in
,
''
said
Mavra
Kuzminichna
.
``
Is
he
very
ill
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
made
a
hopeless
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
expect
to
get
him
home
!
We
must
ask
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
servant
got
down
from
the
box
and
went
up
to
the
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
servant
returned
to
the
caleche
,
looked
into
it
,
shook
his
head
*NL*
disconsolately
,
told
the
driver
to
turn
into
the
yard
,
and
stopped
*NL*
beside
Mavra
Kuzminichna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Lord
Jesus
Christ
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
invited
them
to
take
the
wounded
man
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
masters
wo
n't
object
...
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
had
to
avoid
carrying
the
man
upstairs
,
and
so
they
took
him
*NL*
into
the
wing
and
put
him
in
the
room
that
had
been
Madame
Schoss
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
wounded
man
was
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Moscow
's
last
day
had
come
.
It
was
a
clear
bright
autumn
day
,
a
Sunday
.
*NL*
The
church
bells
everywhere
were
ringing
for
service
,
just
as
usual
on
*NL*
Sundays
.
Nobody
seemed
yet
to
realize
what
awaited
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
two
things
indicated
the
social
condition
of
Moscow
--
the
rabble
,
*NL*
that
is
the
poor
people
,
and
the
price
of
commodities
.
An
enormous
crowd
*NL*
of
factory
hands
,
house
serfs
,
and
peasants
,
with
whom
some
officials
,
*NL*
seminarists
,
and
gentry
were
mingled
,
had
gone
early
that
morning
to
the
*NL*
Three
Hills
.
Having
waited
there
for
Rostopchin
who
did
not
turn
up
,
*NL*
they
became
convinced
that
Moscow
would
be
surrendered
,
and
then
*NL*
dispersed
all
about
the
town
to
the
public
houses
and
cookshops
.
Prices
*NL*
too
that
day
indicated
the
state
of
affairs
.
The
price
of
weapons
,
of
*NL*
gold
,
of
carts
and
horses
,
kept
rising
,
but
the
value
of
paper
money
and
*NL*
city
articles
kept
falling
,
so
that
by
midday
there
were
instances
of
*NL*
carters
removing
valuable
goods
,
such
as
cloth
,
and
receiving
in
payment
*NL*
a
half
of
what
they
carted
,
while
peasant
horses
were
fetching
five
*NL*
hundred
rubles
each
,
and
furniture
,
mirrors
,
and
bronzes
were
being
*NL*
given
away
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rostovs
'
staid
old-fashioned
house
the
dissolution
of
former
*NL*
conditions
of
life
was
but
little
noticeable
.
As
to
the
serfs
the
only
*NL*
indication
was
that
three
out
of
their
huge
retinue
disappeared
during
*NL*
the
night
,
but
nothing
was
stolen
;
and
as
to
the
value
of
their
*NL*
possessions
,
the
thirty
peasant
carts
that
had
come
in
from
their
*NL*
estates
and
which
many
people
envied
proved
to
be
extremely
valuable
and
*NL*
they
were
offered
enormous
sums
of
money
for
them
.
Not
only
were
huge
*NL*
sums
offered
for
the
horses
and
carts
,
but
on
the
previous
evening
and
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
of
the
first
of
September
,
orderlies
and
servants
*NL*
sent
by
wounded
officers
came
to
the
Rostovs
'
and
wounded
men
dragged
*NL*
themselves
there
from
the
Rostovs
'
and
from
neighboring
houses
where
*NL*
they
were
accommodated
,
entreating
the
servants
to
try
to
get
them
a
*NL*
lift
out
of
Moscow
.
The
major-domo
to
whom
these
entreaties
were
*NL*
addressed
,
though
he
was
sorry
for
the
wounded
,
resolutely
refused
,
*NL*
saying
that
he
dare
not
even
mention
the
matter
to
the
count
.
Pity
these
*NL*
wounded
men
as
one
might
,
it
was
evident
that
if
they
were
given
one
*NL*
cart
there
would
be
no
reason
to
refuse
another
,
or
all
the
carts
and
*NL*
one
's
own
carriages
as
well
.
Thirty
carts
could
not
save
all
the
wounded
*NL*
and
in
the
general
catastrophe
one
could
not
disregard
oneself
and
one
's
*NL*
own
family
.
So
thought
the
major-domo
on
his
master
's
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
waking
up
that
morning
Count
Ilya
Rostov
left
his
bedroom
softly
,
so
*NL*
as
not
to
wake
the
countess
who
had
fallen
asleep
only
toward
morning
,
*NL*
and
came
out
to
the
porch
in
his
lilac
silk
dressing
gown
.
In
the
yard
*NL*
stood
the
carts
ready
corded
.
The
carriages
were
at
the
front
porch
.
The
*NL*
major-domo
stood
at
the
porch
talking
to
an
elderly
orderly
and
to
a
*NL*
pale
young
officer
with
a
bandaged
arm
.
On
seeing
the
count
the
major
-
*NL*
domo
made
a
significant
and
stern
gesture
to
them
both
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Vasilich
,
is
everything
ready
?
''
asked
the
count
,
and
stroking
his
*NL*
bald
head
he
looked
good-naturedly
at
the
officer
and
the
orderly
and
*NL*
nodded
to
them
.
-LRB-
He
liked
to
see
new
faces
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
harness
at
once
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
right
.
As
soon
as
the
countess
wakes
we
'll
be
off
,
God
*NL*
willing
!
What
is
it
,
gentlemen
?
''
he
added
,
turning
to
the
officer
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
staying
in
my
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
came
nearer
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
crimson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
,
be
so
good
as
to
allow
me
...
for
God
's
sake
,
to
get
into
some
*NL*
corner
of
one
of
your
carts
!
I
have
nothing
here
with
me
...
I
shall
be
*NL*
all
right
on
a
loaded
cart
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
officer
had
finished
speaking
the
orderly
made
the
same
*NL*
request
on
behalf
of
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
''
said
the
count
hastily
.
``
I
shall
be
very
pleased
,
*NL*
very
pleased
.
Vasilich
,
you
'll
see
to
it
.
Just
unload
one
or
two
carts
.
*NL*
Well
,
what
of
it
...
do
what
's
necessary
...
''
said
the
count
,
muttering
*NL*
some
indefinite
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
same
moment
an
expression
of
warm
gratitude
on
the
officer
's
*NL*
face
had
already
sealed
the
order
.
The
count
looked
around
him
.
In
the
*NL*
yard
,
at
the
gates
,
at
the
window
of
the
wings
,
wounded
officers
and
*NL*
their
orderlies
were
to
be
seen
.
They
were
all
looking
at
the
count
and
*NL*
moving
toward
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
step
into
the
gallery
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
the
major-domo
.
*NL*
``
What
are
your
orders
about
the
pictures
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
went
into
the
house
with
him
,
repeating
his
order
not
to
*NL*
refuse
the
wounded
who
asked
for
a
lift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
,
some
of
the
things
can
be
unloaded
,
''
he
added
in
a
*NL*
soft
,
confidential
voice
,
as
though
afraid
of
being
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
the
countess
woke
up
,
and
Matrena
Timofeevna
,
who
had
*NL*
been
her
lady
's
maid
before
her
marriage
and
now
performed
a
sort
of
*NL*
chief
gendarme
's
duty
for
her
,
came
to
say
that
Madame
Schoss
was
much
*NL*
offended
and
the
young
ladies
'
summer
dresses
could
not
be
left
behind
.
*NL*
On
inquiry
,
the
countess
learned
that
Madame
Schoss
was
offended
because
*NL*
her
trunk
had
been
taken
down
from
its
cart
,
and
all
the
loads
were
*NL*
being
uncorded
and
the
luggage
taken
out
of
the
carts
to
make
room
for
*NL*
wounded
men
whom
the
count
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
had
ordered
*NL*
that
they
should
take
with
them
.
The
countess
sent
for
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
,
my
dear
?
I
hear
that
the
luggage
is
being
unloaded

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
love

I
wanted
to
tell
you

Countess
dear

an
officer
*NL*
came
to
me
to
ask
for
a
few
carts
for
the
wounded
.
After
all
,
ours
are
*NL*
things
that
can
be
bought
but
think
what
being
left
behind
means
to
*NL*
them
!
...
Really
now
,
in
our
own
yard
--
we
asked
them
in
ourselves
and
*NL*
there
are
officers
among
them
...
You
know
,
I
think
,
my

let
them
*NL*
be
taken

where
's
the
hurry

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
spoke
timidly
,
as
he
always
did
when
talking
of
money
matters
.
*NL*
The
countess
was
accustomed
to
this
tone
as
a
precursor
of
news
of
*NL*
something
detrimental
to
the
children
's
interests
,
such
as
the
building
*NL*
of
a
new
gallery
or
conservatory
,
the
inauguration
of
a
private
theater
*NL*
or
an
orchestra
.
She
was
accustomed
always
to
oppose
anything
announced
*NL*
in
that
timid
tone
and
considered
it
her
duty
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
assumed
her
dolefully
submissive
manner
and
said
to
her
husband
:
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
Count
,
you
have
managed
matters
so
that
we
are
getting
*NL*
nothing
for
the
house
,
and
now
you
wish
to
throw
away
all
our
--
all
the
*NL*
children
's
property
!
You
said
yourself
that
we
have
a
hundred
thousand
*NL*
rubles

worth
of
things
in
the
house
.
I
do
n't
consent
,
my
dear
,
I
do
n't
!
*NL*
Do
as
you
please

It
's
the
government
's
business
to
look
after
the
*NL*
wounded
;
they
know
that
.
Look
at
the
Lopukhins
opposite
,
they
cleared
*NL*
out
everything
two
days
ago
.
That
's
what
other
people
do
.
It
's
only
we
*NL*
who
are
such
fools
.
If
you
have
no
pity
on
me
,
have
some
for
the
*NL*
children

''
*NL*
*NL*
Flourishing
his
arms
in
despair
the
count
left
the
room
without
*NL*
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
what
are
you
doing
that
for

asked
Natasha

who
had
followed
him

into
her
mother

room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

What

muttered
the

angrily

*NL*
*NL*
``

Natasha

cried

*NL*
Natasha
stepped
up

pondered

*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
,
the
Rostovs
'
son-in-law
,
was
already
a
colonel
wearing
the
orders
*NL*
of
Vladimir
and
Anna
,
and
he
still
filled
the
quiet
and
agreeable
post
*NL*
of
assistant
to
the
head
of
the
staff
of
the
assistant
commander
of
the
*NL*
first
division
of
the
Second
Army
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
of
September
he
had
come
to
Moscow
from
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
nothing
to
do
in
Moscow
,
but
he
had
noticed
that
everyone
in
the
*NL*
army
was
asking
for
leave
to
visit
Moscow
and
had
something
to
do
there
.
*NL*
So
he
considered
it
necessary
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
for
family
and
*NL*
domestic
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
drove
up
to
his
father-in-law
's
house
in
his
spruce
little
trap
*NL*
with
a
pair
of
sleek
roans
,
exactly
like
those
of
a
certain
prince
.
He
*NL*
looked
attentively
at
the
carts
in
the
yard
and
while
going
up
to
the
*NL*
porch
took
out
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
and
tied
a
knot
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
anteroom
Berg
ran
with
smooth
though
impatient
steps
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
where
he
embraced
the
count
,
kissed
the
hands
of
Natasha
*NL*
and
Sonya
,
and
hastened
to
inquire
after
``
Mamma
's
''
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Health
,
at
a
time
like
this
?
''
said
the
count
.
``
Come
,
tell
us
the
news
!
*NL*
Is
the
army
retreating
or
will
there
be
another
battle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
Almighty
alone
can
decide
the
fate
of
our
fatherland
,
Papa
,
''
said
*NL*
Berg
.
``
The
army
is
burning
with
a
spirit
of
heroism
and
the
leaders
,
so
*NL*
to
say
,
have
now
assembled
in
council
.
No
one
knows
what
is
coming
.
But
*NL*
in
general
I
can
tell
you
,
Papa
,
that
such
a
heroic
spirit
,
the
truly
*NL*
antique
valor
of
the
Russian
army
,
which
they
--
which
it
''
-LRB-
he
corrected
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
``
has
shown
or
displayed
in
the
battle
of
the
twenty-sixth
--
*NL*
there
are
no
words
worthy
to
do
it
justice
!
I
tell
you
,
Papa
''
-LRB-
he
smote
*NL*
himself
on
the
breast
as
a
general
he
had
heard
speaking
had
done
,
but
*NL*
Berg
did
it
a
trifle
late
for
he
should
have
struck
his
breast
at
the
*NL*
words
``
Russian
army
''
-RRB-
,
``
I
tell
you
frankly
that
we
,
the
commanders
,
far
*NL*
from
having
to
urge
the
men
on
or
anything
of
that
kind
,
could
hardly
*NL*
restrain
those
...
those
...
yes
,
those
exploits
of
antique
valor
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
rapidly
.
``
General
Barclay
de
Tolly
risked
his
life
everywhere
at
*NL*
the
head
of
the
troops
,
I
can
assure
you
.
Our
corps
was
stationed
on
a
*NL*
hillside
.
You
can
imagine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Berg
related
all
that
he
remembered
of
the
various
tales
he
had
*NL*
heard
those
days
.
Natasha
watched
him
with
an
intent
gaze
that
confused
*NL*
him
,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
find
in
his
face
the
answer
to
some
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altogether
such
heroism
as
was
displayed
by
the
Russian
warriors
can
not
*NL*
be
imagined
or
adequately
praised
!
''
said
Berg
,
glancing
round
at
*NL*
Natasha
,
and
as
if
anxious
to
conciliate
her
,
replying
to
her
intent
*NL*
look
with
a
smile
.
''
`
Russia
is
not
in
Moscow
,
she
lives
in
the
hearts
of
*NL*
her
sons
!
'
Is
n't
it
so
,
Papa
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
countess
came
in
from
the
sitting
room
with
a
weary
and
*NL*
dissatisfied
expression
.
Berg
hurriedly
jumped
up
,
kissed
her
hand
,
*NL*
asked
about
her
health
,
and
,
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
*NL*
express
sympathy
,
remained
standing
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mamma
,
I
tell
you
sincerely
that
these
are
hard
and
sad
times
for
*NL*
every
Russian
.
But
why
are
you
so
anxious
?
You
have
still
time
to
get
*NL*
away
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
think
what
the
servants
are
about
,
''
said
the
countess
,
turning
*NL*
to
her
husband
.
``
I
have
just
been
told
that
nothing
is
ready
yet
.
*NL*
Somebody
after
all
must
see
to
things
.
One
misses
Mitenka
at
such
times
.
*NL*
There
wo
n't
be
any
end
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
was
about
to
say
something
,
but
evidently
restrained
himself
.
*NL*
He
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Berg
drew
out
his
handkerchief
as
if
to
blow
his
nose
*NL*
and
,
seeing
the
knot
in
it
,
pondered
,
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
*NL*
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you
,
Papa
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
...
''
said
the
count
,
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
driving
past
Yusupov
's
house
just
now
,
''
said
Berg
with
a
laugh
,
*NL*
``
when
the
steward
,
a
man
I
know
,
ran
out
and
asked
me
whether
I
would
n't
*NL*
buy
something
.
I
went
in
out
of
curiosity
,
you
know
,
and
there
is
a
*NL*
small
chiffonier
and
a
dressing
table
.
You
know
how
dear
Vera
wanted
a
*NL*
chiffonier
like
that
and
how
we
had
a
dispute
about
it
.
''
-LRB-
At
the
mention
*NL*
of
the
chiffonier
and
dressing
table
Berg
involuntarily
changed
his
tone
*NL*
to
one
of
pleasure
at
his
admirable
domestic
arrangements
.
-RRB-
``
And
it
's
*NL*
such
a
beauty
!
It
pulls
out
and
has
a
secret
English
drawer
,
you
know
!
*NL*
And
dear
Vera
has
long
wanted
one
.
I
wish
to
give
her
a
surprise
,
you
*NL*
see
.
I
saw
so
many
of
those
peasant
carts
in
your
yard
.
Please
let
me
*NL*
have
one
,
I
will
pay
the
man
well
,
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
frowned
and
coughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
the
countess
,
I
do
n't
give
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
inconvenient
,
please
do
n't
,
''
said
Berg
.
``
Only
I
so
wanted
it
,
*NL*
for
dear
Vera
's
sake

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

go
to
the
devil

all

To

*NL*
cried
the
old
count
.
``
My
head
's
in
a
whirl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
left
the
room
.
The
countess
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mamma
!
Yes
,
these
are
very
hard
times
!
''
said
Berg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
left
the
room
with
her
father
and
,
as
if
finding
it
difficult
to
*NL*
reach
some
decision
,
first
followed
him
and
then
ran
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
was
in
the
porch
,
engaged
in
giving
out
weapons
to
the
servants
*NL*
who
were
to
leave
Moscow
.
The
loaded
carts
were
still
standing
in
the
*NL*
yard
.
Two
of
them
had
been
uncorded
and
a
wounded
officer
was
climbing
*NL*
into
one
of
them
helped
by
an
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
it
's
about
?
''
Petya
asked
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
understood
that
he
meant
what
were
their
parents
quarreling
about
.
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
Papa
wanted
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
,
''
said
*NL*
Petya
.
``
Vasilich
told
me
.
I
consider

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider

''
Natasha
suddenly
almost
shouted
,
turning
her
angry
face
to
*NL*
Petya
,
``
I
consider
it
so
horrid
,
so
abominable
,
so
...
I
do
n't
know
what

*NL*
Are
we
despicable
Germans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
throat
quivered
with
convulsive
sobs
and
,
afraid
of
weakening
and
*NL*
letting
the
force
of
her
anger
run
to
waste
,
she
turned
and
rushed
*NL*
headlong
up
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
was
sitting
beside
the
countess
consoling
her
with
the
respectful
*NL*
attention
of
a
relative
.
The
count
,
pipe
in
hand
,
was
pacing
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
,
when
Natasha
,
her
face
distorted
by
anger
,
burst
in
like
a
*NL*
tempest
and
approached
her
mother
with
rapid
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
horrid
!
It
's
abominable
!
''
she
screamed
.
``
You
ca
n't
possibly
have
*NL*
ordered
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Berg
and
the
countess
looked
at
her
,
perplexed
and
frightened
.
The
count
*NL*
stood
still
at
the
window
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
it
's
impossible
:
see
what
is
going
on
in
the
yard
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
``
They
will
be
left
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you

Who
are

they

?
What
do
you
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
wounded

It
's
impossible

Mamma

It
's
monstrous

No

darling

it
's
not
the

Please
forgive
me

Mamma
,
what
*NL*
does
it
matter
what
we
take
away
?
Only
look
what
is
going
on
in
the
*NL*
yard
...
Mamma
!
...
It
's
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
stood
by
the
window
and
listened
without
turning
round
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
sniffed
and
put
his
face
closer
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter
,
saw
her
face
full
of
shame
for
her
*NL*
mother
,
saw
her
agitation
,
and
understood
why
her
husband
did
not
turn
*NL*
to
look
at
her
now
,
and
she
glanced
round
quite
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
as
you
like
!
Am
I
hindering
anyone
?
''
she
said
,
not
surrendering
*NL*
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
darling
,
forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
countess
pushed
her
daughter
away
and
went
up
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
order
what
is
right
...
You
know
I
do
n't
understand
about
*NL*
it
,
''
said
she
,
dropping
her
eyes
shamefacedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
eggs
...
the
eggs
are
teaching
the
hen
,
''
muttered
the
count
through
*NL*
tears
of
joy
,
and
he
embraced
his
wife
who
was
glad
to
hide
her
look
of
*NL*
shame
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
!
Mamma
!
May
I
see
to
it
?
May
I
?
...
''
asked
Natasha
.
``
We
will
still
*NL*
take
all
the
most
necessary
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
nodded
affirmatively
,
and
Natasha
,
at
the
rapid
pace
at
which
*NL*
she
used
to
run
when
playing
at
tag
,
ran
through
the
ballroom
to
the
*NL*
anteroom
and
downstairs
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
gathered
round
Natasha
,
but
could
not
believe
the
strange
*NL*
order
she
brought
them
until
the
count
himself
,
in
his
wife
's
name
,
*NL*
confirmed
the
order
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
and
take
the
*NL*
trunks
to
the
storerooms
.
When
they
understood
that
order
the
servants
*NL*
set
to
work
at
this
new
task
with
pleasure
and
zeal
.
It
no
longer
seemed
*NL*
strange
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
the
only
thing
that
could
*NL*
be
done
,
just
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
had
not
seemed
strange
*NL*
to
anyone
that
the
wounded
should
be
left
behind
and
the
goods
carted
*NL*
away
but
that
had
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
household
,
as
if
to
atone
for
not
having
done
it
sooner
,
set
*NL*
eagerly
to
work
at
the
new
task
of
placing
the
wounded
in
the
carts
.
The
*NL*
wounded
dragged
themselves
out
of
their
rooms
and
stood
with
pale
but
*NL*
happy
faces
round
the
carts
.
The
news
that
carts
were
to
be
had
spread
*NL*
to
the
neighboring
houses
,
from
which
wounded
men
began
to
come
into
the
*NL*
Rostovs
'
yard
.
Many
of
the
wounded
asked
them
not
to
unload
the
carts
*NL*
but
only
to
let
them
sit
on
the
top
of
the
things
.
But
the
work
of
*NL*
unloading
,
once
started
,
could
not
be
arrested
.
It
seemed
not
to
matter
*NL*
whether
all
or
only
half
the
things
were
left
behind
.
Cases
full
of
*NL*
china
,
bronzes
,
pictures
,
and
mirrors
that
had
been
so
carefully
packed
*NL*
the
night
before
now
lay
about
the
yard
,
and
still
they
went
on
*NL*
searching
for
and
finding
possibilities
of
unloading
this
or
that
and
*NL*
letting
the
wounded
have
another
and
yet
another
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
take
four
more
men
,
''
said
the
steward
.
``
They
can
have
my
trap
,
*NL*
or
else
what
is
to
become
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
have
my
wardrobe
cart
,
''
said
the
countess
.
``
Dunyasha
can
go
*NL*
with
me
in
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
unloaded
the
wardrobe
cart
and
sent
it
to
take
wounded
men
from
a
*NL*
house
two
doors
off
.
The
whole
household
,
servants
included
,
was
bright
*NL*
and
animated
.
Natasha
was
in
a
state
of
rapturous
excitement
such
as
she
*NL*
had
not
known
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
could
we
fasten
this
onto
?
''
asked
the
servants
,
trying
to
fix
a
*NL*
trunk
on
the
narrow
footboard
behind
a
carriage
.
``
We
must
keep
at
least
*NL*
one
cart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
in
it
?
''
asked
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
's
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
,
Vasilich
will
put
it
away
.
It
's
not
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
phaeton
was
full
of
people
and
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
where
Count
*NL*
Peter
could
sit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
box
.
You
'll
sit
on
the
box
,
wo
n't
you
,
Petya
?
''
cried
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
too
was
busy
all
this
time
,
but
the
aim
of
her
efforts
was
quite
*NL*
different
from
Natasha
's
.
She
was
putting
away
the
things
that
had
to
be
*NL*
left
behind
and
making
a
list
of
them
as
the
countess
wished
,
and
she
*NL*
tried
to
get
as
much
taken
away
with
them
as
possible
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Before
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
Rostovs
'
four
carriages
,
packed
*NL*
full
and
with
the
horses
harnessed
,
stood
at
the
front
door
.
One
by
one
*NL*
the
carts
with
the
wounded
had
moved
out
of
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
caleche
in
which
Prince
Andrew
was
being
taken
attracted
Sonya
's
*NL*
attention
as
it
passed
the
front
porch
.
With
the
help
of
a
maid
she
was
*NL*
arranging
a
seat
for
the
countess
in
the
huge
high
coach
that
stood
at
*NL*
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
caleche
is
that
?
''
she
inquired
,
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
n't
you
know
,
Miss
?
''
replied
the
maid
.
``
The
wounded
prince
:
he
*NL*
spent
the
night
in
our
house
and
is
going
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
is
it
?
What
's
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
our
intended
that
was
--
Prince
Bolkonski
himself
!
They
say
he
is
*NL*
dying
,
''
replied
the
maid
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
jumped
out
of
the
coach
and
ran
to
the
countess
.
The
countess
,
*NL*
tired
out
and
already
dressed
in
shawl
and
bonnet
for
her
journey
,
was
*NL*
pacing
up
and
down
the
drawing
room
,
waiting
for
the
household
to
*NL*
assemble
for
the
usual
silent
prayer
with
closed
doors
before
starting
.
*NL*
Natasha
was
not
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
said
Sonya
,
``
Prince
Andrew
is
here
,
mortally
wounded
.
He
is
*NL*
going
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
opened
her
eyes
in
dismay
and
,
seizing
Sonya
's
arm
,
glanced
*NL*
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
?
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
this
news
had
only
one
significance
for
both
of
them
.
*NL*
They
knew
their
Natasha
,
and
alarm
as
to
what
would
happen
if
she
heard
*NL*
this
news
stifled
all
sympathy
for
the
man
they
both
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
does
not
know
yet
,
but
he
is
going
with
us
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
he
is
dying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
put
her
arms
around
Sonya
and
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ways
of
God
are
past
finding
out
!
''
she
thought
,
feeling
that
the
*NL*
Almighty
Hand
,
hitherto
unseen
,
was
becoming
manifest
in
all
that
was
*NL*
now
taking
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mamma
?
Everything
is
ready
.
What
's
the
matter
?
''
asked
Natasha
,
as
*NL*
with
animated
face
she
ran
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
answered
the
countess
.
``
If
everything
is
ready
let
us
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
countess
bent
over
her
reticule
to
hide
her
agitated
face
.
Sonya
*NL*
embraced
Natasha
and
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
her
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
...
No
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
something
very
bad
for
me
?
What
is
it
?
''
persisted
Natasha
with
*NL*
her
quick
intuition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
sighed
and
made
no
reply
.
The
count
,
Petya
,
Madame
Schoss
,
Mavra
*NL*
Kuzminichna
,
and
Vasilich
came
into
the
drawing
room
and
,
having
closed
*NL*
the
doors
,
they
all
sat
down
and
remained
for
some
moments
silently
*NL*
seated
without
looking
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
was
the
first
to
rise
,
and
with
a
loud
sigh
crossed
himself
*NL*
before
the
icon
.
All
the
others
did
the
same
.
Then
the
count
embraced
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
and
Vasilich
,
who
were
to
remain
in
Moscow
,
and
while
*NL*
they
caught
at
his
hand
and
kissed
his
shoulder
he
patted
their
backs
*NL*
lightly
with
some
vaguely
affectionate
and
comforting
words
.
The
*NL*
countess
went
into
the
oratory
and
there
Sonya
found
her
on
her
knees
*NL*
before
the
icons
that
had
been
left
here
and
there
hanging
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
-LRB-
The
most
precious
ones
,
with
which
some
family
tradition
was
connected
,
*NL*
were
being
taken
with
them
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
porch
and
in
the
yard
the
men
whom
Petya
had
armed
with
swords
*NL*
and
daggers
,
with
trousers
tucked
inside
their
high
boots
and
with
belts
*NL*
and
girdles
tightened
,
were
taking
leave
of
those
remaining
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
always
the
case
at
a
departure
,
much
had
been
forgotten
or
put
in
*NL*
the
wrong
place
,
and
for
a
long
time
two
menservants
stood
one
on
each
*NL*
side
of
the
open
door
and
the
carriage
steps
waiting
to
help
the
*NL*
countess
in
,
while
maids
rushed
with
cushions
and
bundles
from
the
house
*NL*
to
the
carriages
,
the
caleche
,
the
phaeton
,
and
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
always
will
forget
everything
!
''
said
the
countess
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
*NL*
I
ca
n't
sit
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dunyasha
,
with
clenched
teeth
,
without
replying
but
with
an
*NL*
aggrieved
look
on
her
face
,
hastily
got
into
the
coach
to
rearrange
the
*NL*
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
those
servants
!
''
said
the
count
,
swaying
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Efim
,
the
old
coachman
,
who
was
the
only
one
the
countess
trusted
to
*NL*
drive
her
,
sat
perched
up
high
on
the
box
and
did
not
so
much
as
glance
*NL*
round
at
what
was
going
on
behind
him
.
From
thirty
years
'
experience
he
*NL*
knew
it
would
be
some
time
yet
before
the
order
,
``
Be
off
,
in
God
's
*NL*
name
!
''
would
be
given
him
:
and
he
knew
that
even
when
it
was
said
he
*NL*
would
be
stopped
once
or
twice
more
while
they
sent
back
to
fetch
*NL*
something
that
had
been
forgotten
,
and
even
after
that
he
would
again
be
*NL*
stopped
and
the
countess
herself
would
lean
out
of
the
window
and
beg
*NL*
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
drive
carefully
down
the
hill
.
He
knew
all
*NL*
this
and
therefore
waited
calmly
for
what
would
happen
,
with
more
*NL*
patience
than
the
horses
,
especially
the
near
one
,
the
chestnut
Falcon
,
*NL*
who
was
pawing
the
ground
and
champing
his
bit
.
At
last
all
were
seated
,
*NL*
the
carriage
steps
were
folded
and
pulled
up
,
the
door
was
shut
,
*NL*
somebody
was
sent
for
a
traveling
case
,
and
the
countess
leaned
out
and
*NL*
said
what
she
had
to
say
.
Then
Efim
deliberately
doffed
his
hat
and
*NL*
began
crossing
himself
.
The
postilion
and
all
the
other
servants
did
the
*NL*
same
.
``
Off
,
in
God
's
name
!
''
said
Efim
,
putting
on
his
hat
.
``
Start
!
''
The
*NL*
postilion
started
the
horses
,
the
off
pole
horse
tugged
at
his
collar
,
*NL*
the
high
springs
creaked
,
and
the
body
of
the
coach
swayed
.
The
footman
*NL*
sprang
onto
the
box
of
the
moving
coach
which
jolted
as
it
passed
out
of
*NL*
the
yard
onto
the
uneven
roadway
;
the
other
vehicles
jolted
in
their
*NL*
turn
,
and
the
procession
of
carriages
moved
up
the
street
.
In
the
*NL*
carriages
,
the
caleche
,
and
the
phaeton
,
all
crossed
themselves
as
they
*NL*
passed
the
church
opposite
the
house
.
Those
who
were
to
remain
in
Moscow
*NL*
walked
on
either
side
of
the
vehicles
seeing
the
travelers
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rarely
had
Natasha
experienced
so
joyful
a
feeling
as
now
,
sitting
in
*NL*
the
carriage
beside
the
countess
and
gazing
at
the
slowly
receding
walls
*NL*
of
forsaken
,
agitated
Moscow
.
Occasionally
she
leaned
out
of
the
*NL*
carriage
window
and
looked
back
and
then
forward
at
the
long
train
of
*NL*
wounded
in
front
of
them
.
Almost
at
the
head
of
the
line
she
could
see
*NL*
the
raised
hood
of
Prince
Andrew
's
caleche
.
She
did
not
know
who
was
in
*NL*
it
,
but
each
time
she
looked
at
the
procession
her
eyes
sought
that
*NL*
caleche
.
She
knew
it
was
right
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Kudrino
,
from
the
Nikitski
,
Presnya
,
and
Podnovinsk
Streets
came
*NL*
several
other
trains
of
vehicles
similar
to
the
Rostovs
'
,
and
as
they
*NL*
passed
along
the
Sadovaya
Street
the
carriages
and
carts
formed
two
rows
*NL*
abreast
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
going
round
the
Sukharev
water
tower
Natasha
,
who
was
*NL*
inquisitively
and
alertly
scrutinizing
the
people
driving
or
walking
*NL*
past
,
suddenly
cried
out
in
joyful
surprise
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
Mamma
,
Sonya
,
look
,
it
's
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Yes
,
on
my
word
,
it
's
Bezukhov
!
''
said
Natasha
,
putting
her
head
*NL*
out
of
the
carriage
and
staring
at
a
tall
,
stout
man
in
a
coachman
's
*NL*
long
coat
,
who
from
his
manner
of
walking
and
moving
was
evidently
a
*NL*
gentleman
in
disguise
,
and
who
was
passing
under
the
arch
of
the
*NL*
Sukharev
tower
accompanied
by
a
small
,
sallow-faced
,
beardless
old
man
*NL*
in
a
frieze
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
really
is
Bezukhov
in
a
coachman
's
coat
,
with
a
queer-looking
*NL*
old
boy
.
Really
,
''
said
Natasha
,
``
look
,
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
he
.
How
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
screamed
Natasha
,
``
I
'll
stake
my
head
it
's
he
!
I
assure
you
!
*NL*
Stop
,
stop
!
''
she
cried
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
coachman
could
not
stop
,
for
from
the
Meshchanski
Street
came
*NL*
more
carts
and
carriages
,
and
the
Rostovs
were
being
shouted
at
to
move
*NL*
on
and
not
block
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
however
,
though
now
much
farther
off
than
before
,
the
Rostovs
*NL*
all
saw
Pierre
--
or
someone
extraordinarily
like
him
--
in
a
coachman
's
*NL*
coat
,
going
down
the
street
with
head
bent
and
a
serious
face
beside
a
*NL*
small
,
beardless
old
man
who
looked
like
a
footman
.
That
old
man
noticed
*NL*
a
face
thrust
out
of
the
carriage
window
gazing
at
them
,
and
*NL*
respectfully
touching
Pierre
's
elbow
said
something
to
him
and
pointed
*NL*
to
the
carriage
.
Pierre
,
evidently
engrossed
in
thought
,
could
not
at
*NL*
first
understand
him
.
At
length
when
he
had
understood
and
looked
in
the
*NL*
direction
the
old
man
indicated
,
he
recognized
Natasha
,
and
following
*NL*
his
first
impulse
stepped
instantly
and
rapidly
toward
the
coach
.
But
*NL*
having
taken
a
dozen
steps
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
face
,
leaning
out
of
the
window
,
beamed
with
quizzical
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Kirilovich
,
come
here
!
We
have
recognized
you
!
This
is
*NL*
wonderful
!
''
she
cried
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
.
``
What
are
you
doing
?
*NL*
Why
are
you
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
her
outstretched
hand
and
kissed
it
awkwardly
as
he
walked
*NL*
along
beside
her
while
the
coach
still
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
Count
?
''
asked
the
countess
in
a
surprised
and
*NL*
commiserating
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
?
Why
?
Do
n't
ask
me
,
''
said
Pierre
,
and
looked
round
at
*NL*
Natasha
whose
radiant
,
happy
expression
--
of
which
he
was
conscious
*NL*
without
looking
at
her
--
filled
him
with
enchantment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
remaining
in
Moscow
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Moscow
?
''
he
said
in
a
questioning
tone
.
``
Yes
,
in
Moscow
.
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
only
I
were
a
man
!
I
'd
certainly
stay
with
you
.
How
splendid
!
''
*NL*
said
Natasha
.
``
Mamma
,
if
you
'll
let
me
,
I
'll
stay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
glanced
absently
at
Natasha
and
was
about
to
say
something
,
but
*NL*
the
countess
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
at
the
battle
,
we
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
,
''
Pierre
answered
.
``
There
will
be
another
battle
*NL*
tomorrow
...
''
he
began
,
but
Natasha
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
Count
?
You
are
not

yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
ask
me

do
n't
ask
me

I
do
n't
know
myself

Tomorrow

But
*NL*
no
!
Good-bye
,
good-by
!
''
he
muttered
.
``
It
's
an
awful
time
!
''
and
dropping
*NL*
behind
the
carriage
he
stepped
onto
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
continued
to
lean
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
time
,
beaming
at
*NL*
him
with
her
kindly
,
slightly
quizzical
,
happy
smile

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
two
days
,
ever
since
leaving
home
,
Pierre
had
been
living
*NL*
in
the
empty
house
of
his
deceased
benefactor
,
Bazdeev
.
This
is
how
it
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
woke
up
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
Moscow
and
his
*NL*
interview
with
Count
Rostopchin
,
he
could
not
for
some
time
make
out
*NL*
where
he
was
and
what
was
expected
of
him
.
When
he
was
informed
that
*NL*
among
others
awaiting
him
in
his
reception
room
there
was
a
Frenchman
*NL*
who
had
brought
a
letter
from
his
wife
,
the
Countess
Helene
,
he
felt
*NL*
suddenly
overcome
by
that
sense
of
confusion
and
hopelessness
to
which
*NL*
he
was
apt
to
succumb
.
He
felt
that
everything
was
now
at
an
end
,
all
*NL*
was
in
confusion
and
crumbling
to
pieces
,
that
nobody
was
right
or
*NL*
wrong
,
the
future
held
nothing
,
and
there
was
no
escape
from
this
*NL*
position
.
Smiling
unnaturally
and
muttering
to
himself
,
he
first
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
sofa
in
an
attitude
of
despair
,
then
rose
,
went
to
the
door
*NL*
of
the
reception
room
and
peeped
through
the
crack
,
returned
flourishing
*NL*
his
arms
,
and
took
up
a
book
.
His
major-domo
came
in
a
second
time
to
*NL*
say
that
the
Frenchman
who
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
countess
was
*NL*
very
anxious
to
see
him
if
only
for
a
minute
,
and
that
someone
from
*NL*
Bazdeev
's
widow
had
called
to
ask
Pierre
to
take
charge
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
books
,
as
she
herself
was
leaving
for
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
in
a
minute
;
wait
...
or
no
!
No
,
of
course
...
go
and
say
I
will
*NL*
come
directly
,
''
Pierre
replied
to
the
major-domo
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
the
man
had
left
the
room
Pierre
took
up
his
hat
which
*NL*
was
lying
on
the
table
and
went
out
of
his
study
by
the
other
door
.
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
passage
.
He
went
along
the
whole
length
of
this
*NL*
passage
to
the
stairs
and
,
frowning
and
rubbing
his
forehead
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
went
down
as
far
as
the
first
landing
.
The
hall
porter
was
*NL*
standing
at
the
front
door
.
From
the
landing
where
Pierre
stood
there
*NL*
was
a
second
staircase
leading
to
the
back
entrance
.
He
went
down
that
*NL*
staircase
and
out
into
the
yard
.
No
one
had
seen
him
.
But
there
were
*NL*
some
carriages
waiting
,
and
as
soon
as
Pierre
stepped
out
of
the
gate
*NL*
the
coachmen
and
the
yard
porter
noticed
him
and
raised
their
caps
to
*NL*
him
.
When
he
felt
he
was
being
looked
at
he
behaved
like
an
ostrich
*NL*
which
hides
its
head
in
a
bush
in
order
not
to
be
seen
:
he
hung
his
head
*NL*
and
quickening
his
pace
went
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
affairs
awaiting
Pierre
that
day
the
sorting
of
Joseph
*NL*
Bazdeev
's
books
and
papers
appeared
to
him
the
most
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hired
the
first
cab
he
met
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Patriarch
's
Ponds
,
where
the
widow
Bazdeev
's
house
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continually
turning
round
to
look
at
the
rows
of
loaded
carts
that
were
*NL*
making
their
way
from
all
sides
out
of
Moscow
,
and
balancing
his
bulky
*NL*
body
so
as
not
to
slip
out
of
the
ramshackle
old
vehicle
,
Pierre
,
*NL*
experiencing
the
joyful
feeling
of
a
boy
escaping
from
school
,
began
to
*NL*
talk
to
his
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
told
him
that
arms
were
being
distributed
today
at
the
Kremlin
*NL*
and
that
tomorrow
everyone
would
be
sent
out
beyond
the
Three
Hills
*NL*
gates
and
a
great
battle
would
be
fought
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
reached
the
Patriarch
's
Ponds
Pierre
found
the
Bazdeevs
'
house
,
*NL*
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
past
.
He
went
up
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
Gerasim
,
that
sallow
beardless
old
man
Pierre
had
seen
at
Torzhok
five
*NL*
years
before
with
Joseph
Bazdeev
,
came
out
in
answer
to
his
knock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
home
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Owing
to
the
present
state
of
things
Sophia
Danilovna
has
gone
to
the
*NL*
Torzhok
estate
with
the
children
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
in
all
the
same
,
I
have
to
look
through
the
books
,
''
said
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
good
as
to
step
in
.
Makar
Alexeevich
,
the
brother
of
my
late
*NL*
master
--
may
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
--
has
remained
here
,
but
he
is
*NL*
in
a
weak
state
as
you
know
,
''
said
the
old
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
knew
that
Makar
Alexeevich
was
Joseph
Bazdeev
's
half-insane
*NL*
brother
and
a
hard
drinker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
know
.
Let
us
go
in
...
''
said
Pierre
and
entered
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
,
bald-headed
old
man
with
a
red
nose
,
wearing
a
dressing
gown
and
*NL*
with
galoshes
on
his
bare
feet
,
stood
in
the
anteroom
.
On
seeing
Pierre
*NL*
he
muttered
something
angrily
and
went
away
along
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
very
clever
man
but
has
now
grown
quite
feeble
,
as
your
honor
*NL*
sees
,
''
said
Gerasim
.
``
Will
you
step
into
the
study
?
''
Pierre
nodded
.
``
As
*NL*
it
was
sealed
up
so
it
has
remained
,
but
Sophia
Danilovna
gave
orders
*NL*
that
if
anyone
should
come
from
you
they
were
to
have
the
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
into
that
gloomy
study
which
he
had
entered
with
such
*NL*
trepidation
in
his
benefactor
's
lifetime
.
The
room
,
dusty
and
untouched
*NL*
since
the
death
of
Joseph
Bazdeev
was
now
even
gloomier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
opened
one
of
the
shutters
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe
.
Pierre
*NL*
went
round
the
study
,
approached
the
cupboard
in
which
the
manuscripts
*NL*
were
kept
,
and
took
out
what
had
once
been
one
of
the
most
important
,
*NL*
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
order
.
This
was
the
authentic
Scotch
Acts
with
*NL*
Bazdeev
's
notes
and
explanations
.
He
sat
down
at
the
dusty
writing
*NL*
table
,
and
,
having
laid
the
manuscripts
before
him
,
opened
them
out
,
*NL*
closed
them
,
finally
pushed
them
away
,
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
*NL*
sank
into
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
looked
cautiously
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
Pierre
*NL*
always
sitting
in
the
same
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
two
hours
passed
and
Gerasim
took
the
liberty
of
making
a
*NL*
slight
noise
at
the
door
to
attract
his
attention
,
but
Pierre
did
not
*NL*
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
cabman
to
be
discharged
,
your
honor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
''
said
Pierre
,
rousing
himself
and
rising
hurriedly
.
``
Look
*NL*
here
,
''
he
added
,
taking
Gerasim
by
a
button
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
*NL*
at
the
old
man
with
moist
,
shining
,
and
ecstatic
eyes
,
``
I
say
,
do
you
*NL*
know
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
battle
tomorrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
heard
so
,
''
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
not
to
tell
anyone
who
I
am
,
and
to
do
what
I
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
''
replied
Gerasim
.
``
Will
you
have
something
to
*NL*
eat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
want
something
else
.
I
want
peasant
clothes
and
a
pistol
,
''
*NL*
said
Pierre
,
unexpectedly
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
,
''
said
Gerasim
after
thinking
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
rest
of
that
day
Pierre
spent
alone
in
his
benefactor
's
study
,
*NL*
and
Gerasim
heard
him
pacing
restlessly
from
one
corner
to
another
and
*NL*
talking
to
himself
.
And
he
spent
the
night
on
a
bed
made
up
for
him
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
,
being
a
servant
who
in
his
time
had
seen
many
strange
things
,
*NL*
accepted
Pierre
's
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
house
without
surprise
,
*NL*
and
seemed
pleased
to
have
someone
to
wait
on
.
That
same
evening
--
*NL*
without
even
asking
himself
what
they
were
wanted
for
--
he
procured
a
*NL*
coachman
's
coat
and
cap
for
Pierre
,
and
promised
to
get
him
the
pistol
*NL*
next
day
.
Makar
Alexeevich
came
twice
that
evening
shuffling
along
in
*NL*
his
galoshes
as
far
as
the
door
and
stopped
and
looked
ingratiatingly
at
*NL*
Pierre
.
But
as
soon
as
Pierre
turned
toward
him
he
wrapped
his
dressing
*NL*
gown
around
him
with
a
shamefaced
and
angry
look
and
hurried
away
.
It
*NL*
was
when
Pierre
-LRB-
wearing
the
coachman
's
coat
which
Gerasim
had
procured
*NL*
for
him
and
had
disinfected
by
steam
-RRB-
was
on
his
way
with
the
old
man
to
*NL*
buy
the
pistol
at
the
Sukharev
market
that
he
met
the
Rostovs
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
order
to
retreat
through
Moscow
to
the
Ryazan
road
was
issued
*NL*
at
night
on
the
first
of
September
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
troops
started
at
once
,
and
during
the
night
they
marched
*NL*
slowly
and
steadily
without
hurry
.
At
daybreak
,
however
,
those
nearing
*NL*
the
town
at
the
Dorogomilov
bridge
saw
ahead
of
them
masses
of
soldiers
*NL*
crowding
and
hurrying
across
the
bridge
,
ascending
on
the
opposite
side
*NL*
and
blocking
the
streets
and
alleys
,
while
endless
masses
of
troops
were
*NL*
bearing
down
on
them
from
behind
,
and
an
unreasoning
hurry
and
alarm
*NL*
overcame
them
.
They
all
rushed
forward
to
the
bridge
,
onto
it
,
and
to
*NL*
the
fords
and
the
boats
.
Kutuzov
himself
had
driven
round
by
side
*NL*
streets
to
the
other
side
of
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September
,
only
the
rear
*NL*
guard
remained
in
the
Dorogomilov
suburb
,
where
they
had
ample
room
.
The
*NL*
main
army
was
on
the
other
side
of
Moscow
or
beyond
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
very
time
,
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September
,
*NL*
Napoleon
was
standing
among
his
troops
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
looking
at
*NL*
the
panorama
spread
out
before
him
.
From
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
to
*NL*
the
second
of
September
,
that
is
from
the
battle
of
Borodino
to
the
*NL*
entry
of
the
French
into
Moscow
,
during
the
whole
of
that
agitating
,
*NL*
memorable
week
,
there
had
been
the
extraordinary
autumn
weather
that
*NL*
always
comes
as
a
surprise
,
when
the
sun
hangs
low
and
gives
more
heat
*NL*
than
in
spring
,
when
everything
shines
so
brightly
in
the
rare
clear
*NL*
atmosphere
that
the
eyes
smart
,
when
the
lungs
are
strengthened
and
*NL*
refreshed
by
inhaling
the
aromatic
autumn
air
,
when
even
the
nights
are
*NL*
warm
,
and
when
in
those
dark
warm
nights
,
golden
stars
startle
and
*NL*
delight
us
continually
by
falling
from
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September
this
weather
still
*NL*
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brightness
of
the
morning
was
magical
.
Moscow
seen
from
the
Poklonny
*NL*
Hill
lay
spaciously
spread
out
with
her
river
,
her
gardens
,
and
her
*NL*
churches
,
and
she
seemed
to
be
living
her
usual
life
,
her
cupolas
*NL*
glittering
like
stars
in
the
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
view
of
the
strange
city
with
its
peculiar
architecture
,
such
as
he
*NL*
had
never
seen
before
,
filled
Napoleon
with
the
rather
envious
and
*NL*
uneasy
curiosity
men
feel
when
they
see
an
alien
form
of
life
that
has
*NL*
no
knowledge
of
them
.
This
city
was
evidently
living
with
the
full
force
*NL*
of
its
own
life
.
By
the
indefinite
signs
which
,
even
at
a
distance
,
*NL*
distinguish
a
living
body
from
a
dead
one
,
Napoleon
from
the
Poklonny
*NL*
Hill
perceived
the
throb
of
life
in
the
town
and
felt
,
as
it
were
,
the
*NL*
breathing
of
that
great
and
beautiful
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
Russian
looking
at
Moscow
feels
her
to
be
a
mother
;
every
*NL*
foreigner
who
sees
her
,
even
if
ignorant
of
her
significance
as
the
*NL*
mother
city
,
must
feel
her
feminine
character
,
and
Napoleon
felt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cette
ville
asiatique
aux
innombrables

La
*NL*

cette
fameuse
ville

''
*
said
he
,
and
*NL*
dismounting
he
ordered
a
plan
of
Moscow
to
be
spread
out
before
him
,
and
*NL*
summoned
Lelorgne
d'Ideville
,
the
interpreter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
That
Asiatic
city
of
the
innumerable
churches

holy
Moscow

Here
it
*NL*
is
then
at

,
that
famous
city
.
It
was
high
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
town
captured
by
the
enemy
is
like
a
maid
who
has
lost
her
honor
,
''
*NL*
thought
he
-LRB-
he
had
said
so
to
Tuchkov
at
Smolensk
-RRB-
.
From
that
point
of
*NL*
view
he
gazed
at
the
Oriental
beauty
he
had
not
seen
before
.
It
seemed
*NL*
strange
to
him
that
his
long-felt
wish
,
which
had
seemed
unattainable
,
*NL*
had
at
last
been
realized
.
In
the
clear
morning
light
he
gazed
now
at
*NL*
the
city
and
now
at
the
plan
,
considering
its
details
,
and
the
assurance
*NL*
of
possessing
it
agitated
and
awed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
it
be
otherwise
?
''
he
thought
.
``
Here
is
this
capital
at
my
*NL*
feet
.
Where
is
Alexander
now
,
and
of
what
is
he
thinking
?
A
strange
,
*NL*
beautiful
,
and
majestic
city
;
and
a
strange
and
majestic
moment
!
In
what
*NL*
light
must
I
appear
to
them
!
''
thought
he
,
thinking
of
his
troops
.
``
Here
*NL*
she
is
,
the
reward
for
all
those
fainthearted
men
,
''
he
reflected
,
*NL*
glancing
at
those
near
him
and
at
the
troops
who
were
approaching
and
*NL*
forming
up
.
``
One
word
from
me
,
one
movement
of
my
hand
,
and
that
ancient
*NL*
capital
of
the
Tsars
would
perish
.
But
my
clemency
is
always
ready
to
*NL*
descend
upon
the
vanquished
.
I
must
be
magnanimous
and
truly
great
.
But
*NL*
no
,
it
ca
n't
be
true
that
I
am

he
suddenly
thought
.
``
Yet
*NL*
here
she
is
lying
at
my
feet
,
with
her
golden
domes
and
crosses
*NL*
scintillating
and
twinkling
in
the
sunshine
.
But
I
shall
spare
her
.
On
*NL*
the
ancient
monuments
of
barbarism
and
despotism
I
will
inscribe
great
*NL*
words
of
justice
and
mercy
...
It
is
just
this
which
Alexander
will
feel
*NL*
most
painfully
,
I
know
him
.
''
-LRB-
It
seemed
to
Napoleon
that
the
chief
*NL*
import
of
what
was
taking
place
lay
in
the
personal
struggle
between
*NL*
himself
and
Alexander
.
-RRB-
``
From
the
height
of
the
Kremlin
--
yes
,
there
is
*NL*
the
Kremlin

yes
--
I
will
give
them
just
laws
;
I
will
teach
them
the
*NL*
meaning
of
true
civilization
,
I
will
make
generations
of
boyars
remember
*NL*
their
conqueror
with
love

I
will
tell
the

that
I

I

and
I
shall
speak
to
them

I
always
do
:
*NL*
clearly
,
impressively
,
and
majestically

But
can
it
be
true
that

Moscow

there
she
lies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qu'on

said
he
to
his
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Bring
the
boyars
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
general
with
a
brilliant
suite
galloped
off
at
once
to
fetch
the
*NL*
boyars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
passed
.
Napoleon
had
lunched
and
was
again
standing
in
the
*NL*
same
place
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
awaiting
the
deputation
.
His
speech
to
*NL*
the
boyars
had
already
taken
definite
shape
in
his
imagination
.
That
*NL*
speech
was
full
of
dignity
and
greatness
as
Napoleon
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
himself
carried
away
by
the
tone
of
magnanimity
he
intended
to
*NL*
adopt
toward
Moscow
.
In
his
imagination
he
appointed
days
for
assemblies
*NL*
at
the
palace
of
the
Tsars
,
at
which
Russian
notables
and
his
own
would
*NL*
mingle
.
He
mentally
appointed
a
governor
,
one
who
would
win
the
hearts
*NL*
of
the
people
.
Having
learned
that
there
were
many
charitable
*NL*
institutions
in
Moscow
he
mentally
decided
that
he
would
shower
favors
*NL*
on
them
all
.
He
thought
that
,
as
in
Africa
he
had
to
put
on
a
burnoose
*NL*
and
sit
in
a
mosque
,
so
in
Moscow
he
must
be
beneficent
like
the
Tsars
.
*NL*
And
in
order
finally
to
touch
the
hearts
of
the
Russians
--
and
being
like
*NL*
all
Frenchmen
unable
to
imagine
anything
sentimental
without
a
reference
*NL*
to
ma
chere
,
ma
tendre
,
ma
pauvre
mere
*
--
he
decided
that
he
would
*NL*
place
an
inscription
on
all
these
establishments
in
large
letters
:
``
This
*NL*
establishment
is
dedicated
to
my
dear
mother
.
''
Or
no
,
it
should
be
*NL*
simply
:
Maison
de
ma
Mere
,
*
-LRB-

-RRB-
he
concluded
.
``
But
am
I
really
in
*NL*
Moscow
?
Yes
,
here
it
lies
before
me
,
but
why
is
the
deputation
from
the
*NL*
city
so
long
in
appearing
?
''
he
wondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
My
dear
,
my
tender
,
my
poor
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
-LRB-

-RRB-
``
House
of
my
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
an
agitated
consultation
was
being
carried
on
in
whispers
*NL*
among
his
generals
and
marshals
at
the
rear
of
his
suite
.
Those
sent
to
*NL*
fetch
the
deputation
had
returned
with
the
news
that
Moscow
was
empty
,
*NL*
that
everyone
had
left
it
.
The
faces
of
those
who
were
not
conferring
*NL*
together
were
pale
and
perturbed
.
They
were
not
alarmed
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
Moscow
had
been
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
-LRB-
grave
as
that
fact
*NL*
seemed
-RRB-
,
but
by
the
question
how
to
tell
the
Emperor
--
without
putting
*NL*
him
in
the
terrible
position
of
appearing
ridiculous
--
that
he
had
been
*NL*
awaiting
the
boyars
so
long
in
vain
:
that
there
were
drunken
mobs
left
*NL*
in
Moscow
but
no
one
else
.
Some
said
that
a
deputation
of
some
sort
must
*NL*
be
scraped
together
,
others
disputed
that
opinion
and
maintained
that
*NL*
the
Emperor
should
first
be
carefully
and
skillfully
prepared
,
and
then
*NL*
told
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
have
to
be
told
,
all
the
same
,
''
said
some
gentlemen
of
the
*NL*
suite
.
``
But
,
gentlemen
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
was
the
more
awkward
because
the
Emperor
,
meditating
upon
*NL*
his
magnanimous
plans
,
was
pacing
patiently
up
and
down
before
the
*NL*
outspread
map
,
occasionally
glancing
along
the
road
to
Moscow
from
under
*NL*
his
lifted
hand
with
a
bright
and
proud
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
impossible
...
''
declared
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite
,
shrugging
*NL*
their
shoulders
but
not
venturing
to
utter
the
implied
word
--
le
*NL*
ridicule
...
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Emperor
,
tired
of
futile
expectation
,
his
actor
's
instinct
*NL*
suggesting
to
him
that
the
sublime
moment
having
been
too
long
drawn
out
*NL*
was
beginning
to
lose
its
sublimity
,
gave
a
sign
with
his
hand
.
A
single
*NL*
report
of
a
signaling
gun
followed
,
and
the
troops
,
who
were
already
*NL*
spread
out
on
different
sides
of
Moscow
,
moved
into
the
city
through
*NL*
Tver
,
Kaluga
,
and
Dorogomilov
gates
.
Faster
and
faster
,
vying
with
one
*NL*
another
,
they
moved
at
the
double
or
at
a
trot
,
vanishing
amid
the
*NL*
clouds
of
dust
they
raised
and
making
the
air
ring
with
a
deafening
roar
*NL*
of
mingling
shouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drawn
on
by
the
movement
of
his
troops
Napoleon
rode
with
them
as
far
as
*NL*
the
Dorogomilov
gate
,
but
there
again
stopped
and
,
dismounting
from
his
*NL*
horse
,
paced
for
a
long
time
by
the
Kammer-Kollezski
rampart
,
awaiting
*NL*
the
deputation
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Moscow
was
empty
.
There
were
still
people
in
it
,
perhaps
a
*NL*
fiftieth
part
of
its
former
inhabitants
had
remained
,
but
it
was
empty
.
*NL*
It
was
empty
in
the
sense
that
a
dying
queenless
hive
is
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
queenless
hive
no
life
is
left
though
to
a
superficial
glance
it
*NL*
seems
as
much
alive
as
other
hives
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bees
circle
round
a
queenless
hive
in
the
hot
beams
of
the
midday
*NL*
sun
as
gaily
as
around
the
living
hives
;
from
a
distance
it
smells
of
*NL*
honey
like
the
others
,
and
bees
fly
in
and
out
in
the
same
way
.
But
one
*NL*
has
only
to
observe
that
hive
to
realize
that
there
is
no
longer
any
*NL*
life
in
it
.
The
bees
do
not
fly
in
the
same
way
,
the
smell
and
the
sound
*NL*
that
meet
the
beekeeper
are
not
the
same
.
To
the
beekeeper
's
tap
on
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
sick
hive
,
instead
of
the
former
instant
unanimous
humming
*NL*
of
tens
of
thousands
of
bees
with
their
abdomens
threateningly
*NL*
compressed
,
and
producing
by
the
rapid
vibration
of
their
wings
an
*NL*
aerial
living
sound
,
the
only
reply
is
a
disconnected
buzzing
from
*NL*
different
parts
of
the
deserted
hive
.
From
the
alighting
board
,
instead
*NL*
of
the
former
spirituous
fragrant
smell
of
honey
and
venom
,
and
the
warm
*NL*
whiffs
of
crowded
life
,
comes
an
odor
of
emptiness
and
decay
mingling
*NL*
with
the
smell
of
honey
.
There
are
no
longer
sentinels
sounding
the
*NL*
alarm
with
their
abdomens
raised
,
and
ready
to
die
in
defense
of
the
*NL*
hive
.
There
is
no
longer
the
measured
quiet
sound
of
throbbing
activity
,
*NL*
like
the
sound
of
boiling
water
,
but
diverse
discordant
sounds
of
*NL*
disorder
.
In
and
out
of
the
hive
long
black
robber
bees
smeared
with
*NL*
honey
fly
timidly
and
shiftily
.
They
do
not
sting
,
but
crawl
away
from
*NL*
danger
.
Formerly
only
bees
laden
with
honey
flew
into
the
hive
,
and
they
*NL*
flew
out
empty
;
now
they
fly
out
laden
.
The
beekeeper
opens
the
lower
*NL*
part
of
the
hive
and
peers
in
.
Instead
of
black
,
glossy
bees
--
tamed
by
*NL*
toil
,
clinging
to
one
another
's
legs
and
drawing
out
the
wax
,
with
a
*NL*
ceaseless
hum
of
labor
--
that
used
to
hang
in
long
clusters
down
to
the
*NL*
floor
of
the
hive
,
drowsy
shriveled
bees
crawl
about
separately
in
*NL*
various
directions
on
the
floor
and
walls
of
the
hive
.
Instead
of
a
*NL*
neatly
glued
floor
,
swept
by
the
bees
with
the
fanning
of
their
wings
,
*NL*
there
is
a
floor
littered
with
bits
of
wax
,
excrement
,
dying
bees
*NL*
scarcely
moving
their
legs
,
and
dead
ones
that
have
not
been
cleared
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beekeeper
opens
the
upper
part
of
the
hive
and
examines
the
super
.
*NL*
Instead
of
serried
rows
of
bees
sealing
up
every
gap
in
the
combs
and
*NL*
keeping
the
brood
warm
,
he
sees
the
skillful
complex
structures
of
the
*NL*
combs
,
but
no
longer
in
their
former
state
of
purity
.
All
is
neglected
*NL*
and
foul
.
Black
robber
bees
are
swiftly
and
stealthily
prowling
about
*NL*
the
combs
,
and
the
short
home
bees
,
shriveled
and
listless
as
if
they
*NL*
were
old
,
creep
slowly
about
without
trying
to
hinder
the
robbers
,
*NL*
having
lost
all
motive
and
all
sense
of
life
.
Drones
,
bumblebees
,
wasps
,
*NL*
and
butterflies
knock
awkwardly
against
the
walls
of
the
hive
in
their
*NL*
flight
.
Here
and
there
among
the
cells
containing
dead
brood
and
honey
*NL*
an
angry
buzzing
can
sometimes
be
heard
.
Here
and
there
a
couple
of
*NL*
bees
,
by
force
of
habit
and
custom
cleaning
out
the
brood
cells
,
with
*NL*
efforts
beyond
their
strength
laboriously
drag
away
a
dead
bee
or
*NL*
bumblebee
without
knowing
why
they
do
it
.
In
another
corner
two
old
bees
*NL*
are
languidly
fighting
,
or
cleaning
themselves
,
or
feeding
one
another
,
*NL*
without
themselves
knowing
whether
they
do
it
with
friendly
or
hostile
*NL*
intent
.
In
a
third
place
a
crowd
of
bees
,
crushing
one
another
,
attack
*NL*
some
victim
and
fight
and
smother
it
,
and
the
victim
,
enfeebled
or
*NL*
killed
,
drops
from
above
slowly
and
lightly
as
a
feather
,
among
the
heap
*NL*
of
corpses
.
The
keeper
opens
the
two
center
partitions
to
examine
the
*NL*
brood
cells
.
In
place
of
the
former
close
dark
circles
formed
by
*NL*
thousands
of
bees
sitting
back
to
back
and
guarding
the
high
mystery
of
*NL*
generation
,
he
sees
hundreds
of
dull
,
listless
,
and
sleepy
shells
of
*NL*
bees
.
They
have
almost
all
died
unawares
,
sitting
in
the
sanctuary
they
*NL*
had
guarded
and
which
is
now
no
more
.
They
reek
of
decay
and
death
.
Only
*NL*
a
few
of
them
still
move
,
rise
,
and
feebly
fly
to
settle
on
the
enemy
's
*NL*
hand
,
lacking
the
spirit
to
die
stinging
him
;
the
rest
are
dead
and
fall
*NL*
as
lightly
as
fish
scales
.
The
beekeeper
closes
the
hive
,
chalks
a
mark
*NL*
on
it
,
and
when
he
has
time
tears
out
its
contents
and
burns
it
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
the
same
way
Moscow
was
empty
when
Napoleon
,
weary
,
uneasy
,
and
*NL*
morose
,
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
Kammer-Kollezski
rampart
,
*NL*
awaiting
what
to
his
mind
was
a
necessary
,
if
but
formal
,
observance
of
*NL*
the
proprieties
--
a
deputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
various
corners
of
Moscow
there
still
remained
a
few
people
aimlessly
*NL*
moving
about
,
following
their
old
habits
and
hardly
aware
of
what
they
*NL*
were
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
with
due
circumspection
Napoleon
was
informed
that
Moscow
was
*NL*
empty
,
he
looked
angrily
at
his
informant
,
turned
away
,
and
silently
*NL*
continued
to
walk
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
carriage
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
seat
beside
the
aide-de-camp
on
duty
and
drove
into
the
*NL*
suburb
.
``
Moscow
deserted
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
What
an
incredible
*NL*
event
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
drive
into
the
town
,
but
put
up
at
an
inn
in
the
Dorogomilov
*NL*
suburb
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coup
de
theatre
had
not
come
off

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
troops
were
passing
through
Moscow
from
two
o'clock
at
night
*NL*
till
two
in
the
afternoon
and
bore
away
with
them
the
wounded
and
the
*NL*
last
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
leaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
crush
during
the
movement
of
the
troops
took
place
at
the
*NL*
Stone
,
Moskva
,
and
Yauza
bridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
troops
,
dividing
into
two
parts
when
passing
around
the
*NL*
Kremlin
,
were
thronging
the
Moskva
and
the
Stone
bridges
,
a
great
many
*NL*
soldiers
,
taking
advantage
of
the
stoppage
and
congestion
,
turned
back
*NL*
from
the
bridges
and
slipped
stealthily
and
silently
past
the
church
of
*NL*
Vasili
the
Beatified
and
under
the
Borovitski
gate
,
back
up
the
hill
to
*NL*
the
Red
Square
where
some
instinct
told
them
they
could
easily
take
*NL*
things
not
belonging
to
them
.
Crowds
of
the
kind
seen
at
cheap
sales
*NL*
filled
all
the
passages
and
alleys
of
the
Bazaar
.
But
there
were
no
*NL*
dealers
with
voices
of
ingratiating
affability
inviting
customers
to
*NL*
enter
;
there
were
no
hawkers
,
nor
the
usual
motley
crowd
of
female
*NL*
purchasers
--
but
only
soldiers
,
in
uniforms
and
overcoats
though
without
*NL*
muskets
,
entering
the
Bazaar
empty-handed
and
silently
making
their
way
*NL*
out
through
its
passages
with
bundles
.
Tradesmen
and
their
assistants
*NL*
-LRB-
of
whom
there
were
but
few
-RRB-
moved
about
among
the
soldiers
quite
*NL*
bewildered
.
They
unlocked
their
shops
and
locked
them
up
again
,
and
*NL*
themselves
carried
goods
away
with
the
help
of
their
assistants
.
On
the
*NL*
square
in
front
of
the
Bazaar
were
drummers
beating
the
muster
call
.
But
*NL*
the
roll
of
the
drums
did
not
make
the
looting
soldiers
run
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
drum
as
formerly
,
but
made
them
,
on
the
contrary
,
run
*NL*
farther
away
.
Among
the
soldiers
in
the
shops
and
passages
some
men
were
*NL*
to
be
seen
in
gray
coats
,
with
closely
shaven
heads
.
Two
officers
,
one
*NL*
with
a
scarf
over
his
uniform
and
mounted
on
a
lean
,
dark-gray
horse
,
*NL*
the
other
in
an
overcoat
and
on
foot
,
stood
at
the
corner
of
Ilyinka
*NL*
Street
,
talking
.
A
third
officer
galloped
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
general
orders
them
all
to
be
driven
out
at
once
,
without
fail
.
*NL*
This
is
outrageous
!
Half
the
men
have
dispersed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
...
Where
?
...
''
he
shouted
to
three
infantrymen
*NL*
without
muskets
who
,
holding
up
the
skirts
of
their
overcoats
,
were
*NL*
slipping
past
him
into
the
Bazaar
passage
.
``
Stop
,
you
rascals
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
are
you
going
to
stop
them
?
''
replied
another
officer
.
``
There
is
*NL*
no
getting
them
together
.
The
army
should
push
on
before
the
rest
bolt
,
*NL*
that
's
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
one
push
on
?
They
are
stuck
there
,
wedged
on
the
bridge
,
and
*NL*
do
n't
move
.
Should
n't
we
put
a
cordon
round
to
prevent
the
rest
from
*NL*
running
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
go
in
there
and
drive
them
out
!
''
shouted
the
senior
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
in
the
scarf
dismounted
,
called
up
a
drummer
,
and
went
with
*NL*
him
into
the
arcade
.
Some
soldiers
started
running
away
in
a
group
.
A
*NL*
shopkeeper
with
red
pimples
on
his
cheeks
near
the
nose
,
and
a
calm
,
*NL*
persistent
,
calculating
expression
on
his
plump
face
,
hurriedly
and
*NL*
ostentatiously
approached
the
officer
,
swinging
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
!
''
said
he
.
``
Be
so
good
as
to
protect
us
!
We
wo
n't
grudge
*NL*
trifles
,
you
are
welcome
to
anything
--
we
shall
be
delighted
!
Pray
!
...
*NL*
I
'll
fetch
a
piece
of
cloth
at
once
for
such
an
honorable
gentleman
,
or
*NL*
even
two
pieces
with
pleasure
.
For
we
feel
how
it
is
;
but
what
's
all
*NL*
this
--
sheer
robbery
!
If
you
please
,
could
not
guards
be
placed
if
only
*NL*
to
let
us
close
the
shop
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
shopkeepers
crowded
round
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
what
twaddle
!
''
said
one
of
them
,
a
thin
,
stern-looking
man
.
``
When
*NL*
one
's
head
is
gone
one
does
n't
weep
for
one
's
hair
!
Take
what
any
of
you
*NL*
like
!
''
And
flourishing
his
arm
energetically
he
turned
sideways
to
the
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
,
Ivan
Sidorych
,
to
talk
,
''
said
the
first
*NL*
tradesman
angrily
.
``
Please
step
inside
,
your
honor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
indeed
!
''
cried
the
thin
one
.
``
In
my
three
shops
here
I
have
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
rubles
'
worth
of
goods
.
Can
they
be
saved
when
the
army
*NL*
has
gone
?
Eh
,
what
people
!
`
Against
God
's
might
our
hands
ca
n't
fight
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
inside
,
your
honor
!
''
repeated
the
tradesman
,
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
stood
perplexed
and
his
face
showed
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
my
business
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
and
strode
on
quickly
down
one
of
*NL*
the
passages
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
one
open
shop
came
the
sound
of
blows
and
vituperation
,
and
just
as
*NL*
the
officer
came
up
to
it
a
man
in
a
gray
coat
with
a
shaven
head
was
*NL*
flung
out
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
,
bent
double
,
rushed
past
the
tradesman
and
the
officer
.
The
*NL*
officer
pounced
on
the
soldiers
who
were
in
the
shops
,
but
at
that
*NL*
moment
fearful
screams
reached
them
from
the
huge
crowd
on
the
Moskva
*NL*
bridge
and
the
officer
ran
out
into
the
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
but
his
comrade
was
already
*NL*
galloping
off
past
Vasili
the
Beatified
in
the
direction
from
which
the
*NL*
screams
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
after
him
.
When
he
reached
the
*NL*
bridge
he
saw
two
unlimbered
guns
,
the
infantry
crossing
the
bridge
,
*NL*
several
overturned
carts
,
and
frightened
and
laughing
faces
among
the
*NL*
troops
.
Beside
the
cannon
a
cart
was
standing
to
which
two
horses
were
*NL*
harnessed
.
Four
borzois
with
collars
were
pressing
close
to
the
wheels
.
*NL*
The
cart
was
loaded
high
,
and
at
the
very
top
,
beside
a
child
's
chair
*NL*
with
its
legs
in
the
air
,
sat
a
peasant
woman
uttering
piercing
and
*NL*
desperate
shrieks
.
He
was
told
by
his
fellow
officers
that
the
screams
*NL*
of
the
crowd
and
the
shrieks
of
the
woman
were
due
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
General
Ermolov
,
coming
up
to
the
crowd
and
learning
that
soldiers
were
*NL*
dispersing
among
the
shops
while
crowds
of
civilians
blocked
the
bridge
,
*NL*
had
ordered
two
guns
to
be
unlimbered
and
made
a
show
of
firing
at
the
*NL*
bridge
.
The
crowd
,
crushing
one
another
,
upsetting
carts
,
and
shouting
*NL*
and
squeezing
desperately
,
had
cleared
off
the
bridge
and
the
troops
*NL*
were
now
moving
forward
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
city
itself
was
deserted
.
There
was
hardly
anyone
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
The
gates
and
shops
were
all
closed
,
only
here
and
there
round
*NL*
the
taverns
solitary
shouts
or
drunken
songs
could
be
heard
.
Nobody
*NL*
drove
through
the
streets
and
footsteps
were
rarely
heard
.
The
*NL*
Povarskaya
was
quite
still
and
deserted
.
The
huge
courtyard
of
the
*NL*
Rostovs
'
house
was
littered
with
wisps
of
hay
and
with
dung
from
the
*NL*
horses
,
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
there
.
In
the
great
drawing
room
*NL*
of
the
house
,
which
had
been
left
with
all
it
contained
,
were
two
*NL*
people
.
They
were
the
yard
porter
Ignat
,
and
the
page
boy
Mishka
,
*NL*
Vasilich
's
grandson
who
had
stayed
in
Moscow
with
his
grandfather
.
*NL*
Mishka
had
opened
the
clavichord
and
was
strumming
on
it
with
one
*NL*
finger
.
The
yard
porter
,
his
arms
akimbo
,
stood
smiling
with
*NL*
satisfaction
before
the
large
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
fine
,
eh
,
Uncle
Ignat
?
''
said
the
boy
,
suddenly
beginning
to
*NL*
strike
the
keyboard
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fancy
!
''
answered
Ignat
,
surprised
at
the
broadening
grin
on
his
*NL*
face
in
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impudence
!
Impudence
!
''
they
heard
behind
them
the
voice
of
Mavra
*NL*
Kuzminichna
who
had
entered
silently
.
``
How
he
's
grinning
,
the
fat
mug
!
*NL*
Is
that
what
you
're
here
for
?
Nothing
's
cleared
away
down
there
and
*NL*
Vasilich
is
worn
out
.
Just
you
wait
a
bit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ignat
left
off
smiling
,
adjusted
his
belt
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
with
*NL*
meekly
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
,
I
did
it
gently
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
something
gently
,
you
monkey
you
!
''
cried
Mavra
*NL*
Kuzminichna
,
raising
her
arm
threateningly
.
``
Go
and
get
the
samovar
to
*NL*
boil
for
your
grandfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
flicked
the
dust
off
the
clavichord
and
closed
it
,
and
*NL*
with
a
deep
sigh
left
the
drawing
room
and
locked
its
main
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
out
into
the
yard
she
paused
to
consider
where
she
should
go
next
-
*NL*
-
to
drink
tea
in
the
servants
'
wing
with
Vasilich
,
or
into
the
storeroom
*NL*
to
put
away
what
still
lay
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
in
the
quiet
street
.
Someone
*NL*
stopped
at
the
gate
,
and
the
latch
rattled
as
someone
tried
to
open
it
.
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
went
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
--
Count
Ilya
Andreevich
Rostov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
officer
,
I
have
to
see
him
,
''
came
the
reply
in
a
pleasant
,
well-bred
*NL*
Russian
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
opened
the
gate
and
an
officer
of
eighteen
,
with
the
*NL*
round
face
of
a
Rostov
,
entered
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
away
,
sir
.
Went
away
yesterday
at
vespertime
,
''
said
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
cordially
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
standing
in
the
gateway
,
as
if
hesitating
whether
to
*NL*
enter
or
not
,
clicked
his
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
annoying
!
''
he
muttered
.
``
I
should
have
come
yesterday
...
Ah
,
*NL*
what
a
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Mavra
Kuzminichna
was
attentively
and
sympathetically
*NL*
examining
the
familiar
Rostov
features
of
the
young
man
's
face
,
his
*NL*
tattered
coat
and
trodden-down
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
want
to
see
the
count
for
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
...
it
ca
n't
be
helped
!
''
said
he
in
a
tone
of
vexation
and
*NL*
placed
his
hand
on
the
gate
as
if
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
paused
in
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
suddenly
said
,
``
I
am
a
kinsman
of
the
count
's
and
he
has
*NL*
been
very
kind
to
me
.
As
you
see
''
-LRB-
he
glanced
with
an
amused
air
and
*NL*
good-natured
smile
at
his
coat
and
boots
-RRB-
``
my
things
are
worn
out
and
I
*NL*
have
no
money
,
so
I
was
going
to
ask
the
count

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
did
not
let
him
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
wait
a
minute
,
sir
.
One
little
moment
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
soon
as
the
officer
let
go
of
the
gate
handle
she
turned
and
,
*NL*
hurrying
away
on
her
old
legs
,
went
through
the
back
yard
to
the
*NL*
servants
'
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mavra
Kuzminichna
was
running
to
her
room
the
officer
walked
about
*NL*
the
yard
gazing
at
his
worn-out
boots
with
lowered
head
and
a
faint
*NL*
smile
on
his
lips
.
``
What
a
pity
I
've
missed
Uncle
!
What
a
nice
old
*NL*
woman
!
Where
has
she
run
off
to
?
And
how
am
I
to
find
the
nearest
way
to
*NL*
overtake
my
regiment
,
which
must
by
now
be
getting
near
the
Rogozhski
*NL*
gate
?
''
thought
he
.
Just
then
Mavra
Kuzminichna
appeared
from
behind
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
house
with
a
frightened
yet
resolute
look
,
carrying
a
*NL*
rolled-up
check
kerchief
in
her
hand
.
While
still
a
few
steps
from
the
*NL*
officer
she
unfolded
the
kerchief
and
took
out
of
it
a
white
twenty
-
*NL*
five-ruble
assignat
and
hastily
handed
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
his
excellency
had
been
at
home
,
as
a
kinsman
he
would
of
course
...
*NL*
but
as
it
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mavra
Kuzminichna
grew
abashed
and
confused
.
The
officer
did
not
*NL*
decline
,
but
took
the
note
quietly
and
thanked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
count
had
been
at
home
...
''
Mavra
Kuzminichna
went
on
*NL*
apologetically
.
``
Christ
be
with
you
,
sir
!
May
God
preserve
you
!
''
said
*NL*
she
,
bowing
as
she
saw
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swaying
his
head
and
smiling
as
if
amused
at
himself
,
the
officer
ran
*NL*
almost
at
a
trot
through
the
deserted
streets
toward
the
Yauza
bridge
to
*NL*
overtake
his
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mavra
Kuzminichna
stood
at
the
closed
gate
for
some
time
with
moist
*NL*
eyes
,
pensively
swaying
her
head
and
feeling
an
unexpected
flow
of
*NL*
motherly
tenderness
and
pity
for
the
unknown
young
officer
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
From
an
unfinished
house
on
the
Varvarka
,
the
ground
floor
of
which
was
*NL*
a
dramshop
,
came
drunken
shouts
and
songs
.
On
benches
round
the
tables
*NL*
in
a
dirty
little
room
sat
some
ten
factory
hands
.
Tipsy
and
perspiring
,
*NL*
with
dim
eyes
and
wide-open
mouths
,
they
were
all
laboriously
singing
*NL*
some
song
or
other
.
They
were
singing
discordantly
,
arduously
,
and
with
*NL*
great
effort
,
evidently
not
because
they
wished
to
sing
,
but
because
*NL*
they
wanted
to
show
they
were
drunk
and
on
a
spree
.
One
,
a
tall
,
fair
-
*NL*
haired
lad
in
a
clean
blue
coat
,
was
standing
over
the
others
.
His
face
*NL*
with
its
fine
straight
nose
would
have
been
handsome
had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
his
thin
,
compressed
,
twitching
lips
and
dull
,
gloomy
,
fixed
eyes
.
*NL*
Evidently
possessed
by
some
idea
,
he
stood
over
those
who
were
singing
,
*NL*
and
solemnly
and
jerkily
flourished
above
their
heads
his
white
arm
with
*NL*
the
sleeve
turned
up
to
the
elbow
,
trying
unnaturally
to
spread
out
his
*NL*
dirty
fingers
.
The
sleeve
of
his
coat
kept
slipping
down
and
he
always
*NL*
carefully
rolled
it
up
again
with
his
left
hand
,
as
if
it
were
most
*NL*
important
that
the
sinewy
white
arm
he
was
flourishing
should
be
bare
.
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
song
cries
were
heard
,
and
fighting
and
blows
in
the
*NL*
passage
and
porch
.
The
tall
lad
waved
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
it
!
''
he
exclaimed
peremptorily
.
``
There
's
a
fight
,
lads
!
''
And
,
*NL*
still
rolling
up
his
sleeve
,
he
went
out
to
the
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
factory
hands
followed
him
.
These
men
,
who
under
the
leadership
of
*NL*
the
tall
lad
were
drinking
in
the
dramshop
that
morning
,
had
brought
the
*NL*
publican
some
skins
from
the
factory
and
for
this
had
had
drink
served
*NL*
them
.
The
blacksmiths
from
a
neighboring
smithy
,
hearing
the
sounds
of
*NL*
revelry
in
the
tavern
and
supposing
it
to
have
been
broken
into
,
wished
*NL*
to
force
their
way
in
too
and
a
fight
in
the
porch
had
resulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
publican
was
fighting
one
of
the
smiths
at
the
door
,
and
when
the
*NL*
workmen
came
out
the
smith
,
wrenching
himself
free
from
the
tavern
*NL*
keeper
,
fell
face
downward
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
smith
tried
to
enter
the
doorway
,
pressing
against
the
publican
*NL*
with
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
with
the
turned-up
sleeve
gave
the
smith
a
blow
in
the
face
and
*NL*
cried
wildly
:
``
They
're
fighting
us
,
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
first
smith
got
up
and
,
scratching
his
bruised
face
*NL*
to
make
it
bleed
,
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
:
``
Police
!
Murder
!
...
*NL*
They
've
killed
a
man
,
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
gracious
me
,
a
man
beaten
to
death
--
killed
!
...
''
screamed
a
woman
*NL*
coming
out
of
a
gate
close
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
gathered
round
the
bloodstained
smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
robbed
people
enough
--
taking
their
last
shirts
?
''
said
a
*NL*
voice
addressing
the
publican
.
``
What
have
you
killed
a
man
for
,
you
*NL*
thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
lad
,
standing
in
the
porch
,
turned
his
bleared
eyes
from
the
*NL*
publican
to
the
smith
and
back
again
as
if
considering
whom
he
ought
to
*NL*
fight
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murderer
!
''
he
shouted
suddenly
to
the
publican
.
``
Bind
him
,
lads
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
you
would
like
to
bind
me
!
''
shouted
the
publican
,
pushing
*NL*
away
the
men
advancing
on
him
,
and
snatching
his
cap
from
his
head
he
*NL*
flung
it
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
this
action
had
some
mysterious
and
menacing
significance
,
the
*NL*
workmen
surrounding
the
publican
paused
in
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
law
very
well
,
mates
!
I
'll
take
the
matter
to
the
captain
of
*NL*
police
.
You
think
I
wo
n't
get
to
him
?
Robbery
is
not
permitted
to
*NL*
anybody
now
a
days
!
''
shouted
the
publican
,
picking
up
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
then
!
Come
along
then
!
''
the
publican
and
the
tall
young
*NL*
fellow
repeated
one
after
the
other
,
and
they
moved
up
the
street
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bloodstained
smith
went
beside
them
.
The
factory
hands
and
others
*NL*
followed
behind
,
talking
and
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
the
Moroseyka
,
opposite
a
large
house
with
closed
*NL*
shutters
and
bearing
a
bootmaker
's
signboard
,
stood
a
score
of
thin
,
*NL*
worn-out
,
gloomy-faced
bootmakers
,
wearing
overalls
and
long
tattered
*NL*
coats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
pay
folks
off
properly
,
''
a
thin
workingman
,
with
frowning
*NL*
brows
and
a
straggly
beard
,
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
's
sucked
our
blood
and
now
he
thinks
he
's
quit
of
us
.
He
's
been
*NL*
misleading
us
all
the
week
and
now
that
he
's
brought
us
to
this
pass
*NL*
he
's
made
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
the
crowd
and
the
bloodstained
man
the
workman
ceased
*NL*
speaking
,
and
with
eager
curiosity
all
the
bootmakers
joined
the
moving
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
all
the
folks
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
the
police
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
is
it
true
that
we
have
been
beaten
?
''
``
And
what
did
you
think
?
*NL*
Look
what
folks
are
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Questions
and
answers
were
heard
.
The
publican
,
taking
advantage
of
the
*NL*
increased
crowd
,
dropped
behind
and
returned
to
his
tavern
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
youth
,
not
noticing
the
disappearance
of
his
foe
,
waved
his
*NL*
bare
arm
and
went
on
talking
incessantly
,
attracting
general
attention
*NL*
to
himself
.
It
was
around
him
that
the
people
chiefly
crowded
,
expecting
*NL*
answers
from
him
to
the
questions
that
occupied
all
their
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
keep
order
,
keep
the
law
,
that
's
what
the
government
is
there
*NL*
for
.
Am
I
not
right
,
good
Christians
?
''
said
the
tall
youth
,
with
a
*NL*
scarcely
perceptible
smile
.
``
He
thinks
there
's
no
government
!
How
can
*NL*
one
do
without
government
?
Or
else
there
would
be
plenty
who
'd
rob
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
talk
nonsense
?
''
rejoined
voices
in
the
crowd
.
``
Will
they
give
up
*NL*
Moscow
like
this
?
They
told
you
that
for
fun
,
and
you
believed
it
!
*NL*
Are
n't
there
plenty
of
troops
on
the
march
?
Let
him
in
,
indeed
!
That
's
*NL*
what
the
government
is
for
.
You
'd
better
listen
to
what
people
are
*NL*
saying
,
''
said
some
of
the
mob
pointing
to
the
tall
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
wall
of
China-Town
a
smaller
group
of
people
were
gathered
round
*NL*
a
man
in
a
frieze
coat
who
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
ukase
,
they
are
reading
an
ukase
!
Reading
an
ukase
!
''
cried
voices
in
*NL*
the
crowd
,
and
the
people
rushed
toward
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
frieze
coat
was
reading
the
broadsheet
of
August
31
.
When
*NL*
the
crowd
collected
round
him
he
seemed
confused
,
but
at
the
demand
of
*NL*
the
tall
lad
who
had
pushed
his
way
up
to
him
,
he
began
in
a
rather
*NL*
tremulous
voice
to
read
the
sheet
from
the
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Early
tomorrow
I
shall
go
to
his
Serene
Highness
,
''
he
read
-LRB-
``
Sirin
*NL*
Highness

''
said
the
tall
fellow
with
a
triumphant
smile
on
his
lips
and
*NL*
a
frown
on
his
brow
-RRB-
,
``
to
consult
with
him
to
act
,
and
to
aid
the
army
*NL*
to
exterminate
these
scoundrels
.
We
too
will
take
part
...
''
the
reader
*NL*
went
on
,
and
then
paused
-LRB-
``
Do
you
see
,
''
shouted
the
youth
victoriously
,
*NL*
``
he
's
going
to
clear
up
the
whole
affair
for
you

-RRB-
,
``

them

dinner

'll
set
to

We
will
do

completely
do

undo
these
*NL*
scoundrels

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
were
read
out
in
the
midst
of
complete
silence
.
The
tall
*NL*
lad
hung
his
head
gloomily
.
It
was
evident
that
no
one
had
understood
*NL*
the
last
part
.
In
particular
,
the
words
``
I
will
come
back
to
dinner
,
''
*NL*
evidently
displeased
both
reader
and
audience
.
The
people
's
minds
were
*NL*
tuned
to
a
high
pitch
and
this
was
too
simple
and
needlessly
*NL*
comprehensible
--
it
was
what
any
one
of
them
might
have
said
and
*NL*
therefore
was
what
an
ukase
emanating
from
the
highest
authority
should
*NL*
not
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
stood
despondent
and
silent
.
The
tall
youth
moved
his
lips
and
*NL*
swayed
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
ask
him

that
's
he
himself
?
''
...
``
Yes
,
ask
him
indeed

*NL*
Why
not
?
He
'll
explain

...
voices
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
were
suddenly
*NL*
heard
saying
,
and
the
general
attention
turned
to
the
police
*NL*
superintendent
's
trap
which
drove
into
the
square
attended
by
two
*NL*
mounted
dragoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superintendent
of
police
,
who
had
gone
that
morning
by
Count
*NL*
Rostopchin
's
orders
to
burn
the
barges
and
had
in
connection
with
that
*NL*
matter
acquired
a
large
sum
of
money
which
was
at
that
moment
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
on
seeing
a
crowd
bearing
down
upon
him
told
his
coachman
to
*NL*
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
people
are
these

he
shouted
to
the
men
,
who
were
moving
singly
*NL*
and
timidly
in
the
direction
of
his
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
people
are
these
?

he
shouted
again
,
receiving
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor

replied
the
shopman
in
the
frieze
coat
,
``

said
the
superintendent
of
police
.
``
Go
on

he
ordered
*NL*
his
coachman

*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
halted
,
pressing
around
those
who
had
heard
what
the
*NL*
superintendent
had
said
,
and
looking
at
the
departing
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superintendent
of
police
turned
round
at
that
moment
with
a
scared
*NL*
look
,
said
something
to
his
coachman

his
horses
increased
their

speed

*NL*
``
It

youth

``
Do

answer

shouted
*NL*
different
people
and
the
people
dashed
in
pursuit
of
the
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
the
superintendent
of
police
and
talking
loudly
the
crowd
went
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
Lubyanka
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now

the
gentry

voices
in

more
and

frequently

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
first
of
September
,
after
his
interview
with
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
Count
Rostopchin
had
returned
to
Moscow
mortified
and
offended
*NL*
because
he
had
not
been
invited
to
attend
the
council
of
war
,
and
*NL*
because
Kutuzov
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
offer
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
defense
of
the
city
;
amazed
also
at
the
novel
outlook
revealed
to
him
at
*NL*
the
camp
,
which
treated
the
tranquillity
of
the
capital
and
its
*NL*
patriotic
fervor
as
not
merely
secondary
but
quite
irrelevant
and
*NL*
unimportant
matters
.
Distressed
,
offended
,
and
surprised
by
all
this
,
*NL*
Rostopchin
had
returned
to
Moscow
.
After
supper
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
*NL*
without
undressing
,
and
was
awakened
soon
after
midnight
by
a
courier
*NL*
bringing
him
a
letter
from
Kutuzov
.
This
letter
requested
the
count
to
*NL*
send
police
officers
to
guide
the
troops
through
the
town
,
as
the
army
*NL*
was
retreating
to
the
Ryazan
road
beyond
Moscow
.
This
was
not
news
to
*NL*
Rostopchin
.
He
had
known
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned
not
merely
since
*NL*
his
interview
the
previous
day
with
Kutuzov
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
but
*NL*
ever
since
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
for
all
the
generals
who
came
to
*NL*
Moscow
after
that
battle
had
said
unanimously
that
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
fight
another
battle
,
and
since
then
the
government
property
had
been
*NL*
removed
every
night
,
and
half
the
inhabitants
had
left
the
city
with
*NL*
Rostopchin
's
own
permission
.
Yet
all
the
same
this
information
*NL*
astonished
and
irritated
the
count
,
coming
as
it
did
in
the
form
of
a
*NL*
simple
note
with
an
order
from
Kutuzov
,
and
received
at
night
,
breaking
*NL*
in
on
his
beauty
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
later
on
in
his
memoirs
Count
Rostopchin
explained
his
actions
at
*NL*
this
time
,
he
repeatedly
says
that
he
was
then
actuated
by
two
important
*NL*
considerations
:
to
maintain
tranquillity
in
Moscow
and
expedite
the
*NL*
departure
of
the
inhabitants
.
If
one
accepts
this
twofold
aim
all
*NL*
Rostopchin
's
actions
appear
irreproachable
.
``
Why
were
the
holy
relics
,
*NL*
the
arms
,
ammunition
,
gunpowder
,
and
stores
of
corn
not
removed
?
Why
*NL*
were
thousands
of
inhabitants
deceived
into
believing
that
Moscow
would
*NL*
not
be
given
up
--
and
thereby
ruined
?
''
``
To
preserve
the
tranquillity
of
*NL*
the
city
,
''
explains
Count
Rostopchin
.
``
Why
were
bundles
of
useless
*NL*
papers
from
the
government
offices
,
and
Leppich
's
balloon
and
other
*NL*
articles
removed
?
''
``
To
leave
the
town
empty
,
''
explains
Count
Rostopchin
.
*NL*
One
need
only
admit
that
public
tranquillity
is
in
danger
and
any
action
*NL*
finds
a
justification
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
based
only
on
solicitude
for
*NL*
public
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
what
,
then
,
was
Count
Rostopchin
's
fear
for
the
tranquillity
of
*NL*
Moscow
based
in
1812
?
What
reason
was
there
for
assuming
any
probability
*NL*
of
an
uprising
in
the
city
?
The
inhabitants
were
leaving
it
and
the
*NL*
retreating
troops
were
filling
it
.
Why
should
that
cause
the
masses
to
*NL*
riot
?
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
in
Moscow
nor
anywhere
in
Russia
did
anything
resembling
an
*NL*
insurrection
ever
occur
when
the
enemy
entered
a
town
.
More
than
ten
*NL*
thousand
people
were
still
in
Moscow
on
the
first
and
second
of
*NL*
September
,
and
except
for
a
mob
in
the
governor
's
courtyard
,
assembled
*NL*
there
at
his
bidding
,
nothing
happened
.
It
is
obvious
that
there
would
*NL*
have
been
even
less
reason
to
expect
a
disturbance
among
the
people
if
*NL*
after
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
when
the
surrender
of
Moscow
became
*NL*
certain
or
at
least
probable
,
Rostopchin
instead
of
exciting
the
people
*NL*
by
distributing
arms
and
broadsheets
had
taken
steps
to
remove
all
the
*NL*
holy
relics
,
the
gunpowder
,
munitions
,
and
money
,
and
had
told
the
*NL*
population
plainly
that
the
town
would
be
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostopchin
,
though
he
had
patriotic
sentiments
,
was
a
sanguine
and
*NL*
impulsive
man
who
had
always
moved
in
the
highest
administrative
circles
*NL*
and
had
no
understanding
at
all
of
the
people
he
supposed
himself
to
be
*NL*
guiding
.
Ever
since
the
enemy
's
entry
into
Smolensk
he
had
in
*NL*
imagination
been
playing
the
role
of
director
of
the
popular
feeling
of
*NL*
``
the
heart
of
Russia
.
''
Not
only
did
it
seem
to
him
-LRB-
as
to
all
*NL*
administrators
-RRB-
that
he
controlled
the
external
actions
of
Moscow
's
*NL*
inhabitants
,
but
he
also
thought
he
controlled
their
mental
attitude
by
*NL*
means
of
his
broadsheets
and
posters
,
written
in
a
coarse
tone
which
the
*NL*
people
despise
in
their
own
class
and
do
not
understand
from
those
in
*NL*
authority
.
Rostopchin
was
so
pleased
with
the
fine
role
of
leader
of
*NL*
popular
feeling
,
and
had
grown
so
used
to
it
,
that
the
necessity
of
*NL*
relinquishing
that
role
and
abandoning
Moscow
without
any
heroic
display
*NL*
took
him
unawares
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
ground
slip
away
from
under
*NL*
his
feet
,
so
that
he
positively
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
Though
he
knew
*NL*
it
was
coming
,
he
did
not
till
the
last
moment
wholeheartedly
believe
*NL*
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned
,
and
did
not
prepare
for
it
.
The
*NL*
inhabitants
left
against
his
wishes
.
If
the
government
offices
were
*NL*
removed
,
this
was
only
done
on
the
demand
of
officials
to
whom
the
count
*NL*
yielded
reluctantly
.
He
was
absorbed
in
the
role
he
had
created
for
*NL*
himself
.
As
is
often
the
case
with
those
gifted
with
an
ardent
*NL*
imagination
,
though
he
had
long
known
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned
he
*NL*
knew
it
only
with
his
intellect
,
he
did
not
believe
it
in
his
heart
and
*NL*
did
not
adapt
himself
mentally
to
this
new
position
of
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
painstaking
and
energetic
activity
-LRB-
in
how
far
it
was
useful
and
*NL*
had
any
effect
on
the
people
is
another
question
-RRB-
had
been
simply
*NL*
directed
toward
arousing
in
the
masses
his
own
feeling
of
patriotic
*NL*
hatred
of
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
events
assumed
their
true
historical
character
,
when
expressing
*NL*
hatred
for
the
French
in
words
proved
insufficient
,
when
it
was
not
even
*NL*
possible
to
express
that
hatred
by
fighting
a
battle
,
when
self
-
*NL*
confidence
was
of
no
avail
in
relation
to
the
one
question
before
*NL*
Moscow
,
when
the
whole
population
streamed
out
of
Moscow
as
one
man
,
*NL*
abandoning
their
belongings
and
proving
by
that
negative
action
all
the
*NL*
depth
of
their
national
feeling
,
then
the
role
chosen
by
Rostopchin
*NL*
suddenly
appeared
senseless
.
He
unexpectedly
felt
himself
ridiculous
,
*NL*
weak
,
and
alone
,
with
no
ground
to
stand
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
awakened
from
his
sleep
,
he
received
that
cold
,
peremptory
note
*NL*
from
Kutuzov
,
he
felt
the
more
irritated
the
more
he
felt
himself
to
*NL*
blame
.
All
that
he
had
been
specially
put
in
charge
of
,
the
state
*NL*
property
which
he
should
have
removed
,
was
still
in
Moscow
and
it
was
no
*NL*
longer
possible
to
take
the
whole
of
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
to
blame
for
it
?
Who
has
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass
?
''
he
*NL*
ruminated
.
``
Not
I
,
of
course
.
I
had
everything
ready
.
I
had
Moscow
*NL*
firmly
in
hand
.
And
this
is
what
they
have
let
it
come
to
!
Villains
!
*NL*
Traitors
!
''
he
thought
,
without
clearly
defining
who
the
villains
and
*NL*
traitors
were
,
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
hate
those
traitors
whoever
*NL*
they
might
be
who
were
to
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
in
*NL*
which
he
found
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
Count
Rostopchin
issued
orders
,
for
which
people
came
to
*NL*
him
from
all
parts
of
Moscow
.
Those
about
him
had
never
seen
the
count
*NL*
so
morose
and
irritable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
the
Director
of
the
Registrar
's
Department
has
sent
*NL*
for
instructions
...
From
the
Consistory

from
the
Senate
,
from
the

University

Hospital

Brigade

*NL*
From

governor

prison

the
*NL*
lunatic
asylum

''
All
night
long
such
announcements
were
continually
*NL*
being
received
by
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
these
inquiries
he
gave
brief
and
angry
replies
indicating
that
*NL*
orders
from
him
were
not
now
needed
,
that
the
whole
affair
,
carefully
*NL*
prepared
by
him
,
had
now
been
ruined
by
somebody
,
and
that
that
somebody
*NL*
would
have
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
for
all
that
might
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
tell
that
blockhead
,
''
he
said
in
reply
to
the
question
from
the
*NL*
Registrar
's
Department
,
``
that
he
should
remain
to
guard
his
documents
.
*NL*
Now
why
are
you
asking
silly
questions
about
the
Fire
Brigade
?
They
have
*NL*
horses
,
let
them
be
off
to
Vladimir
,
and
not
leave
them
to
the
French

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
My

Let
them
go
away

that
's
all

And
let
the
lunatics
out

into

When
lunatics
command
our
armies
God
evidently
means
*NL*
these
other
madmen
to
be
free

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
an
inquiry
about
the
convicts
in
the
prison
,
Count
*NL*
Rostopchin
shouted
angrily
at
the
governor
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
expect
me
to
give
you
two
battalions
--
which
we
have

Release

``

n't

shouted
Rostopchin

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
the
troops
were
already
moving
*NL*
through
Moscow
,
nobody
came
to
the
count
any
more
for
instructions
.
*NL*
Those
who
were
able
to
get
away
were
going
of
their
own
accord
,
those
*NL*
who
remained
behind
decided
for
themselves
what
they
must
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
ordered
his
carriage
that
he
might
drive
to
Sokolniki
,
and
sat
*NL*
in
his
study
with
folded
hands
,
morose
,
sallow
,
and
taciturn
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
quiet
and
untroubled
times
it
seems
to
every
administrator
that
it
is
*NL*
only
by
his
efforts
that
the
whole
population
under
his
rule
is
kept
*NL*
going
,
and
in
this
consciousness
of
being
indispensable
every
*NL*
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
of
his
labor
and
efforts
.
While
the
*NL*
sea
of
history
remains
calm
the
ruler-administrator
in
his
frail
bark
,
*NL*
holding
on
with
a
boat
hook
to
the
ship
of
the
people
and
himself
*NL*
moving
,
naturally
imagines
that
his
efforts
move
the
ship
he
is
holding
*NL*
on
to
.
But
as
soon
as
a
storm
arises
and
the
sea
begins
to
heave
and
the
*NL*
ship
to
move
,
such
a
delusion
is
no
longer
possible
.
The
ship
moves
*NL*
independently
with
its
own
enormous
motion
,
the
boat
hook
no
longer
*NL*
reaches
the
moving
vessel
,
and
suddenly
the
administrator
,
instead
of
*NL*
appearing
a
ruler
and
a
source
of
power
,
becomes
an
insignificant
,
*NL*
useless
,
feeble
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostopchin
felt
this
,
and
it
was
this
which
exasperated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superintendent
of
police
,
whom
the
crowd
had
stopped
,
went
in
to
see
*NL*
him
at
the
same
time
as
an
adjutant
who
informed
the
count
that
the
*NL*
horses
were
harnessed
.
They
were
both
pale
,
and
the
superintendent
of
*NL*
police
,
after
reporting
that
he
had
executed
the
instructions
he
had
*NL*
received
,
informed
the
count
that
an
immense
crowd
had
collected
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
and
wished
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
saying
a
word
Rostopchin
rose
and
walked
hastily
to
his
light
,
*NL*
luxurious
drawing
room
,
went
to
the
balcony
door
,
took
hold
of
the
*NL*
handle
,
let
it
go
again
,
and
went
to
the
window
from
which
he
had
a
*NL*
better
view
of
the
whole
crowd
.
The
tall
lad
was
standing
in
front
,
*NL*
flourishing
his
arm
and
saying
something
with
a
stern
look
.
The
blood
-
*NL*
stained
smith
stood
beside
him
with
a
gloomy
face
.
A
drone
of
voices
was
*NL*
audible
through
the
closed
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
carriage
ready
?
''
asked
Rostopchin
,
stepping
back
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
your
excellency
,
''
replied
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostopchin
went
again
to
the
balcony
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
they
want
?
''
he
asked
the
superintendent
of
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
,
they
say
they
have
got
ready
,
according
to
your
*NL*
orders
,
to
go
against
the
French
,
and
they
shouted
something
about
*NL*
treachery
.
But
it
is
a
turbulent
crowd
,
your
excellency
--
I
hardly
*NL*
managed
to
get
away
from
it
.
Your
excellency
,
I
venture
to
suggest
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
go
.
I
do
n't
need
you
to
tell
me
what
to
do
!
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Rostopchin
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
by
the
balcony
door
looking
at
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
they
have
done
with
Russia
!
This
is
what
they
have
done
*NL*
with
me
!
''
thought
he
,
full
of
an
irrepressible
fury
that
welled
up
*NL*
within
him
against
the
someone
to
whom
what
was
happening
might
be
*NL*
attributed
.
As
often
happens
with
passionate
people
,
he
was
mastered
by
*NL*
anger
but
was
still
seeking
an
object
on
which
to
vent
it
.
``
Here
is
that
*NL*
mob
,
the
dregs
of
the
people
,
''
he
thought
as
he
gazed
at
the
crowd
:
*NL*
``
this
rabble
they
have
roused
by
their
folly
!
They
want
a
victim
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
as
he
looked
at
the
tall
lad
flourishing
his
arm
.
And
this
*NL*
thought
occurred
to
him
just
because
he
himself
desired
a
victim
,
*NL*
something
on
which
to
vent
his
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
carriage
ready
?
''
he
asked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
excellency
.
What
are
your
orders
about
Vereshchagin
?
He
is
*NL*
waiting
at
the
porch
,
''
said
the
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
exclaimed
Rostopchin
,
as
if
struck
by
an
unexpected
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
rapidly
opening
the
door
he
went
resolutely
out
onto
the
balcony
.
*NL*
The
talking
instantly
ceased
,
hats
and
caps
were
doffed
,
and
all
eyes
*NL*
were
raised
to
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
lads
!
''
said
the
count
briskly
and
loudly
.
``
Thank
you
for
*NL*
coming
.
I
'll
come
out
to
you
in
a
moment
,
but
we
must
first
settle
with
*NL*
the
villain
.
We
must
punish
the
villain
who
has
caused
the
ruin
of
*NL*
Moscow
.
Wait
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
count
stepped
as
briskly
back
into
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
*NL*
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
of
approbation
and
satisfaction
ran
through
the
crowd
.
``
He
'll
*NL*
settle
with
all
the
villains
,
you
'll
see
!
And
you
said
the
French
...
*NL*
He
'll
show
you
what
law
is
!
''
the
mob
were
saying
as
if
reproving
one
*NL*
another
for
their
lack
of
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
an
officer
came
hurriedly
out
of
the
front
door
,
*NL*
gave
an
order
,
and
the
dragoons
formed
up
in
line
.
The
crowd
moved
*NL*
eagerly
from
the
balcony
toward
the
porch
.
Rostopchin
,
coming
out
there
*NL*
with
quick
angry
steps
,
looked
hastily
around
as
if
seeking
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
he
inquired
.
And
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
young
man
coming
*NL*
round
the
corner
of
the
house
between
two
dragoons
.
He
had
a
long
thin
*NL*
neck
,
and
his
head
,
that
had
been
half
shaved
,
was
again
covered
by
*NL*
short
hair
.
This
young
man
was
dressed
in
a
threadbare
blue
cloth
coat
*NL*
lined
with
fox
fur
,
that
had
once
been
smart
,
and
dirty
hempen
convict
*NL*
trousers
,
over
which
were
pulled
his
thin
,
dirty
,
trodden-down
boots
.
On
*NL*
his
thin
,
weak
legs
were
heavy
chains
which
hampered
his
irresolute
*NL*
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Rostopchin
,
hurriedly
turning
away
his
eyes
from
the
young
*NL*
man
in
the
fur-lined
coat
and
pointing
to
the
bottom
step
of
the
porch
.
*NL*
``
Put
him
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
in
his
clattering
chains
stepped
clumsily
to
the
spot
*NL*
indicated
,
holding
away
with
one
finger
the
coat
collar
which
chafed
his
*NL*
neck
,
turned
his
long
neck
twice
this
way
and
that
,
sighed
,
and
*NL*
submissively
folded
before
him
his
thin
hands
,
unused
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
seconds
while
the
young
man
was
taking
his
place
on
the
step
*NL*
the
silence
continued
.
Only
among
the
back
rows
of
the
people
,
who
were
*NL*
all
pressing
toward
the
one
spot
,
could
sighs
,
groans
,
and
the
shuffling
*NL*
of
feet
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
waiting
for
the
young
man
to
take
his
place
on
the
step
Rostopchin
*NL*
stood
frowning
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lads
!
''
said
he
,
with
a
metallic
ring
in
his
voice
.
``
This
man
,
*NL*
Vereshchagin
,
is
the
scoundrel
by
whose
doing
Moscow
is
perishing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
in
the
fur-lined
coat
,
stooping
a
little
,
stood
in
a
*NL*
submissive
attitude
,
his
fingers
clasped
before
him
.
His
emaciated
young
*NL*
face
,
disfigured
by
the
half-shaven
head
,
hung
down
hopelessly
.
At
the
*NL*
count
's
first
words
he
raised
it
slowly
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
*NL*
wishing
to
say
something
or
at
least
to
meet
his
eye
.
But
Rostopchin
did
*NL*
not
look
at
him
.
A
vein
in
the
young
man
's
long
thin
neck
swelled
like
a
*NL*
cord
and
went
blue
behind
the
ear
,
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
.
He
looked
at
the
crowd
,
and
rendered
more
*NL*
hopeful
by
the
expression
he
read
on
the
faces
there
,
he
smiled
sadly
*NL*
and
timidly
,
and
lowering
his
head
shifted
his
feet
on
the
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
betrayed
his
Tsar
and
his
country
,
he
has
gone
over
to
*NL*
Bonaparte
.
He
alone
of
all
the
Russians
has
disgraced
the
Russian
name
,
*NL*
he
has
caused
Moscow
to
perish
,
''
said
Rostopchin
in
a
sharp
,
even
voice
,
*NL*
but
suddenly
he
glanced
down
at
Vereshchagin
who
continued
to
stand
in
*NL*
the
same
submissive
attitude
.
As
if
inflamed
by
the
sight
,
he
raised
his
*NL*
arm
and
addressed
the
people
,
almost
shouting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deal
with
him
as
you
think
fit
!
I
hand
him
over
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
remained
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
one
*NL*
another
.
To
keep
one
another
back
,
to
breathe
in
that
stifling
*NL*
atmosphere
,
to
be
unable
to
stir
,
and
to
await
something
unknown
,
*NL*
uncomprehended
,
and
terrible
,
was
becoming
unbearable
.
Those
standing
in
*NL*
front
,
who
had
seen
and
heard
what
had
taken
place
before
them
,
all
*NL*
stood
with
wide-open
eyes
and
mouths
,
straining
with
all
their
strength
,
*NL*
and
held
back
the
crowd
that
was
pushing
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
him
!
...
Let
the
traitor
perish
and
not
disgrace
the
Russian
name
!
''
*NL*
shouted
Rostopchin
.
``
Cut
him
down
.
I
command
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
not
so
much
the
words
as
the
angry
tone
of
Rostopchin
's
voice
,
*NL*
the
crowd
moaned
and
heaved
forward
,
but
again
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
!
''
exclaimed
the
timid
yet
theatrical
voice
of
Vereshchagin
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued
,
``
Count
!
One
God
is
above
us
*NL*
both
...
''
He
lifted
his
head
and
again
the
thick
vein
in
his
thin
neck
*NL*
filled
with
blood
and
the
color
rapidly
came
and
went
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
what
he
wished
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
him
down
!
I
command
it
...
''
shouted
Rostopchin
,
suddenly
growing
*NL*
pale
like
Vereshchagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
sabers
!
''
cried
the
dragoon
officer
,
drawing
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
still
stronger
wave
flowed
through
the
crowd
and
reaching
the
*NL*
front
ranks
carried
it
swaying
to
the
very
steps
of
the
porch
.
The
tall
*NL*
youth
,
with
a
stony
look
on
his
face
,
and
rigid
and
uplifted
arm
,
stood
*NL*
beside
Vereshchagin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saber
him
!
''
the
dragoon
officer
almost
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
one
of
the
soldiers
,
his
face
all
at
once
distorted
with
fury
,
*NL*
struck
Vereshchagin
on
the
head
with
the
blunt
side
of
his
saber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Vereshchagin
in
meek
surprise
,
looking
round
with
a
*NL*
frightened
glance
as
if
not
understanding
why
this
was
done
to
him
.
A
*NL*
similar
moan
of
surprise
and
horror
ran
through
the
crowd
.
``
O
Lord
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
a
sorrowful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
had
escaped
from
Vereshchagin
*NL*
he
uttered
a
plaintive
cry
of
pain
,
and
that
cry
was
fatal
.
The
barrier
*NL*
of
human
feeling
,
strained
to
the
utmost
,
that
had
held
the
crowd
in
*NL*
check
suddenly
broke
.
The
crime
had
begun
and
must
now
be
completed
.
The
*NL*
plaintive
moan
of
reproach
was
drowned
by
the
threatening
and
angry
roar
*NL*
of
the
crowd
.
Like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
shatters
a
ship
,
that
*NL*
last
irresistible
wave
burst
from
the
rear
and
reached
the
front
ranks
,
*NL*
carrying
them
off
their
feet
and
engulfing
them
all
.
The
dragoon
was
*NL*
about
to
repeat
his
blow
.
Vereshchagin
with
a
cry
of
horror
,
covering
*NL*
his
head
with
his
hands
,
rushed
toward
the
crowd
.
The
tall
youth
,
*NL*
against
whom
he
stumbled
,
seized
his
thin
neck
with
his
hands
and
,
*NL*
yelling
wildly
,
fell
with
him
under
the
feet
of
the
pressing
,
struggling
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
beat
and
tore
at
Vereshchagin
,
others
at
the
tall
youth
.
And
the
*NL*
screams
of
those
that
were
being
trampled
on
and
of
those
who
tried
to
*NL*
rescue
the
tall
lad
only
increased
the
fury
of
the
crowd
.
It
was
a
long
*NL*
time
before
the
dragoons
could
extricate
the
bleeding
youth
,
beaten
*NL*
almost
to
death
.
And
for
a
long
time
,
despite
the
feverish
haste
with
*NL*
which
the
mob
tried
to
end
the
work
that
had
been
begun
,
those
who
were
*NL*
hitting
,
throttling
,
and
tearing
at
Vereshchagin
were
unable
to
kill
*NL*
him
,
for
the
crowd
pressed
from
all
sides
,
swaying
as
one
mass
with
them
*NL*
in
the
center
and
rendering
it
impossible
for
them
either
to
kill
him
or
*NL*
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hit
him
with
an
ax
,
eh
!
...
Crushed
?
...
Traitor
,
he
sold
Christ
...
*NL*
Still
alive
...
tenacious
...
serves
him
right
!
Torture
serves
a
thief
*NL*
right
.
Use
the
hatchet
!
...
What
--
still
alive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
the
victim
ceased
to
struggle
and
his
cries
changed
to
a
long
-
*NL*
drawn
,
measured
death
rattle
did
the
crowd
around
his
prostrate
,
*NL*
bleeding
corpse
begin
rapidly
to
change
places
.
Each
one
came
up
,
*NL*
glanced
at
what
had
been
done
,
and
with
horror
,
reproach
,
and
*NL*
astonishment
pushed
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
!
The
people
are
like
wild
beasts
!
How
could
he
be
alive
?
''
voices
*NL*
in
the
crowd
could
be
heard
saying
.
``
Quite
a
young
fellow
too
...
must
*NL*
have
been
a
merchant
's
son
.
What
men
!
...
and
they
say
he
's
not
the
right
*NL*
one
...
How
not
the
right
one
?
...
O
Lord
!
And
there
's
another
has
been
*NL*
beaten
too
--
they
say
he
's
nearly
done
for
...
Oh
,
the
people
...
Are
n't
*NL*
they
afraid
of
sinning
?
...
''
said
the
same
mob
now
,
looking
with
pained
*NL*
distress
at
the
dead
body
with
its
long
,
thin
,
half-severed
neck
and
its
*NL*
livid
face
stained
with
blood
and
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
painstaking
police
officer
,
considering
the
presence
of
a
corpse
in
*NL*
his
excellency
's
courtyard
unseemly
,
told
the
dragoons
to
take
it
away
.
*NL*
Two
dragoons
took
it
by
its
distorted
legs
and
dragged
it
along
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
gory
,
dust-stained
,
half-shaven
head
with
its
long
neck
*NL*
trailed
twisting
along
the
ground
.
The
crowd
shrank
back
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Vereshchagin
fell
and
the
crowd
closed
in
with
savage
*NL*
yells
and
swayed
about
him
,
Rostopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
and
,
instead
*NL*
of
going
to
the
back
entrance
where
his
carriage
awaited
him
,
went
with
*NL*
hurried
steps
and
bent
head
,
not
knowing
where
and
why
,
along
the
*NL*
passage
leading
to
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
.
The
count
's
face
was
*NL*
white
and
he
could
not
control
the
feverish
twitching
of
his
lower
jaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
your
excellency
...
Where
are
you
going
?
...
This
way
,
*NL*
please
...
''
said
a
trembling
,
frightened
voice
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostopchin
was
unable
to
reply
and
,
turning
obediently
,
went
in
*NL*
the
direction
indicated
.
At
the
back
entrance
stood
his
caleche
.
The
*NL*
distant
roar
of
the
yelling
crowd
was
audible
even
there
.
He
hastily
*NL*
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
him
to
his
country
house
in
*NL*
Sokolniki
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
Myasnitski
Street
and
could
no
longer
hear
the
*NL*
shouts
of
the
mob
,
the
count
began
to
repent
.
He
remembered
with
*NL*
dissatisfaction
the
agitation
and
fear
he
had
betrayed
before
his
*NL*
subordinates
.
``
The
mob
is
terrible
--
disgusting
,
''
he
said
to
himself
in
*NL*
French
.
``
They
are
like
wolves
whom
nothing
but
flesh
can
appease
.
''
*NL*
``
Count
!
One
God
is
above
us
both
!
''
--
Vereshchagin
's
words
suddenly
*NL*
recurred
to
him
,
and
a
disagreeable
shiver
ran
down
his
back
.
But
this
*NL*
was
only
a
momentary
feeling
and
Count
Rostopchin
smiled
disdainfully
at
*NL*
himself
.
``
I
had
other
duties
,
''
thought
he
.
``
The
people
had
to
be
*NL*
appeased
.
Many
other
victims
have
perished
and
are
perishing
for
the
*NL*
public
good
''
--
and
he
began
thinking
of
his
social
duties
to
his
family
*NL*
and
to
the
city
entrusted
to
him
,
and
of
himself
--
not
himself
as
*NL*
Theodore
Vasilyevich
Rostopchin
-LRB-
he
fancied
that
Theodore
Vasilyevich
*NL*
Rostopchin
was
sacrificing
himself
for
the
public
good
-RRB-
but
himself
as
*NL*
governor
,
the
representative
of
authority
and
of
the
Tsar
.
``
Had
I
been
*NL*
simply
Theodore
Vasilyevich
my
course
of
action
would
have
been
quite
*NL*
different
,
but
it
was
my
duty
to
safeguard
my
life
and
dignity
as
*NL*
commander-in-chief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lightly
swaying
on
the
flexible
springs
of
his
carriage
and
no
longer
*NL*
hearing
the
terrible
sounds
of
the
crowd
,
Rostopchin
grew
physically
*NL*
calm
and
,
as
always
happens
,
as
soon
as
he
became
physically
tranquil
*NL*
his
mind
devised
reasons
why
he
should
be
mentally
tranquil
too
.
The
*NL*
thought
which
tranquillized
Rostopchin
was
not
a
new
one
.
Since
the
*NL*
world
began
and
men
have
killed
one
another
no
one
has
ever
committed
*NL*
such
a
crime
against
his
fellow
man
without
comforting
himself
with
this
*NL*
same
idea
.
This
idea
is
le
bien
public
,
the
hypothetical
welfare
of
*NL*
other
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
man
not
swayed
by
passion
that
welfare
is
never
certain
,
but
he
who
*NL*
commits
such
a
crime
always
knows
just
where
that
welfare
lies
.
And
*NL*
Rostopchin
now
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
did
his
reason
not
reproach
him
for
what
he
had
done
,
but
he
*NL*
even
found
cause
for
self-satisfaction
in
having
so
successfully
*NL*
contrived
to
avail
himself
of
a
convenient
opportunity
to
punish
a
*NL*
criminal
and
at
the
same
time
pacify
the
mob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vereshchagin
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death
,
''
thought
Rostopchin
*NL*
-LRB-
though
the
Senate
had
only
condemned
Vereshchagin
to
hard
labor
-RRB-
,
``
he
*NL*
was
a
traitor
and
a
spy
.
I
could
not
let
him
go
unpunished
and
so
I
have
*NL*
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
:
to
appease
the
mob
I
gave
them
a
victim
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
punished
a
miscreant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
reached
his
country
house
and
begun
to
give
orders
about
domestic
*NL*
arrangements
,
the
count
grew
quite
tranquil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
he
was
driving
with
his
fast
horses
across
the
*NL*
Sokolniki
field
,
no
longer
thinking
of
what
had
occurred
but
considering
*NL*
what
was
to
come
.
He
was
driving
to
the
Yauza
bridge
where
he
had
heard
*NL*
that
Kutuzov
was
.
Count
Rostopchin
was
mentally
preparing
the
angry
and
*NL*
stinging
reproaches
he
meant
to
address
to
Kutuzov
for
his
deception
.
He
*NL*
would
make
that
foxy
old
courtier
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
*NL*
the
calamities
that
would
follow
the
abandonment
of
the
city
and
the
*NL*
ruin
of
Russia
-LRB-
as
Rostopchin
regarded
it
-RRB-
would
fall
upon
his
doting
*NL*
old
head
.
Planning
beforehand
what
he
would
say
to
Kutuzov
,
Rostopchin
*NL*
turned
angrily
in
his
caleche
and
gazed
sternly
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sokolniki
field
was
deserted
.
Only
at
the
end
of
it
,
in
front
of
the
*NL*
almshouse
and
the
lunatic
asylum
,
could
be
seen
some
people
in
white
and
*NL*
others
like
them
walking
singly
across
the
field
shouting
and
*NL*
gesticulating
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
was
running
to
cross
the
path
of
Count
Rostopchin
's
*NL*
carriage
,
and
the
count
himself
,
his
coachman
,
and
his
dragoons
looked
*NL*
with
vague
horror
and
curiosity
at
these
released
lunatics
and
*NL*
especially
at
the
one
running
toward
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swaying
from
side
to
side
on
his
long
,
thin
legs
in
his
fluttering
*NL*
dressing
gown
,
this
lunatic
was
running
impetuously
,
his
gaze
fixed
on
*NL*
Rostopchin
,
shouting
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
to
him
*NL*
to
stop
.
The
lunatic
's
solemn
,
gloomy
face
was
thin
and
yellow
,
with
its
*NL*
beard
growing
in
uneven
tufts
.
His
black
,
agate
pupils
with
saffron
-
*NL*
yellow
whites
moved
restlessly
near
the
lower
eyelids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
Pull
up
,
I
tell
you
!
''
he
cried
in
a
piercing
voice
,
and
again
*NL*
shouted
something
breathlessly
with
emphatic
intonations
and
gestures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
abreast
of
the
caleche
he
ran
beside
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thrice
have
they
slain
me
,
thrice
have
I
risen
from
the
dead
.
They
*NL*
stoned
me
,
crucified
me
...
I
shall
rise
...
shall
rise
...
shall
rise
.
*NL*
They
have
torn
my
body
.
The
kingdom
of
God
will
be
overthrown
...
Thrice
*NL*
will
I
overthrow
it
and
thrice
re-establish
it
!
''
he
cried
,
raising
his
*NL*
voice
higher
and
higher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Count
Rostopchin
suddenly
grew
pale
as
he
had
done
when
the
crowd
closed
*NL*
in
on
Vereshchagin
.
He
turned
away
.
``
Go
fas
...
faster
!
''
he
cried
in
a
*NL*
trembling
voice
to
his
coachman
.
The
caleche
flew
over
the
ground
as
*NL*
fast
as
the
horses
could
draw
it
,
but
for
a
long
time
Count
Rostopchin
*NL*
still
heard
the
insane
despairing
screams
growing
fainter
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
while
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
the
astonished
,
frightened
,
*NL*
bloodstained
face
of
``
the
traitor
''
in
the
fur-lined
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Recent
as
that
mental
picture
was
,
Rostopchin
already
felt
that
it
had
*NL*
cut
deep
into
his
heart
and
drawn
blood
.
Even
now
he
felt
clearly
that
*NL*
the
gory
trace
of
that
recollection
would
not
pass
with
time
,
but
that
*NL*
the
terrible
memory
would
,
on
the
contrary
,
dwell
in
his
heart
ever
more
*NL*
cruelly
and
painfully
to
the
end
of
his
life
.
He
seemed
still
to
hear
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
own
words
:
``
Cut
him
down
!
I
command
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
I
utter
those
words
?
It
was
by
some
accident
I
said
them
...
I
*NL*
need
not
have
said
them
,
''
he
thought
.
``
And
then
nothing
would
have
*NL*
happened
.
''
He
saw
the
frightened
and
then
infuriated
face
of
the
dragoon
*NL*
who
dealt
the
blow
,
the
look
of
silent
,
timid
reproach
that
boy
in
the
*NL*
fur-lined
coat
had
turned
upon
him
.
``
But
I
did
not
do
it
for
my
own
*NL*
sake
.
I
was
bound
to
act
that
way
...
The
mob
,
the
traitor
...
the
public
*NL*
welfare
,
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troops
were
still
crowding
at
the
Yauza
bridge
.
It
was
hot
.
Kutuzov
,
*NL*
dejected
and
frowning
,
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
bridge
toying
with
his
whip
*NL*
in
the
sand
when
a
caleche
dashed
up
noisily
.
A
man
in
a
general
's
*NL*
uniform
with
plumes
in
his
hat
went
up
to
Kutuzov
and
said
something
in
*NL*
French
.
It
was
Count
Rostopchin
.
He
told
Kutuzov
that
he
had
come
*NL*
because
Moscow
,
the
capital
,
was
no
more
and
only
the
army
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
would
have
been
different
if
your
Serene
Highness
had
not
told
*NL*
me
that
you
would
not
abandon
Moscow
without
another
battle
;
all
this
*NL*
would
not
have
happened
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
at
Rostopchin
as
if
,
not
grasping
what
was
said
to
him
,
*NL*
he
was
trying
to
read
something
peculiar
written
at
that
moment
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
man
addressing
him
.
Rostopchin
grew
confused
and
became
*NL*
silent
.
Kutuzov
slightly
shook
his
head
and
not
taking
his
penetrating
*NL*
gaze
from
Rostopchin
's
face
muttered
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
I
shall
not
give
up
Moscow
without
a
battle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Kutuzov
was
thinking
of
something
entirely
different
when
he
*NL*
spoke
those
words
,
or
uttered
them
purposely
,
knowing
them
to
be
*NL*
meaningless
,
at
any
rate
Rostopchin
made
no
reply
and
hastily
left
him
.
*NL*
And
strange
to
say
,
the
Governor
of
Moscow
,
the
proud
Count
Rostopchin
,
*NL*
took
up
a
Cossack
whip
and
went
to
the
bridge
where
he
began
with
shouts
*NL*
to
drive
on
the
carts
that
blocked
the
way
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
Murat
's
troops
were
entering
*NL*
Moscow
.
In
front
rode
a
detachment
of
Wurttemberg
hussars
and
behind
*NL*
them
rode
the
King
of
Naples
himself
accompanied
by
a
numerous
suite
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
Arbat
Street
,
near
the
Church
of
the
Miraculous
*NL*
Icon
of
St.
Nicholas
,
Murat
halted
to
await
news
from
the
advanced
*NL*
detachment
as
to
the
condition
in
which
they
had
found
the
citadel
,
le
*NL*
Kremlin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
Murat
gathered
a
group
of
those
who
had
remained
in
Moscow
.
They
*NL*
all
stared
in
timid
bewilderment
at
the
strange
,
long-haired
commander
*NL*
dressed
up
in
feathers
and
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
their
Tsar
himself
?
He
's
not
bad
!
''
low
voices
could
be
heard
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
interpreter
rode
up
to
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
off
your
cap
...
your
caps
!
''
These
words
went
from
one
to
another
*NL*
in
the
crowd
.
The
interpreter
addressed
an
old
porter
and
asked
if
it
*NL*
was
far
to
the
Kremlin
.
The
porter
,
listening
in
perplexity
to
the
*NL*
unfamiliar
Polish
accent
and
not
realizing
that
the
interpreter
was
*NL*
speaking
Russian
,
did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
and
*NL*
slipped
behind
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Murat
approached
the
interpreter
and
told
him
to
ask
where
the
Russian
*NL*
army
was
.
One
of
the
Russians
understood
what
was
asked
and
several
*NL*
voices
at
once
began
answering
the
interpreter
.
A
French
officer
,
*NL*
returning
from
the
advanced
detachment
,
rode
up
to
Murat
and
reported
*NL*
that
the
gates
of
the
citadel
had
been
barricaded
and
that
there
was
*NL*
probably
an
ambuscade
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Murat
and
,
turning
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
his
suite
,
*NL*
ordered
four
light
guns
to
be
moved
forward
to
fire
at
the
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guns
emerged
at
a
trot
from
the
column
following
Murat
and
advanced
*NL*
up
the
Arbat
.
When
they
reached
the
end
of
the
Vozdvizhenka
Street
they
*NL*
halted
and
drew
in
the
Square
.
Several
French
officers
superintended
the
*NL*
placing
of
the
guns
and
looked
at
the
Kremlin
through
field
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bells
in
the
Kremlin
were
ringing
for
vespers
,
and
this
sound
*NL*
troubled
the
French
.
They
imagined
it
to
be
a
call
to
arms
.
A
few
*NL*
infantrymen
ran
to
the
Kutafyev
Gate
.
Beams
and
wooden
screens
had
been
*NL*
put
there
,
and
two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
under
the
gate
as
soon
as
*NL*
an
officer
and
men
began
to
run
toward
it
.
A
general
who
was
standing
by
*NL*
the
guns
shouted
some
words
of
command
to
the
officer
,
and
the
latter
*NL*
ran
back
again
with
his
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
three
more
shots
came
from
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
shot
struck
a
French
soldier
's
foot
,
and
from
behind
the
screens
*NL*
came
the
strange
sound
of
a
few
voices
shouting
.
Instantly
as
at
a
word
*NL*
of
command
the
expression
of
cheerful
serenity
on
the
faces
of
the
*NL*
French
general
,
officers
,
and
men
changed
to
one
of
determined
*NL*
concentrated
readiness
for
strife
and
suffering
.
To
all
of
them
from
the
*NL*
marshal
to
the
least
soldier
,
that
place
was
not
the
Vozdvizhenka
,
*NL*
Mokhavaya
,
or
Kutafyev
Street
,
nor
the
Troitsa
Gate
-LRB-
places
familiar
in
*NL*
Moscow
-RRB-
,
but
a
new
battlefield
which
would
probably
prove
sanguinary
.
*NL*
And
all
made
ready
for
that
battle
.
The
cries
from
the
gates
ceased
.
The
*NL*
guns
were
advanced
,
the
artillerymen
blew
the
ash
off
their
linstocks
,
*NL*
and
an
officer
gave
the
word
``
Fire
!
''
This
was
followed
by
two
whistling
*NL*
sounds
of
canister
shot
,
one
after
another
.
The
shot
rattled
against
the
*NL*
stone
of
the
gate
and
upon
the
wooden
beams
and
screens
,
and
two
*NL*
wavering
clouds
of
smoke
rose
over
the
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
instants
after
the
echo
of
the
reports
resounding
over
the
stone
-
*NL*
built
Kremlin
had
died
away
the
French
heard
a
strange
sound
above
their
*NL*
head
.
Thousands
of
crows
rose
above
the
walls
and
circled
in
the
air
,
*NL*
cawing
and
noisily
flapping
their
wings
.
Together
with
that
sound
came
a
*NL*
solitary
human
cry
from
the
gateway
and
amid
the
smoke
appeared
the
*NL*
figure
of
a
bareheaded
man
in
a
peasant
's
coat
.
He
grasped
a
musket
and
*NL*
took
aim
at
the
French
.
``
Fire
!
''
repeated
the
officer
once
more
,
and
the
*NL*
reports
of
a
musket
and
of
two
cannon
shots
were
heard
simultaneously
.
*NL*
The
gate
was
again
hidden
by
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
more
stirred
behind
the
screens
and
the
French
infantry
soldiers
*NL*
and
officers
advanced
to
the
gate
.
In
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
*NL*
four
dead
.
Two
men
in
peasant
coats
ran
away
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
,
*NL*
toward
the
Znamenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clear
that
away
!
''
said
the
officer
,
pointing
to
the
beams
and
the
*NL*
corpses
,
and
the
French
soldiers
,
after
dispatching
the
wounded
,
threw
*NL*
the
corpses
over
the
parapet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
these
men
were
nobody
knew
.
``
Clear
that
away
!
''
was
all
that
was
said
*NL*
of
them
,
and
they
were
thrown
over
the
parapet
and
removed
later
on
that
*NL*
they
might
not
stink
.
Thiers
alone
dedicates
a
few
eloquent
lines
to
*NL*
their
memory
:
``
These
wretches
had
occupied
the
sacred
citadel
,
having
*NL*
supplied
themselves
with
guns
from
the
arsenal
,
and
fired
''
-LRB-
the
*NL*
wretches
-RRB-
``
at
the
French
.
Some
of
them
were
sabered
and
the
Kremlin
was
*NL*
purged
of
their
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Murat
was
informed
that
the
way
had
been
cleared
.
The
French
entered
the
*NL*
gates
and
began
pitching
their
camp
in
the
Senate
Square
.
Out
of
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
Senate
House
the
soldiers
threw
chairs
into
the
Square
*NL*
for
fuel
and
kindled
fires
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
detachments
passed
through
the
Kremlin
and
encamped
along
the
*NL*
Moroseyka
,
the
Lubyanka
,
and
Pokrovka
Streets
.
Others
quartered
*NL*
themselves
along
the
Vozdvizhenka
,
the
Nikolski
,
and
the
Tverskoy
*NL*
Streets
.
No
masters
of
the
houses
being
found
anywhere
,
the
French
were
*NL*
not
billeted
on
the
inhabitants
as
is
usual
in
towns
but
lived
in
it
as
*NL*
in
a
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
tattered
,
hungry
,
worn
out
,
and
reduced
to
a
third
of
their
*NL*
original
number
,
the
French
entered
Moscow
in
good
marching
order
.
It
*NL*
was
a
weary
and
famished
,
but
still
a
fighting
and
menacing
army
.
But
it
*NL*
remained
an
army
only
until
its
soldiers
had
dispersed
into
their
*NL*
different
lodgings
.
As
soon
as
the
men
of
the
various
regiments
began
to
*NL*
disperse
among
the
wealthy
and
deserted
houses
,
the
army
was
lost
*NL*
forever
and
there
came
into
being
something
nondescript
,
neither
*NL*
citizens
nor
soldiers
but
what
are
known
as
marauders
.
When
five
weeks
*NL*
later
these
same
men
left
Moscow
,
they
no
longer
formed
an
army
.
They
*NL*
were
a
mob
of
marauders
,
each
carrying
a
quantity
of
articles
which
*NL*
seemed
to
him
valuable
or
useful
.
The
aim
of
each
man
when
he
left
*NL*
Moscow
was
no
longer
,
as
it
had
been
,
to
conquer
,
but
merely
to
keep
*NL*
what
he
had
acquired
.
Like
a
monkey
which
puts
its
paw
into
the
narrow
*NL*
neck
of
a
jug
,
and
having
seized
a
handful
of
nuts
will
not
open
its
*NL*
fist
for
fear
of
losing
what
it
holds
,
and
therefore
perishes
,
the
*NL*
French
when
they
left
Moscow
had
inevitably
to
perish
because
they
*NL*
carried
their
loot
with
them
,
yet
to
abandon
what
they
had
stolen
was
as
*NL*
impossible
for
them
as
it
is
for
the
monkey
to
open
its
paw
and
let
go
*NL*
of
its
nuts
.
Ten
minutes
after
each
regiment
had
entered
a
Moscow
*NL*
district
,
not
a
soldier
or
officer
was
left
.
Men
in
military
uniforms
*NL*
and
Hessian
boots
could
be
seen
through
the
windows
,
laughing
and
*NL*
walking
through
the
rooms
.
In
cellars
and
storerooms
similar
men
were
*NL*
busy
among
the
provisions
,
and
in
the
yards
unlocking
or
breaking
open
*NL*
coach
house
and
stable
doors
,
lighting
fires
in
kitchens
and
kneading
*NL*
and
baking
bread
with
rolled-up
sleeves
,
and
cooking
;
or
frightening
,
*NL*
amusing
,
or
caressing
women
and
children
.
There
were
many
such
men
both
*NL*
in
the
shops
and
houses
--
but
there
was
no
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Order
after
order
was
issued
by
the
French
commanders
that
day
*NL*
forbidding
the
men
to
disperse
about
the
town
,
sternly
forbidding
any
*NL*
violence
to
the
inhabitants
or
any
looting
,
and
announcing
a
roll
call
*NL*
for
that
very
evening
.
But
despite
all
these
measures
the
men
,
who
had
*NL*
till
then
constituted
an
army
,
flowed
all
over
the
wealthy
,
deserted
*NL*
city
with
its
comforts
and
plentiful
supplies
.
As
a
hungry
herd
of
*NL*
cattle
keeps
well
together
when
crossing
a
barren
field
,
but
gets
out
of
*NL*
hand
and
at
once
disperses
uncontrollably
as
soon
as
it
reaches
rich
*NL*
pastures
,
so
did
the
army
disperse
all
over
the
wealthy
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
residents
were
left
in
Moscow
,
and
the
soldiers
--
like
water
*NL*
percolating
through
sand
--
spread
irresistibly
through
the
city
in
all
*NL*
directions
from
the
Kremlin
into
which
they
had
first
marched
.
The
*NL*
cavalry
,
on
entering
a
merchant
's
house
that
had
been
abandoned
and
*NL*
finding
there
stabling
more
than
sufficient
for
their
horses
,
went
on
,
*NL*
all
the
same
,
to
the
next
house
which
seemed
to
them
better
.
Many
of
*NL*
them
appropriated
several
houses
,
chalked
their
names
on
them
,
and
*NL*
quarreled
and
even
fought
with
other
companies
for
them
.
Before
they
had
*NL*
had
time
to
secure
quarters
the
soldiers
ran
out
into
the
streets
to
see
*NL*
the
city
and
,
hearing
that
everything
had
been
abandoned
,
rushed
to
*NL*
places
where
valuables
were
to
be
had
for
the
taking
.
The
officers
*NL*
followed
to
check
the
soldiers
and
were
involuntarily
drawn
into
doing
*NL*
the
same
.
In
Carriage
Row
carriages
had
been
left
in
the
shops
,
and
*NL*
generals
flocked
there
to
select
caleches
and
coaches
for
themselves
.
*NL*
The
few
inhabitants
who
had
remained
invited
commanding
officers
to
*NL*
their
houses
,
hoping
thereby
to
secure
themselves
from
being
plundered
.
*NL*
There
were
masses
of
wealth
and
there
seemed
no
end
to
it
.
All
around
*NL*
the
quarters
occupied
by
the
French
were
other
regions
still
unexplored
*NL*
and
unoccupied
where
,
they
thought
,
yet
greater
riches
might
be
found
.
*NL*
And
Moscow
engulfed
the
army
ever
deeper
and
deeper
.
When
water
is
*NL*
spilled
on
dry
ground
both
the
dry
ground
and
the
water
disappear
and
*NL*
mud
results
;
and
in
the
same
way
the
entry
of
the
famished
army
into
the
*NL*
rich
and
deserted
city
resulted
in
fires
and
looting
and
the
destruction
*NL*
of
both
the
army
and
the
wealthy
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
attributed
the
Fire
of
Moscow
au
patriotisme
feroce
de
*NL*
Rostopchine
,
*
the
Russians
to
the
barbarity
of
the
French
.
In
reality
,
*NL*
however
,
it
was
not
,
and
could
not
be
,
possible
to
explain
the
burning
*NL*
of
Moscow
by
making
any
individual
,
or
any
group
of
people
,
responsible
*NL*
for
it
.
Moscow
was
burned
because
it
found
itself
in
a
position
in
which
*NL*
any
town
built
of
wood
was
bound
to
burn
,
quite
apart
from
whether
it
*NL*
had
,
or
had
not
,
a
hundred
and
thirty
inferior
fire
engines
.
Deserted
*NL*
Moscow
had
to
burn
as
inevitably
as
a
heap
of
shavings
has
to
burn
on
*NL*
which
sparks
continually
fall
for
several
days
.
A
town
built
of
wood
,
*NL*
where
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
conflagrations
when
the
house
owners
*NL*
are
in
residence
and
a
police
force
is
present
,
can
not
help
burning
when
*NL*
its
inhabitants
have
left
it
and
it
is
occupied
by
soldiers
who
smoke
*NL*
pipes
,
make
campfires
of
the
Senate
chairs
in
the
Senate
Square
,
and
*NL*
cook
themselves
meals
twice
a
day
.
In
peacetime
it
is
only
necessary
to
*NL*
billet
troops
in
the
villages
of
any
district
and
the
number
of
fires
in
*NL*
that
district
immediately
increases
.
How
much
then
must
the
probability
*NL*
of
fire
be
increased
in
an
abandoned
,
wooden
town
where
foreign
troops
*NL*
are
quartered
.
``
Le
patriotisme
feroce
de
Rostopchine
''
and
the
barbarity
*NL*
of
the
French
were
not
to
blame
in
the
matter
.
Moscow
was
set
on
fire
by
*NL*
the
soldiers
'
pipes
,
kitchens
,
and
campfires
,
and
by
the
carelessness
of
*NL*
enemy
soldiers
occupying
houses
they
did
not
own
.
Even
if
there
was
any
*NL*
arson
-LRB-
which
is
very
doubtful
,
for
no
one
had
any
reason
to
burn
the
*NL*
houses
--
in
any
case
a
troublesome
and
dangerous
thing
to
do
-RRB-
,
arson
*NL*
can
not
be
regarded
as
the
cause
,
for
the
same
thing
would
have
happened
*NL*
without
any
incendiarism
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
To
Rostopchin
's
ferocious
patriotism
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
tempting
it
might
be
for
the
French
to
blame
Rostopchin
's
*NL*
ferocity
and
for
Russians
to
blame
the
scoundrel
Bonaparte
,
or
later
on
*NL*
to
place
an
heroic
torch
in
the
hands
of
their
own
people
,
it
is
*NL*
impossible
not
to
see
that
there
could
be
no
such
direct
cause
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
for
Moscow
had
to
burn
as
every
village
,
factory
,
or
house
must
*NL*
burn
which
is
left
by
its
owners
and
in
which
strangers
are
allowed
to
*NL*
live
and
cook
their
porridge
.
Moscow
was
burned
by
its
inhabitants
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
but
by
those
who
had
abandoned
it
and
not
by
those
who
remained
*NL*
in
it
.
Moscow
when
occupied
by
the
enemy
did
not
remain
intact
like
*NL*
Berlin
,
Vienna
,
and
other
towns
,
simply
because
its
inhabitants
*NL*
abandoned
it
and
did
not
welcome
the
French
with
bread
and
salt
,
nor
*NL*
bring
them
the
keys
of
the
city
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
The
absorption
of
the
French
by
Moscow
,
radiating
starwise
as
it
did
,
*NL*
only
reached
the
quarter
where
Pierre
was
staying
by
the
evening
of
the
*NL*
second
of
September
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
last
two
days
spent
in
solitude
and
unusual
circumstances
,
*NL*
Pierre
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
insanity
.
He
was
completely
obsessed
*NL*
by
one
persistent
thought
.
He
did
not
know
how
or
when
this
thought
had
*NL*
taken
such
possession
of
him
,
but
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
past
,
*NL*
understood
nothing
of
the
present
,
and
all
he
saw
and
heard
appeared
to
*NL*
him
like
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
left
home
only
to
escape
the
intricate
tangle
of
life
's
demands
*NL*
that
enmeshed
him
,
and
which
in
his
present
condition
he
was
unable
to
*NL*
unravel
.
He
had
gone
to
Joseph
Alexeevich
's
house
,
on
the
plea
of
*NL*
sorting
the
deceased
's
books
and
papers
,
only
in
search
of
rest
from
*NL*
life
's
turmoil
,
for
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
Joseph
Alexeevich
was
*NL*
connected
with
a
world
of
eternal
,
solemn
,
and
calm
thoughts
,
quite
*NL*
contrary
to
the
restless
confusion
into
which
he
felt
himself
being
*NL*
drawn
.
He
sought
a
quiet
refuge
,
and
in
Joseph
Alexeevich
's
study
he
*NL*
really
found
it
.
When
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
dusty
writing
table
*NL*
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
study
,
calm
and
significant
memories
*NL*
of
the
last
few
days
rose
one
after
another
in
his
imagination
,
*NL*
particularly
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
of
that
vague
sense
of
his
*NL*
own
insignificance
and
insincerity
compared
with
the
truth
,
simplicity
,
*NL*
and
strength
of
the
class
of
men
he
mentally
classed
as
they
.
When
*NL*
Gerasim
roused
him
from
his
reverie
the
idea
occurred
to
him
of
taking
*NL*
part
in
the
popular
defense
of
Moscow
which
he
knew
was
projected
.
And
*NL*
with
that
object
he
had
asked
Gerasim
to
get
him
a
peasant
's
coat
and
a
*NL*
pistol
,
confiding
to
him
his
intentions
of
remaining
in
Joseph
*NL*
Alexeevich
's
house
and
keeping
his
name
secret
.
Then
during
the
first
*NL*
day
spent
in
inaction
and
solitude
-LRB-
he
tried
several
times
to
fix
his
*NL*
attention
on
the
masonic
manuscripts
,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
-RRB-
the
idea
*NL*
that
had
previously
occurred
to
him
of
the
cabalistic
significance
of
*NL*
his
name
in
connection
with
Bonaparte
's
more
than
once
vaguely
presented
*NL*
itself
.
But
the
idea
that
he
,
L'russe
Besuhof
,
was
destined
to
set
a
*NL*
limit
to
the
power
of
the
Beast
was
as
yet
only
one
of
the
fancies
that
*NL*
often
passed
through
his
mind
and
left
no
trace
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
having
bought
the
coat
merely
with
the
object
of
taking
part
among
*NL*
the
people
in
the
defense
of
Moscow
,
Pierre
had
met
the
Rostovs
and
*NL*
Natasha
had
said
to
him
:
``
Are
you
remaining
in
Moscow
?
...
How
splendid
!
''
*NL*
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
it
really
would
be
a
good
thing
,
*NL*
even
if
Moscow
were
taken
,
for
him
to
remain
there
and
do
what
he
was
*NL*
predestined
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
with
the
sole
idea
of
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
in
*NL*
any
way
behind
them
,
Pierre
went
to
the
Three
Hills
gate
.
But
when
he
*NL*
returned
to
the
house
convinced
that
Moscow
would
not
be
defended
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
felt
that
what
before
had
seemed
to
him
merely
a
possibility
*NL*
had
now
become
absolutely
necessary
and
inevitable
.
He
must
remain
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
concealing
his
name
,
and
must
meet
Napoleon
and
kill
him
,
and
*NL*
either
perish
or
put
an
end
to
the
misery
of
all
Europe
--
which
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
was
solely
due
to
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
knew
all
the
details
of
the
attempt
on
Bonaparte
's
life
in
1809
*NL*
by
a
German
student
in
Vienna
,
and
knew
that
the
student
had
been
shot
.
*NL*
And
the
risk
to
which
he
would
expose
his
life
by
carrying
out
his
*NL*
design
excited
him
still
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
Pierre
irresistibly
to
this
purpose
.
*NL*
The
first
was
a
feeling
of
the
necessity
of
sacrifice
and
suffering
in
*NL*
view
of
the
common
calamity
,
the
same
feeling
that
had
caused
him
to
go
*NL*
to
Mozhaysk
on
the
twenty-fifth
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
very
thick
of
*NL*
the
battle
and
had
now
caused
him
to
run
away
from
his
home
and
,
in
*NL*
place
of
the
luxury
and
comfort
to
which
he
was
accustomed
,
to
sleep
on
*NL*
a
hard
sofa
without
undressing
and
eat
the
same
food
as
Gerasim
.
The
*NL*
other
was
that
vague
and
quite
Russian
feeling
of
contempt
for
*NL*
everything
conventional
,
artificial
,
and
human
--
for
everything
the
*NL*
majority
of
men
regard
as
the
greatest
good
in
the
world
.
Pierre
had
*NL*
first
experienced
this
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
at
the
Sloboda
*NL*
Palace
,
when
he
had
suddenly
felt
that
wealth
,
power
,
and
life
--
all
that
*NL*
men
so
painstakingly
acquire
and
guard
--
if
it
has
any
worth
has
so
only
*NL*
by
reason
of
the
joy
with
which
it
can
all
be
renounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
feeling
that
induces
a
volunteer
recruit
to
spend
his
last
*NL*
penny
on
drink
,
and
a
drunken
man
to
smash
mirrors
or
glasses
for
no
*NL*
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
it
will
cost
him
all
the
money
he
*NL*
possesses
:
the
feeling
which
causes
a
man
to
perform
actions
which
from
*NL*
an
ordinary
point
of
view
are
insane
,
to
test
,
as
it
were
,
his
personal
*NL*
power
and
strength
,
affirming
the
existence
of
a
higher
,
nonhuman
*NL*
criterion
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
very
day
Pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
*NL*
at
the
Sloboda
Palace
he
had
been
continuously
under
its
influence
,
but
*NL*
only
now
found
full
satisfaction
for
it
.
Moreover
,
at
this
moment
Pierre
*NL*
was
supported
in
his
design
and
prevented
from
renouncing
it
by
what
he
*NL*
had
already
done
in
that
direction
.
If
he
were
now
to
leave
Moscow
like
*NL*
everyone
else
,
his
flight
from
home
,
the
peasant
coat
,
the
pistol
,
and
*NL*
his
announcement
to
the
Rostovs
that
he
would
remain
in
Moscow
would
all
*NL*
become
not
merely
meaningless
but
contemptible
and
ridiculous
,
and
to
*NL*
this
Pierre
was
very
sensitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
physical
condition
,
as
is
always
the
case
,
corresponded
to
his
*NL*
mental
state
.
The
unaccustomed
coarse
food
,
the
vodka
he
drank
during
*NL*
those
days
,
the
absence
of
wine
and
cigars
,
his
dirty
unchanged
linen
,
*NL*
two
almost
sleepless
nights
passed
on
a
short
sofa
without
bedding
--
all
*NL*
this
kept
him
in
a
state
of
excitement
bordering
on
insanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
The
French
had
already
entered
*NL*
Moscow
.
Pierre
knew
this
,
but
instead
of
acting
he
only
thought
about
*NL*
his
undertaking
,
going
over
its
minutest
details
in
his
mind
.
In
his
*NL*
fancy
he
did
not
clearly
picture
to
himself
either
the
striking
of
the
*NL*
blow
or
the
death
of
Napoleon
,
but
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
*NL*
melancholy
enjoyment
imagined
his
own
destruction
and
heroic
endurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
alone
,
for
the
sake
of
all
,
I
must
do
it
or
perish
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
approach
...
and
then
suddenly
...
with
pistol
or
dagger
?
But
*NL*
that
is
all
the
same
!
`
It
is
not
I
but
the
hand
of
Providence
that
*NL*
punishes
thee
,
'
I
shall
say
,
''
thought
he
,
imagining
what
he
would
say
*NL*
when
killing
Napoleon
.
``
Well
then
,
take
me
and
execute
me
!
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
speaking
to
himself
and
bowing
his
head
with
a
sad
but
firm
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Pierre
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
was
talking
to
himself
*NL*
in
this
way
,
the
study
door
opened
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
*NL*
figure
of
Makar
Alexeevich
,
always
so
timid
before
but
now
quite
*NL*
transformed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dressing
gown
was
unfastened
,
his
face
red
and
distorted
.
He
was
*NL*
obviously
drunk
.
On
seeing
Pierre
he
grew
confused
at
first
,
but
*NL*
noticing
embarrassment
on
Pierre
's
face
immediately
grew
bold
and
,
*NL*
staggering
on
his
thin
legs
,
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
frightened
,
''
he
said
confidentially
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
``
I
say
I
*NL*
wo
n't
surrender
,
I
say
...
Am
I
not
right
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
then
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
on
the
table
seized
it
*NL*
with
unexpected
rapidity
and
ran
out
into
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
and
the
porter
,
who
had
followed
Makar
Alexeevich
,
stopped
him
*NL*
in
the
vestibule
and
tried
to
take
the
pistol
from
him
.
Pierre
,
coming
*NL*
out
into
the
corridor
,
looked
with
pity
and
repulsion
at
the
half-crazy
*NL*
old
man
.
Makar
Alexeevich
,
frowning
with
exertion
,
held
on
to
the
pistol
*NL*
and
screamed
hoarsely
,
evidently
with
some
heroic
fancy
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
arms
!
Board
them
!
No
,
you
sha
n't
get
it
,
''
he
yelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
please
,
that
will
do
.
Have
the
goodness
--
please
,
sir
,
to
*NL*
let
go
!
Please
,
sir
...
''
pleaded
Gerasim
,
trying
carefully
to
steer
Makar
*NL*
Alexeevich
by
the
elbows
back
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
Bonaparte
!
...
''
shouted
Makar
Alexeevich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
right
,
sir
.
Come
to
your
room
,
please
,
and
rest
.
Allow
me
to
*NL*
have
the
pistol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
off
,
thou
base
slave
!
Touch
me
not
!
See
this
?
''
shouted
Makar
*NL*
Alexeevich
,
brandishing
the
pistol
.
``
Board
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catch
hold
!
''
whispered
Gerasim
to
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
seized
Makar
Alexeevich
by
the
arms
and
dragged
him
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vestibule
was
filled
with
the
discordant
sounds
of
a
struggle
and
of
*NL*
a
tipsy
,
hoarse
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
fresh
sound
,
a
piercing
feminine
scream
,
reverberated
from
*NL*
the
porch
and
the
cook
came
running
into
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
them
!
Gracious
heavens
!
O
Lord
,
four
of
them
,
horsemen
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
and
the
porter
let
Makar
Alexeevich
go
,
and
in
the
now
silent
*NL*
corridor
the
sound
of
several
hands
knocking
at
the
front
door
could
be
*NL*
heard
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
having
decided
that
until
he
had
carried
out
his
design
he
would
*NL*
disclose
neither
his
identity
nor
his
knowledge
of
French
,
stood
at
the
*NL*
half-open
door
of
the
corridor
,
intending
to
conceal
himself
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
French
entered
.
But
the
French
entered
and
still
Pierre
did
not
*NL*
retire
--
an
irresistible
curiosity
kept
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
of
them
.
One
was
an
officer
--
a
tall
,
soldierly
,
handsome
*NL*
man
--
the
other
evidently
a
private
or
an
orderly
,
sunburned
,
short
,
and
*NL*
thin
,
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
dull
expression
.
The
officer
walked
in
*NL*
front
,
leaning
on
a
stick
and
slightly
limping
.
When
he
had
advanced
a
*NL*
few
steps
he
stopped
,
having
apparently
decided
that
these
were
good
*NL*
quarters
,
turned
round
to
the
soldiers
standing
at
the
entrance
,
and
in
*NL*
a
loud
voice
of
command
ordered
them
to
put
up
the
horses
.
Having
done
*NL*
that
,
the
officer
,
lifting
his
elbow
with
a
smart
gesture
,
stroked
his
*NL*
mustache
and
lightly
touched
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bonjour
,
la
compagnie
!
''
*
said
he
gaily
,
smiling
and
looking
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Good
day
,
everybody
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
gave
any
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vous
etes
le
bourgeois
?
''
*
the
officer
asked
Gerasim
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Are
you
the
master
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gerasim
gazed
at
the
officer
with
an
alarmed
and
inquiring
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quartier
,
quartier
,
logement
!
''
said
the
officer
,
looking
down
at
the
*NL*
little
man
with
a
condescending
and
good-natured
smile
.
``
Les
francais
*NL*
sont
de
bons
enfants
.
Que
diable
!
Voyons
!
Ne
nous
fachons
pas
,
mon
*NL*
vieux
!
''
*
added
he
,
clapping
the
scared
and
silent
Gerasim
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
Well
,
does
no
one
speak
French
in
this
establishment
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
again
in
French
,
looking
around
and
meeting
Pierre
's
eyes
.
Pierre
*NL*
moved
away
from
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Quarters
,
quarters
,
lodgings
!
The
French
are
good
fellows
.
What
the
*NL*
devil
!
There
,
do
n't
let
us
be
cross
,
old
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
officer
turned
to
Gerasim
and
asked
him
to
show
him
the
rooms
*NL*
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
,
not
here
--
do
n't
understand
...
me
,
you
...
''
said
Gerasim
,
trying
*NL*
to
render
his
words
more
comprehensible
by
contorting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
smiling
,
the
French
officer
spread
out
his
hands
before
Gerasim
's
*NL*
nose
,
intimating
that
he
did
not
understand
him
either
,
and
moved
,
*NL*
limping
,
to
the
door
at
which
Pierre
was
standing
.
Pierre
wished
to
go
*NL*
away
and
conceal
himself
,
but
at
that
moment
he
saw
Makar
Alexeevich
*NL*
appearing
at
the
open
kitchen
door
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.
With
a
*NL*
madman
's
cunning
,
Makar
Alexeevich
eyed
the
Frenchman
,
raised
his
*NL*
pistol
,
and
took
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Board
them
!
''
yelled
the
tipsy
man
,
trying
to
press
the
trigger
.
Hearing
*NL*
the
yell
the
officer
turned
round
,
and
at
the
same
moment
Pierre
threw
*NL*
himself
on
the
drunkard
.
Just
when
Pierre
snatched
at
and
struck
up
the
*NL*
pistol
Makar
Alexeevich
at
last
got
his
fingers
on
the
trigger
,
there
*NL*
was
a
deafening
report
,
and
all
were
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
.
The
*NL*
Frenchman
turned
pale
and
rushed
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forgetting
his
intention
of
concealing
his
knowledge
of
French
,
Pierre
,
*NL*
snatching
away
the
pistol
and
throwing
it
down
,
ran
up
to
the
officer
*NL*
and
addressed
him
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
wounded
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
''
answered
the
Frenchman
,
feeling
himself
over
.
``
But
I
have
*NL*
had
a
lucky
escape
this
time
,
''
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
damaged
plaster
*NL*
of
the
wall
.
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
said
he
,
looking
sternly
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
really
in
despair
at
what
has
occurred
,
''
said
Pierre
rapidly
,
*NL*
quite
forgetting
the
part
he
had
intended
to
play
.
``
He
is
an
unfortunate
*NL*
madman
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
went
up
to
Makar
Alexeevich
and
took
him
by
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Makar
Alexeevich
was
standing
with
parted
lips
,
swaying
,
as
if
about
to
*NL*
fall
asleep
,
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brigand
!
You
shall
pay
for
this
,
''
said
the
Frenchman
,
letting
go
of
*NL*
him
.
``
We
French
are
merciful
after
victory
,
but
we
do
not
pardon
*NL*
traitors
,
''
he
added
,
with
a
look
of
gloomy
dignity
and
a
fine
energetic
*NL*
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
continued
,
in
French
,
to
persuade
the
officer
not
to
hold
that
*NL*
drunken
imbecile
to
account
.
The
Frenchman
listened
in
silence
with
the
*NL*
same
gloomy
expression
,
but
suddenly
turned
to
Pierre
with
a
smile
.
For
*NL*
a
few
seconds
he
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
His
handsome
face
assumed
a
*NL*
melodramatically
gentle
expression
and
he
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
saved
my
life
.
You
are
French
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
Frenchman
that
deduction
was
indubitable
.
Only
a
Frenchman
could
*NL*
perform
a
great
deed
,
and
to
save
his
life
--
the
life
of
M.
Ramballe
,
*NL*
captain
of
the
13th
Light
Regiment
--
was
undoubtedly
a
very
great
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
however
indubitable
that
conclusion
and
the
officer
's
conviction
*NL*
based
upon
it
,
Pierre
felt
it
necessary
to
disillusion
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Russian
,
''
he
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
Tell
that
to
others
,
''
said
the
officer
,
waving
his
*NL*
finger
before
his
nose
and
smiling
.
``
You
shall
tell
me
all
about
that
*NL*
presently
.
I
am
delighted
to
meet
a
compatriot
.
Well
,
and
what
are
we
to
*NL*
do
with
this
man
?
''
he
added
,
addressing
himself
to
Pierre
as
to
a
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
if
Pierre
were
not
a
Frenchman
,
having
once
received
that
loftiest
*NL*
of
human
appellations
he
could
not
renounce
it
,
said
the
officer
's
look
*NL*
and
tone
.
In
reply
to
his
last
question
Pierre
again
explained
who
Makar
*NL*
Alexeevich
was
and
how
just
before
their
arrival
that
drunken
imbecile
*NL*
had
seized
the
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
had
time
to
recover
from
*NL*
him
,
and
begged
the
officer
to
let
the
deed
go
unpunished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
expanded
his
chest
and
made
a
majestic
gesture
with
his
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
saved
my
life
!
You
are
French
.
You
ask
his
pardon
?
I
grant
it
*NL*
you
.
Lead
that
man
away
!
''
said
he
quickly
and
energetically
,
and
taking
*NL*
the
arm
of
Pierre
whom
he
had
promoted
to
be
a
Frenchman
for
saving
his
*NL*
life
,
he
went
with
him
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
in
the
yard
,
hearing
the
shot
,
came
into
the
passage
asking
*NL*
what
had
happened
,
and
expressed
their
readiness
to
punish
the
culprits
,
*NL*
but
the
officer
sternly
checked
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
called
in
when
you
are
wanted
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
went
out
again
,
and
the
orderly
,
who
had
meanwhile
had
time
*NL*
to
visit
the
kitchen
,
came
up
to
his
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
there
is
soup
and
a
leg
of
mutton
in
the
kitchen
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
Shall
I
serve
them
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
some
wine
,
''
answered
the
captain
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
French
officer
went
into
the
room
with
Pierre
the
latter
again
*NL*
thought
it
his
duty
to
assure
him
that
he
was
not
French
and
wished
to
*NL*
go
away
,
but
the
officer
would
not
hear
of
it
.
He
was
so
very
polite
,
*NL*
amiable
,
good-natured
,
and
genuinely
grateful
to
Pierre
for
saving
his
*NL*
life
that
Pierre
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
,
and
sat
down
with
him
in
*NL*
the
parlor
--
the
first
room
they
entered
.
To
Pierre
's
assurances
that
he
*NL*
was
not
a
Frenchman
,
the
captain
,
evidently
not
understanding
how
anyone
*NL*
could
decline
so
flattering
an
appellation
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
*NL*
said
that
if
Pierre
absolutely
insisted
on
passing
for
a
Russian
let
it
*NL*
be
so
,
but
for
all
that
he
would
be
forever
bound
to
Pierre
by
gratitude
*NL*
for
saving
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
this
man
been
endowed
with
the
slightest
capacity
for
perceiving
the
*NL*
feelings
of
others
,
and
had
he
at
all
understood
what
Pierre
's
feelings
*NL*
were
,
the
latter
would
probably
have
left
him
,
but
the
man
's
animated
*NL*
obtuseness
to
everything
other
than
himself
disarmed
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Frenchman
or
a
Russian
prince
incognito
,
''
said
the
officer
,
looking
*NL*
at
Pierre
's
fine
though
dirty
linen
and
at
the
ring
on
his
finger
.
``
I
*NL*
owe
my
life
to
you
and
offer
you
my
friendship
.
A
Frenchman
never
*NL*
forgets
either
an
insult
or
a
service
.
I
offer
you
my
friendship
.
That
*NL*
is
all
I
can
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
good
nature
and
nobility
-LRB-
in
the
French
sense
of
the
*NL*
word
-RRB-
in
the
officer
's
voice
,
in
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
his
*NL*
gestures
,
that
Pierre
,
unconsciously
smiling
in
response
to
the
*NL*
Frenchman
's
smile
,
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Ramballe
,
of
the
13th
Light
Regiment
,
Chevalier
of
the
Legion
*NL*
of
Honor
for
the
affair
on
the
seventh
of
September
,
''
he
introduced
*NL*
himself
,
a
self-satisfied
irrepressible
smile
puckering
his
lips
under
*NL*
his
mustache
.
``
Will
you
now
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
with
whom
I
have
*NL*
the
honor
of
conversing
so
pleasantly
,
instead
of
being
in
the
ambulance
*NL*
with
that
maniac
's
bullet
in
my
body
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
replied
that
he
could
not
tell
him
his
name
and
,
blushing
,
began
*NL*
to
try
to
invent
a
name
and
to
say
something
about
his
reason
for
*NL*
concealing
it
,
but
the
Frenchman
hastily
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
understand
your
reasons
.
You
are
an
officer
...
*NL*
a
superior
officer
perhaps
.
You
have
borne
arms
against
us
.
That
's
not
*NL*
my
business
.
I
owe
you
my
life
.
That
is
enough
for
me
.
I
am
quite
at
*NL*
your
service
.
You
belong
to
the
gentry
?
''
he
concluded
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
inquiry
in
his
tone
.
Pierre
bent
his
head
.
``
Your
baptismal
name
,
if
you
*NL*
please
.
That
is
all
I
ask
.
Monsieur
Pierre
,
you
say
...
That
's
all
I
*NL*
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
mutton
and
an
omelet
had
been
served
and
a
samovar
and
vodka
*NL*
brought
,
with
some
wine
which
the
French
had
taken
from
a
Russian
cellar
*NL*
and
brought
with
them
,
Ramballe
invited
Pierre
to
share
his
dinner
,
and
*NL*
himself
began
to
eat
greedily
and
quickly
like
a
healthy
and
hungry
man
,
*NL*
munching
his
food
rapidly
with
his
strong
teeth
,
continually
smacking
*NL*
his
lips
,
and
repeating
--
``
Excellent
!
Delicious
!
''
His
face
grew
red
and
*NL*
was
covered
with
perspiration
.
Pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the
dinner
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
Morel
,
the
orderly
,
brought
some
hot
water
in
a
saucepan
*NL*
and
placed
a
bottle
of
claret
in
it
.
He
also
brought
a
bottle
of
kvass
,
*NL*
taken
from
the
kitchen
for
them
to
try
.
That
beverage
was
already
known
*NL*
to
the
French
and
had
been
given
a
special
name
.
They
called
it
limonade
*NL*
de
cochon
-LRB-
pig
's
lemonade
-RRB-
,
and
Morel
spoke
well
of
the
limonade
de
*NL*
cochon
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
.
But
as
the
captain
had
the
wine
they
*NL*
had
taken
while
passing
through
Moscow
,
he
left
the
kvass
to
Morel
and
*NL*
applied
himself
to
the
bottle
of
Bordeaux
.
He
wrapped
the
bottle
up
to
*NL*
its
neck
in
a
table
napkin
and
poured
out
wine
for
himself
and
for
*NL*
Pierre
.
The
satisfaction
of
his
hunger
and
the
wine
rendered
the
captain
*NL*
still
more
lively
and
he
chatted
incessantly
all
through
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
Monsieur
Pierre
,
I
owe
you
a
fine
votive
candle
for
saving
*NL*
me
from
that
maniac
...
You
see
,
I
have
bullets
enough
in
my
body
*NL*
already
.
Here
is
one
I
got
at
Wagram
''
-LRB-
he
touched
his
side
-RRB-
``
and
a
*NL*
second
at
Smolensk
''
--
he
showed
a
scar
on
his
cheek
--
``
and
this
leg
which
*NL*
as
you
see
does
not
want
to
march
,
I
got
that
on
the
seventh
at
the
*NL*
great
battle
of
la
Moskowa
.
Sacre
Dieu
!
It
was
splendid
!
That
deluge
of
*NL*
fire
was
worth
seeing
.
It
was
a
tough
job
you
set
us
there
,
my
word
!
You
*NL*
may
be
proud
of
it
!
And
on
my
honor
,
in
spite
of
the
cough
I
caught
*NL*
there
,
I
should
be
ready
to
begin
again
.
I
pity
those
who
did
not
see
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
there
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
really
?
So
much
the
better
!
You
are
certainly
brave
foes
.
The
*NL*
great
redoubt
held
out
well
,
by
my
pipe
!
''
continued
the
Frenchman
.
``
And
*NL*
you
made
us
pay
dear
for
it
.
I
was
at
it
three
times
--
sure
as
I
sit
*NL*
here
.
Three
times
we
reached
the
guns
and
three
times
we
were
thrown
*NL*
back
like
cardboard
figures
.
Oh
,
it
was
beautiful
,
Monsieur
Pierre
!
Your
*NL*
grenadiers
were
splendid
,
by
heaven
!
I
saw
them
close
up
their
ranks
six
*NL*
times
in
succession
and
march
as
if
on
parade
.
Fine
fellows
!
Our
King
of
*NL*
Naples
,
who
knows
what
's
what
,
cried
`
Bravo
!
'
Ha
,
ha
!
So
you
are
one
of
*NL*
us
soldiers
!
''
he
added
,
smiling
,
after
a
momentary
pause
.
``
So
much
the
*NL*
better
,
so
much
the
better
,
Monsieur
Pierre
!
Terrible
in
battle
...
*NL*
gallant
...
with
the
fair
''
-LRB-
he
winked
and
smiled
-RRB-
,
``
that
's
what
the
*NL*
French
are
,
Monsieur
Pierre
,
are
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
so
naively
and
good-humoredly
gay
,
so
real
,
and
so
*NL*
pleased
with
himself
that
Pierre
almost
winked
back
as
he
looked
merrily
*NL*
at
him
.
Probably
the
word
``
gallant
''
turned
the
captain
's
thoughts
to
the
*NL*
state
of
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apropos
,
tell
me
please
,
is
it
true
that
the
women
have
all
left
*NL*
Moscow
?
What
a
queer
idea
!
What
had
they
to
be
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
not
the
French
ladies
leave
Paris
if
the
Russians
entered
it
?
''
*NL*
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
The
Frenchman
emitted
a
merry
,
sanguine
chuckle
,
patting
*NL*
Pierre
on
the
shoulder
.
``
What
a
thing
to
say
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Paris
?
...
*NL*
But
Paris
,
Paris
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paris
--
the
capital
of
the
world
,
''
Pierre
finished
his
remark
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
looked
at
Pierre
.
He
had
a
habit
of
stopping
short
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
his
talk
and
gazing
intently
with
his
laughing
,
kindly
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
had
n't
told
me
you
were
Russian
,
I
should
have
wagered
*NL*
that
you
were
Parisian
!
You
have
that
...
I
do
n't
know
what
,
that
...
''
and
*NL*
having
uttered
this
compliment
,
he
again
gazed
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
Paris
.
I
spent
years
there
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
one
sees
that
plainly
.
Paris
!
...
A
man
who
does
n't
know
Paris
*NL*
is
a
savage
.
You
can
tell
a
Parisian
two
leagues
off
.
Paris
is
Talma
,
la
*NL*
Duchenois
,
Potier
,
the
Sorbonne
,
the
boulevards
,
''
and
noticing
that
his
*NL*
conclusion
was
weaker
than
what
had
gone
before
,
he
added
quickly
:
*NL*
``
There
is
only
one
Paris
in
the
world
.
You
have
been
to
Paris
and
have
*NL*
remained
Russian
.
Well
,
I
do
n't
esteem
you
the
less
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
influence
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
and
after
the
days
he
had
*NL*
spent
alone
with
his
depressing
thoughts
,
Pierre
involuntarily
enjoyed
*NL*
talking
with
this
cheerful
and
good-natured
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
return
to
your
ladies
--
I
hear
they
are
lovely
.
What
a
wretched
idea
*NL*
to
go
and
bury
themselves
in
the
steppes
when
the
French
army
is
in
*NL*
Moscow
.
What
a
chance
those
girls
have
missed
!
Your
peasants
,
now
--
*NL*
that
's
another
thing
;
but
you
civilized
people
,
you
ought
to
know
us
*NL*
better
than
that
.
We
took
Vienna
,
Berlin
,
Madrid
,
Naples
,
Rome
,
Warsaw
,
*NL*
all
the
world
's
capitals
...
We
are
feared
,
but
we
are
loved
.
We
are
*NL*
nice
to
know
.
And
then
the
Emperor
...
''
he
began
,
but
Pierre
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
,
''
Pierre
repeated
,
and
his
face
suddenly
became
sad
and
*NL*
embarrassed
,
``
is
the
Emperor
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
?
He
is
generosity
,
mercy
,
justice
,
order
,
genius
--
that
's
*NL*
what
the
Emperor
is
!
It
is
I
,
Ramballe
,
who
tell
you
so
...
I
assure
you
*NL*
I
was
his
enemy
eight
years
ago
.
My
father
was
an
emigrant
count
...
But
*NL*
that
man
has
vanquished
me
.
He
has
taken
hold
of
me
.
I
could
not
resist
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
grandeur
and
glory
with
which
he
has
covered
France
.
*NL*
When
I
understood
what
he
wanted
--
when
I
saw
that
he
was
preparing
a
bed
*NL*
of
laurels
for
us
,
you
know
,
I
said
to
myself
:
`
That
is
a
monarch
,
'
and
*NL*
I
devoted
myself
to
him
!
So
there
!
Oh
yes
,
mon
cher
,
he
is
the
greatest
*NL*
man
of
the
ages
past
or
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
in
Moscow
?
''
Pierre
stammered
with
a
guilty
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
looked
at
his
guilty
face
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
will
make
his
entry
tomorrow
,
''
he
replied
,
and
continued
his
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
several
voices
at
the
*NL*
gate
and
by
Morel
,
who
came
to
say
that
some
Wurttemberg
hussars
had
*NL*
come
and
wanted
to
put
up
their
horses
in
the
yard
where
the
captain
's
*NL*
horses
were
.
This
difficulty
had
arisen
chiefly
because
the
hussars
did
*NL*
not
understand
what
was
said
to
them
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
had
their
senior
sergeant
called
in
,
and
in
a
stern
voice
*NL*
asked
him
to
what
regiment
he
belonged
,
who
was
his
commanding
officer
,
*NL*
and
by
what
right
he
allowed
himself
to
claim
quarters
that
were
already
*NL*
occupied
.
The
German
who
knew
little
French
,
answered
the
two
first
*NL*
questions
by
giving
the
names
of
his
regiment
and
of
his
commanding
*NL*
officer
,
but
in
reply
to
the
third
question
which
he
did
not
understand
*NL*
said
,
introducing
broken
French
into
his
own
German
,
that
he
was
the
*NL*
quartermaster
of
the
regiment
and
his
commander
had
ordered
him
to
*NL*
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
another
.
Pierre
,
who
knew
German
,
*NL*
translated
what
the
German
said
to
the
captain
and
gave
the
captain
's
*NL*
reply
to
the
Wurttemberg
hussar
in
German
.
When
he
had
understood
what
*NL*
was
said
to
him
,
the
German
submitted
and
took
his
men
elsewhere
.
The
*NL*
captain
went
out
into
the
porch
and
gave
some
orders
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
to
the
room
Pierre
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
*NL*
before
,
with
his
head
in
his
hands
.
His
face
expressed
suffering
.
He
*NL*
really
was
suffering
at
that
moment
.
When
the
captain
went
out
and
he
*NL*
was
left
alone
,
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
and
realized
the
position
he
*NL*
was
in
.
It
was
not
that
Moscow
had
been
taken
or
that
the
happy
*NL*
conquerors
were
masters
in
it
and
were
patronizing
him
.
Painful
as
that
*NL*
was
it
was
not
that
which
tormented
Pierre
at
the
moment
.
He
was
*NL*
tormented
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness
.
The
few
glasses
of
*NL*
wine
he
had
drunk
and
the
conversation
with
this
good-natured
man
had
*NL*
destroyed
the
mood
of
concentrated
gloom
in
which
he
had
spent
the
last
*NL*
few
days
and
which
was
essential
for
the
execution
of
his
design
.
The
*NL*
pistol
,
dagger
,
and
peasant
coat
were
ready
.
Napoleon
was
to
enter
the
*NL*
town
next
day
.
Pierre
still
considered
that
it
would
be
a
useful
and
*NL*
worthy
action
to
slay
the
evildoer
,
but
now
he
felt
that
he
would
not
do
*NL*
it
.
He
did
not
know
why
,
but
he
felt
a
foreboding
that
he
would
not
*NL*
carry
out
his
intention
.
He
struggled
against
the
confession
of
his
*NL*
weakness
but
dimly
felt
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
and
that
his
*NL*
former
gloomy
frame
of
mind
,
concerning
vengeance
,
killing
,
and
self
-
*NL*
sacrifice
,
had
been
dispersed
like
dust
by
contact
with
the
first
man
he
*NL*
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
returned
to
the
room
,
limping
slightly
and
whistling
a
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
's
chatter
which
had
previously
amused
Pierre
now
repelled
*NL*
him
.
The
tune
he
was
whistling
,
his
gait
,
and
the
gesture
with
which
he
*NL*
twirled
his
mustache
,
all
now
seemed
offensive
.
``
I
will
go
away
*NL*
immediately
.
I
wo
n't
say
another
word
to
him
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
He
*NL*
thought
this
,
but
still
sat
in
the
same
place
.
A
strange
feeling
of
*NL*
weakness
tied
him
to
the
spot
;
he
wished
to
get
up
and
go
away
,
but
*NL*
could
not
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
on
the
other
hand
,
seemed
very
cheerful
.
He
paced
up
and
*NL*
down
the
room
twice
.
His
eyes
shone
and
his
mustache
twitched
as
if
he
*NL*
were
smiling
to
himself
at
some
amusing
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
colonel
of
those
Wurttembergers
is
delightful
,
''
he
suddenly
said
.
*NL*
``
He
's
a
German
,
but
a
nice
fellow
all
the
same
...
But
he
's
a
German
.
''
*NL*
He
sat
down
facing
Pierre
.
``
By
the
way
,
you
know
German
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
German
for
`
shelter
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shelter
?
''
Pierre
repeated
.
``
The
German
for
shelter
is
Unterkunft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
say
it
?
''
the
captain
asked
quickly
and
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unterkunft
,
''
Pierre
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Onterkoff
,
''
said
the
captain
and
looked
at
Pierre
for
some
seconds
with
*NL*
laughing
eyes
.
``
These
Germans
are
first-rate
fools
,
do
n't
you
think
so
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Pierre
?
''
he
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
have
another
bottle
of
this
Moscow
Bordeaux
,
shall
we
?
*NL*
Morel
will
warm
us
up
another
little
bottle
.
Morel
!
''
he
called
out
*NL*
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
brought
candles
and
a
bottle
of
wine
.
The
captain
looked
at
Pierre
*NL*
by
the
candlelight
and
was
evidently
struck
by
the
troubled
expression
*NL*
on
his
companion
's
face
.
Ramballe
,
with
genuine
distress
and
sympathy
in
*NL*
his
face
,
went
up
to
Pierre
and
bent
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
we
're
sad
,
''
said
he
,
touching
Pierre
's
hand
.
``
Have
I
upset
*NL*
you
?
No
,
really
,
have
you
anything
against
me
?
''
he
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
the
state
of
affairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
answer
,
but
looked
cordially
into
the
Frenchman
's
eyes
*NL*
whose
expression
of
sympathy
was
pleasing
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honestly
,
without
speaking
of
what
I
owe
you
,
I
feel
friendship
for
*NL*
you
.
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
?
Dispose
of
me
.
It
is
for
life
and
death
.
*NL*
I
say
it
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
!
''
said
he
,
striking
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
gazed
intently
at
him
as
he
had
done
when
he
learned
that
*NL*
``
shelter
''
was
Unterkunft
in
German
,
and
his
face
suddenly
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
that
case
,
I
drink
to
our
friendship
!
''
he
cried
gaily
,
filling
*NL*
two
glasses
with
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
took
one
of
the
glasses
and
emptied
it
.
Ramballe
emptied
his
too
,
*NL*
again
pressed
Pierre
's
hand
,
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
a
*NL*
pensive
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
he
began
,
``
such
is
fortune
's
caprice
.
Who
would
*NL*
have
said
that
I
should
be
a
soldier
and
a
captain
of
dragoons
in
the
*NL*
service
of
Bonaparte
,
as
we
used
to
call
him
?
Yet
here
I
am
in
Moscow
*NL*
with
him
.
I
must
tell
you
,
mon
cher
,
''
he
continued
in
the
sad
and
*NL*
measured
tones
of
a
man
who
intends
to
tell
a
long
story
,
``
that
our
name
*NL*
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
in
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
Frenchman
's
easy
and
naive
frankness
the
captain
told
Pierre
*NL*
the
story
of
his
ancestors
,
his
childhood
,
youth
,
and
manhood
,
and
all
*NL*
about
his
relations
and
his
financial
and
family
affairs
,
``
ma
pauvre
*NL*
mere
''
playing
of
course
an
important
part
in
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
that
is
only
life
's
setting
,
the
real
thing
is
love
--
love
!
Am
I
*NL*
not
right
,
Monsieur
Pierre
?
''
said
he
,
growing
animated
.
``
Another
glass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
again
emptied
his
glass
and
poured
himself
out
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
women
,
women
!
''
and
the
captain
,
looking
with
glistening
eyes
at
*NL*
Pierre
,
began
talking
of
love
and
of
his
love
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
very
many
of
these
,
as
one
could
easily
believe
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
officer
's
handsome
,
self-satisfied
face
,
and
noting
the
eager
*NL*
enthusiasm
with
which
he
spoke
of
women
.
Though
all
Ramballe
's
love
*NL*
stories
had
the
sensual
character
which
Frenchmen
regard
as
the
special
*NL*
charm
and
poetry
of
love
,
yet
he
told
his
story
with
such
sincere
*NL*
conviction
that
he
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charm
of
love
*NL*
and
he
described
women
so
alluringly
that
Pierre
listened
to
him
with
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
l'amour
which
the
Frenchman
was
so
fond
of
was
not
*NL*
that
low
and
simple
kind
that
Pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
wife
,
nor
was
*NL*
it
the
romantic
love
stimulated
by
himself
that
he
experienced
for
*NL*
Natasha
.
-LRB-
Ramballe
despised
both
these
kinds
of
love
equally
:
the
one
he
*NL*
considered
the
``
love
of
clodhoppers
''
and
the
other
the
``
love
of
*NL*
simpletons
.
''
-RRB-
L'amour
which
the
Frenchman
worshiped
consisted
*NL*
principally
in
the
unnaturalness
of
his
relation
to
the
woman
and
in
a
*NL*
combination
of
incongruities
giving
the
chief
charm
to
the
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
captain
touchingly
recounted
the
story
of
his
love
for
a
*NL*
fascinating
marquise
of
thirty-five
and
at
the
same
time
for
a
charming
,
*NL*
innocent
child
of
seventeen
,
daughter
of
the
bewitching
marquise
.
The
*NL*
conflict
of
magnanimity
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
,
ending
in
*NL*
the
mother
's
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
in
marriage
*NL*
to
her
lover
,
even
now
agitated
the
captain
,
though
it
was
the
memory
of
*NL*
a
distant
past
.
Then
he
recounted
an
episode
in
which
the
husband
played
*NL*
the
part
of
the
lover
,
and
he
--
the
lover
--
assumed
the
role
of
the
*NL*
husband
,
as
well
as
several
droll
incidents
from
his
recollections
of
*NL*
Germany
,
where
``
shelter
''
is
called
Unterkunft
and
where
the
husbands
eat
*NL*
sauerkraut
and
the
young
girls
are
``
too
blonde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
latest
episode
in
Poland
still
fresh
in
the
captain
's
*NL*
memory
,
and
which
he
narrated
with
rapid
gestures
and
glowing
face
,
was
*NL*
of
how
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
Pole
-LRB-
in
general
,
the
saving
of
life
*NL*
continually
occurred
in
the
captain
's
stories
-RRB-
and
the
Pole
had
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
his
enchanting
wife
-LRB-
parisienne
de
coeur
-RRB-
while
himself
*NL*
entering
the
French
service
.
The
captain
was
happy
,
the
enchanting
*NL*
Polish
lady
wished
to
elope
with
him
,
but
,
prompted
by
magnanimity
,
the
*NL*
captain
restored
the
wife
to
the
husband
,
saying
as
he
did
so
:
``
I
have
*NL*
saved
your
life
,
and
I
save
your
honor
!
''
Having
repeated
these
words
the
*NL*
captain
wiped
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
a
shake
,
as
if
driving
away
the
*NL*
weakness
which
assailed
him
at
this
touching
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Listening
to
the
captain
's
tales
,
Pierre
--
as
often
happens
late
in
the
*NL*
evening
and
under
the
influence
of
wine
--
followed
all
that
was
told
him
,
*NL*
understood
it
all
,
and
at
the
same
time
followed
a
train
of
personal
*NL*
memories
which
,
he
knew
not
why
,
suddenly
arose
in
his
mind
.
While
*NL*
listening
to
these
love
stories
his
own
love
for
Natasha
unexpectedly
*NL*
rose
to
his
mind
,
and
going
over
the
pictures
of
that
love
in
his
*NL*
imagination
he
mentally
compared
them
with
Ramballe
's
tales
.
Listening
*NL*
to
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
love
and
duty
,
Pierre
saw
before
*NL*
his
eyes
every
minutest
detail
of
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
of
*NL*
his
love
at
the
Sukharev
water
tower
.
At
the
time
of
that
meeting
it
had
*NL*
not
produced
an
effect
upon
him
--
he
had
not
even
once
recalled
it
.
But
*NL*
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
meeting
had
had
in
it
something
very
*NL*
important
and
poetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peter
Kirilovich
,
come
here
!
We
have
recognized
you
,
''
he
now
seemed
to
*NL*
hear
the
words
she
had
uttered
and
to
see
before
him
her
eyes
,
her
*NL*
smile
,
her
traveling
hood
,
and
a
stray
lock
of
her
hair
...
and
there
*NL*
seemed
to
him
something
pathetic
and
touching
in
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
his
tale
about
the
enchanting
Polish
lady
,
the
captain
*NL*
asked
Pierre
if
he
had
ever
experienced
a
similar
impulse
to
sacrifice
*NL*
himself
for
love
and
a
feeling
of
envy
of
the
legitimate
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Challenged
by
this
question
Pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
a
need
to
*NL*
express
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind
.
He
began
to
explain
that
he
*NL*
understood
love
for
a
women
somewhat
differently
.
He
said
that
in
all
*NL*
his
life
he
had
loved
and
still
loved
only
one
woman
,
and
that
she
could
*NL*
never
be
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tiens
!
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
then
explained
that
he
had
loved
this
woman
from
his
earliest
*NL*
years
,
but
that
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
she
was
too
*NL*
young
,
and
because
he
had
been
an
illegitimate
son
without
a
name
.
*NL*
Afterwards
when
he
had
received
a
name
and
wealth
he
dared
not
think
of
*NL*
her
because
he
loved
her
too
well
,
placing
her
far
above
everything
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
especially
therefore
above
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
reached
this
point
,
Pierre
asked
the
captain
whether
he
*NL*
understood
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
made
a
gesture
signifying
that
even
if
he
did
not
understand
*NL*
it
he
begged
Pierre
to
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Platonic
love
,
clouds
...
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
or
an
impulse
of
frankness
,
or
the
*NL*
thought
that
this
man
did
not
,
and
never
would
,
know
any
of
those
who
*NL*
played
a
part
in
his
story
,
or
whether
it
was
all
these
things
together
,
*NL*
something
loosened
Pierre
's
tongue
.
Speaking
thickly
and
with
a
faraway
*NL*
look
in
his
shining
eyes
,
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
life
:
his
*NL*
marriage
,
Natasha
's
love
for
his
best
friend
,
her
betrayal
of
him
,
and
*NL*
all
his
own
simple
relations
with
her
.
Urged
on
by
Ramballe
's
questions
*NL*
he
also
told
what
he
had
at
first
concealed
--
his
own
position
and
even
*NL*
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
anything
else
in
Pierre
's
story
the
captain
was
impressed
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
Pierre
was
very
rich
,
had
two
mansions
in
Moscow
,
and
that
*NL*
he
had
abandoned
everything
and
not
left
the
city
,
but
remained
there
*NL*
concealing
his
name
and
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
late
at
night
they
went
out
together
into
the
street
.
The
*NL*
night
was
warm
and
light
.
To
the
left
of
the
house
on
the
Pokrovka
a
*NL*
fire
glowed
--
the
first
of
those
that
were
beginning
in
Moscow
.
To
the
*NL*
right
and
high
up
in
the
sky
was
the
sickle
of
the
waning
moon
and
*NL*
opposite
to
it
hung
that
bright
comet
which
was
connected
in
Pierre
's
*NL*
heart
with
his
love
.
At
the
gate
stood
Gerasim
,
the
cook
,
and
two
*NL*
Frenchmen
.
Their
laughter
and
their
mutually
incomprehensible
remarks
in
*NL*
two
languages
could
be
heard
.
They
were
looking
at
the
glow
seen
in
the
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
terrible
in
the
one
small
,
distant
fire
in
the
immense
*NL*
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gazing
at
the
high
starry
sky
,
at
the
moon
,
at
the
comet
,
and
at
the
*NL*
glow
from
the
fire
,
Pierre
experienced
a
joyful
emotion
.
``
There
now
,
how
*NL*
good
it
is
,
what
more
does
one
need
?
''
thought
he
.
And
suddenly
*NL*
remembering
his
intention
he
grew
dizzy
and
felt
so
faint
that
he
leaned
*NL*
against
the
fence
to
save
himself
from
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
taking
leave
of
his
new
friend
,
Pierre
left
the
gate
with
*NL*
unsteady
steps
and
returning
to
his
room
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
*NL*
immediately
fell
asleep
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
The
glow
of
the
first
fire
that
began
on
the
second
of
September
was
*NL*
watched
from
the
various
roads
by
the
fugitive
Muscovites
and
by
the
*NL*
retreating
troops
,
with
many
different
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rostov
party
spent
the
night
at
Mytishchi
,
fourteen
miles
from
*NL*
Moscow
.
They
had
started
so
late
on
the
first
of
September
,
the
road
had
*NL*
been
so
blocked
by
vehicles
and
troops
,
so
many
things
had
been
*NL*
forgotten
for
which
servants
were
sent
back
,
that
they
had
decided
to
*NL*
spend
that
night
at
a
place
three
miles
out
of
Moscow
.
The
next
morning
*NL*
they
woke
late
and
were
again
delayed
so
often
that
they
only
got
as
far
*NL*
as
Great
Mytishchi
.
At
ten
o'clock
that
evening
the
Rostov
family
and
*NL*
the
wounded
traveling
with
them
were
all
distributed
in
the
yards
and
*NL*
huts
of
that
large
village
.
The
Rostovs
'
servants
and
coachmen
and
the
*NL*
orderlies
of
the
wounded
officers
,
after
attending
to
their
masters
,
had
*NL*
supper
,
fed
the
horses
,
and
came
out
into
the
porches
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
neighboring
hut
lay
Raevski
's
adjutant
with
a
fractured
wrist
.
The
*NL*
awful
pain
he
suffered
made
him
moan
incessantly
and
piteously
,
and
his
*NL*
moaning
sounded
terrible
in
the
darkness
of
the
autumn
night
.
He
had
*NL*
spent
the
first
night
in
the
same
yard
as
the
Rostovs
.
The
countess
said
*NL*
she
had
been
unable
to
close
her
eyes
on
account
of
his
moaning
,
and
at
*NL*
Mytishchi
she
moved
into
a
worse
hut
simply
to
be
farther
away
from
the
*NL*
wounded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
of
the
night
one
of
the
servants
noticed
,
above
the
high
*NL*
body
of
a
coach
standing
before
the
porch
,
the
small
glow
of
another
*NL*
fire
.
One
glow
had
long
been
visible
and
everybody
knew
that
it
was
*NL*
Little
Mytishchi
burning
--
set
on
fire
by
Mamonov
's
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
look
here
,
brothers
,
there
's
another
fire
!
''
remarked
an
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
turned
their
attention
to
the
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
told
us
Little
Mytishchi
had
been

on
fire
by
Mamonov
's
*NL*
Cossacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
not
Mytishchi
,
it
's
farther
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
it
must
be
in
Moscow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
gazers
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
coach
and
sat
down
*NL*
on
its
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
more
to
the
left
,
why
,
Little
Mytishchi
is
over
there
,
and
this
is
*NL*
right
on
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
men
joined
the
first
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
how
it
's
flaring
,
''
said
one
.
``
That
's
a
fire
in
Moscow
:
either
in
*NL*
the
Sushchevski
or
the
Rogozhski
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
to
this
remark
and
for
some
time
they
all
gazed
silently
*NL*
at
the
spreading
flames
of
the
second
fire
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Daniel
Terentich
,
the
count
's
valet
-LRB-
as
he
was
called
-RRB-
,
came
up
to
*NL*
the
group
and
shouted
at
Mishka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
staring
at
,
you
good-for-nothing
?
...
The
count
will
be
*NL*
calling
and
there
's
nobody
there
;
go
and
gather
the
clothes
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
ran
out
to
get
some
water
,
''
said
Mishka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
think
,
Daniel
Terentich
?
Does
n't
it
look
as
if
that
*NL*
glow
were
in
Moscow
?
''
remarked
one
of
the
footmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daniel
Terentich
made
no
reply
,
and
again
for
a
long
time
they
were
all
*NL*
silent
.
The
glow
spread
,
rising
and
falling
,
farther
and
farther
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
have
mercy
...
It
's
windy
and
dry
...
''
said
another
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
!
See
what
it
's
doing
now
.
O
Lord
!
You
can
even
see
the
crows
*NL*
flying
.
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
sinners
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
put
it
out

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
to
put
it
out
?
''
Daniel
Terentich
,
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
,
*NL*
was
heard
to
say
.
His
voice
was
calm
and
deliberate
.
``
Moscow
it
is
,
*NL*
brothers
,
''
said
he
.
``
Mother
Moscow
,
the
white
...
''
his
voice
faltered
,
*NL*
and
he
gave
way
to
an
old
man
's
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
as
if
they
had
all
only
waited
for
this
to
realize
the
*NL*
significance
for
them
of
the
glow
they
were
watching
.
Sighs
were
heard
,
*NL*
words
of
prayer
,
and
the
sobbing
of
the
count
's
old
valet
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
,
returning
to
the
cottage
,
informed
the
count
that
Moscow
was
*NL*
burning
.
The
count
donned
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
to
look
.
Sonya
*NL*
and
Madame
Schoss
,
who
had
not
yet
undressed
,
went
out
with
him
.
Only
*NL*
Natasha
and
the
countess
remained
in
the
room
.
Petya
was
no
longer
with
*NL*
the
family
,
he
had
gone
on
with
his
regiment
which
was
making
for
*NL*
Troitsa
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
on
hearing
that
Moscow
was
on
fire
,
began
to
cry
.
Natasha
,
*NL*
pale
,
with
a
fixed
look
,
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
icons
just
*NL*
where
she
had
sat
down
on
arriving
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
father
's
*NL*
words
.
She
was
listening
to
the
ceaseless
moaning
of
the
adjutant
,
three
*NL*
houses
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
terrible
,
''
said
Sonya
returning
from
the
yard
chilled
and
*NL*
frightened
.
``
I
believe
the
whole
of
Moscow
will
burn
,
there
's
an
awful
*NL*
glow
!
Natasha
,
do
look
!
You
can
see
it
from
the
window
,
''
she
said
to
her
*NL*
cousin
,
evidently
wishing
to
distract
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Natasha
looked
at
her
as
if
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
her
*NL*
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
the
stove
.
She
had
been
in
*NL*
this
condition
of
stupor
since
the
morning
,
when
Sonya
,
to
the
surprise
*NL*
and
annoyance
of
the
countess
,
had
for
some
unaccountable
reason
found
*NL*
it
necessary
to
tell
Natasha
of
Prince
Andrew
's
wound
and
of
his
being
*NL*
with
their
party
.
The
countess
had
seldom
been
so
angry
with
anyone
as
*NL*
she
was
with
Sonya
.
Sonya
had
cried
and
begged
to
be
forgiven
and
now
,
*NL*
as
if
trying
to
atone
for
her
fault
,
paid
unceasing
attention
to
her
*NL*
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Natasha
,
how
dreadfully
it
is
burning
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
burning
?
''
asked
Natasha
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
if
in
order
not
to
offend
Sonya
and
to
get
rid
of
her
,
she
turned
*NL*
her
face
to
the
window
,
looked
out
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
she
could
not
see
anything
,
and
again
settled
down
in
her
former
*NL*
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
n't
see
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
really
I
did
,
''
Natasha
replied
in
a
voice
that
pleaded
to
be
left
*NL*
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
countess
and
Sonya
understood
that
,
naturally
,
neither
Moscow
*NL*
nor
the
burning
of
Moscow
nor
anything
else
could
seem
of
importance
to
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
returned
and
lay
down
behind
the
partition
.
The
countess
went
*NL*
up
to
her
daughter
and
touched
her
head
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
*NL*
was
wont
to
do
when
Natasha
was
ill
,
then
touched
her
forehead
with
her
*NL*
lips
as
if
to
feel
whether
she
was
feverish
,
and
finally
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
cold
.
You
are
trembling
all
over
.
You
'd
better
lie
down
,
''
said
*NL*
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
down
?
All
right
,
I
will
.
I
'll
lie
down
at
once
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Natasha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
Prince
Andrew
was
seriously
*NL*
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
their
party
,
she
had
at
first
asked
many
*NL*
questions
:
Where
was
he
going
?
How
was
he
wounded
?
Was
it
serious
?
And
*NL*
could
she
see
him
?
But
after
she
had
been
told
that
she
could
not
see
*NL*
him
,
that
he
was
seriously
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger
,
*NL*
she
ceased
to
ask
questions
or
to
speak
at
all
,
evidently
disbelieving
*NL*
what
they
told
her
,
and
convinced
that
say
what
she
might
she
would
*NL*
still
be
told
the
same
.
All
the
way
she
had
sat
motionless
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
coach
with
wide
open
eyes
,
and
the
expression
in
them
which
the
*NL*
countess
knew
so
well
and
feared
so
much
,
and
now
she
sat
in
the
same
*NL*
way
on
the
bench
where
she
had
seated
herself
on
arriving
.
She
was
*NL*
planning
something
and
either
deciding
or
had
already
decided
something
*NL*
in
her
mind
.
The
countess
knew
this
,
but
what
it
might
be
she
did
not
*NL*
know
,
and
this
alarmed
and
tormented
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
undress
,
darling
;
lie
down
on
my
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bed
had
been
made
on
a
bedstead
for
the
countess
only
.
Madame
Schoss
*NL*
and
the
two
girls
were
to
sleep
on
some
hay
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mamma
,
I
will
lie
down
here
on
the
floor
,
''
Natasha
replied
*NL*
irritably
and
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
.
Through
the
open
*NL*
window
the
moans
of
the
adjutant
could
be
heard
more
distinctly
.
She
put
*NL*
her
head
out
into
the
damp
night
air
,
and
the
countess
saw
her
slim
neck
*NL*
shaking
with
sobs
and
throbbing
against
the
window
frame
.
Natasha
knew
*NL*
it
was
not
Prince
Andrew
who
was
moaning
.
She
knew
Prince
Andrew
was
in
*NL*
the
same
yard
as
themselves
and
in
a
part
of
the
hut
across
the
passage
;
*NL*
but
this
dreadful
incessant
moaning
made
her
sob
.
The
countess
exchanged
*NL*
a
look
with
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
down
,
darling
;
lie
down
,
my
pet
,
''
said
the
countess
,
softly
*NL*
touching
Natasha
's
shoulders
.
``
Come
,
lie
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
...
I
'll
lie
down
at
once
,
''
said
Natasha
,
and
began
hurriedly
*NL*
undressing
,
tugging
at
the
tapes
of
her
petticoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
thrown
off
her
dress
and
put
on
a
dressing
jacket
,
she
sat
*NL*
down
with
her
foot
under
her
on
the
bed
that
had
been
made
up
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
jerked
her
thin
and
rather
short
plait
of
hair
to
the
front
,
and
*NL*
began
replaiting
it
.
Her
long
,
thin
,
practiced
fingers
rapidly
*NL*
unplaited
,
replaited
,
and
tied
up
her
plait
.
Her
head
moved
from
side
to
*NL*
side
from
habit
,
but
her
eyes
,
feverishly
wide
,
looked
fixedly
before
*NL*
her
.
When
her
toilet
for
the
night
was
finished
she
sank
gently
onto
the
*NL*
sheet
spread
over
the
hay
on
the
side
nearest
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
you
'd
better
lie
in
the
middle
,
''
said
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
here
,
''
muttered
Natasha
.
``
Do
lie
down
,
''
she
added
crossly
,
*NL*
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
,
Madame
Schoss
,
and
Sonya
undressed
hastily
and
lay
down
.
*NL*
The
small
lamp
in
front
of
the
icons
was
the
only
light
left
in
the
*NL*
room
.
But
in
the
yard
there
was
a
light
from
the
fire
at
Little
*NL*
Mytishchi
a
mile
and
a
half
away
,
and
through
the
night
came
the
noise
*NL*
of
people
shouting
at
a
tavern
Mamonov
's
Cossacks
had
set
up
across
the
*NL*
street
,
and
the
adjutant
's
unceasing
moans
could
still
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
Natasha
listened
attentively
to
the
sounds
that
reached
*NL*
her
from
inside
and
outside
the
room
and
did
not
move
.
First
she
heard
*NL*
her
mother
praying
and
sighing
and
the
creaking
of
her
bed
under
her
,
*NL*
then
Madame
Schoss
'
familiar
whistling
snore
and
Sonya
's
gentle
*NL*
breathing
.
Then
the
countess
called
to
Natasha
.
Natasha
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
's
asleep
,
Mamma
,
''
said
Sonya
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
silence
the
countess
spoke
again
but
this
time
no
one
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
that
Natasha
heard
her
mother
's
even
breathing
.
Natasha
did
*NL*
not
move
,
though
her
little
bare
foot
,
thrust
out
from
under
the
quilt
,
*NL*
was
growing
cold
on
the
bare
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
to
celebrate
a
victory
over
everybody
,
a
cricket
chirped
in
a
*NL*
crack
in
the
wall
.
A
cock
crowed
far
off
and
another
replied
near
by
.
*NL*
The
shouting
in
the
tavern
had
died
down
;
only
the
moaning
of
the
*NL*
adjutant
was
heard
.
Natasha
sat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
are
you
asleep
?
Mamma
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
.
Natasha
rose
slowly
and
carefully
,
crossed
herself
,
and
*NL*
stepped
cautiously
on
the
cold
and
dirty
floor
with
her
slim
,
supple
,
*NL*
bare
feet
.
The
boards
of
the
floor
creaked
.
Stepping
cautiously
from
one
*NL*
foot
to
the
other
she
ran
like
a
kitten
the
few
steps
to
the
door
and
*NL*
grasped
the
cold
door
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
that
something
heavy
was
beating
rhythmically
against
*NL*
all
the
walls
of
the
room
:
it
was
her
own
heart
,
sinking
with
alarm
and
*NL*
terror
and
overflowing
with
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
the
door
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
onto
the
cold
,
*NL*
damp
earthen
floor
of
the
passage
.
The
cold
she
felt
refreshed
her
.
With
*NL*
her
bare
feet
she
touched
a
sleeping
man
,
stepped
over
him
,
and
opened
*NL*
the
door
into
the
part
of
the
hut
where
Prince
Andrew
lay
.
It
was
dark
*NL*
in
there
.
In
the
farthest
corner
,
on
a
bench
beside
a
bed
on
which
*NL*
something
was
lying
,
stood
a
tallow
candle
with
a
long
,
thick
,
and
*NL*
smoldering
wick
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
she
had
been
told
that
morning
of
Prince
Andrew
's
wound
*NL*
and
his
presence
there
,
Natasha
had
resolved
to
see
him
.
She
did
not
*NL*
know
why
she
had
to
,
she
knew
the
meeting
would
be
painful
,
but
felt
the
*NL*
more
convinced
that
it
was
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
she
had
lived
only
in
hope
of
seeing
him
that
night
.
But
now
*NL*
that
the
moment
had
come
she
was
filled
with
dread
of
what
she
might
*NL*
see
.
How
was
he
maimed
?
What
was
left
of
him
?
Was
he
like
that
incessant
*NL*
moaning
of
the
adjutant
's
?
Yes
,
he
was
altogether
like
that
.
In
her
*NL*
imagination
he
was
that
terrible
moaning
personified
.
When
she
saw
an
*NL*
indistinct
shape
in
the
corner
,
and
mistook
his
knees
raised
under
the
*NL*
quilt
for
his
shoulders
,
she
imagined
a
horrible
body
there
,
and
stood
*NL*
still
in
terror
.
But
an
irresistible
impulse
drew
her
forward
.
She
*NL*
cautiously
took
one
step
and
then
another
,
and
found
herself
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
small
room
containing
baggage
.
Another
man
--
Timokhin
--
was
*NL*
lying
in
a
corner
on
the
benches
beneath
the
icons
,
and
two
others
--
the
*NL*
doctor
and
a
valet
--
lay
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
sat
up
and
whispered
something
.
Timokhin
,
kept
awake
by
the
*NL*
pain
in
his
wounded
leg
,
gazed
with
wide-open
eyes
at
this
strange
*NL*
apparition
of
a
girl
in
a
white
chemise
,
dressing
jacket
,
and
nightcap
.
*NL*
The
valet
's
sleepy
,
frightened
exclamation
,
``
What
do
you
want
?
What
's
*NL*
the
matter
?
''
made
Natasha
approach
more
swiftly
to
what
was
lying
in
the
*NL*
corner
.
Horribly
unlike
a
man
as
that
body
looked
,
she
must
see
him
.
She
*NL*
passed
the
valet
,
the
snuff
fell
from
the
candle
wick
,
and
she
saw
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
clearly
with
his
arms
outside
the
quilt
,
and
such
as
she
*NL*
had
always
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
same
as
ever
,
but
the
feverish
color
of
his
face
,
his
*NL*
glittering
eyes
rapturously
turned
toward
her
,
and
especially
his
neck
,
*NL*
delicate
as
a
child
's
,
revealed
by
the
turn-down
collar
of
his
shirt
,
*NL*
gave
him
a
peculiarly
innocent
,
childlike
look
,
such
as
she
had
never
*NL*
seen
on
him
before
.
She
went
up
to
him
and
with
a
swift
,
flexible
,
*NL*
youthful
movement
dropped
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
days
had
passed
since
Prince
Andrew
found
himself
in
the
ambulance
*NL*
station
on
the
field
of
Borodino
.
His
feverish
state
and
the
*NL*
inflammation
of
his
bowels
,
which
were
injured
,
were
in
the
doctor
's
*NL*
opinion
sure
to
carry
him
off
.
But
on
the
seventh
day
he
ate
with
*NL*
pleasure
a
piece
of
bread
with
some
tea
,
and
the
doctor
noticed
that
his
*NL*
temperature
was
lower
.
He
had
regained
consciousness
that
morning
.
The
*NL*
first
night
after
they
left
Moscow
had
been
fairly
warm
and
he
had
*NL*
remained
in
the
caleche
,
but
at
Mytishchi
the
wounded
man
himself
asked
*NL*
to
be
taken
out
and
given
some
tea
.
The
pain
caused
by
his
removal
into
*NL*
the
hut
had
made
him
groan
aloud
and
again
lose
consciousness
.
When
he
*NL*
had
been
placed
on
his
camp
bed
he
lay
for
a
long
time
motionless
with
*NL*
closed
eyes
.
Then
he
opened
them
and
whispered
softly
:
``
And
the
tea
?
''
*NL*
His
remembering
such
a
small
detail
of
everyday
life
astonished
the
*NL*
doctor
.
He
felt
Prince
Andrew
's
pulse
,
and
to
his
surprise
and
*NL*
dissatisfaction
found
it
had
improved
.
He
was
dissatisfied
because
he
*NL*
knew
by
experience
that
if
his
patient
did
not
die
now
,
he
would
do
so
a
*NL*
little
later
with
greater
suffering
.
Timokhin
,
the
red-nosed
major
of
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
regiment
,
had
joined
him
in
Moscow
and
was
being
taken
*NL*
along
with
him
,
having
been
wounded
in
the
leg
at
the
battle
of
*NL*
Borodino
.
They
were
accompanied
by
a
doctor
,
Prince
Andrew
's
valet
,
his
*NL*
coachman
,
and
two
orderlies
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gave
Prince
Andrew
some
tea
.
He
drank
it
eagerly
,
looking
with
*NL*
feverish
eyes
at
the
door
in
front
of
him
as
if
trying
to
understand
and
*NL*
remember
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
more
.
Is
Timokhin
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Timokhin
crept
along
the
bench
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
,
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
your
wound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
sir
?
All
right
.
But
how
about
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
again
pondered
as
if
trying
to
remember
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
one
get
a
book
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Gospels
.
I
have
n't
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
promised
to
procure
it
for
him
and
began
to
ask
how
he
was
*NL*
feeling
.
Prince
Andrew
answered
all
his
questions
reluctantly
but
*NL*
reasonably
,
and
then
said
he
wanted
a
bolster
placed
under
him
as
he
was
*NL*
uncomfortable
and
in
great
pain
.
The
doctor
and
valet
lifted
the
cloak
*NL*
with
which
he
was
covered
and
,
making
wry
faces
at
the
noisome
smell
of
*NL*
mortifying
flesh
that
came
from
the
wound
,
began
examining
that
dreadful
*NL*
place
.
The
doctor
was
very
much
displeased
about
something
and
made
a
*NL*
change
in
the
dressings
,
turning
the
wounded
man
over
so
that
he
groaned
*NL*
again
and
grew
unconscious
and
delirious
from
the
agony
.
He
kept
asking
*NL*
them
to
get
him
the
book
and
put
it
under
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
trouble
would
it
be
to
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
not
got
one
.
Please
*NL*
get
it
for
me
and
put
it
under
for
a
moment
,
''
he
pleaded
in
a
piteous
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
went
into
the
passage
to
wash
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fellows
have
no
conscience
,
''
said
he
to
the
valet
who
was
pouring
*NL*
water
over
his
hands
.
``
For
just
one
moment
I
did
n't
look
after
you
...
*NL*
It
's
such
pain
,
you
know
,
that
I
wonder
how
he
can
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
I
thought
we
had
put
something
under
him
!
''
*NL*
said
the
valet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
Prince
Andrew
understood
where
he
was
and
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
with
him
and
remembered
being
wounded
and
how
was
when
he
asked
*NL*
to
be
carried
into
the
hut
after
his
caleche
had
stopped
at
Mytishchi
.
*NL*
After
growing
confused
from
pain
while
being
carried
into
the
hut
he
*NL*
again
regained
consciousness
,
and
while
drinking
tea
once
more
recalled
*NL*
all
that
had
happened
to
him
,
and
above
all
vividly
remembered
the
*NL*
moment
at
the
ambulance
station
when
,
at
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
*NL*
a
man
he
disliked
,
those
new
thoughts
had
come
to
him
which
promised
him
*NL*
happiness
.
And
those
thoughts
,
though
now
vague
and
indefinite
,
again
*NL*
possessed
his
soul
.
He
remembered
that
he
had
now
a
new
source
of
*NL*
happiness
and
that
this
happiness
had
something
to
do
with
the
Gospels
.
*NL*
That
was
why
he
asked
for
a
copy
of
them
.
The
uncomfortable
position
in
*NL*
which
they
had
put
him
and
turned
him
over
again
confused
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
and
when
he
came
to
himself
a
third
time
it
was
in
the
complete
*NL*
stillness
of
the
night
.
Everybody
near
him
was
sleeping
.
A
cricket
*NL*
chirped
from
across
the
passage
;
someone
was
shouting
and
singing
in
the
*NL*
street
;
cockroaches
rustled
on
the
table
,
on
the
icons
,
and
on
the
*NL*
walls
,
and
a
big
fly
flopped
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
around
the
*NL*
candle
beside
him
,
the
wick
of
which
was
charred
and
had
shaped
itself
*NL*
like
a
mushroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
not
in
a
normal
state
.
A
healthy
man
usually
thinks
of
,
*NL*
feels
,
and
remembers
innumerable
things
simultaneously
,
but
has
the
*NL*
power
and
will
to
select
one
sequence
of
thoughts
or
events
on
which
to
*NL*
fix
his
whole
attention
.
A
healthy
man
can
tear
himself
away
from
the
*NL*
deepest
reflections
to
say
a
civil
word
to
someone
who
comes
in
and
can
*NL*
then
return
again
to
his
own
thoughts
.
But
Prince
Andrew
's
mind
was
not
*NL*
in
a
normal
state
in
that
respect
.
All
the
powers
of
his
mind
were
more
*NL*
active
and
clearer
than
ever
,
but
they
acted
apart
from
his
will
.
Most
*NL*
diverse
thoughts
and
images
occupied
him
simultaneously
.
At
times
his
*NL*
brain
suddenly
began
to
work
with
a
vigor
,
clearness
,
and
depth
it
had
*NL*
never
reached
when
he
was
in
health
,
but
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
its
*NL*
work
it
would
turn
to
some
unexpected
idea
and
he
had
not
the
strength
*NL*
to
turn
it
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
new
happiness
was
revealed
to
me
of
which
man
can
not
be
*NL*
deprived
,
''
he
thought
as
he
lay
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
quiet
hut
,
*NL*
gazing
fixedly
before
him
with
feverish
wide
open
eyes
.
``
A
happiness
*NL*
lying
beyond
material
forces
,
outside
the
material
influences
that
act
*NL*
on
man
--
a
happiness
of
the
soul
alone
,
the
happiness
of
loving
.
Every
*NL*
man
can
understand
it
,
but
to
conceive
it
and
enjoin
it
was
possible
*NL*
only
for
God
.
But
how
did
God
enjoin
that
law
?
And
why
was
the
Son
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
the
sequence
of
these
thoughts
broke
off
,
and
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
heard
-LRB-
without
knowing
whether
it
was
a
delusion
or
reality
-RRB-
a
soft
*NL*
whispering
voice
incessantly
and
rhythmically
repeating
``
piti-piti
-
*NL*
piti
,
''
and
then
``
titi
,
''
and
then
again
``
piti-piti-piti
,
''
and
``
ti-ti
''
*NL*
once
more
.
At
the
same
time
he
felt
that
above
his
face
,
above
the
very
*NL*
middle
of
it
,
some
strange
airy
structure
was
being
erected
out
of
*NL*
slender
needles
or
splinters
,
to
the
sound
of
this
whispered
music
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
he
had
to
balance
carefully
-LRB-
though
it
was
difficult
-RRB-
so
that
*NL*
this
airy
structure
should
not
collapse
;
but
nevertheless
it
kept
*NL*
collapsing
and
again
slowly
rising
to
the
sound
of
whispered
rhythmic
*NL*
music
--
``
it
stretches
,
stretches
,
spreading
out
and
stretching
,
''
said
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
to
himself
.
While
listening
to
this
whispering
and
feeling
*NL*
the
sensation
of
this
drawing
out
and
the
construction
of
this
edifice
*NL*
of
needles
,
he
also
saw
by
glimpses
a
red
halo
round
the
candle
,
and
*NL*
heard
the
rustle
of
the
cockroaches
and
the
buzzing
of
the
fly
that
*NL*
flopped
against
his
pillow
and
his
face
.
Each
time
the
fly
touched
his
*NL*
face
it
gave
him
a
burning
sensation
and
yet
to
his
surprise
it
did
not
*NL*
destroy
the
structure
,
though
it
knocked
against
the
very
region
of
his
*NL*
face
where
it
was
rising
.
But
besides
this
there
was
something
else
of
*NL*
importance
.
It
was
something
white
by
the
door
--
the
statue
of
a
sphinx
,
*NL*
which
also
oppressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
that
's
my
shirt
on
the
table
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
that
's
my
*NL*
legs
,
and
that
is
the
door
,
but
why
is
it
always
stretching
and
drawing
*NL*
itself
out
,
and
`
piti-piti-piti
'
and
`
ti-ti
'
and
`
piti-piti-piti
'
...
?
*NL*
That
's
enough
,
please
leave
off
!
''
Prince
Andrew
painfully
entreated
*NL*
someone
.
And
suddenly
thoughts
and
feelings
again
swam
to
the
surface
of
*NL*
his
mind
with
peculiar
clearness
and
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
love
,
''
he
thought
again
quite
clearly
.
``
But
not
love
which
loves
*NL*
for
something
,
for
some
quality
,
for
some
purpose
,
or
for
some
reason
,
*NL*
but
the
love
which
I
--
while
dying
--
first
experienced
when
I
saw
my
enemy
*NL*
and
yet
loved
him
.
I
experienced
that
feeling
of
love
which
is
the
very
*NL*
essence
of
the
soul
and
does
not
require
an
object
.
Now
again
I
feel
*NL*
that
bliss
.
To
love
one
's
neighbors
,
to
love
one
's
enemies
,
to
love
*NL*
everything
,
to
love
God
in
all
His
manifestations
.
It
is
possible
to
*NL*
love
someone
dear
to
you
with
human
love
,
but
an
enemy
can
only
be
loved
*NL*
by
divine
love
.
That
is
why
I
experienced
such
joy
when
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
loved
that
man
.
What
has
become
of
him
?
Is
he
alive
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
loving
with
human
love
one
may
pass
from
love
to
hatred
,
but
*NL*
divine
love
can
not
change
.
No
,
neither
death
nor
anything
else
can
*NL*
destroy
it
.
It
is
the
very
essence
of
the
soul
.
Yet
how
many
people
have
*NL*
I
hated
in
my
life
?
And
of
them
all
,
I
loved
and
hated
none
as
I
did
*NL*
her
.
''
And
he
vividly
pictured
to
himself
Natasha
,
not
as
he
had
done
in
*NL*
the
past
with
nothing
but
her
charms
which
gave
him
delight
,
but
for
the
*NL*
first
time
picturing
to
himself
her
soul
.
And
he
understood
her
*NL*
feelings
,
her
sufferings
,
shame
,
and
remorse
.
He
now
understood
for
the
*NL*
first
time
all
the
cruelty
of
his
rejection
of
her
,
the
cruelty
of
his
*NL*
rupture
with
her
.
``
If
only
it
were
possible
for
me
to
see
her
once
more
!
*NL*
Just
once
,
looking
into
those
eyes
to
say
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Piti-piti-piti
and
ti-ti
and
piti-piti-piti
boom
!
''
flopped
the
fly
...
*NL*
And
his
attention
was
suddenly
carried
into
another
world
,
a
world
of
*NL*
reality
and
delirium
in
which
something
particular
was
happening
.
In
*NL*
that
world
some
structure
was
still
being
erected
and
did
not
fall
,
*NL*
something
was
still
stretching
out
,
and
the
candle
with
its
red
halo
was
*NL*
still
burning
,
and
the
same
shirtlike
sphinx
lay
near
the
door
;
but
*NL*
besides
all
this
something
creaked
,
there
was
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
,
and
*NL*
a
new
white
sphinx
appeared
,
standing
at
the
door
.
And
that
sphinx
had
*NL*
the
pale
face
and
shining
eyes
of
the
very
Natasha
of
whom
he
had
just
*NL*
been
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
oppressive
this
continual
delirium
is
,
''
thought
Prince
Andrew
,
*NL*
trying
to
drive
that
face
from
his
imagination
.
But
the
face
remained
*NL*
before
him
with
the
force
of
reality
and
drew
nearer
.
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
wished
to
return
to
that
former
world
of
pure
thought
,
but
he
could
not
,
*NL*
and
delirium
drew
him
back
into
its
domain
.
The
soft
whispering
voice
*NL*
continued
its
rhythmic
murmur
,
something
oppressed
him
and
stretched
*NL*
out
,
and
the
strange
face
was
before
him
.
Prince
Andrew
collected
all
*NL*
his
strength
in
an
effort
to
recover
his
senses
,
he
moved
a
little
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
there
was
a
ringing
in
his
ears
,
a
dimness
in
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
like
a
man
plunged
into
water
he
lost
consciousness
.
When
he
came
to
*NL*
himself
,
Natasha
,
that
same
living
Natasha
whom
of
all
people
he
most
*NL*
longed
to
love
with
this
new
pure
divine
love
that
had
been
revealed
to
*NL*
him
,
was
kneeling
before
him
.
He
realized
that
it
was
the
real
living
*NL*
Natasha
,
and
he
was
not
surprised
but
quietly
happy
.
Natasha
,
motionless
*NL*
on
her
knees
-LRB-
she
was
unable
to
stir
-RRB-
,
with
frightened
eyes
riveted
on
*NL*
him
,
was
restraining
her
sobs
.
Her
face
was
pale
and
rigid
.
Only
in
the
*NL*
lower
part
of
it
something
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
sighed
with
relief
,
smiled
,
and
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
he
said
.
``
How
fortunate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
rapid
but
careful
movement
Natasha
drew
nearer
to
him
on
her
*NL*
knees
and
,
taking
his
hand
carefully
,
bent
her
face
over
it
and
began
*NL*
kissing
it
,
just
touching
it
lightly
with
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
!
''
she
whispered
,
raising
her
head
and
glancing
at
him
.
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
...
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
what
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
what
I
ha-ve
do-ne
!
''
faltered
Natasha
in
a
scarcely
*NL*
audible
,
broken
whisper
,
and
began
kissing
his
hand
more
rapidly
,
just
*NL*
touching
it
with
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
more
,
better
than
before
,
''
said
Prince
Andrew
,
lifting
her
*NL*
face
with
his
hand
so
as
to
look
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
eyes
,
filled
with
happy
tears
,
gazed
at
him
timidly
,
*NL*
compassionately
,
and
with
joyous
love
.
Natasha
's
thin
pale
face
,
with
*NL*
its
swollen
lips
,
was
more
than
plain
--
it
was
dreadful
.
But
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
did
not
see
that
,
he
saw
her
shining
eyes
which
were
beautiful
.
*NL*
They
heard
the
sound
of
voices
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
the
valet
,
who
was
now
wide
awake
,
had
roused
the
doctor
.
*NL*
Timokhin
,
who
had
not
slept
at
all
because
of
the
pain
in
his
leg
,
had
*NL*
long
been
watching
all
that
was
going
on
,
carefully
covering
his
bare
*NL*
body
with
the
sheet
as
he
huddled
up
on
his
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
said
the
doctor
,
rising
from
his
bed
.
``
Please
go
away
,
*NL*
madam
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
maid
sent
by
the
countess
,
who
had
noticed
her
*NL*
daughter
's
absence
,
knocked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
somnambulist
aroused
from
her
sleep
Natasha
went
out
of
the
room
*NL*
and
,
returning
to
her
hut
,
fell
sobbing
on
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
,
during
all
the
rest
of
the
Rostovs
'
journey
,
at
every
*NL*
halting
place
and
wherever
they
spent
a
night
,
Natasha
never
left
the
*NL*
wounded
Bolkonski
,
and
the
doctor
had
to
admit
that
he
had
not
expected
*NL*
from
a
young
girl
either
such
firmness
or
such
skill
in
nursing
a
*NL*
wounded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dreadful
as
the
countess
imagined
it
would
be
should
Prince
Andrew
die
*NL*
in
her
daughter
's
arms
during
the
journey
--
as
,
judging
by
what
the
*NL*
doctor
said
,
it
seemed
might
easily
happen
--
she
could
not
oppose
*NL*
Natasha
.
Though
with
the
intimacy
now
established
between
the
wounded
*NL*
man
and
Natasha
the
thought
occurred
that
should
he
recover
their
former
*NL*
engagement
would
be
renewed
,
no
one
--
least
of
all
Natasha
and
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
--
spoke
of
this
:
the
unsettled
question
of
life
and
death
,
which
*NL*
hung
not
only
over
Bolkonski
but
over
all
Russia
,
shut
out
all
other
*NL*
considerations
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
of
September
Pierre
awoke
late
.
His
head
was
aching
,
the
*NL*
clothes
in
which
he
had
slept
without
undressing
felt
uncomfortable
on
*NL*
his
body
,
and
his
mind
had
a
dim
consciousness
of
something
shameful
he
*NL*
had
done
the
day
before
.
That
something
shameful
was
his
yesterday
's
*NL*
conversation
with
Captain
Ramballe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eleven
by
the
clock
,
but
it
seemed
peculiarly
dark
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
Pierre
rose
,
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
seeing
the
pistol
with
an
engraved
*NL*
stock
which
Gerasim
had
replaced
on
the
writing
table
,
he
remembered
*NL*
where
he
was
and
what
lay
before
him
that
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
not
too
late
?
''
he
thought
.
``
No
,
probably
he
wo
n't
make
his
entry
*NL*
into
Moscow
before
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
allow
himself
to
reflect
on
what
lay
before
him
,
but
*NL*
hastened
to
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
arranging
his
clothes
,
he
took
the
pistol
and
was
about
to
go
out
.
*NL*
But
it
then
occurred
to
him
for
the
first
time
that
he
certainly
could
*NL*
not
carry
the
weapon
in
his
hand
through
the
streets
.
It
was
difficult
*NL*
to
hide
such
a
big
pistol
even
under
his
wide
coat
.
He
could
not
carry
*NL*
it
unnoticed
in
his
belt
or
under
his
arm
.
Besides
,
it
had
been
*NL*
discharged
,
and
he
had
not
had
time
to
reload
it
.
``
No
matter
,
dagger
*NL*
will
do
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
though
when
planning
his
design
he
had
*NL*
more
than
once
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chief
mistake
made
by
the
*NL*
student
in
1809
had
been
to
try
to
kill
Napoleon
with
a
dagger
.
But
as
*NL*
his
chief
aim
consisted
not
in
carrying
out
his
design
,
but
in
proving
*NL*
to
himself
that
he
would
not
abandon
his
intention
and
was
doing
all
he
*NL*
could
to
achieve
it
,
Pierre
hastily
took
the
blunt
jagged
dagger
in
a
*NL*
green
sheath
which
he
had
bought
at
the
Sukharev
market
with
the
pistol
,
*NL*
and
hid
it
under
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
tied
a
girdle
over
his
coat
and
pulled
his
cap
low
on
his
head
,
*NL*
Pierre
went
down
the
corridor
,
trying
to
avoid
making
a
noise
or
meeting
*NL*
the
captain
,
and
passed
out
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conflagration
,
at
which
he
had
looked
with
so
much
indifference
the
*NL*
evening
before
,
had
greatly
increased
during
the
night
.
Moscow
was
on
*NL*
fire
in
several
places
.
The
buildings
in
Carriage
Row
,
across
the
river
,
*NL*
in
the
Bazaar
and
the
Povarskoy
,
as
well
as
the
barges
on
the
Moskva
*NL*
River
and
the
timber
yards
by
the
Dorogomilov
Bridge
,
were
all
ablaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
way
led
through
side
streets
to
the
Povarskoy
and
from
there
to
*NL*
the
church
of
St.
Nicholas
on
the
Arbat
,
where
he
had
long
before
*NL*
decided
that
the
deed
should
be
done
.
The
gates
of
most
of
the
houses
*NL*
were
locked
and
the
shutters
up
.
The
streets
and
lanes
were
deserted
.
*NL*
The
air
was
full
of
smoke
and
the
smell
of
burning
.
Now
and
then
he
met
*NL*
Russians
with
anxious
and
timid
faces
,
and
Frenchmen
with
an
air
not
of
*NL*
the
city
but
of
the
camp
,
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
streets
.
Both
the
*NL*
Russians
and
the
French
looked
at
Pierre
with
surprise
.
Besides
his
*NL*
height
and
stoutness
,
and
the
strange
morose
look
of
suffering
in
his
*NL*
face
and
whole
figure
,
the
Russians
stared
at
Pierre
because
they
could
*NL*
not
make
out
to
what
class
he
could
belong
.
The
French
followed
him
with
*NL*
astonishment
in
their
eyes
chiefly
because
Pierre
,
unlike
all
the
other
*NL*
Russians
who
gazed
at
the
French
with
fear
and
curiosity
,
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
them
.
At
the
gate
of
one
house
three
Frenchmen
,
who
were
*NL*
explaining
something
to
some
Russians
who
did
not
understand
them
,
*NL*
stopped
Pierre
asking
if
he
did
not
know
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
shook
his
head
and
went
on
.
In
another
side
street
a
sentinel
*NL*
standing
beside
a
green
caisson
shouted
at
him
,
but
only
when
the
shout
*NL*
was
threateningly
repeated
and
he
heard
the
click
of
the
man
's
musket
as
*NL*
he
raised
it
did
Pierre
understand
that
he
had
to
pass
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
street
.
He
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
of
what
went
on
around
*NL*
him
.
He
carried
his
resolution
within
himself
in
terror
and
haste
,
like
*NL*
something
dreadful
and
alien
to
him
,
for
,
after
the
previous
night
's
*NL*
experience
,
he
was
afraid
of
losing
it
.
But
he
was
not
destined
to
bring
*NL*
his
mood
safely
to
his
destination
.
And
even
had
he
not
been
hindered
by
*NL*
anything
on
the
way
,
his
intention
could
not
now
have
been
carried
out
,
*NL*
for
Napoleon
had
passed
the
Arbat
more
than
four
hours
previously
on
his
*NL*
way
from
the
Dorogomilov
suburb
to
the
Kremlin
,
and
was
now
sitting
in
a
*NL*
very
gloomy
frame
of
mind
in
a
royal
study
in
the
Kremlin
,
giving
*NL*
detailed
and
exact
orders
as
to
measures
to
be
taken
immediately
to
*NL*
extinguish
the
fire
,
to
prevent
looting
,
and
to
reassure
the
*NL*
inhabitants
.
But
Pierre
did
not
know
this
;
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
*NL*
what
lay
before
him
,
and
was
tortured
--
as
those
are
who
obstinately
*NL*
undertake
a
task
that
is
impossible
for
them
not
because
of
its
*NL*
difficulty
but
because
of
its
incompatibility
with
their
natures
--
by
the
*NL*
fear
of
weakening
at
the
decisive
moment
and
so
losing
his
self-esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
around
him
he
found
his
way
by
instinct
*NL*
and
did
not
go
wrong
in
the
side
streets
that
led
to
the
Povarskoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Pierre
approached
that
street
the
smoke
became
denser
and
denser
--
he
*NL*
even
felt
the
heat
of
the
fire
.
Occasionally
curly
tongues
of
flame
rose
*NL*
from
under
the
roofs
of
the
houses
.
He
met
more
people
in
the
streets
*NL*
and
they
were
more
excited
.
But
Pierre
,
though
he
felt
that
something
*NL*
unusual
was
happening
around
him
,
did
not
realize
that
he
was
*NL*
approaching
the
fire
.
As
he
was
going
along
a
foot
path
across
a
wide
-
*NL*
open
space
adjoining
the
Povarskoy
on
one
side
and
the
gardens
of
Prince
*NL*
Gruzinski
's
house
on
the
other
,
Pierre
suddenly
heard
the
desperate
*NL*
weeping
of
a
woman
close
to
him
.
He
stopped
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
*NL*
and
lifted
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
side
of
the
path
,
on
the
dusty
dry
grass
,
all
sorts
of
household
*NL*
goods
lay
in
a
heap
:
featherbeds
,
a
samovar
,
icons
,
and
trunks
.
On
the
*NL*
ground
,
beside
the
trunks
,
sat
a
thin
woman
no
longer
young
,
with
long
,
*NL*
prominent
upper
teeth
,
and
wearing
a
black
cloak
and
cap
.
This
woman
,
*NL*
swaying
to
and
fro
and
muttering
something
,
was
choking
with
sobs
.
Two
*NL*
girls
of
about
ten
and
twelve
,
dressed
in
dirty
short
frocks
and
cloaks
,
*NL*
were
staring
at
their
mother
with
a
look
of
stupefaction
on
their
pale
*NL*
frightened
faces
.
The
youngest
child
,
a
boy
of
about
seven
,
who
wore
an
*NL*
overcoat
and
an
immense
cap
evidently
not
his
own
,
was
crying
in
his
old
*NL*
nurse
's
arms
.
A
dirty
,
barefooted
maid
was
sitting
on
a
trunk
,
and
,
*NL*
having
undone
her
pale-colored
plait
,
was
pulling
it
straight
and
*NL*
sniffing
at
her
singed
hair
.
The
woman
's
husband
,
a
short
,
round
-
*NL*
shouldered
man
in
the
undress
uniform
of
a
civilian
official
,
with
*NL*
sausage-shaped
whiskers
and
showing
under
his
square-set
cap
the
hair
*NL*
smoothly
brushed
forward
over
his
temples
,
with
expressionless
face
was
*NL*
moving
the
trunks
,
which
were
placed
one
on
another
,
and
was
dragging
*NL*
some
garments
from
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
saw
Pierre
,
the
woman
almost
threw
herself
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
people
,
good
Christians
,
save
me
,
help
me
,
dear
friends
...
help
*NL*
us
,
somebody
,
''
she
muttered
between
her
sobs
.
``
My
girl
...
My
daughter
!
*NL*
My
youngest
daughter
is
left
behind
.
She
's
burned
!
Ooh
!
Was
it
for
this
*NL*
I
nursed
you
...
Ooh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
Mary
Nikolievna
!
''
said
her
husband
to
her
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
evidently
only
to
justify
himself
before
the
stranger
.
``
Sister
must
have
*NL*
taken
her
,
or
else
where
can
she
be
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monster
!
Villain
!
''
shouted
the
woman
angrily
,
suddenly
ceasing
to
weep
.
*NL*
``
You
have
no
heart
,
you
do
n't
feel
for
your
own
child
!
Another
man
would
*NL*
have
rescued
her
from
the
fire
.
But
this
is
a
monster
and
neither
a
man
*NL*
nor
a
father
!
You
,
honored
sir
,
are
a
noble
man
,
''
she
went
on
,
*NL*
addressing
Pierre
rapidly
between
her
sobs
.
``
The
fire
broke
out
*NL*
alongside
,
and
blew
our
way
,
the
maid
called
out
`
Fire
!
'
and
we
rushed
*NL*
to
collect
our
things
.
We
ran
out
just
as
we
were
...
This
is
what
we
*NL*
have
brought
away
...
The
icons
,
and
my
dowry
bed
,
all
the
rest
is
lost
.
*NL*
We
seized
the
children
.
But
not
Katie
!
Ooh
!
O
Lord
!
...
''
and
again
she
*NL*
began
to
sob
.
``
My
child
,
my
dear
one
!
Burned
,
burned
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
was
she
left
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
expression
of
his
animated
face
the
woman
saw
that
this
man
*NL*
might
help
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
sir
!
''
she
cried
,
seizing
him
by
the
legs
.
``
My
benefactor
,
set
*NL*
my
heart
at
ease
...
Aniska
,
go
,
you
horrid
girl
,
show
him
the
way
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
to
the
maid
,
angrily
opening
her
mouth
and
still
farther
exposing
*NL*
her
long
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
me
the
way
,
show
me
,
I.
.
.
I
'll
do
it
,
''
gasped
Pierre
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dirty
maidservant
stepped
from
behind
the
trunk
,
put
up
her
plait
,
*NL*
sighed
,
and
went
on
her
short
,
bare
feet
along
the
path
.
Pierre
felt
as
*NL*
if
he
had
come
back
to
life
after
a
heavy
swoon
.
He
held
his
head
*NL*
higher
,
his
eyes
shone
with
the
light
of
life
,
and
with
swift
steps
he
*NL*
followed
the
maid
,
overtook
her
,
and
came
out
on
the
Povarskoy
.
The
*NL*
whole
street
was
full
of
clouds
of
black
smoke
.
Tongues
of
flame
here
*NL*
and
there
broke
through
that
cloud
.
A
great
number
of
people
crowded
in
*NL*
front
of
the
conflagration
.
In
the
middle
of
the
street
stood
a
French
*NL*
general
saying
something
to
those
around
him
.
Pierre
,
accompanied
by
the
*NL*
maid
,
was
advancing
to
the
spot
where
the
general
stood
,
but
the
French
*NL*
soldiers
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
ne
passe
pas
!
''
*
cried
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
You
ca
n't
pass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
uncle
,
''
cried
the
girl
.
``
We
'll
pass
through
the
side
street
,
*NL*
by
the
Nikulins
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
turned
back
,
giving
a
spring
now
and
then
to
keep
up
with
her
.
*NL*
She
ran
across
the
street
,
turned
down
a
side
street
to
the
left
,
and
,
*NL*
passing
three
houses
,
turned
into
a
yard
on
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
here
,
close
by
,
''
said
she
and
,
running
across
the
yard
,
opened
a
*NL*
gate
in
a
wooden
fence
and
,
stopping
,
pointed
out
to
him
a
small
wooden
*NL*
wing
of
the
house
,
which
was
burning
brightly
and
fiercely
.
One
of
its
*NL*
sides
had
fallen
in
,
another
was
on
fire
,
and
bright
flames
issued
from
*NL*
the
openings
of
the
windows
and
from
under
the
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Pierre
passed
through
the
fence
gate
,
he
was
enveloped
by
hot
air
and
*NL*
involuntarily
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
it
?
Which
is
your
house
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ooh
!
''
wailed
the
girl
,
pointing
to
the
wing
.
``
That
's
it
,
that
was
our
*NL*
lodging
.
You
've
burned
to
death
,
our
treasure
,
Katie
,
my
precious
little
*NL*
missy
!
Ooh
!
''
lamented
Aniska
,
who
at
the
sight
of
the
fire
felt
that
she
*NL*
too
must
give
expression
to
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
rushed
to
the
wing
,
but
the
heat
was
so
great
that
he
*NL*
involuntarily
passed
round
in
a
curve
and
came
upon
the
large
house
that
*NL*
was
as
yet
burning
only
at
one
end
,
just
below
the
roof
,
and
around
*NL*
which
swarmed
a
crowd
of
Frenchmen
.
At
first
Pierre
did
not
realize
what
*NL*
these
men
,
who
were
dragging
something
out
,
were
about
;
but
seeing
*NL*
before
him
a
Frenchman
hitting
a
peasant
with
a
blunt
saber
and
trying
*NL*
to
take
from
him
a
fox-fur
coat
,
he
vaguely
understood
that
looting
was
*NL*
going
on
there
,
but
he
had
no
time
to
dwell
on
that
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
of
crackling
and
the
din
of
falling
walls
and
ceilings
,
the
*NL*
whistle
and
hiss
of
the
flames
,
the
excited
shouts
of
the
people
,
and
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
swaying
smoke
,
now
gathering
into
thick
black
clouds
*NL*
and
now
soaring
up
with
glittering
sparks
,
with
here
and
there
dense
*NL*
sheaves
of
flame
-LRB-
now
red
and
now
like
golden
fish
scales
creeping
along
*NL*
the
walls
-RRB-
,
and
the
heat
and
smoke
and
rapidity
of
motion
,
produced
on
*NL*
Pierre
the
usual
animating
effects
of
a
conflagration
.
It
had
a
*NL*
peculiarly
strong
effect
on
him
because
at
the
sight
of
the
fire
he
felt
*NL*
himself
suddenly
freed
from
the
ideas
that
had
weighed
him
down
.
He
felt
*NL*
young
,
bright
,
adroit
,
and
resolute
.
He
ran
round
to
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
lodge
and
was
about
to
dash
into
that
part
of
it
which
was
still
*NL*
standing
,
when
just
above
his
head
he
heard
several
voices
shouting
and
*NL*
then
a
cracking
sound
and
the
ring
of
something
heavy
falling
close
*NL*
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
up
and
saw
at
a
window
of
the
large
house
some
Frenchmen
*NL*
who
had
just
thrown
out
the
drawer
of
a
chest
,
filled
with
metal
*NL*
articles
.
Other
French
soldiers
standing
below
went
up
to
the
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
fellow
want
?
''
shouted
one
of
them
referring
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
child
in
that
house
.
Have
n't
you
seen
a
child
?
''
cried
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
he
talking
about
?
Get
along
!
''
said
several
voices
,
and
one
of
*NL*
the
soldiers
,
evidently
afraid
that
Pierre
might
want
to
take
from
them
*NL*
some
of
the
plate
and
bronzes
that
were
in
the
drawer
,
moved
*NL*
threateningly
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
child
?
''
shouted
a
Frenchman
from
above
.
``
I
did
hear
something
*NL*
squealing
in
the
garden
.
Perhaps
it
's
his
brat
that
the
fellow
is
*NL*
looking
for
.
After
all
,
one
must
be
human
,
you
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
?
Where
?
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
There
!
''
shouted
the
Frenchman
at
the
window
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
``
Wait
a
bit
--
I
'm
coming
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
minute
or
two
later
the
Frenchman
,
a
black-eyed
fellow
with
a
spot
*NL*
on
his
cheek
,
in
shirt
sleeves
,
really
did
jump
out
of
a
window
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
,
and
clapping
Pierre
on
the
shoulder
ran
with
him
into
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurry
up
,
you
others
!
''
he
called
out
to
his
comrades
.
``
It
's
getting
*NL*
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
a
gravel
path
behind
the
house
the
Frenchman
pulled
*NL*
Pierre
by
the
arm
and
pointed
to
a
round
,
graveled
space
where
a
three
-
*NL*
year-old
girl
in
a
pink
dress
was
lying
under
a
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
your
child
!
Oh
,
a
girl
,
so
much
the
better
!
''
said
the
*NL*
Frenchman
.
``
Good-bye
,
Fatty
.
We
must
be
human
,
we
are
all
mortal
you
*NL*
know
!
''
and
the
Frenchman
with
the
spot
on
his
cheek
ran
back
to
his
*NL*
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breathless
with
joy
,
Pierre
ran
to
the
little
girl
and
was
going
to
take
*NL*
her
in
his
arms
.
But
seeing
a
stranger
the
sickly
,
scrofulous-looking
*NL*
child
,
unattractively
like
her
mother
,
began
to
yell
and
run
away
.
*NL*
Pierre
,
however
,
seized
her
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
.
She
screamed
*NL*
desperately
and
angrily
and
tried
with
her
little
hands
to
pull
Pierre
's
*NL*
hands
away
and
to
bite
them
with
her
slobbering
mouth
.
Pierre
was
seized
*NL*
by
a
sense
of
horror
and
repulsion
such
as
he
had
experienced
when
*NL*
touching
some
nasty
little
animal
.
But
he
made
an
effort
not
to
throw
*NL*
the
child
down
and
ran
with
her
to
the
large
house
.
It
was
now
,
however
,
*NL*
impossible
to
get
back
the
way
he
had
come
;
the
maid
,
Aniska
,
was
no
*NL*
longer
there
,
and
Pierre
with
a
feeling
of
pity
and
disgust
pressed
the
*NL*
wet
,
painfully
sobbing
child
to
himself
as
tenderly
as
he
could
and
ran
*NL*
with
her
through
the
garden
seeking
another
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
Having
run
through
different
yards
and
side
streets
,
Pierre
got
back
*NL*
with
his
little
burden
to
the
Gruzinski
garden
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Povarskoy
.
He
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
place
from
which
he
had
set
*NL*
out
to
look
for
the
child
,
so
crowded
was
it
now
with
people
and
goods
*NL*
that
had
been
dragged
out
of
the
houses
.
Besides
Russian
families
who
*NL*
had
taken
refuge
here
from
the
fire
with
their
belongings
,
there
were
*NL*
several
French
soldiers
in
a
variety
of
clothing
.
Pierre
took
no
notice
*NL*
of
them
.
He
hurried
to
find
the
family
of
that
civil
servant
in
order
to
*NL*
restore
the
daughter
to
her
mother
and
go
to
save
someone
else
.
Pierre
*NL*
felt
that
he
had
still
much
to
do
and
to
do
quickly
.
Glowing
with
the
*NL*
heat
and
from
running
,
he
felt
at
that
moment
more
strongly
than
ever
*NL*
the
sense
of
youth
,
animation
,
and
determination
that
had
come
on
him
*NL*
when
he
ran
to
save
the
child
.
She
had
now
become
quiet
and
,
clinging
*NL*
with
her
little
hands
to
Pierre
's
coat
,
sat
on
his
arm
gazing
about
her
*NL*
like
some
little
wild
animal
.
He
glanced
at
her
occasionally
with
a
*NL*
slight
smile
.
He
fancied
he
saw
something
pathetically
innocent
in
that
*NL*
frightened
,
sickly
little
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
find
the
civil
servant
or
his
wife
where
he
had
left
them
.
He
*NL*
walked
among
the
crowd
with
rapid
steps
,
scanning
the
various
faces
he
*NL*
met
.
Involuntarily
he
noticed
a
Georgian
or
Armenian
family
consisting
*NL*
of
a
very
handsome
old
man
of
Oriental
type
,
wearing
a
new
,
cloth
-
*NL*
covered
,
sheepskin
coat
and
new
boots
,
an
old
woman
of
similar
type
,
and
*NL*
a
young
woman
.
That
very
young
woman
seemed
to
Pierre
the
perfection
of
*NL*
Oriental
beauty
,
with
her
sharply
outlined
,
arched
,
black
eyebrows
and
*NL*
the
extraordinarily
soft
,
bright
color
of
her
long
,
beautiful
,
*NL*
expressionless
face
.
Amid
the
scattered
property
and
the
crowd
on
the
*NL*
open
space
,
she
,
in
her
rich
satin
cloak
with
a
bright
lilac
shawl
on
*NL*
her
head
,
suggested
a
delicate
exotic
plant
thrown
out
onto
the
snow
.
*NL*
She
was
sitting
on
some
bundles
a
little
behind
the
old
woman
,
and
*NL*
looked
from
under
her
long
lashes
with
motionless
,
large
,
almond-shaped
*NL*
eyes
at
the
ground
before
her
.
Evidently
she
was
aware
of
her
beauty
and
*NL*
fearful
because
of
it
.
Her
face
struck
Pierre
and
,
hurrying
along
by
the
*NL*
fence
,
he
turned
several
times
to
look
at
her
.
When
he
had
reached
the
*NL*
fence
,
still
without
finding
those
he
sought
,
he
stopped
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
child
in
his
arms
his
figure
was
now
more
conspicuous
than
*NL*
before
,
and
a
group
of
Russians
,
both
men
and
women
,
gathered
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
lost
anyone
,
my
dear
fellow
?
You
're
of
the
gentry
yourself
,
*NL*
are
n't
you
?
Whose
child
is
it
?
''
they
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
replied
that
the
child
belonged
to
a
woman
in
a
black
coat
who
*NL*
had
been
sitting
there
with
her
other
children
,
and
he
asked
whether
*NL*
anyone
knew
where
she
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
must
be
the
Anferovs
,
''
said
an
old
deacon
,
addressing
a
*NL*
pockmarked
peasant
woman
.
``
Lord
have
mercy
,
Lord
have
mercy
!
''
he
added
*NL*
in
his
customary
bass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Anferovs
?
No
,
''
said
the
woman
.
``
They
left
in
the
morning
.
That
must
*NL*
be
either
Mary
Nikolievna
's
or
the
Ivanovs
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
'
a
woman
,
'
and
Mary
Nikolievna
is
a
lady
,
''
remarked
a
house
*NL*
serf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
her
?
She
's
thin
,
with
long
teeth
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Mary
Nikolievna
!
They
went
inside
the
garden
when
these
wolves
*NL*
swooped
down
,
''
said
the
woman
,
pointing
to
the
French
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
have
mercy
!
''
added
the
deacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
over
that
way
,
they
're
there
.
It
's
she
!
She
kept
on
lamenting
and
*NL*
crying
,
''
continued
the
woman
.
``
It
's
she
.
Here
,
this
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Pierre
was
not
listening
to
the
woman
.
He
had
for
some
seconds
been
*NL*
intently
watching
what
was
going
on
a
few
steps
away
.
He
was
looking
at
*NL*
the
Armenian
family
and
at
two
French
soldiers
who
had
gone
up
to
them
.
*NL*
One
of
these
,
a
nimble
little
man
,
was
wearing
a
blue
coat
tied
round
*NL*
the
waist
with
a
rope
.
He
had
a
nightcap
on
his
head
and
his
feet
were
*NL*
bare
.
The
other
,
whose
appearance
particularly
struck
Pierre
,
was
a
*NL*
long
,
lank
,
round-shouldered
,
fair-haired
man
,
slow
in
his
movements
and
*NL*
with
an
idiotic
expression
of
face
.
He
wore
a
woman
's
loose
gown
of
*NL*
frieze
,
blue
trousers
,
and
large
torn
Hessian
boots
.
The
little
*NL*
barefooted
Frenchman
in
the
blue
coat
went
up
to
the
Armenians
and
,
*NL*
saying
something
,
immediately
seized
the
old
man
by
his
legs
and
the
old
*NL*
man
at
once
began
pulling
off
his
boots
.
The
other
in
the
frieze
gown
*NL*
stopped
in
front
of
the
beautiful
Armenian
girl
and
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
stood
staring
at
her
,
motionless
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
take
the
child
!
''
said
Pierre
peremptorily
and
hurriedly
to
the
*NL*
woman
,
handing
the
little
girl
to
her
.
``
Give
her
back
to
them
,
give
her
*NL*
back
!
''
he
almost
shouted
,
putting
the
child
,
who
began
screaming
,
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
again
looking
at
the
Frenchman
and
the
Armenian
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
already
sitting
barefoot
.
The
little
Frenchman
had
*NL*
secured
his
second
boot
and
was
slapping
one
boot
against
the
other
.
The
*NL*
old
man
was
saying
something
in
a
voice
broken
by
sobs
,
but
Pierre
*NL*
caught
but
a
glimpse
of
this
,
his
whole
attention
was
directed
to
the
*NL*
Frenchman
in
the
frieze
gown
who
meanwhile
,
swaying
slowly
from
side
to
*NL*
side
,
had
drawn
nearer
to
the
young
woman
and
taking
his
hands
from
his
*NL*
pockets
had
seized
her
by
the
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beautiful
Armenian
still
sat
motionless
and
in
the
same
attitude
,
*NL*
with
her
long
lashes
drooping
as
if
she
did
not
see
or
feel
what
the
*NL*
soldier
was
doing
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Pierre
was
running
the
few
steps
that
separated
him
from
the
*NL*
Frenchman
,
the
tall
marauder
in
the
frieze
gown
was
already
tearing
from
*NL*
her
neck
the
necklace
the
young
Armenian
was
wearing
,
and
the
young
*NL*
woman
,
clutching
at
her
neck
,
screamed
piercingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
that
woman
alone
!
''
exclaimed
Pierre
hoarsely
in
a
furious
voice
,
*NL*
seizing
the
soldier
by
his
round
shoulders
and
throwing
him
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
fell
,
got
up
,
and
ran
away
.
But
his
comrade
,
throwing
down
*NL*
the
boots
and
drawing
his
sword
,
moved
threateningly
toward
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voyons
,
Pas
de
betises
!
''
*
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Look
here
,
no
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
in
such
a
transport
of
rage
that
he
remembered
nothing
and
*NL*
his
strength
increased
tenfold
.
He
rushed
at
the
barefooted
Frenchman
*NL*
and
,
before
the
latter
had
time
to
draw
his
sword
,
knocked
him
off
his
*NL*
feet
and
hammered
him
with
his
fists
.
Shouts
of
approval
were
heard
from
*NL*
the
crowd
around
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
mounted
patrol
of
French
*NL*
uhlans
appeared
from
round
the
corner
.
The
uhlans
came
up
at
a
trot
to
*NL*
Pierre
and
the
Frenchman
and
surrounded
them
.
Pierre
remembered
nothing
*NL*
of
what
happened
after
that
.
He
only
remembered
beating
someone
and
*NL*
being
beaten
and
finally
feeling
that
his
hands
were
bound
and
that
a
*NL*
crowd
of
French
soldiers
stood
around
him
and
were
searching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lieutenant
,
he
has
a
dagger
,
''
were
the
first
words
Pierre
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
a
weapon
?
''
said
the
officer
and
turned
to
the
barefooted
soldier
*NL*
who
had
been
arrested
with
Pierre
.
``
All
right
,
you
can
tell
all
about
it
*NL*
at
the
court-martial
.
''
Then
he
turned
to
Pierre
.
``
Do
you
speak
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
around
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
did
not
reply
.
His
face
*NL*
probably
looked
very
terrible
,
for
the
officer
said
something
in
a
*NL*
whisper
and
four
more
uhlans
left
the
ranks
and
placed
themselves
on
*NL*
both
sides
of
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
speak
French
?
''
the
officer
asked
again
,
keeping
at
a
distance
*NL*
from
Pierre
.
``
Call
the
interpreter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
man
in
Russian
civilian
clothes
rode
out
from
the
ranks
,
and
by
*NL*
his
clothes
and
manner
of
speaking
Pierre
at
once
knew
him
to
be
a
*NL*
French
salesman
from
one
of
the
Moscow
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
not
look
like
a
common
man
,
''
said
the
interpreter
,
after
a
*NL*
searching
look
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
looks
very
much
like
an
incendiary
,
''
remarked
the
officer
.
``
And
*NL*
ask
him
who
he
is
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
asked
the
interpreter
in
poor
Russian
.
``
You
must
answer
*NL*
the
chief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
tell
you
who
I
am
.
I
am
your
prisoner
--
take
me
!
''
Pierre
*NL*
suddenly
replied
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
muttered
the
officer
with
a
frown
.
``
Well
then
,
march
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
had
collected
round
the
uhlans
.
Nearest
to
Pierre
stood
the
*NL*
pockmarked
peasant
woman
with
the
little
girl
,
and
when
the
patrol
*NL*
started
she
moved
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
taking
you
to
,
you
poor
dear
?
''
said
she
.
``
And
the
little
*NL*
girl
,
the
little
girl
,
what
am
I
to
do
with
her
if
she
's
not
theirs
?
''
*NL*
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
woman
want
?
''
asked
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
as
if
intoxicated
.
His
elation
increased
at
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
little
girl
he
had
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
she
want
?
''
he
murmured
.
``
She
is
bringing
me
my
daughter
whom
*NL*
I
have
just
saved
from
the
flames
,
''
said
he
.
``
Good-bye
!
''
And
without
*NL*
knowing
how
this
aimless
lie
had
escaped
him
,
he
went
along
with
*NL*
resolute
and
triumphant
steps
between
the
French
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
patrol
was
one
of
those
sent
out
through
the
various
streets
*NL*
of
Moscow
by
Durosnel
's
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
pillage
,
and
*NL*
especially
to
catch
the
incendiaries
who
,
according
to
the
general
*NL*
opinion
which
had
that
day
originated
among
the
higher
French
officers
,
*NL*
were
the
cause
of
the
conflagrations
.
After
marching
through
a
number
of
*NL*
streets
the
patrol
arrested
five
more
Russian
suspects
:
a
small
*NL*
shopkeeper
,
two
seminary
students
,
a
peasant
,
and
a
house
serf
,
besides
*NL*
several
looters
.
But
of
all
these
various
suspected
characters
,
Pierre
*NL*
was
considered
to
be
the
most
suspicious
of
all
.
When
they
had
all
been
*NL*
brought
for
the
night
to
a
large
house
on
the
Zubov
Rampart
that
was
*NL*
being
used
as
a
guardhouse
,
Pierre
was
placed
apart
under
strict
guard
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
In
Petersburg
at
that
time
a
complicated
struggle
was
being
carried
on
*NL*
with
greater
heat
than
ever
in
the
highest
circles
,
between
the
parties
*NL*
of
Rumyantsev
,
the
French
,
Marya
Fedorovna
,
the
Tsarevich
,
and
others
,
*NL*
drowned
as
usual
by
the
buzzing
of
the
court
drones
.
But
the
calm
,
*NL*
luxurious
life
of
Petersburg
,
concerned
only
about
phantoms
and
*NL*
reflections
of
real
life
,
went
on
in
its
old
way
and
made
it
hard
,
*NL*
except
by
a
great
effort
,
to
realize
the
danger
and
the
difficult
*NL*
position
of
the
Russian
people
.
There
were
the
same
receptions
and
*NL*
balls
,
the
same
French
theater
,
the
same
court
interests
and
service
*NL*
interests
and
intrigues
as
usual
.
Only
in
the
very
highest
circles
were
*NL*
attempts
made
to
keep
in
mind
the
difficulties
of
the
actual
position
.
*NL*
Stories
were
whispered
of
how
differently
the
two
Empresses
behaved
in
*NL*
these
difficult
circumstances
.
The
Empress
Marya
,
concerned
for
the
*NL*
welfare
of
the
charitable
and
educational
institutions
under
her
*NL*
patronage
,
had
given
directions
that
they
should
all
be
removed
to
*NL*
Kazan
,
and
the
things
belonging
to
these
institutions
had
already
been
*NL*
packed
up
.
The
Empress
Elisabeth
,
however
,
when
asked
what
instructions
*NL*
she
would
be
pleased
to
give
--
with
her
characteristic
Russian
patriotism
*NL*
had
replied
that
she
could
give
no
directions
about
state
institutions
*NL*
for
that
was
the
affair
of
the
sovereign
,
but
as
far
as
she
personally
*NL*
was
concerned
she
would
be
the
last
to
quit
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Anna
Pavlovna
's
on
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
,
the
very
day
of
the
*NL*
battle
of
Borodino
,
there
was
a
soiree
,
the
chief
feature
of
which
was
*NL*
to
be
the
reading
of
a
letter
from
His
Lordship
the
Bishop
when
sending
*NL*
the
Emperor
an
icon
of
the
Venerable
Sergius
.
It
was
regarded
as
a
model
*NL*
of
ecclesiastical
,
patriotic
eloquence
.
Prince
Vasili
himself
,
famed
for
*NL*
his
elocution
,
was
to
read
it
.
-LRB-
He
used
to
read
at
the
Empress
'
.
-RRB-
The
*NL*
art
of
his
reading
was
supposed
to
lie
in
rolling
out
the
words
,
quite
*NL*
independently
of
their
meaning
,
in
a
loud
and
singsong
voice
alternating
*NL*
between
a
despairing
wail
and
a
tender
murmur
,
so
that
the
wail
fell
*NL*
quite
at
random
on
one
word
and
the
murmur
on
another
.
This
reading
,
as
*NL*
was
always
the
case
at
Anna
Pavlovna
's
soirees
,
had
a
political
*NL*
significance
.
That
evening
she
expected
several
important
personages
who
*NL*
had
to
be
made
ashamed
of
their
visits
to
the
French
theater
and
aroused
*NL*
to
a
patriotic
temper
.
A
good
many
people
had
already
arrived
,
but
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
,
not
yet
seeing
all
those
whom
she
wanted
in
her
drawing
room
,
*NL*
did
not
let
the
reading
begin
but
wound
up
the
springs
of
a
general
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
the
day
in
Petersburg
was
the
illness
of
Countess
Bezukhova
.
*NL*
She
had
fallen
ill
unexpectedly
a
few
days
previously
,
had
missed
*NL*
several
gatherings
of
which
she
was
usually
ornament
,
and
was
said
to
be
*NL*
receiving
no
one
,
and
instead
of
the
celebrated
Petersburg
doctors
who
*NL*
usually
attended
her
had
entrusted
herself
to
some
Italian
doctor
who
*NL*
was
treating
her
in
some
new
and
unusual
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
knew
very
well
that
the
enchanting
countess
'
illness
arose
from
*NL*
an
inconvenience
resulting
from
marrying
two
husbands
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
and
that
the
Italian
's
cure
consisted
in
removing
such
inconvenience
;
*NL*
but
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
presence
no
one
dared
to
think
of
this
or
even
*NL*
appear
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
the
poor
countess
is
very
ill
.
The
doctor
says
it
is
angina
*NL*
pectoris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angina
?
Oh
,
that
's
a
terrible
illness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
that
the
rivals
are
reconciled
,
thanks
to
the
angina
...
''
and
*NL*
the
word
angina
was
repeated
with
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
count
is
pathetic
,
they
say
.
He
cried
like
a
child
when
the
doctor
*NL*
told
him
the
case
was
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
would
be
a
terrible
loss
,
she
is
an
enchanting
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
speaking
of
the
poor
countess
?
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
coming
up
*NL*
just
then
.
``
I
sent
to
ask
for
news
,
and
hear
that
she
is
a
little
*NL*
better
.
Oh
,
she
is
certainly
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
with
a
smile
at
her
own
enthusiasm
.
``
We
belong
to
different
*NL*
camps
,
but
that
does
not
prevent
my
esteeming
her
as
she
deserves
.
She
*NL*
is
very
unfortunate
!
''
added
Anna
Pavlovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supposing
that
by
these
words
Anna
Pavlovna
was
somewhat
lifting
the
*NL*
veil
from
the
secret
of
the
countess
'
malady
,
an
unwary
young
man
*NL*
ventured
to
express
surprise
that
well
known
doctors
had
not
been
called
*NL*
in
and
that
the
countess
was
being
attended
by
a
charlatan
who
might
*NL*
employ
dangerous
remedies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
information
may
be
better
than
mine
,
''
Anna
Pavlovna
suddenly
and
*NL*
venomously
retorted
on
the
inexperienced
young
man
,
``
but
I
know
on
good
*NL*
authority
that
this
doctor
is
a
very
learned
and
able
man
.
He
is
private
*NL*
physician
to
the
Queen
of
Spain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
thus
demolished
the
young
man
,
Anna
Pavlovna
turned
to
*NL*
another
group
where
Bilibin
was
talking
about
the
Austrians
:
having
*NL*
wrinkled
up
his
face
he
was
evidently
preparing
to
smooth
it
out
again
*NL*
and
utter
one
of
his
mots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
delightful
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
a
diplomatic
note
that
*NL*
had
been
sent
to
Vienna
with
some
Austrian
banners
captured
from
the
*NL*
French
by
Wittgenstein
,
``
the
hero
of
Petropol
''
as
he
was
then
called
in
*NL*
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
's
that
?
''
asked
Anna
Pavlovna
,
securing
silence
for
the
mot
,
*NL*
which
she
had
heard
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Bilibin
repeated
the
actual
words
of
the
diplomatic
dispatch
,
which
*NL*
he
had
himself
composed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
returns
these
Austrian
banners
,
''
said
Bilibin
,
``
friendly
*NL*
banners
gone
astray
and
found
on
a
wrong
path
,
''
and
his
brow
became
*NL*
smooth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
,
charming
!
''
observed
Prince
Vasili
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
path
to
Warsaw
,
perhaps
,
''
Prince
Hippolyte
remarked
loudly
and
*NL*
unexpectedly
.
Everybody
looked
at
him
,
understanding
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
Prince
Hippolyte
himself
glanced
around
with
amused
surprise
.
He
knew
no
*NL*
more
than
the
others
what
his
words
meant
.
During
his
diplomatic
career
*NL*
he
had
more
than
once
noticed
that
such
utterances
were
received
as
very
*NL*
witty
,
and
at
every
opportunity
he
uttered
in
that
way
the
first
words
*NL*
that
entered
his
head
.
``
It
may
turn
out
very
well
,
''
he
thought
,
``
but
if
*NL*
not
,
they
'll
know
how
to
arrange
matters
.
''
And
really
,
during
the
*NL*
awkward
silence
that
ensued
,
that
insufficiently
patriotic
person
*NL*
entered
whom
Anna
Pavlovna
had
been
waiting
for
and
wished
to
convert
,
*NL*
and
she
,
smiling
and
shaking
a
finger
at
Hippolyte
,
invited
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
to
the
table
and
bringing
him
two
candles
and
the
manuscript
*NL*
begged
him
to
begin
.
Everyone
became
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
Gracious
Sovereign
and
Emperor
!
''
Prince
Vasili
sternly
declaimed
,
*NL*
looking
round
at
his
audience
as
if
to
inquire
whether
anyone
had
*NL*
anything
to
say
to
the
contrary

But
no
one
said
anything
.
``
Moscow
,
our
*NL*
ancient
capital
,
the
New
Jerusalem
,
receives
her
Christ
''
--
he
placed
a
*NL*
sudden
emphasis
on
the
word
her
--
``
as
a
mother
receives
her
zealous
sons
*NL*
into
her
arms
,
and
through
the
gathering

,
foreseeing
the
brilliant
*NL*
glory
of
thy

in
exultation
,
`
Hosanna

blessed
is
he
that
*NL*
cometh

''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
pronounced
these
last
words
in
a
tearful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilibin
attentively
examined
his
nails
,
and
many
of
those
present
*NL*
appeared
intimidated
,
as
if
asking
in
what
they
were
to
blame
.
Anna
*NL*
Pavlovna
whispered
the
next
words
in
advance
,
like
an
old
woman
*NL*
muttering
the
prayer
at
Communion
:
``
Let
the
bold
and
insolent
*NL*
Goliath
...
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
bold
and
insolent
Goliath
from
the
borders
of
France
encompass

realms

the

Russian
David

shall
suddenly
smite
his

in
his
bloodthirsty

pride

zealous
champion

I
grieve
that
my
waning
strength
prevents
rejoicing
in

the
sight
of
your
most

I
raise
fervent
prayers
to

Heaven
that

exalt

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
force

What
a
style

''
was
uttered
in
approval
both
of
reader
and
*NL*
of
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
Animated
by
that
address
Anna
Pavlovna
's
guests
talked
for
a
long
time
*NL*
of
the
state
of
the
fatherland
and
offered
various
conjectures
as
to
the
*NL*
result
of
the
battle
to
be
fought
in
a
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see

said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
``
that
tomorrow

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
presentiment
was
in
fact
fulfilled
.
Next
day
during
the
*NL*
service
at
the
palace
church
in
honor
of
the
Emperor
's
birthday
,
Prince
*NL*
Volkonski
was
called
out
of
the
church
and
received
a
dispatch
from
*NL*
Prince
Kutuzov
.
It
was
Kutuzov
's
report
,
written
from
Tatarinova
on
the
*NL*
day
of
the
battle
.
Kutuzov
wrote
that
the
Russians
had
not
retreated
a
*NL*
step
,
that
the
French
losses
were
much
heavier
than
ours
,
and
that
he
*NL*
was
writing
in
haste
from
the
field
of
battle
before
collecting
full
*NL*
information
.
It
followed
that
there
must
have
been
a
victory
.
And
at
*NL*
once
,
without
leaving
the
church
,
thanks
were
rendered
to
the
Creator
*NL*
for
His
help
and
for
the
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
's
presentiment
was
justified
,
and
all
that
morning
a
*NL*
joyously
festive
mood
reigned
in
the
city
.
Everyone
believed
the
victory
*NL*
to
have
been
complete
,
and
some
even
spoke
of
Napoleon
's
having
been
*NL*
captured
,
of
his
deposition
,
and
of
the
choice
of
a
new
ruler
for
*NL*
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
difficult
for
events
to
be
reflected
in
their
real
strength
*NL*
and
completeness
amid
the
conditions
of
court
life
and
far
from
the
*NL*
scene
of
action
.
General
events
involuntarily
group
themselves
around
*NL*
some
particular
incident
.
So
now
the
courtiers
'
pleasure
was
based
as
*NL*
much
on
the
fact
that
the
news
had
arrived
on
the
Emperor
's
birthday
as
*NL*
on
the
fact
of
the
victory
itself
.
It
was
like
a
successfully
arranged
*NL*
surprise
.
Mention
was
made
in
Kutuzov
's
report
of
the
Russian
losses
,
*NL*
among
which
figured
the
names
of
Tuchkov
,
Bagration
,
and
Kutaysov
.
In
*NL*
the
Petersburg
world
this
sad
side
of
the
affair
again
involuntarily
*NL*
centered
round
a
single
incident
:
Kutaysov
's
death
.
Everybody
knew
him
,
*NL*
the
Emperor
liked
him
,
and
he
was
young
and
interesting
.
That
day
*NL*
everyone
met
with
the
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
wonderful
coincidence
!
Just
during
the
service
.
But
what
a
loss
*NL*
Kutaysov
is
!
How
sorry
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
tell
about
Kutuzov
?
''
Prince
Vasili
now
said
with
a
prophet
's
*NL*
pride
.
``
I
always
said
he
was
the
only
man
capable
of
defeating
*NL*
Napoleon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
next
day
no
news
arrived
from
the
army
and
the
public
mood
grew
*NL*
anxious
.
The
courtiers
suffered
because
of
the
suffering
the
suspense
*NL*
occasioned
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fancy
the
Emperor
's
position
!
''
said
they
,
and
instead
of
extolling
*NL*
Kutuzov
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
,
they
condemned
him
as
the
cause
*NL*
of
the
Emperor
's
anxiety
.
That
day
Prince
Vasili
no
longer
boasted
of
*NL*
his
protege
Kutuzov
,
but
remained
silent
when
the
commander-in-chief
was
*NL*
mentioned
.
Moreover
,
toward
evening
,
as
if
everything
conspired
to
make
*NL*
Petersburg
society
anxious
and
uneasy
,
a
terrible
piece
of
news
was
*NL*
added
.
Countess
Helene
Bezukhova
had
suddenly
died
of
that
terrible
*NL*
malady
it
had
been
so
agreeable
to
mention
.
Officially
,
at
large
*NL*
gatherings
,
everyone
said
that
Countess
Bezukhova
had
died
of
a
terrible
*NL*
attack
of
angina
pectoris
,
but
in
intimate
circles
details
were
*NL*
mentioned
of
how
the
private
physician
of
the
Queen
of
Spain
had
*NL*
prescribed
small
doses
of
a
certain
drug
to
produce
a
certain
effect
;
*NL*
but
Helene
,
tortured
by
the
fact
that
the
old
count
suspected
her
and
*NL*
that
her
husband
to
whom
she
had
written
-LRB-
that
wretched
,
profligate
*NL*
Pierre
-RRB-
had
not
replied
,
had
suddenly
taken
a
very
large
dose
of
the
*NL*
drug
,
and
had
died
in
agony
before
assistance
could
be
rendered
her
.
It
*NL*
was
said
that
Prince
Vasili
and
the
old
count
had
turned
upon
the
*NL*
Italian
,
but
the
latter
had
produced
such
letters
from
the
unfortunate
*NL*
deceased
that
they
had
immediately
let
the
matter
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Talk
in
general
centered
round
three
melancholy
facts
:
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
lack
of
news
,
the
loss
of
Kutaysov
,
and
the
death
of
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
after
Kutuzov
's
report
a
country
gentleman
arrived
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
news
of
the
surrender
of
Moscow
to
the
French
spread
through
*NL*
the
whole
town
.
This
was
terrible
!
What
a
position
for
the
Emperor
to
be
*NL*
in
!
Kutuzov
was
a
traitor
,
and
Prince
Vasili
during
the
visits
of
*NL*
condolence
paid
to
him
on
the
occasion
of
his
daughter
's
death
said
of
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
whom
he
had
formerly
praised
-LRB-
it
was
excusable
for
him
in
his
*NL*
grief
to
forget
what
he
had
said
-RRB-
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
expect
*NL*
anything
else
from
a
blind
and
depraved
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wonder
that
the
fate
of
Russia
could
have
been
entrusted
to
such
*NL*
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
this
news
remained
unofficial
it
was
possible
to
doubt
it
,
*NL*
but
the
next
day
the
following
communication
was
received
from
Count
*NL*
Rostopchin
:
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Kutuzov
's
adjutant
has
brought
me
a
letter
in
which
he
demands
*NL*
police
officers
to
guide
the
army
to
the
Ryazan
road
.
He
writes
that
he
*NL*
is
regretfully
abandoning
Moscow
.
Sire
!
Kutuzov
's
action
decides
the
*NL*
fate
of
the
capital
and
of
your
empire
!
Russia
will
shudder
to
learn
of
*NL*
the
abandonment
of
the
city
in
which
her
greatness
is
centered
and
in
*NL*
which
lie
the
ashes
of
your
ancestors
!
I
shall
follow
the
army
.
I
have
*NL*
had
everything
removed
,
and
it
only
remains
for
me
to
weep
over
the
fate
*NL*
of
my
fatherland
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
receiving
this
dispatch
the
Emperor
sent
Prince
Volkonski
to
Kutuzov
*NL*
with
the
following
rescript
:
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Michael
Ilarionovich
!
Since
the
twenty-ninth
of
August
I
have
*NL*
received
no
communication
from
you
,
yet
on
the
first
of
September
I
*NL*
received
from
the
commander-in-chief
of
Moscow
,
via
Yaroslavl
,
the
sad
*NL*
news
that
you
,
with
the
army
,
have
decided
to
abandon
Moscow
.
You
can
*NL*
yourself
imagine
the
effect
this
news
has
had
on
me
,
and
your
silence
*NL*
increases
my
astonishment
.
I
am
sending
this
by
Adjutant-General
Prince
*NL*
Volkonski
,
to
hear
from
you
the
situation
of
the
army
and
the
reasons
*NL*
that
have
induced
you
to
take
this
melancholy
decision
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Nine
days
after
the
abandonment
of
Moscow
,
a
messenger
from
Kutuzov
*NL*
reached
Petersburg
with
the
official
announcement
of
that
event
.
This
*NL*
messenger
was
Michaud
,
a
Frenchman
who
did
not
know
Russian
,
but
who
was
*NL*
quoique
etranger
,
russe
de
coeur
et
d'ame
,
*
as
he
said
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Though
a
foreigner
,
Russian
in
heart
and
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
at
once
received
this
messenger
in
his
study
at
the
palace
*NL*
on
Stone
Island
.
Michaud
,
who
had
never
seen
Moscow
before
the
campaign
*NL*
and
who
did
not
know
Russian
,
yet
felt
deeply
moved
-LRB-
as
he
wrote
-RRB-
when
*NL*
he
appeared
before
notre
tres
gracieux
souverain
*
with
the
news
of
the
*NL*
burning
of
Moscow
,
dont
les
flammes
eclairaient
sa
route
.
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Our
most
gracious
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
Whose
flames
illumined
his
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
source
of
M.
Michaud
's
chagrin
must
have
been
different
from
*NL*
that
which
caused
Russians
to
grieve
,
he
had
such
a
sad
face
when
shown
*NL*
into
the
Emperor
's
study
that
the
latter
at
once
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
brought
me
sad
news
,
Colonel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sad
,
sire
,
''
replied
Michaud
,
lowering
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
.
``
The
*NL*
abandonment
of
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
surrendered
my
ancient
capital
without
a
battle
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
Emperor
quickly
,
his
face
suddenly
flushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Michaud
respectfully
delivered
the
message
Kutuzov
had
entrusted
to
him
,
*NL*
which
was
that
it
had
been
impossible
to
fight
before
Moscow
,
and
that
*NL*
as
the
only
remaining
choice
was
between
losing
the
army
as
well
as
*NL*
Moscow
,
or
losing
Moscow
alone
,
the
field
marshal
had
to
choose
the
*NL*
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
listened
in
silence
,
not
looking
at
Michaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
enemy
entered
the
city
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
and
Moscow
is
now
in
ashes
.
I
left
it
all
in
flames
,
''
*NL*
replied
Michaud
in
a
decided
tone
,
but
glancing
at
the
Emperor
he
was
*NL*
frightened
by
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
began
to
breathe
heavily
and
rapidly
,
his
lower
lip
*NL*
trembled
,
and
tears
instantly
appeared
in
his
fine
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
lasted
only
a
moment
.
He
suddenly
frowned
,
as
if
blaming
*NL*
himself
for
his
weakness
,
and
raising
his
head
addressed
Michaud
in
a
*NL*
firm
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
Colonel
,
from
all
that
is
happening
,
that
Providence
requires
*NL*
great
sacrifices
of
us
...
I
am
ready
to
submit
myself
in
all
things
to
*NL*
His
will
;
but
tell
me
,
Michaud
,
how
did
you
leave
the
army
when
it
saw
*NL*
my
ancient
capital
abandoned
without
a
battle
?
Did
you
not
notice
*NL*
discouragement
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
his
most
gracious
ruler
was
calm
once
more
,
Michaud
also
*NL*
grew
calm
,
but
was
not
immediately
ready
to
reply
to
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
direct
and
relevant
question
which
required
a
direct
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
will
you
allow
me
to
speak
frankly
as
befits
a
loyal
soldier
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
to
gain
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
,
I
always
require
it
,
''
replied
the
Emperor
.
``
Conceal
nothing
*NL*
from
me
,
I
wish
to
know
absolutely
how
things
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
!
''
said
Michaud
with
a
subtle
,
scarcely
perceptible
smile
on
his
*NL*
lips
,
having
now
prepared
a
well-phrased
reply
,
``
sire
,
I
left
the
whole
*NL*
army
,
from
its
chiefs
to
the
lowest
soldier
,
without
exception
in
*NL*
desperate
and
agonized
terror
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
''
the
Emperor
interrupted
him
,
frowning
sternly
.
``
Would
*NL*
misfortune
make
my
Russians
lose
heart
?
...
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Michaud
had
only
waited
for
this
to
bring
out
the
phrase
he
had
*NL*
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
he
said
,
with
respectful
playfulness
,
``
they
are
only
afraid
lest
*NL*
Your
Majesty
,
in
the
goodness
of
your
heart
,
should
allow
yourself
to
be
*NL*
persuaded
to
make
peace
.
They
are
burning
for
the
combat
,
''
declared
this
*NL*
representative
of
the
Russian
nation
,
``
and
to
prove
to
Your
Majesty
by
*NL*
the
sacrifice
of
their
lives
how
devoted
they
are
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
Emperor
reassured
,
and
with
a
kindly
gleam
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
he
patted
Michaud
on
the
shoulder
.
``
You
set
me
at
ease
,
Colonel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
his
head
and
was
silent
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
go
back
to
the
army
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
himself
up
to
his
*NL*
full
height
and
addressing
Michaud
with
a
gracious
and
majestic
gesture
,
*NL*
``
and
tell
our
brave
men
and
all
my
good
subjects
wherever
you
go
that
*NL*
when
I
have
not
a

left
I
shall
put
myself
at
the
head
of
my
*NL*
beloved
nobility
and
my
good
peasants
and
so
use
the
last
resources
of
*NL*
my
empire
.
It
still
offers
me
more
than
my
enemies
suppose
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Emperor
growing
more
and
more
animated
;
``
but
should
it
ever
be
ordained
*NL*
by
Divine
Providence
,
''
he
continued
,
raising
to
heaven
his
fine
eyes
*NL*
shining
with
emotion
,
``
that
my
dynasty
should
cease
to
reign
on
the
*NL*
throne
of
my
ancestors
,
then
after
exhausting
all
the
means
at
my
*NL*
command
,
I
shall
let
my
beard
grow
to
here
''
-LRB-
he
pointed
halfway
down
his
*NL*
chest
-RRB-
``
and
go
and
eat
potatoes
with
the
meanest
of
my
peasants
,
rather
*NL*
than
sign
the
disgrace
of
my
country
and
of
my
beloved
people
whose
*NL*
sacrifices
I
know
how
to
appreciate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
uttered
these
words
in
an
agitated
voice
the
Emperor
suddenly
*NL*
turned
away
as
if
to
hide
from
Michaud
the
tears
that
rose
to
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
went
to
the
further
end
of
his
study
.
Having
stood
there
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
he
strode
back
to
Michaud
and
pressed
his
arm
below
the
elbow
*NL*
with
a
vigorous
movement
.
The
Emperor
's
mild
and
handsome
face
was
*NL*
flushed
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
resolution
and
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
Michaud
,
do
not
forget
what
I
say
to
you
here
,
perhaps
we
may
*NL*
recall
it
with
pleasure
someday
...
Napoleon
or
I
,
''
said
the
Emperor
,
*NL*
touching
his
breast
.
``
We
can
no
longer
both
reign
together
.
I
have
*NL*
learned
to
know
him
,
and
he
will
not
deceive
me
any
more
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
Emperor
paused
,
with
a
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
heard
these
words
and
saw
the
expression
of
firm
resolution
in
*NL*
the
Emperor
's
eyes
,
Michaud
--
quoique
etranger
,
russe
de
coeur
et
d'ame
--
*NL*
at
that
solemn
moment
felt
himself
enraptured
by
all
that
he
had
heard
*NL*
-LRB-
as
he
used
afterwards
to
say
-RRB-
,
and
gave
expression
to
his
own
feelings
*NL*
and
those
of
the
Russian
people
whose
representative
he
considered
*NL*
himself
to
be
,
in
the
following
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
!
''
said
he
,
``
Your
Majesty
is
at
this
moment
signing
the
glory
of
*NL*
the
nation
and
the
salvation
of
Europe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
inclination
of
the
head
the
Emperor
dismissed
him
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
natural
for
us
who
were
not
living
in
those
days
to
imagine
that
*NL*
when
half
Russia
had
been
conquered
and
the
inhabitants
were
fleeing
to
*NL*
distant
provinces
,
and
one
levy
after
another
was
being
raised
for
the
*NL*
defense
of
the
fatherland
,
all
Russians
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
*NL*
were
solely
engaged
in
sacrificing
themselves
,
saving
their
fatherland
,
*NL*
or
weeping
over
its
downfall
.
The
tales
and
descriptions
of
that
time
*NL*
without
exception
speak
only
of
the
self-sacrifice
,
patriotic
devotion
,
*NL*
despair
,
grief
,
and
the
heroism
of
the
Russians
.
But
it
was
not
really
*NL*
so
.
It
appears
so
to
us
because
we
see
only
the
general
historic
*NL*
interest
of
that
time
and
do
not
see
all
the
personal
human
interests
*NL*
that
people
had
.
Yet
in
reality
those
personal
interests
of
the
moment
*NL*
so
much
transcend
the
general
interests
that
they
always
prevent
the
*NL*
public
interest
from
being
felt
or
even
noticed
.
Most
of
the
people
at
*NL*
that
time
paid
no
attention
to
the
general
progress
of
events
but
were
*NL*
guided
only
by
their
private
interests
,
and
they
were
the
very
people
*NL*
whose
activities
at
that
period
were
most
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
tried
to
understand
the
general
course
of
events
and
to
take
*NL*
part
in
it
by
self-sacrifice
and
heroism
were
the
most
useless
members
*NL*
of
society
,
they
saw
everything
upside
down
,
and
all
they
did
for
the
*NL*
common
good
turned
out
to
be
useless
and
foolish
--
like
Pierre
's
and
*NL*
Mamonov
's
regiments
which
looted
Russian
villages
,
and
the
lint
the
*NL*
young
ladies
prepared
and
that
never
reached
the
wounded
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
Even
those
,
fond
of
intellectual
talk
and
of
expressing
their
feelings
,
*NL*
who
discussed
Russia
's
position
at
the
time
involuntarily
introduced
*NL*
into
their
conversation
either
a
shade
of
pretense
and
falsehood
or
*NL*
useless
condemnation
and
anger
directed
against
people
accused
of
*NL*
actions
no
one
could
possibly
be
guilty
of
.
In
historic
events
the
rule
*NL*
forbidding
us
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
Tree
of
Knowledge
is
specially
*NL*
applicable
.
Only
unconscious
action
bears
fruit
,
and
he
who
plays
a
part
*NL*
in
an
historic
event
never
understands
its
significance
.
If
he
tries
to
*NL*
realize
it
his
efforts
are
fruitless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
closely
a
man
was
engaged
in
the
events
then
taking
place
in
*NL*
Russia
the
less
did
he
realize
their
significance
.
In
Petersburg
and
in
*NL*
the
provinces
at
a
distance
from
Moscow
,
ladies
,
and
gentlemen
in
*NL*
militia
uniforms
,
wept
for
Russia
and
its
ancient
capital
and
talked
of
*NL*
self-sacrifice
and
so
on
;
but
in
the
army
which
retired
beyond
Moscow
*NL*
there
was
little
talk
or
thought
of
Moscow
,
and
when
they
caught
sight
*NL*
of
its
burned
ruins
no
one
swore
to
be
avenged
on
the
French
,
but
they
*NL*
thought
about
their
next
pay
,
their
next
quarters
,
of
Matreshka
the
*NL*
vivandiere
,
and
like
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
war
had
caught
him
in
the
service
,
Nicholas
Rostov
took
a
close
*NL*
and
prolonged
part
in
the
defense
of
his
country
,
but
did
so
casually
,
*NL*
without
any
aim
at
self-sacrifice
,
and
he
therefore
looked
at
what
was
*NL*
going
on
in
Russia
without
despair
and
without
dismally
racking
his
*NL*
brains
over
it
.
Had
he
been
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
state
of
*NL*
Russia
,
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
not
his
business
to
think
about
*NL*
it
,
that
Kutuzov
and
others
were
there
for
that
purpose
,
but
that
he
had
*NL*
heard
that
the
regiments
were
to
be
made
up
to
their
full
strength
,
that
*NL*
fighting
would
probably
go
on
for
a
long
time
yet
,
and
that
things
being
*NL*
so
it
was
quite
likely
he
might
be
in
command
of
a
regiment
in
a
couple
*NL*
of
years
'
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
looked
at
the
matter
in
this
way
,
he
learned
that
he
was
being
*NL*
sent
to
Voronezh
to
buy
remounts
for
his
division
,
not
only
without
*NL*
regret
at
being
prevented
from
taking
part
in
the
coming
battle
,
but
*NL*
with
the
greatest
pleasure
--
which
he
did
not
conceal
and
which
his
*NL*
comrades
fully
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
before
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
Nicholas
received
the
*NL*
necessary
money
and
warrants
,
and
having
sent
some
hussars
on
in
*NL*
advance
,
he
set
out
with
post
horses
for
Voronezh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
a
man
who
has
experienced
it
--
that
is
,
has
passed
some
months
*NL*
continuously
in
an
atmosphere
of
campaigning
and
war
--
can
understand
the
*NL*
delight
Nicholas
felt
when
he
escaped
from
the
region
covered
by
the
*NL*
army
's
foraging
operations
,
provision
trains
,
and
hospitals
.
When
--
free
*NL*
from
soldiers
,
wagons
,
and
the
filthy
traces
of
a
camp
--
he
saw
villages
*NL*
with
peasants
and
peasant
women
,
gentlemen
's
country
houses
,
fields
*NL*
where
cattle
were
grazing
,
posthouses
with
stationmasters
asleep
in
*NL*
them
,
he
rejoiced
as
though
seeing
all
this
for
the
first
time
.
What
for
*NL*
a
long
while
specially
surprised
and
delighted
him
were
the
women
,
young
*NL*
and
healthy
,
without
a
dozen
officers
making
up
to
each
of
them
;
women
,
*NL*
too
,
who
were
pleased
and
flattered
that
a
passing
officer
should
joke
*NL*
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
highest
spirits
Nicholas
arrived
at
night
at
a
hotel
in
Voronezh
,
*NL*
ordered
things
he
had
long
been
deprived
of
in
camp
,
and
next
day
,
very
*NL*
clean-shaven
and
in
a
full-dress
uniform
he
had
not
worn
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
went
to
present
himself
to
the
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
militia
was
a
civilian
general
,
an
old
man
who
was
*NL*
evidently
pleased
with
his
military
designation
and
rank
.
He
received
*NL*
Nicholas
brusquely
-LRB-
imagining
this
to
be
characteristically
military
-RRB-
*NL*
and
questioned
him
with
an
important
air
,
as
if
considering
the
general
*NL*
progress
of
affairs
and
approving
and
disapproving
with
full
right
to
do
*NL*
so
.
Nicholas
was
in
such
good
spirits
that
this
merely
amused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
commander
of
the
militia
he
drove
to
the
governor
.
The
governor
*NL*
was
a
brisk
little
man
,
very
simple
and
affable
.
He
indicated
the
stud
*NL*
farms
at
which
Nicholas
might
procure
horses
,
recommended
to
him
a
horse
*NL*
dealer
in
the
town
and
a
landowner
fourteen
miles
out
of
town
who
had
*NL*
the
best
horses
,
and
promised
to
assist
him
in
every
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
Count
Ilya
Rostov
's
son
?
My
wife
was
a
great
friend
of
your
*NL*
mother
's
.
We
are
at
home
on
Thursdays
--
today
is
Thursday
,
so
please
come
*NL*
and
see
us
quite
informally
,
''
said
the
governor
,
taking
leave
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
on
leaving
the
governor
's
,
Nicholas
hired
post
horses
and
,
*NL*
taking
his
squadron
quartermaster
with
him
,
drove
at
a
gallop
to
the
*NL*
landowner
,
fourteen
miles
away
,
who
had
the
stud
.
Everything
seemed
to
*NL*
him
pleasant
and
easy
during
that
first
part
of
his
stay
in
Voronezh
*NL*
and
,
as
usually
happens
when
a
man
is
in
a
pleasant
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
everything
went
well
and
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landowner
to
whom
Nicholas
went
was
a
bachelor
,
an
old
cavalryman
,
a
*NL*
horse
fancier
,
a
sportsman
,
the
possessor
of
some
century-old
brandy
and
*NL*
some
old
Hungarian
wine
,
who
had
a
snuggery
where
he
smoked
,
and
who
*NL*
owned
some
splendid
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
very
few
words
Nicholas
bought
seventeen
picked
stallions
for
six
*NL*
thousand
rubles
--
to
serve
,
as
he
said
,
as
samples
of
his
remounts
.
After
*NL*
dining
and
taking
rather
too
much
of
the
Hungarian
wine
,
Nicholas
--
*NL*
having
exchanged
kisses
with
the
landowner
,
with
whom
he
was
already
on
*NL*
the
friendliest
terms
--
galloped
back
over
abominable
roads
,
in
the
*NL*
brightest
frame
of
mind
,
continually
urging
on
the
driver
so
as
to
be
in
*NL*
time
for
the
governor
's
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
changed
,
poured
water
over
his
head
,
and
scented
himself
,
*NL*
Nicholas
arrived
at
the
governor
's
rather
late
,
but
with
the
phrase
*NL*
``
better
late
than
never
''
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
ball
,
nor
had
dancing
been
announced
,
but
everyone
knew
*NL*
that
Catherine
Petrovna
would
play
valses
and
the
ecossaise
on
the
*NL*
clavichord
and
that
there
would
be
dancing
,
and
so
everyone
had
come
as
*NL*
to
a
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
Provincial
life
in
1812
went
on
very
much
as
usual
,
but
with
this
*NL*
difference
,
that
it
was
livelier
in
the
towns
in
consequence
of
the
*NL*
arrival
of
many
wealthy
families
from
Moscow
,
and
as
in
everything
that
*NL*
went
on
in
Russia
at
that
time
a
special
recklessness
was
noticeable
,
an
*NL*
``
in
for
a
penny
,
in
for
a
pound
--
who
cares
?
''
spirit
,
and
the
inevitable
*NL*
small
talk
,
instead
of
turning
on
the
weather
and
mutual
acquaintances
,
*NL*
now
turned
on
Moscow
,
the
army
,
and
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
society
gathered
together
at
the
governor
's
was
the
best
in
*NL*
Voronezh
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
great
many
ladies
and
some
of
Nicholas
'
Moscow
*NL*
acquaintances
,
but
there
were
no
men
who
could
at
all
vie
with
the
*NL*
cavalier
of
St.
George
,
the
hussar
remount
officer
,
the
good-natured
and
*NL*
well-bred
Count
Rostov
.
Among
the
men
was
an
Italian
prisoner
,
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
French
army
;
and
Nicholas
felt
that
the
presence
of
that
*NL*
prisoner
enhanced
his
own
importance
as
a
Russian
hero
.
The
Italian
was
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
a
war
trophy
.
Nicholas
felt
this
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
everyone
regarded
the
Italian
in
the
same
light
,
and
he
treated
him
*NL*
cordially
though
with
dignity
and
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Nicholas
entered
in
his
hussar
uniform
,
diffusing
around
him
*NL*
a
fragrance
of
perfume
and
wine
,
and
had
uttered
the
words
``
better
late
*NL*
than
never
''
and
heard
them
repeated
several
times
by
others
,
people
*NL*
clustered
around
him
;
all
eyes
turned
on
him
,
and
he
felt
at
once
that
*NL*
he
had
entered
into
his
proper
position
in
the
province
--
that
of
a
*NL*
universal
favorite
:
a
very
pleasant
position
,
and
intoxicatingly
so
*NL*
after
his
long
privations
.
At
posting
stations
,
at
inns
,
and
in
the
*NL*
landowner
's
snuggery
,
maidservants
had
been
flattered
by
his
notice
,
and
*NL*
here
too
at
the
governor
's
party
there
were
-LRB-
as
it
seemed
to
Nicholas
-RRB-
*NL*
an
inexhaustible
number
of
pretty
young
women
,
married
and
unmarried
,
*NL*
impatiently
awaiting
his
notice
.
The
women
and
girls
flirted
with
him
*NL*
and
,
from
the
first
day
,
the
people
concerned
themselves
to
get
this
*NL*
fine
young
daredevil
of
an
hussar
married
and
settled
down
.
Among
these
*NL*
was
the
governor
's
wife
herself
,
who
welcomed
Rostov
as
a
near
relative
*NL*
and
called
him
``
Nicholas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
Petrovna
did
actually
play
valses
and
the
ecossaise
,
and
*NL*
dancing
began
in
which
Nicholas
still
further
captivated
the
provincial
*NL*
society
by
his
agility
.
His
particularly
free
manner
of
dancing
even
*NL*
surprised
them
all
.
Nicholas
was
himself
rather
surprised
at
the
way
he
*NL*
danced
that
evening
.
He
had
never
danced
like
that
in
Moscow
and
would
*NL*
even
have
considered
such
a
very
free
and
easy
manner
improper
and
in
*NL*
bad
form
,
but
here
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
astonish
them
all
by
*NL*
something
unusual
,
something
they
would
have
to
accept
as
the
regular
*NL*
thing
in
the
capital
though
new
to
them
in
the
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
evening
Nicholas
paid
attention
to
a
blue-eyed
,
plump
and
*NL*
pleasing
little
blonde
,
the
wife
of
one
of
the
provincial
officials
.
*NL*
With
the
naive
conviction
of
young
men
in
a
merry
mood
that
other
men
's
*NL*
wives
were
created
for
them
,
Rostov
did
not
leave
the
lady
's
side
and
*NL*
treated
her
husband
in
a
friendly
and
conspiratorial
style
,
as
if
,
*NL*
without
speaking
of
it
,
they
knew
how
capitally
Nicholas
and
the
lady
*NL*
would
get
on
together
.
The
husband
,
however
,
did
not
seem
to
share
that
*NL*
conviction
and
tried
to
behave
morosely
with
Rostov
.
But
the
latter
's
*NL*
good-natured
naivete
was
so
boundless
that
sometimes
even
he
*NL*
involuntarily
yielded
to
Nicholas
'
good
humor
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
however
,
as
the
wife
's
face
grew
more
flushed
and
animated
,
the
*NL*
husband
's
became
more
and
more
melancholy
and
solemn
,
as
though
there
*NL*
were
but
a
given
amount
of
animation
between
them
and
as
the
wife
's
*NL*
share
increased
the
husband
's
diminished
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
sat
leaning
slightly
forward
in
an
armchair
,
bending
closely
*NL*
over
the
blonde
lady
and
paying
her
mythological
compliments
with
a
*NL*
smile
that
never
left
his
face
.
Jauntily
shifting
the
position
of
his
*NL*
legs
in
their
tight
riding
breeches
,
diffusing
an
odor
of
perfume
,
and
*NL*
admiring
his
partner
,
himself
,
and
the
fine
outlines
of
his
legs
in
*NL*
their
well-fitting
Hessian
boots
,
Nicholas
told
the
blonde
lady
that
he
*NL*
wished
to
run
away
with
a
certain
lady
here
in
Voronezh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
charming
lady
,
a
divine
one
.
Her
eyes
''
-LRB-
Nicholas
looked
at
his
*NL*
partner
-RRB-
``
are
blue
,
her
mouth
coral
and
ivory
;
her
figure
''
-LRB-
he
glanced
*NL*
at
her
shoulders
-RRB-
``
like
Diana
's
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
came
up
and
sullenly
asked
his
wife
what
she
was
talking
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Nikita
Ivanych
!
''
cried
Nicholas
,
rising
politely
,
and
as
if
wishing
*NL*
Nikita
Ivanych
to
share
his
joke
,
he
began
to
tell
him
of
his
intention
*NL*
to
elope
with
a
blonde
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
smiled
gloomily
,
the
wife
gaily
.
The
governor
's
good-natured
*NL*
wife
came
up
with
a
look
of
disapproval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
Ignatyevna
wants
to
see
you
,
Nicholas
,
''
said
she
,
pronouncing
the
*NL*
name
so
that
Nicholas
at
once
understood
that
Anna
Ignatyevna
was
a
very
*NL*
important
person
.
``
Come
,
Nicholas
!
You
know
you
let
me
call
you
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Aunt
.
Who
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
Ignatyevna
Malvintseva
.
She
has
heard
from
her
niece
how
you
*NL*
rescued
her
...
Can
you
guess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rescued
such
a
lot
of
them
!
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
niece
,
Princess
Bolkonskaya
.
She
is
here
in
Voronezh
with
her
aunt
.
*NL*
Oho
!
How
you
blush
.
Why
,
are
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
!
Please
do
n't
,
Aunt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
very
well
!
...
Oh
,
what
a
fellow
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
's
wife
led
him
up
to
a
tall
and
very
stout
old
lady
with
a
*NL*
blue
headdress
,
who
had
just
finished
her
game
of
cards
with
the
most
*NL*
important
personages
of
the
town
.
This
was
Malvintseva
,
Princess
Mary
's
*NL*
aunt
on
her
mother
's
side
,
a
rich
,
childless
widow
who
always
lived
in
*NL*
Voronezh
.
When
Rostov
approached
her
she
was
standing
settling
up
for
*NL*
the
game
.
She
looked
at
him
and
,
screwing
up
her
eyes
sternly
,
continued
*NL*
to
upbraid
the
general
who
had
won
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pleased
,
mon
cher
,
''
she
then
said
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
*NL*
Nicholas
.
``
Pray
come
and
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
words
about
Princess
Mary
and
her
late
father
,
whom
*NL*
Malvintseva
had
evidently
not
liked
,
and
having
asked
what
Nicholas
knew
*NL*
of
Prince
Andrew
,
who
also
was
evidently
no
favorite
of
hers
,
the
*NL*
important
old
lady
dismissed
Nicholas
after
repeating
her
invitation
to
*NL*
come
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
promised
to
come
and
blushed
again
as
he
bowed
.
At
the
mention
*NL*
of
Princess
Mary
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
shyness
and
even
of
fear
,
*NL*
which
he
himself
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
parted
from
Malvintseva
Nicholas
wished
to
return
to
the
*NL*
dancing
,
but
the
governor
's
little
wife
placed
her
plump
hand
on
his
*NL*
sleeve
and
,
saying
that
she
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
him
,
led
him
to
*NL*
her
sitting
room
,
from
which
those
who
were
there
immediately
withdrew
*NL*
so
as
not
to
be
in
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
dear
boy
,
''
began
the
governor
's
wife
with
a
serious
*NL*
expression
on
her
kind
little
face
,
``
that
really
would
be
the
match
for
*NL*
you
:
would
you
like
me
to
arrange
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
,
Aunt
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
make
a
match
for
you
with
the
princess
.
Catherine
Petrovna
*NL*
speaks
of
Lily
,
but
I
say
,
no
--
the
princess
!
Do
you
want
me
to
do
it
?
I
*NL*
am
sure
your
mother
will
be
grateful
to
me
.
What
a
charming
girl
she
is
,
*NL*
really
!
And
she
is
not
at
all
so
plain
,
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
replied
Nicholas
as
if
offended
at
the
idea
.
``
As
befits
a
*NL*
soldier
,
Aunt
,
I
do
n't
force
myself
on
anyone
or
refuse
anything
,
''
he
*NL*
said
before
he
had
time
to
consider
what
he
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
remember
,
this
is
not
a
joke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
the
governor
's
wife
said
as
if
talking
to
herself
.
``
But
,
my
*NL*
dear
boy
,
among
other
things
you
are
too
attentive
to
the
other
,
the
*NL*
blonde
.
One
is
sorry
for
the
husband
,
really
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
we
are
good
friends
with
him
,
''
said
Nicholas
in
the
simplicity
*NL*
of
his
heart
;
it
did
not
enter
his
head
that
a
pastime
so
pleasant
to
*NL*
himself
might
not
be
pleasant
to
someone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
nonsense
I
have
been
saying
to
the
governor
's
wife
!
''
thought
*NL*
Nicholas
suddenly
at
supper
.
``
She
will
really
begin
to
arrange
a
*NL*
match
...
and
Sonya
...
?
''
And
on
taking
leave
of
the
governor
's
wife
,
when
*NL*
she
again
smilingly
said
to
him
,
``
Well
then
,
remember
!
''
he
drew
her
*NL*
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
see
here
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Aunt
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
my
dear
?
Come
,
let
's
sit
down
here
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
suddenly
felt
a
desire
and
need
to
tell
his
most
intimate
*NL*
thoughts
-LRB-
which
he
would
not
have
told
to
his
mother
,
his
sister
,
or
his
*NL*
friend
-RRB-
to
this
woman
who
was
almost
a
stranger
.
When
he
afterwards
*NL*
recalled
that
impulse
to
unsolicited
and
inexplicable
frankness
which
*NL*
had
very
important
results
for
him
,
it
seemed
to
him
--
as
it
seems
to
*NL*
everyone
in
such
cases
--
that
it
was
merely
some
silly
whim
that
seized
*NL*
him
:
yet
that
burst
of
frankness
,
together
with
other
trifling
events
,
*NL*
had
immense
consequences
for
him
and
for
all
his
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Aunt
,
Mamma
has
long
wanted
me
to
marry
an
heiress
,
but
the
*NL*
very
idea
of
marrying
for
money
is
repugnant
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
understand
,
''
said
the
governor
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Princess
Bolkonskaya
--
that
's
another
matter
.
I
will
tell
you
the
*NL*
truth
.
In
the
first
place
I
like
her
very
much
,
I
feel
drawn
to
her
;
and
*NL*
then
,
after
I
met
her
under
such
circumstances
--
so
strangely
,
the
idea
*NL*
often
occurred
to
me
:
`
This
is
fate
.
'
Especially
if
you
remember
that
*NL*
Mamma
had
long
been
thinking
of
it
;
but
I
had
never
happened
to
meet
her
*NL*
before
,
somehow
it
had
always
happened
that
we
did
not
meet
.
And
as
long
*NL*
as
my
sister
Natasha
was
engaged
to
her
brother
it
was
of
course
out
of
*NL*
the
question
for
me
to
think
of
marrying
her
.
And
it
must
needs
happen
*NL*
that
I
should
meet
her
just
when
Natasha
's
engagement
had
been
broken
*NL*
off
...
and
then
everything
...
So
you
see
...
I
never
told
this
to
anyone
*NL*
and
never
will
,
only
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
governor
's
wife
pressed
his
elbow
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Sonya
,
my
cousin
?
I
love
her
,
and
promised
to
marry
her
,
and
*NL*
will
do
so
...
So
you
see
there
can
be
no
question
about
-
''
said
Nicholas
*NL*
incoherently
and
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boy
,
what
a
way
to
look
at
it
!
You
know
Sonya
has
nothing
and
*NL*
you
yourself
say
your
Papa
's
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
way
.
And
what
*NL*
about
your
mother
?
It
would
kill
her
,
that
's
one
thing
.
And
what
sort
of
*NL*
life
would
it
be
for
Sonya
--
if
she
's
a
girl
with
a
heart
?
Your
mother
in
*NL*
despair
,
and
you
all
ruined
...
No
,
my
dear
,
you
and
Sonya
ought
to
*NL*
understand
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
remained
silent
.
It
comforted
him
to
hear
these
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
Aunt
,
it
is
impossible

''
he
rejoined
with
a
sigh
,
after
a
*NL*
short
pause
.
``
Besides
,
would
the
princess
have
me
?
And
besides
,
she
is
*NL*
now
in
mourning

How
can
one
think
of
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
suppose
I

going
to
get
you
married
at
once

There
is
*NL*
always
a
right
way
of
doing
things

replied
the
governor
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
matchmaker
you
are

Nicholas

plump

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
Moscow
after
her
meeting
with
Rostov
,
Princess
Mary
had
*NL*
found
her
nephew
there
with
his
tutor
,
and
a
letter
from
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
giving
her
instructions
how
to
get
to
her
Aunt
Malvintseva
at
Voronezh
.
*NL*
That
feeling
akin
to
temptation
which
had
tormented
her
during
her
*NL*
father
's
illness
,
since
his
death
,
and
especially
since
her
meeting
with
*NL*
Rostov
was
smothered
by
arrangements
for
the
journey
,
anxiety
about
her
*NL*
brother
,
settling
in
a
new
house
,
meeting
new
people
,
and
attending
to
*NL*
her
nephew
's
education
.
She
was
sad
.
Now
,
after
a
month
passed
in
quiet
*NL*
surroundings
,
she
felt
more
and
more
deeply
the
loss
of
her
father
which
*NL*
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
ruin
of
Russia
.
She
was
agitated
and
*NL*
incessantly
tortured
by
the
thought
of
the
dangers
to
which
her
brother
,
*NL*
the
only
intimate
person
now
remaining
to
her
,
was
exposed
.
She
was
*NL*
worried
too
about
her
nephew
's
education
for
which
she
had
always
felt
*NL*
herself
incompetent
,
but
in
the
depths
of
her
soul
she
felt
at
peace
--
a
*NL*
peace
arising
from
consciousness
of
having
stifled
those
personal
dreams
*NL*
and
hopes
that
had
been
on
the
point
of
awakening
within
her
and
were
*NL*
related
to
her
meeting
with
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
her
party
the
governor
's
wife
came
to
see
Malvintseva
and
,
*NL*
after
discussing
her
plan
with
the
aunt
,
remarked
that
though
under
*NL*
present
circumstances
a
formal
betrothal
was
,
of
course
,
not
to
be
*NL*
thought
of
,
all
the
same
the
young
people
might
be
brought
together
and
*NL*
could
get
to
know
one
another
.
Malvintseva
expressed
approval
,
and
the
*NL*
governor
's
wife
began
to
speak
of
Rostov
in
Mary
's
presence
,
praising
*NL*
him
and
telling
how
he
had
blushed
when
Princess
Mary
's
name
was
*NL*
mentioned
.
But
Princess
Mary
experienced
a
painful
rather
than
a
joyful
*NL*
feeling
--
her
mental
tranquillity
was
destroyed
,
and
desires
,
doubts
,
*NL*
self-reproach
,
and
hopes
reawoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
two
days
that
elapsed
before
Rostov
called
,
Princess
Mary
*NL*
continually
thought
of
how
she
ought
to
behave
to
him
.
First
she
decided
*NL*
not
to
come
to
the
drawing
room
when
he
called
to
see
her
aunt
--
that
it
*NL*
would
not
be
proper
for
her
,
in
her
deep
mourning
,
to
receive
visitors
;
*NL*
then
she
thought
this
would
be
rude
after
what
he
had
done
for
her
;
then
*NL*
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
aunt
and
the
governor
's
wife
had
intentions
*NL*
concerning
herself
and
Rostov
--
their
looks
and
words
at
times
seemed
to
*NL*
confirm
this
supposition
--
then
she
told
herself
that
only
she
,
with
her
*NL*
sinful
nature
,
could
think
this
of
them
:
they
could
not
forget
that
*NL*
situated
as
she
was
,
while
still
wearing
deep
mourning
,
such
matchmaking
*NL*
would
be
an
insult
to
her
and
to
her
father
's
memory
.
Assuming
that
she
*NL*
did
go
down
to
see
him
,
Princess
Mary
imagined
the
words
he
would
say
to
*NL*
her
and
what
she
would
say
to
him
,
and
these
words
sometimes
seemed
*NL*
undeservedly
cold
and
then
to
mean
too
much
.
More
than
anything
she
*NL*
feared
lest
the
confusion
she
felt
might
overwhelm
her
and
betray
her
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
on
Sunday
after
church
the
footman
announced
in
the
drawing
*NL*
room
that
Count
Rostov
had
called
,
the
princess
showed
no
confusion
,
*NL*
only
a
slight
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
lit
up
with
a
new
*NL*
and
radiant
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
met
him
,
Aunt
?
''
said
she
in
a
calm
voice
,
unable
herself
to
*NL*
understand
that
she
could
be
outwardly
so
calm
and
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Rostov
entered
the
room
,
the
princess
dropped
her
eyes
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
as
if
to
give
the
visitor
time
to
greet
her
aunt
,
and
then
just
*NL*
as
Nicholas
turned
to
her
she
raised
her
head
and
met
his
look
with
*NL*
shining
eyes
.
With
a
movement
full
of
dignity
and
grace
she
half
rose
*NL*
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
,
held
out
her
slender
,
delicate
hand
to
him
,
*NL*
and
began
to
speak
in
a
voice
in
which
for
the
first
time
new
deep
*NL*
womanly
notes
vibrated
.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
who
was
in
the
drawing
*NL*
room
,
looked
at
Princess
Mary
in
bewildered
surprise
.
Herself
a
*NL*
consummate
coquette
,
she
could
not
have
maneuvered
better
on
meeting
a
*NL*
man
she
wished
to
attract
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Either
black
is
particularly
becoming
to
her
or
she
really
has
greatly
*NL*
improved
without
my
having
noticed
it
.
And
above
all
,
what
tact
and
*NL*
grace
!
''
thought
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Princess
Mary
been
capable
of
reflection
at
that
moment
,
she
would
*NL*
have
been
more
surprised
than
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
at
the
change
that
*NL*
had
taken
place
in
herself
.
From
the
moment
she
recognized
that
dear
,
*NL*
loved
face
,
a
new
life
force
took
possession
of
her
and
compelled
her
to
*NL*
speak
and
act
apart
from
her
own
will
.
From
the
time
Rostov
entered
,
her
*NL*
face
became
suddenly
transformed
.
It
was
as
if
a
light
had
been
kindled
*NL*
in
a
carved
and
painted
lantern
and
the
intricate
,
skillful
,
artistic
*NL*
work
on
its
sides
,
that
previously
seemed
dark
,
coarse
,
and
meaningless
,
*NL*
was
suddenly
shown
up
in
unexpected
and
striking
beauty
.
For
the
first
*NL*
time
all
that
pure
,
spiritual
,
inward
travail
through
which
she
had
*NL*
lived
appeared
on
the
surface
.
All
her
inward
labor
,
her
dissatisfaction
*NL*
with
herself
,
her
sufferings
,
her
strivings
after
goodness
,
her
*NL*
meekness
,
love
,
and
self-sacrifice
--
all
this
now
shone
in
those
radiant
*NL*
eyes
,
in
her
delicate
smile
,
and
in
every
trait
of
her
gentle
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rostov
saw
all
this
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
known
her
whole
life
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
the
being
before
him
was
quite
different
from
,
and
better
*NL*
than
,
anyone
he
had
met
before
,
and
above
all
better
than
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
was
very
simple
and
unimportant
.
They
spoke
of
the
*NL*
war
,
and
like
everyone
else
unconsciously
exaggerated
their
sorrow
about
*NL*
it
;
they
spoke
of
their
last
meeting
--
Nicholas
trying
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
--
they
talked
of
the
governor
's
kind
wife
,
of
Nicholas
'
*NL*
relations
,
and
of
Princess
Mary
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
talk
about
her
brother
,
diverting
the
conversation
as
soon
*NL*
as
her
aunt
mentioned
Andrew
.
Evidently
she
could
speak
of
Russia
's
*NL*
misfortunes
with
a
certain
artificiality
,
but
her
brother
was
too
near
*NL*
her
heart
and
she
neither
could
nor
would
speak
lightly
of
him
.
Nicholas
*NL*
noticed
this
,
as
he
noticed
every
shade
of
Princess
Mary
's
character
*NL*
with
an
observation
unusual
to
him
,
and
everything
confirmed
his
*NL*
conviction
that
she
was
a
quite
unusual
and
extraordinary
being
.
*NL*
Nicholas
blushed
and
was
confused
when
people
spoke
to
him
about
the
*NL*
princess
-LRB-
as
she
did
when
he
was
mentioned
-RRB-
and
even
when
he
thought
of
*NL*
her
,
but
in
her
presence
he
felt
quite
at
ease
,
and
said
not
at
all
what
*NL*
he
had
prepared
,
but
what
,
quite
appropriately
,
occurred
to
him
at
the
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
pause
occurred
during
his
short
visit
,
Nicholas
,
as
is
usual
when
*NL*
there
are
children
,
turned
to
Prince
Andrew
's
little
son
,
caressing
him
*NL*
and
asking
whether
he
would
like
to
be
an
hussar
.
He
took
the
boy
on
his
*NL*
knee
,
played
with
him
,
and
looked
round
at
Princess
Mary
.
With
a
*NL*
softened
,
happy
,
timid
look
she
watched
the
boy
she
loved
in
the
arms
of
*NL*
the
man
she
loved
.
Nicholas
also
noticed
that
look
and
,
as
if
*NL*
understanding
it
,
flushed
with
pleasure
and
began
to
kiss
the
boy
with
*NL*
good
natured
playfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
in
mourning
Princess
Mary
did
not
go
out
into
society
,
and
*NL*
Nicholas
did
not
think
it
the
proper
thing
to
visit
her
again
;
but
all
*NL*
the
same
the
governor
's
wife
went
on
with
her
matchmaking
,
passing
on
to
*NL*
Nicholas
the
flattering
things
Princess
Mary
said
of
him
and
vice
versa
,
*NL*
and
insisting
on
his
declaring
himself
to
Princess
Mary
.
For
this
*NL*
purpose
she
arranged
a
meeting
between
the
young
people
at
the
bishop
's
*NL*
house
before
Mass.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Rostov
told
the
governor
's
wife
that
he
would
not
make
any
*NL*
declaration
to
Princess
Mary
,
he
promised
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
at
Tilsit
Rostov
had
not
allowed
himself
to
doubt
that
what
everybody
*NL*
considered
right
was
right
,
so
now
,
after
a
short
but
sincere
struggle
*NL*
between
his
effort
to
arrange
his
life
by
his
own
sense
of
justice
,
and
*NL*
in
obedient
submission
to
circumstances
,
he
chose
the
latter
and
yielded
*NL*
to
the
power
he
felt
irresistibly
carrying
him
he
knew
not
where
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
after
his
promise
to
Sonya
it
would
be
what
he
deemed
base
to
*NL*
declare
his
feelings
to
Princess
Mary
.
And
he
knew
that
he
would
never
*NL*
act
basely
.
But
he
also
knew
-LRB-
or
rather
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
-RRB-
*NL*
that
by
resigning
himself
now
to
the
force
of
circumstances
and
to
those
*NL*
who
were
guiding
him
,
he
was
not
only
doing
nothing
wrong
,
but
was
doing
*NL*
something
very
important
--
more
important
than
anything
he
had
ever
done
*NL*
in
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
meeting
Princess
Mary
,
though
the
course
of
his
life
went
on
*NL*
externally
as
before
,
all
his
former
amusements
lost
their
charm
for
him
*NL*
and
he
often
thought
about
her
.
But
he
never
thought
about
her
as
he
had
*NL*
thought
of
all
the
young
ladies
without
exception
whom
he
had
met
in
*NL*
society
,
nor
as
he
had
for
a
long
time
,
and
at
one
time
rapturously
,
*NL*
thought
about
Sonya
.
He
had
pictured
each
of
those
young
ladies
as
*NL*
almost
all
honest-hearted
young
men
do
,
that
is
,
as
a
possible
wife
,
*NL*
adapting
her
in
his
imagination
to
all
the
conditions
of
married
life
:
a
*NL*
white
dressing
gown
,
his
wife
at
the
tea
table
,
his
wife
's
carriage
,
*NL*
little
ones
,
Mamma
and
Papa
,
their
relations
to
her
,
and
so
on
--
and
*NL*
these
pictures
of
the
future
had
given
him
pleasure
.
But
with
Princess
*NL*
Mary
,
to
whom
they
were
trying
to
get
him
engaged
,
he
could
never
*NL*
picture
anything
of
future
married
life
.
If
he
tried
,
his
pictures
*NL*
seemed
incongruous
and
false
.
It
made
him
afraid
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
dreadful
news
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
of
our
losses
in
killed
and
*NL*
wounded
,
and
the
still
more
terrible
news
of
the
loss
of
Moscow
reached
*NL*
Voronezh
in
the
middle
of
September
.
Princess
Mary
,
having
learned
of
*NL*
her
brother
's
wound
only
from
the
Gazette
and
having
no
definite
news
of
*NL*
him
,
prepared
-LRB-
so
Nicholas
heard
,
he
had
not
seen
her
again
himself
-RRB-
to
*NL*
set
off
in
search
of
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
received
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
the
abandonment
*NL*
of
Moscow
,
Rostov
was
not
seized
with
despair
,
anger
,
the
desire
for
*NL*
vengeance
,
or
any
feeling
of
that
kind
,
but
everything
in
Voronezh
*NL*
suddenly
seemed
to
him
dull
and
tiresome
,
and
he
experienced
an
*NL*
indefinite
feeling
of
shame
and
awkwardness
.
The
conversations
he
heard
*NL*
seemed
to
him
insincere
;
he
did
not
know
how
to
judge
all
these
affairs
*NL*
and
felt
that
only
in
the
regiment
would
everything
again
become
clear
*NL*
to
him
.
He
made
haste
to
finish
buying
the
horses
,
and
often
became
*NL*
unreasonably
angry
with
his
servant
and
squadron
quartermaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
before
his
departure
a
special
thanksgiving
,
at
which
*NL*
Nicholas
was
present
,
was
held
in
the
cathedral
for
the
Russian
victory
.
*NL*
He
stood
a
little
behind
the
governor
and
held
himself
with
military
*NL*
decorum
through
the
service
,
meditating
on
a
great
variety
of
subjects
.
*NL*
When
the
service
was
over
the
governor
's
wife
beckoned
him
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
the
princess
?
''
she
asked
,
indicating
with
a
movement
of
*NL*
her
head
a
lady
standing
on
the
opposite
side
,
beyond
the
choir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
immediately
recognized
Princess
Mary
not
so
much
by
the
profile
*NL*
he
saw
under
her
bonnet
as
by
the
feeling
of
solicitude
,
timidity
,
and
*NL*
pity
that
immediately
overcame
him
.
Princess
Mary
,
evidently
engrossed
*NL*
by
her
thoughts
,
was
crossing
herself
for
the
last
time
before
leaving
*NL*
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
looked
at
her
face
with
surprise
.
It
was
the
same
face
he
had
*NL*
seen
before
,
there
was
the
same
general
expression
of
refined
,
inner
,
*NL*
spiritual
labor
,
but
now
it
was
quite
differently
lit
up
.
There
was
a
*NL*
pathetic
expression
of
sorrow
,
prayer
,
and
hope
in
it
.
As
had
occurred
*NL*
before
when
she
was
present
,
Nicholas
went
up
to
her
without
waiting
to
*NL*
be
prompted
by
the
governor
's
wife
and
not
asking
himself
whether
or
not
*NL*
it
was
right
and
proper
to
address
her
here
in
church
,
and
told
her
he
*NL*
had
heard
of
her
trouble
and
sympathized
with
his
whole
soul
.
As
soon
as
*NL*
she
heard
his
voice
a
vivid
glow
kindled
in
her
face
,
lighting
up
both
*NL*
her
sorrow
and
her
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
thing
I
wanted
to
tell
you
,
Princess
,
''
said
Rostov
.
``
It
is
*NL*
that
if
your
brother
,
Prince
Andrew
Nikolievich
,
were
not
living
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
at
once
announced
in
the
Gazette
,
as
he
is
a
colonel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
looked
at
him
,
not
grasping
what
he
was
saying
,
but
cheered
*NL*
by
the
expression
of
regretful
sympathy
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
known
so
many
cases
of
a
splinter
wound
''
-LRB-
the
Gazette
said
*NL*
it
was
a
shell
-RRB-
``
either
proving
fatal
at
once
or
being
very
slight
,
''
*NL*
continued
Nicholas
.
``
We
must
hope
for
the
best
,
and
I
am
sure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
would
be
so
dread
...
''
she
began
and
,
prevented
by
agitation
*NL*
from
finishing
,
she
bent
her
head
with
a
movement
as
graceful
as
*NL*
everything
she
did
in
his
presence
and
,
looking
up
at
him
gratefully
,
*NL*
went
out
,
following
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Nicholas
did
not
go
out
,
but
stayed
at
home
to
settle
some
*NL*
accounts
with
the
horse
dealers
.
When
he
had
finished
that
business
it
*NL*
was
already
too
late
to
go
anywhere
but
still
too
early
to
go
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
for
a
long
time
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
,
reflecting
on
his
*NL*
life
,
a
thing
he
rarely
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
had
made
an
agreeable
impression
on
him
when
he
had
met
*NL*
her
in
Smolensk
province
.
His
having
encountered
her
in
such
exceptional
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
his
mother
having
at
one
time
mentioned
her
to
him
as
*NL*
a
good
match
,
had
drawn
his
particular
attention
to
her
.
When
he
met
her
*NL*
again
in
Voronezh
the
impression
she
made
on
him
was
not
merely
pleasing
*NL*
but
powerful
.
Nicholas
had
been
struck
by
the
peculiar
moral
beauty
he
*NL*
observed
in
her
at
this
time
.
He
was
,
however
,
preparing
to
go
away
and
*NL*
it
had
not
entered
his
head
to
regret
that
he
was
thus
depriving
himself
*NL*
of
chances
of
meeting
her
.
But
that
day
's
encounter
in
church
had
,
he
*NL*
felt
,
sunk
deeper
than
was
desirable
for
his
peace
of
mind
.
That
pale
,
*NL*
sad
,
refined
face
,
that
radiant
look
,
those
gentle
graceful
gestures
,
*NL*
and
especially
the
deep
and
tender
sorrow
expressed
in
all
her
features
*NL*
agitated
him
and
evoked
his
sympathy
.
In
men
Rostov
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
see
the
expression
of
a
higher
spiritual
life
-LRB-
that
was
why
he
did
not
*NL*
like
Prince
Andrew
-RRB-
and
he
referred
to
it
contemptuously
as
philosophy
*NL*
and
dreaminess
,
but
in
Princess
Mary
that
very
sorrow
which
revealed
the
*NL*
depth
of
a
whole
spiritual
world
foreign
to
him
was
an
irresistible
*NL*
attraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
be
a
wonderful
woman
.
A
real
angel
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Why
*NL*
am
I
not
free
?
Why
was
I
in
such
a
hurry
with
Sonya
?
''
And
he
*NL*
involuntarily
compared
the
two
:
the
lack
of
spirituality
in
the
one
and
*NL*
the
abundance
of
it
in
the
other
--
a
spirituality
he
himself
lacked
and
*NL*
therefore
valued
most
highly
.
He
tried
to
picture
what
would
happen
were
*NL*
he
free
.
How
he
would
propose
to
her
and
how
she
would
become
his
wife
.
*NL*
But
no
,
he
could
not
imagine
that
.
He
felt
awed
,
and
no
clear
picture
*NL*
presented
itself
to
his
mind
.
He
had
long
ago
pictured
to
himself
a
*NL*
future
with
Sonya
,
and
that
was
all
clear
and
simple
just
because
it
had
*NL*
all
been
thought
out
and
he
knew
all
there
was
in
Sonya
,
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
picture
a
future
with
Princess
Mary
,
because
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
her
but
simply
loved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reveries
about
Sonya
had
had
something
merry
and
playful
in
them
,
but
to
*NL*
dream
of
Princess
Mary
was
always
difficult
and
a
little
frightening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
she
prayed
!
''
he
thought
.
``
It
was
plain
that
her
whole
soul
was
in
*NL*
her
prayer
.
Yes
,
that
was
the
prayer
that
moves
mountains
,
and
I
am
sure
*NL*
her
prayer
will
be
answered
.
Why
do
n't
I
pray
for
what
I
want
?
''
he
*NL*
suddenly
thought
.
``
What
do
I
want
?
To
be
free
,
released
from
Sonya
...
*NL*
She
was
right
,
''
he
thought
,
remembering
what
the
governor
's
wife
had
*NL*
said
:
``
Nothing
but
misfortune
can
come
of
marrying
Sonya
.
Muddles
,
grief
*NL*
for
Mamma
...
business
difficulties
...
muddles
,
terrible
muddles
!
*NL*
Besides
,
I
do
n't
love
her
--
not
as
I
should
.
O
,
God
!
release
me
from
this
*NL*
dreadful
,
inextricable
position
!
''
he
suddenly
began
to
pray
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
prayer
can
move
mountains
,
but
one
must
have
faith
and
not
pray
as
*NL*
Natasha
and
I
used
to
as
children
,
that
the
snow
might
turn
into
sugar
--
*NL*
and
then
run
out
into
the
yard
to
see
whether
it
had
done
so
.
No
,
but
I
*NL*
am
not
praying
for
trifles
now
,
''
he
thought
as
he
put
his
pipe
down
in
a
*NL*
corner
,
and
folding
his
hands
placed
himself
before
the
icon
.
Softened
*NL*
by
memories
of
Princess
Mary
he
began
to
pray
as
he
had
not
done
for
a
*NL*
long
time
.
Tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
throat
when
the
door
opened
*NL*
and
Lavrushka
came
in
with
some
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blockhead
!
Why
do
you
come
in
without
being
called
?
''
cried
Nicholas
,
*NL*
quickly
changing
his
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
governor
,
''
said
Lavrushka
in
a
sleepy
voice
.
``
A
courier
has
*NL*
arrived
and
there
's
a
letter
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
thanks
.
You
can
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
took
the
two
letters
,
one
of
which
was
from
his
mother
and
the
*NL*
other
from
Sonya
.
He
recognized
them
by
the
handwriting
and
opened
*NL*
Sonya
's
first
.
He
had
read
only
a
few
lines
when
he
turned
pale
and
his
*NL*
eyes
opened
wide
with
fear
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
possible
!
''
he
cried
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unable
to
sit
still
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
holding
the
letter
and
*NL*
reading
it
.
He
glanced
through
it
,
then
read
it
again
,
and
then
again
,
*NL*
and
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
raised
his
shoulders
,
*NL*
stretching
out
his
hands
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
fixed
.
*NL*
What
he
had
just
been
praying
for
with
confidence
that
God
would
hear
*NL*
him
had
come
to
pass
;
but
Nicholas
was
as
much
astonished
as
if
it
were
*NL*
something
extraordinary
and
unexpected
,
and
as
if
the
very
fact
that
it
*NL*
had
happened
so
quickly
proved
that
it
had
not
come
from
God
to
whom
he
*NL*
had
prayed
,
but
by
some
ordinary
coincidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
Nicholas
,
quite
voluntary
letter
*NL*
from
Sonya
freed
him
from
the
knot
that
fettered
him
and
from
which
*NL*
there
had
seemed
no
escape
.
She
wrote
that
the
last
unfortunate
events
--
*NL*
the
loss
of
almost
the
whole
of
the
Rostovs
'
Moscow
property
--
and
the
*NL*
countess
'
repeatedly
expressed
wish
that
Nicholas
should
marry
Princess
*NL*
Bolkonskaya
,
together
with
his
silence
and
coldness
of
late
,
had
all
*NL*
combined
to
make
her
decide
to
release
him
from
his
promise
and
set
him
*NL*
completely
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
too
painful
to
me
to
think
that
I
might
be
a
cause
of
sorrow
*NL*
or
discord
in
the
family
that
has
been
so
good
to
me
-LRB-
she
wrote
-RRB-
,
and
my
*NL*
love
has
no
aim
but
the
happiness
of
those
I
love
;
so
,
Nicholas
,
I
beg
*NL*
you
to
consider
yourself
free
,
and
to
be
assured
that
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
everything
,
no
one
can
love
you
more
than
does
*NL*
*NL*
Your
Sonya
*NL*
*NL*
Both
letters
were
written
from
Troitsa
.
The
other
,
from
the
countess
,
*NL*
described
their
last
days
in
Moscow
,
their
departure
,
the
fire
,
and
the
*NL*
destruction
of
all
their
property
.
In
this
letter
the
countess
also
*NL*
mentioned
that
Prince
Andrew
was
among
the
wounded
traveling
with
them
;
*NL*
his
state
was
very
critical
,
but
the
doctor
said
there
was
now
more
*NL*
hope
.
Sonya
and
Natasha
were
nursing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Nicholas
took
his
mother
's
letter
and
went
to
see
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
Neither
he
nor
she
said
a
word
about
what
``
Natasha
nursing
him
''
*NL*
might
mean
,
but
thanks
to
this
letter
Nicholas
suddenly
became
almost
as
*NL*
intimate
with
the
princess
as
if
they
were
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
he
saw
Princess
Mary
off
on
her
journey
to
Yaroslavl
,
*NL*
and
a
few
days
later
left
to
rejoin
his
regiment
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
's
letter
written
from
Troitsa
,
which
had
come
as
an
answer
to
*NL*
Nicholas
'
prayer
,
was
prompted
by
this
:
the
thought
of
getting
Nicholas
*NL*
married
to
an
heiress
occupied
the
old
countess
'
mind
more
and
more
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
Sonya
was
the
chief
obstacle
to
this
happening
,
and
Sonya
's
*NL*
life
in
the
countess
'
house
had
grown
harder
and
harder
,
especially
*NL*
after
they
had
received
a
letter
from
Nicholas
telling
of
his
meeting
*NL*
with
Princess
Mary
in
Bogucharovo
.
The
countess
let
no
occasion
slip
of
*NL*
making
humiliating
or
cruel
allusions
to
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
few
days
before
they
left
Moscow
,
moved
and
excited
by
all
that
*NL*
was
going
on
,
she
called
Sonya
to
her
and
,
instead
of
reproaching
and
*NL*
making
demands
on
her
,
tearfully
implored
her
to
sacrifice
herself
and
*NL*
repay
all
that
the
family
had
done
for
her
by
breaking
off
her
*NL*
engagement
with
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
at
peace
till
you
promise
me
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
burst
into
hysterical
tears
and
replied
through
her
sobs
that
she
*NL*
would
do
anything
and
was
prepared
for
anything
,
but
gave
no
actual
*NL*
promise
and
could
not
bring
herself
to
decide
to
do
what
was
demanded
of
*NL*
her
.
She
must
sacrifice
herself
for
the
family
that
had
reared
and
*NL*
brought
her
up
.
To
sacrifice
herself
for
others
was
Sonya
's
habit
.
Her
*NL*
position
in
the
house
was
such
that
only
by
sacrifice
could
she
show
her
*NL*
worth
,
and
she
was
accustomed
to
this
and
loved
doing
it
.
But
in
all
her
*NL*
former
acts
of
self-sacrifice
she
had
been
happily
conscious
that
they
*NL*
raised
her
in
her
own
esteem
and
in
that
of
others
,
and
so
made
her
more
*NL*
worthy
of
Nicholas
whom
she
loved
more
than
anything
in
the
world
.
But
*NL*
now
they
wanted
her
to
sacrifice
the
very
thing
that
constituted
the
*NL*
whole
reward
for
her
self-sacrifice
and
the
whole
meaning
of
her
life
.
*NL*
And
for
the
first
time
she
felt
bitterness
against
those
who
had
been
*NL*
her
benefactors
only
to
torture
her
the
more
painfully
;
she
felt
jealous
*NL*
of
Natasha
who
had
never
experienced
anything
of
this
sort
,
had
never
*NL*
needed
to
sacrifice
herself
,
but
made
others
sacrifice
themselves
for
*NL*
her
and
yet
was
beloved
by
everybody
.
And
for
the
first
time
Sonya
felt
*NL*
that
out
of
her
pure
,
quiet
love
for
Nicholas
a
passionate
feeling
was
*NL*
beginning
to
grow
up
which
was
stronger
than
principle
,
virtue
,
or
*NL*
religion
.
Under
the
influence
of
this
feeling
Sonya
,
whose
life
of
*NL*
dependence
had
taught
her
involuntarily
to
be
secretive
,
having
answered
*NL*
the
countess
in
vague
general
terms
,
avoided
talking
with
her
and
*NL*
resolved
to
wait
till
she
should
see
Nicholas
,
not
in
order
to
set
him
*NL*
free
but
on
the
contrary
at
that
meeting
to
bind
him
to
her
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bustle
and
terror
of
the
Rostovs
'
last
days
in
Moscow
stifled
the
*NL*
gloomy
thoughts
that
oppressed
Sonya
.
She
was
glad
to
find
escape
from
*NL*
them
in
practical
activity
.
But
when
she
heard
of
Prince
Andrew
's
*NL*
presence
in
their
house
,
despite
her
sincere
pity
for
him
and
for
*NL*
Natasha
,
she
was
seized
by
a
joyful
and
superstitious
feeling
that
God
*NL*
did
not
intend
her
to
be
separated
from
Nicholas
.
She
knew
that
Natasha
*NL*
loved
no
one
but
Prince
Andrew
and
had
never
ceased
to
love
him
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
being
thrown
together
again
under
such
terrible
circumstances
*NL*
they
would
again
fall
in
love
with
one
another
,
and
that
Nicholas
would
*NL*
then
not
be
able
to
marry
Princess
Mary
as
they
would
be
within
the
*NL*
prohibited
degrees
of
affinity
.
Despite
all
the
terror
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
during
those
last
days
and
during
the
first
days
of
their
*NL*
journey
,
this
feeling
that
Providence
was
intervening
in
her
personal
*NL*
affairs
cheered
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Troitsa
monastery
the
Rostovs
first
broke
their
journey
for
a
*NL*
whole
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
large
rooms
were
assigned
to
them
in
the
monastery
hostelry
,
one
*NL*
of
which
was
occupied
by
Prince
Andrew
.
The
wounded
man
was
much
better
*NL*
that
day
and
Natasha
was
sitting
with
him
.
In
the
next
room
sat
the
*NL*
count
and
countess
respectfully
conversing
with
the
prior
,
who
was
*NL*
calling
on
them
as
old
acquaintances
and
benefactors
of
the
monastery
.
*NL*
Sonya
was
there
too
,
tormented
by
curiosity
as
to
what
Prince
Andrew
and
*NL*
Natasha
were
talking
about
.
She
heard
the
sound
of
their
voices
through
*NL*
the
door
.
That
door
opened
and
Natasha
came
out
,
looking
excited
.
Not
*NL*
noticing
the
monk
,
who
had
risen
to
greet
her
and
was
drawing
back
the
*NL*
wide
sleeve
on
his
right
arm
,
she
went
up
to
Sonya
and
took
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
what
are
you
about
?
Come
here
!
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
went
up
to
the
monk
for
his
blessing
,
and
he
advised
her
to
pray
*NL*
for
aid
to
God
and
His
saint
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
prior
withdrew
,
Natasha
took
her
friend
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
went
with
her
into
the
unoccupied
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
,
will
he
live
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Sonya
,
how
happy
I
am
,
and
how
*NL*
unhappy
!
...
Sonya
,
dovey
,
everything
is
as
it
used
to
be
.
If
only
he
*NL*
lives
!
He
can
not
...
because
...
because
...
of
''
and
Natasha
burst
into
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
I
knew
it
!
Thank
God
!
''
murmured
Sonya
.
``
He
will
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
not
less
agitated
than
her
friend
by
the
latter
's
fear
and
*NL*
grief
and
by
her
own
personal
feelings
which
she
shared
with
no
one
.
*NL*
Sobbing
,
she
kissed
and
comforted
Natasha
.
``
If
only
he
lives
!
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
Having
wept
,
talked
,
and
wiped
away
their
tears
,
the
two
*NL*
friends
went
together
to
Prince
Andrew
's
door
.
Natasha
opened
it
*NL*
cautiously
and
glanced
into
the
room
,
Sonya
standing
beside
her
at
the
*NL*
half-open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
was
lying
raised
high
on
three
pillows
.
His
pale
face
was
*NL*
calm
,
his
eyes
closed
,
and
they
could
see
his
regular
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
Natasha
!
''
Sonya
suddenly
almost
screamed
,
catching
her
companion
's
*NL*
arm
and
stepping
back
from
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
that
,
that
...
''
said
Sonya
,
with
a
white
face
and
trembling
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
softly
closed
the
door
and
went
with
Sonya
to
the
window
,
not
*NL*
yet
understanding
what
the
latter
was
telling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
,
''
said
Sonya
with
a
solemn
and
frightened
expression
.
``
You
*NL*
remember
when
I
looked
in
the
mirror
for
you
...
at
Otradnoe
at
*NL*
Christmas
?
Do
you
remember
what
I
saw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
cried
Natasha
opening
her
eyes
wide
,
and
vaguely
recalling
*NL*
that
Sonya
had
told
her
something
about
Prince
Andrew
whom
she
had
seen
*NL*
lying
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
?
''
Sonya
went
on
.
``
I
saw
it
then
and
told
everybody
,
you
*NL*
and
Dunyasha
.
I
saw
him
lying
on
a
bed
,
''
said
she
,
making
a
gesture
with
*NL*
her
hand
and
a
lifted
finger
at
each
detail
,
``
and
that
he
had
his
eyes
*NL*
closed
and
was
covered
just
with
a
pink
quilt
,
and
that
his
hands
were
*NL*
folded
,
''
she
concluded
,
convincing
herself
that
the
details
she
had
just
*NL*
seen
were
exactly
what
she
had
seen
in
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
in
fact
seen
nothing
then
but
had
mentioned
the
first
thing
that
*NL*
came
into
her
head
,
but
what
she
had
invented
then
seemed
to
her
now
as
*NL*
real
as
any
other
recollection
.
She
not
only
remembered
what
she
had
*NL*
then
said
--
that
he
turned
to
look
at
her
and
smiled
and
was
covered
with
*NL*
something
red
--
but
was
firmly
convinced
that
she
had
then
seen
and
said
*NL*
that
he
was
covered
with
a
pink
quilt
and
that
his
eyes
were
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
it
really
was
pink
!
''
cried
Natasha
,
who
now
thought
she
too
*NL*
remembered
the
word
pink
being
used
,
and
saw
in
this
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
and
mysterious
part
of
the
prediction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
does
it
mean
?
''
she
added
meditatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
it
is
all
so
strange
,
''
replied
Sonya
,
clutching
at
*NL*
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
Prince
Andrew
rang
and
Natasha
went
to
him
,
but
*NL*
Sonya
,
feeling
unusually
excited
and
touched
,
remained
at
the
window
*NL*
thinking
about
the
strangeness
of
what
had
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
an
opportunity
that
day
to
send
letters
to
the
army
,
and
the
*NL*
countess
was
writing
to
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sonya
!
''
said
the
countess
,
raising
her
eyes
from
her
letter
as
her
*NL*
niece
passed
,
``
Sonya
,
wo
n't
you
write
to
Nicholas
?
''
She
spoke
in
a
soft
,
*NL*
tremulous
voice
,
and
in
the
weary
eyes
that
looked
over
her
spectacles
*NL*
Sonya
read
all
that
the
countess
meant
to
convey
with
these
words
.
Those
*NL*
eyes
expressed
entreaty
,
shame
at
having
to
ask
,
fear
of
a
refusal
,
and
*NL*
readiness
for
relentless
hatred
in
case
of
such
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
went
up
to
the
countess
and
,
kneeling
down
,
kissed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mamma
,
I
will
write
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
softened
,
excited
,
and
touched
by
all
that
had
occurred
that
*NL*
day
,
especially
by
the
mysterious
fulfillment
she
had
just
seen
of
her
*NL*
vision
.
Now
that
she
knew
that
the
renewal
of
Natasha
's
relations
with
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
would
prevent
Nicholas
from
marrying
Princess
Mary
,
she
*NL*
was
joyfully
conscious
of
a
return
of
that
self-sacrificing
spirit
in
*NL*
which
she
was
accustomed
to
live
and
loved
to
live
.
So
with
a
joyful
*NL*
consciousness
of
performing
a
magnanimous
deed
--
interrupted
several
*NL*
times
by
the
tears
that
dimmed
her
velvety
black
eyes
--
she
wrote
that
*NL*
touching
letter
the
arrival
of
which
had
so
amazed
Nicholas
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
and
soldiers
who
had
arrested
Pierre
treated
him
with
*NL*
hostility
but
yet
with
respect
,
in
the
guardhouse
to
which
he
was
taken
.
*NL*
In
their
attitude
toward
him
could
still
be
felt
both
uncertainty
as
to
*NL*
who
he
might
be
--
perhaps
a
very
important
person
--
and
hostility
as
a
*NL*
result
of
their
recent
personal
conflict
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
guard
was
relieved
next
morning
,
Pierre
felt
that
for
the
*NL*
new
guard
--
both
officers
and
men
--
he
was
not
as
interesting
as
he
had
*NL*
been
to
his
captors
;
and
in
fact
the
guard
of
the
second
day
did
not
*NL*
recognize
in
this
big
,
stout
man
in
a
peasant
coat
the
vigorous
person
*NL*
who
had
fought
so
desperately
with
the
marauder
and
the
convoy
and
had
*NL*
uttered
those
solemn
words
about
saving
a
child
;
they
saw
in
him
only
*NL*
No.
17
of
the
captured
Russians
,
arrested
and
detained
for
some
reason
*NL*
by
order
of
the
Higher
Command
.
If
they
noticed
anything
remarkable
*NL*
about
Pierre
,
it
was
only
his
unabashed
,
meditative
concentration
and
*NL*
thoughtfulness
,
and
the
way
he
spoke
French
,
which
struck
them
as
*NL*
surprisingly
good
.
In
spite
of
this
he
was
placed
that
day
with
the
*NL*
other
arrested
suspects
,
as
the
separate
room
he
had
occupied
was
*NL*
required
by
an
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
Russians
confined
with
Pierre
were
men
of
the
lowest
class
and
,
*NL*
recognizing
him
as
a
gentleman
,
they
all
avoided
him
,
more
especially
as
*NL*
he
spoke
French
.
Pierre
felt
sad
at
hearing
them
making
fun
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
he
learned
that
all
these
prisoners
-LRB-
he
,
probably
,
among
*NL*
them
-RRB-
were
to
be
tried
for
incendiarism
.
On
the
third
day
he
was
taken
*NL*
with
the
others
to
a
house
where
a
French
general
with
a
white
mustache
*NL*
sat
with
two
colonels
and
other
Frenchmen
with
scarves
on
their
arms
.
*NL*
With
the
precision
and
definiteness
customary
in
addressing
prisoners
,
*NL*
and
which
is
supposed
to
preclude
human
frailty
,
Pierre
like
the
others
*NL*
was
questioned
as
to
who
he
was
,
where
he
had
been
,
with
what
object
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
questions
,
like
questions
put
at
trials
generally
,
left
the
*NL*
essence
of
the
matter
aside
,
shut
out
the
possibility
of
that
essence
's
*NL*
being
revealed
,
and
were
designed
only
to
form
a
channel
through
which
*NL*
the
judges
wished
the
answers
of
the
accused
to
flow
so
as
to
lead
to
*NL*
the
desired
result
,
namely
a
conviction
.
As
soon
as
Pierre
began
to
say
*NL*
anything
that
did
not
fit
in
with
that
aim
,
the
channel
was
removed
and
*NL*
the
water
could
flow
to
waste
.
Pierre
felt
,
moreover
,
what
the
accused
*NL*
always
feel
at
their
trial
,
perplexity
as
to
why
these
questions
were
*NL*
put
to
him
.
He
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
only
out
of
condescension
or
a
*NL*
kind
of
civility
that
this
device
of
placing
a
channel
was
employed
.
He
*NL*
knew
he
was
in
these
men
's
power
,
that
only
by
force
had
they
brought
*NL*
him
there
,
that
force
alone
gave
them
the
right
to
demand
answers
to
*NL*
their
questions
,
and
that
the
sole
object
of
that
assembly
was
to
*NL*
inculpate
him
.
And
so
,
as
they
had
the
power
and
wish
to
inculpate
him
,
*NL*
this
expedient
of
an
inquiry
and
trial
seemed
unnecessary
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
any
answer
would
lead
to
conviction
.
When
asked
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
when
he
was
arrested
,
Pierre
replied
in
a
rather
tragic
manner
*NL*
that
he
was
restoring
to
its
parents
a
child
he
had
saved
from
the
*NL*
flames
.
Why
had
he
fought
the
marauder
?
Pierre
answered
that
he
``
was
*NL*
protecting
a
woman
,
''
and
that
``
to
protect
a
woman
who
was
being
insulted
*NL*
was
the
duty
of
every
man
;
that
...
''
They
interrupted
him
,
for
this
was
*NL*
not
to
the
point
.
Why
was
he
in
the
yard
of
a
burning
house
where
*NL*
witnesses
had
seen
him
?
He
replied
that
he
had
gone
out
to
see
what
was
*NL*
happening
in
Moscow
.
Again
they
interrupted
him
:
they
had
not
asked
*NL*
where
he
was
going
,
but
why
he
was
found
near
the
fire
?
Who
was
he
?
they
*NL*
asked
,
repeating
their
first
question
,
which
he
had
declined
to
answer
.
*NL*
Again
he
replied
that
he
could
not
answer
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
that
down
,
that
's
bad
...
very
bad
,
''
sternly
remarked
the
general
*NL*
with
the
white
mustache
and
red
flushed
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fourth
day
fires
broke
out
on
the
Zubovski
rampart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
and
thirteen
others
were
moved
to
the
coach
house
of
a
merchant
's
*NL*
house
near
the
Crimean
bridge
.
On
his
way
through
the
streets
Pierre
*NL*
felt
stifled
by
the
smoke
which
seemed
to
hang
over
the
whole
city
.
*NL*
Fires
were
visible
on
all
sides
.
He
did
not
then
realize
the
*NL*
significance
of
the
burning
of
Moscow
,
and
looked
at
the
fires
with
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
four
days
in
the
coach
house
near
the
Crimean
bridge
and
*NL*
during
that
time
learned
,
from
the
talk
of
the
French
soldiers
,
that
all
*NL*
those
confined
there
were
awaiting
a
decision
which
might
come
any
day
*NL*
from
the
marshal
.
What
marshal
this
was
,
Pierre
could
not
learn
from
the
*NL*
soldiers
.
Evidently
for
them
``
the
marshal
''
represented
a
very
high
and
*NL*
rather
mysterious
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
first
days
,
before
the
eighth
of
September
when
the
prisoners
were
*NL*
had
up
for
a
second
examination
,
were
the
hardest
of
all
for
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eighth
of
September
an
officer
--
a
very
important
one
judging
by
*NL*
the
respect
the
guards
showed
him
--
entered
the
coach
house
where
the
*NL*
prisoners
were
.
This
officer
,
probably
someone
on
the
staff
,
was
holding
*NL*
a
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
called
over
all
the
Russians
there
,
naming
*NL*
Pierre
as
``
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
.
''
Glancing
indolently
and
*NL*
indifferently
at
all
the
prisoners
,
he
ordered
the
officer
in
charge
to
*NL*
have
them
decently
dressed
and
tidied
up
before
taking
them
to
the
*NL*
marshal
.
An
hour
later
a
squad
of
soldiers
arrived
and
Pierre
with
*NL*
thirteen
others
was
led
to
the
Virgin
's
Field
.
It
was
a
fine
day
,
sunny
*NL*
after
rain
,
and
the
air
was
unusually
pure
.
The
smoke
did
not
hang
low
*NL*
as
on
the
day
when
Pierre
had
been
taken
from
the
guardhouse
on
the
*NL*
Zubovski
rampart
,
but
rose
through
the
pure
air
in
columns
.
No
flames
*NL*
were
seen
,
but
columns
of
smoke
rose
on
all
sides
,
and
all
Moscow
as
far
*NL*
as
Pierre
could
see
was
one
vast
charred
ruin
.
On
all
sides
there
were
*NL*
waste
spaces
with
only
stoves
and
chimney
stacks
still
standing
,
and
*NL*
here
and
there
the
blackened
walls
of
some
brick
houses
.
Pierre
gazed
at
*NL*
the
ruins
and
did
not
recognize
districts
he
had
known
well
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
he
could
see
churches
that
had
not
been
burned
.
The
Kremlin
,
which
*NL*
was
not
destroyed
,
gleamed
white
in
the
distance
with
its
towers
and
the
*NL*
belfry
of
Ivan
the
Great
.
The
domes
of
the
New
Convent
of
the
Virgin
*NL*
glittered
brightly
and
its
bells
were
ringing
particularly
clearly
.
*NL*
These
bells
reminded
Pierre
that
it
was
Sunday
and
the
feast
of
the
*NL*
Nativity
of
the
Virgin
.
But
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
to
celebrate
this
*NL*
holiday
:
everywhere
were
blackened
ruins
,
and
the
few
Russians
to
be
*NL*
seen
were
tattered
and
frightened
people
who
tried
to
hide
when
they
saw
*NL*
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
the
Russian
nest
was
ruined
and
destroyed
,
but
in
*NL*
place
of
the
Russian
order
of
life
that
had
been
destroyed
,
Pierre
*NL*
unconsciously
felt
that
a
quite
different
,
firm
,
French
order
had
been
*NL*
established
over
this
ruined
nest
.
He
felt
this
in
the
looks
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
who
,
marching
in
regular
ranks
briskly
and
gaily
,
were
*NL*
escorting
him
and
the
other
criminals
;
he
felt
it
in
the
looks
of
an
*NL*
important
French
official
in
a
carriage
and
pair
driven
by
a
soldier
,
*NL*
whom
they
met
on
the
way
.
He
felt
it
in
the
merry
sounds
of
regimental
*NL*
music
he
heard
from
the
left
side
of
the
field
,
and
felt
and
realized
it
*NL*
especially
from
the
list
of
prisoners
the
French
officer
had
read
out
*NL*
when
he
came
that
morning
.
Pierre
had
been
taken
by
one
set
of
soldiers
*NL*
and
led
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
place
with
dozens
of
other
men
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
that
they
might
have
forgotten
him
,
or
confused
him
with
*NL*
the
others
.
But
no
:
the
answers
he
had
given
when
questioned
had
come
*NL*
back
to
him
in
his
designation
as
``
the
man
who
does
not
give
his
name
,
''
*NL*
and
under
that
appellation
,
which
to
Pierre
seemed
terrible
,
they
were
*NL*
now
leading
him
somewhere
with
unhesitating
assurance
on
their
faces
*NL*
that
he
and
all
the
other
prisoners
were
exactly
the
ones
they
wanted
*NL*
and
that
they
were
being
taken
to
the
proper
place
.
Pierre
felt
himself
*NL*
to
be
an
insignificant
chip
fallen
among
the
wheels
of
a
machine
whose
*NL*
action
he
did
not
understand
but
which
was
working
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
the
other
prisoners
were
taken
to
the
right
side
of
the
Virgin
's
*NL*
Field
,
to
a
large
white
house
with
an
immense
garden
not
far
from
the
*NL*
convent
.
This
was
Prince
Shcherbitov
's
house
,
where
Pierre
had
often
*NL*
been
in
other
days
,
and
which
,
as
he
learned
from
the
talk
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
was
now
occupied
by
the
marshal
,
the
Duke
of
Eckmuhl
-LRB-
Davout
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
taken
to
the
entrance
and
led
into
the
house
one
by
one
.
*NL*
Pierre
was
the
sixth
to
enter
.
He
was
conducted
through
a
glass
gallery
,
*NL*
an
anteroom
,
and
a
hall
,
which
were
familiar
to
him
,
into
a
long
low
*NL*
study
at
the
door
of
which
stood
an
adjutant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
,
spectacles
on
nose
,
sat
bent
over
a
table
at
the
further
end
of
*NL*
the
room
.
Pierre
went
close
up
to
him
,
but
Davout
,
evidently
consulting
*NL*
a
paper
that
lay
before
him
,
did
not
look
up
.
Without
raising
his
eyes
,
*NL*
he
said
in
a
low
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
silent
because
he
was
incapable
of
uttering
a
word
.
To
him
*NL*
Davout
was
not
merely
a
French
general
,
but
a
man
notorious
for
his
*NL*
cruelty
.
Looking
at
his
cold
face
,
as
he
sat
like
a
stern
schoolmaster
*NL*
who
was
prepared
to
wait
awhile
for
an
answer
,
Pierre
felt
that
every
*NL*
instant
of
delay
might
cost
him
his
life
;
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
*NL*
say
.
He
did
not
venture
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
at
his
first
*NL*
examination
,
yet
to
disclose
his
rank
and
position
was
dangerous
and
*NL*
embarrassing
.
So
he
was
silent
.
But
before
he
had
decided
what
to
do
,
*NL*
Davout
raised
his
head
,
pushed
his
spectacles
back
on
his
forehead
,
*NL*
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
and
looked
intently
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
man
,
''
he
said
in
a
cold
,
measured
tone
,
evidently
*NL*
calculated
to
frighten
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chill
that
had
been
running
down
Pierre
's
back
now
seized
his
head
*NL*
as
in
a
vise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
know
me
,
General
,
I
have
never
seen
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
Russian
spy
,
''
Davout
interrupted
,
addressing
another
general
*NL*
who
was
present
,
but
whom
Pierre
had
not
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
turned
away
.
With
an
unexpected
reverberation
in
his
voice
Pierre
*NL*
rapidly
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monseigneur
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
remembering
that
Davout
was
a
duke
.
*NL*
``
No
,
monseigneur
,
you
can
not
have
known
me
.
I
am
a
militia
officer
and
*NL*
have
not
quitted
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
asked
Davout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bezukhov
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
proof
have
I
that
you
are
not
lying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
!
''
exclaimed
Pierre
,
not
in
an
offended
but
in
a
pleading
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
looked
up
and
gazed
intently
at
him
.
For
some
seconds
they
looked
*NL*
at
one
another
,
and
that
look
saved
Pierre
.
Apart
from
conditions
of
war
*NL*
and
law
,
that
look
established
human
relations
between
the
two
men
.
At
*NL*
that
moment
an
immense
number
of
things
passed
dimly
through
both
their
*NL*
minds
,
and
they
realized
that
they
were
both
children
of
humanity
and
*NL*
were
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
glance
,
when
Davout
had
only
raised
his
head
from
the
*NL*
papers
where
human
affairs
and
lives
were
indicated
by
numbers
,
Pierre
*NL*
was
merely
a
circumstance
,
and
Davout
could
have
shot
him
without
*NL*
burdening
his
conscience
with
an
evil
deed
,
but
now
he
saw
in
him
a
*NL*
human
being
.
He
reflected
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
show
me
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
?
''
said
Davout
*NL*
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
remembered
Ramballe
,
and
named
him
and
his
regiment
and
the
*NL*
street
where
the
house
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
what
you
say
,
''
returned
Davout
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
trembling
,
faltering
voice
Pierre
began
adducing
proofs
of
the
*NL*
truth
of
his
statements
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
an
adjutant
entered
and
reported
something
to
Davout
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
brightened
up
at
the
news
the
adjutant
brought
,
and
began
*NL*
buttoning
up
his
uniform
.
It
seemed
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
adjutant
reminded
him
of
the
prisoner
,
he
jerked
his
head
in
*NL*
Pierre
's
direction
with
a
frown
and
ordered
him
to
be
led
away
.
But
*NL*
where
they
were
to
take
him
Pierre
did
not
know
:
back
to
the
coach
house
*NL*
or
to
the
place
of
execution
his
companions
had
pointed
out
to
him
as
*NL*
they
crossed
the
Virgin
's
Field
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
head
and
saw
that
the
adjutant
was
putting
another
*NL*
question
to
Davout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
!
''
replied
Davout
,
but
what
this
``
yes
''
meant
,
Pierre
did
*NL*
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
how
he
went
,
whether
it
was
far
,
or
*NL*
in
which
direction
.
His
faculties
were
quite
numbed
,
he
was
stupefied
,
*NL*
and
noticing
nothing
around
him
went
on
moving
his
legs
as
the
others
*NL*
did
till
they
all
stopped
and
he
stopped
too
.
The
only
thought
in
his
*NL*
mind
at
that
time
was
:
who
was
it
that
had
really
sentenced
him
to
*NL*
death
?
Not
the
men
on
the
commission
that
had
first
examined
him
--
not
*NL*
one
of
them
wished
to
or
,
evidently
,
could
have
done
it
.
It
was
not
*NL*
Davout
,
who
had
looked
at
him
in
so
human
a
way
.
In
another
moment
*NL*
Davout
would
have
realized
that
he
was
doing
wrong
,
but
just
then
the
*NL*
adjutant
had
come
in
and
interrupted
him
.
The
adjutant
,
also
,
had
*NL*
evidently
had
no
evil
intent
though
he
might
have
refrained
from
coming
*NL*
in
.
Then
who
was
executing
him
,
killing
him
,
depriving
him
of
life
--
him
,
*NL*
Pierre
,
with
all
his
memories
,
aspirations
,
hopes
,
and
thoughts
?
Who
was
*NL*
doing
this
?
And
Pierre
felt
that
it
was
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
system
--
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
system
of
some
sort
was
killing
him
--
Pierre
--
depriving
him
of
life
,
of
*NL*
everything
,
annihilating
him
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
From
Prince
Shcherbatov
's
house
the
prisoners
were
led
straight
down
the
*NL*
Virgin
's
Field
,
to
the
left
of
the
nunnery
,
as
far
as
a
kitchen
garden
*NL*
in
which
a
post
had
been
set
up
.
Beyond
that
post
a
fresh
pit
had
been
*NL*
dug
in
the
ground
,
and
near
the
post
and
the
pit
a
large
crowd
stood
in
*NL*
a
semicircle
.
The
crowd
consisted
of
a
few
Russians
and
many
of
*NL*
Napoleon
's
soldiers
who
were
not
on
duty
--
Germans
,
Italians
,
and
*NL*
Frenchmen
,
in
a
variety
of
uniforms
.
To
the
right
and
left
of
the
post
*NL*
stood
rows
of
French
troops
in
blue
uniforms
with
red
epaulets
and
high
*NL*
boots
and
shakos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoners
were
placed
in
a
certain
order
,
according
to
the
list
*NL*
-LRB-
Pierre
was
sixth
-RRB-
,
and
were
led
to
the
post
.
Several
drums
suddenly
*NL*
began
to
beat
on
both
sides
of
them
,
and
at
that
sound
Pierre
felt
as
if
*NL*
part
of
his
soul
had
been
torn
away
.
He
lost
the
power
of
thinking
or
*NL*
understanding
.
He
could
only
hear
and
see
.
And
he
had
only
one
wish
--
*NL*
that
the
frightful
thing
that
had
to
happen
should
happen
quickly
.
*NL*
Pierre
looked
round
at
his
fellow
prisoners
and
scrutinized
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
first
were
convicts
with
shaven
heads
.
One
was
tall
and
thin
,
*NL*
the
other
dark
,
shaggy
,
and
sinewy
,
with
a
flat
nose
.
The
third
was
a
*NL*
domestic
serf
,
about
forty-five
years
old
,
with
grizzled
hair
and
a
*NL*
plump
,
well-nourished
body
.
The
fourth
was
a
peasant
,
a
very
handsome
*NL*
man
with
a
broad
,
light-brown
beard
and
black
eyes
.
The
fifth
was
a
*NL*
factory
hand
,
a
thin
,
sallow-faced
lad
of
eighteen
in
a
loose
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
heard
the
French
consulting
whether
to
shoot
them
separately
or
*NL*
two
at
a
time
.
``
In
couples
,
''
replied
the
officer
in
command
in
a
calm
*NL*
voice
.
There
was
a
stir
in
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
and
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
they
were
all
hurrying
--
not
as
men
hurry
to
do
something
they
*NL*
understand
,
but
as
people
hurry
to
finish
a
necessary
but
unpleasant
and
*NL*
incomprehensible
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
French
official
wearing
a
scarf
came
up
to
the
right
of
the
row
of
*NL*
prisoners
and
read
out
the
sentence
in
Russian
and
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
two
pairs
of
Frenchmen
approached
the
criminals
and
at
the
*NL*
officer
's
command
took
the
two
convicts
who
stood
first
in
the
row
.
The
*NL*
convicts
stopped
when
they
reached
the
post
and
,
while
sacks
were
being
*NL*
brought
,
looked
dumbly
around
as
a
wounded
beast
looks
at
an
approaching
*NL*
huntsman
.
One
crossed
himself
continually
,
the
other
scratched
his
back
*NL*
and
made
a
movement
of
the
lips
resembling
a
smile
.
With
hurried
hands
*NL*
the
soldiers
blindfolded
them
,
drawing
the
sacks
over
their
heads
,
and
*NL*
bound
them
to
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twelve
sharpshooters
with
muskets
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
with
a
firm
*NL*
regular
tread
and
halted
eight
paces
from
the
post
.
Pierre
turned
away
*NL*
to
avoid
seeing
what
was
going
to
happen
.
Suddenly
a
crackling
,
rolling
*NL*
noise
was
heard
which
seemed
to
him
louder
than
the
most
terrific
*NL*
thunder
,
and
he
looked
round
.
There
was
some
smoke
,
and
the
Frenchmen
*NL*
were
doing
something
near
the
pit
,
with
pale
faces
and
trembling
hands
.
*NL*
Two
more
prisoners
were
led
up
.
In
the
same
way
and
with
similar
looks
,
*NL*
these
two
glanced
vainly
at
the
onlookers
with
only
a
silent
appeal
for
*NL*
protection
in
their
eyes
,
evidently
unable
to
understand
or
believe
what
*NL*
was
going
to
happen
to
them
.
They
could
not
believe
it
because
they
*NL*
alone
knew
what
their
life
meant
to
them
,
and
so
they
neither
understood
*NL*
nor
believed
that
it
could
be
taken
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Pierre
did
not
wish
to
look
and
again
turned
away
;
but
again
the
*NL*
sound
as
of
a
frightful
explosion
struck
his
ear
,
and
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
he
saw
smoke
,
blood
,
and
the
pale
,
scared
faces
of
the
Frenchmen
who
*NL*
were
again
doing
something
by
the
post
,
their
trembling
hands
impeding
*NL*
one
another
.
Pierre
,
breathing
heavily
,
looked
around
as
if
asking
what
*NL*
it
meant
.
The
same
question
was
expressed
in
all
the
looks
that
met
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
faces
of
all
the
Russians
and
of
the
French
soldiers
and
officers
*NL*
without
exception
,
he
read
the
same
dismay
,
horror
,
and
conflict
that
*NL*
were
in
his
own
heart
.
``
But
who
,
after
all
,
is
doing
this
?
They
are
all
*NL*
suffering
as
I
am
.
Who
then
is
it
?
Who
?
''
flashed
for
an
instant
through
*NL*
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sharpshooters
of
the
86th
,
forward
!
''
shouted
someone
.
The
fifth
*NL*
prisoner
,
the
one
next
to
Pierre
,
was
led
away
--
alone
.
Pierre
did
not
*NL*
understand
that
he
was
saved
,
that
he
and
the
rest
had
been
brought
*NL*
there
only
to
witness
the
execution
.
With
ever-growing
horror
,
and
no
*NL*
sense
of
joy
or
relief
,
he
gazed
at
what
was
taking
place
.
The
fifth
man
*NL*
was
the
factory
lad
in
the
loose
cloak
.
The
moment
they
laid
hands
on
*NL*
him
he
sprang
aside
in
terror
and
clutched
at
Pierre
.
-LRB-
Pierre
shuddered
*NL*
and
shook
himself
free
.
-RRB-
The
lad
was
unable
to
walk
.
They
dragged
him
*NL*
along
,
holding
him
up
under
the
arms
,
and
he
screamed
.
When
they
got
him
*NL*
to
the
post
he
grew
quiet
,
as
if
he
suddenly
understood
something
.
*NL*
Whether
he
understood
that
screaming
was
useless
or
whether
he
thought
*NL*
it
incredible
that
men
should
kill
him
,
at
any
rate
he
took
his
stand
at
*NL*
the
post
,
waiting
to
be
blindfolded
like
the
others
,
and
like
a
wounded
*NL*
animal
looked
around
him
with
glittering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
no
longer
able
to
turn
away
and
close
his
eyes
.
His
curiosity
*NL*
and
agitation
,
like
that
of
the
whole
crowd
,
reached
the
highest
pitch
*NL*
at
this
fifth
murder
.
Like
the
others
this
fifth
man
seemed
calm
;
he
*NL*
wrapped
his
loose
cloak
closer
and
rubbed
one
bare
foot
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
began
to
blindfold
him
he
himself
adjusted
the
knot
which
hurt
*NL*
the
back
of
his
head
;
then
when
they
propped
him
against
the
*NL*
bloodstained
post
,
he
leaned
back
and
,
not
being
comfortable
in
that
*NL*
position
,
straightened
himself
,
adjusted
his
feet
,
and
leaned
back
again
*NL*
more
comfortably
.
Pierre
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
him
and
did
not
miss
*NL*
his
slightest
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
a
word
of
command
was
given
and
was
followed
by
the
reports
of
*NL*
eight
muskets
;
but
try
as
he
would
Pierre
could
not
afterwards
remember
*NL*
having
heard
the
slightest
sound
of
the
shots
.
He
only
saw
how
the
*NL*
workman
suddenly
sank
down
on
the
cords
that
held
him
,
how
blood
showed
*NL*
itself
in
two
places
,
how
the
ropes
slackened
under
the
weight
of
the
*NL*
hanging
body
,
and
how
the
workman
sat
down
,
his
head
hanging
unnaturally
*NL*
and
one
leg
bent
under
him
.
Pierre
ran
up
to
the
post
.
No
one
hindered
*NL*
him
.
Pale
,
frightened
people
were
doing
something
around
the
workman
.
*NL*
The
lower
jaw
of
an
old
Frenchman
with
a
thick
mustache
trembled
as
he
*NL*
untied
the
ropes
.
The
body
collapsed
.
The
soldiers
dragged
it
awkwardly
*NL*
from
the
post
and
began
pushing
it
into
the
pit
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
plainly
and
certainly
knew
that
they
were
criminals
who
must
*NL*
hide
the
traces
of
their
guilt
as
quickly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
glanced
into
the
pit
and
saw
that
the
factory
lad
was
lying
with
*NL*
his
knees
close
up
to
his
head
and
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
.
*NL*
That
shoulder
rose
and
fell
rhythmically
and
convulsively
,
but
spadefuls
*NL*
of
earth
were
already
being
thrown
over
the
whole
body
.
One
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
evidently
suffering
,
shouted
gruffly
and
angrily
at
Pierre
to
*NL*
go
back
.
But
Pierre
did
not
understand
him
and
remained
near
the
post
,
*NL*
and
no
one
drove
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
pit
had
been
filled
up
a
command
was
given
.
Pierre
was
taken
*NL*
back
to
his
place
,
and
the
rows
of
troops
on
both
sides
of
the
post
made
*NL*
a
half
turn
and
went
past
it
at
a
measured
pace
.
The
twenty-four
*NL*
sharpshooters
with
discharged
muskets
,
standing
in
the
center
of
the
*NL*
circle
,
ran
back
to
their
places
as
the
companies
passed
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gazed
now
with
dazed
eyes
at
these
sharpshooters
who
ran
in
*NL*
couples
out
of
the
circle
.
All
but
one
rejoined
their
companies
.
This
*NL*
one
,
a
young
soldier
,
his
face
deadly
pale
,
his
shako
pushed
back
,
and
*NL*
his
musket
resting
on
the
ground
,
still
stood
near
the
pit
at
the
spot
*NL*
from
which
he
had
fired
.
He
swayed
like
a
drunken
man
,
taking
some
steps
*NL*
forward
and
back
to
save
himself
from
falling
.
An
old
,
noncommissioned
*NL*
officer
ran
out
of
the
ranks
and
taking
him
by
the
elbow
dragged
him
to
*NL*
his
company
.
The
crowd
of
Russians
and
Frenchmen
began
to
disperse
.
They
*NL*
all
went
away
silently
and
with
drooping
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
teach
them
to
start
fires
,
''
said
one
of
the
Frenchmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
glanced
round
at
the
speaker
and
saw
that
it
was
a
soldier
who
*NL*
was
trying
to
find
some
relief
after
what
had
been
done
,
but
was
not
*NL*
able
to
do
so
.
Without
finishing
what
he
had
begun
to
say
he
made
a
*NL*
hopeless
movement
with
his
arm
and
went
away
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
execution
Pierre
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
*NL*
and
placed
alone
in
a
small
,
ruined
,
and
befouled
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
evening
a
noncommissioned
officer
entered
with
two
soldiers
and
*NL*
told
him
that
he
had
been
pardoned
and
would
now
go
to
the
barracks
for
*NL*
the
prisoners
of
war
.
Without
understanding
what
was
said
to
him
,
Pierre
*NL*
got
up
and
went
with
the
soldiers
.
They
took
him
to
the
upper
end
of
the
*NL*
field
,
where
there
were
some
sheds
built
of
charred
planks
,
beams
,
and
*NL*
battens
,
and
led
him
into
one
of
them
.
In
the
darkness
some
twenty
*NL*
different
men
surrounded
Pierre
.
He
looked
at
them
without
understanding
*NL*
who
they
were
,
why
they
were
there
,
or
what
they
wanted
of
him
.
He
heard
*NL*
what
they
said
,
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
made
*NL*
no
kind
of
deduction
from
or
application
of
them
.
He
replied
to
*NL*
questions
they
put
to
him
,
but
did
not
consider
who
was
listening
to
his
*NL*
replies
,
nor
how
they
would
understand
them
.
He
looked
at
their
faces
*NL*
and
figures
,
but
they
all
seemed
to
him
equally
meaningless
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
Pierre
had
witnessed
those
terrible
murders
committed
by
*NL*
men
who
did
not
wish
to
commit
them
,
it
was
as
if
the
mainspring
of
his
*NL*
life
,
on
which
everything
depended
and
which
made
everything
appear
*NL*
alive
,
had
suddenly
been
wrenched
out
and
everything
had
collapsed
into
*NL*
a
heap
of
meaningless
rubbish
.
Though
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
*NL*
himself
,
his
faith
in
the
right
ordering
of
the
universe
,
in
humanity
,
*NL*
in
his
own
soul
,
and
in
God
,
had
been
destroyed
.
He
had
experienced
this
*NL*
before
,
but
never
so
strongly
as
now
.
When
similar
doubts
had
assailed
*NL*
him
before
,
they
had
been
the
result
of
his
own
wrongdoing
,
and
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
felt
that
relief
from
his
despair
and
from
*NL*
those
doubts
was
to
be
found
within
himself
.
But
now
he
felt
that
the
*NL*
universe
had
crumbled
before
his
eyes
and
only
meaningless
ruins
*NL*
remained
,
and
this
not
by
any
fault
of
his
own
.
He
felt
that
it
was
not
*NL*
in
his
power
to
regain
faith
in
the
meaning
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
him
in
the
darkness
men
were
standing
and
evidently
something
*NL*
about
him
interested
them
greatly
.
They
were
telling
him
something
and
*NL*
asking
him
something
.
Then
they
led
him
away
somewhere
,
and
at
last
he
*NL*
found
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
shed
among
men
who
were
laughing
and
*NL*
talking
on
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
mates
...
that
very
prince
who
...
''
some
voice
at
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
shed
was
saying
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
who
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
silent
and
motionless
on
a
heap
of
straw
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
Pierre
sometimes
opened
and
sometimes
closed
his
eyes
.
But
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
closed
them
he
saw
before
him
the
dreadful
face
of
the
factory
lad
--
*NL*
especially
dreadful
because
of
its
simplicity
--
and
the
faces
of
the
*NL*
murderers
,
even
more
dreadful
because
of
their
disquiet
.
And
he
opened
*NL*
his
eyes
again
and
stared
vacantly
into
the
darkness
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
him
in
a
stooping
position
sat
a
small
man
of
whose
presence
he
*NL*
was
first
made
aware
by
a
strong
smell
of
perspiration
which
came
from
*NL*
him
every
time
he
moved
.
This
man
was
doing
something
to
his
legs
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
though
Pierre
could
not
see
his
face
he
felt
that
the
man
*NL*
continually
glanced
at
him
.
On
growing
used
to
the
darkness
Pierre
saw
*NL*
that
the
man
was
taking
off
his
leg
bands
,
and
the
way
he
did
it
aroused
*NL*
Pierre
's
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
unwound
the
string
that
tied
the
band
on
one
leg
,
he
carefully
*NL*
coiled
it
up
and
immediately
set
to
work
on
the
other
leg
,
glancing
up
*NL*
at
Pierre
.
While
one
hand
hung
up
the
first
string
the
other
was
already
*NL*
unwinding
the
band
on
the
second
leg
.
In
this
way
,
having
carefully
*NL*
removed
the
leg
bands
by
deft
circular
motions
of
his
arm
following
one
*NL*
another
uninterruptedly
,
the
man
hung
the
leg
bands
up
on
some
pegs
*NL*
fixed
above
his
head
.
Then
he
took
out
a
knife
,
cut
something
,
closed
*NL*
the
knife
,
placed
it
under
the
head
of
his
bed
,
and
,
seating
himself
*NL*
comfortably
,
clasped
his
arms
round
his
lifted
knees
and
fixed
his
eyes
*NL*
on
Pierre
.
The
latter
was
conscious
of
something
pleasant
,
comforting
,
*NL*
and
well-rounded
in
these
deft
movements
,
in
the
man
's
well-ordered
*NL*
arrangements
in
his
corner
,
and
even
in
his
very
smell
,
and
he
looked
at
*NL*
the
man
without
taking
his
eyes
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
seen
a
lot
of
trouble
,
sir
,
eh
?
''
the
little
man
suddenly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
so
much
kindliness
and
simplicity
in
his
singsong
voice
*NL*
that
Pierre
tried
to
reply
,
but
his
jaw
trembled
and
he
felt
tears
*NL*
rising
to
his
eyes
.
The
little
fellow
,
giving
Pierre
no
time
to
betray
*NL*
his
confusion
,
instantly
continued
in
the
same
pleasant
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
lad
,
do
n't
fret
!
''
said
he
,
in
the
tender
singsong
caressing
voice
*NL*
old
Russian
peasant
women
employ
.
``
Do
n't
fret
,
friend
--
`
suffer
an
hour
,
*NL*
live
for
an
age
!
'
that
's
how
it
is
,
my
dear
fellow
.
And
here
we
live
,
*NL*
thank
heaven
,
without
offense
.
Among
these
folk
,
too
,
there
are
good
men
*NL*
as
well
as
bad
,
''
said
he
,
and
still
speaking
,
he
turned
on
his
knees
*NL*
with
a
supple
movement
,
got
up
,
coughed
,
and
went
off
to
another
part
of
*NL*
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
you
rascal
!
''
Pierre
heard
the
same
kind
voice
saying
at
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
shed
.
``
So
you
've
come
,
you
rascal
?
She
remembers
...
Now
,
now
,
*NL*
that
'll
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
soldier
,
pushing
away
a
little
dog
that
was
jumping
up
at
him
,
*NL*
returned
to
his
place
and
sat
down
.
In
his
hands
he
had
something
*NL*
wrapped
in
a
rag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
eat
a
bit
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
resuming
his
former
respectful
tone
as
*NL*
he
unwrapped
and
offered
Pierre
some
baked
potatoes
.
``
We
had
soup
for
*NL*
dinner
and
the
potatoes
are
grand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
not
eaten
all
day
and
the
smell
of
the
potatoes
seemed
*NL*
extremely
pleasant
to
him
.
He
thanked
the
soldier
and
began
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
they
all
right
?
''
said
the
soldier
with
a
smile
.
``
You
should
*NL*
do
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
potato
,
drew
out
his
clasp
knife
,
cut
the
potato
into
two
*NL*
equal
halves
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
sprinkled
some
salt
on
it
from
the
*NL*
rag
,
and
handed
it
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
potatoes
are
grand
!
''
he
said
once
more
.
``
Eat
some
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
thought
he
had
never
eaten
anything
that
tasted
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
all
right
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
why
did
they
shoot
those
poor
*NL*
fellows
?
The
last
one
was
hardly
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tss
,
tt
...
!
''
said
the
little
man
.
``
Ah
,
what
a
sin
...
what
a
sin
!
''
he
*NL*
added
quickly
,
and
as
if
his
words
were
always
waiting
ready
in
his
*NL*
mouth
and
flew
out
involuntarily
he
went
on
:
``
How
was
it
,
sir
,
that
you
*NL*
stayed
in
Moscow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
they
would
come
so
soon
.
I
stayed
accidentally
,
''
replied
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
they
arrest
you
,
dear
lad
?
At
your
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
went
to
look
at
the
fire
,
and
they
arrested
me
there
,
and
tried
*NL*
me
as
an
incendiary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
there
's
law
there
's
injustice
,
''
put
in
the
little
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
been
here
long
?
''
Pierre
asked
as
he
munched
the
last
of
*NL*
the
potato
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
It
was
last
Sunday
they
took
me
,
out
of
a
hospital
in
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
you
a
soldier
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
are
soldiers
of
the
Apsheron
regiment
.
I
was
dying
of
fever
.
We
*NL*
were
n't
told
anything
.
There
were
some
twenty
of
us
lying
there
.
We
had
*NL*
no
idea
,
never
guessed
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
feel
sad
here
?
''
Pierre
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
one
help
it
,
lad
?
My
name
is
Platon
,
and
the
surname
is
*NL*
Karataev
,
''
he
added
,
evidently
wishing
to
make
it
easier
for
Pierre
to
*NL*
address
him
.
``
They
call
me
`
little
falcon
'
in
the
regiment
.
How
is
one
*NL*
to
help
feeling
sad
?
Moscow
--
she
's
the
mother
of
cities
.
How
can
one
see
*NL*
all
this
and
not
feel
sad
?
But
`
the
maggot
gnaws
the
cabbage
,
yet
dies
*NL*
first
'
;
that
's
what
the
old
folks
used
to
tell
us
,
''
he
added
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
did
you
say
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
I
?
''
said
Karataev
.
``
I
say
things
happen
not
as
we
plan
but
as
God
*NL*
judges
,
''
he
replied
,
thinking
that
he
was
repeating
what
he
had
said
*NL*
before
,
and
immediately
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
you
,
have
you
a
family
estate
,
sir
?
And
a
house
?
So
you
have
*NL*
abundance
,
then
?
And
a
housewife
?
And
your
old
parents
,
are
they
still
*NL*
living
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
it
was
too
dark
for
Pierre
to
see
,
he
felt
that
a
suppressed
*NL*
smile
of
kindliness
puckered
the
soldier
's
lips
as
he
put
these
*NL*
questions
.
He
seemed
grieved
that
Pierre
had
no
parents
,
especially
that
*NL*
he
had
no
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wife
for
counsel
,
a
mother-in-law
for
welcome
,
but
there
's
none
as
*NL*
dear
as
one
's
own
mother
!
''
said
he
.
``
Well
,
and
have
you
little
ones
?
''
he
*NL*
went
on
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Pierre
's
negative
answer
seemed
to
distress
him
,
and
he
hastened
*NL*
to
add
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
!
You
're
young
folks
yet
,
and
please
God
may
still
have
some
.
*NL*
The
great
thing
is
to
live
in
harmony
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
all
the
same
now
,
''
Pierre
could
not
help
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
fellow
!
''
rejoined
Karataev
,
``
never
decline
a
prison
or
a
*NL*
beggar
's
sack
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seated
himself
more
comfortably
and
coughed
,
evidently
preparing
to
*NL*
tell
a
long
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
was
still
living
at
home
,
''
he
began
.
``
We
had
a
*NL*
well-to-do
homestead
,
plenty
of
land
,
we
peasants
lived
well
and
our
*NL*
house
was
one
to
thank
God
for
.
When
Father
and
we
went
out
mowing
there
*NL*
were
seven
of
us
.
We
lived
well
.
We
were
real
peasants
.
It
so
*NL*
happened
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Platon
Karataev
told
a
long
story
of
how
he
had
gone
into
someone
's
*NL*
copse
to
take
wood
,
how
he
had
been
caught
by
the
keeper
,
had
been
*NL*
tried
,
flogged
,
and
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
lad
,
''
and
a
smile
changed
the
tone
of
his
voice
``
we
thought
it
*NL*
was
a
misfortune
but
it
turned
out
a
blessing
!
If
it
had
not
been
for
my
*NL*
sin
,
my
brother
would
have
had
to
go
as
a
soldier
.
But
he
,
my
younger
*NL*
brother
,
had
five
little
ones
,
while
I
,
you
see
,
only
left
a
wife
*NL*
behind
.
We
had
a
little
girl
,
but
God
took
her
before
I
went
as
a
*NL*
soldier
.
I
come
home
on
leave
and
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
was
,
I
look
and
*NL*
see
that
they
are
living
better
than
before
.
The
yard
full
of
cattle
,
*NL*
the
women
at
home
,
two
brothers
away
earning
wages
,
and
only
Michael
the
*NL*
youngest
,
at
home
.
Father
,
he
says
,
`
All
my
children
are
the
same
to
me
:
*NL*
it
hurts
the
same
whichever
finger
gets
bitten
.
But
if
Platon
had
n't
*NL*
been
shaved
for
a
soldier
,
Michael
would
have
had
to
go
.
'
called
us
all
*NL*
to
him
and
,
will
you
believe
it
,
placed
us
in
front
of
the
icons
.
*NL*
`
Michael
,
'
he
says
,
`
come
here
and
bow
down
to
his
feet
;
and
you
,
young
*NL*
woman
,
you
bow
down
too
;
and
you
,
grandchildren
,
also
bow
down
before
*NL*
him
!
Do
you
understand
?
'
he
says
.
That
's
how
it
is
,
dear
fellow
.
Fate
*NL*
looks
for
a
head
.
But
we
are
always
judging
,
`
that
's
not
well
--
that
's
*NL*
not
right
!
'
Our
luck
is
like
water
in
a
dragnet
:
you
pull
at
it
and
it
*NL*
bulges
,
but
when
you
've
drawn
it
out
it
's
empty
!
That
's
how
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Platon
shifted
his
seat
on
the
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
silence
he
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
you
must
be
sleepy
,
''
said
he
,
and
began
rapidly
crossing
*NL*
himself
and
repeating
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
holy
Saint
Nicholas
,
Frola
and
Lavra
!
Lord
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
,
holy
Saint
Nicholas
,
Frola
and
Lavra
!
Lord
Jesus
Christ
,
have
*NL*
mercy
on
us
and
save
us
!
''
he
concluded
,
then
bowed
to
the
ground
,
got
*NL*
up
,
sighed
,
and
sat
down
again
on
his
heap
of
straw
.
``
That
's
the
way
.
*NL*
Lay
me
down
like
a
stone
,
O
God
,
and
raise
me
up
like
a
loaf
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
as
he
lay
down
,
pulling
his
coat
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
prayer
was
that
you
were
saying
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
murmured
Platon
,
who
had
almost
fallen
asleep
.
``
What
was
I
saying
?
*NL*
I
was
praying
.
Do
n't
you
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
But
what
was
that
you
said
:
Frola
and
Lavra
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
,
''
replied
Platon
quickly
,
``
the
horses
'
saints
.
One
must
*NL*
pity
the
animals
too
.
Eh
,
the
rascal
!
Now
you
've
curled
up
and
got
warm
,
*NL*
you
daughter
of
a
bitch
!
''
said
Karataev
,
touching
the
dog
that
lay
at
*NL*
his
feet
,
and
again
turning
over
he
fell
asleep
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sounds
of
crying
and
screaming
came
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
*NL*
outside
,
and
flames
were
visible
through
the
cracks
of
the
shed
,
but
*NL*
inside
it
was
quiet
and
dark
.
For
a
long
time
Pierre
did
not
sleep
,
but
*NL*
lay
with
eyes
open
in
the
darkness
,
listening
to
the
regular
snoring
of
*NL*
Platon
who
lay
beside
him
,
and
he
felt
that
the
world
that
had
been
*NL*
shattered
was
once
more
stirring
in
his
soul
with
a
new
beauty
and
on
*NL*
new
and
unshakable
foundations
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty-three
soldiers
,
three
officers
,
and
two
officials
were
confined
*NL*
in
the
shed
in
which
Pierre
had
been
placed
and
where
he
remained
for
*NL*
four
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
remembered
them
afterwards
they
all
seemed
misty
figures
to
*NL*
him
except
Platon
Karataev
,
who
always
remained
in
his
mind
a
most
vivid
*NL*
and
precious
memory
and
the
personification
of
everything
Russian
,
*NL*
kindly
,
and
round
.
When
Pierre
saw
his
neighbor
next
morning
at
dawn
the
*NL*
first
impression
of
him
,
as
of
something
round
,
was
fully
confirmed
:
*NL*
Platon
's
whole
figure
--
in
a
French
overcoat
girdled
with
a
cord
,
a
*NL*
soldier
's
cap
,
and
bast
shoes
--
was
round
.
His
head
was
quite
round
,
his
*NL*
back
,
chest
,
shoulders
,
and
even
his
arms
,
which
he
held
as
if
ever
*NL*
ready
to
embrace
something
,
were
rounded
,
his
pleasant
smile
and
his
*NL*
large
,
gentle
brown
eyes
were
also
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Platon
Karataev
must
have
been
fifty
,
judging
by
his
stories
of
*NL*
campaigns
he
had
been
in
,
told
as
by
an
old
soldier
.
He
did
not
himself
*NL*
know
his
age
and
was
quite
unable
to
determine
it
.
But
his
brilliantly
*NL*
white
,
strong
teeth
which
showed
in
two
unbroken
semicircles
when
he
*NL*
laughed
--
as
he
often
did
--
were
all
sound
and
good
,
there
was
not
a
gray
*NL*
hair
in
his
beard
or
on
his
head
,
and
his
whole
body
gave
an
impression
*NL*
of
suppleness
and
especially
of
firmness
and
endurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
,
despite
its
fine
,
rounded
wrinkles
,
had
an
expression
of
*NL*
innocence
and
youth
,
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
musical
.
But
the
chief
*NL*
peculiarity
of
his
speech
was
its
directness
and
appositeness
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
he
never
considered
what
he
had
said
or
was
going
to
say
,
*NL*
and
consequently
the
rapidity
and
justice
of
his
intonation
had
an
*NL*
irresistible
persuasiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
physical
strength
and
agility
during
the
first
days
of
his
*NL*
imprisonment
were
such
that
he
seemed
not
to
know
what
fatigue
and
*NL*
sickness
meant
.
Every
night
before
lying
down
,
he
said
:
``
Lord
,
lay
me
*NL*
down
as
a
stone
and
raise
me
up
as
a
loaf
!
''
and
every
morning
on
getting
*NL*
up
,
he
said
:
``
I
lay
down
and
curled
up
,
I
get
up
and
shake
myself
.
''
And
*NL*
indeed
he
only
had
to
lie
down
,
to
fall
asleep
like
a
stone
,
and
he
only
*NL*
had
to
shake
himself
,
to
be
ready
without
a
moment
's
delay
for
some
*NL*
work
,
just
as
children
are
ready
to
play
directly
they
awake
.
He
could
*NL*
do
everything
,
not
very
well
but
not
badly
.
He
baked
,
cooked
,
sewed
,
*NL*
planed
,
and
mended
boots
.
He
was
always
busy
,
and
only
at
night
allowed
*NL*
himself
conversation
--
of
which
he
was
fond
--
and
songs
.
He
did
not
sing
*NL*
like
a
trained
singer
who
knows
he
is
listened
to
,
but
like
the
birds
,
*NL*
evidently
giving
vent
to
the
sounds
in
the
same
way
that
one
stretches
*NL*
oneself
or
walks
about
to
get
rid
of
stiffness
,
and
the
sounds
were
*NL*
always
high-pitched
,
mournful
,
delicate
,
and
almost
feminine
,
and
his
*NL*
face
at
such
times
was
very
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
taken
prisoner
and
allowed
his
beard
to
grow
,
he
seemed
to
*NL*
have
thrown
off
all
that
had
been
forced
upon
him
--
everything
military
*NL*
and
alien
to
himself
--
and
had
returned
to
his
former
peasant
habits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
soldier
on
leave
--
a
shirt
outside
breeches
,
''
he
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
like
talking
about
his
life
as
a
soldier
,
though
he
did
not
*NL*
complain
,
and
often
mentioned
that
he
had
not
been
flogged
once
during
*NL*
the
whole
of
his
army
service
.
When
he
related
anything
it
was
generally
*NL*
some
old
and
evidently
precious
memory
of
his
``
Christian
''
life
,
as
he
*NL*
called
his
peasant
existence
.
The
proverbs
,
of
which
his
talk
was
full
,
*NL*
were
for
the
most
part
not
the
coarse
and
indecent
saws
soldiers
employ
,
*NL*
but
those
folk
sayings
which
taken
without
a
context
seem
so
*NL*
insignificant
,
but
when
used
appositely
suddenly
acquire
a
significance
*NL*
of
profound
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
often
say
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
had
said
on
a
previous
*NL*
occasion
,
yet
both
would
be
right
.
He
liked
to
talk
and
he
talked
well
,
*NL*
adorning
his
speech
with
terms
of
endearment
and
with
folk
sayings
which
*NL*
Pierre
thought
he
invented
himself
,
but
the
chief
charm
of
his
talk
lay
*NL*
in
the
fact
that
the
commonest
events
--
sometimes
just
such
as
Pierre
had
*NL*
witnessed
without
taking
notice
of
them
--
assumed
in
Karataev
's
a
*NL*
character
of
solemn
fitness
.
He
liked
to
hear
the
folk
tales
one
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
used
to
tell
of
an
evening
-LRB-
they
were
always
the
same
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
most
of
all
he
liked
to
hear
stories
of
real
life
.
He
would
smile
*NL*
joyfully
when
listening
to
such
stories
,
now
and
then
putting
in
a
word
*NL*
or
asking
a
question
to
make
the
moral
beauty
of
what
he
was
told
clear
*NL*
to
himself
.
Karataev
had
no
attachments
,
friendships
,
or
love
,
as
Pierre
*NL*
understood
them
,
but
loved
and
lived
affectionately
with
everything
life
*NL*
brought
him
in
contact
with
,
particularly
with
man
--
not
any
particular
*NL*
man
,
but
those
with
whom
he
happened
to
be
.
He
loved
his
dog
,
his
*NL*
comrades
,
the
French
,
and
Pierre
who
was
his
neighbor
,
but
Pierre
felt
*NL*
that
in
spite
of
Karataev
's
affectionate
tenderness
for
him
-LRB-
by
which
he
*NL*
unconsciously
gave
Pierre
's
spiritual
life
its
due
-RRB-
he
would
not
have
*NL*
grieved
for
a
moment
at
parting
from
him
.
And
Pierre
began
to
feel
in
*NL*
the
same
way
toward
Karataev
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
the
other
prisoners
Platon
Karataev
seemed
a
most
ordinary
*NL*
soldier
.
They
called
him
``
little
falcon
''
or
``
Platosha
,
''
chaffed
him
*NL*
good-naturedly
,
and
sent
him
on
errands
.
But
to
Pierre
he
always
*NL*
remained
what
he
had
seemed
that
first
night
:
an
unfathomable
,
rounded
,
*NL*
eternal
personification
of
the
spirit
of
simplicity
and
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Platon
Karataev
knew
nothing
by
heart
except
his
prayers
.
When
he
began
*NL*
to
speak
he
seemed
not
to
know
how
he
would
conclude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
Pierre
,
struck
by
the
meaning
of
his
words
,
would
ask
him
to
*NL*
repeat
them
,
but
Platon
could
never
recall
what
he
had
said
a
moment
*NL*
before
,
just
as
he
never
could
repeat
to
Pierre
the
words
of
his
*NL*
favorite
song
:
native
and
birch
tree
and
my
heart
is
sick
occurred
in
*NL*
it
,
but
when
spoken
and
not
sung
,
no
meaning
could
be
got
out
of
it
.
He
*NL*
did
not
,
and
could
not
,
understand
the
meaning
of
words
apart
from
their
*NL*
context
.
Every
word
and
action
of
his
was
the
manifestation
of
an
*NL*
activity
unknown
to
him
,
which
was
his
life
.
But
his
life
,
as
he
*NL*
regarded
it
,
had
no
meaning
as
a
separate
thing
.
It
had
meaning
only
as
*NL*
part
of
a
whole
of
which
he
was
always
conscious
.
His
words
and
actions
*NL*
flowed
from
him
as
evenly
,
inevitably
,
and
spontaneously
as
fragrance
*NL*
exhales
from
a
flower
.
He
could
not
understand
the
value
or
significance
*NL*
of
any
word
or
deed
taken
separately
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
heard
from
Nicholas
that
her
brother
was
with
the
*NL*
Rostovs
at
Yaroslavl
she
at
once
prepared
to
go
there
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
aunt
's
efforts
to
dissuade
her
--
and
not
merely
to
go
herself
but
to
take
*NL*
her
nephew
with
her
.
Whether
it
were
difficult
or
easy
,
possible
or
*NL*
impossible
,
she
did
not
ask
and
did
not
want
to
know
:
it
was
her
duty
,
*NL*
not
only
to
herself
,
to
be
near
her
brother
who
was
perhaps
dying
,
but
*NL*
to
do
everything
possible
to
take
his
son
to
him
,
and
so
she
prepared
to
*NL*
set
off
.
That
she
had
not
heard
from
Prince
Andrew
himself
,
Princess
*NL*
Mary
attributed
to
his
being
too
weak
to
write
or
to
his
considering
the
*NL*
long
journey
too
hard
and
too
dangerous
for
her
and
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
Princess
Mary
was
ready
to
start
.
Her
equipages
were
the
*NL*
huge
family
coach
in
which
she
had
traveled
to
Voronezh
,
a
semiopen
*NL*
trap
,
and
a
baggage
cart
.
With
her
traveled
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
*NL*
little
Nicholas
and
his
tutor
,
her
old
nurse
,
three
maids
,
Tikhon
,
and
a
*NL*
young
footman
and
courier
her
aunt
had
sent
to
accompany
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usual
route
through
Moscow
could
not
be
thought
of
,
and
the
*NL*
roundabout
way
Princess
Mary
was
obliged
to
take
through
Lipetsk
,
*NL*
Ryazan
,
Vladimir
,
and
Shuya
was
very
long
and
,
as
post
horses
were
not
*NL*
everywhere
obtainable
,
very
difficult
,
and
near
Ryazan
where
the
French
*NL*
were
said
to
have
shown
themselves
was
even
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
difficult
journey
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
Dessalles
,
and
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
servants
were
astonished
at
her
energy
and
firmness
of
*NL*
spirit
.
She
went
to
bed
later
and
rose
earlier
than
any
of
them
,
and
no
*NL*
difficulties
daunted
her
.
Thanks
to
her
activity
and
energy
,
which
*NL*
infected
her
fellow
travelers
,
they
approached
Yaroslavl
by
the
end
of
*NL*
the
second
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
days
of
her
stay
in
Voronezh
had
been
the
happiest
of
her
life
.
*NL*
Her
love
for
Rostov
no
longer
tormented
or
agitated
her
.
It
filled
her
*NL*
whole
soul
,
had
become
an
integral
part
of
herself
,
and
she
no
longer
*NL*
struggled
against
it
.
Latterly
she
had
become
convinced
that
she
loved
*NL*
and
was
beloved
,
though
she
never
said
this
definitely
to
herself
in
*NL*
words
.
She
had
become
convinced
of
it
at
her
last
interview
with
*NL*
Nicholas
,
when
he
had
come
to
tell
her
that
her
brother
was
with
the
*NL*
Rostovs
.
Not
by
a
single
word
had
Nicholas
alluded
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
relations
with
Natasha
might
,
if
he
recovered
,
be
*NL*
renewed
,
but
Princess
Mary
saw
by
his
face
that
he
knew
and
thought
of
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
in
spite
of
that
,
his
relation
to
her
--
considerate
,
delicate
,
and
*NL*
loving
--
not
only
remained
unchanged
,
but
it
sometimes
seemed
to
Princess
*NL*
Mary
that
he
was
even
glad
that
the
family
connection
between
them
*NL*
allowed
him
to
express
his
friendship
more
freely
.
She
knew
that
she
*NL*
loved
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
her
life
and
felt
that
she
was
*NL*
beloved
,
and
was
happy
in
regard
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
happiness
on
one
side
of
her
spiritual
nature
did
not
prevent
*NL*
her
feeling
grief
for
her
brother
with
full
force
;
on
the
contrary
,
that
*NL*
spiritual
tranquility
on
the
one
side
made
it
the
more
possible
for
her
*NL*
to
give
full
play
to
her
feeling
for
her
brother
.
That
feeling
was
so
*NL*
strong
at
the
moment
of
leaving
Voronezh
that
those
who
saw
her
off
,
as
*NL*
they
looked
at
her
careworn
,
despairing
face
,
felt
sure
she
would
fall
*NL*
ill
on
the
journey
.
But
the
very
difficulties
and
preoccupations
of
the
*NL*
journey
,
which
she
took
so
actively
in
hand
,
saved
her
for
a
while
from
*NL*
her
grief
and
gave
her
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
always
happens
when
traveling
,
Princess
Mary
thought
only
of
the
*NL*
journey
itself
,
forgetting
its
object
.
But
as
she
approached
Yaroslavl
*NL*
the
thought
of
what
might
await
her
there
--
not
after
many
days
,
but
that
*NL*
very
evening
--
again
presented
itself
to
her
and
her
agitation
increased
*NL*
to
its
utmost
limit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
courier
who
had
been
sent
on
in
advance
to
find
out
where
the
*NL*
Rostovs
were
staying
in
Yaroslavl
,
and
in
what
condition
Prince
Andrew
*NL*
was
,
when
he
met
the
big
coach
just
entering
the
town
gates
was
appalled
*NL*
by
the
terrible
pallor
of
the
princess
'
face
that
looked
out
at
him
from
*NL*
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
out
everything
,
your
excellency
:
the
Rostovs
are
staying
*NL*
at
the
merchant
Bronnikov
's
house
,
in
the
Square
not
far
from
here
,
*NL*
right
above
the
Volga
,
''
said
the
courier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
looked
at
him
with
frightened
inquiry
,
not
understanding
*NL*
why
he
did
not
reply
to
what
she
chiefly
wanted
to
know
:
how
was
her
*NL*
brother
?
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
put
that
question
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
prince
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
excellency
is
staying
in
the
same
house
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
is
alive
,
''
thought
Princess
Mary
,
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
:
*NL*
``
How
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
say
he
is
still
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
``
still
the
same
''
might
mean
Princess
Mary
did
not
ask
,
but
with
an
*NL*
unnoticed
glance
at
little
seven-year-old
Nicholas
,
who
was
sitting
in
*NL*
front
of
her
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
town
,
she
bowed
her
head
and
*NL*
did
not
raise
it
again
till
the
heavy
coach
,
rumbling
,
shaking
and
*NL*
swaying
,
came
to
a
stop
.
The
carriage
steps
clattered
as
they
were
let
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
door
was
opened
.
On
the
left
there
was
water
--
a
great
*NL*
river
--
and
on
the
right
a
porch
.
There
were
people
at
the
entrance
:
*NL*
servants
,
and
a
rosy
girl
with
a
large
plait
of
black
hair
,
smiling
as
*NL*
it
seemed
to
Princess
Mary
in
an
unpleasantly
affected
way
.
-LRB-
This
was
*NL*
Sonya
.
-RRB-
Princess
Mary
ran
up
the
steps
.
``
This
way
,
this
way
!
''
said
the
*NL*
girl
,
with
the
same
artificial
smile
,
and
the
princess
found
herself
in
*NL*
the
hall
facing
an
elderly
woman
of
Oriental
type
,
who
came
rapidly
to
*NL*
meet
her
with
a
look
of
emotion
.
This
was
the
countess
.
She
embraced
*NL*
Princess
Mary
and
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
enfant
!
''
she
muttered
,
``
je
vous
aime
et
vous
connais
depuis
*NL*
longtemps
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
My
child
!
I
love
you
and
have
known
you
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
her
excitement
,
Princess
Mary
realized
that
this
was
the
*NL*
countess
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
to
her
.
Hardly
*NL*
knowing
how
she
did
it
,
she
contrived
to
utter
a
few
polite
phrases
in
*NL*
French
in
the
same
tone
as
those
that
had
been
addressed
to
her
,
and
*NL*
asked
:
``
How
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
says
that
he
is
not
in
danger
,
''
said
the
countess
,
but
as
*NL*
she
spoke
she
raised
her
eyes
with
a
sigh
,
and
her
gesture
conveyed
a
*NL*
contradiction
of
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
Can
I
see
him
--
can
I
?
''
asked
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
Princess
,
one
moment
,
my
dear
!
Is
this
his
son
?
''
said
the
*NL*
countess
,
turning
to
little
Nicholas
who
was
coming
in
with
Dessalles
.
*NL*
``
There
will
be
room
for
everybody
,
this
is
a
big
house
.
Oh
,
what
a
*NL*
lovely
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
took
Princess
Mary
into
the
drawing
room
,
where
Sonya
was
*NL*
talking
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
.
The
countess
caressed
the
boy
,
and
*NL*
the
old
count
came
in
and
welcomed
the
princess
.
He
had
changed
very
*NL*
much
since
Princess
Mary
had
last
seen
him
.
Then
he
had
been
a
brisk
,
*NL*
cheerful
,
self-assured
old
man
;
now
he
seemed
a
pitiful
,
bewildered
*NL*
person
.
While
talking
to
Princess
Mary
he
continually
looked
round
as
if
*NL*
asking
everyone
whether
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
.
After
the
*NL*
destruction
of
Moscow
and
of
his
property
,
thrown
out
of
his
accustomed
*NL*
groove
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
sense
of
his
own
significance
and
to
*NL*
feel
that
there
was
no
longer
a
place
for
him
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
one
desire
to
see
her
brother
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
her
vexation
that
at
the
moment
when
all
she
wanted
was
to
see
him
they
*NL*
should
be
trying
to
entertain
her
and
pretending
to
admire
her
nephew
,
*NL*
the
princess
noticed
all
that
was
going
on
around
her
and
felt
the
*NL*
necessity
of
submitting
,
for
a
time
,
to
this
new
order
of
things
which
*NL*
she
had
entered
.
She
knew
it
to
be
necessary
,
and
though
it
was
hard
for
*NL*
her
she
was
not
vexed
with
these
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
niece
,
''
said
the
count
,
introducing
Sonya
--
``
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
her
,
Princess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
turned
to
Sonya
and
,
trying
to
stifle
the
hostile
feeling
*NL*
that
arose
in
her
toward
the
girl
,
she
kissed
her
.
But
she
felt
*NL*
oppressed
by
the
fact
that
the
mood
of
everyone
around
her
was
so
far
*NL*
from
what
was
in
her
own
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
she
asked
again
,
addressing
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
downstairs
.
Natasha
is
with
him
,
''
answered
Sonya
,
flushing
.
``
We
*NL*
have
sent
to
ask
.
I
think
you
must
be
tired
,
Princess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
of
vexation
showed
themselves
in
Princess
Mary
's
eyes
.
She
turned
*NL*
away
and
was
about
to
ask
the
countess
again
how
to
go
to
him
,
when
*NL*
light
,
impetuous
,
and
seemingly
buoyant
steps
were
heard
at
the
door
.
*NL*
The
princess
looked
round
and
saw
Natasha
coming
in
,
almost
running
--
*NL*
that
Natasha
whom
she
had
liked
so
little
at
their
meeting
in
Moscow
*NL*
long
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
hardly
had
the
princess
looked
at
Natasha
's
face
before
she
realized
*NL*
that
here
was
a
real
comrade
in
her
grief
,
and
consequently
a
friend
.
*NL*
She
ran
to
meet
her
,
embraced
her
,
and
began
to
cry
on
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Natasha
,
sitting
at
the
head
of
Prince
Andrew
's
bed
,
heard
of
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
arrival
,
she
softly
left
his
room
and
hastened
to
her
*NL*
with
those
swift
steps
that
had
sounded
buoyant
to
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
expression
on
her
agitated
face
when
she
ran
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
--
that
of
love
--
boundless
love
for
him
,
for
her
,
and
for
all
*NL*
that
was
near
to
the
man
she
loved
;
and
of
pity
,
suffering
for
others
,
*NL*
and
passionate
desire
to
give
herself
entirely
to
helping
them
.
It
was
*NL*
plain
that
at
that
moment
there
was
in
Natasha
's
heart
no
thought
of
*NL*
herself
or
of
her
own
relations
with
Prince
Andrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
with
her
acute
sensibility
,
understood
all
this
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
at
Natasha
's
face
,
and
wept
on
her
shoulder
with
sorrowful
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
to
him
,
Mary
,
''
said
Natasha
,
leading
her
into
the
other
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
raised
her
head
,
dried
her
eyes
,
and
turned
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
She
felt
that
from
her
she
would
be
able
to
understand
and
learn
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
...
''
she
began
her
question
but
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
ask
,
or
to
answer
,
in
words
.
*NL*
Natasha
's
face
and
eyes
would
have
to
tell
her
all
more
clearly
and
*NL*
profoundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
gazing
at
her
,
but
seemed
afraid
and
in
doubt
whether
to
say
*NL*
all
she
knew
or
not
;
she
seemed
to
feel
that
before
those
luminous
eyes
*NL*
which
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
,
it
was
impossible
*NL*
not
to
tell
the
whole
truth
which
she
saw
.
And
suddenly
,
Natasha
's
lips
*NL*
twitched
,
ugly
wrinkles
gathered
round
her
mouth
,
and
covering
her
face
*NL*
with
her
hands
she
burst
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
still
hoped
,
and
asked
,
in
words
she
herself
did
not
trust
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
his
wound
?
What
is
his
general
condition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
you
...
will
see
,
''
was
all
Natasha
could
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
a
little
while
downstairs
near
his
room
till
they
had
left
off
*NL*
crying
and
were
able
to
go
to
him
with
calm
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
has
his
whole
illness
gone
?
Is
it
long
since
he
grew
worse
?
When
*NL*
did
this
happen
?
''
Princess
Mary
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
told
her
that
at
first
there
had
been
danger
from
his
feverish
*NL*
condition
and
the
pain
he
suffered
,
but
at
Troitsa
that
had
passed
and
*NL*
the
doctor
had
only
been
afraid
of
gangrene
.
That
danger
had
also
*NL*
passed
.
When
they
reached
Yaroslavl
the
wound
had
begun
to
fester
*NL*
-LRB-
Natasha
knew
all
about
such
things
as
festering
-RRB-
and
the
doctor
had
*NL*
said
that
the
festering
might
take
a
normal
course
.
Then
fever
set
in
,
*NL*
but
the
doctor
had
said
the
fever
was
not
very
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
two
days
ago
this
suddenly
happened
,
''
said
Natasha
,
struggling
with
*NL*
her
sobs
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
you
will
see
what
he
is
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
weaker
?
Thinner
?
''
asked
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
that
,
but
worse
.
You
will
see
.
O
,
Mary
,
he
is
too
good
,
he
*NL*
can
not
,
can
not
live
,
because

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
When
Natasha
opened
Prince
Andrew
's
door
with
a
familiar
movement
and
*NL*
let
Princess
Mary
pass
into
the
room
before
her
,
the
princess
felt
the
*NL*
sobs
in
her
throat
.
Hard
as
she
had
tried
to
prepare
herself
,
and
now
*NL*
tried
to
remain
tranquil
,
she
knew
that
she
would
be
unable
to
look
at
*NL*
him
without
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
understood
what
Natasha
had
meant
by
the
words
:
``
two
days
*NL*
ago
this
suddenly
happened
.
''
She
understood
those
words
to
mean
that
he
*NL*
had
suddenly
softened
and
that
this
softening
and
gentleness
were
signs
*NL*
of
approaching
death
.
As
she
stepped
to
the
door
she
already
saw
in
*NL*
imagination
Andrew
's
face
as
she
remembered
it
in
childhood
,
a
gentle
,
*NL*
mild
,
sympathetic
face
which
he
had
rarely
shown
,
and
which
therefore
*NL*
affected
her
very
strongly
.
She
was
sure
he
would
speak
soft
,
tender
*NL*
words
to
her
such
as
her
father
had
uttered
before
his
death
,
and
that
*NL*
she
would
not
be
able
to
bear
it
and
would
burst
into
sobs
in
his
*NL*
presence
.
Yet
sooner
or
later
it
had
to
be
,
and
she
went
in
.
The
sobs
*NL*
rose
higher
and
higher
in
her
throat
as
she
more
and
more
clearly
*NL*
distinguished
his
form
and
her
shortsighted
eyes
tried
to
make
out
his
*NL*
features
,
and
then
she
saw
his
face
and
met
his
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lying
in
a
squirrel-fur
dressing
gown
on
a
divan
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
pillows
.
He
was
thin
and
pale
.
In
one
thin
,
translucently
white
hand
he
*NL*
held
a
handkerchief
,
while
with
the
other
he
stroked
the
delicate
*NL*
mustache
he
had
grown
,
moving
his
fingers
slowly
.
His
eyes
gazed
at
them
*NL*
as
they
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
his
face
and
meeting
his
eyes
Princess
Mary
's
pace
suddenly
*NL*
slackened
,
she
felt
her
tears
dry
up
and
her
sobs
ceased
.
She
suddenly
*NL*
felt
guilty
and
grew
timid
on
catching
the
expression
of
his
face
and
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
what
am
I
to
blame
?
''
she
asked
herself
.
And
his
cold
,
stern
look
*NL*
replied
:
``
Because
you
are
alive
and
thinking
of
the
living
,
while
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
deep
gaze
that
seemed
to
look
not
outwards
but
inwards
there
was
*NL*
an
almost
hostile
expression
as
he
slowly
regarded
his
sister
and
*NL*
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
his
sister
,
holding
her
hand
in
his
as
was
their
wont
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Mary
?
How
did
you
manage
to
get
here
?
''
said
he
in
a
voice
*NL*
as
calm
and
aloof
as
his
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
screamed
in
agony
,
that
scream
would
not
have
struck
such
horror
*NL*
into
Princess
Mary
's
heart
as
the
tone
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
brought
little
Nicholas
?
''
he
asked
in
the
same
slow
,
quiet
*NL*
manner
and
with
an
obvious
effort
to
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
now
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
herself
surprised
at
what
she
was
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
my
dear
,
you
must
ask
the
doctor
,
''
he
replied
,
and
again
making
*NL*
an
evident
effort
to
be
affectionate
,
he
said
with
his
lips
only
-LRB-
his
*NL*
words
clearly
did
not
correspond
to
his
thoughts
-RRB-
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merci
,
chere
amie
,
d'etre
venue
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Thank
you
for
coming
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
pressed
his
hand
.
The
pressure
made
him
wince
just
*NL*
perceptibly
.
He
was
silent
,
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
She
now
*NL*
understood
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
.
In
his
words
,
his
*NL*
tone
,
and
especially
in
that
calm
,
almost
antagonistic
look
could
be
*NL*
felt
an
estrangement
from
everything
belonging
to
this
world
,
terrible
*NL*
in
one
who
is
alive
.
Evidently
only
with
an
effort
did
he
understand
*NL*
anything
living
;
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
failed
to
understand
,
not
*NL*
because
he
lacked
the
power
to
do
so
but
because
he
understood
something
*NL*
else
--
something
the
living
did
not
and
could
not
understand
--
and
which
*NL*
wholly
occupied
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
how
strangely
fate
has
brought
us
together
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
breaking
the
silence
and
pointing
to
Natasha
.
``
She
looks
after
me
all
*NL*
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
heard
him
and
did
not
understand
how
he
could
say
such
a
*NL*
thing
.
He
,
the
sensitive
,
tender
Prince
Andrew
,
how
could
he
say
that
,
*NL*
before
her
whom
he
loved
and
who
loved
him
?
Had
he
expected
to
live
he
*NL*
could
not
have
said
those
words
in
that
offensively
cold
tone
.
If
he
had
*NL*
not
known
that
he
was
dying
,
how
could
he
have
failed
to
pity
her
and
*NL*
how
could
he
speak
like
that
in
her
presence
?
The
only
explanation
was
*NL*
that
he
was
indifferent
,
because
something
else
,
much
more
important
,
*NL*
had
been
revealed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
cold
and
disconnected
and
continually
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
came
by
way
of
Ryazan
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
did
not
notice
that
she
called
his
sister
Mary
,
and
only
*NL*
after
calling
her
so
in
his
presence
did
Natasha
notice
it
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
told
her
that
all
Moscow
has
been
burned
down
,
and
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
stopped
.
It
was
impossible
to
talk
.
It
was
plain
that
he
was
*NL*
making
an
effort
to
listen
,
but
could
not
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
say
it
's
burned
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
a
great
pity
,
''
and
he
gazed
*NL*
straight
before
him
,
absently
stroking
his
mustache
with
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
have
met
Count
Nicholas
,
Mary
?
''
Prince
Andrew
suddenly
said
,
*NL*
evidently
wishing
to
speak
pleasantly
to
them
.
``
He
wrote
here
that
he
*NL*
took
a
great
liking
to
you
,
''
he
went
on
simply
and
calmly
,
evidently
*NL*
unable
to
understand
all
the
complex
significance
his
words
had
for
*NL*
living
people
.
``
If
you
liked
him
too
,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
you
*NL*
to
get
married
,
''
he
added
rather
more
quickly
,
as
if
pleased
at
having
*NL*
found
words
he
had
long
been
seeking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
heard
his
words
but
they
had
no
meaning
for
her
,
except
as
*NL*
a
proof
of
how
far
away
he
now
was
from
everything
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
talk
of
me
?
''
she
said
quietly
and
glanced
at
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
felt
her
glance
,
did
not
look
at
her
.
All
three
were
again
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Andrew
,
would
you
like
...
''
Princess
Mary
suddenly
said
in
a
trembling
*NL*
voice
,
``
would
you
like
to
see
little
Nicholas
?
He
is
always
talking
*NL*
about
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
smiled
just
perceptibly
and
for
the
first
time
,
but
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
who
knew
his
face
so
well
,
saw
with
horror
that
he
did
*NL*
not
smile
with
pleasure
or
affection
for
his
son
,
but
with
quiet
,
gentle
*NL*
irony
because
he
thought
she
was
trying
what
she
believed
to
be
the
last
*NL*
means
of
arousing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
him
.
Is
he
quite
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
little
Nicholas
was
brought
into
Prince
Andrew
's
room
he
looked
at
*NL*
his
father
with
frightened
eyes
,
but
did
not
cry
,
because
no
one
else
*NL*
was
crying
.
Prince
Andrew
kissed
him
and
evidently
did
not
know
what
to
*NL*
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Nicholas
had
been
led
away
,
Princess
Mary
again
went
up
to
her
*NL*
brother
,
kissed
him
,
and
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
any
longer
began
*NL*
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
about
Nicholas
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
nodded
her
head
,
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
you
know
the
Gosp
...
''
but
he
broke
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
You
must
n't
cry
here
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
with
the
same
*NL*
cold
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
began
to
cry
,
he
understood
that
she
was
crying
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
little
Nicholas
would
be
left
without
a
father
.
With
a
*NL*
great
effort
he
tried
to
return
to
life
and
to
see
things
from
their
*NL*
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
them
it
must
seem
sad
!
''
he
thought
.
``
But
how
simple
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fowls
of
the
air
sow
not
,
neither
do
they
reap
,
yet
your
Father
*NL*
feedeth
them
,
''
he
said
to
himself
and
wished
to
say
to
Princess
Mary
;
*NL*
``
but
no
,
they
will
take
it
their
own
way
,
they
wo
n't
understand
!
They
*NL*
ca
n't
understand
that
all
those
feelings
they
prize
so
--
all
our
*NL*
feelings
,
all
those
ideas
that
seem
so
important
to
us
,
are
unnecessary
.
*NL*
We
can
not
understand
one
another
,
''
and
he
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
little
son
was
seven
.
He
could
scarcely
read
,
and
knew
*NL*
nothing
.
After
that
day
he
lived
through
many
things
,
gaining
knowledge
,
*NL*
observation
,
and
experience
,
but
had
he
possessed
all
the
faculties
he
*NL*
afterwards
acquired
,
he
could
not
have
had
a
better
or
more
profound
*NL*
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
between
his
*NL*
father
,
Mary
,
and
Natasha
,
than
he
had
then
.
He
understood
it
*NL*
completely
,
and
,
leaving
the
room
without
crying
,
went
silently
up
to
*NL*
Natasha
who
had
come
out
with
him
and
looked
shyly
at
her
with
his
*NL*
beautiful
,
thoughtful
eyes
,
then
his
uplifted
,
rosy
upper
lip
trembled
*NL*
and
leaning
his
head
against
her
he
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
he
avoided
Dessalles
and
the
countess
who
caressed
him
and
*NL*
either
sat
alone
or
came
timidly
to
Princess
Mary
,
or
to
Natasha
of
whom
*NL*
he
seemed
even
fonder
than
of
his
aunt
,
and
clung
to
them
quietly
and
*NL*
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
had
left
Prince
Andrew
she
fully
understood
what
*NL*
Natasha
's
face
had
told
her
.
She
did
not
speak
any
more
to
Natasha
of
*NL*
hopes
of
saving
his
life
.
She
took
turns
with
her
beside
his
sofa
,
and
*NL*
did
not
cry
any
more
,
but
prayed
continually
,
turning
in
soul
to
that
*NL*
Eternal
and
Unfathomable
,
whose
presence
above
the
dying
man
was
now
so
*NL*
evident
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
did
Prince
Andrew
know
he
would
die
,
but
he
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
dying
and
was
already
half
dead
.
He
was
conscious
of
an
aloofness
from
*NL*
everything
earthly
and
a
strange
and
joyous
lightness
of
existence
.
*NL*
Without
haste
or
agitation
he
awaited
what
was
coming
.
That
inexorable
,
*NL*
eternal
,
distant
,
and
unknown
the
presence
of
which
he
had
felt
*NL*
continually
all
his
life
--
was
now
near
to
him
and
,
by
the
strange
*NL*
lightness
he
experienced
,
almost
comprehensible
and
palpable
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Formerly
he
had
feared
the
end
.
He
had
twice
experienced
that
terribly
*NL*
tormenting
fear
of
death
--
the
end
--
but
now
he
no
longer
understood
that
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
felt
it
for
the
first
time
when
the
shell
spun
like
a
top
before
*NL*
him
,
and
he
looked
at
the
fallow
field
,
the
bushes
,
and
the
sky
,
and
*NL*
knew
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
death
.
When
he
came
to
himself
after
*NL*
being
wounded
and
the
flower
of
eternal
,
unfettered
love
had
instantly
*NL*
unfolded
itself
in
his
soul
as
if
freed
from
the
bondage
of
life
that
*NL*
had
restrained
it
,
he
no
longer
feared
death
and
ceased
to
think
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
hours
of
solitude
,
suffering
,
and
partial
delirium
he
spent
*NL*
after
he
was
wounded
,
the
more
deeply
he
penetrated
into
the
new
*NL*
principle
of
eternal
love
revealed
to
him
,
the
more
he
unconsciously
*NL*
detached
himself
from
earthly
life
.
To
love
everything
and
everybody
and
*NL*
always
to
sacrifice
oneself
for
love
meant
not
to
love
anyone
,
not
to
*NL*
live
this
earthly
life
.
And
the
more
imbued
he
became
with
that
*NL*
principle
of
love
,
the
more
he
renounced
life
and
the
more
completely
he
*NL*
destroyed
that
dreadful
barrier
which
--
in
the
absence
of
such
love
--
*NL*
stands
between
life
and
death
.
When
during
those
first
days
he
*NL*
remembered
that
he
would
have
to
die
,
he
said
to
himself
:
``
Well
,
what
of
*NL*
it
?
So
much
the
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
night
in
Mytishchi
when
,
half
delirious
,
he
had
seen
her
*NL*
for
whom
he
longed
appear
before
him
and
,
having
pressed
her
hand
to
his
*NL*
lips
,
had
shed
gentle
,
happy
tears
,
love
for
a
particular
woman
again
*NL*
crept
unobserved
into
his
heart
and
once
more
bound
him
to
life
.
And
*NL*
joyful
and
agitating
thoughts
began
to
occupy
his
mind
.
Recalling
the
*NL*
moment
at
the
ambulance
station
when
he
had
seen
Kuragin
,
he
could
not
*NL*
now
regain
the
feeling
he
then
had
,
but
was
tormented
by
the
question
*NL*
whether
Kuragin
was
alive
.
And
he
dared
not
inquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
illness
pursued
its
normal
physical
course
,
but
what
Natasha
*NL*
referred
to
when
she
said
:
``
This
suddenly
happened
,
''
had
occurred
two
*NL*
days
before
Princess
Mary
arrived
.
It
was
the
last
spiritual
struggle
*NL*
between
life
and
death
,
in
which
death
gained
the
victory
.
It
was
the
*NL*
unexpected
realization
of
the
fact
that
he
still
valued
life
as
*NL*
presented
to
him
in
the
form
of
his
love
for
Natasha
,
and
a
last
,
though
*NL*
ultimately
vanquished
,
attack
of
terror
before
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evening
.
As
usual
after
dinner
he
was
slightly
feverish
,
and
his
*NL*
thoughts
were
preternaturally
clear
.
Sonya
was
sitting
by
the
table
.
He
*NL*
began
to
doze
.
Suddenly
a
feeling
of
happiness
seized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
has
come
!
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
:
in
Sonya
's
place
sat
Natasha
who
had
just
come
in
*NL*
noiselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
she
had
begun
looking
after
him
,
he
had
always
experienced
this
*NL*
physical
consciousness
of
her
nearness
.
She
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
*NL*
placed
sideways
,
screening
the
light
of
the
candle
from
him
,
and
was
*NL*
knitting
a
stocking
.
She
had
learned
to
knit
stockings
since
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
had
casually
mentioned
that
no
one
nursed
the
sick
so
well
as
old
*NL*
nurses
who
knit
stockings
,
and
that
there
is
something
soothing
in
the
*NL*
knitting
of
stockings
.
The
needles
clicked
lightly
in
her
slender
,
*NL*
rapidly
moving
hands
,
and
he
could
clearly
see
the
thoughtful
profile
of
*NL*
her
drooping
face
.
She
moved
,
and
the
ball
rolled
off
her
knees
.
She
*NL*
started
,
glanced
round
at
him
,
and
screening
the
candle
with
her
hand
*NL*
stooped
carefully
with
a
supple
and
exact
movement
,
picked
up
the
ball
,
*NL*
and
regained
her
former
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
without
moving
and
saw
that
she
wanted
to
draw
a
deep
*NL*
breath
after
stooping
,
but
refrained
from
doing
so
and
breathed
*NL*
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Troitsa
monastery
they
had
spoken
of
the
past
,
and
he
had
told
*NL*
her
that
if
he
lived
he
would
always
thank
God
for
his
wound
which
had
*NL*
brought
them
together
again
,
but
after
that
they
never
spoke
of
the
*NL*
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
or
can
it
not
be
?
''
he
now
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
light
click
of
the
steel
needles
.
``
Can
fate
have
brought
*NL*
me
to
her
so
strangely
only
for
me
to
die
?
...
Is
it
possible
that
the
*NL*
truth
of
life
has
been
revealed
to
me
only
to
show
me
that
I
have
spent
*NL*
my
life
in
falsity
?
I
love
her
more
than
anything
in
the
world
!
But
what
*NL*
am
I
to
do
if
I
love
her
?
''
he
thought
,
and
he
involuntarily
groaned
,
*NL*
from
a
habit
acquired
during
his
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
that
sound
Natasha
put
down
the
stocking
,
leaned
nearer
to
*NL*
him
,
and
suddenly
,
noticing
his
shining
eyes
,
stepped
lightly
up
to
him
*NL*
and
bent
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
been
looking
at
you
a
long
time
.
I
felt
you
come
in
.
No
one
*NL*
else
gives
me
that
sense
of
soft
tranquillity
that
you
do
...
that
light
.
*NL*
I
want
to
weep
for
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
drew
closer
to
him
.
Her
face
shone
with
rapturous
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
I
love
you
too
much
!
More
than
anything
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
!
''
--
She
turned
away
for
an
instant
.
``
Why
too
much
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
too
much
?
...
Well
,
what
do
you
,
what
do
you
feel
in
your
soul
,
your
*NL*
whole
soul
--
shall
I
live
?
What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
it
,
sure
!
''
Natasha
almost
shouted
,
taking
hold
of
both
his
*NL*
hands
with
a
passionate
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
silent
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
it
would
be
!
''
and
taking
her
hand
he
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
felt
happy
and
agitated
,
but
at
once
remembered
that
this
would
*NL*
not
do
and
that
he
had
to
be
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
not
slept
,
''
she
said
,
repressing
her
joy
.
``
Try
to
sleep
...
*NL*
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
and
released
it
,
and
she
went
back
to
the
candle
and
*NL*
sat
down
again
in
her
former
position
.
Twice
she
turned
and
looked
at
*NL*
him
,
and
her
eyes
met
his
beaming
at
her
.
She
set
herself
a
task
on
her
*NL*
stocking
and
resolved
not
to
turn
round
till
it
was
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
he
really
shut
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
.
He
did
not
sleep
long
and
*NL*
suddenly
awoke
with
a
start
and
in
a
cold
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
fell
asleep
he
had
still
been
thinking
of
the
subject
that
now
*NL*
always
occupied
his
mind
--
about
life
and
death
,
and
chiefly
about
death
.
*NL*
He
felt
himself
nearer
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
?
What
is
love
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
hinders
death
.
Love
is
life
.
All
,
everything
that
I
understand
,
I
*NL*
understand
only
because
I
love
.
Everything
is
,
everything
exists
,
only
*NL*
because
I
love
.
Everything
is
united
by
it
alone
.
Love
is
God
,
and
to
*NL*
die
means
that
I
,
a
particle
of
love
,
shall
return
to
the
general
and
*NL*
eternal
source
.
''
These
thoughts
seemed
to
him
comforting
.
But
they
were
*NL*
only
thoughts
.
Something
was
lacking
in
them
,
they
were
not
clear
,
they
*NL*
were
too
one-sidedly
personal
and
brain-spun
.
And
there
was
the
former
*NL*
agitation
and
obscurity
.
He
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dreamed
that
he
was
lying
in
the
room
he
really
was
in
,
but
that
he
*NL*
was
quite
well
and
unwounded
.
Many
various
,
indifferent
,
and
*NL*
insignificant
people
appeared
before
him
.
He
talked
to
them
and
*NL*
discussed
something
trivial
.
They
were
preparing
to
go
away
somewhere
.
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
dimly
realized
that
all
this
was
trivial
and
that
he
had
*NL*
more
important
cares
,
but
he
continued
to
speak
,
surprising
them
by
*NL*
empty
witticisms
.
Gradually
,
unnoticed
,
all
these
persons
began
to
*NL*
disappear
and
a
single
question
,
that
of
the
closed
door
,
superseded
all
*NL*
else
.
He
rose
and
went
to
the
door
to
bolt
and
lock
it
.
Everything
*NL*
depended
on
whether
he
was
,
or
was
not
,
in
time
to
lock
it
.
He
went
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
hurry
,
but
his
legs
refused
to
move
and
he
knew
he
would
not
be
*NL*
in
time
to
lock
the
door
though
he
painfully
strained
all
his
powers
.
He
*NL*
was
seized
by
an
agonizing
fear
.
And
that
fear
was
the
fear
of
death
.
It
*NL*
stood
behind
the
door
.
But
just
when
he
was
clumsily
creeping
toward
the
*NL*
door
,
that
dreadful
something
on
the
other
side
was
already
pressing
*NL*
against
it
and
forcing
its
way
in
.
Something
not
human
--
death
--
was
*NL*
breaking
in
through
that
door
,
and
had
to
be
kept
out
.
He
seized
the
*NL*
door
,
making
a
final
effort
to
hold
it
back
--
to
lock
it
was
no
longer
*NL*
possible
--
but
his
efforts
were
weak
and
clumsy
and
the
door
,
pushed
from
*NL*
behind
by
that
terror
,
opened
and
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
again
it
pushed
from
outside
.
His
last
superhuman
efforts
were
vain
*NL*
and
both
halves
of
the
door
noiselessly
opened
.
It
entered
,
and
it
was
*NL*
death
,
and
Prince
Andrew
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
instant
he
died
,
Prince
Andrew
remembered
that
he
was
asleep
,
*NL*
and
at
the
very
instant
he
died
,
having
made
an
effort
,
he
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
death
!
I
died
--
and
woke
up
.
Yes
,
death
is
an
awakening
!
''
*NL*
And
all
at
once
it
grew
light
in
his
soul
and
the
veil
that
had
till
*NL*
then
concealed
the
unknown
was
lifted
from
his
spiritual
vision
.
He
felt
*NL*
as
if
powers
till
then
confined
within
him
had
been
liberated
,
and
that
*NL*
strange
lightness
did
not
again
leave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
waking
in
a
cold
perspiration
,
he
moved
on
the
divan
,
Natasha
went
*NL*
up
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
.
He
did
not
answer
and
looked
at
*NL*
her
strangely
,
not
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
what
had
happened
to
him
two
days
before
Princess
Mary
's
*NL*
arrival
.
From
that
day
,
as
the
doctor
expressed
it
,
the
wasting
fever
*NL*
assumed
a
malignant
character
,
but
what
the
doctor
said
did
not
interest
*NL*
Natasha
,
she
saw
the
terrible
moral
symptoms
which
to
her
were
more
*NL*
convincing
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
an
awakening
from
life
came
to
Prince
Andrew
together
with
*NL*
his
awakening
from
sleep
.
And
compared
to
the
duration
of
life
it
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
him
slower
than
an
awakening
from
sleep
compared
to
the
*NL*
duration
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
terrible
or
violent
in
this
comparatively
slow
*NL*
awakening
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
last
days
and
hours
passed
in
an
ordinary
and
simple
way
.
Both
*NL*
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
,
who
did
not
leave
him
,
felt
this
.
They
did
*NL*
not
weep
or
shudder
and
during
these
last
days
they
themselves
felt
that
*NL*
they
were
not
attending
on
him
-LRB-
he
was
no
longer
there
,
he
had
left
*NL*
them
-RRB-
but
on
what
reminded
them
most
closely
of
him
--
his
body
.
Both
felt
*NL*
this
so
strongly
that
the
outward
and
terrible
side
of
death
did
not
*NL*
affect
them
and
they
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
foment
their
grief
.
*NL*
Neither
in
his
presence
nor
out
of
it
did
they
weep
,
nor
did
they
ever
*NL*
talk
to
one
another
about
him
.
They
felt
that
they
could
not
express
in
*NL*
words
what
they
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
saw
that
he
was
sinking
slowly
and
quietly
,
deeper
and
deeper
,
*NL*
away
from
them
,
and
they
both
knew
that
this
had
to
be
so
and
that
it
*NL*
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
confessed
,
and
received
communion
:
everyone
came
to
take
leave
of
*NL*
him
.
When
they
brought
his
son
to
him
,
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
boy
's
*NL*
and
turned
away
,
not
because
he
felt
it
hard
and
sad
-LRB-
Princess
Mary
and
*NL*
Natasha
understood
that
-RRB-
but
simply
because
he
thought
it
was
all
that
*NL*
was
required
of
him
,
but
when
they
told
him
to
bless
the
boy
,
he
did
*NL*
what
was
demanded
and
looked
round
as
if
asking
whether
there
was
*NL*
anything
else
he
should
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
last
convulsions
of
the
body
,
which
the
spirit
was
leaving
,
*NL*
occurred
,
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
were
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
over
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
when
his
body
had
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
lain
motionless
,
growing
cold
before
them
.
Natasha
went
up
,
looked
at
*NL*
the
dead
eyes
,
and
hastened
to
close
them
.
She
closed
them
but
did
not
*NL*
kiss
them
,
but
clung
to
that
which
reminded
her
most
nearly
of
him
--
his
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
has
he
gone
?
Where
is
he
now
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
body
,
washed
and
dressed
,
lay
in
the
coffin
on
a
table
,
*NL*
everyone
came
to
take
leave
of
him
and
they
all
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Nicholas
cried
because
his
heart
was
rent
by
painful
perplexity
.
*NL*
The
countess
and
Sonya
cried
from
pity
for
Natasha
and
because
he
was
no
*NL*
more
.
The
old
count
cried
because
he
felt
that
before
long
,
he
,
too
,
*NL*
must
take
the
same
terrible
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
and
Princess
Mary
also
wept
now
,
but
not
because
of
their
own
*NL*
personal
grief
;
they
wept
with
a
reverent
and
softening
emotion
which
*NL*
had
taken
possession
of
their
souls
at
the
consciousness
of
the
simple
*NL*
and
solemn
mystery
of
death
that
had
been
accomplished
in
their
*NL*
presence
.

BOOK
THIRTEEN
:
1812
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Man
's
mind
can
not
grasp
the
causes
of
events
in
their
completeness
,
but
*NL*
the
desire
to
find
those
causes
is
implanted
in
man
's
soul
.
And
without
*NL*
considering
the
multiplicity
and
complexity
of
the
conditions
any
one
of
*NL*
which
taken
separately
may
seem
to
be
the
cause
,
he
snatches
at
the
*NL*
first
approximation
to
a
cause
that
seems
to
him
intelligible
and
says
:
*NL*
``
This
is
the
cause
!
''
In
historical
events
-LRB-
where
the
actions
of
men
are
*NL*
the
subject
of
observation
-RRB-
the
first
and
most
primitive
approximation
*NL*
to
present
itself
was
the
will
of
the
gods
and
,
after
that
,
the
will
of
*NL*
those
who
stood
in
the
most
prominent
position
--
the
heroes
of
history
.
*NL*
But
we
need
only
penetrate
to
the
essence
of
any
historic
event
--
which
*NL*
lies
in
the
activity
of
the
general
mass
of
men
who
take
part
in
it
--
to
*NL*
be
convinced
that
the
will
of
the
historic
hero
does
not
control
the
*NL*
actions
of
the
mass
but
is
itself
continually
controlled
.
It
may
seem
to
*NL*
be
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
we
understand
the
meaning
of
*NL*
historical
events
this
way
or
that
;
yet
there
is
the
same
difference
*NL*
between
a
man
who
says
that
the
people
of
the
West
moved
on
the
East
*NL*
because
Napoleon
wished
it
and
a
man
who
says
that
this
happened
because
*NL*
it
had
to
happen
,
as
there
is
between
those
who
declared
that
the
earth
*NL*
was
stationary
and
that
the
planets
moved
round
it
and
those
who
*NL*
admitted
that
they
did
not
know
what
upheld
the
earth
,
but
knew
there
*NL*
were
laws
directing
its
movement
and
that
of
the
other
planets
.
There
*NL*
is
,
and
can
be
,
no
cause
of
an
historical
event
except
the
one
cause
of
*NL*
all
causes
.
But
there
are
laws
directing
events
,
and
some
of
these
laws
*NL*
are
known
to
us
while
we
are
conscious
of
others
we
can
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
The
discovery
of
these
laws
is
only
possible
when
we
have
quite
*NL*
abandoned
the
attempt
to
find
the
cause
in
the
will
of
some
one
man
,
*NL*
just
as
the
discovery
of
the
laws
of
the
motion
of
the
planets
was
*NL*
possible
only
when
men
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
fixity
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
consider
that
,
next
to
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
the
*NL*
occupation
of
Moscow
by
the
enemy
and
its
destruction
by
fire
,
the
most
*NL*
important
episode
of
the
war
of
1812
was
the
movement
of
the
Russian
*NL*
army
from
the
Ryazana
to
the
Kaluga
road
and
to
the
Tarutino
camp
--
the
*NL*
so-called
flank
march
across
the
Krasnaya
Pakhra
River
.
They
ascribe
the
*NL*
glory
of
that
achievement
of
genius
to
different
men
and
dispute
as
to
*NL*
whom
the
honor
is
due
.
Even
foreign
historians
,
including
the
French
,
*NL*
acknowledge
the
genius
of
the
Russian
commanders
when
they
speak
of
that
*NL*
flank
march
.
But
it
is
hard
to
understand
why
military
writers
,
and
*NL*
following
them
others
,
consider
this
flank
march
to
be
the
profound
*NL*
conception
of
some
one
man
who
saved
Russia
and
destroyed
Napoleon
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
it
is
hard
to
understand
where
the
profundity
and
genius
*NL*
of
this
movement
lay
,
for
not
much
mental
effort
was
needed
to
see
that
*NL*
the
best
position
for
an
army
when
it
is
not
being
attacked
is
where
*NL*
there
are
most
provisions
;
and
even
a
dull
boy
of
thirteen
could
have
*NL*
guessed
that
the
best
position
for
an
army
after
its
retreat
from
Moscow
*NL*
in
1812
was
on
the
Kaluga
road
.
So
it
is
impossible
to
understand
by
*NL*
what
reasoning
the
historians
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
maneuver
*NL*
was
a
profound
one
.
And
it
is
even
more
difficult
to
understand
just
why
*NL*
they
think
that
this
maneuver
was
calculated
to
save
Russia
and
destroy
*NL*
the
French
;
for
this
flank
march
,
had
it
been
preceded
,
accompanied
,
or
*NL*
followed
by
other
circumstances
,
might
have
proved
ruinous
to
the
*NL*
Russians
and
salutary
for
the
French
.
If
the
position
of
the
Russian
*NL*
army
really
began
to
improve
from
the
time
of
that
march
,
it
does
not
at
*NL*
all
follow
that
the
march
was
the
cause
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
flank
march
might
not
only
have
failed
to
give
any
advantage
to
the
*NL*
Russian
army
,
but
might
in
other
circumstances
have
led
to
its
*NL*
destruction
.
What
would
have
happened
had
Moscow
not
burned
down
?
If
*NL*
Murat
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
Russians
?
If
Napoleon
had
not
remained
*NL*
inactive
?
If
the
Russian
army
at
Krasnaya
Pakhra
had
given
battle
as
*NL*
Bennigsen
and
Barclay
advised
?
What
would
have
happened
had
the
French
*NL*
attacked
the
Russians
while
they
were
marching
beyond
the
Pakhra
?
What
*NL*
would
have
happened
if
on
approaching
Tarutino
,
Napoleon
had
attacked
*NL*
the
Russians
with
but
a
tenth
of
the
energy
he
had
shown
when
he
*NL*
attacked
them
at
Smolensk
?
What
would
have
happened
had
the
French
moved
*NL*
on
Petersburg
?
...
In
any
of
these
eventualities
the
flank
march
that
*NL*
brought
salvation
might
have
proved
disastrous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
and
most
incomprehensible
thing
is
that
people
studying
*NL*
history
deliberately
avoid
seeing
that
this
flank
march
can
not
be
*NL*
attributed
to
any
one
man
,
that
no
one
ever
foresaw
it
,
and
that
in
*NL*
reality
,
like
the
retreat
from
Fili
,
it
did
not
suggest
itself
to
anyone
*NL*
in
its
entirety
,
but
resulted
--
moment
by
moment
,
step
by
step
,
event
by
*NL*
event
--
from
an
endless
number
of
most
diverse
circumstances
and
was
only
*NL*
seen
in
its
entirety
when
it
had
been
accomplished
and
belonged
to
the
*NL*
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
council
at
Fili
the
prevailing
thought
in
the
minds
of
the
*NL*
Russian
commanders
was
the
one
naturally
suggesting
itself
,
namely
,
a
*NL*
direct
retreat
by
the
Nizhni
road
.
In
proof
of
this
there
is
the
fact
*NL*
that
the
majority
of
the
council
voted
for
such
a
retreat
,
and
above
all
*NL*
there
is
the
well-known
conversation
after
the
council
,
between
the
*NL*
commander
in
chief
and
Lanskoy
,
who
was
in
charge
of
the
commissariat
*NL*
department
.
Lanskoy
informed
the
commander-in-chief
that
the
army
*NL*
supplies
were
for
the
most
part
stored
along
the
Oka
in
the
Tula
and
*NL*
Ryazan
provinces
,
and
that
if
they
retreated
on
Nizhni
the
army
would
be
*NL*
separated
from
its
supplies
by
the
broad
river
Oka
,
which
can
not
be
*NL*
crossed
early
in
winter
.
This
was
the
first
indication
of
the
necessity
*NL*
of
deviating
from
what
had
previously
seemed
the
most
natural
course
--
a
*NL*
direct
retreat
on
Nizhni-Novgorod
.
The
army
turned
more
to
the
south
,
*NL*
along
the
Ryazan
road
and
nearer
to
its
supplies
.
Subsequently
the
*NL*
inactivity
of
the
French
-LRB-
who
even
lost
sight
of
the
Russian
army
-RRB-
,
*NL*
concern
for
the
safety
of
the
arsenal
at
Tula
,
and
especially
the
*NL*
advantages
of
drawing
nearer
to
its
supplies
caused
the
army
to
turn
*NL*
still
further
south
to
the
Tula
road
.
Having
crossed
over
,
by
a
forced
*NL*
march
,
to
the
Tula
road
beyond
the
Pakhra
,
the
Russian
commanders
*NL*
intended
to
remain
at
Podolsk
and
had
no
thought
of
the
Tarutino
*NL*
position
;
but
innumerable
circumstances
and
the
reappearance
of
French
*NL*
troops
who
had
for
a
time
lost
touch
with
the
Russians
,
and
projects
of
*NL*
giving
battle
,
and
above
all
the
abundance
of
provisions
in
Kaluga
*NL*
province
,
obliged
our
army
to
turn
still
more
to
the
south
and
to
cross
*NL*
from
the
Tula
to
the
Kaluga
road
and
go
to
Tarutino
,
which
was
between
*NL*
the
roads
along
which
those
supplies
lay
.
Just
as
it
is
impossible
to
*NL*
say
when
it
was
decided
to
abandon
Moscow
,
so
it
is
impossible
to
say
*NL*
precisely
when
,
or
by
whom
,
it
was
decided
to
move
to
Tarutino
.
Only
*NL*
when
the
army
had
got
there
,
as
the
result
of
innumerable
and
varying
*NL*
forces
,
did
people
begin
to
assure
themselves
that
they
had
desired
this
*NL*
movement
and
long
ago
foreseen
its
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
famous
flank
movement
merely
consisted
in
this
:
after
the
advance
of
*NL*
the
French
had
ceased
,
the
Russian
army
,
which
had
been
continually
*NL*
retreating
straight
back
from
the
invaders
,
deviated
from
that
direct
*NL*
course
and
,
not
finding
itself
pursued
,
was
naturally
drawn
toward
the
*NL*
district
where
supplies
were
abundant
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
instead
of
imagining
to
ourselves
commanders
of
genius
leading
the
*NL*
Russian
army
,
we
picture
that
army
without
any
leaders
,
it
could
not
*NL*
have
done
anything
but
make
a
return
movement
toward
Moscow
,
describing
*NL*
an
arc
in
the
direction
where
most
provisions
were
to
be
found
and
where
*NL*
the
country
was
richest
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
movement
from
the
Nizhni
to
the
Ryazan
,
Tula
,
and
Kaluga
roads
was
*NL*
so
natural
that
even
the
Russian
marauders
moved
in
that
direction
,
and
*NL*
demands
were
sent
from
Petersburg
for
Kutuzov
to
take
his
army
that
way
.
*NL*
At
Tarutino
Kutuzov
received
what
was
almost
a
reprimand
from
the
*NL*
Emperor
for
having
moved
his
army
along
the
Ryazan
road
,
and
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
letter
indicated
to
him
the
very
position
he
had
already
*NL*
occupied
near
Kaluga
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
rolled
like
a
ball
in
the
direction
of
the
impetus
given
by
the
*NL*
whole
campaign
and
by
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
the
Russian
army
--
when
the
*NL*
strength
of
that
impetus
was
exhausted
and
no
fresh
push
was
received
--
*NL*
assumed
the
position
natural
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
merit
lay
,
not
in
any
strategic
maneuver
of
genius
,
as
it
is
*NL*
called
,
but
in
the
fact
that
he
alone
understood
the
significance
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
He
alone
then
understood
the
meaning
of
the
French
*NL*
army
's
inactivity
,
he
alone
continued
to
assert
that
the
battle
of
*NL*
Borodino
had
been
a
victory
,
he
alone
--
who
as
commander-in-chief
might
*NL*
have
been
expected
to
be
eager
to
attack
--
employed
his
whole
strength
to
*NL*
restrain
the
Russian
army
from
useless
engagements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beast
wounded
at
Borodino
was
lying
where
the
fleeing
hunter
had
*NL*
left
him
;
but
whether
he
was
still
alive
,
whether
he
was
strong
and
*NL*
merely
lying
low
,
the
hunter
did
not
know
.
Suddenly
the
beast
was
heard
*NL*
to
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moan
of
that
wounded
beast
-LRB-
the
French
army
-RRB-
which
betrayed
its
*NL*
calamitous
condition
was
the
sending
of
Lauriston
to
Kutuzov
's
camp
with
*NL*
overtures
for
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
with
his
usual
assurance
that
whatever
entered
his
head
was
*NL*
right
,
wrote
to
Kutuzov
the
first
words
that
occurred
to
him
,
though
*NL*
they
were
meaningless
.
*NL*
*NL*
MONSIEUR
LE
PRINCE
KOUTOUZOV
:
I
am
sending
one
of
my
adjutants-general
*NL*
to
discuss
several
interesting
questions
with
you
.
I
beg
your
Highness
*NL*
to
credit
what
he
says
to
you
,
especially
when
he
expresses
the
*NL*
sentiment
of
esteem
and
special
regard
I
have
long
entertained
for
your
*NL*
person
.
This
letter
having
no
other
object
,
I
pray
God
,
monsieur
le
*NL*
Prince
Koutouzov
,
to
keep
you
in
His
holy
and
gracious
protection
!
*NL*
*NL*
NAPOLEON
MOSCOW
,
OCTOBER
30
,
1812
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
replied
:
``
I
should
be
cursed
by
posterity
were
I
looked
on
as
*NL*
the
initiator
of
a
settlement
of
any
sort
.
Such
is
the
present
spirit
of
*NL*
my
nation
.
''
But
he
continued
to
exert
all
his
powers
to
restrain
his
*NL*
troops
from
attacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
month
that
the
French
troops
were
pillaging
in
Moscow
and
the
*NL*
Russian
troops
were
quietly
encamped
at
Tarutino
,
a
change
had
taken
*NL*
place
in
the
relative
strength
of
the
two
armies
--
both
in
spirit
and
in
*NL*
number
--
as
a
result
of
which
the
superiority
had
passed
to
the
Russian
*NL*
side
.
Though
the
condition
and
numbers
of
the
French
army
were
unknown
*NL*
to
the
Russians
,
as
soon
as
that
change
occurred
the
need
of
attacking
*NL*
at
once
showed
itself
by
countless
signs
.
These
signs
were
:
Lauriston
's
*NL*
mission
;
the
abundance
of
provisions
at
Tarutino
;
the
reports
coming
in
*NL*
from
all
sides
of
the
inactivity
and
disorder
of
the
French
;
the
flow
of
*NL*
recruits
to
our
regiments
;
the
fine
weather
;
the
long
rest
the
Russian
*NL*
soldiers
had
enjoyed
,
and
the
impatience
to
do
what
they
had
been
*NL*
assembled
for
,
which
usually
shows
itself
in
an
army
that
has
been
*NL*
resting
;
curiosity
as
to
what
the
French
army
,
so
long
lost
sight
of
,
*NL*
was
doing
;
the
boldness
with
which
our
outposts
now
scouted
close
up
to
*NL*
the
French
stationed
at
Tarutino
;
the
news
of
easy
successes
gained
by
*NL*
peasants
and
guerrilla
troops
over
the
French
,
the
envy
aroused
by
this
;
*NL*
the
desire
for
revenge
that
lay
in
the
heart
of
every
Russian
as
long
as
*NL*
the
French
were
in
Moscow
,
and
-LRB-
above
all
-RRB-
a
dim
consciousness
in
every
*NL*
soldier
's
mind
that
the
relative
strength
of
the
armies
had
changed
and
*NL*
that
the
advantage
was
now
on
our
side
.
There
was
a
substantial
change
*NL*
in
the
relative
strength
,
and
an
advance
had
become
inevitable
.
And
at
*NL*
once
,
as
a
clock
begins
to
strike
and
chime
as
soon
as
the
minute
hand
*NL*
has
completed
a
full
circle
,
this
change
was
shown
by
an
increased
*NL*
activity
,
whirring
,
and
chiming
in
the
higher
spheres
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
army
was
commanded
by
Kutuzov
and
his
staff
,
and
also
by
the
*NL*
Emperor
from
Petersburg
.
Before
the
news
of
the
abandonment
of
Moscow
*NL*
had
been
received
in
Petersburg
,
a
detailed
plan
of
the
whole
campaign
*NL*
had
been
drawn
up
and
sent
to
Kutuzov
for
his
guidance
.
Though
this
plan
*NL*
had
been
drawn
up
on
the
supposition
that
Moscow
was
still
in
our
hands
,
*NL*
it
was
approved
by
the
staff
and
accepted
as
a
basis
for
action
.
Kutuzov
*NL*
only
replied
that
movements
arranged
from
a
distance
were
always
*NL*
difficult
to
execute
.
So
fresh
instructions
were
sent
for
the
solution
*NL*
of
difficulties
that
might
be
encountered
,
as
well
as
fresh
people
who
*NL*
were
to
watch
Kutuzov
's
actions
and
report
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
the
whole
staff
of
the
Russian
army
was
now
reorganized
.
*NL*
The
posts
left
vacant
by
Bagration
,
who
had
been
killed
,
and
by
Barclay
,
*NL*
who
had
gone
away
in
dudgeon
,
had
to
be
filled
.
Very
serious
*NL*
consideration
was
given
to
the
question
whether
it
would
be
better
to
*NL*
put
A
in
B
's
place
and
B
in
D
's
,
or
on
the
contrary
to
put
D
in
A
's
*NL*
place
,
and
so
on
--
as
if
anything
more
than
A
's
or
B
's
satisfaction
*NL*
depended
on
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
result
of
the
hostility
between
Kutuzov
and
Bennigsen
,
his
Chief
of
*NL*
Staff
,
the
presence
of
confidential
representatives
of
the
Emperor
,
and
*NL*
these
transfers
,
a
more
than
usually
complicated
play
of
parties
was
*NL*
going
on
among
the
staff
of
the
army
.
A
was
undermining
B
,
D
was
*NL*
undermining
C
,
and
so
on
in
all
possible
combinations
and
permutations
.
*NL*
In
all
these
plottings
the
subject
of
intrigue
was
generally
the
conduct
*NL*
of
the
war
,
which
all
these
men
believed
they
were
directing
;
but
this
*NL*
affair
of
the
war
went
on
independently
of
them
,
as
it
had
to
go
:
that
*NL*
is
,
never
in
the
way
people
devised
,
but
flowing
always
from
the
*NL*
essential
attitude
of
the
masses
.
Only
in
the
highest
spheres
did
all
*NL*
these
schemes
,
crossings
,
and
interminglings
appear
to
be
a
true
*NL*
reflection
of
what
had
to
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Michael
Ilarionovich
!
-LRB-
wrote
the
Emperor
on
the
second
of
October
*NL*
in
a
letter
that
reached
Kutuzov
after
the
battle
at
Tarutino
-RRB-
Since
*NL*
September
2
Moscow
has
been
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
Your
last
reports
*NL*
were
written
on
the
twentieth
,
and
during
all
this
time
not
only
has
no
*NL*
action
been
taken
against
the
enemy
or
for
the
relief
of
the
ancient
*NL*
capital
,
but
according
to
your
last
report
you
have
even
retreated
*NL*
farther
.
Serpukhov
is
already
occupied
by
an
enemy
detachment
and
Tula
*NL*
with
its
famous
arsenal
so
indispensable
to
the
army
,
is
in
danger
.
From
*NL*
General
Wintzingerode
's
reports
,
I
see
that
an
enemy
corps
of
ten
*NL*
thousand
men
is
moving
on
the
Petersburg
road
.
Another
corps
of
several
*NL*
thousand
men
is
moving
on
Dmitrov
.
A
third
has
advanced
along
the
*NL*
Vladimir
road
,
and
a
fourth
,
rather
considerable
detachment
is
stationed
*NL*
between
Ruza
and
Mozhaysk
.
Napoleon
himself
was
in
Moscow
as
late
as
the
*NL*
twenty-fifth
.
In
view
of
all
this
information
,
when
the
enemy
has
*NL*
scattered
his
forces
in
large
detachments
,
and
with
Napoleon
and
his
*NL*
Guards
in
Moscow
,
is
it
possible
that
the
enemy
's
forces
confronting
you
*NL*
are
so
considerable
as
not
to
allow
of
your
taking
the
offensive
?
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
is
probably
pursuing
you
with
detachments
,
or
at
most
with
*NL*
an
army
corps
much
weaker
than
the
army
entrusted
to
you
.
It
would
seem
*NL*
that
,
availing
yourself
of
these
circumstances
,
you
might
advantageously
*NL*
attack
a
weaker
one
and
annihilate
him
,
or
at
least
oblige
him
to
*NL*
retreat
,
retaining
in
our
hands
an
important
part
of
the
provinces
now
*NL*
occupied
by
the
enemy
,
and
thereby
averting
danger
from
Tula
and
other
*NL*
towns
in
the
interior
.
You
will
be
responsible
if
the
enemy
is
able
to
*NL*
direct
a
force
of
any
size
against
Petersburg
to
threaten
this
capital
*NL*
in
which
it
has
not
been
possible
to
retain
many
troops
;
for
with
the
*NL*
army
entrusted
to
you
,
and
acting
with
resolution
and
energy
,
you
have
*NL*
ample
means
to
avert
this
fresh
calamity
.
Remember
that
you
have
still
*NL*
to
answer
to
our
offended
country
for
the
loss
of
Moscow
.
You
have
*NL*
experienced
my
readiness
to
reward
you
.
That
readiness
will
not
weaken
*NL*
in
me
,
but
I
and
Russia
have
a
right
to
expect
from
you
all
the
zeal
,
*NL*
firmness
,
and
success
which
your
intellect
,
military
talent
,
and
the
*NL*
courage
of
the
troops
you
command
justify
us
in
expecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
by
the
time
this
letter
,
which
proved
that
the
real
relation
of
the
*NL*
forces
had
already
made
itself
felt
in
Petersburg
,
was
dispatched
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
had
found
himself
unable
any
longer
to
restrain
the
army
he
*NL*
commanded
from
attacking
and
a
battle
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
of
October
a
Cossack
,
Shapovalov
,
who
was
out
scouting
,
*NL*
killed
one
hare
and
wounded
another
.
Following
the
wounded
hare
he
made
*NL*
his
way
far
into
the
forest
and
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
Murat
's
*NL*
army
,
encamped
there
without
any
precautions
.
The
Cossack
laughingly
*NL*
told
his
comrades
how
he
had
almost
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
French
.
*NL*
A
cornet
,
hearing
the
story
,
informed
his
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cossack
was
sent
for
and
questioned
.
The
Cossack
officers
wished
to
*NL*
take
advantage
of
this
chance
to
capture
some
horses
,
but
one
of
the
*NL*
superior
officers
,
who
was
acquainted
with
the
higher
authorities
,
*NL*
reported
the
incident
to
a
general
on
the
staff
.
The
state
of
things
on
*NL*
the
staff
had
of
late
been
exceedingly
strained
.
Ermolov
had
been
to
see
*NL*
Bennigsen
a
few
days
previously
and
had
entreated
him
to
use
his
*NL*
influence
with
the
commander-in-chief
to
induce
him
to
take
the
*NL*
offensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
not
know
you
I
should
think
you
did
not
want
what
you
are
*NL*
asking
for
.
I
need
only
advise
anything
and
his
Highness
is
sure
to
do
*NL*
the
opposite
,
''
replied
Bennigsen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cossack
's
report
,
confirmed
by
horse
patrols
who
were
sent
out
,
was
*NL*
the
final
proof
that
events
had
matured
.
The
tightly
coiled
spring
was
*NL*
released
,
the
clock
began
to
whirr
and
the
chimes
to
play
.
Despite
all
*NL*
his
supposed
power
,
his
intellect
,
his
experience
,
and
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
men
,
Kutuzov
--
having
taken
into
consideration
the
Cossack
's
report
,
a
*NL*
note
from
Bennigsen
who
sent
personal
reports
to
the
Emperor
,
the
wishes
*NL*
he
supposed
the
Emperor
to
hold
,
and
the
fact
that
all
the
generals
*NL*
expressed
the
same
wish
--
could
no
longer
check
the
inevitable
movement
,
*NL*
and
gave
the
order
to
do
what
he
regarded
as
useless
and
harmful
--
gave
*NL*
his
approval
,
that
is
,
to
the
accomplished
fact
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Bennigsen
's
note
and
the
Cossack
's
information
that
the
left
flank
of
*NL*
the
French
was
unguarded
were
merely
final
indications
that
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
order
an
attack
,
and
it
was
fixed
for
the
fifth
of
October
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
fourth
of
October
Kutuzov
signed
the
dispositions
.
*NL*
Toll
read
them
to
Ermolov
,
asking
him
to
attend
to
the
further
*NL*
arrangements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
--
all
right
.
I
have
n't
time
just
now
,
''
replied
Ermolov
,
and
*NL*
left
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispositions
drawn
up
by
Toll
were
very
good
.
As
in
the
Austerlitz
*NL*
dispositions
,
it
was
written
--
though
not
in
German
this
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
First
Column
will
march
here
and
here
,
''
``
the
Second
Column
will
*NL*
march
there
and
there
,
''
and
so
on
;
and
on
paper
,
all
these
columns
*NL*
arrived
at
their
places
at
the
appointed
time
and
destroyed
the
enemy
.
*NL*
Everything
had
been
admirably
thought
out
as
is
usual
in
dispositions
,
*NL*
and
as
is
always
the
case
,
not
a
single
column
reached
its
place
at
the
*NL*
appointed
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
necessary
number
of
copies
of
the
dispositions
had
been
*NL*
prepared
,
an
officer
was
summoned
and
sent
to
deliver
them
to
Ermolov
to
*NL*
deal
with
.
A
young
officer
of
the
Horse
Guards
,
Kutuzov
's
orderly
,
*NL*
pleased
at
the
importance
of
the
mission
entrusted
to
him
,
went
to
*NL*
Ermolov
's
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
away
,
''
said
Ermolov
's
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
of
the
Horse
Guards
went
to
a
general
with
whom
Ermolov
was
*NL*
often
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
and
the
general
's
out
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
,
mounting
his
horse
,
rode
off
to
someone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
they
do
n't
make
me
responsible
for
this
delay
!
What
a
nuisance
*NL*
it
is
!
''
thought
the
officer
,
and
he
rode
round
the
whole
camp
.
One
man
*NL*
said
he
had
seen
Ermolov
ride
past
with
some
other
generals
,
others
said
*NL*
he
must
have
returned
home
.
The
officer
searched
till
six
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
evening
without
even
stopping
to
eat
.
Ermolov
was
nowhere
to
be
found
*NL*
and
no
one
knew
where
he
was
.
The
officer
snatched
a
little
food
at
a
*NL*
comrade
's
,
and
rode
again
to
the
vanguard
to
find
Miloradovich
.
*NL*
Miloradovich
too
was
away
,
but
here
he
was
told
that
he
had
gone
to
a
*NL*
ball
at
General
Kikin
's
and
that
Ermolov
was
probably
there
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
,
over
at
Echkino
,
''
said
a
Cossack
officer
,
pointing
to
a
*NL*
country
house
in
the
far
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
outside
our
line
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
put
two
regiments
as
outposts
,
and
they
're
having
such
a
spree
*NL*
there
,
it
's
awful
!
Two
bands
and
three
sets
of
singers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
rode
out
beyond
our
lines
to
Echkino
.
While
still
at
a
*NL*
distance
he
heard
as
he
rode
the
merry
sounds
of
a
soldier
's
dance
song
*NL*
proceeding
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meadows
...
in
the
meadows
!
''
he
heard
,
accompanied
by
whistling
*NL*
and
the
sound
of
a
torban
,
drowned
every
now
and
then
by
shouts
.
These
*NL*
sounds
made
his
spirits
rise
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
was
afraid
that
he
*NL*
would
be
blamed
for
not
having
executed
sooner
the
important
order
*NL*
entrusted
to
him
.
It
was
already
past
eight
o'clock
.
He
dismounted
and
*NL*
went
up
into
the
porch
of
a
large
country
house
which
had
remained
*NL*
intact
between
the
Russian
and
French
forces
.
In
the
refreshment
room
*NL*
and
the
hall
,
footmen
were
bustling
about
with
wine
and
viands
.
Groups
*NL*
of
singers
stood
outside
the
windows
.
The
officer
was
admitted
and
*NL*
immediately
saw
all
the
chief
generals
of
the
army
together
,
and
among
*NL*
them
Ermolov
's
big
imposing
figure
.
They
all
had
their
coats
unbuttoned
*NL*
and
were
standing
in
a
semicircle
with
flushed
and
animated
faces
,
*NL*
laughing
loudly
.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
a
short
handsome
general
with
*NL*
a
red
face
was
dancing
the
trepak
with
much
spirit
and
agility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
Bravo
,
Nicholas
Ivanych
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
felt
that
by
arriving
with
important
orders
at
such
a
moment
*NL*
he
was
doubly
to
blame
,
and
he
would
have
preferred
to
wait
;
but
one
of
*NL*
the
generals
espied
him
and
,
hearing
what
he
had
come
about
,
informed
*NL*
Ermolov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ermolov
came
forward
with
a
frown
on
his
face
and
,
hearing
what
the
*NL*
officer
had
to
say
,
took
the
papers
from
him
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
he
went
off
just
by
chance
?
''
said
a
comrade
,
who
was
on
the
*NL*
staff
that
evening
,
to
the
officer
of
the
Horse
Guards
,
referring
to
*NL*
Ermolov
.
``
It
was
a
trick
.
It
was
done
on
purpose
to
get
Konovnitsyn
into
*NL*
trouble
.
You
'll
see
what
a
mess
there
'll
be
tomorrow
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
decrepit
Kutuzov
,
having
given
orders
to
be
called
early
,
*NL*
said
his
prayers
,
dressed
,
and
,
with
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
*NL*
having
to
direct
a
battle
he
did
not
approve
of
,
got
into
his
caleche
*NL*
and
drove
from
Letashovka
-LRB-
a
village
three
and
a
half
miles
from
*NL*
Tarutino
-RRB-
to
the
place
where
the
attacking
columns
were
to
meet
.
He
sat
*NL*
in
the
caleche
,
dozing
and
waking
up
by
turns
,
and
listening
for
any
*NL*
sound
of
firing
on
the
right
as
an
indication
that
the
action
had
begun
.
*NL*
But
all
was
still
quiet
.
A
damp
dull
autumn
morning
was
just
dawning
.
On
*NL*
approaching
Tarutino
Kutuzov
noticed
cavalrymen
leading
their
horses
to
*NL*
water
across
the
road
along
which
he
was
driving
.
Kutuzov
looked
at
them
*NL*
searchingly
,
stopped
his
carriage
,
and
inquired
what
regiment
they
*NL*
belonged
to
.
They
belonged
to
a
column
that
should
have
been
far
in
*NL*
front
and
in
ambush
long
before
then
.
``
It
may
be
a
mistake
,
''
thought
the
*NL*
old
commander-in-chief
.
But
a
little
further
on
he
saw
infantry
*NL*
regiments
with
their
arms
piled
and
the
soldiers
,
only
partly
dressed
,
*NL*
eating
their
rye
porridge
and
carrying
fuel
.
He
sent
for
an
officer
.
The
*NL*
officer
reported
that
no
order
to
advance
had
been
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
Not
rec
...
''
Kutuzov
began
,
but
checked
himself
immediately
and
*NL*
sent
for
a
senior
officer
.
Getting
out
of
his
caleche
,
he
waited
with
*NL*
drooping
head
and
breathing
heavily
,
pacing
silently
up
and
down
.
When
*NL*
Eykhen
,
the
officer
of
the
general
staff
whom
he
had
summoned
,
appeared
,
*NL*
Kutuzov
went
purple
in
the
face
,
not
because
that
officer
was
to
blame
*NL*
for
the
mistake
,
but
because
he
was
an
object
of
sufficient
importance
*NL*
for
him
to
vent
his
wrath
on
.
Trembling
and
panting
the
old
man
fell
*NL*
into
that
state
of
fury
in
which
he
sometimes
used
to
roll
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
he
fell
upon
Eykhen
,
threatening
him
with
his
hands
,
*NL*
shouting
and
loading
him
with
gross
abuse
.
Another
man
,
Captain
Brozin
,
*NL*
who
happened
to
turn
up
and
who
was
not
at
all
to
blame
,
suffered
the
*NL*
same
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
another
blackguard
are
you
?
I
'll
have
you
shot
!
*NL*
Scoundrels
!
''
yelled
Kutuzov
in
a
hoarse
voice
,
waving
his
arms
and
*NL*
reeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
suffering
physically
.
He
,
the
commander-in-chief
,
a
Serene
*NL*
Highness
who
everybody
said
possessed
powers
such
as
no
man
had
ever
had
*NL*
in
Russia
,
to
be
placed
in
this
position
--
made
the
laughingstock
of
the
*NL*
whole
army
!
``
I
need
n't
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
pray
about
today
,
or
*NL*
have
kept
awake
thinking
everything
over
all
night
,
''
thought
he
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
When
I
was
a
chit
of
an
officer
no
one
would
have
dared
to
*NL*
mock
me
so
...
and
now
!
''
He
was
in
a
state
of
physical
suffering
as
if
*NL*
from
corporal
punishment
,
and
could
not
avoid
expressing
it
by
cries
of
*NL*
anger
and
distress
.
But
his
strength
soon
began
to
fail
him
,
and
looking
*NL*
about
him
,
conscious
of
having
said
much
that
was
amiss
,
he
again
got
*NL*
into
his
caleche
and
drove
back
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wrath
,
once
expended
,
did
not
return
,
and
blinking
feebly
he
*NL*
listened
to
excuses
and
self-justifications
-LRB-
Ermolov
did
not
come
to
see
*NL*
him
till
the
next
day
-RRB-
and
to
the
insistence
of
Bennigsen
,
Konovnitsyn
,
*NL*
and
Toll
that
the
movement
that
had
miscarried
should
be
executed
next
*NL*
day
.
And
once
more
Kutuzov
had
to
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
troops
assembled
in
their
appointed
places
in
the
evening
*NL*
and
advanced
during
the
night
.
It
was
an
autumn
night
with
dark
purple
*NL*
clouds
,
but
no
rain
.
The
ground
was
damp
but
not
muddy
,
and
the
troops
*NL*
advanced
noiselessly
,
only
occasionally
a
jingling
of
the
artillery
*NL*
could
be
faintly
heard
.
The
men
were
forbidden
to
talk
out
loud
,
to
*NL*
smoke
their
pipes
,
or
to
strike
a
light
,
and
they
tried
to
prevent
their
*NL*
horses
neighing
.
The
secrecy
of
the
undertaking
heightened
its
charm
and
*NL*
they
marched
gaily
.
Some
columns
,
supposing
they
had
reached
their
*NL*
destination
,
halted
,
piled
arms
,
and
settled
down
on
the
cold
ground
,
*NL*
but
the
majority
marched
all
night
and
arrived
at
places
where
they
*NL*
evidently
should
not
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Count
Orlov-Denisov
with
his
Cossacks
-LRB-
the
least
important
*NL*
detachment
of
all
-RRB-
got
to
his
appointed
place
at
the
right
time
.
This
*NL*
detachment
halted
at
the
outskirts
of
a
forest
,
on
the
path
leading
from
*NL*
the
village
of
Stromilova
to
Dmitrovsk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
dawn
,
Count
Orlov-Denisov
,
who
had
dozed
off
,
was
awakened
by
a
*NL*
deserter
from
the
French
army
being
brought
to
him
.
This
was
a
Polish
*NL*
sergeant
of
Poniatowski
's
corps
,
who
explained
in
Polish
that
he
had
*NL*
come
over
because
he
had
been
slighted
in
the
service
:
that
he
ought
*NL*
long
ago
to
have
been
made
an
officer
,
that
he
was
braver
than
any
of
*NL*
them
,
and
so
he
had
left
them
and
wished
to
pay
them
out
.
He
said
that
*NL*
Murat
was
spending
the
night
less
than
a
mile
from
where
they
were
,
and
*NL*
that
if
they
would
let
him
have
a
convoy
of
a
hundred
men
he
would
*NL*
capture
him
alive
.
Count
Orlov-Denisov
consulted
his
fellow
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
offer
was
too
tempting
to
be
refused
.
Everyone
volunteered
to
go
and
*NL*
everybody
advised
making
the
attempt
.
After
much
disputing
and
arguing
,
*NL*
Major-General
Grekov
with
two
Cossack
regiments
decided
to
go
with
the
*NL*
Polish
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
remember
,
''
said
Count
Orlov-Denisov
to
the
sergeant
at
parting
,
*NL*
``
if
you
have
been
lying
I
'll
have
you
hanged
like
a
dog
;
but
if
it
's
*NL*
true
you
shall
have
a
hundred
gold
pieces
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
replying
,
the
sergeant
,
with
a
resolute
air
,
mounted
and
rode
*NL*
away
with
Grekov
whose
men
had
quickly
assembled
.
They
disappeared
into
*NL*
the
forest
,
and
Count
Orlov-Denisov
,
having
seen
Grekov
off
,
returned
,
*NL*
shivering
from
the
freshness
of
the
early
dawn
and
excited
by
what
he
*NL*
had
undertaken
on
his
own
responsibility
,
and
began
looking
at
the
enemy
*NL*
camp
,
now
just
visible
in
the
deceptive
light
of
dawn
and
the
dying
*NL*
campfires
.
Our
columns
ought
to
have
begun
to
appear
on
an
open
*NL*
declivity
to
his
right
.
He
looked
in
that
direction
,
but
though
the
*NL*
columns
would
have
been
visible
quite
far
off
,
they
were
not
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
the
count
that
things
were
beginning
to
stir
in
the
French
*NL*
camp
,
and
his
keen-sighted
adjutant
confirmed
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
really
too
late
,
''
said
Count
Orlov
,
looking
at
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
often
happens
when
someone
we
have
trusted
is
no
longer
before
our
*NL*
eyes
,
it
suddenly
seemed
quite
clear
and
obvious
to
him
that
the
*NL*
sergeant
was
an
impostor
,
that
he
had
lied
,
and
that
the
whole
Russian
*NL*
attack
would
be
ruined
by
the
absence
of
those
two
regiments
,
which
he
*NL*
would
lead
away
heaven
only
knew
where
.
How
could
one
capture
a
*NL*
commander-in-chief
from
among
such
a
mass
of
troops
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
that
rascal
was
lying
,
''
said
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
still
be
called
back
,
''
said
one
of
his
suite
,
who
like
Count
*NL*
Orlov
felt
distrustful
of
the
adventure
when
he
looked
at
the
enemy
's
*NL*
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Really
...
what
do
you
think
?
Should
we
let
them
go
on
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
them
fetched
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
them
back
,
fetch
them
back
!
''
said
Count
Orlov
with
sudden
*NL*
determination
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
``
It
will
be
too
late
.
It
is
quite
*NL*
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
adjutant
galloped
through
the
forest
after
Grekov
.
When
Grekov
*NL*
returned
,
Count
Orlov-Denisov
,
excited
both
by
the
abandoned
attempt
and
*NL*
by
vainly
awaiting
the
infantry
columns
that
still
did
not
appear
,
as
*NL*
well
as
by
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
,
resolved
to
advance
.
All
his
men
*NL*
felt
the
same
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mount
!
''
he
commanded
in
a
whisper
.
The
men
took
their
places
and
*NL*
crossed
themselves
...
``
Forward
,
with
God
's
aid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah-ah-ah
!
''
reverberated
in
the
forest
,
and
the
Cossack
companies
,
*NL*
trailing
their
lances
and
advancing
one
after
another
as
if
poured
out
*NL*
of
a
sack
,
dashed
gaily
across
the
brook
toward
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
desperate
,
frightened
yell
from
the
first
French
soldier
who
saw
the
*NL*
Cossacks
,
and
all
who
were
in
the
camp
,
undressed
and
only
just
waking
*NL*
up
,
ran
off
in
all
directions
,
abandoning
cannons
,
muskets
,
and
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
Cossacks
pursued
the
French
,
without
heeding
what
was
behind
and
*NL*
around
them
,
they
would
have
captured
Murat
and
everything
there
.
That
*NL*
was
what
the
officers
desired
.
But
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
*NL*
Cossacks
budge
when
once
they
had
got
booty
and
prisoners
.
None
of
them
*NL*
listened
to
orders
.
Fifteen
hundred
prisoners
and
thirty-eight
guns
were
*NL*
taken
on
the
spot
,
besides
standards
and
-LRB-
what
seemed
most
important
to
*NL*
the
Cossacks
-RRB-
horses
,
saddles
,
horsecloths
,
and
the
like
.
All
this
had
*NL*
to
be
dealt
with
,
the
prisoners
and
guns
secured
,
the
booty
divided
--
not
*NL*
without
some
shouting
and
even
a
little
fighting
among
themselves
--
and
*NL*
it
was
on
this
that
the
Cossacks
all
busied
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
not
being
farther
pursued
,
began
to
recover
themselves
:
they
*NL*
formed
into
detachments
and
began
firing
.
Orlov-Denisov
,
still
waiting
*NL*
for
the
other
columns
to
arrive
,
advanced
no
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
according
to
the
dispositions
which
said
that
``
the
First
*NL*
Column
will
march
''
and
so
on
,
the
infantry
of
the
belated
columns
,
*NL*
commanded
by
Bennigsen
and
directed
by
Toll
,
had
started
in
due
order
*NL*
and
,
as
always
happens
,
had
got
somewhere
,
but
not
to
their
appointed
*NL*
places
.
As
always
happens
the
men
,
starting
cheerfully
,
began
to
halt
;
*NL*
murmurs
were
heard
,
there
was
a
sense
of
confusion
,
and
finally
a
*NL*
backward
movement
.
Adjutants
and
generals
galloped
about
,
shouted
,
grew
*NL*
angry
,
quarreled
,
said
they
had
come
quite
wrong
and
were
late
,
gave
*NL*
vent
to
a
little
abuse
,
and
at
last
gave
it
all
up
and
went
forward
,
*NL*
simply
to
get
somewhere
.
``
We
shall
get
somewhere
or
other
!
''
And
they
did
*NL*
indeed
get
somewhere
,
though
not
to
their
right
places
;
a
few
eventually
*NL*
even
got
to
their
right
place
,
but
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
and
only
in
*NL*
time
to
be
fired
at
.
Toll
,
who
in
this
battle
played
the
part
of
*NL*
Weyrother
at
Austerlitz
,
galloped
assiduously
from
place
to
place
,
*NL*
finding
everything
upside
down
everywhere
.
Thus
he
stumbled
on
Bagovut
's
*NL*
corps
in
a
wood
when
it
was
already
broad
daylight
,
though
the
corps
*NL*
should
long
before
have
joined
Orlov-Denisov
.
Excited
and
vexed
by
the
*NL*
failure
and
supposing
that
someone
must
be
responsible
for
it
,
Toll
*NL*
galloped
up
to
the
commander
of
the
corps
and
began
upbraiding
him
*NL*
severely
,
saying
that
he
ought
to
be
shot
.
General
Bagovut
,
a
fighting
*NL*
old
soldier
of
placid
temperament
,
being
also
upset
by
all
the
delay
,
*NL*
confusion
,
and
cross-purposes
,
fell
into
a
rage
to
everybody
's
surprise
*NL*
and
quite
contrary
to
his
usual
character
and
said
disagreeable
things
*NL*
to
Toll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
not
to
take
lessons
from
anyone
,
but
I
can
die
with
my
men
as
*NL*
well
as
anybody
,
''
he
said
,
and
advanced
with
a
single
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
out
onto
a
field
under
the
enemy
's
fire
,
this
brave
general
went
*NL*
straight
ahead
,
leading
his
men
under
fire
,
without
considering
in
his
*NL*
agitation
whether
going
into
action
now
,
with
a
single
division
,
would
*NL*
be
of
any
use
or
no
.
Danger
,
cannon
balls
,
and
bullets
were
just
what
he
*NL*
needed
in
his
angry
mood
.
One
of
the
first
bullets
killed
him
,
and
other
*NL*
bullets
killed
many
of
his
men
.
And
his
division
remained
under
fire
for
*NL*
some
time
quite
uselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
another
column
was
to
have
attacked
the
French
from
the
front
,
*NL*
but
Kutuzov
accompanied
that
column
.
He
well
knew
that
nothing
but
*NL*
confusion
would
come
of
this
battle
undertaken
against
his
will
,
and
as
*NL*
far
as
was
in
his
power
held
the
troops
back
.
He
did
not
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rode
silently
on
his
small
gray
horse
,
indolently
answering
*NL*
suggestions
that
they
should
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
word
attack
is
always
on
your
tongue
,
but
you
do
n't
see
that
we
are
*NL*
unable
to
execute
complicated
maneuvers
,
''
said
he
to
Miloradovich
who
*NL*
asked
permission
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
n't
take
Murat
prisoner
this
morning
or
get
to
the
place
in
*NL*
time
,
and
nothing
can
be
done
now
!
''
he
replied
to
someone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Kutuzov
was
informed
that
at
the
French
rear
--
where
according
to
*NL*
the
reports
of
the
Cossacks
there
had
previously
been
nobody
--
there
were
*NL*
now
two
battalions
of
Poles
,
he
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
Ermolov
who
*NL*
was
behind
him
and
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
since
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
!
They
are
asking
to
attack
and
making
plans
of
all
kinds
,
but
*NL*
as
soon
as
one
gets
to
business
nothing
is
ready
,
and
the
enemy
,
*NL*
forewarned
,
takes
measures
accordingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ermolov
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
smiled
faintly
on
hearing
these
words
.
*NL*
He
understood
that
for
him
the
storm
had
blown
over
,
and
that
Kutuzov
*NL*
would
content
himself
with
that
hint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
having
a
little
fun
at
my
expense
,
''
said
Ermolov
softly
,
nudging
*NL*
with
his
knee
Raevski
who
was
at
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
,
Ermolov
moved
up
to
Kutuzov
and
respectfully
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
too
late
yet
,
your
Highness
--
the
enemy
has
not
gone
away
--
if
*NL*
you
were
to
order
an
attack
!
If
not
,
the
Guards
will
not
so
much
as
see
*NL*
a
little
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
did
not
reply
,
but
when
they
reported
to
him
that
Murat
's
troops
*NL*
were
in
retreat
he
ordered
an
advance
,
though
at
every
hundred
paces
he
*NL*
halted
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
battle
consisted
in
what
Orlov-Denisov
's
Cossacks
had
done
:
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
army
merely
lost
some
hundreds
of
men
uselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
this
battle
Kutuzov
received
a
diamond
decoration
,
and
*NL*
Bennigsen
some
diamonds
and
a
hundred
thousand
rubles
,
others
also
*NL*
received
pleasant
recognitions
corresponding
to
their
various
grades
,
*NL*
and
following
the
battle
fresh
changes
were
made
in
the
staff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
everything
is
done
with
us
,
all
topsy-turvy
!
''
said
the
*NL*
Russian
officers
and
generals
after
the
Tarutino
battle
,
letting
it
be
*NL*
understood
that
some
fool
there
is
doing
things
all
wrong
but
that
we
*NL*
ourselves
should
not
have
done
so
,
just
as
people
speak
today
.
But
*NL*
people
who
talk
like
that
either
do
not
know
what
they
are
talking
about
*NL*
or
deliberately
deceive
themselves
.
No
battle
--
Tarutino
,
Borodino
,
or
*NL*
Austerlitz
--
takes
place
as
those
who
planned
it
anticipated
.
That
is
an
*NL*
essential
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
countless
number
of
free
forces
-LRB-
for
nowhere
is
man
freer
than
during
*NL*
a
battle
,
where
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
-RRB-
influence
the
course
*NL*
taken
by
the
fight
,
and
that
course
never
can
be
known
in
advance
and
*NL*
never
coincides
with
the
direction
of
any
one
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
many
simultaneously
and
variously
directed
forces
act
on
a
given
*NL*
body
,
the
direction
of
its
motion
can
not
coincide
with
any
one
of
those
*NL*
forces
,
but
will
always
be
a
mean
--
what
in
mechanics
is
represented
by
*NL*
the
diagonal
of
a
parallelogram
of
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
in
the
descriptions
given
by
historians
,
especially
French
ones
,
we
*NL*
find
their
wars
and
battles
carried
out
in
accordance
with
previously
*NL*
formed
plans
,
the
only
conclusion
to
be
drawn
is
that
those
descriptions
*NL*
are
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
of
Tarutino
obviously
did
not
attain
the
aim
Toll
had
in
*NL*
view
--
to
lead
the
troops
into
action
in
the
order
prescribed
by
the
*NL*
dispositions
;
nor
that
which
Count
Orlov-Denisov
may
have
had
in
view
--
*NL*
to
take
Murat
prisoner
;
nor
the
result
of
immediately
destroying
the
*NL*
whole
corps
,
which
Bennigsen
and
others
may
have
had
in
view
;
nor
the
*NL*
aim
of
the
officer
who
wished
to
go
into
action
to
distinguish
himself
;
*NL*
nor
that
of
the
Cossack
who
wanted
more
booty
than
he
got
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
But
if
the
aim
of
the
battle
was
what
actually
resulted
and
what
all
the
*NL*
Russians
of
that
day
desired
--
to
drive
the
French
out
of
Russia
and
*NL*
destroy
their
army
--
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
battle
of
Tarutino
,
just
*NL*
because
of
its
incongruities
,
was
exactly
what
was
wanted
at
that
stage
*NL*
of
the
campaign
.
It
would
be
difficult
and
even
impossible
to
imagine
*NL*
any
result
more
opportune
than
the
actual
outcome
of
this
battle
.
With
a
*NL*
minimum
of
effort
and
insignificant
losses
,
despite
the
greatest
*NL*
confusion
,
the
most
important
results
of
the
whole
campaign
were
*NL*
attained
:
the
transition
from
retreat
to
advance
,
an
exposure
of
the
*NL*
weakness
of
the
French
,
and
the
administration
of
that
shock
which
*NL*
Napoleon
's
army
had
only
awaited
to
begin
its
flight
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
enters
Moscow
after
the
brilliant
victory
de
la
Moskowa
;
there
*NL*
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
victory
for
the
battlefield
remains
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
French
.
The
Russians
retreat
and
abandon
their
ancient
*NL*
capital
.
Moscow
,
abounding
in
provisions
,
arms
,
munitions
,
and
*NL*
incalculable
wealth
,
is
in
Napoleon
's
hands
.
The
Russian
army
,
only
half
*NL*
the
strength
of
the
French
,
does
not
make
a
single
attempt
to
attack
for
*NL*
a
whole
month
.
Napoleon
's
position
is
most
brilliant
.
He
can
either
fall
*NL*
on
the
Russian
army
with
double
its
strength
and
destroy
it
;
negotiate
*NL*
an
advantageous
peace
,
or
in
case
of
a
refusal
make
a
menacing
move
on
*NL*
Petersburg
,
or
even
,
in
the
case
of
a
reverse
,
return
to
Smolensk
or
*NL*
Vilna
;
or
remain
in
Moscow
;
in
short
,
no
special
genius
would
seem
to
be
*NL*
required
to
retain
the
brilliant
position
the
French
held
at
that
time
.
*NL*
For
that
,
only
very
simple
and
easy
steps
were
necessary
:
not
to
allow
*NL*
the
troops
to
loot
,
to
prepare
winter
clothing
--
of
which
there
was
*NL*
sufficient
in
Moscow
for
the
whole
army
--
and
methodically
to
collect
the
*NL*
provisions
,
of
which
-LRB-
according
to
the
French
historians
-RRB-
there
were
*NL*
enough
in
Moscow
to
supply
the
whole
army
for
six
months
.
Yet
Napoleon
,
*NL*
that
greatest
of
all
geniuses
,
who
the
historians
declare
had
control
of
*NL*
the
army
,
took
none
of
these
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
not
merely
did
nothing
of
the
kind
,
but
on
the
contrary
he
used
his
*NL*
power
to
select
the
most
foolish
and
ruinous
of
all
the
courses
open
to
*NL*
him
.
Of
all
that
Napoleon
might
have
done
:
wintering
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
advancing
on
Petersburg
or
on
Nizhni-Novgorod
,
or
retiring
by
a
more
*NL*
northerly
or
more
southerly
route
-LRB-
say
by
the
road
Kutuzov
afterwards
*NL*
took
-RRB-
,
nothing
more
stupid
or
disastrous
can
be
imagined
than
what
he
*NL*
actually
did
.
He
remained
in
Moscow
till
October
,
letting
the
troops
*NL*
plunder
the
city
;
then
,
hesitating
whether
to
leave
a
garrison
behind
*NL*
him
,
he
quitted
Moscow
,
approached
Kutuzov
without
joining
battle
,
*NL*
turned
to
the
right
and
reached
Malo-Yaroslavets
,
again
without
*NL*
attempting
to
break
through
and
take
the
road
Kutuzov
took
,
but
retiring
*NL*
instead
to
Mozhaysk
along
the
devastated
Smolensk
road
.
Nothing
more
*NL*
stupid
than
that
could
have
been
devised
,
or
more
disastrous
for
the
*NL*
army
,
as
the
sequel
showed
.
Had
Napoleon
's
aim
been
to
destroy
his
army
,
*NL*
the
most
skillful
strategist
could
hardly
have
devised
any
series
of
*NL*
actions
that
would
so
completely
have
accomplished
that
purpose
,
*NL*
independently
of
anything
the
Russian
army
might
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
the
man
of
genius
,
did
this
!
But
to
say
that
he
destroyed
his
*NL*
army
because
he
wished
to
,
or
because
he
was
very
stupid
,
would
be
as
*NL*
unjust
as
to
say
that
he
had
brought
his
troops
to
Moscow
because
he
*NL*
wished
to
and
because
he
was
very
clever
and
a
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
both
cases
his
personal
activity
,
having
no
more
force
than
the
*NL*
personal
activity
of
any
soldier
,
merely
coincided
with
the
laws
that
*NL*
guided
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
quite
falsely
represent
Napoleon
's
faculties
as
having
*NL*
weakened
in
Moscow
,
and
do
so
only
because
the
results
did
not
justify
*NL*
his
actions
.
He
employed
all
his
ability
and
strength
to
do
the
best
he
*NL*
could
for
himself
and
his
army
,
as
he
had
done
previously
and
as
he
did
*NL*
subsequently
in
1813
.
His
activity
at
that
time
was
no
less
astounding
*NL*
than
it
was
in
Egypt
,
in
Italy
,
in
Austria
,
and
in
Prussia
.
We
do
not
*NL*
know
for
certain
in
how
far
his
genius
was
genuine
in
Egypt
--
where
forty
*NL*
centuries
looked
down
upon
his
grandeur
--
for
his
great
exploits
there
*NL*
are
all
told
us
by
Frenchmen
.
We
can
not
accurately
estimate
his
genius
*NL*
in
Austria
or
Prussia
,
for
we
have
to
draw
our
information
from
French
*NL*
or
German
sources
,
and
the
incomprehensible
surrender
of
whole
corps
*NL*
without
fighting
and
of
fortresses
without
a
siege
must
incline
Germans
*NL*
to
recognize
his
genius
as
the
only
explanation
of
the
war
carried
on
in
*NL*
Germany
.
But
we
,
thank
God
,
have
no
need
to
recognize
his
genius
in
*NL*
order
to
hide
our
shame
.
We
have
paid
for
the
right
to
look
at
the
*NL*
matter
plainly
and
simply
,
and
we
will
not
abandon
that
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
activity
in
Moscow
was
as
amazing
and
as
full
of
genius
as
*NL*
elsewhere
.
Order
after
order
and
plan
after
plan
were
issued
by
him
from
*NL*
the
time
he
entered
Moscow
till
the
time
he
left
it
.
The
absence
of
*NL*
citizens
and
of
a
deputation
,
and
even
the
burning
of
Moscow
,
did
not
*NL*
disconcert
him
.
He
did
not
lose
sight
either
of
the
welfare
of
his
army
*NL*
or
of
the
doings
of
the
enemy
,
or
of
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
*NL*
Russia
,
or
of
the
direction
of
affairs
in
Paris
,
or
of
diplomatic
*NL*
considerations
concerning
the
terms
of
the
anticipated
peace
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
military
matters
,
Napoleon
immediately
on
his
entry
into
*NL*
Moscow
gave
General
Sabastiani
strict
orders
to
observe
the
movements
of
*NL*
the
Russian
army
,
sent
army
corps
out
along
the
different
roads
,
and
*NL*
charged
Murat
to
find
Kutuzov
.
Then
he
gave
careful
directions
about
the
*NL*
fortification
of
the
Kremlin
,
and
drew
up
a
brilliant
plan
for
a
future
*NL*
campaign
over
the
whole
map
of
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
diplomatic
questions
,
Napoleon
summoned
Captain
Yakovlev
,
*NL*
who
had
been
robbed
and
was
in
rags
and
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
*NL*
Moscow
,
minutely
explained
to
him
his
whole
policy
and
his
magnanimity
,
*NL*
and
having
written
a
letter
to
the
Emperor
Alexander
in
which
he
*NL*
considered
it
his
duty
to
inform
his
Friend
and
Brother
that
Rostopchin
*NL*
had
managed
affairs
badly
in
Moscow
,
he
dispatched
Yakovlev
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
similarly
explained
his
views
and
his
magnanimity
to
Tutolmin
,
he
*NL*
dispatched
that
old
man
also
to
Petersburg
to
negotiate
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
legal
matters
,
immediately
after
the
fires
he
gave
orders
*NL*
to
find
and
execute
the
incendiaries
.
And
the
scoundrel
Rostopchin
was
*NL*
punished
by
an
order
to
burn
down
his
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
administrative
matters
,
Moscow
was
granted
a
*NL*
constitution
.
A
municipality
was
established
and
the
following
*NL*
announcement
issued
:
*NL*
*NL*
INHABITANTS
OF
MOSCOW
!
*NL*
*NL*
Your
misfortunes
are
cruel
,
but
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
King
desires
*NL*
to
arrest
their
course
.
Terrible
examples
have
taught
you
how
he
*NL*
punishes
disobedience
and
crime
.
Strict
measures
have
been
taken
to
put
*NL*
an
end
to
disorder
and
to
re-establish
public
security
.
A
paternal
*NL*
administration
,
chosen
from
among
yourselves
,
will
form
your
*NL*
municipality
or
city
government
.
It
will
take
care
of
you
,
of
your
*NL*
needs
,
and
of
your
welfare
.
Its
members
will
be
distinguished
by
a
red
*NL*
ribbon
worn
across
the
shoulder
,
and
the
mayor
of
the
city
will
wear
a
*NL*
white
belt
as
well
.
But
when
not
on
duty
they
will
only
wear
a
red
*NL*
ribbon
round
the
left
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
city
police
is
established
on
its
former
footing
,
and
better
order
*NL*
already
prevails
in
consequence
of
its
activity
.
The
government
has
*NL*
appointed
two
commissaries
general
,
or
chiefs
of
police
,
and
twenty
*NL*
commissaries
or
captains
of
wards
have
been
appointed
to
the
different
*NL*
wards
of
the
city
.
You
will
recognize
them
by
the
white
ribbon
they
will
*NL*
wear
on
the
left
arm
.
Several
churches
of
different
denominations
are
*NL*
open
,
and
divine
service
is
performed
in
them
unhindered
.
Your
fellow
*NL*
citizens
are
returning
every
day
to
their
homes
and
orders
have
been
*NL*
given
that
they
should
find
in
them
the
help
and
protection
due
to
their
*NL*
misfortunes
.
These
are
the
measures
the
government
has
adopted
to
re
-
*NL*
establish
order
and
relieve
your
condition
.
But
to
achieve
this
aim
it
*NL*
is
necessary
that
you
should
add
your
efforts
and
should
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
forget
the
misfortunes
you
have
suffered
,
should
entertain
the
hope
of
a
*NL*
less
cruel
fate
,
should
be
certain
that
inevitable
and
ignominious
death
*NL*
awaits
those
who
make
any
attempt
on
your
persons
or
on
what
remains
of
*NL*
your
property
,
and
finally
that
you
should
not
doubt
that
these
will
be
*NL*
safeguarded
,
since
such
is
the
will
of
the
greatest
and
most
just
of
*NL*
monarchs
.
Soldiers
and
citizens
,
of
whatever
nation
you
may
be
,
re
-
*NL*
establish
public
confidence
,
the
source
of
the
welfare
of
a
state
,
live
*NL*
like
brothers
,
render
mutual
aid
and
protection
one
to
another
,
unite
to
*NL*
defeat
the
intentions
of
the
evil-minded
,
obey
the
military
and
civil
*NL*
authorities
,
and
your
tears
will
soon
cease
to
flow
!
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
supplies
for
the
army
,
Napoleon
decreed
that
all
the
*NL*
troops
in
turn
should
enter
Moscow
a
la
maraude
*
to
obtain
provisions
*NL*
for
themselves
,
so
that
the
army
might
have
its
future
provided
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
As
looters
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
religion
,
Napoleon
ordered
the
priests
to
be
brought
back
*NL*
and
services
to
be
again
performed
in
the
churches
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
commerce
and
to
provisioning
the
army
,
the
following
was
*NL*
placarded
everywhere
:
*NL*
*NL*
PROCLAMATION
!
*NL*
*NL*
You
,
peaceful
inhabitants
of
Moscow
,
artisans
and
workmen
whom
*NL*
misfortune
has
driven
from
the
city
,
and
you
scattered
tillers
of
the
*NL*
soil
,
still
kept
out
in
the
fields
by
groundless
fear
,
listen
!
*NL*
Tranquillity
is
returning
to
this
capital
and
order
is
being
restored
in
*NL*
it
.
Your
fellow
countrymen
are
emerging
boldly
from
their
hiding
places
*NL*
on
finding
that
they
are
respected
.
Any
violence
to
them
or
to
their
*NL*
property
is
promptly
punished
.
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
King
protects
*NL*
them
,
and
considers
no
one
among
you
his
enemy
except
those
who
disobey
*NL*
his
orders
.
He
desires
to
end
your
misfortunes
and
restore
you
to
your
*NL*
homes
and
families
.
Respond
,
therefore
,
to
his
benevolent
intentions
and
*NL*
come
to
us
without
fear
.
Inhabitants
,
return
with
confidence
to
your
*NL*
abodes
!
You
will
soon
find
means
of
satisfying
your
needs
.
Craftsmen
and
*NL*
industrious
artisans
,
return
to
your
work
,
your
houses
,
your
shops
,
*NL*
where
the
protection
of
guards
awaits
you
!
You
shall
receive
proper
pay
*NL*
for
your
work
.
And
lastly
you
too
,
peasants
,
come
from
the
forests
where
*NL*
you
are
hiding
in
terror
,
return
to
your
huts
without
fear
,
in
full
*NL*
assurance
that
you
will
find
protection
!
Markets
are
established
in
the
*NL*
city
where
peasants
can
bring
their
surplus
supplies
and
the
products
of
*NL*
the
soil
.
The
government
has
taken
the
following
steps
to
ensure
freedom
*NL*
of
sale
for
them
:
-LRB-

-RRB-
From
today
,
peasants
,
husbandmen
,
and
those
living
*NL*
in
the
neighborhood
of
Moscow
may
without
any
danger
bring
their
*NL*
supplies
of
all
kinds
to
two
appointed
markets
,
of
which
one
is
on
the
*NL*
Mokhovaya
Street
and
the
other
at
the
Provision
Market
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
Such
*NL*
supplies
will
be
bought
from
them
at
such
prices
as
seller
and
buyer
may
*NL*
agree
on
,
and
if
a
seller
is
unable
to
obtain
a
fair
price
he
will
be
*NL*
free
to
take
his
goods
back
to
his
village
and
no
one
may
hinder
him
*NL*
under
any
pretense
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
Sunday
and
Wednesday
of
each
week
are
appointed
*NL*
as
the
chief
market
days
and
to
that
end
a
sufficient
number
of
troops
*NL*
will
be
stationed
along
the
highroads
on
Tuesdays
and
Saturdays
at
such
*NL*
distances
from
the
town
as
to
protect
the
carts
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
Similar
measures
*NL*
will
be
taken
that
peasants
with
their
carts
and
horses
may
meet
with
no
*NL*
hindrance
on
their
return
journey
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
Steps
will
immediately
be
taken
*NL*
to
re-establish
ordinary
trading
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inhabitants
of
the
city
and
villages
,
and
you
,
workingmen
and
artisans
,
*NL*
to
whatever
nation
you
belong
,
you
are
called
on
to
carry
out
the
*NL*
paternal
intentions
of
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
and
King
and
to
co
-
*NL*
operate
with
him
for
the
public
welfare
!
Lay
your
respect
and
confidence
*NL*
at
his
feet
and
do
not
delay
to
unite
with
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
object
of
raising
the
spirits
of
the
troops
and
of
the
people
,
*NL*
reviews
were
constantly
held
and
rewards
distributed
.
The
Emperor
rode
*NL*
through
the
streets
to
comfort
the
inhabitants
,
and
,
despite
his
*NL*
preoccupation
with
state
affairs
,
himself
visited
the
theaters
that
were
*NL*
established
by
his
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
regard
to
philanthropy
,
the
greatest
virtue
of
crowned
heads
,
*NL*
Napoleon
also
did
all
in
his
power
.
He
caused
the
words
Maison
de
ma
*NL*
Mere
to
be
inscribed
on
the
charitable
institutions
,
thereby
combining
*NL*
tender
filial
affection
with
the
majestic
benevolence
of
a
monarch
.
He
*NL*
visited
the
Foundling
Hospital
and
,
allowing
the
orphans
saved
by
him
to
*NL*
kiss
his
white
hands
,
graciously
conversed
with
Tutolmin
.
Then
,
as
*NL*
Thiers
eloquently
recounts
,
he
ordered
his
soldiers
to
be
paid
in
forged
*NL*
Russian
money
which
he
had
prepared
:
``
Raising
the
use
of
these
means
by
*NL*
an
act
worthy
of
himself
and
of
the
French
army
,
he
let
relief
be
*NL*
distributed
to
those
who
had
been
burned
out
.
But
as
food
was
too
*NL*
precious
to
be
given
to
foreigners
,
who
were
for
the
most
part
enemies
,
*NL*
Napoleon
preferred
to
supply
them
with
money
with
which
to
purchase
food
*NL*
from
outside
,
and
had
paper
rubles
distributed
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
reference
to
army
discipline
,
orders
were
continually
being
issued
*NL*
to
inflict
severe
punishment
for
the
nonperformance
of
military
duties
*NL*
and
to
suppress
robbery
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
But
strange
to
say
,
all
these
measures
,
efforts
,
and
plans
--
which
were
*NL*
not
at
all
worse
than
others
issued
in
similar
circumstances
--
did
not
*NL*
affect
the
essence
of
the
matter
but
,
like
the
hands
of
a
clock
detached
*NL*
from
the
mechanism
,
swung
about
in
an
arbitrary
and
aimless
way
without
*NL*
engaging
the
cogwheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
reference
to
the
military
side
--
the
plan
of
campaign
--
that
work
of
*NL*
genius
of
which
Thiers
remarks
that
,
``
His
genius
never
devised
anything
*NL*
more
profound
,
more
skillful
,
or
more
admirable
,
''
and
enters
into
a
*NL*
polemic
with
M.
Fain
to
prove
that
this
work
of
genius
must
be
referred
*NL*
not
to
the
fourth
but
to
the
fifteenth
of
October
--
that
plan
never
was
*NL*
or
could
be
executed
,
for
it
was
quite
out
of
touch
with
the
facts
of
*NL*
the
case
.
The
fortifying
of
the
Kremlin
,
for
which
la
Mosquee
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Napoleon
termed
the
church
of
Basil
the
Beatified
-RRB-
was
to
have
been
*NL*
razed
to
the
ground
,
proved
quite
useless
.
The
mining
of
the
Kremlin
*NL*
only
helped
toward
fulfilling
Napoleon
's
wish
that
it
should
be
blown
up
*NL*
when
he
left
Moscow
--
as
a
child
wants
the
floor
on
which
he
has
hurt
*NL*
himself
to
be
beaten
.
The
pursuit
of
the
Russian
army
,
about
which
*NL*
Napoleon
was
so
concerned
,
produced
an
unheard-of
result
.
The
French
*NL*
generals
lost
touch
with
the
Russian
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
,
and
*NL*
according
to
Thiers
it
was
only
eventually
found
,
like
a
lost
pin
,
by
*NL*
the
skill
--
and
apparently
the
genius
--
of
Murat
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
reference
to
diplomacy
,
all
Napoleon
's
arguments
as
to
his
*NL*
magnanimity
and
justice
,
both
to
Tutolmin
and
to
Yakovlev
-LRB-
whose
chief
*NL*
concern
was
to
obtain
a
greatcoat
and
a
conveyance
-RRB-
,
proved
useless
;
*NL*
Alexander
did
not
receive
these
envoys
and
did
not
reply
to
their
*NL*
embassage
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
legal
matters
,
after
the
execution
of
the
supposed
*NL*
incendiaries
the
rest
of
Moscow
burned
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
administrative
matters
,
the
establishment
of
a
*NL*
municipality
did
not
stop
the
robberies
and
was
only
of
use
to
certain
*NL*
people
who
formed
part
of
that
municipality
and
under
pretext
of
*NL*
preserving
order
looted
Moscow
or
saved
their
own
property
from
being
*NL*
looted
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
religion
,
as
to
which
in
Egypt
matters
had
so
easily
been
*NL*
settled
by
Napoleon
's
visit
to
a
mosque
,
no
results
were
achieved
.
Two
*NL*
or
three
priests
who
were
found
in
Moscow
did
try
to
carry
out
*NL*
Napoleon
's
wish
,
but
one
of
them
was
slapped
in
the
face
by
a
French
*NL*
soldier
while
conducting
service
,
and
a
French
official
reported
of
*NL*
another
that
:
``
The
priest
whom
I
found
and
invited
to
say
Mass
cleaned
*NL*
and
locked
up
the
church
.
That
night
the
doors
were
again
broken
open
,
*NL*
the
padlocks
smashed
,
the
books
mutilated
,
and
other
disorders
*NL*
perpetrated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
reference
to
commerce
,
the
proclamation
to
industrious
workmen
and
*NL*
to
peasants
evoked
no
response
.
There
were
no
industrious
workmen
,
and
*NL*
the
peasants
caught
the
commissaries
who
ventured
too
far
out
of
town
*NL*
with
the
proclamation
and
killed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
theaters
for
the
entertainment
of
the
people
and
the
troops
,
*NL*
these
did
not
meet
with
success
either
.
The
theaters
set
up
in
the
*NL*
Kremlin
and
in
Posnyakov
's
house
were
closed
again
at
once
because
the
*NL*
actors
and
actresses
were
robbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
philanthropy
did
not
have
the
desired
effect
.
The
genuine
as
well
*NL*
as
the
false
paper
money
which
flooded
Moscow
lost
its
value
.
The
*NL*
French
,
collecting
booty
,
cared
only
for
gold
.
Not
only
was
the
paper
*NL*
money
valueless
which
Napoleon
so
graciously
distributed
to
the
*NL*
unfortunate
,
but
even
silver
lost
its
value
in
relation
to
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
most
amazing
example
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
orders
given
*NL*
by
the
authorities
at
that
time
was
Napoleon
's
attempt
to
stop
the
*NL*
looting
and
re-establish
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
the
army
authorities
were
reporting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looting
continues
in
the
city
despite
the
decrees
against
it
.
Order
is
*NL*
not
yet
restored
and
not
a
single
merchant
is
carrying
on
trade
in
a
*NL*
lawful
manner
.
The
sutlers
alone
venture
to
trade
,
and
they
sell
stolen
*NL*
goods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
neighborhood
of
my
ward
continues
to
be
pillaged
by
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
3rd
Corps
who
,
not
satisfied
with
taking
from
the
unfortunate
*NL*
inhabitants
hiding
in
the
cellars
the
little
they
have
left
,
even
have
*NL*
the
ferocity
to
wound
them
with
their
sabers
,
as
I
have
repeatedly
*NL*
witnessed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
new

except
that
the
soldiers
are
robbing
and
pillaging

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Robbery
and
pillaging
continue

There
is
a
band
of
thieves

district

strong
force

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
is
extremely
displeased
that
despite
the
strict
orders
to
*NL*
stop
pillage
,
parties
of
marauding
Guards
are
continually
seen
returning
*NL*
to
the
Kremlin

Among
the
Old
Guard
disorder
and
pillage
were
renewed
*NL*
more
violently
than
ever
yesterday
evening
,
last
night
,
and
today
.
The
*NL*
Emperor
sees
with
regret
that
the
picked
soldiers
appointed
to
guard
his
*NL*
person
,
who
should
set
an
example

carry
disobedience
to

such
a
point
that
they
break
into

Others
have
disgraced
themselves
to
the
extent
of
disobeying

have
abused

beaten

*NL*
``
The
Grand
Marshal
of

palace

''
wrote
the
governor
,
``

bitterly
that
in
spite
of
repeated
orders
,
the
soldiers
continue
to
*NL*
commit
nuisances
in
all
the
courtyards
and
even
under
the
very
windows
*NL*
of
the
Emperor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
army
,
like
a
herd
of
cattle
run
wild
and
trampling
underfoot
the
*NL*
provender
which
might
have
saved
it
from
starvation
,
disintegrated
and
*NL*
perished
with
each
additional
day
it
remained
in
Moscow
.
But
it
did
not
*NL*
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
to
run
away
only
when
suddenly
seized
by
a
panic
caused
by
the
*NL*
capture
of
transport
trains
on
the
Smolensk
road
,
and
by
the
battle
of
*NL*
Tarutino
.
The
news
of
that
battle
of
Tarutino
,
unexpectedly
received
by
*NL*
Napoleon
at
a
review
,
evoked
in
him
a
desire
to
punish
the
Russians
*NL*
-LRB-
Thiers
says
-RRB-
,
and
he
issued
the
order
for
departure
which
the
whole
*NL*
army
was
demanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleeing
from
Moscow
the
soldiers
took
with
them
everything
they
had
*NL*
stolen
.
Napoleon
,
too
,
carried
away
his
own
personal
tresor
,
but
on
*NL*
seeing
the
baggage
trains
that
impeded
the
army
,
he
was
-LRB-
Thiers
says
-RRB-
*NL*
horror-struck
.
And
yet
with
his
experience
of
war
he
did
not
order
all
*NL*
the
superfluous
vehicles
to
be
burned
,
as
he
had
done
with
those
of
a
*NL*
certain
marshal
when
approaching
Moscow
.
He
gazed
at
the
caleches
and
*NL*
carriages
in
which
soldiers
were
riding
and
remarked
that
it
was
a
very
*NL*
good
thing
,
as
those
vehicles
could
be
used
to
carry
provisions
,
the
*NL*
sick
,
and
the
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plight
of
the
whole
army
resembled
that
of
a
wounded
animal
which
*NL*
feels
it
is
perishing
and
does
not
know
what
it
is
doing
.
To
study
the
*NL*
skillful
tactics
and
aims
of
Napoleon
and
his
army
from
the
time
it
*NL*
entered
Moscow
till
it
was
destroyed
is
like
studying
the
dying
leaps
*NL*
and
shudders
of
a
mortally
wounded
animal
.
Very
often
a
wounded
animal
,
*NL*
hearing
a
rustle
,
rushes
straight
at
the
hunter
's
gun
,
runs
forward
and
*NL*
back
again
,
and
hastens
its
own
end
.
Napoleon
,
under
pressure
from
his
*NL*
whole
army
,
did
the
same
thing
.
The
rustle
of
the
battle
of
Tarutino
*NL*
frightened
the
beast
,
and
it
rushed
forward
onto
the
hunter
's
gun
,
*NL*
reached
him
,
turned
back
,
and
finally
--
like
any
wild
beast
--
ran
back
*NL*
along
the
most
disadvantageous
and
dangerous
path
,
where
the
old
scent
*NL*
was
familiar
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
that
period
Napoleon
,
who
seems
to
us
to
have
been
*NL*
the
leader
of
all
these
movements
--
as
the
figurehead
of
a
ship
may
seem
*NL*
to
a
savage
to
guide
the
vessel
--
acted
like
a
child
who
,
holding
a
*NL*
couple
of
strings
inside
a
carriage
,
thinks
he
is
driving
it
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
of
the
sixth
of
October
Pierre
went
out
of
the
*NL*
shed
,
and
on
returning
stopped
by
the
door
to
play
with
a
little
blue
-
*NL*
gray
dog
,
with
a
long
body
and
short
bandy
legs
,
that
jumped
about
him
.
*NL*
This
little
dog
lived
in
their
shed
,
sleeping
beside
Karataev
at
night
;
*NL*
it
sometimes
made
excursions
into
the
town
but
always
returned
again
.
*NL*
Probably
it
had
never
had
an
owner
,
and
it
still
belonged
to
nobody
and
*NL*
had
no
name
.
The
French
called
it
Azor
;
the
soldier
who
told
stories
*NL*
called
it
Femgalka
;
Karataev
and
others
called
it
Gray
,
or
sometimes
*NL*
Flabby
.
Its
lack
of
a
master
,
a
name
,
or
even
of
a
breed
or
any
definite
*NL*
color
did
not
seem
to
trouble
the
blue-gray
dog
in
the
least
.
Its
furry
*NL*
tail
stood
up
firm
and
round
as
a
plume
,
its
bandy
legs
served
it
so
*NL*
well
that
it
would
often
gracefully
lift
a
hind
leg
and
run
very
easily
*NL*
and
quickly
on
three
legs
,
as
if
disdaining
to
use
all
four
.
Everything
*NL*
pleased
it
.
Now
it
would
roll
on
its
back
,
yelping
with
delight
,
now
*NL*
bask
in
the
sun
with
a
thoughtful
air
of
importance
,
and
now
frolic
*NL*
about
playing
with
a
chip
of
wood
or
a
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
attire
by
now
consisted
of
a
dirty
torn
shirt
-LRB-
the
only
remnant
*NL*
of
his
former
clothing
-RRB-
,
a
pair
of
soldier
's
trousers
which
by
*NL*
Karataev
's
advice
he
tied
with
string
round
the
ankles
for
warmth
,
and
a
*NL*
peasant
coat
and
cap
.
Physically
he
had
changed
much
during
this
time
.
*NL*
He
no
longer
seemed
stout
,
though
he
still
had
the
appearance
of
*NL*
solidity
and
strength
hereditary
in
his
family
.
A
beard
and
mustache
*NL*
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
and
a
tangle
of
hair
,
infested
with
*NL*
lice
,
curled
round
his
head
like
a
cap
.
The
look
of
his
eyes
was
*NL*
resolute
,
calm
,
and
animatedly
alert
,
as
never
before
.
The
former
*NL*
slackness
which
had
shown
itself
even
in
his
eyes
was
now
replaced
by
an
*NL*
energetic
readiness
for
action
and
resistance
.
His
feet
were
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
first
looked
down
the
field
across
which
vehicles
and
horsemen
*NL*
were
passing
that
morning
,
then
into
the
distance
across
the
river
,
then
*NL*
at
the
dog
who
was
pretending
to
be
in
earnest
about
biting
him
,
and
*NL*
then
at
his
bare
feet
which
he
placed
with
pleasure
in
various
*NL*
positions
,
moving
his
dirty
thick
big
toes
.
Every
time
he
looked
at
his
*NL*
bare
feet
a
smile
of
animated
self-satisfaction
flitted
across
his
face
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
them
reminded
him
of
all
he
had
experienced
and
learned
*NL*
during
these
weeks
and
this
recollection
was
pleasant
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
days
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
clear
with
slight
frosts
in
*NL*
the
mornings
--
what
is
called
an
``
old
wives
'
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
sunshine
the
air
was
warm
,
and
that
warmth
was
particularly
*NL*
pleasant
with
the
invigorating
freshness
of
the
morning
frost
still
in
*NL*
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
everything
--
far
and
near
--
lay
the
magic
crystal
glitter
seen
only
at
*NL*
that
time
of
autumn
.
The
Sparrow
Hills
were
visible
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
with
the
village
,
the
church
,
and
the
large
white
house
.
The
bare
trees
,
*NL*
the
sand
,
the
bricks
and
roofs
of
the
houses
,
the
green
church
spire
,
*NL*
and
the
corners
of
the
white
house
in
the
distance
,
all
stood
out
in
the
*NL*
transparent
air
in
most
delicate
outline
and
with
unnatural
clearness
.
*NL*
Near
by
could
be
seen
the
familiar
ruins
of
a
half-burned
mansion
*NL*
occupied
by
the
French
,
with
lilac
bushes
still
showing
dark
green
*NL*
beside
the
fence
.
And
even
that
ruined
and
befouled
house
--
which
in
dull
*NL*
weather
was
repulsively
ugly
--
seemed
quietly
beautiful
now
,
in
the
*NL*
clear
,
motionless
brilliance
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
French
corporal
,
with
coat
unbuttoned
in
a
homely
way
,
a
skullcap
on
*NL*
his
head
,
and
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
came
from
behind
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
shed
and
approached
Pierre
with
a
friendly
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sunshine
,
Monsieur
Kiril
!
''
-LRB-
Their
name
for
Pierre
.
-RRB-
``
Eh
?
Just
like
*NL*
spring
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
corporal
leaned
against
the
door
and
offered
Pierre
his
pipe
,
*NL*
though
whenever
he
offered
it
Pierre
always
declined
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
on
the
march
in
such
weather
...
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
inquired
what
was
being
said
about
leaving
,
and
the
corporal
told
*NL*
him
that
nearly
all
the
troops
were
starting
and
there
ought
to
be
an
*NL*
order
about
the
prisoners
that
day
.
Sokolov
,
one
of
the
soldiers
in
the
*NL*
shed
with
Pierre
,
was
dying
,
and
Pierre
told
the
corporal
that
something
*NL*
should
be
done
about
him
.
The
corporal
replied
that
Pierre
need
not
*NL*
worry
about
that
as
they
had
an
ambulance
and
a
permanent
hospital
and
*NL*
arrangements
would
be
made
for
the
sick
,
and
that
in
general
everything
*NL*
that
could
happen
had
been
foreseen
by
the
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
Monsieur
Kiril
,
you
have
only
to
say
a
word
to
the
captain
,
*NL*
you
know
.
He
is
a
man
who
never
forgets
anything
.
Speak
to
the
captain
*NL*
when
he
makes
his
round
,
he
will
do
anything
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
The
captain
of
whom
the
corporal
spoke
often
had
long
chats
with
Pierre
*NL*
and
showed
him
all
sorts
of
favors
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
see
,
St.
Thomas
,
'
he
said
to
me
the
other
day
.
`
Monsieur
Kiril
is
*NL*
a
man
of
education
,
who
speaks
French
.
He
is
a
Russian
seigneur
who
has
*NL*
had
misfortunes
,
but
he
is
a
man
.
He
knows
what
's
what
...
If
he
wants
*NL*
anything
and
asks
me
,
he
wo
n't
get
a
refusal
.
When
one
has
studied
,
you
*NL*
see
,
one
likes
education
and
well-bred
people
.
'
It
is
for
your
sake
I
*NL*
mention
it
,
Monsieur
Kiril
.
The
other
day
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
*NL*
that
affair
would
have
ended
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
chatting
a
while
longer
,
the
corporal
went
away
.
-LRB-
The
affair
*NL*
he
had
alluded
to
had
happened
a
few
days
before
--
a
fight
between
the
*NL*
prisoners
and
the
French
soldiers
,
in
which
Pierre
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
pacifying
his
comrades
.
-RRB-
Some
of
the
prisoners
who
had
heard
Pierre
*NL*
talking
to
the
corporal
immediately
asked
what
the
Frenchman
had
said
.
*NL*
While
Pierre
was
repeating
what
he
had
been
told
about
the
army
leaving
*NL*
Moscow
,
a
thin
,
sallow
,
tattered
French
soldier
came
up
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
shed
.
Rapidly
and
timidly
raising
his
fingers
to
his
forehead
by
way
*NL*
of
greeting
,
he
asked
Pierre
whether
the
soldier
Platoche
to
whom
he
had
*NL*
given
a
shirt
to
sew
was
in
that
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
before
the
French
had
had
boot
leather
and
linen
issued
to
them
,
*NL*
which
they
had
given
out
to
the
prisoners
to
make
up
into
boots
and
*NL*
shirts
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
,
ready
,
dear
fellow
!
''
said
Karataev
,
coming
out
with
a
neatly
*NL*
folded
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Karataev
,
on
account
of
the
warm
weather
and
for
convenience
at
work
,
*NL*
was
wearing
only
trousers
and
a
tattered
shirt
as
black
as
soot
.
His
*NL*
hair
was
bound
round
,
workman
fashion
,
with
a
wisp
of
lime-tree
bast
,
*NL*
and
his
round
face
seemed
rounder
and
pleasanter
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
promise
is
own
brother
to
performance
!
I
said
Friday
and
here
it
is
,
*NL*
ready
,
''
said
Platon
,
smiling
and
unfolding
the
shirt
he
had
sewn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
glanced
around
uneasily
and
then
,
as
if
overcoming
his
*NL*
hesitation
,
rapidly
threw
off
his
uniform
and
put
on
the
shirt
.
He
had
a
*NL*
long
,
greasy
,
flowered
silk
waistcoat
next
to
his
sallow
,
thin
bare
*NL*
body
,
but
no
shirt
.
He
was
evidently
afraid
the
prisoners
looking
on
*NL*
would
laugh
at
him
,
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
shirt
hurriedly
.
None
*NL*
of
the
prisoners
said
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
it
fits
well
!
''
Platon
kept
repeating
,
pulling
the
shirt
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
,
having
pushed
his
head
and
hands
through
,
without
raising
*NL*
his
eyes
,
looked
down
at
the
shirt
and
examined
the
seams
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
dear
man
,
this
is
not
a
sewing
shop
,
and
I
had
no
proper
*NL*
tools
;
and
,
as
they
say
,
one
needs
a
tool
even
to
kill
a
louse
,
''
said
*NL*
Platon
with
one
of
his
round
smiles
,
obviously
pleased
with
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
good
,
quite
good
,
thank
you
,
''
said
the
Frenchman
,
in
French
,
``
but
*NL*
there
must
be
some
linen
left
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
fit
better
still
when
it
sets
to
your
body
,
''
said
Karataev
,
*NL*
still
admiring
his
handiwork
.
``
You
'll
be
nice
and
comfortable
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
thanks
,
old
fellow
...
But
the
bits
left
over
?
''
said
the
*NL*
Frenchman
again
and
smiled
.
He
took
out
an
assignation
ruble
note
and
*NL*
gave
it
to
Karataev
.
``
But
give
me
the
pieces
that
are
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
saw
that
Platon
did
not
want
to
understand
what
the
Frenchman
was
*NL*
saying
,
and
he
looked
on
without
interfering
.
Karataev
thanked
the
*NL*
Frenchman
for
the
money
and
went
on
admiring
his
own
work
.
The
Frenchman
*NL*
insisted
on
having
the
pieces
returned
that
were
left
over
and
asked
*NL*
Pierre
to
translate
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
want
the
bits
for
?
''
said
Karataev
.
``
They
'd
make
fine
leg
*NL*
bands
for
us
.
Well
,
never
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Karataev
,
with
a
suddenly
changed
and
saddened
expression
,
took
a
*NL*
small
bundle
of
scraps
from
inside
his
shirt
and
gave
it
to
the
*NL*
Frenchman
without
looking
at
him
.
``
Oh
dear
!
''
muttered
Karataev
and
went
*NL*
away
.
The
Frenchman
looked
at
the
linen
,
considered
for
a
moment
,
then
*NL*
looked
inquiringly
at
Pierre
and
,
as
if
Pierre
's
look
had
told
him
*NL*
something
,
suddenly
blushed
and
shouted
in
a
squeaky
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Platoche
!
Eh
,
Platoche
!
Keep
them
yourself
!
''
And
handing
back
the
odd
*NL*
bits
he
turned
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
look
at
that
,
''
said
Karataev
,
swaying
his
head
.
``
People
said
*NL*
they
were
not
Christians
,
but
they
too
have
souls
.
It
's
what
the
old
*NL*
folk
used
to
say
:
'
A
sweating
hand
's
an
open
hand
,
a
dry
hand
's
close
.
'
*NL*
He
's
naked
,
but
yet
he
's
given
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Karataev
smiled
thoughtfully
and
was
silent
awhile
looking
at
the
*NL*
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
'll
make
grand
leg
bands
,
dear
friend
,
''
he
said
,
and
went
back
*NL*
into
the
shed
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Four
weeks
had
passed
since
Pierre
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
though
*NL*
the
French
had
offered
to
move
him
from
the
men
's
to
the
officers
'
shed
,
*NL*
he
had
stayed
in
the
shed
where
he
was
first
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
burned
and
devastated
Moscow
Pierre
experienced
almost
the
extreme
*NL*
limits
of
privation
a
man
can
endure
;
but
thanks
to
his
physical
*NL*
strength
and
health
,
of
which
he
had
till
then
been
unconscious
,
and
*NL*
thanks
especially
to
the
fact
that
the
privations
came
so
gradually
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
say
when
they
began
,
he
endured
his
position
not
*NL*
only
lightly
but
joyfully
.
And
just
at
this
time
he
obtained
the
*NL*
tranquillity
and
ease
of
mind
he
had
formerly
striven
in
vain
to
reach
.
*NL*
He
had
long
sought
in
different
ways
that
tranquillity
of
mind
,
that
*NL*
inner
harmony
which
had
so
impressed
him
in
the
soldiers
at
the
battle
*NL*
of
Borodino
.
He
had
sought
it
in
philanthropy
,
in
Freemasonry
,
in
the
*NL*
dissipations
of
town
life
,
in
wine
,
in
heroic
feats
of
self-sacrifice
,
*NL*
and
in
romantic
love
for
Natasha
;
he
had
sought
it
by
reasoning
--
and
all
*NL*
these
quests
and
experiments
had
failed
him
.
And
now
without
thinking
*NL*
about
it
he
had
found
that
peace
and
inner
harmony
only
through
the
*NL*
horror
of
death
,
through
privation
,
and
through
what
he
recognized
in
*NL*
Karataev
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
dreadful
moments
he
had
lived
through
at
the
executions
had
as
it
*NL*
were
forever
washed
away
from
his
imagination
and
memory
the
agitating
*NL*
thoughts
and
feelings
that
had
formerly
seemed
so
important
.
It
did
not
*NL*
now
occur
to
him
to
think
of
Russia
,
or
the
war
,
or
politics
,
or
*NL*
Napoleon
.
It
was
plain
to
him
that
all
these
things
were
no
business
of
*NL*
his
,
and
that
he
was
not
called
on
to
judge
concerning
them
and
*NL*
therefore
could
not
do
so
.
``
Russia
and
summer
weather
are
not
bound
*NL*
together
,
''
he
thought
,
repeating
words
of
Karataev
's
which
he
found
*NL*
strangely
consoling
.
His
intention
of
killing
Napoleon
and
his
*NL*
calculations
of
the
cabalistic
number
of
the
beast
of
the
Apocalypse
now
*NL*
seemed
to
him
meaningless
and
even
ridiculous
.
His
anger
with
his
wife
*NL*
and
anxiety
that
his
name
should
not
be
smirched
now
seemed
not
merely
*NL*
trivial
but
even
amusing
.
What
concern
was
it
of
his
that
somewhere
or
*NL*
other
that
woman
was
leading
the
life
she
preferred
?
What
did
it
matter
*NL*
to
anybody
,
and
especially
to
him
,
whether
or
not
they
found
out
that
*NL*
their
prisoner
's
name
was
Count
Bezukhov
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
often
remembered
his
conversation
with
Prince
Andrew
and
quite
*NL*
agreed
with
him
,
though
he
understood
Prince
Andrew
's
thoughts
somewhat
*NL*
differently
.
Prince
Andrew
had
thought
and
said
that
happiness
could
*NL*
only
be
negative
,
but
had
said
it
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
and
irony
*NL*
as
though
he
was
really
saying
that
all
desire
for
positive
happiness
is
*NL*
implanted
in
us
merely
to
torment
us
and
never
be
satisfied
.
But
Pierre
*NL*
believed
it
without
any
mental
reservation
.
The
absence
of
suffering
,
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
one
's
needs
and
consequent
freedom
in
the
choice
of
*NL*
one
's
occupation
,
that
is
,
of
one
's
way
of
life
,
now
seemed
to
Pierre
to
*NL*
be
indubitably
man
's
highest
happiness
.
Here
and
now
for
the
first
time
*NL*
he
fully
appreciated
the
enjoyment
of
eating
when
he
wanted
to
eat
,
*NL*
drinking
when
he
wanted
to
drink
,
sleeping
when
he
wanted
to
sleep
,
of
*NL*
warmth
when
he
was
cold
,
of
talking
to
a
fellow
man
when
he
wished
to
*NL*
talk
and
to
hear
a
human
voice
.
The
satisfaction
of
one
's
needs
--
good
*NL*
food
,
cleanliness
,
and
freedom
--
now
that
he
was
deprived
of
all
this
,
*NL*
seemed
to
Pierre
to
constitute
perfect
happiness
;
and
the
choice
of
*NL*
occupation
,
that
is
,
of
his
way
of
life
--
now
that
that
was
so
*NL*
restricted
--
seemed
to
him
such
an
easy
matter
that
he
forgot
that
a
*NL*
superfluity
of
the
comforts
of
life
destroys
all
joy
in
satisfying
one
's
*NL*
needs
,
while
great
freedom
in
the
choice
of
occupation
--
such
freedom
as
*NL*
his
wealth
,
his
education
,
and
his
social
position
had
given
him
in
his
*NL*
own
life
--
is
just
what
makes
the
choice
of
occupation
insolubly
*NL*
difficult
and
destroys
the
desire
and
possibility
of
having
an
*NL*
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Pierre
's
daydreams
now
turned
on
the
time
when
he
would
be
free
.
Yet
*NL*
subsequently
,
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
he
thought
and
spoke
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
of
that
month
of
captivity
,
of
those
irrecoverable
,
strong
,
*NL*
joyful
sensations
,
and
chiefly
of
the
complete
peace
of
mind
and
inner
*NL*
freedom
which
he
experienced
only
during
those
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
on
the
first
day
he
got
up
early
,
went
out
of
the
shed
at
dawn
,
and
*NL*
saw
the
cupolas
and
crosses
of
the
New
Convent
of
the
Virgin
still
dark
*NL*
at
first
,
the
hoarfrost
on
the
dusty
grass
,
the
Sparrow
Hills
,
and
the
*NL*
wooded
banks
above
the
winding
river
vanishing
in
the
purple
distance
,
*NL*
when
he
felt
the
contact
of
the
fresh
air
and
heard
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
crows
flying
from
Moscow
across
the
field
,
and
when
afterwards
light
*NL*
gleamed
from
the
east
and
the
sun
's
rim
appeared
solemnly
from
behind
a
*NL*
cloud
,
and
the
cupolas
and
crosses
,
the
hoarfrost
,
the
distance
and
the
*NL*
river
,
all
began
to
sparkle
in
the
glad
light
--
Pierre
felt
a
new
joy
and
*NL*
strength
in
life
such
as
he
had
never
before
known
.
And
this
not
only
*NL*
stayed
with
him
during
the
whole
of
his
imprisonment
,
but
even
grew
in
*NL*
strength
as
the
hardships
of
his
position
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
feeling
of
alertness
and
of
readiness
for
anything
was
still
*NL*
further
strengthened
in
him
by
the
high
opinion
his
fellow
prisoners
*NL*
formed
of
him
soon
after
his
arrival
at
the
shed
.
With
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
languages
,
the
respect
shown
him
by
the
French
,
his
simplicity
,
his
*NL*
readiness
to
give
anything
asked
of
him
-LRB-
he
received
the
allowance
of
*NL*
three
rubles
a
week
made
to
officers
-RRB-
;
with
his
strength
,
which
he
*NL*
showed
to
the
soldiers
by
pressing
nails
into
the
walls
of
the
hut
;
his
*NL*
gentleness
to
his
companions
,
and
his
capacity
for
sitting
still
and
*NL*
thinking
without
doing
anything
-LRB-
which
seemed
to
them
incomprehensible
-RRB-
,
*NL*
he
appeared
to
them
a
rather
mysterious
and
superior
being
.
The
very
*NL*
qualities
that
had
been
a
hindrance
,
if
not
actually
harmful
,
to
him
in
*NL*
the
world
he
had
lived
in
--
his
strength
,
his
disdain
for
the
comforts
of
*NL*
life
,
his
absent-mindedness
and
simplicity
--
here
among
these
people
gave
*NL*
him
almost
the
status
of
a
hero
.
And
Pierre
felt
that
their
opinion
*NL*
placed
responsibilities
upon
him
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
evacuation
began
on
the
night
between
the
sixth
and
seventh
*NL*
of
October
:
kitchens
and
sheds
were
dismantled
,
carts
loaded
,
and
troops
*NL*
and
baggage
trains
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
in
the
morning
a
French
convoy
in
marching
trim
,
wearing
shakos
*NL*
and
carrying
muskets
,
knapsacks
,
and
enormous
sacks
,
stood
in
front
of
*NL*
the
sheds
,
and
animated
French
talk
mingled
with
curses
sounded
all
*NL*
along
the
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
shed
everyone
was
ready
,
dressed
,
belted
,
shod
,
and
only
awaited
*NL*
the
order
to
start
.
The
sick
soldier
,
Sokolov
,
pale
and
thin
with
dark
*NL*
shadows
round
his
eyes
,
alone
sat
in
his
place
barefoot
and
not
dressed
.
*NL*
His
eyes
,
prominent
from
the
emaciation
of
his
face
,
gazed
inquiringly
*NL*
at
his
comrades
who
were
paying
no
attention
to
him
,
and
he
moaned
*NL*
regularly
and
quietly
.
It
was
evidently
not
so
much
his
sufferings
that
*NL*
caused
him
to
moan
-LRB-
he
had
dysentery
-RRB-
as
his
fear
and
grief
at
being
*NL*
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
girt
with
a
rope
round
his
waist
and
wearing
shoes
Karataev
had
*NL*
made
for
him
from
some
leather
a
French
soldier
had
torn
off
a
tea
chest
*NL*
and
brought
to
have
his
boots
mended
with
,
went
up
to
the
sick
man
and
*NL*
squatted
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Sokolov
,
they
are
not
all
going
away
!
They
have
a
hospital
*NL*
here
.
You
may
be
better
off
than
we
others
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
!
Oh
,
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
!
O
Lord
!
''
moaned
the
man
in
a
*NL*
louder
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
ask
them
again
directly
,
''
said
Pierre
,
rising
and
going
to
*NL*
the
door
of
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Pierre
reached
the
door
,
the
corporal
who
had
offered
him
a
pipe
*NL*
the
day
before
came
up
to
it
with
two
soldiers
.
The
corporal
and
*NL*
soldiers
were
in
marching
kit
with
knapsacks
and
shakos
that
had
metal
*NL*
straps
,
and
these
changed
their
familiar
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
came
,
according
to
orders
,
to
shut
the
door
.
The
prisoners
*NL*
had
to
be
counted
before
being
let
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Corporal
,
what
will
they
do
with
the
sick
man
?
...
''
Pierre
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
as
he
spoke
he
began
to
doubt
whether
this
was
the
corporal
he
*NL*
knew
or
a
stranger
,
so
unlike
himself
did
the
corporal
seem
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
Moreover
,
just
as
Pierre
was
speaking
a
sharp
rattle
of
drums
*NL*
was
suddenly
heard
from
both
sides
.
The
corporal
frowned
at
Pierre
's
*NL*
words
and
,
uttering
some
meaningless
oaths
,
slammed
the
door
.
The
shed
*NL*
became
semidark
,
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
the
drums
on
two
sides
drowned
*NL*
the
sick
man
's
groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
!
...
It
again
!
...
''
said
Pierre
to
himself
,
and
an
*NL*
involuntary
shudder
ran
down
his
spine
.
In
the
corporal
's
changed
face
,
*NL*
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
in
the
stirring
and
deafening
noise
of
the
*NL*
drums
,
he
recognized
that
mysterious
,
callous
force
which
compelled
*NL*
people
against
their
will
to
kill
their
fellow
men
--
that
force
the
*NL*
effect
of
which
he
had
witnessed
during
the
executions
.
To
fear
or
to
*NL*
try
to
escape
that
force
,
to
address
entreaties
or
exhortations
to
those
*NL*
who
served
as
its
tools
,
was
useless
.
Pierre
knew
this
now
.
One
had
to
*NL*
wait
and
endure
.
He
did
not
again
go
to
the
sick
man
,
nor
turn
to
look
*NL*
at
him
,
but
stood
frowning
by
the
door
of
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
that
door
was
opened
and
the
prisoners
,
crowding
against
one
*NL*
another
like
a
flock
of
sheep
,
squeezed
into
the
exit
,
Pierre
pushed
his
*NL*
way
forward
and
approached
that
very
captain
who
as
the
corporal
had
*NL*
assured
him
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
.
The
captain
was
also
in
*NL*
marching
kit
,
and
on
his
cold
face
appeared
that
same
it
which
Pierre
*NL*
had
recognized
in
the
corporal
's
words
and
in
the
roll
of
the
drums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
on
,
pass
on
!
''
the
captain
reiterated
,
frowning
sternly
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
prisoners
who
thronged
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
up
to
him
,
though
he
knew
his
attempt
would
be
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
now
?
''
the
officer
asked
with
a
cold
look
as
if
not
recognizing
*NL*
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
told
him
about
the
sick
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
manage
to
walk
,
devil
take
him
!
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Pass
on
,
pass
*NL*
on
!
''
he
continued
without
looking
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
is
dying
,
''
Pierre
again
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
so
good
...
''
shouted
the
captain
,
frowning
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dram-da-da-dam
,
dam-dam
...
''
rattled
the
drums
,
and
Pierre
understood
*NL*
that
this
mysterious
force
completely
controlled
these
men
and
that
it
*NL*
was
now
useless
to
say
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
prisoners
were
separated
from
the
soldiers
and
told
to
march
*NL*
in
front
.
There
were
about
thirty
officers
,
with
Pierre
among
them
,
and
*NL*
about
three
hundred
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
,
who
had
come
from
the
other
sheds
,
were
all
strangers
to
*NL*
Pierre
and
much
better
dressed
than
he
.
They
looked
at
him
and
at
his
*NL*
shoes
mistrustfully
,
as
at
an
alien
.
Not
far
from
him
walked
a
fat
major
*NL*
with
a
sallow
,
bloated
,
angry
face
,
who
was
wearing
a
Kazan
dressing
*NL*
gown
tied
round
with
a
towel
,
and
who
evidently
enjoyed
the
respect
of
*NL*
his
fellow
prisoners
.
He
kept
one
hand
,
in
which
he
clasped
his
tobacco
*NL*
pouch
,
inside
the
bosom
of
his
dressing
gown
and
held
the
stem
of
his
*NL*
pipe
firmly
with
the
other
.
Panting
and
puffing
,
the
major
grumbled
and
*NL*
growled
at
everybody
because
he
thought
he
was
being
pushed
and
that
*NL*
they
were
all
hurrying
when
they
had
nowhere
to
hurry
to
and
were
all
*NL*
surprised
at
something
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
surprised
at
.
*NL*
Another
,
a
thin
little
officer
,
was
speaking
to
everyone
,
conjecturing
*NL*
where
they
were
now
being
taken
and
how
far
they
would
get
that
day
.
An
*NL*
official
in
felt
boots
and
wearing
a
commissariat
uniform
ran
round
from
*NL*
side
to
side
and
gazed
at
the
ruins
of
Moscow
,
loudly
announcing
his
*NL*
observations
as
to
what
had
been
burned
down
and
what
this
or
that
part
*NL*
of
the
city
was
that
they
could
see
.
A
third
officer
,
who
by
his
accent
*NL*
was
a
Pole
,
disputed
with
the
commissariat
officer
,
arguing
that
he
was
*NL*
mistaken
in
his
identification
of
the
different
wards
of
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
disputing
about
?
''
said
the
major
angrily
.
``
What
does
it
*NL*
matter
whether
it
is
St.
Nicholas
or
St.
Blasius
?
You
see
it
's
burned
*NL*
down
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
...
What
are
you
pushing
for
?
Is
n't
the
*NL*
road
wide
enough
?
''
said
he
,
turning
to
a
man
behind
him
who
was
not
*NL*
pushing
him
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
What
have
they
done
?
''
the
prisoners
on
one
side
and
another
*NL*
were
heard
saying
as
they
gazed
on
the
charred
ruins
.
``
All
beyond
the
*NL*
river
,
and
Zubova
,
and
in
the
Kremlin
...
Just
look
!
There
's
not
half
of
*NL*
it
left
.
Yes
,
I
told
you
--
the
whole
quarter
beyond
the
river
,
and
so
it
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
it
's
burned
,
so
what
's
the
use
of
talking
?
''
said
the
*NL*
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
passed
near
a
church
in
the
Khamovniki
-LRB-
one
of
the
few
unburned
*NL*
quarters
of
Moscow
-RRB-
the
whole
mass
of
prisoners
suddenly
started
to
one
*NL*
side
and
exclamations
of
horror
and
disgust
were
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
villains
!
What
heathens
!
Yes
;
dead
,
dead
,
so
he
is
...
And
*NL*
smeared
with
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
too
drew
near
the
church
where
the
thing
was
that
evoked
these
*NL*
exclamations
,
and
dimly
made
out
something
leaning
against
the
palings
*NL*
surrounding
the
church
.
From
the
words
of
his
comrades
who
saw
better
*NL*
than
he
did
,
he
found
that
this
was
the
body
of
a
man
,
set
upright
*NL*
against
the
palings
with
its
face
smeared
with
soot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
What
the
devil
...
Go
on
!
Thirty
thousand
devils
!
...
''
the
convoy
*NL*
guards
began
cursing
and
the
French
soldiers
,
with
fresh
virulence
,
*NL*
drove
away
with
their
swords
the
crowd
of
prisoners
who
were
gazing
at
*NL*
the
dead
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
cross
streets
of
the
Khamovniki
quarter
the
prisoners
*NL*
marched
,
followed
only
by
their
escort
and
the
vehicles
and
wagons
*NL*
belonging
to
that
escort
,
but
when
they
reached
the
supply
stores
they
*NL*
came
among
a
huge
and
closely
packed
train
of
artillery
mingled
with
*NL*
private
vehicles
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
bridge
they
all
halted
,
waiting
for
those
in
front
to
get
across
.
*NL*
From
the
bridge
they
had
a
view
of
endless
lines
of
moving
baggage
*NL*
trains
before
and
behind
them
.
To
the
right
,
where
the
Kaluga
road
turns
*NL*
near
Neskuchny
,
endless
rows
of
troops
and
carts
stretched
away
into
the
*NL*
distance
.
These
were
troops
of
Beauharnais
'
corps
which
had
started
*NL*
before
any
of
the
others
.
Behind
,
along
the
riverside
and
across
the
*NL*
Stone
Bridge
,
were
Ney
's
troops
and
transport
.
*NL*
*NL*
Davout
's
troops
,
in
whose
charge
were
the
prisoners
,
were
crossing
the
*NL*
Crimean
bridge
and
some
were
already
debouching
into
the
Kaluga
road
.
*NL*
But
the
baggage
trains
stretched
out
so
that
the
last
of
Beauharnais
'
*NL*
train
had
not
yet
got
out
of
Moscow
and
reached
the
Kaluga
road
when
the
*NL*
vanguard
of
Ney
's
army
was
already
emerging
from
the
Great
Ordynka
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
crossed
the
Crimean
bridge
the
prisoners
moved
a
few
steps
*NL*
forward
,
halted
,
and
again
moved
on
,
and
from
all
sides
vehicles
and
men
*NL*
crowded
closer
and
closer
together
.
They
advanced
the
few
hundred
paces
*NL*
that
separated
the
bridge
from
the
Kaluga
road
,
taking
more
than
an
hour
*NL*
to
do
so
,
and
came
out
upon
the
square
where
the
streets
of
the
*NL*
Transmoskva
ward
and
the
Kaluga
road
converge
,
and
the
prisoners
jammed
*NL*
close
together
had
to
stand
for
some
hours
at
that
crossway
.
From
all
*NL*
sides
,
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
,
were
heard
the
rattle
of
wheels
,
the
*NL*
tramp
of
feet
,
and
incessant
shouts
of
anger
and
abuse
.
Pierre
stood
*NL*
pressed
against
the
wall
of
a
charred
house
,
listening
to
that
noise
*NL*
which
mingled
in
his
imagination
with
the
roll
of
the
drums
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
get
a
better
view
,
several
officer
prisoners
climbed
onto
the
wall
of
*NL*
the
half-burned
house
against
which
Pierre
was
leaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
crowds
!
Just
look
at
the
crowds
!
...
They
've
loaded
goods
even
on
*NL*
the
cannon
!
Look
there
,
those
are
furs
!
''
they
exclaimed
.
``
Just
see
what
*NL*
the
blackguards
have
looted
...
There
!
See
what
that
one
has
behind
in
*NL*
the
cart
...
Why
,
those
are
settings
taken
from
some
icons
,
by
*NL*
heaven
!
...
Oh
,
the
rascals
!
...
See
how
that
fellow
has
loaded
himself
*NL*
up
,
he
can
hardly
walk
!
Good
lord
,
they
've
even
grabbed
those
*NL*
chaises
!
...
See
that
fellow
there
sitting
on
the
trunks
...
Heavens
!
*NL*
They
're
fighting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
hit
him
on
the
snout
--
on
his
snout
!
Like
this
,
we
sha
n't
*NL*
get
away
before
evening
.
Look
,
look
there
...
Why
,
that
must
be
*NL*
Napoleon
's
own
.
See
what
horses
!
And
the
monograms
with
a
crown
!
It
's
*NL*
like
a
portable
house
...
That
fellow
's
dropped
his
sack
and
does
n't
see
*NL*
it
.
Fighting
again
...
A
woman
with
a
baby
,
and
not
bad-looking
either
!
*NL*
Yes
,
I
dare
say
,
that
's
the
way
they
'll
let
you
pass
...
Just
look
,
*NL*
there
's
no
end
to
it
.
Russian
wenches
,
by
heaven
,
so
they
are
!
In
*NL*
carriages
--
see
how
comfortably
they
've
settled
themselves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
as
at
the
church
in
Khamovniki
,
a
wave
of
general
curiosity
bore
*NL*
all
the
prisoners
forward
onto
the
road
,
and
Pierre
,
thanks
to
his
*NL*
stature
,
saw
over
the
heads
of
the
others
what
so
attracted
their
*NL*
curiosity
.
In
three
carriages
involved
among
the
munition
carts
,
closely
*NL*
squeezed
together
,
sat
women
with
rouged
faces
,
dressed
in
glaring
*NL*
colors
,
who
were
shouting
something
in
shrill
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
Pierre
had
recognized
the
appearance
of
the
mysterious
*NL*
force
nothing
had
seemed
to
him
strange
or
dreadful
:
neither
the
corpse
*NL*
smeared
with
soot
for
fun
nor
these
women
hurrying
away
nor
the
burned
*NL*
ruins
of
Moscow
.
All
that
he
now
witnessed
scarcely
made
an
impression
*NL*
on
him
--
as
if
his
soul
,
making
ready
for
a
hard
struggle
,
refused
to
*NL*
receive
impressions
that
might
weaken
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
's
vehicles
drove
by
.
Behind
them
came
more
carts
,
soldiers
,
*NL*
wagons
,
soldiers
,
gun
carriages
,
carriages
,
soldiers
,
ammunition
carts
,
*NL*
more
soldiers
,
and
now
and
then
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
did
not
see
the
people
as
individuals
but
saw
their
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
people
and
horses
seemed
driven
forward
by
some
invisible
*NL*
power
.
During
the
hour
Pierre
watched
them
they
all
came
flowing
from
*NL*
the
different
streets
with
one
and
the
same
desire
to
get
on
quickly
;
*NL*
they
all
jostled
one
another
,
began
to
grow
angry
and
to
fight
,
white
*NL*
teeth
gleamed
,
brows
frowned
,
ever
the
same
words
of
abuse
flew
from
*NL*
side
to
side
,
and
all
the
faces
bore
the
same
swaggeringly
resolute
and
*NL*
coldly
cruel
expression
that
had
struck
Pierre
that
morning
on
the
*NL*
corporal
's
face
when
the
drums
were
beating
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
nearly
evening
that
the
officer
commanding
the
escort
*NL*
collected
his
men
and
with
shouts
and
quarrels
forced
his
way
in
among
*NL*
the
baggage
trains
,
and
the
prisoners
,
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
,
emerged
*NL*
onto
the
Kaluga
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
marched
very
quickly
,
without
resting
,
and
halted
only
when
the
sun
*NL*
began
to
set
.
The
baggage
carts
drew
up
close
together
and
the
men
began
*NL*
to
prepare
for
their
night
's
rest
.
They
all
appeared
angry
and
*NL*
dissatisfied
.
For
a
long
time
,
oaths
,
angry
shouts
,
and
fighting
could
*NL*
be
heard
from
all
sides
.
A
carriage
that
followed
the
escort
ran
into
*NL*
one
of
the
carts
and
knocked
a
hole
in
it
with
its
pole
.
Several
*NL*
soldiers
ran
toward
the
cart
from
different
sides
:
some
beat
the
*NL*
carriage
horses
on
their
heads
,
turning
them
aside
,
others
fought
among
*NL*
themselves
,
and
Pierre
saw
that
one
German
was
badly
wounded
on
the
head
*NL*
by
a
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
that
all
these
men
,
now
that
they
had
stopped
amid
fields
in
*NL*
the
chill
dusk
of
the
autumn
evening
,
experienced
one
and
the
same
*NL*
feeling
of
unpleasant
awakening
from
the
hurry
and
eagerness
to
push
on
*NL*
that
had
seized
them
at
the
start
.
Once
at
a
standstill
they
all
seemed
*NL*
to
understand
that
they
did
not
yet
know
where
they
were
going
,
and
that
*NL*
much
that
was
painful
and
difficult
awaited
them
on
this
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
halt
the
escort
treated
the
prisoners
even
worse
than
they
*NL*
had
done
at
the
start
.
It
was
here
that
the
prisoners
for
the
first
time
*NL*
received
horseflesh
for
their
meat
ration
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
officer
down
to
the
lowest
soldier
they
showed
what
seemed
like
*NL*
personal
spite
against
each
of
the
prisoners
,
in
unexpected
contrast
to
*NL*
their
former
friendly
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spite
increased
still
more
when
,
on
calling
over
the
roll
of
*NL*
prisoners
,
it
was
found
that
in
the
bustle
of
leaving
Moscow
one
Russian
*NL*
soldier
,
who
had
pretended
to
suffer
from
colic
,
had
escaped
.
Pierre
saw
*NL*
a
Frenchman
beat
a
Russian
soldier
cruelly
for
straying
too
far
from
the
*NL*
road
,
and
heard
his
friend
the
captain
reprimand
and
threaten
to
court
-
*NL*
martial
a
noncommissioned
officer
on
account
of
the
escape
of
the
*NL*
Russian
.
To
the
noncommissioned
officer
's
excuse
that
the
prisoner
was
*NL*
ill
and
could
not
walk
,
the
officer
replied
that
the
order
was
to
shoot
*NL*
those
who
lagged
behind
.
Pierre
felt
that
that
fatal
force
which
had
*NL*
crushed
him
during
the
executions
,
but
which
he
had
not
felt
during
his
*NL*
imprisonment
,
now
again
controlled
his
existence
.
It
was
terrible
,
but
*NL*
he
felt
that
in
proportion
to
the
efforts
of
that
fatal
force
to
crush
*NL*
him
,
there
grew
and
strengthened
in
his
soul
a
power
of
life
independent
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ate
his
supper
of
buckwheat
soup
with
horseflesh
and
chatted
with
his
*NL*
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Pierre
nor
any
of
the
others
spoke
of
what
they
had
seen
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
or
of
the
roughness
of
their
treatment
by
the
French
,
or
of
the
*NL*
order
to
shoot
them
which
had
been
announced
to
them
.
As
if
in
reaction
*NL*
against
the
worsening
of
their
position
they
were
all
particularly
*NL*
animated
and
gay
.
They
spoke
of
personal
reminiscences
,
of
amusing
*NL*
scenes
they
had
witnessed
during
the
campaign
,
and
avoided
all
talk
of
*NL*
their
present
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
set
long
since
.
Bright
stars
shone
out
here
and
there
in
the
*NL*
sky
.
A
red
glow
as
of
a
conflagration
spread
above
the
horizon
from
the
*NL*
rising
full
moon
,
and
that
vast
red
ball
swayed
strangely
in
the
gray
*NL*
haze
.
It
grew
light
.
The
evening
was
ending
,
but
the
night
had
not
yet
*NL*
come
.
Pierre
got
up
and
left
his
new
companions
,
crossing
between
the
*NL*
campfires
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
where
he
had
been
told
the
*NL*
common
soldier
prisoners
were
stationed
.
He
wanted
to
talk
to
them
.
On
*NL*
the
road
he
was
stopped
by
a
French
sentinel
who
ordered
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
turned
back
,
not
to
his
companions
by
the
campfire
,
but
to
an
*NL*
unharnessed
cart
where
there
was
nobody
.
Tucking
his
legs
under
him
and
*NL*
dropping
his
head
he
sat
down
on
the
cold
ground
by
the
wheel
of
the
*NL*
cart
and
remained
motionless
a
long
while
sunk
in
thought
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
his
broad
,
good-natured
laughter
,
so
loud
that
*NL*
men
from
various
sides
turned
with
surprise
to
see
what
this
strange
and
*NL*
evidently
solitary
laughter
could
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha-ha-ha
!
''
laughed
Pierre
.
And
he
said
aloud
to
himself
:
``
The
soldier
*NL*
did
not
let
me
pass
.
They
took
me
and
shut
me
up
.
They
hold
me
captive
.
*NL*
What
,
me
?
Me
?
My
immortal
soul
?
Ha-ha-ha
!
Ha-ha-ha
!
...
''
and
he
laughed
*NL*
till
tears
started
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
got
up
and
came
to
see
what
this
queer
big
fellow
was
laughing
at
*NL*
all
by
himself
.
Pierre
stopped
laughing
,
got
up
,
went
farther
away
from
*NL*
the
inquisitive
man
,
and
looked
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
huge
,
endless
bivouac
that
had
previously
resounded
with
the
*NL*
crackling
of
campfires
and
the
voices
of
many
men
had
grown
quiet
,
the
*NL*
red
campfires
were
growing
paler
and
dying
down
.
High
up
in
the
light
*NL*
sky
hung
the
full
moon
.
Forests
and
fields
beyond
the
camp
,
unseen
*NL*
before
,
were
now
visible
in
the
distance
.
And
farther
still
,
beyond
*NL*
those
forests
and
fields
,
the
bright
,
oscillating
,
limitless
distance
*NL*
lured
one
to
itself
.
Pierre
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
the
twinkling
*NL*
stars
in
its
faraway
depths
.
``
And
all
that
is
me
,
all
that
is
within
me
,
*NL*
and
it
is
all
I
!
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
And
they
caught
all
that
and
put
it
*NL*
into
a
shed
boarded
up
with
planks
!
''
He
smiled
,
and
went
and
lay
down
to
*NL*
sleep
beside
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
days
of
October
another
envoy
came
to
Kutuzov
with
a
letter
*NL*
from
Napoleon
proposing
peace
and
falsely
dated
from
Moscow
,
though
*NL*
Napoleon
was
already
not
far
from
Kutuzov
on
the
old
Kaluga
road
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
replied
to
this
letter
as
he
had
done
to
the
one
formerly
*NL*
brought
by
Lauriston
,
saying
that
there
could
be
no
question
of
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
that
a
report
was
received
from
Dorokhov
's
guerrilla
*NL*
detachment
operating
to
the
left
of
Tarutino
that
troops
of
Broussier
's
*NL*
division
had
been
seen
at
Forminsk
and
that
being
separated
from
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
French
army
they
might
easily
be
destroyed
.
The
soldiers
and
*NL*
officers
again
demanded
action
.
Generals
on
the
staff
,
excited
by
the
*NL*
memory
of
the
easy
victory
at
Tarutino
,
urged
Kutuzov
to
carry
out
*NL*
Dorokhov
's
suggestion
.
Kutuzov
did
not
consider
any
offensive
necessary
.
*NL*
The
result
was
a
compromise
which
was
inevitable
:
a
small
detachment
was
*NL*
sent
to
Forminsk
to
attack
Broussier
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
strange
coincidence
,
this
task
,
which
turned
out
to
be
a
most
*NL*
difficult
and
important
one
,
was
entrusted
to
Dokhturov
--
that
same
*NL*
modest
little
Dokhturov
whom
no
one
had
described
to
us
as
drawing
up
*NL*
plans
of
battles
,
dashing
about
in
front
of
regiments
,
showering
crosses
*NL*
on
batteries
,
and
so
on
,
and
who
was
thought
to
be
and
was
spoken
of
as
*NL*
undecided
and
undiscerning
--
but
whom
we
find
commanding
wherever
the
*NL*
position
was
most
difficult
all
through
the
Russo-French
wars
from
*NL*
Austerlitz
to
the
year
1813
.
At
Austerlitz
he
remained
last
at
the
*NL*
Augezd
dam
,
rallying
the
regiments
,
saving
what
was
possible
when
all
*NL*
were
flying
and
perishing
and
not
a
single
general
was
left
in
the
rear
*NL*
guard
.
Ill
with
fever
he
went
to
Smolensk
with
twenty
thousand
men
to
*NL*
defend
the
town
against
Napoleon
's
whole
army
.
In
Smolensk
,
at
the
*NL*
Malakhov
Gate
,
he
had
hardly
dozed
off
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
before
he
*NL*
was
awakened
by
the
bombardment
of
the
town
--
and
Smolensk
held
out
all
*NL*
day
long
.
At
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
when
Bagration
was
killed
and
nine
*NL*
tenths
of
the
men
of
our
left
flank
had
fallen
and
the
full
force
of
the
*NL*
French
artillery
fire
was
directed
against
it
,
the
man
sent
there
was
*NL*
this
same
irresolute
and
undiscerning
Dokhturov
--
Kutuzov
hastening
to
*NL*
rectify
a
mistake
he
had
made
by
sending
someone
else
there
first
.
And
*NL*
the
quiet
little
Dokhturov
rode
thither
,
and
Borodino
became
the
*NL*
greatest
glory
of
the
Russian
army
.
Many
heroes
have
been
described
to
*NL*
us
in
verse
and
prose
,
but
of
Dokhturov
scarcely
a
word
has
been
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Dokhturov
again
whom
they
sent
to
Forminsk
and
from
there
to
*NL*
Malo-Yaroslavets
,
the
place
where
the
last
battle
with
the
French
was
*NL*
fought
and
where
the
obvious
disintegration
of
the
French
army
began
;
*NL*
and
we
are
told
of
many
geniuses
and
heroes
of
that
period
of
the
*NL*
campaign
,
but
of
Dokhturov
nothing
or
very
little
is
said
and
that
*NL*
dubiously
.
And
this
silence
about
Dokhturov
is
the
clearest
testimony
to
*NL*
his
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
natural
for
a
man
who
does
not
understand
the
workings
of
a
*NL*
machine
to
imagine
that
a
shaving
that
has
fallen
into
it
by
chance
and
*NL*
is
interfering
with
its
action
and
tossing
about
in
it
is
its
most
*NL*
important
part
.
The
man
who
does
not
understand
the
construction
of
the
*NL*
machine
can
not
conceive
that
the
small
connecting
cogwheel
which
*NL*
revolves
quietly
is
one
of
the
most
essential
parts
of
the
machine
,
and
*NL*
not
the
shaving
which
merely
harms
and
hinders
the
working
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
tenth
of
October
when
Dokhturov
had
gone
halfway
to
Forminsk
and
*NL*
stopped
at
the
village
of
Aristovo
,
preparing
faithfully
to
execute
the
*NL*
orders
he
had
received
,
the
whole
French
army
having
,
in
its
convulsive
*NL*
movement
,
reached
Murat
's
position
apparently
in
order
to
give
battle
--
*NL*
suddenly
without
any
reason
turned
off
to
the
left
onto
the
new
Kaluga
*NL*
road
and
began
to
enter
Forminsk
,
where
only
Broussier
had
been
till
*NL*
then
.
At
that
time
Dokhturov
had
under
his
command
,
besides
Dorokhov
's
*NL*
detachment
,
the
two
small
guerrilla
detachments
of
Figner
and
Seslavin
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
October
11
Seslavin
came
to
the
Aristovo
headquarters
*NL*
with
a
French
guardsman
he
had
captured
.
The
prisoner
said
that
the
*NL*
troops
that
had
entered
Forminsk
that
day
were
the
vanguard
of
the
whole
*NL*
army
,
that
Napoleon
was
there
and
the
whole
army
had
left
Moscow
four
*NL*
days
previously
.
That
same
evening
a
house
serf
who
had
come
from
*NL*
Borovsk
said
he
had
seen
an
immense
army
entering
the
town
.
Some
*NL*
Cossacks
of
Dokhturov
's
detachment
reported
having
sighted
the
French
*NL*
Guards
marching
along
the
road
to
Borovsk
.
From
all
these
reports
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
where
they
had
expected
to
meet
a
single
division
there
was
*NL*
now
the
whole
French
army
marching
from
Moscow
in
an
unexpected
*NL*
direction
--
along
the
Kaluga
road
.
Dokhturov
was
unwilling
to
undertake
*NL*
any
action
,
as
it
was
not
clear
to
him
now
what
he
ought
to
do
.
He
had
*NL*
been
ordered
to
attack
Forminsk
.
But
only
Broussier
had
been
there
at
*NL*
that
time
and
now
the
whole
French
army
was
there
.
Ermolov
wished
to
act
*NL*
on
his
own
judgment
,
but
Dokhturov
insisted
that
he
must
have
Kutuzov
's
*NL*
instructions
.
So
it
was
decided
to
send
a
dispatch
to
the
staff
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
a
capable
officer
,
Bolkhovitinov
,
was
chosen
,
who
was
*NL*
to
explain
the
whole
affair
by
word
of
mouth
,
besides
delivering
a
*NL*
written
report
.
Toward
midnight
Bolkhovitinov
,
having
received
the
*NL*
dispatch
and
verbal
instructions
,
galloped
off
to
the
General
Staff
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
Cossack
with
spare
horses
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
,
dark
,
autumn
night
.
It
had
been
raining
for
four
days
.
*NL*
Having
changed
horses
twice
and
galloped
twenty
miles
in
an
hour
and
a
*NL*
half
over
a
sticky
,
muddy
road
,
Bolkhovitinov
reached
Litashevka
after
*NL*
one
o'clock
at
night
.
Dismounting
at
a
cottage
on
whose
wattle
fence
*NL*
hung
a
signboard
,
GENERAL
STAFF
,
and
throwing
down
his
reins
,
he
entered
*NL*
a
dark
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
general
on
duty
,
quick
!
It
's
very
important
!
''
said
he
to
someone
*NL*
who
had
risen
and
was
sniffing
in
the
dark
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
very
unwell
since
the
evening
and
this
is
the
third
night
*NL*
he
has
not
slept
,
''
said
the
orderly
pleadingly
in
a
whisper
.
``
You
should
*NL*
wake
the
captain
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
very
important
,
from
General
Dokhturov
,
''
said
*NL*
Bolkhovitinov
,
entering
the
open
door
which
he
had
found
by
feeling
in
*NL*
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orderly
had
gone
in
before
him
and
began
waking
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
your
honor
!
A
courier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
's
that
?
From
whom
?
''
came
a
sleepy
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Dokhturov
and
from
Alexey
Petrovich
.
Napoleon
is
at
Forminsk
,
''
*NL*
said
Bolkhovitinov
,
unable
to
see
in
the
dark
who
was
speaking
but
*NL*
guessing
by
the
voice
that
it
was
not
Konovnitsyn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
wakened
yawned
and
stretched
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
waking
him
,
''
he
said
,
fumbling
for
something
.
``
He
is
very
*NL*
ill
.
Perhaps
this
is
only
a
rumor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
dispatch
,
''
said
Bolkhovitinov
.
``
My
orders
are
to
give
it
at
*NL*
once
to
the
general
on
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
I
'll
light
a
candle
.
You
damned
rascal
,
where
do
you
*NL*
always
hide
it
?
''
said
the
voice
of
the
man
who
was
stretching
himself
,
*NL*
to
the
orderly
.
-LRB-
This
was
Shcherbinin
,
Konovnitsyn
's
adjutant
.
-RRB-
``
I
've
*NL*
found
it
,
I
've
found
it
!
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orderly
was
striking
a
light
and
Shcherbinin
was
fumbling
for
*NL*
something
on
the
candlestick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
nasty
beasts
!
''
said
he
with
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
light
of
the
sparks
Bolkhovitinov
saw
Shcherbinin
's
youthful
face
*NL*
as
he
held
the
candle
,
and
the
face
of
another
man
who
was
still
asleep
.
*NL*
This
was
Konovnitsyn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
flame
of
the
sulphur
splinters
kindled
by
the
tinder
burned
up
,
*NL*
first
blue
and
then
red
,
Shcherbinin
lit
the
tallow
candle
,
from
the
*NL*
candlestick
of
which
the
cockroaches
that
had
been
gnawing
it
were
*NL*
running
away
,
and
looked
at
the
messenger
.
Bolkhovitinov
was
bespattered
*NL*
all
over
with
mud
and
had
smeared
his
face
by
wiping
it
with
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
the
report
?
''
inquired
Shcherbinin
,
taking
the
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
news
is
reliable
,
''
said
Bolkhovitinov
.
``
Prisoners
,
Cossacks
,
and
*NL*
the
scouts
all
say
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
be
done
,
we
'll
have
to
wake
him
,
''
said
Shcherbinin
,
*NL*
rising
and
going
up
to
the
man
in
the
nightcap
who
lay
covered
by
a
*NL*
greatcoat
.
``
Peter
Petrovich
!
''
said
he
.
-LRB-
Konovnitsyn
did
not
stir
.
-RRB-
``
To
*NL*
the
General
Staff
!
''
he
said
with
a
smile
,
knowing
that
those
words
would
*NL*
be
sure
to
arouse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
fact
the
head
in
the
nightcap
was
lifted
at
once
.
On
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
's
handsome
,
resolute
face
with
cheeks
flushed
by
fever
,
*NL*
there
still
remained
for
an
instant
a
faraway
dreamy
expression
remote
*NL*
from
present
affairs
,
but
then
he
suddenly
started
and
his
face
assumed
*NL*
its
habitual
calm
and
firm
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
From
whom
?
''
he
asked
immediately
but
without
hurry
,
*NL*
blinking
at
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
listening
to
the
officer
's
report
Konovnitsyn
broke
the
seal
and
*NL*
read
the
dispatch
.
Hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
lowered
his
legs
in
*NL*
their
woolen
stockings
to
the
earthen
floor
and
began
putting
on
his
*NL*
boots
.
Then
he
took
off
his
nightcap
,
combed
his
hair
over
his
temples
,
*NL*
and
donned
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
here
quickly
?
Let
us
go
to
his
Highness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
had
understood
at
once
that
the
news
brought
was
of
great
*NL*
importance
and
that
no
time
must
be
lost
.
He
did
not
consider
or
ask
*NL*
himself
whether
the
news
was
good
or
bad
.
That
did
not
interest
him
.
He
*NL*
regarded
the
whole
business
of
the
war
not
with
his
intelligence
or
his
*NL*
reason
but
by
something
else
.
There
was
within
him
a
deep
unexpressed
*NL*
conviction
that
all
would
be
well
,
but
that
one
must
not
trust
to
this
*NL*
and
still
less
speak
about
it
,
but
must
only
attend
to
one
's
own
work
.
*NL*
And
he
did
his
work
,
giving
his
whole
strength
to
the
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
Petrovich
Konovnitsyn
,
like
Dokhturov
,
seems
to
have
been
included
*NL*
merely
for
propriety
's
sake
in
the
list
of
the
so-called
heroes
of
1812
-
*NL*
-
the
Barclays
,
Raevskis
,
Ermolovs
,
Platovs
,
and
Miloradoviches
.
Like
*NL*
Dokhturov
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
very
limited
capacity
*NL*
and
information
,
and
like
Dokhturov
he
never
made
plans
of
battle
but
*NL*
was
always
found
where
the
situation
was
most
difficult
.
Since
his
*NL*
appointment
as
general
on
duty
he
had
always
slept
with
his
door
open
,
*NL*
giving
orders
that
every
messenger
should
be
allowed
to
wake
him
up
.
In
*NL*
battle
he
was
always
under
fire
,
so
that
Kutuzov
reproved
him
for
it
and
*NL*
feared
to
send
him
to
the
front
,
and
like
Dokhturov
he
was
one
of
those
*NL*
unnoticed
cogwheels
that
,
without
clatter
or
noise
,
constitute
the
most
*NL*
essential
part
of
the
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
out
of
the
hut
into
the
damp
,
dark
night
Konovnitsyn
frowned
--
*NL*
partly
from
an
increased
pain
in
his
head
and
partly
at
the
unpleasant
*NL*
thought
that
occurred
to
him
,
of
how
all
that
nest
of
influential
men
on
*NL*
the
staff
would
be
stirred
up
by
this
news
,
especially
Bennigsen
,
who
*NL*
ever
since
Tarutino
had
been
at
daggers
drawn
with
Kutuzov
;
and
how
they
*NL*
would
make
suggestions
,
quarrel
,
issue
orders
,
and
rescind
them
.
And
*NL*
this
premonition
was
disagreeable
to
him
though
he
knew
it
could
not
be
*NL*
helped
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
fact
Toll
,
to
whom
he
went
to
communicate
the
news
,
immediately
*NL*
began
to
expound
his
plans
to
a
general
sharing
his
quarters
,
until
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
,
who
listened
in
weary
silence
,
reminded
him
that
they
must
*NL*
go
to
see
his
Highness
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
like
all
old
people
did
not
sleep
much
at
night
.
He
often
fell
*NL*
asleep
unexpectedly
in
the
daytime
,
but
at
night
,
lying
on
his
bed
*NL*
without
undressing
,
he
generally
remained
awake
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
lay
now
on
his
bed
,
supporting
his
large
,
heavy
,
scarred
head
on
*NL*
his
plump
hand
,
with
his
one
eye
open
,
meditating
and
peering
into
the
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Bennigsen
,
who
corresponded
with
the
Emperor
and
had
more
*NL*
influence
than
anyone
else
on
the
staff
,
had
begun
to
avoid
him
,
Kutuzov
*NL*
was
more
at
ease
as
to
the
possibility
of
himself
and
his
troops
being
*NL*
obliged
to
take
part
in
useless
aggressive
movements
.
The
lesson
of
the
*NL*
Tarutino
battle
and
of
the
day
before
it
,
which
Kutuzov
remembered
with
*NL*
pain
,
must
,
he
thought
,
have
some
effect
on
others
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
understand
that
we
can
only
lose
by
taking
the
offensive
.
*NL*
Patience
and
time
are
my
warriors
,
my
champions
,
''
thought
Kutuzov
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
an
apple
should
not
be
plucked
while
it
is
green
.
It
will
fall
*NL*
of
itself
when
ripe
,
but
if
picked
unripe
the
apple
is
spoiled
,
the
tree
*NL*
is
harmed
,
and
your
teeth
are
set
on
edge
.
Like
an
experienced
sportsman
*NL*
he
knew
that
the
beast
was
wounded
,
and
wounded
as
only
the
whole
*NL*
strength
of
Russia
could
have
wounded
it
,
but
whether
it
was
mortally
*NL*
wounded
or
not
was
still
an
undecided
question
.
Now
by
the
fact
of
*NL*
Lauriston
and
Barthelemi
having
been
sent
,
and
by
the
reports
of
the
*NL*
guerrillas
,
Kutuzov
was
almost
sure
that
the
wound
was
mortal
.
But
he
*NL*
needed
further
proofs
and
it
was
necessary
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
to
run
to
see
how
they
have
wounded
it
.
Wait
and
we
shall
*NL*
see
!
Continual
maneuvers
,
continual
advances
!
''
thought
he
.
``
What
for
?
*NL*
Only
to
distinguish
themselves
!
As
if
fighting
were
fun
.
They
are
like
*NL*
children
from
whom
one
ca
n't
get
any
sensible
account
of
what
has
*NL*
happened
because
they
all
want
to
show
how
well
they
can
fight
.
But
*NL*
that
's
not
what
is
needed
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
ingenious
maneuvers
they
all
propose
to
me
!
It
seems
to
them
*NL*
that
when
they
have
thought
of
two
or
three
contingencies
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
remembered
the
general
plan
sent
him
from
Petersburg
-RRB-
``
they
have
*NL*
foreseen
everything
.
But
the
contingencies
are
endless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
undecided
question
as
to
whether
the
wound
inflicted
at
Borodino
was
*NL*
mortal
or
not
had
hung
over
Kutuzov
's
head
for
a
whole
month
.
On
the
one
*NL*
hand
the
French
had
occupied
Moscow
.
On
the
other
Kutuzov
felt
assured
*NL*
with
all
his
being
that
the
terrible
blow
into
which
he
and
all
the
*NL*
Russians
had
put
their
whole
strength
must
have
been
mortal
.
But
in
any
*NL*
case
proofs
were
needed
;
he
had
waited
a
whole
month
for
them
and
grew
*NL*
more
impatient
the
longer
he
waited
.
Lying
on
his
bed
during
those
*NL*
sleepless
nights
he
did
just
what
he
reproached
those
younger
generals
*NL*
for
doing
.
He
imagined
all
sorts
of
possible
contingencies
,
just
like
*NL*
the
younger
men
,
but
with
this
difference
,
that
he
saw
thousands
of
*NL*
contingencies
instead
of
two
or
three
and
based
nothing
on
them
.
The
*NL*
longer
he
thought
the
more
contingencies
presented
themselves
.
He
*NL*
imagined
all
sorts
of
movements
of
the
Napoleonic
army
as
a
whole
or
in
*NL*
sections
--
against
Petersburg
,
or
against
him
,
or
to
outflank
him
.
He
*NL*
thought
too
of
the
possibility
-LRB-
which
he
feared
most
of
all
-RRB-
that
*NL*
Napoleon
might
fight
him
with
his
own
weapon
and
remain
in
Moscow
*NL*
awaiting
him
.
Kutuzov
even
imagined
that
Napoleon
's
army
might
turn
back
*NL*
through
Medyn
and
Yukhnov
,
but
the
one
thing
he
could
not
foresee
was
*NL*
what
happened
--
the
insane
,
convulsive
stampede
of
Napoleon
's
army
during
*NL*
its
first
eleven
days
after
leaving
Moscow
:
a
stampede
which
made
*NL*
possible
what
Kutuzov
had
not
yet
even
dared
to
think
of
--
the
complete
*NL*
extermination
of
the
French
.
Dorokhov
's
report
about
Broussier
's
*NL*
division
,
the
guerrillas
'
reports
of
distress
in
Napoleon
's
army
,
rumors
*NL*
of
preparations
for
leaving
Moscow
,
all
confirmed
the
supposition
that
*NL*
the
French
army
was
beaten
and
preparing
for
flight
.
But
these
were
only
*NL*
suppositions
,
which
seemed
important
to
the
younger
men
but
not
to
*NL*
Kutuzov
.
With
his
sixty
years
'
experience
he
knew
what
value
to
attach
*NL*
to
rumors
,
knew
how
apt
people
who
desire
anything
are
to
group
all
news
*NL*
so
that
it
appears
to
confirm
what
they
desire
,
and
he
knew
how
readily
*NL*
in
such
cases
they
omit
all
that
makes
for
the
contrary
.
And
the
more
he
*NL*
desired
it
the
less
he
allowed
himself
to
believe
it
.
This
question
*NL*
absorbed
all
his
mental
powers
.
All
else
was
to
him
only
life
's
*NL*
customary
routine
.
To
such
customary
routine
belonged
his
conversations
*NL*
with
the
staff
,
the
letters
he
wrote
from
Tarutino
to
Madame
de
Stael
,
*NL*
the
reading
of
novels
,
the
distribution
of
awards
,
his
correspondence
*NL*
with
Petersburg
,
and
so
on
.
But
the
destruction
of
the
French
,
which
he
*NL*
alone
foresaw
,
was
his
heart
's
one
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
October
he
lay
leaning
on
his
arm
and
*NL*
thinking
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stir
in
the
next
room
and
he
heard
the
steps
of
Toll
,
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
,
and
Bolkhovitinov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
who
's
there
?
Come
in
,
come
in
!
What
news
?
''
the
field
marshal
called
*NL*
out
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
a
footman
was
lighting
a
candle
,
Toll
communicated
the
substance
*NL*
of
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
brought
it
?
''
asked
Kutuzov
with
a
look
which
,
when
the
candle
was
*NL*
lit
,
struck
Toll
by
its

Kutuzov
sat
up
with
one
leg
hanging
down
from
the
bed
and
his
big
paunch
*NL*
resting
against
the
other
which
was
doubled
under
him
.
He
screwed
up
his
*NL*
seeing
eye
to
scrutinize
the
messenger
more
carefully
,
as
if
wishing
to
*NL*
read
in
his
face
what
preoccupied
his
own
mind

*NL*
``
Tell

said
he
to
Bolkhovitinov
in

as
he
pulled
together
the

which
gaped
open
on

*NL*
``

Are

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bolkhovitinov
gave
a
detailed
account
from
the
beginning
of
all
he
had

been
told
to
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
quicker

Do

Kutuzov
interrupted
him

*NL*
*NL*
Bolkhovitinov
told
him
everything
and
was
then
silent
,
awaiting
*NL*
instructions
.
Toll
was
beginning
to
say
something
but
Kutuzov
checked
*NL*
him
.
He
tried
to
say
something
,
but
his
face
suddenly
puckered
and
*NL*
wrinkled
;
he
waved
his
arm
at
Toll
and
turned
to
the

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
time
he
received
this
news
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
all
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
activity
was
directed
toward
restraining
his
troops
,
by
*NL*
authority
,
by
guile
,
and
by
entreaty
,
from
useless
attacks
,
maneuvers
,
*NL*
or
encounters
with
the
perishing
enemy
.
Dokhturov
went
to
Malo
-
*NL*
Yaroslavets
,
but
Kutuzov
lingered
with
the
main
army
and
gave
orders
for
*NL*
the
evacuation
of
Kaluga
--
a
retreat
beyond
which
town
seemed
to
him
*NL*
quite
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
Kutuzov
retreated
,
but
the
enemy
without
waiting
for
his
*NL*
retreat
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
's
historians
describe
to
us
his
skilled
maneuvers
at
Tarutino
*NL*
and
Malo-Yaroslavets
,
and
make
conjectures
as
to
what
would
have
*NL*
happened
had
Napoleon
been
in
time
to
penetrate
into
the
rich
southern
*NL*
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
nothing
prevented
him
from
advancing
*NL*
into
those
southern
provinces
-LRB-
for
the
Russian
army
did
not
bar
his
*NL*
way
-RRB-
,
the
historians
forget
that
nothing
could
have
saved
his
army
,
for
*NL*
then
already
it
bore
within
itself
the
germs
of
inevitable
ruin
.
How
*NL*
could
that
army
--
which
had
found
abundant
supplies
in
Moscow
and
had
*NL*
trampled
them
underfoot
instead
of
keeping
them
,
and
on
arriving
at
*NL*
Smolensk
had
looted
provisions
instead
of
storing
them
--
how
could
that
*NL*
army
recuperate
in
Kaluga
province
,
which
was
inhabited
by
Russians
such
*NL*
as
those
who
lived
in
Moscow
,
and
where
fire
had
the
same
property
of
*NL*
consuming
what
was
set
ablaze
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
army
could
not
recover
anywhere
.
Since
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
*NL*
the
pillage
of
Moscow
it
had
borne
within
itself
,
as
it
were
,
the
*NL*
chemical
elements
of
dissolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
members
of
what
had
once
been
an
army
--
Napoleon
himself
and
all
his
*NL*
soldiers
fled
--
without
knowing
whither
,
each
concerned
only
to
make
his
*NL*
escape
as
quickly
as
possible
from
this
position
,
of
the
hopelessness
of
*NL*
which
they
were
all
more
or
less
vaguely
conscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
came
about
that
at
the
council
at
Malo-Yaroslavets
,
when
the
*NL*
generals
pretending
to
confer
together
expressed
various
opinions
,
all
*NL*
mouths
were
closed
by
the
opinion
uttered
by
the
simple-minded
soldier
*NL*
Mouton
who
,
speaking
last
,
said
what
they
all
felt
:
that
the
one
thing
*NL*
needful
was
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
;
and
no
one
,
not
even
*NL*
Napoleon
,
could
say
anything
against
that
truth
which
they
all
*NL*
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
they
all
realized
that
it
was
necessary
to
get
away
,
there
*NL*
still
remained
a
feeling
of
shame
at
admitting
that
they
must
flee
.
An
*NL*
external
shock
was
needed
to
overcome
that
shame
,
and
this
shock
came
in
*NL*
due
time
.
It
was
what
the
French
called
``
le
hourra
de
l'Empereur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
the
council
at
Malo-Yaroslavets
Napoleon
rode
out
early
in
*NL*
the
morning
amid
the
lines
of
his
army
with
his
suite
of
marshals
and
an
*NL*
escort
,
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
the
army
and
the
scene
of
the
*NL*
previous
and
of
the
impending
battle
.
Some
Cossacks
on
the
prowl
for
*NL*
booty
fell
in
with
the
Emperor
and
very
nearly
captured
him
.
If
the
*NL*
Cossacks
did
not
capture
Napoleon
then
,
what
saved
him
was
the
very
*NL*
thing
that
was
destroying
the
French
army
,
the
booty
on
which
the
*NL*
Cossacks
fell
.
Here
as
at
Tarutino
they
went
after
plunder
,
leaving
the
*NL*
men
.
Disregarding
Napoleon
they
rushed
after
the
plunder
and
Napoleon
*NL*
managed
to
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
les
enfants
du
Don
might
so
easily
have
taken
the
Emperor
himself
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
his
army
,
it
was
clear
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
*NL*
to
fly
as
fast
as
possible
along
the
nearest
,
familiar
road
.
Napoleon
*NL*
with
his
forty-year-old
stomach
understood
that
hint
,
not
feeling
his
*NL*
former
agility
and
boldness
,
and
under
the
influence
of
the
fright
the
*NL*
Cossacks
had
given
him
he
at
once
agreed
with
Mouton
and
issued
orders
--
*NL*
as
the
historians
tell
us
--
to
retreat
by
the
Smolensk
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Napoleon
agreed
with
Mouton
,
and
that
the
army
retreated
,
does
not
*NL*
prove
that
Napoleon
caused
it
to
retreat
,
but
that
the
forces
which
*NL*
influenced
the
whole
army
and
directed
it
along
the
Mozhaysk
-LRB-
that
is
,
*NL*
the
Smolensk
-RRB-
road
acted
simultaneously
on
him
also
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
in
motion
always
devises
an
aim
for
that
motion
.
To
be
able
to
go
*NL*
a
thousand
miles
he
must
imagine
that
something
good
awaits
him
at
the
*NL*
end
of
those
thousand
miles
.
One
must
have
the
prospect
of
a
promised
*NL*
land
to
have
the
strength
to
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
promised
land
for
the
French
during
their
advance
had
been
Moscow
,
*NL*
during
their
retreat
it
was
their
native
land
.
But
that
native
land
was
*NL*
too
far
off
,
and
for
a
man
going
a
thousand
miles
it
is
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
set
aside
his
final
goal
and
to
say
to
himself
:
``
Today
I
*NL*
shall
get
to
a
place
twenty-five
miles
off
where
I
shall
rest
and
spend
*NL*
the
night
,
''
and
during
the
first
day
's
journey
that
resting
place
*NL*
eclipses
his
ultimate
goal
and
attracts
all
his
hopes
and
desires
.
And
*NL*
the
impulses
felt
by
a
single
person
are
always
magnified
in
a
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
French
retreating
along
the
old
Smolensk
road
,
the
final
goal
--
*NL*
their
native
land
--
was
too
remote
,
and
their
immediate
goal
was
*NL*
Smolensk
,
toward
which
all
their
desires
and
hopes
,
enormously
*NL*
intensified
in
the
mass
,
urged
them
on
.
It
was
not
that
they
knew
that
*NL*
much
food
and
fresh
troops
awaited
them
in
Smolensk
,
nor
that
they
were
*NL*
told
so
-LRB-
on
the
contrary
their
superior
officers
,
and
Napoleon
himself
,
*NL*
knew
that
provisions
were
scarce
there
-RRB-
,
but
because
this
alone
could
*NL*
give
them
strength
to
move
on
and
endure
their
present
privations
.
So
*NL*
both
those
who
knew
and
those
who
did
not
know
deceived
themselves
,
and
*NL*
pushed
on
to
Smolensk
as
to
a
promised
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
out
onto
the
highroad
the
French
fled
with
surprising
energy
and
*NL*
unheard-of
rapidity
toward
the
goal
they
had
fixed
on
.
Besides
the
*NL*
common
impulse
which
bound
the
whole
crowd
of
French
into
one
mass
and
*NL*
supplied
them
with
a
certain
energy
,
there
was
another
cause
binding
*NL*
them
together
--
their
great
numbers
.
As
with
the
physical
law
of
gravity
,
*NL*
their
enormous
mass
drew
the
individual
human
atoms
to
itself
.
In
their
*NL*
hundreds
of
thousands
they
moved
like
a
whole
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
of
them
desired
nothing
more
than
to
give
himself
up
as
a
prisoner
*NL*
to
escape
from
all
this
horror
and
misery
;
but
on
the
one
hand
the
force
*NL*
of
this
common
attraction
to
Smolensk
,
their
goal
,
drew
each
of
them
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
;
on
the
other
hand
an
army
corps
could
not
surrender
*NL*
to
a
company
,
and
though
the
French
availed
themselves
of
every
*NL*
convenient
opportunity
to
detach
themselves
and
to
surrender
on
the
*NL*
slightest
decent
pretext
,
such
pretexts
did
not
always
occur
.
Their
very
*NL*
numbers
and
their
crowded
and
swift
movement
deprived
them
of
that
*NL*
possibility
and
rendered
it
not
only
difficult
but
impossible
for
the
*NL*
Russians
to
stop
this
movement
,
to
which
the
French
were
directing
all
*NL*
their
energies
.
Beyond
a
certain
limit
no
mechanical
disruption
of
the
*NL*
body
could
hasten
the
process
of
decomposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lump
of
snow
can
not
be
melted
instantaneously
.
There
is
a
certain
*NL*
limit
of
time
in
less
than
which
no
amount
of
heat
can
melt
the
snow
.
On
*NL*
the
contrary
the
greater
the
heat
the
more
solidified
the
remaining
snow
*NL*
becomes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
Russian
commanders
Kutuzov
alone
understood
this
.
When
the
flight
*NL*
of
the
French
army
along
the
Smolensk
road
became
well
defined
,
what
*NL*
Konovnitsyn
had
foreseen
on
the
night
of
the
eleventh
of
October
began
*NL*
to
occur
.
The
superior
officers
all
wanted
to
distinguish
themselves
,
to
*NL*
cut
off
,
to
seize
,
to
capture
,
and
to
overthrow
the
French
,
and
all
*NL*
clamored
for
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
alone
used
all
his
power
-LRB-
and
such
power
is
very
limited
in
the
*NL*
case
of
any
commander-in-chief
-RRB-
to
prevent
an
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
tell
them
what
we
say
now
:
``
Why
fight
,
why
block
the
road
,
*NL*
losing
our
own
men
and
inhumanly
slaughtering
unfortunate
wretches
?
What
*NL*
is
the
use
of
that
,
when
a
third
of
their
army
has
melted
away
on
the
*NL*
road
from
Moscow
to
Vyazma
without
any
battle
?
''
But
drawing
from
his
*NL*
aged
wisdom
what
they
could
understand
,
he
told
them
of
the
golden
*NL*
bridge
,
and
they
laughed
at
and
slandered
him
,
flinging
themselves
on
,
*NL*
rending
and
exulting
over
the
dying
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ermolov
,
Miloradovich
,
Platov
,
and
others
in
proximity
to
the
French
*NL*
near
Vyazma
could
not
resist
their
desire
to
cut
off
and
break
up
two
*NL*
French
corps
,
and
by
way
of
reporting
their
intention
to
Kutuzov
they
*NL*
sent
him
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
in
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
try
as
Kutuzov
might
to
restrain
the
troops
,
our
men
attacked
,
*NL*
trying
to
bar
the
road
.
Infantry
regiments
,
we
are
told
,
advanced
to
the
*NL*
attack
with
music
and
with
drums
beating
,
and
killed
and
lost
thousands
*NL*
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
did
not
cut
off
or
overthrow
anybody
and
the
French
army
,
*NL*
closing
up
more
firmly
at
the
danger
,
continued
,
while
steadily
melting
*NL*
away
,
to
pursue
its
fatal
path
to
Smolensk
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
The
Battle
of
Borodino
,
with
the
occupation
of
Moscow
that
followed
it
*NL*
and
the
flight
of
the
French
without
further
conflicts
,
is
one
of
the
*NL*
most
instructive
phenomena
in
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
historians
agree
that
the
external
activity
of
states
and
nations
in
*NL*
their
conflicts
with
one
another
is
expressed
in
wars
,
and
that
as
a
*NL*
direct
result
of
greater
or
less
success
in
war
the
political
strength
*NL*
of
states
and
nations
increases
or
decreases
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
as
may
be
the
historical
account
of
how
some
king
or
emperor
,
*NL*
having
quarreled
with
another
,
collects
an
army
,
fights
his
enemy
's
*NL*
army
,
gains
a
victory
by
killing
three
,
five
,
or
ten
thousand
men
,
and
*NL*
subjugates
a
kingdom
and
an
entire
nation
of
several
millions
,
all
the
*NL*
facts
of
history
-LRB-
as
far
as
we
know
it
-RRB-
confirm
the
truth
of
the
*NL*
statement
that
the
greater
or
lesser
success
of
one
army
against
another
*NL*
is
the
cause
,
or
at
least
an
essential
indication
,
of
an
increase
or
*NL*
decrease
in
the
strength
of
the
nation
--
even
though
it
is
unintelligible
*NL*
why
the
defeat
of
an
army
--
a
hundredth
part
of
a
nation
--
should
oblige
*NL*
that
whole
nation
to
submit
.
An
army
gains
a
victory
,
and
at
once
the
*NL*
rights
of
the
conquering
nation
have
increased
to
the
detriment
of
the
*NL*
defeated
.
An
army
has
suffered
defeat
,
and
at
once
a
people
loses
its
*NL*
rights
in
proportion
to
the
severity
of
the
reverse
,
and
if
its
army
*NL*
suffers
a
complete
defeat
the
nation
is
quite
subjugated
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
according
to
history
it
has
been
found
from
the
most
ancient
times
,
*NL*
and
so
it
is
to
our
own
day
.
All
Napoleon
's
wars
serve
to
confirm
this
*NL*
rule
.
In
proportion
to
the
defeat
of
the
Austrian
army
Austria
loses
its
*NL*
rights
,
and
the
rights
and
the
strength
of
France
increase
.
The
*NL*
victories
of
the
French
at
Jena
and
Auerstadt
destroy
the
independent
*NL*
existence
of
Prussia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
,
in
1812
,
the
French
gain
a
victory
near
Moscow
.
Moscow
is
*NL*
taken
and
after
that
,
with
no
further
battles
,
it
is
not
Russia
that
*NL*
ceases
to
exist
,
but
the
French
army
of
six
hundred
thousand
,
and
then
*NL*
Napoleonic
France
itself
.
To
strain
the
facts
to
fit
the
rules
of
*NL*
history
:
to
say
that
the
field
of
battle
at
Borodino
remained
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
the
Russians
,
or
that
after
Moscow
there
were
other
battles
*NL*
that
destroyed
Napoleon
's
army
,
is
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
French
victory
at
Borodino
there
was
no
general
engagement
nor
*NL*
any
that
were
at
all
serious
,
yet
the
French
army
ceased
to
exist
.
What
*NL*
does
this
mean
?
If
it
were
an
example
taken
from
the
history
of
China
,
*NL*
we
might
say
that
it
was
not
an
historic
phenomenon
-LRB-
which
is
the
*NL*
historians
'
usual
expedient
when
anything
does
not
fit
their
standards
-RRB-
;
*NL*
if
the
matter
concerned
some
brief
conflict
in
which
only
a
small
number
*NL*
of
troops
took
part
,
we
might
treat
it
as
an
exception
;
but
this
event
*NL*
occurred
before
our
fathers
'
eyes
,
and
for
them
it
was
a
question
of
the
*NL*
life
or
death
of
their
fatherland
,
and
it
happened
in
the
greatest
of
*NL*
all
known
wars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
period
of
the
campaign
of
1812
from
the
battle
of
Borodino
to
the
*NL*
expulsion
of
the
French
proved
that
the
winning
of
a
battle
does
not
*NL*
produce
a
conquest
and
is
not
even
an
invariable
indication
of
conquest
;
*NL*
it
proved
that
the
force
which
decides
the
fate
of
peoples
lies
not
in
*NL*
the
conquerors
,
nor
even
in
armies
and
battles
,
but
in
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
historians
,
describing
the
condition
of
the
French
army
*NL*
before
it
left
Moscow
,
affirm
that
all
was
in
order
in
the
Grand
Army
,
*NL*
except
the
cavalry
,
the
artillery
,
and
the
transport
--
there
was
no
*NL*
forage
for
the
horses
or
the
cattle
.
That
was
a
misfortune
no
one
could
*NL*
remedy
,
for
the
peasants
of
the
district
burned
their
hay
rather
than
*NL*
let
the
French
have
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victory
gained
did
not
bring
the
usual
results
because
the
peasants
*NL*
Karp
and
Vlas
-LRB-
who
after
the
French
had
evacuated
Moscow
drove
in
their
*NL*
carts
to
pillage
the
town
,
and
in
general
personally
failed
to
manifest
*NL*
any
heroic
feelings
-RRB-
,
and
the
whole
innumerable
multitude
of
such
*NL*
peasants
,
did
not
bring
their
hay
to
Moscow
for
the
high
price
offered
*NL*
them
,
but
burned
it
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
imagine
two
men
who
have
come
out
to
fight
a
duel
with
rapiers
*NL*
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
art
of
fencing
.
The
fencing
has
gone
*NL*
on
for
some
time
;
suddenly
one
of
the
combatants
,
feeling
himself
*NL*
wounded
and
understanding
that
the
matter
is
no
joke
but
concerns
his
*NL*
life
,
throws
down
his
rapier
,
and
seizing
the
first
cudgel
that
comes
to
*NL*
hand
begins
to
brandish
it
.
Then
let
us
imagine
that
the
combatant
who
*NL*
so
sensibly
employed
the
best
and
simplest
means
to
attain
his
end
was
*NL*
at
the
same
time
influenced
by
traditions
of
chivalry
and
,
desiring
to
*NL*
conceal
the
facts
of
the
case
,
insisted
that
he
had
gained
his
victory
*NL*
with
the
rapier
according
to
all
the
rules
of
art
.
One
can
imagine
what
*NL*
confusion
and
obscurity
would
result
from
such
an
account
of
the
duel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fencer
who
demanded
a
contest
according
to
the
rules
of
fencing
was
*NL*
the
French
army
;
his
opponent
who
threw
away
the
rapier
and
snatched
up
*NL*
the
cudgel
was
the
Russian
people
;
those
who
try
to
explain
the
matter
*NL*
according
to
the
rules
of
fencing
are
the
historians
who
have
described
*NL*
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
burning
of
Smolensk
a
war
began
which
did
not
follow
any
*NL*
previous
traditions
of
war
.
The
burning
of
towns
and
villages
,
the
*NL*
retreats
after
battles
,
the
blow
dealt
at
Borodino
and
the
renewed
*NL*
retreat
,
the
burning
of
Moscow
,
the
capture
of
marauders
,
the
seizure
of
*NL*
transports
,
and
the
guerrilla
war
were
all
departures
from
the
rules
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
felt
this
,
and
from
the
time
he
took
up
the
correct
fencing
*NL*
attitude
in
Moscow
and
instead
of
his
opponent
's
rapier
saw
a
cudgel
*NL*
raised
above
his
head
,
he
did
not
cease
to
complain
to
Kutuzov
and
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
Alexander
that
the
war
was
being
carried
on
contrary
to
all
*NL*
the
rules
--
as
if
there
were
any
rules
for
killing
people
.
In
spite
of
*NL*
the
complaints
of
the
French
as
to
the
nonobservance
of
the
rules
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
some
highly
placed
Russians
it
seemed
rather
*NL*
disgraceful
to
fight
with
a
cudgel
and
they
wanted
to
assume
a
pose
en
*NL*
quarte
or
en
tierce
according
to
all
the
rules
,
and
to
make
an
adroit
*NL*
thrust
en
prime
,
and
so
on
--
the
cudgel
of
the
people
's
war
was
lifted
*NL*
with
all
its
menacing
and
majestic
strength
,
and
without
consulting
*NL*
anyone
's
tastes
or
rules
and
regardless
of
anything
else
,
it
rose
and
*NL*
fell
with
stupid
simplicity
,
but
consistently
,
and
belabored
the
French
*NL*
till
the
whole
invasion
had
perished
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
is
well
for
a
people
who
do
not
--
as
the
French
did
in
1813
--
*NL*
salute
according
to
all
the
rules
of
art
,
and
,
presenting
the
hilt
of
*NL*
their
rapier
gracefully
and
politely
,
hand
it
to
their
magnanimous
*NL*
conqueror
,
but
at
the
moment
of
trial
,
without
asking
what
rules
others
*NL*
have
adopted
in
similar
cases
,
simply
and
easily
pick
up
the
first
*NL*
cudgel
that
comes
to
hand
and
strike
with
it
till
the
feeling
of
*NL*
resentment
and
revenge
in
their
soul
yields
to
a
feeling
of
contempt
and
*NL*
compassion
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
most
obvious
and
advantageous
departures
from
the
so-called
*NL*
laws
of
war
is
the
action
of
scattered
groups
against
men
pressed
*NL*
together
in
a
mass
.
Such
action
always
occurs
in
wars
that
take
on
a
*NL*
national
character
.
In
such
actions
,
instead
of
two
crowds
opposing
each
*NL*
other
,
the
men
disperse
,
attack
singly
,
run
away
when
attacked
by
*NL*
stronger
forces
,
but
again
attack
when
opportunity
offers
.
This
was
done
*NL*
by
the
guerrillas
in
Spain
,
by
the
mountain
tribes
in
the
Caucasus
,
and
*NL*
by
the
Russians
in
1812
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
have
called
this
kind
of
war
``
guerrilla
warfare
''
and
assume
that
*NL*
by
so
calling
it
they
have
explained
its
meaning
.
But
such
a
war
does
*NL*
not
fit
in
under
any
rule
and
is
directly
opposed
to
a
well-known
rule
*NL*
of
tactics
which
is
accepted
as
infallible
.
That
rule
says
that
an
*NL*
attacker
should
concentrate
his
forces
in
order
to
be
stronger
than
his
*NL*
opponent
at
the
moment
of
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guerrilla
war
-LRB-
always
successful
,
as
history
shows
-RRB-
directly
infringes
*NL*
that
rule
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
contradiction
arises
from
the
fact
that
military
science
assumes
*NL*
the
strength
of
an
army
to
be
identical
with
its
numbers
.
Military
*NL*
science
says
that
the
more
troops
the
greater
the
strength
.
Les
gros
*NL*
bataillons
ont
toujours
raison
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Large
battalions
are
always
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
military
science
to
say
this
is
like
defining
momentum
in
mechanics
*NL*
by
reference
to
the
mass
only
:
stating
that
momenta
are
equal
or
unequal
*NL*
to
each
other
simply
because
the
masses
involved
are
equal
or
unequal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Momentum
-LRB-
quantity
of
motion
-RRB-
is
the
product
of
mass
and
velocity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
military
affairs
the
strength
of
an
army
is
the
product
of
its
mass
*NL*
and
some
unknown
x.
*NL*
*NL*
Military
science
,
seeing
in
history
innumerable
instances
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
the
size
of
any
army
does
not
coincide
with
its
strength
and
that
*NL*
small
detachments
defeat
larger
ones
,
obscurely
admits
the
existence
of
*NL*
this
unknown
factor
and
tries
to
discover
it
--
now
in
a
geometric
*NL*
formation
,
now
in
the
equipment
employed
,
now
,
and
most
usually
,
in
the
*NL*
genius
of
the
commanders
.
But
the
assignment
of
these
various
meanings
*NL*
to
the
factor
does
not
yield
results
which
accord
with
the
historic
*NL*
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
is
only
necessary
to
abandon
the
false
view
-LRB-
adopted
to
gratify
*NL*
the
``
heroes
''
-RRB-
of
the
efficacy
of
the
directions
issued
in
wartime
by
*NL*
commanders
,
in
order
to
find
this
unknown
quantity
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
unknown
quantity
is
the
spirit
of
the
army
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
*NL*
greater
or
lesser
readiness
to
fight
and
face
danger
felt
by
all
the
men
*NL*
composing
an
army
,
quite
independently
of
whether
they
are
,
or
are
not
,
*NL*
fighting
under
the
command
of
a
genius
,
in
two
--
or
three-line
formation
,
*NL*
with
cudgels
or
with
rifles
that
repeat
thirty
times
a
minute
.
Men
who
*NL*
want
to
fight
will
always
put
themselves
in
the
most
advantageous
*NL*
conditions
for
fighting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
an
army
is
the
factor
which
multiplied
by
the
mass
gives
*NL*
the
resulting
force
.
To
define
and
express
the
significance
of
this
*NL*
unknown
factor
--
the
spirit
of
an
army
--
is
a
problem
for
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
problem
is
only
solvable
if
we
cease
arbitrarily
to
substitute
for
*NL*
the
unknown
x
itself
the
conditions
under
which
that
force
becomes
*NL*
apparent
--
such
as
the
commands
of
the
general
,
the
equipment
employed
,
*NL*
and
so
on
--
mistaking
these
for
the
real
significance
of
the
factor
,
and
*NL*
if
we
recognize
this
unknown
quantity
in
its
entirety
as
being
the
*NL*
greater
or
lesser
desire
to
fight
and
to
face
danger
.
Only
then
,
*NL*
expressing
known
historic
facts
by
equations
and
comparing
the
relative
*NL*
significance
of
this
factor
,
can
we
hope
to
define
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
men
,
battalions
,
or
divisions
,
fighting
fifteen
men
,
battalions
,
or
*NL*
divisions
,
conquer
--
that
is
,
kill
or
take
captive
--
all
the
others
,
while
*NL*
themselves
losing
four
,
so
that
on
the
one
side
four
and
on
the
other
*NL*
fifteen
were
lost
.
Consequently
the
four
were
equal
to
the
fifteen
,
and
*NL*
therefore
4x
=
15y
.
Consequently
x/y
=
15/4
.
This
equation
does
not
give
*NL*
us
the
value
of
the
unknown
factor
but
gives
us
a
ratio
between
two
*NL*
unknowns
.
And
by
bringing
variously
selected
historic
units
-LRB-
battles
,
*NL*
campaigns
,
periods
of
war
-RRB-
into
such
equations
,
a
series
of
numbers
*NL*
could
be
obtained
in
which
certain
laws
should
exist
and
might
be
*NL*
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tactical
rule
that
an
army
should
act
in
masses
when
attacking
,
and
*NL*
in
smaller
groups
in
retreat
,
unconsciously
confirms
the
truth
that
the
*NL*
strength
of
an
army
depends
on
its
spirit
.
To
lead
men
forward
under
*NL*
fire
more
discipline
-LRB-
obtainable
only
by
movement
in
masses
-RRB-
is
needed
*NL*
than
is
needed
to
resist
attacks
.
But
this
rule
which
leaves
out
of
*NL*
account
the
spirit
of
the
army
continually
proves
incorrect
and
is
in
*NL*
particularly
striking
contrast
to
the
facts
when
some
strong
rise
or
*NL*
fall
in
the
spirit
of
the
troops
occurs
,
as
in
all
national
wars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
retreating
in
1812
--
though
according
to
tactics
they
should
*NL*
have
separated
into
detachments
to
defend
themselves
--
congregated
into
a
*NL*
mass
because
the
spirit
of
the
army
had
so
fallen
that
only
the
mass
*NL*
held
the
army
together
.
The
Russians
,
on
the
contrary
,
ought
according
*NL*
to
tactics
to
have
attacked
in
mass
,
but
in
fact
they
split
up
into
*NL*
small
units
,
because
their
spirit
had
so
risen
that
separate
*NL*
individuals
,
without
orders
,
dealt
blows
at
the
French
without
needing
*NL*
any
compulsion
to
induce
them
to
expose
themselves
to
hardships
and
*NL*
dangers
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
so-called
partisan
war
began
with
the
entry
of
the
French
into
*NL*
Smolensk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
partisan
warfare
had
been
officially
recognized
by
the
*NL*
government
,
thousands
of
enemy
stragglers
,
marauders
,
and
foragers
had
*NL*
been
destroyed
by
the
Cossacks
and
the
peasants
,
who
killed
them
off
as
*NL*
instinctively
as
dogs
worry
a
stray
mad
dog
to
death
.
Denis
Davydov
,
*NL*
with
his
Russian
instinct
,
was
the
first
to
recognize
the
value
of
this
*NL*
terrible
cudgel
which
regardless
of
the
rules
of
military
science
*NL*
destroyed
the
French
,
and
to
him
belongs
the
credit
for
taking
the
first
*NL*
step
toward
regularizing
this
method
of
warfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
August
24
Davydov
's
first
partisan
detachment
was
formed
and
then
*NL*
others
were
recognized
.
The
further
the
campaign
progressed
the
more
*NL*
numerous
these
detachments
became
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
irregulars
destroyed
the
great
army
piecemeal
.
They
gathered
the
*NL*
fallen
leaves
that
dropped
of
themselves
from
that
withered
tree
--
the
*NL*
French
army
--
and
sometimes
shook
that
tree
itself
.
By
October
,
when
the
*NL*
French
were
fleeing
toward
Smolensk
,
there
were
hundreds
of
such
*NL*
companies
,
of
various
sizes
and
characters
.
There
were
some
that
adopted
*NL*
all
the
army
methods
and
had
infantry
,
artillery
,
staffs
,
and
the
*NL*
comforts
of
life
.
Others
consisted
solely
of
Cossack
cavalry
.
There
were
*NL*
also
small
scratch
groups
of
foot
and
horse
,
and
groups
of
peasants
and
*NL*
landowners
that
remained
unknown
.
A
sacristan
commanded
one
party
which
*NL*
captured
several
hundred
prisoners
in
the
course
of
a
month
;
and
there
*NL*
was
Vasilisa
,
the
wife
of
a

slew

French

The
partisan
warfare
flamed
up
most
fiercely
in
the
latter
days
of
*NL*
October
.
Its
first
period
had
passed
:
when
the
partisans
themselves
,
*NL*
amazed
at
their
own
boldness
,
feared
every
minute
to
be
surrounded
and
*NL*
captured
by
the
French
,
and
hid
in
the
forests
without
unsaddling
,
*NL*
hardly
daring
to
dismount
and
always
expecting
to
be
pursued
.
By
the
end
*NL*
of
October
this
kind
of
warfare
had
taken
definite
shape
:
it
had
become
*NL*
clear
to
all
what
could
be
ventured
against
the
French
and
what
could
*NL*
not
.
Now
only
the
commanders
of
detachments
with
staffs
,
and
moving
*NL*
according
to
rules
at
a
distance
from
the
French
,
still
regarded
many
*NL*
things
as
impossible
.
The
small
bands
that
had
started
their
activities
*NL*
long
before
and
had
already
observed
the
French
closely
considered
*NL*
things
possible
which
the
commanders
of
the
big
detachments
did
not
dare
*NL*
to
contemplate
.
The
Cossacks
and
peasants
who
crept
in
among
the
French
*NL*
now
considered
everything
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
October
22
,
Denisov
-LRB-
who
was
one
of
the
irregulars
-RRB-
was
with
his
*NL*
group
at
the
height
of
the
guerrilla
enthusiasm
.
Since
early
morning
he
*NL*
and
his
party
had
been
on
the
move
.
All
day
long
he
had
been
watching
*NL*
from
the
forest
that
skirted
the
highroad
a
large
French
convoy
of
*NL*
cavalry
baggage
and
Russian
prisoners
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
army
,
which
--
as
was
learned
from
spies
and
prisoners
--
was
moving
under
a
*NL*
strong
escort
to
Smolensk
.
Besides
Denisov
and
Dolokhov
-LRB-
who
also
led
a
*NL*
small
party
and
moved
in
Denisov
's
vicinity
-RRB-
,
the
commanders
of
some
*NL*
large
divisions
with
staffs
also
knew
of
this
convoy
and
,
as
Denisov
*NL*
expressed
it
,
were
sharpening
their
teeth
for
it
.
Two
of
the
commanders
*NL*
of
large
parties
--
one
a
Pole
and
the
other
a
German
--
sent
invitations
to
*NL*
Denisov
almost
simultaneously
,
requesting
him
to
join
up
with
their
*NL*
divisions
to
attack
the
convoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
bwother
,
I
have
gwown
mustaches
myself
,
''
said
Denisov
on
reading
*NL*
these
documents
,
and
he
wrote
to
the
German
that
,
despite
his
heartfelt
*NL*
desire
to
serve
under
so
valiant
and
renowned
a
general
,
he
had
to
forgo
*NL*
that
pleasure
because
he
was
already
under
the
command
of
the
Polish
*NL*
general
.
To
the
Polish
general
he
replied
to
the
same
effect
,
informing
*NL*
him
that
he
was
already
under
the
command
of
the
German
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
arranged
matters
thus
,
Denisov
and
Dolokhov
intended
,
without
*NL*
reporting
matters
to
the
higher
command
,
to
attack
and
seize
that
convoy
*NL*
with
their
own
small
forces
.
On
October
22
it
was
moving
from
the
*NL*
village
of
Mikulino
to
that
of
Shamshevo
.
To
the
left
of
the
road
*NL*
between
Mikulino
and
Shamshevo
there
were
large
forests
,
extending
in
*NL*
some
places
up
to
the
road
itself
though
in
others
a
mile
or
more
back
*NL*
from
it
.
Through
these
forests
Denisov
and
his
party
rode
all
day
,
*NL*
sometimes
keeping
well
back
in
them
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
very
*NL*
edge
,
but
never
losing
sight
of
the
moving
French
.
That
morning
,
*NL*
Cossacks
of
Denisov
's
party
had
seized
and
carried
off
into
the
forest
*NL*
two
wagons
loaded
with
cavalry
saddles
,
which
had
stuck
in
the
mud
not
*NL*
far
from
Mikulino
where
the
forest
ran
close
to
the
road
.
Since
then
,
*NL*
and
until
evening
,
the
party
had
watched
the
movements
of
the
French
*NL*
without
attacking
.
It
was
necessary
to
let
the
French
reach
Shamshevo
*NL*
quietly
without
alarming
them
and
then
,
after
joining
Dolokhov
who
was
*NL*
to
come
that
evening
to
a
consultation
at
a
watchman
's
hut
in
the
forest
*NL*
less
than
a
mile
from
Shamshevo
,
to
surprise
the
French
at
dawn
,
falling
*NL*
like
an
avalanche
on
their
heads
from
two
sides
,
and
rout
and
capture
*NL*
them
all
at
one
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
rear
,
more
than
a
mile
from
Mikulino
where
the
forest
came
*NL*
right
up
to
the
road
,
six
Cossacks
were
posted
to
report
if
any
fresh
*NL*
columns
of
French
should
show
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
Shamshevo
,
Dolokhov
was
to
observe
the
road
in
the
same
way
,
to
*NL*
find
out
at
what
distance
there
were
other
French
troops
.
They
reckoned
*NL*
that
the
convoy
had
fifteen
hundred
men
.
Denisov
had
two
hundred
,
and
*NL*
Dolokhov
might
have
as
many
more
,
but
the
disparity
of
numbers
did
not
*NL*
deter
Denisov
.
All
that
he
now
wanted
to
know
was
what
troops
these
were
*NL*
and
to
learn
that
he
had
to
capture
a
``
tongue
''
--
that
is
,
a
man
from
the
*NL*
enemy
column
.
That
morning
's
attack
on
the
wagons
had
been
made
so
*NL*
hastily
that
the
Frenchmen
with
the
wagons
had
all
been
killed
;
only
a
*NL*
little
drummer
boy
had
been
taken
alive
,
and
as
he
was
a
straggler
he
*NL*
could
tell
them
nothing
definite
about
the
troops
in
that
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
considered
it
dangerous
to
make
a
second
attack
for
fear
of
*NL*
putting
the
whole
column
on
the
alert
,
so
he
sent
Tikhon
Shcherbaty
,
a
*NL*
peasant
of
his
party
,
to
Shamshevo
to
try
and
seize
at
least
one
of
the
*NL*
French
quartermasters
who
had
been
sent
on
in
advance
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
warm
rainy
autumn
day
.
The
sky
and
the
horizon
were
both
the
*NL*
color
of
muddy
water
.
At
times
a
sort
of
mist
descended
,
and
then
*NL*
suddenly
heavy
slanting
rain
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
in
a
felt
cloak
and
a
sheepskin
cap
from
which
the
rain
ran
down
*NL*
was
riding
a
thin
thoroughbred
horse
with
sunken
sides
.
Like
his
horse
,
*NL*
which
turned
its
head
and
laid
its
ears
back
,
he
shrank
from
the
driving
*NL*
rain
and
gazed
anxiously
before
him
.
His
thin
face
with
its
short
,
thick
*NL*
black
beard
looked
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
Denisov
rode
an
esaul
,
*
Denisov
's
fellow
worker
,
also
in
felt
*NL*
cloak
and
sheepskin
cap
,
and
riding
a
large
sleek
Don
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
A
captain
of
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Esaul
Lovayski
the
Third
was
a
tall
man
as
straight
as
an
arrow
,
pale
-
*NL*
faced
,
fair-haired
,
with
narrow
light
eyes
and
with
calm
self
-
*NL*
satisfaction
in
his
face
and
bearing
.
Though
it
was
impossible
to
say
in
*NL*
what
the
peculiarity
of
the
horse
and
rider
lay
,
yet
at
first
glance
at
*NL*
the
esaul
and
Denisov
one
saw
that
the
latter
was
wet
and
uncomfortable
*NL*
and
was
a
man
mounted
on
a
horse
,
while
looking
at
the
esaul
one
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
as
comfortable
and
as
much
at
ease
as
always
and
that
he
was
*NL*
not
a
man
who
had
mounted
a
horse
,
but
a
man
who
was
one
with
his
horse
,
*NL*
a
being
consequently
possessed
of
twofold
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
ahead
of
them
walked
a
peasant
guide
,
wet
to
the
skin
and
*NL*
wearing
a
gray
peasant
coat
and
a
white
knitted
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
behind
,
on
a
poor
,
small
,
lean
Kirghiz
mount
with
an
enormous
*NL*
tail
and
mane
and
a
bleeding
mouth
,
rode
a
young
officer
in
a
blue
*NL*
French
overcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
him
rode
an
hussar
,
with
a
boy
in
a
tattered
French
uniform
and
*NL*
blue
cap
behind
him
on
the
crupper
of
his
horse
.
The
boy
held
on
to
the
*NL*
hussar
with
cold
,
red
hands
,
and
raising
his
eyebrows
gazed
about
him
*NL*
with
surprise
.
This
was
the
French
drummer
boy
captured
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
them
along
the
narrow
,
sodden
,
cutup
forest
road
came
hussars
in
*NL*
threes
and
fours
,
and
then
Cossacks
:
some
in
felt
cloaks
,
some
in
French
*NL*
greatcoats
,
and
some
with
horsecloths
over
their
heads
.
The
horses
,
*NL*
being
drenched
by
the
rain
,
all
looked
black
whether
chestnut
or
bay
.
*NL*
Their
necks
,
with
their
wet
,
close-clinging
manes
,
looked
strangely
*NL*
thin
.
Steam
rose
from
them
.
Clothes
,
saddles
,
reins
,
were
all
wet
,
*NL*
slippery
,
and
sodden
,
like
the
ground
and
the
fallen
leaves
that
strewed
*NL*
the
road
.
The
men
sat
huddled
up
trying
not
to
stir
,
so
as
to
warm
the
*NL*
water
that
had
trickled
to
their
bodies
and
not
admit
the
fresh
cold
*NL*
water
that
was
leaking
in
under
their
seats
,
their
knees
,
and
at
the
*NL*
back
of
their
necks
.
In
the
midst
of
the
outspread
line
of
Cossacks
two
*NL*
wagons
,
drawn
by
French
horses
and
by
saddled
Cossack
horses
that
had
*NL*
been
hitched
on
in
front
,
rumbled
over
the
tree
stumps
and
branches
and
*NL*
splashed
through
the
water
that
lay
in
the
ruts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
's
horse
swerved
aside
to
avoid
a
pool
in
the
track
and
bumped
*NL*
his
rider
's
knee
against
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
devil
!
''
exclaimed
Denisov
angrily
,
and
showing
his
teeth
he
*NL*
struck
his
horse
three
times
with
his
whip
,
splashing
himself
and
his
*NL*
comrades
with
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
was
out
of
sorts
both
because
of
the
rain
and
also
from
hunger
*NL*
-LRB-
none
of
them
had
eaten
anything
since
morning
-RRB-
,
and
yet
more
because
he
*NL*
still
had
no
news
from
Dolokhov
and
the
man
sent
to
capture
a
``
tongue
''
*NL*
had
not
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
'll
hardly
be
another
such
chance
to
fall
on
a
transport
as
today
.
*NL*
It
's
too
risky
to
attack
them
by
oneself
,
and
if
we
put
it
off
till
*NL*
another
day
one
of
the
big
guerrilla
detachments
will
snatch
the
prey
*NL*
from
under
our
noses
,
''
thought
Denisov
,
continually
peering
forward
,
*NL*
hoping
to
see
a
messenger
from
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
to
a
path
in
the
forest
along
which
he
could
see
far
to
the
*NL*
right
,
Denisov
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
someone
coming
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
esaul
looked
in
the
direction
Denisov
indicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
,
an
officer
and
a
Cossack
.
But
it
is
not
presupposable
*NL*
that
it
is
the
lieutenant
colonel
himself
,
''
said
the
esaul
,
who
was
fond
*NL*
of
using
words
the
Cossacks
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
approaching
riders
having
descended
a
decline
were
no
longer
*NL*
visible
,
but
they
reappeared
a
few
minutes
later
.
In
front
,
at
a
weary
*NL*
gallop
and
using
his
leather
whip
,
rode
an
officer
,
disheveled
and
*NL*
drenched
,
whose
trousers
had
worked
up
to
above
his
knees
.
Behind
him
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
stirrups
,
trotted
a
Cossack
.
The
officer
,
a
very
young
*NL*
lad
with
a
broad
rosy
face
and
keen
merry
eyes
,
galloped
up
to
Denisov
*NL*
and
handed
him
a
sodden
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
general
,
''
said
the
officer
.
``
Please
excuse
its
not
being
quite
*NL*
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
frowning
,
took
the
envelope
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
they
kept
telling
us
:
`
It
's
dangerous
,
it
's
dangerous
,
'
''
said
*NL*
the
officer
,
addressing
the
esaul
while
Denisov
was
reading
the
*NL*
dispatch
.
``
But
Komarov
and
I
''
--
he
pointed
to
the
Cossack
--
``
were
*NL*
prepared
.
We
have
each
of
us
two
pistols
...
But
what
's
this
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
noticing
the
French
drummer
boy
.
``
A
prisoner
?
You
've
already
been
in
*NL*
action
?
May
I
speak
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wostov
!
Petya
!
''
exclaimed
Denisov
,
having
run
through
the
dispatch
.
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
say
who
you
were
?
''
and
turning
with
a
smile
he
held
out
*NL*
his
hand
to
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
was
Petya
Rostov
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
Petya
had
been
preparing
himself
to
behave
with
Denisov
as
*NL*
befitted
a
grownup
man
and
an
officer
--
without
hinting
at
their
previous
*NL*
acquaintance
.
But
as
soon
as
Denisov
smiled
at
him
Petya
brightened
up
,
*NL*
blushed
with
pleasure
,
forgot
the
official
manner
he
had
been
*NL*
rehearsing
,
and
began
telling
him
how
he
had
already
been
in
a
battle
*NL*
near
Vyazma
and
how
a
certain
hussar
had
distinguished
himself
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
''
Denisov
interrupted
him
,
and
his
face
*NL*
again
assumed
its
anxious
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michael
Feoklitych
,
''
said
he
to
the
esaul
,
``
this
is
again
fwom
that
*NL*
German
,
you
know
.
He
''
--
he
indicated
Petya
--
``
is
serving
under
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Denisov
told
the
esaul
that
the
dispatch
just
delivered
was
a
*NL*
repetition
of
the
German
general
's
demand
that
he
should
join
forces
*NL*
with
him
for
an
attack
on
the
transport
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
do
n't
take
it
tomowwow
,
he
'll
snatch
it
fwom
under
our
noses
,
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Denisov
was
talking
to
the
esaul
,
Petya
--
abashed
by
Denisov
's
cold
*NL*
tone
and
supposing
that
it
was
due
to
the
condition
of
his
trousers
--
*NL*
furtively
tried
to
pull
them
down
under
his
greatcoat
so
that
no
one
*NL*
should
notice
it
,
while
maintaining
as
martial
an
air
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
there
be
any
orders
,
your
honor
?
''
he
asked
Denisov
,
holding
his
*NL*
hand
at
the
salute
and
resuming
the
game
of
adjutant
and
general
for
*NL*
which
he
had
prepared
himself
,
``
or
shall
I
remain
with
your
honor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Orders
?
''
Denisov
repeated
thoughtfully
.
``
But
can
you
stay
till
*NL*
tomowwow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
...
May
I
stay
with
you
?
''
cried
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
just
what
did
the
genewal
tell
you
?
To
weturn
at
once
?
''
asked
*NL*
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
gave
me
no
instructions
.
I
think
I
could
?
''
he
returned
,
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
wight
,
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
his
men
he
directed
a
party
to
go
on
to
the
halting
place
*NL*
arranged
near
the
watchman
's
hut
in
the
forest
,
and
told
the
officer
on
*NL*
the
Kirghiz
horse
-LRB-
who
performed
the
duties
of
an
adjutant
-RRB-
to
go
and
*NL*
find
out
where
Dolokhov
was
and
whether
he
would
come
that
evening
.
*NL*
Denisov
himself
intended
going
with
the
esaul
and
Petya
to
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
forest
where
it
reached
out
to
Shamshevo
,
to
have
a
look
at
the
part
*NL*
of
the
French
bivouac
they
were
to
attack
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
old
fellow
,
''
said
he
to
the
peasant
guide
,
``
lead
us
to
*NL*
Shamshevo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
Petya
,
and
the
esaul
,
accompanied
by
some
Cossacks
and
the
*NL*
hussar
who
had
the
prisoner
,
rode
to
the
left
across
a
ravine
to
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
forest
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
had
stopped
,
and
only
the
mist
was
falling
and
drops
from
the
*NL*
trees
.
Denisov
,
the
esaul
,
and
Petya
rode
silently
,
following
the
*NL*
peasant
in
the
knitted
cap
who
,
stepping
lightly
with
outturned
toes
and
*NL*
moving
noiselessly
in
his
bast
shoes
over
the
roots
and
wet
leaves
,
*NL*
silently
led
them
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ascended
an
incline
,
stopped
,
looked
about
him
,
and
advanced
to
where
*NL*
the
screen
of
trees
was
less
dense
.
On
reaching
a
large
oak
tree
that
*NL*
had
not
yet
shed
its
leaves
,
he
stopped
and
beckoned
mysteriously
to
*NL*
them
with
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
and
Petya
rode
up
to
him
.
From
the
spot
where
the
peasant
was
*NL*
standing
they
could
see
the
French
.
Immediately
beyond
the
forest
,
on
a
*NL*
downward
slope
,
lay
a
field
of
spring
rye
.
To
the
right
,
beyond
a
steep
*NL*
ravine
,
was
a
small
village
and
a
landowner
's
house
with
a
broken
roof
.
*NL*
In
the
village
,
in
the
house
,
in
the
garden
,
by
the
well
,
by
the
pond
,
*NL*
over
all
the
rising
ground
,
and
all
along
the
road
uphill
from
the
*NL*
bridge
leading
to
the
village
,
not
more
than
five
hundred
yards
away
,
*NL*
crowds
of
men
could
be
seen
through
the
shimmering
mist
.
Their
un
-
*NL*
Russian
shouting
at
their
horses
which
were
straining
uphill
with
the
*NL*
carts
,
and
their
calls
to
one
another
,
could
be
clearly
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bwing
the
prisoner
here
,
''
said
Denisov
in
a
low
voice
,
not
taking
his
*NL*
eyes
off
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Cossack
dismounted
,
lifted
the
boy
down
,
and
took
him
to
Denisov
.
*NL*
Pointing
to
the
French
troops
,
Denisov
asked
him
what
these
and
those
of
*NL*
them
were
.
The
boy
,
thrusting
his
cold
hands
into
his
pockets
and
*NL*
lifting
his
eyebrows
,
looked
at
Denisov
in
affright
,
but
in
spite
of
an
*NL*
evident
desire
to
say
all
he
knew
gave
confused
answers
,
merely
*NL*
assenting
to
everything
Denisov
asked
him
.
Denisov
turned
away
from
him
*NL*
frowning
and
addressed
the
esaul
,
conveying
his
own
conjectures
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
,
rapidly
turning
his
head
,
looked
now
at
the
drummer
boy
,
now
at
*NL*
Denisov
,
now
at
the
esaul
,
and
now
at
the
French
in
the
village
and
*NL*
along
the
road
,
trying
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
Dolokhov
comes
or
not
,
we
must
seize
it
,
eh
?
''
said
Denisov
with
*NL*
a
merry
sparkle
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
suitable
spot
,
''
said
the
esaul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
send
the
infantwy
down
by
the
swamps
,
''
Denisov
continued
.
*NL*
``
They
'll
cweep
up
to
the
garden
;
you
'll
wide
up
fwom
there
with
the
*NL*
Cossacks
''
--
he
pointed
to
a
spot
in
the
forest
beyond
the
village
--
``
and
I
*NL*
with
my
hussars
fwom
here
.
And
at
the
signal
shot
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hollow
is
impassable
--
there
's
a
swamp
there
,
''
said
the
esaul
.
``
The
*NL*
horses
would
sink
.
We
must
ride
round
more
to
the
left
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
in
undertones
the
crack
of
a
shot
sounded
from
*NL*
the
low
ground
by
the
pond
,
a
puff
of
white
smoke
appeared
,
then
*NL*
another
,
and
the
sound
of
hundreds
of
seemingly
merry
French
voices
*NL*
shouting
together
came
up
from
the
slope
.
For
a
moment
Denisov
and
the
*NL*
esaul
drew
back
.
They
were
so
near
that
they
thought
they
were
the
cause
*NL*
of
the
firing
and
shouting
.
But
the
firing
and
shouting
did
not
relate
*NL*
to
them
.
Down
below
,
a
man
wearing
something
red
was
running
through
the
*NL*
marsh
.
The
French
were
evidently
firing
and
shouting
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
our
Tikhon
,
''
said
the
esaul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
!
It
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wascal
!
''
said
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
get
away
!
''
said
the
esaul
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
whom
they
called
Tikhon
,
having
run
to
the
stream
,
plunged
in
so
*NL*
that
the
water
splashed
in
the
air
,
and
,
having
disappeared
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
scrambled
out
on
all
fours
,
all
black
with
the
wet
,
and
ran
on
.
*NL*
The
French
who
had
been
pursuing
him
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smart
,
that
!
''
said
the
esaul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
beast
!
''
said
Denisov
with
his
former
look
of
vexation
.
``
What
has
*NL*
he
been
doing
all
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
asked
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
our
plastun
.
I
sent
him
to
capture
a
`
tongue
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Petya
,
nodding
at
the
first
words
Denisov
uttered
as
if
*NL*
he
understood
it
all
,
though
he
really
did
not
understand
anything
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
Shcherbaty
was
one
of
the
most
indispensable
men
in
their
band
.
*NL*
He
was
a
peasant
from
Pokrovsk
,
near
the
river
Gzhat
.
When
Denisov
had
*NL*
come
to
Pokrovsk
at
the
beginning
of
his
operations
and
had
as
usual
*NL*
summoned
the
village
elder
and
asked
him
what
he
knew
about
the
French
,
*NL*
the
elder
,
as
though
shielding
himself
,
had
replied
,
as
all
village
*NL*
elders
did
,
that
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
them
.
But
*NL*
when
Denisov
explained
that
his
purpose
was
to
kill
the
French
,
and
*NL*
asked
if
no
French
had
strayed
that
way
,
the
elder
replied
that
some
*NL*
``
more-orderers
''
had
really
been
at
their
village
,
but
that
Tikhon
*NL*
Shcherbaty
was
the
only
man
who
dealt
with
such
matters
.
Denisov
had
*NL*
Tikhon
called
and
,
having
praised
him
for
his
activity
,
said
a
few
words
*NL*
in
the
elder
's
presence
about
loyalty
to
the
Tsar
and
the
country
and
*NL*
the
hatred
of
the
French
that
all
sons
of
the
fatherland
should
cherish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
do
the
French
any
harm
,
''
said
Tikhon
,
evidently
frightened
by
*NL*
Denisov
's
words
.
``
We
only
fooled
about
with
the
lads
for
fun
,
you
know
!
*NL*
We
killed
a
score
or
so
of
`
more-orderers
,
'
but
we
did
no
harm
else
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
when
Denisov
had
left
Pokrovsk
,
having
quite
forgotten
about
*NL*
this
peasant
,
it
was
reported
to
him
that
Tikhon
had
attached
himself
to
*NL*
their
party
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
it
.
Denisov
gave
*NL*
orders
to
let
him
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
,
who
at
first
did
rough
work
,
laying
campfires
,
fetching
water
,
*NL*
flaying
dead
horses
,
and
so
on
,
soon
showed
a
great
liking
and
aptitude
*NL*
for
partisan
warfare
.
At
night
he
would
go
out
for
booty
and
always
*NL*
brought
back
French
clothing
and
weapons
,
and
when
told
to
would
bring
*NL*
in
French
captives
also
.
Denisov
then
relieved
him
from
drudgery
and
*NL*
began
taking
him
with
him
when
he
went
out
on
expeditions
and
had
him
*NL*
enrolled
among
the
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
did
not
like
riding
,
and
always
went
on
foot
,
never
lagging
*NL*
behind
the
cavalry
.
He
was
armed
with
a
musketoon
-LRB-
which
he
carried
*NL*
rather
as
a
joke
-RRB-
,
a
pike
and
an
ax
,
which
latter
he
used
as
a
wolf
uses
*NL*
its
teeth
,
with
equal
ease
picking
fleas
out
of
its
fur
or
crunching
*NL*
thick
bones
.
Tikhon
with
equal
accuracy
would
split
logs
with
blows
at
*NL*
arm
's
length
,
or
holding
the
head
of
the
ax
would
cut
thin
little
pegs
*NL*
or
carve
spoons
.
In
Denisov
's
party
he
held
a
peculiar
and
exceptional
*NL*
position
.
When
anything
particularly
difficult
or
nasty
had
to
be
done
--
*NL*
to
push
a
cart
out
of
the
mud
with
one
's
shoulders
,
pull
a
horse
out
of
*NL*
a
swamp
by
its
tail
,
skin
it
,
slink
in
among
the
French
,
or
walk
more
*NL*
than
thirty
miles
in
a
day
--
everybody
pointed
laughingly
at
Tikhon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
hurt
that
devil
--
he
's
as
strong
as
a
horse
!
''
they
said
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
a
Frenchman
Tikhon
was
trying
to
capture
fired
a
pistol
at
him
and
*NL*
shot
him
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
back
.
That
wound
-LRB-
which
Tikhon
*NL*
treated
only
with
internal
and
external
applications
of
vodka
-RRB-
was
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
liveliest
jokes
by
the
whole
detachment
--
jokes
in
which
*NL*
Tikhon
readily
joined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
mate
!
Never
again
?
Gave
you
a
twist
?
''
the
Cossacks
would
banter
*NL*
him
.
And
Tikhon
,
purposely
writhing
and
making
faces
,
pretended
to
be
*NL*
angry
and
swore
at
the
French
with
the
funniest
curses
.
The
only
effect
*NL*
of
this
incident
on
Tikhon
was
that
after
being
wounded
he
seldom
*NL*
brought
in
prisoners
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
bravest
and
most
useful
man
in
the
party
.
No
one
found
more
*NL*
opportunities
for
attacking
,
no
one
captured
or
killed
more
Frenchmen
,
*NL*
and
consequently
he
was
made
the
buffoon
of
all
the
Cossacks
and
hussars
*NL*
and
willingly
accepted
that
role
.
Now
he
had
been
sent
by
Denisov
*NL*
overnight
to
Shamshevo
to
capture
a
``
tongue
.
''
But
whether
because
he
had
*NL*
not
been
content
to
take
only
one
Frenchman
or
because
he
had
slept
*NL*
through
the
night
,
he
had
crept
by
day
into
some
bushes
right
among
the
*NL*
French
and
,
as
Denisov
had
witnessed
from
above
,
had
been
detected
by
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
After
talking
for
some
time
with
the
esaul
about
next
day
's
attack
,
*NL*
which
now
,
seeing
how
near
they
were
to
the
French
,
he
seemed
to
have
*NL*
definitely
decided
on
,
Denisov
turned
his
horse
and
rode
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
lad
,
we
'll
go
and
get
dwy
,
''
he
said
to
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
the
watchhouse
Denisov
stopped
,
peering
into
the
*NL*
forest
.
Among
the
trees
a
man
with
long
legs
and
long
,
swinging
arms
,
*NL*
wearing
a
short
jacket
,
bast
shoes
,
and
a
Kazan
hat
,
was
approaching
*NL*
with
long
,
light
steps
.
He
had
a
musketoon
over
his
shoulder
and
an
ax
*NL*
stuck
in
his
girdle
.
When
he
espied
Denisov
he
hastily
threw
something
*NL*
into
the
bushes
,
removed
his
sodden
hat
by
its
floppy
brim
,
and
*NL*
approached
his
commander
.
It
was
Tikhon
.
His
wrinkled
and
pockmarked
*NL*
face
and
narrow
little
eyes
beamed
with
self-satisfied
merriment
.
He
*NL*
lifted
his
head
high
and
gazed
at
Denisov
as
if
repressing
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
did
you
disappear
to
?
''
inquired
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
I
disappear
to
?
I
went
to
get
Frenchmen
,
''
answered
Tikhon
*NL*
boldly
and
hurriedly
,
in
a
husky
but
melodious
bass
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
push
yourself
in
there
by
daylight
?
You
ass
!
Well
,
why
*NL*
have
n't
you
taken
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
took
one
all
right
,
''
said
Tikhon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
took
him
first
thing
at
dawn
,
''
Tikhon
continued
,
spreading
*NL*
out
his
flat
feet
with
outturned
toes
in
their
bast
shoes
.
``
I
took
him
*NL*
into
the
forest
.
Then
I
see
he
's
no
good
and
think
I
'll
go
and
fetch
a
*NL*
likelier
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
?
...
What
a
wogue
--
it
's
just
as
I
thought
,
''
said
Denisov
to
the
*NL*
esaul
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
bwing
that
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
good
of
bringing
him
?
''
Tikhon
interrupted
hastily
and
*NL*
angrily
--
``
that
one
would
n't
have
done
for
you
.
As
if
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
sort
you
want
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
bwute
you
are
!
...
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
for
another
one
,
''
Tikhon
continued
,
``
and
I
crept
like
this
*NL*
through
the
wood
and
lay
down
.
''
-LRB-
He
suddenly
lay
down
on
his
stomach
*NL*
with
a
supple
movement
to
show
how
he
had
done
it
.
-RRB-
``
One
turned
up
and
I
*NL*
grabbed
him
,
like
this
.
''
-LRB-
He
jumped
up
quickly
and
lightly
.
-RRB-
''
`
Come
*NL*
along
to
the
colonel
,
'
I
said
.
He
starts
yelling
,
and
suddenly
there
*NL*
were
four
of
them
.
They
rushed
at
me
with
their
little
swords
.
So
I
went
*NL*
for
them
with
my
ax
,
this
way
:
`
What
are
you
up
to
?
'
says
I.
`
Christ
be
*NL*
with
you
!
'
''
shouted
Tikhon
,
waving
his
arms
with
an
angry
scowl
and
*NL*
throwing
out
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
saw
from
the
hill
how
you
took
to
your
heels
through
the
*NL*
puddles
!
''
said
the
esaul
,
screwing
up
his
glittering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
badly
wanted
to
laugh
,
but
noticed
that
they
all
refrained
from
*NL*
laughing
.
He
turned
his
eyes
rapidly
from
Tikhon
's
face
to
the
esaul
's
*NL*
and
Denisov
's
,
unable
to
make
out
what
it
all
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
play
the
fool
!
''
said
Denisov
,
coughing
angrily
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
*NL*
bwing
the
first
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
scratched
his
back
with
one
hand
and
his
head
with
the
other
,
*NL*
then
suddenly
his
whole
face
expanded
into
a
beaming
,
foolish
grin
,
*NL*
disclosing
a
gap
where
he
had
lost
a
tooth
-LRB-
that
was
why
he
was
called
*NL*
Shcherbaty
--
the
gap-toothed
-RRB-
.
Denisov
smiled
,
and
Petya
burst
into
a
*NL*
peal
of
merry
laughter
in
which
Tikhon
himself
joined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
he
was
a
regular
good-for-nothing
,
''
said
Tikhon
.
``
The
clothes
*NL*
on
him
--
poor
stuff
!
How
could
I
bring
him
?
And
so
rude
,
your
honor
!
Why
,
*NL*
he
says
:
`
I
'm
a
general
's
son
myself
,
I
wo
n't
go
!
'
he
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
bwute
!
''
said
Denisov
.
``
I
wanted
to
question
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
questioned
him
,
''
said
Tikhon
.
``
He
said
he
did
n't
know
much
.
*NL*
`
There
are
a
lot
of
us
,
'
he
says
,
`
but
all
poor
stuff
--
only
soldiers
in
*NL*
name
,
'
he
says
.
`
Shout
loud
at
them
,
'
he
says
,
`
and
you
'll
take
them
*NL*
all
,
'
''
Tikhon
concluded
,
looking
cheerfully
and
resolutely
into
*NL*
Denisov
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
a
hundwed
sharp
lashes
--
that
'll
teach
you
to
play
the
*NL*
fool
!
''
said
Denisov
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
angry
?
''
remonstrated
Tikhon
,
``
just
as
if
I
'd
never
seen
*NL*
your
Frenchmen
!
Only
wait
till
it
gets
dark
and
I
'll
fetch
you
any
of
*NL*
them
you
want
--
three
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
go
,
''
said
Denisov
,
and
rode
all
the
way
to
the
watchhouse
*NL*
in
silence
and
frowning
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tikhon
followed
behind
and
Petya
heard
the
Cossacks
laughing
with
him
*NL*
and
at
him
,
about
some
pair
of
boots
he
had
thrown
into
the
bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
fit
of
laughter
that
had
seized
him
at
Tikhon
's
words
and
smile
*NL*
had
passed
and
Petya
realized
for
a
moment
that
this
Tikhon
had
killed
a
*NL*
man
,
he
felt
uneasy
.
He
looked
round
at
the
captive
drummer
boy
and
felt
*NL*
a
pang
in
his
heart
.
But
this
uneasiness
lasted
only
a
moment
.
He
felt
*NL*
it
necessary
to
hold
his
head
higher
,
to
brace
himself
,
and
to
question
*NL*
the
esaul
with
an
air
of
importance
about
tomorrow
's
undertaking
,
that
*NL*
he
might
not
be
unworthy
of
the
company
in
which
he
found
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
who
had
been
sent
to
inquire
met
Denisov
on
the
way
with
the
*NL*
news
that
Dolokhov
was
soon
coming
and
that
all
was
well
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
at
once
cheered
up
and
,
calling
Petya
to
him
,
said
:
``
Well
,
tell
*NL*
me
about
yourself
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
,
having
left
his
people
after
their
departure
from
Moscow
,
joined
*NL*
his
regiment
and
was
soon
taken
as
orderly
by
a
general
commanding
a
*NL*
large
guerrilla
detachment
.
From
the
time
he
received
his
commission
,
*NL*
and
especially
since
he
had
joined
the
active
army
and
taken
part
in
the
*NL*
battle
of
Vyazma
,
Petya
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
blissful
*NL*
excitement
at
being
grown-up
and
in
a
perpetual
ecstatic
hurry
not
to
*NL*
miss
any
chance
to
do
something
really
heroic
.
He
was
highly
delighted
*NL*
with
what
he
saw
and
experienced
in
the
army
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
*NL*
always
seemed
to
him
that
the
really
heroic
exploits
were
being
*NL*
performed
just
where
he
did
not
happen
to
be
.
And
he
was
always
in
a
*NL*
hurry
to
get
where
he
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
on
the
twenty-first
of
October
his
general
expressed
a
wish
to
send
*NL*
somebody
to
Denisov
's
detachment
,
Petya
begged
so
piteously
to
be
sent
*NL*
that
the
general
could
not
refuse
.
But
when
dispatching
him
he
recalled
*NL*
Petya
's
mad
action
at
the
battle
of
Vyazma
,
where
instead
of
riding
by
*NL*
the
road
to
the
place
to
which
he
had
been
sent
,
he
had
galloped
to
the
*NL*
advanced
line
under
the
fire
of
the
French
and
had
there
twice
fired
his
*NL*
pistol
.
So
now
the
general
explicitly
forbade
his
taking
part
in
any
*NL*
action
whatever
of
Denisov
's
.
That
was
why
Petya
had
blushed
and
grown
*NL*
confused
when
Denisov
asked
him
whether
he
could
stay
.
Before
they
had
*NL*
ridden
to
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
Petya
had
considered
he
must
carry
*NL*
out
his
instructions
strictly
and
return
at
once
.
But
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
French
and
saw
Tikhon
and
learned
that
there
would
certainly
be
an
*NL*
attack
that
night
,
he
decided
,
with
the
rapidity
with
which
young
people
*NL*
change
their
views
,
that
the
general
,
whom
he
had
greatly
respected
till
*NL*
then
,
was
a
rubbishy
German
,
that
Denisov
was
a
hero
,
the
esaul
a
hero
,
*NL*
and
Tikhon
a
hero
too
,
and
that
it
would
be
shameful
for
him
to
leave
*NL*
them
at
a
moment
of
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
growing
dusk
when
Denisov
,
Petya
,
and
the
esaul
rode
up
*NL*
to
the
watchhouse
.
In
the
twilight
saddled
horses
could
be
seen
,
and
*NL*
Cossacks
and
hussars
who
had
rigged
up
rough
shelters
in
the
glade
and
*NL*
were
kindling
glowing
fires
in
a
hollow
of
the
forest
where
the
French
*NL*
could
not
see
the
smoke
.
In
the
passage
of
the
small
watchhouse
a
*NL*
Cossack
with
sleeves
rolled
up
was
chopping
some
mutton
.
In
the
room
*NL*
three
officers
of
Denisov
's
band
were
converting
a
door
into
a
tabletop
.
*NL*
Petya
took
off
his
wet
clothes
,
gave
them
to
be
dried
,
and
at
once
began
*NL*
helping
the
officers
to
fix
up
the
dinner
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
the
table
was
ready
and
a
napkin
spread
on
it
.
On
the
*NL*
table
were
vodka
,
a
flask
of
rum
,
white
bread
,
roast
mutton
,
and
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
at
table
with
the
officers
and
tearing
the
fat
savory
mutton
*NL*
with
his
hands
,
down
which
the
grease
trickled
,
Petya
was
in
an
ecstatic
*NL*
childish
state
of
love
for
all
men
,
and
consequently
of
confidence
that
*NL*
others
loved
him
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
what
do
you
think
,
Vasili
Dmitrich
?
''
said
he
to
Denisov
.
``
It
's
*NL*
all
right
my
staying
a
day
with
you
?
''
And
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
*NL*
answered
his
own
question
:
``
You
see
I
was
told
to
find
out
--
well
,
I
am
*NL*
finding
out
...
Only
do
let
me
into
the
very
...
into
the
chief
...
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
a
reward
...
But
I
want
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
clenched
his
teeth
and
looked
around
,
throwing
back
his
head
and
*NL*
flourishing
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
the
vewy
chief
...
''
Denisov
repeated
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
,
please
let
me
command
something
,
so
that
I
may
really
command
...
''
*NL*
Petya
went
on
.
``
What
would
it
be
to
you
?
...
Oh
,
you
want
a
knife
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
turning
to
an
officer
who
wished
to
cut
himself
a
piece
of
mutton
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
handed
him
his
clasp
knife
.
The
officer
admired
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
keep
it
.
I
have
several
like
it
,
''
said
Petya
,
blushing
.
*NL*
``
Heavens
!
I
was
quite
forgetting
!
''
he
suddenly
cried
.
``
I
have
some
*NL*
raisins
,
fine
ones
;
you
know
,
seedless
ones
.
We
have
a
new
sutler
and
he
*NL*
has
such
capital
things
.
I
bought
ten
pounds
.
I
am
used
to
something
*NL*
sweet
.
Would
you
like
some
?
...
''
and
Petya
ran
out
into
the
passage
to
*NL*
his
Cossack
and
brought
back
some
bags
which
contained
about
five
pounds
*NL*
of
raisins
.
``
Have
some
,
gentlemen
,
have
some
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
a
coffeepot
,
do
n't
you
?
''
he
asked
the
esaul
.
``
I
bought
a
*NL*
capital
one
from
our
sutler
!
He
has
splendid
things
.
And
he
's
very
*NL*
honest
,
that
's
the
chief
thing
.
I
'll
be
sure
to
send
it
to
you
.
Or
*NL*
perhaps
your
flints
are
giving
out
,
or
are
worn
out
--
that
happens
*NL*
sometimes
,
you
know
.
I
have
brought
some
with
me
,
here
they
are
''
--
and
he
*NL*
showed
a
bag
--
``
a
hundred
flints
.
I
bought
them
very
cheap
.
Please
take
*NL*
as
many
as
you
want
,
or
all
if
you
like
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
,
dismayed
lest
he
had
said
too
much
,
Petya
stopped
and
*NL*
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
remember
whether
he
had
not
done
anything
else
that
was
*NL*
foolish
.
And
running
over
the
events
of
the
day
he
remembered
the
French
*NL*
drummer
boy
.
``
It
's
capital
for
us
here
,
but
what
of
him
?
Where
have
they
*NL*
put
him
?
Have
they
fed
him
?
Have
n't
they
hurt
his
feelings
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
But
having
caught
himself
saying
too
much
about
the
flints
,
he
was
now
*NL*
afraid
to
speak
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
ask
,
''
he
thought
,
``
but
they
'll
say
:
`
He
's
a
boy
himself
and
so
*NL*
he
pities
the
boy
.
'
I
'll
show
them
tomorrow
whether
I
'm
a
boy
.
Will
it
*NL*
seem
odd
if
I
ask
?
''
Petya
thought
.
``
Well
,
never
mind
!
''
and
immediately
,
*NL*
blushing
and
looking
anxiously
at
the
officers
to
see
if
they
appeared
*NL*
ironical
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
call
in
that
boy
who
was
taken
prisoner
and
give
him
something
to
*NL*
eat
?
...
Perhaps
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
a
poor
little
fellow
,
''
said
Denisov
,
who
evidently
saw
*NL*
nothing
shameful
in
this
reminder
.
``
Call
him
in
.
His
name
is
Vincent
*NL*
Bosse
.
Have
him
fetched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
him
,
''
said
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
call
him
.
A
poor
little
fellow
,
''
Denisov
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
was
standing
at
the
door
when
Denisov
said
this
.
He
slipped
in
*NL*
between
the
officers
,
came
close
to
Denisov
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
kiss
you
,
dear
old
fellow
!
Oh
,
how
fine
,
how
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
kissed
Denisov
he
ran
out
of
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bosse
!
Vincent
!
''
Petya
cried
,
stopping
outside
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
want
,
sir
?
''
asked
a
voice
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
replied
that
he
wanted
the
French
lad
who
had
been
captured
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Vesenny
?
''
said
a
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vincent
,
the
boy
's
name
,
had
already
been
changed
by
the
Cossacks
into
*NL*
Vesenny
-LRB-
vernal
-RRB-
and
into
Vesenya
by
the
peasants
and
soldiers
.
In
both
*NL*
these
adaptations
the
reference
to
spring
-LRB-
vesna
-RRB-
matched
the
impression
*NL*
made
by
the
young
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
warming
himself
there
by
the
bonfire
.
Ho
,
Vesenya
!
Vesenya
!
--
*NL*
Vesenny
!
''
laughing
voices
were
heard
calling
to
one
another
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
smart
lad
,
''
said
an
hussar
standing
near
Petya
.
``
We
gave
him
*NL*
something
to
eat
a
while
ago
.
He
was
awfully
hungry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
bare
feet
splashing
through
the
mud
was
heard
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
the
drummer
boy
came
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
c'est
vous
!
''
said
Petya
.
``
Voulez-vous
manger
?
N'ayez
pas
peur
,
on
*NL*
ne
vous
fera
pas
de
mal

''
*
he
added
shyly
and
affectionately
,
touching
*NL*
the
boy
's
hand
.
``
Entrez
,
entrez

``
Ah

it

you

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Merci

monsieur
,
''
*
said
the
drummer
boy
in
a
trembling
almost
childish
*NL*
voice
,
and
he
began
scraping
his
dirty
feet
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
many
things
Petya
wanted
to
say
to
the
drummer
boy
,
but
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
.
He
stood
irresolutely
beside
him
in
the
passage
.
Then
in
*NL*
the
darkness
he
took
the
boy
's
hand
and
pressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
come
in
!
''
he
repeated
in
a
gentle
whisper
.
``
Oh
,
what
can
I
do
*NL*
for
him
?
''
he
thought
,
and
opening
the
door
he
let
the
boy
pass
in
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
boy
had
entered
the
hut
,
Petya
sat
down
at
a
distance
from
him
,
*NL*
considering
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
pay
attention
to
him
.
But
he
*NL*
fingered
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
wondered
whether
it
would
seem
*NL*
ridiculous
to
give
some
to
the
drummer
boy
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
Dolokhov
diverted
Petya
's
attention
from
the
drummer
boy
,
*NL*
to
whom
Denisov
had
had
some
mutton
and
vodka
given
,
and
whom
he
had
had
*NL*
dressed
in
a
Russian
coat
so
that
he
might
be
kept
with
their
band
and
*NL*
not
sent
away
with
the
other
prisoners
.
Petya
had
heard
in
the
army
many
*NL*
stories
of
Dolokhov
's
extraordinary
bravery
and
of
his
cruelty
to
the
*NL*
French
,
so
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
hut
Petya
did
not
take
his
*NL*
eyes
from
him
,
but
braced
himself
up
more
and
more
and
held
his
head
*NL*
high
,
that
he
might
not
be
unworthy
even
of
such
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
appearance
amazed
Petya
by
its
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
wore
a
Cossack
coat
,
had
a
beard
,
had
an
icon
of
Nicholas
the
*NL*
Wonder-Worker
on
his
breast
,
and
his
way
of
speaking
and
everything
he
*NL*
did
indicated
his
unusual
position
.
But
Dolokhov
,
who
in
Moscow
had
worn
*NL*
a
Persian
costume
,
had
now
the
appearance
of
a
most
correct
officer
of
*NL*
the
Guards
.
He
was
clean-shaven
and
wore
a
Guardsman
's
padded
coat
with
*NL*
an
Order
of
St.
George
at
his
buttonhole
and
a
plain
forage
cap
set
*NL*
straight
on
his
head
.
He
took
off
his
wet
felt
cloak
in
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
without
greeting
anyone
went
up
to
Denisov
and
began
*NL*
questioning
him
about
the
matter
in
hand
.
Denisov
told
him
of
the
*NL*
designs
the
large
detachments
had
on
the
transport
,
of
the
message
Petya
*NL*
had
brought
,
and
his
own
replies
to
both
generals
.
Then
he
told
him
all
*NL*
he
knew
of
the
French
detachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
But
we
must
know
what
troops
they
are
and
their
numbers
,
''
*NL*
said
Dolokhov
.
``
It
will
be
necessary
to
go
there
.
We
ca
n't
start
the
*NL*
affair
without
knowing
for
certain
how
many
there
are
.
I
like
to
work
*NL*
accurately
.
Here
now
--
would
n't
one
of
these
gentlemen
like
to
ride
over
*NL*
to
the
French
camp
with
me
?
I
have
brought
a
spare
uniform
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
I.
.
.
I
'll
go
with
you
!
''
cried
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
need
for
you
to
go
at
all
,
''
said
Denisov
,
addressing
*NL*
Dolokhov
,
``
and
as
for
him
,
I
wo
n't
let
him
go
on
any
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
!
''
exclaimed
Petya
.
``
Why
should
n't
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
excuse
me
,
because
...
because
...
I
shall
go
,
and
that
's
*NL*
all
.
You
'll
take
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
he
said
,
turning
to
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
Dolokhov
answered
absently
,
scrutinizing
the
face
of
the
*NL*
French
drummer
boy
.
``
Have
you
had
that
youngster
with
you
long
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
taken
today
but
he
knows
nothing
.
I
'm
keeping
him
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
where
do
you
put
the
others
?
''
inquired
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
I
send
them
away
and
take
a
weceipt
for
them
,
''
shouted
Denisov
,
*NL*
suddenly
flushing
.
``
And
I
say
boldly
that
I
have
not
a
single
man
's
life
*NL*
on
my
conscience
.
Would
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
send
thirty
or
thwee
*NL*
hundwed
men
to
town
under
escort
,
instead
of
staining
--
I
speak
bluntly
--
*NL*
staining
the
honor
of
a
soldier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
kind
of
amiable
talk
would
be
suitable
from
this
young
count
of
*NL*
sixteen
,
''
said
Dolokhov
with
cold
irony
,
``
but
it
's
time
for
you
to
drop
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
've
not
said
anything
!
I
only
say
that
I
'll
certainly
go
with
*NL*
you
,
''
said
Petya
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
you
and
me
,
old
fellow
,
it
's
time
to
drop
these
amenities
,
''
*NL*
continued
Dolokhov
,
as
if
he
found
particular
pleasure
in
speaking
of
*NL*
this
subject
which
irritated
Denisov
.
``
Now
,
why
have
you
kept
this
lad
?
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
swaying
his
head
.
``
Because
you
are
sorry
for
him
!
Do
n't
we
*NL*
know
those
`
receipts
'
of
yours
?
You
send
a
hundred
men
away
,
and
thirty
*NL*
get
there
.
The
rest
either
starve
or
get
killed
.
So
is
n't
it
all
the
*NL*
same
not
to
send
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
esaul
,
screwing
up
his
light-colored
eyes
,
nodded
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
the
point
.
I
'm
not
going
to
discuss
the
matter
.
I
do
not
*NL*
wish
to
take
it
on
my
conscience
.
You
say
they
'll
die
.
All
wight
.
Only
*NL*
not
by
my
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
began
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
told
them
not
to
capture
me
these
twenty
times
over
?
But
if
*NL*
they
did
catch
me
they
'd
string
me
up
to
an
aspen
tree
,
and
with
all
*NL*
your
chivalry
just
the
same
.
''
He
paused
.
``
However
,
we
must
get
to
work
.
*NL*
Tell
the
Cossack
to
fetch
my
kit
.
I
have
two
French
uniforms
in
it
.
*NL*
Well
,
are
you
coming
with
me
?
''
he
asked
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Yes
,
yes
,
certainly
!
''
cried
Petya
,
blushing
almost
to
tears
and
*NL*
glancing
at
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Dolokhov
had
been
disputing
with
Denisov
what
should
be
done
with
*NL*
prisoners
,
Petya
had
once
more
felt
awkward
and
restless
;
but
again
he
*NL*
had
no
time
to
grasp
fully
what
they
were
talking
about
.
``
If
grown-up
,
*NL*
distinguished
men
think
so
,
it
must
be
necessary
and
right
,
''
thought
he
.
*NL*
``
But
above
all
Denisov
must
not
dare
to
imagine
that
I
'll
obey
him
and
*NL*
that
he
can
order
me
about
.
I
will
certainly
go
to
the
French
camp
with
*NL*
Dolokhov
.
If
he
can
,
so
can
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
all
Denisov
's
persuasions
,
Petya
replied
that
he
too
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
everything
accurately
and
not
just
anyhow
,
and
that
he
*NL*
never
considered
personal
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
'll
admit
that
if
we
do
n't
know
for
sure
how
many
of
them
there
*NL*
are
...
hundreds
of
lives
may
depend
on
it
,
while
there
are
only
two
of
*NL*
us
.
Besides
,
I
want
to
go
very
much
and
certainly
will
go
,
so
do
n't
*NL*
hinder
me
,

said
he
.
``
It
will
only
make
things
worse
...

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Having
put
on
French
greatcoats
and
shakos
,
Petya
and
Dolokhov
rode
to
*NL*
the
clearing
from
which
Denisov
had
reconnoitered
the
French
camp
,
and
*NL*
emerging
from
the
forest
in
pitch
darkness
they
descended
into
the
*NL*
hollow
.
On
reaching
the
bottom
,
Dolokhov
told
the
Cossacks
accompanying
*NL*
him
to
await
him
there
and
rode
on
at
a
quick
trot
along
the
road
to
the
*NL*
bridge
.
Petya
,
his
heart
in
his
mouth
with
excitement
,
rode
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
're
caught
,
I
wo
n't
be
taken
alive
!
I
have
a
pistol
,
''
whispered
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
Russian
,
''
said
Dolokhov
in
a
hurried
whisper
,
and
at
that
*NL*
very
moment
they
heard
through
the
darkness
the
challenge
:
``
Qui
vive
?
''
*
*NL*
and
the
click
of
a
musket
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Petya
's
face
and
he
grasped
his
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lanciers
du
6-me
,
''
*
replied
Dolokhov
,
neither
hastening
nor
slackening
*NL*
his
horse
's
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Lancers
of
the
6th
Regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
figure
of
a
sentinel
stood
on
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mot
d'ordre
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Password
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
reined
in
his
horse
and
advanced
at
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dites
donc
,
le
colonel
Gerard
est
ici
?
''
*
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Tell
me
,
is
Colonel
Gerard
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mot
d'ordre
,
''
repeated
the
sentinel
,
barring
the
way
and
not
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quand
un
officier
fait
sa
ronde
,
les
sentinelles
ne
demandent
pas
le
*NL*
mot
d'ordre
...
''
cried
Dolokhov
suddenly
flaring
up
and
riding
straight
*NL*
at
the
sentinel
.
``
Je
vous
demande
si
le
colonel
est
ici
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
When
an
officer
is
making
his
round
,
sentinels
do
n't
ask
him
for
the
*NL*
password
...
I
am
asking
you
if
the
colonel
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
waiting
for
an
answer
from
the
sentinel
,
who
had
stepped
*NL*
aside
,
Dolokhov
rode
up
the
incline
at
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
the
black
outline
of
a
man
crossing
the
road
,
Dolokhov
stopped
*NL*
him
and
inquired
where
the
commander
and
officers
were
.
The
man
,
a
*NL*
soldier
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulder
,
stopped
,
came
close
up
to
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
horse
,
touched
it
with
his
hand
,
and
explained
simply
and
in
*NL*
a
friendly
way
that
the
commander
and
the
officers
were
higher
up
the
*NL*
hill
to
the
right
in
the
courtyard
of
the
farm
,
as
he
called
the
*NL*
landowner
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ridden
up
the
road
,
on
both
sides
of
which
French
talk
could
be
*NL*
heard
around
the
campfires
,
Dolokhov
turned
into
the
courtyard
of
the
*NL*
landowner
's
house
.
Having
ridden
in
,
he
dismounted
and
approached
a
big
*NL*
blazing
campfire
,
around
which
sat
several
men
talking
noisily
.
*NL*
Something
was
boiling
in
a
small
cauldron
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
and
a
*NL*
soldier
in
a
peaked
cap
and
blue
overcoat
,
lit
up
by
the
fire
,
was
*NL*
kneeling
beside
it
stirring
its
contents
with
a
ramrod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
a
hard
nut
to
crack
,
''
said
one
of
the
officers
who
was
sitting
*NL*
in
the
shadow
at
the
other
side
of
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
make
them
get
a
move
on
,
those
fellows
!
''
said
another
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
fell
silent
,
peering
out
through
the
darkness
at
the
sound
of
*NL*
Dolokhov
's
and
Petya
's
steps
as
they
advanced
to
the
fire
leading
their
*NL*
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bonjour
,
messieurs
!
''
*
said
Dolokhov
loudly
and
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Good
day
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stir
among
the
officers
in
the
shadow
beyond
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
one
tall
,
long-necked
officer
,
walking
round
the
fire
,
came
up
to
*NL*
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Clement
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Where
the
devil
...
?
''
But
,
noticing
*NL*
his
mistake
,
he
broke
off
short
and
,
with
a
frown
,
greeted
Dolokhov
as
a
*NL*
stranger
,
asking
what
he
could
do
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
said
that
he
and
his
companion
were
trying
to
overtake
their
*NL*
regiment
,
and
addressing
the
company
in
general
asked
whether
they
knew
*NL*
anything
of
the
6th
Regiment
.
None
of
them
knew
anything
,
and
Petya
*NL*
thought
the
officers
were
beginning
to
look
at
him
and
Dolokhov
with
*NL*
hostility
and
suspicion
.
For
some
seconds
all
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
counting
on
the
evening
soup
,
you
have
come
too
late
,
''
said
*NL*
a
voice
from
behind
the
fire
with
a
repressed
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
replied
that
they
were
not
hungry
and
must
push
on
farther
that
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
the
horses
over
to
the
soldier
who
was
stirring
the
pot
and
*NL*
squatted
down
on
his
heels
by
the
fire
beside
the
officer
with
the
long
*NL*
neck
.
That
officer
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
Dolokhov
and
again
asked
*NL*
to
what
regiment
he
belonged
.
Dolokhov
,
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
*NL*
question
,
did
not
reply
,
but
lighting
a
short
French
pipe
which
he
took
*NL*
from
his
pocket
began
asking
the
officer
in
how
far
the
road
before
them
*NL*
was
safe
from
Cossacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
brigands
are
everywhere
,
''
replied
an
officer
from
behind
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
remarked
that
the
Cossacks
were
a
danger
only
to
stragglers
*NL*
such
as
his
companion
and
himself
,
``
but
probably
they
would
not
dare
to
*NL*
attack
large
detachments
?
''
he
added
inquiringly
.
No
one
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
he
'll
come
away
,
''
Petya
thought
every
moment
as
he
stood
by
*NL*
the
campfire
listening
to
the
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dolokhov
restarted
the
conversation
which
had
dropped
and
began
*NL*
putting
direct
questions
as
to
how
many
men
there
were
in
the
battalion
,
*NL*
how
many
battalions
,
and
how
many
prisoners
.
Asking
about
the
Russian
*NL*
prisoners
with
that
detachment
,
Dolokhov
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
horrid
business
dragging
these
corpses
about
with
one
!
It
would
be
*NL*
better
to
shoot
such
rabble
,
''
and
burst
into
loud
laughter
,
so
strange
*NL*
that
Petya
thought
the
French
would
immediately
detect
their
disguise
,
*NL*
and
involuntarily
took
a
step
back
from
the
campfire
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
replied
a
word
to
Dolokhov
's
laughter
,
and
a
French
officer
whom
*NL*
they
could
not
see
-LRB-
he
lay
wrapped
in
a
greatcoat
-RRB-
rose
and
whispered
*NL*
something
to
a
companion
.
Dolokhov
got
up
and
called
to
the
soldier
who
*NL*
was
holding
their
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
they
bring
our
horses
or
not
?
''
thought
Petya
,
instinctively
*NL*
drawing
nearer
to
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
were
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Dolokhov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
wished
to
say
``
Good
night
''
but
could
not
utter
a
word
.
The
*NL*
officers
were
whispering
together
.
Dolokhov
was
a
long
time
mounting
his
*NL*
horse
which
would
not
stand
still
,
then
he
rode
out
of
the
yard
at
a
*NL*
footpace
.
Petya
rode
beside
him
,
longing
to
look
round
to
see
whether
or
*NL*
not
the
French
were
running
after
them
,
but
not
daring
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
out
onto
the
road
Dolokhov
did
not
ride
back
across
the
open
*NL*
country
,
but
through
the
village
.
At
one
spot
he
stopped
and
listened
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
?
''
he
asked
.
Petya
recognized
the
sound
of
Russian
voices
*NL*
and
saw
the
dark
figures
of
Russian
prisoners
round
their
campfires
.
*NL*
When
they
had
descended
to
the
bridge
Petya
and
Dolokhov
rode
past
the
*NL*
sentinel
,
who
without
saying
a
word
paced
morosely
up
and
down
it
,
then
*NL*
they
descended
into
the
hollow
where
the
Cossacks
awaited
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
good-by
.
Tell
Denisov
,
`
at
the
first
shot
at
daybreak
,
'
''
said
*NL*
Dolokhov
and
was
about
to
ride
away
,
but
Petya
seized
hold
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
he
cried
,
``
you
are
such
a
hero
!
Oh
,
how
fine
,
how
splendid
!
*NL*
How
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
!
''
said
Dolokhov
.
But
Petya
did
not
let
go
of
him
*NL*
and
Dolokhov
saw
through
the
gloom
that
Petya
was
bending
toward
him
and
*NL*
wanted
to
kiss
him
.
Dolokhov
kissed
him
,
laughed
,
turned
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
vanished
into
the
darkness
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Having
returned
to
the
watchman
's
hut
,
Petya
found
Denisov
in
the
*NL*
passage
.
He
was
awaiting
Petya
's
return
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
*NL*
anxiety
,
and
self-reproach
for
having
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Yes
,
thank
God
!
''
he
repeated
,
listening
to
*NL*
Petya
's
rapturous
account
.
``
But
,
devil
take
you
,
I
have
n't
slept
because
*NL*
of
you
!
Well
,
thank
God
.
Now
lie
down
.
We
can
still
get
a
nap
before
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
...
no
,
''
said
Petya
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
sleep
yet
.
Besides
I
know
*NL*
myself
,
if
I
fall
asleep
it
's
finished
.
And
then
I
am
used
to
not
*NL*
sleeping
before
a
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
awhile
in
the
hut
joyfully
recalling
the
details
of
his
*NL*
expedition
and
vividly
picturing
to
himself
what
would
happen
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
noticing
that
Denisov
was
asleep
,
he
rose
and
went
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
quite
dark
outside
.
The
rain
was
over
,
but
drops
were
still
*NL*
falling
from
the
trees
.
Near
the
watchman
's
hut
the
black
shapes
of
the
*NL*
Cossacks
'
shanties
and
of
horses
tethered
together
could
be
seen
.
Behind
*NL*
the
hut
the
dark
shapes
of
the
two
wagons
with
their
horses
beside
them
*NL*
were
discernible
,
and
in
the
hollow
the
dying
campfire
gleamed
red
.
Not
*NL*
all
the
Cossacks
and
hussars
were
asleep
;
here
and
there
,
amid
the
*NL*
sounds
of
falling
drops
and
the
munching
of
the
horses
near
by
,
could
be
*NL*
heard
low
voices
which
seemed
to
be
whispering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
came
out
,
peered
into
the
darkness
,
and
went
up
to
the
wagons
.
*NL*
Someone
was
snoring
under
them
,
and
around
them
stood
saddled
horses
*NL*
munching
their
oats
.
In
the
dark
Petya
recognized
his
own
horse
,
which
*NL*
he
called
``
Karabakh
''
though
it
was
of
Ukranian
breed
,
and
went
up
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Karabakh
!
We
'll
do
some
service
tomorrow
,
''
said
he
,
sniffing
its
*NL*
nostrils
and
kissing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
n't
you
asleep
,
sir
?
''
said
a
Cossack
who
was
sitting
under
a
*NL*
wagon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ah
...
Likhachev
--
is
n't
that
your
name
?
Do
you
know
I
have
only
just
*NL*
come
back
!
We
've
been
into
the
French
camp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Petya
gave
the
Cossack
a
detailed
account
not
only
of
his
ride
but
*NL*
also
of
his
object
,
and
why
he
considered
it
better
to
risk
his
life
*NL*
than
to
act
``
just
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
should
get
some
sleep
now
,
''
said
the
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
used
to
this
,
''
said
Petya
.
``
I
say
,
are
n't
the
flints
in
your
*NL*
pistols
worn
out
?
I
brought
some
with
me
.
Do
n't
you
want
any
?
You
can
*NL*
have
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cossack
bent
forward
from
under
the
wagon
to
get
a
closer
look
at
*NL*
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
accustomed
to
doing
everything
accurately
,
''
said
Petya
.
*NL*
``
Some
fellows
do
things
just
anyhow
,
without
preparation
,
and
then
*NL*
they
're
sorry
for
it
afterwards
.
I
do
n't
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
said
the
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
another
thing
!
Please
,
my
dear
fellow
,
will
you
sharpen
my
*NL*
saber
for
me
?
It
's
got
bl
...
''
-LRB-
Petya
feared
to
tell
a
lie
,
and
the
saber
*NL*
never
had
been
sharpened
.
-RRB-
``
Can
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Likhachev
got
up
,
rummaged
in
his
pack
,
and
soon
Petya
heard
the
warlike
*NL*
sound
of
steel
on
whetstone
.
He
climbed
onto
the
wagon
and
sat
on
its
*NL*
edge
.
The
Cossack
was
sharpening
the
saber
under
the
wagon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
Are
the
lads
asleep
?
''
asked
Petya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
are
,
and
some
are
n't
--
like
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
that
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vesenny
?
Oh
,
he
's
thrown
himself
down
there
in
the
passage
.
Fast
asleep
*NL*
after
his
fright
.
He
was
that
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Petya
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
,
listening
to
the
*NL*
sounds
.
He
heard
footsteps
in
the
darkness
and
a
black
figure
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
sharpening
?
''
asked
a
man
coming
up
to
the
wagon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
gentleman
's
saber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
the
man
,
whom
Petya
took
to
be
an
hussar
.
``
Was
the
*NL*
cup
left
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
by
the
wheel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussar
took
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
daylight
soon
,
''
said
he
,
yawning
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
ought
to
have
known
that
he
was
in
a
forest
with
Denisov
's
*NL*
guerrilla
band
,
less
than
a
mile
from
the
road
,
sitting
on
a
wagon
*NL*
captured
from
the
French
beside
which
horses
were
tethered
,
that
under
*NL*
it
Likhachev
was
sitting
sharpening
a
saber
for
him
,
that
the
big
dark
*NL*
blotch
to
the
right
was
the
watchman
's
hut
,
and
the
red
blotch
below
to
*NL*
the
left
was
the
dying
embers
of
a
campfire
,
that
the
man
who
had
come
*NL*
for
the
cup
was
an
hussar
who
wanted
a
drink
;
but
he
neither
knew
nor
*NL*
waited
to
know
anything
of
all
this
.
He
was
in
a
fairy
kingdom
where
*NL*
nothing
resembled
reality
.
The
big
dark
blotch
might
really
be
the
*NL*
watchman
's
hut
or
it
might
be
a
cavern
leading
to
the
very
depths
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
Perhaps
the
red
spot
was
a
fire
,
or
it
might
be
the
eye
of
an
*NL*
enormous
monster
.
Perhaps
he
was
really
sitting
on
a
wagon
,
but
it
might
*NL*
very
well
be
that
he
was
not
sitting
on
a
wagon
but
on
a
terribly
high
*NL*
tower
from
which
,
if
he
fell
,
he
would
have
to
fall
for
a
whole
day
or
a
*NL*
whole
month
,
or
go
on
falling
and
never
reach
the
bottom
.
Perhaps
it
was
*NL*
just
the
Cossack
,
Likhachev
,
who
was
sitting
under
the
wagon
,
but
it
*NL*
might
be
the
kindest
,
bravest
,
most
wonderful
,
most
splendid
man
in
the
*NL*
world
,
whom
no
one
knew
of
.
It
might
really
have
been
that
the
hussar
*NL*
came
for
water
and
went
back
into
the
hollow
,
but
perhaps
he
had
simply
*NL*
vanished
--
disappeared
altogether
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
Petya
could
have
seen
now
would
have
surprised
him
.
He
was
in
a
*NL*
fairy
kingdom
where
everything
was
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
And
the
sky
was
a
fairy
realm
like
the
earth
.
*NL*
It
was
clearing
,
and
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
clouds
were
swiftly
*NL*
sailing
as
if
unveiling
the
stars
.
Sometimes
it
looked
as
if
the
clouds
*NL*
were
passing
,
and
a
clear
black
sky
appeared
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
*NL*
the
black
spaces
were
clouds
.
Sometimes
the
sky
seemed
to
be
rising
*NL*
high
,
high
overhead
,
and
then
it
seemed
to
sink
so
low
that
one
could
*NL*
touch
it
with
one
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
's
eyes
began
to
close
and
he
swayed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
were
dripping
.
Quiet
talking
was
heard
.
The
horses
neighed
and
*NL*
jostled
one
another
.
Someone
snored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ozheg-zheg
,
Ozheg-zheg
...
''
hissed
the
saber
against
the
whetstone
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
Petya
heard
an
harmonious
orchestra
playing
some
unknown
,
*NL*
sweetly
solemn
hymn
.
Petya
was
as
musical
as
Natasha
and
more
so
than
*NL*
Nicholas
,
but
had
never
learned
music
or
thought
about
it
,
and
so
the
*NL*
melody
that
unexpectedly
came
to
his
mind
seemed
to
him
particularly
*NL*
fresh
and
attractive
.
The
music
became
more
and
more
audible
.
The
melody
*NL*
grew
and
passed
from
one
instrument
to
another
.
And
what
was
played
was
*NL*
a
fugue
--
though
Petya
had
not
the
least
conception
of
what
a
fugue
is
.
*NL*
Each
instrument
--
now
resembling
a
violin
and
now
a
horn
,
but
better
and
*NL*
clearer
than
violin
or
horn
--
played
its
own
part
,
and
before
it
had
*NL*
finished
the
melody
merged
with
another
instrument
that
began
almost
the
*NL*
same
air
,
and
then
with
a
third
and
a
fourth
;
and
they
all
blended
into
*NL*
one
and
again
became
separate
and
again
blended
,
now
into
solemn
church
*NL*
music
,
now
into
something
dazzlingly
brilliant
and
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
why
,
that
was
in
a
dream
!
''
Petya
said
to
himself
,
as
he
lurched
*NL*
forward
.
``
It
's
in
my
ears
.
But
perhaps
it
's
music
of
my
own
.
Well
,
go
*NL*
on
,
my
music
!
Now
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
his
eyes
,
and
,
from
all
sides
as
if
from
a
distance
,
sounds
*NL*
fluttered
,
grew
into
harmonies
,
separated
,
blended
,
and
again
all
*NL*
mingled
into
the
same
sweet
and
solemn
hymn
.
``
Oh
,
this
is
delightful
!
As
*NL*
much
as
I
like
and
as
I
like
!
''
said
Petya
to
himself
.
He
tried
to
*NL*
conduct
that
enormous
orchestra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
softly
,
softly
die
away
!
''
and
the
sounds
obeyed
him
.
``
Now
fuller
,
*NL*
more
joyful
.
Still
more
and
more
joyful
!
''
And
from
an
unknown
depth
rose
*NL*
increasingly
triumphant
sounds
.
``
Now
voices
join
in
!
''
ordered
Petya
.
And
*NL*
at
first
from
afar
he
heard
men
's
voices
and
then
women
's
.
The
voices
*NL*
grew
in
harmonious
triumphant
strength
,
and
Petya
listened
to
their
*NL*
surpassing
beauty
in
awe
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
solemn
triumphal
march
there
mingled
a
song
,
the
drip
from
the
*NL*
trees
,
and
the
hissing
of
the
saber
,
``
Ozheg-zheg-zheg
...
''
and
again
the
*NL*
horses
jostled
one
another
and
neighed
,
not
disturbing
the
choir
but
*NL*
joining
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
did
not
know
how
long
this
lasted
:
he
enjoyed
himself
all
the
*NL*
time
,
wondered
at
his
enjoyment
and
regretted
that
there
was
no
one
to
*NL*
share
it
.
He
was
awakened
by
Likhachev
's
kindly
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ready
,
your
honor
;
you
can
split
a
Frenchman
in
half
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petya
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
getting
light
,
it
's
really
getting
light
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
that
had
previously
been
invisible
could
now
be
seen
to
their
*NL*
very
tails
,
and
a
watery
light
showed
itself
through
the
bare
branches
.
*NL*
Petya
shook
himself
,
jumped
up
,
took
a
ruble
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
*NL*
to
Likhachev
;
then
he
flourished
the
saber
,
tested
it
,
and
sheathed
it
.
*NL*
The
Cossacks
were
untying
their
horses
and
tightening
their
saddle
*NL*
girths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
's
the
commander
,
''
said
Likhachev
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
came
out
of
the
watchman
's
hut
and
,
having
called
Petya
,
gave
*NL*
orders
to
get
ready
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
rapidly
picked
out
their
horses
in
the
semidarkness
,
tightened
*NL*
their
saddle
girths
,
and
formed
companies
.
Denisov
stood
by
the
*NL*
watchman
's
hut
giving
final
orders
.
The
infantry
of
the
detachment
*NL*
passed
along
the
road
and
quickly
disappeared
amid
the
trees
in
the
mist
*NL*
of
early
dawn
,
hundreds
of
feet
splashing
through
the
mud
.
The
esaul
*NL*
gave
some
orders
to
his
men
.
Petya
held
his
horse
by
the
bridle
,
*NL*
impatiently
awaiting
the
order
to
mount
.
His
face
,
having
been
bathed
in
*NL*
cold
water
,
was
all
aglow
,
and
his
eyes
were
particularly
brilliant
.
*NL*
Cold
shivers
ran
down
his
spine
and
his
whole
body
pulsed
rhythmically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
ev
`
wything
weady
?
''
asked
Denisov
.
``
Bwing
the
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
were
brought
.
Denisov
was
angry
with
the
Cossack
because
the
*NL*
saddle
girths
were
too
slack
,
reproved
him
,
and
mounted
.
Petya
put
his
*NL*
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
His
horse
by
habit
made
as
if
to
nip
his
leg
,
but
*NL*
Petya
leaped
quickly
into
the
saddle
unconscious
of
his
own
weight
and
,
*NL*
turning
to
look
at
the
hussars
starting
in
the
darkness
behind
him
,
rode
*NL*
up
to
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vasili
Dmitrich
,
entrust
me
with
some
commission
!
Please
...
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
...
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
seemed
to
have
forgotten
Petya
's
very
existence
.
He
turned
to
*NL*
glance
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
one
thing
of
you
,
''
he
said
sternly
,
``
to
obey
me
and
not
shove
*NL*
yourself
forward
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
say
another
word
to
Petya
but
rode
in
silence
all
the
way
.
*NL*
When
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
it
was
noticeably
growing
*NL*
light
over
the
field
.
Denisov
talked
in
whispers
with
the
esaul
and
the
*NL*
Cossacks
rode
past
Petya
and
Denisov
.
When
they
had
all
ridden
by
,
*NL*
Denisov
touched
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
hill
.
Slipping
onto
their
*NL*
haunches
and
sliding
,
the
horses
descended
with
their
riders
into
the
*NL*
ravine
.
Petya
rode
beside
Denisov
,
the
pulsation
of
his
body
constantly
*NL*
increasing
.
It
was
getting
lighter
and
lighter
,
but
the
mist
still
hid
*NL*
distant
objects
.
Having
reached
the
valley
,
Denisov
looked
back
and
*NL*
nodded
to
a
Cossack
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
signal
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cossack
raised
his
arm
and
a
shot
rang
out
.
In
an
instant
the
tramp
*NL*
of
horses
galloping
forward
was
heard
,
shouts
came
from
various
sides
,
*NL*
and
then
more
shots
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
and
shouting
,
Petya
lashed
his
*NL*
horse
and
loosening
his
rein
galloped
forward
,
not
heeding
Denisov
who
*NL*
shouted
at
him
.
It
seemed
to
Petya
that
at
the
moment
the
shot
was
fired
*NL*
it
suddenly
became
as
bright
as
noon
.
He
galloped
to
the
bridge
.
*NL*
Cossacks
were
galloping
along
the
road
in
front
of
him
.
On
the
bridge
he
*NL*
collided
with
a
Cossack
who
had
fallen
behind
,
but
he
galloped
on
.
In
*NL*
front
of
him
soldiers
,
probably
Frenchmen
,
were
running
from
right
to
*NL*
left
across
the
road
.
One
of
them
fell
in
the
mud
under
his
horse
's
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cossacks
were
crowding
about
a
hut
,
busy
with
something
.
From
the
midst
*NL*
of
that
crowd
terrible
screams
arose
.
Petya
galloped
up
,
and
the
first
*NL*
thing
he
saw
was
the
pale
face
and
trembling
jaw
of
a
Frenchman
,
*NL*
clutching
the
handle
of
a
lance
that
had
been
aimed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
...
Lads
!
...
ours
!
''
shouted
Petya
,
and
giving
rein
to
his
*NL*
excited
horse
he
galloped
forward
along
the
village
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
shooting
ahead
of
him
.
Cossacks
,
hussars
,
and
ragged
*NL*
Russian
prisoners
,
who
had
come
running
from
both
sides
of
the
road
,
*NL*
were
shouting
something
loudly
and
incoherently
.
A
gallant-looking
*NL*
Frenchman
,
in
a
blue
overcoat
,
capless
,
and
with
a
frowning
red
face
,
*NL*
had
been
defending
himself
against
the
hussars
.
When
Petya
galloped
up
*NL*
the
Frenchman
had
already
fallen
.
``
Too
late
again
!
''
flashed
through
*NL*
Petya
's
mind
and
he
galloped
on
to
the
place
from
which
the
rapid
firing
*NL*
could
be
heard
.
The
shots
came
from
the
yard
of
the
landowner
's
house
he
*NL*
had
visited
the
night
before
with
Dolokhov
.
The
French
were
making
a
*NL*
stand
there
behind
a
wattle
fence
in
a
garden
thickly
overgrown
with
*NL*
bushes
and
were
firing
at
the
Cossacks
who
crowded
at
the
gateway
.
*NL*
Through
the
smoke
,
as
he
approached
the
gate
,
Petya
saw
Dolokhov
,
whose
*NL*
face
was
of
a
pale-greenish
tint
,
shouting
to
his
men
.
``
Go
round
!
Wait
*NL*
for
the
infantry
!
''
he
exclaimed
as
Petya
rode
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
?
...
Hurrah-ah-ah
!
''
shouted
Petya
,
and
without
pausing
a
moment
*NL*
galloped
to
the
place
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing
and
where
the
*NL*
smoke
was
thickest
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
volley
was
heard
,
and
some
bullets
whistled
past
,
while
others
plashed
*NL*
against
something
.
The
Cossacks
and
Dolokhov
galloped
after
Petya
into
*NL*
the
gateway
of
the
courtyard
.
In
the
dense
wavering
smoke
some
of
the
*NL*
French
threw
down
their
arms
and
ran
out
of
the
bushes
to
meet
the
*NL*
Cossacks
,
while
others
ran
down
the
hill
toward
the
pond
.
Petya
was
*NL*
galloping
along
the
courtyard
,
but
instead
of
holding
the
reins
he
waved
*NL*
both
his
arms
about
rapidly
and
strangely
,
slipping
farther
and
farther
*NL*
to
one
side
in
his
saddle
.
His
horse
,
having
galloped
up
to
a
campfire
*NL*
that
was
smoldering
in
the
morning
light
,
stopped
suddenly
,
and
Petya
*NL*
fell
heavily
on
to
the
wet
ground
.
The
Cossacks
saw
that
his
arms
and
*NL*
legs
jerked
rapidly
though
his
head
was
quite
motionless
.
A
bullet
had
*NL*
pierced
his
skull
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
speaking
to
the
senior
French
officer
,
who
came
out
of
the
house
*NL*
with
a
white
handkerchief
tied
to
his
sword
and
announced
that
they
*NL*
surrendered
,
Dolokhov
dismounted
and
went
up
to
Petya
,
who
lay
*NL*
motionless
with
outstretched
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
for
!
''
he
said
with
a
frown
,
and
went
to
the
gate
to
meet
Denisov
*NL*
who
was
riding
toward
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Killed
?
''
cried
Denisov
,
recognizing
from
a
distance
the
unmistakably
*NL*
lifeless
attitude
--
very
familiar
to
him
--
in
which
Petya
's
body
was
*NL*
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
for
!
''
repeated
Dolokhov
as
if
the
utterance
of
these
words
*NL*
afforded
him
pleasure
,
and
he
went
quickly
up
to
the
prisoners
,
who
were
*NL*
surrounded
by
Cossacks
who
had
hurried
up
.
``
We
wo
n't
take
them
!
''
he
*NL*
called
out
to
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
did
not
reply
;
he
rode
up
to
Petya
,
dismounted
,
and
with
*NL*
trembling
hands
turned
toward
himself
the
bloodstained
,
mud-bespattered
*NL*
face
which
had
already
gone
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
used
to
something
sweet
.
Raisins
,
fine
ones
...
take
them
all
!
''
he
*NL*
recalled
Petya
's
words
.
And
the
Cossacks
looked
round
in
surprise
at
the
*NL*
sound
,
like
the
yelp
of
a
dog
,
with
which
Denisov
turned
away
,
walked
to
*NL*
the
wattle
fence
,
and
seized
hold
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
Russian
prisoners
rescued
by
Denisov
and
Dolokhov
was
Pierre
*NL*
Bezukhov
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
their
march
from
Moscow
no
fresh
orders
had
been
*NL*
issued
by
the
French
authorities
concerning
the
party
of
prisoners
among
*NL*
whom
was
Pierre
.
On
the
twenty-second
of
October
that
party
was
no
*NL*
longer
with
the
same
troops
and
baggage
trains
with
which
it
had
left
*NL*
Moscow
.
Half
the
wagons
laden
with
hardtack
that
had
traveled
the
first
*NL*
stages
with
them
had
been
captured
by
Cossacks
,
the
other
half
had
gone
*NL*
on
ahead
.
Not
one
of
those
dismounted
cavalrymen
who
had
marched
in
*NL*
front
of
the
prisoners
was
left
;
they
had
all
disappeared
.
The
artillery
*NL*
the
prisoners
had
seen
in
front
of
them
during
the
first
days
was
now
*NL*
replaced
by
Marshal
Junot
's
enormous
baggage
train
,
convoyed
by
*NL*
Westphalians
.
Behind
the
prisoners
came
a
cavalry
baggage
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Vyazma
onwards
the
French
army
,
which
had
till
then
moved
in
three
*NL*
columns
,
went
on
as
a
single
group
.
The
symptoms
of
disorder
that
Pierre
*NL*
had
noticed
at
their
first
halting
place
after
leaving
Moscow
had
now
*NL*
reached
the
utmost
limit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
along
which
they
moved
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
dead
*NL*
horses
;
ragged
men
who
had
fallen
behind
from
various
regiments
*NL*
continually
changed
about
,
now
joining
the
moving
column
,
now
again
*NL*
lagging
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
during
the
march
false
alarms
had
been
given
and
the
*NL*
soldiers
of
the
escort
had
raised
their
muskets
,
fired
,
and
run
*NL*
headlong
,
crushing
one
another
,
but
had
afterwards
reassembled
and
*NL*
abused
each
other
for
their
causeless
panic
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
three
groups
traveling
together
--
the
cavalry
stores
,
the
convoy
of
*NL*
prisoners
,
and
Junot
's
baggage
train
--
still
constituted
a
separate
and
*NL*
united
whole
,
though
each
of
the
groups
was
rapidly
melting
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
artillery
baggage
train
which
had
consisted
of
a
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
wagons
,
not
more
than
sixty
now
remained
;
the
rest
had
been
*NL*
captured
or
left
behind
.
Some
of
Junot
's
wagons
also
had
been
captured
*NL*
or
abandoned
.
Three
wagons
had
been
raided
and
robbed
by
stragglers
from
*NL*
Davout
's
corps
.
From
the
talk
of
the
Germans
Pierre
learned
that
a
*NL*
larger
guard
had
been
allotted
to
that
baggage
train
than
to
the
*NL*
prisoners
,
and
that
one
of
their
comrades
,
a
German
soldier
,
had
been
*NL*
shot
by
the
marshal
's
own
order
because
a
silver
spoon
belonging
to
the
*NL*
marshal
had
been
found
in
his
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
group
of
prisoners
had
melted
away
most
of
all
.
Of
the
three
hundred
*NL*
and
thirty
men
who
had
set
out
from
Moscow
fewer
than
a
hundred
now
*NL*
remained
.
The
prisoners
were
more
burdensome
to
the
escort
than
even
the
*NL*
cavalry
saddles
or
Junot
's
baggage
.
They
understood
that
the
saddles
and
*NL*
Junot
's
spoon
might
be
of
some
use
,
but
that
cold
and
hungry
soldiers
*NL*
should
have
to
stand
and
guard
equally
cold
and
hungry
Russians
who
*NL*
froze
and
lagged
behind
on
the
road
-LRB-
in
which
case
the
order
was
to
*NL*
shoot
them
-RRB-
was
not
merely
incomprehensible
but
revolting
.
And
the
*NL*
escort
,
as
if
afraid
,
in
the
grievous
condition
they
themselves
were
in
,
*NL*
of
giving
way
to
the
pity
they
felt
for
the
prisoners
and
so
rendering
*NL*
their
own
plight
still
worse
,
treated
them
with
particular
moroseness
*NL*
and
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Dorogobuzh
while
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
,
after
locking
the
*NL*
prisoners
in
a
stable
,
had
gone
off
to
pillage
their
own
stores
,
several
*NL*
of
the
soldier
prisoners
tunneled
under
the
wall
and
ran
away
,
but
were
*NL*
recaptured
by
the
French
and
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrangement
adopted
when
they
started
,
that
the
officer
prisoners
*NL*
should
be
kept
separate
from
the
rest
,
had
long
since
been
abandoned
.
*NL*
All
who
could
walk
went
together
,
and
after
the
third
stage
Pierre
had
*NL*
rejoined
Karataev
and
the
gray-blue
bandy-legged
dog
that
had
chosen
*NL*
Karataev
for
its
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
after
leaving
Moscow
Karataev
again
fell
ill
with
the
*NL*
fever
he
had
suffered
from
in
the
hospital
in
Moscow
,
and
as
he
grew
*NL*
gradually
weaker
Pierre
kept
away
from
him
.
Pierre
did
not
know
why
,
but
*NL*
since
Karataev
had
begun
to
grow
weaker
it
had
cost
him
an
effort
to
go
*NL*
near
him
.
When
he
did
so
and
heard
the
subdued
moaning
with
which
*NL*
Karataev
generally
lay
down
at
the
halting
places
,
and
when
he
smelled
*NL*
the
odor
emanating
from
him
which
was
now
stronger
than
before
,
Pierre
*NL*
moved
farther
away
and
did
not
think
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
imprisoned
in
the
shed
Pierre
had
learned
not
with
his
intellect
*NL*
but
with
his
whole
being
,
by
life
itself
,
that
man
is
created
for
*NL*
happiness
,
that
happiness
is
within
him
,
in
the
satisfaction
of
simple
*NL*
human
needs
,
and
that
all
unhappiness
arises
not
from
privation
but
from
*NL*
superfluity
.
And
now
during
these
last
three
weeks
of
the
march
he
had
*NL*
learned
still
another
new
,
consolatory
truth
--
that
nothing
in
this
world
*NL*
is
terrible
.
He
had
learned
that
as
there
is
no
condition
in
which
man
*NL*
can
be
happy
and
entirely
free
,
so
there
is
no
condition
in
which
he
*NL*
need
be
unhappy
and
lack
freedom
.
He
learned
that
suffering
and
freedom
*NL*
have
their
limits
and
that
those
limits
are
very
near
together
;
that
the
*NL*
person
in
a
bed
of
roses
with
one
crumpled
petal
suffered
as
keenly
as
*NL*
he
now
,
sleeping
on
the
bare
damp
earth
with
one
side
growing
chilled
*NL*
while
the
other
was
warming
;
and
that
when
he
had
put
on
tight
dancing
*NL*
shoes
he
had
suffered
just
as
he
did
now
when
he
walked
with
bare
feet
*NL*
that
were
covered
with
sores
--
his
footgear
having
long
since
fallen
to
*NL*
pieces
.
He
discovered
that
when
he
had
married
his
wife
--
of
his
own
free
*NL*
will
as
it
had
seemed
to
him
--
he
had
been
no
more
free
than
now
when
*NL*
they
locked
him
up
at
night
in
a
stable
.
Of
all
that
he
himself
*NL*
subsequently
termed
his
sufferings
,
but
which
at
the
time
he
scarcely
*NL*
felt
,
the
worst
was
the
state
of
his
bare
,
raw
,
and
scab-covered
feet
.
*NL*
-LRB-
The
horseflesh
was
appetizing
and
nourishing
,
the
saltpeter
flavor
of
*NL*
the
gunpowder
they
used
instead
of
salt
was
even
pleasant
;
there
was
no
*NL*
great
cold
,
it
was
always
warm
walking
in
the
daytime
,
and
at
night
*NL*
there
were
the
campfires
;
the
lice
that
devoured
him
warmed
his
body
.
-RRB-
*NL*
The
one
thing
that
was
at
first
hard
to
bear
was
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
second
day
's
march
Pierre
,
having
examined
his
feet
by
the
*NL*
campfire
,
thought
it
would
be
impossible
to
walk
on
them
;
but
when
*NL*
everybody
got
up
he
went
along
,
limping
,
and
,
when
he
had
warmed
up
,
*NL*
walked
without
feeling
the
pain
,
though
at
night
his
feet
were
more
*NL*
terrible
to
look
at
than
before
.
However
,
he
did
not
look
at
them
now
,
*NL*
but
thought
of
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
now
did
Pierre
realize
the
full
strength
of
life
in
man
and
the
*NL*
saving
power
he
has
of
transferring
his
attention
from
one
thing
to
*NL*
another
,
which
is
like
the
safety
valve
of
a
boiler
that
allows
*NL*
superfluous
steam
to
blow
off
when
the
pressure
exceeds
a
certain
limit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
see
and
did
not
hear
how
they
shot
the
prisoners
who
lagged
*NL*
behind
,
though
more
than
a
hundred
perished
in
that
way
.
He
did
not
*NL*
think
of
Karataev
who
grew
weaker
every
day
and
evidently
would
soon
*NL*
have
to
share
that
fate
.
Still
less
did
Pierre
think
about
himself
.
The
*NL*
harder
his
position
became
and
the
more
terrible
the
future
,
the
more
*NL*
independent
of
that
position
in
which
he
found
himself
were
the
joyful
*NL*
and
comforting
thoughts
,
memories
,
and
imaginings
that
came
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
At
midday
on
the
twenty-second
of
October
Pierre
was
going
uphill
along
*NL*
the
muddy
,
slippery
road
,
looking
at
his
feet
and
at
the
roughness
of
*NL*
the
way
.
Occasionally
he
glanced
at
the
familiar
crowd
around
him
and
*NL*
then
again
at
his
feet
.
The
former
and
the
latter
were
alike
familiar
*NL*
and
his
own
.
The
blue-gray
bandy
legged
dog
ran
merrily
along
the
side
*NL*
of
the
road
,
sometimes
in
proof
of
its
agility
and
self-satisfaction
*NL*
lifting
one
hind
leg
and
hopping
along
on
three
,
and
then
again
going
on
*NL*
all
four
and
rushing
to
bark
at
the
crows
that
sat
on
the
carrion
.
The
*NL*
dog
was
merrier
and
sleeker
than
it
had
been
in
Moscow
.
All
around
lay
*NL*
the
flesh
of
different
animals
--
from
men
to
horses
--
in
various
stages
of
*NL*
decomposition
;
and
as
the
wolves
were
kept
off
by
the
passing
men
the
*NL*
dog
could
eat
all
it
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
raining
since
morning
and
had
seemed
as
if
at
any
moment
it
*NL*
might
cease
and
the
sky
clear
,
but
after
a
short
break
it
began
raining
*NL*
harder
than
before
.
The
saturated
road
no
longer
absorbed
the
water
,
*NL*
which
ran
along
the
ruts
in
streams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
walked
along
,
looking
from
side
to
side
,
counting
his
steps
in
*NL*
threes
,
and
reckoning
them
off
on
his
fingers
.
Mentally
addressing
the
*NL*
rain
,
he
repeated
:
``
Now
then
,
now
then
,
go
on
!
Pelt
harder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
,
but
far
down
and
deep
*NL*
within
him
his
soul
was
occupied
with
something
important
and
*NL*
comforting
.
This
something
was
a
most
subtle
spiritual
deduction
from
a
*NL*
conversation
with
Karataev
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
their
yesterday
's
halting
place
,
feeling
chilly
by
a
dying
campfire
,
*NL*
Pierre
had
got
up
and
gone
to
the
next
one
,
which
was
burning
better
.
*NL*
There
Platon
Karataev
was
sitting
covered
up
--
head
and
all
--
with
his
*NL*
greatcoat
as
if
it
were
a
vestment
,
telling
the
soldiers
in
his
*NL*
effective
and
pleasant
though
now
feeble
voice
a
story
Pierre
knew
.
It
*NL*
was
already
past
midnight
,
the
hour
when
Karataev
was
usually
free
of
*NL*
his
fever
and
particularly
lively
.
When
Pierre
reached
the
fire
and
*NL*
heard
Platon
's
voice
enfeebled
by
illness
,
and
saw
his
pathetic
face
*NL*
brightly
lit
up
by
the
blaze
,
he
felt
a
painful
prick
at
his
heart
.
His
*NL*
feeling
of
pity
for
this
man
frightened
him
and
he
wished
to
go
away
,
*NL*
but
there
was
no
other
fire
,
and
Pierre
sat
down
,
trying
not
to
look
at
*NL*
Platon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
?
If
we
grumble
at
sickness
,
God
wo
n't
grant
us
death
,
''
replied
*NL*
Platon
,
and
at
once
resumed
the
story
he
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
brother
,
''
he
continued
,
with
a
smile
on
his
pale
emaciated
face
*NL*
and
a
particularly
happy
light
in
his
eyes
,
``
you
see
,
brother
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
long
been
familiar
with
that
story
.
Karataev
had
told
it
to
*NL*
him
alone
some
half-dozen
times
and
always
with
a
specially
joyful
*NL*
emotion
.
But
well
as
he
knew
it
,
Pierre
now
listened
to
that
tale
as
to
*NL*
something
new
,
and
the
quiet
rapture
Karataev
evidently
felt
as
he
told
*NL*
it
communicated
itself
also
to
Pierre
.
The
story
was
of
an
old
merchant
*NL*
who
lived
a
good
and
God-fearing
life
with
his
family
,
and
who
went
once
*NL*
to
the
Nizhni
fair
with
a
companion
--
a
rich
merchant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
put
up
at
an
inn
they
both
went
to
sleep
,
and
next
morning
his
*NL*
companion
was
found
robbed
and
with
his
throat
cut
.
A
bloodstained
knife
*NL*
was
found
under
the
old
merchant
's
pillow
.
He
was
tried
,
knouted
,
and
*NL*
his
nostrils
having
been
torn
off
,
``
all
in
due
form
''
as
Karataev
put
it
,
*NL*
he
was
sent
to
hard
labor
in
Siberia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
brother
''
-LRB-
it
was
at
this
point
that
Pierre
came
up
-RRB-
,
``
ten
years
*NL*
or
more
passed
by
.
The
old
man
was
living
as
a
convict
,
submitting
as
he
*NL*
should
and
doing
no
wrong
.
Only
he
prayed
to
God
for
death
.
Well
,
one
*NL*
night
the
convicts
were
gathered
just
as
we
are
,
with
the
old
man
among
*NL*
them
.
And
they
began
telling
what
each
was
suffering
for
,
and
how
they
*NL*
had
sinned
against
God
.
One
told
how
he
had
taken
a
life
,
another
had
*NL*
taken
two
,
a
third
had
set
a
house
on
fire
,
while
another
had
simply
*NL*
been
a
vagrant
and
had
done
nothing
.
So
they
asked
the
old
man
:
`
What
*NL*
are
you
being
punished
for
,
Daddy
?
'
--
`
I
,
my
dear
brothers
,
'
said
he
,
`
am
*NL*
being
punished
for
my
own
and
other
men
's
sins
.
But
I
have
not
killed
*NL*
anyone
or
taken
anything
that
was
not
mine
,
but
have
only
helped
my
*NL*
poorer
brothers
.
I
was
a
merchant
,
my
dear
brothers
,
and
had
much
*NL*
property
.
`
And
he
went
on
to
tell
them
all
about
it
in
due
order
.
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
grieve
for
myself
,
'
he
says
,
`
God
,
it
seems
,
has
chastened
me
.
*NL*
Only
I
am
sorry
for
my
old
wife
and
the
children
,
'
and
the
old
man
began
*NL*
to
weep
.
Now
it
happened
that
in
the
group
was
the
very
man
who
had
*NL*
killed
the
other
merchant
.
`
Where
did
it
happen
,
Daddy
?
'
he
said
.
`
When
,
*NL*
and
in
what
month
?
'
He
asked
all
about
it
and
his
heart
began
to
ache
.
*NL*
So
he
comes
up
to
the
old
man
like
this
,
and
falls
down
at
his
feet
!
*NL*
`
You
are
perishing
because
of
me
,
Daddy
,
'
he
says
.
`
It
's
quite
true
,
*NL*
lads
,
that
this
man
,
'
he
says
,
`
is
being
tortured
innocently
and
for
*NL*
nothing
!
I
,
'
he
says
,
`
did
that
deed
,
and
I
put
the
knife
under
your
*NL*
head
while
you
were
asleep
.
Forgive
me
,
Daddy
,
'
he
says
,
`
for
Christ
's
*NL*
sake
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Karataev
paused
,
smiling
joyously
as
he
gazed
into
the
fire
,
and
he
drew
*NL*
the
logs
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
old
man
said
,
`
God
will
forgive
you
,
we
are
all
sinners
in
His
*NL*
sight
.
I
suffer
for
my
own
sins
,
'
and
he
wept
bitter
tears
.
Well
,
and
*NL*
what
do
you
think
,
dear
friends
?
''
Karataev
continued
,
his
face
*NL*
brightening
more
and
more
with
a
rapturous
smile
as
if
what
he
now
had
*NL*
to
tell
contained
the
chief
charm
and
the
whole
meaning
of
his
story
:
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
,
dear
fellows
?
That
murderer
confessed
to
the
*NL*
authorities
.
'
I
have
taken
six
lives
,
'
he
says
-LRB-
he
was
a
great
sinner
-RRB-
,
*NL*
`
but
what
I
am
most
sorry
for
is
this
old
man
.
Do
n't
let
him
suffer
*NL*
because
of
me
.
'
So
he
confessed
and
it
was
all
written
down
and
the
*NL*
papers
sent
off
in
due
form
.
The
place
was
a
long
way
off
,
and
while
*NL*
they
were
judging
,
what
with
one
thing
and
another
,
filling
in
the
*NL*
papers
all
in
due
form
--
the
authorities
I
mean
--
time
passed
.
The
affair
*NL*
reached
the
Tsar
.
After
a
while
the
Tsar
's
decree
came
:
to
set
the
*NL*
merchant
free
and
give
him
a
compensation
that
had
been
awarded
.
The
*NL*
paper
arrived
and
they
began
to
look
for
the
old
man
.
`
Where
is
the
old
*NL*
man
who
has
been
suffering
innocently
and
in
vain
?
A
paper
has
come
from
*NL*
the
Tsar
!
'
so
they
began
looking
for
him
,
''
here
Karataev
's
lower
jaw
*NL*
trembled
,
``
but
God
had
already
forgiven
him
--
he
was
dead
!
That
's
how
it
*NL*
was
,
dear
fellows
!
''
Karataev
concluded
and
sat
for
a
long
time
silent
,
*NL*
gazing
before
him
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Pierre
's
soul
was
dimly
but
joyfully
filled
not
by
the
story
itself
*NL*
but
by
its
mysterious
significance
:
by
the
rapturous
joy
that
lit
up
*NL*
Karataev
's
face
as
he
told
it
,
and
the
mystic
significance
of
that
joy
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
vos
places
!
''
*
suddenly
cried
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
To
your
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pleasant
feeling
of
excitement
and
an
expectation
of
something
joyful
*NL*
and
solemn
was
aroused
among
the
soldiers
of
the
convoy
and
the
*NL*
prisoners
.
From
all
sides
came
shouts
of
command
,
and
from
the
left
came
*NL*
smartly
dressed
cavalrymen
on
good
horses
,
passing
the
prisoners
at
a
*NL*
trot
.
The
expression
on
all
faces
showed
the
tension
people
feel
at
the
*NL*
approach
of
those
in
authority
.
The
prisoners
thronged
together
and
were
*NL*
pushed
off
the
road
.
The
convoy
formed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
!
The
Emperor
!
The
Marshal
!
The
Duke
!
''
and
hardly
had
the
*NL*
sleek
cavalry
passed
,
before
a
carriage
drawn
by
six
gray
horses
rattled
*NL*
by
.
Pierre
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
man
in
a
three-cornered
hat
with
a
*NL*
tranquil
look
on
his
handsome
,
plump
,
white
face
.
It
was
one
of
the
*NL*
marshals
.
His
eye
fell
on
Pierre
's
large
and
striking
figure
,
and
in
the
*NL*
expression
with
which
he
frowned
and
looked
away
Pierre
thought
he
*NL*
detected
sympathy
and
a
desire
to
conceal
that
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
in
charge
of
the
stores
galloped
after
the
carriage
with
a
*NL*
red
and
frightened
face
,
whipping
up
his
skinny
horse
.
Several
officers
*NL*
formed
a
group
and
some
soldiers
crowded
round
them
.
Their
faces
all
*NL*
looked
excited
and
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
say
?
What
did
he
say
?
''
Pierre
heard
them
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
marshal
was
passing
,
the
prisoners
had
huddled
together
in
a
*NL*
crowd
,
and
Pierre
saw
Karataev
whom
he
had
not
yet
seen
that
morning
.
He
*NL*
sat
in
his
short
overcoat
leaning
against
a
birch
tree
.
On
his
face
,
*NL*
besides
the
look
of
joyful
emotion
it
had
worn
yesterday
while
telling
*NL*
the
tale
of
the
merchant
who
suffered
innocently
,
there
was
now
an
*NL*
expression
of
quiet
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Karataev
looked
at
Pierre
with
his
kindly
round
eyes
now
filled
with
*NL*
tears
,
evidently
wishing
him
to
come
near
that
he
might
say
something
to
*NL*
him
.
But
Pierre
was
not
sufficiently
sure
of
himself
.
He
made
as
if
he
*NL*
did
not
notice
that
look
and
moved
hastily
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prisoners
again
went
forward
Pierre
looked
round
.
Karataev
was
*NL*
still
sitting
at
the
side
of
the
road
under
the
birch
tree
and
two
*NL*
Frenchmen
were
talking
over
his
head
.
Pierre
did
not
look
round
again
*NL*
but
went
limping
up
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
behind
,
where
Karataev
had
been
sitting
,
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
.
*NL*
Pierre
heard
it
plainly
,
but
at
that
moment
he
remembered
that
he
had
*NL*
not
yet
finished
reckoning
up
how
many
stages
still
remained
to
*NL*
Smolensk
--
a
calculation
he
had
begun
before
the
marshal
went
by
.
And
he
*NL*
again
started
reckoning
.
Two
French
soldiers
ran
past
Pierre
,
one
of
*NL*
whom
carried
a
lowered
and
smoking
gun
.
They
both
looked
pale
,
and
in
*NL*
the
expression
on
their
faces
--
one
of
them
glanced
timidly
at
Pierre
--
*NL*
there
was
something
resembling
what
he
had
seen
on
the
face
of
the
young
*NL*
soldier
at
the
execution
.
Pierre
looked
at
the
soldier
and
remembered
*NL*
that
,
two
days
before
,
that
man
had
burned
his
shirt
while
drying
it
at
*NL*
the
fire
and
how
they
had
laughed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
him
,
where
Karataev
had
been
sitting
,
the
dog
began
to
howl
.
*NL*
``
What
a
stupid
beast
!
Why
is
it
howling
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
comrades
,
the
prisoner
soldiers
walking
beside
him
,
avoided
looking
*NL*
back
at
the
place
where
the
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
dog
was
howling
,
*NL*
just
as
Pierre
did
,
but
there
was
a
set
look
on
all
their
faces
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
The
stores
,
the
prisoners
,
and
the
marshal
's
baggage
train
stopped
at
*NL*
the
village
of
Shamshevo
.
The
men
crowded
together
round
the
campfires
.
*NL*
Pierre
went
up
to
the
fire
,
ate
some
roast
horseflesh
,
lay
down
with
his
*NL*
back
to
the
fire
,
and
immediately
fell
asleep
.
He
again
slept
as
he
had
*NL*
done
at
Mozhaysk
after
the
battle
of
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
real
events
mingled
with
dreams
and
again
someone
,
he
or
another
,
*NL*
gave
expression
to
his
thoughts
,
and
even
to
the
same
thoughts
that
had
*NL*
been
expressed
in
his
dream
at
Mozhaysk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Life
is
everything
.
Life
is
God
.
Everything
changes
and
moves
and
that
*NL*
movement
is
God
.
And
while
there
is
life
there
is
joy
in
consciousness
*NL*
of
the
divine
.
To
love
life
is
to
love
God
.
Harder
and
more
blessed
than
*NL*
all
else
is
to
love
this
life
in
one
's
sufferings
,
in
innocent
*NL*
sufferings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Karataev
!
''
came
to
Pierre
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
he
saw
vividly
before
him
a
long-forgotten
,
kindly
old
man
*NL*
who
had
given
him
geography
lessons
in
Switzerland
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
man
,
and
showed
Pierre
a
globe
.
This
globe
was
alive
--
a
*NL*
vibrating
ball
without
fixed
dimensions
.
Its
whole
surface
consisted
of
*NL*
drops
closely
pressed
together
,
and
all
these
drops
moved
and
changed
*NL*
places
,
sometimes
several
of
them
merging
into
one
,
sometimes
one
*NL*
dividing
into
many
.
Each
drop
tried
to
spread
out
and
occupy
as
much
*NL*
space
as
possible
,
but
others
striving
to
do
the
same
compressed
it
,
*NL*
sometimes
destroyed
it
,
and
sometimes
merged
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
life
,
''
said
the
old
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
simple
and
clear
it
is
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
How
is
it
I
did
not
know
*NL*
it
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
is
in
the
midst
,
and
each
drop
tries
to
expand
so
as
to
reflect
Him
*NL*
to
the
greatest
extent
.
And
it
grows
,
merges
,
disappears
from
the
*NL*
surface
,
sinks
to
the
depths
,
and
again
emerges
.
There
now
,
Karataev
has
*NL*
spread
out
and
disappeared
.
Do
you
understand
,
my
child
?
''
said
the
*NL*
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
,
damn
you
?
''
shouted
a
voice
,
and
Pierre
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
himself
and
sat
up
.
A
Frenchman
who
had
just
pushed
a
Russian
*NL*
soldier
away
was
squatting
by
the
fire
,
engaged
in
roasting
a
piece
of
*NL*
meat
stuck
on
a
ramrod
.
His
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
his
sinewy
,
*NL*
hairy
,
red
hands
with
their
short
fingers
deftly
turned
the
ramrod
.
His
*NL*
brown
morose
face
with
frowning
brows
was
clearly
visible
by
the
glow
of
*NL*
the
charcoal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
same
to
him
,
''
he
muttered
,
turning
quickly
to
a
soldier
*NL*
who
stood
behind
him
.
``
Brigand
!
Get
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
twisting
the
ramrod
he
looked
gloomily
at
Pierre
,
who
turned
away
*NL*
and
gazed
into
the
darkness
.
A
prisoner
,
the
Russian
soldier
the
*NL*
Frenchman
had
pushed
away
,
was
sitting
near
the
fire
patting
something
*NL*
with
his
hand
.
Looking
more
closely
Pierre
recognized
the
blue-gray
dog
,
*NL*
sitting
beside
the
soldier
,
wagging
its
tail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
's
come
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
And
Plat
-
''
he
began
,
but
did
not
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
and
simultaneously
a
crowd
of
memories
awoke
in
his
fancy
--
of
*NL*
the
look
Platon
had
given
him
as
he
sat
under
the
tree
,
of
the
shot
*NL*
heard
from
that
spot
,
of
the
dog
's
howl
,
of
the
guilty
faces
of
the
two
*NL*
Frenchmen
as
they
ran
past
him
,
of
the
lowered
and
smoking
gun
,
and
of
*NL*
Karataev
's
absence
at
this
halt
--
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
realizing
*NL*
that
Karataev
had
been
killed
,
but
just
at
that
instant
,
he
knew
not
*NL*
why
,
the
recollection
came
to
his
mind
of
a
summer
evening
he
had
spent
*NL*
with
a
beautiful
Polish
lady
on
the
veranda
of
his
house
in
Kiev
.
And
*NL*
without
linking
up
the
events
of
the
day
or
drawing
a
conclusion
from
*NL*
them
,
Pierre
closed
his
eyes
,
seeing
a
vision
of
the
country
in
*NL*
summertime
mingled
with
memories
of
bathing
and
of
the
liquid
,
vibrating
*NL*
globe
,
and
he
sank
into
water
so
that
it
closed
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
sunrise
he
was
awakened
by
shouts
and
loud
and
rapid
firing
.
*NL*
French
soldiers
were
running
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Cossacks
!
''
one
of
them
shouted
,
and
a
moment
later
a
crowd
of
*NL*
Russians
surrounded
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
he
could
not
understand
what
was
happening
to
him
.
All
*NL*
around
he
heard
his
comrades
sobbing
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brothers
!
Dear
fellows
!
Darlings
!
''
old
soldiers
exclaimed
,
weeping
,
as
*NL*
they
embraced
Cossacks
and
hussars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hussars
and
Cossacks
crowded
round
the
prisoners
;
one
offered
them
*NL*
clothes
,
another
boots
,
and
a
third
bread
.
Pierre
sobbed
as
he
sat
among
*NL*
them
and
could
not
utter
a
word
.
He
hugged
the
first
soldier
who
*NL*
approached
him
,
and
kissed
him
,
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolokhov
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
ruined
house
,
letting
a
crowd
of
*NL*
disarmed
Frenchmen
pass
by
.
The
French
,
excited
by
all
that
had
*NL*
happened
,
were
talking
loudly
among
themselves
,
but
as
they
passed
*NL*
Dolokhov
who
gently
switched
his
boots
with
his
whip
and
watched
them
*NL*
with
cold
glassy
eyes
that
boded
no
good
,
they
became
silent
.
On
the
*NL*
opposite
side
stood
Dolokhov
's
Cossack
,
counting
the
prisoners
and
*NL*
marking
off
each
hundred
with
a
chalk
line
on
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
?
''
Dolokhov
asked
the
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
second
hundred
,
''
replied
the
Cossack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Filez
,
filez
!
''
*
Dolokhov
kept
saying
,
having
adopted
this
expression
*NL*
from
the
French
,
and
when
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
prisoners
they
*NL*
flashed
with
a
cruel
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Get
along
,
get
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
bareheaded
and
with
a
gloomy
face
,
walked
behind
some
Cossacks
*NL*
who
were
carrying
the
body
of
Petya
Rostov
to
a
hole
that
had
been
dug
*NL*
in
the
garden
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
twenty-eighth
of
October
when
the
frosts
began
,
the
flight
of
*NL*
the
French
assumed
a
still
more
tragic
character
,
with
men
freezing
,
or
*NL*
roasting
themselves
to
death
at
the
campfires
,
while
carriages
with
*NL*
people
dressed
in
furs
continued
to
drive
past
,
carrying
away
the
*NL*
property
that
had
been
stolen
by
the
Emperor
,
kings
,
and
dukes
;
but
the
*NL*
process
of
the
flight
and
disintegration
of
the
French
army
went
on
*NL*
essentially
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Moscow
to
Vyazma
the
French
army
of
seventy-three
thousand
men
not
*NL*
reckoning
the
Guards
-LRB-
who
did
nothing
during
the
whole
war
but
pillage
-RRB-
*NL*
was
reduced
to
thirty-six
thousand
,
though
not
more
than
five
thousand
*NL*
had
fallen
in
battle
.
From
this
beginning
the
succeeding
terms
of
the
*NL*
progression
could
be
determined
mathematically
.
The
French
army
melted
*NL*
away
and
perished
at
the
same
rate
from
Moscow
to
Vyazma
,
from
Vyazma
to
*NL*
Smolensk
,
from
Smolensk
to
the
Berezina
,
and
from
the
Berezina
to
Vilna
-
*NL*
-
independently
of
the
greater
or
lesser
intensity
of
the
cold
,
the
*NL*
pursuit
,
the
barring
of
the
way
,
or
any
other
particular
conditions
.
*NL*
Beyond
Vyazma
the
French
army
instead
of
moving
in
three
columns
huddled
*NL*
together
into
one
mass
,
and
so
went
on
to
the
end
.
Berthier
wrote
to
his
*NL*
Emperor
-LRB-
we
know
how
far
commanding
officers
allow
themselves
to
diverge
*NL*
from
the
truth
in
describing
the
condition
of
an
army
-RRB-
and
this
is
what
*NL*
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
deem
it
my
duty
to
report
to
Your
Majesty
the
condition
of
the
various
*NL*
corps
I
have
had
occasion
to
observe
during
different
stages
of
the
last
*NL*
two
or
three
days
'
march
.
They
are
almost
disbanded
.
Scarcely
a
quarter
*NL*
of
the
soldiers
remain
with
the
standards
of
their
regiments
,
the
others
*NL*
go
off
by
themselves
in
different
directions
hoping
to
find
food
and
*NL*
escape
discipline
.
In
general
they
regard
Smolensk
as
the
place
where
*NL*
they
hope
to
recover
.
During
the
last
few
days
many
of
the
men
have
been
*NL*
seen
to
throw
away
their
cartridges
and
their
arms
.
In
such
a
state
of
*NL*
affairs
,
whatever
your
ultimate
plans
may
be
,
the
interest
of
Your
*NL*
Majesty
's
service
demands
that
the
army
should
be
rallied
at
Smolensk
*NL*
and
should
first
of
all
be
freed
from
ineffectives
,
such
as
dismounted
*NL*
cavalry
,
unnecessary
baggage
,
and
artillery
material
that
is
no
longer
*NL*
in
proportion
to
the
present
forces
.
The
soldiers
,
who
are
worn
out
with
*NL*
hunger
and
fatigue
,
need
these
supplies
as
well
as
a
few
days
'
rest
.
*NL*
Many
have
died
these
last
days
on
the
road
or
at
the
bivouacs
.
This
*NL*
state
of
things
is
continually
becoming
worse
and
makes
one
fear
that
*NL*
unless
a
prompt
remedy
is
applied
the
troops
will
no
longer
be
under
*NL*
control
in
case
of
an
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
November
9
:
twenty
miles
from
Smolensk
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
staggering
into
Smolensk
which
seemed
to
them
a
promised
land
,
the
*NL*
French
,
searching
for
food
,
killed
one
another
,
sacked
their
own
stores
,
*NL*
and
when
everything
had
been
plundered
fled
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
went
without
knowing
whither
or
why
they
were
going
.
Still
less
*NL*
did
that
genius
,
Napoleon
,
know
it
,
for
no
one
issued
any
orders
to
him
.
*NL*
But
still
he
and
those
about
him
retained
their
old
habits
:
wrote
*NL*
commands
,
letters
,
reports
,
and
orders
of
the
day
;
called
one
another
*NL*
sire
,
mon
cousin
,
prince
d'Eckmuhl
,
roi
de
Naples
,
and
so
on
.
But
these
*NL*
orders
and
reports
were
only
on
paper
,
nothing
in
them
was
acted
upon
*NL*
for
they
could
not
be
carried
out
,
and
though
they
entitled
one
another
*NL*
Majesties
,
Highnesses
,
or
Cousins
,
they
all
felt
that
they
were
*NL*
miserable
wretches
who
had
done
much
evil
for
which
they
had
now
to
pay
.
*NL*
And
though
they
pretended
to
be
concerned
about
the
army
,
each
was
*NL*
thinking
only
of
himself
and
of
how
to
get
away
quickly
and
save
*NL*
himself
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
The
movements
of
the
Russian
and
French
armies
during
the
campaign
from
*NL*
Moscow
back
to
the
Niemen
were
like
those
in
a
game
of
Russian
*NL*
blindman
's
bluff
,
in
which
two
players
are
blindfolded
and
one
of
them
*NL*
occasionally
rings
a
little
bell
to
inform
the
catcher
of
his
*NL*
whereabouts
.
First
he
rings
his
bell
fearlessly
,
but
when
he
gets
into
a
*NL*
tight
place
he
runs
away
as
quietly
as
he
can
,
and
often
thinking
to
*NL*
escape
runs
straight
into
his
opponent
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
while
they
were
still
moving
along
the
Kaluga
road
,
Napoleon
's
*NL*
armies
made
their
presence
known
,
but
later
when
they
reached
the
*NL*
Smolensk
road
they
ran
holding
the
clapper
of
their
bell
tight
--
and
*NL*
often
thinking
they
were
escaping
ran
right
into
the
Russians
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
the
rapidity
of
the
French
flight
and
the
Russian
pursuit
and
*NL*
the
consequent
exhaustion
of
the
horses
,
the
chief
means
of
*NL*
approximately
ascertaining
the
enemy
's
position
--
by
cavalry
scouting
--
*NL*
was
not
available
.
Besides
,
as
a
result
of
the
frequent
and
rapid
change
*NL*
of
position
by
each
army
,
even
what
information
was
obtained
could
not
*NL*
be
delivered
in
time
.
If
news
was
received
one
day
that
the
enemy
had
*NL*
been
in
a
certain
position
the
day
before
,
by
the
third
day
when
*NL*
something
could
have
been
done
,
that
army
was
already
two
days
'
march
*NL*
farther
on
and
in
quite
another
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
army
fled
and
the
other
pursued
.
Beyond
Smolensk
there
were
several
*NL*
different
roads
available
for
the
French
,
and
one
would
have
thought
*NL*
that
during
their
stay
of
four
days
they
might
have
learned
where
the
*NL*
enemy
was
,
might
have
arranged
some
more
advantageous
plan
and
*NL*
undertaken
something
new
.
But
after
a
four
days
'
halt
the
mob
,
with
no
*NL*
maneuvers
or
plans
,
again
began
running
along
the
beaten
track
,
neither
*NL*
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
along
the
old
--
the
worst
--
road
,
through
*NL*
Krasnoe
and
Orsha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Expecting
the
enemy
from
behind
and
not
in
front
,
the
French
separated
*NL*
in
their
flight
and
spread
out
over
a
distance
of
twenty-four
hours
.
In
*NL*
front
of
them
all
fled
the
Emperor
,
then
the
kings
,
then
the
dukes
.
The
*NL*
Russian
army
,
expecting
Napoleon
to
take
the
road
to
the
right
beyond
*NL*
the
Dnieper
--
which
was
the
only
reasonable
thing
for
him
to
do
--
*NL*
themselves
turned
to
the
right
and
came
out
onto
the
highroad
at
*NL*
Krasnoe
.
And
here
as
in
a
game
of
blindman
's
buff
the
French
ran
into
*NL*
our
vanguard
.
Seeing
their
enemy
unexpectedly
the
French
fell
into
*NL*
confusion
and
stopped
short
from
the
sudden
fright
,
but
then
they
*NL*
resumed
their
flight
,
abandoning
their
comrades
who
were
farther
behind
.
*NL*
Then
for
three
days
separate
portions
of
the
French
army
--
first
Murat
's
*NL*
-LRB-
the
vice-king
's
-RRB-
,
then
Davout
's
,
and
then
Ney
's
--
ran
,
as
it
were
,
the
*NL*
gauntlet
of
the
Russian
army
.
They
abandoned
one
another
,
abandoned
all
*NL*
their
heavy
baggage
,
their
artillery
,
and
half
their
men
,
and
fled
,
*NL*
getting
past
the
Russians
by
night
by
making
semicircles
to
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ney
,
who
came
last
,
had
been
busying
himself
blowing
up
the
walls
of
*NL*
Smolensk
which
were
in
nobody
's
way
,
because
despite
the
unfortunate
*NL*
plight
of
the
French
or
because
of
it
,
they
wished
to
punish
the
floor
*NL*
against
which
they
had
hurt
themselves
.
Ney
,
who
had
had
a
corps
of
ten
*NL*
thousand
men
,
reached
Napoleon
at
Orsha
with
only
one
thousand
men
left
,
*NL*
having
abandoned
all
the
rest
and
all
his
cannon
,
and
having
crossed
the
*NL*
Dnieper
at
night
by
stealth
at
a
wooded
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Orsha
they
fled
farther
along
the
road
to
Vilna
,
still
playing
at
*NL*
blindman
's
buff
with
the
pursuing
army
.
At
the
Berezina
they
again
*NL*
became
disorganized
,
many
were
drowned
and
many
surrendered
,
but
those
*NL*
who
got
across
the
river
fled
farther
.
Their
supreme
chief
donned
a
fur
*NL*
coat
and
,
having
seated
himself
in
a
sleigh
,
galloped
on
alone
,
*NL*
abandoning
his
companions
.
The
others
who
could
do
so
drove
away
too
,
*NL*
leaving
those
who
could
not
to
surrender
or
die
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
This
campaign
consisted
in
a
flight
of
the
French
during
which
they
did
*NL*
all
they
could
to
destroy
themselves
.
From
the
time
they
turned
onto
the
*NL*
Kaluga
road
to
the
day
their
leader
fled
from
the
army
,
none
of
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
crowd
had
any
sense
.
So
one
might
have
thought
that
*NL*
regarding
this
period
of
the
campaign
the
historians
,
who
attributed
the
*NL*
actions
of
the
mass
to
the
will
of
one
man
,
would
have
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
make
the
story
of
the
retreat
fit
their
theory
.
But
no
!
*NL*
Mountains
of
books
have
been
written
by
the
historians
about
this
*NL*
campaign
,
and
everywhere
are
described
Napoleon
's
arrangements
,
the
*NL*
maneuvers
,
and
his
profound
plans
which
guided
the
army
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
military
genius
shown
by
his
marshals
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
retreat
from
Malo-Yaroslavets
when
he
had
a
free
road
into
a
well
-
*NL*
supplied
district
and
the
parallel
road
was
open
to
him
along
which
*NL*
Kutuzov
afterwards
pursued
him
--
this
unnecessary
retreat
along
a
*NL*
devastated
road
--
is
explained
to
us
as
being
due
to
profound
*NL*
considerations
.
Similarly
profound
considerations
are
given
for
his
*NL*
retreat
from
Smolensk
to
Orsha
.
Then
his
heroism
at
Krasnoe
is
*NL*
described
,
where
he
is
reported
to
have
been
prepared
to
accept
battle
*NL*
and
take
personal
command
,
and
to
have
walked
about
with
a
birch
stick
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
J'ai
assez
fait
l'empereur
;
il
est
temps
de
faire
le
general
,
''
*
but
*NL*
nevertheless
immediately
ran
away
again
,
abandoning
to
its
fate
the
*NL*
scattered
fragments
of
the
army
he
left
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
I
have
acted
the
Emperor
long
enough
;
it
is
time
to
act
the
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
are
told
of
the
greatness
of
soul
of
the
marshals
,
especially
of
*NL*
Ney
--
a
greatness
of
soul
consisting
in
this
:
that
he
made
his
way
by
*NL*
night
around
through
the
forest
and
across
the
Dnieper
and
escaped
to
*NL*
Orsha
,
abandoning
standards
,
artillery
,
and
nine
tenths
of
his
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
lastly
,
the
final
departure
of
the
great
Emperor
from
his
heroic
*NL*
army
is
presented
to
us
by
the
historians
as
something
great
and
*NL*
characteristic
of
genius
.
Even
that
final
running
away
,
described
in
*NL*
ordinary
language
as
the
lowest
depth
of
baseness
which
every
child
is
*NL*
taught
to
be
ashamed
of
--
even
that
act
finds
justification
in
the
*NL*
historians
'
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
is
impossible
to
stretch
the
very
elastic
threads
of
historical
*NL*
ratiocination
any
farther
,
when
actions
are
clearly
contrary
to
all
that
*NL*
humanity
calls
right
or
even
just
,
the
historians
produce
a
saving
*NL*
conception
of
``
greatness
.
''
``
Greatness
,
''
it
seems
,
excludes
the
standards
*NL*
of
right
and
wrong
.
For
the
``
great
''
man
nothing
is
wrong
,
there
is
no
*NL*
atrocity
for
which
a
``
great
''
man
can
be
blamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
grand
!
''
*
say
the
historians
,
and
there
no
longer
exists
either
*NL*
good
or
evil
but
only
``
grand
''
and
``
not
grand
.
''
Grand
is
good
,
not
grand
*NL*
is
bad
.
Grand
is
the
characteristic
,
in
their
conception
,
of
some
*NL*
special
animals
called
``
heroes
.
''
And
Napoleon
,
escaping
home
in
a
warm
*NL*
fur
coat
and
leaving
to
perish
those
who
were
not
merely
his
comrades
*NL*
but
were
-LRB-
in
his
opinion
-RRB-
men
he
had
brought
there
,
feels
que
c'est
*NL*
grand
,
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
and
his
soul
is
tranquil
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
It
is
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
That
it
is
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Du
sublime
-LRB-
he
saw
something
sublime
in
himself
-RRB-
au
ridicule
il
n
'
y
a
*NL*
qu'un
pas
,
''
*
said
he
.
And
the
whole
world
for
fifty
years
has
been
*NL*
repeating
:
``
Sublime
!
Grand
!
Napoleon
le
Grand
!
''
Du
sublime
au
ridicule
*NL*
il
n
'
y
a
qu'un
pas
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
From
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
is
but
a
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
occurs
to
no
one
that
to
admit
a
greatness
not
commensurable
with
*NL*
the
standard
of
right
and
wrong
is
merely
to
admit
one
's
own
nothingness
*NL*
and
immeasurable
meanness
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
us
with
the
standard
of
good
and
evil
given
us
by
Christ
,
no
human
*NL*
actions
are
incommensurable
.
And
there
is
no
greatness
where
simplicity
,
*NL*
goodness
,
and
truth
are
absent
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
What
Russian
,
reading
the
account
of
the
last
part
of
the
campaign
of
*NL*
1812
,
has
not
experienced
an
uncomfortable
feeling
of
regret
,
*NL*
dissatisfaction
,
and
perplexity
?
Who
has
not
asked
himself
how
it
is
*NL*
that
the
French
were
not
all
captured
or
destroyed
when
our
three
armies
*NL*
surrounded
them
in
superior
numbers
,
when
the
disordered
French
,
hungry
*NL*
and
freezing
,
surrendered
in
crowds
,
and
when
-LRB-
as
the
historians
relate
-RRB-
*NL*
the
aim
of
the
Russians
was
to
stop
the
French
,
to
cut
them
off
,
and
*NL*
capture
them
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
it
that
the
Russian
army
,
which
when
numerically
weaker
than
the
*NL*
French
had
given
battle
at
Borodino
,
did
not
achieve
its
purpose
when
it
*NL*
had
surrounded
the
French
on
three
sides
and
when
its
aim
was
to
capture
*NL*
them
?
Can
the
French
be
so
enormously
superior
to
us
that
when
we
had
*NL*
surrounded
them
with
superior
forces
we
could
not
beat
them
?
How
could
*NL*
that
happen
?
*NL*
*NL*
History
-LRB-
or
what
is
called
by
that
name
-RRB-
replying
to
these
questions
*NL*
says
that
this
occurred
because
Kutuzov
and
Tormasov
and
Chichagov
,
and
*NL*
this
man
and
that
man
,
did
not
execute
such
and
such
maneuvers
...
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
did
they
not
execute
those
maneuvers
?
And
why
if
they
were
*NL*
guilty
of
not
carrying
out
a
prearranged
plan
were
they
not
tried
and
*NL*
punished
?
But
even
if
we
admitted
that
Kutuzov
,
Chichagov
,
and
others
*NL*
were
the
cause
of
the
Russian
failures
,
it
is
still
incomprehensible
*NL*
why
,
the
position
of
the
Russian
army
being
what
it
was
at
Krasnoe
and
*NL*
at
the
Berezina
-LRB-
in
both
cases
we
had
superior
forces
-RRB-
,
the
French
army
*NL*
with
its
marshals
,
kings
,
and
Emperor
was
not
captured
,
if
that
was
what
*NL*
the
Russians
aimed
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
explanation
of
this
strange
fact
given
by
Russian
military
*NL*
historians
-LRB-
to
the
effect
that
Kutuzov
hindered
an
attack
-RRB-
is
unfounded
,
*NL*
for
we
know
that
he
could
not
restrain
the
troops
from
attacking
at
*NL*
Vyazma
and
Tarutino
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
was
the
Russian
army
--
which
with
inferior
forces
had
withstood
the
*NL*
enemy
in
full
strength
at
Borodino
--
defeated
at
Krasnoe
and
the
Berezina
*NL*
by
the
disorganized
crowds
of
the
French
when
it
was
numerically
*NL*
superior
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
aim
of
the
Russians
consisted
in
cutting
off
and
capturing
*NL*
Napoleon
and
his
marshals
--
and
that
aim
was
not
merely
frustrated
but
*NL*
all
attempts
to
attain
it
were
most
shamefully
baffled
--
then
this
last
*NL*
period
of
the
campaign
is
quite
rightly
considered
by
the
French
to
be
a
*NL*
series
of
victories
,
and
quite
wrongly
considered
victorious
by
Russian
*NL*
historians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
military
historians
in
so
far
as
they
submit
to
claims
of
*NL*
logic
must
admit
that
conclusion
,
and
in
spite
of
their
lyrical
*NL*
rhapsodies
about
valor
,
devotion
,
and
so
forth
,
must
reluctantly
admit
*NL*
that
the
French
retreat
from
Moscow
was
a
series
of
victories
for
*NL*
Napoleon
and
defeats
for
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
putting
national
vanity
entirely
aside
one
feels
that
such
a
*NL*
conclusion
involves
a
contradiction
,
since
the
series
of
French
*NL*
victories
brought
the
French
complete
destruction
,
while
the
series
of
*NL*
Russian
defeats
led
to
the
total
destruction
of
their
enemy
and
the
*NL*
liberation
of
their
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
source
of
this
contradiction
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
historians
*NL*
studying
the
events
from
the
letters
of
the
sovereigns
and
the
generals
,
*NL*
from
memoirs
,
reports
,
projects
,
and
so
forth
,
have
attributed
to
this
*NL*
last
period
of
the
war
of
1812
an
aim
that
never
existed
,
namely
that
of
*NL*
cutting
off
and
capturing
Napoleon
with
his
marshals
and
his
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
never
was
or
could
have
been
such
an
aim
,
for
it
would
have
been
*NL*
senseless
and
its
attainment
quite
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
senseless
,
first
because
Napoleon
's
disorganized
army
*NL*
was
flying
from
Russia
with
all
possible
speed
,
that
is
to
say
,
was
*NL*
doing
just
what
every
Russian
desired
.
So
what
was
the
use
of
performing
*NL*
various
operations
on
the
French
who
were
running
away
as
fast
as
they
*NL*
possibly
could
?
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
block
the
passage
of
men
whose
*NL*
whole
energy
was
directed
to
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirdly
,
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
sacrifice
one
's
own
troops
in
*NL*
order
to
destroy
the
French
army
,
which
without
external
interference
*NL*
was
destroying
itself
at
such
a
rate
that
,
though
its
path
was
not
*NL*
blocked
,
it
could
not
carry
across
the
frontier
more
than
it
actually
*NL*
did
in
December
,
namely
a
hundredth
part
of
the
original
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fourthly
,
it
would
have
been
senseless
to
wish
to
take
captive
the
*NL*
Emperor
,
kings
,
and
dukes
--
whose
capture
would
have
been
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
embarrassing
for
the
Russians
,
as
the
most
adroit
diplomatists
of
*NL*
the
time
-LRB-
Joseph
de
Maistre
and
others
-RRB-
recognized
.
Still
more
senseless
*NL*
would
have
been
the
wish
to
capture
army
corps
of
the
French
,
when
our
*NL*
own
army
had
melted
away
to
half
before
reaching
Krasnoe
and
a
whole
*NL*
division
would
have
been
needed
to
convoy
the
corps
of
prisoners
,
and
*NL*
when
our
men
were
not
always
getting
full
rations
and
the
prisoners
*NL*
already
taken
were
perishing
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
profound
plans
about
cutting
off
and
capturing
Napoleon
and
his
*NL*
army
were
like
the
plan
of
a
market
gardener
who
,
when
driving
out
of
*NL*
his
garden
a
cow
that
had
trampled
down
the
beds
he
had
planted
,
should
*NL*
run
to
the
gate
and
hit
the
cow
on
the
head
.
The
only
thing
to
be
said
*NL*
in
excuse
of
that
gardener
would
be
that
he
was
very
angry
.
But
not
even
*NL*
that
could
be
said
for
those
who
drew
up
this
project
,
for
it
was
not
*NL*
they
who
had
suffered
from
the
trampled
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
the
fact
that
cutting
off
Napoleon
with
his
army
would
have
*NL*
been
senseless
,
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
first
because
--
as
experience
shows
that
a
three-mile
*NL*
movement
of
columns
on
a
battlefield
never
coincides
with
the
plans
--
the
*NL*
probability
of
Chichagov
,
Kutuzov
,
and
Wittgenstein
effecting
a
junction
*NL*
on
time
at
an
appointed
place
was
so
remote
as
to
be
tantamount
to
*NL*
impossibility
,
as
in
fact
thought
Kutuzov
,
who
when
he
received
the
plan
*NL*
remarked
that
diversions
planned
over
great
distances
do
not
yield
the
*NL*
desired
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
it
was
impossible
,
because
to
paralyze
the
momentum
with
which
*NL*
Napoleon
's
army
was
retiring
,
incomparably
greater
forces
than
the
*NL*
Russians
possessed
would
have
been
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirdly
it
was
impossible
,
because
the
military
term
``
to
cut
off
''
has
no
*NL*
meaning
.
One
can
cut
off
a
slice
of
bread
,
but
not
an
army
.
To
cut
off
*NL*
an
army
--
to
bar
its
road
--
is
quite
impossible
,
for
there
is
always
*NL*
plenty
of
room
to
avoid
capture
and
there
is
the
night
when
nothing
can
*NL*
be
seen
,
as
the
military
scientists
might
convince
themselves
by
the
*NL*
example
of
Krasnoe
and
of
the
Berezina
.
It
is
only
possible
to
capture
*NL*
prisoners
if
they
agree
to
be
captured
,
just
as
it
is
only
possible
to
*NL*
catch
a
swallow
if
it
settles
on
one
's
hand
.
Men
can
only
be
taken
*NL*
prisoners
if
they
surrender
according
to
the
rules
of
strategy
and
*NL*
tactics
,
as
the
Germans
did
.
But
the
French
troops
quite
rightly
did
not
*NL*
consider
that
this
suited
them
,
since
death
by
hunger
and
cold
awaited
*NL*
them
in
flight
or
captivity
alike
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fourthly
and
chiefly
it
was
impossible
,
because
never
since
the
world
*NL*
began
has
a
war
been
fought
under
such
conditions
as
those
that
obtained
*NL*
in
1812
,
and
the
Russian
army
in
its
pursuit
of
the
French
strained
its
*NL*
strength
to
the
utmost
and
could
not
have
done
more
without
destroying
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
movement
of
the
Russian
army
from
Tarutino
to
Krasnoe
it
lost
*NL*
fifty
thousand
sick
or
stragglers
,
that
is
a
number
equal
to
the
*NL*
population
of
a
large
provincial
town
.
Half
the
men
fell
out
of
the
army
*NL*
without
a
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
is
of
this
period
of
the
campaign
--
when
the
army
lacked
boots
and
*NL*
sheepskin
coats
,
was
short
of
provisions
and
without
vodka
,
and
was
*NL*
camping
out
at
night
for
months
in
the
snow
with
fifteen
degrees
of
*NL*
frost
,
when
there
were
only
seven
or
eight
hours
of
daylight
and
the
*NL*
rest
was
night
in
which
the
influence
of
discipline
can
not
be
*NL*
maintained
,
when
men
were
taken
into
that
region
of
death
where
*NL*
discipline
fails
,
not
for
a
few
hours
only
as
in
a
battle
,
but
for
*NL*
months
,
where
they
were
every
moment
fighting
death
from
hunger
and
*NL*
cold
,
when
half
the
army
perished
in
a
single
month
--
it
is
of
this
*NL*
period
of
the
campaign
that
the
historians
tell
us
how
Miloradovich
*NL*
should
have
made
a
flank
march
to
such
and
such
a
place
,
Tormasov
to
*NL*
another
place
,
and
Chichagov
should
have
crossed
-LRB-
more
than
knee-deep
in
*NL*
snow
-RRB-
to
somewhere
else
,
and
how
so-and-so
``
routed
''
and
``
cut
off
''
the
*NL*
French
and
so
on
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russians
,
half
of
whom
died
,
did
all
that
could
and
should
have
been
*NL*
done
to
attain
an
end
worthy
of
the
nation
,
and
they
are
not
to
blame
*NL*
because
other
Russians
,
sitting
in
warm
rooms
,
proposed
that
they
should
*NL*
do
what
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
strange
contradiction
now
difficult
to
understand
between
the
*NL*
facts
and
the
historical
accounts
only
arises
because
the
historians
*NL*
dealing
with
the
matter
have
written
the
history
of
the
beautiful
words
*NL*
and
sentiments
of
various
generals
,
and
not
the
history
of
the
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
them
the
words
of
Miloradovich
seem
very
interesting
,
and
so
do
their
*NL*
surmises
and
the
rewards
this
or
that
general
received
;
but
the
question
*NL*
of
those
fifty
thousand
men
who
were
left
in
hospitals
and
in
graves
*NL*
does
not
even
interest
them
,
for
it
does
not
come
within
the
range
of
*NL*
their
investigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
one
need
only
discard
the
study
of
the
reports
and
general
plans
and
*NL*
consider
the
movement
of
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
who
took
a
*NL*
direct
part
in
the
events
,
and
all
the
questions
that
seemed
insoluble
*NL*
easily
and
simply
receive
an
immediate
and
certain
solution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aim
of
cutting
off
Napoleon
and
his
army
never
existed
except
in
the
*NL*
imaginations
of
a
dozen
people
.
It
could
not
exist
because
it
was
*NL*
senseless
and
unattainable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
had
a
single
aim
:
to
free
their
land
from
invasion
.
That
aim
*NL*
was
attained
in
the
first
place
of
itself
,
as
the
French
ran
away
,
and
*NL*
so
it
was
only
necessary
not
to
stop
their
flight
.
Secondly
it
was
*NL*
attained
by
the
guerrilla
warfare
which
was
destroying
the
French
,
and
*NL*
thirdly
by
the
fact
that
a
large
Russian
army
was
following
the
French
,
*NL*
ready
to
use
its
strength
in
case
their
movement
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
army
had
to
act
like
a
whip
to
a
running
animal
.
And
the
*NL*
experienced
driver
knew
it
was
better
to
hold
the
whip
raised
as
a
*NL*
menace
than
to
strike
the
running
animal
on
the
head
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
When
seeing
a
dying
animal
a
man
feels
a
sense
of
horror
:
substance
*NL*
similar
to
his
own
is
perishing
before
his
eyes
.
But
when
it
is
a
*NL*
beloved
and
intimate
human
being
that
is
dying
,
besides
this
horror
at
*NL*
the
extinction
of
life
there
is
a
severance
,
a
spiritual
wound
,
which
*NL*
like
a
physical
wound
is
sometimes
fatal
and
sometimes
heals
,
but
always
*NL*
aches
and
shrinks
at
any
external
irritating
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Prince
Andrew
's
death
Natasha
and
Princess
Mary
alike
felt
this
.
*NL*
Drooping
in
spirit
and
closing
their
eyes
before
the
menacing
cloud
of
*NL*
death
that
overhung
them
,
they
dared
not
look
life
in
the
face
.
They
*NL*
carefully
guarded
their
open
wounds
from
any
rough
and
painful
contact
.
*NL*
Everything
:
a
carriage
passing
rapidly
in
the
street
,
a
summons
to
*NL*
dinner
,
the
maid
's
inquiry
what
dress
to
prepare
,
or
worse
still
any
*NL*
word
of
insincere
or
feeble
sympathy
,
seemed
an
insult
,
painfully
*NL*
irritated
the
wound
,
interrupting
that
necessary
quiet
in
which
they
*NL*
both
tried
to
listen
to
the
stern
and
dreadful
choir
that
still
*NL*
resounded
in
their
imagination
,
and
hindered
their
gazing
into
those
*NL*
mysterious
limitless
vistas
that
for
an
instant
had
opened
out
before
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
alone
together
were
they
free
from
such
outrage
and
pain
.
They
*NL*
spoke
little
even
to
one
another
,
and
when
they
did
it
was
of
very
*NL*
unimportant
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
avoided
any
allusion
to
the
future
.
To
admit
the
possibility
of
a
*NL*
future
seemed
to
them
to
insult
his
memory
.
Still
more
carefully
did
*NL*
they
avoid
anything
relating
to
him
who
was
dead
.
It
seemed
to
them
that
*NL*
what
they
had
lived
through
and
experienced
could
not
be
expressed
in
*NL*
words
,
and
that
any
reference
to
the
details
of
his
life
infringed
the
*NL*
majesty
and
sacredness
of
the
mystery
that
had
been
accomplished
before
*NL*
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continued
abstention
from
speech
,
and
constant
avoidance
of
everything
*NL*
that
might
lead
up
to
the
subject
--
this
halting
on
all
sides
at
the
*NL*
boundary
of
what
they
might
not
mention
--
brought
before
their
minds
with
*NL*
still
greater
purity
and
clearness
what
they
were
both
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
pure
and
complete
sorrow
is
as
impossible
as
pure
and
complete
joy
.
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
in
her
position
as
absolute
and
independent
arbiter
of
*NL*
her
own
fate
and
guardian
and
instructor
of
her
nephew
,
was
the
first
to
*NL*
be
called
back
to
life
from
that
realm
of
sorrow
in
which
she
had
dwelt
*NL*
for
the
first
fortnight
.
She
received
letters
from
her
relations
to
*NL*
which
she
had
to
reply
;
the
room
in
which
little
Nicholas
had
been
put
*NL*
was
damp
and
he
began
to
cough
;
Alpatych
came
to
Yaroslavl
with
reports
*NL*
on
the
state
of
their
affairs
and
with
advice
and
suggestions
that
they
*NL*
should
return
to
Moscow
to
the
house
on
the
Vozdvizhenka
Street
,
which
*NL*
had
remained
uninjured
and
needed
only
slight
repairs
.
Life
did
not
*NL*
stand
still
and
it
was
necessary
to
live
.
Hard
as
it
was
for
Princess
*NL*
Mary
to
emerge
from
the
realm
of
secluded
contemplation
in
which
she
had
*NL*
lived
till
then
,
and
sorry
and
almost
ashamed
as
she
felt
to
leave
*NL*
Natasha
alone
,
yet
the
cares
of
life
demanded
her
attention
and
she
*NL*
involuntarily
yielded
to
them
.
She
went
through
the
accounts
with
*NL*
Alpatych
,
conferred
with
Dessalles
about
her
nephew
,
and
gave
orders
and
*NL*
made
preparations
for
the
journey
to
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
remained
alone
and
,
from
the
time
Princess
Mary
began
making
*NL*
preparations
for
departure
,
held
aloof
from
her
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
asked
the
countess
to
let
Natasha
go
with
her
to
Moscow
,
*NL*
and
both
parents
gladly
accepted
this
offer
,
for
they
saw
their
daughter
*NL*
losing
strength
every
day
and
thought
that
a
change
of
scene
and
the
*NL*
advice
of
Moscow
doctors
would
be
good
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
anywhere
,
''
Natasha
replied
when
this
was
proposed
to
*NL*
her
.
``
Do
please
just
leave
me
alone
!
''
And
she
ran
out
of
the
room
,
with
*NL*
difficulty
refraining
from
tears
of
vexation
and
irritation
rather
than
*NL*
of
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
she
felt
herself
deserted
by
Princes
Mary
and
alone
in
her
grief
,
*NL*
Natasha
spent
most
of
the
time
in
her
room
by
herself
,
sitting
huddled
*NL*
up
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
,
tearing
and
twisting
*NL*
something
with
her
slender
nervous
fingers
and
gazing
intently
and
*NL*
fixedly
at
whatever
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
on
.
This
solitude
exhausted
*NL*
and
tormented
her
but
she
was
in
absolute
need
of
it
.
As
soon
as
anyone
*NL*
entered
she
got
up
quickly
,
changed
her
position
and
expression
,
and
*NL*
picked
up
a
book
or
some
sewing
,
evidently
waiting
impatiently
for
the
*NL*
intruder
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
all
the
time
as
if
she
might
at
any
moment
penetrate
that
on
*NL*
which
--
with
a
terrible
questioning
too
great
for
her
strength
--
her
*NL*
spiritual
gaze
was
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
toward
the
end
of
December
Natasha
,
pale
and
thin
,
dressed
in
a
*NL*
black
woolen
gown
,
her
plaited
hair
negligently
twisted
into
a
knot
,
was
*NL*
crouched
feet
and
all
in
the
corner
of
her
sofa
,
nervously
crumpling
and
*NL*
smoothing
out
the
end
of
her
sash
while
she
looked
at
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
he
had
gone
--
to
the
other
side
*NL*
of
life
.
And
that
other
side
of
life
,
of
which
she
had
never
before
*NL*
thought
and
which
had
formerly
seemed
to
her
so
far
away
and
improbable
,
*NL*
was
now
nearer
and
more
akin
and
more
comprehensible
than
this
side
of
*NL*
life
,
where
everything
was
either
emptiness
and
desolation
or
suffering
*NL*
and
indignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gazing
where
she
knew
him
to
be
;
but
she
could
not
imagine
him
*NL*
otherwise
than
as
he
had
been
here
.
She
now
saw
him
again
as
he
had
been
*NL*
at
Mytishchi
,
at
Troitsa
,
and
at
Yaroslavl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
his
face
,
heard
his
voice
,
repeated
his
words
and
her
own
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
devised
other
words
they
might
have
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
is
lying
back
in
an
armchair
in
his
velvet
cloak
,
leaning
his
*NL*
head
on
his
thin
pale
hand
.
His
chest
is
dreadfully
hollow
and
his
*NL*
shoulders
raised
.
His
lips
are
firmly
closed
,
his
eyes
glitter
,
and
a
*NL*
wrinkle
comes
and
goes
on
his
pale
forehead
.
One
of
his
legs
twitches
*NL*
just
perceptibly
,
but
rapidly
.
Natasha
knows
that
he
is
struggling
with
*NL*
terrible
pain
.
``
What
is
that
pain
like
?
Why
does
he
have
that
pain
?
What
*NL*
does
he
feel
?
How
does
it
hurt
him
?
''
thought
Natasha
.
He
noticed
her
*NL*
watching
him
,
raised
his
eyes
,
and
began
to
speak
seriously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
would
be
terrible
,
''
said
he
:
``
to
bind
oneself
forever
to
a
*NL*
suffering
man
.
It
would
be
continual
torture
.
''
And
he
looked
searchingly
*NL*
at
her
.
Natasha
as
usual
answered
before
she
had
time
to
think
what
she
*NL*
would
say
.
She
said
:
``
This
ca
n't
go
on
--
it
wo
n't
.
You
will
get
well
--
*NL*
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
saw
him
from
the
commencement
of
that
scene
and
relived
what
she
*NL*
had
then
felt
.
She
recalled
his
long
sad
and
severe
look
at
those
words
*NL*
and
understood
the
meaning
of
the
rebuke
and
despair
in
that
protracted
*NL*
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agreed
,
''
Natasha
now
said
to
herself
,
``
that
it
would
be
dreadful
if
*NL*
he
always
continued
to
suffer
.
I
said
it
then
only
because
it
would
have
*NL*
been
dreadful
for
him
,
but
he
understood
it
differently
.
He
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
dreadful
for
me
.
He
then
still
wished
to
live
and
feared
death
.
*NL*
And
I
said
it
so
awkwardly
and
stupidly
!
I
did
not
say
what
I
meant
.
I
*NL*
thought
quite
differently
.
Had
I
said
what
I
thought
,
I
should
have
*NL*
said
:
even
if
he
had
to
go
on
dying
,
to
die
continually
before
my
eyes
,
*NL*
I
should
have
been
happy
compared
with
what
I
am
now
.
Now
there
is
*NL*
nothing
...
nobody
.
Did
he
know
that
?
No
,
he
did
not
and
never
will
know
*NL*
it
.
And
now
it
will
never
,
never
be
possible
to
put
it
right
.
''
And
now
*NL*
he
again
seemed
to
be
saying
the
same
words
to
her
,
only
in
her
*NL*
imagination
Natasha
this
time
gave
him
a
different
answer
.
She
stopped
*NL*
him
and
said
:
``
Terrible
for
you
,
but
not
for
me
!
You
know
that
for
me
*NL*
there
is
nothing
in
life
but
you
,
and
to
suffer
with
you
is
the
greatest
*NL*
happiness
for
me
,
''
and
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
as
he
had
pressed
*NL*
it
that
terrible
evening
four
days
before
his
death
.
And
in
her
*NL*
imagination
she
said
other
tender
and
loving
words
which
she
might
have
*NL*
said
then
but
only
spoke
now
:
``
I
love
thee
!
...
thee
!
I
love
,
love
...
''
*NL*
she
said
,
convulsively
pressing
her
hands
and
setting
her
teeth
with
a
*NL*
desperate
effort
...
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
overcome
by
sweet
sorrow
and
tears
were
already
rising
in
her
*NL*
eyes
;
then
she
suddenly
asked
herself
to
whom
she
was
saying
this
.
Again
*NL*
everything
was
shrouded
in
hard
,
dry
perplexity
,
and
again
with
a
*NL*
strained
frown
she
peered
toward
the
world
where
he
was
.
And
now
,
now
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
she
was
penetrating
the
mystery
...
But
at
the
instant
*NL*
when
it
seemed
that
the
incomprehensible
was
revealing
itself
to
her
a
*NL*
loud
rattle
of
the
door
handle
struck
painfully
on
her
ears
.
Dunyasha
,
*NL*
her
maid
,
entered
the
room
quickly
and
abruptly
with
a
frightened
look
*NL*
on
her
face
and
showing
no
concern
for
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
your
Papa
at
once
,
please
!
''
said
she
with
a
strange
,
excited
*NL*
look
.
``
A
misfortune
...
about
Peter
Ilynich
...
a
letter
,
''
she
finished
*NL*
with
a
sob
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
a
feeling
of
aloofness
from
everybody
Natasha
was
feeling
a
*NL*
special
estrangement
from
the
members
of
her
own
family
.
All
of
them
--
*NL*
her
father
,
mother
,
and
Sonya
--
were
so
near
to
her
,
so
familiar
,
so
*NL*
commonplace
,
that
all
their
words
and
feelings
seemed
an
insult
to
the
*NL*
world
in
which
she
had
been
living
of
late
,
and
she
felt
not
merely
*NL*
indifferent
to
them
but
regarded
them
with
hostility
.
She
heard
*NL*
Dunyasha
's
words
about
Peter
Ilynich
and
a
misfortune
,
but
did
not
grasp
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
misfortune
?
What
misfortune
can
happen
to
them
?
They
just
live
*NL*
their
own
old
,
quiet
,
and
commonplace
life
,
''
thought
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
entered
the
ballroom
her
father
was
hurriedly
coming
out
of
her
*NL*
mother
's
room
.
His
face
was
puckered
up
and
wet
with
tears
.
He
had
*NL*
evidently
run
out
of
that
room
to
give
vent
to
the
sobs
that
were
*NL*
choking
him
.
When
he
saw
Natasha
he
waved
his
arms
despairingly
and
*NL*
burst
into
convulsively
painful
sobs
that
distorted
his
soft
round
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pe
...
Petya
...
Go
,
go
,
she
...
is
calling
...
''
and
weeping
like
a
child
*NL*
and
quickly
shuffling
on
his
feeble
legs
to
a
chair
,
he
almost
fell
into
*NL*
it
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
an
electric
shock
seemed
to
run
through
Natasha
's
whole
being
.
*NL*
Terrible
anguish
struck
her
heart
,
she
felt
a
dreadful
ache
as
if
*NL*
something
was
being
torn
inside
her
and
she
were
dying
.
But
the
pain
was
*NL*
immediately
followed
by
a
feeling
of
release
from
the
oppressive
*NL*
constraint
that
had
prevented
her
taking
part
in
life
.
The
sight
of
her
*NL*
father
,
the
terribly
wild
cries
of
her
mother
that
she
heard
through
the
*NL*
door
,
made
her
immediately
forget
herself
and
her
own
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
to
her
father
,
but
he
feebly
waved
his
arm
,
pointing
to
her
*NL*
mother
's
door
.
Princess
Mary
,
pale
and
with
quivering
chin
,
came
out
*NL*
from
that
room
and
taking
Natasha
by
the
arm
said
something
to
her
.
*NL*
Natasha
neither
saw
nor
heard
her
.
She
went
in
with
rapid
steps
,
pausing
*NL*
at
the
door
for
an
instant
as
if
struggling
with
herself
,
and
then
ran
*NL*
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
lying
in
an
armchair
in
a
strange
and
awkward
position
,
*NL*
stretching
out
and
beating
her
head
against
the
wall
.
Sonya
and
the
*NL*
maids
were
holding
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
!
Natasha
!
...
''
cried
the
countess
.
``
It
's
not
true
...
it
's
not
*NL*
true
...
He
's
lying
...
Natasha
!
''
she
shrieked
,
pushing
those
around
her
*NL*
away
.
``
Go
away
,
all
of
you
;
it
's
not
true
!
Killed
!
...
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
...
*NL*
It
's
not
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
put
one
knee
on
the
armchair
,
stooped
over
her
mother
,
embraced
*NL*
her
,
and
with
unexpected
strength
raised
her
,
turned
her
face
toward
*NL*
herself
,
and
clung
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mummy
!
...
darling
!
...
I
am
here
,
my
dearest
Mummy
,
''
she
kept
on
*NL*
whispering
,
not
pausing
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
let
go
of
her
mother
but
struggled
tenderly
with
her
,
*NL*
demanded
a
pillow
and
hot
water
,
and
unfastened
and
tore
open
her
*NL*
mother
's
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
darling
...
Mummy
,
my
precious
!
...
''
she
whispered
*NL*
incessantly
,
kissing
her
head
,
her
hands
,
her
face
,
and
feeling
her
own
*NL*
irrepressible
and
streaming
tears
tickling
her
nose
and
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
pressed
her
daughter
's
hand
,
closed
her
eyes
,
and
became
*NL*
quiet
for
a
moment
.
Suddenly
she
sat
up
with
unaccustomed
swiftness
,
*NL*
glanced
vacantly
around
her
,
and
seeing
Natasha
began
to
press
her
*NL*
daughter
's
head
with
all
her
strength
.
Then
she
turned
toward
her
*NL*
daughter
's
face
which
was
wincing
with
pain
and
gazed
long
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
you
love
me
?
''
she
said
in
a
soft
trustful
whisper
.
``
Natasha
,
*NL*
you
would
not
deceive
me
?
You
'll
tell
me
the
whole
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
and
in
her
look
there
was
*NL*
nothing
but
love
and
an
entreaty
for
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
Mummy
!
''
she
repeated
,
straining
all
the
power
of
her
love
to
*NL*
find
some
way
of
taking
on
herself
the
excess
of
grief
that
crushed
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
in
a
futile
struggle
with
reality
her
mother
,
refusing
to
*NL*
believe
that
she
could
live
when
her
beloved
boy
was
killed
in
the
bloom
*NL*
of
life
,
escaped
from
reality
into
a
world
of
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
remember
how
that
day
passed
nor
that
night
,
nor
the
*NL*
next
day
and
night
.
She
did
not
sleep
and
did
not
leave
her
mother
.
Her
*NL*
persevering
and
patient
love
seemed
completely
to
surround
the
countess
*NL*
every
moment
,
not
explaining
or
consoling
,
but
recalling
her
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
third
night
the
countess
kept
very
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
and
Natasha
rested
her
head
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
,
*NL*
but
opened
them
again
on
hearing
the
bedstead
creak
.
The
countess
was
*NL*
sitting
up
in
bed
and
speaking
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
have
come
.
You
are
tired
.
Wo
n't
you
have
some
tea
?
''
*NL*
Natasha
went
up
to
her
.
``
You
have
improved
in
looks
and
grown
more
*NL*
manly
,
''
continued
the
countess
,
taking
her
daughter
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
What
are
you
saying
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
he
is
no
more
,
no
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
embracing
her
daughter
,
the
countess
began
to
weep
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
postponed
her
departure
.
Sonya
and
the
count
tried
to
*NL*
replace
Natasha
but
could
not
.
They
saw
that
she
alone
was
able
to
*NL*
restrain
her
mother
from
unreasoning
despair
.
For
three
weeks
Natasha
*NL*
remained
constantly
at
her
mother
's
side
,
sleeping
on
a
lounge
chair
in
*NL*
her
room
,
making
her
eat
and
drink
,
and
talking
to
her
incessantly
*NL*
because
the
mere
sound
of
her
tender
,
caressing
tones
soothed
her
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
's
wounded
spirit
could
not
heal
.
Petya
's
death
had
torn
from
*NL*
her
half
her
life
.
When
the
news
of
Petya
's
death
had
come
she
had
been
*NL*
a
fresh
and
vigorous
woman
of
fifty
,
but
a
month
later
she
left
her
room
*NL*
a
listless
old
woman
taking
no
interest
in
life
.
But
the
same
blow
that
*NL*
almost
killed
the
countess
,
this
second
blow
,
restored
Natasha
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
spiritual
wound
produced
by
a
rending
of
the
spiritual
body
is
like
a
*NL*
physical
wound
and
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
just
as
a
deep
wound
may
*NL*
heal
and
its
edges
join
,
physical
and
spiritual
wounds
alike
can
yet
*NL*
heal
completely
only
as
the
result
of
a
vital
force
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
wound
healed
in
that
way
.
She
thought
her
life
was
ended
,
but
*NL*
her
love
for
her
mother
unexpectedly
showed
her
that
the
essence
of
*NL*
life
--
love
--
was
still
active
within
her
.
Love
awoke
and
so
did
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
's
last
days
had
bound
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
together
;
*NL*
this
new
sorrow
brought
them
still
closer
to
one
another
.
Princess
Mary
*NL*
put
off
her
departure
,
and
for
three
weeks
looked
after
Natasha
as
if
*NL*
she
had
been
a
sick
child
.
The
last
weeks
passed
in
her
mother
's
bedroom
*NL*
had
strained
Natasha
's
physical
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
noticing
Natasha
shivering
with
fever
,
Princess
Mary
took
*NL*
her
to
her
own
room
and
made
her
lie
down
on
the
bed
.
Natasha
lay
down
,
*NL*
but
when
Princess
Mary
had
drawn
the
blinds
and
was
going
away
she
*NL*
called
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
sleep
,
Mary
,
sit
by
me
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
tired
--
try
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
Why
did
you
bring
me
away
?
She
will
be
asking
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
much
better
.
She
spoke
so
well
today
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
lay
on
the
bed
and
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
room
scanned
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
like
him
?
''
thought
Natasha
.
``
Yes
,
like
and
yet
not
like
.
But
she
*NL*
is
quite
original
,
strange
,
new
,
and
unknown
.
And
she
loves
me
.
What
is
*NL*
in
her
heart
?
All
that
is
good
.
But
how
?
What
is
her
mind
like
?
What
*NL*
does
she
think
about
me
?
Yes
,
she
is
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
''
she
said
timidly
,
drawing
Princess
Mary
's
hand
to
herself
,
*NL*
``
Mary
,
you
must
n't
think
me
wicked
.
No
?
Mary
darling
,
how
I
love
you
!
*NL*
Let
us
be
quite
,
quite
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Natasha
,
embracing
her
,
began
kissing
her
face
and
hands
,
making
*NL*
Princess
Mary
feel
shy
but
happy
by
this
demonstration
of
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
a
tender
and
passionate
friendship
such
as
exists
only
*NL*
between
women
was
established
between
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
.
They
*NL*
were
continually
kissing
and
saying
tender
things
to
one
another
and
*NL*
spent
most
of
their
time
together
.
When
one
went
out
the
other
became
*NL*
restless
and
hastened
to
rejoin
her
.
Together
they
felt
more
in
harmony
*NL*
with
one
another
than
either
of
them
felt
with
herself
when
alone
.
A
*NL*
feeling
stronger
than
friendship
sprang
up
between
them
;
an
exclusive
*NL*
feeling
of
life
being
possible
only
in
each
other
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
they
were
silent
for
hours
;
sometimes
after
they
were
already
*NL*
in
bed
they
would
begin
talking
and
go
on
till
morning
.
They
spoke
most
*NL*
of
what
was
long
past
.
Princess
Mary
spoke
of
her
childhood
,
of
her
*NL*
mother
,
her
father
,
and
her
daydreams
;
and
Natasha
,
who
with
a
passive
*NL*
lack
of
understanding
had
formerly
turned
away
from
that
life
of
*NL*
devotion
,
submission
,
and
the
poetry
of
Christian
self-sacrifice
,
now
*NL*
feeling
herself
bound
to
Princess
Mary
by
affection
,
learned
to
love
her
*NL*
past
too
and
to
understand
a
side
of
life
previously
incomprehensible
to
*NL*
her
.
She
did
not
think
of
applying
submission
and
self-abnegation
to
her
*NL*
own
life
,
for
she
was
accustomed
to
seek
other
joys
,
but
she
understood
*NL*
and
loved
in
another
those
previously
incomprehensible
virtues
.
For
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
listening
to
Natasha
's
tales
of
childhood
and
early
*NL*
youth
,
there
also
opened
out
a
new
and
hitherto
uncomprehended
side
of
*NL*
life
:
belief
in
life
and
its
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
before
,
they
never
mentioned
him
so
as
not
to
lower
-LRB-
as
they
*NL*
thought
-RRB-
their
exalted
feelings
by
words
;
but
this
silence
about
him
had
*NL*
the
effect
of
making
them
gradually
begin
to
forget
him
without
being
*NL*
conscious
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
had
grown
thin
and
pale
and
physically
so
weak
that
they
all
*NL*
talked
about
her
health
,
and
this
pleased
her
.
But
sometimes
she
was
*NL*
suddenly
overcome
by
fear
not
only
of
death
but
of
sickness
,
weakness
,
*NL*
and
loss
of
good
looks
,
and
involuntarily
she
examined
her
bare
arm
*NL*
carefully
,
surprised
at
its
thinness
,
and
in
the
morning
noticed
her
*NL*
drawn
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
her
,
piteous
face
in
her
glass
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
that
things
must
be
so
,
and
yet
it
was
dreadfully
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
went
quickly
upstairs
and
found
herself
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
Unconsciously
she
immediately
invented
a
reason
for
going
down
,
and
*NL*
then
,
testing
her
strength
,
ran
upstairs
again
,
observing
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
when
she
called
Dunyasha
her
voice
trembled
,
so
she
called
*NL*
again
--
though
she
could
hear
Dunyasha
coming
--
called
her
in
the
deep
*NL*
chest
tones
in
which
she
had
been
wont
to
sing
,
and
listened
attentively
*NL*
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
know
and
would
not
have
believed
it
,
but
beneath
the
layer
*NL*
of
slime
that
covered
her
soul
and
seemed
to
her
impenetrable
,
delicate
*NL*
young
shoots
of
grass
were
already
sprouting
,
which
taking
root
would
so
*NL*
cover
with
their
living
verdure
the
grief
that
weighed
her
down
that
it
*NL*
would
soon
no
longer
be
seen
or
noticed
.
The
wound
had
begun
to
heal
*NL*
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
January
Princess
Mary
left
for
Moscow
,
and
the
count
*NL*
insisted
on
Natasha
's
going
with
her
to
consult
the
doctors
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
encounter
at
Vyazma
,
where
Kutuzov
had
been
unable
to
hold
*NL*
back
his
troops
in
their
anxiety
to
overwhelm
and
cut
off
the
enemy
and
*NL*
so
on
,
the
farther
movement
of
the
fleeing
French
,
and
of
the
Russians
*NL*
who
pursued
them
,
continued
as
far
as
Krasnoe
without
a
battle
.
The
*NL*
flight
was
so
rapid
that
the
Russian
army
pursuing
the
French
could
not
*NL*
keep
up
with
them
;
cavalry
and
artillery
horses
broke
down
,
and
the
*NL*
information
received
of
the
movements
of
the
French
was
never
reliable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
in
the
Russian
army
were
so
worn
out
by
this
continuous
marching
*NL*
at
the
rate
of
twenty-seven
miles
a
day
that
they
could
not
go
any
*NL*
faster
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
realize
the
degree
of
exhaustion
of
the
Russian
army
it
is
only
*NL*
necessary
to
grasp
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
fact
that
,
while
not
*NL*
losing
more
than
five
thousand
killed
and
wounded
after
Tarutino
and
*NL*
less
than
a
hundred
prisoners
,
the
Russian
army
which
left
that
place
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
strong
reached
Krasnoe
with
only
fifty
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rapidity
of
the
Russian
pursuit
was
just
as
destructive
to
our
army
*NL*
as
the
flight
of
the
French
was
to
theirs
.
The
only
difference
was
that
*NL*
the
Russian
army
moved
voluntarily
,
with
no
such
threat
of
destruction
*NL*
as
hung
over
the
French
,
and
that
the
sick
Frenchmen
were
left
behind
in
*NL*
enemy
hands
while
the
sick
Russians
left
behind
were
among
their
own
*NL*
people
.
The
chief
cause
of
the
wastage
of
Napoleon
's
army
was
the
*NL*
rapidity
of
its
movement
,
and
a
convincing
proof
of
this
is
the
*NL*
corresponding
decrease
of
the
Russian
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
as
far
as
was
in
his
power
,
instead
of
trying
to
check
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
French
as
was
desired
in
Petersburg
and
by
the
Russian
*NL*
army
generals
,
directed
his
whole
activity
here
,
as
he
had
done
at
*NL*
Tarutino
and
Vyazma
,
to
hastening
it
on
while
easing
the
movement
of
our
*NL*
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
this
,
since
the
exhaustion
and
enormous
diminution
of
the
*NL*
army
caused
by
the
rapidity
of
the
advance
had
become
evident
,
another
*NL*
reason
for
slackening
the
pace
and
delaying
presented
itself
to
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
The
aim
of
the
Russian
army
was
to
pursue
the
French
.
The
road
the
*NL*
French
would
take
was
unknown
,
and
so
the
closer
our
troops
trod
on
*NL*
their
heels
the
greater
distance
they
had
to
cover
.
Only
by
following
at
*NL*
some
distance
could
one
cut
across
the
zigzag
path
of
the
French
.
All
*NL*
the
artful
maneuvers
suggested
by
our
generals
meant
fresh
movements
of
*NL*
the
army
and
a
lengthening
of
its
marches
,
whereas
the
only
reasonable
*NL*
aim
was
to
shorten
those
marches
.
To
that
end
Kutuzov
's
activity
was
*NL*
directed
during
the
whole
campaign
from
Moscow
to
Vilna
--
not
casually
or
*NL*
intermittently
but
so
consistently
that
he
never
once
deviated
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
felt
and
knew
--
not
by
reasoning
or
science
but
with
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
Russian
being
--
what
every
Russian
soldier
felt
:
that
the
French
were
*NL*
beaten
,
that
the
enemy
was
flying
and
must
be
driven
out
;
but
at
the
*NL*
same
time
he
like
the
soldiers
realized
all
the
hardship
of
this
march
,
*NL*
the
rapidity
of
which
was
unparalleled
for
such
a
time
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
the
generals
,
especially
the
foreign
ones
in
the
Russian
army
,
*NL*
who
wished
to
distinguish
themselves
,
to
astonish
somebody
,
and
for
some
*NL*
reason
to
capture
a
king
or
a
duke
--
it
seemed
that
now
--
when
any
battle
*NL*
must
be
horrible
and
senseless
--
was
the
very
time
to
fight
and
conquer
*NL*
somebody
.
Kutuzov
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
one
after
another
*NL*
they
presented
projects
of
maneuvers
to
be
made
with
those
soldiers
--
*NL*
ill-shod
,
insufficiently
clad
,
and
half
starved
--
who
within
a
month
and
*NL*
without
fighting
a
battle
had
dwindled
to
half
their
number
,
and
who
at
*NL*
the
best
if
the
flight
continued
would
have
to
go
a
greater
distance
*NL*
than
they
had
already
traversed
,
before
they
reached
the
frontier
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
longing
to
distinguish
themselves
,
to
maneuver
,
to
overthrow
,
and
*NL*
to
cut
off
showed
itself
particularly
whenever
the
Russians
stumbled
on
*NL*
the
French
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
at
Krasnoe
,
where
they
expected
to
find
one
of
the
three
*NL*
French
columns
and
stumbled
instead
on
Napoleon
himself
with
sixteen
*NL*
thousand
men
.
Despite
all
Kutuzov
's
efforts
to
avoid
that
ruinous
*NL*
encounter
and
to
preserve
his
troops
,
the
massacre
of
the
broken
mob
of
*NL*
French
soldiers
by
worn-out
Russians
continued
at
Krasnoe
for
three
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toll
wrote
a
disposition
:
``
The
first
column
will
march
to
so
and
so
,
''
*NL*
etc.
.
And
as
usual
nothing
happened
in
accord
with
the
disposition
.
*NL*
Prince
Eugene
of
Wurttemberg
fired
from
a
hill
over
the
French
crowds
*NL*
that
were
running
past
,
and
demanded
reinforcements
which
did
not
*NL*
arrive
.
The
French
,
avoiding
the
Russians
,
dispersed
and
hid
themselves
*NL*
in
the
forest
by
night
,
making
their
way
round
as
best
they
could
,
and
*NL*
continued
their
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miloradovich
,
who
said
he
did
not
want
to
know
anything
about
the
*NL*
commissariat
affairs
of
his
detachment
,
and
could
never
be
found
when
he
*NL*
was
wanted
--
that
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
*
as
he
styled
*NL*
himself
--
who
was
fond
of
parleys
with
the
French
,
sent
envoys
demanding
*NL*
their
surrender
,
wasted
time
,
and
did
not
do
what
he
was
ordered
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Knight
without
fear
and
without
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
that
column
,
lads
,
''
he
said
,
riding
up
to
the
troops
and
*NL*
pointing
out
the
French
to
the
cavalry
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
cavalry
,
with
spurs
and
sabers
urging
on
horses
that
could
*NL*
scarcely
move
,
trotted
with
much
effort
to
the
column
presented
to
them
-
*NL*
-
that
is
to
say
,
to
a
crowd
of
Frenchmen
stark
with
cold
,
frost-bitten
,
*NL*
and
starving
--
and
the
column
that
had
been
presented
to
them
threw
down
*NL*
its
arms
and
surrendered
as
it
had
long
been
anxious
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Krasnoe
they
took
twenty-six
thousand
prisoners
,
several
hundred
*NL*
cannon
,
and
a
stick
called
a
``
marshal
's
staff
,
''
and
disputed
as
to
who
*NL*
had
distinguished
himself
and
were
pleased
with
their
achievement
--
*NL*
though
they
much
regretted
not
having
taken
Napoleon
,
or
at
least
a
*NL*
marshal
or
a
hero
of
some
sort
,
and
reproached
one
another
and
*NL*
especially
Kutuzov
for
having
failed
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
,
carried
away
by
their
passions
,
were
but
blind
tools
of
the
*NL*
most
melancholy
law
of
necessity
,
but
considered
themselves
heroes
and
*NL*
imagined
that
they
were
accomplishing
a
most
noble
and
honorable
deed
.
*NL*
They
blamed
Kutuzov
and
said
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
*NL*
campaign
he
had
prevented
their
vanquishing
Napoleon
,
that
he
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
but
satisfying
his
passions
and
would
not
advance
from
the
Linen
*NL*
Factories
because
he
was
comfortable
there
,
that
at
Krasnoe
he
checked
*NL*
the
advance
because
on
learning
that
Napoleon
was
there
he
had
quite
*NL*
lost
his
head
,
and
that
it
was
probable
that
he
had
an
understanding
*NL*
with
Napoleon
and
had
been
bribed
by
him
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
did
his
contemporaries
,
carried
away
by
their
passions
,
talk
in
*NL*
this
way
,
but
posterity
and
history
have
acclaimed
Napoleon
as
grand
,
*NL*
while
Kutuzov
is
described
by
foreigners
as
a
crafty
,
dissolute
,
weak
*NL*
old
courtier
,
and
by
Russians
as
something
indefinite
--
a
sort
of
puppet
*NL*
useful
only
because
he
had
a
Russian
name
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
In
1812
and
1813
Kutuzov
was
openly
accused
of
blundering
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
was
dissatisfied
with
him
.
And
in
a
history
recently
written
by
order
of
*NL*
the
Highest
Authorities
it
is
said
that
Kutuzov
was
a
cunning
court
*NL*
liar
,
frightened
of
the
name
of
Napoleon
,
and
that
by
his
blunders
at
*NL*
Krasnoe
and
the
Berezina
he
deprived
the
Russian
army
of
the
glory
of
*NL*
complete
victory
over
the
French
.

History
of
the
year
1812
.
The
character
of
Kutuzov
and
reflections
on
*NL*
the
unsatisfactory
results
of
the
battles
at
Krasnoe
,
by
Bogdanovich
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
fate
not
of
great
men
-LRB-
grands
hommes
-RRB-
whom
the
Russian
mind
*NL*
does
not
acknowledge
,
but
of
those
rare
and
always
solitary
individuals
*NL*
who
,
discerning
the
will
of
Providence
,
submit
their
personal
will
to
*NL*
it
.
The
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
crowd
punish
such
men
for
discerning
*NL*
the
higher
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Russian
historians
,
strange
and
terrible
to
say
,
Napoleon
--
that
most
*NL*
insignificant
tool
of
history
who
never
anywhere
,
even
in
exile
,
showed
*NL*
human
dignity
--
Napoleon
is
the
object
of
adulation
and
enthusiasm
;
he
is
*NL*
grand
.
But
Kutuzov
--
the
man
who
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
*NL*
activity
in
1812
,
never
once
swerving
by
word
or
deed
from
Borodino
to
*NL*
Vilna
,
presented
an
example
exceptional
in
history
of
self-sacrifice
and
*NL*
a
present
consciousness
of
the
future
importance
of
what
was
happening
--
*NL*
Kutuzov
seems
to
them
something
indefinite
and
pitiful
,
and
when
*NL*
speaking
of
him
and
of
the
year
1812
they
always
seem
a
little
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
an
historical
character
whose
*NL*
activity
was
so
unswervingly
directed
to
a
single
aim
;
and
it
would
be
*NL*
difficult
to
imagine
any
aim
more
worthy
or
more
consonant
with
the
will
*NL*
of
the
whole
people
.
Still
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
find
an
*NL*
instance
in
history
of
the
aim
of
an
historical
personage
being
so
*NL*
completely
accomplished
as
that
to
which
all
Kutuzov
's
efforts
were
*NL*
directed
in
1812
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
never
talked
of
``
forty
centuries
looking
down
from
the
*NL*

''
of
the
sacrifices
he
offered
for
the
fatherland
,
or
of
what
*NL*
he
intended
to
accomplish
or
had
accomplished
;
in
general
he
said
*NL*
nothing
about
himself
,
adopted
no
pose
,
always
appeared
to
be
the
*NL*
simplest
and
most
ordinary
of
men
,
and
said
the
simplest
and
most
*NL*
ordinary
things
.
He
wrote
letters
to
his
daughters
and
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Stael
,
read
novels
,
liked
the
society
of
pretty
women
,
jested
with
*NL*
generals
,
officers
,
and
soldiers
,
and
never
contradicted
those
who
tried
*NL*
to
prove
anything
to
him
.
When
Count
Rostopchin
at
the
Yauza
bridge
*NL*
galloped
up
to
Kutuzov
with
personal
reproaches
for
having
caused
the
*NL*
destruction
of
Moscow
,
and
said
:
``
How
was
it
you
promised
not
to
abandon
*NL*
Moscow
without
a
battle
?
''
Kutuzov
replied
:
``
And
I
shall
not
abandon
*NL*
Moscow
without
a
battle
,
''
though
Moscow
was
then
already
abandoned
.
When
*NL*
Arakcheev
,
coming
to
him
from
the
Emperor
,
said
that
Ermolov
ought
to
be
*NL*
appointed
chief
of
the
artillery
,
Kutuzov
replied
:
``
Yes
,
I
was
just
*NL*
saying
so
myself
,
''
though
a
moment
before
he
had
said
quite
the
*NL*
contrary
.
What
did
it
matter
to
him
--
who
then
alone
amid
a
senseless
*NL*
crowd
understood
the
whole
tremendous
significance
of
what
was
*NL*
happening
--
what
did
it
matter
to
him
whether
Rostopchin
attributed
the
*NL*
calamities
of
Moscow
to
him
or
to
himself
?
Still
less
could
it
matter
to
*NL*
him
who
was
appointed
chief
of
the
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
merely
in
these
cases
but
continually
did
that
old
man
--
who
by
*NL*
experience
of
life
had
reached
the
conviction
that
thoughts
and
the
*NL*
words
serving
as
their
expression
are
not
what
move
people
--
use
quite
*NL*
meaningless
words
that
happened
to
enter
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
man
,
so
heedless
of
his
words
,
did
not
once
during
the
whole
*NL*
time
of
his
activity
utter
one
word
inconsistent
with
the
single
aim
*NL*
toward
which
he
moved
throughout
the
whole
war
.
Obviously
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
,
in
very
diverse
circumstances
,
he
repeatedly
expressed
his
real
*NL*
thoughts
with
the
bitter
conviction
that
he
would
not
be
understood
.
*NL*
Beginning
with
the
battle
of
Borodino
,
from
which
time
his
disagreement
*NL*
with
those
about
him
began
,
he
alone
said
that
the
battle
of
Borodino
*NL*
was
a
victory
,
and
repeated
this
both
verbally
and
in
his
dispatches
and
*NL*
reports
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
.
He
alone
said
that
the
loss
of
*NL*
Moscow
is
not
the
loss
of
Russia
.
In
reply
to
Lauriston
's
proposal
of
*NL*
peace
,
he
said
:
There
can
be
no
peace
,
for
such
is
the
people
's
will
.
He
*NL*
alone
during
the
retreat
of
the
French
said
that
all
our
maneuvers
are
*NL*
useless
,
everything
is
being
accomplished
of
itself
better
than
we
could
*NL*
desire
;
that
the
enemy
must
be
offered
``
a
golden
bridge
''
;
that
neither
*NL*
the
Tarutino
,
the
Vyazma
,
nor
the
Krasnoe
battles
were
necessary
;
that
*NL*
we
must
keep
some
force
to
reach
the
frontier
with
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
not
sacrifice
a
single
Russian
for
ten
Frenchmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
courtier
,
as
he
is
described
to
us
,
who
lies
to
Arakcheev
to
*NL*
please
the
Emperor
,
he
alone
--
incurring
thereby
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
displeasure
--
said
in
Vilna
that
to
carry
the
war
beyond
the
frontier
is
*NL*
useless
and
harmful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
do
words
alone
prove
that
only
he
understood
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
events
.
His
actions
--
without
the
smallest
deviation
--
were
all
directed
*NL*
to
one
and
the
same
threefold
end
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
to
brace
all
his
strength
for
*NL*
conflict
with
the
French
,
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
to
defeat
them
,
and
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
to
drive
them
out
*NL*
of
Russia
,
minimizing
as
far
as
possible
the
sufferings
of
our
people
*NL*
and
of
our
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
procrastinator
Kutuzov
,
whose
motto
was
``
Patience
and
Time
,
''
this
*NL*
enemy
of
decisive
action
,
gave
battle
at
Borodino
,
investing
the
*NL*
preparations
for
it
with
unparalleled
solemnity
.
This
Kutuzov
who
before
*NL*
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
began
said
that
it
would
be
lost
,
he
alone
,
in
*NL*
contradiction
to
everyone
else
,
declared
till
his
death
that
Borodino
*NL*
was
a
victory
,
despite
the
assurance
of
generals
that
the
battle
was
*NL*
lost
and
despite
the
fact
that
for
an
army
to
have
to
retire
after
*NL*
winning
a
battle
was
unprecedented
.
He
alone
during
the
whole
retreat
*NL*
insisted
that
battles
,
which
were
useless
then
,
should
not
be
fought
,
*NL*
and
that
a
new
war
should
not
be
begun
nor
the
frontiers
of
Russia
*NL*
crossed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
easy
now
to
understand
the
significance
of
these
events
--
if
only
*NL*
we
abstain
from
attributing
to
the
activity
of
the
mass
aims
that
*NL*
existed
only
in
the
heads
of
a
dozen
individuals
--
for
the
events
and
*NL*
results
now
lie
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
did
that
old
man
,
alone
,
in
opposition
to
the
general
opinion
,
*NL*
so
truly
discern
the
importance
of
the
people
's
view
of
the
events
that
*NL*
in
all
his
activity
he
was
never
once
untrue
to
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
source
of
that
extraordinary
power
of
penetrating
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
events
then
occuring
lay
in
the
national
feeling
which
he
possessed
in
*NL*
full
purity
and
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
possessed
this
feeling
caused
*NL*
the
people
in
so
strange
a
manner
,
contrary
to
the
Tsar
's
wish
,
to
*NL*
select
him
--
an
old
man
in
disfavor
--
to
be
their
representative
in
the
*NL*
national
war
.
And
only
that
feeling
placed
him
on
that
highest
human
*NL*
pedestal
from
which
he
,
the
commander-in-chief
,
devoted
all
his
powers
*NL*
not
to
slaying
and
destroying
men
but
to
saving
and
showing
pity
on
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
simple
,
modest
,
and
therefore
truly
great
,
figure
could
not
be
cast
*NL*
in
the
false
mold
of
a
European
hero
--
the
supposed
ruler
of
men
--
that
*NL*
history
has
invented
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
lackey
no
man
can
be
great
,
for
a
lackey
has
his
own
conception
of
*NL*
greatness
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
of
November
was
the
first
day
of
what
is
called
the
battle
of
*NL*
Krasnoe
.
Toward
evening
--
after
much
disputing
and
many
mistakes
made
by
*NL*
generals
who
did
not
go
to
their
proper
places
,
and
after
adjutants
had
*NL*
been
sent
about
with
counterorders
--
when
it
had
become
plain
that
the
*NL*
enemy
was
everywhere
in
flight
and
that
there
could
and
would
be
no
*NL*
battle
,
Kutuzov
left
Krasnoe
and
went
to
Dobroe
whither
his
headquarters
*NL*
had
that
day
been
transferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
clear
and
frosty
.
Kutuzov
rode
to
Dobroe
on
his
plump
little
*NL*
white
horse
,
followed
by
an
enormous
suite
of
discontented
generals
who
*NL*
whispered
among
themselves
behind
his
back
.
All
along
the
road
groups
of
*NL*
French
prisoners
captured
that
day
-LRB-
there
were
seven
thousand
of
them
-RRB-
*NL*
were
crowding
to
warm
themselves
at
campfires
.
Near
Dobroe
an
immense
*NL*
crowd
of
tattered
prisoners
,
buzzing
with
talk
and
wrapped
and
bandaged
*NL*
in
anything
they
had
been
able
to
get
hold
of
,
were
standing
in
the
road
*NL*
beside
a
long
row
of
unharnessed
French
guns
.
At
the
approach
of
the
*NL*
commander-in-chief
the
buzz
of
talk
ceased
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
*NL*
Kutuzov
who
,
wearing
a
white
cap
with
a
red
band
and
a
padded
overcoat
*NL*
that
bulged
on
his
round
shoulders
,
moved
slowly
along
the
road
on
his
*NL*
white
horse
.
One
of
the
generals
was
reporting
to
him
where
the
guns
and
*NL*
prisoners
had
been
captured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
seemed
preoccupied
and
did
not
listen
to
what
the
general
was
*NL*
saying
.
He
screwed
up
his
eyes
with
a
dissatisfied
look
as
he
gazed
*NL*
attentively
and
fixedly
at
these
prisoners
,
who
presented
a
specially
*NL*
wretched
appearance
.
Most
of
them
were
disfigured
by
frost-bitten
noses
*NL*
and
cheeks
,
and
nearly
all
had
red
,
swollen
and
festering
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
group
of
the
French
stood
close
to
the
road
,
and
two
of
them
,
one
of
*NL*
whom
had
his
face
covered
with
sores
,
were
tearing
a
piece
of
raw
flesh
*NL*
with
their
hands
.
There
was
something
horrible
and
bestial
in
the
*NL*
fleeting
glance
they
threw
at
the
riders
and
in
the
malevolent
*NL*
expression
with
which
,
after
a
glance
at
Kutuzov
,
the
soldier
with
the
*NL*
sores
immediately
turned
away
and
went
on
with
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
looked
long
and
intently
at
these
two
soldiers
.
He
puckered
his
*NL*
face
,
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
and
pensively
swayed
his
head
.
At
another
*NL*
spot
he
noticed
a
Russian
soldier
laughingly
patting
a
Frenchman
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
,
saying
something
to
him
in
a
friendly
manner
,
and
Kutuzov
with
*NL*
the
same
expression
on
his
face
again
swayed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
saying
?
''
he
asked
the
general
,
who
continuing
his
report
*NL*
directed
the
commander-in-chief
's
attention
to
some
standards
captured
*NL*
from
the
French
and
standing
in
front
of
the
Preobrazhensk
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
standards
!
''
said
Kutuzov
,
evidently
detaching
himself
with
*NL*
difficulty
from
the
thoughts
that
preoccupied
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
about
him
absently
.
Thousands
of
eyes
were
looking
at
him
from
*NL*
all
sides
awaiting
a
word
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
in
front
of
the
Preobrazhensk
regiment
,
sighed
deeply
,
and
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
.
One
of
his
suite
beckoned
to
the
soldiers
carrying
the
*NL*
standards
to
advance
and
surround
the
commander-in-chief
with
them
.
*NL*
Kutuzov
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
,
submitting
with
evident
*NL*
reluctance
to
the
duty
imposed
by
his
position
,
raised
his
head
and
*NL*
began
to
speak
.
A
throng
of
officers
surrounded
him
.
He
looked
*NL*
attentively
around
at
the
circle
of
officers
,
recognizing
several
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
all
!
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
soldiers
and
then
again
the
*NL*
officers
.
In
the
stillness
around
him
his
slowly
uttered
words
were
*NL*
distinctly
heard
.
``
I
thank
you
all
for
your
hard
and
faithful
service
.
*NL*
The
victory
is
complete
and
Russia
will
not
forget
you
!
Honor
to
you
*NL*
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
looked
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lower
its
head
,
lower
it
!
''
he
said
to
a
soldier
who
had
accidentally
*NL*
lowered
the
French
eagle
he
was
holding
before
the
Preobrazhensk
*NL*
standards
.
``
Lower
,
lower
,
that
's
it
.
Hurrah
lads
!
''
he
added
,
addressing
*NL*
the
men
with
a
rapid
movement
of
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hur-r-rah
!
''
roared
thousands
of
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
soldiers
were
shouting
Kutuzov
leaned
forward
in
his
saddle
*NL*
and
bowed
his
head
,
and
his
eye
lit
up
with
a
mild
and
apparently
ironic
*NL*
gleam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
brothers
...
''
said
he
when
the
shouts
had
ceased
...
and
all
at
*NL*
once
his
voice
and
the
expression
of
his
face
changed
.
It
was
no
longer
*NL*
the
commander-in-chief
speaking
but
an
ordinary
old
man
who
wanted
to
*NL*
tell
his
comrades
something
very
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stir
among
the
throng
of
officers
and
in
the
ranks
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
who
moved
that
they
might
hear
better
what
he
was
going
to
*NL*
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
brothers
,
I
know
it
's
hard
for
you
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
!
*NL*
Bear
up
;
it
wo
n't
be
for
long
now
!
We
'll
see
our
visitors
off
and
then
*NL*
we
'll
rest
.
The
Tsar
wo
n't
forget
your
service
.
It
is
hard
for
you
,
but
*NL*
still
you
are
at
home
while
they
--
you
see
what
they
have
come
to
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
pointing
to
the
prisoners
.
``
Worse
off
than
our
poorest
beggars
.
*NL*
While
they
were
strong
we
did
n't
spare
ourselves
,
but
now
we
may
even
*NL*
pity
them
.
They
are
human
beings
too
.
Is
n't
it
so
,
lads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
around
,
and
in
the
direct
,
respectful
,
wondering
gaze
fixed
*NL*
upon
him
he
read
sympathy
with
what
he
had
said
.
His
face
grew
brighter
*NL*
and
brighter
with
an
old
man
's
mild
smile
,
which
drew
the
corners
of
his
*NL*
lips
and
eyes
into
a
cluster
of
wrinkles
.
He
ceased
speaking
and
bowed
*NL*
his
head
as
if
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
who
asked
them
here
?
Serves
them
right
,
the
bloody
*NL*
bastards
!
''
he
cried
,
suddenly
lifting
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
flourishing
his
whip
he
rode
off
at
a
gallop
for
the
first
time
*NL*
during
the
whole
campaign
,
and
left
the
broken
ranks
of
the
soldiers
*NL*
laughing
joyfully
and
shouting
``
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
words
were
hardly
understood
by
the
troops
.
No
one
could
have
*NL*
repeated
the
field
marshal
's
address
,
begun
solemnly
and
then
changing
*NL*
into
an
old
man
's
simplehearted
talk
;
but
the
hearty
sincerity
of
that
*NL*
speech
,
the
feeling
of
majestic
triumph
combined
with
pity
for
the
foe
*NL*
and
consciousness
of
the
justice
of
our
cause
,
exactly
expressed
by
that
*NL*
old
man
's
good-natured
expletives
,
was
not
merely
understood
but
lay
in
*NL*
the
soul
of
every
soldier
and
found
expression
in
their
joyous
and
long
-
*NL*
sustained
shouts
.
Afterwards
when
one
of
the
generals
addressed
Kutuzov
*NL*
asking

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
troops
reached
their
night
's
halting
place
on
the
eighth
of
*NL*
November
,
the
last
day
of
the
Krasnoe
battles
,
it
was
already
growing
*NL*
dusk
.
All
day
it
had
been
calm
and
frosty
with
occasional
lightly
*NL*
falling
snow
and
toward
evening
it
began
to
clear
.
Through
the
falling
*NL*
snow
a
purple-black
and
starry
sky
showed
itself
and
the
frost
grew
*NL*
keener
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
infantry
regiment
which
had
left
Tarutino
three
thousand
strong
but
*NL*
now
numbered
only
nine
hundred
was
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
that
night
*NL*
at
its
halting
place
--
a
village
on
the
highroad
.
The
quartermasters
who
*NL*
met
the
regiment
announced
that
all
the
huts
were
full
of
sick
and
dead
*NL*
Frenchmen
,
cavalrymen
,
and
members
of
the
staff
.
There
was
only
one
hut
*NL*
available
for
the
regimental
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
rode
up
to
his
hut
.
The
regiment
passed
through
the
*NL*
village
and
stacked
its
arms
in
front
of
the
last
huts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
some
huge
many-limbed
animal
,
the
regiment
began
to
prepare
its
*NL*
lair
and
its
food
.
One
part
of
it
dispersed
and
waded
knee-deep
through
*NL*
the
snow
into
a
birch
forest
to
the
right
of
the
village
,
and
*NL*
immediately
the
sound
of
axes
and
swords
,
the
crashing
of
branches
,
and
*NL*
merry
voices
could
be
heard
from
there
.
Another
section
amid
the
*NL*
regimental
wagons
and
horses
which
were
standing
in
a
group
was
busy
*NL*
getting
out
caldrons
and
rye
biscuit
,
and
feeding
the
horses
.
A
third
*NL*
section
scattered
through
the
village
arranging
quarters
for
the
staff
*NL*
officers
,
carrying
out
the
French
corpses
that
were
in
the
huts
,
and
*NL*
dragging
away
boards
,
dry
wood
,
and
thatch
from
the
roofs
,
for
the
*NL*
campfires
,
or
wattle
fences
to
serve
for
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
fifteen
men
with
merry
shouts
were
shaking
down
the
high
wattle
*NL*
wall
of
a
shed
,
the
roof
of
which
had
already
been
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
all
together
--
shove
!
''
cried
the
voices
,
and
the
huge
surface
*NL*
of
the
wall
,
sprinkled
with
snow
and
creaking
with
frost
,
was
seen
*NL*
swaying
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
.
The
lower
stakes
cracked
more
and
*NL*
more
and
at
last
the
wall
fell
,
and
with
it
the
men
who
had
been
pushing
*NL*
it
.
Loud
,
coarse
laughter
and
joyous
shouts
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
catch
hold
in
twos
!
Hand
up
the
lever
!
That
's
it
...
Where
are
*NL*
you
shoving
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
all
together
!
But
wait
a
moment
,
boys
...
With
a
song
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
stood
silent
,
and
a
soft
,
pleasant
velvety
voice
began
to
sing
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
the
third
verse
as
the
last
note
died
away
,
twenty
voices
*NL*
roared
out
at
once
:
``
Oo-oo-oo-oo
!
That
's
it
.
All
together
!
Heave
away
,
*NL*
boys
!
...
''
but
despite
their
united
efforts
the
wattle
hardly
moved
,
and
*NL*
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
men
was
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
you
of
the
Sixth
Company
!
Devils
that
you
are
!
Lend
a
hand
...
*NL*
will
you
?
You
may
want
us
one
of
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
twenty
men
of
the
Sixth
Company
who
were
on
their
way
into
the
*NL*
village
joined
the
haulers
,
and
the
wattle
wall
,
which
was
about
thirty
-
*NL*
five
feet
long
and
seven
feet
high
,
moved
forward
along
the
village
*NL*
street
,
swaying
,
pressing
upon
and
cutting
the
shoulders
of
the
gasping
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
...
Falling
?
What
are
you
stopping
for
?
There
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Merry
senseless
words
of
abuse
flowed
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
up
to
?
''
suddenly
came
the
authoritative
voice
of
a
*NL*
sergeant
major
who
came
upon
the
men
who
were
hauling
their
burden
.
*NL*
``
There
are
gentry
here
;
the
general
himself
is
in
that
hut
,
and
you
*NL*
foul-mouthed
devils
,
you
brutes
,
I
'll
give
it
to
you
!
''
shouted
he
,
*NL*
hitting
the
first
man
who
came
in
his
way
a
swinging
blow
on
the
back
.
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
make
less
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
became
silent
.
The
soldier
who
had
been
struck
groaned
and
wiped
*NL*
his
face
,
which
had
been
scratched
till
it
bled
by
his
falling
against
*NL*
the
wattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
how
that
devil
hits
out
!
He
's
made
my
face
all
bloody
,
''
said
he
*NL*
in
a
frightened
whisper
when
the
sergeant
major
had
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
it
?
''
said
a
laughing
voice
,
and
moderating
their
tones
*NL*
the
men
moved
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
out
of
the
village
they
began
talking
again
as
loud
as
*NL*
before
,
interlarding
their
talk
with
the
same
aimless
expletives
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hut
which
the
men
had
passed
,
the
chief
officers
had
gathered
and
*NL*
were
in
animated
talk
over
their
tea
about
the
events
of
the
day
and
the
*NL*
maneuvers
suggested
for
tomorrow
.
It
was
proposed
to
make
a
flank
march
*NL*
to
the
left
,
cut
off
the
Vice-King
-LRB-
Murat
-RRB-
and
capture
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
the
soldiers
had
dragged
the
wattle
fence
to
its
place
the
*NL*
campfires
were
blazing
on
all
sides
ready
for
cooking
,
the
wood
*NL*
crackled
,
the
snow
was
melting
,
and
black
shadows
of
soldiers
flitted
to
*NL*
and
fro
all
over
the
occupied
space
where
the
snow
had
been
trodden
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Axes
and
choppers
were
plied
all
around
.
Everything
was
done
without
any
*NL*
orders
being
given
.
Stores
of
wood
were
brought
for
the
night
,
shelters
*NL*
were
rigged
up
for
the
officers
,
caldrons
were
being
boiled
,
and
muskets
*NL*
and
accouterments
put
in
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wattle
wall
the
men
had
brought
was
set
up
in
a
semicircle
by
the
*NL*
Eighth
Company
as
a
shelter
from
the
north
,
propped
up
by
musket
rests
,
*NL*
and
a
campfire
was
built
before
it
.
They
beat
the
tattoo
,
called
the
*NL*
roll
,
had
supper
,
and
settled
down
round
the
fires
for
the
night
--
some
*NL*
repairing
their
footgear
,
some
smoking
pipes
,
and
some
stripping
*NL*
themselves
naked
to
steam
the
lice
out
of
their
shirts
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
thought
that
under
the
almost
incredibly
wretched
*NL*
conditions
the
Russian
soldiers
were
in
at
that
time
--
lacking
warm
boots
*NL*
and
sheepskin
coats
,
without
a
roof
over
their
heads
,
in
the
snow
with
*NL*
eighteen
degrees
of
frost
,
and
without
even
full
rations
-LRB-
the
*NL*
commissariat
did
not
always
keep
up
with
the
troops
-RRB-
--
they
would
have
*NL*
presented
a
very
sad
and
depressing
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
the
army
had
never
under
the
best
material
conditions
*NL*
presented
a
more
cheerful
and
animated
aspect
.
This
was
because
all
who
*NL*
began
to
grow
depressed
or
who
lost
strength
were
sifted
out
of
the
army
*NL*
day
by
day
.
All
the
physically
or
morally
weak
had
long
since
been
left
*NL*
behind
and
only
the
flower
of
the
army
--
physically
and
mentally
--
*NL*
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
men
collected
behind
the
wattle
fence
of
the
Eighth
Company
than
*NL*
anywhere
else
.
Two
sergeants
major
were
sitting
with
them
and
their
*NL*
campfire
blazed
brighter
than
others
.
For
leave
to
sit
by
their
wattle
*NL*
they
demanded
contributions
of
fuel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Makeev
!
What
has
become
of
you
,
you
son
of
a
bitch
?
Are
you
lost
or
*NL*
have
the
wolves
eaten
you
?
Fetch
some
more
wood
!
''
shouted
a
red-haired
*NL*
and
red-faced
man
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
blinking
because
of
the
*NL*
smoke
but
not
moving
back
from
the
fire
.
``
And
you
,
Jackdaw
,
go
and
fetch
*NL*
some
wood
!
''
said
he
to
another
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
red-haired
man
was
neither
a
sergeant
nor
a
corporal
,
but
being
*NL*
robust
he
ordered
about
those
weaker
than
himself
.
The
soldier
they
*NL*
called
``
Jackdaw
,
''
a
thin
little
fellow
with
a
sharp
nose
,
rose
*NL*
obediently
and
was
about
to
go
but
at
that
instant
there
came
into
the
*NL*
light
of
the
fire
the
slender
,
handsome
figure
of
a
young
soldier
*NL*
carrying
a
load
of
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
here
--
that
's
fine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
split
up
the
wood
,
pressed
it
down
on
the
fire
,
blew
at
it
with
*NL*
their
mouths
,
and
fanned
it
with
the
skirts
of
their
greatcoats
,
making
*NL*
the
flames
hiss
and
crackle
.
The
men
drew
nearer
and
lit
their
pipes
.
*NL*
The
handsome
young
soldier
who
had
brought
the
wood
,
setting
his
arms
*NL*
akimbo
,
began
stamping
his
cold
feet
rapidly
and
deftly
on
the
spot
*NL*
where
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
The
dew
is
cold
but
clear
...
It
's
well
that
I
'm
a
*NL*
musketeer
...
''
he
sang
,
pretending
to
hiccough
after
each
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
,
your
soles
will
fly
off
!
''
shouted
the
red-haired
man
,
*NL*
noticing
that
the
sole
of
the
dancer
's
boot
was
hanging
loose
.
``
What
a
*NL*
fellow
you
are
for
dancing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancer
stopped
,
pulled
off
the
loose
piece
of
leather
,
and
threw
it
*NL*
on
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
enough
,
friend
,
''
said
he
,
and
,
having
sat
down
,
took
out
of
his
*NL*
knapsack
a
scrap
of
blue
French
cloth
,
and
wrapped
it
round
his
foot
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
steam
that
spoils
them
,
''
he
added
,
stretching
out
his
feet
*NL*
toward
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
soon
be
issuing
us
new
ones
.
They
say
that
when
we
've
finished
*NL*
hammering
them
,
we
're
to
receive
double
kits
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
son
of
a
bitch
Petrov
has
lagged
behind
after
all
,
it
seems
,
''
*NL*
said
one
sergeant
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
an
eye
on
him
this
long
while
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
a
poor
sort
of
soldier
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
Third
Company
they
say
nine
men
were
missing
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
very
well
,
but
when
a
man
's
feet
are
frozen
how
can
he
*NL*
walk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
!
''
said
a
sergeant
major
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
be
doing
the
same
?
''
said
an
old
soldier
,
turning
*NL*
reproachfully
to
the
man
who
had
spoken
of
frozen
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
''
said
the
sharp-nosed
man
they
called
Jackdaw
in
a
*NL*
squeaky
and
unsteady
voice
,
raising
himself
at
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
fire
,
``
a
plump
man
gets
thin
,
but
for
a
thin
one
it
's
death
.
Take
me
,
*NL*
now
!
I
've
got
no
strength
left
,
''
he
added
,
with
sudden
resolution
*NL*
turning
to
the
sergeant
major
.
``
Tell
them
to
send
me
to
hospital
;
I
'm
*NL*
aching
all
over

anyway
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
keep
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
that
'll
do
!
''
replied
the
sergeant
major
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
said
no
more
and
the
talk
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
lot
of
those
Frenchies
were
taken
today
,
and
the
fact
is
that
*NL*
not
one
of
them
had
what
you
might
call
real
boots
on

said
a
soldier
,
*NL*
starting
a
new
theme
.
``
They
were
no
more
than
make-believes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Cossacks
have
taken
their
boots

They
were
clearing
the
hut
for
the
*NL*
colonel
and
carried
them
out
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
them

boys

put
in
*NL*
the
dancer
.
``
As
they
turned
them
over
one
seemed
still
alive

,
would
*NL*
you
believe
it

he
jabbered
something
in
their
lingo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
a
clean
folk
,
lads
,
''
the
first
man
went
on
;
``
he
was
white
--
*NL*
as
white
as
birchbark

and
some
of
them
are
such
fine
fellows

you
might
*NL*
think
they
were
nobles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think

They
make
soldiers
of
all
classes
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
do
n't
understand
our
talk
at
all

said
the
dancer
with
a
*NL*
puzzled
smile
.
``
I
asked
him
whose
subject
he
was

he
jabbered
in
his

own
way

A
queer
lot
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
strange

friends

continued
the
man
who
had
wondered
at
their
*NL*
whiteness
,
``
the
peasants
at
Mozhaysk
were
saying
that
when
they
began

burying
the
dead

where
the
battle
was
you
know

well
,
those
dead
had
*NL*
been
lying
there
for
nearly
a
month

and
says
the
peasant
,
`
they
lie
as
*NL*
white
as
paper

clean
,
and
not
as
much
smell
as
a
puff
of
powder
*NL*
smoke

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
from
the
cold
?

asked
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
clever
fellow

From
the
cold

Why

it
was
hot

If

had
been
from
the
cold

But

he
*NL*
says
,
`
go
up
to
ours
and
they
are
all
rotten
and
maggoty

So
,
'
he
says
,
*NL*
`
we
tie
our
faces
up
with
kerchiefs
and
turn
our
heads
away
as
we
drag
*NL*
them
off
:
we
can
hardly
do
it
.
But
theirs
,
'
he
says
,
`
are
white
as
paper
*NL*
and
not
so
much
smell
as
a
whiff
of
gunpowder

*NL*
*NL*
All
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
from
their
food
,
''
said
the
sergeant
major
.
``
They
used
to
*NL*
gobble
the
same
food
as
the
gentry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
contradicted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
peasant
near
Mozhaysk
where
the
battle
was
said
the
men
were
all
*NL*
called
up
from
ten
villages
around
and
they
carted
for
twenty
days

*NL*
still
did

finish
carting
the
dead
away

And
as
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was

an

*NL*

catches

no

He
turns
into

flies
away

there

*NL*
the
old

yawning

*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
flagged
,
and
the
soldiers
began
settling
down
to
sleep

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look

said
one

gazing
with

admiration
at

*NL*
In
the
silence
that
ensued
,
the
snoring
of
those
who
had
fallen
asleep
*NL*
could
be
heard

Others
turned
over
and
warmed
themselves
,
now

again
*NL*
exchanging
a
few
words

From
a
campfire
a
hundred
paces
off
came
a
sound

of
general
,
merry
laughter

``

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
company
was
bivouacking
at
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
.
A
huge
*NL*
campfire
was
blazing
brightly
in
the
midst
of
the
snow
,
lighting
up
the
*NL*
branches
of
trees
heavy
with
hoarfrost
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
midnight
they
heard
the
sound
of
steps
in
the
snow
of
the
forest
,
*NL*
and
the
crackling
of
dry
branches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bear
,
lads
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
raised
their
heads
to
listen
,
and
out
of
the
forest
into
the
*NL*
bright
firelight
stepped
two
strangely
clad
human
figures
clinging
to
*NL*
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
two
Frenchmen
who
had
been
hiding
in
the
forest
.
They
came
up
*NL*
to
the
fire
,
hoarsely
uttering
something
in
a
language
our
soldiers
did
*NL*
not
understand
.
One
was
taller
than
the
other
;
he
wore
an
officer
's
hat
*NL*
and
seemed
quite
exhausted
.
On
approaching
the
fire
he
had
been
going
to
*NL*
sit
down
,
but
fell
.
The
other
,
a
short
sturdy
soldier
with
a
shawl
tied
*NL*
round
his
head
,
was
stronger
.
He
raised
his
companion
and
said
*NL*
something
,
pointing
to
his
mouth
.
The
soldiers
surrounded
the
Frenchmen
,
*NL*
spread
a
greatcoat
on
the
ground
for
the
sick
man
,
and
brought
some
*NL*
buckwheat
porridge
and
vodka
for
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exhausted
French
officer
was
Ramballe
and
the
man
with
his
head
*NL*
wrapped
in
the
shawl
was
Morel
,
his
orderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Morel
had
drunk
some
vodka
and
finished
his
bowl
of
porridge
he
*NL*
suddenly
became
unnaturally
merry
and
chattered
incessantly
to
the
*NL*
soldiers
,
who
could
not
understand
him
.
Ramballe
refused
food
and
*NL*
resting
his
head
on
his
elbow
lay
silent
beside
the
campfire
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
Russian
soldiers
with
red
and
vacant
eyes
.
Occasionally
he
emitted
a
*NL*
long-drawn
groan
and
then
again
became
silent
.
Morel
,
pointing
to
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
tried
to
impress
on
the
soldiers
the
fact
that
Ramballe
was
*NL*
an
officer
and
ought
to
be
warmed
.
A
Russian
officer
who
had
come
up
to
*NL*
the
fire
sent
to
ask
his
colonel
whether
he
would
not
take
a
French
*NL*
officer
into
his
hut
to
warm
him
,
and
when
the
messenger
returned
and
*NL*
said
that
the
colonel
wished
the
officer
to
be
brought
to
him
,
Ramballe
*NL*
was
told
to
go
.
He
rose
and
tried
to
walk
,
but
staggered
and
would
have
*NL*
fallen
had
not
a
soldier
standing
by
held
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
do
it
again
,
eh
?
''
said
one
of
the
soldiers
,
winking
and
*NL*
turning
mockingly
to
Ramballe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
fool
!
Why
talk
rubbish
,
lout
that
you
are
--
a
real
peasant
!
''
*NL*
came
rebukes
from
all
sides
addressed
to
the
jesting
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
surrounded
Ramballe
,
lifted
him
on
the
crossed
arms
of
two
*NL*
soldiers
,
and
carried
him
to
the
hut
.
Ramballe
put
his
arms
around
their
*NL*
necks
while
they
carried
him
and
began
wailing
plaintively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
fine
fellows
,
my
kind
,
kind
friends
!
These
are
men
!
Oh
,
my
*NL*
brave
,
kind
friends
,
''
and
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
shoulder
of
one
*NL*
of
the
men
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Morel
was
sitting
in
the
best
place
by
the
fire
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
,
a
short
sturdy
Frenchman
with
inflamed
and
streaming
eyes
,
was
*NL*
wearing
a
woman
's
cloak
and
had
a
shawl
tied
woman
fashion
round
his
*NL*
head
over
his
cap
.
He
was
evidently
tipsy
,
and
was
singing
a
French
song
*NL*
in
a
hoarse
broken
voice
,
with
an
arm
thrown
round
the
nearest
soldier
.
*NL*
The
soldiers
simply
held
their
sides
as
they
watched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
now
then
,
teach
us
how
it
goes
!
I
'll
soon
pick
it
up
.
How
is
*NL*
it
?
''
said
the
man
--
a
singer
and
a
wag
--
whom
Morel
was
embracing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vive
Henri
Quatre
!
Vive
ce
roi
valiant
!
''
sang
Morel
,
winking
.
``
Ce
*NL*
diable
a
quatre
...
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
``
Long
live
Henry
the
Fourth
,
that
valiant
king
!
That
rowdy
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vivarika
!
Vif-seruvaru
!
Sedyablyaka
!
''
repeated
the
soldier
,
flourishing
*NL*
his
arm
and
really
catching
the
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
rose
their
rough
,
joyous
laughter
from
all
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
,
wrinkling
up
his
face
,
laughed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
on
,
go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
Zaletaev
,
brought
out
with
effort
:
``
ke-e-e-e

''
he
drawled
,
*NL*
laboriously
pursing
his
lips
,
``
le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba
,
e
de-tra-va
-
*NL*

he
sang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Just

Oh

Do
you
want

more

*NL*
*NL*
``
Give

it
takes
a
long
time
to

filled
up
after

*NL*
*NL*
They
gave
him
some
more
porridge
and
Morel
with
a
laugh
set
to
work
on
*NL*
his
third
bowl
.
All
the
young
soldiers
smiled
gaily
as
they
watched
him
.
*NL*
The
older
men
,
who
thought
it
undignified
to
amuse
themselves
with
such
*NL*
nonsense
,
continued
to
lie
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
but
one
*NL*
would
occasionally
raise
himself
on
an
elbow
and
glance
at
Morel
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
men
too
,
''
said
one
of
them
as
he
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
*NL*
coat
.
``
Even
wormwood
grows
on
its
own
root

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord

O
Lord

How
starry
it

Tremendous

That
means
a
hard
*NL*
frost

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
grew
silent
.
The
stars
,
as
if
knowing
that
no
one
was
looking
*NL*
at
them
,
began
to
disport
themselves
in
the
dark
sky
:
now
flaring
up
,
*NL*
now
vanishing
,
now
trembling
,
they
were
busy
whispering
something

gladsome
and
mysterious
to
one
another

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
army
melted
away
at
the
uniform
rate
of
a
mathematical
*NL*
progression
;
and
that
crossing
of
the
Berezina
about
which
so
much
has
*NL*
been
written
was
only
one
intermediate
stage
in
its
destruction
,
and
not
*NL*
at
all
the
decisive
episode
of
the
campaign
.
If
so
much
has
been
and
*NL*
still
is
written
about
the
Berezina
,
on
the
French
side
this
is
only
*NL*
because
at
the
broken
bridge
across
that
river
the
calamities
their
army
*NL*
had
been
previously
enduring
were
suddenly
concentrated
at
one
moment
*NL*
into
a
tragic
spectacle
that
remained
in
every
memory
,
and
on
the
*NL*
Russian
side
merely
because
in
Petersburg
--
far
from
the
seat
of
war
--
a
*NL*
plan
-LRB-
again
one
of
Pfuel
's
-RRB-
had
been
devised
to
catch
Napoleon
in
a
*NL*
strategic
trap
at
the
Berezina
River
.
Everyone
assured
himself
that
all
*NL*
would
happen
according
to
plan
,
and
therefore
insisted
that
it
was
just
*NL*
the
crossing
of
the
Berezina
that
destroyed
the
French
army
.
In
reality
*NL*
the
results
of
the
crossing
were
much
less
disastrous
to
the
French
--
in
*NL*
guns
and
men
lost
--
than
Krasnoe
had
been
,
as
the
figures
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sole
importance
of
the
crossing
of
the
Berezina
lies
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
it
plainly
and
indubitably
proved
the
fallacy
of
all
the
plans
for
*NL*
cutting
off
the
enemy
's
retreat
and
the
soundness
of
the
only
possible
*NL*
line
of
action
--
the
one
Kutuzov
and
the
general
mass
of
the
army
*NL*
demanded
--
namely
,
simply
to
follow
the
enemy
up
.
The
French
crowd
fled
*NL*
at
a
continually
increasing
speed
and
all
its
energy
was
directed
to
*NL*
reaching
its
goal
.
It
fled
like
a
wounded
animal
and
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
block
its
path
.
This
was
shown
not
so
much
by
the
arrangements
it
*NL*
made
for
crossing
as
by
what
took
place
at
the
bridges
.
When
the
bridges
*NL*
broke
down
,
unarmed
soldiers
,
people
from
Moscow
and
women
with
children
*NL*
who
were
with
the
French
transport
,
all
--
carried
on
by
vis
inertiae
--
*NL*
pressed
forward
into
boats
and
into
the
ice-covered
water
and
did
not
,
*NL*
surrender
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
impulse
was
reasonable
.
The
condition
of
fugitives
and
of
pursuers
*NL*
was
equally
bad
.
As
long
as
they
remained
with
their
own
people
each
*NL*
might
hope
for
help
from
his
fellows
and
the
definite
place
he
held
*NL*
among
them
.
But
those
who
surrendered
,
while
remaining
in
the
same
*NL*
pitiful
plight
,
would
be
on
a
lower
level
to
claim
a
share
in
the
*NL*
necessities
of
life
.
The
French
did
not
need
to
be
informed
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
half
the
prisoners
--
with
whom
the
Russians
did
not
know
what
to
do
-
*NL*
-
perished
of
cold
and
hunger
despite
their
captors
'
desire
to
save
them
;
*NL*
they
felt
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
.
The
most
compassionate
Russian
*NL*
commanders
,
those
favorable
to
the
French
--
and
even
the
Frenchmen
in
the
*NL*
Russian
service
--
could
do
nothing
for
the
prisoners
.
The
French
perished
*NL*
from
the
conditions
to
which
the
Russian
army
was
itself
exposed
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
take
bread
and
clothes
from
our
hungry
and
indispensable
*NL*
soldiers
to
give
to
the
French
who
,
though
not
harmful
,
or
hated
,
or
*NL*
guilty
,
were
simply
unnecessary
.
Some
Russians
even
did
that
,
but
they
*NL*
were
exceptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
destruction
lay
behind
the
French
but
in
front
there
was
hope
.
*NL*
Their
ships
had
been
burned
,
there
was
no
salvation
save
in
collective
*NL*
flight
,
and
on
that
the
whole
strength
of
the
French
was
concentrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farther
they
fled
the
more
wretched
became
the
plight
of
the
*NL*
remnant
,
especially
after
the
Berezina
,
on
which
-LRB-
in
consequence
of
the
*NL*
Petersburg
plan
-RRB-
special
hopes
had
been
placed
by
the
Russians
,
and
the
*NL*
keener
grew
the
passions
of
the
Russian
commanders
,
who
blamed
one
*NL*
another
and
Kutuzov
most
of
all
.
Anticipation
that
the
failure
of
the
*NL*
Petersburg
Berezina
plan
would
be
attributed
to
Kutuzov
led
to
*NL*
dissatisfaction
,
contempt
,
and
ridicule
,
more
and
more
strongly
*NL*
expressed
.
The
ridicule
and
contempt
were
of
course
expressed
in
a
*NL*
respectful
form
,
making
it
impossible
for
him
to
ask
wherein
he
was
to
*NL*
blame
.
They
did
not
talk
seriously
to
him
;
when
reporting
to
him
or
*NL*
asking
for
his
sanction
they
appeared
to
be
fulfilling
a
regrettable
*NL*
formality
,
but
they
winked
behind
his
back
and
tried
to
mislead
him
at
*NL*
every
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
they
could
not
understand
him
all
these
people
assumed
that
it
*NL*
was
useless
to
talk
to
the
old
man
;
that
he
would
never
grasp
the
*NL*
profundity
of
their
plans
,
that
he
would
answer
with
his
phrases
-LRB-
which
*NL*
they
thought
were
mere
phrases
-RRB-
about
a
``
golden
bridge
,
''
about
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
crossing
the
frontier
with
a
crowd
of
tatterdemalions
,
*NL*
and
so
forth
.
They
had
heard
all
that
before
.
And
all
he
said
--
that
it
*NL*
was
necessary
to
await
provisions
,
or
that
the
men
had
no
boots
--
was
so
*NL*
simple
,
while
what
they
proposed
was
so
complicated
and
clever
,
that
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
was
old
and
stupid
and
that
they
,
though
not
in
*NL*
power
,
were
commanders
of
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
junction
with
the
army
of
the
brilliant
admiral
and
Petersburg
*NL*
hero
Wittgenstein
,
this
mood
and
the
gossip
of
the
staff
reached
their
*NL*
maximum
.
Kutuzov
saw
this
and
merely
sighed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
Only
once
,
after
the
affair
of
the
Berezina
,
did
he
get
angry
and
write
*NL*
to
Bennigsen
-LRB-
who
reported
separately
to
the
Emperor
-RRB-
the
following
*NL*
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
account
of
your
spells
of
ill
health
,
will
your
excellency
please
be
*NL*
so
good
as
to
set
off
for
Kaluga
on
receipt
of
this
,
and
there
await
*NL*
further
commands
and
appointments
from
His
Imperial
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
Bennigsen
's
departure
,
the
Grand
Duke
Tsarevich
Constantine
*NL*
Pavlovich
joined
the
army
.
He
had
taken
part
in
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
campaign
but
had
subsequently
been
removed
from
the
army
by
Kutuzov
.
Now
*NL*
having
come
to
the
army
,
he
informed
Kutuzov
of
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
displeasure
at
the
poor
success
of
our
forces
and
the
slowness
of
their
*NL*
advance
.
The
Emperor
intended
to
join
the
army
personally
in
a
few
days
'
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
experienced
in
court
as
well
as
in
military
affairs
--
this
*NL*
same
Kutuzov
who
in
August
had
been
chosen
commander-in-chief
against
*NL*
the
sovereign
's
wishes
and
who
had
removed
the
Grand
Duke
and
heir
--
*NL*
apparent
from
the
army
--
who
on
his
own
authority
and
contrary
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
will
had
decided
on
the
abandonment
of
Moscow
,
now
realized
at
*NL*
once
that
his
day
was
over
,
that
his
part
was
played
,
and
that
the
power
*NL*
he
was
supposed
to
hold
was
no
longer
his
.
And
he
understood
this
not
*NL*
merely
from
the
attitude
of
the
court
.
He
saw
on
the
one
hand
that
the
*NL*
military
business
in
which
he
had
played
his
part
was
ended
and
felt
*NL*
that
his
mission
was
accomplished
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
be
*NL*
conscious
of
the
physical
weariness
of
his
aged
body
and
of
the
*NL*
necessity
of
physical
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-ninth
of
November
Kutuzov
entered
Vilna
--
his
``
dear
Vilna
''
*NL*
as
he
called
it
.
Twice
during
his
career
Kutuzov
had
been
governor
of
*NL*
Vilna
.
In
that
wealthy
town
,
which
had
not
been
injured
,
he
found
old
*NL*
friends
and
associations
,
besides
the
comforts
of
life
of
which
he
had
*NL*
so
long
been
deprived
.
And
he
suddenly
turned
from
the
cares
of
army
and
*NL*
state
and
,
as
far
as
the
passions
that
seethed
around
him
allowed
,
*NL*
immersed
himself
in
the
quiet
life
to
which
he
had
formerly
been
*NL*
accustomed
,
as
if
all
that
was
taking
place
and
all
that
had
still
to
be
*NL*
done
in
the
realm
of
history
did
not
concern
him
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chichagov
,
one
of
the
most
zealous
``
cutters-off
''
and
``
breakers-up
,
''
who
*NL*
had
first
wanted
to
effect
a
diversion
in
Greece
and
then
in
Warsaw
but
*NL*
never
wished
to
go
where
he
was
sent
:
Chichagov
,
noted
for
the
boldness
*NL*
with
which
he
spoke
to
the
Emperor
,
and
who
considered
Kutuzov
to
be
*NL*
under
an
obligation
to
him
because
when
he
was
sent
to
make
peace
with
*NL*
Turkey
in
1811
independently
of
Kutuzov
,
and
found
that
peace
had
*NL*
already
been
concluded
,
he
admitted
to
the
Emperor
that
the
merit
of
*NL*
securing
that
peace
was
really
Kutuzov
's
;
this
Chichagov
was
the
first
*NL*
to
meet
Kutuzov
at
the
castle
where
the
latter
was
to
stay
.
In
undress
*NL*
naval
uniform
,
with
a
dirk
,
and
holding
his
cap
under
his
arm
,
he
handed
*NL*
Kutuzov
a
garrison
report
and
the
keys
of
the
town
.
The
contemptuously
*NL*
respectful
attitude
of
the
younger
men
to
the
old
man
in
his
dotage
was
*NL*
expressed
in
the
highest
degree
by
the
behavior
of
Chichagov
,
who
knew
*NL*
of
the
accusations
that
were
being
directed
against
Kutuzov
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
speaking
to
Chichagov
,
Kutuzov
incidentally
mentioned
that
the
*NL*
vehicles
packed
with
china
that
had
been
captured
from
him
at
Borisov
*NL*
had
been
recovered
and
would
be
restored
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
imply
that
I
have
nothing
to
eat
out
of
...
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
can
supply
you
with
everything
even
if
you
want
to
give
*NL*
dinner
parties
,
''
warmly
replied
Chichagov
,
who
tried
by
every
word
he
*NL*
spoke
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
therefore
imagined
Kutuzov
to
be
*NL*
animated
by
the
same
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
replied
with
his
subtle
penetrating
*NL*
smile
:
``
I
meant
merely
to
say
what
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Contrary
to
the
Emperor
's
wish
Kutuzov
detained
the
greater
part
of
the
*NL*
army
at
Vilna
.
Those
about
him
said
that
he
became
extraordinarily
slack
*NL*
and
physically
feeble
during
his
stay
in
that
town
.
He
attended
to
army
*NL*
affairs
reluctantly
,
left
everything
to
his
generals
,
and
while
awaiting
*NL*
the
Emperor
's
arrival
led
a
dissipated
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
left
Petersburg
on
the
seventh
of
December
with
his
suite
--
Count
*NL*
Tolstoy
,
Prince
Volkonski
,
Arakcheev
,
and
others
--
the
Emperor
reached
*NL*
Vilna
on
the
eleventh
,
and
in
his
traveling
sleigh
drove
straight
to
the
*NL*
castle
.
In
spite
of
the
severe
frost
some
hundred
generals
and
staff
*NL*
officers
in
full
parade
uniform
stood
in
front
of
the
castle
,
as
well
as
*NL*
a
guard
of
honor
of
the
Semenov
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
courier
who
galloped
to
the
castle
in
advance
,
in
a
troyka
with
three
*NL*
foam-flecked
horses
,
shouted
``
Coming
!
''
and
Konovnitsyn
rushed
into
the
*NL*
vestibule
to
inform
Kutuzov
,
who
was
waiting
in
the
hall
porter
's
little
*NL*
lodge
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
later
the
old
man
's
large
stout
figure
in
full-dress
uniform
,
*NL*
his
chest
covered
with
orders
and
a
scarf
drawn
round
his
stomach
,
*NL*
waddled
out
into
the
porch
.
He
put
on
his
hat
with
its
peaks
to
the
*NL*
sides
and
,
holding
his
gloves
in
his
hand
and
walking
with
an
effort
*NL*
sideways
down
the
steps
to
the
level
of
the
street
,
took
in
his
hand
the
*NL*
report
he
had
prepared
for
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
running
to
and
fro
and
whispering
;
another
troyka
flew
*NL*
furiously
up
,
and
then
all
eyes
were
turned
on
an
approaching
sleigh
in
*NL*
which
the
figures
of
the
Emperor
and
Volkonski
could
already
be
*NL*
descried
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
habit
of
fifty
years
all
this
had
a
physically
agitating
effect
*NL*
on
the
old
general
.
He
carefully
and
hastily
felt
himself
all
over
,
*NL*
readjusted
his
hat
,
and
pulling
himself
together
drew
himself
up
and
,
at
*NL*
the
very
moment
when
the
Emperor
,
having
alighted
from
the
sleigh
,
*NL*
lifted
his
eyes
to
him
,
handed
him
the
report
and
began
speaking
in
his
*NL*
smooth
,
ingratiating
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
with
a
rapid
glance
scanned
Kutuzov
from
head
to
foot
,
*NL*
frowned
for
an
instant
,
but
immediately
mastering
himself
went
up
to
the
*NL*
old
man
,
extended
his
arms
and
embraced
him
.
And
this
embrace
too
,
owing
*NL*
to
a
long-standing
impression
related
to
his
innermost
feelings
,
had
its
*NL*
usual
effect
on
Kutuzov
and
he
gave
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
greeted
the
officers
and
the
Semenov
guard
,
and
again
*NL*
pressing
the
old
man
's
hand
went
with
him
into
the
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
alone
with
the
field
marshal
the
Emperor
expressed
his
*NL*
dissatisfaction
at
the
slowness
of
the
pursuit
and
at
the
mistakes
made
*NL*
at
Krasnoe
and
the
Berezina
,
and
informed
him
of
his
intentions
for
a
*NL*
future
campaign
abroad
.
Kutuzov
made
no
rejoinder
or
remark
.
The
same
*NL*
submissive
,
expressionless
look
with
which
he
had
listened
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
commands
on
the
field
of
Austerlitz
seven
years
before
settled
*NL*
on
his
face
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Kutuzov
came
out
of
the
study
and
with
lowered
head
was
crossing
*NL*
the
ballroom
with
his
heavy
waddling
gait
,
he
was
arrested
by
someone
's
*NL*
voice
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Serene
Highness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
raised
his
head
and
looked
for
a
long
while
into
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Count
Tolstoy
,
who
stood
before
him
holding
a
silver
salver
on
which
lay
*NL*
a
small
object
.
Kutuzov
seemed
not
to
understand
what
was
expected
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
seemed
to
remember
;
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
flashed
*NL*
across
his
puffy
face
,
and
bowing
low
and
respectfully
he
took
the
*NL*
object
that
lay
on
the
salver
.
It
was
the
Order
of
St.
George
of
the
*NL*
First
Class
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
the
field
marshal
gave
a
dinner
and
ball
which
the
Emperor
*NL*
honored
by
his
presence
.
Kutuzov
had
received
the
Order
of
St.
George
of
*NL*
the
First
Class
and
the
Emperor
showed
him
the
highest
honors
,
but
*NL*
everyone
knew
of
the
imperial
dissatisfaction
with
him
.
The
proprieties
*NL*
were
observed
and
the
Emperor
was
the
first
to
set
that
example
,
but
*NL*
everybody
understood
that
the
old
man
was
blameworthy
and
good-for
-
*NL*
nothing
.
When
Kutuzov
,
conforming
to
a
custom
of
Catherine
's
day
,
*NL*
ordered
the
standards
that
had
been
captured
to
be
lowered
at
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
feet
on
his
entering
the
ballroom
,
the
Emperor
made
a
wry
face
*NL*
and
muttered
something
in
which
some
people
caught
the
words
,
``
the
old
*NL*
comedian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
's
displeasure
with
Kutuzov
was
specially
increased
at
Vilna
*NL*
by
the
fact
that
Kutuzov
evidently
could
not
or
would
not
understand
the
*NL*
importance
of
the
coming
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
on
the
following
morning
the
Emperor
said
to
the
officers
assembled
*NL*
about
him
:
``
You
have
not
only
saved
Russia
,
you
have
saved
Europe
!
''
they
*NL*
all
understood
that
the
war
was
not
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
alone
would
not
see
this
and
openly
expressed
his
opinion
that
*NL*
no
fresh
war
could
improve
the
position
or
add
to
the
glory
of
Russia
,
*NL*
but
could
only
spoil
and
lower
the
glorious
position
that
Russia
had
*NL*
gained
.
He
tried
to
prove
to
the
Emperor
the
impossibility
of
levying
*NL*
fresh
troops
,
spoke
of
the
hardships
already
endured
by
the
people
,
of
*NL*
the
possibility
of
failure
and
so
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
the
field
marshal
's
frame
of
mind
he
was
naturally
regarded
*NL*
as
merely
a
hindrance
and
obstacle
to
the
impending
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
unpleasant
encounters
with
the
old
man
,
the
natural
method
was
*NL*
to
do
what
had
been
done
with
him
at
Austerlitz
and
with
Barclay
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
Russian
campaign
--
to
transfer
the
authority
to
the
*NL*
Emperor
himself
,
thus
cutting
the
ground
from
under
the
commander
in
*NL*
chief
's
feet
without
upsetting
the
old
man
by
informing
him
of
the
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
object
his
staff
was
gradually
reconstructed
and
its
real
*NL*
strength
removed
and
transferred
to
the
Emperor
.
Toll
,
Konovnitsyn
,
and
*NL*
Ermolov
received
fresh
appointments
.
Everyone
spoke
loudly
of
the
field
*NL*
marshal
's
great
weakness
and
failing
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
health
had
to
be
bad
for
his
place
to
be
taken
away
and
given
to
*NL*
another
.
And
in
fact
his
health
was
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
naturally
,
simply
,
and
gradually
--
just
as
he
had
come
from
Turkey
to
*NL*
the
Treasury
in
Petersburg
to
recruit
the
militia
,
and
then
to
the
army
*NL*
when
he
was
needed
there
--
now
when
his
part
was
played
out
,
Kutuzov
's
*NL*
place
was
taken
by
a
new
and
necessary
performer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
war
of
1812
,
besides
its
national
significance
dear
to
every
Russian
*NL*
heart
,
was
now
to
assume
another
,
a
European
,
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
was
to
be
succeeded
by
a
*NL*
movement
of
peoples
from
east
to
west
,
and
for
this
fresh
war
another
*NL*
leader
was
necessary
,
having
qualities
and
views
differing
from
*NL*
Kutuzov
's
and
animated
by
different
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
I
was
as
necessary
for
the
movement
of
the
peoples
from
east
*NL*
to
west
and
for
the
refixing
of
national
frontiers
as
Kutuzov
had
been
*NL*
for
the
salvation
and
glory
of
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kutuzov
did
not
understand
what
Europe
,
the
balance
of
power
,
or
*NL*
Napoleon
meant
.
He
could
not
understand
it
.
For
the
representative
of
*NL*
the
Russian
people
,
after
the
enemy
had
been
destroyed
and
Russia
had
*NL*
been
liberated
and
raised
to
the
summit
of
her
glory
,
there
was
nothing
*NL*
left
to
do
as
a
Russian
.
Nothing
remained
for
the
representative
of
the
*NL*
national
war
but
to
die
,
and
Kutuzov
died
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
As
generally
happens
,
Pierre
did
not
feel
the
full
effects
of
the
*NL*
physical
privation
and
strain
he
had
suffered
as
prisoner
until
after
*NL*
they
were
over
.
After
his
liberation
he
reached
Orel
,
and
on
the
third
*NL*
day
there
,
when
preparing
to
go
to
Kiev
,
he
fell
ill
and
was
laid
up
for
*NL*
three
months
.
He
had
what
the
doctors
termed
``
bilious
fever
.
''
But
*NL*
despite
the
fact
that
the
doctors
treated
him
,
bled
him
,
and
gave
him
*NL*
medicines
to
drink
,
he
recovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
any
impression
was
left
on
Pierre
's
mind
by
all
that
happened
*NL*
to
him
from
the
time
of
his
rescue
till
his
illness
.
He
remembered
only
*NL*
the
dull
gray
weather
now
rainy
and
now
snowy
,
internal
physical
*NL*
distress
,
and
pains
in
his
feet
and
side
.
He
remembered
a
general
*NL*
impression
of
the
misfortunes
and
sufferings
of
people
and
of
being
*NL*
worried
by
the
curiosity
of
officers
and
generals
who
questioned
him
,
he
*NL*
also
remembered
his
difficulty
in
procuring
a
conveyance
and
horses
,
and
*NL*
above
all
he
remembered
his
incapacity
to
think
and
feel
all
that
time
.
*NL*
On
the
day
of
his
rescue
he
had
seen
the
body
of
Petya
Rostov
.
That
same
*NL*
day
he
had
learned
that
Prince
Andrew
,
after
surviving
the
battle
of
*NL*
Borodino
for
more
than
a
month
had
recently
died
in
the
Rostovs
'
house
*NL*
at
Yaroslavl
,
and
Denisov
who
told
him
this
news
also
mentioned
Helene
's
*NL*
death
,
supposing
that
Pierre
had
heard
of
it
long
before
.
All
this
at
*NL*
the
time
seemed
merely
strange
to
Pierre
:
he
felt
he
could
not
grasp
its
*NL*
significance
.
Just
then
he
was
only
anxious
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
from
places
where
people
were
killing
one
another
,
to
some
*NL*
peaceful
refuge
where
he
could
recover
himself
,
rest
,
and
think
over
all
*NL*
the
strange
new
facts
he
had
learned
;
but
on
reaching
Orel
he
*NL*
immediately
fell
ill
.
When
he
came
to
himself
after
his
illness
he
saw
*NL*
in
attendance
on
him
two
of
his
servants
,
Terenty
and
Vaska
,
who
had
*NL*
come
from
Moscow
;
and
also
his
cousin
the
eldest
princess
,
who
had
been
*NL*
living
on
his
estate
at
Elets
and
hearing
of
his
rescue
and
illness
had
*NL*
come
to
look
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
gradually
during
his
convalescence
that
Pierre
lost
the
*NL*
impressions
he
had
become
accustomed
to
during
the
last
few
months
and
*NL*
got
used
to
the
idea
that
no
one
would
oblige
him
to
go
anywhere
*NL*
tomorrow
,
that
no
one
would
deprive
him
of
his
warm
bed
,
and
that
he
*NL*
would
be
sure
to
get
his
dinner
,
tea
,
and
supper
.
But
for
a
long
time
in
*NL*
his
dreams
he
still
saw
himself
in
the
conditions
of
captivity
.
In
the
*NL*
same
way
little
by
little
he
came
to
understand
the
news
he
had
been
*NL*
told
after
his
rescue
,
about
the
death
of
Prince
Andrew
,
the
death
of
*NL*
his
wife
,
and
the
destruction
of
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
joyous
feeling
of
freedom
--
that
complete
inalienable
freedom
natural
*NL*
to
man
which
he
had
first
experienced
at
the
first
halt
outside
Moscow
--
*NL*
filled
Pierre
's
soul
during
his
convalescence
.
He
was
surprised
to
find
*NL*
that
this
inner
freedom
,
which
was
independent
of
external
conditions
,
*NL*
now
had
as
it
were
an
additional
setting
of
external
liberty
.
He
was
*NL*
alone
in
a
strange
town
,
without
acquaintances
.
No
one
demanded
anything
*NL*
of
him
or
sent
him
anywhere
.
He
had
all
he
wanted
:
the
thought
of
his
*NL*
wife
which
had
been
a
continual
torment
to
him
was
no
longer
there
,
*NL*
since
she
was
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
good
!
How
splendid
!
''
said
he
to
himself
when
a
cleanly
laid
*NL*
table
was
moved
up
to
him
with
savory
beef
tea
,
or
when
he
lay
down
for
*NL*
the
night
on
a
soft
clean
bed
,
or
when
he
remembered
that
the
French
had
*NL*
gone
and
that
his
wife
was
no
more
.
``
Oh
,
how
good
,
how
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
old
habit
he
asked
himself
the
question
:
``
Well
,
and
what
then
?
*NL*
What
am
I
going
to
do
?
''
And
he
immediately
gave
himself
the
answer
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
live
.
Ah
,
how
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
question
that
had
formerly
tormented
him
,
the
thing
he
had
*NL*
continually
sought
to
find
--
the
aim
of
life
--
no
longer
existed
for
him
*NL*
now
.
That
search
for
the
aim
of
life
had
not
merely
disappeared
*NL*
temporarily
--
he
felt
that
it
no
longer
existed
for
him
and
could
not
*NL*
present
itself
again
.
And
this
very
absence
of
an
aim
gave
him
the
*NL*
complete
,
joyous
sense
of
freedom
which
constituted
his
happiness
at
*NL*
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
see
an
aim
,
for
he
now
had
faith
--
not
faith
in
any
kind
of
*NL*
rule
,
or
words
,
or
ideas
,
but
faith
in
an
ever-living
,
ever-manifest
*NL*
God
.
Formerly
he
had
sought
Him
in
aims
he
set
himself
.
That
search
for
*NL*
an
aim
had
been
simply
a
search
for
God
,
and
suddenly
in
his
captivity
*NL*
he
had
learned
not
by
words
or
reasoning
but
by
direct
feeling
what
his
*NL*
nurse
had
told
him
long
ago
:
that
God
is
here
and
everywhere
.
In
his
*NL*
captivity
he
had
learned
that
in
Karataev
God
was
greater
,
more
infinite
*NL*
and
unfathomable
than
in
the
Architect
of
the
Universe
recognized
by
the
*NL*
Freemasons
.
He
felt
like
a
man
who
after
straining
his
eyes
to
see
into
*NL*
the
far
distance
finds
what
he
sought
at
his
very
feet
.
All
his
life
he
*NL*
had
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
men
around
him
,
when
he
should
have
*NL*
merely
looked
in
front
of
him
without
straining
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
past
he
had
never
been
able
to
find
that
great
inscrutable
*NL*
infinite
something
.
He
had
only
felt
that
it
must
exist
somewhere
and
*NL*
had
looked
for
it
.
In
everything
near
and
comprehensible
he
had
only
*NL*
what
was
limited
,
petty
,
commonplace
,
and
senseless
.
He
had
equipped
*NL*
himself
with
a
mental
telescope
and
looked
into
remote
space
,
where
*NL*
petty
worldliness
hiding
itself
in
misty
distance
had
seemed
to
him
*NL*
great
and
infinite
merely
because
it
was
not
clearly
seen
.
And
such
had
*NL*
European
life
,
politics
,
Freemasonry
,
philosophy
,
and
philanthropy
*NL*
seemed
to
him
.
But
even
then
,
at
moments
of
weakness
as
he
had
accounted
*NL*
them
,
his
mind
had
penetrated
to
those
distances
and
he
had
there
seen
*NL*
the
same
pettiness
,
worldliness
,
and
senselessness
.
Now
,
however
,
he
had
*NL*
learned
to
see
the
great
,
eternal
,
and
infinite
in
everything
,
and
*NL*
therefore
--
to
see
it
and
enjoy
its
contemplation
--
he
naturally
threw
*NL*
away
the
telescope
through
which
he
had
till
now
gazed
over
men
's
heads
,
*NL*
and
gladly
regarded
the
ever-changing
,
eternally
great
,
unfathomable
,
*NL*
and
infinite
life
around
him
.
And
the
closer
he
looked
the
more
tranquil
*NL*
and
happy
he
became
.
That
dreadful
question
,
``
What
for
?
''
which
had
*NL*
formerly
destroyed
all
his
mental
edifices
,
no
longer
existed
for
him
.
*NL*
To
that
question
,
``
What
for
?
''
a
simple
answer
was
now
always
ready
in
*NL*
his
soul
:
``
Because
there
is
a
God
,
that
God
without
whose
will
not
one
*NL*
hair
falls
from
a
man
's
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
In
external
ways
Pierre
had
hardly
changed
at
all
.
In
appearance
he
was
*NL*
just
what
he
used
to
be
.
As
before
he
was
absent-minded
and
seemed
*NL*
occupied
not
with
what
was
before
his
eyes
but
with
something
special
of
*NL*
his
own
.
The
difference
between
his
former
and
present
self
was
that
*NL*
formerly
when
he
did
not
grasp
what
lay
before
him
or
was
said
to
him
,
*NL*
he
had
puckered
his
forehead
painfully
as
if
vainly
seeking
to
*NL*
distinguish
something
at
a
distance
.
At
present
he
still
forgot
what
was
*NL*
said
to
him
and
still
did
not
see
what
was
before
his
eyes
,
but
he
now
*NL*
looked
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
and
seemingly
ironic
smile
at
what
*NL*
was
before
him
and
listened
to
what
was
said
,
though
evidently
seeing
*NL*
and
hearing
something
quite
different
.
Formerly
he
had
appeared
to
be
a
*NL*
kindhearted
but
unhappy
man
,
and
so
people
had
been
inclined
to
avoid
*NL*
him
.
Now
a
smile
at
the
joy
of
life
always
played
round
his
lips
,
and
*NL*
sympathy
for
others
,
shone
in
his
eyes
with
a
questioning
look
as
to
*NL*
whether
they
were
as
contented
as
he
was
,
and
people
felt
pleased
by
his
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Previously
he
had
talked
a
great
deal
,
grew
excited
when
he
talked
,
and
*NL*
seldom
listened
;
now
he
was
seldom
carried
away
in
conversation
and
knew
*NL*
how
to
listen
so
that
people
readily
told
him
their
most
intimate
*NL*
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
who
had
never
liked
Pierre
and
had
been
particularly
*NL*
hostile
to
him
since
she
had
felt
herself
under
obligations
to
him
after
*NL*
the
old
count
's
death
,
now
after
staying
a
short
time
in
Orel
--
where
she
*NL*
had
come
intending
to
show
Pierre
that
in
spite
of
his
ingratitude
she
*NL*
considered
it
her
duty
to
nurse
him
--
felt
to
her
surprise
and
vexation
*NL*
that
she
had
become
fond
of
him
.
Pierre
did
not
in
any
way
seek
her
*NL*
approval
,
he
merely
studied
her
with
interest
.
Formerly
she
had
felt
*NL*
that
he
regarded
her
with
indifference
and
irony
,
and
so
had
shrunk
into
*NL*
herself
as
she
did
with
others
and
had
shown
him
only
the
combative
side
*NL*
of
her
nature
;
but
now
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
understand
the
most
*NL*
intimate
places
of
her
heart
,
and
,
mistrustfully
at
first
but
afterwards
*NL*
gratefully
,
she
let
him
see
the
hidden
,
kindly
sides
of
her
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
cunning
man
could
not
have
crept
into
her
confidence
more
*NL*
successfully
,
evoking
memories
of
the
best
times
of
her
youth
and
*NL*
showing
sympathy
with
them
.
Yet
Pierre
's
cunning
consisted
simply
in
*NL*
finding
pleasure
in
drawing
out
the
human
qualities
of
the
embittered
,
*NL*
hard
,
and
-LRB-
in
her
own
way
-RRB-
proud
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
is
a
very
,
very
kind
man
when
he
is
not
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
bad
people
but
of
people
such
as
myself
,
''
thought
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
servants
too
--
Terenty
and
Vaska
--
in
their
own
way
noticed
the
change
*NL*
that
had
taken
place
in
Pierre
.
They
considered
that
he
had
become
much
*NL*
``
simpler
.
''
Terenty
,
when
he
had
helped
him
undress
and
wished
him
good
*NL*
night
,
often
lingered
with
his
master
's
boots
in
his
hands
and
clothes
*NL*
over
his
arm
,
to
see
whether
he
would
not
start
a
talk
.
And
Pierre
,
*NL*
noticing
that
Terenty
wanted
a
chat
,
generally
kept
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
tell
me
...
now
,
how
did
you
get
food
?
''
he
would
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Terenty
would
begin
talking
of
the
destruction
of
Moscow
,
and
of
the
*NL*
old
count
,
and
would
stand
for
a
long
time
holding
the
clothes
and
*NL*
talking
,
or
sometimes
listening
to
Pierre
's
stories
,
and
then
would
go
*NL*
out
into
the
hall
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
intimacy
with
his
master
and
*NL*
affection
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
who
attended
Pierre
and
visited
him
every
day
,
though
he
*NL*
considered
it
his
duty
as
a
doctor
to
pose
as
a
man
whose
every
moment
*NL*
was
of
value
to
suffering
humanity
,
would
sit
for
hours
with
Pierre
*NL*
telling
him
his
favorite
anecdotes
and
his
observations
on
the
*NL*
characters
of
his
patients
in
general
,
and
especially
of
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pleasure
to
talk
to
a
man
like
that
;
he
is
not
like
our
*NL*
provincials
,
''
he
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
several
prisoners
from
the
French
army
in
Orel
,
and
the
*NL*
doctor
brought
one
of
them
,
a
young
Italian
,
to
see
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
officer
began
visiting
Pierre
,
and
the
princess
used
to
make
fun
of
*NL*
the
tenderness
the
Italian
expressed
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Italian
seemed
happy
only
when
he
could
come
to
see
Pierre
,
talk
*NL*
with
him
,
tell
him
about
his
past
,
his
life
at
home
,
and
his
love
,
and
*NL*
pour
out
to
him
his
indignation
against
the
French
and
especially
*NL*
against
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
all
Russians
are
in
the
least
like
you
,
it
is
sacrilege
to
fight
*NL*
such
a
nation
,
''
he
said
to
Pierre
.
``
You
,
who
have
suffered
so
from
the
*NL*
French
,
do
not
even
feel
animosity
toward
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
evoked
the
passionate
affection
of
the
Italian
merely
by
*NL*
evoking
the
best
side
of
his
nature
and
taking
a
pleasure
in
so
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
days
of
Pierre
's
stay
in
Orel
his
old
masonic
*NL*
acquaintance
Count
Willarski
,
who
had
introduced
him
to
the
lodge
in
*NL*
1807
,
came
to
see
him
.
Willarski
was
married
to
a
Russian
heiress
who
*NL*
had
a
large
estate
in
Orel
province
,
and
he
occupied
a
temporary
post
in
*NL*
the
commissariat
department
in
that
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
Bezukhov
was
in
Orel
,
Willarski
,
though
they
had
never
been
*NL*
intimate
,
came
to
him
with
the
professions
of
friendship
and
intimacy
*NL*
that
people
who
meet
in
a
desert
generally
express
for
one
another
.
*NL*
Willarski
felt
dull
in
Orel
and
was
pleased
to
meet
a
man
of
his
own
*NL*
circle
and
,
as
he
supposed
,
of
similar
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
his
surprise
Willarski
soon
noticed
that
Pierre
had
lagged
much
*NL*
behind
the
times
,
and
had
sunk
,
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
,
into
*NL*
apathy
and
egotism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
letting
yourself
go
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
all
that
Willarski
found
it
pleasanter
now
than
it
had
been
*NL*
formerly
to
be
with
Pierre
,
and
came
to
see
him
every
day
.
To
Pierre
as
*NL*
he
looked
at
and
listened
to
Willarski
,
it
seemed
strange
to
think
that
*NL*
he
had
been
like
that
himself
but
a
short
time
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willarski
was
a
married
man
with
a
family
,
busy
with
his
family
affairs
,
*NL*
his
wife
's
affairs
,
and
his
official
duties
.
He
regarded
all
these
*NL*
occupations
as
hindrances
to
life
,
and
considered
that
they
were
all
*NL*
contemptible
because
their
aim
was
the
welfare
of
himself
and
his
*NL*
family
.
Military
,
administrative
,
political
,
and
masonic
interests
*NL*
continually
absorbed
his
attention
.
And
Pierre
,
without
trying
to
change
*NL*
the
other
's
views
and
without
condemning
him
,
but
with
the
quiet
,
*NL*
joyful
,
and
amused
smile
now
habitual
to
him
,
was
interested
in
this
*NL*
strange
though
very
familiar
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
new
feature
in
Pierre
's
relations
with
Willarski
,
with
the
*NL*
princess
,
with
the
doctor
,
and
with
all
the
people
he
now
met
,
which
*NL*
gained
for
him
the
general
good
will
.
This
was
his
acknowledgment
of
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
changing
a
man
's
convictions
by
words
,
and
his
*NL*
recognition
of
the
possibility
of
everyone
thinking
,
feeling
,
and
seeing
*NL*
things
each
from
his
own
point
of
view
.
This
legitimate
peculiarity
of
*NL*
each
individual
which
used
to
excite
and
irritate
Pierre
now
became
a
*NL*
basis
of
the
sympathy
he
felt
for
,
and
the
interest
he
took
in
,
other
*NL*
people
.
The
difference
,
and
sometimes
complete
contradiction
,
between
*NL*
men
's
opinions
and
their
lives
,
and
between
one
man
and
another
,
pleased
*NL*
him
and
drew
from
him
an
amused
and
gentle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
practical
matters
Pierre
unexpectedly
felt
within
himself
a
center
of
*NL*
gravity
he
had
previously
lacked
.
Formerly
all
pecuniary
questions
,
*NL*
especially
requests
for
money
to
which
,
as
an
extremely
wealthy
man
,
he
*NL*
was
very
exposed
,
produced
in
him
a
state
of
hopeless
agitation
and
*NL*
perplexity
.
``
To
give
or
not
to
give
?
''
he
had
asked
himself
.
``
I
have
it
*NL*
and
he
needs
it
.
But
someone
else
needs
it
still
more
.
Who
needs
it
*NL*
most
?
And
perhaps
they
are
both
impostors
?
''
In
the
old
days
he
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
find
a
way
out
of
all
these
surmises
and
had
given
to
all
who
*NL*
asked
as
long
as
he
had
anything
to
give
.
Formerly
he
had
been
in
a
*NL*
similar
state
of
perplexity
with
regard
to
every
question
concerning
his
*NL*
property
,
when
one
person
advised
one
thing
and
another
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
he
no
longer
felt
either
doubt
or
*NL*
perplexity
about
these
questions
.
There
was
now
within
him
a
judge
who
*NL*
by
some
rule
unknown
to
him
decided
what
should
or
should
not
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
as
indifferent
as
heretofore
to
money
matters
,
but
now
he
felt
*NL*
certain
of
what
ought
and
what
ought
not
to
be
done
.
The
first
time
he
*NL*
had
recourse
to
his
new
judge
was
when
a
French
prisoner
,
a
colonel
,
*NL*
came
to
him
and
,
after
talking
a
great
deal
about
his
exploits
,
*NL*
concluded
by
making
what
amounted
to
a
demand
that
Pierre
should
give
*NL*
him
four
thousand
francs
to
send
to
his
wife
and
children
.
Pierre
*NL*
refused
without
the
least
difficulty
or
effort
,
and
was
afterwards
*NL*
surprised
how
simple
and
easy
had
been
what
used
to
appear
so
*NL*
insurmountably
difficult
.
At
the
same
time
that
he
refused
the
colonel
's
*NL*
demand
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
have
recourse
to
artifice
when
*NL*
leaving
Orel
,
to
induce
the
Italian
officer
to
accept
some
money
of
*NL*
which
he
was
evidently
in
need
.
A
further
proof
to
Pierre
of
his
own
*NL*
more
settled
outlook
on
practical
matters
was
furnished
by
his
decision
*NL*
with
regard
to
his
wife
's
debts
and
to
the
rebuilding
of
his
houses
in
*NL*
and
near
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
steward
came
to
him
at
Orel
and
Pierre
reckoned
up
with
him
his
*NL*
diminished
income
.
The
burning
of
Moscow
had
cost
him
,
according
to
the
*NL*
head
steward
's
calculation
,
about
two
million
rubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
console
Pierre
for
these
losses
the
head
steward
gave
him
an
estimate
*NL*
showing
that
despite
these
losses
his
income
would
not
be
diminished
but
*NL*
would
even
be
increased
if
he
refused
to
pay
his
wife
's
debts
which
he
*NL*
was
under
no
obligation
to
meet
,
and
did
not
rebuild
his
Moscow
house
*NL*
and
the
country
house
on
his
Moscow
estate
,
which
had
cost
him
eighty
*NL*
thousand
rubles
a
year
and
brought
in
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
that
's
true
,
''
said
Pierre
with
a
cheerful
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
need
all
that
at
all
.
By
being
ruined
I
have
become
much
richer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
January
Savelich
came
from
Moscow
and
gave
him
an
account
of
the
*NL*
state
of
things
there
,
and
spoke
of
the
estimate
an
architect
had
made
*NL*
of
the
cost
of
rebuilding
the
town
and
country
houses
,
speaking
of
this
*NL*
as
of
a
settled
matter
.
About
the
same
time
he
received
letters
from
*NL*
Prince
Vasili
and
other
Petersburg
acquaintances
speaking
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
debts
.
And
Pierre
decided
that
the
steward
's
proposals
which
had
so
*NL*
pleased
him
were
wrong
and
that
he
must
go
to
Petersburg
and
settle
his
*NL*
wife
's
affairs
and
must
rebuild
in
Moscow
.
Why
this
was
necessary
he
did
*NL*
not
know
,
but
he
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
necessary
.
His
income
*NL*
would
be
reduced
by
three
fourths
,
but
he
felt
it
must
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willarski
was
going
to
Moscow
and
they
agreed
to
travel
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
time
of
his
convalescence
in
Orel
Pierre
had
*NL*
experienced
a
feeling
of
joy
,
freedom
,
and
life
;
but
when
during
his
*NL*
journey
he
found
himself
in
the
open
world
and
saw
hundreds
of
new
*NL*
faces
,
that
feeling
was
intensified
.
Throughout
his
journey
he
felt
like
*NL*
a
schoolboy
on
holiday
.
Everyone
--
the
stagecoach
driver
,
the
post-house
*NL*
overseers
,
the
peasants
on
the
roads
and
in
the
villages
--
had
a
new
*NL*
significance
for
him
.
The
presence
and
remarks
of
Willarski
who
*NL*
continually
deplored
the
ignorance
and
poverty
of
Russia
and
its
*NL*
backwardness
compared
with
Europe
only
heightened
Pierre
's
pleasure
.
*NL*
Where
Willarski
saw
deadness
Pierre
saw
an
extraordinary
strength
and
*NL*
vitality
--
the
strength
which
in
that
vast
space
amid
the
snows
*NL*
maintained
the
life
of
this
original
,
peculiar
,
and
unique
people
.
He
*NL*
did
not
contradict
Willarski
and
even
seemed
to
agree
with
him
--
an
*NL*
apparent
agreement
being
the
simplest
way
to
avoid
discussions
that
*NL*
could
lead
to
nothing
--
and
he
smiled
joyfully
as
he
listened
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
difficult
to
explain
why
and
whither
ants
whose
heap
has
*NL*
been
destroyed
are
hurrying
:
some
from
the
heap
dragging
bits
of
*NL*
rubbish
,
larvae
,
and
corpses
,
others
back
to
the
heap
,
or
why
they
*NL*
jostle
,
overtake
one
another
,
and
fight
,
and
it
would
be
equally
*NL*
difficult
to
explain
what
caused
the
Russians
after
the
departure
of
the
*NL*
French
to
throng
to
the
place
that
had
formerly
been
Moscow
.
But
when
we
*NL*
watch
the
ants
round
their
ruined
heap
,
the
tenacity
,
energy
,
and
*NL*
immense
number
of
the
delving
insects
prove
that
despite
the
destruction
*NL*
of
the
heap
,
something
indestructible
,
which
though
intangible
is
the
*NL*
real
strength
of
the
colony
,
still
exists
;
and
similarly
,
though
in
*NL*
Moscow
in
the
month
of
October
there
was
no
government
and
no
churches
,
*NL*
shrines
,
riches
,
or
houses
--
it
was
still
the
Moscow
it
had
been
in
*NL*
August
.
All
was
destroyed
,
except
something
intangible
yet
powerful
and
*NL*
indestructible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
motives
of
those
who
thronged
from
all
sides
to
Moscow
after
it
had
*NL*
been
cleared
of
the
enemy
were
most
diverse
and
personal
,
and
at
first
*NL*
for
the
most
part
savage
and
brutal
.
One
motive
only
they
all
had
in
*NL*
common
:
a
desire
to
get
to
the
place
that
had
been
called
Moscow
,
to
*NL*
apply
their
activities
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
week
Moscow
already
had
fifteen
thousand
inhabitants
,
in
a
*NL*
fortnight
twenty-five
thousand
,
and
so
on
.
By
the
autumn
of
1813
the
*NL*
number
,
ever
increasing
and
increasing
,
exceeded
what
it
had
been
in
*NL*
1812
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
Russians
to
enter
Moscow
were
the
Cossacks
of
Wintzingerode
's
*NL*
detachment
,
peasants
from
the
adjacent
villages
,
and
residents
who
had
*NL*
fled
from
Moscow
and
had
been
hiding
in
its
vicinity
.
The
Russians
who
*NL*
entered
Moscow
,
finding
it
plundered
,
plundered
it
in
their
turn
.
They
*NL*
continued
what
the
French
had
begun
.
Trains
of
peasant
carts
came
to
*NL*
Moscow
to
carry
off
to
the
villages
what
had
been
abandoned
in
the
*NL*
ruined
houses
and
the
streets
.
The
Cossacks
carried
off
what
they
could
*NL*
to
their
camps
,
and
the
householders
seized
all
they
could
find
in
other
*NL*
houses
and
moved
it
to
their
own
,
pretending
that
it
was
their
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
first
plunderers
were
followed
by
a
second
and
a
third
*NL*
contingent
,
and
with
increasing
numbers
plundering
became
more
and
more
*NL*
difficult
and
assumed
more
definite
forms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
found
Moscow
abandoned
but
with
all
the
organizations
of
*NL*
regular
life
,
with
diverse
branches
of
commerce
and
craftsmanship
,
with
*NL*
luxury
,
and
governmental
and
religious
institutions
.
These
forms
were
*NL*
lifeless
but
still
existed
.
There
were
bazaars
,
shops
,
warehouses
,
*NL*
market
stalls
,
granaries
--
for
the
most
part
still
stocked
with
goods
--
*NL*
and
there
were
factories
and
workshops
,
palaces
and
wealthy
houses
*NL*
filled
with
luxuries
,
hospitals
,
prisons
,
government
offices
,
churches
,
*NL*
and
cathedrals
.
The
longer
the
French
remained
the
more
these
forms
of
*NL*
town
life
perished
,
until
finally
all
was
merged
into
one
confused
,
*NL*
lifeless
scene
of
plunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
the
plundering
by
the
French
continued
,
the
more
both
the
*NL*
wealth
of
Moscow
and
the
strength
of
its
plunderers
was
destroyed
.
But
*NL*
plundering
by
the
Russians
,
with
which
the
reoccupation
of
the
city
*NL*
began
,
had
an
opposite
effect
:
the
longer
it
continued
and
the
greater
*NL*
the
number
of
people
taking
part
in
it
the
more
rapidly
was
the
wealth
*NL*
of
the
city
and
its
regular
life
restored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
plunderers
,
very
various
people
,
some
drawn
by
curiosity
,
*NL*
some
by
official
duties
,
some
by
self-interest
--
house
owners
,
clergy
,
*NL*
officials
of
all
kinds
,
tradesmen
,
artisans
,
and
peasants
--
streamed
into
*NL*
Moscow
as
blood
flows
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
week
the
peasants
who
came
with
empty
carts
to
carry
off
*NL*
plunder
were
stopped
by
the
authorities
and
made
to
cart
the
corpses
out
*NL*
of
the
town
.
Other
peasants
,
having
heard
of
their
comrades
'
*NL*
discomfiture
,
came
to
town
bringing
rye
,
oats
,
and
hay
,
and
beat
down
*NL*
one
another
's
prices
to
below
what
they
had
been
in
former
days
.
Gangs
*NL*
of
carpenters
hoping
for
high
pay
arrived
in
Moscow
every
day
,
and
on
*NL*
all
sides
logs
were
being
hewn
,
new
houses
built
,
and
old
,
charred
ones
*NL*
repaired
.
Tradesmen
began
trading
in
booths
.
Cookshops
and
taverns
were
*NL*
opened
in
partially
burned
houses
.
The
clergy
resumed
the
services
in
*NL*
many
churches
that
had
not
been
burned
.
Donors
contributed
Church
*NL*
property
that
had
been
stolen
.
Government
clerks
set
up
their
baize
-
*NL*
covered
tables
and
their
pigeonholes
of
documents
in
small
rooms
.
The
*NL*
higher
authorities
and
the
police
organized
the
distribution
of
goods
*NL*
left
behind
by
the
French
.
The
owners
of
houses
in
which
much
property
*NL*
had
been
left
,
brought
there
from
other
houses
,
complained
of
the
*NL*
injustice
of
taking
everything
to
the
Faceted
Palace
in
the
Kremlin
;
*NL*
others
insisted
that
as
the
French
had
gathered
things
from
different
*NL*
houses
into
this
or
that
house
,
it
would
be
unfair
to
allow
its
owner
to
*NL*
keep
all
that
was
found
there
.
They
abused
the
police
and
bribed
them
,
*NL*
made
out
estimates
at
ten
times
their
value
for
government
stores
that
*NL*
had
perished
in
the
fire
,
and
demanded
relief
.
And
Count
Rostopchin
*NL*
wrote
proclamations
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
January
Pierre
went
to
Moscow
and
stayed
in
an
annex
of
*NL*
his
house
which
had
not
been
burned
.
He
called
on
Count
Rostopchin
and
*NL*
on
some
acquaintances
who
were
back
in
Moscow
,
and
he
intended
to
leave
*NL*
for
Petersburg
two
days
later
.
Everybody
was
celebrating
the
victory
,
*NL*
everything
was
bubbling
with
life
in
the
ruined
but
reviving
city
.
*NL*
Everyone
was
pleased
to
see
Pierre
,
everyone
wished
to
meet
him
,
and
*NL*
everyone
questioned
him
about
what
he
had
seen
.
Pierre
felt
particularly
*NL*
well
disposed
toward
them
all
,
but
was
now
instinctively
on
his
guard
*NL*
for
fear
of
binding
himself
in
any
way
.
To
all
questions
put
to
him
--
*NL*
whether
important
or
quite
trifling
--
such
as
:
Where
would
he
live
?
Was
*NL*
he
going
to
rebuild
?
When
was
he
going
to
Petersburg
and
would
he
mind
*NL*
taking
a
parcel
for
someone
?
--
he
replied
:
``
Yes
,
perhaps
,
''
or
,
``
I
think
*NL*
so
,
''
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
that
the
Rostovs
were
at
Kostroma
but
the
thought
of
*NL*
Natasha
seldom
occurred
to
him
.
If
it
did
it
was
only
as
a
pleasant
*NL*
memory
of
the
distant
past
.
He
felt
himself
not
only
free
from
social
*NL*
obligations
but
also
from
that
feeling
which
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
he
had
*NL*
aroused
in
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
he
heard
from
the
Drubetskoys
that
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
in
Moscow
.
The
death
,
sufferings
,
and
last
days
of
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
had
often
occupied
Pierre
's
thoughts
and
now
recurred
to
*NL*
him
with
fresh
vividness
.
Having
heard
at
dinner
that
Princess
Mary
was
*NL*
in
Moscow
and
living
in
her
house
--
which
had
not
been
burned
--
in
*NL*
Vozdvizhenka
Street
,
he
drove
that
same
evening
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
to
the
house
Pierre
kept
thinking
of
Prince
Andrew
,
of
their
*NL*
friendship
,
of
his
various
meetings
with
him
,
and
especially
of
the
last
*NL*
one
at
Borodino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
he
died
in
the
bitter
frame
of
mind
he
was
then
in
?
*NL*
Is
it
possible
that
the
meaning
of
life
was
not
disclosed
to
him
before
*NL*
he
died
?
''
thought
Pierre
.
He
recalled
Karataev
and
his
death
and
*NL*
involuntarily
began
to
compare
these
two
men
,
so
different
,
and
yet
so
*NL*
similar
in
that
they
had
both
lived
and
both
died
and
in
the
love
he
*NL*
felt
for
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
drove
up
to
the
house
of
the
old
prince
in
a
most
serious
mood
.
*NL*
The
house
had
escaped
the
fire
;
it
showed
signs
of
damage
but
its
*NL*
general
aspect
was
unchanged
.
The
old
footman
,
who
met
Pierre
with
a
*NL*
stern
face
as
if
wishing
to
make
the
visitor
feel
that
the
absence
of
*NL*
the
old
prince
had
not
disturbed
the
order
of
things
in
the
house
,
*NL*
informed
him
that
the
princess
had
gone
to
her
own
apartments
,
and
that
*NL*
she
received
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Announce
me
.
Perhaps
she
will
see
me
,
''
said
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
Please
step
into
the
portrait
gallery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
the
footman
returned
with
Dessalles
,
who
brought
*NL*
word
from
the
princess
that
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
Pierre
if
he
*NL*
would
excuse
her
want
of
ceremony
and
come
upstairs
to
her
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
rather
low
room
lit
by
one
candle
sat
the
princess
and
with
her
*NL*
another
person
dressed
in
black
.
Pierre
remembered
that
the
princess
*NL*
always
had
lady
companions
,
but
who
they
were
and
what
they
were
like
he
*NL*
never
knew
or
remembered
.
``
This
must
be
one
of
her
companions
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
glancing
at
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
rose
quickly
to
meet
him
and
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
his
altered
face
after
he
had
kissed
her
*NL*
hand
,
``
so
this
is
how
we
meet
again
.
He
spoke
of
you
even
at
the
very
*NL*
last
,
''
she
went
on
,
turning
her
eyes
from
Pierre
to
her
companion
with
a
*NL*
shyness
that
surprised
him
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
glad
to
hear
of
your
safety
.
It
was
the
first
piece
of
good
*NL*
news
we
had
received
for
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
princess
glanced
round
at
her
companion
with
even
more
*NL*
uneasiness
in
her
manner
and
was
about
to
add
something
,
but
Pierre
*NL*
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
imagine
--
I
knew
nothing
about
him
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
thought
he
had
*NL*
been
killed
.
All
I
know
I
heard
at
second
hand
from
others
.
I
only
know
*NL*
that
he
fell
in
with
the
Rostovs
...
What
a
strange
coincidence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
spoke
rapidly
and
with
animation
.
He
glanced
once
at
the
*NL*
companion
's
face
,
saw
her
attentive
and
kindly
gaze
fixed
on
him
,
and
,
*NL*
as
often
happens
when
one
is
talking
,
felt
somehow
that
this
companion
*NL*
in
the
black
dress
was
a
good
,
kind
,
excellent
creature
who
would
not
*NL*
hinder
his
conversing
freely
with
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
mentioned
the
Rostovs
,
Princess
Mary
's
face
expressed
still
*NL*
greater
embarrassment
.
She
again
glanced
rapidly
from
Pierre
's
face
to
*NL*
that
of
the
lady
in
the
black
dress
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
not
recognize
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
again
at
the
companion
's
pale
,
delicate
face
with
its
*NL*
black
eyes
and
peculiar
mouth
,
and
something
near
to
him
,
long
forgotten
*NL*
and
more
than
sweet
,
looked
at
him
from
those
attentive
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
''
he
thought
.
``
This
stern
,
thin
,
pale
face
that
*NL*
looks
so
much
older
!
It
can
not
be
she
.
It
merely
reminds
me
of
her
.
''
But
*NL*
at
that
moment
Princess
Mary
said
,
``
Natasha
!
''
And
with
difficulty
,
*NL*
effort
,
and
stress
,
like
the
opening
of
a
door
grown
rusty
on
its
*NL*
hinges
,
a
smile
appeared
on
the
face
with
the
attentive
eyes
,
and
from
*NL*
that
opening
door
came
a
breath
of
fragrance
which
suffused
Pierre
with
*NL*
a
happiness
he
had
long
forgotten
and
of
which
he
had
not
even
been
*NL*
thinking
--
especially
at
that
moment
.
It
suffused
him
,
seized
him
,
and
*NL*
enveloped
him
completely
.
When
she
smiled
doubt
was
no
longer
possible
,
*NL*
it
was
Natasha
and
he
loved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Pierre
involuntarily
betrayed
to
her
,
to
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
and
above
all
to
himself
,
a
secret
of
which
he
himself
had
been
unaware
.
*NL*
He
flushed
joyfully
yet
with
painful
distress
.
He
tried
to
hide
his
*NL*
agitation
.
But
the
more
he
tried
to
hide
it
the
more
clearly
--
clearer
*NL*
than
any
words
could
have
done
--
did
he
betray
to
himself
,
to
her
,
and
to
*NL*
Princess
Mary
that
he
loved
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
only
the
unexpectedness
of
it
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
But
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
tried
to
continue
the
conversation
he
had
begun
with
Princess
Mary
he
*NL*
again
glanced
at
Natasha
,
and
a
still-deeper
flush
suffused
his
face
and
*NL*
a
still-stronger
agitation
of
mingled
joy
and
fear
seized
his
soul
.
He
*NL*
became
confused
in
his
speech
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
had
failed
to
notice
Natasha
because
he
did
not
at
all
expect
to
*NL*
see
her
there
,
but
he
had
failed
to
recognize
her
because
the
change
in
*NL*
her
since
he
last
saw
her
was
immense
.
She
had
grown
thin
and
pale
,
but
*NL*
that
was
not
what
made
her
unrecognizable
;
she
was
unrecognizable
at
the
*NL*
moment
he
entered
because
on
that
face
whose
eyes
had
always
shone
with
*NL*
a
suppressed
smile
of
the
joy
of
life
,
now
when
he
first
entered
and
*NL*
glanced
at
her
there
was
not
the
least
shadow
of
a
smile
:
only
her
eyes
*NL*
were
kindly
attentive
and
sadly
interrogative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
confusion
was
not
reflected
by
any
confusion
on
Natasha
's
part
,
*NL*
but
only
by
the
pleasure
that
just
perceptibly
lit
up
her
whole
face
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
come
to
stay
with
me
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
The
count
and
*NL*
countess
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
.
The
countess
is
in
a
dreadful
*NL*
state
;
but
it
was
necessary
for
Natasha
herself
to
see
a
doctor
.
They
*NL*
insisted
on
her
coming
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
is
there
a
family
free
from
sorrow
now
?
''
said
Pierre
,
addressing
*NL*
Natasha
.
``
You
know
it
happened
the
very
day
we
were
rescued
.
I
saw
him
.
*NL*
What
a
delightful
boy
he
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
at
him
,
and
by
way
of
answer
to
his
words
her
eyes
*NL*
widened
and
lit
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
one
say
or
think
of
as
a
consolation
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Nothing
!
*NL*
Why
had
such
a
splendid
boy
,
so
full
of
life
,
to
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
these
days
it
would
be
hard
to
live
without
faith
...
''
remarked
*NL*
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
is
really
true
,
''
Pierre
hastily
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
true
?
''
Natasha
asked
,
looking
attentively
into
Pierre
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
ask
why
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
The
thought
alone
of
what
*NL*
awaits
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
without
waiting
for
Princess
Mary
to
finish
again
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
because
,
''
Pierre
continued
,
``
only
one
who
believes
that
there
is
a
*NL*
God
ruling
us
can
bear
a
loss
such
as
hers
and
...
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
had
already
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
suddenly
stopped
.
*NL*
Pierre
hurriedly
turned
away
from
her
and
again
addressed
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
asking
about
his
friend
's
last
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
confusion
had
now
almost
vanished
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
*NL*
that
his
freedom
had
also
completely
gone
.
He
felt
that
there
was
now
a
*NL*
judge
of
his
every
word
and
action
whose
judgment
mattered
more
to
him
*NL*
than
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
As
he
spoke
now
he
was
*NL*
considering
what
impression
his
words
would
make
on
Natasha
.
He
did
not
*NL*
purposely
say
things
to
please
her
,
but
whatever
he
was
saying
he
*NL*
regarded
from
her
standpoint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
--
reluctantly
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
--
began
telling
of
*NL*
the
condition
in
which
she
had
found
Prince
Andrew
.
But
Pierre
's
face
*NL*
quivering
with
emotion
,
his
questions
and
his
eager
restless
expression
,
*NL*
gradually
compelled
her
to
go
into
details
which
she
feared
to
recall
*NL*
for
her
own
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
and
so
...
?
''
Pierre
kept
saying
as
he
leaned
toward
her
with
*NL*
his
whole
body
and
eagerly
listened
to
her
story
.
``
Yes
,
yes
...
so
he
*NL*
grew
tranquil
and
softened
?
With
all
his
soul
he
had
always
sought
one
*NL*
thing
--
to
be
perfectly
good
--
so
he
could
not
be
afraid
of
death
.
The
*NL*
faults
he
had
--
if
he
had
any
--
were
not
of
his
making
.
So
he
did
*NL*
soften
?
...
What
a
happy
thing
that
he
saw
you
again
,
''
he
added
,
suddenly
*NL*
turning
to
Natasha
and
looking
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
face
twitched
.
She
frowned
and
lowered
her
eyes
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
She
hesitated
for
an
instant
whether
to
speak
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
was
happiness
,
''
she
then
said
in
her
quiet
voice
with
its
*NL*
deep
chest
notes
.
``
For
me
it
certainly
was
happiness
.
''
She
paused
.
``
And
*NL*
he
...
he
...
he
said
he
was
wishing
for
it
at
the
very
moment
I
entered
*NL*
the
room
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
voice
broke
.
She
blushed
,
pressed
her
clasped
hands
on
her
*NL*
knees
,
and
then
controlling
herself
with
an
evident
effort
lifted
her
*NL*
head
and
began
to
speak
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
knew
nothing
of
it
when
we
started
from
Moscow
.
I
did
not
dare
to
*NL*
ask
about
him
.
Then
suddenly
Sonya
told
me
he
was
traveling
with
us
.
I
*NL*
had
no
idea
and
could
not
imagine
what
state
he
was
in
,
all
I
wanted
was
*NL*
to
see
him
and
be
with
him
,
''
she
said
,
trembling
,
and
breathing
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
letting
them
interrupt
her
she
went
on
to
tell
what
she
had
*NL*
never
yet
mentioned
to
anyone
--
all
she
had
lived
through
during
those
*NL*
three
weeks
of
their
journey
and
life
at
Yaroslavl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
listened
to
her
with
lips
parted
and
eyes
fixed
upon
her
full
of
*NL*
tears
.
As
he
listened
he
did
not
think
of
Prince
Andrew
,
nor
of
death
,
*NL*
nor
of
what
she
was
telling
.
He
listened
to
her
and
felt
only
pity
for
*NL*
her
,
for
what
she
was
suffering
now
while
she
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
frowning
in
her
effort
to
hold
back
her
tears
,
sat
beside
*NL*
Natasha
,
and
heard
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
those
last
days
of
*NL*
her
brother
's
and
Natasha
's
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Natasha
needed
to
tell
that
painful
yet
joyful
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
,
mingling
most
trifling
details
with
the
intimate
secrets
of
*NL*
her
soul
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
never
finish
.
Several
times
she
*NL*
repeated
the
same
thing
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dessalles
'
voice
was
heard
outside
the
door
asking
whether
little
*NL*
Nicholas
might
come
in
to
say
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
--
everything
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
up
quickly
just
as
Nicholas
entered
,
almost
ran
to
the
door
*NL*
which
was
hidden
by
curtains
,
struck
her
head
against
it
,
and
rushed
*NL*
from
the
room
with
a
moan
either
of
pain
or
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
gazed
at
the
door
through
which
she
had
disappeared
and
did
not
*NL*
understand
why
he
suddenly
felt
all
alone
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
roused
him
from
his
abstraction
by
drawing
his
attention
*NL*
to
her
nephew
who
had
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
of
emotional
tenderness
young
Nicholas
'
face
,
which
*NL*
resembled
his
father
's
,
affected
Pierre
so
much
that
when
he
had
kissed
*NL*
the
boy
he
got
up
quickly
,
took
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
went
to
the
*NL*
window
.
He
wished
to
take
leave
of
Princess
Mary
,
but
she
would
not
let
*NL*
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Natasha
and
I
sometimes
do
n't
go
to
sleep
till
after
two
,
so
please
*NL*
do
n't
go
.
I
will
order
supper
.
Go
downstairs
,
we
will
come
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Pierre
left
the
room
Princess
Mary
told
him
:
``
This
is
the
first
*NL*
time
she
has
talked
of
him
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
shown
into
the
large
,
brightly
lit
dining
room
;
a
few
minutes
*NL*
later
he
heard
footsteps
and
Princess
Mary
entered
with
Natasha
.
Natasha
*NL*
was
calm
,
though
a
severe
and
grave
expression
had
again
settled
on
her
*NL*
face
.
They
all
three
of
them
now
experienced
that
feeling
of
awkwardness
*NL*
which
usually
follows
after
a
serious
and
heartfelt
talk
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
to
go
back
to
the
same
conversation
,
to
talk
of
trifles
is
*NL*
awkward
,
and
yet
the
desire
to
speak
is
there
and
silence
seems
like
*NL*
affectation
.
They
went
silently
to
table
.
The
footmen
drew
back
the
*NL*
chairs
and
pushed
them
up
again
.
Pierre
unfolded
his
cold
table
napkin
*NL*
and
,
resolving
to
break
the
silence
,
looked
at
Natasha
and
at
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
They
had
evidently
both
formed
the
same
resolution
;
the
eyes
of
*NL*
both
shone
with
satisfaction
and
a
confession
that
besides
sorrow
life
*NL*
also
has
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
take
vodka
,
Count
?
''
asked
Princess
Mary
,
and
those
words
*NL*
suddenly
banished
the
shadows
of
the
past
.
``
Now
tell
us
about
yourself
,
''
*NL*
said
she
.
``
One
hears
such
improbable
wonders
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Pierre
with
the
smile
of
mild
irony
now
habitual
to
him
.
*NL*
``
They
even
tell
me
wonders
I
myself
never
dreamed
of
!
Mary
Abramovna
*NL*
invited
me
to
her
house
and
kept
telling
me
what
had
happened
,
or
ought
*NL*
to
have
happened
,
to
me
.
Stepan
Stepanych
also
instructed
me
how
I
ought
*NL*
to
tell
of
my
experiences
.
In
general
I
have
noticed
that
it
is
very
*NL*
easy
to
be
an
interesting
man
-LRB-
I
am
an
interesting
man
now
-RRB-
;
people
*NL*
invite
me
out
and
tell
me
all
about
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
smiled
and
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
told
,
''
Princess
Mary
interrupted
her
,
``
that
you
lost
two
*NL*
millions
in
Moscow
.
Is
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
three
times
as
rich
as
before
,
''
returned
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
position
was
now
altered
by
his
decision
to
pay
his
wife
's
*NL*
debts
and
to
rebuild
his
houses
,
Pierre
still
maintained
that
he
had
*NL*
become
three
times
as
rich
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
have
certainly
gained
is
freedom
,
''
he
began
seriously
,
but
did
*NL*
not
continue
,
noticing
that
this
theme
was
too
egotistic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
building
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Savelich
says
I
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
you
did
not
know
of
the
countess
'
death
when
you
decided
to
*NL*
remain
in
Moscow
?
''
asked
Princess
Mary
and
immediately
blushed
,
noticing
*NL*
that
her
question
,
following
his
mention
of
freedom
,
ascribed
to
his
*NL*
words
a
meaning
he
had
perhaps
not
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Pierre
,
evidently
not
considering
awkward
the
meaning
*NL*
Princess
Mary
had
given
to
his
words
.
``
I
heard
of
it
in
Orel
and
you
*NL*
can
not
imagine
how
it
shocked
me
.
We
were
not
an
exemplary
couple
,
''
he
*NL*
added
quickly
,
glancing
at
Natasha
and
noticing
on
her
face
curiosity
as
*NL*
to
how
he
would
speak
of
his
wife
,
``
but
her
death
shocked
me
terribly
.
*NL*
When
two
people
quarrel
they
are
always
both
in
fault
,
and
one
's
own
*NL*
guilt
suddenly
becomes
terribly
serious
when
the
other
is
no
longer
*NL*
alive
.
And
then
such
a
death
...
without
friends
and
without
consolation
!
*NL*
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
for
her
,
''
he
concluded
,
and
was
pleased
to
notice
*NL*
a
look
of
glad
approval
on
Natasha
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
so
you
are
once
more
an
eligible
bachelor
,
''
said
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
suddenly
flushed
crimson
and
for
a
long
time
tried
not
to
look
at
*NL*
Natasha
.
When
he
ventured
to
glance
her
way
again
her
face
was
cold
,
*NL*
stern
,
and
he
fancied
even
contemptuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
really
see
and
speak
to
Napoleon
,
as
we
have
been
told
?
''
*NL*
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
once
!
Everybody
seems
to
imagine
that
being
taken
prisoner
*NL*
means
being
Napoleon
's
guest
.
Not
only
did
I
never
see
him
but
I
heard
*NL*
nothing
about
him
--
I
was
in
much
lower
company
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
was
over
,
and
Pierre
who
at
first
declined
to
speak
about
his
*NL*
captivity
was
gradually
led
on
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
true
that
you
remained
in
Moscow
to
kill
Napoleon
?
''
Natasha
*NL*
asked
with
a
slight
smile
.
``
I
guessed
it
then
when
we
met
at
the
*NL*
Sukharev
tower
,
do
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
admitted
that
it
was
true
,
and
from
that
was
gradually
led
by
*NL*
Princess
Mary
's
questions
and
especially
by
Natasha
's
into
giving
a
*NL*
detailed
account
of
his
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
spoke
with
the
amused
and
mild
irony
now
customary
with
him
*NL*
toward
everybody
and
especially
toward
himself
,
but
when
he
came
to
*NL*
describe
the
horrors
and
sufferings
he
had
witnessed
he
was
*NL*
unconsciously
carried
away
and
began
speaking
with
the
suppressed
*NL*
emotion
of
a
man
re-experiencing
in
recollection
strong
impressions
he
*NL*
has
lived
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
with
a
gentle
smile
looked
now
at
Pierre
and
now
at
*NL*
Natasha
.
In
the
whole
narrative
she
saw
only
Pierre
and
his
goodness
.
*NL*
Natasha
,
leaning
on
her
elbow
,
the
expression
of
her
face
constantly
*NL*
changing
with
the
narrative
,
watched
Pierre
with
an
attention
that
never
*NL*
wandered
--
evidently
herself
experiencing
all
that
he
described
.
Not
only
*NL*
her
look
,
but
her
exclamations
and
the
brief
questions
she
put
,
showed
*NL*
Pierre
that
she
understood
just
what
he
wished
to
convey
.
It
was
clear
*NL*
that
she
understood
not
only
what
he
said
but
also
what
he
wished
to
,
*NL*
but
could
not
,
express
in
words
.
The
account
Pierre
gave
of
the
incident
*NL*
with
the
child
and
the
woman
for
protecting
whom
he
was
arrested
was
*NL*
this
:
``
It
was
an
awful
sight
--
children
abandoned
,
some
in
the
flames
...
*NL*
One
was
snatched
out
before
my
eyes
...
and
there
were
women
who
had
*NL*
their
things
snatched
off
and
their
earrings
torn
out
...
''
he
flushed
and
*NL*
grew
confused
.
``
Then
a
patrol
arrived
and
all
the
men
--
all
those
who
*NL*
were
not
looting
,
that
is
--
were
arrested
,
and
I
among
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
're
not
telling
us
everything
;
I
am
sure
you
did
*NL*
something
...
''
said
Natasha
and
pausing
added
,
``
something
fine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
continued
.
When
he
spoke
of
the
execution
he
wanted
to
pass
over
*NL*
the
horrible
details
,
but
Natasha
insisted
that
he
should
not
omit
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
began
to
tell
about
Karataev
,
but
paused
.
By
this
time
he
had
*NL*
risen
from
the
table
and
was
pacing
the
room
,
Natasha
following
him
with
*NL*
her
eyes
.
Then
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
ca
n't
understand
what
I
learned
from
that
illiterate
man
--
that
*NL*
simple
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
go
on
!
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
killed
him
almost
before
my
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Pierre
,
his
voice
trembling
continually
,
went
on
to
tell
of
the
last
*NL*
days
of
their
retreat
,
of
Karataev
's
illness
and
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
of
his
adventures
as
he
had
never
yet
recalled
them
.
He
now
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
saw
a
new
meaning
in
all
he
had
gone
through
.
Now
that
he
was
*NL*
telling
it
all
to
Natasha
he
experienced
that
pleasure
which
a
man
has
*NL*
when
women
listen
to
him
--
not
clever
women
who
when
listening
either
try
*NL*
to
remember
what
they
hear
to
enrich
their
minds
and
when
opportunity
*NL*
offers
to
retell
it
,
or
who
wish
to
adopt
it
to
some
thought
of
their
*NL*
own
and
promptly
contribute
their
own
clever
comments
prepared
in
their
*NL*
little
mental
workshop
--
but
the
pleasure
given
by
real
women
gifted
with
*NL*
a
capacity
to
select
and
absorb
the
very
best
a
man
shows
of
himself
.
*NL*
Natasha
without
knowing
it
was
all
attention
:
she
did
not
lose
a
word
,
*NL*
no
single
quiver
in
Pierre
's
voice
,
no
look
,
no
twitch
of
a
muscle
in
*NL*
his
face
,
nor
a
single
gesture
.
She
caught
the
unfinished
word
in
its
*NL*
flight
and
took
it
straight
into
her
open
heart
,
divining
the
secret
*NL*
meaning
of
all
Pierre
's
mental
travail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
understood
his
story
and
sympathized
with
him
,
but
she
now
*NL*
saw
something
else
that
absorbed
all
her
attention
.
She
saw
the
*NL*
possibility
of
love
and
happiness
between
Natasha
and
Pierre
,
and
the
*NL*
first
thought
of
this
filled
her
heart
with
gladness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
footmen
came
in
with
sad
and
*NL*
stern
faces
to
change
the
candles
,
but
no
one
noticed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
finished
his
story
.
Natasha
continued
to
look
at
him
intently
*NL*
with
bright
,
attentive
,
and
animated
eyes
,
as
if
trying
to
understand
*NL*
something
more
which
he
had
perhaps
left
untold
.
Pierre
in
shamefaced
*NL*
and
happy
confusion
glanced
occasionally
at
her
,
and
tried
to
think
what
*NL*
to
say
next
to
introduce
a
fresh
subject
.
Princess
Mary
was
silent
.
It
*NL*
occurred
to
none
of
them
that
it
was
three
o'clock
and
time
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
speak
of
misfortunes
and
sufferings
,
''
remarked
Pierre
,
``
but
if
*NL*
at
this
moment
I
were
asked
:
`
Would
you
rather
be
what
you
were
before
*NL*
you
were
taken
prisoner
,
or
go
through
all
this
again
?
'
then
for
*NL*
heaven
's
sake
let
me
again
have
captivity
and
horseflesh
!
We
imagine
*NL*
that
when
we
are
thrown
out
of
our
usual
ruts
all
is
lost
,
but
it
is
*NL*
only
then
that
what
is
new
and
good
begins
.
While
there
is
life
there
is
*NL*
happiness
.
There
is
much
,
much
before
us
.
I
say
this
to
you
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
turning
to
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
she
said
,
answering
something
quite
different
.
``
I
too
should
*NL*
wish
nothing
but
to
relive
it
all
from
the
beginning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
looked
intently
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
nothing
more
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
true
,
not
true
!
''
cried
Pierre
.
``
I
am
not
to
blame
for
being
*NL*
alive
and
wishing
to
live
--
nor
you
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Natasha
bent
her
head
,
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Natasha
?
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
.
''
She
smiled
at
Pierre
through
her
tears
.
``
Good
night
!
*NL*
It
is
time
for
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
rose
and
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
met
as
usual
in
the
bedroom
.
They
talked
of
*NL*
what
Pierre
had
told
them
.
Princess
Mary
did
not
express
her
opinion
of
*NL*
Pierre
nor
did
Natasha
speak
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
night
,
Mary
!
''
said
Natasha
.
``
Do
you
know
,
I
am
often
afraid
*NL*
that
by
not
speaking
of
him
''
-LRB-
she
meant
Prince
Andrew
-RRB-
``
for
fear
of
not
*NL*
doing
justice
to
our
feelings
,
we
forget
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
sighed
deeply
and
thereby
acknowledged
the
justice
of
*NL*
Natasha
's
remark
,
but
she
did
not
express
agreement
in
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
to
forget
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
me
so
much
good
to
tell
all
about
it
today
.
It
was
hard
and
*NL*
painful
,
but
good
,
very
good
!
''
said
Natasha
.
``
I
am
sure
he
really
loved
*NL*
him
.
That
is
why
I
told
him
...
Was
it
all
right
?
''
she
added
,
suddenly
*NL*
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
tell
Pierre
?
Oh
,
yes
.
What
a
splendid
man
he
is
!
''
said
Princess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Mary
...
''
Natasha
suddenly
said
with
a
mischievous
smile
*NL*
such
as
Princess
Mary
had
not
seen
on
her
face
for
a
long
time
,
``
he
has
*NL*
somehow
grown
so
clean
,
smooth
,
and
fresh
--
as
if
he
had
just
come
out
of
*NL*
a
Russian
bath
;
do
you
understand
?
Out
of
a
moral
bath
.
Is
n't
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Princess
Mary
.
``
He
has
greatly
improved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
short
coat
and
his
hair
cropped
;
just
as
if
,
well
,
just
as
if
he
*NL*
had
come
straight
from
the
bath
...
Papa
used
to
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
why
he
''
-LRB-
Prince
Andrew
-RRB-
``
liked
no
one
so
much
as
him
,
''
*NL*
said
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
yet
he
is
quite
different
.
They
say
men
are
friends
when
they
*NL*
are
quite
different
.
That
must
be
true
.
Really
he
is
quite
unlike
him
--
*NL*
in
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
's
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
night
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
same
mischievous
smile
lingered
for
a
long
time
on
her
face
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
forgotten
there
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
Pierre
could
fall
asleep
that
night
.
He
paced
*NL*
up
and
down
his
room
,
now
turning
his
thoughts
on
a
difficult
problem
*NL*
and
frowning
,
now
suddenly
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
wincing
,
and
now
*NL*
smiling
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
of
Prince
Andrew
,
of
Natasha
,
and
of
their
love
,
at
one
*NL*
moment
jealous
of
her
past
,
then
reproaching
himself
for
that
feeling
.
*NL*
It
was
already
six
in
the
morning
and
he
still
paced
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
's
to
be
done
if
it
can
not
be
avoided
?
What
's
to
be
done
?
*NL*
Evidently
it
has
to
be
so
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
and
hastily
undressing
*NL*
he
got
into
bed
,
happy
and
agitated
but
free
from
hesitation
or
*NL*
indecision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
and
impossible
as
such
happiness
seems
,
I
must
do
everything
*NL*
that
she
and
I
may
be
man
and
wife
,
''
he
told
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
previously
Pierre
had
decided
to
go
to
Petersburg
on
the
*NL*
Friday
.
When
he
awoke
on
the
Thursday
,
Savelich
came
to
ask
him
about
*NL*
packing
for
the
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
to
Petersburg
?
What
is
Petersburg
?
Who
is
there
in
Petersburg
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
involuntarily
,
though
only
to
himself
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
long
ago
*NL*
before
this
happened
I
did
for
some
reason
mean
to
go
to
Petersburg
,
''
he
*NL*
reflected
.
``
Why
?
But
perhaps
I
shall
go
.
What
a
good
fellow
he
is
and
*NL*
how
attentive
,
and
how
he
remembers
everything
,
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
*NL*
Savelich
's
old
face
,
``
and
what
a
pleasant
smile
he
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Savelich
,
do
you
still
not
wish
to
accept
your
freedom
?
''
Pierre
*NL*
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
freedom
to
me
,
your
excellency
?
We
lived
under
the
*NL*
late
count
--
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his
!
--
and
we
have
lived
under
you
*NL*
too
,
without
ever
being
wronged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
children
will
live
just
the
same
.
With
such
masters
one
can
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
about
my
heirs
?
''
said
Pierre
.
``
Supposing
I
suddenly
marry
...
*NL*
it
might
happen
,
''
he
added
with
an
involuntary
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
may
take
the
liberty
,
your
excellency
,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
easy
he
thinks
it
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
He
does
n't
know
how
terrible
*NL*
it
is
and
how
dangerous
.
Too
soon
or
too
late
...
it
is
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
what
are
your
orders
?
Are
you
starting
tomorrow
?
''
asked
Savelich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
put
it
off
for
a
bit
.
I
'll
tell
you
later
.
You
must
forgive
*NL*
the
trouble
I
have
put
you
to
,
''
said
Pierre
,
and
seeing
Savelich
smile
,
*NL*
he
thought
:
``
But
how
strange
it
is
that
he
should
not
know
that
now
*NL*
there
is
no
Petersburg
for
me
,
and
that
that
must
be
settled
first
of
*NL*
all
!
But
probably
he
knows
it
well
enough
and
is
only
pretending
.
Shall
*NL*
I
have
a
talk
with
him
and
see
what
he
thinks
?
''
Pierre
reflected
.
``
No
,
*NL*
another
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
Pierre
told
the
princess
,
his
cousin
,
that
he
had
been
to
*NL*
see
Princess
Mary
the
day
before
and
had
there
met
--
``
Whom
do
you
think
?
*NL*
Natasha
Rostova
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
seemed
to
see
nothing
more
extraordinary
in
that
than
if
he
*NL*
had
seen
Anna
Semenovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
her
?
''
asked
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
the
princess
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
heard
that
they
were
*NL*
arranging
a
match
for
her
with
young
Rostov
.
It
would
be
a
very
good
*NL*
thing
for
the
Rostovs
,
they
are
said
to
be
utterly
ruined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
mean
do
you
know
Natasha
Rostova
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
about
that
affair
of
hers
at
the
time
.
It
was
a
great
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
either
does
n't
understand
or
is
pretending
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
*NL*
``
Better
not
say
anything
to
her
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
too
had
prepared
provisions
for
Pierre
's
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
they
all
are
,
''
thought
Pierre
.
``
What
is
surprising
is
that
*NL*
they
should
trouble
about
these
things
now
when
it
can
no
longer
be
of
*NL*
interest
to
them
.
And
all
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
same
day
the
Chief
of
Police
came
to
Pierre
,
inviting
him
to
send
*NL*
a
representative
to
the
Faceted
Palace
to
recover
things
that
were
to
be
*NL*
returned
to
their
owners
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
man
too
,
''
thought
Pierre
,
looking
into
the
face
of
the
Chief
*NL*
of
Police
.
``
What
a
fine
,
good-looking
officer
and
how
kind
.
Fancy
*NL*
bothering
about
such
trifles
now
!
And
they
actually
say
he
is
not
honest
*NL*
and
takes
bribes
.
What
nonsense
!
Besides
,
why
should
n't
he
take
bribes
?
*NL*
That
's
the
way
he
was
brought
up
,
and
everybody
does
it
.
But
what
a
*NL*
kind
,
pleasant
face
and
how
he
smiles
as
he
looks
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
to
Princess
Mary
's
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
drove
through
the
streets
past
the
houses
that
had
been
burned
*NL*
down
,
he
was
surprised
by
the
beauty
of
those
ruins
.
The
picturesqueness
*NL*
of
the
chimney
stacks
and
tumble-down
walls
of
the
burned-out
quarters
*NL*
of
the
town
,
stretching
out
and
concealing
one
another
,
reminded
him
of
*NL*
the
Rhine
and
the
Colosseum
.
The
cabmen
he
met
and
their
passengers
,
the
*NL*
carpenters
cutting
the
timber
for
new
houses
with
axes
,
the
women
*NL*
hawkers
,
and
the
shopkeepers
,
all
looked
at
him
with
cheerful
beaming
*NL*
eyes
that
seemed
to
say
:
``
Ah
,
there
he
is
!
Let
's
see
what
will
come
of
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
to
Princess
Mary
's
house
Pierre
felt
doubtful
whether
he
*NL*
had
really
been
there
the
night
before
and
really
seen
Natasha
and
*NL*
talked
to
her
.
``
Perhaps
I
imagined
it
;
perhaps
I
shall
go
in
and
find
no
*NL*
one
there
.
''
But
he
had
hardly
entered
the
room
before
he
felt
her
*NL*
presence
with
his
whole
being
by
the
loss
of
his
sense
of
freedom
.
She
*NL*
was
in
the
same
black
dress
with
soft
folds
and
her
hair
was
done
the
*NL*
same
way
as
the
day
before
,
yet
she
was
quite
different
.
Had
she
been
*NL*
like
this
when
he
entered
the
day
before
he
could
not
for
a
moment
have
*NL*
failed
to
recognize
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
he
had
known
her
almost
as
a
child
and
later
on
as
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
's
fiancee
.
A
bright
questioning
light
shone
in
her
eyes
,
and
on
*NL*
her
face
was
a
friendly
and
strangely
roguish
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
dined
with
them
and
would
have
spent
the
whole
evening
there
,
but
*NL*
Princess
Mary
was
going
to
vespers
and
Pierre
left
the
house
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
came
early
,
dined
,
and
stayed
the
whole
evening
.
Though
*NL*
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
were
evidently
glad
to
see
their
visitor
and
*NL*
though
all
Pierre
's
interest
was
now
centered
in
that
house
,
by
the
*NL*
evening
they
had
talked
over
everything
and
the
conversation
passed
from
*NL*
one
trivial
topic
to
another
and
repeatedly
broke
off
.
He
stayed
so
long
*NL*
that
Princess
Mary
and
Natasha
exchanged
glances
,
evidently
wondering
*NL*
when
he
would
go
.
Pierre
noticed
this
but
could
not
go
.
He
felt
uneasy
*NL*
and
embarrassed
,
but
sat
on
because
he
simply
could
not
get
up
and
take
*NL*
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
,
foreseeing
no
end
to
this
,
rose
first
,
and
complaining
of
*NL*
a
headache
began
to
say
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
going
to
Petersburg
tomorrow
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
going
,
''
Pierre
replied
hastily
,
in
a
surprised
tone
and
as
*NL*
though
offended
.
``
Yes
...
no
...
to
Petersburg
?
Tomorrow
--
but
I
wo
n't
say
*NL*
good-by
yet
.
I
will
call
round
in
case
you
have
any
commissions
for
me
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
standing
before
Princess
Mary
and
turning
red
,
but
not
taking
*NL*
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
gave
him
her
hand
and
went
out
.
Princess
Mary
on
the
other
hand
*NL*
instead
of
going
away
sank
into
an
armchair
,
and
looked
sternly
and
*NL*
intently
at
him
with
her
deep
,
radiant
eyes
.
The
weariness
she
had
*NL*
plainly
shown
before
had
now
quite
passed
off
.
With
a
deep
and
long
-
*NL*
drawn
sigh
she
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
a
lengthy
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Natasha
left
the
room
Pierre
's
confusion
and
awkwardness
*NL*
immediately
vanished
and
were
replaced
by
eager
excitement
.
He
quickly
*NL*
moved
an
armchair
toward
Princess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wanted
to
tell
you
,
''
said
he
,
answering
her
look
as
if
she
had
*NL*
spoken
.
``
Princess
,
help
me
!
What
am
I
to
do
?
Can
I
hope
?
Princess
,
my
*NL*
dear
friend
,
listen
!
I
know
it
all
.
I
know
I
am
not
worthy
of
her
,
I
*NL*
know
it
's
impossible
to
speak
of
it
now
.
But
I
want
to
be
a
brother
to
*NL*
her
.
No
,
not
that
,
I
do
n't
,
I
ca
n't
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
rubbed
his
face
and
eyes
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
went
on
with
an
evident
effort
at
self-control
and
coherence
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
when
I
began
to
love
her
,
but
I
have
loved
her
and
her
*NL*
alone
all
my
life
,
and
I
love
her
so
that
I
can
not
imagine
life
without
*NL*
her
.
I
can
not
propose
to
her
at
present
,
but
the
thought
that
perhaps
*NL*
she
might
someday
be
my
wife
and
that
I
may
be
missing
that
*NL*
possibility
...
that
possibility
...
is
terrible
.
Tell
me
,
can
I
hope
?
*NL*
Tell
me
what
I
am
to
do
,
dear
princess
!
''
he
added
after
a
pause
,
and
*NL*
touched
her
hand
as
she
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
of
what
you
have
told
me
,
''
answered
Princess
Mary
.
``
This
*NL*
is
what
I
will
say
.
You
are
right
that
to
speak
to
her
of
love
at
*NL*
present
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
stopped
.
She
was
going
to
say
that
to
speak
of
love
was
*NL*
impossible
,
but
she
stopped
because
she
had
seen
by
the
sudden
change
in
*NL*
Natasha
two
days
before
that
she
would
not
only
not
be
hurt
if
Pierre
*NL*
spoke
of
his
love
,
but
that
it
was
the
very
thing
she
wished
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
speak
to
her
now
would
n't
do
,
''
said
the
princess
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
to
me
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
.
``
I
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
looking
into
Princess
Mary
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
...
Well
?
...
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
she
loves
...
will
love
you
,
''
Princess
Mary
corrected
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
her
words
were
out
,
Pierre
had
sprung
up
and
with
a
frightened
*NL*
expression
seized
Princess
Mary
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
so
?
You
think
I
may
hope
?
You
think
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
with
a
smile
.
``
Write
to
her
*NL*
parents
,
and
leave
it
to
me
.
I
will
tell
her
when
I
can
.
I
wish
it
to
*NL*
happen
and
my
heart
tells
me
it
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
can
not
be
!
How
happy
I
am
!
But
it
ca
n't
be
...
How
happy
I
am
!
*NL*
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
!
''
Pierre
kept
saying
as
he
kissed
Princess
Mary
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
Petersburg
,
that
will
be
best
.
And
I
will
write
to
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Petersburg
?
Go
there
?
Very
well
,
I
'll
go
.
But
I
may
come
again
*NL*
tomorrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Pierre
came
to
say
good-by
.
Natasha
was
less
animated
than
she
*NL*
had
been
the
day
before
;
but
that
day
as
he
looked
at
her
Pierre
*NL*
sometimes
felt
as
if
he
was
vanishing
and
that
neither
he
nor
she
*NL*
existed
any
longer
,
that
nothing
existed
but
happiness
.
``
Is
it
possible
?
*NL*
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
,
''
he
told
himself
at
every
look
,
gesture
,
and
word
that
*NL*
filled
his
soul
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
on
saying
good-by
he
took
her
thin
,
slender
hand
,
he
could
not
help
*NL*
holding
it
a
little
longer
in
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
that
this
hand
,
that
face
,
those
eyes
,
all
this
treasure
*NL*
of
feminine
charm
so
strange
to
me
now
,
is
it
possible
that
it
will
one
*NL*
day
be
mine
forever
,
as
familiar
to
me
as
I
am
to
myself
?
...
No
,
that
's
*NL*
impossible
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Count
,
''
she
said
aloud
.
``
I
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
*NL*
your
return
,
''
she
added
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
these
simple
words
,
her
look
,
and
the
expression
on
her
face
which
*NL*
accompanied
them
,
formed
for
two
months
the
subject
of
inexhaustible
*NL*
memories
,
interpretations
,
and
happy
meditations
for
Pierre
.
''
'
I
shall
*NL*
look
forward
very
much
to
your
return
...
'
Yes
,
yes
,
how
did
she
say
it
?
*NL*
Yes
,
'
I
shall
look
forward
very
much
to
your
return
.
'
Oh
,
how
happy
I
*NL*
am
!
What
is
happening
to
me
?
How
happy
I
am
!
''
said
Pierre
to
himself
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
Pierre
's
soul
now
at
all
like
what
had
troubled
it
*NL*
during
his
courtship
of
Helene
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
repeat
to
himself
with
a
sickening
feeling
of
shame
the
words
*NL*
he
had
spoken
,
or
say
:
``
Oh
,
why
did
I
not
say
that
?
''
and
,
``
Whatever
made
*NL*
me
say
`
Je
vous
aime
'
?
''
On
the
contrary
,
he
now
repeated
in
imagination
*NL*
every
word
that
he
or
Natasha
had
spoken
and
pictured
every
detail
of
*NL*
her
face
and
smile
,
and
did
not
wish
to
diminish
or
add
anything
,
but
*NL*
only
to
repeat
it
again
and
again
.
There
was
now
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
*NL*
in
his
mind
as
to
whether
what
he
had
undertaken
was
right
or
wrong
.
*NL*
Only
one
terrible
doubt
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
:
``
Was
n't
it
all
a
*NL*
dream
?
Is
n't
Princess
Mary
mistaken
?
Am
I
not
too
conceited
and
self
-
*NL*
confident
?
I
believe
all
this
--
and
suddenly
Princess
Mary
will
tell
her
,
*NL*
and
she
will
be
sure
to
smile
and
say
:
`
How
strange
!
He
must
be
deluding
*NL*
himself
.
Does
n't
he
know
that
he
is
a
man
,
just
a
man
,
while
I.
.
.
?
I
am
*NL*
something
altogether
different
and
higher
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
only
doubt
often
troubling
Pierre
.
He
did
not
now
make
any
*NL*
plans
.
The
happiness
before
him
appeared
so
inconceivable
that
if
only
*NL*
he
could
attain
it
,
it
would
be
the
end
of
all
things
.
Everything
ended
*NL*
with
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
joyful
,
unexpected
frenzy
,
of
which
he
had
thought
himself
incapable
,
*NL*
possessed
him
.
The
whole
meaning
of
life
--
not
for
him
alone
but
for
the
*NL*
whole
world
--
seemed
to
him
centered
in
his
love
and
the
possibility
of
*NL*
being
loved
by
her
.
At
times
everybody
seemed
to
him
to
be
occupied
with
*NL*
one
thing
only
--
his
future
happiness
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
other
people
were
all
as
pleased
as
he
was
himself
and
merely
tried
to
*NL*
hide
that
pleasure
by
pretending
to
be
busy
with
other
interests
.
In
*NL*
every
word
and
gesture
he
saw
allusions
to
his
happiness
.
He
often
*NL*
surprised
those
he
met
by
his
significantly
happy
looks
and
smiles
which
*NL*
seemed
to
express
a
secret
understanding
between
him
and
them
.
And
when
*NL*
he
realized
that
people
might
not
be
aware
of
his
happiness
,
he
pitied
*NL*
them
with
his
whole
heart
and
felt
a
desire
somehow
to
explain
to
them
*NL*
that
all
that
occupied
them
was
a
mere
frivolous
trifle
unworthy
of
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
enter
the
civil
service
,
or
*NL*
when
the
war
or
any
general
political
affairs
were
discussed
on
the
*NL*
assumption
that
everybody
's
welfare
depended
on
this
or
that
issue
of
*NL*
events
,
he
would
listen
with
a
mild
and
pitying
smile
and
surprise
*NL*
people
by
his
strange
comments
.
But
at
this
time
he
saw
everybody
--
both
*NL*
those
who
,
as
he
imagined
,
understood
the
real
meaning
of
life
-LRB-
that
is
,
*NL*
what
he
was
feeling
-RRB-
and
those
unfortunates
who
evidently
did
not
*NL*
understand
it
--
in
the
bright
light
of
the
emotion
that
shone
within
*NL*
himself
,
and
at
once
without
any
effort
saw
in
everyone
he
met
*NL*
everything
that
was
good
and
worthy
of
being
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
dealing
with
the
affairs
and
papers
of
his
dead
wife
,
her
memory
*NL*
aroused
in
him
no
feeling
but
pity
that
she
had
not
known
the
bliss
he
*NL*
now
knew
.
Prince
Vasili
,
who
having
obtained
a
new
post
and
some
fresh
*NL*
decorations
was
particularly
proud
at
this
time
,
seemed
to
him
a
*NL*
pathetic
,
kindly
old
man
much
to
be
pitied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
in
afterlife
Pierre
recalled
this
period
of
blissful
insanity
.
All
*NL*
the
views
he
formed
of
men
and
circumstances
at
this
time
remained
true
*NL*
for
him
always
.
He
not
only
did
not
renounce
them
subsequently
,
but
when
*NL*
he
was
in
doubt
or
inwardly
at
variance
,
he
referred
to
the
views
he
had
*NL*
held
at
this
time
of
his
madness
and
they
always
proved
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
appeared
strange
and
queer
then
,
''
he
thought
,
``
but
I
was
not
*NL*
so
mad
as
I
seemed
.
On
the
contrary
I
was
then
wiser
and
had
more
*NL*
insight
than
at
any
other
time
,
and
understood
all
that
is
worth
*NL*
understanding
in
life
,
because
...
because
I
was
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
insanity
consisted
in
not
waiting
,
as
he
used
to
do
,
to
*NL*
discover
personal
attributes
which
he
termed
``
good
qualities
''
in
people
*NL*
before
loving
them
;
his
heart
was
now
overflowing
with
love
,
and
by
*NL*
loving
people
without
cause
he
discovered
indubitable
causes
for
loving
*NL*
them
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
After
Pierre
's
departure
that
first
evening
,
when
Natasha
had
said
to
*NL*
Princess
Mary
with
a
gaily
mocking
smile
:
``
He
looks
just
,
yes
,
just
as
*NL*
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
Russian
bath
--
in
a
short
coat
and
with
his
hair
*NL*
cropped
,
''
something
hidden
and
unknown
to
herself
,
but
irrepressible
,
*NL*
awoke
in
Natasha
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
:
her
face
,
walk
,
look
,
and
voice
,
was
suddenly
altered
.
To
*NL*
her
own
surprise
a
power
of
life
and
hope
of
happiness
rose
to
the
*NL*
surface
and
demanded
satisfaction
.
From
that
evening
she
seemed
to
have
*NL*
forgotten
all
that
had
happened
to
her
.
She
no
longer
complained
of
her
*NL*
position
,
did
not
say
a
word
about
the
past
,
and
no
longer
feared
to
*NL*
make
happy
plans
for
the
future
.
She
spoke
little
of
Pierre
,
but
when
*NL*
Princess
Mary
mentioned
him
a
long-extinguished
light
once
more
kindled
*NL*
in
her
eyes
and
her
lips
curved
with
a
strange
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
that
took
place
in
Natasha
at
first
surprised
Princess
Mary
;
*NL*
but
when
she
understood
its
meaning
it
grieved
her
.
``
Can
she
have
loved
*NL*
my
brother
so
little
as
to
be
able
to
forget
him
so
soon
?
''
she
thought
*NL*
when
she
reflected
on
the
change
.
But
when
she
was
with
Natasha
she
was
*NL*
not
vexed
with
her
and
did
not
reproach
her
.
The
reawakened
power
of
*NL*
life
that
had
seized
Natasha
was
so
evidently
irrepressible
and
*NL*
unexpected
by
her
that
in
her
presence
Princess
Mary
felt
that
she
had
*NL*
no
right
to
reproach
her
even
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
gave
herself
up
so
fully
and
frankly
to
this
new
feeling
that
*NL*
she
did
not
try
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
no
longer
sad
,
but
bright
*NL*
and
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Princess
Mary
returned
to
her
room
after
her
nocturnal
talk
with
*NL*
Pierre
,
Natasha
met
her
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
spoken
?
Yes
?
He
has
spoken
?
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
joyful
yet
pathetic
expression
which
seemed
to
beg
forgiveness
for
*NL*
her
joy
settled
on
Natasha
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
listen
at
the
door
,
but
I
knew
you
would
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Understandable
and
touching
as
the
look
with
which
Natasha
gazed
at
her
*NL*
seemed
to
Princess
Mary
,
and
sorry
as
she
was
to
see
her
agitation
,
*NL*
these
words
pained
her
for
a
moment
.
She
remembered
her
brother
and
his
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
She
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
thought
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
sad
and
rather
stern
look
she
told
Natasha
all
that
Pierre
*NL*
had
said
.
On
hearing
that
he
was
going
to
Petersburg
Natasha
was
*NL*
astounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Petersburg
!
''
she
repeated
as
if
unable
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
noticing
the
grieved
expression
on
Princess
Mary
's
face
she
guessed
*NL*
the
reason
of
that
sadness
and
suddenly
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
''
said
she
,
``
tell
me
what
I
should
do
!
I
am
afraid
of
being
bad
.
*NL*
Whatever
you
tell
me
,
I
will
do
.
Tell
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
whispered
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
are
you
crying
?
I
am
happy
for
your
sake
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
,
*NL*
who
because
of
those
tears
quite
forgave
Natasha
's
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
just
yet
--
someday
.
Think
what
fun
it
will
be
when
I
am
his
*NL*
wife
and
you
marry
Nicholas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
I
have
asked
you
not
to
speak
of
that
.
Let
us
talk
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
go
to
Petersburg
?
''
Natasha
suddenly
asked
,
and
hastily
replied
*NL*
to
her
own
question
.
``
But
no
,
no
,
he
must
...
Yes
,
Mary
,
He
must
...

EPILOGUE

*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
years
had
passed
.
The
storm-tossed
sea
of
European
history
had
*NL*
subsided
within
its
shores
and
seemed
to
have
become
calm
.
But
the
*NL*
mysterious
forces
that
move
humanity
-LRB-
mysterious
because
the
laws
of
*NL*
their
motion
are
unknown
to
us
-RRB-
continued
to
operate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
surface
of
the
sea
of
history
seemed
motionless
,
the
movement
*NL*
of
humanity
went
on
as
unceasingly
as
the
flow
of
time
.
Various
groups
*NL*
of
people
formed
and
dissolved
,
the
coming
formation
and
dissolution
of
*NL*
kingdoms
and
displacement
of
peoples
was
in
course
of
preparation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea
of
history
was
not
driven
spasmodically
from
shore
to
shore
as
*NL*
previously
.
It
was
seething
in
its
depths
.
Historic
figures
were
not
*NL*
borne
by
the
waves
from
one
shore
to
another
as
before
.
They
now
seemed
*NL*
to
rotate
on
one
spot
.
The
historical
figures
at
the
head
of
armies
,
who
*NL*
formerly
reflected
the
movement
of
the
masses
by
ordering
wars
,
*NL*
campaigns
,
and
battles
,
now
reflected
the
restless
movement
by
political
*NL*
and
diplomatic
combinations
,
laws
,
and
treaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
call
this
activity
of
the
historical
figures
``
the
*NL*
reaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
dealing
with
this
period
they
sternly
condemn
the
historical
*NL*
personages
who
,
in
their
opinion
,
caused
what
they
describe
as
the
*NL*
reaction
.
All
the
well-known
people
of
that
period
,
from
Alexander
and
*NL*
Napoleon
to
Madame
de
Stael
,
Photius
,
Schelling
,
Fichte
,
Chateaubriand
,
*NL*
and
the
rest
,
pass
before
their
stern
judgment
seat
and
are
acquitted
or
*NL*
condemned
according
to
whether
they
conduced
to
progress
or
to
reaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
their
accounts
a
reaction
took
place
at
that
time
in
Russia
*NL*
also
,
and
the
chief
culprit
was
Alexander
I
,
the
same
man
who
according
*NL*
to
them
was
the
chief
cause
of
the
liberal
movement
at
the
commencement
*NL*
of
his
reign
,
being
the
savior
of
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
one
in
Russian
literature
now
,
from
schoolboy
essayist
to
*NL*
learned
historian
,
who
does
not
throw
his
little
stone
at
Alexander
for
*NL*
things
he
did
wrong
at
this
period
of
his
reign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
to
have
acted
in
this
way
and
in
that
way
.
In
this
case
he
did
*NL*
well
and
in
that
case
badly
.
He
behaved
admirably
at
the
beginning
of
*NL*
his
reign
and
during
1812
,
but
acted
badly
by
giving
a
constitution
to
*NL*
Poland
,
forming
the
Holy
Alliance
,
entrusting
power
to
Arakcheev
,
*NL*
favoring
Golitsyn
and
mysticism
,
and
afterwards
Shishkov
and
Photius
.
He
*NL*
also
acted
badly
by
concerning
himself
with
the
active
army
and
*NL*
disbanding
the
Semenov
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
take
a
dozen
pages
to
enumerate
all
the
reproaches
the
*NL*
historians
address
to
him
,
based
on
their
knowledge
of
what
is
good
for
*NL*
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
do
these
reproaches
mean
?
*NL*
*NL*
Do
not
the
very
actions
for
which
the
historians
praise
Alexander
I
-LRB-
the
*NL*
liberal
attempts
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
,
his
struggle
with
*NL*
Napoleon
,
the
firmness
he
displayed
in
1812
and
the
campaign
of
1813
-RRB-
*NL*
flow
from
the
same
sources
--
the
circumstances
of
his
birth
,
education
,
*NL*
and
life
--
that
made
his
personality
what
it
was
and
from
which
the
*NL*
actions
for
which
they
blame
him
-LRB-
the
Holy
Alliance
,
the
restoration
of
*NL*
Poland
,
and
the
reaction
of
1820
and
later
-RRB-
also
flowed
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
does
the
substance
of
those
reproaches
lie
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
lies
in
the
fact
that
an
historic
character
like
Alexander
I
,
*NL*
standing
on
the
highest
possible
pinnacle
of
human
power
with
the
*NL*
blinding
light
of
history
focused
upon
him
;
a
character
exposed
to
those
*NL*
strongest
of
all
influences
:
the
intrigues
,
flattery
,
and
self-deception
*NL*
inseparable
from
power
;
a
character
who
at
every
moment
of
his
life
felt
*NL*
a
responsibility
for
all
that
was
happening
in
Europe
;
and
not
a
*NL*
fictitious
but
a
live
character
who
like
every
man
had
his
personal
*NL*
habits
,
passions
,
and
impulses
toward
goodness
,
beauty
,
and
truth
--
that
*NL*
this
character
--
though
not
lacking
in
virtue
-LRB-
the
historians
do
not
*NL*
accuse
him
of
that
-RRB-
--
had
not
the
same
conception
of
the
welfare
of
*NL*
humanity
fifty
years
ago
as
a
present-day
professor
who
from
his
youth
*NL*
upwards
has
been
occupied
with
learning
:
that
is
,
with
books
and
*NL*
lectures
and
with
taking
notes
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
if
we
assume
that
fifty
years
ago
Alexander
I
was
mistaken
in
*NL*
his
view
of
what
was
good
for
the
people
,
we
must
inevitably
assume
that
*NL*
the
historian
who
judges
Alexander
will
also
after
the
lapse
of
some
*NL*
time
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
in
his
view
of
what
is
good
for
humanity
.
*NL*
This
assumption
is
all
the
more
natural
and
inevitable
because
,
watching
*NL*
the
movement
of
history
,
we
see
that
every
year
and
with
each
new
*NL*
writer
,
opinion
as
to
what
is
good
for
mankind
changes
;
so
that
what
*NL*
once
seemed
good
,
ten
years
later
seems
bad
,
and
vice
versa
.
And
what
is
*NL*
more
,
we
find
at
one
and
the
same
time
quite
contradictory
views
as
to
*NL*
what
is
bad
and
what
is
good
in
history
:
some
people
regard
giving
a
*NL*
constitution
to
Poland
and
forming
the
Holy
Alliance
as
praiseworthy
in
*NL*
Alexander
,
while
others
regard
it
as
blameworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
activity
of
Alexander
or
of
Napoleon
can
not
be
called
useful
or
*NL*
harmful
,
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
for
what
it
was
useful
or
harmful
.
*NL*
If
that
activity
displeases
somebody
,
this
is
only
because
it
does
not
*NL*
agree
with
his
limited
understanding
of
what
is
good
.
Whether
the
*NL*
preservation
of
my
father
's
house
in
Moscow
,
or
the
glory
of
the
Russian
*NL*
arms
,
or
the
prosperity
of
the
Petersburg
and
other
universities
,
or
the
*NL*
freedom
of
Poland
or
the
greatness
of
Russia
,
or
the
balance
of
power
in
*NL*
Europe
,
or
a
certain
kind
of
European
culture
called
``
progress
''
appear
*NL*
to
me
to
be
good
or
bad
,
I
must
admit
that
besides
these
things
the
*NL*
action
of
every
historic
character
has
other
more
general
purposes
*NL*
inaccessible
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
let
us
assume
that
what
is
called
science
can
harmonize
all
*NL*
contradictions
and
possesses
an
unchanging
standard
of
good
and
bad
by
*NL*
which
to
try
historic
characters
and
events
;
let
us
say
that
Alexander
*NL*
could
have
done
everything
differently
;
let
us
say
that
with
guidance
*NL*
from
those
who
blame
him
and
who
profess
to
know
the
ultimate
aim
of
the
*NL*
movement
of
humanity
,
he
might
have
arranged
matters
according
to
the
*NL*
program
his
present
accusers
would
have
given
him
--
of
nationality
,
*NL*
freedom
,
equality
,
and
progress
-LRB-
these
,
I
think
,
cover
the
ground
-RRB-
.
Let
*NL*
us
assume
that
this
program
was
possible
and
had
then
been
formulated
,
*NL*
and
that
Alexander
had
acted
on
it
.
What
would
then
have
become
of
the
*NL*
activity
of
all
those
who
opposed
the
tendency
that
then
prevailed
in
*NL*
the
government
--
an
activity
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
historians
was
*NL*
good
and
beneficent
?
Their
activity
would
not
have
existed
:
there
would
*NL*
have
been
no
life
,
there
would
have
been
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
admit
that
human
life
can
be
ruled
by
reason
,
the
possibility
of
*NL*
life
is
destroyed
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
assume
as
the
historians
do
that
great
men
lead
humanity
to
the
*NL*
attainment
of
certain
ends
--
the
greatness
of
Russia
or
of
France
,
the
*NL*
balance
of
power
in
Europe
,
the
diffusion
of
the
ideas
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
,
general
progress
,
or
anything
else
--
then
it
is
impossible
to
*NL*
explain
the
facts
of
history
without
introducing
the
conceptions
of
*NL*
chance
and
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
aim
of
the
European
wars
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
had
been
the
aggrandizement
of
Russia
,
that
aim
might
have
been
*NL*
accomplished
without
all
the
preceding
wars
and
without
the
invasion
.
If
*NL*
the
aim
was
the
aggrandizement
of
France
,
that
might
have
been
attained
*NL*
without
the
Revolution
and
without
the
Empire
.
If
the
aim
was
the
*NL*
dissemination
of
ideas
,
the
printing
press
could
have
accomplished
that
*NL*
much
better
than
warfare
.
If
the
aim
was
the
progress
of
civilization
,
*NL*
it
is
easy
to
see
that
there
are
other
ways
of
diffusing
civilization
*NL*
more
expedient
than
by
the
destruction
of
wealth
and
of
human
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
it
happen
in
this
and
not
in
some
other
way
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
it
happened
so
!
``
Chance
created
the
situation
;
genius
utilized
*NL*
it
,
''
says
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
is
chance
?
What
is
genius
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
chance
and
genius
do
not
denote
any
really
existing
thing
and
*NL*
therefore
can
not
be
defined
.
Those
words
only
denote
a
certain
stage
of
*NL*
understanding
of
phenomena
.
I
do
not
know
why
a
certain
event
occurs
;
I
*NL*
think
that
I
can
not
know
it
;
so
I
do
not
try
to
know
it
and
I
talk
about
*NL*
chance
.
I
see
a
force
producing
effects
beyond
the
scope
of
ordinary
*NL*
human
agencies
;
I
do
not
understand
why
this
occurs
and
I
talk
of
*NL*
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
herd
of
rams
,
the
ram
the
herdsman
drives
each
evening
into
a
*NL*
special
enclosure
to
feed
and
that
becomes
twice
as
fat
as
the
others
*NL*
must
seem
to
be
a
genius
.
And
it
must
appear
an
astonishing
conjunction
*NL*
of
genius
with
a
whole
series
of
extraordinary
chances
that
this
ram
,
*NL*
who
instead
of
getting
into
the
general
fold
every
evening
goes
into
a
*NL*
special
enclosure
where
there
are
oats
--
that
this
very
ram
,
swelling
*NL*
with
fat
,
is
killed
for
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
rams
need
only
cease
to
suppose
that
all
that
happens
to
them
*NL*
happens
solely
for
the
attainment
of
their
sheepish
aims
;
they
need
only
*NL*
admit
that
what
happens
to
them
may
also
have
purposes
beyond
their
ken
,
*NL*
and
they
will
at
once
perceive
a
unity
and
coherence
in
what
happened
to
*NL*
the
ram
that
was
fattened
.
Even
if
they
do
not
know
for
what
purpose
*NL*
they
are
fattened
,
they
will
at
least
know
that
all
that
happened
to
the
*NL*
ram
did
not
happen
accidentally
,
and
will
no
longer
need
the
conceptions
*NL*
of
chance
or
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
renouncing
our
claim
to
discern
a
purpose
immediately
*NL*
intelligible
to
us
,
and
admitting
the
ultimate
purpose
to
be
beyond
our
*NL*
ken
,
may
we
discern
the
sequence
of
experiences
in
the
lives
of
historic
*NL*
characters
and
perceive
the
cause
of
the
effect
they
produce
*NL*
-LRB-
incommensurable
with
ordinary
human
capabilities
-RRB-
,
and
then
the
words
*NL*
chance
and
genius
become
superfluous
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
need
only
confess
that
we
do
not
know
the
purpose
of
the
European
*NL*
convulsions
and
that
we
know
only
the
facts
--
that
is
,
the
murders
,
first
*NL*
in
France
,
then
in
Italy
,
in
Africa
,
in
Prussia
,
in
Austria
,
in
Spain
,
*NL*
and
in
Russia
--
and
that
the
movements
from
the
west
to
the
east
and
from
*NL*
the
east
to
the
west
form
the
essence
and
purpose
of
these
events
,
and
*NL*
not
only
shall
we
have
no
need
to
see
exceptional
ability
and
genius
in
*NL*
Napoleon
and
Alexander
,
but
we
shall
be
unable
to
consider
them
to
be
*NL*
anything
but
like
other
men
,
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
have
*NL*
recourse
to
chance
for
an
explanation
of
those
small
events
which
made
*NL*
these
people
what
they
were
,
but
it
will
be
clear
that
all
those
small
*NL*
events
were
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
discarding
a
claim
to
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
purpose
,
we
shall
*NL*
clearly
perceive
that
just
as
one
can
not
imagine
a
blossom
or
seed
for
*NL*
any
single
plant
better
suited
to
it
than
those
it
produces
,
so
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
imagine
any
two
people
more
completely
adapted
down
to
the
*NL*
smallest
detail
for
the
purpose
they
had
to
fulfill
,
than
Napoleon
and
*NL*
Alexander
with
all
their
antecedents
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
fundamental
and
essential
significance
of
the
European
events
of
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
lies
in
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
*NL*
the
European
peoples
from
west
to
east
and
afterwards
from
east
to
west
.
*NL*
The
commencement
of
that
movement
was
the
movement
from
west
to
east
.
*NL*
For
the
peoples
of
the
west
to
be
able
to
make
their
warlike
movement
to
*NL*
Moscow
it
was
necessary
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
that
they
should
form
themselves
into
a
*NL*
military
group
of
a
size
able
to
endure
a
collision
with
the
warlike
*NL*
military
group
of
the
east
,
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
that
they
should
abandon
all
established
*NL*
traditions
and
customs
,
and
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
that
during
their
military
movement
they
*NL*
should
have
at
their
head
a
man
who
could
justify
to
himself
and
to
them
*NL*
the
deceptions
,
robberies
,
and
murders
which
would
have
to
be
committed
*NL*
during
that
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
beginning
with
the
French
Revolution
the
old
inadequately
large
*NL*
group
was
destroyed
,
as
well
as
the
old
habits
and
traditions
,
and
step
*NL*
by
step
a
group
was
formed
of
larger
dimensions
with
new
customs
and
*NL*
traditions
,
and
a
man
was
produced
who
would
stand
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
coming
movement
and
bear
the
responsibility
for
all
that
had
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
without
convictions
,
without
habits
,
without
traditions
,
without
a
*NL*
name
,
and
not
even
a
Frenchman
,
emerges
--
by
what
seem
the
strangest
*NL*
chances
--
from
among
all
the
seething
French
parties
,
and
without
joining
*NL*
any
one
of
them
is
borne
forward
to
a
prominent
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ignorance
of
his
colleagues
,
the
weakness
and
insignificance
of
his
*NL*
opponents
,
the
frankness
of
his
falsehoods
,
and
the
dazzling
and
self
-
*NL*
confident
limitations
of
this
man
raise
him
to
the
head
of
the
army
.
The
*NL*
brilliant
qualities
of
the
soldiers
of
the
army
sent
to
Italy
,
his
*NL*
opponents
'
reluctance
to
fight
,
and
his
own
childish
audacity
and
self
-
*NL*
confidence
secure
him
military
fame
.
Innumerable
so-called
chances
*NL*
accompany
him
everywhere
.
The
disfavor
into
which
he
falls
with
the
*NL*
rulers
of
France
turns
to
his
advantage
.
His
attempts
to
avoid
his
*NL*
predestined
path
are
unsuccessful
:
he
is
not
received
into
the
Russian
*NL*
service
,
and
the
appointment
he
seeks
in
Turkey
comes
to
nothing
.
During
*NL*
the
war
in
Italy
he
is
several
times
on
the
verge
of
destruction
and
*NL*
each
time
is
saved
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
Owing
to
various
diplomatic
*NL*
considerations
the
Russian
armies
--
just
those
which
might
have
destroyed
*NL*
his
prestige
--
do
not
appear
upon
the
scene
till
he
is
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
from
Italy
he
finds
the
government
in
Paris
in
a
process
*NL*
of
dissolution
in
which
all
those
who
are
in
it
are
inevitably
wiped
out
*NL*
and
destroyed
.
And
by
chance
an
escape
from
this
dangerous
position
*NL*
presents
itself
in
the
form
of
an
aimless
and
senseless
expedition
to
*NL*
Africa
.
Again
so-called
chance
accompanies
him
.
Impregnable
Malta
*NL*
surrenders
without
a
shot
;
his
most
reckless
schemes
are
crowned
with
*NL*
success
.
The
enemy
's
fleet
,
which
subsequently
did
not
let
a
single
boat
*NL*
pass
,
allows
his
entire
army
to
elude
it
.
In
Africa
a
whole
series
of
*NL*
outrages
are
committed
against
the
almost
unarmed
inhabitants
.
And
the
*NL*
men
who
commit
these
crimes
,
especially
their
leader
,
assure
themselves
*NL*
that
this
is
admirable
,
this
is
glory
--
it
resembles
Caesar
and
Alexander
*NL*
the
Great
and
is
therefore
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
ideal
of
glory
and
grandeur
--
which
consists
not
merely
in
*NL*
considering
nothing
wrong
that
one
does
but
in
priding
oneself
on
every
*NL*
crime
one
commits
,
ascribing
to
it
an
incomprehensible
supernatural
*NL*
significance
--
that
ideal
,
destined
to
guide
this
man
and
his
associates
,
*NL*
had
scope
for
its
development
in
Africa
.
Whatever
he
does
succeeds
.
The
*NL*
plague
does
not
touch
him
.
The
cruelty
of
murdering
prisoners
is
not
*NL*
imputed
to
him
as
a
fault
.
His
childishly
rash
,
uncalled-for
,
and
*NL*
ignoble
departure
from
Africa
,
leaving
his
comrades
in
distress
,
is
set
*NL*
down
to
his
credit
,
and
again
the
enemy
's
fleet
twice
lets
him
slip
*NL*
past
.
When
,
intoxicated
by
the
crimes
he
has
committed
so
successfully
,
*NL*
he
reaches
Paris
,
the
dissolution
of
the
republican
government
,
which
a
*NL*
year
earlier
might
have
ruined
him
,
has
reached
its
extreme
limit
,
and
*NL*
his
presence
there
now
as
a
newcomer
free
from
party
entanglements
can
*NL*
only
serve
to
exalt
him
--
and
though
he
himself
has
no
plan
,
he
is
quite
*NL*
ready
for
his
new
role
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
plan
,
he
was
afraid
of
everything
,
but
the
parties
snatched
at
*NL*
him
and
demanded
his
participation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
alone
--
with
his
ideal
of
glory
and
grandeur
developed
in
Italy
and
*NL*
Egypt
,
his
insane
self-adulation
,
his
boldness
in
crime
and
frankness
in
*NL*
lying
--
he
alone
could
justify
what
had
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
needed
for
the
place
that
awaits
him
,
and
so
almost
apart
from
his
*NL*
will
and
despite
his
indecision
,
his
lack
of
a
plan
,
and
all
his
*NL*
mistakes
,
he
is
drawn
into
a
conspiracy
that
aims
at
seizing
power
and
*NL*
the
conspiracy
is
crowned
with
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
pushed
into
a
meeting
of
the
legislature
.
In
alarm
he
wishes
to
*NL*
flee
,
considering
himself
lost
.
He
pretends
to
fall
into
a
swoon
and
*NL*
says
senseless
things
that
should
have
ruined
him
.
But
the
once
proud
*NL*
and
shrewd
rulers
of
France
,
feeling
that
their
part
is
played
out
,
are
*NL*
even
more
bewildered
than
he
,
and
do
not
say
the
words
they
should
have
*NL*
said
to
destroy
him
and
retain
their
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
,
millions
of
chances
,
give
him
power
,
and
all
men
as
if
by
*NL*
agreement
co-operate
to
confirm
that
power
.
Chance
forms
the
characters
*NL*
of
the
rulers
of
France
,
who
submit
to
him
;
chance
forms
the
character
*NL*
of
Paul
I
of
Russia
who
recognizes
his
government
;
chance
contrives
a
*NL*
plot
against
him
which
not
only
fails
to
harm
him
but
confirms
his
*NL*
power
.
Chance
puts
the
Duc
d'Enghien
in
his
hands
and
unexpectedly
*NL*
causes
him
to
kill
him
--
thereby
convincing
the
mob
more
forcibly
than
in
*NL*
any
other
way
that
he
had
the
right
,
since
he
had
the
might
.
Chance
*NL*
contrives
that
though
he
directs
all
his
efforts
to
prepare
an
*NL*
expedition
against
England
-LRB-
which
would
inevitably
have
ruined
him
-RRB-
he
*NL*
never
carries
out
that
intention
,
but
unexpectedly
falls
upon
Mack
and
*NL*
the
Austrians
,
who
surrender
without
a
battle
.
Chance
and
genius
give
*NL*
him
the
victory
at
Austerlitz
;
and
by
chance
all
men
,
not
only
the
*NL*
French
but
all
Europe
--
except
England
which
does
not
take
part
in
the
*NL*
events
about
to
happen
--
despite
their
former
horror
and
detestation
of
*NL*
his
crimes
,
now
recognize
his
authority
,
the
title
he
has
given
himself
,
*NL*
and
his
ideal
of
grandeur
and
glory
,
which
seems
excellent
and
*NL*
reasonable
to
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
measuring
themselves
and
preparing
for
the
coming
movement
,
the
*NL*
western
forces
push
toward
the
east
several
times
in
1805
,
1806
,
1807
,
*NL*
and
1809
,
gaining
strength
and
growing
.
In
1811
the
group
of
people
that
*NL*
had
formed
in
France
unites
into
one
group
with
the
peoples
of
Central
*NL*
Europe
.
The
strength
of
the
justification
of
the
man
who
stands
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
movement
grows
with
the
increased
size
of
the
group
.
During
*NL*
the
ten-year
preparatory
period
this
man
had
formed
relations
with
all
*NL*
the
crowned
heads
of
Europe
.
The
discredited
rulers
of
the
world
can
*NL*
oppose
no
reasonable
ideal
to
the
insensate
Napoleonic
ideal
of
glory
*NL*
and
grandeur
.
One
after
another
they
hasten
to
display
their
*NL*
insignificance
before
him
.
The
King
of
Prussia
sends
his
wife
to
seek
*NL*
the
great
man
's
mercy
;
the
Emperor
of
Austria
considers
it
a
favor
that
*NL*
this
man
receives
a
daughter
of
the
Caesars
into
his
bed
;
the
Pope
,
the
*NL*
guardian
of
all
that
the
nations
hold
sacred
,
utilizes
religion
for
the
*NL*
aggrandizement
of
the
great
man
.
It
is
not
Napoleon
who
prepares
himself
*NL*
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
role
,
so
much
as
all
those
round
him
who
*NL*
prepare
him
to
take
on
himself
the
whole
responsibility
for
what
is
*NL*
happening
and
has
to
happen
.
There
is
no
step
,
no
crime
or
petty
fraud
*NL*
he
commits
,
which
in
the
mouths
of
those
around
him
is
not
at
once
*NL*
represented
as
a
great
deed
.
The
most
suitable
fete
the
Germans
can
*NL*
devise
for
him
is
a
celebration
of
Jena
and
Auerstadt
.
Not
only
is
he
*NL*
great
,
but
so
are
his
ancestors
,
his
brothers
,
his
stepsons
,
and
his
*NL*
brothers-in-law
.
Everything
is
done
to
deprive
him
of
the
remains
of
his
*NL*
reason
and
to
prepare
him
for
his
terrible
part
.
And
when
he
is
ready
so
*NL*
too
are
the
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invasion
pushes
eastward
and
reaches
its
final
goal
--
Moscow
.
That
*NL*
city
is
taken
;
the
Russian
army
suffers
heavier
losses
than
the
opposing
*NL*
armies
had
suffered
in
the
former
war
from
Austerlitz
to
Wagram
.
But
*NL*
suddenly
instead
of
those
chances
and
that
genius
which
hitherto
had
so
*NL*
consistently
led
him
by
an
uninterrupted
series
of
successes
to
the
*NL*
predestined
goal
,
an
innumerable
sequence
of
inverse
chances
occur
--
from
*NL*
the
cold
in
his
head
at
Borodino
to
the
sparks
which
set
Moscow
on
fire
,
*NL*
and
the
frosts
--
and
instead
of
genius
,
stupidity
and
immeasurable
*NL*
baseness
become
evident
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invaders
flee
,
turn
back
,
flee
again
,
and
all
the
chances
are
now
*NL*
not
for
Napoleon
but
always
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
countermovement
is
then
accomplished
from
east
to
west
with
a
*NL*
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
preceding
movement
from
west
to
east
.
*NL*
Attempted
drives
from
east
to
west
--
similar
to
the
contrary
movements
of
*NL*
1805
,
1807
,
and
1809
--
precede
the
great
westward
movement
;
there
is
the
*NL*
same
coalescence
into
a
group
of
enormous
dimensions
;
the
same
adhesion
*NL*
of
the
people
of
Central
Europe
to
the
movement
;
the
same
hesitation
*NL*
midway
,
and
the
same
increasing
rapidity
as
the
goal
is
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
,
the
ultimate
goal
,
is
reached
.
The
Napoleonic
government
and
army
*NL*
are
destroyed
.
Napoleon
himself
is
no
longer
of
any
account
;
all
his
*NL*
actions
are
evidently
pitiful
and
mean
,
but
again
an
inexplicable
chance
*NL*
occurs
.
The
allies
detest
Napoleon
whom
they
regard
as
the
cause
of
*NL*
their
sufferings
.
Deprived
of
power
and
authority
,
his
crimes
and
his
*NL*
craft
exposed
,
he
should
have
appeared
to
them
what
he
appeared
ten
*NL*
years
previously
and
one
year
later
--
an
outlawed
brigand
.
But
by
some
*NL*
strange
chance
no
one
perceives
this
.
His
part
is
not
yet
ended
.
The
man
*NL*
who
ten
years
before
and
a
year
later
was
considered
an
outlawed
brigand
*NL*
is
sent
to
an
island
two
days
'
sail
from
France
,
which
for
some
reason
*NL*
is
presented
to
him
as
his
dominion
,
and
guards
are
given
to
him
and
*NL*
millions
of
money
are
paid
him
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
flood
of
nations
begins
to
subside
into
its
normal
channels
.
The
*NL*
waves
of
the
great
movement
abate
,
and
on
the
calm
surface
eddies
are
*NL*
formed
in
which
float
the
diplomatists
,
who
imagine
that
they
have
*NL*
caused
the
floods
to
abate
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
smooth
sea
again
suddenly
becomes
disturbed
.
The
diplomatists
*NL*
think
that
their
disagreements
are
the
cause
of
this
fresh
pressure
of
*NL*
natural
forces
;
they
anticipate
war
between
their
sovereigns
;
the
*NL*
position
seems
to
them
insoluble
.
But
the
wave
they
feel
to
be
rising
*NL*
does
not
come
from
the
quarter
they
expect
.
It
rises
again
from
the
same
*NL*
point
as
before
--
Paris
.
The
last
backwash
of
the
movement
from
the
west
*NL*
occurs
:
a
backwash
which
serves
to
solve
the
apparently
insuperable
*NL*
diplomatic
difficulties
and
ends
the
military
movement
of
that
period
of
*NL*
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
devastated
France
returns
to
France
alone
,
without
any
*NL*
conspiracy
and
without
soldiers
.
Any
guard
might
arrest
him
,
but
by
*NL*
strange
chance
no
one
does
so
and
all
rapturously
greet
the
man
they
*NL*
cursed
the
day
before
and
will
curse
again
a
month
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
is
still
needed
to
justify
the
final
collective
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
act
is
performed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
role
is
played
.
The
actor
is
bidden
to
disrobe
and
wash
off
his
*NL*
powder
and
paint
:
he
will
not
be
wanted
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
some
years
pass
during
which
he
plays
a
pitiful
comedy
to
himself
in
*NL*
solitude
on
his
island
,
justifying
his
actions
by
intrigues
and
lies
*NL*
when
the
justification
is
no
longer
needed
,
and
displaying
to
the
whole
*NL*
world
what
it
was
that
people
had
mistaken
for
strength
as
long
as
an
*NL*
unseen
hand
directed
his
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
having
brought
the
drama
to
a
close
and
stripped
the
actor
*NL*
shows
him
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
you
believed
in
!
This
is
he
!
Do
you
now
see
that
it
was
not
he
*NL*
but
I
who
moved
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
dazed
by
the
force
of
the
movement
,
it
was
long
before
people
*NL*
understood
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
greater
coherence
and
inevitability
is
seen
in
the
life
of
*NL*
Alexander
I
,
the
man
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
countermovement
from
*NL*
east
to
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
needed
for
him
who
,
overshadowing
others
,
stood
at
the
head
of
*NL*
that
movement
from
east
to
west
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
needed
was
a
sense
of
justice
and
a
sympathy
with
European
*NL*
affairs
,
but
a
remote
sympathy
not
dulled
by
petty
interests
;
a
moral
*NL*
superiority
over
those
sovereigns
of
the
day
who
co-operated
with
him
;
a
*NL*
mild
and
attractive
personality
;
and
a
personal
grievance
against
*NL*
Napoleon
.
And
all
this
was
found
in
Alexander
I
;
all
this
had
been
*NL*
prepared
by
innumerable
so-called
chances
in
his
life
:
his
education
,
*NL*
his
early
liberalism
,
the
advisers
who
surrounded
him
,
and
by
*NL*
Austerlitz
,
and
Tilsit
,
and
Erfurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
national
war
he
was
inactive
because
he
was
not
needed
.
But
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
necessity
for
a
general
European
war
presented
itself
he
*NL*
appeared
in
his
place
at
the
given
moment
and
,
uniting
the
nations
of
*NL*
Europe
,
led
them
to
the
goal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goal
is
reached
.
After
the
final
war
of
1815
Alexander
possesses
all
*NL*
possible
power
.
How
does
he
use
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
I
--
the
pacifier
of
Europe
,
the
man
who
from
his
early
years
*NL*
had
striven
only
for
his
people
's
welfare
,
the
originator
of
the
liberal
*NL*
innovations
in
his
fatherland
--
now
that
he
seemed
to
possess
the
utmost
*NL*
power
and
therefore
to
have
the
possibility
of
bringing
about
the
*NL*
welfare
of
his
peoples
--
at
the
time
when
Napoleon
in
exile
was
drawing
*NL*
up
childish
and
mendacious
plans
of
how
he
would
have
made
mankind
happy
*NL*
had
he
retained
power
--
Alexander
I
,
having
fulfilled
his
mission
and
*NL*
feeling
the
hand
of
God
upon
him
,
suddenly
recognizes
the
insignificance
*NL*
of
that
supposed
power
,
turns
away
from
it
,
and
gives
it
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
contemptible
men
whom
he
despises
,
saying
only
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
unto
us
,
not
unto
us
,
but
unto
Thy
Name
!
...
I
too
am
a
man
like
the
*NL*
rest
of
you
.
Let
me
live
like
a
man
and
think
of
my
soul
and
of
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
sun
and
each
atom
of
ether
is
a
sphere
complete
in
itself
,
and
*NL*
yet
at
the
same
time
only
a
part
of
a
whole
too
immense
for
man
to
*NL*
comprehend
,
so
each
individual
has
within
himself
his
own
aims
and
yet
*NL*
has
them
to
serve
a
general
purpose
incomprehensible
to
man
.

*NL*
A
bee
settling
on
a
flower
has
stung
a
child
.
And
the
child
is
afraid
of
*NL*
bees
and
declares
that
bees
exist
to
sting
people
.
A
poet
admires
the
*NL*
bee
sucking
from
the
chalice
of
a
flower
and
says
it
exists
to
suck
the
*NL*
fragrance
of
flowers
.
A
beekeeper
,
seeing
the
bee
collect
pollen
from
*NL*
flowers
and
carry
it
to
the
hive
,
says
that
it
exists
to
gather
honey
.
*NL*
Another
beekeeper
who
has
studied
the
life
of
the
hive
more
closely
says
*NL*
that
the
bee
gathers
pollen
dust
to
feed
the
young
bees
and
rear
a
*NL*
queen
,
and
that
it
exists
to
perpetuate
its
race
.
A
botanist
notices
*NL*
that
the
bee
flying
with
the
pollen
of
a
male
flower
to
a
pistil
*NL*
fertilizes
the
latter
,
and
sees
in
this
the
purpose
of
the
bee
's
*NL*
existence
.
Another
,
observing
the
migration
of
plants
,
notices
that
the
*NL*
bee
helps
in
this
work
,
and
may
say
that
in
this
lies
the
purpose
of
the
*NL*
bee
.
But
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
bee
is
not
exhausted
by
the
first
,
*NL*
the
second
,
or
any
of
the
processes
the
human
mind
can
discern
.
The
*NL*
higher
the
human
intellect
rises
in
the
discovery
of
these
purposes
,
the
*NL*
more
obvious
it
becomes
,
that
the
ultimate
purpose
is
beyond
our
*NL*
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
is
accessible
to
man
is
the
relation
of
the
life
of
the
bee
to
*NL*
other
manifestations
of
life
.
And
so
it
is
with
the
purpose
of
historic
*NL*
characters
and
nations
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
's
wedding
to
Bezukhov
,
which
took
place
in
1813
,
was
the
last
*NL*
happy
event
in
the
family
of
the
old
Rostovs
.
Count
Ilya
Rostov
died
*NL*
that
same
year
and
,
as
always
happens
,
after
the
father
's
death
the
*NL*
family
group
broke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
of
the
previous
year
:
the
burning
of
Moscow
and
the
flight
*NL*
from
it
,
the
death
of
Prince
Andrew
,
Natasha
's
despair
,
Petya
's
death
,
*NL*
and
the
old
countess
'
grief
fell
blow
after
blow
on
the
old
count
's
*NL*
head
.
He
seemed
to
be
unable
to
understand
the
meaning
of
all
these
*NL*
events
,
and
bowed
his
old
head
in
a
spiritual
sense
as
if
expecting
and
*NL*
inviting
further
blows
which
would
finish
him
.
He
seemed
now
frightened
*NL*
and
distraught
and
now
unnaturally
animated
and
enterprising
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrangements
for
Natasha
's
marriage
occupied
him
for
a
while
.
He
*NL*
ordered
dinners
and
suppers
and
obviously
tried
to
appear
cheerful
,
but
*NL*
his
cheerfulness
was
not
infectious
as
it
used
to
be
:
on
the
contrary
it
*NL*
evoked
the
compassion
of
those
who
knew
and
liked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
and
his
wife
had
left
,
he
grew
very
quiet
and
began
to
*NL*
complain
of
depression
.
A
few
days
later
he
fell
ill
and
took
to
his
*NL*
bed
.
He
realized
from
the
first
that
he
would
not
get
up
again
,
despite
*NL*
the
doctor
's
encouragement
.
The
countess
passed
a
fortnight
in
an
*NL*
armchair
by
his
pillow
without
undressing
.
Every
time
she
gave
him
his
*NL*
medicine
he
sobbed
and
silently
kissed
her
hand
.
On
his
last
day
,
*NL*
sobbing
,
he
asked
her
and
his
absent
son
to
forgive
him
for
having
*NL*
dissipated
their
property
--
that
being
the
chief
fault
of
which
he
was
*NL*
conscious
.
After
receiving
communion
and
unction
he
quietly
died
;
and
*NL*
next
day
a
throng
of
acquaintances
who
came
to
pay
their
last
respects
*NL*
to
the
deceased
filled
the
house
rented
by
the
Rostovs
.
All
these
*NL*
acquaintances
,
who
had
so
often
dined
and
danced
at
his
house
and
had
so
*NL*
often
laughed
at
him
,
now
said
,
with
a
common
feeling
of
self-reproach
*NL*
and
emotion
,
as
if
justifying
themselves
:
``
Well
,
whatever
he
may
have
*NL*
been
he
was
a
most
worthy
man
.
You
do
n't
meet
such
men
nowadays
...
And
*NL*
which
of
us
has
not
weaknesses
of
his
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
when
the
count
's
affairs
had
become
so
involved
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
say
what
would
happen
if
he
lived
another
year
that
he
*NL*
unexpectedly
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
was
with
the
Russian
army
in
Paris
when
the
news
of
his
*NL*
father
's
death
reached
him
.
He
at
once
resigned
his
commission
,
and
*NL*
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
accepted
took
leave
of
absence
and
went
to
*NL*
Moscow
.
The
state
of
the
count
's
affairs
became
quite
obvious
a
month
*NL*
after
his
death
,
surprising
everyone
by
the
immense
total
of
small
debts
*NL*
the
existence
of
which
no
one
had
suspected
.
The
debts
amounted
to
*NL*
double
the
value
of
the
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friends
and
relations
advised
Nicholas
to
decline
the
inheritance
.
But
*NL*
he
regarded
such
a
refusal
as
a
slur
on
his
father
's
memory
,
which
he
*NL*
held
sacred
,
and
therefore
would
not
hear
of
refusing
and
accepted
the
*NL*
inheritance
together
with
the
obligation
to
pay
the
debts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
creditors
who
had
so
long
been
silent
,
restrained
by
a
vague
but
*NL*
powerful
influence
exerted
on
them
while
he
lived
by
the
count
's
*NL*
careless
good
nature
,
all
proceeded
to
enforce
their
claims
at
once
.
As
*NL*
always
happens
in
such
cases
rivalry
sprang
up
as
to
which
should
get
*NL*
paid
first
,
and
those
who
like
Mitenka
held
promissory
notes
given
them
*NL*
as
presents
now
became
the
most
exacting
of
the
creditors
.
Nicholas
was
*NL*
allowed
no
respite
and
no
peace
,
and
those
who
had
seemed
to
pity
the
*NL*
old
man
--
the
cause
of
their
losses
-LRB-
if
they
were
losses
-RRB-
--
now
*NL*
remorselessly
pursued
the
young
heir
who
had
voluntarily
undertaken
the
*NL*
debts
and
was
obviously
not
guilty
of
contracting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
one
of
the
plans
Nicholas
tried
succeeded
;
the
estate
was
sold
by
*NL*
auction
for
half
its
value
,
and
half
the
debts
still
remained
unpaid
.
*NL*
Nicholas
accepted
thirty
thousand
rubles
offered
him
by
his
brother-in
-
*NL*
law
Bezukhov
to
pay
off
debts
he
regarded
as
genuinely
due
for
value
*NL*
received
.
And
to
avoid
being
imprisoned
for
the
remainder
,
as
the
*NL*
creditors
threatened
,
he
re-entered
the
government
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
rejoin
the
army
where
he
would
have
been
made
colonel
at
*NL*
the
next
vacancy
,
for
his
mother
now
clung
to
him
as
her
one
hold
on
*NL*
life
;
and
so
despite
his
reluctance
to
remain
in
Moscow
among
people
who
*NL*
had
known
him
before
,
and
despite
his
abhorrence
of
the
civil
service
,
*NL*
he
accepted
a
post
in
Moscow
in
that
service
,
doffed
the
uniform
of
*NL*
which
he
was
so
fond
,
and
moved
with
his
mother
and
Sonya
to
a
small
*NL*
house
on
the
Sivtsev
Vrazhek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
and
Pierre
were
living
in
Petersburg
at
the
time
and
had
no
*NL*
clear
idea
of
Nicholas
'
circumstances
.
Having
borrowed
money
from
his
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
Nicholas
tried
to
hide
his
wretched
condition
from
him
.
*NL*
His
position
was
the
more
difficult
because
with
his
salary
of
twelve
*NL*
hundred
rubles
he
had
not
only
to
keep
himself
,
his
mother
,
and
Sonya
,
*NL*
but
had
to
shield
his
mother
from
knowledge
of
their
poverty
.
The
*NL*
countess
could
not
conceive
of
life
without
the
luxurious
conditions
she
*NL*
had
been
used
to
from
childhood
and
,
unable
to
realize
how
hard
it
was
*NL*
for
her
son
,
kept
demanding
now
a
carriage
-LRB-
which
they
did
not
keep
-RRB-
to
*NL*
send
for
a
friend
,
now
some
expensive
article
of
food
for
herself
,
or
*NL*
wine
for
her
son
,
or
money
to
buy
a
present
as
a
surprise
for
Natasha
or
*NL*
Sonya
,
or
for
Nicholas
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
kept
house
,
attended
on
her
aunt
,
read
to
her
,
put
up
with
her
*NL*
whims
and
secret
ill-will
,
and
helped
Nicholas
to
conceal
their
poverty
*NL*
from
the
old
countess
.
Nicholas
felt
himself
irredeemably
indebted
to
*NL*
Sonya
for
all
she
was
doing
for
his
mother
and
greatly
admired
her
*NL*
patience
and
devotion
,
but
tried
to
keep
aloof
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
in
his
heart
to
reproach
her
for
being
too
perfect
,
and
*NL*
because
there
was
nothing
to
reproach
her
with
.
She
had
all
that
people
*NL*
are
valued
for
,
but
little
that
could
have
made
him
love
her
.
He
felt
*NL*
that
the
more
he
valued
her
the
less
he
loved
her
.
He
had
taken
her
at
*NL*
her
word
when
she
wrote
giving
him
his
freedom
and
now
behaved
as
if
all
*NL*
that
had
passed
between
them
had
been
long
forgotten
and
could
never
in
*NL*
any
case
be
renewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
'
position
became
worse
and
worse
.
The
idea
of
putting
something
*NL*
aside
out
of
his
salary
proved
a
dream
.
Not
only
did
he
not
save
*NL*
anything
,
but
to
comply
with
his
mother
's
demands
he
even
incurred
some
*NL*
small
debts
.
He
could
see
no
way
out
of
this
situation
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
marrying
some
rich
woman
,
which
was
suggested
to
him
by
his
female
*NL*
relations
,
was
repugnant
to
him
.
The
other
way
out
--
his
mother
's
death
--
*NL*
never
entered
his
head
.
He
wished
for
nothing
and
hoped
for
nothing
,
and
*NL*
deep
in
his
heart
experienced
a
gloomy
and
stern
satisfaction
in
an
*NL*
uncomplaining
endurance
of
his
position
.
He
tried
to
avoid
his
old
*NL*
acquaintances
with
their
commiseration
and
offensive
offers
of
*NL*
assistance
;
he
avoided
all
distraction
and
recreation
,
and
even
at
home
*NL*
did
nothing
but
play
cards
with
his
mother
,
pace
silently
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
,
and
smoke
one
pipe
after
another
.
He
seemed
carefully
to
*NL*
cherish
within
himself
the
gloomy
mood
which
alone
enabled
him
to
endure
*NL*
his
position
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
winter
Princess
Mary
came
to
Moscow
.
From
reports
*NL*
current
in
town
she
learned
how
the
Rostovs
were
situated
,
and
how
``
the
*NL*
son
has
sacrificed
himself
for
his
mother
,
''
as
people
were
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
expected
anything
else
of
him
,
''
said
Princess
Mary
to
herself
,
*NL*
feeling
a
joyous
sense
of
her
love
for
him
.
Remembering
her
friendly
*NL*
relations
with
all
the
Rostovs
which
had
made
her
almost
a
member
of
the
*NL*
family
,
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
go
to
see
them
.
But
remembering
her
*NL*
relations
with
Nicholas
in
Voronezh
she
was
shy
about
doing
so
.
Making
a
*NL*
great
effort
she
did
however
go
to
call
on
them
a
few
weeks
after
her
*NL*
arrival
in
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
was
the
first
to
meet
her
,
as
the
countess
'
room
could
only
be
*NL*
reached
through
his
.
But
instead
of
being
greeted
with
pleasure
as
she
*NL*
had
expected
,
at
his
first
glance
at
her
his
face
assumed
a
cold
,
stiff
,
*NL*
proud
expression
she
had
not
seen
on
it
before
.
He
inquired
about
her
*NL*
health
,
led
the
way
to
his
mother
,
and
having
sat
there
for
five
minutes
*NL*
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
princess
came
out
of
the
countess
'
room
Nicholas
met
her
again
,
*NL*
and
with
marked
solemnity
and
stiffness
accompanied
her
to
the
anteroom
.
*NL*
To
her
remarks
about
his
mother
's
health
he
made
no
reply
.
``
What
's
that
*NL*
to
you
?
Leave
me
in
peace
,
''
his
looks
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
she
come
prowling
here
?
What
does
she
want
?
I
ca
n't
bear
these
*NL*
ladies
and
all
these
civilities
!
''
said
he
aloud
in
Sonya
's
presence
,
*NL*
evidently
unable
to
repress
his
vexation
,
after
the
princess
'
carriage
*NL*
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Nicholas
,
how
can
you
talk
like
that
?
''
cried
Sonya
,
hardly
able
to
*NL*
conceal
her
delight
.
``
She
is
so
kind
and
Mamma
is
so
fond
of
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
did
not
reply
and
tried
to
avoid
speaking
of
the
princess
any
*NL*
more
.
But
after
her
visit
the
old
countess
spoke
of
her
several
times
a
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sang
her
praises
,
insisted
that
her
son
must
call
on
her
,
expressed
*NL*
a
wish
to
see
her
often
,
but
yet
always
became
ill-humored
when
she
*NL*
began
to
talk
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
tried
to
keep
silence
when
his
mother
spoke
of
the
princess
,
*NL*
but
his
silence
irritated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
very
admirable
and
excellent
young
woman
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
you
*NL*
must
go
and
call
on
her
.
You
would
at
least
be
seeing
somebody
,
and
I
*NL*
think
it
must
be
dull
for
you
only
seeing
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
in
the
least
want
to
,
Mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
want
to
,
and
now
you
do
n't
.
Really
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
*NL*
my
dear
.
One
day
you
are
dull
,
and
the
next
you
refuse
to
see
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
never
said
I
was
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
said
yourself
you
do
n't
want
even
to
see
her
.
She
is
a
very
*NL*
admirable
young
woman
and
you
always
liked
her
,
but
now
suddenly
you
*NL*
have
got
some
notion
or
other
in
your
head
.
You
hide
everything
from
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
Mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
asking
you
to
do
something
disagreeable
now
--
but
I
only
ask
*NL*
you
to
return
a
call
.
One
would
think
mere
politeness
required
it
...
*NL*
Well
,
I
have
asked
you
,
and
now
I
wo
n't
interfere
any
more
since
you
*NL*
have
secrets
from
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
go
if
you
wish
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
to
me
.
I
only
wish
it
for
your
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
sighed
,
bit
his
mustache
,
and
laid
out
the
cards
for
a
*NL*
patience
,
trying
to
divert
his
mother
's
attention
to
another
topic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
conversation
was
repeated
next
day
and
the
day
after
,
and
the
*NL*
day
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
her
visit
to
the
Rostovs
and
her
unexpectedly
chilly
reception
by
*NL*
Nicholas
,
Princess
Mary
confessed
to
herself
that
she
had
been
right
in
*NL*
not
wishing
to
be
the
first
to
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
nothing
else
,
''
she
told
herself
,
calling
her
pride
to
her
*NL*
aid
.
``
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
I
only
wanted
to
see
the
old
*NL*
lady
,
who
was
always
kind
to
me
and
to
whom
I
am
under
many
*NL*
obligations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
not
pacify
herself
with
these
reflections
;
a
feeling
akin
*NL*
to
remorse
troubled
her
when
she
thought
of
her
visit
.
Though
she
had
*NL*
firmly
resolved
not
to
call
on
the
Rostovs
again
and
to
forget
the
whole
*NL*
matter
,
she
felt
herself
all
the
time
in
an
awkward
position
.
And
when
*NL*
she
asked
herself
what
distressed
her
,
she
had
to
admit
that
it
was
her
*NL*
relation
to
Rostov
.
His
cold
,
polite
manner
did
not
express
his
feeling
*NL*
for
her
-LRB-
she
knew
that
-RRB-
but
it
concealed
something
,
and
until
she
could
*NL*
discover
what
that
something
was
,
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
at
*NL*
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
midwinter
when
sitting
in
the
schoolroom
attending
to
her
*NL*
nephew
's
lessons
,
she
was
informed
that
Rostov
had
called
.
With
a
firm
*NL*
resolution
not
to
betray
herself
and
not
show
her
agitation
,
she
sent
*NL*
for
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
went
with
her
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
glance
at
Nicholas
'
face
told
her
that
he
had
only
come
to
*NL*
fulfill
the
demands
of
politeness
,
and
she
firmly
resolved
to
maintain
*NL*
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
spoke
of
the
countess
'
health
,
of
their
mutual
friends
,
of
the
*NL*
latest
war
news
,
and
when
the
ten
minutes
required
by
propriety
had
*NL*
elapsed
after
which
a
visitor
may
rise
,
Nicholas
got
up
to
say
good-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
's
help
the
princess
had
maintained
the
*NL*
conversation
very
well
,
but
at
the
very
last
moment
,
just
when
he
rose
,
*NL*
she
was
so
tired
of
talking
of
what
did
not
interest
her
,
and
her
mind
*NL*
was
so
full
of
the
question
why
she
alone
was
granted
so
little
*NL*
happiness
in
life
,
that
in
a
fit
of
absent-mindedness
she
sat
still
,
her
*NL*
luminous
eyes
gazing
fixedly
before
her
,
not
noticing
that
he
had
risen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
glanced
at
her
and
,
wishing
to
appear
not
to
notice
her
*NL*
abstraction
,
made
some
remark
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
then
again
*NL*
looked
at
the
princess
.
She
still
sat
motionless
with
a
look
of
*NL*
suffering
on
her
gentle
face
.
He
suddenly
felt
sorry
for
her
and
was
*NL*
vaguely
conscious
that
he
might
be
the
cause
of
the
sadness
her
face
*NL*
expressed
.
He
wished
to
help
her
and
say
something
pleasant
,
but
could
*NL*
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Princess
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
,
flushed
,
and
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
she
said
as
if
waking
up
.
``
Are
you
going
*NL*
already
,
Count
?
Well
then
,
good-by
!
Oh
,
but
the
cushion
for
the
*NL*
countess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
I
'll
fetch
it
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
,
and
she
*NL*
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
sat
silent
,
with
an
occasional
glance
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Princess
,
''
said
Nicholas
at
last
with
a
sad
smile
,
``
it
does
n't
*NL*
seem
long
ago
since
we
first
met
at
Bogucharovo
,
but
how
much
water
has
*NL*
flowed
since
then
!
In
what
distress
we
all
seemed
to
be
then
,
yet
I
*NL*
would
give
much
to
bring
back
that
time
...
but
there
's
no
bringing
it
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Mary
gazed
intently
into
his
eyes
with
her
own
luminous
ones
as
*NL*
he
said
this
.
She
seemed
to
be
trying
to
fathom
the
hidden
meaning
of
*NL*
his
words
which
would
explain
his
feeling
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
she
,
``
but
you
have
no
reason
to
regret
the
past
,
Count
.
*NL*
As
I
understand
your
present
life
,
I
think
you
will
always
recall
it
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
because
the
self-sacrifice
that
fills
it
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
accept
your
praise
,
''
he
interrupted
her
hurriedly
.
``
On
the
*NL*
contrary
I
continually
reproach
myself
...
But
this
is
not
at
all
an
*NL*
interesting
or
cheerful
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
again
resumed
its
former
stiff
and
cold
expression
.
But
the
*NL*
princess
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
man
she
had
known
and
loved
,
and
it
*NL*
was
to
him
that
she
now
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
allow
me
to
tell
you
this
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
had
come
*NL*
so
near
to
you
...
and
to
all
your
family
that
I
thought
you
would
not
*NL*
consider
my
sympathy
misplaced
,
but
I
was
mistaken
,
''
and
suddenly
her
*NL*
voice
trembled
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
,
''
she
continued
,
recovering
herself
,
*NL*
``
but
you
used
to
be
different
,
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
a
thousand
reasons
why
,
''
laying
special
emphasis
on
the
why
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Princess
,
''
he
added
softly
.
``
Sometimes
it
is
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
why
!
That
's
why
!
''
a
voice
whispered
in
Princess
Mary
's
soul
.
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
not
only
that
gay
,
kind
,
and
frank
look
,
not
only
that
*NL*
handsome
exterior
,
that
I
loved
in
him
.
I
divined
his
noble
,
resolute
,
*NL*
self-sacrificing
spirit
too
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
Yes
,
he
is
poor
now
*NL*
and
I
am
rich
...
Yes
,
that
's
the
only
reason
...
Yes
,
were
it
not
for
*NL*
that
...
''
And
remembering
his
former
tenderness
,
and
looking
now
at
his
*NL*
kind
,
sorrowful
face
,
she
suddenly
understood
the
cause
of
his
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
Count
,
why
?
''
she
almost
cried
,
unconsciously
moving
closer
to
*NL*
him
.
``
Why
?
Tell
me
.
You
must
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
your
why
,
Count
,
''
she
continued
,
``
but
it
's
hard
for
*NL*
me
...
I
confess
it
.
For
some
reason
you
wish
to
deprive
me
of
our
former
*NL*
friendship
.
And
that
hurts
me
.
''
There
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
*NL*
voice
.
``
I
have
had
so
little
happiness
in
life
that
every
loss
is
hard
*NL*
for
me
to
bear
...
Excuse
me
,
good-by
!
''
and
suddenly
she
began
to
cry
*NL*
and
was
hurrying
from
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
trying
to
stop
her
.
*NL*
``
Princess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
round
.
For
a
few
seconds
they
gazed
silently
into
one
*NL*
another
's
eyes
--
and
what
had
seemed
impossible
and
remote
suddenly
*NL*
became
possible
,
inevitable
,
and
very
near
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
winter
of
1813
Nicholas
married
Princess
Mary
and
moved
to
Bald
*NL*
Hills
with
his
wife
,
his
mother
,
and
Sonya
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
four
years
he
had
paid
off
all
his
remaining
debts
without
*NL*
selling
any
of
his
wife
's
property
,
and
having
received
a
small
*NL*
inheritance
on
the
death
of
a
cousin
he
paid
his
debt
to
Pierre
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
three
years
,
by
1820
,
he
had
so
managed
his
affairs
that
he
*NL*
was
able
to
buy
a
small
estate
adjoining
Bald
Hills
and
was
negotiating
*NL*
to
buy
back
Otradnoe
--
that
being
his
pet
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
started
farming
from
necessity
,
he
soon
grew
so
devoted
to
it
*NL*
that
it
became
his
favorite
and
almost
his
sole
occupation
.
Nicholas
was
*NL*
a
plain
farmer
:
he
did
not
like
innovations
,
especially
the
English
ones
*NL*
then
coming
into
vogue
.
He
laughed
at
theoretical
treatises
on
estate
*NL*
management
,
disliked
factories
,
the
raising
of
expensive
products
,
and
*NL*
the
buying
of
expensive
seed
corn
,
and
did
not
make
a
hobby
of
any
*NL*
particular
part
of
the
work
on
his
estate
.
He
always
had
before
his
*NL*
mind
's
eye
the
estate
as
a
whole
and
not
any
particular
part
of
it
.
The
*NL*
chief
thing
in
his
eyes
was
not
the
nitrogen
in
the
soil
,
nor
the
oxygen
*NL*
in
the
air
,
nor
manures
,
nor
special
plows
,
but
that
most
important
*NL*
agent
by
which
nitrogen
,
oxygen
,
manure
,
and
plow
were
made
effective
--
*NL*
the
peasant
laborer
.
When
Nicholas
first
began
farming
and
began
to
*NL*
understand
its
different
branches
,
it
was
the
serf
who
especially
*NL*
attracted
his
attention
.
The
peasant
seemed
to
him
not
merely
a
tool
,
*NL*
but
also
a
judge
of
farming
and
an
end
in
himself
.
At
first
he
watched
*NL*
the
serfs
,
trying
to
understand
their
aims
and
what
they
considered
good
*NL*
and
bad
,
and
only
pretended
to
direct
them
and
give
orders
while
in
*NL*
reality
learning
from
them
their
methods
,
their
manner
of
speech
,
and
*NL*
their
judgment
of
what
was
good
and
bad
.
Only
when
he
had
understood
the
*NL*
peasants
'
tastes
and
aspirations
,
had
learned
to
talk
their
language
,
to
*NL*
grasp
the
hidden
meaning
of
their
words
,
and
felt
akin
to
them
did
he
*NL*
begin
boldly
to
manage
his
serfs
,
that
is
,
to
perform
toward
them
the
*NL*
duties
demanded
of
him
.
And
Nicholas
'
management
produced
very
brilliant
*NL*
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guided
by
some
gift
of
insight
,
on
taking
up
the
management
of
the
*NL*
estates
he
at
once
unerringly
appointed
as
bailiff
,
village
elder
,
and
*NL*
delegate
,
the
very
men
the
serfs
would
themselves
have
chosen
had
they
*NL*
had
the
right
to
choose
,
and
these
posts
never
changed
hands
.
Before
*NL*
analyzing
the
properties
of
manure
,
before
entering
into
the
debit
and
*NL*
credit
-LRB-
as
he
ironically
called
it
-RRB-
,
he
found
out
how
many
cattle
the
*NL*
peasants
had
and
increased
the
number
by
all
possible
means
.
He
kept
the
*NL*
peasant
families
together
in
the
largest
groups
possible
,
not
allowing
*NL*
the
family
groups
to
divide
into
separate
households
.
He
was
hard
alike
*NL*
on
the
lazy
,
the
depraved
,
and
the
weak
,
and
tried
to
get
them
expelled
*NL*
from
the
commune
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
as
careful
of
the
sowing
and
reaping
of
the
peasants
'
hay
and
*NL*
corn
as
of
his
own
,
and
few
landowners
had
their
crops
sown
and
*NL*
harvested
so
early
and
so
well
,
or
got
so
good
a
return
,
as
did
*NL*
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
disliked
having
anything
to
do
with
the
domestic
serfs
--
the
``
drones
''
*NL*
as
he
called
them
--
and
everyone
said
he
spoiled
them
by
his
laxity
.
When
*NL*
a
decision
had
to
be
taken
regarding
a
domestic
serf
,
especially
if
one
*NL*
had
to
be
punished
,
he
always
felt
undecided
and
consulted
everybody
in
*NL*
the
house
;
but
when
it
was
possible
to
have
a
domestic
serf
conscripted
*NL*
instead
of
a
land
worker
he
did
so
without
the
least
hesitation
.
He
*NL*
never
felt
any
hesitation
in
dealing
with
the
peasants
.
He
knew
that
his
*NL*
every
decision
would
be
approved
by
them
all
with
very
few
exceptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
allow
himself
either
to
be
hard
on
or
punish
a
man
,
or
to
*NL*
make
things
easy
for
or
reward
anyone
,
merely
because
he
felt
inclined
*NL*
to
do
so
.
He
could
not
have
said
by
what
standard
he
judged
what
he
*NL*
should
or
should
not
do
,
but
the
standard
was
quite
firm
and
definite
in
*NL*
his
own
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
speaking
with
vexation
of
some
failure
or
irregularity
,
he
would
*NL*
say
:
``
What
can
one
do
with
our
Russian
peasants
?
''
and
imagined
that
he
*NL*
could
not
bear
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
loved
``
our
Russian
peasants
''
and
their
way
of
life
with
his
whole
*NL*
soul
,
and
for
that
very
reason
had
understood
and
assimilated
the
one
*NL*
way
and
manner
of
farming
which
produced
good
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
was
jealous
of
this
passion
of
her
husband
's
and
regretted
*NL*
that
she
could
not
share
it
;
but
she
could
not
understand
the
joys
and
*NL*
vexations
he
derived
from
that
world
,
to
her
so
remote
and
alien
.
She
*NL*
could
not
understand
why
he
was
so
particularly
animated
and
happy
when
,
*NL*
after
getting
up
at
daybreak
and
spending
the
whole
morning
in
the
*NL*
fields
or
on
the
threshing
floor
,
he
returned
from
the
sowing
or
mowing
*NL*
or
reaping
to
have
tea
with
her
.
She
did
not
understand
why
he
spoke
*NL*
with
such
admiration
and
delight
of
the
farming
of
the
thrifty
and
well
-
*NL*
to-do
peasant
Matthew
Ermishin
,
who
with
his
family
had
carted
corn
all
*NL*
night
;
or
of
the
fact
that
his
-LRB-
Nicholas
'
-RRB-
sheaves
were
already
stacked
*NL*
before
anyone
else
had
his
harvest
in
.
She
did
not
understand
why
he
*NL*
stepped
out
from
the
window
to
the
veranda
and
smiled
under
his
mustache
*NL*
and
winked
so
joyfully
,
when
warm
steady
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
dry
*NL*
and
thirsty
shoots
of
the
young
oats
,
or
why
when
the
wind
carried
away
*NL*
a
threatening
cloud
during
the
hay
harvest
he
would
return
from
the
*NL*
barn
,
flushed
,
sunburned
,
and
perspiring
,
with
a
smell
of
wormwood
and
*NL*
gentian
in
his
hair
and
,
gleefully
rubbing
his
hands
,
would
say
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
one
more
day
and
my
grain
and
the
peasants
'
will
all
be
under
cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
less
did
she
understand
why
he
,
kindhearted
and
always
ready
to
*NL*
anticipate
her
wishes
,
should
become
almost
desperate
when
she
brought
*NL*
him
a
petition
from
some
peasant
men
or
women
who
had
appealed
to
her
to
*NL*
be
excused
some
work
;
why
he
,
that
kind
Nicholas
,
should
obstinately
*NL*
refuse
her
,
angrily
asking
her
not
to
interfere
in
what
was
not
her
*NL*
business
.
She
felt
he
had
a
world
apart
,
which
he
loved
passionately
and
*NL*
which
had
laws
she
had
not
fathomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
when
,
trying
to
understand
him
,
she
spoke
of
the
good
work
he
*NL*
was
doing
for
his
serfs
,
he
would
be
vexed
and
reply
:
``
Not
in
the
least
;
*NL*
it
never
entered
my
head
and
I
would
n't
do
that
for
their
good
!
That
's
*NL*
all
poetry
and
old
wives
'
talk
--
all
that
doing
good
to
one
's
neighbor
!
*NL*
What
I
want
is
that
our
children
should
not
have
to
go
begging
.
I
must
*NL*
put
our
affairs
in
order
while
I
am
alive
,
that
's
all
.
And
to
do
that
,
*NL*
order
and
strictness
are
essential
...
That
's
all
about
it
!
''
said
he
,
*NL*
clenching
his
vigorous
fist
.
``
And
fairness
,
of
course
,
''
he
added
,
``
for
*NL*
if
the
peasant
is
naked
and
hungry
and
has
only
one
miserable
horse
,
he
*NL*
can
do
no
good
either
for
himself
or
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
Nicholas
did
was
fruitful
--
probably
just
because
he
refused
to
*NL*
allow
himself
to
think
that
he
was
doing
good
to
others
for
virtue
's
*NL*
sake
.
His
means
increased
rapidly
;
serfs
from
neighboring
estates
came
*NL*
to
beg
him
to
buy
them
,
and
long
after
his
death
the
memory
of
his
*NL*
administration
was
devoutly
preserved
among
the
serfs
.
``
He
was
a
*NL*
master
...
the
peasants
'
affairs
first
and
then
his
own
.
Of
course
he
was
*NL*
not
to
be
trifled
with
either
--
in
a
word
,
he
was
a
real
master
!

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
One
matter
connected
with
his
management
sometimes
worried
Nicholas
,
and
*NL*
that
was
his
quick
temper
together
with
his
old
hussar
habit
of
making
*NL*
free
use
of
his
fists
.
At
first
he
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
this
,
*NL*
but
in
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
his
view
of
that
form
of
*NL*
punishment
suddenly
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
summer
he
had
sent
for
the
village
elder
from
Bogucharovo
,
a
man
*NL*
who
had
succeeded
to
the
post
when
Dron
died
and
who
was
accused
of
*NL*
dishonesty
and
various
irregularities
.
Nicholas
went
out
into
the
porch
*NL*
to
question
him
,
and
immediately
after
the
elder
had
given
a
few
replies
*NL*
the
sound
of
cries
and
blows
were
heard
.
On
returning
to
lunch
Nicholas
*NL*
went
up
to
his
wife
,
who
sat
with
her
head
bent
low
over
her
embroidery
*NL*
frame
,
and
as
usual
began
to
tell
her
what
he
had
been
doing
that
*NL*
morning
.
Among
other
things
he
spoke
of
the
Bogucharovo
elder
.
Countess
*NL*
Mary
turned
red
and
then
pale
,
but
continued
to
sit
with
head
bowed
and
*NL*
lips
compressed
and
gave
her
husband
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
an
insolent
scoundrel
!
''
he
cried
,
growing
hot
again
at
the
mere
*NL*
recollection
of
him
.
``
If
he
had
told
me
he
was
drunk
and
did
not
see
...
*NL*
But
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
Mary
?
''
he
suddenly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
raised
her
head
and
tried
to
speak
,
but
hastily
looked
*NL*
down
again
and
her
lips
puckered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
whatever
is
the
matter
,
my
dearest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
looks
of
the
plain
Countess
Mary
always
improved
when
she
was
in
*NL*
tears
.
She
never
cried
from
pain
or
vexation
,
but
always
from
sorrow
or
*NL*
pity
,
and
when
she
wept
her
radiant
eyes
acquired
an
irresistible
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Nicholas
took
her
hand
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
*NL*
and
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
I
saw
it
...
he
was
to
blame
,
but
why
do
you
...
Nicholas
!
''
and
*NL*
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
said
nothing
.
He
flushed
crimson
,
left
her
side
,
and
paced
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
.
He
understood
what
she
was
weeping
about
,
but
could
*NL*
not
in
his
heart
at
once
agree
with
her
that
what
he
had
regarded
from
*NL*
childhood
as
quite
an
everyday
event
was
wrong
.
``
Is
it
just
*NL*
sentimentality
,
old
wives
'
tales
,
or
is
she
right
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
*NL*
Before
he
had
solved
that
point
he
glanced
again
at
her
face
filled
with
*NL*
love
and
pain
,
and
he
suddenly
realized
that
she
was
right
and
that
he
*NL*
had
long
been
sinning
against
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
''
he
said
softly
,
going
up
to
her
,
``
it
will
never
happen
again
;
I
*NL*
give
you
my
word
.
Never
,
''
he
repeated
in
a
trembling
voice
like
a
boy
*NL*
asking
for
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
flowed
faster
still
from
the
countess
'
eyes
.
She
took
his
hand
*NL*
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
,
when
did
you
break
your
cameo
?
''
she
asked
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
,
looking
at
his
finger
on
which
he
wore
a
ring
with
a
cameo
of
*NL*
Laocoon
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Today
--
it
was
the
same
affair
.
Oh
,
Mary
,
do
n't
remind
me
of
it
!
''
and
*NL*
again
he
flushed
.
``
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
it
sha
n't
occur
again
,
*NL*
and
let
this
always
be
a
reminder
to
me
,
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
broken
*NL*
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
when
in
discussions
with
his
village
elders
or
stewards
the
*NL*
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
his
fists
began
to
clench
,
Nicholas
would
*NL*
turn
the
broken
ring
on
his
finger
and
would
drop
his
eyes
before
the
*NL*
man
who
was
making
him
angry
.
But
he
did
forget
himself
once
or
twice
*NL*
within
a
twelvemonth
,
and
then
he
would
go
and
confess
to
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
would
again
promise
that
this
should
really
be
the
very
last
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
you
must
despise
me
!
''
he
would
say
.
``
I
deserve
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
go
,
go
away
at
once
,
if
you
do
n't
feel
strong
enough
to
*NL*
control
yourself
,
''
she
would
reply
sadly
,
trying
to
comfort
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
gentry
of
the
province
Nicholas
was
respected
but
not
liked
.
*NL*
He
did
not
concern
himself
with
the
interests
of
his
own
class
,
and
*NL*
consequently
some
thought
him
proud
and
others
thought
him
stupid
.
The
*NL*
whole
summer
,
from
spring
sowing
to
harvest
,
he
was
busy
with
the
work
*NL*
on
his
farm
.
In
autumn
he
gave
himself
up
to
hunting
with
the
same
*NL*
business-like
seriousness
--
leaving
home
for
a
month
,
or
even
two
,
with
*NL*
his
hunt
.
In
winter
he
visited
his
other
villages
or
spent
his
time
*NL*
reading
.
The
books
he
read
were
chiefly
historical
,
and
on
these
he
*NL*
spent
a
certain
sum
every
year
.
He
was
collecting
,
as
he
said
,
a
serious
*NL*
library
,
and
he
made
it
a
rule
to
read
through
all
the
books
he
bought
.
*NL*
He
would
sit
in
his
study
with
a
grave
air
,
reading
--
a
task
he
first
*NL*
imposed
upon
himself
as
a
duty
,
but
which
afterwards
became
a
habit
*NL*
affording
him
a
special
kind
of
pleasure
and
a
consciousness
of
being
*NL*
occupied
with
serious
matters
.
In
winter
,
except
for
business
*NL*
excursions
,
he
spent
most
of
his
time
at
home
making
himself
one
with
*NL*
his
family
and
entering
into
all
the
details
of
his
children
's
relations
*NL*
with
their
mother
.
The
harmony
between
him
and
his
wife
grew
closer
and
*NL*
closer
and
he
daily
discovered
fresh
spiritual
treasures
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
time
of
his
marriage
Sonya
had
lived
in
his
house
.
Before
that
,
*NL*
Nicholas
had
told
his
wife
all
that
had
passed
between
himself
and
*NL*
Sonya
,
blaming
himself
and
commending
her
.
He
had
asked
Princess
Mary
to
*NL*
be
gentle
and
kind
to
his
cousin
.
She
thoroughly
realized
the
wrong
he
*NL*
had
done
Sonya
,
felt
herself
to
blame
toward
her
,
and
imagined
that
her
*NL*
wealth
had
influenced
Nicholas
'
choice
.
She
could
not
find
fault
with
*NL*
Sonya
in
any
way
and
tried
to
be
fond
of
her
,
but
often
felt
ill-will
*NL*
toward
her
which
she
could
not
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
had
a
talk
with
her
friend
Natasha
about
Sonya
and
about
her
*NL*
own
injustice
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
said
Natasha
,
``
you
have
read
the
Gospels
a
great
deal
--
there
*NL*
is
a
passage
in
them
that
just
fits
Sonya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Countess
Mary
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
To
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
,
and
from
him
that
hath
not
shall
be
*NL*
taken
away
.
'
You
remember
?
She
is
one
that
hath
not
;
why
,
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
Perhaps
she
lacks
egotism
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
from
her
is
taken
away
,
and
*NL*
everything
has
been
taken
away
.
Sometimes
I
am
dreadfully
sorry
for
her
.
*NL*
Formerly
I
very
much
wanted
Nicholas
to
marry
her
,
but
I
always
had
a
*NL*
sort
of
presentiment
that
it
would
not
come
off
.
She
is
a
sterile
*NL*
flower
,
you
know
--
like
some
strawberry
blossoms
.
Sometimes
I
am
sorry
*NL*
for
her
,
and
sometimes
I
think
she
does
n't
feel
it
as
you
or
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Countess
Mary
told
Natasha
that
those
words
in
the
Gospel
must
be
*NL*
understood
differently
,
yet
looking
at
Sonya
she
agreed
with
Natasha
's
*NL*
explanation
.
It
really
seemed
that
Sonya
did
not
feel
her
position
*NL*
trying
,
and
had
grown
quite
reconciled
to
her
lot
as
a
sterile
flower
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
fond
not
so
much
of
individuals
as
of
the
family
as
a
*NL*
whole
.
Like
a
cat
,
she
had
attached
herself
not
to
the
people
but
to
the
*NL*
home
.
She
waited
on
the
old
countess
,
petted
and
spoiled
the
children
,
*NL*
was
always
ready
to
render
the
small
services
for
which
she
had
a
gift
,
*NL*
and
all
this
was
unconsciously
accepted
from
her
with
insufficient
*NL*
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
country
seat
at
Bald
Hills
had
been
rebuilt
,
though
not
on
the
same
*NL*
scale
as
under
the
old
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
buildings
,
begun
under
straitened
circumstances
,
were
more
than
*NL*
simple
.
The
immense
house
on
the
old
stone
foundations
was
of
wood
,
*NL*
plastered
only
inside
.
It
had
bare
deal
floors
and
was
furnished
with
*NL*
very
simple
hard
sofas
,
armchairs
,
tables
,
and
chairs
made
by
their
own
*NL*
serf
carpenters
out
of
their
own
birchwood
.
The
house
was
spacious
and
*NL*
had
rooms
for
the
house
serfs
and
apartments
for
visitors
.
Whole
*NL*
families
of
the
Rostovs
'
and
Bolkonskis
'
relations
sometimes
came
to
*NL*
Bald
Hills
with
sixteen
horses
and
dozens
of
servants
and
stayed
for
*NL*
months
.
Besides
that
,
four
times
a
year
,
on
the
name
days
and
birthdays
*NL*
of
the
hosts
,
as
many
as
a
hundred
visitors
would
gather
there
for
a
day
*NL*
or
two
.
The
rest
of
the
year
life
pursued
its
unbroken
routine
with
its
*NL*
ordinary
occupations
,
and
its
breakfasts
,
lunches
,
dinners
,
and
suppers
,
*NL*
provided
out
of
the
produce
of
the
estate
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
eve
of
St.
Nicholas
,
the
fifth
of
December
,
1820
.
Natasha
had
*NL*
been
staying
at
her
brother
's
with
her
husband
and
children
since
early
*NL*
autumn
.
Pierre
had
gone
to
Petersburg
on
business
of
his
own
for
three
*NL*
weeks
as
he
said
,
but
had
remained
there
nearly
seven
weeks
and
was
*NL*
expected
back
every
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
Bezukhov
family
,
Nicholas
'
old
friend
the
retired
General
*NL*
Vasili
Dmitrich
Denisov
was
staying
with
the
Rostovs
this
fifth
of
*NL*
December
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sixth
,
which
was
his
name
day
when
the
house
would
be
full
of
*NL*
visitors
,
Nicholas
knew
he
would
have
to
exchange
his
Tartar
tunic
for
a
*NL*
tail
coat
,
and
put
on
narrow
boots
with
pointed
toes
,
and
drive
to
the
*NL*
new
church
he
had
built
,
and
then
receive
visitors
who
would
come
to
*NL*
congratulate
him
,
offer
them
refreshments
,
and
talk
about
the
elections
*NL*
of
the
nobility
;
but
he
considered
himself
entitled
to
spend
the
eve
of
*NL*
that
day
in
his
usual
way
.
He
examined
the
bailiff
's
accounts
of
the
*NL*
village
in
Ryazan
which
belonged
to
his
wife
's
nephew
,
wrote
two
*NL*
business
letters
,
and
walked
over
to
the
granaries
,
cattle
yards
and
*NL*
stables
before
dinner
.
Having
taken
precautions
against
the
general
*NL*
drunkenness
to
be
expected
on
the
morrow
because
it
was
a
great
saint
's
*NL*
day
,
he
returned
to
dinner
,
and
without
having
time
for
a
private
talk
*NL*
with
his
wife
sat
down
at
the
long
table
laid
for
twenty
persons
,
at
*NL*
which
the
whole
household
had
assembled
.
At
that
table
were
his
mother
,
*NL*
his
mother
's
old
lady
companion
Belova
,
his
wife
,
their
three
children
*NL*
with
their
governess
and
tutor
,
his
wife
's
nephew
with
his
tutor
,
Sonya
,
*NL*
Denisov
,
Natasha
,
her
three
children
,
their
governess
,
and
old
Michael
*NL*
Ivanovich
,
the
late
prince
's
architect
,
who
was
living
on
in
retirement
*NL*
at
Bald
Hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
When
her
husband
took
*NL*
his
place
she
concluded
,
from
the
rapid
manner
in
which
after
taking
up
*NL*
his
table
napkin
he
pushed
back
the
tumbler
and
wineglass
standing
*NL*
before
him
,
that
he
was
out
of
humor
,
as
was
sometimes
the
case
when
he
*NL*
came
in
to
dinner
straight
from
the
farm
--
especially
before
the
soup
.
*NL*
Countess
Mary
well
knew
that
mood
of
his
,
and
when
she
herself
was
in
a
*NL*
good
frame
of
mind
quietly
waited
till
he
had
had
his
soup
and
then
*NL*
began
to
talk
to
him
and
make
him
admit
that
there
was
no
cause
for
his
*NL*
ill-humor
.
But
today
she
quite
forgot
that
and
was
hurt
that
he
should
*NL*
be
angry
with
her
without
any
reason
,
and
she
felt
unhappy
.
She
asked
*NL*
him
where
he
had
been
.
He
replied
.
She
again
inquired
whether
everything
*NL*
was
going
well
on
the
farm
.
Her
unnatural
tone
made
him
wince
*NL*
unpleasantly
and
he
replied
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'm
not
mistaken
,
''
thought
Countess
Mary
.
``
Why
is
he
cross
with
*NL*
me
?
''
She
concluded
from
his
tone
that
he
was
vexed
with
her
and
wished
*NL*
to
end
the
conversation
.
She
knew
her
remarks
sounded
unnatural
,
but
*NL*
could
not
refrain
from
asking
some
more
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
Denisov
the
conversation
at
table
soon
became
general
and
*NL*
lively
,
and
she
did
not
talk
to
her
husband
.
When
they
left
the
table
*NL*
and
went
as
usual
to
thank
the
old
countess
,
Countess
Mary
held
out
her
*NL*
hand
and
kissed
her
husband
,
and
asked
him
why
he
was
angry
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
have
such
strange
fancies
!
I
did
n't
even
think
of
being
*NL*
angry
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
word
always
seemed
to
her
to
imply
:
``
Yes
,
I
am
angry
but
I
wo
n't
*NL*
tell
you
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
and
his
wife
lived
together
so
happily
that
even
Sonya
and
the
*NL*
old
countess
,
who
felt
jealous
and
would
have
liked
them
to
disagree
,
*NL*
could
find
nothing
to
reproach
them
with
;
but
even
they
had
their
*NL*
moments
of
antagonism
.
Occasionally
,
and
it
was
always
just
after
they
*NL*
had
been
happiest
together
,
they
suddenly
had
a
feeling
of
estrangement
*NL*
and
hostility
,
which
occurred
most
frequently
during
Countess
Mary
's
*NL*
pregnancies
,
and
this
was
such
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
messieurs
et
mesdames
,
''
said
Nicholas
loudly
and
with
apparent
*NL*
cheerfulness
-LRB-
it
seemed
to
Countess
Mary
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
to
*NL*
vex
her
-RRB-
,
``
I
have
been
on
my
feet
since
six
this
morning
.
Tomorrow
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
suffer
,
so
today
I
'll
go
and
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
a
word
to
his
wife
he
went
to
the
little
sitting
room
and
*NL*
lay
down
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
always
the
way
,
''
thought
Countess
Mary
.
``
He
talks
to
everyone
*NL*
except
me
.
I
see
...
I
see
that
I
am
repulsive
to
him
,
especially
when
I
*NL*
am
in
this
condition
.
''
She
looked
down
at
her
expanded
figure
and
in
the
*NL*
glass
at
her
pale
,
sallow
,
emaciated
face
in
which
her
eyes
now
looked
*NL*
larger
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
everything
annoyed
her
--
Denisov
's
shouting
and
laughter
,
Natasha
's
*NL*
talk
,
and
especially
a
quick
glance
Sonya
gave
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sonya
was
always
the
first
excuse
Countess
Mary
found
for
feeling
*NL*
irritated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
sat
awhile
with
her
visitors
without
understanding
anything
of
*NL*
what
they
were
saying
,
she
softly
left
the
room
and
went
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
were
playing
at
``
going
to
Moscow
''
in
a
carriage
made
of
*NL*
chairs
and
invited
her
to
go
with
them
.
She
sat
down
and
played
with
*NL*
them
a
little
,
but
the
thought
of
her
husband
and
his
unreasonable
*NL*
crossness
worried
her
.
She
got
up
and
,
walking
on
tiptoe
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
went
to
the
small
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
not
asleep
;
I
'll
have
an
explanation
with
him
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
herself
.
Little
Andrew
,
her
eldest
boy
,
imitating
his
mother
,
*NL*
followed
her
on
tiptoe
.
She
did
not
notice
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
dear
,
I
think
he
is
asleep
--
he
was
so
tired
,
''
said
Sonya
,
meeting
*NL*
her
in
the
large
sitting
room
-LRB-
it
seemed
to
Countess
Mary
that
she
*NL*
crossed
her
path
everywhere
-RRB-
.
``
Andrew
may
wake
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
looked
round
,
saw
little
Andrew
following
her
,
felt
that
*NL*
Sonya
was
right
,
and
for
that
very
reason
flushed
and
with
evident
*NL*
difficulty
refrained
from
saying
something
harsh
.
She
made
no
reply
,
but
*NL*
to
avoid
obeying
Sonya
beckoned
to
Andrew
to
follow
her
quietly
and
went
*NL*
to
the
door
.
Sonya
went
away
by
another
door
.
From
the
room
in
which
*NL*
Nicholas
was
sleeping
came
the
sound
of
his
even
breathing
,
every
*NL*
slightest
tone
of
which
was
familiar
to
his
wife
.
As
she
listened
to
it
*NL*
she
saw
before
her
his
smooth
handsome
forehead
,
his
mustache
,
and
his
*NL*
whole
face
,
as
she
had
so
often
seen
it
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
*NL*
when
he
slept
.
Nicholas
suddenly
moved
and
cleared
his
throat
.
And
at
*NL*
that
moment
little
Andrew
shouted
from
outside
the
door
:
``
Papa
!
Mamma
's
*NL*
standing
here
!
''
Countess
Mary
turned
pale
with
fright
and
made
signs
to
*NL*
the
boy
.
He
grew
silent
,
and
quiet
ensued
for
a
moment
,
terrible
to
*NL*
Countess
Mary
.
She
knew
how
Nicholas
disliked
being
waked
.
Then
through
*NL*
the
door
she
heard
Nicholas
clearing
his
throat
again
and
stirring
,
and
*NL*
his
voice
said
crossly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
get
a
moment
's
peace
...
Mary
,
is
that
you
?
Why
did
you
bring
*NL*
him
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
came
in
to
look
and
did
not
notice
...
forgive
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
coughed
and
said
no
more
.
Countess
Mary
moved
away
from
the
*NL*
door
and
took
the
boy
back
to
the
nursery
.
Five
minutes
later
little
*NL*
black-eyed
three-year-old
Natasha
,
her
father
's
pet
,
having
learned
from
*NL*
her
brother
that
Papa
was
asleep
and
Mamma
was
in
the
sitting
room
,
ran
*NL*
to
her
father
unobserved
by
her
mother
.
The
dark-eyed
little
girl
boldly
*NL*
opened
the
creaking
door
,
went
up
to
the
sofa
with
energetic
steps
of
*NL*
her
sturdy
little
legs
,
and
having
examined
the
position
of
her
father
,
*NL*
who
was
asleep
with
his
back
to
her
,
rose
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
the
hand
*NL*
which
lay
under
his
head
.
Nicholas
turned
with
a
tender
smile
on
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natasha
,
Natasha
!
''
came
Countess
Mary
's
frightened
whisper
from
the
*NL*
door
.
``
Papa
wants
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mamma
,
he
does
n't
want
to
sleep
,
''
said
little
Natasha
with
*NL*
conviction
.
``
He
's
laughing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
lowered
his
legs
,
rose
,
and
took
his
daughter
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Mary
,
''
he
said
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
and
sat
down
by
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
notice
him
following
me
,
''
she
said
timidly
.
``
I
just
looked
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holding
his
little
girl
with
one
arm
,
Nicholas
glanced
at
his
wife
and
,
*NL*
seeing
her
guilty
expression
,
put
his
other
arm
around
her
and
kissed
*NL*
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
kiss
Mamma
?
''
he
asked
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
smiled
bashfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
!
''
she
commanded
,
pointing
with
a
peremptory
gesture
to
the
spot
*NL*
where
Nicholas
had
placed
the
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
you
think
I
am
cross
,
''
said
Nicholas
,
replying
to
the
*NL*
question
he
knew
was
in
his
wife
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
idea
how
unhappy
,
how
lonely
,
I
feel
when
you
are
like
*NL*
that
.
It
always
seems
to
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
,
do
n't
talk
nonsense
.
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
!
''
he
*NL*
said
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
be
that
you
ca
n't
love
me
,
that
I
am
so
plain
...
always
...
*NL*
and
now
...
in
this
cond
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
absurd
you
are
!
It
is
not
beauty
that
endears
,
it
's
love
that
*NL*
makes
us
see
beauty
.
It
is
only
Malvinas
and
women
of
that
kind
who
are
*NL*
loved
for
their
beauty
.
But
do
I
love
my
wife
?
I
do
n't
love
her
,
but
...
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
how
to
put
it
.
Without
you
,
or
when
something
comes
between
*NL*
us
like
this
,
I
seem
lost
and
ca
n't
do
anything
.
Now
do
I
love
my
*NL*
finger
?
I
do
n't
love
it
,
but
just
try
to
cut
it
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
like
that
myself
,
but
I
understand
.
So
you
're
not
angry
with
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
angry
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
and
getting
up
.
And
smoothing
his
hair
*NL*
he
began
to
pace
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Mary
,
what
I
've
been
thinking
?
''
he
began
,
immediately
*NL*
thinking
aloud
in
his
wife
's
presence
now
that
they
had
made
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
ask
if
she
was
ready
to
listen
to
him
.
He
did
not
care
.
A
*NL*
thought
had
occurred
to
him
and
so
it
belonged
to
her
also
.
And
he
told
*NL*
her
of
his
intention
to
persuade
Pierre
to
stay
with
them
till
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
listened
till
he
had
finished
,
made
some
remark
,
and
in
*NL*
her
turn
began
thinking
aloud
.
Her
thoughts
were
about
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
the
woman
in
her
already
,
''
she
said
in
French
,
pointing
to
*NL*
little
Natasha
.
``
You
reproach
us
women
with
being
illogical
.
Here
is
our
*NL*
logic
.
I
say
:
`
Papa
wants
to
sleep
!
'
but
she
says
,
`
No
,
he
's
laughing
.
'
*NL*
And
she
was
right
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
with
a
happy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
And
Nicholas
,
taking
his
little
daughter
in
his
strong
hand
,
*NL*
lifted
her
high
,
placed
her
on
his
shoulder
,
held
her
by
the
legs
,
and
*NL*
paced
the
room
with
her
.
There
was
an
expression
of
carefree
happiness
*NL*
on
the
faces
of
both
father
and
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
you
may
be
unfair
.
You
are
too
fond
of
this
one
,
''
his
wife
*NL*
whispered
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
what
am
I
to
do
?
...
I
try
not
to
show
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
pulley
and
footsteps
in
*NL*
the
hall
and
anteroom
,
as
if
someone
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
has
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
it
is
Pierre
.
I
will
go
and
see
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
and
left
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
absence
Nicholas
allowed
himself
to
give
his
little
daughter
a
*NL*
gallop
round
the
room
.
Out
of
breath
,
he
took
the
laughing
child
quickly
*NL*
from
his
shoulder
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
.
His
capers
reminded
him
*NL*
of
dancing
,
and
looking
at
the
child
's
round
happy
little
face
he
*NL*
thought
of
what
she
would
be
like
when
he
was
an
old
man
,
taking
her
*NL*
into
society
and
dancing
the
mazurka
with
her
as
his
old
father
had
*NL*
danced
Daniel
Cooper
with
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he
,
it
is
he
,
Nicholas
!
''
said
Countess
Mary
,
re-entering
the
room
*NL*
a
few
minutes
later
.
``
Now
our
Natasha
has
come
to
life
.
You
should
have
*NL*
seen
her
ecstasy
,
and
how
he
caught
it
for
having
stayed
away
so
long
.
*NL*
Well
,
come
along
now
,
quick
,
quick
!
It
's
time
you
two
were
parted
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
looking
smilingly
at
the
little
girl
who
clung
to
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
went
out
holding
the
child
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
remained
in
the
sitting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
never
,
never
have
believed
that
one
could
be
so
happy
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
to
herself
.
A
smile
lit
up
her
face
but
at
the
same
time
she
*NL*
sighed
,
and
her
deep
eyes
expressed
a
quiet
sadness
as
though
she
felt
,
*NL*
through
her
happiness
,
that
there
is
another
sort
of
happiness
*NL*
unattainable
in
this
life
and
of
which
she
involuntarily
thought
at
that
*NL*
instant

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
had
married
in
the
early
spring
of
1813
,
and
in
1820
already
had
*NL*
three
daughters
besides
a
son
for
whom
she
had
longed
and
whom
she
was
*NL*
now
nursing
.
She
had
grown
stouter
and
broader
,
so
that
it
was
difficult
*NL*
to
recognize
in
this
robust
,
motherly
woman
the
slim
,
lively
Natasha
of
*NL*
former
days
.
Her
features
were
more
defined
and
had
a
calm
,
soft
,
and
*NL*
serene
expression
.
In
her
face
there
was
none
of
the
ever-glowing
*NL*
animation
that
had
formerly
burned
there
and
constituted
its
charm
.
Now
*NL*
her
face
and
body
were
often
all
that
one
saw
,
and
her
soul
was
not
*NL*
visible
at
all
.
All
that
struck
the
eye
was
a
strong
,
handsome
,
and
*NL*
fertile
woman
.
The
old
fire
very
rarely
kindled
in
her
face
now
.
That
*NL*
happened
only
when
,
as
was
the
case
that
day
,
her
husband
returned
home
,
*NL*
or
a
sick
child
was
convalescent
,
or
when
she
and
Countess
Mary
spoke
of
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
-LRB-
she
never
mentioned
him
to
her
husband
,
who
she
imagined
*NL*
was
jealous
of
Prince
Andrew
's
memory
-RRB-
,
or
on
the
rare
occasions
when
*NL*
something
happened
to
induce
her
to
sing
,
a
practice
she
had
quite
*NL*
abandoned
since
her
marriage
.
At
the
rare
moments
when
the
old
fire
did
*NL*
kindle
in
her
handsome
,
fully
developed
body
she
was
even
more
*NL*
attractive
than
in
former
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
their
marriage
Natasha
and
her
husband
had
lived
in
Moscow
,
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
on
their
estate
near
Moscow
,
or
with
her
mother
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
in
Nicholas
'
house
.
The
young
Countess
Bezukhova
was
not
often
seen
*NL*
in
society
,
and
those
who
met
her
there
were
not
pleased
with
her
and
*NL*
found
her
neither
attractive
nor
amiable
.
Not
that
Natasha
liked
*NL*
solitude
--
she
did
not
know
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
,
she
even
thought
*NL*
that
she
did
not
--
but
with
her
pregnancies
,
her
confinements
,
the
*NL*
nursing
of
her
children
,
and
sharing
every
moment
of
her
husband
's
life
,
*NL*
she
had
demands
on
her
time
which
could
be
satisfied
only
by
renouncing
*NL*
society
.
All
who
had
known
Natasha
before
her
marriage
wondered
at
the
*NL*
change
in
her
as
at
something
extraordinary
.
Only
the
old
countess
with
*NL*
her
maternal
instinct
had
realized
that
all
Natasha
's
outbursts
had
been
*NL*
due
to
her
need
of
children
and
a
husband
--
as
she
herself
had
once
*NL*
exclaimed
at
Otradnoe
not
so
much
in
fun
as
in
earnest
--
and
her
mother
*NL*
was
now
surprised
at
the
surprise
expressed
by
those
who
had
never
*NL*
understood
Natasha
,
and
she
kept
saying
that
she
had
always
known
that
*NL*
Natasha
would
make
an
exemplary
wife
and
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
she
lets
her
love
of
her
husband
and
children
overflow
all
*NL*
bounds
,
''
said
the
countess
,
``
so
that
it
even
becomes
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
follow
the
golden
rule
advocated
by
clever
folk
,
*NL*
especially
by
the
French
,
which
says
that
a
girl
should
not
let
herself
*NL*
go
when
she
marries
,
should
not
neglect
her
accomplishments
,
should
be
*NL*
even
more
careful
of
her
appearance
than
when
she
was
unmarried
,
and
*NL*
should
fascinate
her
husband
as
much
as
she
did
before
he
became
her
*NL*
husband
.
Natasha
on
the
contrary
had
at
once
abandoned
all
her
witchery
,
*NL*
of
which
her
singing
had
been
an
unusually
powerful
part
.
She
gave
it
up
*NL*
just
because
it
was
so
powerfully
seductive
.
She
took
no
pains
with
her
*NL*
manners
or
with
delicacy
of
speech
,
or
with
her
toilet
,
or
to
show
*NL*
herself
to
her
husband
in
her
most
becoming
attitudes
,
or
to
avoid
*NL*
inconveniencing
him
by
being
too
exacting
.
She
acted
in
contradiction
to
*NL*
all
those
rules
.
She
felt
that
the
allurements
instinct
had
formerly
*NL*
taught
her
to
use
would
now
be
merely
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
*NL*
husband
,
to
whom
she
had
from
the
first
moment
given
herself
up
*NL*
entirely
--
that
is
,
with
her
whole
soul
,
leaving
no
corner
of
it
hidden
*NL*
from
him
.
She
felt
that
her
unity
with
her
husband
was
not
maintained
by
*NL*
the
poetic
feelings
that
had
attracted
him
to
her
,
but
by
something
*NL*
else
--
indefinite
but
firm
as
the
bond
between
her
own
body
and
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
fluff
out
her
curls
,
put
on
fashionable
dresses
,
and
sing
romantic
*NL*
songs
to
fascinate
her
husband
would
have
seemed
as
strange
as
to
adorn
*NL*
herself
to
attract
herself
.
To
adorn
herself
for
others
might
perhaps
*NL*
have
been
agreeable
--
she
did
not
know
--
but
she
had
no
time
at
all
for
*NL*
it
.
The
chief
reason
for
devoting
no
time
either
to
singing
,
to
dress
,
*NL*
or
to
choosing
her
words
was
that
she
really
had
no
time
to
spare
for
*NL*
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
know
that
man
has
the
faculty
of
becoming
completely
absorbed
in
a
*NL*
subject
however
trivial
it
may
be
,
and
that
there
is
no
subject
so
*NL*
trivial
that
it
will
not
grow
to
infinite
proportions
if
one
's
entire
*NL*
attention
is
devoted
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
which
wholly
engrossed
Natasha
's
attention
was
her
family
:
*NL*
that
is
,
her
husband
whom
she
had
to
keep
so
that
he
should
belong
*NL*
entirely
to
her
and
to
the
home
,
and
the
children
whom
she
had
to
bear
,
*NL*
bring
into
the
world
,
nurse
,
and
bring
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
deeper
she
penetrated
,
not
with
her
mind
only
but
with
her
whole
*NL*
soul
,
her
whole
being
,
into
the
subject
that
absorbed
her
,
the
larger
*NL*
did
that
subject
grow
and
the
weaker
and
more
inadequate
did
her
powers
*NL*
appear
,
so
that
she
concentrated
them
wholly
on
that
one
thing
and
yet
*NL*
was
unable
to
accomplish
all
that
she
considered
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
then
as
now
conversations
and
discussions
about
women
's
*NL*
rights
,
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
and
their
freedom
and
rights
,
*NL*
though
these
themes
were
not
yet
termed
questions
as
they
are
now
;
but
*NL*
these
topics
were
not
merely
uninteresting
to
Natasha
,
she
positively
*NL*
did
not
understand
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
questions
,
then
as
now
,
existed
only
for
those
who
see
nothing
in
*NL*
marriage
but
the
pleasure
married
people
get
from
one
another
,
that
is
,
*NL*
only
the
beginnings
of
marriage
and
not
its
whole
significance
,
which
*NL*
lies
in
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Discussions
and
questions
of
that
kind
,
which
are
like
the
question
of
*NL*
how
to
get
the
greatest
gratification
from
one
's
dinner
,
did
not
then
*NL*
and
do
not
now
exist
for
those
for
whom
the
purpose
of
a
dinner
is
the
*NL*
nourishment
it
affords
;
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
purpose
of
dinner
is
to
nourish
the
body
,
a
man
who
eats
two
*NL*
dinners
at
once
may
perhaps
get
more
enjoyment
but
will
not
attain
his
*NL*
purpose
,
for
his
stomach
will
not
digest
the
two
dinners
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
family
,
the
person
who
wishes
to
have
*NL*
many
wives
or
husbands
may
perhaps
obtain
much
pleasure
,
but
in
that
*NL*
case
will
not
have
a
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
purpose
of
food
is
nourishment
and
the
purpose
of
marriage
is
the
*NL*
family
,
the
whole
question
resolves
itself
into
not
eating
more
than
one
*NL*
can
digest
,
and
not
having
more
wives
or
husbands
than
are
needed
for
*NL*
the
family
--
that
is
,
one
wife
or
one
husband
.
Natasha
needed
a
husband
.
*NL*
A
husband
was
given
her
and
he
gave
her
a
family
.
And
she
not
only
saw
*NL*
no
need
of
any
other
or
better
husband
,
but
as
all
the
powers
of
her
*NL*
soul
were
intent
on
serving
that
husband
and
family
,
she
could
not
*NL*
imagine
and
saw
no
interest
in
imagining
how
it
would
be
if
things
were
*NL*
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
did
not
care
for
society
in
general
,
but
prized
the
more
the
*NL*
society
of
her
relatives
--
Countess
Mary
,
and
her
brother
,
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
Sonya
.
She
valued
the
company
of
those
to
whom
she
could
come
*NL*
striding
disheveled
from
the
nursery
in
her
dressing
gown
,
and
with
*NL*
joyful
face
show
a
yellow
instead
of
a
green
stain
on
baby
's
napkin
,
and
*NL*
from
whom
she
could
hear
reassuring
words
to
the
effect
that
baby
was
*NL*
much
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
an
extent
had
Natasha
let
herself
go
that
the
way
she
dressed
*NL*
and
did
her
hair
,
her
ill-chosen
words
,
and
her
jealousy
--
she
was
*NL*
jealous
of
Sonya
,
of
the
governess
,
and
of
every
woman
,
pretty
or
plain
-
*NL*
-
were
habitual
subjects
of
jest
to
those
about
her
.
The
general
opinion
*NL*
was
that
Pierre
was
under
his
wife
's
thumb
,
which
was
really
true
.
From
*NL*
the
very
first
days
of
their
married
life
Natasha
had
announced
her
*NL*
demands
.
Pierre
was
greatly
surprised
by
his
wife
's
view
,
to
him
a
*NL*
perfectly
novel
one
,
that
every
moment
of
his
life
belonged
to
her
and
*NL*
to
the
family
.
His
wife
's
demands
astonished
him
,
but
they
also
*NL*
flattered
him
,
and
he
submitted
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
's
subjection
consisted
in
the
fact
that
he
not
only
dared
not
*NL*
flirt
with
,
but
dared
not
even
speak
smilingly
to
,
any
other
woman
;
did
*NL*
not
dare
dine
at
the
club
as
a
pastime
,
did
not
dare
spend
money
on
a
*NL*
whim
,
and
did
not
dare
absent
himself
for
any
length
of
time
,
except
on
*NL*
business
--
in
which
his
wife
included
his
intellectual
pursuits
,
which
*NL*
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
but
to
which
she
attributed
great
*NL*
importance
.
To
make
up
for
this
,
at
home
Pierre
had
the
right
to
*NL*
regulate
his
life
and
that
of
the
whole
family
exactly
as
he
chose
.
At
*NL*
home
Natasha
placed
herself
in
the
position
of
a
slave
to
her
husband
,
*NL*
and
the
whole
household
went
on
tiptoe
when
he
was
occupied
--
that
is
,
*NL*
was
reading
or
writing
in
his
study
.
Pierre
had
but
to
show
a
partiality
*NL*
for
anything
to
get
just
what
he
liked
done
always
.
He
had
only
to
*NL*
express
a
wish
and
Natasha
would
jump
up
and
run
to
fulfill
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entire
household
was
governed
according
to
Pierre
's
supposed
orders
,
*NL*
that
is
,
by
his
wishes
which
Natasha
tried
to
guess
.
Their
way
of
life
*NL*
and
place
of
residence
,
their
acquaintances
and
ties
,
Natasha
's
*NL*
occupations
,
the
children
's
upbringing
,
were
all
selected
not
merely
*NL*
with
regard
to
Pierre
's
expressed
wishes
,
but
to
what
Natasha
from
the
*NL*
thoughts
he
expressed
in
conversation
supposed
his
wishes
to
be
.
And
she
*NL*
deduced
the
essentials
of
his
wishes
quite
correctly
,
and
having
once
*NL*
arrived
at
them
clung
to
them
tenaciously
.
When
Pierre
himself
wanted
to
*NL*
change
his
mind
she
would
fight
him
with
his
own
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
a
time
of
trouble
ever
memorable
to
him
after
the
birth
of
their
*NL*
first
child
who
was
delicate
,
when
they
had
to
change
the
wet
nurse
*NL*
three
times
and
Natasha
fell
ill
from
despair
,
Pierre
one
day
told
her
*NL*
of
Rousseau
's
view
,
with
which
he
quite
agreed
,
that
to
have
a
wet
nurse
*NL*
is
unnatural
and
harmful
.
When
her
next
baby
was
born
,
despite
the
*NL*
opposition
of
her
mother
,
the
doctors
,
and
even
of
her
husband
himself
--
*NL*
who
were
all
vigorously
opposed
to
her
nursing
her
baby
herself
,
a
thing
*NL*
then
unheard
of
and
considered
injurious
--
she
insisted
on
having
her
own
*NL*
way
,
and
after
that
nursed
all
her
babies
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
very
often
happened
that
in
a
moment
of
irritation
husband
and
wife
*NL*
would
have
a
dispute
,
but
long
afterwards
Pierre
to
his
surprise
and
*NL*
delight
would
find
in
his
wife
's
ideas
and
actions
the
very
thought
*NL*
against
which
she
had
argued
,
but
divested
of
everything
superfluous
*NL*
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
dispute
he
had
added
when
expressing
his
*NL*
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
seven
years
of
marriage
Pierre
had
the
joyous
and
firm
*NL*
consciousness
that
he
was
not
a
bad
man
,
and
he
felt
this
because
he
saw
*NL*
himself
reflected
in
his
wife
.
He
felt
the
good
and
bad
within
himself
*NL*
inextricably
mingled
and
overlapping
.
But
only
what
was
really
good
in
*NL*
him
was
reflected
in
his
wife
,
all
that
was
not
quite
good
was
rejected
.
*NL*
And
this
was
not
the
result
of
logical
reasoning
but
was
a
direct
and
*NL*
mysterious
reflection
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
previously
when
Pierre
was
already
staying
with
the
Rostovs
*NL*
he
had
received
a
letter
from
Prince
Theodore
,
asking
him
to
come
to
*NL*
Petersburg
to
confer
on
some
important
questions
that
were
being
*NL*
discussed
there
by
a
society
of
which
Pierre
was
one
of
the
principal
*NL*
founders
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reading
that
letter
-LRB-
she
always
read
her
husband
's
letters
-RRB-
Natasha
*NL*
herself
suggested
that
he
should
go
to
Petersburg
,
though
she
would
feel
*NL*
his
absence
very
acutely
.
She
attributed
immense
importance
to
all
her
*NL*
husband
's
intellectual
and
abstract
interests
though
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
them
,
and
she
always
dreaded
being
a
hindrance
to
him
in
such
*NL*
matters
.
To
Pierre
's
timid
look
of
inquiry
after
reading
the
letter
she
*NL*
replied
by
asking
him
to
go
,
but
to
fix
a
definite
date
for
his
return
.
*NL*
He
was
given
four
weeks
'
leave
of
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
that
leave
of
absence
had
expired
,
more
than
a
fortnight
*NL*
before
,
Natasha
had
been
in
a
constant
state
of
alarm
,
depression
,
and
*NL*
irritability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
now
a
general
on
the
retired
list
and
much
dissatisfied
with
*NL*
the
present
state
of
affairs
,
had
arrived
during
that
fortnight
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
Natasha
with
sorrow
and
surprise
as
at
a
bad
likeness
of
a
*NL*
person
once
dear
.
A
dull
,
dejected
look
,
random
replies
,
and
talk
about
*NL*
the
nursery
was
all
he
saw
and
heard
from
his
former
enchantress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
was
sad
and
irritable
all
that
time
,
especially
when
her
mother
,
*NL*
her
brother
,
Sonya
,
or
Countess
Mary
in
their
efforts
to
console
her
*NL*
tried
to
excuse
Pierre
and
suggested
reasons
for
his
delay
in
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
nonsense
,
all
rubbish
--
those
discussions
which
lead
to
nothing
*NL*
and
all
those
idiotic
societies
!
''
Natasha
declared
of
the
very
affairs
*NL*
in
the
immense
importance
of
which
she
firmly
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
would
go
to
the
nursery
to
nurse
Petya
,
her
only
boy
.
No
one
*NL*
else
could
tell
her
anything
so
comforting
or
so
reasonable
as
this
*NL*
little
three-month-old
creature
when
he
lay
at
her
breast
and
she
was
*NL*
conscious
of
the
movement
of
his
lips
and
the
snuffling
of
his
little
*NL*
nose
.
That
creature
said
:
``
You
are
angry
,
you
are
jealous
,
you
would
*NL*
like
to
pay
him
out
,
you
are
afraid
--
but
here
am
I
!
And
I
am
he
...
''
and
*NL*
that
was
unanswerable
.
It
was
more
than
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
fortnight
of
anxiety
Natasha
resorted
to
the
baby
for
*NL*
comfort
so
often
,
and
fussed
over
him
so
much
,
that
she
overfed
him
and
*NL*
he
fell
ill
.
She
was
terrified
by
his
illness
,
and
yet
that
was
just
*NL*
what
she
needed
.
While
attending
to
him
she
bore
the
anxiety
about
her
*NL*
husband
more
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
nursing
her
boy
when
the
sound
of
Pierre
's
sleigh
was
heard
at
*NL*
the
front
door
,
and
the
old
nurse
--
knowing
how
to
please
her
mistress
--
*NL*
entered
the
room
inaudibly
but
hurriedly
and
with
a
beaming
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
come
?
''
Natasha
asked
quickly
in
a
whisper
,
afraid
to
move
lest
*NL*
she
should
rouse
the
dozing
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
come
,
ma'am
,
''
whispered
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Natasha
's
face
and
her
feet
involuntarily
moved
,
but
*NL*
she
could
not
jump
up
and
run
out
.
The
baby
again
opened
his
eyes
and
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
``
You
're
here
?
''
he
seemed
to
be
saying
,
and
again
lazily
*NL*
smacked
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cautiously
withdrawing
her
breast
,
Natasha
rocked
him
a
little
,
handed
*NL*
him
to
the
nurse
,
and
went
with
rapid
steps
toward
the
door
.
But
at
the
*NL*
door
she
stopped
as
if
her
conscience
reproached
her
for
having
in
her
*NL*
joy
left
the
child
too
soon
,
and
she
glanced
round
.
The
nurse
with
*NL*
raised
elbows
was
lifting
the
infant
over
the
rail
of
his
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
ma'am
!
Do
n't
worry
,
go
!
''
she
whispered
,
smiling
,
with
the
kind
of
*NL*
familiarity
that
grows
up
between
a
nurse
and
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
ran
with
light
footsteps
to
the
anteroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Denisov
,
who
had
come
out
of
the
study
into
the
dancing
room
with
his
*NL*
pipe
,
now
for
the
first
time
recognized
the
old
Natasha
.
A
flood
of
*NL*
brilliant
,
joyful
light
poured
from
her
transfigured
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
come
!
''
she
exclaimed
as
she
ran
past
,
and
Denisov
felt
that
he
too
*NL*
was
delighted
that
Pierre
,
whom
he
did
not
much
care
for
,
had
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
vestibule
Natasha
saw
a
tall
figure
in
a
fur
coat
*NL*
unwinding
his
scarf
.
``
It
's
he
!
It
's
really
he
!
He
has
come
!
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
rushing
at
him
embraced
him
,
pressed
his
head
to
her
*NL*
breast
,
and
then
pushed
him
back
and
gazed
at
his
ruddy
,
happy
face
,
*NL*
covered
with
hoarfrost
.
``
Yes
,
it
is
he
,
happy
and
contented
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
at
once
she
remembered
the
tortures
of
suspense
she
had
*NL*
experienced
for
the
last
fortnight
,
and
the
joy
that
had
lit
up
her
face
*NL*
vanished
;
she
frowned
and
overwhelmed
Pierre
with
a
torrent
of
*NL*
reproaches
and
angry
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
very
well
for
you
.
You
are
pleased
,
you
've
had
a
good
*NL*
time
...
But
what
about
me
?
You
might
at
least
have
shown
consideration
*NL*
for
the
children
.
I
am
nursing
and
my
milk
was
spoiled
...
Petya
was
at
*NL*
death
's
door
.
But
you
were
enjoying
yourself
.
Yes
,
enjoying
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
knew
he
was
not
to
blame
,
for
he
could
not
have
come
sooner
;
he
*NL*
knew
this
outburst
was
unseemly
and
would
blow
over
in
a
minute
or
two
;
*NL*
above
all
he
knew
that
he
himself
was
bright
and
happy
.
He
wanted
to
*NL*
smile
but
dared
not
even
think
of
doing
so
.
He
made
a
piteous
,
*NL*
frightened
face
and
bent
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
,
on
my
honor
.
But
how
is
Petya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
now
.
Come
along
!
I
wonder
you
're
not
ashamed
!
If
only
you
*NL*
could
see
what
I
was
like
without
you
,
how
I
suffered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
''
she
said
,
not
letting
go
of
his
arm
.
And
they
went
to
*NL*
their
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Nicholas
and
his
wife
came
to
look
for
Pierre
he
was
in
the
nursery
*NL*
holding
his
baby
son
,
who
was
again
awake
,
on
his
huge
right
palm
and
*NL*
dandling
him
.
A
blissful
bright
smile
was
fixed
on
the
baby
's
broad
face
*NL*
with
its
toothless
open
mouth
.
The
storm
was
long
since
over
and
there
*NL*
was
bright
,
joyous
sunshine
on
Natasha
's
face
as
she
gazed
tenderly
at
*NL*
her
husband
and
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
talked
everything
well
over
with
Prince
Theodore
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
capitally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
he
holds
it
up
.
''
-LRB-
She
meant
the
baby
's
head
.
-RRB-
``
But
how
he
did
*NL*
frighten
me
...
You
've
seen
the
princess
?
Is
it
true
she
's
in
love
with
*NL*
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
just
fancy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Nicholas
and
Countess
Mary
came
in
.
Pierre
with
the
baby
*NL*
on
his
hand
stooped
,
kissed
them
,
and
replied
to
their
inquiries
.
But
in
*NL*
spite
of
much
that
was
interesting
and
had
to
be
discussed
,
the
baby
*NL*
with
the
little
cap
on
its
unsteady
head
evidently
absorbed
all
his
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sweet
!
''
said
Countess
Mary
,
looking
at
and
playing
with
the
baby
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
Nicholas
,
''
she
added
,
turning
to
her
husband
,
``
I
ca
n't
understand
*NL*
how
it
is
you
do
n't
see
the
charm
of
these
delicious
marvels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
and
ca
n't
,
''
replied
Nicholas
,
looking
coldly
at
the
baby
.
``
A
*NL*
lump
of
flesh
.
Come
along
,
Pierre
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
he
's
such
an
affectionate
father
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
,
*NL*
vindicating
her
husband
,
``
but
only
after
they
are
a
year
old
or
so
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Pierre
nurses
them
splendidly
,
''
said
Natasha
.
``
He
says
his
hand
is
*NL*
just
made
for
a
baby
's
seat
.
Just
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
not
for
this
...
''
Pierre
suddenly
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
,
and
*NL*
shifting
the
baby
he
gave
him
to
the
nurse
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
As
in
every
large
household
,
there
were
at
Bald
Hills
several
perfectly
*NL*
distinct
worlds
which
merged
into
one
harmonious
whole
,
though
each
*NL*
retained
its
own
peculiarities
and
made
concessions
to
the
others
.
Every
*NL*
event
,
joyful
or
sad
,
that
took
place
in
that
house
was
important
to
all
*NL*
these
worlds
,
but
each
had
its
own
special
reasons
to
rejoice
or
grieve
*NL*
over
that
occurrence
independently
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
Pierre
's
return
was
a
joyful
and
important
event
and
they
*NL*
all
felt
it
to
be
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
--
the
most
reliable
judges
of
their
masters
because
they
*NL*
judge
not
by
their
conversation
or
expressions
of
feeling
but
by
their
*NL*
acts
and
way
of
life
--
were
glad
of
Pierre
's
return
because
they
knew
*NL*
that
when
he
was
there
Count
Nicholas
would
cease
going
every
day
to
*NL*
attend
to
the
estate
,
and
would
be
in
better
spirits
and
temper
,
and
*NL*
also
because
they
would
all
receive
handsome
presents
for
the
holidays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
and
their
governesses
were
glad
of
Pierre
's
return
because
*NL*
no
one
else
drew
them
into
the
social
life
of
the
household
as
he
did
.
*NL*
He
alone
could
play
on
the
clavichord
that
ecossaise
-LRB-
his
only
piece
-RRB-
to
*NL*
which
,
as
he
said
,
all
possible
dances
could
be
danced
,
and
they
felt
*NL*
sure
he
had
brought
presents
for
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Nicholas
,
now
a
slim
lad
of
fifteen
,
delicate
and
intelligent
,
*NL*
with
curly
light-brown
hair
and
beautiful
eyes
,
was
delighted
because
*NL*
Uncle
Pierre
as
he
called
him
was
the
object
of
his
rapturous
and
*NL*
passionate
affection
.
No
one
had
instilled
into
him
this
love
for
Pierre
*NL*
whom
he
saw
only
occasionally
.
Countess
Mary
who
had
brought
him
up
had
*NL*
done
her
utmost
to
make
him
love
her
husband
as
she
loved
him
,
and
*NL*
little
Nicholas
did
love
his
uncle
,
but
loved
him
with
just
a
shade
of
*NL*
contempt
.
Pierre
,
however
,
he
adored
.
He
did
not
want
to
be
an
hussar
or
*NL*
a
Knight
of
St.
George
like
his
uncle
Nicholas
;
he
wanted
to
be
learned
,
*NL*
wise
,
and
kind
like
Pierre
.
In
Pierre
's
presence
his
face
always
shone
*NL*
with
pleasure
and
he
flushed
and
was
breathless
when
Pierre
spoke
to
*NL*
him
.
He
did
not
miss
a
single
word
he
uttered
,
and
would
afterwards
,
*NL*
with
Dessalles
or
by
himself
,
recall
and
reconsider
the
meaning
of
*NL*
everything
Pierre
had
said
.
Pierre
's
past
life
and
his
unhappiness
prior
*NL*
to
1812
-LRB-
of
which
young
Nicholas
had
formed
a
vague
poetic
picture
from
*NL*
some
words
he
had
overheard
-RRB-
,
his
adventures
in
Moscow
,
his
captivity
,
*NL*
Platon
Karataev
-LRB-
of
whom
he
had
heard
from
Pierre
-RRB-
,
his
love
for
Natasha
*NL*
-LRB-
of
whom
the
lad
was
also
particularly
fond
-RRB-
,
and
especially
Pierre
's
*NL*
friendship
with
the
father
whom
Nicholas
could
not
remember
--
all
this
*NL*
made
Pierre
in
his
eyes
a
hero
and
a
saint
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
broken
remarks
about
Natasha
and
his
father
,
from
the
emotion
with
*NL*
which
Pierre
spoke
of
that
dead
father
,
and
from
the
careful
,
reverent
*NL*
tenderness
with
which
Natasha
spoke
of
him
,
the
boy
,
who
was
only
just
*NL*
beginning
to
guess
what
love
is
,
derived
the
notion
that
his
father
had
*NL*
loved
Natasha
and
when
dying
had
left
her
to
his
friend
.
But
the
father
*NL*
whom
the
boy
did
not
remember
appeared
to
him
a
divinity
who
could
not
*NL*
be
pictured
,
and
of
whom
he
never
thought
without
a
swelling
heart
and
*NL*
tears
of
sadness
and
rapture
.
So
the
boy
also
was
happy
that
Pierre
had
*NL*
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
welcomed
Pierre
because
he
always
helped
to
enliven
and
unite
*NL*
any
company
he
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grown-up
members
of
the
family
,
not
to
mention
his
wife
,
were
*NL*
pleased
to
have
back
a
friend
whose
presence
made
life
run
more
smoothly
*NL*
and
peacefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
ladies
were
pleased
with
the
presents
he
brought
them
,
and
*NL*
especially
that
Natasha
would
now
be
herself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
felt
the
different
outlooks
of
these
various
worlds
and
made
*NL*
haste
to
satisfy
all
their
expectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
most
absent-minded
and
forgetful
of
men
,
Pierre
,
with
the
aid
*NL*
of
a
list
his
wife
drew
up
,
had
now
bought
everything
,
not
forgetting
*NL*
his
mother
--
and
brother-in-law
's
commissions
,
nor
the
dress
material
for
*NL*
a
present
to
Belova
,
nor
toys
for
his
wife
's
nephews
.
In
the
early
days
*NL*
of
his
marriage
it
had
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
wife
should
expect
*NL*
him
not
to
forget
to
procure
all
the
things
he
undertook
to
buy
,
and
he
*NL*
had
been
taken
aback
by
her
serious
annoyance
when
on
his
first
trip
he
*NL*
forgot
everything
.
But
in
time
he
grew
used
to
this
demand
.
Knowing
that
*NL*
Natasha
asked
nothing
for
herself
,
and
gave
him
commissions
for
others
*NL*
only
when
he
himself
had
offered
to
undertake
them
,
he
now
found
an
*NL*
unexpected
and
childlike
pleasure
in
this
purchase
of
presents
for
*NL*
everyone
in
the
house
,
and
never
forgot
anything
.
If
he
now
incurred
*NL*
Natasha
's
censure
it
was
only
for
buying
too
many
and
too
expensive
*NL*
things
.
To
her
other
defects
-LRB-
as
most
people
thought
them
,
but
which
to
*NL*
Pierre
were
qualities
-RRB-
of
untidiness
and
neglect
of
herself
,
she
now
*NL*
added
stinginess
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
time
that
Pierre
began
life
as
a
family
man
on
a
footing
*NL*
entailing
heavy
expenditure
,
he
had
noticed
to
his
surprise
that
he
*NL*
spent
only
half
as
much
as
before
,
and
that
his
affairs
--
which
had
been
*NL*
in
disorder
of
late
,
chiefly
because
of
his
first
wife
's
debts
--
had
*NL*
begun
to
improve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Life
was
cheaper
because
it
was
circumscribed
:
that
most
expensive
*NL*
luxury
,
the
kind
of
life
that
can
be
changed
at
any
moment
,
was
no
*NL*
longer
his
nor
did
he
wish
for
it
.
He
felt
that
his
way
of
life
had
now
*NL*
been
settled
once
for
all
till
death
and
that
to
change
it
was
not
in
*NL*
his
power
,
and
so
that
way
of
life
proved
economical
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
merry
,
smiling
face
Pierre
was
sorting
his
purchases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
this
?
''
said
he
,
unrolling
a
piece
of
stuff
like
a
*NL*
shopman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
with
her
eldest
daughter
on
her
*NL*
lap
,
turned
her
sparkling
eyes
swiftly
from
her
husband
to
the
things
he
*NL*
showed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
Belova
?
Excellent
!
''
She
felt
the
quality
of
the
material
.
*NL*
``
It
was
a
ruble
an
arshin
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
told
her
the
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
dear
!
''
Natasha
remarked
.
``
How
pleased
the
children
will
be
and
*NL*
Mamma
too
!
Only
you
need
not
have
bought
me
this
,
''
she
added
,
unable
to
*NL*
suppress
a
smile
as
she
gazed
admiringly
at
a
gold
comb
set
with
pearls
,
*NL*
of
a
kind
then
just
coming
into
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adele
tempted
me
:
she
kept
on
telling
me
to
buy
it
,
''
returned
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
am
I
to
wear
it
?
''
and
Natasha
stuck
it
in
her
coil
of
hair
.
``
When
*NL*
I
take
little
Masha
into
society
?
Perhaps
they
will
be
fashionable
again
*NL*
by
then
.
Well
,
let
's
go
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
collecting
the
presents
they
went
first
to
the
nursery
and
then
to
*NL*
the
old
countess
'
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
sitting
with
her
companion
Belova
,
playing
grand
-
*NL*
patience
as
usual
,
when
Pierre
and
Natasha
came
into
the
drawing
room
*NL*
with
parcels
under
their
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
was
now
over
sixty
,
was
quite
gray
,
and
wore
a
cap
with
a
*NL*
frill
that
surrounded
her
face
.
Her
face
had
shriveled
,
her
upper
lip
*NL*
had
sunk
in
,
and
her
eyes
were
dim
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
deaths
of
her
son
and
husband
in
such
rapid
succession
,
she
*NL*
felt
herself
a
being
accidentally
forgotten
in
this
world
and
left
*NL*
without
aim
or
object
for
her
existence
.
She
ate
,
drank
,
slept
,
or
kept
*NL*
awake
,
but
did
not
live
.
Life
gave
her
no
new
impressions
.
She
wanted
*NL*
nothing
from
life
but
tranquillity
,
and
that
tranquillity
only
death
*NL*
could
give
her
.
But
until
death
came
she
had
to
go
on
living
,
that
is
,
*NL*
to
use
her
vital
forces
.
A
peculiarity
one
sees
in
very
young
children
*NL*
and
very
old
people
was
particularly
evident
in
her
.
Her
life
had
no
*NL*
external
aims
--
only
a
need
to
exercise
her
various
functions
and
*NL*
inclinations
was
apparent
.
She
had
to
eat
,
sleep
,
think
,
speak
,
weep
,
*NL*
work
,
give
vent
to
her
anger
,
and
so
on
,
merely
because
she
had
a
*NL*
stomach
,
a
brain
,
muscles
,
nerves
,
and
a
liver
.
She
did
these
things
not
*NL*
under
any
external
impulse
as
people
in
the
full
vigor
of
life
do
,
when
*NL*
behind
the
purpose
for
which
they
strive
that
of
exercising
their
*NL*
functions
remains
unnoticed
.
She
talked
only
because
she
physically
*NL*
needed
to
exercise
her
tongue
and
lungs
.
She
cried
as
a
child
does
,
*NL*
because
her
nose
had
to
be
cleared
,
and
so
on
.
What
for
people
in
their
*NL*
full
vigor
is
an
aim
was
for
her
evidently
merely
a
pretext
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
the
morning
--
especially
if
she
had
eaten
anything
rich
the
day
*NL*
before
--
she
felt
a
need
of
being
angry
and
would
choose
as
the
handiest
*NL*
pretext
Belova
's
deafness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
begin
to
say
something
to
her
in
a
low
tone
from
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
a
little
warmer
today
,
my
dear
,
''
she
would
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
Belova
replied
:
``
Oh
yes
,
they
've
come
,
''
she
would
mutter
*NL*
angrily
:
``
O
Lord
!
How
stupid
and
deaf
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pretext
would
be
her
snuff
,
which
would
seem
too
dry
or
too
damp
*NL*
or
not
rubbed
fine
enough
.
After
these
fits
of
irritability
her
face
*NL*
would
grow
yellow
,
and
her
maids
knew
by
infallible
symptoms
when
Belova
*NL*
would
again
be
deaf
,
the
snuff
damp
,
and
the
countess
'
face
yellow
.
Just
*NL*
as
she
needed
to
work
off
her
spleen
so
she
had
sometimes
to
exercise
*NL*
her
still-existing
faculty
of
thinking
--
and
the
pretext
for
that
was
a
*NL*
game
of
patience
.
When
she
needed
to
cry
,
the
deceased
count
would
be
*NL*
the
pretext
.
When
she
wanted
to
be
agitated
,
Nicholas
and
his
health
*NL*
would
be
the
pretext
,
and
when
she
felt
a
need
to
speak
spitefully
,
the
*NL*
pretext
would
be
Countess
Mary
.
When
her
vocal
organs
needed
exercise
,
*NL*
which
was
usually
toward
seven
o'clock
when
she
had
had
an
after-dinner
*NL*
rest
in
a
darkened
room
,
the
pretext
would
be
the
retelling
of
the
same
*NL*
stories
over
and
over
again
to
the
same
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
's
condition
was
understood
by
the
whole
household
though
no
*NL*
one
ever
spoke
of
it
,
and
they
all
made
every
possible
effort
to
satisfy
*NL*
her
needs
.
Only
by
a
rare
glance
exchanged
with
a
sad
smile
between
*NL*
Nicholas
,
Pierre
,
Natasha
,
and
Countess
Mary
was
the
common
*NL*
understanding
of
her
condition
expressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
those
glances
expressed
something
more
:
they
said
that
she
had
*NL*
played
her
part
in
life
,
that
what
they
now
saw
was
not
her
whole
self
,
*NL*
that
we
must
all
become
like
her
,
and
that
they
were
glad
to
yield
to
*NL*
her
,
to
restrain
themselves
for
this
once
precious
being
formerly
as
*NL*
full
of
life
as
themselves
,
but
now
so
much
to
be
pitied
.
``
Memento
*NL*
mori
,
''
said
these
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
really
heartless
,
the
stupid
ones
of
that
household
,
and
the
*NL*
little
children
failed
to
understand
this
and
avoided
her
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pierre
and
his
wife
entered
the
drawing
room
the
countess
was
in
*NL*
one
of
her
customary
states
in
which
she
needed
the
mental
exertion
of
*NL*
playing
patience
,
and
so
--
though
by
force
of
habit
she
greeted
him
with
*NL*
the
words
she
always
used
when
Pierre
or
her
son
returned
after
an
*NL*
absence
:
``
High
time
,
my
dear
,
high
time
!
We
were
all
weary
of
waiting
*NL*
for
you
.
Well
,
thank
God
!
''
and
received
her
presents
with
another
*NL*
customary
remark
:
``
It
's
not
the
gift
that
's
precious
,
my
dear
,
but
that
*NL*
you
give
it
to
me
,
an
old
woman
...
''
--
yet
it
was
evident
that
she
was
not
*NL*
pleased
by
Pierre
's
arrival
at
that
moment
when
it
diverted
her
*NL*
attention
from
the
unfinished
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
finished
her
game
of
patience
and
only
then
examined
the
presents
.
*NL*
They
consisted
of
a
box
for
cards
,
of
splendid
workmanship
,
a
bright
-
*NL*
blue
Sevres
tea
cup
with
shepherdesses
depicted
on
it
and
with
a
lid
,
*NL*
and
a
gold
snuffbox
with
the
count
's
portrait
on
the
lid
which
Pierre
*NL*
had
had
done
by
a
miniaturist
in
Petersburg
.
The
countess
had
long
*NL*
wished
for
such
a
box
,
but
as
she
did
not
want
to
cry
just
then
she
*NL*
glanced
indifferently
at
the
portrait
and
gave
her
attention
chiefly
to
*NL*
the
box
for
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
dear
,
you
have
cheered
me
up
,
''
said
she
as
she
always
*NL*
did
.
``
But
best
of
all
you
have
brought
yourself
back
--
for
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
like
it
,
you
ought
to
give
your
wife
a
scolding
!
What
are
we
to
*NL*
do
with
her
?
She
is
like
a
mad
woman
when
you
are
away
.
Does
n't
see
*NL*
anything
,
does
n't
remember
anything
,
''
she
went
on
,
repeating
her
usual
*NL*
phrases
.
``
Look
,
Anna
Timofeevna
,
''
she
added
to
her
companion
,
``
see
what
*NL*
a
box
for
cards
my
son
has
brought
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Belova
admired
the
presents
and
was
delighted
with
her
dress
material
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Pierre
,
Natasha
,
Nicholas
,
Countess
Mary
,
and
Denisov
had
much
to
*NL*
talk
about
that
they
could
not
discuss
before
the
old
countess
--
not
that
*NL*
anything
was
hidden
from
her
,
but
because
she
had
dropped
so
far
*NL*
behindhand
in
many
things
that
had
they
begun
to
converse
in
her
*NL*
presence
they
would
have
had
to
answer
inopportune
questions
and
to
*NL*
repeat
what
they
had
already
told
her
many
times
:
that
so-and-so
was
*NL*
dead
and
so-and-so
was
married
,
which
she
would
again
be
unable
to
*NL*
remember
--
yet
they
sat
at
tea
round
the
samovar
in
the
drawing
room
from
*NL*
habit
,
and
Pierre
answered
the
countess
'
questions
as
to
whether
Prince
*NL*
Vasili
had
aged
and
whether
Countess
Mary
Alexeevna
had
sent
greetings
*NL*
and
still
thought
of
them
,
and
other
matters
that
interested
no
one
and
*NL*
to
which
she
herself
was
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conversation
of
this
kind
,
interesting
to
no
one
yet
unavoidable
,
*NL*
continued
all
through
teatime
.
All
the
grown-up
members
of
the
family
*NL*
were
assembled
near
the
round
tea
table
at
which
Sonya
presided
beside
*NL*
the
samovar
.
The
children
with
their
tutors
and
governesses
had
had
tea
*NL*
and
their
voices
were
audible
from
the
next
room
.
At
tea
all
sat
in
*NL*
their
accustomed
places
:
Nicholas
beside
the
stove
at
a
small
table
*NL*
where
his
tea
was
handed
to
him
;
Milka
,
the
old
gray
borzoi
bitch
*NL*
-LRB-
daughter
of
the
first
Milka
-RRB-
,
with
a
quite
gray
face
and
large
black
*NL*
eyes
that
seemed
more
prominent
than
ever
,
lay
on
the
armchair
beside
*NL*
him
;
Denisov
,
whose
curly
hair
,
mustache
,
and
whiskers
had
turned
half
*NL*
gray
,
sat
beside
countess
Mary
with
his
general
's
tunic
unbuttoned
;
*NL*
Pierre
sat
between
his
wife
and
the
old
countess
.
He
spoke
of
what
he
*NL*
knew
might
interest
the
old
lady
and
that
she
could
understand
.
He
told
*NL*
her
of
external
social
events
and
of
the
people
who
had
formed
the
*NL*
circle
of
her
contemporaries
and
had
once
been
a
real
,
living
,
and
*NL*
distinct
group
,
but
who
were
now
for
the
most
part
scattered
about
the
*NL*
world
and
like
herself
were
garnering
the
last
ears
of
the
harvests
they
*NL*
had
sown
in
earlier
years
.
But
to
the
old
countess
those
contemporaries
*NL*
of
hers
seemed
to
be
the
only
serious
and
real
society
.
Natasha
saw
by
*NL*
Pierre
's
animation
that
his
visit
had
been
interesting
and
that
he
had
*NL*
much
to
tell
them
but
dare
not
say
it
before
the
old
countess
.
Denisov
,
*NL*
not
being
a
member
of
the
family
,
did
not
understand
Pierre
's
caution
*NL*
and
being
,
as
a
malcontent
,
much
interested
in
what
was
occurring
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
kept
urging
Pierre
to
tell
them
about
what
had
happened
in
*NL*
the
Semenovsk
regiment
,
then
about
Arakcheev
,
and
then
about
the
Bible
*NL*
Society
.
Once
or
twice
Pierre
was
carried
away
and
began
to
speak
of
*NL*
these
things
,
but
Nicholas
and
Natasha
always
brought
him
back
to
the
*NL*
health
of
Prince
Ivan
and
Countess
Mary
Alexeevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
all
this
idiocy
--
Gossner
and
Tatawinova
?
''
Denisov
asked
.
``
Is
*NL*
that
weally
still
going
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
on
?
''
Pierre
exclaimed
.
``
Why
more
than
ever
!
The
Bible
Society
is
*NL*
the
whole
government
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
,
mon
cher
ami
?
''
asked
the
countess
,
who
had
finished
her
*NL*
tea
and
evidently
needed
a
pretext
for
being
angry
after
her
meal
.
``
What
*NL*
are
you
saying
about
the
government
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
Maman
,
''
Nicholas
interposed
,
knowing
how
to
translate
*NL*
things
into
his
mother
's
language
,
``
Prince
Alexander
Golitsyn
has
*NL*
founded
a
society
and
in
consequence
has
great
influence
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arakcheev
and
Golitsyn
,
''
incautiously
remarked
Pierre
,
``
are
now
the
*NL*
whole
government
!
And
what
a
government
!
They
see
treason
everywhere
and
*NL*
are
afraid
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
is
Prince
Alexander
to
blame
?
He
is
a
most
estimable
man
.
*NL*
I
used
to
meet
him
at
Mary
Antonovna
's
,
''
said
the
countess
in
an
*NL*
offended
tone
;
and
still
more
offended
that
they
all
remained
silent
,
*NL*
she
went
on
:
``
Nowadays
everyone
finds
fault
.
A
Gospel
Society
!
Well
,
and
*NL*
what
harm
is
there
in
that
?
''
and
she
rose
-LRB-
everybody
else
got
up
too
-RRB-
*NL*
and
with
a
severe
expression
sailed
back
to
her
table
in
the
sitting
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
melancholy
silence
that
followed
was
broken
by
the
sounds
of
the
*NL*
children
's
voices
and
laughter
from
the
next
room
.
Evidently
some
jolly
*NL*
excitement
was
going
on
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finished
,
finished
!
''
little
Natasha
's
gleeful
yell
rose
above
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
exchanged
glances
with
Countess
Mary
and
Nicholas
-LRB-
Natasha
he
*NL*
never
lost
sight
of
-RRB-
and
smiled
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
delightful
music
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
Anna
Makarovna
has
finished
her
stocking
,
''
said
Countess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
go
and
see
,
''
said
Pierre
,
jumping
up
.
``
You
know
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
stopping
at
the
door
,
``
why
I
'm
especially
fond
of
that
music
?
It
is
*NL*
always
the
first
thing
that
tells
me
all
is
well
.
When
I
was
driving
*NL*
here
today
,
the
nearer
I
got
to
the
house
the
more
anxious
I
grew
.
As
I
*NL*
entered
the
anteroom
I
heard
Andrusha
's
peals
of
laughter
and
that
meant
*NL*
that
all
was
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
!
I
know
that
feeling
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
``
But
I
must
n't
go
there
--
*NL*
those
stockings
are
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
went
to
the
children
,
and
the
shouting
and
laughter
grew
still
*NL*
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Anna
Makarovna
,
''
Pierre
's
voice
was
heard
saying
,
``
come
here
into
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
room
and
at
the
word
of
command
,
`
One
,
two
,
'
and
when
*NL*
I
say
`
three
'
...
You
stand
here
,
and
you
in
my
arms
--
well
now
!
One
,
*NL*
two
!
...
''
said
Pierre
,
and
a
silence
followed
:
``
three
!
''
and
a
rapturously
*NL*
breathless
cry
of
children
's
voices
filled
the
room
.
``
Two
,
two
!
''
they
*NL*
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
meant
two
stockings
,
which
by
a
secret
process
known
only
to
*NL*
herself
Anna
Makarovna
used
to
knit
at
the
same
time
on
the
same
*NL*
needles
,
and
which
,
when
they
were
ready
,
she
always
triumphantly
drew
,
*NL*
one
out
of
the
other
,
in
the
children
's
presence
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
the
children
came
in
to
say
good
night
.
They
kissed
*NL*
everyone
,
the
tutors
and
governesses
made
their
bows
,
and
they
went
out
.
*NL*
Only
young
Nicholas
and
his
tutor
remained
.
Dessalles
whispered
to
the
*NL*
boy
to
come
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Monsieur
Dessalles
,
I
will
ask
my
aunt
to
let
me
stay
,
''
replied
*NL*
Nicholas
Bolkonski
also
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma
tante
,
please
let
me
stay
,
''
said
he
,
going
up
to
his
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
expressed
entreaty
,
agitation
,
and
ecstasy
.
Countess
Mary
*NL*
glanced
at
him
and
turned
to
Pierre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
are
here
he
ca
n't
tear
himself
away
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
bring
him
to
you
directly
,
Monsieur
Dessalles
.
Good
night
!
''
said
*NL*
Pierre
,
giving
his
hand
to
the
Swiss
tutor
,
and
he
turned
to
young
*NL*
Nicholas
with
a
smile
.
``
You
and
I
have
n't
seen
anything
of
one
another
*NL*
yet
...
How
like
he
is
growing
,
Mary
!
''
he
added
,
addressing
Countess
*NL*
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
my
father
?
''
asked
the
boy
,
flushing
crimson
and
looking
up
at
*NL*
Pierre
with
bright
,
ecstatic
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
nodded
,
and
went
on
with
what
he
had
been
saying
when
the
*NL*
children
had
interrupted
.
Countess
Mary
sat
down
doing
woolwork
;
Natasha
*NL*
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
her
husband
.
Nicholas
and
Denisov
rose
,
asked
*NL*
for
their
pipes
,
smoked
,
went
to
fetch
more
tea
from
Sonya
--
who
sat
*NL*
weary
but
resolute
at
the
samovar
--
and
questioned
Pierre
.
The
curly
-
*NL*
headed
,
delicate
boy
sat
with
shining
eyes
unnoticed
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
starting
every
now
and
then
and
muttering
something
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
evidently
experiencing
a
new
and
powerful
emotion
as
he
turned
his
curly
*NL*
head
,
with
his
thin
neck
exposed
by
his
turn-down
collar
,
toward
the
*NL*
place
where
Pierre
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
turned
on
the
contemporary
gossip
about
those
in
power
,
*NL*
in
which
most
people
see
the
chief
interest
of
home
politics
.
Denisov
,
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
the
government
on
account
of
his
own
disappointments
*NL*
in
the
service
,
heard
with
pleasure
of
the
things
done
in
Petersburg
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
stupid
,
and
made
forcible
and
sharp
comments
on
what
*NL*
Pierre
told
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
used
to
have
to
be
a
German
--
now
one
must
dance
with
Tatawinova
and
*NL*
Madame
Kwudener
,
and
wead
Ecka
`
tshausen
and
the
bwethwen
.
Oh
,
they
*NL*
should
let
that
fine
fellow
Bonaparte
loose
--
he
'd
knock
all
this
*NL*
nonsense
out
of
them
!
Fancy
giving
the
command
of
the
Semenov
wegiment
*NL*
to
a
fellow
like
that
Schwa
`
tz
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
though
free
from
Denisov
's
readiness
to
find
fault
with
*NL*
everything
,
also
thought
that
discussion
of
the
government
was
a
very
*NL*
serious
and
weighty
matter
,
and
the
fact
that
A
had
been
appointed
*NL*
Minister
of
This
and
B
Governor
General
of
That
,
and
that
the
Emperor
*NL*
had
said
so-and-so
and
this
minister
so-and-so
,
seemed
to
him
very
*NL*
important
.
And
so
he
thought
it
necessary
to
take
an
interest
in
these
*NL*
things
and
to
question
Pierre
.
The
questions
put
by
these
two
kept
the
*NL*
conversation
from
changing
its
ordinary
character
of
gossip
about
the
*NL*
higher
government
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Natasha
,
knowing
all
her
husband
's
ways
and
ideas
,
saw
that
he
had
*NL*
long
been
wishing
but
had
been
unable
to
divert
the
conversation
to
*NL*
another
channel
and
express
his
own
deeply
felt
idea
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
which
he
had
gone
to
Petersburg
to
consult
with
his
new
friend
Prince
*NL*
Theodore
,
and
she
helped
him
by
asking
how
his
affairs
with
Prince
*NL*
Theodore
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
about
?
''
asked
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
the
same
thing
,
''
said
Pierre
,
looking
round
at
his
listeners
.
*NL*
``
Everybody
sees
that
things
are
going
so
badly
that
they
can
not
be
*NL*
allowed
to
go
on
so
and
that
it
is
the
duty
of
all
decent
men
to
*NL*
counteract
it
as
far
as
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
decent
men
do
?
''
Nicholas
inquired
,
frowning
slightly
.
``
What
*NL*
can
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
into
my
study
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
had
long
expected
to
be
fetched
to
nurse
her
baby
,
now
*NL*
heard
the
nurse
calling
her
and
went
to
the
nursery
.
Countess
Mary
*NL*
followed
her
.
The
men
went
into
the
study
and
little
Nicholas
Bolkonski
*NL*
followed
them
unnoticed
by
his
uncle
and
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
*NL*
in
a
shady
corner
by
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
would
you
do
?
''
asked
Denisov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
some
fantastic
schemes
,
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
this
,
''
began
Pierre
,
not
sitting
down
but
pacing
the
room
,
*NL*
sometimes
stopping
short
,
gesticulating
,
and
lisping
:
``
the
position
in
*NL*
Petersburg
is
this
:
the
Emperor
does
not
look
into
anything
.
He
has
*NL*
abandoned
himself
altogether
to
this
mysticism
''
-LRB-
Pierre
could
not
*NL*
tolerate
mysticism
in
anyone
now
-RRB-
.
``
He
seeks
only
for
peace
,
and
only
*NL*
these
people
sans
foi
ni
loi
*
can
give
it
him
--
people
who
recklessly
*NL*
hack
at
and
strangle
everything
--
Magnitski
,
Arakcheev
,
and
tutti
*NL*
quanti
...
You
will
agree
that
if
you
did
not
look
after
your
estates
*NL*
yourself
but
only
wanted
a
quiet
life
,
the
harsher
your
steward
was
the
*NL*
more
readily
your
object
might
be
attained
,
''
he
said
to
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*
Without
faith
or
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
does
that
lead
up
to
?
''
said
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
everything
is
going
to
ruin
!
Robbery
in
the
law
courts
,
in
the
*NL*
army
nothing
but
flogging
,
drilling
,
and
Military
Settlements
;
the
*NL*
people
are
tortured
,
enlightenment
is
suppressed
.
All
that
is
young
and
*NL*
honest
is
crushed
!
Everyone
sees
that
this
can
not
go
on
.
Everything
is
*NL*
strained
to
such
a
degree
that
it
will
certainly
break
,
''
said
Pierre
-LRB-
as
*NL*
those
who
examine
the
actions
of
any
government
have
always
said
since
*NL*
governments
began
-RRB-
.
``
I
told
them
just
one
thing
in
Petersburg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Told
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
whom
,
''
said
Pierre
,
with
a
meaning
glance
from
under
his
*NL*
brows
.
``
Prince
Theodore
and
all
those
.
To
encourage
culture
and
*NL*
philanthropy
is
all
very
well
of
course
.
The
aim
is
excellent
but
in
the
*NL*
present
circumstances
something
else
is
needed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Nicholas
noticed
the
presence
of
his
nephew
.
His
face
*NL*
darkened
and
he
went
up
to
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Let
him
be
,
''
said
Pierre
,
taking
Nicholas
by
the
arm
and
*NL*
continuing
.
``
That
is
not
enough
,
I
told
them
.
Something
else
is
needed

*NL*
When
you
stand
expecting
the
overstrained
string
to
snap
at
any
moment
,
*NL*
when
everyone
is
expecting
the
inevitable
catastrophe
,
as
many
as
*NL*
possible
must
join
hands
as
closely
as
they
can
to
withstand
the
general
*NL*
calamity
.
Everything
that
is
young
and
strong
is
being
enticed
away
and
*NL*
depraved
.
One
is
lured
by
women
,
another
by
honors
,
a
third
by
ambition
*NL*
or
money
,
and
they
go
over
to
that
camp
.
No
independent
men
,
such
as
you
*NL*
or
I
,
are
left
.
What
I
say
is
widen
the
scope
of
our
society
,
let
the
*NL*
mot
d'ordre
be
not
virtue
alone
but
independence
and
action
as
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
,
who
had
left
his
nephew
,
irritably
pushed
up
an
armchair
,
sat
*NL*
down
in
it
,
and
listened
to
Pierre
,
coughing
discontentedly
and
frowning
*NL*
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
action
with
what
aim
?
''
he
cried
.
``
And
what
position
will
you
adopt
*NL*
toward
the
government
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
position
of
assistants

The
society
need
not
be
secret
if
the
*NL*
government
allows
it
.
Not
merely
is
it
not
hostile
to
government
,
but
it
*NL*
is
a
society
of
true
conservatives
--
a
society
of
gentlemen
in
the
full
*NL*
meaning
of
that
word
.
It
is
only
to
prevent
some
Pugachev
or
other
from
*NL*
killing
my
children
and
yours
,
and
Arakcheev
from
sending
me
off
to
some
*NL*
Military
Settlement

We

general
safety

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it

*NL*
``
Why

''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
,
who
had
come
in
during
the
conversation
,
looked
joyfully
at
her
*NL*
husband
.
It
was
not
what
he
was
saying
that
pleased
her
--
that
did
not
*NL*
even
interest
her
,
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
was
all
extremely
simple
*NL*
and
that
she
had
known
it
a
long
time
-LRB-
it
seemed
so
to
her
because
she
*NL*
knew
that
it
sprang
from
Pierre
's
whole
soul
-RRB-
,
but
it
was
his
animated
*NL*
and
enthusiastic
appearance
that
made
her
glad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
with
the
thin
neck
stretching
out
from
the
turn-down
collar
--
*NL*
whom
everyone
had
forgotten
--
gazed
at
Pierre
with
even
greater
and
more
*NL*
rapturous
joy
.
Every
word
of
Pierre
's
burned
into
his
heart
,
and
with
a
*NL*
nervous
movement
of
his
fingers
he
unconsciously
broke
the
sealing
wax
*NL*
and
quill
pens
his
hands
came
upon
on
his
uncle
's
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not
at
all

I
am

``
No

Denisov
in
a
loud
and
resolute
voice
.

*NL*
Pierre
smiled
,
Natasha
began
to
laugh
,
but
Nicholas
knitted
his
brows
*NL*
still
more
and
began
proving
to
Pierre
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
any
*NL*
great
change
and
that
all
the
danger
he
spoke
of
existed
only
in
his
*NL*
imagination

Pierre
maintained
the
contrary
,
and
as
his
mental
faculties
*NL*
were
greater
and
more
resourceful
,
Nicholas
felt
himself
cornered
.
This
*NL*
made
him
still
angrier
,
for
he
was
fully
convinced
,
not
by
reasoning
but
*NL*
by
something
within
him
stronger
than
reason
,
of
the
justice
of
his
*NL*
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
this
,
''
he
said
,
rising
and
trying
with
nervously
*NL*
twitching
fingers
to
prop
up
his
pipe
in
a
corner
,
but
finally
*NL*
abandoning
the
attempt
.
``
I
ca
n't
prove
it
to
you
.
You
say
that
*NL*
everything
here
is
rotten
and
that
an
overthrow
is
coming
:
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
it
.
But
you
also
say
that
our
oath
of
allegiance
is
a
conditional
*NL*
matter
,
and
to
that
I
reply
:
`
You
are
my
best
friend
,
as
you
know
,
but
*NL*
if
you
formed
a
secret
society
and
began
working
against
the
government
-
*NL*
-
be
it
what
it
may
--
I
know
it
is
my
duty
to
obey
the
government
.
And
if
*NL*
Arakcheev
ordered
me
to
lead
a
squadron
against
you
and
cut
you
down
,
I
*NL*
should
not
hesitate
an
instant
,
but
should
do
it
.
'
And
you
may
argue
*NL*
about
that
as
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
awkward
silence
followed
these
words
.
Natasha
was
the
first
to
speak
,
*NL*
defending
her
husband
and
attacking
her
brother
.
Her
defense
was
weak
*NL*
and
inapt
but
she
attained
her
object
.
The
conversation
was
resumed
,
and
*NL*
no
longer
in
the
unpleasantly
hostile
tone
of
Nicholas
'
last
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
all
got
up
to
go
in
to
supper
,
little
Nicholas
Bolkonski
went
*NL*
up
to
Pierre
,
pale
and
with
shining
,
radiant
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Pierre
,
you
...
no
...
If
Papa
were
alive
...
would
he
agree
with
*NL*
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Pierre
suddenly
realized
what
a
special
,
independent
,
complex
,
and
*NL*
powerful
process
of
thought
and
feeling
must
have
been
going
on
in
this
*NL*
boy
during
that
conversation
,
and
remembering
all
he
had
said
he
*NL*
regretted
that
the
lad
should
have
heard
him
.
He
had
,
however
,
to
give
*NL*
him
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
he
said
reluctantly
,
and
left
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
looked
down
and
seemed
now
for
the
first
time
to
notice
what
he
*NL*
had
done
to
the
things
on
the
table
.
He
flushed
and
went
up
to
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
,
forgive
me
,
I
did
that
...
unintentionally
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
broken
sealing
wax
and
pens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
started
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
he
said
,
throwing
the
bits
under
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
evidently
suppressing
his
vexation
with
difficulty
,
he
turned
away
*NL*
from
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
not
to
have
been
here
at
all
,
''
he
said
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
at
supper
was
not
about
politics
or
societies
,
but
*NL*
turned
on
the
subject
Nicholas
liked
best
--
recollections
of
1812
.
*NL*
Denisov
started
these
and
Pierre
was
particularly
agreeable
and
amusing
*NL*
about
them
.
The
family
separated
on
the
most
friendly
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
Nicholas
,
having
undressed
in
his
study
and
given
*NL*
instructions
to
the
steward
who
had
been
waiting
for
him
,
went
to
the
*NL*
bedroom
in
his
dressing
gown
,
where
he
found
his
wife
still
at
her
*NL*
table
,
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
writing
,
Mary
?
''
Nicholas
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
blushed
.
She
was
afraid
that
what
she
was
writing
would
*NL*
not
be
understood
or
approved
by
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
wanted
to
conceal
what
she
was
writing
from
him
,
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
was
glad
he
had
surprised
her
at
it
and
that
she
would
now
have
to
*NL*
tell
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
diary
,
Nicholas
,
''
she
replied
,
handing
him
a
blue
exercise
book
*NL*
filled
with
her
firm
,
bold
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
diary
?
''
Nicholas
repeated
with
a
shade
of
irony
,
and
he
took
up
the
*NL*
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
December
4
.
Today
when
Andrusha
-LRB-
her
eldest
boy
-RRB-
woke
up
he
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
dress
and
Mademoiselle
Louise
sent
for
me
.
He
was
naughty
and
*NL*
obstinate
.
I
tried
threats
,
but
he
only
grew
angrier
.
Then
I
took
the
*NL*
matter
in
hand
:
I
left
him
alone
and
began
with
nurse
's
help
to
get
the
*NL*
other
children
up
,
telling
him
that
I
did
not
love
him
.
For
a
long
time
*NL*
he
was
silent
,
as
if
astonished
,
then
he
jumped
out
of
bed
,
ran
to
me
in
*NL*
his
shirt
,
and
sobbed
so
that
I
could
not
calm
him
for
a
long
time
.
It
*NL*
was
plain
that
what
troubled
him
most
was
that
he
had
grieved
me
.
*NL*
Afterwards
in
the
evening
when
I
gave
him
his
ticket
,
he
again
began
*NL*
crying
piteously
and
kissing
me
.
One
can
do
anything
with
him
by
*NL*
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
`
ticket
'
?
''
Nicholas
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
begun
giving
the
elder
ones
marks
every
evening
,
showing
how
*NL*
they
have
behaved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
looked
into
the
radiant
eyes
that
were
gazing
at
him
,
and
*NL*
continued
to
turn
over
the
pages
and
read
.
In
the
diary
was
set
down
*NL*
everything
in
the
children
's
lives
that
seemed
noteworthy
to
their
*NL*
mother
as
showing
their
characters
or
suggesting
general
reflections
on
*NL*
educational
methods
.
They
were
for
the
most
part
quite
insignificant
*NL*
trifles
,
but
did
not
seem
so
to
the
mother
or
to
the
father
either
,
now
*NL*
that
he
read
this
diary
about
his
children
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
date
``
5
''
was
entered
:
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
naughty
at
table
.
Papa
said
he
was
to
have
no
pudding
.
He
had
*NL*
none
,
but
looked
so
unhappily
and
greedily
at
the
others
while
they
were
*NL*
eating
!
I
think
that
punishment
by
depriving
children
of
sweets
only
*NL*
develops
their
greediness
.
Must
tell
Nicholas
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicholas
put
down
the
book
and
looked
at
his
wife
.
The
radiant
eyes
*NL*
gazed
at
him
questioningly
:
would
he
approve
or
disapprove
of
her
diary
?
*NL*
There
could
be
no
doubt
not
only
of
his
approval
but
also
of
his
*NL*
admiration
for
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
need
not
be
done
so
pedantically
,
thought
Nicholas
,
or
even
*NL*
done
at
all
,
but
this
untiring
,
continual
spiritual
effort
of
which
the
*NL*
sole
aim
was
the
children
's
moral
welfare
delighted
him
.
Had
Nicholas
*NL*
been
able
to
analyze
his
feelings
he
would
have
found
that
his
steady
,
*NL*
tender
,
and
proud
love
of
his
wife
rested
on
his
feeling
of
wonder
at
*NL*
her
spirituality
and
at
the
lofty
moral
world
,
almost
beyond
his
reach
,
*NL*
in
which
she
had
her
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
proud
of
her
intelligence
and
goodness
,
recognized
his
own
*NL*
insignificance
beside
her
in
the
spiritual
world
,
and
rejoiced
all
the
*NL*
more
that
she
with
such
a
soul
not
only
belonged
to
him
but
was
part
of
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
,
quite
approve
,
my
dearest
!
''
said
he
with
a
significant
look
,
*NL*
and
after
a
short
pause
he
added
:
``
And
I
behaved
badly
today
.
You
*NL*
were
n't
in
the
study
.
We
began
disputing
--
Pierre
and
I
--
and
I
lost
my
*NL*
temper
.
But
he
is
impossible
:
such
a
child
!
I
do
n't
know
what
would
*NL*
become
of
him
if
Natasha
did
n't
keep
him
in
hand
...
Have
you
any
idea
*NL*
why
he
went
to
Petersburg
?
They
have
formed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
.
``
Natasha
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
you
know
,
''
Nicholas
went
on
,
growing
hot
at
the
mere
*NL*
recollection
of
their
discussion
,
``
he
wanted
to
convince
me
that
it
is
*NL*
every
honest
man
's
duty
to
go
against
the
government
,
and
that
the
oath
*NL*
of
allegiance
and
duty
...
I
am
sorry
you
were
n't
there
.
They
all
fell
on
*NL*
me
--
Denisov
and
Natasha
...
Natasha
is
absurd
.
How
she
rules
over
him
!
*NL*
And
yet
there
need
only
be
a
discussion
and
she
has
no
words
of
her
own
*NL*
but
only
repeats
his
sayings
...
''
added
Nicholas
,
yielding
to
that
*NL*
irresistible
inclination
which
tempts
us
to
judge
those
nearest
and
*NL*
dearest
to
us
.
He
forgot
that
what
he
was
saying
about
Natasha
could
*NL*
have
been
applied
word
for
word
to
himself
in
relation
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
noticed
that
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
told
him
that
duty
and
the
oath
were
above
everything
,
he
*NL*
started
proving
goodness
knows
what
!
A
pity
you
were
not
there
--
what
*NL*
would
you
have
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
see
it
you
were
quite
right
,
and
I
told
Natasha
so
.
Pierre
says
*NL*
everybody
is
suffering
,
tortured
,
and
being
corrupted
,
and
that
it
is
*NL*
our
duty
to
help
our
neighbor
.
Of
course
he
is
right
there
,
''
said
*NL*
Countess
Mary
,
``
but
he
forgets
that
we
have
other
duties
nearer
to
us
,
*NL*
duties
indicated
to
us
by
God
Himself
,
and
that
though
we
might
expose
*NL*
ourselves
to
risks
we
must
not
risk
our
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
!
That
's
just
what
I
said
to
him
,
''
put
in
Nicholas
,
who
*NL*
fancied
he
really
had
said
it
.
``
But
they
insisted
on
their
own
view
:
*NL*
love
of
one
's
neighbor
and
Christianity
--
and
all
this
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
young
Nicholas
,
who
had
gone
into
my
study
and
broke
all
my
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Nicholas
,
do
you
know
I
am
often
troubled
about
little
Nicholas
,
''
*NL*
said
Countess
Mary
.
``
He
is
such
an
exceptional
boy
.
I
am
afraid
I
*NL*
neglect
him
in
favor
of
my
own
:
we
all
have
children
and
relations
while
*NL*
he
has
no
one
.
He
is
constantly
alone
with
his
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
you
need
reproach
yourself
on
his
account

All
that
*NL*
the
fondest
mother
could
do
for
her
son
you
have
done
and
are
doing
for
*NL*
him
,
and
of
course
I
am
glad
of
it

He
is
a
fine
lad
,
a
fine
lad

This
*NL*
evening
he
listened
to
Pierre
in
a
sort
of
trance
,
and
fancy
--
as
we
were
*NL*
going
in
to
supper
I
looked
and
he
had
broken
everything
on
my
table
to
*NL*
bits
,
and
he
told
me
of
it
himself
at
once
!
I
never
knew
him
to
tell
an
*NL*
untruth
.
A
fine
lad
,
a
fine
lad
!
''
repeated
Nicholas
,
who
at
heart
was
*NL*
not
fond
of
Nicholas
Bolkonski
but
was
always
anxious
to
recognize
that
*NL*
he
was
a
fine
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
I
am
not
the
same
as
his
own
mother
,
''
said
Countess
Mary
.
``
I
*NL*
feel
I
am
not
the
same
and
it
troubles
me
.
A
wonderful
boy
,
but
I
am
*NL*
dreadfully
afraid
for
him
.
It
would
be
good
for
him
to
have
companions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
it
wo
n't
be
for
long

Next
summer
I
'll
take
him
to
Petersburg
,
''
*NL*
said
Nicholas
.
``
Yes
,
Pierre
always
was
a
dreamer
and
always
will
be
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
returning
to
the
talk
in
the
study
which
had
evidently
*NL*
disturbed
him
.
``
Well
,
what
business
is
it
of
mine
what
goes
on
there
--
*NL*
whether
Arakcheev
is
bad
,
and
all
that
?
What
business
was
it
of
mine
*NL*
when
I
married
and
was
so
deep
in
debt
that
I
was
threatened
with
*NL*
prison
,
and
had
a
mother
who
could
not
see
or
understand
it
?
And
then
*NL*
there
are
you
and
the
children
and
our
affairs
.
Is
it
for
my
own
*NL*
pleasure
that
I
am
at
the
farm
or
in
the
office
from
morning
to
night
?
*NL*
No
,
but
I
know
I
must
work
to
comfort
my
mother
,
to
repay
you
,
and
not
*NL*
to
leave
the
children
such
beggars
as
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
wanted
to
tell
him
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
*NL*
and
that
he
attached
too
much
importance
to
these
matters
.
But
she
knew
*NL*
she
must
not
say
this
and
that
it
would
be
useless
to
do
so
.
She
only
*NL*
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
.
He
took
this
as
a
sign
of
approval
and
a
*NL*
confirmation
of
his
thoughts
,
and
after
a
few
minutes
'
reflection
*NL*
continued
to
think
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Mary
,
today
Elias
Mitrofanych
''
-LRB-
this
was
his
overseer
-RRB-
``
came
*NL*
back
from
the
Tambov
estate
and
told
me
they
are
already
offering
eighty
*NL*
thousand
rubles
for
the
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
an
eager
face
Nicholas
began
to
speak
of
the
possibility
of
*NL*
repurchasing
Otradnoe
before
long
,
and
added
:
``
Another
ten
years
of
life
*NL*
and
I
shall
leave
the
children
...
in
an
excellent
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Mary
listened
to
her
husband
and
understood
all
that
he
told
*NL*
her
.
She
knew
that
when
he
thought
aloud
in
this
way
he
would
sometimes
*NL*
ask
her
what
he
had
been
saying
,
and
be
vexed
if
he
noticed
that
she
had
*NL*
been
thinking
about
something
else
.
But
she
had
to
force
herself
to
*NL*
attend
,
for
what
he
was
saying
did
not
interest
her
at
all
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
him
and
did
not
think
,
but
felt
,
about
something
different
.
She
felt
*NL*
a
submissive
tender
love
for
this
man
who
would
never
understand
all
*NL*
that
she
understood
,
and
this
seemed
to
make
her
love
for
him
still
*NL*
stronger
and
added
a
touch
of
passionate
tenderness
.
Besides
this
*NL*
feeling
which
absorbed
her
altogether
and
hindered
her
from
following
*NL*
the
details
of
her
husband
's
plans
,
thoughts
that
had
no
connection
with
*NL*
what
he
was
saying
flitted
through
her
mind
.
She
thought
of
her
nephew
.
*NL*
Her
husband
's
account
of
the
boy
's
agitation
while
Pierre
was
speaking
*NL*
struck
her
forcibly
,
and
various
traits
of
his
gentle
,
sensitive
*NL*
character
recurred
to
her
mind
;
and
while
thinking
of
her
nephew
she
*NL*
thought
also
of
her
own
children
.
She
did
not
compare
them
with
him
,
but
*NL*
compared
her
feeling
for
them
with
her
feeling
for
him
,
and
felt
with
*NL*
regret
that
there
was
something
lacking
in
her
feeling
for
young
*NL*
Nicholas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
this
difference
arose
from
the
*NL*
difference
in
their
ages
,
but
she
felt
herself
to
blame
toward
him
and
*NL*
promised
in
her
heart
to
do
better
and
to
accomplish
the
impossible
--
in
*NL*
this
life
to
love
her
husband
,
her
children
,
little
Nicholas
,
and
all
*NL*
her
neighbors
,
as
Christ
loved
mankind
.
Countess
Mary
's
soul
always
*NL*
strove
toward
the
infinite
,
the
eternal
,
and
the
absolute
,
and
could
*NL*
therefore
never
be
at
peace
.
A
stern
expression
of
the
lofty
,
secret
*NL*
suffering
of
a
soul
burdened
by
the
body
appeared
on
her
face
.
Nicholas
*NL*
gazed
at
her
.
``
O
God
!
What
will
become
of
us
if
she
dies
,
as
I
always
*NL*
fear
when
her
face
is
like
that
?
''
thought
he
,
and
placing
himself
before
*NL*
the
icon
he
began
to
say
his
evening
prayers
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
and
Pierre
,
left
alone
,
also
began
to
talk
as
only
a
husband
and
*NL*
wife
can
talk
,
that
is
,
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
rapidity
,
*NL*
understanding
and
expressing
each
other
's
thoughts
in
ways
contrary
to
*NL*
all
rules
of
logic
,
without
premises
,
deductions
,
or
conclusions
,
and
in
*NL*
a
quite
peculiar
way
.
Natasha
was
so
used
to
this
kind
of
talk
with
her
*NL*
husband
that
for
her
it
was
the
surest
sign
of
something
being
wrong
*NL*
between
them
if
Pierre
followed
a
line
of
logical
reasoning
.
When
he
*NL*
began
proving
anything
,
or
talking
argumentatively
and
calmly
and
she
,
*NL*
led
on
by
his
example
,
began
to
do
the
same
,
she
knew
that
they
were
on
*NL*
the
verge
of
a
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
they
were
alone
and
Natasha
came
up
to
him
with
wide
-
*NL*
open
happy
eyes
,
and
quickly
seizing
his
head
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
Now
you
are
all
mine
,
mine
!
You
wo
n't
escape
!
''
--
from
that
*NL*
moment
this
conversation
began
,
contrary
to
all
the
laws
of
logic
and
*NL*
contrary
to
them
because
quite
different
subjects
were
talked
about
at
*NL*
one
and
the
same
time
.
This
simultaneous
discussion
of
many
topics
did
*NL*
not
prevent
a
clear
understanding
but
on
the
contrary
was
the
surest
*NL*
sign
that
they
fully
understood
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
in
a
dream
when
all
is
uncertain
,
unreasoning
,
and
*NL*
contradictory
,
except
the
feeling
that
guides
the
dream
,
so
in
this
*NL*
intercourse
contrary
to
all
laws
of
reason
,
the
words
themselves
were
*NL*
not
consecutive
and
clear
but
only
the
feeling
that
prompted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
spoke
to
Pierre
about
her
brother
's
life
and
doings
,
of
how
she
*NL*
had
suffered
and
lacked
life
during
his
own
absence
,
and
of
how
she
was
*NL*
fonder
than
ever
of
Mary
,
and
how
Mary
was
in
every
way
better
than
*NL*
herself
.
In
saying
this
Natasha
was
sincere
in
acknowledging
Mary
's
*NL*
superiority
,
but
at
the
same
time
by
saying
it
she
made
a
demand
on
*NL*
Pierre
that
he
should
,
all
the
same
,
prefer
her
to
Mary
and
to
all
other
*NL*
women
,
and
that
now
,
especially
after
having
seen
many
women
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
he
should
tell
her
so
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
,
answering
Natasha
's
words
,
told
her
how
intolerable
it
had
been
*NL*
for
him
to
meet
ladies
at
dinners
and
balls
in
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
quite
lost
the
knack
of
talking
to
ladies
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
was
*NL*
simply
dull
.
Besides
,
I
was
very
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
looked
intently
at
him
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mary
is
so
splendid
,
''
she
said
.
``
How
she
understands
children
!
It
is
as
*NL*
if
she
saw
straight
into
their
souls
.
Yesterday
,
for
instance
,
Mitya
was
*NL*
naughty
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
like
his
father
he
is
,
''
Pierre
interjected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
knew
why
he
mentioned
Mitya
's
likeness
to
Nicholas
:
the
*NL*
recollection
of
his
dispute
with
his
brother-in-law
was
unpleasant
and
*NL*
he
wanted
to
know
what
Natasha
thought
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicholas
has
the
weakness
of
never
agreeing
with
anything
not
generally
*NL*
accepted
.
But
I
understand
that
you
value
what
opens
up
a
fresh
line
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
repeating
words
Pierre
had
once
uttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
chief
point
is
that
to
Nicholas
ideas
and
discussions
are
an
*NL*
amusement
--
almost
a
pastime
,
''
said
Pierre
.
``
For
instance
,
he
is
*NL*
collecting
a
library
and
has
made
it
a
rule
not
to
buy
a
new
book
till
*NL*
he
has
read
what
he
had
already
bought
--
Sismondi
and
Rousseau
and
*NL*
Montesquieu
,
''
he
added
with
a
smile
.
``
You
know
how
much
I.
.
.
''
he
began
*NL*
to
soften
down
what
he
had
said
;
but
Natasha
interrupted
him
to
show
*NL*
that
this
was
unnecessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
say
ideas
are
an
amusement
to
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
for
me
nothing
else
is
serious
.
All
the
time
in
Petersburg
I
*NL*
saw
everyone
as
in
a
dream
.
When
I
am
taken
up
by
a
thought
,
all
else
is
*NL*
mere
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
so
sorry
I
was
n't
there
when
you
met
the
children
,
''
said
*NL*
Natasha
.
``
Which
was
most
delighted
?
Lisa
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Pierre
replied
,
and
went
on
with
what
was
in
his
mind
.
``
Nicholas
*NL*
says
we
ought
not
to
think
.
But
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
Besides
,
when
I
was
in
*NL*
Petersburg
I
felt
-LRB-
I
can
say
this
to
you
-RRB-
that
the
whole
affair
would
go
*NL*
to
pieces
without
me
--
everyone
was
pulling
his
own
way
.
But
I
succeeded
*NL*
in
uniting
them
all
;
and
then
my
idea
is
so
clear
and
simple
.
You
see
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
that
we
ought
to
oppose
this
and
that
.
We
may
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
What
I
say
is
:
`
Join
hands
,
you
who
love
the
right
,
and
let
there
be
but
*NL*
one
banner
--
that
of
active
virtue
.
'
Prince
Sergey
is
a
fine
fellow
and
*NL*
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Natasha
would
have
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
greatness
of
Pierre
's
idea
,
*NL*
but
one
thing
disconcerted
her
.
``
Can
a
man
so
important
and
necessary
to
*NL*
society
be
also
my
husband
?
How
did
this
happen
?
''
She
wished
to
express
*NL*
this
doubt
to
him
.
``
Now
who
could
decide
whether
he
is
really
cleverer
*NL*
than
all
the
others
?
''
she
asked
herself
,
and
passed
in
review
all
those
*NL*
whom
Pierre
most
respected
.
Judging
by
what
he
had
said
there
was
no
one
*NL*
he
had
respected
so
highly
as
Platon
Karataev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
am
thinking
about
?
''
she
asked
.
``
About
Platon
*NL*
Karataev
.
Would
he
have
approved
of
you
now
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
this
question
.
He
understood
his
*NL*
wife
's
line
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Platon
Karataev
?
''
he
repeated
,
and
pondered
,
evidently
sincerely
trying
*NL*
to
imagine
Karataev
's
opinion
on
the
subject
.
``
He
would
not
have
*NL*
understood
...
yet
perhaps
he
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
awfully
!
''
Natasha
suddenly
said
.
``
Awfully
,
awfully
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
would
not
have
approved
,
''
said
Pierre
,
after
reflection
.
``
What
*NL*
he
would
have
approved
of
is
our
family
life
.
He
was
always
so
anxious
*NL*
to
find
seemliness
,
happiness
,
and
peace
in
everything
,
and
I
should
*NL*
have
been
proud
to
let
him
see
us
.
There
now
--
you
talk
of
my
absence
,
*NL*
but
you
would
n't
believe
what
a
special
feeling
I
have
for
you
after
a
*NL*
separation
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
should
think
...
''
Natasha
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
not
that
.
I
never
leave
off
loving
you
.
And
one
could
n't
love
*NL*
more
,
but
this
is
something
special
...
Yes
,
of
course
-
''
he
did
not
*NL*
finish
because
their
eyes
meeting
said
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
it
is
,
''
Natasha
suddenly
exclaimed
,
``
about
honeymoons
,
*NL*
and
that
the
greatest
happiness
is
at
first
!
On
the
contrary
,
now
is
the
*NL*
best
of
all
.
If
only
you
did
not
go
away
!
Do
you
remember
how
we
*NL*
quarreled
?
And
it
was
always
my
fault
.
Always
mine
.
And
what
we
*NL*
quarreled
about
--
I
do
n't
even
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
about
the
same
thing
,
''
said
Pierre
with
a
smile
.
``
Jealo
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
it
!
I
ca
n't
bear
it
!
''
Natasha
cried
,
and
her
eyes
glittered
*NL*
coldly
and
vindictively
.
``
Did
you
see
her
?
''
she
added
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
and
if
I
had
I
should
n't
have
recognized
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
know
?
While
you
were
talking
in
the
study
I
was
looking
at
*NL*
you
,
''
Natasha
began
,
evidently
anxious
to
disperse
the
cloud
that
had
*NL*
come
over
them
.
``
You
are
as
like
him
as
two
peas
--
like
the
boy
.
''
-LRB-
She
*NL*
meant
her
little
son
.
-RRB-
``
Oh
,
it
's
time
to
go
to
him
...
The
milk
's
*NL*
come
...
But
I
'm
sorry
to
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
few
seconds
.
Then
suddenly
turning
to
one
another
*NL*
at
the
same
time
they
both
began
to
speak
.
Pierre
began
with
self
-
*NL*
satisfaction
and
enthusiasm
,
Natasha
with
a
quiet
,
happy
smile
.
Having
*NL*
interrupted
one
another
they
both
stopped
to
let
the
other
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
What
did
you
say
?
Go
on
,
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
go
on
,
I
was
talking
nonsense
,
''
said
Natasha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pierre
finished
what
he
had
begun
.
It
was
the
sequel
to
his
complacent
*NL*
reflections
on
his
success
in
Petersburg
.
At
that
moment
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
that
he
was
chosen
to
give
a
new
direction
to
the
whole
of
Russian
*NL*
society
and
to
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wished
to
say
that
ideas
that
have
great
results
are
always
*NL*
simple
ones
.
My
whole
idea
is
that
if
vicious
people
are
united
and
*NL*
constitute
a
power
,
then
honest
folk
must
do
the
same
.
Now
that
's
simple
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
were
you
going
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Only
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
nothing
,
only
a
trifle
,
''
said
Natasha
,
smilingly
still
more
*NL*
brightly
.
``
I
only
wanted
to
tell
you
about
Petya
:
today
nurse
was
coming
*NL*
to
take
him
from
me
,
and
he
laughed
,
shut
his
eyes
,
and
clung
to
me
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
he
thought
he
was
hiding
.
Awfully
sweet
!
There
,
now
he
's
crying
.
*NL*
Well
,
good-by
!
''
and
she
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
downstairs
in
young
Nicholas
Bolkonski
's
bedroom
a
little
lamp
*NL*
was
burning
as
usual
.
-LRB-
The
boy
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
they
could
not
*NL*
cure
him
of
it
.
-RRB-
Dessalles
slept
propped
up
on
four
pillows
and
his
*NL*
Roman
nose
emitted
sounds
of
rhythmic
snoring
.
Little
Nicholas
,
who
had
*NL*
just
waked
up
in
a
cold
perspiration
,
sat
up
in
bed
and
gazed
before
him
*NL*
with
wide-open
eyes
.
He
had
awaked
from
a
terrible
dream
.
He
had
dreamed
*NL*
that
he
and
Uncle
Pierre
,
wearing
helmets
such
as
were
depicted
in
his
*NL*
Plutarch
,
were
leading
a
huge
army
.
The
army
was
made
up
of
white
*NL*
slanting
lines
that
filled
the
air
like
the
cobwebs
that
float
about
in
*NL*
autumn
and
which
Dessalles
called
les
fils
de
la
Vierge
.
In
front
was
*NL*
Glory
,
which
was
similar
to
those
threads
but
rather
thicker
.
He
and
*NL*
Pierre
were
borne
along
lightly
and
joyously
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
*NL*
goal
.
Suddenly
the
threads
that
moved
them
began
to
slacken
and
become
*NL*
entangled
and
it
grew
difficult
to
move
.
And
Uncle
Nicholas
stood
before
*NL*
them
in
a
stern
and
threatening
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
done
this
?
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
some
broken
sealing
wax
and
*NL*
pens
.
``
I
loved
you
,
but
I
have
orders
from
Arakcheev
and
will
kill
the
*NL*
first
of
you
who
moves
forward
.
''
Little
Nicholas
turned
to
look
at
*NL*
Pierre
but
Pierre
was
no
longer
there
.
In
his
place
was
his
father
--
*NL*
Prince
Andrew
--
and
his
father
had
neither
shape
nor
form
,
but
he
*NL*
existed
,
and
when
little
Nicholas
perceived
him
he
grew
faint
with
love
:
*NL*
he
felt
himself
powerless
,
limp
,
and
formless
.
His
father
caressed
and
*NL*
pitied
him
.
But
Uncle
Nicholas
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
them
.
Terror
*NL*
seized
young
Nicholas
and
he
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
!
''
he
thought
.
-LRB-
Though
there
were
two
good
portraits
of
Prince
*NL*
Andrew
in
the
house
,
Nicholas
never
imagined
him
in
human
form
.
-RRB-
``
My
*NL*
father
has
been
with
me
and
caressed
me
.
He
approved
of
me
and
of
Uncle
*NL*
Pierre
.
Whatever
he
may
tell
me
,
I
will
do
it
.
Mucius
Scaevola
burned
*NL*
his
hand
.
Why
should
not
the
same
sort
of
thing
happen
to
me
?
I
know
*NL*
they
want
me
to
learn
.
And
I
will
learn
.
But
someday
I
shall
have
*NL*
finished
learning
,
and
then
I
will
do
something
.
I
only
pray
God
that
*NL*
something
may
happen
to
me
such
as
happened
to
Plutarch
's
men
,
and
I
*NL*
will
act
as
they
did
.
I
will
do
better
.
Everyone
shall
know
me
,
love
me
,
*NL*
and
be
delighted
with
me
!
''
And
suddenly
his
bosom
heaved
with
sobs
and
*NL*
he
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ill
?
''
he
heard
Dessalles
'
voice
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Nicholas
,
and
lay
back
on
his
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
good
and
kind
and
I
am
fond
of
him
!
''
he
thought
of
Dessalles
.
*NL*
``
But
Uncle
Pierre
!
Oh
,
what
a
wonderful
man
he
is
!
And
my
father
?
Oh
,
*NL*
Father
,
Father
!
Yes
,
I
will
do
something
with
which
even
he
would
be
*NL*
satisfied

SECOND
EPILOGUE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
History
is
the
life
of
nations
and
of
humanity
.
To
seize
and
put
into
*NL*
words
,
to
describe
directly
the
life
of
humanity
or
even
of
a
single
*NL*
nation
,
appears
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ancient
historians
all
employed
one
and
the
same
method
to
describe
*NL*
and
seize
the
apparently
elusive
--
the
life
of
a
people
.
They
described
*NL*
the
activity
of
individuals
who
ruled
the
people
,
and
regarded
the
*NL*
activity
of
those
men
as
representing
the
activity
of
the
whole
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
:
how
did
individuals
make
nations
act
as
they
wished
and
by
*NL*
what
was
the
will
of
these
individuals
themselves
guided
?
the
ancients
*NL*
met
by
recognizing
a
divinity
which
subjected
the
nations
to
the
will
of
*NL*
a
chosen
man
,
and
guided
the
will
of
that
chosen
man
so
as
to
accomplish
*NL*
ends
that
were
predestined
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
ancients
these
questions
were
solved
by
a
belief
in
the
direct
*NL*
participation
of
the
Deity
in
human
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Modern
history
,
in
theory
,
rejects
both
these
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
seem
that
having
rejected
the
belief
of
the
ancients
in
man
's
*NL*
subjection
to
the
Deity
and
in
a
predetermined
aim
toward
which
nations
*NL*
are
led
,
modern
history
should
study
not
the
manifestations
of
power
but
*NL*
the
causes
that
produce
it
.
But
modern
history
has
not
done
this
.
Having
*NL*
in
theory
rejected
the
view
held
by
the
ancients
,
it
still
follows
them
*NL*
in
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
men
endowed
with
divine
authority
and
directly
guided
by
the
*NL*
will
of
God
,
modern
history
has
given
us
either
heroes
endowed
with
*NL*
extraordinary
,
superhuman
capacities
,
or
simply
men
of
very
various
*NL*
kinds
,
from
monarchs
to
journalists
,
who
lead
the
masses
.
Instead
of
the
*NL*
former
divinely
appointed
aims
of
the
Jewish
,
Greek
,
or
Roman
nations
,
*NL*
which
ancient
historians
regarded
as
representing
the
progress
of
*NL*
humanity
,
modern
history
has
postulated
its
own
aims
--
the
welfare
of
the
*NL*
French
,
German
,
or
English
people
,
or
,
in
its
highest
abstraction
,
the
*NL*
welfare
and
civilization
of
humanity
in
general
,
by
which
is
usually
*NL*
meant
that
of
the
peoples
occupying
a
small
northwesterly
portion
of
a
*NL*
large
continent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Modern
history
has
rejected
the
beliefs
of
the
ancients
without
*NL*
replacing
them
by
a
new
conception
,
and
the
logic
of
the
situation
has
*NL*
obliged
the
historians
,
after
they
had
apparently
rejected
the
divine
*NL*
authority
of
the
kings
and
the
``
fate
''
of
the
ancients
,
to
reach
the
same
*NL*
conclusion
by
another
road
,
that
is
,
to
recognize
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
nations
guided
by
*NL*
individual
men
,
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
the
existence
of
a
known
aim
to
which
these
*NL*
nations
and
humanity
at
large
are
tending
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
basis
of
the
works
of
all
the
modern
historians
from
Gibbon
to
*NL*
Buckle
,
despite
their
seeming
disagreements
and
the
apparent
novelty
of
*NL*
their
outlooks
,
lie
those
two
old
,
unavoidable
assumptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
the
historian
describes
the
activity
of
individuals
*NL*
who
in
his
opinion
have
directed
humanity
-LRB-
one
historian
considers
only
*NL*
monarchs
,
generals
,
and
ministers
as
being
such
men
,
while
another
*NL*
includes
also
orators
,
learned
men
,
reformers
,
philosophers
,
and
poets
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Secondly
,
it
is
assumed
that
the
goal
toward
which
humanity
is
being
led
*NL*
is
known
to
the
historians
:
to
one
of
them
this
goal
is
the
greatness
of
*NL*
the
Roman
,
Spanish
,
or
French
realm
;
to
another
it
is
liberty
,
equality
,
*NL*
and
a
certain
kind
of
civilization
of
a
small
corner
of
the
world
called
*NL*
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1789
a
ferment
arises
in
Paris
;
it
grows
,
spreads
,
and
is
expressed
*NL*
by
a
movement
of
peoples
from
west
to
east
.
Several
times
it
moves
*NL*
eastward
and
collides
with
a
countermovement
from
the
east
westward
.
In
*NL*
1812
it
reaches
its
extreme
limit
,
Moscow
,
and
then
,
with
remarkable
*NL*
symmetry
,
a
countermovement
occurs
from
east
to
west
,
attracting
to
it
,
*NL*
as
the
first
movement
had
done
,
the
nations
of
middle
Europe
.
The
*NL*
counter
movement
reaches
the
starting
point
of
the
first
movement
in
the
*NL*
west
--
Paris
--
and
subsides
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
twenty-year
period
an
immense
number
of
fields
were
left
*NL*
untilled
,
houses
were
burned
,
trade
changed
its
direction
,
millions
of
*NL*
men
migrated
,
were
impoverished
,
or
were
enriched
,
and
millions
of
*NL*
Christian
men
professing
the
law
of
love
of
their
fellows
slew
one
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
all
this
mean
?
Why
did
it
happen
?
What
made
those
people
burn
*NL*
houses
and
slay
their
fellow
men
?
What
were
the
causes
of
these
events
?
*NL*
What
force
made
men
act
so
?
These
are
the
instinctive
,
plain
,
and
most
*NL*
legitimate
questions
humanity
asks
itself
when
it
encounters
the
*NL*
monuments
and
tradition
of
that
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
reply
to
these
questions
the
common
sense
of
mankind
turns
to
the
*NL*
science
of
history
,
whose
aim
is
to
enable
nations
and
humanity
to
know
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
history
had
retained
the
conception
of
the
ancients
it
would
have
*NL*
said
that
God
,
to
reward
or
punish
his
people
,
gave
Napoleon
power
and
*NL*
directed
his
will
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
divine
ends
,
and
that
reply
*NL*
would
have
been
clear
and
complete
.
One
might
believe
or
disbelieve
in
*NL*
the
divine
significance
of
Napoleon
,
but
for
anyone
believing
in
it
*NL*
there
would
have
been
nothing
unintelligible
in
the
history
of
that
*NL*
period
,
nor
would
there
have
been
any
contradictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
modern
history
can
not
give
that
reply
.
Science
does
not
admit
the
*NL*
conception
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
direct
participation
of
the
Deity
*NL*
in
human
affairs
,
and
therefore
history
ought
to
give
other
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Modern
history
replying
to
these
questions
says
:
you
want
to
know
what
*NL*
this
movement
means
,
what
caused
it
,
and
what
force
produced
these
*NL*
events
?
Then
listen
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louis
XIV
was
a
very
proud
and
self-confident
man
;
he
had
such
and
such
*NL*
mistresses
and
such
and
such
ministers
and
he
ruled
France
badly
.
His
*NL*
descendants
were
weak
men
and
they
too
ruled
France
badly
.
And
they
had
*NL*
such
and
such
favorites
and
such
and
such
mistresses
.
Moreover
,
certain
*NL*
men
wrote
some
books
at
that
time
.
At
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
*NL*
there
were
a
couple
of
dozen
men
in
Paris
who
began
to
talk
about
all
*NL*
men
being
free
and
equal
.
This
caused
people
all
over
France
to
begin
to
*NL*
slash
at
and
drown
one
another
.
They
killed
the
king
and
many
other
*NL*
people
.
At
that
time
there
was
in
France
a
man
of
genius
--
Napoleon
.
He
*NL*
conquered
everybody
everywhere
--
that
is
,
he
killed
many
people
because
*NL*
he
was
a
great
genius
.
And
for
some
reason
he
went
to
kill
Africans
,
and
*NL*
killed
them
so
well
and
was
so
cunning
and
wise
that
when
he
returned
to
*NL*
France
he
ordered
everybody
to
obey
him
,
and
they
all
obeyed
him
.
Having
*NL*
become
an
Emperor
he
again
went
out
to
kill
people
in
Italy
,
Austria
,
*NL*
and
Prussia
.
And
there
too
he
killed
a
great
many
.
In
Russia
there
was
*NL*
an
Emperor
,
Alexander
,
who
decided
to
restore
order
in
Europe
and
*NL*
therefore
fought
against
Napoleon
.
In
1807
he
suddenly
made
friends
with
*NL*
him
,
but
in
1811
they
again
quarreled
and
again
began
killing
many
*NL*
people
.
Napoleon
led
six
hundred
thousand
men
into
Russia
and
captured
*NL*
Moscow
;
then
he
suddenly
ran
away
from
Moscow
,
and
the
Emperor
*NL*
Alexander
,
helped
by
the
advice
of
Stein
and
others
,
united
Europe
to
*NL*
arm
against
the
disturber
of
its
peace
.
All
Napoleon
's
allies
suddenly
*NL*
became
his
enemies
and
their
forces
advanced
against
the
fresh
forces
he
*NL*
raised
.
The
Allies
defeated
Napoleon
,
entered
Paris
,
forced
Napoleon
to
*NL*
abdicate
,
and
sent
him
to
the
island
of
Elba
,
not
depriving
him
of
the
*NL*
title
of
Emperor
and
showing
him
every
respect
,
though
five
years
before
*NL*
and
one
year
later
they
all
regarded
him
as
an
outlaw
and
a
brigand
.
*NL*
Then
Louis
XVIII
,
who
till
then
had
been
the
laughingstock
both
of
the
*NL*
French
and
the
Allies
,
began
to
reign
.
And
Napoleon
,
shedding
tears
*NL*
before
his
Old
Guards
,
renounced
the
throne
and
went
into
exile
.
Then
*NL*
the
skillful
statesmen
and
diplomatists
-LRB-
especially
Talleyrand
,
who
*NL*
managed
to
sit
down
in
a
particular
chair
before
anyone
else
and
thereby
*NL*
extended
the
frontiers
of
France
-RRB-
talked
in
Vienna
and
by
these
*NL*
conversations
made
the
nations
happy
or
unhappy
.
Suddenly
the
*NL*
diplomatists
and
monarchs
nearly
quarreled
and
were
on
the
point
of
*NL*
again
ordering
their
armies
to
kill
one
another
,
but
just
then
Napoleon
*NL*
arrived
in
France
with
a
battalion
,
and
the
French
,
who
had
been
hating
*NL*
him
,
immediately
all
submitted
to
him
.
But
the
Allied
monarchs
were
*NL*
angry
at
this
and
went
to
fight
the
French
once
more
.
And
they
defeated
*NL*
the
genius
Napoleon
and
,
suddenly
recognizing
him
as
a
brigand
,
sent
him
*NL*
to
the
island
of
St.
Helena
.
And
the
exile
,
separated
from
the
beloved
*NL*
France
so
dear
to
his
heart
,
died
a
lingering
death
on
that
rock
and
*NL*
bequeathed
his
great
deeds
to
posterity
.
But
in
Europe
a
reaction
*NL*
occurred
and
the
sovereigns
once
again
all
began
to
oppress
their
*NL*
subjects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
this
is
ironic
--
a
caricature
of
the
*NL*
historical
accounts
.
On
the
contrary
it
is
a
very
mild
expression
of
the
*NL*
contradictory
replies
,
not
meeting
the
questions
,
which
all
the
*NL*
historians
give
,
from
the
compilers
of
memoirs
and
the
histories
of
*NL*
separate
states
to
the
writers
of
general
histories
and
the
new
*NL*
histories
of
the
culture
of
that
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strangeness
and
absurdity
of
these
replies
arise
from
the
fact
that
*NL*
modern
history
,
like
a
deaf
man
,
answers
questions
no
one
has
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
purpose
of
history
be
to
give
a
description
of
the
movement
of
*NL*
humanity
and
of
the
peoples
,
the
first
question
--
in
the
absence
of
a
*NL*
reply
to
which
all
the
rest
will
be
incomprehensible
--
is
:
what
is
the
*NL*
power
that
moves
peoples
?
To
this
,
modern
history
laboriously
replies
*NL*
either
that
Napoleon
was
a
great
genius
,
or
that
Louis
XIV
was
very
*NL*
proud
,
or
that
certain
writers
wrote
certain
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
may
be
so
and
mankind
is
ready
to
agree
with
it
,
but
it
is
not
*NL*
what
was
asked
.
All
that
would
be
interesting
if
we
recognized
a
divine
*NL*
power
based
on
itself
and
always
consistently
directing
its
nations
*NL*
through
Napoleons
,
Louis-es
,
and
writers
;
but
we
do
not
acknowledge
such
*NL*
a
power
,
and
therefore
before
speaking
about
Napoleons
,
Louis-es
,
and
*NL*
authors
,
we
ought
to
be
shown
the
connection
existing
between
these
men
*NL*
and
the
movement
of
the
nations
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
instead
of
a
divine
power
some
other
force
has
appeared
,
it
should
be
*NL*
explained
in
what
this
new
force
consists
,
for
the
whole
interest
of
*NL*
history
lies
precisely
in
that
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
History
seems
to
assume
that
this
force
is
self-evident
and
known
to
*NL*
everyone
.
But
in
spite
of
every
desire
to
regard
it
as
known
,
anyone
*NL*
reading
many
historical
works
can
not
help
doubting
whether
this
new
*NL*
force
,
so
variously
understood
by
the
historians
themselves
,
is
really
*NL*
quite
well
known
to
everybody
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
What
force
moves
the
nations
?
*NL*
*NL*
Biographical
historians
and
historians
of
separate
nations
understand
*NL*
this
force
as
a
power
inherent
in
heroes
and
rulers
.
In
their
narration
*NL*
events
occur
solely
by
the
will
of
a
Napoleon
,
and
Alexander
,
or
in
*NL*
general
of
the
persons
they
describe
.
The
answers
given
by
this
kind
of
*NL*
historian
to
the
question
of
what
force
causes
events
to
happen
are
*NL*
satisfactory
only
as
long
as
there
is
but
one
historian
to
each
event
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
historians
of
different
nationalities
and
tendencies
begin
to
*NL*
describe
the
same
event
,
the
replies
they
give
immediately
lose
all
*NL*
meaning
,
for
this
force
is
understood
by
them
all
not
only
differently
*NL*
but
often
in
quite
contradictory
ways
.
One
historian
says
that
an
event
*NL*
was
produced
by
Napoleon
's
power
,
another
that
it
was
produced
by
*NL*
Alexander
's
,
a
third
that
it
was
due
to
the
power
of
some
other
person
.
*NL*
Besides
this
,
historians
of
that
kind
contradict
each
other
even
in
*NL*
their
statement
as
to
the
force
on
which
the
authority
of
some
*NL*
particular
person
was
based
.
Thiers
,
a
Bonapartist
,
says
that
Napoleon
's
*NL*
power
was
based
on
his
virtue
and
genius
.
Lanfrey
,
a
Republican
,
says
it
*NL*
was
based
on
his
trickery
and
deception
of
the
people
.
So
the
historians
*NL*
of
this
class
,
by
mutually
destroying
one
another
's
positions
,
destroy
*NL*
the
understanding
of
the
force
which
produces
events
,
and
furnish
no
*NL*
reply
to
history
's
essential
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Writers
of
universal
history
who
deal
with
all
the
nations
seem
to
*NL*
recognize
how
erroneous
is
the
specialist
historians
'
view
of
the
force
*NL*
which
produces
events
.
They
do
not
recognize
it
as
a
power
inherent
in
*NL*
heroes
and
rulers
,
but
as
the
resultant
of
a
multiplicity
of
variously
*NL*
directed
forces
.
In
describing
a
war
or
the
subjugation
of
a
people
,
a
*NL*
general
historian
looks
for
the
cause
of
the
event
not
in
the
power
of
*NL*
one
man
,
but
in
the
interaction
of
many
persons
connected
with
the
*NL*
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
this
view
the
power
of
historical
personages
,
represented
*NL*
as
the
product
of
many
forces
,
can
no
longer
,
it
would
seem
,
be
regarded
*NL*
as
a
force
that
itself
produces
events
.
Yet
in
most
cases
universal
*NL*
historians
still
employ
the
conception
of
power
as
a
force
that
itself
*NL*
produces
events
,
and
treat
it
as
their
cause
.
In
their
exposition
,
an
*NL*
historic
character
is
first
the
product
of
his
time
,
and
his
power
only
*NL*
the
resultant
of
various
forces
,
and
then
his
power
is
itself
a
force
*NL*
producing
events
.
Gervinus
,
Schlosser
,
and
others
,
for
instance
,
at
one
*NL*
time
prove
Napoleon
to
be
a
product
of
the
Revolution
,
of
the
ideas
of
*NL*
1789
and
so
forth
,
and
at
another
plainly
say
that
the
campaign
of
1812
*NL*
and
other
things
they
do
not
like
were
simply
the
product
of
Napoleon
's
*NL*
misdirected
will
,
and
that
the
very
ideas
of
1789
were
arrested
in
their
*NL*
development
by
Napoleon
's
caprice
.
The
ideas
of
the
Revolution
and
the
*NL*
general
temper
of
the
age
produced
Napoleon
's
power
.
But
Napoleon
's
*NL*
power
suppressed
the
ideas
of
the
Revolution
and
the
general
temper
of
*NL*
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
curious
contradiction
is
not
accidental
.
Not
only
does
it
occur
at
*NL*
every
step
,
but
the
universal
historians
'
accounts
are
all
made
up
of
a
*NL*
chain
of
such
contradictions
.
This
contradiction
occurs
because
after
*NL*
entering
the
field
of
analysis
the
universal
historians
stop
halfway
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
find
component
forces
equal
to
the
composite
or
resultant
force
,
the
*NL*
sum
of
the
components
must
equal
the
resultant
.
This
condition
is
never
*NL*
observed
by
the
universal
historians
,
and
so
to
explain
the
resultant
*NL*
forces
they
are
obliged
to
admit
,
in
addition
to
the
insufficient
*NL*
components
,
another
unexplained
force
affecting
the
resultant
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Specialist
historians
describing
the
campaign
of
1813
or
the
restoration
*NL*
of
the
Bourbons
plainly
assert
that
these
events
were
produced
by
the
*NL*
will
of
Alexander
.
But
the
universal
historian
Gervinus
,
refuting
this
*NL*
opinion
of
the
specialist
historian
,
tries
to
prove
that
the
campaign
of
*NL*
1813
and
the
restoration
of
the
Bourbons
were
due
to
other
things
beside
*NL*
Alexander
's
will
--
such
as
the
activity
of
Stein
,
Metternich
,
Madame
de
*NL*
Stael
,
Talleyrand
,
Fichte
,
Chateaubriand
,
and
others
.
The
historian
*NL*
evidently
decomposes
Alexander
's
power
into
the
components
:
Talleyrand
,
*NL*
Chateaubriand
,
and
the
rest
--
but
the
sum
of
the
components
,
that
is
,
the
*NL*
interactions
of
Chateaubriand
,
Talleyrand
,
Madame
de
Stael
,
and
the
*NL*
others
,
evidently
does
not
equal
the
resultant
,
namely
the
phenomenon
of
*NL*
millions
of
Frenchmen
submitting
to
the
Bourbons
.
That
Chateaubriand
,
*NL*
Madame
de
Stael
,
and
others
spoke
certain
words
to
one
another
only
*NL*
affected
their
mutual
relations
but
does
not
account
for
the
submission
*NL*
of
millions
.
And
therefore
to
explain
how
from
these
relations
of
theirs
*NL*
the
submission
of
millions
of
people
resulted
--
that
is
,
how
component
*NL*
forces
equal
to
one
A
gave
a
resultant
equal
to
a
thousand
times
A
--
the
*NL*
historian
is
again
obliged
to
fall
back
on
power
--
the
force
he
had
*NL*
denied
--
and
to
recognize
it
as
the
resultant
of
the
forces
,
that
is
,
he
*NL*
has
to
admit
an
unexplained
force
acting
on
the
resultant
.
And
that
is
*NL*
just
what
the
universal
historians
do
,
and
consequently
they
not
only
*NL*
contradict
the
specialist
historians
but
contradict
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peasants
having
no
clear
idea
of
the
cause
of
rain
,
say
,
according
to
*NL*
whether
they
want
rain
or
fine
weather
:
``
The
wind
has
blown
the
clouds
*NL*
away
,
''
or
,
``
The
wind
has
brought
up
the
clouds
.
''
And
in
the
same
way
the
*NL*
universal
historians
sometimes
,
when
it
pleases
them
and
fits
in
with
*NL*
their
theory
,
say
that
power
is
the
result
of
events
,
and
sometimes
,
*NL*
when
they
want
to
prove
something
else
,
say
that
power
produces
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
class
of
historians
--
the
so-called
historians
of
culture
--
*NL*
following
the
path
laid
down
by
the
universal
historians
who
sometimes
*NL*
accept
writers
and
ladies
as
forces
producing
events
--
again
take
that
*NL*
force
to
be
something
quite
different
.
They
see
it
in
what
is
called
*NL*
culture
--
in
mental
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
of
culture
are
quite
consistent
in
regard
to
their
*NL*
progenitors
,
the
writers
of
universal
histories
,
for
if
historical
*NL*
events
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
certain
persons
treated
one
*NL*
another
in
such
and
such
ways
,
why
not
explain
them
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
such
and
such
people
wrote
such
and
such
books
?
Of
the
immense
number
of
*NL*
indications
accompanying
every
vital
phenomenon
,
these
historians
select
*NL*
the
indication
of
intellectual
activity
and
say
that
this
indication
is
*NL*
the
cause
.
But
despite
their
endeavors
to
prove
that
the
cause
of
events
*NL*
lies
in
intellectual
activity
,
only
by
a
great
stretch
can
one
admit
*NL*
that
there
is
any
connection
between
intellectual
activity
and
the
*NL*
movement
of
peoples
,
and
in
no
case
can
one
admit
that
intellectual
*NL*
activity
controls
people
's
actions
,
for
that
view
is
not
confirmed
by
*NL*
such
facts
as
the
very
cruel
murders
of
the
French
Revolution
resulting
*NL*
from
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
of
man
,
or
the
very
cruel
wars
and
*NL*
executions
resulting
from
the
preaching
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
admitting
as
correct
all
the
cunningly
devised
arguments
with
*NL*
which
these
histories
are
filled
--
admitting
that
nations
are
governed
by
*NL*
some
undefined
force
called
an
idea
--
history
's
essential
question
still
*NL*
remains
unanswered
,
and
to
the
former
power
of
monarchs
and
to
the
*NL*
influence
of
advisers
and
other
people
introduced
by
the
universal
*NL*
historians
,
another
,
newer
force
--
the
idea
--
is
added
,
the
connection
of
*NL*
which
with
the
masses
needs
explanation
.
It
is
possible
to
understand
*NL*
that
Napoleon
had
power
and
so
events
occurred
;
with
some
effort
one
may
*NL*
even
conceive
that
Napoleon
together
with
other
influences
was
the
cause
*NL*
of
an
event
;
but
how
a
book
,
Le
Contrat
Social
,
had
the
effect
of
making
*NL*
Frenchmen
begin
to
drown
one
another
can
not
be
understood
without
an
*NL*
explanation
of
the
causal
nexus
of
this
new
force
with
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undoubtedly
some
relation
exists
between
all
who
live
contemporaneously
,
*NL*
and
so
it
is
possible
to
find
some
connection
between
the
intellectual
*NL*
activity
of
men
and
their
historical
movements
,
just
as
such
a
*NL*
connection
may
be
found
between
the
movements
of
humanity
and
commerce
,
*NL*
handicraft
,
gardening
,
or
anything
else
you
please
.
But
why
intellectual
*NL*
activity
is
considered
by
the
historians
of
culture
to
be
the
cause
or
*NL*
expression
of
the
whole
historical
movement
is
hard
to
understand
.
Only
*NL*
the
following
considerations
can
have
led
the
historians
to
such
a
*NL*
conclusion
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
that
history
is
written
by
learned
men
,
and
so
it
is
*NL*
natural
and
agreeable
for
them
to
think
that
the
activity
of
their
class
*NL*
supplies
the
basis
of
the
movement
of
all
humanity
,
just
as
a
similar
*NL*
belief
is
natural
and
agreeable
to
traders
,
agriculturists
,
and
soldiers
*NL*
-LRB-
if
they
do
not
express
it
,
that
is
merely
because
traders
and
soldiers
*NL*
do
not
write
history
-RRB-
,
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
that
spiritual
activity
,
enlightenment
,
*NL*
civilization
,
culture
,
ideas
,
are
all
indistinct
,
indefinite
conceptions
*NL*
under
whose
banner
it
is
very
easy
to
use
words
having
a
still
less
*NL*
definite
meaning
,
and
which
can
therefore
be
readily
introduced
into
any
*NL*
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
to
speak
of
the
intrinsic
quality
of
histories
of
this
kind
*NL*
-LRB-
which
may
possibly
even
be
of
use
to
someone
for
something
-RRB-
the
*NL*
histories
of
culture
,
to
which
all
general
histories
tend
more
and
more
*NL*
to
approximate
,
are
significant
from
the
fact
that
after
seriously
and
*NL*
minutely
examining
various
religious
,
philosophic
,
and
political
*NL*
doctrines
as
causes
of
events
,
as
soon
as
they
have
to
describe
an
*NL*
actual
historic
event
such
as
the
campaign
of
1812
for
instance
,
they
*NL*
involuntarily
describe
it
as
resulting
from
an
exercise
of
power
--
and
*NL*
say
plainly
that
that
was
the
result
of
Napoleon
's
will
.
Speaking
so
,
*NL*
the
historians
of
culture
involuntarily
contradict
themselves
,
and
show
*NL*
that
the
new
force
they
have
devised
does
not
account
for
what
happens
*NL*
in
history
,
and
that
history
can
only
be
explained
by
introducing
a
*NL*
power
which
they
apparently
do
not
recognize
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
A
locomotive
is
moving
.
Someone
asks
:
``
What
moves
it
?
''
A
peasant
says
*NL*
the
devil
moves
it
.
Another
man
says
the
locomotive
moves
because
its
*NL*
wheels
go
round
.
A
third
asserts
that
the
cause
of
its
movement
lies
in
*NL*
the
smoke
which
the
wind
carries
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
is
irrefutable
.
He
has
devised
a
complete
explanation
.
To
*NL*
refute
him
someone
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
there
is
no
devil
,
or
*NL*
another
peasant
would
have
to
explain
to
him
that
it
is
not
the
devil
*NL*
but
a
German
,
who
moves
the
locomotive
.
Only
then
,
as
a
result
of
the
*NL*
contradiction
,
will
they
see
that
they
are
both
wrong
.
But
the
man
who
*NL*
says
that
the
movement
of
the
wheels
is
the
cause
refutes
himself
,
for
*NL*
having
once
begun
to
analyze
he
ought
to
go
on
and
explain
further
why
*NL*
the
wheels
go
round
;
and
till
he
has
reached
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
locomotive
in
the
pressure
of
steam
in
the
boiler
,
he
*NL*
has
no
right
to
stop
in
his
search
for
the
cause
.
The
man
who
explains
*NL*
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
by
the
smoke
that
is
carried
back
has
*NL*
noticed
that
the
wheels
do
not
supply
an
explanation
and
has
taken
the
*NL*
first
sign
that
occurs
to
him
and
in
his
turn
has
offered
that
as
an
*NL*
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
locomotive
is
*NL*
that
of
a
force
commensurate
with
the
movement
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
conception
that
can
explain
the
movement
of
the
peoples
is
that
*NL*
of
some
force
commensurate
with
the
whole
movement
of
the
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
to
supply
this
conception
various
historians
take
forces
of
*NL*
different
kinds
,
all
of
which
are
incommensurate
with
the
movement
*NL*
observed
.
Some
see
it
as
a
force
directly
inherent
in
heroes
,
as
the
*NL*
peasant
sees
the
devil
in
the
locomotive
;
others
as
a
force
resulting
*NL*
from
several
other
forces
,
like
the
movement
of
the
wheels
;
others
again
*NL*
as
an
intellectual
influence
,
like
the
smoke
that
is
blown
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
histories
are
written
of
separate
individuals
,
whether
*NL*
Caesars
,
Alexanders
,
Luthers
,
or
Voltaires
,
and
not
the
histories
of
*NL*
all
,
absolutely
all
those
who
take
part
in
an
event
,
it
is
quite
*NL*
impossible
to
describe
the
movement
of
humanity
without
the
conception
*NL*
of
a
force
compelling
men
to
direct
their
activity
toward
a
certain
end
.
*NL*
And
the
only
such
conception
known
to
historians
is
that
of
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conception
is
the
one
handle
by
means
of
which
the
material
of
*NL*
history
,
as
at
present
expounded
,
can
be
dealt
with
,
and
anyone
who
*NL*
breaks
that
handle
off
,
as
Buckle
did
,
without
finding
some
other
method
*NL*
of
treating
historical
material
,
merely
deprives
himself
of
the
one
*NL*
possible
way
of
dealing
with
it
.
The
necessity
of
the
conception
of
*NL*
power
as
an
explanation
of
historical
events
is
best
demonstrated
by
the
*NL*
universal
historians
and
historians
of
culture
themselves
,
for
they
*NL*
professedly
reject
that
conception
but
inevitably
have
recourse
to
it
at
*NL*
every
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
dealing
with
humanity
's
inquiry
,
the
science
of
history
up
to
now
is
*NL*
like
money
in
circulation
--
paper
money
and
coin
.
The
biographies
and
*NL*
special
national
histories
are
like
paper
money
.
They
can
be
used
and
*NL*
can
circulate
and
fulfill
their
purpose
without
harm
to
anyone
and
even
*NL*
advantageously
,
as
long
as
no
one
asks
what
is
the
security
behind
them
.
*NL*
You
need
only
forget
to
ask
how
the
will
of
heroes
produces
events
,
and
*NL*
such
histories
as
Thiers
'
will
be
interesting
and
instructive
and
may
*NL*
perhaps
even
possess
a
tinge
of
poetry
.
But
just
as
doubts
of
the
real
*NL*
value
of
paper
money
arise
either
because
,
being
easy
to
make
,
too
much
*NL*
of
it
gets
made
or
because
people
try
to
exchange
it
for
gold
,
so
also
*NL*
doubts
concerning
the
real
value
of
such
histories
arise
either
because
*NL*
too
many
of
them
are
written
or
because
in
his
simplicity
of
heart
*NL*
someone
inquires
:
by
what
force
did
Napoleon
do
this
?
--
that
is
,
wants
to
*NL*
exchange
the
current
paper
money
for
the
real
gold
of
actual
*NL*
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
writers
of
universal
histories
and
of
the
history
of
culture
are
*NL*
like
people
who
,
recognizing
the
defects
of
paper
money
,
decide
to
*NL*
substitute
for
it
money
made
of
metal
that
has
not
the
specific
gravity
*NL*
of
gold
.
It
may
indeed
make
jingling
coin
,
but
will
do
no
more
than
*NL*
that
.
Paper
money
may
deceive
the
ignorant
,
but
nobody
is
deceived
by
*NL*
tokens
of
base
metal
that
have
no
value
but
merely
jingle
.
As
gold
is
*NL*
gold
only
if
it
is
serviceable
not
merely
for
exchange
but
also
for
use
,
*NL*
so
universal
historians
will
be
valuable
only
when
they
can
reply
to
*NL*
history
's
essential
question
:
what
is
power
?
The
universal
historians
*NL*
give
contradictory
replies
to
that
question
,
while
the
historians
of
*NL*
culture
evade
it
and
answer
something
quite
different
.
And
as
counters
*NL*
of
imitation
gold
can
be
used
only
among
a
group
of
people
who
agree
to
*NL*
accept
them
as
gold
,
or
among
those
who
do
not
know
the
nature
of
gold
,
*NL*
so
universal
historians
and
historians
of
culture
,
not
answering
*NL*
humanity
's
essential
question
,
serve
as
currency
for
some
purposes
of
*NL*
their
own
,
only
in
universities
and
among
the
mass
of
readers
who
have
a
*NL*
taste
for
what
they
call
``
serious
reading
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Having
abandoned
the
conception
of
the
ancients
as
to
the
divine
*NL*
subjection
of
the
will
of
a
nation
to
some
chosen
man
and
the
subjection
*NL*
of
that
man
's
will
to
the
Deity
,
history
can
not
without
contradictions
*NL*
take
a
single
step
till
it
has
chosen
one
of
two
things
:
either
a
return
*NL*
to
the
former
belief
in
the
direct
intervention
of
the
Deity
in
human
*NL*
affairs
or
a
definite
explanation
of
the
meaning
of
the
force
producing
*NL*
historical
events
and
termed
``
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
return
to
the
first
is
impossible
,
the
belief
has
been
destroyed
;
and
*NL*
so
it
is
essential
to
explain
what
is
meant
by
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
ordered
an
army
to
be
raised
and
go
to
war
.
We
are
so
*NL*
accustomed
to
that
idea
and
have
become
so
used
to
it
that
the
question
:
*NL*
why
did
six
hundred
thousand
men
go
to
fight
when
Napoleon
uttered
*NL*
certain
words
,
seems
to
us
senseless
.
He
had
the
power
and
so
what
he
*NL*
ordered
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
reply
is
quite
satisfactory
if
we
believe
that
the
power
was
given
*NL*
him
by
God
.
But
as
soon
as
we
do
not
admit
that
,
it
becomes
essential
to
*NL*
determine
what
is
this
power
of
one
man
over
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
can
not
be
the
direct
physical
power
of
a
strong
man
over
a
weak
one
--
*NL*
a
domination
based
on
the
application
or
threat
of
physical
force
,
like
*NL*
the
power
of
Hercules
;
nor
can
it
be
based
on
the
effect
of
moral
force
,
*NL*
as
in
their
simplicity
some
historians
think
who
say
that
the
leading
*NL*
figures
in
history
are
heroes
,
that
is
,
men
gifted
with
a
special
*NL*
strength
of
soul
and
mind
called
genius
.
This
power
can
not
be
based
on
*NL*
the
predominance
of
moral
strength
,
for
,
not
to
mention
heroes
such
as
*NL*
Napoleon
about
whose
moral
qualities
opinions
differ
widely
,
history
*NL*
shows
us
that
neither
a
Louis
XI
nor
a
Metternich
,
who
ruled
over
*NL*
millions
of
people
,
had
any
particular
moral
qualities
,
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
were
generally
morally
weaker
than
any
of
the
millions
they
*NL*
ruled
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
source
of
power
lies
neither
in
the
physical
nor
in
the
moral
*NL*
qualities
of
him
who
possesses
it
,
it
must
evidently
be
looked
for
*NL*
elsewhere
--
in
the
relation
to
the
people
of
the
man
who
wields
the
*NL*
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
is
how
power
is
understood
by
the
science
of
jurisprudence
,
*NL*
that
exchange
bank
of
history
which
offers
to
exchange
history
's
*NL*
understanding
of
power
for
true
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Power
is
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
,
by
expressed
or
*NL*
tacit
consent
,
to
their
chosen
rulers
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
domain
of
jurisprudence
,
which
consists
of
discussions
of
how
a
*NL*
state
and
power
might
be
arranged
were
it
possible
for
all
that
to
be
*NL*
arranged
,
it
is
all
very
clear
;
but
when
applied
to
history
that
*NL*
definition
of
power
needs
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
science
of
jurisprudence
regards
the
state
and
power
as
the
ancients
*NL*
regarded
fire
--
namely
,
as
something
existing
absolutely
.
But
for
*NL*
history
,
the
state
and
power
are
merely
phenomena
,
just
as
for
modern
*NL*
physics
fire
is
not
an
element
but
a
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
fundamental
difference
between
the
view
held
by
history
and
*NL*
that
held
by
jurisprudence
,
it
follows
that
jurisprudence
can
tell
*NL*
minutely
how
in
its
opinion
power
should
be
constituted
and
what
power
--
*NL*
existing
immutably
outside
time
--
is
,
but
to
history
's
questions
about
*NL*
the
meaning
of
the
mutations
of
power
in
time
it
can
answer
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
power
be
the
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
to
their
*NL*
ruler
,
was
Pugachev
a
representative
of
the
will
of
the
people
?
If
not
,
*NL*
then
why
was
Napoleon
I
?
Why
was
Napoleon
III
a
criminal
when
he
was
*NL*
taken
prisoner
at
Boulogne
,
and
why
,
later
on
,
were
those
criminals
whom
*NL*
he
arrested
?
*NL*
*NL*
Do
palace
revolutions
--
in
which
sometimes
only
two
or
three
people
take
*NL*
part
--
transfer
the
will
of
the
people
to
a
new
ruler
?
In
international
*NL*
relations
,
is
the
will
of
the
people
also
transferred
to
their
*NL*
conqueror
?
Was
the
will
of
the
Confederation
of
the
Rhine
transferred
to
*NL*
Napoleon
in
1806
?
Was
the
will
of
the
Russian
people
transferred
to
*NL*
Napoleon
in
1809
,
when
our
army
in
alliance
with
the
French
went
to
*NL*
fight
the
Austrians
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
questions
three
answers
are
possible
:
*NL*
*NL*
Either
to
assume
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
always
*NL*
unconditionally
transferred
to
the
ruler
or
rulers
they
have
chosen
,
and
*NL*
that
therefore
every
emergence
of
a
new
power
,
every
struggle
against
*NL*
the
power
once
appointed
,
should
be
absolutely
regarded
as
an
*NL*
infringement
of
the
real
power
;
or
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
*NL*
transferred
to
the
rulers
conditionally
,
under
definite
and
known
*NL*
conditions
,
and
to
show
that
all
limitations
,
conflicts
,
and
even
*NL*
destructions
of
power
result
from
a
nonobservance
by
the
rulers
of
the
*NL*
conditions
under
which
their
power
was
entrusted
to
them
;
or
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
that
*NL*
the
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
the
rulers
conditionally
,
but
*NL*
that
the
conditions
are
unknown
and
indefinite
,
and
that
the
appearance
*NL*
of
several
authorities
,
their
struggles
and
their
falls
,
result
solely
*NL*
from
the
greater
or
lesser
fulfillment
by
the
rulers
of
these
unknown
*NL*
conditions
on
which
the
will
of
the
people
is
transferred
from
some
*NL*
people
to
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
these
are
the
three
ways
in
which
the
historians
do
explain
the
*NL*
relation
of
the
people
to
their
rulers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
historians
--
those
biographical
and
specialist
historians
already
*NL*
referred
to
--
in
their
simplicity
failing
to
understand
the
question
of
*NL*
the
meaning
of
power
,
seem
to
consider
that
the
collective
will
of
the
*NL*
people
is
unconditionally
transferred
to
historical
persons
,
and
*NL*
therefore
when
describing
some
single
state
they
assume
that
particular
*NL*
power
to
be
the
one
absolute
and
real
power
,
and
that
any
other
force
*NL*
opposing
this
is
not
a
power
but
a
violation
of
power
--
mere
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
theory
,
suitable
for
primitive
and
peaceful
periods
of
history
,
*NL*
has
the
inconvenience
--
in
application
to
complex
and
stormy
periods
in
*NL*
the
life
of
nations
during
which
various
powers
arise
simultaneously
and
*NL*
struggle
with
one
another
--
that
a
Legitimist
historian
will
prove
that
*NL*
the
National
Convention
,
the
Directory
,
and
Bonaparte
were
mere
*NL*
infringers
of
the
true
power
,
while
a
Republican
and
a
Bonapartist
will
*NL*
prove
:
the
one
that
the
Convention
and
the
other
that
the
Empire
was
the
*NL*
real
power
,
and
that
all
the
others
were
violations
of
power
.
Evidently
*NL*
the
explanations
furnished
by
these
historians
being
mutually
*NL*
contradictory
can
only
satisfy
young
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Recognizing
the
falsity
of
this
view
of
history
,
another
set
of
*NL*
historians
say
that
power
rests
on
a
conditional
delegation
of
the
will
*NL*
of
the
people
to
their
rulers
,
and
that
historical
leaders
have
power
*NL*
only
conditionally
on
carrying
out
the
program
that
the
will
of
the
*NL*
people
has
by
tacit
agreement
prescribed
to
them
.
But
what
this
program
*NL*
consists
in
these
historians
do
not
say
,
or
if
they
do
they
continually
*NL*
contradict
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
historian
,
according
to
his
view
of
what
constitutes
a
nation
's
*NL*
progress
,
looks
for
these
conditions
in
the
greatness
,
wealth
,
freedom
,
*NL*
or
enlightenment
of
citizens
of
France
or
some
other
country
.
But
not
to
*NL*
mention
the
historians
'
contradictions
as
to
the
nature
of
this
program
-
*NL*
-
or
even
admitting
that
some
one
general
program
of
these
conditions
*NL*
exists
--
the
facts
of
history
almost
always
contradict
that
theory
.
If
*NL*
the
conditions
under
which
power
is
entrusted
consist
in
the
wealth
,
*NL*
freedom
,
and
enlightenment
of
the
people
,
how
is
it
that
Louis
XIV
and
*NL*
Ivan
the
Terrible
end
their
reigns
tranquilly
,
while
Louis
XVI
and
*NL*
Charles
I
are
executed
by
their
people
?
To
this
question
historians
*NL*
reply
that
Louis
XIV
's
activity
,
contrary
to
the
program
,
reacted
on
*NL*
Louis
XVI
.
But
why
did
it
not
react
on
Louis
XIV
or
on
Louis
XV
--
why
*NL*
should
it
react
just
on
Louis
XVI
?
And
what
is
the
time
limit
for
such
*NL*
reactions
?
To
these
questions
there
are
and
can
be
no
answers
.
Equally
*NL*
little
does
this
view
explain
why
for
several
centuries
the
collective
*NL*
will
is
not
withdrawn
from
certain
rulers
and
their
heirs
,
and
then
*NL*
suddenly
during
a
period
of
fifty
years
is
transferred
to
the
*NL*
Convention
,
to
the
Directory
,
to
Napoleon
,
to
Alexander
,
to
Louis
XVIII
,
*NL*
to
Napoleon
again
,
to
Charles
X
,
to
Louis
Philippe
,
to
a
Republican
*NL*
government
,
and
to
Napoleon
III
.
When
explaining
these
rapid
transfers
*NL*
of
the
people
's
will
from
one
individual
to
another
,
especially
in
view
*NL*
of
international
relations
,
conquests
,
and
alliances
,
the
historians
are
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
that
some
of
these
transfers
are
not
normal
delegations
*NL*
of
the
people
's
will
but
are
accidents
dependent
on
cunning
,
on
*NL*
mistakes
,
on
craft
,
or
on
the
weakness
of
a
diplomatist
,
a
ruler
,
or
a
*NL*
party
leader
.
So
that
the
greater
part
of
the
events
of
history
--
civil
*NL*
wars
,
revolutions
,
and
conquests
--
are
presented
by
these
historians
not
*NL*
as
the
results
of
free
transferences
of
the
people
's
will
,
but
as
*NL*
results
of
the
ill-directed
will
of
one
or
more
individuals
,
that
is
,
*NL*
once
again
,
as
usurpations
of
power
.
And
so
these
historians
also
see
*NL*
and
admit
historical
events
which
are
exceptions
to
the
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
historians
resemble
a
botanist
who
,
having
noticed
that
some
*NL*
plants
grow
from
seeds
producing
two
cotyledons
,
should
insist
that
all
*NL*
that
grows
does
so
by
sprouting
into
two
leaves
,
and
that
the
palm
,
the
*NL*
mushroom
,
and
even
the
oak
,
which
blossom
into
full
growth
and
no
longer
*NL*
resemble
two
leaves
,
are
deviations
from
the
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Historians
of
the
third
class
assume
that
the
will
of
the
people
is
*NL*
transferred
to
historic
personages
conditionally
,
but
that
the
*NL*
conditions
are
unknown
to
us
.
They
say
that
historical
personages
have
*NL*
power
only
because
they
fulfill
the
will
of
the
people
which
has
been
*NL*
delegated
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
that
case
,
if
the
force
that
moves
nations
lies
not
in
the
*NL*
historic
leaders
but
in
the
nations
themselves
,
what
significance
have
*NL*
those
leaders
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
leaders
,
these
historians
tell
us
,
express
the
will
of
the
people
:
*NL*
the
activity
of
the
leaders
represents
the
activity
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
that
case
the
question
arises
whether
all
the
activity
of
the
*NL*
leaders
serves
as
an
expression
of
the
people
's
will
or
only
some
part
*NL*
of
it
.
If
the
whole
activity
of
the
leaders
serves
as
the
expression
of
*NL*
the
people
's
will
,
as
some
historians
suppose
,
then
all
the
details
of
*NL*
the
court
scandals
contained
in
the
biographies
of
a
Napoleon
or
a
*NL*
Catherine
serve
to
express
the
life
of
the
nation
,
which
is
evident
*NL*
nonsense
;
but
if
it
is
only
some
particular
side
of
the
activity
of
an
*NL*
historical
leader
which
serves
to
express
the
people
's
life
,
as
other
*NL*
so-called
``
philosophical
''
historians
believe
,
then
to
determine
which
*NL*
side
of
the
activity
of
a
leader
expresses
the
nation
's
life
,
we
have
*NL*
first
of
all
to
know
in
what
the
nation
's
life
consists
.
*NL*
*NL*
Met
by
this
difficulty
historians
of
that
class
devise
some
most
*NL*
obscure
,
impalpable
,
and
general
abstraction
which
can
cover
all
*NL*
conceivable
occurrences
,
and
declare
this
abstraction
to
be
the
aim
of
*NL*
humanity
's
movement
.
The
most
usual
generalizations
adopted
by
almost
*NL*
all
the
historians
are
:
freedom
,
equality
,
enlightenment
,
progress
,
*NL*
civilization
,
and
culture
.
Postulating
some
generalization
as
the
goal
*NL*
of
the
movement
of
humanity
,
the
historians
study
the
men
of
whom
the
*NL*
greatest
number
of
monuments
have
remained
:
kings
,
ministers
,
generals
,
*NL*
authors
,
reformers
,
popes
,
and
journalists
,
to
the
extent
to
which
in
*NL*
their
opinion
these
persons
have
promoted
or
hindered
that
abstraction
.
*NL*
But
as
it
is
in
no
way
proved
that
the
aim
of
humanity
does
consist
in
*NL*
freedom
,
equality
,
enlightenment
,
or
civilization
,
and
as
the
connection
*NL*
of
the
people
with
the
rulers
and
enlighteners
of
humanity
is
only
based
*NL*
on
the
arbitrary
assumption
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
*NL*
always
transferred
to
the
men
whom
we
have
noticed
,
it
happens
that
the
*NL*
activity
of
the
millions
who
migrate
,
burn
houses
,
abandon
agriculture
,
*NL*
and
destroy
one
another
never
is
expressed
in
the
account
of
the
*NL*
activity
of
some
dozen
people
who
did
not
burn
houses
,
practice
*NL*
agriculture
,
or
slay
their
fellow
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
History
proves
this
at
every
turn
.
Is
the
ferment
of
the
peoples
of
the
*NL*
west
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
their
drive
eastward
*NL*
explained
by
the
activity
of
Louis
XIV
,
XV
,
and
XVI
,
their
mistresses
*NL*
and
ministers
,
and
by
the
lives
of
Napoleon
,
Rousseau
,
Diderot
,
*NL*
Beaumarchais
,
and
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
Is
the
movement
of
the
Russian
people
eastward
to
Kazan
and
Siberia
*NL*
expressed
by
details
of
the
morbid
character
of
Ivan
the
Terrible
and
by
*NL*
his
correspondence
with
Kurbski
?
*NL*
*NL*
Is
the
movement
of
the
peoples
at
the
time
of
the
Crusades
explained
by
*NL*
the
life
and
activity
of
the
Godfreys
and
the
Louis-es
and
their
ladies
?
*NL*
For
us
that
movement
of
the
peoples
from
west
to
east
,
without
leaders
,
*NL*
with
a
crowd
of
vagrants
,
and
with
Peter
the
Hermit
,
remains
*NL*
incomprehensible
.
And
yet
more
incomprehensible
is
the
cessation
of
that
*NL*
movement
when
a
rational
and
sacred
aim
for
the
Crusade
--
the
deliverance
*NL*
of
Jerusalem
--
had
been
clearly
defined
by
historic
leaders
.
Popes
,
*NL*
kings
,
and
knights
incited
the
peoples
to
free
the
Holy
Land
;
but
the
*NL*
people
did
not
go
,
for
the
unknown
cause
which
had
previously
impelled
*NL*
them
to
go
no
longer
existed
.
The
history
of
the
Godfreys
and
the
*NL*
Minnesingers
can
evidently
not
cover
the
life
of
the
peoples
.
And
the
*NL*
history
of
the
Godfreys
and
the
Minnesingers
has
remained
the
history
of
*NL*
Godfreys
and
Minnesingers
,
but
the
history
of
the
life
of
the
peoples
*NL*
and
their
impulses
has
remained
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
less
does
the
history
of
authors
and
reformers
explain
to
us
the
*NL*
life
of
the
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
culture
explains
to
us
the
impulses
and
conditions
of
*NL*
life
and
thought
of
a
writer
or
a
reformer
.
We
learn
that
Luther
had
a
*NL*
hot
temper
and
said
such
and
such
things
;
we
learn
that
Rousseau
was
*NL*
suspicious
and
wrote
such
and
such
books
;
but
we
do
not
learn
why
after
*NL*
the
Reformation
the
peoples
massacred
one
another
,
nor
why
during
the
*NL*
French
Revolution
they
guillotined
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
unite
both
these
kinds
of
history
,
as
is
done
by
the
newest
*NL*
historians
,
we
shall
have
the
history
of
monarchs
and
writers
,
but
not
*NL*
the
history
of
the
life
of
the
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
of
the
nations
is
not
contained
in
the
lives
of
a
few
men
,
for
*NL*
the
connection
between
those
men
and
the
nations
has
not
been
found
.
The
*NL*
theory
that
this
connection
is
based
on
the
transference
of
the
*NL*
collective
will
of
a
people
to
certain
historical
personages
is
an
*NL*
hypothesis
unconfirmed
by
the
experience
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
collective
will
of
the
people
to
*NL*
historic
persons
may
perhaps
explain
much
in
the
domain
of
jurisprudence
*NL*
and
be
essential
for
its
purposes
,
but
in
its
application
to
history
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
revolutions
,
conquests
,
or
civil
wars
occur
--
that
is
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
history
begins
--
that
theory
explains
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theory
seems
irrefutable
just
because
the
act
of
transference
of
the
*NL*
people
's
will
can
not
be
verified
,
for
it
never
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
happens
and
whoever
may
stand
at
the
head
of
affairs
,
the
*NL*
theory
can
always
say
that
such
and
such
a
person
took
the
lead
because
*NL*
the
collective
will
was
transferred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
replies
this
theory
gives
to
historical
questions
are
like
the
*NL*
replies
of
a
man
who
,
watching
the
movements
of
a
herd
of
cattle
and
*NL*
paying
no
attention
to
the
varying
quality
of
the
pasturage
in
different
*NL*
parts
of
the
field
,
or
to
the
driving
of
the
herdsman
,
should
attribute
*NL*
the
direction
the
herd
takes
to
what
animal
happens
to
be
at
its
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
herd
goes
in
that
direction
because
the
animal
in
front
leads
it
*NL*
and
the
collective
will
of
all
the
other
animals
is
vested
in
that
*NL*
leader
.
''
This
is
what
historians
of
the
first
class
say
--
those
who
*NL*
assume
the
unconditional
transference
of
the
people
's
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
animals
leading
the
herd
change
,
this
happens
because
the
*NL*
collective
will
of
all
the
animals
is
transferred
from
one
leader
to
*NL*
another
,
according
to
whether
the
animal
is
or
is
not
leading
them
in
*NL*
the
direction
selected
by
the
whole
herd
.
''
Such
is
the
reply
historians
*NL*
who
assume
that
the
collective
will
of
the
people
is
delegated
to
rulers
*NL*
under
conditions
which
they
regard
as
known
.
-LRB-
With
this
method
of
*NL*
observation
it
often
happens
that
the
observer
,
influenced
by
the
*NL*
direction
he
himself
prefers
,
regards
those
as
leaders
who
,
owing
to
the
*NL*
people
's
change
of
direction
,
are
no
longer
in
front
,
but
on
one
side
,
*NL*
or
even
in
the
rear
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
animals
in
front
are
continually
changing
and
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
whole
herd
is
constantly
altered
,
this
is
because
in
order
to
follow
*NL*
a
given
direction
the
animals
transfer
their
will
to
the
animals
that
*NL*
have
attracted
our
attention
,
and
to
study
the
movements
of
the
herd
we
*NL*
must
watch
the
movements
of
all
the
prominent
animals
moving
on
all
*NL*
sides
of
the
herd
.
''
So
say
the
third
class
of
historians
who
regard
all
*NL*
historical
persons
,
from
monarchs
to
journalists
,
as
the
expression
of
*NL*
their
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theory
of
the
transference
of
the
will
of
the
people
to
historic
*NL*
persons
is
merely
a
paraphrase
--
a
restatement
of
the
question
in
other
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
causes
historical
events
?
Power
.
What
is
power
?
Power
is
the
*NL*
collective
will
of
the
people
transferred
to
one
person
.
Under
what
*NL*
condition
is
the
will
of
the
people
delegated
to
one
person
?
On
*NL*
condition
that
that
person
expresses
the
will
of
the
whole
people
.
That
*NL*
is
,
power
is
power
:
in
other
words
,
power
is
a
word
the
meaning
of
which
*NL*
we
do
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
realm
of
human
knowledge
were
confined
to
abstract
reasoning
,
*NL*
then
having
subjected
to
criticism
the
explanation
of
``
power
''
that
*NL*
juridical
science
gives
us
,
humanity
would
conclude
that
power
is
merely
*NL*
a
word
and
has
no
real
existence
.
But
to
understand
phenomena
man
has
,
*NL*
besides
abstract
reasoning
,
experience
by
which
he
verifies
his
*NL*
reflections
.
And
experience
tells
us
that
power
is
not
merely
a
word
but
*NL*
an
actually
existing
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
no
description
of
the
collective
activity
*NL*
of
men
can
do
without
the
conception
of
power
,
the
existence
of
power
is
*NL*
proved
both
by
history
and
by
observing
contemporary
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
an
event
occurs
a
man
appears
or
men
appear
,
by
whose
will
the
*NL*
event
seems
to
have
taken
place
.
Napoleon
III
issues
a
decree
and
the
*NL*
French
go
to
Mexico
.
The
King
of
Prussia
and
Bismarck
issue
decrees
and
*NL*
an
army
enters
Bohemia
.
Napoleon
I
issues
a
decree
and
an
army
enters
*NL*
Russia
.
Alexander
I
gives
a
command
and
the
French
submit
to
the
*NL*
Bourbons
.
Experience
shows
us
that
whatever
event
occurs
it
is
always
*NL*
related
to
the
will
of
one
or
of
several
men
who
have
decreed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
historians
,
in
accord
with
the
old
habit
of
acknowledging
divine
*NL*
intervention
in
human
affairs
,
want
to
see
the
cause
of
events
in
the
*NL*
expression
of
the
will
of
someone
endowed
with
power
,
but
that
*NL*
supposition
is
not
confirmed
either
by
reason
or
by
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
one
side
reflection
shows
that
the
expression
of
a
man
's
will
--
*NL*
his
words
--
are
only
part
of
the
general
activity
expressed
in
an
event
,
*NL*
as
for
instance
in
a
war
or
a
revolution
,
and
so
without
assuming
an
*NL*
incomprehensible
,
supernatural
force
--
a
miracle
--
one
can
not
admit
that
*NL*
words
can
be
the
immediate
cause
of
the
movements
of
millions
of
men
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
even
if
we
admitted
that
words
could
be
the
cause
of
*NL*
events
,
history
shows
that
the
expression
of
the
will
of
historical
*NL*
personages
does
not
in
most
cases
produce
any
effect
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
their
commands
are
often
not
executed
,
and
sometimes
the
very
opposite
*NL*
of
what
they
order
occurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
admitting
divine
intervention
in
the
affairs
of
humanity
we
*NL*
can
not
regard
``
power
''
as
the
cause
of
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
Power
,
from
the
standpoint
of
experience
,
is
merely
the
relation
that
*NL*
exists
between
the
expression
of
someone
's
will
and
the
execution
of
*NL*
that
will
by
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
explain
the
conditions
of
that
relationship
we
must
first
establish
a
*NL*
conception
of
the
expression
of
will
,
referring
it
to
man
and
not
to
the
*NL*
Deity
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
Deity
issues
a
command
,
expresses
His
will
,
as
ancient
history
*NL*
tells
us
,
the
expression
of
that
will
is
independent
of
time
and
is
not
*NL*
caused
by
anything
,
for
the
Divinity
is
not
controlled
by
an
event
.
But
*NL*
speaking
of
commands
that
are
the
expression
of
the
will
of
men
acting
*NL*
in
time
and
in
relation
to
one
another
,
to
explain
the
connection
of
*NL*
commands
with
events
we
must
restore
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
the
condition
of
all
that
*NL*
takes
place
:
the
continuity
of
movement
in
time
both
of
the
events
and
*NL*
of
the
person
who
commands
,
and
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
the
inevitability
of
the
connection
*NL*
between
the
person
commanding
and
those
who
execute
his
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
expression
of
the
will
of
the
Deity
,
not
dependent
on
time
,
can
*NL*
relate
to
a
whole
series
of
events
occurring
over
a
period
of
years
or
*NL*
centuries
,
and
only
the
Deity
,
independent
of
everything
,
can
by
His
*NL*
sole
will
determine
the
direction
of
humanity
's
movement
;
but
man
acts
*NL*
in
time
and
himself
takes
part
in
what
occurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reinstating
the
first
condition
omitted
,
that
of
time
,
we
see
that
no
*NL*
command
can
be
executed
without
some
preceding
order
having
been
given
*NL*
rendering
the
execution
of
the
last
command
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
command
ever
appears
spontaneously
,
or
itself
covers
a
whole
series
*NL*
of
occurrences
;
but
each
command
follows
from
another
,
and
never
refers
*NL*
to
a
whole
series
of
events
but
always
to
one
moment
only
of
an
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
for
instance
,
we
say
that
Napoleon
ordered
armies
to
go
to
war
,
we
*NL*
combine
in
one
simultaneous
expression
a
whole
series
of
consecutive
*NL*
commands
dependent
one
on
another
.
Napoleon
could
not
have
commanded
an
*NL*
invasion
of
Russia
and
never
did
so
.
Today
he
ordered
such
and
such
*NL*
papers
to
be
written
to
Vienna
,
to
Berlin
,
and
to
Petersburg
;
tomorrow
*NL*
such
and
such
decrees
and
orders
to
the
army
,
the
fleet
,
the
*NL*
commissariat
,
and
so
on
and
so
on
--
millions
of
commands
,
which
formed
a
*NL*
whole
series
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
which
brought
the
*NL*
French
armies
into
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
throughout
his
reign
Napoleon
gave
commands
concerning
an
invasion
of
*NL*
England
and
expended
on
no
other
undertaking
so
much
time
and
effort
,
*NL*
and
yet
during
his
whole
reign
never
once
attempted
to
execute
that
*NL*
design
but
undertook
an
expedition
into
Russia
,
with
which
country
he
*NL*
considered
it
desirable
to
be
in
alliance
-LRB-
a
conviction
he
repeatedly
*NL*
expressed
-RRB-
--
this
came
about
because
his
commands
did
not
correspond
to
*NL*
the
course
of
events
in
the
first
case
,
but
did
so
correspond
in
the
*NL*
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
order
to
be
certainly
executed
,
it
is
necessary
that
a
man
should
*NL*
order
what
can
be
executed
.
But
to
know
what
can
and
what
can
not
be
*NL*
executed
is
impossible
,
not
only
in
the
case
of
Napoleon
's
invasion
of
*NL*
Russia
in
which
millions
participated
,
but
even
in
the
simplest
event
,
*NL*
for
in
either
case
millions
of
obstacles
may
arise
to
prevent
its
*NL*
execution
.
Every
order
executed
is
always
one
of
an
immense
number
*NL*
unexecuted
.
All
the
impossible
orders
inconsistent
with
the
course
of
*NL*
events
remain
unexecuted
.
Only
the
possible
ones
get
linked
up
with
a
*NL*
consecutive
series
of
commands
corresponding
to
a
series
of
events
,
and
*NL*
are
executed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
false
conception
that
an
event
is
caused
by
a
command
which
precedes
*NL*
it
is
due
to
the
fact
that
when
the
event
has
taken
place
and
out
of
*NL*
thousands
of
others
those
few
commands
which
were
consistent
with
that
*NL*
event
have
been
executed
,
we
forget
about
the
others
that
were
not
*NL*
executed
because
they
could
not
be
.
Apart
from
that
,
the
chief
source
of
*NL*
our
error
in
this
matter
is
due
to
the
fact
that
in
the
historical
*NL*
accounts
a
whole
series
of
innumerable
,
diverse
,
and
petty
events
,
such
*NL*
for
instance
as
all
those
which
led
the
French
armies
to
Russia
,
is
*NL*
generalized
into
one
event
in
accord
with
the
result
produced
by
that
*NL*
series
of
events
,
and
corresponding
with
this
generalization
the
whole
*NL*
series
of
commands
is
also
generalized
into
a
single
expression
of
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
say
that
Napoleon
wished
to
invade
Russia
and
invaded
it
.
In
reality
*NL*
in
all
Napoleon
's
activity
we
never
find
anything
resembling
an
*NL*
expression
of
that
wish
,
but
find
a
series
of
orders
,
or
expressions
of
*NL*
his
will
,
very
variously
and
indefinitely
directed
.
Amid
a
long
series
*NL*
of
unexecuted
orders
of
Napoleon
's
one
series
,
for
the
campaign
of
1812
,
*NL*
was
carried
out
--
not
because
those
orders
differed
in
any
way
from
the
*NL*
other
,
unexecuted
orders
but
because
they
coincided
with
the
course
of
*NL*
events
that
led
the
French
army
into
Russia
;
just
as
in
stencil
work
*NL*
this
or
that
figure
comes
out
not
because
the
color
was
laid
on
from
*NL*
this
side
or
in
that
way
,
but
because
it
was
laid
on
from
all
sides
over
*NL*
the
figure
cut
in
the
stencil
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
examining
the
relation
in
time
of
the
commands
to
the
events
,
we
*NL*
find
that
a
command
can
never
be
the
cause
of
the
event
,
but
that
a
*NL*
certain
definite
dependence
exists
between
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
understand
in
what
this
dependence
consists
it
is
necessary
to
*NL*
reinstate
another
omitted
condition
of
every
command
proceeding
not
from
*NL*
the
Deity
but
from
a
man
,
which
is
,
that
the
man
who
gives
the
command
*NL*
himself
takes
part
in
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
relation
of
the
commander
to
those
he
commands
is
just
what
is
*NL*
called
power
.
This
relation
consists
in
the
following
:
*NL*
*NL*
For
common
action
people
always
unite
in
certain
combinations
,
in
which
*NL*
regardless
of
the
difference
of
the
aims
set
for
the
common
action
,
the
*NL*
relation
between
those
taking
part
in
it
is
always
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
uniting
in
these
combinations
always
assume
such
relations
toward
*NL*
one
another
that
the
larger
number
take
a
more
direct
share
,
and
the
*NL*
smaller
number
a
less
direct
share
,
in
the
collective
action
for
which
*NL*
they
have
combined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
combinations
in
which
men
unite
for
collective
action
one
of
*NL*
the
most
striking
and
definite
examples
is
an
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
army
is
composed
of
lower
grades
of
the
service
--
the
rank
and
*NL*
file
--
of
whom
there
are
always
the
greatest
number
;
of
the
next
higher
*NL*
military
rank
--
corporals
and
noncommissioned
officers
of
whom
there
are
*NL*
fewer
,
and
of
still-higher
officers
of
whom
there
are
still
fewer
,
and
*NL*
so
on
to
the
highest
military
command
which
is
concentrated
in
one
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
military
organization
may
be
quite
correctly
compared
to
a
cone
,
of
*NL*
which
the
base
with
the
largest
diameter
consists
of
the
rank
and
file
;
*NL*
the
next
higher
and
smaller
section
of
the
cone
consists
of
the
next
*NL*
higher
grades
of
the
army
,
and
so
on
to
the
apex
,
the
point
of
which
*NL*
will
represent
the
commander-in-chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
,
of
whom
there
are
the
most
,
form
the
lower
section
of
the
*NL*
cone
and
its
base
.
The
soldier
himself
does
the
stabbing
,
hacking
,
*NL*
burning
,
and
pillaging
,
and
always
receives
orders
for
these
actions
*NL*
from
men
above
him
;
he
himself
never
gives
an
order
.
The
noncommissioned
*NL*
officers
-LRB-
of
whom
there
are
fewer
-RRB-
perform
the
action
itself
less
*NL*
frequently
than
the
soldiers
,
but
they
already
give
commands
.
An
officer
*NL*
still
less
often
acts
directly
himself
,
but
commands
still
more
*NL*
frequently
.
A
general
does
nothing
but
command
the
troops
,
indicates
the
*NL*
objective
,
and
hardly
ever
uses
a
weapon
himself
.
The
commander-in-chief
*NL*
never
takes
direct
part
in
the
action
itself
,
but
only
gives
general
*NL*
orders
concerning
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
the
troops
.
A
similar
*NL*
relation
of
people
to
one
another
is
seen
in
every
combination
of
men
*NL*
for
common
activity
--
in
agriculture
,
trade
,
and
every
administration
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
without
particularly
analyzing
all
the
contiguous
sections
of
a
*NL*
cone
and
of
the
ranks
of
an
army
,
or
the
ranks
and
positions
in
any
*NL*
administrative
or
public
business
whatever
from
the
lowest
to
the
*NL*
highest
,
we
see
a
law
by
which
men
,
to
take
associated
action
,
combine
*NL*
in
such
relations
that
the
more
directly
they
participate
in
performing
*NL*
the
action
the
less
they
can
command
and
the
more
numerous
they
are
,
*NL*
while
the
less
their
direct
participation
in
the
action
itself
,
the
more
*NL*
they
command
and
the
fewer
of
them
there
are
;
rising
in
this
way
from
*NL*
the
lowest
ranks
to
the
man
at
the
top
,
who
takes
the
least
direct
share
*NL*
in
the
action
and
directs
his
activity
chiefly
to
commanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
relation
of
the
men
who
command
to
those
they
command
is
what
*NL*
constitutes
the
essence
of
the
conception
called
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
restored
the
condition
of
time
under
which
all
events
occur
,
we
*NL*
find
that
a
command
is
executed
only
when
it
is
related
to
a
*NL*
corresponding
series
of
events
.
Restoring
the
essential
condition
of
*NL*
relation
between
those
who
command
and
those
who
execute
,
we
find
that
*NL*
by
the
very
nature
of
the
case
those
who
command
take
the
smallest
part
*NL*
in
the
action
itself
and
that
their
activity
is
exclusively
directed
to
*NL*
commanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
When
an
event
is
taking
place
people
express
their
opinions
and
wishes
*NL*
about
it
,
and
as
the
event
results
from
the
collective
activity
of
many
*NL*
people
,
some
one
of
the
opinions
or
wishes
expressed
is
sure
to
be
*NL*
fulfilled
if
but
approximately
.
When
one
of
the
opinions
expressed
is
*NL*
fulfilled
,
that
opinion
gets
connected
with
the
event
as
a
command
*NL*
preceding
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
are
hauling
a
log
.
Each
of
them
expresses
his
opinion
as
to
how
and
*NL*
where
to
haul
it
.
They
haul
the
log
away
,
and
it
happens
that
this
is
*NL*
done
as
one
of
them
said
.
He
ordered
it
.
There
we
have
command
and
power
*NL*
in
their
primary
form
.
The
man
who
worked
most
with
his
hands
could
not
*NL*
think
so
much
about
what
he
was
doing
,
or
reflect
on
or
command
what
*NL*
would
result
from
the
common
activity
;
while
the
man
who
commanded
more
*NL*
would
evidently
work
less
with
his
hands
on
account
of
his
greater
*NL*
verbal
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
some
larger
concourse
of
men
direct
their
activity
to
a
common
aim
*NL*
there
is
a
yet
sharper
division
of
those
who
,
because
their
activity
is
*NL*
given
to
directing
and
commanding
,
take
less
part
in
the
direct
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
works
alone
he
always
has
a
certain
set
of
reflections
which
*NL*
as
it
seems
to
him
directed
his
past
activity
,
justify
his
present
*NL*
activity
,
and
guide
him
in
planning
his
future
actions
.
Just
the
same
is
*NL*
done
by
a
concourse
of
people
,
allowing
those
who
do
not
take
a
direct
*NL*
part
in
the
activity
to
devise
considerations
,
justifications
,
and
*NL*
surmises
concerning
their
collective
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
reasons
known
or
unknown
to
us
the
French
began
to
drown
and
kill
*NL*
one
another
.
And
corresponding
to
the
event
its
justification
appears
in
*NL*
people
's
belief
that
this
was
necessary
for
the
welfare
of
France
,
for
*NL*
liberty
,
and
for
equality
.
People
ceased
to
kill
one
another
,
and
this
*NL*
event
was
accompanied
by
its
justification
in
the
necessity
for
a
*NL*
centralization
of
power
,
resistance
to
Europe
,
and
so
on
.
Men
went
from
*NL*
the
west
to
the
east
killing
their
fellow
men
,
and
the
event
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
phrases
about
the
glory
of
France
,
the
baseness
of
*NL*
England
,
and
so
on
.
History
shows
us
that
these
justifications
of
the
*NL*
events
have
no
common
sense
and
are
all
contradictory
,
as
in
the
case
of
*NL*
killing
a
man
as
the
result
of
recognizing
his
rights
,
and
the
killing
*NL*
of
millions
in
Russia
for
the
humiliation
of
England
.
But
these
*NL*
justifications
have
a
very
necessary
significance
in
their
own
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
justifications
release
those
who
produce
the
events
from
moral
*NL*
responsibility
.
These
temporary
aims
are
like
the
broom
fixed
in
front
*NL*
of
a
locomotive
to
clear
the
snow
from
the
rails
in
front
:
they
clear
*NL*
men
's
moral
responsibilities
from
their
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
such
justification
there
would
be
no
reply
to
the
simplest
*NL*
question
that
presents
itself
when
examining
each
historical
event
.
How
*NL*
is
it
that
millions
of
men
commit
collective
crimes
--
make
war
,
commit
*NL*
murder
,
and
so
on
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
present
complex
forms
of
political
and
social
life
in
Europe
*NL*
can
any
event
that
is
not
prescribed
,
decreed
,
or
ordered
by
monarchs
,
*NL*
ministers
,
parliaments
,
or
newspapers
be
imagined
?
Is
there
any
*NL*
collective
action
which
can
not
find
its
justification
in
political
*NL*
unity
,
in
patriotism
,
in
the
balance
of
power
,
or
in
civilization
?
So
*NL*
that
every
event
that
occurs
inevitably
coincides
with
some
expressed
*NL*
wish
and
,
receiving
a
justification
,
presents
itself
as
the
result
of
*NL*
the
will
of
one
man
or
of
several
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
whatever
direction
a
ship
moves
,
the
flow
of
the
waves
it
cuts
will
*NL*
always
be
noticeable
ahead
of
it
.
To
those
on
board
the
ship
the
*NL*
movement
of
those
waves
will
be
the
only
perceptible
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
watching
closely
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
that
flow
and
*NL*
comparing
it
with
the
movement
of
the
ship
do
we
convince
ourselves
that
*NL*
every
bit
of
it
is
occasioned
by
the
forward
movement
of
the
ship
,
and
*NL*
that
we
were
led
into
error
by
the
fact
that
we
ourselves
were
*NL*
imperceptibly
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
see
the
same
if
we
watch
moment
by
moment
the
movement
of
historical
*NL*
characters
-LRB-
that
is
,
re-establish
the
inevitable
condition
of
all
that
*NL*
occurs
--
the
continuity
of
movement
in
time
-RRB-
and
do
not
lose
sight
of
the
*NL*
essential
connection
of
historical
persons
with
the
masses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ship
moves
in
one
direction
there
is
one
and
the
same
wave
*NL*
ahead
of
it
,
when
it
turns
frequently
the
wave
ahead
of
it
also
turns
*NL*
frequently
.
But
wherever
it
may
turn
there
always
will
be
the
wave
*NL*
anticipating
its
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
happens
it
always
appears
that
just
that
event
was
foreseen
and
*NL*
decreed
.
Wherever
the
ship
may
go
,
the
rush
of
water
which
neither
*NL*
directs
nor
increases
its
movement
foams
ahead
of
it
,
and
at
a
distance
*NL*
seems
to
us
not
merely
to
move
of
itself
but
to
govern
the
ship
's
*NL*
movement
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Examining
only
those
expressions
of
the
will
of
historical
persons
*NL*
which
,
as
commands
,
were
related
to
events
,
historians
have
assumed
that
*NL*
the
events
depended
on
those
commands
.
But
examining
the
events
*NL*
themselves
and
the
connection
in
which
the
historical
persons
stood
to
*NL*
the
people
,
we
have
found
that
they
and
their
orders
were
dependent
on
*NL*
events
.
The
incontestable
proof
of
this
deduction
is
that
,
however
many
*NL*
commands
were
issued
,
the
event
does
not
take
place
unless
there
are
*NL*
other
causes
for
it
,
but
as
soon
as
an
event
occurs
--
be
it
what
it
may
--
*NL*
then
out
of
all
the
continually
expressed
wishes
of
different
people
*NL*
some
will
always
be
found
which
by
their
meaning
and
their
time
of
*NL*
utterance
are
related
as
commands
to
the
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arriving
at
this
conclusion
we
can
reply
directly
and
positively
to
*NL*
these
two
essential
questions
of
history
:
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
What
is
power
?
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
What
force
produces
the
movement
of
the
nations
?
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
Power
is
the
relation
of
a
given
person
to
other
individuals
,
in
*NL*
which
the
more
this
person
expresses
opinions
,
predictions
,
and
*NL*
justifications
of
the
collective
action
that
is
performed
,
the
less
is
*NL*
his
participation
in
that
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-

-RRB-
The
movement
of
nations
is
caused
not
by
power
,
nor
by
intellectual
*NL*
activity
,
nor
even
by
a
combination
of
the
two
as
historians
have
*NL*
supposed
,
but
by
the
activity
of
all
the
people
who
participate
in
the
*NL*
events
,
and
who
always
combine
in
such
a
way
that
those
taking
the
*NL*
largest
direct
share
in
the
event
take
on
themselves
the
least
*NL*
responsibility
and
vice
versa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morally
the
wielder
of
power
appears
to
cause
the
event
;
physically
it
*NL*
is
those
who
submit
to
the
power
.
But
as
the
moral
activity
is
*NL*
inconceivable
without
the
physical
,
the
cause
of
the
event
is
neither
in
*NL*
the
one
nor
in
the
other
but
in
the
union
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
in
other
words
,
the
conception
of
a
cause
is
inapplicable
to
the
*NL*
phenomena
we
are
examining
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
last
analysis
we
reach
the
circle
of
infinity
--
that
final
limit
*NL*
to
which
in
every
domain
of
thought
man
's
reason
arrives
if
it
is
not
*NL*
playing
with
the
subject
.
Electricity
produces
heat
,
heat
produces
*NL*
electricity
.
Atoms
attract
each
other
and
atoms
repel
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speaking
of
the
interaction
of
heat
and
electricity
and
of
atoms
,
we
*NL*
can
not
say
why
this
occurs
,
and
we
say
that
it
is
so
because
it
is
*NL*
inconceivable
otherwise
,
because
it
must
be
so
and
that
it
is
a
law
.
The
*NL*
same
applies
to
historical
events
.
Why
war
and
revolution
occur
we
do
*NL*
not
know
.
We
only
know
that
to
produce
the
one
or
the
other
action
,
*NL*
people
combine
in
a
certain
formation
in
which
they
all
take
part
,
and
*NL*
we
say
that
this
is
so
because
it
is
unthinkable
otherwise
,
or
in
other
*NL*
words
that
it
is
a
law
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
If
history
dealt
only
with
external
phenomena
,
the
establishment
of
this
*NL*
simple
and
obvious
law
would
suffice
and
we
should
have
finished
our
*NL*
argument
.
But
the
law
of
history
relates
to
man
.
A
particle
of
matter
*NL*
can
not
tell
us
that
it
does
not
feel
the
law
of
attraction
or
repulsion
*NL*
and
that
that
law
is
untrue
,
but
man
,
who
is
the
subject
of
history
,
*NL*
says
plainly
:
I
am
free
and
am
therefore
not
subject
to
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
the
problem
of
man
's
free
will
,
though
unexpressed
,
is
*NL*
felt
at
every
step
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
seriously
thinking
historians
have
involuntarily
encountered
this
*NL*
question
.
All
the
contradictions
and
obscurities
of
history
and
the
*NL*
false
path
historical
science
has
followed
are
due
solely
to
the
lack
of
*NL*
a
solution
of
that
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
will
of
every
man
were
free
,
that
is
,
if
each
man
could
act
as
he
*NL*
pleased
,
all
history
would
be
a
series
of
disconnected
incidents
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
in
a
thousand
years
even
one
man
in
a
million
could
act
freely
,
that
*NL*
is
,
as
he
chose
,
it
is
evident
that
one
single
free
act
of
that
man
's
in
*NL*
violation
of
the
laws
governing
human
action
would
destroy
the
*NL*
possibility
of
the
existence
of
any
laws
for
the
whole
of
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
be
a
single
law
governing
the
actions
of
men
,
free
will
can
not
*NL*
exist
,
for
then
man
's
will
is
subject
to
that
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
contradiction
lies
the
problem
of
free
will
,
which
from
most
*NL*
ancient
times
has
occupied
the
best
human
minds
and
from
most
ancient
*NL*
times
has
been
presented
in
its
whole
tremendous
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
problem
is
that
regarding
man
as
a
subject
of
observation
from
*NL*
whatever
point
of
view
--
theological
,
historical
,
ethical
,
or
*NL*
philosophic
--
we
find
a
general
law
of
necessity
to
which
he
-LRB-
like
all
*NL*
that
exists
-RRB-
is
subject
.
But
regarding
him
from
within
ourselves
as
what
*NL*
we
are
conscious
of
,
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
consciousness
is
a
source
of
self-cognition
quite
apart
from
and
*NL*
independent
of
reason
.
Through
his
reason
man
observes
himself
,
but
only
*NL*
through
consciousness
does
he
know
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
consciousness
of
self
no
observation
or
application
of
reason
*NL*
is
conceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
understand
,
observe
,
and
draw
conclusions
,
man
must
first
of
all
be
*NL*
conscious
of
himself
as
living
.
A
man
is
only
conscious
of
himself
as
a
*NL*
living
being
by
the
fact
that
he
wills
,
that
is
,
is
conscious
of
his
*NL*
volition
.
But
his
will
--
which
forms
the
essence
of
his
life
--
man
*NL*
recognizes
-LRB-
and
can
but
recognize
-RRB-
as
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
observing
himself
,
man
sees
that
his
will
is
always
directed
by
one
*NL*
and
the
same
law
-LRB-
whether
he
observes
the
necessity
of
taking
food
,
*NL*
using
his
brain
,
or
anything
else
-RRB-
he
can
not
recognize
this
never
-
*NL*
varying
direction
of
his
will
otherwise
than
as
a
limitation
of
it
.
Were
*NL*
it
not
free
it
could
not
be
limited
.
A
man
's
will
seems
to
him
to
be
*NL*
limited
just
because
he
is
not
conscious
of
it
except
as
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
say
:
I
am
not
free
.
But
I
have
lifted
my
hand
and
let
it
fall
.
*NL*
Everyone
understands
that
this
illogical
reply
is
an
irrefutable
*NL*
demonstration
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
reply
is
the
expression
of
a
consciousness
that
is
not
subject
to
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
consciousness
of
freedom
were
not
a
separate
and
independent
*NL*
source
of
self-consciousness
it
would
be
subject
to
reasoning
and
to
*NL*
experience
,
but
in
fact
such
subjection
does
not
exist
and
is
*NL*
inconceivable
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
series
of
experiments
and
arguments
proves
to
every
man
that
he
,
as
an
*NL*
object
of
observation
,
is
subject
to
certain
laws
,
and
man
submits
to
*NL*
them
and
never
resists
the
laws
of
gravity
or
impermeability
once
he
has
*NL*
become
acquainted
with
them
.
But
the
same
series
of
experiments
and
*NL*
arguments
proves
to
him
that
the
complete
freedom
of
which
he
is
*NL*
conscious
in
himself
is
impossible
,
and
that
his
every
action
depends
on
*NL*
his
organization
,
his
character
,
and
the
motives
acting
upon
him
;
yet
*NL*
man
never
submits
to
the
deductions
of
these
experiments
and
arguments
.
*NL*
Having
learned
from
experiment
and
argument
that
a
stone
falls
*NL*
downwards
,
a
man
indubitably
believes
this
and
always
expects
the
law
*NL*
that
he
has
learned
to
be
fulfilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
learning
just
as
certainly
that
his
will
is
subject
to
laws
,
he
does
*NL*
not
and
can
not
believe
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
often
experiment
and
reasoning
may
show
a
man
that
under
the
*NL*
same
conditions
and
with
the
same
character
he
will
do
the
same
thing
as
*NL*
before
,
yet
when
under
the
same
conditions
and
with
the
same
character
*NL*
he
approaches
for
the
thousandth
time
the
action
that
always
ends
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
he
feels
as
certainly
convinced
as
before
the
experiment
that
*NL*
he
can
act
as
he
pleases
.
Every
man
,
savage
or
sage
,
however
*NL*
incontestably
reason
and
experiment
may
prove
to
him
that
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
imagine
two
different
courses
of
action
in
precisely
the
*NL*
same
conditions
,
feels
that
without
this
irrational
conception
-LRB-
which
*NL*
constitutes
the
essence
of
freedom
-RRB-
he
can
not
imagine
life
.
He
feels
*NL*
that
however
impossible
it
may
be
,
it
is
so
,
for
without
this
conception
*NL*
of
freedom
not
only
would
he
be
unable
to
understand
life
,
but
he
would
*NL*
be
unable
to
live
for
a
single
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
live
,
because
all
man
's
efforts
,
all
his
impulses
to
life
,
*NL*
are
only
efforts
to
increase
freedom
.
Wealth
and
poverty
,
fame
and
*NL*
obscurity
,
power
and
subordination
,
strength
and
weakness
,
health
and
*NL*
disease
,
culture
and
ignorance
,
work
and
leisure
,
repletion
and
hunger
,
*NL*
virtue
and
vice
,
are
only
greater
or
lesser
degrees
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
having
no
freedom
can
not
be
conceived
of
except
as
deprived
of
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
conception
of
freedom
appears
to
reason
to
be
a
senseless
*NL*
contradiction
like
the
possibility
of
performing
two
actions
at
one
and
*NL*
the
same
instant
of
time
,
or
of
an
effect
without
a
cause
,
that
only
*NL*
proves
that
consciousness
is
not
subject
to
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unshakable
,
irrefutable
consciousness
of
freedom
,
uncontrolled
by
*NL*
experiment
or
argument
,
recognized
by
all
thinkers
and
felt
by
everyone
*NL*
without
exception
,
this
consciousness
without
which
no
conception
of
man
*NL*
is
possible
constitutes
the
other
side
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
is
the
creation
of
an
all-powerful
,
all-good
,
and
all-seeing
God
.
*NL*
What
is
sin
,
the
conception
of
which
arises
from
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
man
's
freedom
?
That
is
a
question
for
theology
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
actions
of
men
are
subject
to
general
immutable
laws
expressed
in
*NL*
statistics
.
What
is
man
's
responsibility
to
society
,
the
conception
of
*NL*
which
results
from
the
conception
of
freedom
?
That
is
a
question
for
*NL*
jurisprudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
's
actions
proceed
from
his
innate
character
and
the
motives
acting
*NL*
upon
him
.
What
is
conscience
and
the
perception
of
right
and
wrong
in
*NL*
actions
that
follows
from
the
consciousness
of
freedom
?
That
is
a
*NL*
question
for
ethics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
in
connection
with
the
general
life
of
humanity
appears
subject
to
*NL*
laws
which
determine
that
life
.
But
the
same
man
apart
from
that
*NL*
connection
appears
to
be
free
.
How
should
the
past
life
of
nations
and
*NL*
of
humanity
be
regarded
--
as
the
result
of
the
free
,
or
as
the
result
of
*NL*
the
constrained
,
activity
of
man
?
That
is
a
question
for
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
in
our
self-confident
day
of
the
popularization
of
knowledge
--
*NL*
thanks
to
that
most
powerful
engine
of
ignorance
,
the
diffusion
of
*NL*
printed
matter
--
has
the
question
of
the
freedom
of
will
been
put
on
a
*NL*
level
on
which
the
question
itself
can
not
exist
.
In
our
time
the
*NL*
majority
of
so-called
advanced
people
--
that
is
,
the
crowd
of
*NL*
ignoramuses
--
have
taken
the
work
of
the
naturalists
who
deal
with
one
*NL*
side
of
the
question
for
a
solution
of
the
whole
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
say
and
write
and
print
that
the
soul
and
freedom
do
not
exist
,
for
*NL*
the
life
of
man
is
expressed
by
muscular
movements
and
muscular
*NL*
movements
are
conditioned
by
the
activity
of
the
nerves
;
the
soul
and
*NL*
free
will
do
not
exist
because
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
we
sprang
*NL*
from
the
apes
.
They
say
this
,
not
at
all
suspecting
that
thousands
of
*NL*
years
ago
that
same
law
of
necessity
which
with
such
ardor
they
are
now
*NL*
trying
to
prove
by
physiology
and
comparative
zoology
was
not
merely
*NL*
acknowledged
by
all
the
religions
and
all
the
thinkers
,
but
has
never
*NL*
been
denied
.
They
do
not
see
that
the
role
of
the
natural
sciences
in
*NL*
this
matter
is
merely
to
serve
as
an
instrument
for
the
illumination
of
*NL*
one
side
of
it
.
For
the
fact
that
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
observation
,
reason
and
the
will
are
merely
secretions
of
the
brain
,
and
*NL*
that
man
following
the
general
law
may
have
developed
from
lower
animals
*NL*
at
some
unknown
period
of
time
,
only
explains
from
a
fresh
side
the
*NL*
truth
admitted
thousands
of
years
ago
by
all
the
religious
and
*NL*
philosophic
theories
--
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
reason
man
is
*NL*
subject
to
the
law
of
necessity
;
but
it
does
not
advance
by
a
hair
's
*NL*
breadth
the
solution
of
the
question
,
which
has
another
,
opposite
,
side
,
*NL*
based
on
the
consciousness
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
men
descended
from
the
apes
at
an
unknown
period
of
time
,
that
is
as
*NL*
comprehensible
as
that
they
were
made
from
a
handful
of
earth
at
a
*NL*
certain
period
of
time
-LRB-
in
the
first
case
the
unknown
quantity
is
the
*NL*
time
,
in
the
second
case
it
is
the
origin
-RRB-
;
and
the
question
of
how
*NL*
man
's
consciousness
of
freedom
is
to
be
reconciled
with
the
law
of
*NL*
necessity
to
which
he
is
subject
can
not
be
solved
by
comparative
*NL*
physiology
and
zoology
,
for
in
a
frog
,
a
rabbit
,
or
an
ape
,
we
can
*NL*
observe
only
the
muscular
nervous
activity
,
but
in
man
we
observe
*NL*
consciousness
as
well
as
the
muscular
and
nervous
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
naturalists
and
their
followers
,
thinking
they
can
solve
this
*NL*
question
,
are
like
plasterers
set
to
plaster
one
side
of
the
walls
of
a
*NL*
church
who
,
availing
themselves
of
the
absence
of
the
chief
*NL*
superintendent
of
the
work
,
should
in
an
access
of
zeal
plaster
over
the
*NL*
windows
,
icons
,
woodwork
,
and
still
unbuttressed
walls
,
and
should
be
*NL*
delighted
that
from
their
point
of
view
as
plasterers
,
everything
is
now
*NL*
so
smooth
and
regular
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
solution
of
the
question
of
free
will
or
inevitability
,
history
*NL*
has
this
advantage
over
other
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
the
*NL*
question
is
dealt
with
,
that
for
history
this
question
does
not
refer
to
*NL*
the
essence
of
man
's
free
will
but
its
manifestation
in
the
past
and
*NL*
under
certain
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
regard
to
this
question
,
history
stands
to
the
other
sciences
as
*NL*
experimental
science
stands
to
abstract
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
for
history
is
not
man
's
will
itself
but
our
presentation
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
for
history
,
the
insoluble
mystery
presented
by
the
*NL*
incompatibility
of
free
will
and
inevitability
does
not
exist
as
it
does
*NL*
for
theology
,
ethics
,
and
philosophy
.
History
surveys
a
presentation
of
*NL*
man
's
life
in
which
the
union
of
these
two
contradictions
has
already
*NL*
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
actual
life
each
historic
event
,
each
human
action
,
is
very
clearly
*NL*
and
definitely
understood
without
any
sense
of
contradiction
,
although
*NL*
each
event
presents
itself
as
partly
free
and
partly
compulsory
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
solve
the
question
of
how
freedom
and
necessity
are
combined
and
what
*NL*
constitutes
the
essence
of
these
two
conceptions
,
the
philosophy
of
*NL*
history
can
and
should
follow
a
path
contrary
to
that
taken
by
other
*NL*
sciences
.
Instead
of
first
defining
the
conceptions
of
freedom
and
*NL*
inevitability
in
themselves
,
and
then
ranging
the
phenomena
of
life
*NL*
under
those
definitions
,
history
should
deduce
a
definition
of
the
*NL*
conception
of
freedom
and
inevitability
themselves
from
the
immense
*NL*
quantity
of
phenomena
of
which
it
is
cognizant
and
that
always
appear
*NL*
dependent
on
these
two
elements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
presentation
of
the
activity
of
many
men
or
of
an
individual
we
*NL*
may
consider
,
we
always
regard
it
as
the
result
partly
of
man
's
free
*NL*
will
and
partly
of
the
law
of
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
we
speak
of
the
migration
of
the
peoples
and
the
incursions
of
*NL*
the
barbarians
,
or
of
the
decrees
of
Napoleon
III
,
or
of
someone
's
*NL*
action
an
hour
ago
in
choosing
one
direction
out
of
several
for
his
*NL*
walk
,
we
are
unconscious
of
any
contradiction
.
The
degree
of
freedom
and
*NL*
inevitability
governing
the
actions
of
these
people
is
clearly
defined
*NL*
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
conception
of
the
degree
of
freedom
often
varies
according
to
*NL*
differences
in
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
regard
the
event
,
but
*NL*
every
human
action
appears
to
us
as
a
certain
combination
of
freedom
and
*NL*
inevitability
.
In
every
action
we
examine
we
see
a
certain
measure
of
*NL*
freedom
and
a
certain
measure
of
inevitability
.
And
always
the
more
*NL*
freedom
we
see
in
any
action
the
less
inevitability
do
we
perceive
,
and
*NL*
the
more
inevitability
the
less
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
proportion
of
freedom
to
inevitability
decreases
and
increases
*NL*
according
to
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
action
is
regarded
,
but
*NL*
their
relation
is
always
one
of
inverse
proportion
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sinking
man
who
clutches
at
another
and
drowns
him
;
or
a
hungry
mother
*NL*
exhausted
by
feeding
her
baby
,
who
steals
some
food
;
or
a
man
trained
to
*NL*
discipline
who
on
duty
at
the
word
of
command
kills
a
defenseless
man
--
*NL*
seem
less
guilty
,
that
is
,
less
free
and
more
subject
to
the
law
of
*NL*
necessity
,
to
one
who
knows
the
circumstances
in
which
these
people
were
*NL*
placed
,
and
more
free
to
one
who
does
not
know
that
the
man
was
himself
*NL*
drowning
,
that
the
mother
was
hungry
,
that
the
soldier
was
in
the
ranks
,
*NL*
and
so
on
.
Similarly
a
man
who
committed
a
murder
twenty
years
ago
and
*NL*
has
since
lived
peaceably
and
harmlessly
in
society
seems
less
guilty
*NL*
and
his
action
more
due
to
the
law
of
inevitability
,
to
someone
who
*NL*
considers
his
action
after
twenty
years
have
elapsed
than
to
one
who
*NL*
examined
it
the
day
after
it
was
committed
.
And
in
the
same
way
every
*NL*
action
of
an
insane
,
intoxicated
,
or
highly
excited
man
appears
less
*NL*
free
and
more
inevitable
to
one
who
knows
the
mental
condition
of
him
*NL*
who
committed
the
action
,
and
seems
more
free
and
less
inevitable
to
one
*NL*
who
does
not
know
it
.
In
all
these
cases
the
conception
of
freedom
is
*NL*
increased
or
diminished
and
the
conception
of
compulsion
is
*NL*
correspondingly
decreased
or
increased
,
according
to
the
point
of
view
*NL*
from
which
the
action
is
regarded
.
So
that
the
greater
the
conception
of
*NL*
necessity
the
smaller
the
conception
of
freedom
and
vice
versa
.
*NL*
*NL*
Religion
,
the
common
sense
of
mankind
,
the
science
of
jurisprudence
,
and
*NL*
history
itself
understand
alike
this
relation
between
necessity
and
*NL*
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
cases
without
exception
in
which
our
conception
of
freedom
and
*NL*
necessity
is
increased
and
diminished
depend
on
three
considerations
:
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
The
relation
to
the
external
world
of
the
man
who
commits
the
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
His
relation
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
His
relation
to
the
causes
leading
to
the
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
consideration
is
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
man
's
*NL*
relation
to
the
external
world
and
the
greater
or
lesser
clearness
of
*NL*
our
understanding
of
the
definite
position
occupied
by
the
man
in
*NL*
relation
to
everything
coexisting
with
him
.
This
is
what
makes
it
*NL*
evident
that
a
drowning
man
is
less
free
and
more
subject
to
necessity
*NL*
than
one
standing
on
dry
ground
,
and
that
makes
the
actions
of
a
man
*NL*
closely
connected
with
others
in
a
thickly
populated
district
,
or
of
one
*NL*
bound
by
family
,
official
,
or
business
duties
,
seem
certainly
less
free
*NL*
and
more
subject
to
necessity
than
those
of
a
man
living
in
solitude
and
*NL*
seclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
consider
a
man
alone
,
apart
from
his
relation
to
everything
around
*NL*
him
,
each
action
of
his
seems
to
us
free
.
But
if
we
see
his
relation
to
*NL*
anything
around
him
,
if
we
see
his
connection
with
anything
whatever
--
*NL*
with
a
man
who
speaks
to
him
,
a
book
he
reads
,
the
work
on
which
he
is
*NL*
engaged
,
even
with
the
air
he
breathes
or
the
light
that
falls
on
the
*NL*
things
about
him
--
we
see
that
each
of
these
circumstances
has
an
*NL*
influence
on
him
and
controls
at
least
some
side
of
his
activity
.
And
*NL*
the
more
we
perceive
of
these
influences
the
more
our
conception
of
his
*NL*
freedom
diminishes
and
the
more
our
conception
of
the
necessity
that
*NL*
weighs
on
him
increases
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
consideration
is
the
more
or
less
evident
time
relation
of
*NL*
the
man
to
the
world
and
the
clearness
of
our
perception
of
the
place
*NL*
the
man
's
action
occupies
in
time
.
That
is
the
ground
which
makes
the
*NL*
fall
of
the
first
man
,
resulting
in
the
production
of
the
human
race
,
*NL*
appear
evidently
less
free
than
a
man
's
entry
into
marriage
today
.
It
is
*NL*
the
reason
why
the
life
and
activity
of
people
who
lived
centuries
ago
*NL*
and
are
connected
with
me
in
time
can
not
seem
to
me
as
free
as
the
life
*NL*
of
a
contemporary
,
the
consequences
of
which
are
still
unknown
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
degree
of
our
conception
of
freedom
or
inevitability
depends
in
this
*NL*
respect
on
the
greater
or
lesser
lapse
of
time
between
the
performance
*NL*
of
the
action
and
our
judgment
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
examine
an
act
I
performed
a
moment
ago
in
approximately
the
same
*NL*
circumstances
as
those
I
am
in
now
,
my
action
appears
to
me
undoubtedly
*NL*
free
.
But
if
I
examine
an
act
performed
a
month
ago
,
then
being
in
*NL*
different
circumstances
,
I
can
not
help
recognizing
that
if
that
act
had
*NL*
not
been
committed
much
that
resulted
from
it
--
good
,
agreeable
,
and
even
*NL*
essential
--
would
not
have
taken
place
.
If
I
reflect
on
an
action
still
*NL*
more
remote
,
ten
years
ago
or
more
,
then
the
consequences
of
my
action
*NL*
are
still
plainer
to
me
and
I
find
it
hard
to
imagine
what
would
have
*NL*
happened
had
that
action
not
been
performed
.
The
farther
I
go
back
in
*NL*
memory
,
or
what
is
the
same
thing
the
farther
I
go
forward
in
my
*NL*
judgment
,
the
more
doubtful
becomes
my
belief
in
the
freedom
of
my
*NL*
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
history
we
find
a
very
similar
progress
of
conviction
concerning
the
*NL*
part
played
by
free
will
in
the
general
affairs
of
humanity
.
A
*NL*
contemporary
event
seems
to
us
to
be
indubitably
the
doing
of
all
the
*NL*
known
participants
,
but
with
a
more
remote
event
we
already
see
its
*NL*
inevitable
results
which
prevent
our
considering
anything
else
possible
.
*NL*
And
the
farther
we
go
back
in
examining
events
the
less
arbitrary
do
*NL*
they
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Austro-Prussian
war
appears
to
us
undoubtedly
the
result
of
the
*NL*
crafty
conduct
of
Bismarck
,
and
so
on
.
The
Napoleonic
wars
still
seem
to
*NL*
us
,
though
already
questionably
,
to
be
the
outcome
of
their
heroes
'
*NL*
will
.
But
in
the
Crusades
we
already
see
an
event
occupying
its
definite
*NL*
place
in
history
and
without
which
we
can
not
imagine
the
modern
history
*NL*
of
Europe
,
though
to
the
chroniclers
of
the
Crusades
that
event
appeared
*NL*
as
merely
due
to
the
will
of
certain
people
.
In
regard
to
the
migration
*NL*
of
the
peoples
it
does
not
enter
anyone
's
head
today
to
suppose
that
the
*NL*
renovation
of
the
European
world
depended
on
Attila
's
caprice
.
The
*NL*
farther
back
in
history
the
object
of
our
observation
lies
,
the
more
*NL*
doubtful
does
the
free
will
of
those
concerned
in
the
event
become
and
*NL*
the
more
manifest
the
law
of
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
consideration
is
the
degree
to
which
we
apprehend
that
endless
*NL*
chain
of
causation
inevitably
demanded
by
reason
,
in
which
each
*NL*
phenomenon
comprehended
,
and
therefore
man
's
every
action
,
must
have
its
*NL*
definite
place
as
a
result
of
what
has
gone
before
and
as
a
cause
of
*NL*
what
will
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
better
we
are
acquainted
with
the
physiological
,
psychological
,
and
*NL*
historical
laws
deduced
by
observation
and
by
which
man
is
controlled
,
*NL*
and
the
more
correctly
we
perceive
the
physiological
,
psychological
,
and
*NL*
historical
causes
of
the
action
,
and
the
simpler
the
action
we
are
*NL*
observing
and
the
less
complex
the
character
and
mind
of
the
man
in
*NL*
question
,
the
more
subject
to
inevitability
and
the
less
free
do
our
*NL*
actions
and
those
of
others
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
do
not
at
all
understand
the
cause
of
an
action
,
whether
a
*NL*
crime
,
a
good
action
,
or
even
one
that
is
simply
nonmoral
,
we
ascribe
a
*NL*
greater
amount
of
freedom
to
it
.
In
the
case
of
a
crime
we
most
urgently
*NL*
demand
the
punishment
for
such
an
act
;
in
the
case
of
a
virtuous
act
we
*NL*
rate
its
merit
most
highly
.
In
an
indifferent
case
we
recognize
in
it
*NL*
more
individuality
,
originality
,
and
independence
.
But
if
even
one
of
*NL*
the
innumerable
causes
of
the
act
is
known
to
us
we
recognize
a
certain
*NL*
element
of
necessity
and
are
less
insistent
on
punishment
for
the
crime
,
*NL*
or
the
acknowledgment
of
the
merit
of
the
virtuous
act
,
or
the
freedom
*NL*
of
the
apparently
original
action
.
That
a
criminal
was
reared
among
male
*NL*
factors
mitigates
his
fault
in
our
eyes
.
The
self-sacrifice
of
a
father
*NL*
or
mother
,
or
self-sacrifice
with
the
possibility
of
a
reward
,
is
more
*NL*
comprehensible
than
gratuitous
self-sacrifice
,
and
therefore
seems
less
*NL*
deserving
of
sympathy
and
less
the
result
of
free
will
.
The
founder
of
a
*NL*
sect
or
party
,
or
an
inventor
,
impresses
us
less
when
we
know
how
or
by
*NL*
what
the
way
was
prepared
for
his
activity
.
If
we
have
a
large
range
of
*NL*
examples
,
if
our
observation
is
constantly
directed
to
seeking
the
*NL*
correlation
of
cause
and
effect
in
people
's
actions
,
their
actions
*NL*
appear
to
us
more
under
compulsion
and
less
free
the
more
correctly
we
*NL*
connect
the
effects
with
the
causes
.
If
we
examined
simple
actions
and
*NL*
had
a
vast
number
of
such
actions
under
observation
,
our
conception
of
*NL*
their
inevitability
would
be
still
greater
.
The
dishonest
conduct
of
the
*NL*
son
of
a
dishonest
father
,
the
misconduct
of
a
woman
who
had
fallen
into
*NL*
bad
company
,
a
drunkard
's
relapse
into
drunkenness
,
and
so
on
are
*NL*
actions
that
seem
to
us
less
free
the
better
we
understand
their
cause
.
*NL*
If
the
man
whose
actions
we
are
considering
is
on
a
very
low
stage
of
*NL*
mental
development
,
like
a
child
,
a
madman
,
or
a
simpleton
--
then
,
*NL*
knowing
the
causes
of
the
act
and
the
simplicity
of
the
character
and
*NL*
intelligence
in
question
,
we
see
so
large
an
element
of
necessity
and
so
*NL*
little
free
will
that
as
soon
as
we
know
the
cause
prompting
the
action
*NL*
we
can
foretell
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
these
three
considerations
alone
is
based
the
conception
of
*NL*
irresponsibility
for
crimes
and
the
extenuating
circumstances
admitted
*NL*
by
all
legislative
codes
.
The
responsibility
appears
greater
or
less
*NL*
according
to
our
greater
or
lesser
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
in
*NL*
which
the
man
was
placed
whose
action
is
being
judged
,
and
according
to
*NL*
the
greater
or
lesser
interval
of
time
between
the
commission
of
the
*NL*
action
and
its
investigation
,
and
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
*NL*
understanding
of
the
causes
that
led
to
the
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
our
conception
of
free
will
and
inevitability
gradually
diminishes
*NL*
or
increases
according
to
the
greater
or
lesser
connection
with
the
*NL*
external
world
,
the
greater
or
lesser
remoteness
of
time
,
and
the
*NL*
greater
or
lesser
dependence
on
the
causes
in
relation
to
which
we
*NL*
contemplate
a
man
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
if
we
examine
the
case
of
a
man
whose
connection
with
the
*NL*
external
world
is
well
known
,
where
the
time
between
the
action
and
its
*NL*
examination
is
great
,
and
where
the
causes
of
the
action
are
most
*NL*
accessible
,
we
get
the
conception
of
a
maximum
of
inevitability
and
a
*NL*
minimum
of
free
will
.
If
we
examine
a
man
little
dependent
on
external
*NL*
conditions
,
whose
action
was
performed
very
recently
,
and
the
causes
of
*NL*
whose
action
are
beyond
our
ken
,
we
get
the
conception
of
a
minimum
of
*NL*
inevitability
and
a
maximum
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
neither
case
--
however
we
may
change
our
point
of
view
,
however
plain
*NL*
we
may
make
to
ourselves
the
connection
between
the
man
and
the
external
*NL*
world
,
however
inaccessible
it
may
be
to
us
,
however
long
or
short
the
*NL*
period
of
time
,
however
intelligible
or
incomprehensible
the
causes
of
*NL*
the
action
may
be
--
can
we
ever
conceive
either
complete
freedom
or
*NL*
complete
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-

-RRB-
To
whatever
degree
we
may
imagine
a
man
to
be
exempt
from
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
external
world
,
we
never
get
a
conception
of
freedom
in
*NL*
space
.
Every
human
action
is
inevitably
conditioned
by
what
surrounds
*NL*
him
and
by
his
own
body
.
I
lift
my
arm
and
let
it
fall
.
My
action
seems
*NL*
to
me
free
;
but
asking
myself
whether
I
could
raise
my
arm
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
I
see
that
I
raised
it
in
the
direction
in
which
there
was
*NL*
least
obstruction
to
that
action
either
from
things
around
me
or
from
*NL*
the
construction
of
my
own
body
.
I
chose
one
out
of
all
the
possible
*NL*
directions
because
in
it
there
were
fewest
obstacles
.
For
my
action
to
*NL*
be
free
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
encounter
no
obstacles
.
To
*NL*
conceive
of
a
man
being
free
we
must
imagine
him
outside
space
,
which
is
*NL*
evidently
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
However
much
we
approximate
the
time
of
judgment
to
the
time
of
the
*NL*
deed
,
we
never
get
a
conception
of
freedom
in
time
.
For
if
I
examine
an
*NL*
action
committed
a
second
ago
I
must
still
recognize
it
as
not
being
*NL*
free
,
for
it
is
irrevocably
linked
to
the
moment
at
which
it
was
*NL*
committed
.
Can
I
lift
my
arm
?
I
lift
it
,
but
ask
myself
:
could
I
have
*NL*
abstained
from
lifting
my
arm
at
the
moment
that
has
already
passed
?
To
*NL*
convince
myself
of
this
I
do
not
lift
it
the
next
moment
.
But
I
am
not
*NL*
now
abstaining
from
doing
so
at
the
first
moment
when
I
asked
the
*NL*
question
.
Time
has
gone
by
which
I
could
not
detain
,
the
arm
I
then
*NL*
lifted
is
no
longer
the
same
as
the
arm
I
now
refrain
from
lifting
,
nor
*NL*
is
the
air
in
which
I
lifted
it
the
same
that
now
surrounds
me
.
The
*NL*
moment
in
which
the
first
movement
was
made
is
irrevocable
,
and
at
that
*NL*
moment
I
could
make
only
one
movement
,
and
whatever
movement
I
made
*NL*
would
be
the
only
one
.
That
I
did
not
lift
my
arm
a
moment
later
does
*NL*
not
prove
that
I
could
have
abstained
from
lifting
it
then
.
And
since
I
*NL*
could
make
only
one
movement
at
that
single
moment
of
time
,
it
could
not
*NL*
have
been
any
other
.
To
imagine
it
as
free
,
it
is
necessary
to
imagine
*NL*
it
in
the
present
,
on
the
boundary
between
the
past
and
the
future
--
that
*NL*
is
,
outside
time
,
which
is
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
However
much
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
causes
may
be
*NL*
increased
,
we
never
reach
a
conception
of
complete
freedom
,
that
is
,
an
*NL*
absence
of
cause
.
However
inaccessible
to
us
may
be
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
expression
of
will
in
any
action
,
our
own
or
another
's
,
the
first
demand
*NL*
of
reason
is
the
assumption
of
and
search
for
a
cause
,
for
without
a
*NL*
cause
no
phenomenon
is
conceivable
.
I
raise
my
arm
to
perform
an
action
*NL*
independently
of
any
cause
,
but
my
wish
to
perform
an
action
without
a
*NL*
cause
is
the
cause
of
my
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
if
--
imagining
a
man
quite
exempt
from
all
influences
,
examining
*NL*
only
his
momentary
action
in
the
present
,
unevoked
by
any
cause
--
we
were
*NL*
to
admit
so
infinitely
small
a
remainder
of
inevitability
as
equaled
*NL*
zero
,
we
should
even
then
not
have
arrived
at
the
conception
of
complete
*NL*
freedom
in
man
,
for
a
being
uninfluenced
by
the
external
world
,
standing
*NL*
outside
of
time
and
independent
of
cause
,
is
no
longer
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
we
can
never
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
quite
devoid
of
*NL*
freedom
and
entirely
subject
to
the
law
of
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
However
we
may
increase
our
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
space
in
*NL*
which
man
is
situated
,
that
knowledge
can
never
be
complete
,
for
the
*NL*
number
of
those
conditions
is
as
infinite
as
the
infinity
of
space
.
And
*NL*
therefore
so
long
as
not
all
the
conditions
influencing
men
are
defined
,
*NL*
there
is
no
complete
inevitability
but
a
certain
measure
of
freedom
*NL*
remains
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
However
we
may
prolong
the
period
of
time
between
the
action
we
are
*NL*
examining
and
the
judgment
upon
it
,
that
period
will
be
finite
,
while
*NL*
time
is
infinite
,
and
so
in
this
respect
too
there
can
never
be
absolute
*NL*
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
However
accessible
may
be
the
chain
of
causation
of
any
action
,
we
*NL*
shall
never
know
the
whole
chain
since
it
is
endless
,
and
so
again
we
*NL*
never
reach
absolute
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
this
,
even
if
,
admitting
the
remaining
minimum
of
freedom
to
*NL*
equal
zero
,
we
assumed
in
some
given
case
--
as
for
instance
in
that
of
a
*NL*
dying
man
,
an
unborn
babe
,
or
an
idiot
--
complete
absence
of
freedom
,
by
*NL*
so
doing
we
should
destroy
the
very
conception
of
man
in
the
case
we
are
*NL*
examining
,
for
as
soon
as
there
is
no
freedom
there
is
also
no
man
.
And
*NL*
so
the
conception
of
the
action
of
a
man
subject
solely
to
the
law
of
*NL*
inevitability
without
any
element
of
freedom
is
just
as
impossible
as
*NL*
the
conception
of
a
man
's
completely
free
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
to
imagine
the
action
of
a
man
entirely
subject
to
the
law
of
*NL*
inevitability
without
any
freedom
,
we
must
assume
the
knowledge
of
an
*NL*
infinite
number
of
space
relations
,
an
infinitely
long
period
of
time
,
*NL*
and
an
infinite
series
of
causes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
imagine
a
man
perfectly
free
and
not
subject
to
the
law
of
*NL*
inevitability
,
we
must
imagine
him
all
alone
,
beyond
space
,
beyond
time
,
*NL*
and
free
from
dependence
on
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
case
,
if
inevitability
were
possible
without
freedom
we
*NL*
should
have
reached
a
definition
of
inevitability
by
the
laws
of
*NL*
inevitability
itself
,
that
is
,
a
mere
form
without
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
case
,
if
freedom
were
possible
without
inevitability
we
*NL*
should
have
arrived
at
unconditioned
freedom
beyond
space
,
time
,
and
*NL*
cause
,
which
by
the
fact
of
its
being
unconditioned
and
unlimited
would
*NL*
be
nothing
,
or
mere
content
without
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
should
in
fact
have
reached
those
two
fundamentals
of
which
man
's
*NL*
whole
outlook
on
the
universe
is
constructed
--
the
incomprehensible
*NL*
essence
of
life
,
and
the
laws
defining
that
essence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reason
says
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
space
with
all
the
forms
of
matter
that
give
it
*NL*
visibility
is
infinite
,
and
can
not
be
imagined
otherwise
.
-LRB-

-RRB-
Time
is
*NL*
infinite
motion
without
a
moment
of
rest
and
is
unthinkable
otherwise
.
*NL*
-LRB-

-RRB-
The
connection
between
cause
and
effect
has
no
beginning
and
can
*NL*
have
no
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consciousness
says
:
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
I
alone
am
,
and
all
that
exists
is
but
me
,
*NL*
consequently
I
include
space
.
-LRB-
2
-RRB-
I
measure
flowing
time
by
the
fixed
*NL*
moment
of
the
present
in
which
alone
I
am
conscious
of
myself
as
living
,
*NL*
consequently
I
am
outside
time
.
-LRB-
3
-RRB-
I
am
beyond
cause
,
for
I
feel
myself
*NL*
to
be
the
cause
of
every
manifestation
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reason
gives
expression
to
the
laws
of
inevitability
.
Consciousness
*NL*
gives
expression
to
the
essence
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freedom
not
limited
by
anything
is
the
essence
of
life
,
in
man
's
*NL*
consciousness
.
Inevitability
without
content
is
man
's
reason
in
its
*NL*
three
forms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Freedom
is
the
thing
examined
.
Inevitability
is
what
examines
.
Freedom
*NL*
is
the
content
.
Inevitability
is
the
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
separating
the
two
sources
of
cognition
,
related
to
one
another
*NL*
as
form
to
content
,
do
we
get
the
mutually
exclusive
and
separately
*NL*
incomprehensible
conceptions
of
freedom
and
inevitability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
uniting
them
do
we
get
a
clear
conception
of
man
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
these
two
concepts
which
in
their
union
mutually
define
one
*NL*
another
as
form
and
content
,
no
conception
of
life
is
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
we
know
of
the
life
of
man
is
merely
a
certain
relation
of
free
*NL*
will
to
inevitability
,
that
is
,
of
consciousness
to
the
laws
of
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
we
know
of
the
external
world
of
nature
is
only
a
certain
*NL*
relation
of
the
forces
of
nature
to
inevitability
,
or
of
the
essence
of
*NL*
life
to
the
laws
of
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
natural
forces
lie
outside
us
and
we
are
not
conscious
of
*NL*
them
;
we
call
those
forces
gravitation
,
inertia
,
electricity
,
animal
*NL*
force
,
and
so
on
,
but
we
are
conscious
of
the
force
of
life
in
man
and
*NL*
we
call
that
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
the
force
of
gravitation
,
incomprehensible
in
itself
but
*NL*
felt
by
every
man
,
is
understood
by
us
only
to
the
extent
to
which
we
*NL*
know
the
laws
of
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
-LRB-
from
the
first
*NL*
knowledge
that
all
bodies
have
weight
,
up
to
Newton
's
law
-RRB-
,
so
too
the
*NL*
force
of
free
will
,
incomprehensible
in
itself
but
of
which
everyone
is
*NL*
conscious
,
is
intelligible
to
us
only
in
as
far
as
we
know
the
laws
of
*NL*
inevitability
to
which
it
is
subject
-LRB-
from
the
fact
that
every
man
dies
,
*NL*
up
to
the
knowledge
of
the
most
complex
economic
and
historic
laws
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
knowledge
is
merely
a
bringing
of
this
essence
of
life
under
the
*NL*
laws
of
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
's
free
will
differs
from
every
other
force
in
that
man
is
directly
*NL*
conscious
of
it
,
but
in
the
eyes
of
reason
it
in
no
way
differs
from
any
*NL*
other
force
.
The
forces
of
gravitation
,
electricity
,
or
chemical
*NL*
affinity
are
only
distinguished
from
one
another
in
that
they
are
*NL*
differently
defined
by
reason
.
Just
so
the
force
of
man
's
free
will
is
*NL*
distinguished
by
reason
from
the
other
forces
of
nature
only
by
the
*NL*
definition
reason
gives
it
.
Freedom
,
apart
from
necessity
,
that
is
,
*NL*
apart
from
the
laws
of
reason
that
define
it
,
differs
in
no
way
from
*NL*
gravitation
,
or
heat
,
or
the
force
that
makes
things
grow
;
for
reason
,
*NL*
it
is
only
a
momentary
undefinable
sensation
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
the
undefinable
essence
of
the
force
moving
the
heavenly
bodies
,
*NL*
the
undefinable
essence
of
the
forces
of
heat
and
electricity
,
or
of
*NL*
chemical
affinity
,
or
of
the
vital
force
,
forms
the
content
of
*NL*
astronomy
,
physics
,
chemistry
,
botany
,
zoology
,
and
so
on
,
just
in
the
*NL*
same
way
does
the
force
of
free
will
form
the
content
of
history
.
But
*NL*
just
as
the
subject
of
every
science
is
the
manifestation
of
this
*NL*
unknown
essence
of
life
while
that
essence
itself
can
only
be
the
*NL*
subject
of
metaphysics
,
even
the
manifestation
of
the
force
of
free
will
*NL*
in
human
beings
in
space
,
in
time
,
and
in
dependence
on
cause
forms
the
*NL*
subject
of
history
,
while
free
will
itself
is
the
subject
of
*NL*
metaphysics
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
experimental
sciences
what
we
know
we
call
the
laws
of
*NL*
inevitability
,
what
is
unknown
to
us
we
call
vital
force
.
Vital
force
is
*NL*
only
an
expression
for
the
unknown
remainder
over
and
above
what
we
know
*NL*
of
the
essence
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
also
in
history
what
is
known
to
us
we
call
laws
of
inevitability
,
*NL*
what
is
unknown
we
call
free
will
.
Free
will
is
for
history
only
an
*NL*
expression
for
the
unknown
remainder
of
what
we
know
about
the
laws
of
*NL*
human
life
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
History
examines
the
manifestations
of
man
's
free
will
in
connection
*NL*
with
the
external
world
in
time
and
in
dependence
on
cause
,
that
is
,
it
*NL*
defines
this
freedom
by
the
laws
of
reason
,
and
so
history
is
a
science
*NL*
only
in
so
far
as
this
free
will
is
defined
by
those
laws
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
recognition
of
man
's
free
will
as
something
capable
of
influencing
*NL*
historical
events
,
that
is
,
as
not
subject
to
laws
,
is
the
same
for
*NL*
history
as
the
recognition
of
a
free
force
moving
the
heavenly
bodies
*NL*
would
be
for
astronomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
assumption
would
destroy
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
laws
,
*NL*
that
is
,
of
any
science
whatever
.
If
there
is
even
a
single
body
moving
*NL*
freely
,
then
the
laws
of
Kepler
and
Newton
are
negatived
and
no
*NL*
conception
of
the
movement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
any
longer
exists
.
If
*NL*
any
single
action
is
due
to
free
will
,
then
not
a
single
historical
law
*NL*
can
exist
,
nor
any
conception
of
historical
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
history
,
lines
exist
of
the
movement
of
human
wills
,
one
end
of
*NL*
which
is
hidden
in
the
unknown
but
at
the
other
end
of
which
a
*NL*
consciousness
of
man
's
will
in
the
present
moves
in
space
,
time
,
and
*NL*
dependence
on
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
this
field
of
motion
spreads
out
before
our
eyes
,
the
more
*NL*
evident
are
the
laws
of
that
movement
.
To
discover
and
define
those
laws
*NL*
is
the
problem
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
standpoint
from
which
the
science
of
history
now
regards
its
*NL*
subject
on
the
path
it
now
follows
,
seeking
the
causes
of
events
in
*NL*
man
's
freewill
,
a
scientific
enunciation
of
those
laws
is
impossible
,
*NL*
for
however
man
's
free
will
may
be
restricted
,
as
soon
as
we
recognize
*NL*
it
as
a
force
not
subject
to
law
,
the
existence
of
law
becomes
*NL*
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
by
reducing
this
element
of
free
will
to
the
infinitesimal
,
that
*NL*
is
,
by
regarding
it
as
an
infinitely
small
quantity
,
can
we
convince
*NL*
ourselves
of
the
absolute
inaccessibility
of
the
causes
,
and
then
*NL*
instead
of
seeking
causes
,
history
will
take
the
discovery
of
laws
as
*NL*
its
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
for
these
laws
has
long
been
begun
and
the
new
methods
of
*NL*
thought
which
history
must
adopt
are
being
worked
out
simultaneously
*NL*
with
the
self-destruction
toward
which
--
ever
dissecting
and
dissecting
*NL*
the
causes
of
phenomena
--
the
old
method
of
history
is
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
human
sciences
have
traveled
along
that
path
.
Arriving
at
*NL*
infinitesimals
,
mathematics
,
the
most
exact
of
sciences
,
abandons
the
*NL*
process
of
analysis
and
enters
on
the
new
process
of
the
integration
of
*NL*
unknown
,
infinitely
small
,
quantities
.
Abandoning
the
conception
of
*NL*
cause
,
mathematics
seeks
law
,
that
is
,
the
property
common
to
all
*NL*
unknown
,
infinitely
small
,
elements
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
form
but
along
the
same
path
of
reflection
the
other
sciences
*NL*
have
proceeded
.
When
Newton
enunciated
the
law
of
gravity
he
did
not
say
*NL*
that
the
sun
or
the
earth
had
a
property
of
attraction
;
he
said
that
all
*NL*
bodies
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
have
the
property
of
attracting
*NL*
one
another
,
that
is
,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
bodies
,
he
expressed
the
property
common
to
all
bodies
*NL*
from
the
infinitely
large
to
the
infinitely
small
.
The
same
is
done
by
*NL*
the
natural
sciences
:
leaving
aside
the
question
of
cause
,
they
seek
for
*NL*
laws
.
History
stands
on
the
same
path
.
And
if
history
has
for
its
object
*NL*
the
study
of
the
movement
of
the
nations
and
of
humanity
and
not
the
*NL*
narration
of
episodes
in
the
lives
of
individuals
,
it
too
,
setting
aside
*NL*
the
conception
of
cause
,
should
seek
the
laws
common
to
all
the
*NL*
inseparably
interconnected
infinitesimal
elements
of
free
will
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
time
the
law
of
Copernicus
was
discovered
and
proved
,
the
mere
*NL*
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
sun
but
the
earth
that
moves
*NL*
sufficed
to
destroy
the
whole
cosmography
of
the
ancients
.
By
disproving
*NL*
that
law
it
might
have
been
possible
to
retain
the
old
conception
of
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
bodies
,
but
without
disproving
it
,
it
would
seem
*NL*
impossible
to
continue
studying
the
Ptolemaic
worlds
.
But
even
after
the
*NL*
discovery
of
the
law
of
Copernicus
the
Ptolemaic
worlds
were
still
*NL*
studied
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
time
the
first
person
said
and
proved
that
the
number
of
births
*NL*
or
of
crimes
is
subject
to
mathematical
laws
,
and
that
this
or
that
mode
*NL*
of
government
is
determined
by
certain
geographical
and
economic
*NL*
conditions
,
and
that
certain
relations
of
population
to
soil
produce
*NL*
migrations
of
peoples
,
the
foundations
on
which
history
had
been
built
*NL*
were
destroyed
in
their
essence
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
refuting
these
new
laws
the
former
view
of
history
might
have
been
*NL*
retained
;
but
without
refuting
them
it
would
seem
impossible
to
continue
*NL*
studying
historic
events
as
the
results
of
man
's
free
will
.
For
if
a
*NL*
certain
mode
of
government
was
established
or
certain
migrations
of
*NL*
peoples
took
place
in
consequence
of
such
and
such
geographic
,
*NL*
ethnographic
,
or
economic
conditions
,
then
the
free
will
of
those
*NL*
individuals
who
appear
to
us
to
have
established
that
mode
of
government
*NL*
or
occasioned
the
migrations
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
the
former
history
continues
to
be
studied
side
by
side
with
the
*NL*
laws
of
statistics
,
geography
,
political
economy
,
comparative
philology
,
*NL*
and
geology
,
which
directly
contradict
its
assumptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
struggle
between
the
old
views
and
the
new
was
long
and
stubbornly
*NL*
fought
out
in
physical
philosophy
.
Theology
stood
on
guard
for
the
old
*NL*
views
and
accused
the
new
of
violating
revelation
.
But
when
truth
*NL*
conquered
,
theology
established
itself
just
as
firmly
on
the
new
*NL*
foundation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
prolonged
and
stubborn
is
the
struggle
now
proceeding
between
*NL*
the
old
and
the
new
conception
of
history
,
and
theology
in
the
same
way
*NL*
stands
on
guard
for
the
old
view
,
and
accuses
the
new
view
of
subverting
*NL*
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
,
on
both
sides
the
struggle
provokes
*NL*
passion
and
stifles
truth
.
On
the
one
hand
there
is
fear
and
regret
for
*NL*
the
loss
of
the
whole
edifice
constructed
through
the
ages
,
on
the
other
*NL*
is
the
passion
for
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
men
who
fought
against
the
rising
truths
of
physical
philosophy
,
*NL*
it
seemed
that
if
they
admitted
that
truth
it
would
destroy
faith
in
*NL*
God
,
in
the
creation
of
the
firmament
,
and
in
the
miracle
of
Joshua
the
*NL*
son
of
Nun
.
To
the
defenders
of
the
laws
of
Copernicus
and
Newton
,
to
*NL*
Voltaire
for
example
,
it
seemed
that
the
laws
of
astronomy
destroyed
*NL*
religion
,
and
he
utilized
the
law
of
gravitation
as
a
weapon
against
*NL*
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
so
it
now
seems
as
if
we
have
only
to
admit
the
law
of
*NL*
inevitability
,
to
destroy
the
conception
of
the
soul
,
of
good
and
evil
,
*NL*
and
all
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
that
have
been
built
up
on
*NL*
those
conceptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
too
,
like
Voltaire
in
his
time
,
uninvited
defenders
of
the
law
of
*NL*
inevitability
today
use
that
law
as
a
weapon
against
religion
,
though
*NL*
the
law
of
inevitability
in
history
,
like
the
law
of
Copernicus
in
*NL*
astronomy
,
far
from
destroying
,
even
strengthens
the
foundation
on
which
*NL*
the
institutions
of
state
and
church
are
erected
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
in
the
question
of
astronomy
then
,
so
in
the
question
of
history
now
,
*NL*
the
whole
difference
of
opinion
is
based
on
the
recognition
or
*NL*
nonrecognition
of
something
absolute
,
serving
as
the
measure
of
visible
*NL*
phenomena
.
In
astronomy
it
was
the
immovability
of
the
earth
,
in
history
*NL*
it
is
the
independence
of
personality
--
free
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
with
astronomy
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
the
motion
of
the
earth
*NL*
lay
in
abandoning
the
immediate
sensation
of
the
earth
's
fixity
and
of
*NL*
the
motion
of
the
planets
,
so
in
history
the
difficulty
of
recognizing
*NL*
the
subjection
of
personality
to
the
laws
of
space
,
time
,
and
cause
lies
*NL*
in
renouncing
the
direct
feeling
of
the
independence
of
one
's
own
*NL*
personality
.
But
as
in
astronomy
the
new
view
said
:
``
It
is
true
that
we
*NL*
do
not
feel
the
movement
of
the
earth
,
but
by
admitting
its
immobility
*NL*
we
arrive
at
absurdity
,
while
by
admitting
its
motion
-LRB-
which
we
do
not
*NL*
feel
-RRB-
we
arrive
at
laws
,
''
so
also
in
history
the
new
view
says
:
``
It
is
*NL*
true
that
we
are
not
conscious
of
our
dependence
,
but
by
admitting
our
*NL*
free
will
we
arrive
at
absurdity
,
while
by
admitting
our
dependence
on
*NL*
the
external
world
,
on
time
,
and
on
cause
,
we
arrive
at
laws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
case
it
was
necessary
to
renounce
the
consciousness
of
an
*NL*
unreal
immobility
in
space
and
to
recognize
a
motion
we
did
not
feel
;
in
*NL*
the
present
case
it
is
similarly
necessary
to
renounce
a
freedom
that
*NL*
does
not
exist
,
and
to
recognize
a
dependence
of
which
we
are
not
*NL*
conscious
.
