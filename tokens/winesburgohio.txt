INTRODUCTION
*NL*
*NL*
by
Irving
Howe
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
have
been
no
more
than
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
*NL*
when
I
first
chanced
upon
Winesburg
,
Ohio
.
Gripped
by
these
*NL*
stories
and
sketches
of
Sherwood
Anderson
's
small-town
*NL*
``
grotesques
,
''
I
felt
that
he
was
opening
for
me
new
depths
*NL*
of
experience
,
touching
upon
half-buried
truths
which
*NL*
nothing
in
my
young
life
had
prepared
me
for
.
A
New
York
*NL*
City
boy
who
never
saw
the
crops
grow
or
spent
time
in
the
*NL*
small
towns
that
lay
sprinkled
across
America
,
I
found
*NL*
myself
overwhelmed
by
the
scenes
of
wasted
life
,
wasted
*NL*
love
--
was
this
the
``
real
''
America
?
--
that
Anderson
sketched
*NL*
in
Winesburg
.
In
those
days
only
one
other
book
seemed
to
*NL*
offer
so
powerful
a
revelation
,
and
that
was
Thomas
Hardy
's
*NL*
Jude
the
Obscure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
years
later
,
as
I
was
about
to
go
overseas
as
*NL*
a
soldier
,
I
spent
my
last
week-end
pass
on
a
somewhat
*NL*
quixotic
journey
to
Clyde
,
Ohio
,
the
town
upon
which
*NL*
Winesburg
was
partly
modeled
.
Clyde
looked
,
I
suppose
,
not
*NL*
very
different
from
most
other
American
towns
,
and
the
few
*NL*
of
its
residents
I
tried
to
engage
in
talk
about
Anderson
*NL*
seemed
quite
uninterested
.
This
indifference
would
not
have
*NL*
surprised
him
;
it
certainly
should
not
surprise
anyone
who
*NL*
reads
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
freed
from
the
army
,
I
started
to
write
literary
*NL*
criticism
,
and
in
1951
I
published
a
critical
biography
*NL*
of
Anderson
.
It
came
shortly
after
Lionel
Trilling
's
*NL*
influential
essay
attacking
Anderson
,
an
attack
from
*NL*
which
Anderson
's
reputation
would
never
quite
recover
.
*NL*
Trilling
charged
Anderson
with
indulging
a
vaporous
*NL*
sentimentalism
,
a
kind
of
vague
emotional
meandering
in
*NL*
stories
that
lacked
social
or
spiritual
solidity
.
There
*NL*
was
a
certain
cogency
in
Trilling
's
attack
,
at
least
*NL*
with
regard
to
Anderson
's
inferior
work
,
most
of
which
*NL*
he
wrote
after
Winesburg
,
Ohio
.
In
my
book
I
tried
,
*NL*
somewhat
awkwardly
,
to
bring
together
the
kinds
of
*NL*
judgment
Trilling
had
made
with
my
still
keen
affection
*NL*
for
the
best
of
Anderson
's
writings
.
By
then
,
I
had
*NL*
read
writers
more
complex
,
perhaps
more
distinguished
*NL*
than
Anderson
,
but
his
muted
stories
kept
a
firm
place
*NL*
in
my
memories
,
and
the
book
I
wrote
might
be
seen
as
a
*NL*
gesture
of
thanks
for
the
light
--
a
glow
of
darkness
,
*NL*
you
might
say
--
that
he
had
brought
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Decades
passed
.
I
no
longer
read
Anderson
,
perhaps
*NL*
fearing
I
might
have
to
surrender
an
admiration
of
*NL*
youth
.
-LRB-
There
are
some
writers
one
should
never
return
*NL*
to
.
-RRB-
But
now
,
in
the
fullness
of
age
,
when
asked
to
say
*NL*
a
few
introductory
words
about
Anderson
and
his
work
,
I
*NL*
have
again
fallen
under
the
spell
of
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
*NL*
again
responded
to
the
half-spoken
desires
,
the
*NL*
flickers
of
longing
that
spot
its
pages
.
Naturally
,
I
*NL*
now
have
some
changes
of
response
:
a
few
of
the
stories
*NL*
no
longer
haunt
me
as
once
they
did
,
but
the
long
story
*NL*
``
Godliness
,
''
which
years
ago
I
considered
a
failure
,
I
*NL*
now
see
as
a
quaintly
effective
account
of
the
way
*NL*
religious
fanaticism
and
material
acquisitiveness
can
*NL*
become
intertwined
in
American
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Sherwood
Anderson
was
born
in
Ohio
in
1876
.
His
*NL*
childhood
and
youth
in
Clyde
,
a
town
with
perhaps
three
*NL*
thousand
souls
,
were
scarred
by
bouts
of
poverty
,
but
*NL*
he
also
knew
some
of
the
pleasures
of
pre-industrial
*NL*
American
society
.
The
country
was
then
experiencing
*NL*
what
he
would
later
call
``
a
sudden
and
almost
universal
*NL*
turning
of
men
from
the
old
handicrafts
towards
our
*NL*
modern
life
of
machines
.
''
There
were
still
people
in
*NL*
Clyde
who
remembered
the
frontier
,
and
like
America
*NL*
itself
,
the
town
lived
by
a
mixture
of
diluted
*NL*
Calvinism
and
a
strong
belief
in
``
progress
,
''
Young
*NL*
Sherwood
,
known
as
``
Jobby
''
--
the
boy
always
ready
to
*NL*
work
--
showed
the
kind
of
entrepreneurial
spirit
that
*NL*
Clyde
respected
:
folks
expected
him
to
become
a
*NL*
``
go-getter
,
''
And
for
a
time
he
did
.
Moving
to
Chicago
*NL*
in
his
early
twenties
,
he
worked
in
an
advertising
*NL*
agency
where
he
proved
adept
at
turning
out
copy
.
``
I
*NL*
create
nothing
,
I
boost
,
I
boost
,
''
he
said
about
*NL*
himself
,
even
as
,
on
the
side
,
he
was
trying
to
write
*NL*
short
stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1904
Anderson
married
and
three
years
later
moved
to
*NL*
Elyria
,
a
town
forty
miles
west
of
Cleveland
,
where
he
*NL*
established
a
firm
that
sold
paint
.
``
I
was
going
to
be
*NL*
a
rich
man
...
Next
year
a
bigger
house
;
and
after
*NL*
that
,
presumably
,
a
country
estate
.
''
Later
he
would
say
*NL*
about
his
years
in
Elyria
,
``
I
was
a
good
deal
of
a
*NL*
Babbitt
,
but
never
completely
one
.
''
Something
drove
him
*NL*
to
write
,
perhaps
one
of
those
shapeless
hungers
--
a
*NL*
need
for
self-expression
?
a
wish
to
find
a
more
*NL*
authentic
kind
of
experience
?
--
that
would
become
a
*NL*
recurrent
motif
in
his
fiction
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
1912
,
occurred
the
great
turning
point
in
*NL*
Anderson
's
life
.
Plainly
put
,
he
suffered
a
nervous
*NL*
breakdown
,
though
in
his
memoirs
he
would
elevate
this
*NL*
into
a
moment
of
liberation
in
which
he
abandoned
the
*NL*
sterility
of
commerce
and
turned
to
the
rewards
of
*NL*
literature
.
Nor
was
this
,
I
believe
,
merely
a
deception
*NL*
on
Anderson
's
part
,
since
the
breakdown
painful
as
it
*NL*
surely
was
,
did
help
precipitate
a
basic
change
in
his
*NL*
life
.
At
the
age
of
36
,
he
left
behind
his
business
and
*NL*
moved
to
Chicago
,
becoming
one
of
the
rebellious
*NL*
writers
and
cultural
bohemians
in
the
group
that
has
*NL*
since
come
to
be
called
the
``
Chicago
Renaissance
.
''
*NL*
Anderson
soon
adopted
the
posture
of
a
free
,
liberated
*NL*
spirit
,
and
like
many
writers
of
the
time
,
he
presented
*NL*
himself
as
a
sardonic
critic
of
American
provincialism
*NL*
and
materialism
.
It
was
in
the
freedom
of
the
city
,
in
*NL*
its
readiness
to
put
up
with
deviant
styles
of
life
,
*NL*
that
Anderson
found
the
strength
to
settle
accounts
*NL*
with
--
but
also
to
release
his
affection
for
--
the
world
*NL*
of
small-town
America
.
The
dream
of
an
unconditional
*NL*
personal
freedom
,
that
hazy
American
version
of
utopia
,
*NL*
would
remain
central
throughout
Anderson
's
life
and
*NL*
work
.
It
was
an
inspiration
;
it
was
a
delusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1916
and
1917
Anderson
published
two
novels
mostly
*NL*
written
in
Elyria
,
Windy
McPherson
's
Son
and
Marching
*NL*
Men
,
both
by
now
largely
forgotten
.
They
show
patches
*NL*
of
talent
but
also
a
crudity
of
thought
and
*NL*
unsteadiness
of
language
.
No
one
reading
these
novels
*NL*
was
likely
to
suppose
that
its
author
could
soon
*NL*
produce
anything
as
remarkable
as
Winesburg
,
Ohio
.
*NL*
Occasionally
there
occurs
in
a
writer
's
career
a
*NL*
sudden
,
almost
mysterious
leap
of
talent
,
beyond
*NL*
explanation
,
perhaps
beyond
any
need
for
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1915-16
Anderson
had
begun
to
write
and
in
1919
he
*NL*
published
the
stories
that
comprise
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
*NL*
stories
that
form
,
in
sum
,
a
sort
of
loosely-strung
*NL*
episodic
novel
.
The
book
was
an
immediate
critical
*NL*
success
,
and
soon
Anderson
was
being
ranked
as
a
*NL*
significant
literary
figure
.
In
1921
the
distinguished
*NL*
literary
magazine
The
Dial
awarded
him
its
first
annual
*NL*
literary
prize
of
$
2,000
,
the
significance
of
which
is
*NL*
perhaps
best
understood
if
one
also
knows
that
the
*NL*
second
recipient
was
T.
S.
Eliot
.
But
Anderson
's
moment
*NL*
of
glory
was
brief
,
no
more
than
a
decade
,
and
sadly
,
*NL*
the
remaining
years
until
his
death
in
1940
were
marked
*NL*
by
a
sharp
decline
in
his
literary
standing
.
Somehow
,
*NL*
except
for
an
occasional
story
like
the
haunting
``
Death
*NL*
in
the
Woods
,
''
he
was
unable
to
repeat
or
surpass
his
*NL*
early
success
.
Still
,
about
Winesburg
,
Ohio
and
a
small
*NL*
number
of
stories
like
``
The
Egg
''
and
``
The
Man
Who
*NL*
Became
a
Woman
''
there
has
rarely
been
any
critical
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
Winesburg
,
Ohio
make
its
appearance
than
*NL*
a
number
of
critical
labels
were
fixed
on
it
:
the
*NL*
revolt
against
the
village
,
the
espousal
of
sexual
*NL*
freedom
,
the
deepening
of
American
realism
.
Such
tags
*NL*
may
once
have
had
their
point
,
but
by
now
they
seem
*NL*
dated
and
stale
.
The
revolt
against
the
village
-LRB-
about
*NL*
which
Anderson
was
always
ambivalent
-RRB-
has
faded
into
*NL*
history
.
The
espousal
of
sexual
freedom
would
soon
be
*NL*
exceeded
in
boldness
by
other
writers
.
And
as
for
the
*NL*
effort
to
place
Winesburg
,
Ohio
in
a
tradition
of
*NL*
American
realism
,
that
now
seems
dubious
.
Only
rarely
*NL*
is
the
object
of
Anderson
's
stories
social
*NL*
verisimilitude
,
or
the
``
photographing
''
of
familiar
*NL*
appearances
,
in
the
sense
,
say
,
that
one
might
use
to
*NL*
describe
a
novel
by
Theodore
Dreiser
or
Sinclair
Lewis
.
*NL*
Only
occasionally
,
and
then
with
a
very
light
touch
,
*NL*
does
Anderson
try
to
fill
out
the
social
arrangements
*NL*
of
his
imaginary
town
--
although
the
fact
that
his
*NL*
stories
are
set
in
a
mid-American
place
like
Winesburg
*NL*
does
constitute
an
important
formative
condition
.
You
*NL*
might
even
say
,
with
only
slight
overstatement
,
that
*NL*
what
Anderson
is
doing
in
Winesburg
,
Ohio
could
be
*NL*
described
as
``
antirealistic
,
''
fictions
notable
less
for
*NL*
precise
locale
and
social
detail
than
for
a
highly
*NL*
personal
,
even
strange
vision
of
American
life
.
Narrow
,
*NL*
intense
,
almost
claustrophobic
,
the
result
is
a
book
*NL*
about
extreme
states
of
being
,
the
collapse
of
men
and
*NL*
women
who
have
lost
their
psychic
bearings
and
now
*NL*
hover
,
at
best
tolerated
,
at
the
edge
of
the
little
*NL*
community
in
which
they
live
.
It
would
be
a
gross
*NL*
mistake
,
though
not
one
likely
to
occur
by
now
,
if
we
*NL*
were
to
take
Winesburg
,
Ohio
as
a
social
photograph
of
*NL*
``
the
typical
small
town
''
-LRB-
whatever
that
might
be
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Anderson
evokes
a
depressed
landscape
in
which
lost
*NL*
souls
wander
about
;
they
make
their
flitting
*NL*
appearances
mostly
in
the
darkness
of
night
,
these
*NL*
stumps
and
shades
of
humanity
.
This
vision
has
its
*NL*
truth
,
and
at
its
best
it
is
a
terrible
if
narrow
*NL*
truth
--
but
it
is
itself
also
grotesque
,
with
the
tone
*NL*
of
the
authorial
voice
and
the
mode
of
composition
*NL*
forming
muted
signals
of
the
book
's
content
.
Figures
*NL*
like
Dr.
Parcival
,
Kate
Swift
,
and
Wash
Williams
are
*NL*
not
,
nor
are
they
meant
to
be
,
``
fully-rounded
''
*NL*
characters
such
as
we
can
expect
in
realistic
fiction
;
*NL*
they
are
the
shards
of
life
,
glimpsed
for
a
moment
,
the
*NL*
debris
of
suffering
and
defeat
.
In
each
story
one
of
*NL*
them
emerges
,
shyly
or
with
a
false
assertiveness
,
*NL*
trying
to
reach
out
to
companionship
and
love
,
driven
*NL*
almost
mad
by
the
search
for
human
connection
.
In
the
*NL*
economy
of
Winesburg
these
grotesques
matter
less
in
*NL*
their
own
right
than
as
agents
or
symptoms
of
that
*NL*
``
indefinable
hunger
''
for
meaning
which
is
Anderson
's
*NL*
preoccupation

*NL*
*NL*
Brushing
against
one
another
,
passing
one
another
in
*NL*
the
streets
or
the
fields
,
they
see
bodies
and
hear
*NL*
voices
,
but
it
does
not
really
matter
--
they
are
*NL*
disconnected
,
psychically
lost
.
Is
this
due
to
the
*NL*
particular
circumstances
of
small-town
America
as
*NL*
Anderson
saw
it
at
the
turn
of
the
century
?
Or
does
he
*NL*
feel
that
he
is
sketching
an
inescapable
human
*NL*
condition
which
makes
all
of
us
bear
the
burden
of
*NL*
loneliness
?
Alice
Hindman
in
the
story
``
Adventure
''
*NL*
turns
her
face
to
the
wall
and
tries
``
to
force
herself
*NL*
to
face
the
fact
that
many
people
must
live
and
die
*NL*
alone
,
even
in
Winesburg
.
''
Or
especially
in
Winesburg
?
*NL*
Such
impressions
have
been
put
in
more
general
terms
in
*NL*
Anderson
's
only
successful
novel
,
Poor
White
:
*NL*
*NL*
All
men
lead
their
lives
behind
a
wall
of
*NL*
misunderstanding
they
have
themselves
built
,
*NL*
and
most
men
die
in
silence
and
unnoticed
*NL*
behind
the
walls
.
Now
and
then
a
man
,
cut
*NL*
off
from
his
fellows
by
the
peculiarities
*NL*
of
his
nature
,
becomes
absorbed
in
doing
*NL*
something
that
is
personal
,
useful
and
*NL*
beautiful
.
Word
of
his
activities
is
*NL*
carried
over
the
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
``
walls
''
of
misunderstanding
are
only
seldom
due
*NL*
to
physical
deformities

Wing
Biddlebaum
in
``
Hands
''

or
*NL*
oppressive
social
arrangements

Teacher

''
-RRB-
Misunderstanding
,
loneliness
,
the
inability
*NL*
to
articulate
,
are
all
seen
by
Anderson
as
virtually
a
*NL*
root
condition
,
something
deeply
set
in
our
natures
.
*NL*
Nor
are
these
people
,
the
grotesques
,
simply
to
be
*NL*
pitied
and
dismissed
;
at
some
point
in
their
lives
they
*NL*
have
known
desire
,
have
dreamt
of
ambition
,
have
hoped
*NL*
for
friendship
.
In
all
of
them
there
was
once
something
*NL*
sweet
,
``
like
the
twisted
little
apples
that
grow
in
the
*NL*
orchards
in
Winesburg
.
''
Now
,
broken
and
adrift
,
they
*NL*
clutch
at
some
rigid
notion
or
idea
,
a
``
truth
''
which
*NL*
turns
out
to
bear
the
stamp
of
monomania
,
leaving
them
*NL*
helplessly
sputtering
,
desperate
to
speak
out
but
*NL*
unable
to
.
Winesburg
,
Ohio
registers
the
losses
*NL*
inescapable
to
life
,
and
it
does
so
with
a
deep
*NL*
fraternal
sadness
,
a
sympathy
casting
a
mild
glow
over
*NL*
the
entire
book
.
``
Words
,
''
as
the
American
writer
Paula
*NL*
Fox
has
said
,
``
are
nets
through
which
all
truth
*NL*
escapes
.
''
Yet
what
do
we
have
but
words
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
want
,
these
Winesburg
grotesques
,
to
unpack
their
*NL*
hearts
,
to
release
emotions
buried
and
festering
.
Wash
*NL*
Williams
tries
to
explain
his
eccentricity
but
hardly
*NL*
can
;
Louise
Bentley
``
tried
to
talk
but
could
say
*NL*
nothing
''
;
Enoch
Robinson
retreats
to
a
fantasy
world
,
*NL*
inventing
``
his
own
people
to
whom
he
could
really
talk
*NL*
and
to
whom
he
explained
the
things
he
had
been
unable
*NL*
to
explain
to
living
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
own
somber
way
,
Anderson
has
here
touched
upon
*NL*
one
of
the
great
themes
of
American
literature
,
*NL*
especially
Midwestern
literature
,
in
the
late
*NL*
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
:
the
struggle
*NL*
for
speech
as
it
entails
a
search
for
the
self
.
Perhaps
*NL*
the
central
Winesburg
story
,
tracing
the
basic
*NL*
movements
of
the
book
,
is
``
Paper
Pills
,
''
in
which
the
*NL*
old
Doctor
Reefy
sits
``
in
his
empty
office
close
by
a
*NL*
window
that
was
covered
with
cobwebs
,
''
writes
down
some
*NL*
thoughts
on
slips
of
paper
-LRB-
``
pyramids
of
truth
,
''
he
*NL*
calls
them
-RRB-
and
then
stuffs
them
into
his
pockets
where
*NL*
they
``
become
round
hard
balls
''
soon
to
be
discarded
.
*NL*
What
Dr.
Reefy
's
``
truths
''
may
be
we
never
know
;
*NL*
Anderson
simply
persuades
us
that
to
this
lonely
old
*NL*
man
they
are
utterly
precious
and
thereby
*NL*
incommunicable
,
forming
a
kind
of
blurred
moral
*NL*
signature
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
the
attentive
reader
will
notice
in
these
*NL*
stories
a
recurrent
pattern
of
theme
and
incident
:
the
*NL*
grotesques
,
gathering
up
a
little
courage
,
venture
out
*NL*
into
the
streets
of
Winesburg
,
often
in
the
dark
,
there
*NL*
to
establish
some
initiatory
relationship
with
George
*NL*
Willard
,
the
young
reporter
who
has
n't
yet
lived
long
*NL*
enough
to
become
a
grotesque
.
Hesitantly
,
fearfully
,
or
*NL*
with
a
sputtering
incoherent
rage
,
they
approach
him
,
*NL*
pleading
that
he
listen
to
their
stories
in
the
hope
*NL*
that
perhaps
they
can
find
some
sort
of
renewal
in
his
*NL*
youthful
voice
.
Upon
this
sensitive
and
fragile
boy
*NL*
they
pour
out
their
desires
and
frustrations
.
Dr.
*NL*
Parcival
hopes
that
George
Willard
``
will
write
the
book
*NL*
I
may
never
get
written
,
''
and
for
Enoch
Robinson
,
the
*NL*
boy
represents
``
the
youthful
sadness
,
young
man
's
*NL*
sadness
,
the
sadness
of
a
growing
boy
in
a
village
at
*NL*
the
year
's
end
-LSB-
which
may
open
-RSB-
the
lips
of
the
old
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
the
grotesques
really
need
is
each
other
,
but
*NL*
their
estrangement
is
so
extreme
they
can
not
establish
*NL*
direct
ties
--
they
can
only
hope
for
connection
through
*NL*
George
Willard
.
The
burden
this
places
on
the
boy
is
*NL*
more
than
he
can
bear
.
He
listens
to
them
attentively
,
*NL*
he
is
sympathetic
to
their
complaints
,
but
finally
he
*NL*
is
too
absorbed
in
his
own
dreams
.
The
grotesques
turn
*NL*
to
him
because
he
seems
``
different
''
--
younger
,
more
*NL*
open
,
not
yet
hardened
--
but
it
is
precisely
this
*NL*
``
difference
''
that
keeps
him
from
responding
as
warmly
*NL*
as
they
want
.
It
is
hardly
the
boy
's
fault
;
it
is
*NL*
simply
in
the
nature
of
things
.
For
George
Willard
,
the
*NL*
grotesques
form
a
moment
in
his
education
;
for
the
*NL*
grotesques
,
their
encounters
with
George
Willard
come
*NL*
to
seem
like
a
stamp
of
hopelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prose
Anderson
employs
in
telling
these
stories
may
*NL*
seem
at
first
glance
to
be
simple
:
short
sentences
,
a
*NL*
sparse
vocabulary
,
uncomplicated
syntax
.
In
actuality
,
*NL*
Anderson
developed
an
artful
style
in
which
,
following
*NL*
Mark
Twain
and
preceding
Ernest
Hemingway
,
he
tried
to
*NL*
use
American
speech
as
the
base
of
a
tensed
rhythmic
*NL*
prose
that
has
an
economy
and
a
shapeliness
seldom
*NL*
found
in
ordinary
speech
or
even
oral
narration
.
What
*NL*
Anderson
employs
here
is
a
stylized
version
of
the
*NL*
American
language
,
sometimes
rising
to
quite
formal
*NL*
rhetorical
patterns
and
sometimes
sinking
to
a
*NL*
self-conscious
mannerism
.
But
at
its
best
,
Anderson
's
*NL*
prose
style
in
Winesburg
,
Ohio
is
a
supple
instrument
,
*NL*
yielding
that
``
low
fine
music
''
which
he
admired
so
much
*NL*
in
the
stories
of
Turgenev
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
worst
fates
that
can
befall
a
writer
is
that
*NL*
of
self-imitation
:
the
effort
later
in
life
,
often
*NL*
desperate
,
to
recapture
the
tones
and
themes
of
*NL*
youthful
beginnings
.
Something
of
the
sort
happened
*NL*
with
Anderson
's
later
writings
.
Most
critics
and
*NL*
readers
grew
impatient
with
the
work
he
did
after
,
say
,
*NL*
1927
or
1928
;
they
felt
he
was
constantly
repeating
his
*NL*
gestures
of
emotional
``
groping
''
--
what
he
had
called
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
Ohio
the
``
indefinable
hunger
''
that
prods
and
*NL*
torments
people
.
It
became
the
critical
fashion
to
see
*NL*
Anderson
's
``
gropings
''
as
a
sign
of
delayed
adolescence
,
*NL*
a
failure
to
develop
as
a
writer
.
Once
he
wrote
a
*NL*
chilling
reply
to
those
who
dismissed
him
in
this
way
:
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
matters
much
,
all
this
calling
a
man
*NL*
a
muddler
,
a
groper
,
etc.
...
The
very
man
who
throws
*NL*
such
words
as
these
knows
in
his
heart
that
he
is
also
*NL*
facing
a
wall
.
''
This
remark
seems
to
me
both
dignified
*NL*
and
strong
,
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
was
some
*NL*
justice
in
the
negative
responses
to
his
later
work
.
*NL*
For
what
characterized
it
was
not
so
much
``
groping
''
as
*NL*
the
imitation
of
``
groping
,
''
the
self-caricature
of
a
*NL*
writer
who
feels
driven
back
upon
an
earlier
self
that
*NL*
is
,
alas
,
no
longer
available
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Winesburg
,
Ohio
remains
a
vital
work
,
fresh
and
*NL*
authentic
.
Most
of
its
stories
are
composed
in
a
minor
*NL*
key
,
a
tone
of
subdued
pathos
--
pathos
marking
both
the
*NL*
nature
and
limit
of
Anderson
's
talent
.
-LRB-
He
spoke
of
*NL*
himself
as
a
``
minor
writer
.
''
-RRB-
In
a
few
stories
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
able
to
reach
beyond
pathos
and
to
*NL*
strike
a
tragic
note
.
The
single
best
story
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
Ohio
is
,
I
think
,
``
The
Untold
Lie
,
''
in
which
*NL*
the
urgency
of
choice
becomes
an
outer
sign
of
a
tragic
*NL*
element
in
the
human
condition
.
And
in
Anderson
's
*NL*
single
greatest
story
,
``
The
Egg
,
''
which
appeared
a
few
*NL*
years
after
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
he
succeeded
in
bringing
*NL*
together
a
surface
of
farce
with
an
undertone
of
*NL*
tragedy
.
``
The
Egg
''
is
an
American
masterpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anderson
's
influence
upon
later
American
writers
,
*NL*
especially
those
who
wrote
short
stories
,
has
been
*NL*
enormous
.
Ernest
Hemingway
and
William
Faulkner
both
*NL*
praised
him
as
a
writer
who
brought
a
new
tremor
of
*NL*
feeling
,
a
new
sense
of
introspectiveness
to
the
*NL*
American
short
story
.
As
Faulkner
put
it
,
Anderson
's
*NL*
``
was
the
fumbling
for
exactitude
,
the
exact
word
and
*NL*
phrase
within
the
limited
scope
of
a
vocabulary
*NL*
controlled
and
even
repressed
by
what
was
in
him
almost
*NL*
a
fetish
of
simplicity
...
to
seek
always
to
penetrate
*NL*
to
thought
's
uttermost
end
.
''
And
in
many
younger
*NL*
writers
who
may
not
even
be
aware
of
the
Anderson
*NL*
influence
,
you
can
see
touches
of
his
approach
,
echoes
*NL*
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Writing
about
the
Elizabethan
playwright
John
Ford
,
the
*NL*
poet
Algernon
Swinburne
once
said
:
``
If
he
touches
you
*NL*
once
he
takes
you
,
and
what
he
takes
he
keeps
hold
of
;
*NL*
his
work
becomes
part
of
your
thought
and
parcel
of
*NL*
your
spiritual
furniture
forever
.
''
So
it
is
,
for
me
and
*NL*
many
others
,
with
Sherwood
Anderson
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
memory
of
my
mother
,
*NL*
*NL*
EMMA
SMITH
ANDERSON
,
*NL*
*NL*
whose
keen
observations
on
the
life
about
*NL*
her
first
awoke
in
me
the
hunger
to
see
*NL*
beneath
the
surface
of
lives
,
*NL*
this
book
is
dedicated
.

*NL*
THE
BOOK
OF
*NL*
THE
GROTESQUE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
writer
,
an
old
man
with
a
white
mustache
,
had
some
*NL*
difficulty
in
getting
into
bed
.
The
windows
of
the
*NL*
house
in
which
he
lived
were
high
and
he
wanted
to
look
*NL*
at
the
trees
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
.
A
carpenter
*NL*
came
to
fix
the
bed
so
that
it
would
be
on
a
level
with
*NL*
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
a
fuss
was
made
about
the
matter
.
The
carpenter
,
*NL*
who
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
Civil
War
,
came
into
the
*NL*
writer
's
room
and
sat
down
to
talk
of
building
a
*NL*
platform
for
the
purpose
of
raising
the
bed
.
The
writer
*NL*
had
cigars
lying
about
and
the
carpenter
smoked
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
the
two
men
talked
of
the
raising
of
the
bed
*NL*
and
then
they
talked
of
other
things
.
The
soldier
got
*NL*
on
the
subject
of
the
war
.
The
writer
,
in
fact
,
led
him
*NL*
to
that
subject
.
The
carpenter
had
once
been
a
prisoner
*NL*
in
Andersonville
prison
and
had
lost
a
brother
.
The
*NL*
brother
had
died
of
starvation
,
and
whenever
the
*NL*
carpenter
got
upon
that
subject
he
cried
.
He
,
like
the
*NL*
old
writer
,
had
a
white
mustache
,
and
when
he
cried
he
*NL*
puckered
up
his
lips
and
the
mustache
bobbed
up
and
*NL*
down
.
The
weeping
old
man
with
the
cigar
in
his
mouth
*NL*
was
ludicrous
.
The
plan
the
writer
had
for
the
raising
*NL*
of
his
bed
was
forgotten
and
later
the
carpenter
did
it
*NL*
in
his
own
way
and
the
writer
,
who
was
past
sixty
,
had
*NL*
to
help
himself
with
a
chair
when
he
went
to
bed
at
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
bed
the
writer
rolled
over
on
his
side
and
lay
*NL*
quite
still
.
For
years
he
had
been
beset
with
notions
*NL*
concerning
his
heart
.
He
was
a
hard
smoker
and
his
*NL*
heart
fluttered
.
The
idea
had
got
into
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
would
some
time
die
unexpectedly
and
always
when
he
got
*NL*
into
bed
he
thought
of
that
.
It
did
not
alarm
him
.
The
*NL*
effect
in
fact
was
quite
a
special
thing
and
not
easily
*NL*
explained
.
It
made
him
more
alive
,
there
in
bed
,
than
*NL*
at
any
other
time
.
Perfectly
still
he
lay
and
his
body
*NL*
was
old
and
not
of
much
use
any
more
,
but
something
*NL*
inside
him
was
altogether
young
.
He
was
like
a
pregnant
*NL*
woman
,
only
that
the
thing
inside
him
was
not
a
baby
*NL*
but
a
youth
.
No
,
it
was
n't
a
youth
,
it
was
a
woman
,
*NL*
young
,
and
wearing
a
coat
of
mail
like
a
knight
.
It
is
*NL*
absurd
,
you
see
,
to
try
to
tell
what
was
inside
the
old
*NL*
writer
as
he
lay
on
his
high
bed
and
listened
to
the
*NL*
fluttering
of
his
heart
.
The
thing
to
get
at
is
what
*NL*
the
writer
,
or
the
young
thing
within
the
writer
,
was
*NL*
thinking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
writer
,
like
all
of
the
people
in
the
world
,
*NL*
had
got
,
during
his
long
life
,
a
great
many
notions
in
*NL*
his
head
.
He
had
once
been
quite
handsome
and
a
number
*NL*
of
women
had
been
in
love
with
him
.
And
then
,
of
*NL*
course
,
he
had
known
people
,
many
people
,
known
them
in
*NL*
a
peculiarly
intimate
way
that
was
different
from
the
*NL*
way
in
which
you
and
I
know
people
.
At
least
that
is
*NL*
what
the
writer
thought
and
the
thought
pleased
him
.
*NL*
Why
quarrel
with
an
old
man
concerning
his
thoughts
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
bed
the
writer
had
a
dream
that
was
not
a
dream
.
*NL*
As
he
grew
somewhat
sleepy
but
was
still
conscious
,
*NL*
figures
began
to
appear
before
his
eyes
.
He
imagined
*NL*
the
young
indescribable
thing
within
himself
was
*NL*
driving
a
long
procession
of
figures
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
the
interest
in
all
this
lies
in
the
figures
*NL*
that
went
before
the
eyes
of
the
writer
.
They
were
all
*NL*
grotesques
.
All
of
the
men
and
women
the
writer
had
*NL*
ever
known
had
become
grotesques
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grotesques
were
not
all
horrible
.
Some
were
*NL*
amusing
,
some
almost
beautiful
,
and
one
,
a
woman
all
*NL*
drawn
out
of
shape
,
hurt
the
old
man
by
her
*NL*
grotesqueness
.
When
she
passed
he
made
a
noise
like
a
*NL*
small
dog
whimpering
.
Had
you
come
into
the
room
you
*NL*
might
have
supposed
the
old
man
had
unpleasant
dreams
*NL*
or
perhaps
indigestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
hour
the
procession
of
grotesques
passed
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
,
and
then
,
although
it
was
a
*NL*
painful
thing
to
do
,
he
crept
out
of
bed
and
began
to
*NL*
write
.
Some
one
of
the
grotesques
had
made
a
deep
*NL*
impression
on
his
mind
and
he
wanted
to
describe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
desk
the
writer
worked
for
an
hour
.
In
the
end
*NL*
he
wrote
a
book
which
he
called
``
The
Book
of
the
*NL*
Grotesque
.
''
It
was
never
published
,
but
I
saw
it
once
*NL*
and
it
made
an
indelible
impression
on
my
mind
.
The
*NL*
book
had
one
central
thought
that
is
very
strange
and
*NL*
has
always
remained
with
me
.
By
remembering
it
I
have
*NL*
been
able
to
understand
many
people
and
things
that
I
*NL*
was
never
able
to
understand
before
.
The
thought
was
*NL*
involved
but
a
simple
statement
of
it
would
be
*NL*
something
like
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
That
in
the
beginning
when
the
world
was
young
there
*NL*
were
a
great
many
thoughts
but
no
such
thing
as
a
*NL*
truth
.
Man
made
the
truths
himself
and
each
truth
was
a
*NL*
composite
of
a
great
many
vague
thoughts
.
All
about
in
*NL*
the
world
were
the
truths
and
they
were
all
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
had
listed
hundreds
of
the
truths
in
his
*NL*
book
.
I
will
not
try
to
tell
you
of
all
of
them
.
There
*NL*
was
the
truth
of
virginity
and
the
truth
of
passion
,
*NL*
the
truth
of
wealth
and
of
poverty
,
of
thrift
and
of
*NL*
profligacy
,
of
carelessness
and
abandon
.
Hundreds
and
*NL*
hundreds
were
the
truths
and
they
were
all
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
people
came
along
.
Each
as
he
appeared
*NL*
snatched
up
one
of
the
truths
and
some
who
were
quite
*NL*
strong
snatched
up
a
dozen
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
truths
that
made
the
people
grotesques
.
The
*NL*
old
man
had
quite
an
elaborate
theory
concerning
the
*NL*
matter
.
It
was
his
notion
that
the
moment
one
of
the
*NL*
people
took
one
of
the
truths
to
himself
,
called
it
his
*NL*
truth
,
and
tried
to
live
his
life
by
it
,
he
became
a
*NL*
grotesque
and
the
truth
he
embraced
became
a
falsehood
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
can
see
for
yourself
how
the
old
man
,
who
had
spent
*NL*
all
of
his
life
writing
and
was
filled
with
words
,
*NL*
would
write
hundreds
of
pages
concerning
this
matter
.
*NL*
The
subject
would
become
so
big
in
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
himself
would
be
in
danger
of
becoming
a
grotesque
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
,
I
suppose
,
for
the
same
reason
that
he
never
*NL*
published
the
book
.
It
was
the
young
thing
inside
him
*NL*
that
saved
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Concerning
the
old
carpenter
who
fixed
the
bed
for
the
*NL*
writer
,
I
only
mentioned
him
because
he
,
like
many
of
*NL*
what
are
called
very
common
people
,
became
the
nearest
*NL*
thing
to
what
is
understandable
and
lovable
of
all
the
*NL*
grotesques
in
the
writer
's
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HANDS
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
half
decayed
veranda
of
a
small
frame
house
*NL*
that
stood
near
the
edge
of
a
ravine
near
the
town
of
*NL*
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
a
fat
little
old
man
walked
nervously
*NL*
up
and
down
.
Across
a
long
field
that
had
been
seeded
*NL*
for
clover
but
that
had
produced
only
a
dense
crop
of
*NL*
yellow
mustard
weeds
,
he
could
see
the
public
highway
*NL*
along
which
went
a
wagon
filled
with
berry
pickers
*NL*
returning
from
the
fields
.
The
berry
pickers
,
youths
*NL*
and
maidens
,
laughed
and
shouted
boisterously
.
A
boy
*NL*
clad
in
a
blue
shirt
leaped
from
the
wagon
and
*NL*
attempted
to
drag
after
him
one
of
the
maidens
,
who
*NL*
screamed
and
protested
shrilly
.
The
feet
of
the
boy
in
*NL*
the
road
kicked
up
a
cloud
of
dust
that
floated
across
*NL*
the
face
of
the
departing
sun
.
Over
the
long
field
came
*NL*
a
thin
girlish
voice
.
``
Oh
,
you
Wing
Biddlebaum
,
comb
*NL*
your
hair
,
it
's
falling
into
your
eyes
,
''
commanded
the
*NL*
voice
to
the
man
,
who
was
bald
and
whose
nervous
little
*NL*
hands
fiddled
about
the
bare
white
forehead
as
though
*NL*
arranging
a
mass
of
tangled
locks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wing
Biddlebaum
,
forever
frightened
and
beset
by
a
*NL*
ghostly
band
of
doubts
,
did
not
think
of
himself
as
in
*NL*
any
way
a
part
of
the
life
of
the
town
where
he
had
*NL*
lived
for
twenty
years
.
Among
all
the
people
of
*NL*
Winesburg
but
one
had
come
close
to
him
.
With
George
*NL*
Willard
,
son
of
Tom
Willard
,
the
proprietor
of
the
New
*NL*
Willard
House
,
he
had
formed
something
like
a
*NL*
friendship
.
George
Willard
was
the
reporter
on
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
and
sometimes
in
the
evenings
he
walked
*NL*
out
along
the
highway
to
Wing
Biddlebaum
's
house
.
Now
*NL*
as
the
old
man
walked
up
and
down
on
the
veranda
,
his
*NL*
hands
moving
nervously
about
,
he
was
hoping
that
George
*NL*
Willard
would
come
and
spend
the
evening
with
him
.
*NL*
After
the
wagon
containing
the
berry
pickers
had
*NL*
passed
,
he
went
across
the
field
through
the
tall
*NL*
mustard
weeds
and
climbing
a
rail
fence
peered
*NL*
anxiously
along
the
road
to
the
town
.
For
a
moment
he
*NL*
stood
thus
,
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
looking
up
*NL*
and
down
the
road
,
and
then
,
fear
overcoming
him
,
ran
*NL*
back
to
walk
again
upon
the
porch
on
his
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
presence
of
George
Willard
,
Wing
Biddlebaum
,
who
*NL*
for
twenty
years
had
been
the
town
mystery
,
lost
*NL*
something
of
his
timidity
,
and
his
shadowy
personality
,
*NL*
submerged
in
a
sea
of
doubts
,
came
forth
to
look
at
the
*NL*
world
.
With
the
young
reporter
at
his
side
,
he
ventured
*NL*
in
the
light
of
day
into
Main
Street
or
strode
up
and
*NL*
down
on
the
rickety
front
porch
of
his
own
house
,
*NL*
talking
excitedly
.
The
voice
that
had
been
low
and
*NL*
trembling
became
shrill
and
loud
.
The
bent
figure
*NL*
straightened
.
With
a
kind
of
wriggle
,
like
a
fish
*NL*
returned
to
the
brook
by
the
fisherman
,
Biddlebaum
the
*NL*
silent
began
to
talk
,
striving
to
put
into
words
the
*NL*
ideas
that
had
been
accumulated
by
his
mind
during
long
*NL*
years
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wing
Biddlebaum
talked
much
with
his
hands
.
The
slender
*NL*
expressive
fingers
,
forever
active
,
forever
striving
to
*NL*
conceal
themselves
in
his
pockets
or
behind
his
back
,
*NL*
came
forth
and
became
the
piston
rods
of
his
machinery
*NL*
of
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
Wing
Biddlebaum
is
a
story
of
hands
.
Their
*NL*
restless
activity
,
like
unto
the
beating
of
the
wings
*NL*
of
an
imprisoned
bird
,
had
given
him
his
name
.
Some
*NL*
obscure
poet
of
the
town
had
thought
of
it
.
The
hands
*NL*
alarmed
their
owner
.
He
wanted
to
keep
them
hidden
away
*NL*
and
looked
with
amazement
at
the
quiet
inexpressive
*NL*
hands
of
other
men
who
worked
beside
him
in
the
fields
,
*NL*
or
passed
,
driving
sleepy
teams
on
country
roads
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
talked
to
George
Willard
,
Wing
Biddlebaum
*NL*
closed
his
fists
and
beat
with
them
upon
a
table
or
on
*NL*
the
walls
of
his
house
.
The
action
made
him
more
*NL*
comfortable
.
If
the
desire
to
talk
came
to
him
when
the
*NL*
two
were
walking
in
the
fields
,
he
sought
out
a
stump
*NL*
or
the
top
board
of
a
fence
and
with
his
hands
pounding
*NL*
busily
talked
with
renewed
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
Wing
Biddlebaum
's
hands
is
worth
a
book
in
*NL*
itself
.
Sympathetically
set
forth
it
would
tap
many
*NL*
strange
,
beautiful
qualities
in
obscure
men
.
It
is
a
*NL*
job
for
a
poet
.
In
Winesburg
the
hands
had
attracted
*NL*
attention
merely
because
of
their
activity
.
With
them
*NL*
Wing
Biddlebaum
had
picked
as
high
as
a
hundred
and
*NL*
forty
quarts
of
strawberries
in
a
day
.
They
became
his
*NL*
distinguishing
feature
,
the
source
of
his
fame
.
Also
*NL*
they
made
more
grotesque
an
already
grotesque
and
*NL*
elusive
individuality
.
Winesburg
was
proud
of
the
hands
*NL*
of
Wing
Biddlebaum
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
it
was
*NL*
proud
of
Banker
White
's
new
stone
house
and
Wesley
*NL*
Moyer
's
bay
stallion
,
Tony
Tip
,
that
had
won
the
*NL*
two-fifteen
trot
at
the
fall
races
in
Cleveland
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
George
Willard
,
he
had
many
times
wanted
to
ask
*NL*
about
the
hands
.
At
times
an
almost
overwhelming
*NL*
curiosity
had
taken
hold
of
him
.
He
felt
that
there
*NL*
must
be
a
reason
for
their
strange
activity
and
their
*NL*
inclination
to
keep
hidden
away
and
only
a
growing
*NL*
respect
for
Wing
Biddlebaum
kept
him
from
blurting
out
*NL*
the
questions
that
were
often
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
asking
.
The
two
were
*NL*
walking
in
the
fields
on
a
summer
afternoon
and
had
*NL*
stopped
to
sit
upon
a
grassy
bank
.
All
afternoon
Wing
*NL*
Biddlebaum
had
talked
as
one
inspired
.
By
a
fence
he
*NL*
had
stopped
and
beating
like
a
giant
woodpecker
upon
*NL*
the
top
board
had
shouted
at
George
Willard
,
condemning
*NL*
his
tendency
to
be
too
much
influenced
by
the
people
*NL*
about
him
,
``
You
are
destroying
yourself
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
``
You
have
the
inclination
to
be
alone
and
to
dream
and
*NL*
you
are
afraid
of
dreams
.
You
want
to
be
like
others
in
*NL*
town
here
.
You
hear
them
talk
and
you
try
to
imitate
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
grassy
bank
Wing
Biddlebaum
had
tried
again
to
*NL*
drive
his
point
home
.
His
voice
became
soft
and
*NL*
reminiscent
,
and
with
a
sigh
of
contentment
he
launched
*NL*
into
a
long
rambling
talk
,
speaking
as
one
lost
in
a
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
the
dream
Wing
Biddlebaum
made
a
picture
for
*NL*
George
Willard
.
In
the
picture
men
lived
again
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
pastoral
golden
age
.
Across
a
green
open
*NL*
country
came
clean-limbed
young
men
,
some
afoot
,
some
*NL*
mounted
upon
horses
.
In
crowds
the
young
men
came
to
*NL*
gather
about
the
feet
of
an
old
man
who
sat
beneath
a
*NL*
tree
in
a
tiny
garden
and
who
talked
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wing
Biddlebaum
became
wholly
inspired
.
For
once
he
*NL*
forgot
the
hands
.
Slowly
they
stole
forth
and
lay
upon
*NL*
George
Willard
's
shoulders
.
Something
new
and
bold
came
*NL*
into
the
voice
that
talked
.
``
You
must
try
to
forget
all
*NL*
you
have
learned
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
You
must
begin
to
*NL*
dream
.
From
this
time
on
you
must
shut
your
ears
to
the
*NL*
roaring
of
the
voices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pausing
in
his
speech
,
Wing
Biddlebaum
looked
long
and
*NL*
earnestly
at
George
Willard
.
His
eyes
glowed
.
Again
he
*NL*
raised
the
hands
to
caress
the
boy
and
then
a
look
of
*NL*
horror
swept
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
convulsive
movement
of
his
body
,
Wing
Biddlebaum
*NL*
sprang
to
his
feet
and
thrust
his
hands
deep
into
his
*NL*
trousers
pockets
.
Tears
came
to
his
eyes
.
``
I
must
be
*NL*
getting
along
home
.
I
can
talk
no
more
with
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
looking
back
,
the
old
man
had
hurried
down
the
*NL*
hillside
and
across
a
meadow
,
leaving
George
Willard
*NL*
perplexed
and
frightened
upon
the
grassy
slope
.
With
a
*NL*
shiver
of
dread
the
boy
arose
and
went
along
the
road
*NL*
toward
town
.
``
I
'll
not
ask
him
about
his
hands
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
touched
by
the
memory
of
the
terror
he
had
*NL*
seen
in
the
man
's
eyes
.
``
There
's
something
wrong
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
know
what
it
is
.
His
hands
have
something
*NL*
to
do
with
his
fear
of
me
and
of
everyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
George
Willard
was
right
.
Let
us
look
briefly
into
*NL*
the
story
of
the
hands
.
Perhaps
our
talking
of
them
*NL*
will
arouse
the
poet
who
will
tell
the
hidden
wonder
*NL*
story
of
the
influence
for
which
the
hands
were
but
*NL*
fluttering
pennants
of
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
youth
Wing
Biddlebaum
had
been
a
school
teacher
*NL*
in
a
town
in
Pennsylvania
.
He
was
not
then
known
as
*NL*
Wing
Biddlebaum
,
but
went
by
the
less
euphonic
name
of
*NL*
Adolph
Myers
.
As
Adolph
Myers
he
was
much
loved
by
the
*NL*
boys
of
his
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adolph
Myers
was
meant
by
nature
to
be
a
teacher
of
*NL*
youth
.
He
was
one
of
those
rare
,
little-understood
men
*NL*
who
rule
by
a
power
so
gentle
that
it
passes
as
a
*NL*
lovable
weakness
.
In
their
feeling
for
the
boys
under
*NL*
their
charge
such
men
are
not
unlike
the
finer
sort
of
*NL*
women
in
their
love
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
that
is
but
crudely
stated
.
It
needs
the
poet
*NL*
there
.
With
the
boys
of
his
school
,
Adolph
Myers
had
*NL*
walked
in
the
evening
or
had
sat
talking
until
dusk
*NL*
upon
the
schoolhouse
steps
lost
in
a
kind
of
dream
.
*NL*
Here
and
there
went
his
hands
,
caressing
the
shoulders
*NL*
of
the
boys
,
playing
about
the
tousled
heads
.
As
he
*NL*
talked
his
voice
became
soft
and
musical
.
There
was
a
*NL*
caress
in
that
also
.
In
a
way
the
voice
and
the
hands
,
*NL*
the
stroking
of
the
shoulders
and
the
touching
of
the
*NL*
hair
were
a
part
of
the
schoolmaster
's
effort
to
carry
*NL*
a
dream
into
the
young
minds
.
By
the
caress
that
was
in
*NL*
his
fingers
he
expressed
himself
.
He
was
one
of
those
*NL*
men
in
whom
the
force
that
creates
life
is
diffused
,
*NL*
not
centralized
.
Under
the
caress
of
his
hands
doubt
*NL*
and
disbelief
went
out
of
the
minds
of
the
boys
and
*NL*
they
began
also
to
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
tragedy
.
A
half-witted
boy
of
the
school
*NL*
became
enamored
of
the
young
master
.
In
his
bed
at
*NL*
night
he
imagined
unspeakable
things
and
in
the
morning
*NL*
went
forth
to
tell
his
dreams
as
facts
.
Strange
,
*NL*
hideous
accusations
fell
from
his
loosehung
lips
.
*NL*
Through
the
Pennsylvania
town
went
a
shiver
.
Hidden
,
*NL*
shadowy
doubts
that
had
been
in
men
's
minds
concerning
*NL*
Adolph
Myers
were
galvanized
into
beliefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tragedy
did
not
linger
.
Trembling
lads
were
jerked
*NL*
out
of
bed
and
questioned
.
``
He
put
his
arms
about
me
,
''
*NL*
said
one
.
``
His
fingers
were
always
playing
in
my
hair
,
''
*NL*
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
a
man
of
the
town
,
Henry
Bradford
,
who
*NL*
kept
a
saloon
,
came
to
the
schoolhouse
door
.
Calling
*NL*
Adolph
Myers
into
the
school
yard
he
began
to
beat
him
*NL*
with
his
fists
.
As
his
hard
knuckles
beat
down
into
the
*NL*
frightened
face
of
the
school-master
,
his
wrath
became
*NL*
more
and
more
terrible
.
Screaming
with
dismay
,
the
*NL*
children
ran
here
and
there
like
disturbed
insects
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
teach
you
to
put
your
hands
on
my
boy
,
you
*NL*
beast
,
''
roared
the
saloon
keeper
,
who
,
tired
of
beating
*NL*
the
master
,
had
begun
to
kick
him
about
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adolph
Myers
was
driven
from
the
Pennsylvania
town
in
*NL*
the
night
.
With
lanterns
in
their
hands
a
dozen
men
*NL*
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
he
lived
alone
and
*NL*
commanded
that
he
dress
and
come
forth
.
It
was
raining
*NL*
and
one
of
the
men
had
a
rope
in
his
hands
.
They
had
*NL*
intended
to
hang
the
school-master
,
but
something
in
his
*NL*
figure
,
so
small
,
white
,
and
pitiful
,
touched
their
*NL*
hearts
and
they
let
him
escape
.
As
he
ran
away
into
the
*NL*
darkness
they
repented
of
their
weakness
and
ran
after
*NL*
him
,
swearing
and
throwing
sticks
and
great
balls
of
*NL*
soft
mud
at
the
figure
that
screamed
and
ran
faster
and
*NL*
faster
into
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
twenty
years
Adolph
Myers
had
lived
alone
in
*NL*
Winesburg
.
He
was
but
forty
but
looked
sixty-five
.
The
*NL*
name
of
Biddlebaum
he
got
from
a
box
of
goods
seen
at
a
*NL*
freight
station
as
he
hurried
through
an
eastern
Ohio
*NL*
town
.
He
had
an
aunt
in
Winesburg
,
a
black-toothed
old
*NL*
woman
who
raised
chickens
,
and
with
her
he
lived
until
*NL*
she
died
.
He
had
been
ill
for
a
year
after
the
*NL*
experience
in
Pennsylvania
,
and
after
his
recovery
*NL*
worked
as
a
day
laborer
in
the
fields
,
going
timidly
*NL*
about
and
striving
to
conceal
his
hands
.
Although
he
*NL*
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
he
felt
that
the
*NL*
hands
must
be
to
blame
.
Again
and
again
the
fathers
of
*NL*
the
boys
had
talked
of
the
hands
.
``
Keep
your
hands
to
*NL*
yourself
,
''
the
saloon
keeper
had
roared
,
dancing
,
with
*NL*
fury
in
the
schoolhouse
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
veranda
of
his
house
by
the
ravine
,
Wing
*NL*
Biddlebaum
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
until
the
sun
*NL*
had
disappeared
and
the
road
beyond
the
field
was
lost
*NL*
in
the
grey
shadows
.
Going
into
his
house
he
cut
slices
*NL*
of
bread
and
spread
honey
upon
them
.
When
the
rumble
of
*NL*
the
evening
train
that
took
away
the
express
cars
*NL*
loaded
with
the
day
's
harvest
of
berries
had
passed
and
*NL*
restored
the
silence
of
the
summer
night
,
he
went
again
*NL*
to
walk
upon
the
veranda
.
In
the
darkness
he
could
not
*NL*
see
the
hands
and
they
became
quiet
.
Although
he
still
*NL*
hungered
for
the
presence
of
the
boy
,
who
was
the
*NL*
medium
through
which
he
expressed
his
love
of
man
,
the
*NL*
hunger
became
again
a
part
of
his
loneliness
and
his
*NL*
waiting
.
Lighting
a
lamp
,
Wing
Biddlebaum
washed
the
*NL*
few
dishes
soiled
by
his
simple
meal
and
,
setting
up
a
*NL*
folding
cot
by
the
screen
door
that
led
to
the
porch
,
*NL*
prepared
to
undress
for
the
night
.
A
few
stray
white
*NL*
bread
crumbs
lay
on
the
cleanly
washed
floor
by
the
*NL*
table
;
putting
the
lamp
upon
a
low
stool
he
began
to
*NL*
pick
up
the
crumbs
,
carrying
them
to
his
mouth
one
by
*NL*
one
with
unbelievable
rapidity
.
In
the
dense
blotch
of
*NL*
light
beneath
the
table
,
the
kneeling
figure
looked
*NL*
like
a
priest
engaged
in
some
service
of
his
church
.
*NL*
The
nervous
expressive
fingers
,
flashing
in
and
out
of
*NL*
the
light
,
might
well
have
been
mistaken
for
the
*NL*
fingers
of
the
devotee
going
swiftly
through
decade
*NL*
after
decade
of
his
rosary
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PAPER
PILLS
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
huge
nose
and
*NL*
hands
.
Long
before
the
time
during
which
we
will
know
*NL*
him
,
he
was
a
doctor
and
drove
a
jaded
white
horse
from
*NL*
house
to
house
through
the
streets
of
Winesburg
.
Later
*NL*
he
married
a
girl
who
had
money
.
She
had
been
left
a
*NL*
large
fertile
farm
when
her
father
died
.
The
girl
was
*NL*
quiet
,
tall
,
and
dark
,
and
to
many
people
she
seemed
*NL*
very
beautiful
.
Everyone
in
Winesburg
wondered
why
she
*NL*
married
the
doctor
.
Within
a
year
after
the
marriage
*NL*
she
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
knuckles
of
the
doctor
's
hands
were
extraordinarily
*NL*
large
.
When
the
hands
were
closed
they
looked
like
*NL*
clusters
of
unpainted
wooden
balls
as
large
as
walnuts
*NL*
fastened
together
by
steel
rods
.
He
smoked
a
cob
pipe
*NL*
and
after
his
wife
's
death
sat
all
day
in
his
empty
*NL*
office
close
by
a
window
that
was
covered
with
cobwebs
.
*NL*
He
never
opened
the
window
.
Once
on
a
hot
day
in
August
*NL*
he
tried
but
found
it
stuck
fast
and
after
that
he
*NL*
forgot
all
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winesburg
had
forgotten
the
old
man
,
but
in
Doctor
*NL*
Reefy
there
were
the
seeds
of
something
very
fine
.
*NL*
Alone
in
his
musty
office
in
the
Heffner
Block
above
*NL*
the
Paris
Dry
Goods
Company
's
store
,
he
worked
*NL*
ceaselessly
,
building
up
something
that
he
himself
*NL*
destroyed
.
Little
pyramids
of
truth
he
erected
and
*NL*
after
erecting
knocked
them
down
again
that
he
might
*NL*
have
the
truths
to
erect
other
pyramids
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Reefy
was
a
tall
man
who
had
worn
one
suit
of
*NL*
clothes
for
ten
years
.
It
was
frayed
at
the
sleeves
and
*NL*
little
holes
had
appeared
at
the
knees
and
elbows
.
In
*NL*
the
office
he
wore
also
a
linen
duster
with
huge
*NL*
pockets
into
which
he
continually
stuffed
scraps
of
*NL*
paper
.
After
some
weeks
the
scraps
of
paper
became
*NL*
little
hard
round
balls
,
and
when
the
pockets
were
*NL*
filled
he
dumped
them
out
upon
the
floor
.
For
ten
years
*NL*
he
had
but
one
friend
,
another
old
man
named
John
*NL*
Spaniard
who
owned
a
tree
nursery
.
Sometimes
,
in
a
*NL*
playful
mood
,
old
Doctor
Reefy
took
from
his
pockets
a
*NL*
handful
of
the
paper
balls
and
threw
them
at
the
*NL*
nursery
man
.
``
That
is
to
confound
you
,
you
blathering
*NL*
old
sentimentalist
,
''
he
cried
,
shaking
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
Doctor
Reefy
and
his
courtship
of
the
tall
*NL*
dark
girl
who
became
his
wife
and
left
her
money
to
him
*NL*
is
a
very
curious
story
.
It
is
delicious
,
like
the
*NL*
twisted
little
apples
that
grow
in
the
orchards
of
*NL*
Winesburg
.
In
the
fall
one
walks
in
the
orchards
and
*NL*
the
ground
is
hard
with
frost
underfoot
.
The
apples
*NL*
have
been
taken
from
the
trees
by
the
pickers
.
They
*NL*
have
been
put
in
barrels
and
shipped
to
the
cities
*NL*
where
they
will
be
eaten
in
apartments
that
are
filled
*NL*
with
books
,
magazines
,
furniture
,
and
people
.
On
the
*NL*
trees
are
only
a
few
gnarled
apples
that
the
pickers
*NL*
have
rejected
.
They
look
like
the
knuckles
of
Doctor
*NL*
Reefy
's
hands
.
One
nibbles
at
them
and
they
are
*NL*
delicious
.
Into
a
little
round
place
at
the
side
of
the
*NL*
apple
has
been
gathered
all
of
its
sweetness
.
One
runs
*NL*
from
tree
to
tree
over
the
frosted
ground
picking
the
*NL*
gnarled
,
twisted
apples
and
filling
his
pockets
with
*NL*
them
.
Only
the
few
know
the
sweetness
of
the
twisted
*NL*
apples
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
and
Doctor
Reefy
began
their
courtship
on
a
*NL*
summer
afternoon
.
He
was
forty-five
then
and
already
he
*NL*
had
begun
the
practice
of
filling
his
pockets
with
the
*NL*
scraps
of
paper
that
became
hard
balls
and
were
thrown
*NL*
away
.
The
habit
had
been
formed
as
he
sat
in
his
buggy
*NL*
behind
the
jaded
white
horse
and
went
slowly
along
*NL*
country
roads
.
On
the
papers
were
written
thoughts
,
*NL*
ends
of
thoughts
,
beginnings
of
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
by
one
the
mind
of
Doctor
Reefy
had
made
the
*NL*
thoughts
.
Out
of
many
of
them
he
formed
a
truth
that
*NL*
arose
gigantic
in
his
mind
.
The
truth
clouded
the
*NL*
world
.
It
became
terrible
and
then
faded
away
and
the
*NL*
little
thoughts
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
dark
girl
came
to
see
Doctor
Reefy
because
she
*NL*
was
in
the
family
way
and
had
become
frightened
.
She
*NL*
was
in
that
condition
because
of
a
series
of
*NL*
circumstances
also
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
death
of
her
father
and
mother
and
the
rich
acres
*NL*
of
land
that
had
come
down
to
her
had
set
a
train
of
*NL*
suitors
on
her
heels
.
For
two
years
she
saw
suitors
*NL*
almost
every
evening
.
Except
two
they
were
all
alike
.
*NL*
They
talked
to
her
of
passion
and
there
was
a
strained
*NL*
eager
quality
in
their
voices
and
in
their
eyes
when
*NL*
they
looked
at
her
.
The
two
who
were
different
were
*NL*
much
unlike
each
other
.
One
of
them
,
a
slender
young
*NL*
man
with
white
hands
,
the
son
of
a
jeweler
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
talked
continually
of
virginity
.
When
he
was
*NL*
with
her
he
was
never
off
the
subject
.
The
other
,
a
*NL*
black-haired
boy
with
large
ears
,
said
nothing
at
all
*NL*
but
always
managed
to
get
her
into
the
darkness
,
where
*NL*
he
began
to
kiss
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
the
tall
dark
girl
thought
she
would
marry
*NL*
the
jeweler
's
son
.
For
hours
she
sat
in
silence
*NL*
listening
as
he
talked
to
her
and
then
she
began
to
be
*NL*
afraid
of
something
.
Beneath
his
talk
of
virginity
she
*NL*
began
to
think
there
was
a
lust
greater
than
in
all
the
*NL*
others
.
At
times
it
seemed
to
her
that
as
he
talked
he
*NL*
was
holding
her
body
in
his
hands
.
She
imagined
him
*NL*
turning
it
slowly
about
in
the
white
hands
and
staring
*NL*
at
it
.
At
night
she
dreamed
that
he
had
bitten
into
her
*NL*
body
and
that
his
jaws
were
dripping
.
She
had
the
dream
*NL*
three
times
,
then
she
became
in
the
family
way
to
the
*NL*
one
who
said
nothing
at
all
but
who
in
the
moment
of
*NL*
his
passion
actually
did
bite
her
shoulder
so
that
for
*NL*
days
the
marks
of
his
teeth
showed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
tall
dark
girl
came
to
know
Doctor
Reefy
it
*NL*
seemed
to
her
that
she
never
wanted
to
leave
him
again
.
*NL*
She
went
into
his
office
one
morning
and
without
her
*NL*
saying
anything
he
seemed
to
know
what
had
happened
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
office
of
the
doctor
there
was
a
woman
,
the
wife
*NL*
of
the
man
who
kept
the
bookstore
in
Winesburg
.
Like
*NL*
all
old-fashioned
country
practitioners
,
Doctor
Reefy
*NL*
pulled
teeth
,
and
the
woman
who
waited
held
a
*NL*
handkerchief
to
her
teeth
and
groaned
.
Her
husband
was
*NL*
with
her
and
when
the
tooth
was
taken
out
they
both
*NL*
screamed
and
blood
ran
down
on
the
woman
's
white
dress
.
*NL*
The
tall
dark
girl
did
not
pay
any
attention
.
When
the
*NL*
woman
and
the
man
had
gone
the
doctor
smiled
.
``
I
will
*NL*
take
you
driving
into
the
country
with
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
weeks
the
tall
dark
girl
and
the
doctor
*NL*
were
together
almost
every
day
.
The
condition
that
had
*NL*
brought
her
to
him
passed
in
an
illness
,
but
she
was
*NL*
like
one
who
has
discovered
the
sweetness
of
the
*NL*
twisted
apples
,
she
could
not
get
her
mind
fixed
again
*NL*
upon
the
round
perfect
fruit
that
is
eaten
in
the
city
*NL*
apartments
.
In
the
fall
after
the
beginning
of
her
*NL*
acquaintanceship
with
him
she
married
Doctor
Reefy
and
*NL*
in
the
following
spring
she
died
.
During
the
winter
he
*NL*
read
to
her
all
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
thoughts
he
had
*NL*
scribbled
on
the
bits
of
paper
.
After
he
had
read
them
*NL*
he
laughed
and
stuffed
them
away
in
his
pockets
to
*NL*
become
round
hard
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MOTHER
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
Willard
,
the
mother
of
George
Willard
,
was
*NL*
tall
and
gaunt
and
her
face
was
marked
with
smallpox
*NL*
scars
.
Although
she
was
but
forty-five
,
some
obscure
*NL*
disease
had
taken
the
fire
out
of
her
figure
.
*NL*
Listlessly
she
went
about
the
disorderly
old
hotel
*NL*
looking
at
the
faded
wall-paper
and
the
ragged
carpets
*NL*
and
,
when
she
was
able
to
be
about
,
doing
the
work
of
a
*NL*
chambermaid
among
beds
soiled
by
the
slumbers
of
fat
*NL*
traveling
men
.
Her
husband
,
Tom
Willard
,
a
slender
,
*NL*
graceful
man
with
square
shoulders
,
a
quick
military
*NL*
step
,
and
a
black
mustache
trained
to
turn
sharply
up
*NL*
at
the
ends
,
tried
to
put
the
wife
out
of
his
mind
.
The
*NL*
presence
of
the
tall
ghostly
figure
,
moving
slowly
*NL*
through
the
halls
,
he
took
as
a
reproach
to
himself
.
*NL*
When
he
thought
of
her
he
grew
angry
and
swore
.
The
*NL*
hotel
was
unprofitable
and
forever
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
failure
and
he
wished
himself
out
of
it
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
the
old
house
and
the
woman
who
lived
there
with
him
as
*NL*
things
defeated
and
done
for
.
The
hotel
in
which
he
had
*NL*
begun
life
so
hopefully
was
now
a
mere
ghost
of
what
a
*NL*
hotel
should
be
.
As
he
went
spruce
and
business-like
*NL*
through
the
streets
of
Winesburg
,
he
sometimes
stopped
*NL*
and
turned
quickly
about
as
though
fearing
that
the
*NL*
spirit
of
the
hotel
and
of
the
woman
would
follow
him
*NL*
even
into
the
streets
.
``
Damn
such
a
life
,
damn
it
!
''
he
*NL*
sputtered
aimlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Willard
had
a
passion
for
village
politics
and
for
*NL*
years
had
been
the
leading
Democrat
in
a
strongly
*NL*
Republican
community
.
Some
day
,
he
told
himself
,
the
*NL*
tide
of
things
political
will
turn
in
my
favor
and
the
*NL*
years
of
ineffectual
service
count
big
in
the
bestowal
*NL*
of
rewards
.
He
dreamed
of
going
to
Congress
and
even
of
*NL*
becoming
governor
.
Once
when
a
younger
member
of
the
*NL*
party
arose
at
a
political
conference
and
began
to
*NL*
boast
of
his
faithful
service
,
Tom
Willard
grew
white
*NL*
with
fury
.
``
Shut
up
,
you
,
''
he
roared
,
glaring
about
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
of
service
?
What
are
you
but
a
boy
?
*NL*
Look
at
what
I
've
done
here
!
I
was
a
Democrat
here
in
*NL*
Winesburg
when
it
was
a
crime
to
be
a
Democrat
.
In
the
*NL*
old
days
they
fairly
hunted
us
with
guns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
Elizabeth
and
her
one
son
George
there
was
a
*NL*
deep
unexpressed
bond
of
sympathy
,
based
on
a
girlhood
*NL*
dream
that
had
long
ago
died
.
In
the
son
's
presence
she
*NL*
was
timid
and
reserved
,
but
sometimes
while
he
hurried
*NL*
about
town
intent
upon
his
duties
as
a
reporter
,
she
*NL*
went
into
his
room
and
closing
the
door
knelt
by
a
*NL*
little
desk
,
made
of
a
kitchen
table
,
that
sat
near
a
*NL*
window
.
In
the
room
by
the
desk
she
went
through
a
*NL*
ceremony
that
was
half
a
prayer
,
half
a
demand
,
*NL*
addressed
to
the
skies
.
In
the
boyish
figure
she
*NL*
yearned
to
see
something
half
forgotten
that
had
once
*NL*
been
a
part
of
herself
recreated
.
The
prayer
concerned
*NL*
that
.
``
Even
though
I
die
,
I
will
in
some
way
keep
*NL*
defeat
from
you
,
''
she
cried
,
and
so
deep
was
her
*NL*
determination
that
her
whole
body
shook
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
glowed
and
she
clenched
her
fists
.
``
If
I
am
dead
and
*NL*
see
him
becoming
a
meaningless
drab
figure
like
myself
,
*NL*
I
will
come
back
,
''
she
declared
.
``
I
ask
God
now
to
give
*NL*
me
that
privilege
.
I
demand
it
.
I
will
pay
for
it
.
God
*NL*
may
beat
me
with
his
fists
.
I
will
take
any
blow
that
*NL*
may
befall
if
but
this
my
boy
be
allowed
to
express
*NL*
something
for
us
both
.
''
Pausing
uncertainly
,
the
woman
*NL*
stared
about
the
boy
's
room
.
``
And
do
not
let
him
become
*NL*
smart
and
successful
either
,
''
she
added
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
communion
between
George
Willard
and
his
mother
was
*NL*
outwardly
a
formal
thing
without
meaning
.
When
she
was
*NL*
ill
and
sat
by
the
window
in
her
room
he
sometimes
went
*NL*
in
the
evening
to
make
her
a
visit
.
They
sat
by
a
*NL*
window
that
looked
over
the
roof
of
a
small
frame
*NL*
building
into
Main
Street
.
By
turning
their
heads
they
*NL*
could
see
through
another
window
,
along
an
alleyway
*NL*
that
ran
behind
the
Main
Street
stores
and
into
the
*NL*
back
door
of
Abner
Groff
's
bakery
.
Sometimes
as
they
*NL*
sat
thus
a
picture
of
village
life
presented
itself
to
*NL*
them
.
At
the
back
door
of
his
shop
appeared
Abner
Groff
*NL*
with
a
stick
or
an
empty
milk
bottle
in
his
hand
.
For
a
*NL*
long
time
there
was
a
feud
between
the
baker
and
a
grey
*NL*
cat
that
belonged
to
Sylvester
West
,
the
druggist
.
The
*NL*
boy
and
his
mother
saw
the
cat
creep
into
the
door
of
*NL*
the
bakery
and
presently
emerge
followed
by
the
baker
,
*NL*
who
swore
and
waved
his
arms
about
.
The
baker
's
eyes
*NL*
were
small
and
red
and
his
black
hair
and
beard
were
*NL*
filled
with
flour
dust
.
Sometimes
he
was
so
angry
that
,
*NL*
although
the
cat
had
disappeared
,
he
hurled
sticks
,
*NL*
bits
of
broken
glass
,
and
even
some
of
the
tools
of
his
*NL*
trade
about
.
Once
he
broke
a
window
at
the
back
of
*NL*
Sinning
's
Hardware
Store
.
In
the
alley
the
grey
cat
*NL*
crouched
behind
barrels
filled
with
torn
paper
and
*NL*
broken
bottles
above
which
flew
a
black
swarm
of
flies
.
*NL*
Once
when
she
was
alone
,
and
after
watching
a
prolonged
*NL*
and
ineffectual
outburst
on
the
part
of
the
baker
,
*NL*
Elizabeth
Willard
put
her
head
down
on
her
long
white
*NL*
hands
and
wept
.
After
that
she
did
not
look
along
the
*NL*
alleyway
any
more
,
but
tried
to
forget
the
contest
*NL*
between
the
bearded
man
and
the
cat
.
It
seemed
like
a
*NL*
rehearsal
of
her
own
life
,
terrible
in
its
vividness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
when
the
son
sat
in
the
room
with
his
*NL*
mother
,
the
silence
made
them
both
feel
awkward
.
*NL*
Darkness
came
on
and
the
evening
train
came
in
at
the
*NL*
station
.
In
the
street
below
feet
tramped
up
and
down
*NL*
upon
a
board
sidewalk
.
In
the
station
yard
,
after
the
*NL*
evening
train
had
gone
,
there
was
a
heavy
silence
.
*NL*
Perhaps
Skinner
Leason
,
the
express
agent
,
moved
a
*NL*
truck
the
length
of
the
station
platform
.
Over
on
Main
*NL*
Street
sounded
a
man
's
voice
,
laughing
.
The
door
of
the
*NL*
express
office
banged
.
George
Willard
arose
and
*NL*
crossing
the
room
fumbled
for
the
doorknob
.
Sometimes
*NL*
he
knocked
against
a
chair
,
making
it
scrape
along
the
*NL*
floor
.
By
the
window
sat
the
sick
woman
,
perfectly
*NL*
still
,
listless
.
Her
long
hands
,
white
and
bloodless
,
*NL*
could
be
seen
drooping
over
the
ends
of
the
arms
of
the
*NL*
chair
.
``
I
think
you
had
better
be
out
among
the
boys
.
*NL*
You
are
too
much
indoors
,
''
she
said
,
striving
to
*NL*
relieve
the
embarrassment
of
the
departure
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
I
would
take
a
walk
,
''
replied
George
Willard
,
who
felt
*NL*
awkward
and
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
in
July
,
when
the
transient
guests
who
made
*NL*
the
New
Willard
House
their
temporary
home
had
become
*NL*
scarce
,
and
the
hallways
,
lighted
only
by
kerosene
*NL*
lamps
turned
low
,
were
plunged
in
gloom
,
Elizabeth
*NL*
Willard
had
an
adventure
.
She
had
been
ill
in
bed
for
*NL*
several
days
and
her
son
had
not
come
to
visit
her
.
She
*NL*
was
alarmed
.
The
feeble
blaze
of
life
that
remained
in
*NL*
her
body
was
blown
into
a
flame
by
her
anxiety
and
she
*NL*
crept
out
of
bed
,
dressed
and
hurried
along
the
hallway
*NL*
toward
her
son
's
room
,
shaking
with
exaggerated
fears
.
*NL*
As
she
went
along
she
steadied
herself
with
her
hand
,
*NL*
slipped
along
the
papered
walls
of
the
hall
and
*NL*
breathed
with
difficulty
.
The
air
whistled
through
her
*NL*
teeth
.
As
she
hurried
forward
she
thought
how
foolish
*NL*
she
was
.
``
He
is
concerned
with
boyish
affairs
,
''
she
*NL*
told
herself
.
``
Perhaps
he
has
now
begun
to
walk
about
*NL*
in
the
evening
with
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
Willard
had
a
dread
of
being
seen
by
guests
*NL*
in
the
hotel
that
had
once
belonged
to
her
father
and
*NL*
the
ownership
of
which
still
stood
recorded
in
her
name
*NL*
in
the
county
courthouse
.
The
hotel
was
continually
*NL*
losing
patronage
because
of
its
shabbiness
and
she
*NL*
thought
of
herself
as
also
shabby
.
Her
own
room
was
in
*NL*
an
obscure
corner
and
when
she
felt
able
to
work
she
*NL*
voluntarily
worked
among
the
beds
,
preferring
the
labor
*NL*
that
could
be
done
when
the
guests
were
abroad
seeking
*NL*
trade
among
the
merchants
of
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
door
of
her
son
's
room
the
mother
knelt
upon
the
*NL*
floor
and
listened
for
some
sound
from
within
.
When
she
*NL*
heard
the
boy
moving
about
and
talking
in
low
tones
a
*NL*
smile
came
to
her
lips
.
George
Willard
had
a
habit
of
*NL*
talking
aloud
to
himself
and
to
hear
him
doing
so
had
*NL*
always
given
his
mother
a
peculiar
pleasure
.
The
habit
*NL*
in
him
,
she
felt
,
strengthened
the
secret
bond
that
*NL*
existed
between
them
.
A
thousand
times
she
had
*NL*
whispered
to
herself
of
the
matter
.
``
He
is
groping
*NL*
about
,
trying
to
find
himself
,
''
she
thought
.
``
He
is
not
*NL*
a
dull
clod
,
all
words
and
smartness
.
Within
him
there
*NL*
is
a
secret
something
that
is
striving
to
grow
.
It
is
*NL*
the
thing
I
let
be
killed
in
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
in
the
hallway
by
the
door
the
sick
*NL*
woman
arose
and
started
again
toward
her
own
room
.
She
*NL*
was
afraid
that
the
door
would
open
and
the
boy
come
*NL*
upon
her
.
When
she
had
reached
a
safe
distance
and
was
*NL*
about
to
turn
a
corner
into
a
second
hallway
she
*NL*
stopped
and
bracing
herself
with
her
hands
waited
,
*NL*
thinking
to
shake
off
a
trembling
fit
of
weakness
that
*NL*
had
come
upon
her
.
The
presence
of
the
boy
in
the
room
*NL*
had
made
her
happy
.
In
her
bed
,
during
the
long
hours
*NL*
alone
,
the
little
fears
that
had
visited
her
had
become
*NL*
giants
.
Now
they
were
all
gone
.
``
When
I
get
back
to
my
*NL*
room
I
shall
sleep
,
''
she
murmured
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Elizabeth
Willard
was
not
to
return
to
her
bed
and
*NL*
to
sleep
.
As
she
stood
trembling
in
the
darkness
the
*NL*
door
of
her
son
's
room
opened
and
the
boy
's
father
,
Tom
*NL*
Willard
,
stepped
out
.
In
the
light
that
steamed
out
at
*NL*
the
door
he
stood
with
the
knob
in
his
hand
and
talked
.
*NL*
What
he
said
infuriated
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Willard
was
ambitious
for
his
son
.
He
had
always
*NL*
thought
of
himself
as
a
successful
man
,
although
*NL*
nothing
he
had
ever
done
had
turned
out
successfully
.
*NL*
However
,
when
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
New
Willard
*NL*
House
and
had
no
fear
of
coming
upon
his
wife
,
he
*NL*
swaggered
and
began
to
dramatize
himself
as
one
of
the
*NL*
chief
men
of
the
town
.
He
wanted
his
son
to
succeed
.
He
*NL*
it
was
who
had
secured
for
the
boy
the
position
on
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
.
Now
,
with
a
ring
of
earnestness
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
he
was
advising
concerning
some
course
of
*NL*
conduct
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
George
,
you
've
got
to
wake
*NL*
up
,
''
he
said
sharply
.
``
Will
Henderson
has
spoken
to
me
*NL*
three
times
concerning
the
matter
.
He
says
you
go
along
*NL*
for
hours
not
hearing
when
you
are
spoken
to
and
acting
*NL*
like
a
gawky
girl
.
What
ails
you
?
''
Tom
Willard
laughed
*NL*
good-naturedly
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
you
'll
get
over
it
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
I
told
Will
that
.
You
're
not
a
fool
and
you
're
*NL*
not
a
woman
.
You
're
Tom
Willard
's
son
and
you
'll
wake
*NL*
up
.
I
'm
not
afraid
.
What
you
say
clears
things
up
.
If
*NL*
being
a
newspaper
man
had
put
the
notion
of
becoming
a
*NL*
writer
into
your
mind
that
's
all
right
.
Only
I
guess
*NL*
you
'll
have
to
wake
up
to
do
that
too
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Willard
went
briskly
along
the
hallway
and
down
a
*NL*
flight
of
stairs
to
the
office
.
The
woman
in
the
*NL*
darkness
could
hear
him
laughing
and
talking
with
a
*NL*
guest
who
was
striving
to
wear
away
a
dull
evening
by
*NL*
dozing
in
a
chair
by
the
office
door
.
She
returned
to
*NL*
the
door
of
her
son
's
room
.
The
weakness
had
passed
*NL*
from
her
body
as
by
a
miracle
and
she
stepped
boldly
*NL*
along
.
A
thousand
ideas
raced
through
her
head
.
When
*NL*
she
heard
the
scraping
of
a
chair
and
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
pen
scratching
upon
paper
,
she
again
turned
and
went
*NL*
back
along
the
hallway
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
definite
determination
had
come
into
the
mind
of
the
*NL*
defeated
wife
of
the
Winesburg
hotel
keeper
.
The
*NL*
determination
was
the
result
of
long
years
of
quiet
and
*NL*
rather
ineffectual
thinking
.
``
Now
,
''
she
told
herself
,
*NL*
``
I
will
act
.
There
is
something
threatening
my
boy
and
*NL*
I
will
ward
it
off
.
''
The
fact
that
the
conversation
*NL*
between
Tom
Willard
and
his
son
had
been
rather
quiet
*NL*
and
natural
,
as
though
an
understanding
existed
between
*NL*
them
,
maddened
her
.
Although
for
years
she
had
hated
*NL*
her
husband
,
her
hatred
had
always
before
been
a
quite
*NL*
impersonal
thing
.
He
had
been
merely
a
part
of
*NL*
something
else
that
she
hated
.
Now
,
and
by
the
few
*NL*
words
at
the
door
,
he
had
become
the
thing
personified
.
*NL*
In
the
darkness
of
her
own
room
she
clenched
her
fists
*NL*
and
glared
about
.
Going
to
a
cloth
bag
that
hung
on
a
*NL*
nail
by
the
wall
she
took
out
a
long
pair
of
sewing
*NL*
scissors
and
held
them
in
her
hand
like
a
dagger
.
``
I
*NL*
will
stab
him
,
''
she
said
aloud
.
``
He
has
chosen
to
be
*NL*
the
voice
of
evil
and
I
will
kill
him
.
When
I
have
*NL*
killed
him
something
will
snap
within
myself
and
I
will
*NL*
die
also
.
It
will
be
a
release
for
all
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
girlhood
and
before
her
marriage
with
Tom
*NL*
Willard
,
Elizabeth
had
borne
a
somewhat
shaky
*NL*
reputation
in
Winesburg
.
For
years
she
had
been
what
is
*NL*
called
``
stage-struck
''
and
had
paraded
through
the
*NL*
streets
with
traveling
men
guests
at
her
father
's
*NL*
hotel
,
wearing
loud
clothes
and
urging
them
to
tell
her
*NL*
of
life
in
the
cities
out
of
which
they
had
come
.
Once
*NL*
she
startled
the
town
by
putting
on
men
's
clothes
and
*NL*
riding
a
bicycle
down
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
own
mind
the
tall
dark
girl
had
been
in
those
*NL*
days
much
confused
.
A
great
restlessness
was
in
her
and
*NL*
it
expressed
itself
in
two
ways
.
First
there
was
an
*NL*
uneasy
desire
for
change
,
for
some
big
definite
*NL*
movement
to
her
life
.
It
was
this
feeling
that
had
*NL*
turned
her
mind
to
the
stage
.
She
dreamed
of
joining
*NL*
some
company
and
wandering
over
the
world
,
seeing
*NL*
always
new
faces
and
giving
something
out
of
herself
to
*NL*
all
people
.
Sometimes
at
night
she
was
quite
beside
*NL*
herself
with
the
thought
,
but
when
she
tried
to
talk
of
*NL*
the
matter
to
the
members
of
the
theatrical
companies
*NL*
that
came
to
Winesburg
and
stopped
at
her
father
's
*NL*
hotel
,
she
got
nowhere
.
They
did
not
seem
to
know
what
*NL*
she
meant
,
or
if
she
did
get
something
of
her
passion
*NL*
expressed
,
they
only
laughed
.
``
It
's
not
like
that
,
''
*NL*
they
said
.
``
It
's
as
dull
and
uninteresting
as
this
*NL*
here
.
Nothing
comes
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
traveling
men
when
she
walked
about
with
them
,
*NL*
and
later
with
Tom
Willard
,
it
was
quite
different
.
*NL*
Always
they
seemed
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
*NL*
her
.
On
the
side
streets
of
the
village
,
in
the
*NL*
darkness
under
the
trees
,
they
took
hold
of
her
hand
*NL*
and
she
thought
that
something
unexpressed
in
herself
*NL*
came
forth
and
became
a
part
of
an
unexpressed
*NL*
something
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
there
was
the
second
expression
of
her
*NL*
restlessness
.
When
that
came
she
felt
for
a
time
*NL*
released
and
happy
.
She
did
not
blame
the
men
who
*NL*
walked
with
her
and
later
she
did
not
blame
Tom
*NL*
Willard
.
It
was
always
the
same
,
beginning
with
kisses
*NL*
and
ending
,
after
strange
wild
emotions
,
with
peace
and
*NL*
then
sobbing
repentance
.
When
she
sobbed
she
put
her
*NL*
hand
upon
the
face
of
the
man
and
had
always
the
same
*NL*
thought
.
Even
though
he
were
large
and
bearded
she
*NL*
thought
he
had
become
suddenly
a
little
boy
.
She
*NL*
wondered
why
he
did
not
sob
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
room
,
tucked
away
in
a
corner
of
the
old
Willard
*NL*
House
,
Elizabeth
Willard
lighted
a
lamp
and
put
it
on
a
*NL*
dressing
table
that
stood
by
the
door
.
A
thought
had
*NL*
come
into
her
mind
and
she
went
to
a
closet
and
brought
*NL*
out
a
small
square
box
and
set
it
on
the
table
.
The
box
*NL*
contained
material
for
make-up
and
had
been
left
with
*NL*
other
things
by
a
theatrical
company
that
had
once
been
*NL*
stranded
in
Winesburg
.
Elizabeth
Willard
had
decided
*NL*
that
she
would
be
beautiful
.
Her
hair
was
still
black
*NL*
and
there
was
a
great
mass
of
it
braided
and
coiled
*NL*
about
her
head
.
The
scene
that
was
to
take
place
in
the
*NL*
office
below
began
to
grow
in
her
mind
.
No
ghostly
*NL*
worn-out
figure
should
confront
Tom
Willard
,
but
*NL*
something
quite
unexpected
and
startling
.
Tall
and
with
*NL*
dusky
cheeks
and
hair
that
fell
in
a
mass
from
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
a
figure
should
come
striding
down
the
*NL*
stairway
before
the
startled
loungers
in
the
hotel
*NL*
office
.
The
figure
would
be
silent
--
it
would
be
swift
*NL*
and
terrible
.
As
a
tigress
whose
cub
had
been
*NL*
threatened
would
she
appear
,
coming
out
of
the
shadows
,
*NL*
stealing
noiselessly
along
and
holding
the
long
wicked
*NL*
scissors
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
little
broken
sob
in
her
throat
,
Elizabeth
*NL*
Willard
blew
out
the
light
that
stood
upon
the
table
*NL*
and
stood
weak
and
trembling
in
the
darkness
.
The
*NL*
strength
that
had
been
as
a
miracle
in
her
body
left
*NL*
and
she
half
reeled
across
the
floor
,
clutching
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
chair
in
which
she
had
spent
so
many
long
*NL*
days
staring
out
over
the
tin
roofs
into
the
main
*NL*
street
of
Winesburg
.
In
the
hallway
there
was
the
sound
*NL*
of
footsteps
and
George
Willard
came
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
Sitting
in
a
chair
beside
his
mother
he
began
to
talk
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
get
out
of
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
where
I
shall
go
or
what
I
shall
do
but
I
am
going
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
in
the
chair
waited
and
trembled
.
An
impulse
*NL*
came
to
her
.
``
I
suppose
you
had
better
wake
up
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
You
think
that
?
You
will
go
to
the
city
and
make
*NL*
money
,
eh
?
It
will
be
better
for
you
,
you
think
,
to
be
*NL*
a
business
man
,
to
be
brisk
and
smart
and
alive
?
''
She
*NL*
waited
and
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
shook
his
head
.
``
I
suppose
I
ca
n't
make
you
*NL*
understand
,
but
oh
,
I
wish
I
could
,
''
he
said
earnestly
.
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
even
talk
to
father
about
it
.
I
do
n't
try
.
*NL*
There
is
n't
any
use
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shall
do
.
I
*NL*
just
want
to
go
away
and
look
at
people
and
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
fell
upon
the
room
where
the
boy
and
woman
sat
*NL*
together
.
Again
,
as
on
the
other
evenings
,
they
were
*NL*
embarrassed
.
After
a
time
the
boy
tried
again
to
talk
.
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
wo
n't
be
for
a
year
or
two
but
I
've
been
*NL*
thinking
about
it
,
''
he
said
,
rising
and
going
toward
*NL*
the
door
.
``
Something
father
said
makes
it
sure
that
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
go
away
.
''
He
fumbled
with
the
doorknob
.
*NL*
In
the
room
the
silence
became
unbearable
to
the
woman
.
*NL*
She
wanted
to
cry
out
with
joy
because
of
the
words
*NL*
that
had
come
from
the
lips
of
her
son
,
but
the
*NL*
expression
of
joy
had
become
impossible
to
her
.
``
I
*NL*
think
you
had
better
go
out
among
the
boys
.
You
are
too
*NL*
much
indoors
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
thought
I
would
go
for
a
*NL*
little
walk
,
''
replied
the
son
stepping
awkwardly
out
of
*NL*
the
room
and
closing
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
PHILOSOPHER
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
was
a
large
man
with
a
drooping
mouth
*NL*
covered
by
a
yellow
mustache
.
He
always
wore
a
dirty
*NL*
white
waistcoat
out
of
the
pockets
of
which
protruded
a
*NL*
number
of
the
kind
of
black
cigars
known
as
stogies
.
*NL*
His
teeth
were
black
and
irregular
and
there
was
*NL*
something
strange
about
his
eyes
.
The
lid
of
the
left
*NL*
eye
twitched
;
it
fell
down
and
snapped
up
;
it
was
*NL*
exactly
as
though
the
lid
of
the
eye
were
a
window
*NL*
shade
and
someone
stood
inside
the
doctor
's
head
*NL*
playing
with
the
cord
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
had
a
liking
for
the
boy
,
George
*NL*
Willard
.
It
began
when
George
had
been
working
for
a
*NL*
year
on
the
Winesburg
Eagle
and
the
acquaintanceship
*NL*
was
entirely
a
matter
of
the
doctor
's
own
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
late
afternoon
Will
Henderson
,
owner
and
editor
*NL*
of
the
Eagle
,
went
over
to
Tom
Willy
's
saloon
.
Along
an
*NL*
alleyway
he
went
and
slipping
in
at
the
back
door
of
*NL*
the
saloon
began
drinking
a
drink
made
of
a
combination
*NL*
of
sloe
gin
and
soda
water
.
Will
Henderson
was
a
*NL*
sensualist
and
had
reached
the
age
of
forty-five
.
He
*NL*
imagined
the
gin
renewed
the
youth
in
him
.
Like
most
*NL*
sensualists
he
enjoyed
talking
of
women
,
and
for
an
*NL*
hour
he
lingered
about
gossiping
with
Tom
Willy
.
The
*NL*
saloon
keeper
was
a
short
,
broad-shouldered
man
with
*NL*
peculiarly
marked
hands
.
That
flaming
kind
of
birthmark
*NL*
that
sometimes
paints
with
red
the
faces
of
men
and
*NL*
women
had
touched
with
red
Tom
Willy
's
fingers
and
the
*NL*
backs
of
his
hands
.
As
he
stood
by
the
bar
talking
to
*NL*
Will
Henderson
he
rubbed
the
hands
together
.
As
he
grew
*NL*
more
and
more
excited
the
red
of
his
fingers
deepened
.
*NL*
It
was
as
though
the
hands
had
been
dipped
in
blood
*NL*
that
had
dried
and
faded
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Will
Henderson
stood
at
the
bar
looking
at
the
red
*NL*
hands
and
talking
of
women
,
his
assistant
,
George
*NL*
Willard
,
sat
in
the
office
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
and
*NL*
listened
to
the
talk
of
Doctor
Parcival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
appeared
immediately
after
Will
*NL*
Henderson
had
disappeared
.
One
might
have
supposed
that
*NL*
the
doctor
had
been
watching
from
his
office
window
and
*NL*
had
seen
the
editor
going
along
the
alleyway
.
Coming
in
*NL*
at
the
front
door
and
finding
himself
a
chair
,
he
*NL*
lighted
one
of
the
stogies
and
crossing
his
legs
began
*NL*
to
talk
.
He
seemed
intent
upon
convincing
the
boy
of
*NL*
the
advisability
of
adopting
a
line
of
conduct
that
he
*NL*
was
himself
unable
to
define
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
your
eyes
open
you
will
see
that
although
*NL*
I
call
myself
a
doctor
I
have
mighty
few
patients
,
''
he
*NL*
began
.
``
There
is
a
reason
for
that
.
It
is
not
an
*NL*
accident
and
it
is
not
because
I
do
not
know
as
much
of
*NL*
medicine
as
anyone
here
.
I
do
not
want
patients
.
The
*NL*
reason
,
you
see
,
does
not
appear
on
the
surface
.
It
*NL*
lies
in
fact
in
my
character
,
which
has
,
if
you
think
*NL*
about
it
,
many
strange
turns
.
Why
I
want
to
talk
to
you
*NL*
of
the
matter
I
do
n't
know
.
I
might
keep
still
and
get
*NL*
more
credit
in
your
eyes
.
I
have
a
desire
to
make
you
*NL*
admire
me
,
that
's
a
fact
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
That
's
why
*NL*
I
talk
.
It
's
very
amusing
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
the
doctor
launched
into
long
tales
*NL*
concerning
himself
.
To
the
boy
the
tales
were
very
real
*NL*
and
full
of
meaning
.
He
began
to
admire
the
fat
*NL*
unclean-looking
man
and
,
in
the
afternoon
when
Will
*NL*
Henderson
had
gone
,
looked
forward
with
keen
interest
*NL*
to
the
doctor
's
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
had
been
in
Winesburg
about
five
years
.
*NL*
He
came
from
Chicago
and
when
he
arrived
was
drunk
and
*NL*
got
into
a
fight
with
Albert
Longworth
,
the
baggageman
.
*NL*
The
fight
concerned
a
trunk
and
ended
by
the
doctor
's
*NL*
being
escorted
to
the
village
lockup
.
When
he
was
*NL*
released
he
rented
a
room
above
a
shoe-repairing
shop
*NL*
at
the
lower
end
of
Main
Street
and
put
out
the
sign
*NL*
that
announced
himself
as
a
doctor
.
Although
he
had
but
*NL*
few
patients
and
these
of
the
poorer
sort
who
were
*NL*
unable
to
pay
,
he
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
for
*NL*
his
needs
.
He
slept
in
the
office
that
was
unspeakably
*NL*
dirty
and
dined
at
Biff
Carter
's
lunch
room
in
a
small
*NL*
frame
building
opposite
the
railroad
station
.
In
the
*NL*
summer
the
lunch
room
was
filled
with
flies
and
Biff
*NL*
Carter
's
white
apron
was
more
dirty
than
his
floor
.
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
did
not
mind
.
Into
the
lunch
room
he
*NL*
stalked
and
deposited
twenty
cents
upon
the
counter
.
*NL*
``
Feed
me
what
you
wish
for
that
,
''
he
said
laughing
.
*NL*
``
Use
up
food
that
you
would
n't
otherwise
sell
.
It
makes
*NL*
no
difference
to
me
.
I
am
a
man
of
distinction
,
you
*NL*
see
.
Why
should
I
concern
myself
with
what
I
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tales
that
Doctor
Parcival
told
George
Willard
*NL*
began
nowhere
and
ended
nowhere
.
Sometimes
the
boy
*NL*
thought
they
must
all
be
inventions
,
a
pack
of
lies
.
*NL*
And
then
again
he
was
convinced
that
they
contained
the
*NL*
very
essence
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
a
reporter
like
you
here
,
''
Doctor
Parcival
*NL*
began
.
``
It
was
in
a
town
in
Iowa
--
or
was
it
in
*NL*
Illinois
?
I
do
n't
remember
and
anyway
it
makes
no
*NL*
difference
.
Perhaps
I
am
trying
to
conceal
my
identity
*NL*
and
do
n't
want
to
be
very
definite
.
Have
you
ever
*NL*
thought
it
strange
that
I
have
money
for
my
needs
*NL*
although
I
do
nothing
?
I
may
have
stolen
a
great
sum
of
*NL*
money
or
been
involved
in
a
murder
before
I
came
here
.
*NL*
There
is
food
for
thought
in
that
,
eh
?
If
you
were
a
*NL*
really
smart
newspaper
reporter
you
would
look
me
up
.
*NL*
In
Chicago
there
was
a
Doctor
Cronin
who
was
murdered
.
*NL*
Have
you
heard
of
that
?
Some
men
murdered
him
and
put
*NL*
him
in
a
trunk
.
In
the
early
morning
they
hauled
the
*NL*
trunk
across
the
city
.
It
sat
on
the
back
of
an
express
*NL*
wagon
and
they
were
on
the
seat
as
unconcerned
as
*NL*
anything
.
Along
they
went
through
quiet
streets
where
*NL*
everyone
was
asleep
.
The
sun
was
just
coming
up
over
*NL*
the
lake
.
Funny
,
eh
--
just
to
think
of
them
smoking
*NL*
pipes
and
chattering
as
they
drove
along
as
unconcerned
*NL*
as
I
am
now
.
Perhaps
I
was
one
of
those
men
.
That
would
*NL*
be
a
strange
turn
of
things
,
now
would
n't
it
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
Again
Doctor
Parcival
began
his
tale
:
``
Well
,
anyway
*NL*
there
I
was
,
a
reporter
on
a
paper
just
as
you
are
*NL*
here
,
running
about
and
getting
little
items
to
print
.
*NL*
My
mother
was
poor
.
She
took
in
washing
.
Her
dream
was
*NL*
to
make
me
a
Presbyterian
minister
and
I
was
studying
*NL*
with
that
end
in
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
had
been
insane
for
a
number
of
years
.
He
*NL*
was
in
an
asylum
over
at
Dayton
,
Ohio
.
There
you
see
I
*NL*
have
let
it
slip
out
!
All
of
this
took
place
in
Ohio
,
*NL*
right
here
in
Ohio
.
There
is
a
clew
if
you
ever
get
the
*NL*
notion
of
looking
me
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
tell
you
of
my
brother
.
That
's
the
*NL*
object
of
all
this
.
That
's
what
I
'm
getting
at
.
My
*NL*
brother
was
a
railroad
painter
and
had
a
job
on
the
Big
*NL*
Four
.
You
know
that
road
runs
through
Ohio
here
.
With
*NL*
other
men
he
lived
in
a
box
car
and
away
they
went
from
*NL*
town
to
town
painting
the
railroad
property-switches
,
*NL*
crossing
gates
,
bridges
,
and
stations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Big
Four
paints
its
stations
a
nasty
orange
color
.
*NL*
How
I
hated
that
color
!
My
brother
was
always
covered
*NL*
with
it
.
On
pay
days
he
used
to
get
drunk
and
come
home
*NL*
wearing
his
paint-covered
clothes
and
bringing
his
*NL*
money
with
him
.
He
did
not
give
it
to
mother
but
laid
*NL*
it
in
a
pile
on
our
kitchen
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
house
he
went
in
the
clothes
covered
with
*NL*
the
nasty
orange
colored
paint
.
I
can
see
the
picture
.
*NL*
My
mother
,
who
was
small
and
had
red
,
sad-looking
eyes
,
*NL*
would
come
into
the
house
from
a
little
shed
at
the
*NL*
back
.
That
's
where
she
spent
her
time
over
the
washtub
*NL*
scrubbing
people
's
dirty
clothes
.
In
she
would
come
and
*NL*
stand
by
the
table
,
rubbing
her
eyes
with
her
apron
*NL*
that
was
covered
with
soap-suds
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
n't
touch
it
!
Do
n't
you
dare
touch
that
money
,
'
my
*NL*
brother
roared
,
and
then
he
himself
took
five
or
ten
*NL*
dollars
and
went
tramping
off
to
the
saloons
.
When
he
*NL*
had
spent
what
he
had
taken
he
came
back
for
more
.
He
*NL*
never
gave
my
mother
any
money
at
all
but
stayed
about
*NL*
until
he
had
spent
it
all
,
a
little
at
a
time
.
Then
he
*NL*
went
back
to
his
job
with
the
painting
crew
on
the
*NL*
railroad
.
After
he
had
gone
things
began
to
arrive
at
*NL*
our
house
,
groceries
and
such
things
.
Sometimes
there
*NL*
would
be
a
dress
for
mother
or
a
pair
of
shoes
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
,
eh
?
My
mother
loved
my
brother
much
more
than
*NL*
she
did
me
,
although
he
never
said
a
kind
word
to
*NL*
either
of
us
and
always
raved
up
and
down
threatening
*NL*
us
if
we
dared
so
much
as
touch
the
money
that
*NL*
sometimes
lay
on
the
table
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
got
along
pretty
well
.
I
studied
to
be
a
minister
*NL*
and
prayed
.
I
was
a
regular
ass
about
saying
prayers
.
*NL*
You
should
have
heard
me
.
When
my
father
died
I
prayed
*NL*
all
night
,
just
as
I
did
sometimes
when
my
brother
was
*NL*
in
town
drinking
and
going
about
buying
the
things
for
*NL*
us
.
In
the
evening
after
supper
I
knelt
by
the
table
*NL*
where
the
money
lay
and
prayed
for
hours
.
When
no
one
*NL*
was
looking
I
stole
a
dollar
or
two
and
put
it
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
That
makes
me
laugh
now
but
then
it
was
*NL*
terrible
.
It
was
on
my
mind
all
the
time
.
I
got
six
*NL*
dollars
a
week
from
my
job
on
the
paper
and
always
took
*NL*
it
straight
home
to
mother
.
The
few
dollars
I
stole
*NL*
from
my
brother
's
pile
I
spent
on
myself
,
you
know
,
for
*NL*
trifles
,
candy
and
cigarettes
and
such
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
father
died
at
the
asylum
over
at
Dayton
,
I
*NL*
went
over
there
.
I
borrowed
some
money
from
the
man
for
*NL*
whom
I
worked
and
went
on
the
train
at
night
.
It
was
*NL*
raining
.
In
the
asylum
they
treated
me
as
though
I
were
*NL*
a
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
men
who
had
jobs
in
the
asylum
had
found
out
I
was
*NL*
a
newspaper
reporter
.
That
made
them
afraid
.
There
had
*NL*
been
some
negligence
,
some
carelessness
,
you
see
,
when
*NL*
father
was
ill
.
They
thought
perhaps
I
would
write
it
*NL*
up
in
the
paper
and
make
a
fuss
.
I
never
intended
to
do
*NL*
anything
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
in
I
went
to
the
room
where
my
father
lay
dead
*NL*
and
blessed
the
dead
body
.
I
wonder
what
put
that
*NL*
notion
into
my
head
.
Would
n't
my
brother
,
the
painter
,
*NL*
have
laughed
,
though
.
There
I
stood
over
the
dead
body
*NL*
and
spread
out
my
hands
.
The
superintendent
of
the
*NL*
asylum
and
some
of
his
helpers
came
in
and
stood
about
*NL*
looking
sheepish
.
It
was
very
amusing
.
I
spread
out
my
*NL*
hands
and
said
,
`
Let
peace
brood
over
this
carcass
.
'
*NL*
That
's
what
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jumping
to
his
feet
and
breaking
off
the
tale
,
Doctor
*NL*
Parcival
began
to
walk
up
and
down
in
the
office
of
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
where
George
Willard
sat
listening
.
He
*NL*
was
awkward
and
,
as
the
office
was
small
,
continually
*NL*
knocked
against
things
.
``
What
a
fool
I
am
to
be
*NL*
talking
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
is
not
my
object
in
coming
*NL*
here
and
forcing
my
acquaintanceship
upon
you
.
I
have
*NL*
something
else
in
mind
.
You
are
a
reporter
just
as
I
*NL*
was
once
and
you
have
attracted
my
attention
.
You
may
*NL*
end
by
becoming
just
such
another
fool
.
I
want
to
warn
*NL*
you
and
keep
on
warning
you
.
That
's
why
I
seek
you
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
began
talking
of
George
Willard
's
*NL*
attitude
toward
men
.
It
seemed
to
the
boy
that
the
man
*NL*
had
but
one
object
in
view
,
to
make
everyone
seem
*NL*
despicable
.
``
I
want
to
fill
you
with
hatred
and
*NL*
contempt
so
that
you
will
be
a
superior
being
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
.
``
Look
at
my
brother
.
There
was
a
fellow
,
eh
?
*NL*
He
despised
everyone
,
you
see
.
You
have
no
idea
with
*NL*
what
contempt
he
looked
upon
mother
and
me
.
And
was
he
*NL*
not
our
superior
?
You
know
he
was
.
You
have
not
seen
*NL*
him
and
yet
I
have
made
you
feel
that
.
I
have
given
you
*NL*
a
sense
of
it
.
He
is
dead
.
Once
when
he
was
drunk
he
*NL*
lay
down
on
the
tracks
and
the
car
in
which
he
lived
*NL*
with
the
other
painters
ran
over
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
August
Doctor
Parcival
had
an
adventure
in
*NL*
Winesburg
.
For
a
month
George
Willard
had
been
going
*NL*
each
morning
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
doctor
's
office
.
*NL*
The
visits
came
about
through
a
desire
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
doctor
to
read
to
the
boy
from
the
pages
of
a
book
*NL*
he
was
in
the
process
of
writing
.
To
write
the
book
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
declared
was
the
object
of
his
coming
*NL*
to
Winesburg
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
in
August
before
the
coming
of
the
boy
,
*NL*
an
incident
had
happened
in
the
doctor
's
office
.
There
*NL*
had
been
an
accident
on
Main
Street
.
A
team
of
horses
*NL*
had
been
frightened
by
a
train
and
had
run
away
.
A
*NL*
little
girl
,
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
,
had
been
thrown
*NL*
from
a
buggy
and
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Main
Street
everyone
had
become
excited
and
a
cry
*NL*
for
doctors
had
gone
up
.
All
three
of
the
active
*NL*
practitioners
of
the
town
had
come
quickly
but
had
*NL*
found
the
child
dead
.
From
the
crowd
someone
had
run
to
*NL*
the
office
of
Doctor
Parcival
who
had
bluntly
refused
*NL*
to
go
down
out
of
his
office
to
the
dead
child
.
The
*NL*
useless
cruelty
of
his
refusal
had
passed
unnoticed
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
man
who
had
come
up
the
stairway
to
summon
*NL*
him
had
hurried
away
without
hearing
the
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
this
,
Doctor
Parcival
did
not
know
and
when
*NL*
George
Willard
came
to
his
office
he
found
the
man
*NL*
shaking
with
terror
.
``
What
I
have
done
will
arouse
the
*NL*
people
of
this
town
,
''
he
declared
excitedly
.
``
Do
I
not
*NL*
know
human
nature
?
Do
I
not
know
what
will
happen
?
Word
*NL*
of
my
refusal
will
be
whispered
about
.
Presently
men
*NL*
will
get
together
in
groups
and
talk
of
it
.
They
will
*NL*
come
here
.
We
will
quarrel
and
there
will
be
talk
of
*NL*
hanging
.
Then
they
will
come
again
bearing
a
rope
in
*NL*
their
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
shook
with
fright
.
``
I
have
a
*NL*
presentiment
,
''
he
declared
emphatically
.
``
It
may
be
*NL*
that
what
I
am
talking
about
will
not
occur
this
*NL*
morning
.
It
may
be
put
off
until
tonight
but
I
will
be
*NL*
hanged
.
Everyone
will
get
excited
.
I
will
be
hanged
to
*NL*
a
lamp-post
on
Main
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Going
to
the
door
of
his
dirty
office
,
Doctor
Parcival
*NL*
looked
timidly
down
the
stairway
leading
to
the
street
.
*NL*
When
he
returned
the
fright
that
had
been
in
his
eyes
*NL*
was
beginning
to
be
replaced
by
doubt
.
Coming
on
tiptoe
*NL*
across
the
room
he
tapped
George
Willard
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
If
not
now
,
sometime
,
''
he
whispered
,
shaking
*NL*
his
head
.
``
In
the
end
I
will
be
crucified
,
uselessly
*NL*
crucified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Parcival
began
to
plead
with
George
Willard
.
*NL*
``
You
must
pay
attention
to
me
,
''
he
urged
.
``
If
something
*NL*
happens
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
write
the
book
that
*NL*
I
may
never
get

The
idea
is
very
simple

so
*NL*
simple
that
if
you
are
not
careful
you
will
forget
it

It
is
this

that
everyone

they

all
crucified

That

what

Do

Whatever

do

you
dare
*NL*

Looking
cautiously
about
,
George
Willard
arose
from
his
*NL*
desk
in
the
office
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
and
went
*NL*
hurriedly
out
at
the
back
door
.
The
night
was
warm
and
*NL*
cloudy
and
although
it
was
not
yet
eight
o'clock
,
the
*NL*
alleyway
back
of
the
Eagle
office
was
pitch
dark
.
A
*NL*
team
of
horses
tied
to
a
post
somewhere
in
the
darkness
*NL*
stamped
on
the
hard-baked
ground
.
A
cat
sprang
from
*NL*
under
George
Willard
's
feet
and
ran
away
into
the
*NL*
night
.
The
young
man
was
nervous
.
All
day
he
had
gone
*NL*
about
his
work
like
one
dazed
by
a
blow
.
In
the
*NL*
alleyway
he
trembled
as
though
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
George
Willard
walked
along
the
*NL*
alleyway
,
going
carefully
and
cautiously
.
The
back
*NL*
doors
of
the
Winesburg
stores
were
open
and
he
could
*NL*
see
men
sitting
about
under
the
store
lamps
.
In
*NL*
Myerbaum
's
Notion
Store
Mrs.
Willy
the
saloon
keeper
's
*NL*
wife
stood
by
the
counter
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
.
Sid
*NL*
Green
the
clerk
was
waiting
on
her
.
He
leaned
over
the
*NL*
counter
and
talked
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
crouched
and
then
jumped
through
the
*NL*
path
of
light
that
came
out
at
the
door
.
He
began
to
*NL*
run
forward
in
the
darkness
.
Behind
Ed
Griffith
's
*NL*
saloon
old
Jerry
Bird
the
town
drunkard
lay
asleep
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
runner
stumbled
over
the
sprawling
*NL*
legs
.
He
laughed
brokenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
had
set
forth
upon
an
adventure
.
All
day
*NL*
he
had
been
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
go
through
*NL*
with
the
adventure
and
now
he
was
acting
.
In
the
office
*NL*
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
he
had
been
sitting
since
six
*NL*
o'clock
trying
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
no
decision
.
He
had
just
jumped
to
his
*NL*
feet
,
hurried
past
Will
Henderson
who
was
reading
proof
*NL*
in
the
printshop
and
started
to
run
along
the
alleyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
street
after
street
went
George
Willard
,
*NL*
avoiding
the
people
who
passed
.
He
crossed
and
*NL*
recrossed
the
road
.
When
he
passed
a
street
lamp
he
*NL*
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
face
.
He
did
not
dare
*NL*
think
.
In
his
mind
there
was
a
fear
but
it
was
a
new
*NL*
kind
of
fear
.
He
was
afraid
the
adventure
on
which
he
*NL*
had
set
out
would
be
spoiled
,
that
he
would
lose
*NL*
courage
and
turn
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
found
Louise
Trunnion
in
the
kitchen
of
*NL*
her
father
's
house
.
She
was
washing
dishes
by
the
light
*NL*
of
a
kerosene
lamp
.
There
she
stood
behind
the
screen
*NL*
door
in
the
little
shedlike
kitchen
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
house
.
George
Willard
stopped
by
a
picket
fence
and
*NL*
tried
to
control
the
shaking
of
his
body
.
Only
a
narrow
*NL*
potato
patch
separated
him
from
the
adventure
.
Five
*NL*
minutes
passed
before
he
felt
sure
enough
of
himself
to
*NL*
call
to
her
.
``
Louise
!
Oh
,
Louise
!
''
he
called
.
The
cry
*NL*
stuck
in
his
throat
.
His
voice
became
a
hoarse
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
Trunnion
came
out
across
the
potato
patch
*NL*
holding
the
dish
cloth
in
her
hand
.
``
How
do
you
know
I
*NL*
want
to
go
out
with
you
,
''
she
said
sulkily
.
``
What
makes
*NL*
you
so
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
did
not
answer
.
In
silence
the
two
*NL*
stood
in
the
darkness
with
the
fence
between
them
.
``
You
*NL*
go
on
along
,
''
she
said
.
``
Pa
's
in
there
.
I
'll
come
*NL*
along
.
You
wait
by
Williams

barn

*NL*
The
young
newspaper
reporter
had
received
a
letter
from
*NL*
Louise
Trunnion
.
It
had
come
that
morning
to
the
office
*NL*
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
.
The
letter
was
brief
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
yours
if
you
want
me
,
''
it
said
.
He
thought
it
annoying
*NL*
that
in
the
darkness
by
the
fence
she
had
pretended
*NL*
there
was
nothing
between
them
.
``
She
has
a
nerve
!
Well
,
*NL*
gracious
sakes
,
she
has
a
nerve
,
''
he
muttered
as
he
*NL*
went
along
the
street
and
passed
a
row
of
vacant
lots
*NL*
where
corn
grew
.
The
corn
was
shoulder
high
and
had
*NL*
been
planted
right
down
to
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Louise
Trunnion
came
out
of
the
front
door
of
her
*NL*
house
she
still
wore
the
gingham
dress
in
which
she
had
*NL*
been
washing
dishes
.
There
was
no
hat
on
her
head
.
The
*NL*
boy
could
see
her
standing
with
the
doorknob
in
her
*NL*
hand
talking
to
someone
within
,
no
doubt
to
old
Jake
*NL*
Trunnion
,
her
father
.
Old
Jake
was
half
deaf
and
she
*NL*
shouted
.
The
door
closed
and
everything
was
dark
and
*NL*
silent
in
the
little
side
street
.
George
Willard
*NL*
trembled
more
violently
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
shadows
by
Williams
'
barn
George
and
Louise
*NL*
stood
,
not
daring
to
talk
.
She
was
not
particularly
*NL*
comely
and
there
was
a
black
smudge
on
the
side
of
her
*NL*
nose
.
George
thought
she
must
have
rubbed
her
nose
with
*NL*
her
finger
after
she
had
been
handling
some
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
began
to
laugh
nervously
.
``
It
's
warm
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
He
wanted
to
touch
her
with
his
hand
.
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
very
bold
,
''
he
thought
.
Just
to
touch
the
folds
of
the
*NL*
soiled
gingham
dress
would
,
he
decided
,
be
an
exquisite
*NL*
pleasure
.
She
began
to
quibble
.
``
You
think
you
're
*NL*
better
than
I
am
.
Do
n't
tell
me
,
I
guess
I
know
,
''
she
*NL*
said
drawing
closer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flood
of
words
burst
from
George
Willard
.
He
*NL*
remembered
the
look
that
had
lurked
in
the
girl
's
eyes
*NL*
when
they
had
met
on
the
streets
and
thought
of
the
*NL*
note
she
had
written
.
Doubt
left
him
.
The
whispered
*NL*
tales
concerning
her
that
had
gone
about
town
gave
him
*NL*
confidence
.
He
became
wholly
the
male
,
bold
and
*NL*
aggressive
.
In
his
heart
there
was
no
sympathy
for
her
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
on
,
it
'll
be
all
right
.
There
wo
n't
be
anyone
*NL*
know
anything
.
How
can
they
know
?
''
he
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
walk
along
a
narrow
brick
sidewalk
*NL*
between
the
cracks
of
which
tall
weeds
grew
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
bricks
were
missing
and
the
sidewalk
was
rough
and
*NL*
irregular
.
He
took
hold
of
her
hand
that
was
also
rough
*NL*
and
thought
it
delightfully
small
.
``
I
ca
n't
go
far
,
''
*NL*
she
said
and
her
voice
was
quiet
,
unperturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
a
bridge
that
ran
over
a
tiny
stream
and
*NL*
passed
another
vacant
lot
in
which
corn
grew
.
The
*NL*
street
ended
.
In
the
path
at
the
side
of
the
road
they
*NL*
were
compelled
to
walk
one
behind
the
other
.
Will
*NL*
Overton
's
berry
field
lay
beside
the
road
and
there
was
*NL*
a
pile
of
boards
.
``
Will
is
going
to
build
a
shed
to
*NL*
store
berry
crates
here
,
''
said
George
and
they
sat
down
*NL*
upon
the
boards
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
When
George
Willard
got
back
into
Main
Street
it
was
*NL*
past
ten
o'clock
and
had
begun
to
rain
.
Three
times
he
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
the
length
of
Main
Street
.
Sylvester
*NL*
West
's
Drug
Store
was
still
open
and
he
went
in
and
*NL*
bought
a
cigar
.
When
Shorty
Crandall
the
clerk
came
out
*NL*
at
the
door
with
him
he
was
pleased
.
For
five
minutes
*NL*
the
two
stood
in
the
shelter
of
the
store
awning
and
*NL*
talked
.
George
Willard
felt
satisfied
.
He
had
wanted
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
to
talk
to
some
man
.
Around
a
*NL*
corner
toward
the
New
Willard
House
he
went
whistling
*NL*
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sidewalk
at
the
side
of
Winney
's
Dry
Goods
Store
*NL*
where
there
was
a
high
board
fence
covered
with
circus
*NL*
pictures
,
he
stopped
whistling
and
stood
perfectly
*NL*
still
in
the
darkness
,
attentive
,
listening
as
though
*NL*
for
a
voice
calling
his
name
.
Then
again
he
laughed
*NL*
nervously
.
``
She
has
n't
got
anything
on
me
.
Nobody
*NL*
knows
,
''
he
muttered
doggedly
and
went
on
his
way
.

GODLINESS
*NL*
*NL*
A
Tale
in
Four
Parts
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
always
three
or
four
old
people
sitting
on
*NL*
the
front
porch
of
the
house
or
puttering
about
the
*NL*
garden
of
the
Bentley
farm
.
Three
of
the
old
people
*NL*
were
women
and
sisters
to
Jesse
.
They
were
a
colorless
,
*NL*
soft
voiced
lot
.
Then
there
was
a
silent
old
man
with
*NL*
thin
white
hair
who
was
Jesse
's
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmhouse
was
built
of
wood
,
a
board
outer-covering
*NL*
over
a
framework
of
logs
.
It
was
in
reality
not
one
*NL*
house
but
a
cluster
of
houses
joined
together
in
a
*NL*
rather
haphazard
manner
.
Inside
,
the
place
was
full
of
*NL*
surprises
.
One
went
up
steps
from
the
living
room
into
*NL*
the
dining
room
and
there
were
always
steps
to
be
*NL*
ascended
or
descended
in
passing
from
one
room
to
*NL*
another
.
At
meal
times
the
place
was
like
a
beehive
.
At
*NL*
one
moment
all
was
quiet
,
then
doors
began
to
open
,
*NL*
feet
clattered
on
stairs
,
a
murmur
of
soft
voices
arose
*NL*
and
people
appeared
from
a
dozen
obscure
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
old
people
,
already
mentioned
,
many
others
*NL*
lived
in
the
Bentley
house
.
There
were
four
hired
men
,
*NL*
a
woman
named
Aunt
Callie
Beebe
,
who
was
in
charge
of
*NL*
the
housekeeping
,
a
dull-witted
girl
named
Eliza
*NL*
Stoughton
,
who
made
beds
and
helped
with
the
milking
,
a
*NL*
boy
who
worked
in
the
stables
,
and
Jesse
Bentley
*NL*
himself
,
the
owner
and
overlord
of
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
the
American
Civil
War
had
been
over
for
*NL*
twenty
years
,
that
part
of
Northern
Ohio
where
the
*NL*
Bentley
farms
lay
had
begun
to
emerge
from
pioneer
*NL*
life
.
Jesse
then
owned
machinery
for
harvesting
grain
.
*NL*
He
had
built
modern
barns
and
most
of
his
land
was
*NL*
drained
with
carefully
laid
tile
drain
,
but
in
order
to
*NL*
understand
the
man
we
will
have
to
go
back
to
an
*NL*
earlier
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bentley
family
had
been
in
Northern
Ohio
for
*NL*
several
generations
before
Jesse
's
time
.
They
came
from
*NL*
New
York
State
and
took
up
land
when
the
country
was
*NL*
new
and
land
could
be
had
at
a
low
price
.
For
a
long
*NL*
time
they
,
in
common
with
all
the
other
Middle
Western
*NL*
people
,
were
very
poor
.
The
land
they
had
settled
upon
*NL*
was
heavily
wooded
and
covered
with
fallen
logs
and
*NL*
underbrush
.
After
the
long
hard
labor
of
clearing
these
*NL*
away
and
cutting
the
timber
,
there
were
still
the
*NL*
stumps
to
be
reckoned
with
.
Plows
run
through
the
*NL*
fields
caught
on
hidden
roots
,
stones
lay
all
about
,
on
*NL*
the
low
places
water
gathered
,
and
the
young
corn
*NL*
turned
yellow
,
sickened
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jesse
Bentley
's
father
and
brothers
had
come
into
*NL*
their
ownership
of
the
place
,
much
of
the
harder
part
*NL*
of
the
work
of
clearing
had
been
done
,
but
they
clung
*NL*
to
old
traditions
and
worked
like
driven
animals
.
They
*NL*
lived
as
practically
all
of
the
farming
people
of
the
*NL*
time
lived
.
In
the
spring
and
through
most
of
the
*NL*
winter
the
highways
leading
into
the
town
of
Winesburg
*NL*
were
a
sea
of
mud
.
The
four
young
men
of
the
family
*NL*
worked
hard
all
day
in
the
fields
,
they
ate
heavily
of
*NL*
coarse
,
greasy
food
,
and
at
night
slept
like
tired
*NL*
beasts
on
beds
of
straw
.
Into
their
lives
came
little
*NL*
that
was
not
coarse
and
brutal
and
outwardly
they
were
*NL*
themselves
coarse
and
brutal
.
On
Saturday
afternoons
*NL*
they
hitched
a
team
of
horses
to
a
three-seated
wagon
*NL*
and
went
off
to
town
.
In
town
they
stood
about
the
*NL*
stoves
in
the
stores
talking
to
other
farmers
or
to
the
*NL*
store
keepers
.
They
were
dressed
in
overalls
and
in
the
*NL*
winter
wore
heavy
coats
that
were
flecked
with
mud
.
*NL*
Their
hands
as
they
stretched
them
out
to
the
heat
of
*NL*
the
stoves
were
cracked
and
red
.
It
was
difficult
for
*NL*
them
to
talk
and
so
they
for
the
most
part
kept
silent
.
*NL*
When
they
had
bought
meat
,
flour
,
sugar
,
and
salt
,
they
*NL*
went
into
one
of
the
Winesburg
saloons
and
drank
beer
.
*NL*
Under
the
influence
of
drink
the
naturally
strong
lusts
*NL*
of
their
natures
,
kept
suppressed
by
the
heroic
labor
*NL*
of
breaking
up
new
ground
,
were
released
.
A
kind
of
*NL*
crude
and
animal-like
poetic
fervor
took
possession
of
*NL*
them
.
On
the
road
home
they
stood
up
on
the
wagon
seats
*NL*
and
shouted
at
the
stars
.
Sometimes
they
fought
long
*NL*
and
bitterly
and
at
other
times
they
broke
forth
into
*NL*
songs
.
Once
Enoch
Bentley
,
the
older
one
of
the
boys
,
*NL*
struck
his
father
,
old
Tom
Bentley
,
with
the
butt
of
a
*NL*
teamster
's
whip
,
and
the
old
man
seemed
likely
to
die
.
*NL*
For
days
Enoch
lay
hid
in
the
straw
in
the
loft
of
the
*NL*
stable
ready
to
flee
if
the
result
of
his
momentary
*NL*
passion
turned
out
to
be
murder
.
He
was
kept
alive
with
*NL*
food
brought
by
his
mother
,
who
also
kept
him
informed
*NL*
of
the
injured
man
's
condition
.
When
all
turned
out
*NL*
well
he
emerged
from
his
hiding
place
and
went
back
to
*NL*
the
work
of
clearing
land
as
though
nothing
had
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Civil
War
brought
a
sharp
turn
to
the
fortunes
of
*NL*
the
Bentleys
and
was
responsible
for
the
rise
of
the
*NL*
youngest
son
,
Jesse
.
Enoch
,
Edward
,
Harry
,
and
Will
*NL*
Bentley
all
enlisted
and
before
the
long
war
ended
they
*NL*
were
all
killed
.
For
a
time
after
they
went
away
to
the
*NL*
South
,
old
Tom
tried
to
run
the
place
,
but
he
was
not
*NL*
successful
.
When
the
last
of
the
four
had
been
killed
*NL*
he
sent
word
to
Jesse
that
he
would
have
to
come
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
mother
,
who
had
not
been
well
for
a
year
,
died
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
the
father
became
altogether
discouraged
.
*NL*
He
talked
of
selling
the
farm
and
moving
into
town
.
All
*NL*
day
he
went
about
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
.
The
*NL*
work
in
the
fields
was
neglected
and
weeds
grew
high
in
*NL*
the
corn
.
Old
Tom
hired
men
but
he
did
not
use
them
*NL*
intelligently
.
When
they
had
gone
away
to
the
fields
in
*NL*
the
morning
he
wandered
into
the
woods
and
sat
down
on
*NL*
a
log
.
Sometimes
he
forgot
to
come
home
at
night
and
*NL*
one
of
the
daughters
had
to
go
in
search
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jesse
Bentley
came
home
to
the
farm
and
began
to
*NL*
take
charge
of
things
he
was
a
slight
,
*NL*
sensitive-looking
man
of
twenty-two
.
At
eighteen
he
*NL*
had
left
home
to
go
to
school
to
become
a
scholar
and
*NL*
eventually
to
become
a
minister
of
the
Presbyterian
*NL*
Church
.
All
through
his
boyhood
he
had
been
what
in
our
*NL*
country
was
called
an
``
odd
sheep
''
and
had
not
got
on
*NL*
with
his
brothers
.
Of
all
the
family
only
his
mother
*NL*
had
understood
him
and
she
was
now
dead
.
When
he
came
*NL*
home
to
take
charge
of
the
farm
,
that
had
at
that
time
*NL*
grown
to
more
than
six
hundred
acres
,
everyone
on
the
*NL*
farms
about
and
in
the
nearby
town
of
Winesburg
smiled
*NL*
at
the
idea
of
his
trying
to
handle
the
work
that
had
*NL*
been
done
by
his
four
strong
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
indeed
good
cause
to
smile
.
By
the
standards
*NL*
of
his
day
Jesse
did
not
look
like
a
man
at
all
.
He
was
*NL*
small
and
very
slender
and
womanish
of
body
and
,
true
*NL*
to
the
traditions
of
young
ministers
,
wore
a
long
black
*NL*
coat
and
a
narrow
black
string
tie
.
The
neighbors
were
*NL*
amused
when
they
saw
him
,
after
the
years
away
,
and
*NL*
they
were
even
more
amused
when
they
saw
the
woman
he
*NL*
had
married
in
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
Jesse
's
wife
did
soon
go
under
.
*NL*
That
was
perhaps
Jesse
's
fault
.
A
farm
in
Northern
Ohio
*NL*
in
the
hard
years
after
the
Civil
War
was
no
place
for
*NL*
a
delicate
woman
,
and
Katherine
Bentley
was
delicate
.
*NL*
Jesse
was
hard
with
her
as
he
was
with
everybody
about
*NL*
him
in
those
days
.
She
tried
to
do
such
work
as
all
the
*NL*
neighbor
women
about
her
did
and
he
let
her
go
on
*NL*
without
interference
.
She
helped
to
do
the
milking
and
*NL*
did
part
of
the
housework
;
she
made
the
beds
for
the
*NL*
men
and
prepared
their
food
.
For
a
year
she
worked
*NL*
every
day
from
sunrise
until
late
at
night
and
then
*NL*
after
giving
birth
to
a
child
she
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jesse
Bentley
--
although
he
was
a
delicately
*NL*
built
man
there
was
something
within
him
that
could
not
*NL*
easily
be
killed
.
He
had
brown
curly
hair
and
grey
eyes
*NL*
that
were
at
times
hard
and
direct
,
at
times
wavering
*NL*
and
uncertain
.
Not
only
was
he
slender
but
he
was
also
*NL*
short
of
stature
.
His
mouth
was
like
the
mouth
of
a
*NL*
sensitive
and
very
determined
child
.
Jesse
Bentley
was
*NL*
a
fanatic
.
He
was
a
man
born
out
of
his
time
and
place
*NL*
and
for
this
he
suffered
and
made
others
suffer
.
Never
*NL*
did
he
succeed
in
getting
what
he
wanted
out
of
life
*NL*
and
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
.
Within
a
very
short
*NL*
time
after
he
came
home
to
the
Bentley
farm
he
made
*NL*
everyone
there
a
little
afraid
of
him
,
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
should
have
been
close
to
him
as
his
mother
had
*NL*
been
,
was
afraid
also
.
At
the
end
of
two
weeks
after
*NL*
his
coming
,
old
Tom
Bentley
made
over
to
him
the
entire
*NL*
ownership
of
the
place
and
retired
into
the
background
.
*NL*
Everyone
retired
into
the
background
.
In
spite
of
his
*NL*
youth
and
inexperience
,
Jesse
had
the
trick
of
*NL*
mastering
the
souls
of
his
people
.
He
was
so
in
earnest
*NL*
in
everything
he
did
and
said
that
no
one
understood
*NL*
him
.
He
made
everyone
on
the
farm
work
as
they
had
*NL*
never
worked
before
and
yet
there
was
no
joy
in
the
*NL*
work
.
If
things
went
well
they
went
well
for
Jesse
and
*NL*
never
for
the
people
who
were
his
dependents
.
Like
a
*NL*
thousand
other
strong
men
who
have
come
into
the
world
*NL*
here
in
America
in
these
later
times
,
Jesse
was
but
*NL*
half
strong
.
He
could
master
others
but
he
could
not
*NL*
master
himself
.
The
running
of
the
farm
as
it
had
never
*NL*
been
run
before
was
easy
for
him
.
When
he
came
home
*NL*
from
Cleveland
where
he
had
been
in
school
,
he
shut
*NL*
himself
off
from
all
of
his
people
and
began
to
make
*NL*
plans
.
He
thought
about
the
farm
night
and
day
and
that
*NL*
made
him
successful
.
Other
men
on
the
farms
about
him
*NL*
worked
too
hard
and
were
too
fired
to
think
,
but
to
*NL*
think
of
the
farm
and
to
be
everlastingly
making
plans
*NL*
for
its
success
was
a
relief
to
Jesse
.
It
partially
*NL*
satisfied
something
in
his
passionate
nature
.
*NL*
Immediately
after
he
came
home
he
had
a
wing
built
on
*NL*
to
the
old
house
and
in
a
large
room
facing
the
west
he
*NL*
had
windows
that
looked
into
the
barnyard
and
other
*NL*
windows
that
looked
off
across
the
fields
.
By
the
*NL*
window
he
sat
down
to
think
.
Hour
after
hour
and
day
*NL*
after
day
he
sat
and
looked
over
the
land
and
thought
*NL*
out
his
new
place
in
life
.
The
passionate
burning
thing
*NL*
in
his
nature
flamed
up
and
his
eyes
became
hard
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
make
the
farm
produce
as
no
farm
in
his
state
*NL*
had
ever
produced
before
and
then
he
wanted
something
*NL*
else
.
It
was
the
indefinable
hunger
within
that
made
*NL*
his
eyes
waver
and
that
kept
him
always
more
and
more
*NL*
silent
before
people
.
He
would
have
given
much
to
*NL*
achieve
peace
and
in
him
was
a
fear
that
peace
was
the
*NL*
thing
he
could
not
achieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
over
his
body
Jesse
Bentley
was
alive
.
In
his
*NL*
small
frame
was
gathered
the
force
of
a
long
line
of
*NL*
strong
men
.
He
had
always
been
extraordinarily
alive
*NL*
when
he
was
a
small
boy
on
the
farm
and
later
when
he
*NL*
was
a
young
man
in
school
.
In
the
school
he
had
studied
*NL*
and
thought
of
God
and
the
Bible
with
his
whole
mind
*NL*
and
heart
.
As
time
passed
and
he
grew
to
know
people
*NL*
better
,
he
began
to
think
of
himself
as
an
*NL*
extraordinary
man
,
one
set
apart
from
his
fellows
.
He
*NL*
wanted
terribly
to
make
his
life
a
thing
of
great
*NL*
importance
,
and
as
he
looked
about
at
his
fellow
men
*NL*
and
saw
how
like
clods
they
lived
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
he
could
not
bear
to
become
also
such
a
clod
.
Although
*NL*
in
his
absorption
in
himself
and
in
his
own
destiny
he
*NL*
was
blind
to
the
fact
that
his
young
wife
was
doing
a
*NL*
strong
woman
's
work
even
after
she
had
become
large
*NL*
with
child
and
that
she
was
killing
herself
in
his
*NL*
service
,
he
did
not
intend
to
be
unkind
to
her
.
When
*NL*
his
father
,
who
was
old
and
twisted
with
toil
,
made
*NL*
over
to
him
the
ownership
of
the
farm
and
seemed
*NL*
content
to
creep
away
to
a
corner
and
wait
for
death
,
*NL*
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
dismissed
the
old
man
*NL*
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
room
by
the
window
overlooking
the
land
that
had
*NL*
come
down
to
him
sat
Jesse
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
.
*NL*
In
the
stables
he
could
hear
the
tramping
of
his
horses
*NL*
and
the
restless
movement
of
his
cattle
.
Away
in
the
*NL*
fields
he
could
see
other
cattle
wandering
over
green
*NL*
hills
.
The
voices
of
men
,
his
men
who
worked
for
him
,
*NL*
came
in
to
him
through
the
window
.
From
the
milkhouse
*NL*
there
was
the
steady
thump
,
thump
of
a
churn
being
*NL*
manipulated
by
the
half-witted
girl
,
Eliza
Stoughton
.
*NL*
Jesse
's
mind
went
back
to
the
men
of
Old
Testament
days
*NL*
who
had
also
owned
lands
and
herds
.
He
remembered
how
*NL*
God
had
come
down
out
of
the
skies
and
talked
to
these
*NL*
men
and
he
wanted
God
to
notice
and
to
talk
to
him
*NL*
also
.
A
kind
of
feverish
boyish
eagerness
to
in
some
*NL*
way
achieve
in
his
own
life
the
flavor
of
significance
*NL*
that
had
hung
over
these
men
took
possession
of
him
.
*NL*
Being
a
prayerful
man
he
spoke
of
the
matter
aloud
to
*NL*
God
and
the
sound
of
his
own
words
strengthened
and
fed
*NL*
his
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
new
kind
of
man
come
into
possession
of
these
*NL*
fields
,
''
he
declared
.
``
Look
upon
me
,
O
God
,
and
look
*NL*
Thou
also
upon
my
neighbors
and
all
the
men
who
have
*NL*
gone
before
me
here
!
O
God
,
create
in
me
another
Jesse
,
*NL*
like
that
one
of
old
,
to
rule
over
men
and
to
be
the
*NL*
father
of
sons
who
shall
be
rulers
!
''
Jesse
grew
excited
*NL*
as
he
talked
aloud
and
jumping
to
his
feet
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
in
the
room
.
In
fancy
he
saw
himself
living
in
*NL*
old
times
and
among
old
peoples
.
The
land
that
lay
*NL*
stretched
out
before
him
became
of
vast
significance
,
a
*NL*
place
peopled
by
his
fancy
with
a
new
race
of
men
*NL*
sprung
from
himself
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
in
his
day
*NL*
as
in
those
other
and
older
days
,
kingdoms
might
be
*NL*
created
and
new
impulses
given
to
the
lives
of
men
by
*NL*
the
power
of
God
speaking
through
a
chosen
servant
.
He
*NL*
longed
to
be
such
a
servant
.
``
It
is
God
's
work
I
have
*NL*
come
to
the
land
to
do
,
''
he
declared
in
a
loud
voice
*NL*
and
his
short
figure
straightened
and
he
thought
that
*NL*
something
like
a
halo
of
Godly
approval
hung
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
perhaps
be
somewhat
difficult
for
the
men
and
*NL*
women
of
a
later
day
to
understand
Jesse
Bentley
.
In
*NL*
the
last
fifty
years
a
vast
change
has
taken
place
in
*NL*
the
lives
of
our
people
.
A
revolution
has
in
fact
taken
*NL*
place
.
The
coming
of
industrialism
,
attended
by
all
the
*NL*
roar
and
rattle
of
affairs
,
the
shrill
cries
of
*NL*
millions
of
new
voices
that
have
come
among
us
from
*NL*
overseas
,
the
going
and
coming
of
trains
,
the
growth
of
*NL*
cities
,
the
building
of
the
inter-urban
car
lines
that
*NL*
weave
in
and
out
of
towns
and
past
farmhouses
,
and
now
*NL*
in
these
later
days
the
coming
of
the
automobiles
has
*NL*
worked
a
tremendous
change
in
the
lives
and
in
the
*NL*
habits
of
thought
of
our
people
of
Mid-America
.
Books
,
*NL*
badly
imagined
and
written
though
they
may
be
in
the
*NL*
hurry
of
our
times
,
are
in
every
household
,
magazines
*NL*
circulate
by
the
millions
of
copies
,
newspapers
are
*NL*
everywhere
.
In
our
day
a
farmer
standing
by
the
stove
*NL*
in
the
store
in
his
village
has
his
mind
filled
to
*NL*
overflowing
with
the
words
of
other
men
.
The
newspapers
*NL*
and
the
magazines
have
pumped
him
full
.
Much
of
the
old
*NL*
brutal
ignorance
that
had
in
it
also
a
kind
of
*NL*
beautiful
childlike
innocence
is
gone
forever
.
The
*NL*
farmer
by
the
stove
is
brother
to
the
men
of
the
*NL*
cities
,
and
if
you
listen
you
will
find
him
talking
as
*NL*
glibly
and
as
senselessly
as
the
best
city
man
of
us
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Jesse
Bentley
's
time
and
in
the
country
districts
of
*NL*
the
whole
Middle
West
in
the
years
after
the
Civil
War
*NL*
it
was
not
so
.
Men
labored
too
hard
and
were
too
tired
*NL*
to
read
.
In
them
was
no
desire
for
words
printed
upon
*NL*
paper
.
As
they
worked
in
the
fields
,
vague
,
half-formed
*NL*
thoughts
took
possession
of
them
.
They
believed
in
God
*NL*
and
in
God
's
power
to
control
their
lives
.
In
the
*NL*
little
Protestant
churches
they
gathered
on
Sunday
to
*NL*
hear
of
God
and
his
works
.
The
churches
were
the
center
*NL*
of
the
social
and
intellectual
life
of
the
times
.
The
*NL*
figure
of
God
was
big
in
the
hearts
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
having
been
born
an
imaginative
child
and
*NL*
having
within
him
a
great
intellectual
eagerness
,
Jesse
*NL*
Bentley
had
turned
wholeheartedly
toward
God
.
When
the
*NL*
war
took
his
brothers
away
,
he
saw
the
hand
of
God
in
*NL*
that
.
When
his
father
became
ill
and
could
no
longer
*NL*
attend
to
the
running
of
the
farm
,
he
took
that
also
as
*NL*
a
sign
from
God
.
In
the
city
,
when
the
word
came
to
*NL*
him
,
he
walked
about
at
night
through
the
streets
*NL*
thinking
of
the
matter
and
when
he
had
come
home
and
*NL*
had
got
the
work
on
the
farm
well
under
way
,
he
went
*NL*
again
at
night
to
walk
through
the
forests
and
over
the
*NL*
low
hills
and
to
think
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
the
importance
of
his
own
figure
in
some
*NL*
divine
plan
grew
in
his
mind
.
He
grew
avaricious
and
*NL*
was
impatient
that
the
farm
contained
only
six
hundred
*NL*
acres
.
Kneeling
in
a
fence
corner
at
the
edge
of
some
*NL*
meadow
,
he
sent
his
voice
abroad
into
the
silence
and
*NL*
looking
up
he
saw
the
stars
shining
down
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
some
months
after
his
father
's
death
,
and
*NL*
when
his
wife
Katherine
was
expecting
at
any
moment
to
*NL*
be
laid
abed
of
childbirth
,
Jesse
left
his
house
and
*NL*
went
for
a
long
walk
.
The
Bentley
farm
was
situated
in
*NL*
a
tiny
valley
watered
by
Wine
Creek
,
and
Jesse
walked
*NL*
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
to
the
end
of
his
own
*NL*
land
and
on
through
the
fields
of
his
neighbors
.
As
he
*NL*
walked
the
valley
broadened
and
then
narrowed
again
.
*NL*
Great
open
stretches
of
field
and
wood
lay
before
him
.
*NL*
The
moon
came
out
from
behind
clouds
,
and
,
climbing
a
*NL*
low
hill
,
he
sat
down
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
thought
that
as
the
true
servant
of
God
the
*NL*
entire
stretch
of
country
through
which
he
had
walked
*NL*
should
have
come
into
his
possession
.
He
thought
of
his
*NL*
dead
brothers
and
blamed
them
that
they
had
not
worked
*NL*
harder
and
achieved
more
.
Before
him
in
the
moonlight
*NL*
the
tiny
stream
ran
down
over
stones
,
and
he
began
to
*NL*
think
of
the
men
of
old
times
who
like
himself
had
*NL*
owned
flocks
and
lands
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fantastic
impulse
,
half
fear
,
half
greediness
,
took
*NL*
possession
of
Jesse
Bentley
.
He
remembered
how
in
the
*NL*
old
Bible
story
the
Lord
had
appeared
to
that
other
*NL*
Jesse
and
told
him
to
send
his
son
David
to
where
Saul
*NL*
and
the
men
of
Israel
were
fighting
the
Philistines
in
*NL*
the
Valley
of
Elah
.
Into
Jesse
's
mind
came
the
*NL*
conviction
that
all
of
the
Ohio
farmers
who
owned
land
*NL*
in
the
valley
of
Wine
Creek
were
Philistines
and
*NL*
enemies
of
God
.
``
Suppose
,
''
he
whispered
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
there
should
come
from
among
them
one
who
,
like
*NL*
Goliath
the
Philistine
of
Gath
,
could
defeat
me
and
*NL*
take
from
me
my
possessions
.
''
In
fancy
he
felt
the
*NL*
sickening
dread
that
he
thought
must
have
lain
heavy
on
*NL*
the
heart
of
Saul
before
the
coming
of
David
.
Jumping
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
he
began
to
run
through
the
night
.
As
he
*NL*
ran
he
called
to
God
.
His
voice
carried
far
over
the
*NL*
low
hills
.
``
Jehovah
of
Hosts
,
''
he
cried
,
``
send
to
me
*NL*
this
night
out
of
the
womb
of
Katherine
,
a
son
.
Let
Thy
*NL*
grace
alight
upon
me
.
Send
me
a
son
to
be
called
David
*NL*
who
shall
help
me
to
pluck
at
last
all
of
these
lands
*NL*
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
and
turn
them
to
*NL*
Thy
service
and
to
the
building
of
Thy
kingdom
on
*NL*
earth
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
David
Hardy
of
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
was
the
grandson
of
*NL*
Jesse
Bentley
,
the
owner
of
Bentley
farms
.
When
he
was
*NL*
twelve
years
old
he
went
to
the
old
Bentley
place
to
*NL*
live
.
His
mother
,
Louise
Bentley
,
the
girl
who
came
*NL*
into
the
world
on
that
night
when
Jesse
ran
through
the
*NL*
fields
crying
to
God
that
he
be
given
a
son
,
had
grown
*NL*
to
womanhood
on
the
farm
and
had
married
young
John
*NL*
Hardy
of
Winesburg
,
who
became
a
banker
.
Louise
and
her
*NL*
husband
did
not
live
happily
together
and
everyone
*NL*
agreed
that
she
was
to
blame
.
She
was
a
small
woman
*NL*
with
sharp
grey
eyes
and
black
hair
.
From
childhood
she
*NL*
had
been
inclined
to
fits
of
temper
and
when
not
angry
*NL*
she
was
often
morose
and
silent
.
In
Winesburg
it
was
*NL*
said
that
she
drank
.
Her
husband
,
the
banker
,
who
was
a
*NL*
careful
,
shrewd
man
,
tried
hard
to
make
her
happy
.
When
*NL*
he
began
to
make
money
he
bought
for
her
a
large
brick
*NL*
house
on
Elm
Street
in
Winesburg
and
he
was
the
first
*NL*
man
in
that
town
to
keep
a
manservant
to
drive
his
*NL*
wife
's
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Louise
could
not
be
made
happy
.
She
flew
into
half
*NL*
insane
fits
of
temper
during
which
she
was
sometimes
*NL*
silent
,
sometimes
noisy
and
quarrelsome
.
She
swore
and
*NL*
cried
out
in
her
anger
.
She
got
a
knife
from
the
*NL*
kitchen
and
threatened
her
husband
's
life
.
Once
she
*NL*
deliberately
set
fire
to
the
house
,
and
often
she
hid
*NL*
herself
away
for
days
in
her
own
room
and
would
see
no
*NL*
one
.
Her
life
,
lived
as
a
half
recluse
,
gave
rise
to
*NL*
all
sorts
of
stories
concerning
her
.
It
was
said
that
*NL*
she
took
drugs
and
that
she
hid
herself
away
from
*NL*
people
because
she
was
often
so
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
drink
that
her
condition
could
not
be
concealed
.
*NL*
Sometimes
on
summer
afternoons
she
came
out
of
the
*NL*
house
and
got
into
her
carriage
.
Dismissing
the
driver
*NL*
she
took
the
reins
in
her
own
hands
and
drove
off
at
*NL*
top
speed
through
the
streets
.
If
a
pedestrian
got
in
*NL*
her
way
she
drove
straight
ahead
and
the
frightened
*NL*
citizen
had
to
escape
as
best
he
could
.
To
the
people
*NL*
of
the
town
it
seemed
as
though
she
wanted
to
run
them
*NL*
down
.
When
she
had
driven
through
several
streets
,
*NL*
tearing
around
corners
and
beating
the
horses
with
the
*NL*
whip
,
she
drove
off
into
the
country
.
On
the
country
*NL*
roads
after
she
had
gotten
out
of
sight
of
the
houses
*NL*
she
let
the
horses
slow
down
to
a
walk
and
her
wild
,
*NL*
reckless
mood
passed
.
She
became
thoughtful
and
*NL*
muttered
words
.
Sometimes
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
And
*NL*
then
when
she
came
back
into
town
she
again
drove
*NL*
furiously
through
the
quiet
streets
.
But
for
the
*NL*
influence
of
her
husband
and
the
respect
he
inspired
in
*NL*
people
's
minds
she
would
have
been
arrested
more
than
*NL*
once
by
the
town
marshal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
David
Hardy
grew
up
in
the
house
with
this
woman
*NL*
and
as
can
well
be
imagined
there
was
not
much
joy
in
*NL*
his
childhood
.
He
was
too
young
then
to
have
opinions
*NL*
of
his
own
about
people
,
but
at
times
it
was
difficult
*NL*
for
him
not
to
have
very
definite
opinions
about
the
*NL*
woman
who
was
his
mother
.
David
was
always
a
quiet
,
*NL*
orderly
boy
and
for
a
long
time
was
thought
by
the
*NL*
people
of
Winesburg
to
be
something
of
a
dullard
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
brown
and
as
a
child
he
had
a
habit
of
*NL*
looking
at
things
and
people
a
long
time
without
*NL*
appearing
to
see
what
he
was
looking
at
.
When
he
heard
*NL*
his
mother
spoken
of
harshly
or
when
he
overheard
her
*NL*
berating
his
father
,
he
was
frightened
and
ran
away
to
*NL*
hide
.
Sometimes
he
could
not
find
a
hiding
place
and
*NL*
that
confused
him
.
Turning
his
face
toward
a
tree
or
if
*NL*
he
was
indoors
toward
the
wall
,
he
closed
his
eyes
and
*NL*
tried
not
to
think
of
anything
.
He
had
a
habit
of
*NL*
talking
aloud
to
himself
,
and
early
in
life
a
spirit
of
*NL*
quiet
sadness
often
took
possession
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
occasions
when
David
went
to
visit
his
*NL*
grandfather
on
the
Bentley
farm
,
he
was
altogether
*NL*
contented
and
happy
.
Often
he
wished
that
he
would
*NL*
never
have
to
go
back
to
town
and
once
when
he
had
come
*NL*
home
from
the
farm
after
a
long
visit
,
something
*NL*
happened
that
had
a
lasting
effect
on
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
David
had
come
back
into
town
with
one
of
the
hired
*NL*
men
.
The
man
was
in
a
hurry
to
go
about
his
own
affairs
*NL*
and
left
the
boy
at
the
head
of
the
street
in
which
the
*NL*
Hardy
house
stood
.
It
was
early
dusk
of
a
fall
evening
*NL*
and
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
.
Something
*NL*
happened
to
David
.
He
could
not
bear
to
go
into
the
*NL*
house
where
his
mother
and
father
lived
,
and
on
an
*NL*
impulse
he
decided
to
run
away
from
home
.
He
intended
*NL*
to
go
back
to
the
farm
and
to
his
grandfather
,
but
lost
*NL*
his
way
and
for
hours
he
wandered
weeping
and
*NL*
frightened
on
country
roads
.
It
started
to
rain
and
*NL*
lightning
flashed
in
the
sky
.
The
boy
's
imagination
was
*NL*
excited
and
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
and
hear
*NL*
strange
things
in
the
darkness
.
Into
his
mind
came
the
*NL*
conviction
that
he
was
walking
and
running
in
some
*NL*
terrible
void
where
no
one
had
ever
been
before
.
The
*NL*
darkness
about
him
seemed
limitless
.
The
sound
of
the
*NL*
wind
blowing
in
trees
was
terrifying
.
When
a
team
of
*NL*
horses
approached
along
the
road
in
which
he
walked
he
*NL*
was
frightened
and
climbed
a
fence
.
Through
a
field
he
*NL*
ran
until
he
came
into
another
road
and
getting
upon
*NL*
his
knees
felt
of
the
soft
ground
with
his
fingers
.
But
*NL*
for
the
figure
of
his
grandfather
,
whom
he
was
afraid
*NL*
he
would
never
find
in
the
darkness
,
he
thought
the
*NL*
world
must
be
altogether
empty
.
When
his
cries
were
*NL*
heard
by
a
farmer
who
was
walking
home
from
town
and
he
*NL*
was
brought
back
to
his
father
's
house
,
he
was
so
tired
*NL*
and
excited
that
he
did
not
know
what
was
happening
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
chance
David
's
father
knew
that
he
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
On
the
street
he
had
met
the
farm
hand
from
the
Bentley
*NL*
place
and
knew
of
his
son
's
return
to
town
.
When
the
*NL*
boy
did
not
come
home
an
alarm
was
set
up
and
John
*NL*
Hardy
with
several
men
of
the
town
went
to
search
the
*NL*
country
.
The
report
that
David
had
been
kidnapped
ran
*NL*
about
through
the
streets
of
Winesburg
.
When
he
came
*NL*
home
there
were
no
lights
in
the
house
,
but
his
mother
*NL*
appeared
and
clutched
him
eagerly
in
her
arms
.
David
*NL*
thought
she
had
suddenly
become
another
woman
.
He
could
*NL*
not
believe
that
so
delightful
a
thing
had
happened
.
*NL*
With
her
own
hands
Louise
Hardy
bathed
his
tired
young
*NL*
body
and
cooked
him
food
.
She
would
not
let
him
go
to
*NL*
bed
but
,
when
he
had
put
on
his
nightgown
,
blew
out
the
*NL*
lights
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
to
hold
him
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
For
an
hour
the
woman
sat
in
the
darkness
and
held
her
*NL*
boy
.
All
the
time
she
kept
talking
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
David
could
not
understand
what
had
so
changed
her
.
Her
*NL*
habitually
dissatisfied
face
had
become
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
the
most
peaceful
and
lovely
thing
he
had
ever
seen
.
*NL*
When
he
began
to
weep
she
held
him
more
and
more
*NL*
tightly
.
On
and
on
went
her
voice
.
It
was
not
harsh
or
*NL*
shrill
as
when
she
talked
to
her
husband
,
but
was
like
*NL*
rain
falling
on
trees
.
Presently
men
began
coming
to
*NL*
the
door
to
report
that
he
had
not
been
found
,
but
she
*NL*
made
him
hide
and
be
silent
until
she
had
sent
them
*NL*
away
.
He
thought
it
must
be
a
game
his
mother
and
the
*NL*
men
of
the
town
were
playing
with
him
and
laughed
*NL*
joyously
.
Into
his
mind
came
the
thought
that
his
*NL*
having
been
lost
and
frightened
in
the
darkness
was
an
*NL*
altogether
unimportant
matter
.
He
thought
that
he
would
*NL*
have
been
willing
to
go
through
the
frightful
*NL*
experience
a
thousand
times
to
be
sure
of
finding
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
long
black
road
a
thing
so
lovely
as
his
*NL*
mother
had
suddenly
become
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
years
of
young
David
's
boyhood
he
saw
*NL*
his
mother
but
seldom
and
she
became
for
him
just
a
*NL*
woman
with
whom
he
had
once
lived
.
Still
he
could
not
*NL*
get
her
figure
out
of
his
mind
and
as
he
grew
older
it
*NL*
became
more
definite
.
When
he
was
twelve
years
old
he
*NL*
went
to
the
Bentley
farm
to
live
.
Old
Jesse
came
into
*NL*
town
and
fairly
demanded
that
he
be
given
charge
of
the
*NL*
boy
.
The
old
man
was
excited
and
determined
on
having
*NL*
his
own
way
.
He
talked
to
John
Hardy
in
the
office
of
*NL*
the
Winesburg
Savings
Bank
and
then
the
two
men
went
to
*NL*
the
house
on
Elm
Street
to
talk
with
Louise
.
They
both
*NL*
expected
her
to
make
trouble
but
were
mistaken
.
She
was
*NL*
very
quiet
and
when
Jesse
had
explained
his
mission
and
*NL*
had
gone
on
at
some
length
about
the
advantages
to
come
*NL*
through
having
the
boy
out
of
doors
and
in
the
quiet
*NL*
atmosphere
of
the
old
farmhouse
,
she
nodded
her
head
in
*NL*
approval
.
``
It
is
an
atmosphere
not
corrupted
by
my
*NL*
presence
,
''
she
said
sharply
.
Her
shoulders
shook
and
*NL*
she
seemed
about
to
fly
into
a
fit
of
temper
.
``
It
is
a
*NL*
place
for
a
man
child
,
although
it
was
never
a
place
*NL*
for
me
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
You
never
wanted
me
there
and
of
*NL*
course
the
air
of
your
house
did
me
no
good
.
It
was
*NL*
like
poison
in
my
blood
but
it
will
be
different
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
the
two
*NL*
men
to
sit
in
embarrassed
silence
.
As
very
often
*NL*
happened
she
later
stayed
in
her
room
for
days
.
Even
*NL*
when
the
boy
's
clothes
were
packed
and
he
was
taken
*NL*
away
she
did
not
appear
.
The
loss
of
her
son
made
a
*NL*
sharp
break
in
her
life
and
she
seemed
less
inclined
to
*NL*
quarrel
with
her
husband
.
John
Hardy
thought
it
had
all
*NL*
turned
out
very
well
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
young
David
went
to
live
in
the
Bentley
*NL*
farmhouse
with
Jesse
.
Two
of
the
old
farmer
's
sisters
*NL*
were
alive
and
still
lived
in
the
house
.
They
were
*NL*
afraid
of
Jesse
and
rarely
spoke
when
he
was
about
.
One
*NL*
of
the
women
who
had
been
noted
for
her
flaming
red
*NL*
hair
when
she
was
younger
was
a
born
mother
and
became
*NL*
the
boy
's
caretaker
.
Every
night
when
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
bed
she
went
into
his
room
and
sat
on
the
floor
until
*NL*
he
fell
asleep
.
When
he
became
drowsy
she
became
bold
*NL*
and
whispered
things
that
he
later
thought
he
must
have
*NL*
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
soft
low
voice
called
him
endearing
names
and
he
*NL*
dreamed
that
his
mother
had
come
to
him
and
that
she
*NL*
had
changed
so
that
she
was
always
as
she
had
been
that
*NL*
time
after
he
ran
away
.
He
also
grew
bold
and
reaching
*NL*
out
his
hand
stroked
the
face
of
the
woman
on
the
floor
*NL*
so
that
she
was
ecstatically
happy
.
Everyone
in
the
old
*NL*
house
became
happy
after
the
boy
went
there
.
The
hard
*NL*
insistent
thing
in
Jesse
Bentley
that
had
kept
the
*NL*
people
in
the
house
silent
and
timid
and
that
had
never
*NL*
been
dispelled
by
the
presence
of
the
girl
Louise
was
*NL*
apparently
swept
away
by
the
coming
of
the
boy
.
It
was
*NL*
as
though
God
had
relented
and
sent
a
son
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
had
proclaimed
himself
the
only
true
*NL*
servant
of
God
in
all
the
valley
of
Wine
Creek
,
and
who
*NL*
had
wanted
God
to
send
him
a
sign
of
approval
by
way
of
*NL*
a
son
out
of
the
womb
of
Katherine
,
began
to
think
that
*NL*
at
last
his
prayers
had
been
answered
.
Although
he
was
*NL*
at
that
time
only
fifty-five
years
old
he
looked
*NL*
seventy
and
was
worn
out
with
much
thinking
and
*NL*
scheming
.
The
effort
he
had
made
to
extend
his
land
*NL*
holdings
had
been
successful
and
there
were
few
farms
*NL*
in
the
valley
that
did
not
belong
to
him
,
but
until
*NL*
David
came
he
was
a
bitterly
disappointed
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
influences
at
work
in
Jesse
Bentley
and
*NL*
all
his
life
his
mind
had
been
a
battleground
for
these
*NL*
influences
.
First
there
was
the
old
thing
in
him
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
be
a
man
of
God
and
a
leader
among
men
of
*NL*
God
.
His
walking
in
the
fields
and
through
the
forests
*NL*
at
night
had
brought
him
close
to
nature
and
there
were
*NL*
forces
in
the
passionately
religious
man
that
ran
out
*NL*
to
the
forces
in
nature
.
The
disappointment
that
had
*NL*
come
to
him
when
a
daughter
and
not
a
son
had
been
born
*NL*
to
Katherine
had
fallen
upon
him
like
a
blow
struck
by
*NL*
some
unseen
hand
and
the
blow
had
somewhat
softened
his
*NL*
egotism
.
He
still
believed
that
God
might
at
any
moment
*NL*
make
himself
manifest
out
of
the
winds
or
the
clouds
,
*NL*
but
he
no
longer
demanded
such
recognition
.
Instead
he
*NL*
prayed
for
it
.
Sometimes
he
was
altogether
doubtful
and
*NL*
thought
God
had
deserted
the
world
.
He
regretted
the
*NL*
fate
that
had
not
let
him
live
in
a
simpler
and
sweeter
*NL*
time
when
at
the
beckoning
of
some
strange
cloud
in
the
*NL*
sky
men
left
their
lands
and
houses
and
went
forth
into
*NL*
the
wilderness
to
create
new
races
.
While
he
worked
*NL*
night
and
day
to
make
his
farms
more
productive
and
to
*NL*
extend
his
holdings
of
land
,
he
regretted
that
he
could
*NL*
not
use
his
own
restless
energy
in
the
building
of
*NL*
temples
,
the
slaying
of
unbelievers
and
in
general
in
*NL*
the
work
of
glorifying
God
's
name
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
what
Jesse
hungered
for
and
then
also
he
*NL*
hungered
for
something
else
.
He
had
grown
into
maturity
*NL*
in
America
in
the
years
after
the
Civil
War
and
he
,
*NL*
like
all
men
of
his
time
,
had
been
touched
by
the
deep
*NL*
influences
that
were
at
work
in
the
country
during
*NL*
those
years
when
modern
industrialism
was
being
born
.
*NL*
He
began
to
buy
machines
that
would
permit
him
to
do
*NL*
the
work
of
the
farms
while
employing
fewer
men
and
he
*NL*
sometimes
thought
that
if
he
were
a
younger
man
he
*NL*
would
give
up
farming
altogether
and
start
a
factory
in
*NL*
Winesburg
for
the
making
of
machinery
.
Jesse
formed
the
*NL*
habit
of
reading
newspapers
and
magazines
.
He
invented
*NL*
a
machine
for
the
making
of
fence
out
of
wire
.
Faintly
*NL*
he
realized
that
the
atmosphere
of
old
times
and
places
*NL*
that
he
had
always
cultivated
in
his
own
mind
was
*NL*
strange
and
foreign
to
the
thing
that
was
growing
up
in
*NL*
the
minds
of
others
.
The
beginning
of
the
most
*NL*
materialistic
age
in
the
history
of
the
world
,
when
*NL*
wars
would
be
fought
without
patriotism
,
when
men
would
*NL*
forget
God
and
only
pay
attention
to
moral
standards
,
*NL*
when
the
will
to
power
would
replace
the
will
to
serve
*NL*
and
beauty
would
be
well-nigh
forgotten
in
the
terrible
*NL*
headlong
rush
of
mankind
toward
the
acquiring
of
*NL*
possessions
,
was
telling
its
story
to
Jesse
the
man
of
*NL*
God
as
it
was
to
the
men
about
him
.
The
greedy
thing
in
*NL*
him
wanted
to
make
money
faster
than
it
could
be
made
*NL*
by
tilling
the
land
.
More
than
once
he
went
into
*NL*
Winesburg
to
talk
with
his
son-in-law
John
Hardy
about
*NL*
it
.
``
You
are
a
banker
and
you
will
have
chances
I
never
*NL*
had
,
''
he
said
and
his
eyes
shone
.
``
I
am
thinking
about
*NL*
it
all
the
time
.
Big
things
are
going
to
be
done
in
the
*NL*
country
and
there
will
be
more
money
to
be
made
than
I
*NL*
ever
dreamed
of
.
You
get
into
it
.
I
wish
I
were
younger
*NL*
and
had
your
chance
.
''
Jesse
Bentley
walked
up
and
down
*NL*
in
the
bank
office
and
grew
more
and
more
excited
as
he
*NL*
talked
.
At
one
time
in
his
life
he
had
been
threatened
*NL*
with
paralysis
and
his
left
side
remained
somewhat
*NL*
weakened
.
As
he
talked
his
left
eyelid
twitched
.
Later
*NL*
when
he
drove
back
home
and
when
night
came
on
and
the
*NL*
stars
came
out
it
was
harder
to
get
back
the
old
*NL*
feeling
of
a
close
and
personal
God
who
lived
in
the
*NL*
sky
overhead
and
who
might
at
any
moment
reach
out
his
*NL*
hand
,
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
appoint
for
him
*NL*
some
heroic
task
to
be
done
.
Jesse
's
mind
was
fixed
*NL*
upon
the
things
read
in
newspapers
and
magazines
,
on
*NL*
fortunes
to
be
made
almost
without
effort
by
shrewd
men
*NL*
who
bought
and
sold
.
For
him
the
coming
of
the
boy
*NL*
David
did
much
to
bring
back
with
renewed
force
the
old
*NL*
faith
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
God
had
at
last
looked
*NL*
with
favor
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
boy
on
the
farm
,
life
began
to
reveal
itself
*NL*
to
him
in
a
thousand
new
and
delightful
ways
.
The
*NL*
kindly
attitude
of
all
about
him
expanded
his
quiet
*NL*
nature
and
he
lost
the
half
timid
,
hesitating
manner
he
*NL*
had
always
had
with
his
people
.
At
night
when
he
went
*NL*
to
bed
after
a
long
day
of
adventures
in
the
stables
,
*NL*
in
the
fields
,
or
driving
about
from
farm
to
farm
with
*NL*
his
grandfather
,
he
wanted
to
embrace
everyone
in
the
*NL*
house
.
If
Sherley
Bentley
,
the
woman
who
came
each
*NL*
night
to
sit
on
the
floor
by
his
bedside
,
did
not
*NL*
appear
at
once
,
he
went
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
*NL*
shouted
,
his
young
voice
ringing
through
the
narrow
*NL*
halls
where
for
so
long
there
had
been
a
tradition
of
*NL*
silence
.
In
the
morning
when
he
awoke
and
lay
still
in
*NL*
bed
,
the
sounds
that
came
in
to
him
through
the
windows
*NL*
filled
him
with
delight
.
He
thought
with
a
shudder
of
*NL*
the
life
in
the
house
in
Winesburg
and
of
his
mother
's
*NL*
angry
voice
that
had
always
made
him
tremble
.
There
in
*NL*
the
country
all
sounds
were
pleasant
sounds
.
When
he
*NL*
awoke
at
dawn
the
barnyard
back
of
the
house
also
*NL*
awoke
.
In
the
house
people
stirred
about
.
Eliza
*NL*
Stoughton
the
half-witted
girl
was
poked
in
the
ribs
by
*NL*
a
farm
hand
and
giggled
noisily
,
in
some
distant
field
*NL*
a
cow
bawled
and
was
answered
by
the
cattle
in
the
*NL*
stables
,
and
one
of
the
farm
hands
spoke
sharply
to
the
*NL*
horse
he
was
grooming
by
the
stable
door
.
David
leaped
*NL*
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
a
window
.
All
of
the
people
*NL*
stirring
about
excited
his
mind
,
and
he
wondered
what
*NL*
his
mother
was
doing
in
the
house
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
windows
of
his
own
room
he
could
not
see
*NL*
directly
into
the
barnyard
where
the
farm
hands
had
now
*NL*
all
assembled
to
do
the
morning
shores
,
but
he
could
*NL*
hear
the
voices
of
the
men
and
the
neighing
of
the
*NL*
horses
.
When
one
of
the
men
laughed
,
he
laughed
also
.
*NL*
Leaning
out
at
the
open
window
,
he
looked
into
an
*NL*
orchard
where
a
fat
sow
wandered
about
with
a
litter
of
*NL*
tiny
pigs
at
her
heels
.
Every
morning
he
counted
the
*NL*
pigs
.
``
Four
,
five
,
six
,
seven
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
wetting
*NL*
his
finger
and
making
straight
up
and
down
marks
on
the
*NL*
window
ledge
.
David
ran
to
put
on
his
trousers
and
*NL*
shirt
.
A
feverish
desire
to
get
out
of
doors
took
*NL*
possession
of
him
.
Every
morning
he
made
such
a
noise
*NL*
coming
down
stairs
that
Aunt
Callie
,
the
housekeeper
,
*NL*
declared
he
was
trying
to
tear
the
house
down
.
When
he
*NL*
had
run
through
the
long
old
house
,
shutting
the
doors
*NL*
behind
him
with
a
bang
,
he
came
into
the
barnyard
and
*NL*
looked
about
with
an
amazed
air
of
expectancy
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
in
such
a
place
tremendous
things
*NL*
might
have
happened
during
the
night
.
The
farm
hands
*NL*
looked
at
him
and
laughed
.
Henry
Strader
,
an
old
man
*NL*
who
had
been
on
the
farm
since
Jesse
came
into
*NL*
possession
and
who
before
David
's
time
had
never
been
*NL*
known
to
make
a
joke
,
made
the
same
joke
every
morning
.
*NL*
It
amused
David
so
that
he
laughed
and
clapped
his
*NL*
hands
.
``
See
,
come
here
and
look
,
''
cried
the
old
man
.
*NL*
``
Grandfather
Jesse
's
white
mare
has
torn
the
black
*NL*
stocking
she
wears
on
her
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
through
the
long
summer
,
Jesse
Bentley
*NL*
drove
from
farm
to
farm
up
and
down
the
valley
of
Wine
*NL*
Creek
,
and
his
grandson
went
with
him
.
They
rode
in
a
*NL*
comfortable
old
phaeton
drawn
by
the
white
horse
.
The
*NL*
old
man
scratched
his
thin
white
beard
and
talked
to
*NL*
himself
of
his
plans
for
increasing
the
productiveness
*NL*
of
the
fields
they
visited
and
of
God
's
part
in
the
*NL*
plans
all
men
made
.
Sometimes
he
looked
at
David
and
*NL*
smiled
happily
and
then
for
a
long
time
he
appeared
to
*NL*
forget
the
boy
's
existence
.
More
and
more
every
day
now
*NL*
his
mind
turned
back
again
to
the
dreams
that
had
*NL*
filled
his
mind
when
he
had
first
come
out
of
the
city
*NL*
to
live
on
the
land
.
One
afternoon
he
startled
David
by
*NL*
letting
his
dreams
take
entire
possession
of
him
.
With
*NL*
the
boy
as
a
witness
,
he
went
through
a
ceremony
and
*NL*
brought
about
an
accident
that
nearly
destroyed
the
*NL*
companionship
that
was
growing
up
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
and
his
grandson
were
driving
in
a
distant
part
*NL*
of
the
valley
some
miles
from
home
.
A
forest
came
down
*NL*
to
the
road
and
through
the
forest
Wine
Creek
wriggled
*NL*
its
way
over
stones
toward
a
distant
river
.
All
the
*NL*
afternoon
Jesse
had
been
in
a
meditative
mood
and
now
*NL*
he
began
to
talk
.
His
mind
went
back
to
the
night
when
*NL*
he
had
been
frightened
by
thoughts
of
a
giant
that
*NL*
might
come
to
rob
and
plunder
him
of
his
possessions
,
*NL*
and
again
as
on
that
night
when
he
had
run
through
the
*NL*
fields
crying
for
a
son
,
he
became
excited
to
the
edge
*NL*
of
insanity
.
Stopping
the
horse
he
got
out
of
the
buggy
*NL*
and
asked
David
to
get
out
also
.
The
two
climbed
over
a
*NL*
fence
and
walked
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
.
The
boy
*NL*
paid
no
attention
to
the
muttering
of
his
grandfather
,
*NL*
but
ran
along
beside
him
and
wondered
what
was
going
to
*NL*
happen
.
When
a
rabbit
jumped
up
and
ran
away
through
*NL*
the
woods
,
he
clapped
his
hands
and
danced
with
*NL*
delight
.
He
looked
at
the
tall
trees
and
was
sorry
that
*NL*
he
was
not
a
little
animal
to
climb
high
in
the
air
*NL*
without
being
frightened
.
Stooping
,
he
picked
up
a
*NL*
small
stone
and
threw
it
over
the
head
of
his
*NL*
grandfather
into
a
clump
of
bushes
.
``
Wake
up
,
little
*NL*
animal
.
Go
and
climb
to
the
top
of
the
trees
,
''
he
*NL*
shouted
in
a
shrill
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
Bentley
went
along
under
the
trees
with
his
head
*NL*
bowed
and
with
his
mind
in
a
ferment
.
His
earnestness
*NL*
affected
the
boy
,
who
presently
became
silent
and
a
*NL*
little
alarmed
.
Into
the
old
man
's
mind
had
come
the
*NL*
notion
that
now
he
could
bring
from
God
a
word
or
a
*NL*
sign
out
of
the
sky
,
that
the
presence
of
the
boy
and
*NL*
man
on
their
knees
in
some
lonely
spot
in
the
forest
*NL*
would
make
the
miracle
he
had
been
waiting
for
almost
*NL*
inevitable
.
``
It
was
in
just
such
a
place
as
this
that
*NL*
other
David
tended
the
sheep
when
his
father
came
and
*NL*
told
him
to
go
down
unto
Saul
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
boy
rather
roughly
by
the
shoulder
,
he
*NL*
climbed
over
a
fallen
log
and
when
he
had
come
to
an
*NL*
open
place
among
the
trees
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
*NL*
and
began
to
pray
in
a
loud
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
kind
of
terror
he
had
never
known
before
took
*NL*
possession
of
David
.
Crouching
beneath
a
tree
he
*NL*
watched
the
man
on
the
ground
before
him
and
his
own
*NL*
knees
began
to
tremble
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
*NL*
the
presence
not
only
of
his
grandfather
but
of
someone
*NL*
else
,
someone
who
might
hurt
him
,
someone
who
was
not
*NL*
kindly
but
dangerous
and
brutal
.
He
began
to
cry
and
*NL*
reaching
down
picked
up
a
small
stick
,
which
he
held
*NL*
tightly
gripped
in
his
fingers
.
When
Jesse
Bentley
,
*NL*
absorbed
in
his
own
idea
,
suddenly
arose
and
advanced
*NL*
toward
him
,
his
terror
grew
until
his
whole
body
shook
.
*NL*
In
the
woods
an
intense
silence
seemed
to
lie
over
*NL*
everything
and
suddenly
out
of
the
silence
came
the
old
*NL*
man
's
harsh
and
insistent
voice
.
Gripping
the
boy
's
*NL*
shoulders
,
Jesse
turned
his
face
to
the
sky
and
*NL*
shouted
.
The
whole
left
side
of
his
face
twitched
and
*NL*
his
hand
on
the
boy
's
shoulder
twitched
also
.
``
Make
a
*NL*
sign
to
me
,
God
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Here
I
stand
with
the
boy
*NL*
David
.
Come
down
to
me
out
of
the
sky
and
make
Thy
*NL*
presence
known
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
cry
of
fear
,
David
turned
and
,
shaking
himself
*NL*
loose
from
the
hands
that
held
him
,
ran
away
through
*NL*
the
forest
.
He
did
not
believe
that
the
man
who
turned
*NL*
up
his
face
and
in
a
harsh
voice
shouted
at
the
sky
was
*NL*
his
grandfather
at
all
.
The
man
did
not
look
like
his
*NL*
grandfather
.
The
conviction
that
something
strange
and
*NL*
terrible
had
happened
,
that
by
some
miracle
a
new
and
*NL*
dangerous
person
had
come
into
the
body
of
the
kindly
*NL*
old
man
,
took
possession
of
him
.
On
and
on
he
ran
down
*NL*
the
hillside
,
sobbing
as
he
ran
.
When
he
fell
over
the
*NL*
roots
of
a
tree
and
in
falling
struck
his
head
,
he
*NL*
arose
and
tried
to
run
on
again
.
His
head
hurt
so
that
*NL*
presently
he
fell
down
and
lay
still
,
but
it
was
only
*NL*
after
Jesse
had
carried
him
to
the
buggy
and
he
awoke
*NL*
to
find
the
old
man
's
hand
stroking
his
head
tenderly
*NL*
that
the
terror
left
him
.
``
Take
me
away
.
There
is
a
*NL*
terrible
man
back
there
in
the
woods
,
''
he
declared
*NL*
firmly
,
while
Jesse
looked
away
over
the
tops
of
the
*NL*
trees
and
again
his
lips
cried
out
to
God
.
``
What
have
I
*NL*
done
that
Thou
dost
not
approve
of
me
,
''
he
whispered
*NL*
softly
,
saying
the
words
over
and
over
as
he
drove
*NL*
rapidly
along
the
road
with
the
boy
's
cut
and
bleeding
*NL*
head
held
tenderly
against
his
shoulder
.

III
*NL*
*NL*
Surrender
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
Louise
Bentley
,
who
became
Mrs.
John
Hardy
*NL*
and
lived
with
her
husband
in
a
brick
house
on
Elm
*NL*
Street
in
Winesburg
,
is
a
story
of
misunderstanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
such
women
as
Louise
can
be
understood
and
their
*NL*
lives
made
livable
,
much
will
have
to
be
done
.
*NL*
Thoughtful
books
will
have
to
be
written
and
thoughtful
*NL*
lives
lived
by
people
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Born
of
a
delicate
and
overworked
mother
,
and
an
*NL*
impulsive
,
hard
,
imaginative
father
,
who
did
not
look
*NL*
with
favor
upon
her
coming
into
the
world
,
Louise
was
*NL*
from
childhood
a
neurotic
,
one
of
the
race
of
*NL*
over-sensitive
women
that
in
later
days
industrialism
*NL*
was
to
bring
in
such
great
numbers
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
her
early
years
she
lived
on
the
Bentley
farm
,
a
*NL*
silent
,
moody
child
,
wanting
love
more
than
anything
*NL*
else
in
the
world
and
not
getting
it
.
When
she
was
*NL*
fifteen
she
went
to
live
in
Winesburg
with
the
family
*NL*
of
Albert
Hardy
,
who
had
a
store
for
the
sale
of
*NL*
buggies
and
wagons
,
and
who
was
a
member
of
the
town
*NL*
board
of
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
went
into
town
to
be
a
student
in
the
Winesburg
*NL*
High
School
and
she
went
to
live
at
the
Hardys
'
because
*NL*
Albert
Hardy
and
her
father
were
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardy
,
the
vehicle
merchant
of
Winesburg
,
like
*NL*
thousands
of
other
men
of
his
times
,
was
an
enthusiast
*NL*
on
the
subject
of
education
.
He
had
made
his
own
way
in
*NL*
the
world
without
learning
got
from
books
,
but
he
was
*NL*
convinced
that
had
he
but
known
books
things
would
have
*NL*
gone
better
with
him
.
To
everyone
who
came
into
his
*NL*
shop
he
talked
of
the
matter
,
and
in
his
own
household
*NL*
he
drove
his
family
distracted
by
his
constant
harping
*NL*
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
two
daughters
and
one
son
,
John
Hardy
,
and
more
*NL*
than
once
the
daughters
threatened
to
leave
school
*NL*
altogether
.
As
a
matter
of
principle
they
did
just
*NL*
enough
work
in
their
classes
to
avoid
punishment
.
``
I
*NL*
hate
books
and
I
hate
anyone
who
likes
books
,
''
Harriet
,
*NL*
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
,
declared
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
as
on
the
farm
Louise
was
not
happy
.
For
*NL*
years
she
had
dreamed
of
the
time
when
she
could
go
*NL*
forth
into
the
world
,
and
she
looked
upon
the
move
into
*NL*
the
Hardy
household
as
a
great
step
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
freedom
.
Always
when
she
had
thought
of
the
matter
,
it
*NL*
had
seemed
to
her
that
in
town
all
must
be
gaiety
and
*NL*
life
,
that
there
men
and
women
must
live
happily
and
*NL*
freely
,
giving
and
taking
friendship
and
affection
as
*NL*
one
takes
the
feel
of
a
wind
on
the
cheek
.
After
the
*NL*
silence
and
the
cheerlessness
of
life
in
the
Bentley
*NL*
house
,
she
dreamed
of
stepping
forth
into
an
atmosphere
*NL*
that
was
warm
and
pulsating
with
life
and
reality
.
And
*NL*
in
the
Hardy
household
Louise
might
have
got
something
*NL*
of
the
thing
for
which
she
so
hungered
but
for
a
*NL*
mistake
she
made
when
she
had
just
come
to
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
won
the
disfavor
of
the
two
Hardy
girls
,
Mary
*NL*
and
Harriet
,
by
her
application
to
her
studies
in
*NL*
school
.
She
did
not
come
to
the
house
until
the
day
*NL*
when
school
was
to
begin
and
knew
nothing
of
the
*NL*
feeling
they
had
in
the
matter
.
She
was
timid
and
*NL*
during
the
first
month
made
no
acquaintances
.
Every
*NL*
Friday
afternoon
one
of
the
hired
men
from
the
farm
*NL*
drove
into
Winesburg
and
took
her
home
for
the
*NL*
week-end
,
so
that
she
did
not
spend
the
Saturday
*NL*
holiday
with
the
town
people
.
Because
she
was
*NL*
embarrassed
and
lonely
she
worked
constantly
at
her
*NL*
studies
.
To
Mary
and
Harriet
,
it
seemed
as
though
she
*NL*
tried
to
make
trouble
for
them
by
her
proficiency
.
In
*NL*
her
eagerness
to
appear
well
Louise
wanted
to
answer
*NL*
every
question
put
to
the
class
by
the
teacher
.
She
*NL*
jumped
up
and
down
and
her
eyes
flashed
.
Then
when
she
*NL*
had
answered
some
question
the
others
in
the
class
had
*NL*
been
unable
to
answer
,
she
smiled
happily
.
``
See
,
I
have
*NL*
done
it
for
you
,
''
her
eyes
seemed
to
say
.
``
You
need
not
*NL*
bother
about
the
matter
.
I
will
answer
all
questions
.
*NL*
For
the
whole
class
it
will
be
easy
while
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
after
supper
in
the
Hardy
house
,
Albert
*NL*
Hardy
began
to
praise
Louise
.
One
of
the
teachers
had
*NL*
spoken
highly
of
her
and
he
was
delighted
.
``
Well
,
again
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
it
,
''
he
began
,
looking
hard
at
his
*NL*
daughters
and
then
turning
to
smile
at
Louise
.
``
Another
*NL*
of
the
teachers
has
told
me
of
the
good
work
Louise
is
*NL*
doing
.
Everyone
in
Winesburg
is
telling
me
how
smart
*NL*
she
is
.
I
am
ashamed
that
they
do
not
speak
so
of
my
*NL*
own
girls
.
''
Arising
,
the
merchant
marched
about
the
*NL*
room
and
lighted
his
evening
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
shook
their
*NL*
heads
wearily
.
Seeing
their
indifference
the
father
*NL*
became
angry
.
``
I
tell
you
it
is
something
for
you
two
*NL*
to
be
thinking
about
,
''
he
cried
,
glaring
at
them
.
*NL*
``
There
is
a
big
change
coming
here
in
America
and
in
*NL*
learning
is
the
only
hope
of
the
coming
generations
.
*NL*
Louise
is
the
daughter
of
a
rich
man
but
she
is
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
study
.
It
should
make
you
ashamed
to
see
*NL*
what
she
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
merchant
took
his
hat
from
a
rack
by
the
door
and
*NL*
prepared
to
depart
for
the
evening
.
At
the
door
he
*NL*
stopped
and
glared
back
.
So
fierce
was
his
manner
that
*NL*
Louise
was
frightened
and
ran
upstairs
to
her
own
room
.
*NL*
The
daughters
began
to
speak
of
their
own
affairs
.
``
Pay
*NL*
attention
to
me
,
''
roared
the
merchant
.
``
Your
minds
are
*NL*
lazy
.
Your
indifference
to
education
is
affecting
your
*NL*
characters
.
You
will
amount
to
nothing
.
Now
mark
what
I
*NL*
say
--
Louise
will
be
so
far
ahead
of
you
that
you
will
*NL*
never
catch
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
distracted
man
went
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
*NL*
street
shaking
with
wrath
.
He
went
along
muttering
*NL*
words
and
swearing
,
but
when
he
got
into
Main
Street
*NL*
his
anger
passed
.
He
stopped
to
talk
of
the
weather
or
*NL*
the
crops
with
some
other
merchant
or
with
a
farmer
who
*NL*
had
come
into
town
and
forgot
his
daughters
altogether
*NL*
or
,
if
he
thought
of
them
,
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
girls
will
be
girls
,
''
he
muttered
*NL*
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
house
when
Louise
came
down
into
the
room
where
*NL*
the
two
girls
sat
,
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
her
.
One
evening
after
she
had
been
there
for
more
than
*NL*
six
weeks
and
was
heartbroken
because
of
the
continued
*NL*
air
of
coldness
with
which
she
was
always
greeted
,
she
*NL*
burst
into
tears
.
``
Shut
up
your
crying
and
go
back
to
*NL*
your
own
room
and
to
your
books
,
''
Mary
Hardy
said
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
occupied
by
Louise
was
on
the
second
floor
of
*NL*
the
Hardy
house
,
and
her
window
looked
out
upon
an
*NL*
orchard
.
There
was
a
stove
in
the
room
and
every
*NL*
evening
young
John
Hardy
carried
up
an
armful
of
wood
*NL*
and
put
it
in
a
box
that
stood
by
the
wall
.
During
the
*NL*
second
month
after
she
came
to
the
house
,
Louise
gave
*NL*
up
all
hope
of
getting
on
a
friendly
footing
with
the
*NL*
Hardy
girls
and
went
to
her
own
room
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
evening
meal
was
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
began
to
play
with
thoughts
of
making
friends
*NL*
with
John
Hardy
.
When
he
came
into
the
room
with
the
*NL*
wood
in
his
arms
,
she
pretended
to
be
busy
with
her
*NL*
studies
but
watched
him
eagerly
.
When
he
had
put
the
*NL*
wood
in
the
box
and
turned
to
go
out
,
she
put
down
her
*NL*
head
and
blushed
.
She
tried
to
make
talk
but
could
say
*NL*
nothing
,
and
after
he
had
gone
she
was
angry
at
herself
*NL*
for
her
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mind
of
the
country
girl
became
filled
with
the
*NL*
idea
of
drawing
close
to
the
young
man
.
She
thought
*NL*
that
in
him
might
be
found
the
quality
she
had
all
her
*NL*
life
been
seeking
in
people
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
between
herself
and
all
the
other
people
in
the
world
,
*NL*
a
wall
had
been
built
up
and
that
she
was
living
just
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
some
warm
inner
circle
of
life
that
must
*NL*
be
quite
open
and
understandable
to
others
.
She
became
*NL*
obsessed
with
the
thought
that
it
wanted
but
a
*NL*
courageous
act
on
her
part
to
make
all
of
her
*NL*
association
with
people
something
quite
different
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
possible
by
such
an
act
to
pass
into
a
new
*NL*
life
as
one
opens
a
door
and
goes
into
a
room
.
Day
and
*NL*
night
she
thought
of
the
matter
,
but
although
the
thing
*NL*
she
wanted
so
earnestly
was
something
very
warm
and
*NL*
close
it
had
as
yet
no
conscious
connection
with
sex
.
*NL*
It
had
not
become
that
definite
,
and
her
mind
had
only
*NL*
alighted
upon
the
person
of
John
Hardy
because
he
was
*NL*
at
hand
and
unlike
his
sisters
had
not
been
unfriendly
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hardy
sisters
,
Mary
and
Harriet
,
were
both
older
*NL*
than
Louise
.
In
a
certain
kind
of
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
world
they
were
years
older
.
They
lived
as
all
of
the
*NL*
young
women
of
Middle
Western
towns
lived
.
In
those
*NL*
days
young
women
did
not
go
out
of
our
towns
to
Eastern
*NL*
colleges
and
ideas
in
regard
to
social
classes
had
*NL*
hardly
begun
to
exist
.
A
daughter
of
a
laborer
was
in
*NL*
much
the
same
social
position
as
a
daughter
of
a
farmer
*NL*
or
a
merchant
,
and
there
were
no
leisure
classes
.
A
*NL*
girl
was
``
nice
''
or
she
was
``
not
nice
.
''
If
a
nice
girl
,
*NL*
she
had
a
young
man
who
came
to
her
house
to
see
her
on
*NL*
Sunday
and
on
Wednesday
evenings
.
Sometimes
she
went
*NL*
with
her
young
man
to
a
dance
or
a
church
social
.
At
*NL*
other
times
she
received
him
at
the
house
and
was
given
*NL*
the
use
of
the
parlor
for
that
purpose
.
No
one
intruded
*NL*
upon
her
.
For
hours
the
two
sat
behind
closed
doors
.
*NL*
Sometimes
the
lights
were
turned
low
and
the
young
man
*NL*
and
woman
embraced
.
Cheeks
became
hot
and
hair
*NL*
disarranged
.
After
a
year
or
two
,
if
the
impulse
within
*NL*
them
became
strong
and
insistent
enough
,
they
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
during
her
first
winter
in
Winesburg
,
*NL*
Louise
had
an
adventure
that
gave
a
new
impulse
to
her
*NL*
desire
to
break
down
the
wall
that
she
thought
stood
*NL*
between
her
and
John
Hardy
.
It
was
Wednesday
and
*NL*
immediately
after
the
evening
meal
Albert
Hardy
put
on
*NL*
his
hat
and
went
away
.
Young
John
brought
the
wood
and
*NL*
put
it
in
the
box
in
Louise
's
room
.
``
You
do
work
hard
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
?
''
he
said
awkwardly
,
and
then
before
she
*NL*
could
answer
he
also
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
heard
him
go
out
of
the
house
and
had
a
mad
*NL*
desire
to
run
after
him
.
Opening
her
window
she
leaned
*NL*
out
and
called
softly
,
``
John
,
dear
John
,
come
back
,
*NL*
do
n't
go
away
.
''
The
night
was
cloudy
and
she
could
not
*NL*
see
far
into
the
darkness
,
but
as
she
waited
she
*NL*
fancied
she
could
hear
a
soft
little
noise
as
of
*NL*
someone
going
on
tiptoes
through
the
trees
in
the
*NL*
orchard
.
She
was
frightened
and
closed
the
window
*NL*
quickly
.
For
an
hour
she
moved
about
the
room
trembling
*NL*
with
excitement
and
when
she
could
not
longer
bear
the
*NL*
waiting
,
she
crept
into
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
*NL*
into
a
closet-like
room
that
opened
off
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
had
decided
that
she
would
perform
the
*NL*
courageous
act
that
had
for
weeks
been
in
her
mind
.
She
*NL*
was
convinced
that
John
Hardy
had
concealed
himself
in
*NL*
the
orchard
beneath
her
window
and
she
was
determined
*NL*
to
find
him
and
tell
him
that
she
wanted
him
to
come
*NL*
close
to
her
,
to
hold
her
in
his
arms
,
to
tell
her
of
*NL*
his
thoughts
and
dreams
and
to
listen
while
she
told
*NL*
him
her
thoughts
and
dreams
.
``
In
the
darkness
it
will
*NL*
be
easier
to
say
things
,
''
she
whispered
to
herself
,
as
*NL*
she
stood
in
the
little
room
groping
for
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
suddenly
Louise
realized
that
she
was
not
*NL*
alone
in
the
house
.
In
the
parlor
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
door
a
man
's
voice
spoke
softly
and
the
door
*NL*
opened
.
Louise
just
had
time
to
conceal
herself
in
a
*NL*
little
opening
beneath
the
stairway
when
Mary
Hardy
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
her
young
man
,
came
into
the
little
dark
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
hour
Louise
sat
on
the
floor
in
the
darkness
and
*NL*
listened
.
Without
words
Mary
Hardy
,
with
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
man
who
had
come
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
,
brought
*NL*
to
the
country
girl
a
knowledge
of
men
and
women
.
*NL*
Putting
her
head
down
until
she
was
curled
into
a
*NL*
little
ball
she
lay
perfectly
still
.
It
seemed
to
her
*NL*
that
by
some
strange
impulse
of
the
gods
,
a
great
gift
*NL*
had
been
brought
to
Mary
Hardy
and
she
could
not
*NL*
understand
the
older
woman
's
determined
protest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
took
Mary
Hardy
into
his
arms
and
kissed
*NL*
her
.
When
she
struggled
and
laughed
,
he
but
held
her
*NL*
the
more
tightly
.
For
an
hour
the
contest
between
them
*NL*
went
on
and
then
they
went
back
into
the
parlor
and
*NL*
Louise
escaped
up
the
stairs
.
``
I
hope
you
were
quiet
*NL*
out
there
.
You
must
not
disturb
the
little
mouse
at
her
*NL*
studies
,
''
she
heard
Harriet
saying
to
her
sister
as
she
*NL*
stood
by
her
own
door
in
the
hallway
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
wrote
a
note
to
John
Hardy
and
late
that
night
,
*NL*
when
all
in
the
house
were
asleep
,
she
crept
downstairs
*NL*
and
slipped
it
under
his
door
.
She
was
afraid
that
if
*NL*
she
did
not
do
the
thing
at
once
her
courage
would
*NL*
fail
.
In
the
note
she
tried
to
be
quite
definite
about
*NL*
what
she
wanted
.
``
I
want
someone
to
love
me
and
I
want
*NL*
to
love
someone
,
''
she
wrote
.
``
If
you
are
the
one
for
me
*NL*
I
want
you
to
come
into
the
orchard
at
night
and
make
a
*NL*
noise
under
my
window
.
It
will
be
easy
for
me
to
crawl
*NL*
down
over
the
shed
and
come
to
you
.
I
am
thinking
about
*NL*
it
all
the
time
,
so
if
you
are
to
come
at
all
you
must
*NL*
come
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
Louise
did
not
know
what
would
be
the
*NL*
outcome
of
her
bold
attempt
to
secure
for
herself
a
*NL*
lover
.
In
a
way
she
still
did
not
know
whether
or
not
*NL*
she
wanted
him
to
come
.
Sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
to
be
held
tightly
and
kissed
was
the
whole
secret
of
*NL*
life
,
and
then
a
new
impulse
came
and
she
was
terribly
*NL*
afraid
.
The
age-old
woman
's
desire
to
be
possessed
had
*NL*
taken
possession
of
her
,
but
so
vague
was
her
notion
of
*NL*
life
that
it
seemed
to
her
just
the
touch
of
John
*NL*
Hardy
's
hand
upon
her
own
hand
would
satisfy
.
She
*NL*
wondered
if
he
would
understand
that
.
At
the
table
next
*NL*
day
while
Albert
Hardy
talked
and
the
two
girls
*NL*
whispered
and
laughed
,
she
did
not
look
at
John
but
at
*NL*
the
table
and
as
soon
as
possible
escaped
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
she
went
out
of
the
house
until
she
was
sure
he
*NL*
had
taken
the
wood
to
her
room
and
gone
away
.
When
*NL*
after
several
evenings
of
intense
listening
she
heard
*NL*
no
call
from
the
darkness
in
the
orchard
,
she
was
half
*NL*
beside
herself
with
grief
and
decided
that
for
her
*NL*
there
was
no
way
to
break
through
the
wall
that
had
*NL*
shut
her
off
from
the
joy
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
on
a
Monday
evening
two
or
three
weeks
after
*NL*
the
writing
of
the
note
,
John
Hardy
came
for
her
.
*NL*
Louise
had
so
entirely
given
up
the
thought
of
his
*NL*
coming
that
for
a
long
time
she
did
not
hear
the
call
*NL*
that
came
up
from
the
orchard
.
On
the
Friday
evening
*NL*
before
,
as
she
was
being
driven
back
to
the
farm
for
*NL*
the
week-end
by
one
of
the
hired
men
,
she
had
on
an
*NL*
impulse
done
a
thing
that
had
startled
her
,
and
as
John
*NL*
Hardy
stood
in
the
darkness
below
and
called
her
name
*NL*
softly
and
insistently
,
she
walked
about
in
her
room
*NL*
and
wondered
what
new
impulse
had
led
her
to
commit
so
*NL*
ridiculous
an
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farm
hand
,
a
young
fellow
with
black
curly
hair
,
*NL*
had
come
for
her
somewhat
late
on
that
Friday
evening
*NL*
and
they
drove
home
in
the
darkness
.
Louise
,
whose
mind
*NL*
was
filled
with
thoughts
of
John
Hardy
,
tried
to
make
*NL*
talk
but
the
country
boy
was
embarrassed
and
would
say
*NL*
nothing
.
Her
mind
began
to
review
the
loneliness
of
her
*NL*
childhood
and
she
remembered
with
a
pang
the
sharp
new
*NL*
loneliness
that
had
just
come
to
her
.
``
I
hate
*NL*
everyone
,
''
she
cried
suddenly
,
and
then
broke
forth
*NL*
into
a
tirade
that
frightened
her
escort
.
``
I
hate
*NL*
father
and
the
old
man
Hardy
,
too
,
''
she
declared
*NL*
vehemently
.
``
I
get
my
lessons
there
in
the
school
in
*NL*
town
but
I
hate
that
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
frightened
the
farm
hand
still
more
by
turning
*NL*
and
putting
her
cheek
down
upon
his
shoulder
.
Vaguely
*NL*
she
hoped
that
he
like
that
young
man
who
had
stood
in
*NL*
the
darkness
with
Mary
would
put
his
arms
about
her
and
*NL*
kiss
her
,
but
the
country
boy
was
only
alarmed
.
He
*NL*
struck
the
horse
with
the
whip
and
began
to
whistle
.
*NL*
``
The
road
is
rough
,
eh
?
''
he
said
loudly
.
Louise
was
so
*NL*
angry
that
reaching
up
she
snatched
his
hat
from
his
*NL*
head
and
threw
it
into
the
road
.
When
he
jumped
out
of
*NL*
the
buggy
and
went
to
get
it
,
she
drove
off
and
left
*NL*
him
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
back
to
the
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louise
Bentley
took
John
Hardy
to
be
her
lover
.
That
*NL*
was
not
what
she
wanted
but
it
was
so
the
young
man
had
*NL*
interpreted
her
approach
to
him
,
and
so
anxious
was
she
*NL*
to
achieve
something
else
that
she
made
no
resistance
.
*NL*
When
after
a
few
months
they
were
both
afraid
that
she
*NL*
was
about
to
become
a
mother
,
they
went
one
evening
to
*NL*
the
county
seat
and
were
married
.
For
a
few
months
they
*NL*
lived
in
the
Hardy
house
and
then
took
a
house
of
their
*NL*
own
.
All
during
the
first
year
Louise
tried
to
make
her
*NL*
husband
understand
the
vague
and
intangible
hunger
that
*NL*
had
led
to
the
writing
of
the
note
and
that
was
still
*NL*
unsatisfied
.
Again
and
again
she
crept
into
his
arms
*NL*
and
tried
to
talk
of
it
,
but
always
without
success
.
*NL*
Filled
with
his
own
notions
of
love
between
men
and
*NL*
women
,
he
did
not
listen
but
began
to
kiss
her
upon
the
*NL*
lips
.
That
confused
her
so
that
in
the
end
she
did
not
*NL*
want
to
be
kissed
.
She
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
alarm
that
had
tricked
them
into
marriage
*NL*
proved
to
be
groundless
,
she
was
angry
and
said
bitter
,
*NL*
hurtful
things
.
Later
when
her
son
David
was
born
,
she
*NL*
could
not
nurse
him
and
did
not
know
whether
she
wanted
*NL*
him
or
not
.
Sometimes
she
stayed
in
the
room
with
him
*NL*
all
day
,
walking
about
and
occasionally
creeping
close
*NL*
to
touch
him
tenderly
with
her
hands
,
and
then
other
*NL*
days
came
when
she
did
not
want
to
see
or
be
near
the
*NL*
tiny
bit
of
humanity
that
had
come
into
the
house
.
When
*NL*
John
Hardy
reproached
her
for
her
cruelty
,
she
laughed
.
*NL*
``
It
is
a
man
child
and
will
get
what
it
wants
anyway
,
''
*NL*
she
said
sharply
.
``
Had
it
been
a
woman
child
there
is
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
I
would
not
have
done
for
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Terror
*NL*
*NL*
When
David
Hardy
was
a
tall
boy
of
fifteen
,
he
,
like
*NL*
his
mother
,
had
an
adventure
that
changed
the
whole
*NL*
current
of
his
life
and
sent
him
out
of
his
quiet
*NL*
corner
into
the
world
.
The
shell
of
the
circumstances
*NL*
of
his
life
was
broken
and
he
was
compelled
to
start
*NL*
forth
.
He
left
Winesburg
and
no
one
there
ever
saw
him
*NL*
again
.
After
his
disappearance
,
his
mother
and
*NL*
grandfather
both
died
and
his
father
became
very
rich
.
*NL*
He
spent
much
money
in
trying
to
locate
his
son
,
but
*NL*
that
is
no
part
of
this
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
late
fall
of
an
unusual
year
on
the
*NL*
Bentley
farms
.
Everywhere
the
crops
had
been
heavy
.
*NL*
That
spring
,
Jesse
had
bought
part
of
a
long
strip
of
*NL*
black
swamp
land
that
lay
in
the
valley
of
Wine
Creek
.
*NL*
He
got
the
land
at
a
low
price
but
had
spent
a
large
*NL*
sum
of
money
to
improve
it
.
Great
ditches
had
to
be
dug
*NL*
and
thousands
of
tile
laid
.
Neighboring
farmers
shook
*NL*
their
heads
over
the
expense
.
Some
of
them
laughed
and
*NL*
hoped
that
Jesse
would
lose
heavily
by
the
venture
,
but
*NL*
the
old
man
went
silently
on
with
the
work
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
land
was
drained
he
planted
it
to
cabbages
and
*NL*
onions
,
and
again
the
neighbors
laughed
.
The
crop
was
,
*NL*
however
,
enormous
and
brought
high
prices
.
In
the
one
*NL*
year
Jesse
made
enough
money
to
pay
for
all
the
cost
of
*NL*
preparing
the
land
and
had
a
surplus
that
enabled
him
*NL*
to
buy
two
more
farms
.
He
was
exultant
and
could
not
*NL*
conceal
his
delight
.
For
the
first
time
in
all
the
*NL*
history
of
his
ownership
of
the
farms
,
he
went
among
*NL*
his
men
with
a
smiling
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
bought
a
great
many
new
machines
for
cutting
down
*NL*
the
cost
of
labor
and
all
of
the
remaining
acres
in
the
*NL*
strip
of
black
fertile
swamp
land
.
One
day
he
went
into
*NL*
Winesburg
and
bought
a
bicycle
and
a
new
suit
of
*NL*
clothes
for
David
and
he
gave
his
two
sisters
money
*NL*
with
which
to
go
to
a
religious
convention
at
*NL*
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fall
of
that
year
when
the
frost
came
and
the
*NL*
trees
in
the
forests
along
Wine
Creek
were
golden
*NL*
brown
,
David
spent
every
moment
when
he
did
not
have
to
*NL*
attend
school
,
out
in
the
open
.
Alone
or
with
other
*NL*
boys
he
went
every
afternoon
into
the
woods
to
gather
*NL*
nuts
.
The
other
boys
of
the
countryside
,
most
of
them
*NL*
sons
of
laborers
on
the
Bentley
farms
,
had
guns
with
*NL*
which
they
went
hunting
rabbits
and
squirrels
,
but
*NL*
David
did
not
go
with
them
.
He
made
himself
a
sling
*NL*
with
rubber
bands
and
a
forked
stick
and
went
off
by
*NL*
himself
to
gather
nuts
.
As
he
went
about
thoughts
came
*NL*
to
him
.
He
realized
that
he
was
almost
a
man
and
*NL*
wondered
what
he
would
do
in
life
,
but
before
they
came
*NL*
to
anything
,
the
thoughts
passed
and
he
was
a
boy
*NL*
again
.
One
day
he
killed
a
squirrel
that
sat
on
one
of
*NL*
the
lower
branches
of
a
tree
and
chattered
at
him
.
Home
*NL*
he
ran
with
the
squirrel
in
his
hand
.
One
of
the
*NL*
Bentley
sisters
cooked
the
little
animal
and
he
ate
it
*NL*
with
great
gusto
.
The
skin
he
tacked
on
a
board
and
*NL*
suspended
the
board
by
a
string
from
his
bedroom
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
gave
his
mind
a
new
turn
.
After
that
he
never
*NL*
went
into
the
woods
without
carrying
the
sling
in
his
*NL*
pocket
and
he
spent
hours
shooting
at
imaginary
animals
*NL*
concealed
among
the
brown
leaves
in
the
trees
.
Thoughts
*NL*
of
his
coming
manhood
passed
and
he
was
content
to
be
a
*NL*
boy
with
a
boy
's
impulses
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Saturday
morning
when
he
was
about
to
set
off
for
*NL*
the
woods
with
the
sling
in
his
pocket
and
a
bag
for
*NL*
nuts
on
his
shoulder
,
his
grandfather
stopped
him
.
In
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
was
the
strained
serious
look
*NL*
that
always
a
little
frightened
David
.
At
such
times
*NL*
Jesse
Bentley
's
eyes
did
not
look
straight
ahead
but
*NL*
wavered
and
seemed
to
be
looking
at
nothing
.
Something
*NL*
like
an
invisible
curtain
appeared
to
have
come
between
*NL*
the
man
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
``
I
want
you
to
*NL*
come
with
me
,
''
he
said
briefly
,
and
his
eyes
looked
*NL*
over
the
boy
's
head
into
the
sky
.
``
We
have
something
*NL*
important
to
do
today
.
You
may
bring
the
bag
for
nuts
*NL*
if
you
wish
.
It
does
not
matter
and
anyway
we
will
be
*NL*
going
into
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jesse
and
David
set
out
from
the
Bentley
farmhouse
in
*NL*
the
old
phaeton
that
was
drawn
by
the
white
horse
.
When
*NL*
they
had
gone
along
in
silence
for
a
long
way
they
*NL*
stopped
at
the
edge
of
a
field
where
a
flock
of
sheep
*NL*
were
grazing
.
Among
the
sheep
was
a
lamb
that
had
been
*NL*
born
out
of
season
,
and
this
David
and
his
grandfather
*NL*
caught
and
tied
so
tightly
that
it
looked
like
a
little
*NL*
white
ball
.
When
they
drove
on
again
Jesse
let
David
*NL*
hold
the
lamb
in
his
arms
.
``
I
saw
it
yesterday
and
it
*NL*
put
me
in
mind
of
what
I
have
long
wanted
to
do
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
and
again
he
looked
away
over
the
head
of
the
boy
*NL*
with
the
wavering
,
uncertain
stare
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
feeling
of
exaltation
that
had
come
to
the
*NL*
farmer
as
a
result
of
his
successful
year
,
another
mood
*NL*
had
taken
possession
of
him
.
For
a
long
time
he
had
*NL*
been
going
about
feeling
very
humble
and
prayerful
.
*NL*
Again
he
walked
alone
at
night
thinking
of
God
and
as
*NL*
he
walked
he
again
connected
his
own
figure
with
the
*NL*
figures
of
old
days
.
Under
the
stars
he
knelt
on
the
*NL*
wet
grass
and
raised
up
his
voice
in
prayer
.
Now
he
had
*NL*
decided
that
like
the
men
whose
stories
filled
the
*NL*
pages
of
the
Bible
,
he
would
make
a
sacrifice
to
God
.
*NL*
``
I
have
been
given
these
abundant
crops
and
God
has
*NL*
also
sent
me
a
boy
who
is
called
David
,
''
he
whispered
*NL*
to
himself
.
``
Perhaps
I
should
have
done
this
thing
long
*NL*
ago
.
''
He
was
sorry
the
idea
had
not
come
into
his
mind
*NL*
in
the
days
before
his
daughter
Louise
had
been
born
*NL*
and
thought
that
surely
now
when
he
had
erected
a
pile
*NL*
of
burning
sticks
in
some
lonely
place
in
the
woods
and
*NL*
had
offered
the
body
of
a
lamb
as
a
burnt
offering
,
God
*NL*
would
appear
to
him
and
give
him
a
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
and
more
as
he
thought
of
the
matter
,
he
thought
*NL*
also
of
David
and
his
passionate
self-love
was
*NL*
partially
forgotten
.
``
It
is
time
for
the
boy
to
begin
*NL*
thinking
of
going
out
into
the
world
and
the
message
*NL*
will
be
one
concerning
him
,
''
he
decided
.
``
God
will
make
*NL*
a
pathway
for
him
.
He
will
tell
me
what
place
David
is
*NL*
to
take
in
life
and
when
he
shall
set
out
on
his
*NL*
journey
.
It
is
right
that
the
boy
should
be
there
.
If
I
*NL*
am
fortunate
and
an
angel
of
God
should
appear
,
David
*NL*
will
see
the
beauty
and
glory
of
God
made
manifest
to
*NL*
man
.
It
will
make
a
true
man
of
God
of
him
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
Jesse
and
David
drove
along
the
road
until
*NL*
they
came
to
that
place
where
Jesse
had
once
before
*NL*
appealed
to
God
and
had
frightened
his
grandson
.
The
*NL*
morning
had
been
bright
and
cheerful
,
but
a
cold
wind
*NL*
now
began
to
blow
and
clouds
hid
the
sun
.
When
David
*NL*
saw
the
place
to
which
they
had
come
he
began
to
*NL*
tremble
with
fright
,
and
when
they
stopped
by
the
*NL*
bridge
where
the
creek
came
down
from
among
the
trees
,
*NL*
he
wanted
to
spring
out
of
the
phaeton
and
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dozen
plans
for
escape
ran
through
David
's
head
,
but
*NL*
when
Jesse
stopped
the
horse
and
climbed
over
the
fence
*NL*
into
the
wood
,
he
followed
.
``
It
is
foolish
to
be
*NL*
afraid
.
Nothing
will
happen
,
''
he
told
himself
as
he
*NL*
went
along
with
the
lamb
in
his
arms
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
the
helplessness
of
the
little
animal
held
*NL*
so
tightly
in
his
arms
that
gave
him
courage
.
He
could
*NL*
feel
the
rapid
beating
of
the
beast
's
heart
and
that
*NL*
made
his
own
heart
beat
less
rapidly
.
As
he
walked
*NL*
swiftly
along
behind
his
grandfather
,
he
untied
the
*NL*
string
with
which
the
four
legs
of
the
lamb
were
*NL*
fastened
together
.
``
If
anything
happens
we
will
run
*NL*
away
together
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
woods
,
after
they
had
gone
a
long
way
from
the
*NL*
road
,
Jesse
stopped
in
an
opening
among
the
trees
where
*NL*
a
clearing
,
overgrown
with
small
bushes
,
ran
up
from
*NL*
the
creek
.
He
was
still
silent
but
began
at
once
to
*NL*
erect
a
heap
of
dry
sticks
which
he
presently
set
*NL*
afire
.
The
boy
sat
on
the
ground
with
the
lamb
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
His
imagination
began
to
invest
every
movement
of
*NL*
the
old
man
with
significance
and
he
became
every
*NL*
moment
more
afraid
.
``
I
must
put
the
blood
of
the
lamb
*NL*
on
the
head
of
the
boy
,
''
Jesse
muttered
when
the
sticks
*NL*
had
begun
to
blaze
greedily
,
and
taking
a
long
knife
*NL*
from
his
pocket
he
turned
and
walked
rapidly
across
the
*NL*
clearing
toward
David
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terror
seized
upon
the
soul
of
the
boy
.
He
was
sick
*NL*
with
it
.
For
a
moment
he
sat
perfectly
still
and
then
*NL*
his
body
stiffened
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
.
His
face
*NL*
became
as
white
as
the
fleece
of
the
lamb
that
,
now
*NL*
finding
itself
suddenly
released
,
ran
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
David
ran
also
.
Fear
made
his
feet
fly
.
Over
the
low
*NL*
bushes
and
logs
he
leaped
frantically
.
As
he
ran
he
put
*NL*
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
took
out
the
branched
*NL*
stick
from
which
the
sling
for
shooting
squirrels
was
*NL*
suspended
.
When
he
came
to
the
creek
that
was
shallow
*NL*
and
splashed
down
over
the
stones
,
he
dashed
into
the
*NL*
water
and
turned
to
look
back
,
and
when
he
saw
his
*NL*
grandfather
still
running
toward
him
with
the
long
*NL*
knife
held
tightly
in
his
hand
he
did
not
hesitate
,
but
*NL*
reaching
down
,
selected
a
stone
and
put
it
in
the
*NL*
sling
.
With
all
his
strength
he
drew
back
the
heavy
*NL*
rubber
bands
and
the
stone
whistled
through
the
air
.
It
*NL*
hit
Jesse
,
who
had
entirely
forgotten
the
boy
and
was
*NL*
pursuing
the
lamb
,
squarely
in
the
head
.
With
a
groan
*NL*
he
pitched
forward
and
fell
almost
at
the
boy
's
feet
.
*NL*
When
David
saw
that
he
lay
still
and
that
he
was
*NL*
apparently
dead
,
his
fright
increased
immeasurably
.
It
*NL*
became
an
insane
panic
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
cry
he
turned
and
ran
off
through
the
woods
*NL*
weeping
convulsively
.
``
I
do
n't
care
--
I
killed
him
,
but
*NL*
I
do
n't
care
,
''
he
sobbed
.
As
he
ran
on
and
on
he
*NL*
decided
suddenly
that
he
would
never
go
back
again
to
*NL*
the
Bentley
farms
or
to
the
town
of
Winesburg
.
``
I
have
*NL*
killed
the
man
of
God
and
now
I
will
myself
be
a
man
*NL*
and
go
into
the
world
,
''
he
said
stoutly
as
he
stopped
*NL*
running
and
walked
rapidly
down
a
road
that
followed
*NL*
the
windings
of
Wine
Creek
as
it
ran
through
fields
and
*NL*
forests
into
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
ground
by
the
creek
Jesse
Bentley
moved
uneasily
*NL*
about
.
He
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
.
For
a
long
time
*NL*
he
lay
perfectly
still
and
looked
at
the
sky
.
When
at
*NL*
last
he
got
to
his
feet
,
his
mind
was
confused
and
he
*NL*
was
not
surprised
by
the
boy
's
disappearance
.
By
the
*NL*
roadside
he
sat
down
on
a
log
and
began
to
talk
about
*NL*
God
.
That
is
all
they
ever
got
out
of
him
.
Whenever
*NL*
David
's
name
was
mentioned
he
looked
vaguely
at
the
sky
*NL*
and
said
that
a
messenger
from
God
had
taken
the
boy
.
*NL*
``
It
happened
because
I
was
too
greedy
for
glory
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
,
and
would
have
no
more
to
say
in
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
MAN
OF
IDEAS
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
with
his
mother
,
a
grey
,
silent
woman
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
ashy
complexion
.
The
house
in
which
they
lived
*NL*
stood
in
a
little
grove
of
trees
beyond
where
the
main
*NL*
street
of
Winesburg
crossed
Wine
Creek
.
His
name
was
*NL*
Joe
Welling
,
and
his
father
had
been
a
man
of
some
*NL*
dignity
in
the
community
,
a
lawyer
,
and
a
member
of
the
*NL*
state
legislature
at
Columbus
.
Joe
himself
was
small
of
*NL*
body
and
in
his
character
unlike
anyone
else
in
town
.
*NL*
He
was
like
a
tiny
little
volcano
that
lies
silent
for
*NL*
days
and
then
suddenly
spouts
fire
.
No
,
he
was
n't
like
*NL*
that
--
he
was
like
a
man
who
is
subject
to
fits
,
one
*NL*
who
walks
among
his
fellow
men
inspiring
fear
because
a
*NL*
fit
may
come
upon
him
suddenly
and
blow
him
away
into
a
*NL*
strange
uncanny
physical
state
in
which
his
eyes
roll
*NL*
and
his
legs
and
arms
jerk
.
He
was
like
that
,
only
that
*NL*
the
visitation
that
descended
upon
Joe
Welling
was
a
*NL*
mental
and
not
a
physical
thing
.
He
was
beset
by
ideas
*NL*
and
in
the
throes
of
one
of
his
ideas
was
*NL*
uncontrollable
.
Words
rolled
and
tumbled
from
his
*NL*
mouth
.
A
peculiar
smile
came
upon
his
lips
.
The
edges
*NL*
of
his
teeth
that
were
tipped
with
gold
glistened
in
*NL*
the
light
.
Pouncing
upon
a
bystander
he
began
to
talk
.
*NL*
For
the
bystander
there
was
no
escape
.
The
excited
man
*NL*
breathed
into
his
face
,
peered
into
his
eyes
,
pounded
*NL*
upon
his
chest
with
a
shaking
forefinger
,
demanded
,
*NL*
compelled
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
those
days
the
Standard
Oil
Company
did
not
deliver
*NL*
oil
to
the
consumer
in
big
wagons
and
motor
trucks
as
*NL*
it
does
now
,
but
delivered
instead
to
retail
grocers
,
*NL*
hardware
stores
,
and
the
like
.
Joe
was
the
Standard
Oil
*NL*
agent
in
Winesburg
and
in
several
towns
up
and
down
the
*NL*
railroad
that
went
through
Winesburg
.
He
collected
*NL*
bills
,
booked
orders
,
and
did
other
things
.
His
father
,
*NL*
the
legislator
,
had
secured
the
job
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
and
out
of
the
stores
of
Winesburg
went
Joe
*NL*
Welling
--
silent
,
excessively
polite
,
intent
upon
his
*NL*
business
.
Men
watched
him
with
eyes
in
which
lurked
*NL*
amusement
tempered
by
alarm
.
They
were
waiting
for
him
*NL*
to
break
forth
,
preparing
to
flee
.
Although
the
*NL*
seizures
that
came
upon
him
were
harmless
enough
,
they
*NL*
could
not
be
laughed
away
.
They
were
overwhelming
.
*NL*
Astride
an
idea
,
Joe
was
overmastering
.
His
personality
*NL*
became
gigantic
.
It
overrode
the
man
to
whom
he
talked
,
*NL*
swept
him
away
,
swept
all
away
,
all
who
stood
within
*NL*
sound
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Sylvester
West
's
Drug
Store
stood
four
men
who
were
*NL*
talking
of
horse
racing
.
Wesley
Moyer
's
stallion
,
Tony
*NL*
Tip
,
was
to
race
at
the
June
meeting
at
Tiffin
,
Ohio
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
rumor
that
he
would
meet
the
stiffest
*NL*
competition
of
his
career
.
It
was
said
that
Pop
Geers
,
*NL*
the
great
racing
driver
,
would
himself
be
there
.
A
*NL*
doubt
of
the
success
of
Tony
Tip
hung
heavy
in
the
air
*NL*
of
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
the
drug
store
came
Joe
Welling
,
brushing
the
*NL*
screen
door
violently
aside
.
With
a
strange
absorbed
*NL*
light
in
his
eyes
he
pounced
upon
Ed
Thomas
,
he
who
*NL*
knew
Pop
Geers
and
whose
opinion
of
Tony
Tip
's
chances
*NL*
was
worth
considering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
water
is
up
in
Wine
Creek
,
''
cried
Joe
Welling
with
*NL*
the
air
of
Pheidippides
bringing
news
of
the
victory
of
*NL*
the
Greeks
in
the
struggle
at
Marathon
.
His
finger
beat
*NL*
a
tattoo
upon
Ed
Thomas
's
broad
chest
.
``
By
Trunion
*NL*
bridge
it
is
within
eleven
and
a
half
inches
of
the
*NL*
flooring
,
''
he
went
on
,
the
words
coming
quickly
and
*NL*
with
a
little
whistling
noise
from
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
An
expression
of
helpless
annoyance
crept
over
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
facts
correct
.
Depend
upon
that
.
I
went
to
*NL*
Sinnings
'
Hardware
Store
and
got
a
rule
.
Then
I
went
*NL*
back
and
measured
.
I
could
hardly
believe
my
own
eyes
.
*NL*
It
has
n't
rained
you
see
for
ten
days
.
At
first
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
what
to
think
.
Thoughts
rushed
through
my
*NL*
head
.
I
thought
of
subterranean
passages
and
springs
.
*NL*
Down
under
the
ground
went
my
mind
,
delving
about
.
I
*NL*
sat
on
the
floor
of
the
bridge
and
rubbed
my
head
.
*NL*
There
was
n't
a
cloud
in
the
sky
,
not
one
.
Come
out
into
*NL*
the
street
and
you
'll
see
.
There
was
n't
a
cloud
.
There
*NL*
is
n't
a
cloud
now
.
Yes
,
there
was
a
cloud
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
keep
back
any
facts
.
There
was
a
cloud
in
the
west
*NL*
down
near
the
horizon
,
a
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
's
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
There
it
is
,
you
see
.
You
understand
how
puzzled
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
an
idea
came
to
me
.
I
laughed
.
You
'll
laugh
,
*NL*
too
.
Of
course
it
rained
over
in
Medina
County
.
That
's
*NL*
interesting
,
eh
?
If
we
had
no
trains
,
no
mails
,
no
*NL*
telegraph
,
we
would
know
that
it
rained
over
in
Medina
*NL*
County
.
That
's
where
Wine
Creek
comes
from
.
Everyone
*NL*
knows
that
.
Little
old
Wine
Creek
brought
us
the
news
.
*NL*
That
's
interesting
.
I
laughed
.
I
thought
I
'd
tell
*NL*
you
--
it
's
interesting
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
Welling
turned
and
went
out
at
the
door
.
Taking
a
*NL*
book
from
his
pocket
,
he
stopped
and
ran
a
finger
down
*NL*
one
of
the
pages
.
Again
he
was
absorbed
in
his
duties
*NL*
as
agent
of
the
Standard
Oil
Company
.
``
Hern
's
Grocery
*NL*
will
be
getting
low
on
coal
oil
.
I
'll
see
them
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
,
hurrying
along
the
street
,
and
bowing
*NL*
politely
to
the
right
and
left
at
the
people
walking
*NL*
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
George
Willard
went
to
work
for
the
Winesburg
*NL*
Eagle
he
was
besieged
by
Joe
Welling
.
Joe
envied
the
*NL*
boy
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
meant
by
Nature
to
be
*NL*
a
reporter
on
a
newspaper
.
``
It
is
what
I
should
be
*NL*
doing
,
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
,
''
he
declared
,
*NL*
stopping
George
Willard
on
the
sidewalk
before
*NL*
Daugherty
's
Feed
Store
.
His
eyes
began
to
glisten
and
*NL*
his
forefinger
to
tremble
.
``
Of
course
I
make
more
money
*NL*
with
the
Standard
Oil
Company
and
I
'm
only
telling
*NL*
you
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
've
got
nothing
against
you
but
I
*NL*
should
have
your
place
.
I
could
do
the
work
at
odd
*NL*
moments
.
Here
and
there
I
would
run
finding
out
things
*NL*
you
'll
never
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Becoming
more
excited
Joe
Welling
crowded
the
young
*NL*
reporter
against
the
front
of
the
feed
store
.
He
*NL*
appeared
to
be
lost
in
thought
,
rolling
his
eyes
about
*NL*
and
running
a
thin
nervous
hand
through
his
hair
.
A
*NL*
smile
spread
over
his
face
and
his
gold
teeth
*NL*
glittered
.
``
You
get
out
your
note
book
,
''
he
commanded
.
*NL*
``
You
carry
a
little
pad
of
paper
in
your
pocket
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
?
I
knew
you
did
.
Well
,
you
set
this
down
.
I
thought
*NL*
of
it
the
other
day
.
Let
's
take
decay
.
Now
what
is
*NL*
decay
?
It
's
fire
.
It
burns
up
wood
and
other
things
.
*NL*
You
never
thought
of
that
?
Of
course
not
.
This
sidewalk
*NL*
here
and
this
feed
store
,
the
trees
down
the
street
*NL*
there
--
they
're
all
on
fire
.
They
're
burning
up
.
Decay
*NL*
you
see
is
always
going
on
.
It
does
n't
stop
.
Water
and
*NL*
paint
ca
n't
stop
it
.
If
a
thing
is
iron
,
then
what
?
It
*NL*
rusts
,
you
see
.
That
's
fire
,
too
.
The
world
is
on
fire
.
*NL*
Start
your
pieces
in
the
paper
that
way
.
Just
say
in
*NL*
big
letters
`
The
World
Is
On
Fire
.
'
That
will
make
'em
*NL*
look
up
.
They
'll
say
you
're
a
smart
one
.
I
do
n't
care
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
envy
you
.
I
just
snatched
that
idea
out
of
the
*NL*
air
.
I
would
make
a
newspaper
hum
.
You
got
to
admit
*NL*
that
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
quickly
,
Joe
Welling
walked
rapidly
away
.
When
*NL*
he
had
taken
several
steps
he
stopped
and
looked
back
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
stick
to
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
make
you
a
regular
hummer
.
I
should
start
a
newspaper
*NL*
myself
,
that
's
what
I
should
do
.
I
'd
be
a
marvel
.
*NL*
Everybody
knows
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
George
Willard
had
been
for
a
year
on
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
,
four
things
happened
to
Joe
Welling
.
*NL*
His
mother
died
,
he
came
to
live
at
the
New
Willard
*NL*
House
,
he
became
involved
in
a
love
affair
,
and
he
*NL*
organized
the
Winesburg
Baseball
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
organized
the
baseball
club
because
he
wanted
to
be
*NL*
a
coach
and
in
that
position
he
began
to
win
the
*NL*
respect
of
his
townsmen
.
``
He
is
a
wonder
,
''
they
*NL*
declared
after
Joe
's
team
had
whipped
the
team
from
*NL*
Medina
County
.
``
He
gets
everybody
working
together
.
You
*NL*
just
watch
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
baseball
field
Joe
Welling
stood
by
first
*NL*
base
,
his
whole
body
quivering
with
excitement
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
themselves
all
the
players
watched
him
*NL*
closely
.
The
opposing
pitcher
became
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
!
Now
!
Now
!
Now
!
''
shouted
the
excited
man
.
``
Watch
*NL*
me
!
Watch
me
!
Watch
my
fingers
!
Watch
my
hands
!
Watch
*NL*
my

Watch
my
eyes

Let
's
work
together
here

Watch
*NL*
me

In
me
you
see
all
the
movements
of
the
game

Work
*NL*
with
me
!
Work
with
me
!
Watch
me
!
Watch
me
!
Watch
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
runners
of
the
Winesburg
team
on
bases
,
Joe
*NL*
Welling
became
as
one
inspired
.
Before
they
knew
what
*NL*
had
come
over
them
,
the
base
runners
were
watching
the
*NL*
man
,
edging
off
the
bases
,
advancing
,
retreating
,
held
*NL*
as
by
an
invisible
cord
.
The
players
of
the
opposing
*NL*
team
also
watched
Joe
.
They
were
fascinated
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
they
watched
and
then
,
as
though
to
break
a
*NL*
spell
that
hung
over
them
,
they
began
hurling
the
ball
*NL*
wildly
about
,
and
amid
a
series
of
fierce
animal-like
*NL*
cries
from
the
coach
,
the
runners
of
the
Winesburg
team
*NL*
scampered
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
Welling
's
love
affair
set
the
town
of
Winesburg
on
*NL*
edge
.
When
it
began
everyone
whispered
and
shook
his
*NL*
head
.
When
people
tried
to
laugh
,
the
laughter
was
*NL*
forced
and
unnatural
.
Joe
fell
in
love
with
Sarah
King
,
*NL*
a
lean
,
sad-looking
woman
who
lived
with
her
father
and
*NL*
brother
in
a
brick
house
that
stood
opposite
the
gate
*NL*
leading
to
the
Winesburg
Cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Kings
,
Edward
the
father
,
and
Tom
the
son
,
were
*NL*
not
popular
in
Winesburg
.
They
were
called
proud
and
*NL*
dangerous
.
They
had
come
to
Winesburg
from
some
place
*NL*
in
the
South
and
ran
a
cider
mill
on
the
Trunion
Pike
.
*NL*
Tom
King
was
reported
to
have
killed
a
man
before
he
*NL*
came
to
Winesburg
.
He
was
twenty-seven
years
old
and
*NL*
rode
about
town
on
a
grey
pony
.
Also
he
had
a
long
*NL*
yellow
mustache
that
dropped
down
over
his
teeth
,
and
*NL*
always
carried
a
heavy
,
wicked-looking
walking
stick
in
*NL*
his
hand
.
Once
he
killed
a
dog
with
the
stick
.
The
dog
*NL*
belonged
to
Win
Pawsey
,
the
shoe
merchant
,
and
stood
on
*NL*
the
sidewalk
wagging
its
tail
.
Tom
King
killed
it
with
*NL*
one
blow
.
He
was
arrested
and
paid
a
fine
of
ten
*NL*
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Edward
King
was
small
of
stature
and
when
he
passed
*NL*
people
in
the
street
laughed
a
queer
unmirthful
laugh
.
*NL*
When
he
laughed
he
scratched
his
left
elbow
with
his
*NL*
right
hand
.
The
sleeve
of
his
coat
was
almost
worn
*NL*
through
from
the
habit
.
As
he
walked
along
the
street
,
*NL*
looking
nervously
about
and
laughing
,
he
seemed
more
*NL*
dangerous
than
his
silent
,
fierce-looking
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sarah
King
began
walking
out
in
the
evening
with
*NL*
Joe
Welling
,
people
shook
their
heads
in
alarm
.
She
was
*NL*
tall
and
pale
and
had
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
.
The
*NL*
couple
looked
ridiculous
together
.
Under
the
trees
they
*NL*
walked
and
Joe
talked
.
His
passionate
eager
*NL*
protestations
of
love
,
heard
coming
out
of
the
darkness
*NL*
by
the
cemetery
wall
,
or
from
the
deep
shadows
of
the
*NL*
trees
on
the
hill
that
ran
up
to
the
Fair
Grounds
from
*NL*
Waterworks
Pond
,
were
repeated
in
the
stores
.
Men
stood
*NL*
by
the
bar
in
the
New
Willard
House
laughing
and
*NL*
talking
of
Joe
's
courtship
.
After
the
laughter
came
the
*NL*
silence
.
The
Winesburg
baseball
team
,
under
his
*NL*
management
,
was
winning
game
after
game
,
and
the
town
*NL*
had
begun
to
respect
him
.
Sensing
a
tragedy
,
they
*NL*
waited
,
laughing
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
on
a
Saturday
afternoon
the
meeting
between
Joe
*NL*
Welling
and
the
two
Kings
,
the
anticipation
of
which
*NL*
had
set
the
town
on
edge
,
took
place
in
Joe
Welling
's
*NL*
room
in
the
New
Willard
House
.
George
Willard
was
a
*NL*
witness
to
the
meeting
.
It
came
about
in
this
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
reporter
went
to
his
room
after
the
*NL*
evening
meal
he
saw
Tom
King
and
his
father
sitting
in
*NL*
the
half
darkness
in
Joe
's
room
.
The
son
had
the
heavy
*NL*
walking
stick
in
his
hand
and
sat
near
the
door
.
Old
*NL*
Edward
King
walked
nervously
about
,
scratching
his
left
*NL*
elbow
with
his
right
hand
.
The
hallways
were
empty
and
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
went
to
his
own
room
and
sat
down
at
his
*NL*
desk
.
He
tried
to
write
but
his
hand
trembled
so
that
*NL*
he
could
not
hold
the
pen
.
He
also
walked
nervously
up
*NL*
and
down
.
Like
the
rest
of
the
town
of
Winesburg
he
was
*NL*
perplexed
and
knew
not
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
seven-thirty
and
fast
growing
dark
when
Joe
*NL*
Welling
came
along
the
station
platform
toward
the
New
*NL*
Willard
House
.
In
his
arms
he
held
a
bundle
of
weeds
*NL*
and
grasses
.
In
spite
of
the
terror
that
made
his
body
*NL*
shake
,
George
Willard
was
amused
at
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
small
spry
figure
holding
the
grasses
and
half
running
*NL*
along
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shaking
with
fright
and
anxiety
,
the
young
reporter
*NL*
lurked
in
the
hallway
outside
the
door
of
the
room
in
*NL*
which
Joe
Welling
talked
to
the
two
Kings
.
There
had
*NL*
been
an
oath
,
the
nervous
giggle
of
old
Edward
King
,
*NL*
and
then
silence
.
Now
the
voice
of
Joe
Welling
,
sharp
*NL*
and
clear
,
broke
forth
.
George
Willard
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
He
understood
.
As
he
had
swept
all
men
before
him
,
so
*NL*
now
Joe
Welling
was
carrying
the
two
men
in
the
room
*NL*
off
their
feet
with
a
tidal
wave
of
words
.
The
listener
*NL*
in
the
hall
walked
up
and
down
,
lost
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
the
room
Joe
Welling
had
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
the
grumbled
threat
of
Tom
King
.
Absorbed
in
an
idea
he
*NL*
closed
the
door
and
,
lighting
a
lamp
,
spread
the
*NL*
handful
of
weeds
and
grasses
upon
the
floor
.
``
I
've
got
*NL*
something
here
,
''
he
announced
solemnly
.
``
I
was
going
to
*NL*
tell
George
Willard
about
it
,
let
him
make
a
piece
out
*NL*
of
it
for
the
paper
.
I
'm
glad
you
're
here
.
I
wish
Sarah
*NL*
were
here
also
.
I
've
been
going
to
come
to
your
house
*NL*
and
tell
you
of
some
of
my
ideas
.
They
're
interesting
.
*NL*
Sarah
would
n't
let
me
.
She
said
we
'd
quarrel
.
That
's
*NL*
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Running
up
and
down
before
the
two
perplexed
men
,
Joe
*NL*
Welling
began
to
explain
.
``
Do
n't
you
make
a
mistake
*NL*
now
,
''
he
cried
.
``
This
is
something
big
.
''
His
voice
was
*NL*
shrill
with
excitement
.
``
You
just
follow
me
,
you
'll
be
*NL*
interested
.
I
know
you
will
.
Suppose
this
--
suppose
all
*NL*
of
the
wheat
,
the
corn
,
the
oats
,
the
peas
,
the
*NL*
potatoes
,
were
all
by
some
miracle
swept
away
.
Now
here
*NL*
we
are
,
you
see
,
in
this
county
.
There
is
a
high
fence
*NL*
built
all
around
us
.
We
'll
suppose
that
.
No
one
can
get
*NL*
over
the
fence
and
all
the
fruits
of
the
earth
are
*NL*
destroyed
,
nothing
left
but
these
wild
things
,
these
*NL*
grasses
.
Would
we
be
done
for
?
I
ask
you
that
.
Would
we
*NL*
be
done
for
?
''
Again
Tom
King
growled
and
for
a
moment
*NL*
there
was
silence
in
the
room
.
Then
again
Joe
plunged
*NL*
into
the
exposition
of
his
idea
.
``
Things
would
go
hard
*NL*
for
a
time
.
I
admit
that
.
I
've
got
to
admit
that
.
No
*NL*
getting
around
it
.
We
'd
be
hard
put
to
it
.
More
than
*NL*
one
fat
stomach
would
cave
in
.
But
they
could
n't
down
*NL*
us
.
I
should
say
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
King
laughed
good
naturedly
and
the
shivery
,
*NL*
nervous
laugh
of
Edward
King
rang
through
the
house
.
*NL*
Joe
Welling
hurried
on
.
``
We
'd
begin
,
you
see
,
to
breed
*NL*
up
new
vegetables
and
fruits
.
Soon
we
'd
regain
all
we
*NL*
had
lost
.
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
the
new
things
would
be
the
*NL*
same
as
the
old
.
They
would
n't
.
Maybe
they
'd
be
better
,
*NL*
maybe
not
so
good
.
That
's
interesting
,
eh
?
You
can
*NL*
think
about
that
.
It
starts
your
mind
working
,
now
*NL*
do
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
room
there
was
silence
and
then
again
old
Edward
*NL*
King
laughed
nervously
.
``
Say
,
I
wish
Sarah
was
here
,
''
*NL*
cried
Joe
Welling
.
``
Let
's
go
up
to
your
house
.
I
want
*NL*
to
tell
her
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
scraping
of
chairs
in
the
room
.
It
was
*NL*
then
that
George
Willard
retreated
to
his
own
room
.
*NL*
Leaning
out
at
the
window
he
saw
Joe
Welling
going
*NL*
along
the
street
with
the
two
Kings
.
Tom
King
was
*NL*
forced
to
take
extraordinary
long
strides
to
keep
pace
*NL*
with
the
little
man
.
As
he
strode
along
,
he
leaned
*NL*
over
,
listening
--
absorbed
,
fascinated
.
Joe
Welling
*NL*
again
talked
excitedly
.
``
Take
milkweed
now
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
``
A
lot
might
be
done
with
milkweed
,
eh
?
It
's
almost
*NL*
unbelievable
.
I
want
you
to
think
about
it
.
I
want
you
*NL*
two
to
think
about
it
.
There
would
be
a
new
vegetable
*NL*
kingdom
you
see
.
It
's
interesting
,
eh
?
It
's
an
idea
.
*NL*
Wait
till
you
see
Sarah
,
she
'll
get
the
idea
.
She
'll
be
*NL*
interested
.
Sarah
is
always
interested
in
ideas
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
be
too
smart
for
Sarah
,
now
can
you
?
Of
course
*NL*
you
ca
n't
.
You
know
that

ADVENTURE
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
Hindman
,
a
woman
of
twenty-seven
when
George
*NL*
Willard
was
a
mere
boy
,
had
lived
in
Winesburg
all
her
*NL*
life
.
She
clerked
in
Winney
's
Dry
Goods
Store
and
lived
*NL*
with
her
mother
,
who
had
married
a
second
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
's
step-father
was
a
carriage
painter
,
and
given
*NL*
to
drink
.
His
story
is
an
odd
one
.
It
will
be
worth
*NL*
telling
some
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twenty-seven
Alice
was
tall
and
somewhat
slight
.
*NL*
Her
head
was
large
and
overshadowed
her
body
.
Her
*NL*
shoulders
were
a
little
stooped
and
her
hair
and
eyes
*NL*
brown
.
She
was
very
quiet
but
beneath
a
placid
exterior
*NL*
a
continual
ferment
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
before
she
began
to
*NL*
work
in
the
store
,
Alice
had
an
affair
with
a
young
*NL*
man
.
The
young
man
,
named
Ned
Currie
,
was
older
than
*NL*
Alice
.
He
,
like
George
Willard
,
was
employed
on
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
and
for
a
long
time
he
went
to
see
*NL*
Alice
almost
every
evening
.
Together
the
two
walked
*NL*
under
the
trees
through
the
streets
of
the
town
and
*NL*
talked
of
what
they
would
do
with
their
lives
.
Alice
*NL*
was
then
a
very
pretty
girl
and
Ned
Currie
took
her
*NL*
into
his
arms
and
kissed
her
.
He
became
excited
and
*NL*
said
things
he
did
not
intend
to
say
and
Alice
,
*NL*
betrayed
by
her
desire
to
have
something
beautiful
come
*NL*
into
her
rather
narrow
life
,
also
grew
excited
.
She
*NL*
also
talked
.
The
outer
crust
of
her
life
,
all
of
her
*NL*
natural
diffidence
and
reserve
,
was
torn
away
and
she
*NL*
gave
herself
over
to
the
emotions
of
love
.
When
,
late
*NL*
in
the
fall
of
her
sixteenth
year
,
Ned
Currie
went
away
*NL*
to
Cleveland
where
he
hoped
to
get
a
place
on
a
city
*NL*
newspaper
and
rise
in
the
world
,
she
wanted
to
go
with
*NL*
him
.
With
a
trembling
voice
she
told
him
what
was
in
*NL*
her
mind
.
``
I
will
work
and
you
can
work
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
*NL*
do
not
want
to
harness
you
to
a
needless
expense
that
*NL*
will
prevent
your
making
progress
.
Do
n't
marry
me
now
.
*NL*
We
will
get
along
without
that
and
we
can
be
together
.
*NL*
Even
though
we
live
in
the
same
house
no
one
will
say
*NL*
anything
.
In
the
city
we
will
be
unknown
and
people
*NL*
will
pay
no
attention
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Currie
was
puzzled
by
the
determination
and
abandon
*NL*
of
his
sweetheart
and
was
also
deeply
touched
.
He
had
*NL*
wanted
the
girl
to
become
his
mistress
but
changed
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
wanted
to
protect
and
care
for
her
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
you
're
talking
about
,
''
he
said
sharply
;
``
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
I
'll
let
you
do
no
such
thing
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
get
a
good
job
I
'll
come
back
.
For
the
present
you
'll
*NL*
have
to
stay
here
.
It
's
the
only
thing
we
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
before
he
left
Winesburg
to
take
up
his
*NL*
new
life
in
the
city
,
Ned
Currie
went
to
call
on
Alice
.
*NL*
They
walked
about
through
the
streets
for
an
hour
and
*NL*
then
got
a
rig
from
Wesley
Moyer
's
livery
and
went
for
*NL*
a
drive
in
the
country
.
The
moon
came
up
and
they
found
*NL*
themselves
unable
to
talk
.
In
his
sadness
the
young
man
*NL*
forgot
the
resolutions
he
had
made
regarding
his
*NL*
conduct
with
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
out
of
the
buggy
at
a
place
where
a
long
*NL*
meadow
ran
down
to
the
bank
of
Wine
Creek
and
there
in
*NL*
the
dim
light
became
lovers
.
When
at
midnight
they
*NL*
returned
to
town
they
were
both
glad
.
It
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
them
that
anything
that
could
happen
in
the
future
*NL*
could
blot
out
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
the
thing
that
*NL*
had
happened
.
``
Now
we
will
have
to
stick
to
each
other
,
*NL*
whatever
happens
we
will
have
to
do
that
,
''
Ned
Currie
*NL*
said
as
he
left
the
girl
at
her
father
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
newspaper
man
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
*NL*
place
on
a
Cleveland
paper
and
went
west
to
Chicago
.
*NL*
For
a
time
he
was
lonely
and
wrote
to
Alice
almost
*NL*
every
day
.
Then
he
was
caught
up
by
the
life
of
the
*NL*
city
;
he
began
to
make
friends
and
found
new
interests
*NL*
in
life
.
In
Chicago
he
boarded
at
a
house
where
there
*NL*
were
several
women
.
One
of
them
attracted
his
attention
*NL*
and
he
forgot
Alice
in
Winesburg
.
At
the
end
of
a
year
*NL*
he
had
stopped
writing
letters
,
and
only
once
in
a
long
*NL*
time
,
when
he
was
lonely
or
when
he
went
into
one
of
*NL*
the
city
parks
and
saw
the
moon
shining
on
the
grass
as
*NL*
it
had
shone
that
night
on
the
meadow
by
Wine
Creek
,
*NL*
did
he
think
of
her
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
the
girl
who
had
been
loved
grew
to
be
a
*NL*
woman
.
When
she
was
twenty-two
years
old
her
father
,
*NL*
who
owned
a
harness
repair
shop
,
died
suddenly
.
The
*NL*
harness
maker
was
an
old
soldier
,
and
after
a
few
*NL*
months
his
wife
received
a
widow
's
pension
.
She
used
*NL*
the
first
money
she
got
to
buy
a
loom
and
became
a
*NL*
weaver
of
carpets
,
and
Alice
got
a
place
in
Winney
's
*NL*
store
.
For
a
number
of
years
nothing
could
have
induced
*NL*
her
to
believe
that
Ned
Currie
would
not
in
the
end
*NL*
return
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
glad
to
be
employed
because
the
daily
round
of
*NL*
toil
in
the
store
made
the
time
of
waiting
seem
less
*NL*
long
and
uninteresting
.
She
began
to
save
money
,
*NL*
thinking
that
when
she
had
saved
two
or
three
hundred
*NL*
dollars
she
would
follow
her
lover
to
the
city
and
try
*NL*
if
her
presence
would
not
win
back
his
affections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
not
blame
Ned
Currie
for
what
had
happened
in
*NL*
the
moonlight
in
the
field
,
but
felt
that
she
could
*NL*
never
marry
another
man
.
To
her
the
thought
of
giving
*NL*
to
another
what
she
still
felt
could
belong
only
to
Ned
*NL*
seemed
monstrous
.
When
other
young
men
tried
to
attract
*NL*
her
attention
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
*NL*
``
I
am
his
wife
and
shall
remain
his
wife
whether
he
*NL*
comes
back
or
not
,
''
she
whispered
to
herself
,
and
for
*NL*
all
of
her
willingness
to
support
herself
could
not
*NL*
have
understood
the
growing
modern
idea
of
a
woman
's
*NL*
owning
herself
and
giving
and
taking
for
her
own
ends
*NL*
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
worked
in
the
dry
goods
store
from
eight
in
the
*NL*
morning
until
six
at
night
and
on
three
evenings
a
week
*NL*
went
back
to
the
store
to
stay
from
seven
until
nine
.
*NL*
As
time
passed
and
she
became
more
and
more
lonely
she
*NL*
began
to
practice
the
devices
common
to
lonely
people
.
*NL*
When
at
night
she
went
upstairs
into
her
own
room
she
*NL*
knelt
on
the
floor
to
pray
and
in
her
prayers
whispered
*NL*
things
she
wanted
to
say
to
her
lover
.
She
became
*NL*
attached
to
inanimate
objects
,
and
because
it
was
her
*NL*
own
,
could
not
bare
to
have
anyone
touch
the
furniture
*NL*
of
her
room
.
The
trick
of
saving
money
,
begun
for
a
*NL*
purpose
,
was
carried
on
after
the
scheme
of
going
to
*NL*
the
city
to
find
Ned
Currie
had
been
given
up
.
It
*NL*
became
a
fixed
habit
,
and
when
she
needed
new
clothes
*NL*
she
did
not
get
them
.
Sometimes
on
rainy
afternoons
in
*NL*
the
store
she
got
out
her
bank
book
and
,
letting
it
lie
*NL*
open
before
her
,
spent
hours
dreaming
impossible
dreams
*NL*
of
saving
money
enough
so
that
the
interest
would
*NL*
support
both
herself
and
her
future
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ned
always
liked
to
travel
about
,
''
she
thought
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
give
him
the
chance
.
Some
day
when
we
are
married
and
I
*NL*
can
save
both
his
money
and
my
own
,
we
will
be
rich
.
*NL*
Then
we
can
travel
together
all
over
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dry
goods
store
weeks
ran
into
months
and
months
*NL*
into
years
as
Alice
waited
and
dreamed
of
her
lover
's
*NL*
return
.
Her
employer
,
a
grey
old
man
with
false
teeth
*NL*
and
a
thin
grey
mustache
that
drooped
down
over
his
*NL*
mouth
,
was
not
given
to
conversation
,
and
sometimes
,
on
*NL*
rainy
days
and
in
the
winter
when
a
storm
raged
in
Main
*NL*
Street
,
long
hours
passed
when
no
customers
came
in
.
*NL*
Alice
arranged
and
rearranged
the
stock
.
She
stood
near
*NL*
the
front
window
where
she
could
look
down
the
deserted
*NL*
street
and
thought
of
the
evenings
when
she
had
walked
*NL*
with
Ned
Currie
and
of
what
he
had
said
.
``
We
will
have
*NL*
to
stick
to
each
other
now
.
''
The
words
echoed
and
*NL*
re-echoed
through
the
mind
of
the
maturing
woman
.
Tears
*NL*
came
into
her
eyes
.
Sometimes
when
her
employer
had
*NL*
gone
out
and
she
was
alone
in
the
store
she
put
her
*NL*
head
on
the
counter
and
wept
.
``
Oh
,
Ned
,
I
am
waiting
,
''
*NL*
she
whispered
over
and
over
,
and
all
the
time
the
*NL*
creeping
fear
that
he
would
never
come
back
grew
*NL*
stronger
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
when
the
rains
have
passed
and
before
the
*NL*
long
hot
days
of
summer
have
come
,
the
country
about
*NL*
Winesburg
is
delightful
.
The
town
lies
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
open
fields
,
but
beyond
the
fields
are
pleasant
patches
*NL*
of
woodlands
.
In
the
wooded
places
are
many
little
*NL*
cloistered
nooks
,
quiet
places
where
lovers
go
to
sit
*NL*
on
Sunday
afternoons
.
Through
the
trees
they
look
out
*NL*
across
the
fields
and
see
farmers
at
work
about
the
*NL*
barns
or
people
driving
up
and
down
on
the
roads
.
In
*NL*
the
town
bells
ring
and
occasionally
a
train
passes
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
toy
thing
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
years
after
Ned
Currie
went
away
Alice
did
*NL*
not
go
into
the
wood
with
the
other
young
people
on
*NL*
Sunday
,
but
one
day
after
he
had
been
gone
for
two
or
*NL*
three
years
and
when
her
loneliness
seemed
unbearable
,
*NL*
she
put
on
her
best
dress
and
set
out
.
Finding
a
little
*NL*
sheltered
place
from
which
she
could
see
the
town
and
a
*NL*
long
stretch
of
the
fields
,
she
sat
down
.
Fear
of
age
*NL*
and
ineffectuality
took
possession
of
her
.
She
could
*NL*
not
sit
still
,
and
arose
.
As
she
stood
looking
out
over
*NL*
the
land
something
,
perhaps
the
thought
of
never
*NL*
ceasing
life
as
it
expresses
itself
in
the
flow
of
the
*NL*
seasons
,
fixed
her
mind
on
the
passing
years
.
With
a
*NL*
shiver
of
dread
,
she
realized
that
for
her
the
beauty
*NL*
and
freshness
of
youth
had
passed
.
For
the
first
time
*NL*
she
felt
that
she
had
been
cheated
.
She
did
not
blame
*NL*
Ned
Currie
and
did
not
know
what
to
blame
.
Sadness
*NL*
swept
over
her
.
Dropping
to
her
knees
,
she
tried
to
*NL*
pray
,
but
instead
of
prayers
words
of
protest
came
to
*NL*
her
lips
.
``
It
is
not
going
to
come
to
me
.
I
will
never
*NL*
find
happiness
.
Why
do
I
tell
myself
lies
?
''
she
cried
,
*NL*
and
an
odd
sense
of
relief
came
with
this
,
her
first
*NL*
bold
attempt
to
face
the
fear
that
had
become
a
part
of
*NL*
her
everyday
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
year
when
Alice
Hindman
became
twenty-five
two
*NL*
things
happened
to
disturb
the
dull
uneventfulness
of
*NL*
her
days
.
Her
mother
married
Bush
Milton
,
the
carriage
*NL*
painter
of
Winesburg
,
and
she
herself
became
a
member
*NL*
of
the
Winesburg
Methodist
Church
.
Alice
joined
the
*NL*
church
because
she
had
become
frightened
by
the
*NL*
loneliness
of
her
position
in
life
.
Her
mother
's
second
*NL*
marriage
had
emphasized
her
isolation
.
``
I
am
becoming
*NL*
old
and
queer
.
If
Ned
comes
he
will
not
want
me
.
In
the
*NL*
city
where
he
is
living
men
are
perpetually
young
.
*NL*
There
is
so
much
going
on
that
they
do
not
have
time
to
*NL*
grow
old
,
''
she
told
herself
with
a
grim
little
smile
,
*NL*
and
went
resolutely
about
the
business
of
becoming
*NL*
acquainted
with
people
.
Every
Thursday
evening
when
the
*NL*
store
had
closed
she
went
to
a
prayer
meeting
in
the
*NL*
basement
of
the
church
and
on
Sunday
evening
attended
a
*NL*
meeting
of
an
organization
called
The
Epworth
League
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Will
Hurley
,
a
middle-aged
man
who
clerked
in
a
*NL*
drug
store
and
who
also
belonged
to
the
church
,
offered
*NL*
to
walk
home
with
her
she
did
not
protest
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
will
not
let
him
make
a
practice
of
being
with
me
,
but
*NL*
if
he
comes
to
see
me
once
in
a
long
time
there
can
be
*NL*
no
harm
in
that
,
''
she
told
herself
,
still
determined
in
*NL*
her
loyalty
to
Ned
Currie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
realizing
what
was
happening
,
Alice
was
trying
*NL*
feebly
at
first
,
but
with
growing
determination
,
to
get
*NL*
a
new
hold
upon
life
.
Beside
the
drug
clerk
she
walked
*NL*
in
silence
,
but
sometimes
in
the
darkness
as
they
went
*NL*
stolidly
along
she
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
softly
*NL*
the
folds
of
his
coat
.
When
he
left
her
at
the
gate
*NL*
before
her
mother
's
house
she
did
not
go
indoors
,
but
*NL*
stood
for
a
moment
by
the
door
.
She
wanted
to
call
to
*NL*
the
drug
clerk
,
to
ask
him
to
sit
with
her
in
the
*NL*
darkness
on
the
porch
before
the
house
,
but
was
afraid
*NL*
he
would
not
understand
.
``
It
is
not
him
that
I
want
,
''
*NL*
she
told
herself
;
``
I
want
to
avoid
being
so
much
alone
.
*NL*
If
I
am
not
careful
I
will
grow
unaccustomed
to
being
*NL*
with
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
early
fall
of
her
twenty-seventh
year
a
*NL*
passionate
restlessness
took
possession
of
Alice
.
She
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
be
in
the
company
of
the
drug
clerk
,
*NL*
and
when
,
in
the
evening
,
he
came
to
walk
with
her
she
*NL*
sent
him
away
.
Her
mind
became
intensely
active
and
*NL*
when
,
weary
from
the
long
hours
of
standing
behind
the
*NL*
counter
in
the
store
,
she
went
home
and
crawled
into
*NL*
bed
,
she
could
not
sleep
.
With
staring
eyes
she
looked
*NL*
into
the
darkness
.
Her
imagination
,
like
a
child
*NL*
awakened
from
long
sleep
,
played
about
the
room
.
Deep
*NL*
within
her
there
was
something
that
would
not
be
*NL*
cheated
by
phantasies
and
that
demanded
some
definite
*NL*
answer
from
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
took
a
pillow
into
her
arms
and
held
it
tightly
*NL*
against
her
breasts
.
Getting
out
of
bed
,
she
arranged
a
*NL*
blanket
so
that
in
the
darkness
it
looked
like
a
form
*NL*
lying
between
the
sheets
and
,
kneeling
beside
the
bed
,
*NL*
she
caressed
it
,
whispering
words
over
and
over
,
like
a
*NL*
refrain
.
``
Why
does
n't
something
happen
?
Why
am
I
left
*NL*
here
alone
?
''
she
muttered
.
Although
she
sometimes
*NL*
thought
of
Ned
Currie
,
she
no
longer
depended
on
him
.
*NL*
Her
desire
had
grown
vague
.
She
did
not
want
Ned
Currie
*NL*
or
any
other
man
.
She
wanted
to
be
loved
,
to
have
*NL*
something
answer
the
call
that
was
growing
louder
and
*NL*
louder
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
one
night
when
it
rained
Alice
had
an
*NL*
adventure
.
It
frightened
and
confused
her
.
She
had
come
*NL*
home
from
the
store
at
nine
and
found
the
house
empty
.
*NL*
Bush
Milton
had
gone
off
to
town
and
her
mother
to
the
*NL*
house
of
a
neighbor
.
Alice
went
upstairs
to
her
room
*NL*
and
undressed
in
the
darkness
.
For
a
moment
she
stood
*NL*
by
the
window
hearing
the
rain
beat
against
the
glass
*NL*
and
then
a
strange
desire
took
possession
of
her
.
*NL*
Without
stopping
to
think
of
what
she
intended
to
do
,
*NL*
she
ran
downstairs
through
the
dark
house
and
out
into
*NL*
the
rain
.
As
she
stood
on
the
little
grass
plot
before
*NL*
the
house
and
felt
the
cold
rain
on
her
body
a
mad
*NL*
desire
to
run
naked
through
the
streets
took
possession
*NL*
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
that
the
rain
would
have
some
creative
and
*NL*
wonderful
effect
on
her
body
.
Not
for
years
had
she
*NL*
felt
so
full
of
youth
and
courage
.
She
wanted
to
leap
*NL*
and
run
,
to
cry
out
,
to
find
some
other
lonely
human
*NL*
and
embrace
him
.
On
the
brick
sidewalk
before
the
house
*NL*
a
man
stumbled
homeward
.
Alice
started
to
run
.
A
wild
,
*NL*
desperate
mood
took
possession
of
her
.
``
What
do
I
care
*NL*
who
it
is
.
He
is
alone
,
and
I
will
go
to
him
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
;
and
then
without
stopping
to
consider
the
*NL*
possible
result
of
her
madness
,
called
softly
.
``
Wait
!
''
*NL*
she
cried
.
``
Do
n't
go
away
.
Whoever
you
are
,
you
must
*NL*
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
on
the
sidewalk
stopped
and
stood
listening
.
*NL*
He
was
an
old
man
and
somewhat
deaf
.
Putting
his
hand
*NL*
to
his
mouth
,
he
shouted
.
``
What
?
What
say
?
''
he
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
dropped
to
the
ground
and
lay
trembling
.
She
was
*NL*
so
frightened
at
the
thought
of
what
she
had
done
that
*NL*
when
the
man
had
gone
on
his
way
she
did
not
dare
get
*NL*
to
her
feet
,
but
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
through
the
*NL*
grass
to
the
house
.
When
she
got
to
her
own
room
she
*NL*
bolted
the
door
and
drew
her
dressing
table
across
the
*NL*
doorway
.
Her
body
shook
as
with
a
chill
and
her
hands
*NL*
trembled
so
that
she
had
difficulty
getting
into
her
*NL*
nightdress
.
When
she
got
into
bed
she
buried
her
face
*NL*
in
the
pillow
and
wept
brokenheartedly
.
``
What
is
the
*NL*
matter
with
me
?
I
will
do
something
dreadful
if
I
am
*NL*
not
careful
,
''
she
thought
,
and
turning
her
face
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
began
trying
to
force
herself
to
face
bravely
the
*NL*
fact
that
many
people
must
live
and
die
alone
,
even
in
*NL*
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
RESPECTABILITY
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
have
lived
in
cities
and
have
walked
in
the
park
*NL*
on
a
summer
afternoon
,
you
have
perhaps
seen
,
blinking
*NL*
in
a
corner
of
his
iron
cage
,
a
huge
,
grotesque
kind
of
*NL*
monkey
,
a
creature
with
ugly
,
sagging
,
hairless
skin
*NL*
below
his
eyes
and
a
bright
purple
underbody
.
This
*NL*
monkey
is
a
true
monster
.
In
the
completeness
of
his
*NL*
ugliness
he
achieved
a
kind
of
perverted
beauty
.
*NL*
Children
stopping
before
the
cage
are
fascinated
,
men
*NL*
turn
away
with
an
air
of
disgust
,
and
women
linger
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
trying
perhaps
to
remember
which
one
of
their
*NL*
male
acquaintances
the
thing
in
some
faint
way
*NL*
resembles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
you
been
in
the
earlier
years
of
your
life
a
*NL*
citizen
of
the
village
of
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
there
would
*NL*
have
been
for
you
no
mystery
in
regard
to
the
beast
in
*NL*
his
cage
.
``
It
is
like
Wash
Williams
,
''
you
would
have
*NL*
said
.
``
As
he
sits
in
the
corner
there
,
the
beast
is
*NL*
exactly
like
old
Wash
sitting
on
the
grass
in
the
*NL*
station
yard
on
a
summer
evening
after
he
has
closed
*NL*
his
office
for
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
,
the
telegraph
operator
of
Winesburg
,
was
*NL*
the
ugliest
thing
in
town
.
His
girth
was
immense
,
his
*NL*
neck
thin
,
his
legs
feeble
.
He
was
dirty
.
Everything
*NL*
about
him
was
unclean
.
Even
the
whites
of
his
eyes
*NL*
looked
soiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
go
too
fast
.
Not
everything
about
Wash
was
unclean
.
*NL*
He
took
care
of
his
hands
.
His
fingers
were
fat
,
but
*NL*
there
was
something
sensitive
and
shapely
in
the
hand
*NL*
that
lay
on
the
table
by
the
instrument
in
the
*NL*
telegraph
office
.
In
his
youth
Wash
Williams
had
been
*NL*
called
the
best
telegraph
operator
in
the
state
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
degradement
to
the
obscure
office
at
*NL*
Winesburg
,
he
was
still
proud
of
his
ability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
did
not
associate
with
the
men
of
the
*NL*
town
in
which
he
lived
.
``
I
'll
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
them
,
''
he
said
,
looking
with
bleary
eyes
at
the
men
who
*NL*
walked
along
the
station
platform
past
the
telegraph
*NL*
office
.
Up
along
Main
Street
he
went
in
the
evening
to
*NL*
Ed
Griffith
's
saloon
,
and
after
drinking
unbelievable
*NL*
quantities
of
beer
staggered
off
to
his
room
in
the
New
*NL*
Willard
House
and
to
his
bed
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
was
a
man
of
courage
.
A
thing
had
*NL*
happened
to
him
that
made
him
hate
life
,
and
he
hated
*NL*
it
wholeheartedly
,
with
the
abandon
of
a
poet
.
First
of
*NL*
all
,
he
hated
women
.
``
Bitches
,
''
he
called
them
.
His
*NL*
feeling
toward
men
was
somewhat
different
.
He
pitied
*NL*
them
.
``
Does
not
every
man
let
his
life
be
managed
for
*NL*
him
by
some
bitch
or
another
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
no
attention
was
paid
to
Wash
Williams
and
*NL*
his
hatred
of
his
fellows
.
Once
Mrs.
White
,
the
*NL*
banker
's
wife
,
complained
to
the
telegraph
company
,
*NL*
saying
that
the
office
in
Winesburg
was
dirty
and
*NL*
smelled
abominably
,
but
nothing
came
of
her
complaint
.
*NL*
Here
and
there
a
man
respected
the
operator
.
*NL*
Instinctively
the
man
felt
in
him
a
glowing
resentment
*NL*
of
something
he
had
not
the
courage
to
resent
.
When
*NL*
Wash
walked
through
the
streets
such
a
one
had
an
*NL*
instinct
to
pay
him
homage
,
to
raise
his
hat
or
to
bow
*NL*
before
him
.
The
superintendent
who
had
supervision
over
*NL*
the
telegraph
operators
on
the
railroad
that
went
*NL*
through
Winesburg
felt
that
way
.
He
had
put
Wash
into
*NL*
the
obscure
office
at
Winesburg
to
avoid
discharging
*NL*
him
,
and
he
meant
to
keep
him
there
.
When
he
received
*NL*
the
letter
of
complaint
from
the
banker
's
wife
,
he
tore
*NL*
it
up
and
laughed
unpleasantly
.
For
some
reason
he
*NL*
thought
of
his
own
wife
as
he
tore
up
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
once
had
a
wife
.
When
he
was
still
a
*NL*
young
man
he
married
a
woman
at
Dayton
,
Ohio
.
The
woman
*NL*
was
tall
and
slender
and
had
blue
eyes
and
yellow
hair
.
*NL*
Wash
was
himself
a
comely
youth
.
He
loved
the
woman
*NL*
with
a
love
as
absorbing
as
the
hatred
he
later
felt
*NL*
for
all
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
of
Winesburg
there
was
but
one
person
who
knew
*NL*
the
story
of
the
thing
that
had
made
ugly
the
person
*NL*
and
the
character
of
Wash
Williams
.
He
once
told
the
*NL*
story
to
George
Willard
and
the
telling
of
the
tale
*NL*
came
about
in
this
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
went
one
evening
to
walk
with
Belle
*NL*
Carpenter
,
a
trimmer
of
women
's
hats
who
worked
in
a
*NL*
millinery
shop
kept
by
Mrs.
Kate
McHugh
.
The
young
man
*NL*
was
not
in
love
with
the
woman
,
who
,
in
fact
,
had
a
*NL*
suitor
who
worked
as
bartender
in
Ed
Griffith
's
saloon
,
*NL*
but
as
they
walked
about
under
the
trees
they
*NL*
occasionally
embraced
.
The
night
and
their
own
thoughts
*NL*
had
aroused
something
in
them
.
As
they
were
returning
*NL*
to
Main
Street
they
passed
the
little
lawn
beside
the
*NL*
railroad
station
and
saw
Wash
Williams
apparently
*NL*
asleep
on
the
grass
beneath
a
tree
.
On
the
next
evening
*NL*
the
operator
and
George
Willard
walked
out
together
.
*NL*
Down
the
railroad
they
went
and
sat
on
a
pile
of
*NL*
decaying
railroad
ties
beside
the
tracks
.
It
was
then
*NL*
that
the
operator
told
the
young
reporter
his
story
of
*NL*
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
a
dozen
times
George
Willard
and
the
strange
,
*NL*
shapeless
man
who
lived
at
his
father
's
hotel
had
been
*NL*
on
the
point
of
talking
.
The
young
man
looked
at
the
*NL*
hideous
,
leering
face
staring
about
the
hotel
dining
*NL*
room
and
was
consumed
with
curiosity
.
Something
he
saw
*NL*
lurking
in
the
staring
eyes
told
him
that
the
man
who
*NL*
had
nothing
to
say
to
others
had
nevertheless
something
*NL*
to
say
to
him
.
On
the
pile
of
railroad
ties
on
the
*NL*
summer
evening
,
he
waited
expectantly
.
When
the
*NL*
operator
remained
silent
and
seemed
to
have
changed
his
*NL*
mind
about
talking
,
he
tried
to
make
conversation
.
*NL*
``
Were
you
ever
married
,
Mr.
Williams
?
''
he
began
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
you
were
and
your
wife
is
dead
,
is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
spat
forth
a
succession
of
vile
oaths
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
dead
,
''
he
agreed
.
``
She
is
dead
as
all
*NL*
women
are
dead
.
She
is
a
living-dead
thing
,
walking
in
*NL*
the
sight
of
men
and
making
the
earth
foul
by
her
*NL*
presence
.
''
Staring
into
the
boy
's
eyes
,
the
man
became
*NL*
purple
with
rage
.
``
Do
n't
have
fool
notions
in
your
*NL*
head
,
''
he
commanded
.
``
My
wife
,
she
is
dead
;
yes
,
*NL*
surely
.
I
tell
you
,
all
women
are
dead
,
my
mother
,
your
*NL*
mother
,
that
tall
dark
woman
who
works
in
the
millinery
*NL*
store
and
with
whom
I
saw
you
walking
about
*NL*
yesterday
--
all
of
them
,
they
are
all
dead
.
I
tell
you
*NL*
there
is
something
rotten
about
them
.
I
was
married
,
*NL*
sure
.
My
wife
was
dead
before
she
married
me
,
she
was
a
*NL*
foul
thing
come
out
a
woman
more
foul
.
She
was
a
thing
*NL*
sent
to
make
life
unbearable
to
me
.
I
was
a
fool
,
do
*NL*
you
see
,
as
you
are
now
,
and
so
I
married
this
woman
.
I
*NL*
would
like
to
see
men
a
little
begin
to
understand
*NL*
women
.
They
are
sent
to
prevent
men
making
the
world
*NL*
worth
while
.
It
is
a
trick
in
Nature
.
Ugh
!
They
are
*NL*
creeping
,
crawling
,
squirming
things
,
they
with
their
*NL*
soft
hands
and
their
blue
eyes
.
The
sight
of
a
woman
*NL*
sickens
me
.
Why
I
do
n't
kill
every
woman
I
see
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
frightened
and
yet
fascinated
by
the
light
burning
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
the
hideous
old
man
,
George
Willard
*NL*
listened
,
afire
with
curiosity
.
Darkness
came
on
and
he
*NL*
leaned
forward
trying
to
see
the
face
of
the
man
who
*NL*
talked
.
When
,
in
the
gathering
darkness
,
he
could
no
*NL*
longer
see
the
purple
,
bloated
face
and
the
burning
*NL*
eyes
,
a
curious
fancy
came
to
him
.
Wash
Williams
talked
*NL*
in
low
even
tones
that
made
his
words
seem
the
more
*NL*
terrible
.
In
the
darkness
the
young
reporter
found
*NL*
himself
imagining
that
he
sat
on
the
railroad
ties
*NL*
beside
a
comely
young
man
with
black
hair
and
black
*NL*
shining
eyes
.
There
was
something
almost
beautiful
in
*NL*
the
voice
of
Wash
Williams
,
the
hideous
,
telling
his
*NL*
story
of
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
telegraph
operator
of
Winesburg
,
sitting
in
the
*NL*
darkness
on
the
railroad
ties
,
had
become
a
poet
.
*NL*
Hatred
had
raised
him
to
that
elevation
.
``
It
is
because
*NL*
I
saw
you
kissing
the
lips
of
that
Belle
Carpenter
that
*NL*
I
tell
you
my
story
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
happened
to
me
may
*NL*
next
happen
to
you
.
I
want
to
put
you
on
your
guard
.
*NL*
Already
you
may
be
having
dreams
in
your
head
.
I
want
*NL*
to
destroy
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
began
telling
the
story
of
his
married
*NL*
life
with
the
tall
blonde
girl
with
the
blue
eyes
whom
*NL*
he
had
met
when
he
was
a
young
operator
at
Dayton
,
*NL*
Ohio
.
Here
and
there
his
story
was
touched
with
moments
*NL*
of
beauty
intermingled
with
strings
of
vile
curses
.
The
*NL*
operator
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
dentist
who
was
*NL*
the
youngest
of
three
sisters
.
On
his
marriage
day
,
*NL*
because
of
his
ability
,
he
was
promoted
to
a
position
*NL*
as
dispatcher
at
an
increased
salary
and
sent
to
an
*NL*
office
at
Columbus
,
Ohio
.
There
he
settled
down
with
*NL*
his
young
wife
and
began
buying
a
house
on
the
*NL*
installment
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
telegraph
operator
was
madly
in
love
.
With
a
*NL*
kind
of
religious
fervor
he
had
managed
to
go
through
*NL*
the
pitfalls
of
his
youth
and
to
remain
virginal
until
*NL*
after
his
marriage
.
He
made
for
George
Willard
a
*NL*
picture
of
his
life
in
the
house
at
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
*NL*
with
the
young
wife
.
``
In
the
garden
back
of
our
house
*NL*
we
planted
vegetables
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
know
,
peas
and
*NL*
corn
and
such
things
.
We
went
to
Columbus
in
early
*NL*
March
and
as
soon
as
the
days
became
warm
I
went
to
*NL*
work
in
the
garden
.
With
a
spade
I
turned
up
the
black
*NL*
ground
while
she
ran
about
laughing
and
pretending
to
*NL*
be
afraid
of
the
worms
I
uncovered
.
Late
in
April
came
*NL*
the
planting
.
In
the
little
paths
among
the
seed
beds
*NL*
she
stood
holding
a
paper
bag
in
her
hand
.
The
bag
was
*NL*
filled
with
seeds
.
A
few
at
a
time
she
handed
me
the
*NL*
seeds
that
I
might
thrust
them
into
the
warm
,
soft
*NL*
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
there
was
a
catch
in
the
voice
of
the
man
*NL*
talking
in
the
darkness
.
``
I
loved
her
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
claim
not
to
be
a
fool
.
I
love
her
yet
.
There
in
*NL*
the
dusk
in
the
spring
evening
I
crawled
along
the
*NL*
black
ground
to
her
feet
and
groveled
before
her
.
I
*NL*
kissed
her
shoes
and
the
ankles
above
her
shoes
.
When
*NL*
the
hem
of
her
garment
touched
my
face
I
trembled
.
When
*NL*
after
two
years
of
that
life
I
found
she
had
managed
to
*NL*
acquire
three
other
lovers
who
came
regularly
to
our
*NL*
house
when
I
was
away
at
work
,
I
did
n't
want
to
touch
*NL*
them
or
her
.
I
just
sent
her
home
to
her
mother
and
*NL*
said
nothing
.
There
was
nothing
to
say
.
I
had
four
*NL*
hundred
dollars
in
the
bank
and
I
gave
her
that
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
ask
her
reasons
.
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
When
she
*NL*
had
gone
I
cried
like
a
silly
boy
.
Pretty
soon
I
had
a
*NL*
chance
to
sell
the
house
and
I
sent
that
money
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
and
George
Willard
arose
from
the
pile
of
*NL*
railroad
ties
and
walked
along
the
tracks
toward
town
.
*NL*
The
operator
finished
his
tale
quickly
,
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
sent
for
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
wrote
me
a
*NL*
letter
and
asked
me
to
come
to
their
house
at
Dayton
.
*NL*
When
I
got
there
it
was
evening
about
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
'
voice
rose
to
a
half
scream
.
``
I
sat
in
*NL*
the
parlor
of
that
house
two
hours
.
Her
mother
took
me
*NL*
in
there
and
left
me
.
Their
house
was
stylish
.
They
*NL*
were
what
is
called
respectable
people
.
There
were
*NL*
plush
chairs
and
a
couch
in
the
room
.
I
was
trembling
*NL*
all
over
.
I
hated
the
men
I
thought
had
wronged
her
.
I
*NL*
was
sick
of
living
alone
and
wanted
her
back
.
The
*NL*
longer
I
waited
the
more
raw
and
tender
I
became
.
I
*NL*
thought
that
if
she
came
in
and
just
touched
me
with
*NL*
her
hand
I
would
perhaps
faint
away
.
I
ached
to
forgive
*NL*
and
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wash
Williams
stopped
and
stood
staring
at
George
*NL*
Willard
.
The
boy
's
body
shook
as
from
a
chill
.
Again
*NL*
the
man
's
voice
became
soft
and
low
.
``
She
came
into
the
*NL*
room
naked
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Her
mother
did
that
.
While
I
*NL*
sat
there
she
was
taking
the
girl
's
clothes
off
,
*NL*
perhaps
coaxing
her
to
do
it
.
First
I
heard
voices
at
*NL*
the
door
that
led
into
a
little
hallway
and
then
it
*NL*
opened
softly
.
The
girl
was
ashamed
and
stood
perfectly
*NL*
still
staring
at
the
floor
.
The
mother
did
n't
come
into
*NL*
the
room
.
When
she
had
pushed
the
girl
in
through
the
*NL*
door
she
stood
in
the
hallway
waiting
,
hoping
we
*NL*
would
--
well
,
you
see
--
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
and
the
telegraph
operator
came
into
the
*NL*
main
street
of
Winesburg
.
The
lights
from
the
store
*NL*
windows
lay
bright
and
shining
on
the
sidewalks
.
People
*NL*
moved
about
laughing
and
talking
.
The
young
reporter
*NL*
felt
ill
and
weak
.
In
imagination
,
he
also
became
old
*NL*
and
shapeless
.
``
I
did
n't
get
the
mother
killed
,
''
said
*NL*
Wash
Williams
,
staring
up
and
down
the
street
.
``
I
*NL*
struck
her
once
with
a
chair
and
then
the
neighbors
*NL*
came
in
and
took
it
away

She
screamed
so
loud
you
see
.
*NL*
I
wo
n't
ever
have
a
chance
to
kill

She
died
of

a
month

THE
THINKER
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
in
which
Seth
Richmond
of
Winesburg
lived
*NL*
with
his
mother
had
been
at
one
time
the
show
place
of
*NL*
the
town
,
but
when
young
Seth
lived
there
its
glory
had
*NL*
become
somewhat
dimmed
.
The
huge
brick
house
which
*NL*
Banker
White
had
built
on
Buckeye
Street
had
*NL*
overshadowed
it
.
The
Richmond
place
was
in
a
little
*NL*
valley
far
out
at
the
end
of
Main
Street
.
Farmers
*NL*
coming
into
town
by
a
dusty
road
from
the
south
passed
*NL*
by
a
grove
of
walnut
trees
,
skirted
the
Fair
Ground
*NL*
with
its
high
board
fence
covered
with
advertisements
,
*NL*
and
trotted
their
horses
down
through
the
valley
past
*NL*
the
Richmond
place
into
town
.
As
much
of
the
country
*NL*
north
and
south
of
Winesburg
was
devoted
to
fruit
and
*NL*
berry
raising
,
Seth
saw
wagon-loads
of
berry
*NL*
pickers
--
boys
,
girls
,
and
women
--
going
to
the
fields
in
*NL*
the
morning
and
returning
covered
with
dust
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
The
chattering
crowd
,
with
their
rude
jokes
*NL*
cried
out
from
wagon
to
wagon
,
sometimes
irritated
him
*NL*
sharply
.
He
regretted
that
he
also
could
not
laugh
*NL*
boisterously
,
shout
meaningless
jokes
and
make
of
*NL*
himself
a
figure
in
the
endless
stream
of
moving
,
*NL*
giggling
activity
that
went
up
and
down
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Richmond
house
was
built
of
limestone
,
and
,
*NL*
although
it
was
said
in
the
village
to
have
become
run
*NL*
down
,
had
in
reality
grown
more
beautiful
with
every
*NL*
passing
year
.
Already
time
had
begun
a
little
to
color
*NL*
the
stone
,
lending
a
golden
richness
to
its
surface
and
*NL*
in
the
evening
or
on
dark
days
touching
the
shaded
*NL*
places
beneath
the
eaves
with
wavering
patches
of
*NL*
browns
and
blacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
been
built
by
Seth
's
grandfather
,
a
stone
*NL*
quarryman
,
and
it
,
together
with
the
stone
quarries
on
*NL*
Lake
Erie
eighteen
miles
to
the
north
,
had
been
left
to
*NL*
his
son
,
Clarence
Richmond
,
Seth
's
father
.
Clarence
*NL*
Richmond
,
a
quiet
passionate
man
extraordinarily
*NL*
admired
by
his
neighbors
,
had
been
killed
in
a
street
*NL*
fight
with
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
in
Toledo
,
Ohio
.
*NL*
The
fight
concerned
the
publication
of
Clarence
*NL*
Richmond
's
name
coupled
with
that
of
a
woman
school
*NL*
teacher
,
and
as
the
dead
man
had
begun
the
row
by
*NL*
firing
upon
the
editor
,
the
effort
to
punish
the
slayer
*NL*
was
unsuccessful
.
After
the
quarryman
's
death
it
was
*NL*
found
that
much
of
the
money
left
to
him
had
been
*NL*
squandered
in
speculation
and
in
insecure
investments
*NL*
made
through
the
influence
of
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
with
but
a
small
income
,
Virginia
Richmond
had
*NL*
settled
down
to
a
retired
life
in
the
village
and
to
*NL*
the
raising
of
her
son
.
Although
she
had
been
deeply
*NL*
moved
by
the
death
of
the
husband
and
father
,
she
did
*NL*
not
at
all
believe
the
stories
concerning
him
that
ran
*NL*
about
after
his
death
.
To
her
mind
,
the
sensitive
,
*NL*
boyish
man
whom
all
had
instinctively
loved
,
was
but
an
*NL*
unfortunate
,
a
being
too
fine
for
everyday
life
.
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
hearing
all
sorts
of
stories
,
but
you
are
*NL*
not
to
believe
what
you
hear
,
''
she
said
to
her
son
.
``
He
*NL*
was
a
good
man
,
full
of
tenderness
for
everyone
,
and
*NL*
should
not
have
tried
to
be
a
man
of
affairs
.
No
matter
*NL*
how
much
I
were
to
plan
and
dream
of
your
future
,
I
*NL*
could
not
imagine
anything
better
for
you
than
that
you
*NL*
turn
out
as
good
a
man
as
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
years
after
the
death
of
her
husband
,
Virginia
*NL*
Richmond
had
become
alarmed
at
the
growing
demands
upon
*NL*
her
income
and
had
set
herself
to
the
task
of
*NL*
increasing
it
.
She
had
learned
stenography
and
through
*NL*
the
influence
of
her
husband
's
friends
got
the
position
*NL*
of
court
stenographer
at
the
county
seat
.
There
she
*NL*
went
by
train
each
morning
during
the
sessions
of
the
*NL*
court
,
and
when
no
court
sat
,
spent
her
days
working
*NL*
among
the
rosebushes
in
her
garden
.
She
was
a
tall
,
*NL*
straight
figure
of
a
woman
with
a
plain
face
and
a
*NL*
great
mass
of
brown
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
relationship
between
Seth
Richmond
and
his
*NL*
mother
,
there
was
a
quality
that
even
at
eighteen
had
*NL*
begun
to
color
all
of
his
traffic
with
men
.
An
almost
*NL*
unhealthy
respect
for
the
youth
kept
the
mother
for
the
*NL*
most
part
silent
in
his
presence
.
When
she
did
speak
*NL*
sharply
to
him
he
had
only
to
look
steadily
into
her
*NL*
eyes
to
see
dawning
there
the
puzzled
look
he
had
*NL*
already
noticed
in
the
eyes
of
others
when
he
looked
at
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
that
the
son
thought
with
remarkable
*NL*
clearness
and
the
mother
did
not
.
She
expected
from
all
*NL*
people
certain
conventional
reactions
to
life
.
A
boy
*NL*
was
your
son
,
you
scolded
him
and
he
trembled
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
floor
.
When
you
had
scolded
enough
he
*NL*
wept
and
all
was
forgiven
.
After
the
weeping
and
when
*NL*
he
had
gone
to
bed
,
you
crept
into
his
room
and
kissed
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Virginia
Richmond
could
not
understand
why
her
son
did
*NL*
not
do
these
things
.
After
the
severest
reprimand
,
he
*NL*
did
not
tremble
and
look
at
the
floor
but
instead
*NL*
looked
steadily
at
her
,
causing
uneasy
doubts
to
invade
*NL*
her
mind
.
As
for
creeping
into
his
room
--
after
Seth
*NL*
had
passed
his
fifteenth
year
,
she
would
have
been
half
*NL*
afraid
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
when
he
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
,
Seth
in
company
with
*NL*
two
other
boys
ran
away
from
home
.
The
three
boys
*NL*
climbed
into
the
open
door
of
an
empty
freight
car
and
*NL*
rode
some
forty
miles
to
a
town
where
a
fair
was
being
*NL*
held
.
One
of
the
boys
had
a
bottle
filled
with
a
*NL*
combination
of
whiskey
and
blackberry
wine
,
and
the
*NL*
three
sat
with
legs
dangling
out
of
the
car
door
*NL*
drinking
from
the
bottle
.
Seth
's
two
companions
sang
*NL*
and
waved
their
hands
to
idlers
about
the
stations
of
*NL*
the
towns
through
which
the
train
passed
.
They
planned
*NL*
raids
upon
the
baskets
of
farmers
who
had
come
with
*NL*
their
families
to
the
fair
.
``
We
will
live
like
kings
*NL*
and
wo
n't
have
to
spend
a
penny
to
see
the
fair
and
*NL*
horse
races
,
''
they
declared
boastfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
disappearance
of
Seth
,
Virginia
Richmond
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
of
her
home
filled
with
*NL*
vague
alarms
.
Although
on
the
next
day
she
discovered
,
*NL*
through
an
inquiry
made
by
the
town
marshal
,
on
what
*NL*
adventure
the
boys
had
gone
,
she
could
not
quiet
*NL*
herself
.
All
through
the
night
she
lay
awake
hearing
*NL*
the
clock
tick
and
telling
herself
that
Seth
,
like
his
*NL*
father
,
would
come
to
a
sudden
and
violent
end
.
So
*NL*
determined
was
she
that
the
boy
should
this
time
feel
*NL*
the
weight
of
her
wrath
that
,
although
she
would
not
*NL*
allow
the
marshal
to
interfere
with
his
adventure
,
she
*NL*
got
out
a
pencil
and
paper
and
wrote
down
a
series
of
*NL*
sharp
,
stinging
reproofs
she
intended
to
pour
out
upon
*NL*
him
.
The
reproofs
she
committed
to
memory
,
going
about
*NL*
the
garden
and
saying
them
aloud
like
an
actor
*NL*
memorizing
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
,
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
Seth
returned
,
a
*NL*
little
weary
and
with
coal
soot
in
his
ears
and
about
*NL*
his
eyes
,
she
again
found
herself
unable
to
reprove
*NL*
him
.
Walking
into
the
house
he
hung
his
cap
on
a
nail
*NL*
by
the
kitchen
door
and
stood
looking
steadily
at
her
.
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
turn
back
within
an
hour
after
we
had
*NL*
started
,
''
he
explained
.
``
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
*NL*
knew
you
would
be
bothered
,
but
I
knew
also
that
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
go
on
I
would
be
ashamed
of
myself
.
I
went
*NL*
through
with
the
thing
for
my
own
good
.
It
was
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
sleeping
on
wet
straw
,
and
two
drunken
*NL*
Negroes
came
and
slept
with
us
.
When
I
stole
a
lunch
*NL*
basket
out
of
a
farmer
's
wagon
I
could
n't
help
thinking
*NL*
of
his
children
going
all
day
without
food
.
I
was
sick
*NL*
of
the
whole
affair
,
but
I
was
determined
to
stick
it
*NL*
out
until
the
other
boys
were
ready
to
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
did
stick
it
out
,
''
replied
the
mother
,
*NL*
half
resentfully
,
and
kissing
him
upon
the
forehead
*NL*
pretended
to
busy
herself
with
the
work
about
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
summer
evening
Seth
Richmond
went
to
the
New
*NL*
Willard
House
to
visit
his
friend
,
George
Willard
.
It
*NL*
had
rained
during
the
afternoon
,
but
as
he
walked
*NL*
through
Main
Street
,
the
sky
had
partially
cleared
and
*NL*
a
golden
glow
lit
up
the
west
.
Going
around
a
corner
,
*NL*
he
turned
in
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
began
to
*NL*
climb
the
stairway
leading
up
to
his
friend
's
room
.
In
*NL*
the
hotel
office
the
proprietor
and
two
traveling
men
*NL*
were
engaged
in
a
discussion
of
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
stairway
Seth
stopped
and
listened
to
the
voices
*NL*
of
the
men
below
.
They
were
excited
and
talked
rapidly
.
*NL*
Tom
Willard
was
berating
the
traveling
men
.
``
I
am
a
*NL*
Democrat
but
your
talk
makes
me
sick
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
understand
McKinley
.
McKinley
and
Mark
Hanna
are
*NL*
friends
.
It
is
impossible
perhaps
for
your
mind
to
*NL*
grasp
that
.
If
anyone
tells
you
that
a
friendship
can
*NL*
be
deeper
and
bigger
and
more
worth
while
than
dollars
*NL*
and
cents
,
or
even
more
worth
while
than
state
*NL*
politics
,
you
snicker
and
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
was
interrupted
by
one
of
the
guests
,
a
*NL*
tall
,
grey-mustached
man
who
worked
for
a
wholesale
*NL*
grocery
house
.
``
Do
you
think
that
I
've
lived
in
*NL*
Cleveland
all
these
years
without
knowing
Mark
Hanna
?
''
*NL*
he
demanded
.
``
Your
talk
is
piffle
.
Hanna
is
after
money
*NL*
and
nothing
else
.
This
McKinley
is
his
tool
.
He
has
*NL*
McKinley
bluffed
and
do
n't
you
forget
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
on
the
stairs
did
not
linger
to
hear
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
discussion
,
but
went
on
up
the
stairway
and
*NL*
into
the
little
dark
hall
.
Something
in
the
voices
of
*NL*
the
men
talking
in
the
hotel
office
started
a
chain
of
*NL*
thoughts
in
his
mind
.
He
was
lonely
and
had
begun
to
*NL*
think
that
loneliness
was
a
part
of
his
character
,
*NL*
something
that
would
always
stay
with
him
.
Stepping
*NL*
into
a
side
hall
he
stood
by
a
window
that
looked
into
*NL*
an
alleyway
.
At
the
back
of
his
shop
stood
Abner
Groff
,
*NL*
the
town
baker
.
His
tiny
bloodshot
eyes
looked
up
and
*NL*
down
the
alleyway
.
In
his
shop
someone
called
the
*NL*
baker
,
who
pretended
not
to
hear
.
The
baker
had
an
*NL*
empty
milk
bottle
in
his
hand
and
an
angry
sullen
look
*NL*
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
,
Seth
Richmond
was
called
the
``
deep
one
.
''
*NL*
``
He
's
like
his
father
,
''
men
said
as
he
went
through
the
*NL*
streets
.
``
He
'll
break
out
some
of
these
days
.
You
wait
*NL*
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
of
the
town
and
the
respect
with
which
men
and
*NL*
boys
instinctively
greeted
him
,
as
all
men
greet
silent
*NL*
people
,
had
affected
Seth
Richmond
's
outlook
on
life
*NL*
and
on
himself
.
He
,
like
most
boys
,
was
deeper
than
*NL*
boys
are
given
credit
for
being
,
but
he
was
not
what
*NL*
the
men
of
the
town
,
and
even
his
mother
,
thought
him
*NL*
to
be
.
No
great
underlying
purpose
lay
back
of
his
*NL*
habitual
silence
,
and
he
had
no
definite
plan
for
his
*NL*
life
.
When
the
boys
with
whom
he
associated
were
noisy
*NL*
and
quarrelsome
,
he
stood
quietly
at
one
side
.
With
*NL*
calm
eyes
he
watched
the
gesticulating
lively
figures
*NL*
of
his
companions
.
He
was
n't
particularly
interested
in
*NL*
what
was
going
on
,
and
sometimes
wondered
if
he
would
*NL*
ever
be
particularly
interested
in
anything
.
Now
,
as
he
*NL*
stood
in
the
half-darkness
by
the
window
watching
the
*NL*
baker
,
he
wished
that
he
himself
might
become
*NL*
thoroughly
stirred
by
something
,
even
by
the
fits
of
*NL*
sullen
anger
for
which
Baker
Groff
was
noted
.
``
It
would
*NL*
be
better
for
me
if
I
could
become
excited
and
wrangle
*NL*
about
politics
like
windy
old
Tom
Willard
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
as
he
left
the
window
and
went
again
along
the
hallway
*NL*
to
the
room
occupied
by
his
friend
,
George
Willard
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
was
older
than
Seth
Richmond
,
but
in
the
*NL*
rather
odd
friendship
between
the
two
,
it
was
he
who
*NL*
was
forever
courting
and
the
younger
boy
who
was
being
*NL*
courted
.
The
paper
on
which
George
worked
had
one
*NL*
policy
.
It
strove
to
mention
by
name
in
each
issue
,
as
*NL*
many
as
possible
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
.
*NL*
Like
an
excited
dog
,
George
Willard
ran
here
and
there
,
*NL*
noting
on
his
pad
of
paper
who
had
gone
on
business
to
*NL*
the
county
seat
or
had
returned
from
a
visit
to
a
*NL*
neighboring
village
.
All
day
he
wrote
little
facts
upon
*NL*
the
pad
.
``
A.
P.
Wringlet
had
received
a
shipment
of
*NL*
straw
hats
.
Ed
Byerbaum
and
Tom
Marshall
were
in
*NL*
Cleveland
Friday
.
Uncle
Tom
Sinnings
is
building
a
new
*NL*
barn
on
his
place
on
the
Valley
Road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
that
George
Willard
would
some
day
become
a
*NL*
writer
had
given
him
a
place
of
distinction
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
and
to
Seth
Richmond
he
talked
continually
*NL*
of
the
matter
,
``
It
's
the
easiest
of
all
lives
to
live
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
,
becoming
excited
and
boastful
.
``
Here
and
*NL*
there
you
go
and
there
is
no
one
to
boss
you
.
Though
*NL*
you
are
in
India
or
in
the
South
Seas
in
a
boat
,
you
*NL*
have
but
to
write
and
there
you
are
.
Wait
till
I
get
my
*NL*
name
up
and
then
see
what
fun
I
shall
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
George
Willard
's
room
,
which
had
a
window
looking
*NL*
down
into
an
alleyway
and
one
that
looked
across
*NL*
railroad
tracks
to
Biff
Carter
's
Lunch
Room
facing
the
*NL*
railroad
station
,
Seth
Richmond
sat
in
a
chair
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
floor
.
George
Willard
,
who
had
been
*NL*
sitting
for
an
hour
idly
playing
with
a
lead
pencil
,
*NL*
greeted
him
effusively
.
``
I
've
been
trying
to
write
a
*NL*
love
story
,
''
he
explained
,
laughing
nervously
.
Lighting
*NL*
a
pipe
he
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
``
I
know
*NL*
what
I
'm
going
to
do
.
I
'm
going
to
fall
in
love

I
've
*NL*
been
sitting
here
and
thinking
it
over
and
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
embarrassed
by
his
declaration
,
George
went
*NL*
to
a
window
and
turning
his
back
to
his
friend
leaned
*NL*
out
.
``
I
know
who
I
'm
going
to
fall
in
love
with
,
''
he
*NL*
said
sharply
.
``
It
's
Helen
White

She
is
the
only
girl

in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
with
a
new
idea
,
young
Willard
turned
and
walked
*NL*
toward
his
visitor
.
``
Look
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
know

said
.
You
just
get
to
talking
to
her
and
say
*NL*
that
I
'm
in
love
with
her
.
See
what
she
says
to
that
.
*NL*
See
how
she
takes
it
,
and
then
you
come
and
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
Richmond
arose
and
went
toward
the
door
.
The
words
*NL*
of
his
comrade
irritated
him
unbearably
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
good-bye
,
''
he
said
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
was
amazed
.
Running
forward
he
stood
in
the
*NL*
darkness
trying
to
look
into
Seth
's
face
.
``
What
's
the
*NL*
matter
?
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
You
stay
here
and
*NL*
let
's
talk
,
''
he
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wave
of
resentment
directed
against
his
friend
,
the
*NL*
men
of
the
town
who
were
,
he
thought
,
perpetually
*NL*
talking
of
nothing
,
and
most
of
all
,
against
his
own
*NL*
habit
of
silence
,
made
Seth
half
desperate
.
``
Aw
,
speak
*NL*
to
her
yourself
,
''
he
burst
forth
and
then
,
going
*NL*
quickly
through
the
door
,
slammed
it
sharply
in
his
*NL*
friend
's
face
.
``
I
'm
going
to
find
Helen
White
and
talk
*NL*
to
her
,
but
not
about
him
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
went
down
the
stairway
and
out
at
the
front
door
*NL*
of
the
hotel
muttering
with
wrath
.
Crossing
a
little
*NL*
dusty
street
and
climbing
a
low
iron
railing
,
he
went
*NL*
to
sit
upon
the
grass
in
the
station
yard
.
George
*NL*
Willard
he
thought
a
profound
fool
,
and
he
wished
that
*NL*
he
had
said
so
more
vigorously
.
Although
his
*NL*
acquaintanceship
with
Helen
White
,
the
banker
's
*NL*
daughter
,
was
outwardly
but
casual
,
she
was
often
the
*NL*
subject
of
his
thoughts
and
he
felt
that
she
was
*NL*
something
private
and
personal
to
himself
.
``
The
busy
*NL*
fool
with
his
love
stories
,
''
he
muttered
,
staring
back
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
at
George
Willard
's
room
,
``
why
does
*NL*
he
never
tire
of
his
eternal
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
berry
harvest
time
in
Winesburg
and
upon
the
*NL*
station
platform
men
and
boys
loaded
the
boxes
of
red
,
*NL*
fragrant
berries
into
two
express
cars
that
stood
upon
*NL*
the
siding
.
A
June
moon
was
in
the
sky
,
although
in
the
*NL*
west
a
storm
threatened
,
and
no
street
lamps
were
*NL*
lighted
.
In
the
dim
light
the
figures
of
the
men
*NL*
standing
upon
the
express
truck
and
pitching
the
boxes
*NL*
in
at
the
doors
of
the
cars
were
but
dimly
discernible
.
*NL*
Upon
the
iron
railing
that
protected
the
station
lawn
*NL*
sat
other
men
.
Pipes
were
lighted
.
Village
jokes
went
*NL*
back
and
forth
.
Away
in
the
distance
a
train
whistled
*NL*
and
the
men
loading
the
boxes
into
the
cars
worked
with
*NL*
renewed
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
arose
from
his
place
on
the
grass
and
went
*NL*
silently
past
the
men
perched
upon
the
railing
and
into
*NL*
Main
Street
.
He
had
come
to
a
resolution
.
``
I
'll
get
out
*NL*
of
here
,
''
he
told
himself
.
``
What
good
am
I
here
?
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
some
city
and
go
to
work
.
I
'll
tell
mother
*NL*
about
it
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
Richmond
went
slowly
along
Main
Street
,
past
*NL*
Wacker
's
Cigar
Store
and
the
Town
Hall
,
and
into
*NL*
Buckeye
Street
.
He
was
depressed
by
the
thought
that
he
*NL*
was
not
a
part
of
the
life
in
his
own
town
,
but
the
*NL*
depression
did
not
cut
deeply
as
he
did
not
think
of
*NL*
himself
as
at
fault
.
In
the
heavy
shadows
of
a
big
tree
*NL*
before
Doctor
Welling
's
house
,
he
stopped
and
stood
*NL*
watching
half-witted
Turk
Smollet
,
who
was
pushing
a
*NL*
wheelbarrow
in
the
road
.
The
old
man
with
his
absurdly
*NL*
boyish
mind
had
a
dozen
long
boards
on
the
wheelbarrow
,
*NL*
and
,
as
he
hurried
along
the
road
,
balanced
the
load
*NL*
with
extreme
nicety
.
``
Easy
there
,
Turk
!
Steady
now
,
old
*NL*
boy
!
''
the
old
man
shouted
to
himself
,
and
laughed
so
*NL*
that
the
load
of
boards
rocked
dangerously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
knew
Turk
Smollet
,
the
half
dangerous
old
wood
*NL*
chopper
whose
peculiarities
added
so
much
of
color
to
*NL*
the
life
of
the
village
.
He
knew
that
when
Turk
got
*NL*
into
Main
Street
he
would
become
the
center
of
a
*NL*
whirlwind
of
cries
and
comments
,
that
in
truth
the
old
*NL*
man
was
going
far
out
of
his
way
in
order
to
pass
*NL*
through
Main
Street
and
exhibit
his
skill
in
wheeling
*NL*
the
boards
.
``
If
George
Willard
were
here
,
he
'd
have
*NL*
something
to
say
,
''
thought
Seth
.
``
George
belongs
to
*NL*
this
town
.
He
'd
shout
at
Turk
and
Turk
would
shout
at
*NL*
him
.
They
'd
both
be
secretly
pleased
by
what
they
had
*NL*
said
.
It
's
different
with
me
.
I
do
n't
belong
.
I
'll
not
*NL*
make
a
fuss
about
it
,
but
I
'm
going
to
get
out
of
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
stumbled
forward
through
the
half-darkness
,
*NL*
feeling
himself
an
outcast
in
his
own
town
.
He
began
to
*NL*
pity
himself
,
but
a
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
made
him
smile
.
In
the
end
he
decided
that
he
*NL*
was
simply
old
beyond
his
years
and
not
at
all
a
*NL*
subject
for
self-pity
.
``
I
'm
made
to
go
to
work
.
I
may
*NL*
be
able
to
make
a
place
for
myself
by
steady
working
,
*NL*
and
I
might
as
well
be
at
it
,
''
he
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
went
to
the
house
of
Banker
White
and
stood
in
the
*NL*
darkness
by
the
front
door
.
On
the
door
hung
a
heavy
*NL*
brass
knocker
,
an
innovation
introduced
into
the
*NL*
village
by
Helen
White
's
mother
,
who
had
also
organized
*NL*
a
women
's
club
for
the
study
of
poetry
.
Seth
raised
the
*NL*
knocker
and
let
it
fall
.
Its
heavy
clatter
sounded
like
*NL*
a
report
from
distant
guns
.
``
How
awkward
and
foolish
I
*NL*
am
,
''
he
thought
.
``
If
Mrs.
White
comes
to
the
door
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
know
what
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Helen
White
who
came
to
the
door
and
found
Seth
*NL*
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
porch
.
Blushing
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
she
stepped
forward
,
closing
the
door
softly
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
get
out
of
town
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'll
*NL*
do
,
but
I
'm
going
to
get
out
of
here
and
go
to
work
.
I
*NL*
think
I
'll
go
to
Columbus
,
''
he
said
.
``
Perhaps
I
'll
get
*NL*
into
the
State
University
down
there
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
*NL*
going
.
I
'll
tell
mother
tonight
.
''
He
hesitated
and
*NL*
looked
doubtfully
about
.
``
Perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
*NL*
coming
to
walk
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
and
Helen
walked
through
the
streets
beneath
the
*NL*
trees
.
Heavy
clouds
had
drifted
across
the
face
of
the
*NL*
moon
,
and
before
them
in
the
deep
twilight
went
a
man
*NL*
with
a
short
ladder
upon
his
shoulder
.
Hurrying
*NL*
forward
,
the
man
stopped
at
the
street
crossing
and
,
*NL*
putting
the
ladder
against
the
wooden
lamp-post
,
*NL*
lighted
the
village
lights
so
that
their
way
was
half
*NL*
lighted
,
half
darkened
,
by
the
lamps
and
by
the
*NL*
deepening
shadows
cast
by
the
low-branched
trees
.
In
*NL*
the
tops
of
the
trees
the
wind
began
to
play
,
*NL*
disturbing
the
sleeping
birds
so
that
they
flew
about
*NL*
calling
plaintively
.
In
the
lighted
space
before
one
of
*NL*
the
lamps
,
two
bats
wheeled
and
circled
,
pursuing
the
*NL*
gathering
swarm
of
night
flies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Seth
had
been
a
boy
in
knee
trousers
there
had
*NL*
been
a
half
expressed
intimacy
between
him
and
the
*NL*
maiden
who
now
for
the
first
time
walked
beside
him
.
*NL*
For
a
time
she
had
been
beset
with
a
madness
for
*NL*
writing
notes
which
she
addressed
to
Seth
.
He
had
found
*NL*
them
concealed
in
his
books
at
school
and
one
had
been
*NL*
given
him
by
a
child
met
in
the
street
,
while
several
*NL*
had
been
delivered
through
the
village
post
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notes
had
been
written
in
a
round
,
boyish
hand
and
*NL*
had
reflected
a
mind
inflamed
by
novel
reading
.
Seth
*NL*
had
not
answered
them
,
although
he
had
been
moved
and
*NL*
flattered
by
some
of
the
sentences
scrawled
in
pencil
*NL*
upon
the
stationery
of
the
banker
's
wife
.
Putting
them
*NL*
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
,
he
went
through
the
street
*NL*
or
stood
by
the
fence
in
the
school
yard
with
something
*NL*
burning
at
his
side
.
He
thought
it
fine
that
he
should
*NL*
be
thus
selected
as
the
favorite
of
the
richest
and
*NL*
most
attractive
girl
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
and
Seth
stopped
by
a
fence
near
where
a
low
dark
*NL*
building
faced
the
street
.
The
building
had
once
been
a
*NL*
factory
for
the
making
of
barrel
staves
but
was
now
*NL*
vacant
.
Across
the
street
upon
the
porch
of
a
house
a
*NL*
man
and
woman
talked
of
their
childhood
,
their
voices
*NL*
coming
dearly
across
to
the
half-embarrassed
youth
and
*NL*
maiden
.
There
was
the
sound
of
scraping
chairs
and
the
*NL*
man
and
woman
came
down
the
gravel
path
to
a
wooden
*NL*
gate
.
Standing
outside
the
gate
,
the
man
leaned
over
*NL*
and
kissed
the
woman
.
``
For
old
times
'
sake
,
''
he
said
*NL*
and
,
turning
,
walked
rapidly
away
along
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Belle
Turner
,
''
whispered
Helen
,
and
put
her
*NL*
hand
boldly
into
Seth
's
hand
.
``
I
did
n't
know
she
had
a
*NL*
fellow
.
I
thought
she
was
too
old
for
that
.
''
Seth
*NL*
laughed
uneasily
.
The
hand
of
the
girl
was
warm
and
a
*NL*
strange
,
dizzy
feeling
crept
over
him
.
Into
his
mind
*NL*
came
a
desire
to
tell
her
something
he
had
been
*NL*
determined
not
to
tell
.
``
George
Willard
's
in
love
with
*NL*
you
,
''
he
said
,
and
in
spite
of
his
agitation
his
voice
*NL*
was
low
and
quiet
.
``
He
's
writing
a
story
,
and
he
wants
*NL*
to
be
in
love
.
He
wants
to
know
how
it
feels
.
He
wanted
*NL*
me
to
tell
you
and
see
what
you
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Helen
and
Seth
walked
in
silence
.
They
came
to
*NL*
the
garden
surrounding
the
old
Richmond
place
and
going
*NL*
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
sat
on
a
wooden
bench
*NL*
beneath
a
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
street
as
he
walked
beside
the
girl
new
and
*NL*
daring
thoughts
had
come
into
Seth
Richmond
's
mind
.
He
*NL*
began
to
regret
his
decision
to
get
out
of
town
.
``
It
*NL*
would
be
something
new
and
altogether
delightful
to
*NL*
remain
and
walk
often
through
the
streets
with
Helen
*NL*
White
,
''
he
thought
.
In
imagination
he
saw
himself
*NL*
putting
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
feeling
her
arms
*NL*
clasped
tightly
about
his
neck
.
One
of
those
odd
*NL*
combinations
of
events
and
places
made
him
connect
the
*NL*
idea
of
love-making
with
this
girl
and
a
spot
he
had
*NL*
visited
some
days
before
.
He
had
gone
on
an
errand
to
*NL*
the
house
of
a
farmer
who
lived
on
a
hillside
beyond
*NL*
the
Fair
Ground
and
had
returned
by
a
path
through
a
*NL*
field
.
At
the
foot
of
the
hill
below
the
farmer
's
house
*NL*
Seth
had
stopped
beneath
a
sycamore
tree
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
.
A
soft
humming
noise
had
greeted
his
ears
.
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
had
thought
the
tree
must
be
the
home
*NL*
of
a
swarm
of
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
looking
down
,
Seth
had
seen
the
bees
*NL*
everywhere
all
about
him
in
the
long
grass
.
He
stood
in
*NL*
a
mass
of
weeds
that
grew
waist-high
in
the
field
that
*NL*
ran
away
from
the
hillside
.
The
weeds
were
abloom
with
*NL*
tiny
purple
blossoms
and
gave
forth
an
overpowering
*NL*
fragrance
.
Upon
the
weeds
the
bees
were
gathered
in
*NL*
armies
,
singing
as
they
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
imagined
himself
lying
on
a
summer
evening
,
buried
*NL*
deep
among
the
weeds
beneath
the
tree
.
Beside
him
,
in
*NL*
the
scene
built
in
his
fancy
,
lay
Helen
White
,
her
hand
*NL*
lying
in
his
hand
.
A
peculiar
reluctance
kept
him
from
*NL*
kissing
her
lips
,
but
he
felt
he
might
have
done
that
*NL*
if
he
wished
.
Instead
,
he
lay
perfectly
still
,
looking
*NL*
at
her
and
listening
to
the
army
of
bees
that
sang
the
*NL*
sustained
masterful
song
of
labor
above
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
bench
in
the
garden
Seth
stirred
uneasily
.
*NL*
Releasing
the
hand
of
the
girl
,
he
thrust
his
hands
*NL*
into
his
trouser
pockets
.
A
desire
to
impress
the
mind
*NL*
of
his
companion
with
the
importance
of
the
resolution
*NL*
he
had
made
came
over
him
and
he
nodded
his
head
toward
*NL*
the
house
.
``
Mother
'll
make
a
fuss
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
.
``
She
has
n't
thought
at
all
about
what
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
do
in
life
.
She
thinks
I
'm
going
to
stay
on
*NL*
here
forever
just
being
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
's
voice
became
charged
with
boyish
earnestness
.
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
've
got
to
strike
out
.
I
've
got
to
get
to
*NL*
work
.
It
's
what
I
'm
good
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
White
was
impressed
.
She
nodded
her
head
and
a
*NL*
feeling
of
admiration
swept
over
her
.
``
This
is
as
it
*NL*
should
be
,
''
she
thought
.
``
This
boy
is
not
a
boy
at
all
,
*NL*
but
a
strong
,
purposeful
man
.
''
Certain
vague
desires
*NL*
that
had
been
invading
her
body
were
swept
away
and
she
*NL*
sat
up
very
straight
on
the
bench
.
The
thunder
*NL*
continued
to
rumble
and
flashes
of
heat
lightning
lit
*NL*
up
the
eastern
sky
.
The
garden
that
had
been
so
*NL*
mysterious
and
vast
,
a
place
that
with
Seth
beside
her
*NL*
might
have
become
the
background
for
strange
and
*NL*
wonderful
adventures
,
now
seemed
no
more
than
an
*NL*
ordinary
Winesburg
back
yard
,
quite
definite
and
*NL*
limited
in
its
outlines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
do
up
there
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
turned
half
around
on
the
bench
,
striving
to
see
*NL*
her
face
in
the
darkness
.
He
thought
her
infinitely
*NL*
more
sensible
and
straightforward
than
George
Willard
,
*NL*
and
was
glad
he
had
come
away
from
his
friend
.
A
*NL*
feeling
of
impatience
with
the
town
that
had
been
in
*NL*
his
mind
returned
,
and
he
tried
to
tell
her
of
it
.
*NL*
``
Everyone
talks
and
talks
,
''
he
began
.
``
I
'm
sick
of
it
.
*NL*
I
'll
do
something
,
get
into
some
kind
of
work
where
*NL*
talk
do
n't
count
.
Maybe
I
'll
just
be
a
mechanic
in
a
*NL*
shop
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
guess
I
do
n't
care
much
.
I
just
*NL*
want
to
work
and
keep
quiet
.
That
's
all
I
've
got
in
my
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
arose
from
the
bench
and
put
out
his
hand
.
He
did
*NL*
not
want
to
bring
the
meeting
to
an
end
but
could
not
*NL*
think
of
anything
more
to
say
.
``
It
's
the
last
time
*NL*
we
'll
see
each
other
,
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wave
of
sentiment
swept
over
Helen
.
Putting
her
hand
*NL*
upon
Seth
's
shoulder
,
she
started
to
draw
his
face
down
*NL*
toward
her
own
upturned
face
.
The
act
was
one
of
pure
*NL*
affection
and
cutting
regret
that
some
vague
adventure
*NL*
that
had
been
present
in
the
spirit
of
the
night
would
*NL*
now
never
be
realized
.
``
I
think
I
'd
better
be
going
*NL*
along
,
''
she
said
,
letting
her
hand
fall
heavily
to
her
*NL*
side
.
A
thought
came
to
her
.
``
Do
n't
you
go
with
me
;
I
*NL*
want
to
be
alone
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
go
and
talk
with
your
*NL*
mother
.
You
'd
better
do
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
hesitated
and
,
as
he
stood
waiting
,
the
girl
*NL*
turned
and
ran
away
through
the
hedge
.
A
desire
to
run
*NL*
after
her
came
to
him
,
but
he
only
stood
staring
,
*NL*
perplexed
and
puzzled
by
her
action
as
he
had
been
*NL*
perplexed
and
puzzled
by
all
of
the
life
of
the
town
*NL*
out
of
which
she
had
come
.
Walking
slowly
toward
the
*NL*
house
,
he
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
large
tree
and
*NL*
looked
at
his
mother
sitting
by
a
lighted
window
busily
*NL*
sewing
.
The
feeling
of
loneliness
that
had
visited
him
*NL*
earlier
in
the
evening
returned
and
colored
his
*NL*
thoughts
of
the
adventure
through
which
he
had
just
*NL*
passed
.
``
Huh
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
turning
and
staring
in
the
*NL*
direction
taken
by
Helen
White
.
``
That
's
how
things
'll
*NL*
turn
out
.
She
'll
be
like
the
rest
.
I
suppose
she
'll
*NL*
begin
now
to
look
at
me
in
a
funny
way
.
''
He
looked
at
*NL*
the
ground
and
pondered
this
thought
.
``
She
'll
be
*NL*
embarrassed
and
feel
strange
when
I
'm
around
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
to
himself
.
``
That
's
how
it
'll
be
.
That
's
how
*NL*
everything
'll
turn
out
.
When
it
comes
to
loving
*NL*
someone
,
it
wo
n't
never
be
me
.
It
'll
be
someone
*NL*
else
--
some
fool
--
someone
who
talks
a
lot
--
someone
like
*NL*
that
George
Willard
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TANDY
*NL*
*NL*
Until
she
was
seven
years
old
she
lived
in
an
old
*NL*
unpainted
house
on
an
unused
road
that
led
off
Trunion
*NL*
Pike
.
Her
father
gave
her
but
little
attention
and
her
*NL*
mother
was
dead
.
The
father
spent
his
time
talking
and
*NL*
thinking
of
religion
.
He
proclaimed
himself
an
agnostic
*NL*
and
was
so
absorbed
in
destroying
the
ideas
of
God
that
*NL*
had
crept
into
the
minds
of
his
neighbors
that
he
never
*NL*
saw
God
manifesting
himself
in
the
little
child
that
,
*NL*
half
forgotten
,
lived
here
and
there
on
the
bounty
of
*NL*
her
dead
mother
's
relatives
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stranger
came
to
Winesburg
and
saw
in
the
child
what
*NL*
the
father
did
not
see
.
He
was
a
tall
,
redhaired
young
*NL*
man
who
was
almost
always
drunk
.
Sometimes
he
sat
in
a
*NL*
chair
before
the
New
Willard
House
with
Tom
Hard
,
the
*NL*
father
.
As
Tom
talked
,
declaring
there
could
be
no
God
,
*NL*
the
stranger
smiled
and
winked
at
the
bystanders
.
He
*NL*
and
Tom
became
friends
and
were
much
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
was
the
son
of
a
rich
merchant
of
*NL*
Cleveland
and
had
come
to
Winesburg
on
a
mission
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
cure
himself
of
the
habit
of
drink
,
and
*NL*
thought
that
by
escaping
from
his
city
associates
and
*NL*
living
in
a
rural
community
he
would
have
a
better
*NL*
chance
in
the
struggle
with
the
appetite
that
was
*NL*
destroying
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sojourn
in
Winesburg
was
not
a
success
.
The
*NL*
dullness
of
the
passing
hours
led
to
his
drinking
*NL*
harder
than
ever
.
But
he
did
succeed
in
doing
*NL*
something
.
He
gave
a
name
rich
with
meaning
to
Tom
*NL*
Hard
's
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
he
was
recovering
from
a
long
debauch
*NL*
the
stranger
came
reeling
along
the
main
street
of
the
*NL*
town
.
Tom
Hard
sat
in
a
chair
before
the
New
Willard
*NL*
House
with
his
daughter
,
then
a
child
of
five
,
on
his
*NL*
knees
.
Beside
him
on
the
board
sidewalk
sat
young
*NL*
George
Willard
.
The
stranger
dropped
into
a
chair
*NL*
beside
them
.
His
body
shook
and
when
he
tried
to
talk
*NL*
his
voice
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
evening
and
darkness
lay
over
the
town
and
*NL*
over
the
railroad
that
ran
along
the
foot
of
a
little
*NL*
incline
before
the
hotel
.
Somewhere
in
the
distance
,
*NL*
off
to
the
west
,
there
was
a
prolonged
blast
from
the
*NL*
whistle
of
a
passenger
engine
.
A
dog
that
had
been
*NL*
sleeping
in
the
roadway
arose
and
barked
.
The
stranger
*NL*
began
to
babble
and
made
a
prophecy
concerning
the
*NL*
child
that
lay
in
the
arms
of
the
agnostic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
to
quit
drinking
,
''
he
said
,
and
tears
*NL*
began
to
run
down
his
cheeks
.
He
did
not
look
at
Tom
*NL*
Hard
,
but
leaned
forward
and
stared
into
the
darkness
*NL*
as
though
seeing
a
vision
.
``
I
ran
away
to
the
country
*NL*
to
be
cured
,
but
I
am
not
cured
.
There
is
a
reason
.
''
He
*NL*
turned
to
look
at
the
child
who
sat
up
very
straight
on
*NL*
her
father
's
knee
and
returned
the
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
touched
Tom
Hard
on
the
arm
.
``
Drink
is
not
*NL*
the
only
thing
to
which
I
am
addicted
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
*NL*
is
something
else
.
I
am
a
lover
and
have
not
found
my
*NL*
thing
to
love
.
That
is
a
big
point
if
you
know
enough
*NL*
to
realize
what
I
mean
.
It
makes
my
destruction
*NL*
inevitable
,
you
see
.
There
are
few
who
understand
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
became
silent
and
seemed
overcome
with
*NL*
sadness
,
but
another
blast
from
the
whistle
of
the
*NL*
passenger
engine
aroused
him
.
``
I
have
not
lost
faith
.
I
*NL*
proclaim
that
.
I
have
only
been
brought
to
the
place
*NL*
where
I
know
my
faith
will
not
be
realized
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
hoarsely
.
He
looked
hard
at
the
child
and
*NL*
began
to
address
her
,
paying
no
more
attention
to
the
*NL*
father
.
``
There
is
a
woman
coming
,
''
he
said
,
and
his
*NL*
voice
was
now
sharp
and
earnest
.
``
I
have
missed
her
,
*NL*
you
see
.
She
did
not
come
in
my
time
.
You
may
be
the
*NL*
woman
.
It
would
be
like
fate
to
let
me
stand
in
her
*NL*
presence
once
,
on
such
an
evening
as
this
,
when
I
have
*NL*
destroyed
myself
with
drink
and
she
is
as
yet
only
a
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shoulders
of
the
stranger
shook
violently
,
and
when
*NL*
he
tried
to
roll
a
cigarette
the
paper
fell
from
his
*NL*
trembling
fingers
.
He
grew
angry
and
scolded
.
``
They
*NL*
think
it
's
easy
to
be
a
woman
,
to
be
loved
,
but
I
know
*NL*
better
,
''
he
declared
.
Again
he
turned
to
the
child
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Perhaps
of
all
men
I
alone
*NL*
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
glance
again
wandered
away
to
the
darkened
street
.
*NL*
``
I
know
about
her
,
although
she
has
never
crossed
my
*NL*
path
,
''
he
said
softly
.
``
I
know
about
her
struggles
and
*NL*
her
defeats
.
It
is
because
of
her
defeats
that
she
is
*NL*
to
me
the
lovely
one
.
Out
of
her
defeats
has
been
born
*NL*
a
new
quality
in
woman
.
I
have
a
name
for
it
.
I
call
it
*NL*
Tandy
.
I
made
up
the
name
when
I
was
a
true
dreamer
and
*NL*
before
my
body
became
vile
.
It
is
the
quality
of
being
*NL*
strong
to
be
loved
.
It
is
something
men
need
from
women
*NL*
and
that
they
do
not
get
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
arose
and
stood
before
Tom
Hard
.
His
body
*NL*
rocked
back
and
forth
and
he
seemed
about
to
fall
,
but
*NL*
instead
he
dropped
to
his
knees
on
the
sidewalk
and
*NL*
raised
the
hands
of
the
little
girl
to
his
drunken
*NL*
lips
.
He
kissed
them
ecstatically
.
``
Be
Tandy
,
little
*NL*
one
,
''
he
pleaded
.
``
Dare
to
be
strong
and
courageous
.
*NL*
That
is
the
road
.
Venture
anything
.
Be
brave
enough
to
*NL*
dare
to
be
loved
.
Be
something
more
than
man
or
woman
.
*NL*
Be
Tandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
arose
and
staggered
off
down
the
street
.
*NL*
A
day
or
two
later
he
got
aboard
a
train
and
returned
*NL*
to
his
home
in
Cleveland
.
On
the
summer
evening
,
after
*NL*
the
talk
before
the
hotel
,
Tom
Hard
took
the
girl
child
*NL*
to
the
house
of
a
relative
where
she
had
been
invited
*NL*
to
spend
the
night
.
As
he
went
along
in
the
darkness
*NL*
under
the
trees
he
forgot
the
babbling
voice
of
the
*NL*
stranger
and
his
mind
returned
to
the
making
of
*NL*
arguments
by
which
he
might
destroy
men
's
faith
in
God
.
*NL*
He
spoke
his
daughter
's
name
and
she
began
to
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
called
that
,
''
she
declared
.
``
I
*NL*
want
to
be
called
Tandy
--
Tandy
Hard
.
''
The
child
wept
so
*NL*
bitterly
that
Tom
Hard
was
touched
and
tried
to
comfort
*NL*
her
.
He
stopped
beneath
a
tree
and
,
taking
her
into
his
*NL*
arms
,
began
to
caress
her
.
``
Be
good
,
now
,
''
he
said
*NL*
sharply
;
but
she
would
not
be
quieted
.
With
childish
*NL*
abandon
she
gave
herself
over
to
grief
,
her
voice
*NL*
breaking
the
evening
stillness
of
the
street
.
``
I
want
*NL*
to
be
Tandy
.
I
want
to
be
Tandy
.
I
want
to
be
Tandy
*NL*
Hard
,
''
she
cried
,
shaking
her
head
and
sobbing
as
*NL*
though
her
young
strength
were
not
enough
to
bear
the
*NL*
vision
the
words
of
the
drunkard
had
brought
to
her
.

THE
STRENGTH
OF
GOD
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reverend
Curtis
Hartman
was
pastor
of
the
*NL*
Presbyterian
Church
of
Winesburg
,
and
had
been
in
that
*NL*
position
ten
years
.
He
was
forty
years
old
,
and
by
his
*NL*
nature
very
silent
and
reticent
.
To
preach
,
standing
in
*NL*
the
pulpit
before
the
people
,
was
always
a
hardship
for
*NL*
him
and
from
Wednesday
morning
until
Saturday
evening
*NL*
he
thought
of
nothing
but
the
two
sermons
that
must
be
*NL*
preached
on
Sunday
.
Early
on
Sunday
morning
he
went
*NL*
into
a
little
room
called
a
study
in
the
bell
tower
of
*NL*
the
church
and
prayed
.
In
his
prayers
there
was
one
*NL*
note
that
always
predominated
.
``
Give
me
strength
and
*NL*
courage
for
Thy
work
,
O
Lord
!
''
he
pleaded
,
kneeling
on
*NL*
the
bare
floor
and
bowing
his
head
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
task
that
lay
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reverend
Hartman
was
a
tall
man
with
a
brown
beard
.
*NL*
His
wife
,
a
stout
,
nervous
woman
,
was
the
daughter
of
a
*NL*
manufacturer
of
underwear
at
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.
The
*NL*
minister
himself
was
rather
a
favorite
in
the
town
.
The
*NL*
elders
of
the
church
liked
him
because
he
was
quiet
and
*NL*
unpretentious
and
Mrs.
White
,
the
banker
's
wife
,
*NL*
thought
him
scholarly
and
refined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Presbyterian
Church
held
itself
somewhat
aloof
from
*NL*
the
other
churches
of
Winesburg
.
It
was
larger
and
more
*NL*
imposing
and
its
minister
was
better
paid
.
He
even
had
*NL*
a
carriage
of
his
own
and
on
summer
evenings
sometimes
*NL*
drove
about
town
with
his
wife
.
Through
Main
Street
and
*NL*
up
and
down
Buckeye
Street
he
went
,
bowing
gravely
to
*NL*
the
people
,
while
his
wife
,
afire
with
secret
pride
,
*NL*
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
*NL*
worried
lest
the
horse
become
frightened
and
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
good
many
years
after
he
came
to
Winesburg
things
*NL*
went
well
with
Curtis
Hartman
.
He
was
not
one
to
arouse
*NL*
keen
enthusiasm
among
the
worshippers
in
his
church
but
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
he
made
no
enemies
.
In
reality
he
was
*NL*
much
in
earnest
and
sometimes
suffered
prolonged
*NL*
periods
of
remorse
because
he
could
not
go
crying
the
*NL*
word
of
God
in
the
highways
and
byways
of
the
town
.
He
*NL*
wondered
if
the
flame
of
the
spirit
really
burned
in
*NL*
him
and
dreamed
of
a
day
when
a
strong
sweet
new
*NL*
current
of
power
would
come
like
a
great
wind
into
his
*NL*
voice
and
his
soul
and
the
people
would
tremble
before
*NL*
the
spirit
of
God
made
manifest
in
him
.
``
I
am
a
poor
*NL*
stick
and
that
will
never
really
happen
to
me
,
''
he
*NL*
mused
dejectedly
,
and
then
a
patient
smile
lit
up
his
*NL*
features
.
``
Oh
well
,
I
suppose
I
'm
doing
well
enough
,
''
*NL*
he
added
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
the
bell
tower
of
the
church
,
where
on
*NL*
Sunday
mornings
the
minister
prayed
for
an
increase
in
*NL*
him
of
the
power
of
God
,
had
but
one
window
.
It
was
*NL*
long
and
narrow
and
swung
outward
on
a
hinge
like
a
*NL*
door
.
On
the
window
,
made
of
little
leaded
panes
,
was
a
*NL*
design
showing
the
Christ
laying
his
hand
upon
the
head
*NL*
of
a
child
.
One
Sunday
morning
in
the
summer
as
he
sat
*NL*
by
his
desk
in
the
room
with
a
large
Bible
opened
*NL*
before
him
,
and
the
sheets
of
his
sermon
scattered
*NL*
about
,
the
minister
was
shocked
to
see
,
in
the
upper
*NL*
room
of
the
house
next
door
,
a
woman
lying
in
her
bed
*NL*
and
smoking
a
cigarette
while
she
read
a
book
.
Curtis
*NL*
Hartman
went
on
tiptoe
to
the
window
and
closed
it
*NL*
softly
.
He
was
horror
stricken
at
the
thought
of
a
*NL*
woman
smoking
and
trembled
also
to
think
that
his
eyes
,
*NL*
just
raised
from
the
pages
of
the
book
of
God
,
had
*NL*
looked
upon
the
bare
shoulders
and
white
throat
of
a
*NL*
woman
.
With
his
brain
in
a
whirl
he
went
down
into
the
*NL*
pulpit
and
preached
a
long
sermon
without
once
thinking
*NL*
of
his
gestures
or
his
voice
.
The
sermon
attracted
*NL*
unusual
attention
because
of
its
power
and
clearness
.
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
she
is
listening
,
if
my
voice
is
carrying
*NL*
a
message
into
her
soul
,
''
he
thought
and
began
to
hope
*NL*
that
on
future
Sunday
mornings
he
might
be
able
to
say
*NL*
words
that
would
touch
and
awaken
the
woman
apparently
*NL*
far
gone
in
secret
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
next
door
to
the
Presbyterian
Church
,
through
*NL*
the
windows
of
which
the
minister
had
seen
the
sight
*NL*
that
had
so
upset
him
,
was
occupied
by
two
women
.
Aunt
*NL*
Elizabeth
Swift
,
a
grey
competent-looking
widow
with
*NL*
money
in
the
Winesburg
National
Bank
,
lived
there
with
*NL*
her
daughter
Kate
Swift
,
a
school
teacher
.
The
school
*NL*
teacher
was
thirty
years
old
and
had
a
neat
*NL*
trim-looking
figure
.
She
had
few
friends
and
bore
a
*NL*
reputation
of
having
a
sharp
tongue
.
When
he
began
to
*NL*
think
about
her
,
Curtis
Hartman
remembered
that
she
had
*NL*
been
to
Europe
and
had
lived
for
two
years
in
New
York
*NL*
City
.
``
Perhaps
after
all
her
smoking
means
nothing
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
He
began
to
remember
that
when
he
was
a
*NL*
student
in
college
and
occasionally
read
novels
,
good
*NL*
although
somewhat
worldly
women
,
had
smoked
through
the
*NL*
pages
of
a
book
that
had
once
fallen
into
his
hands
.
*NL*
With
a
rush
of
new
determination
he
worked
on
his
*NL*
sermons
all
through
the
week
and
forgot
,
in
his
zeal
to
*NL*
reach
the
ears
and
the
soul
of
this
new
listener
,
both
*NL*
his
embarrassment
in
the
pulpit
and
the
necessity
of
*NL*
prayer
in
the
study
on
Sunday
mornings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reverend
Hartman
's
experience
with
women
had
been
*NL*
somewhat
limited
.
He
was
the
son
of
a
wagon
maker
from
*NL*
Muncie
,
Indiana
,
and
had
worked
his
way
through
*NL*
college
.
The
daughter
of
the
underwear
manufacturer
had
*NL*
boarded
in
a
house
where
he
lived
during
his
school
*NL*
days
and
he
had
married
her
after
a
formal
and
*NL*
prolonged
courtship
,
carried
on
for
the
most
part
by
*NL*
the
girl
herself
.
On
his
marriage
day
the
underwear
*NL*
manufacturer
had
given
his
daughter
five
thousand
*NL*
dollars
and
he
promised
to
leave
her
at
least
twice
*NL*
that
amount
in
his
will
.
The
minister
had
thought
*NL*
himself
fortunate
in
marriage
and
had
never
permitted
*NL*
himself
to
think
of
other
women
.
He
did
not
want
to
*NL*
think
of
other
women
.
What
he
wanted
was
to
do
the
work
*NL*
of
God
quietly
and
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
soul
of
the
minister
a
struggle
awoke
.
From
*NL*
wanting
to
reach
the
ears
of
Kate
Swift
,
and
through
*NL*
his
sermons
to
delve
into
her
soul
,
he
began
to
want
*NL*
also
to
look
again
at
the
figure
lying
white
and
quiet
*NL*
in
the
bed
.
On
a
Sunday
morning
when
he
could
not
sleep
*NL*
because
of
his
thoughts
he
arose
and
went
to
walk
in
*NL*
the
streets
.
When
he
had
gone
along
Main
Street
almost
*NL*
to
the
old
Richmond
place
he
stopped
and
picking
up
a
*NL*
stone
rushed
off
to
the
room
in
the
bell
tower
.
With
*NL*
the
stone
he
broke
out
a
corner
of
the
window
and
then
*NL*
locked
the
door
and
sat
down
at
the
desk
before
the
*NL*
open
Bible
to
wait
.
When
the
shade
of
the
window
to
*NL*
Kate
Swift
's
room
was
raised
he
could
see
,
through
the
*NL*
hole
,
directly
into
her
bed
,
but
she
was
not
there
.
She
*NL*
also
had
arisen
and
had
gone
for
a
walk
and
the
hand
*NL*
that
raised
the
shade
was
the
hand
of
Aunt
Elizabeth
*NL*
Swift
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
almost
wept
with
joy
at
this
deliverance
*NL*
from
the
carnal
desire
to
``
peep
''
and
went
back
to
his
*NL*
own
house
praising
God
.
In
an
ill
moment
he
forgot
,
*NL*
however
,
to
stop
the
hole
in
the
window
.
The
piece
of
*NL*
glass
broken
out
at
the
corner
of
the
window
just
*NL*
nipped
off
the
bare
heel
of
the
boy
standing
motionless
*NL*
and
looking
with
rapt
eyes
into
the
face
of
the
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curtis
Hartman
forgot
his
sermon
on
that
Sunday
*NL*
morning
.
He
talked
to
his
congregation
and
in
his
talk
*NL*
said
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
people
to
think
of
their
*NL*
minister
as
a
man
set
aside
and
intended
by
nature
to
*NL*
lead
a
blameless
life
.
``
Out
of
my
own
experience
I
know
*NL*
that
we
,
who
are
the
ministers
of
God
's
word
,
are
beset
*NL*
by
the
same
temptations
that
assail
you
,
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
``
I
have
been
tempted
and
have
surrendered
to
*NL*
temptation
.
It
is
only
the
hand
of
God
,
placed
beneath
*NL*
my
head
,
that
has
raised
me
up
.
As
he
has
raised
me
so
*NL*
also
will
he
raise
you
.
Do
not
despair
.
In
your
hour
of
*NL*
sin
raise
your
eyes
to
the
skies
and
you
will
be
again
*NL*
and
again
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Resolutely
the
minister
put
the
thoughts
of
the
woman
*NL*
in
the
bed
out
of
his
mind
and
began
to
be
something
*NL*
like
a
lover
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
.
One
evening
*NL*
when
they
drove
out
together
he
turned
the
horse
out
of
*NL*
Buckeye
Street
and
in
the
darkness
on
Gospel
Hill
,
*NL*
above
Waterworks
Pond
,
put
his
arm
about
Sarah
*NL*
Hartman
's
waist
.
When
he
had
eaten
breakfast
in
the
*NL*
morning
and
was
ready
to
retire
to
his
study
at
the
*NL*
back
of
his
house
he
went
around
the
table
and
kissed
*NL*
his
wife
on
the
cheek
.
When
thoughts
of
Kate
Swift
came
*NL*
into
his
head
,
he
smiled
and
raised
his
eyes
to
the
*NL*
skies
.
``
Intercede
for
me
,
Master
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
keep
*NL*
me
in
the
narrow
path
intent
on
Thy
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
began
the
real
struggle
in
the
soul
of
the
*NL*
brown-bearded
minister
.
By
chance
he
discovered
that
*NL*
Kate
Swift
was
in
the
habit
of
lying
in
her
bed
in
the
*NL*
evenings
and
reading
a
book
.
A
lamp
stood
on
a
table
by
*NL*
the
side
of
the
bed
and
the
light
streamed
down
upon
*NL*
her
white
shoulders
and
bare
throat
.
On
the
evening
*NL*
when
he
made
the
discovery
the
minister
sat
at
the
desk
*NL*
in
the
dusty
room
from
nine
until
after
eleven
and
when
*NL*
her
light
was
put
out
stumbled
out
of
the
church
to
*NL*
spend
two
more
hours
walking
and
praying
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
He
did
not
want
to
kiss
the
shoulders
and
the
*NL*
throat
of
Kate
Swift
and
had
not
allowed
his
mind
to
*NL*
dwell
on
such
thoughts
.
He
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
.
*NL*
``
I
am
God
's
child
and
he
must
save
me
from
myself
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
in
the
darkness
under
the
trees
as
he
wandered
*NL*
in
the
streets
.
By
a
tree
he
stood
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
sky
that
was
covered
with
hurrying
clouds
.
He
began
to
*NL*
talk
to
God
intimately
and
closely
.
``
Please
,
Father
,
do
*NL*
not
forget
me
.
Give
me
power
to
go
tomorrow
and
repair
*NL*
the
hole
in
the
window
.
Lift
my
eyes
again
to
the
*NL*
skies
.
Stay
with
me
,
Thy
servant
,
in
his
hour
of
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
and
down
through
the
silent
streets
walked
the
*NL*
minister
and
for
days
and
weeks
his
soul
was
troubled
.
*NL*
He
could
not
understand
the
temptation
that
had
come
to
*NL*
him
nor
could
he
fathom
the
reason
for
its
coming
.
In
a
*NL*
way
he
began
to
blame
God
,
saying
to
himself
that
he
*NL*
had
tried
to
keep
his
feet
in
the
true
path
and
had
not
*NL*
run
about
seeking
sin
.
``
Through
my
days
as
a
young
man
*NL*
and
all
through
my
life
here
I
have
gone
quietly
about
*NL*
my
work
,
''
he
declared
.
``
Why
now
should
I
be
tempted
?
*NL*
What
have
I
done
that
this
burden
should
be
laid
on
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
times
during
the
early
fall
and
winter
of
that
*NL*
year
Curtis
Hartman
crept
out
of
his
house
to
the
room
*NL*
in
the
bell
tower
to
sit
in
the
darkness
looking
at
the
*NL*
figure
of
Kate
Swift
lying
in
her
bed
and
later
went
to
*NL*
walk
and
pray
in
the
streets
.
He
could
not
understand
*NL*
himself
.
For
weeks
he
would
go
along
scarcely
thinking
*NL*
of
the
school
teacher
and
telling
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
conquered
the
carnal
desire
to
look
at
her
body
.
And
*NL*
then
something
would
happen
.
As
he
sat
in
the
study
of
*NL*
his
own
house
,
hard
at
work
on
a
sermon
,
he
would
*NL*
become
nervous
and
begin
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
*NL*
``
I
will
go
out
into
the
streets
,
''
he
told
himself
and
*NL*
even
as
he
let
himself
in
at
the
church
door
he
*NL*
persistently
denied
to
himself
the
cause
of
his
being
*NL*
there
.
``
I
will
not
repair
the
hole
in
the
window
and
I
*NL*
will
train
myself
to
come
here
at
night
and
sit
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
this
woman
without
raising
my
eyes
.
I
will
*NL*
not
be
defeated
in
this
thing
.
The
Lord
has
devised
*NL*
this
temptation
as
a
test
of
my
soul
and
I
will
grope
*NL*
my
way
out
of
darkness
into
the
light
of
*NL*
righteousness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
in
January
when
it
was
bitter
cold
and
snow
*NL*
lay
deep
on
the
streets
of
Winesburg
Curtis
Hartman
*NL*
paid
his
last
visit
to
the
room
in
the
bell
tower
of
*NL*
the
church
.
It
was
past
nine
o'clock
when
he
left
his
*NL*
own
house
and
he
set
out
so
hurriedly
that
he
forgot
to
*NL*
put
on
his
overshoes
.
In
Main
Street
no
one
was
abroad
*NL*
but
Hop
Higgins
the
night
watchman
and
in
the
whole
*NL*
town
no
one
was
awake
but
the
watchman
and
young
George
*NL*
Willard
,
who
sat
in
the
office
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
*NL*
trying
to
write
a
story
.
Along
the
street
to
the
church
*NL*
went
the
minister
,
plowing
through
the
drifts
and
*NL*
thinking
that
this
time
he
would
utterly
give
way
to
*NL*
sin
.
``
I
want
to
look
at
the
woman
and
to
think
of
*NL*
kissing
her
shoulders
and
I
am
going
to
let
myself
*NL*
think
what
I
choose
,
''
he
declared
bitterly
and
tears
*NL*
came
into
his
eyes
.
He
began
to
think
that
he
would
get
*NL*
out
of
the
ministry
and
try
some
other
way
of
life
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
go
to
some
city
and
get
into
business
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
.
``
If
my
nature
is
such
that
I
can
not
resist
*NL*
sin
,
I
shall
give
myself
over
to
sin
.
At
least
I
shall
*NL*
not
be
a
hypocrite
,
preaching
the
word
of
God
with
my
*NL*
mind
thinking
of
the
shoulders
and
neck
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
does
not
belong
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
cold
in
the
room
of
the
bell
tower
of
the
church
*NL*
on
that
January
night
and
almost
as
soon
as
he
came
*NL*
into
the
room
Curtis
Hartman
knew
that
if
he
stayed
he
*NL*
would
be
ill
.
His
feet
were
wet
from
tramping
in
the
*NL*
snow
and
there
was
no
fire
.
In
the
room
in
the
house
*NL*
next
door
Kate
Swift
had
not
yet
appeared
.
With
grim
*NL*
determination
the
man
sat
down
to
wait
.
Sitting
in
the
*NL*
chair
and
gripping
the
edge
of
the
desk
on
which
lay
*NL*
the
Bible
he
stared
into
the
darkness
thinking
the
*NL*
blackest
thoughts
of
his
life
.
He
thought
of
his
wife
*NL*
and
for
the
moment
almost
hated
her
.
``
She
has
always
*NL*
been
ashamed
of
passion
and
has
cheated
me
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
Man
has
a
right
to
expect
living
passion
and
*NL*
beauty
in
a
woman
.
He
has
no
right
to
forget
that
he
is
*NL*
an
animal
and
in
me
there
is
something
that
is
Greek
.
I
*NL*
will
throw
off
the
woman
of
my
bosom
and
seek
other
*NL*
women
.
I
will
besiege
this
school
teacher
.
I
will
fly
*NL*
in
the
face
of
all
men
and
if
I
am
a
creature
of
carnal
*NL*
lusts
I
will
live
then
for
my
lusts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
distracted
man
trembled
from
head
to
foot
,
partly
*NL*
from
cold
,
partly
from
the
struggle
in
which
he
was
*NL*
engaged
.
Hours
passed
and
a
fever
assailed
his
body
.
*NL*
His
throat
began
to
hurt
and
his
teeth
chattered
.
His
*NL*
feet
on
the
study
floor
felt
like
two
cakes
of
ice
.
*NL*
Still
he
would
not
give
up
.
``
I
will
see
this
woman
and
*NL*
will
think
the
thoughts
I
have
never
dared
to
think
,
''
*NL*
he
told
himself
,
gripping
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curtis
Hartman
came
near
dying
from
the
effects
of
that
*NL*
night
of
waiting
in
the
church
,
and
also
he
found
in
*NL*
the
thing
that
happened
what
he
took
to
be
the
way
of
*NL*
life
for
him
.
On
other
evenings
when
he
had
waited
he
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
see
,
through
the
little
hole
in
*NL*
the
glass
,
any
part
of
the
school
teacher
's
room
except
*NL*
that
occupied
by
her
bed
.
In
the
darkness
he
had
waited
*NL*
until
the
woman
suddenly
appeared
sitting
in
the
bed
in
*NL*
her
white
nightrobe
.
When
the
light
was
turned
up
she
*NL*
propped
herself
up
among
the
pillows
and
read
a
book
.
*NL*
Sometimes
she
smoked
one
of
the
cigarettes
.
Only
her
*NL*
bare
shoulders
and
throat
were
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
January
night
,
after
he
had
come
near
dying
with
*NL*
cold
and
after
his
mind
had
two
or
three
times
actually
*NL*
slipped
away
into
an
odd
land
of
fantasy
so
that
he
had
*NL*
by
an
exercise
of
will
power
to
force
himself
back
into
*NL*
consciousness
,
Kate
Swift
appeared
.
In
the
room
next
*NL*
door
a
lamp
was
lighted
and
the
waiting
man
stared
into
*NL*
an
empty
bed
.
Then
upon
the
bed
before
his
eyes
a
naked
*NL*
woman
threw
herself
.
Lying
face
downward
she
wept
and
*NL*
beat
with
her
fists
upon
the
pillow
.
With
a
final
*NL*
outburst
of
weeping
she
half
arose
,
and
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
man
who
had
waited
to
look
and
not
to
think
*NL*
thoughts
the
woman
of
sin
began
to
pray
.
In
the
*NL*
lamplight
her
figure
,
slim
and
strong
,
looked
like
the
*NL*
figure
of
the
boy
in
the
presence
of
the
Christ
on
the
*NL*
leaded
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curtis
Hartman
never
remembered
how
he
got
out
of
the
*NL*
church
.
With
a
cry
he
arose
,
dragging
the
heavy
desk
*NL*
along
the
floor
.
The
Bible
fell
,
making
a
great
clatter
*NL*
in
the
silence
.
When
the
light
in
the
house
next
door
*NL*
went
out
he
stumbled
down
the
stairway
and
into
the
*NL*
street
.
Along
the
street
he
went
and
ran
in
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
.
To
George
Willard
,
who
was
*NL*
tramping
up
and
down
in
the
office
undergoing
a
*NL*
struggle
of
his
own
,
he
began
to
talk
half
*NL*
incoherently
.
``
The
ways
of
God
are
beyond
human
*NL*
understanding
,
''
he
cried
,
running
in
quickly
and
*NL*
closing
the
door
.
He
began
to
advance
upon
the
young
*NL*
man
,
his
eyes
glowing
and
his
voice
ringing
with
*NL*
fervor
.
``
I
have
found
the
light
,
''
he
cried
.
``
After
ten
*NL*
years
in
this
town
,
God
has
manifested
himself
to
me
in
*NL*
the
body
of
a
woman
.
''
His
voice
dropped
and
he
began
to
*NL*
whisper
.
``
I
did
not
understand
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
I
took
*NL*
to
be
a
trial
of
my
soul
was
only
a
preparation
for
a
*NL*
new
and
more
beautiful
fervor
of
the
spirit
.
God
has
*NL*
appeared
to
me
in
the
person
of
Kate
Swift
,
the
school
*NL*
teacher
,
kneeling
naked
on
a
bed
.
Do
you
know
Kate
*NL*
Swift
?
Although
she
may
not
be
aware
of
it
,
she
is
an
*NL*
instrument
of
God
,
bearing
the
message
of
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reverend
Curtis
Hartman
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
*NL*
office
.
At
the
door
he
stopped
,
and
after
looking
up
*NL*
and
down
the
deserted
street
,
turned
again
to
George
*NL*
Willard
.
``
I
am
delivered
.
Have
no
fear
.
''
He
held
up
a
*NL*
bleeding
fist
for
the
young
man
to
see
.
``
I
smashed
the
*NL*
glass
of
the
window
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Now
it
will
have
to
be
*NL*
wholly
replaced
.
The
strength
of
God
was
in
me
and
I
*NL*
broke
it
with
my
fist
.

THE
TEACHER
*NL*
*NL*
Snow
lay
deep
in
the
streets
of
Winesburg
.
It
had
*NL*
begun
to
snow
about
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
a
*NL*
wind
sprang
up
and
blew
the
snow
in
clouds
along
Main
*NL*
Street
.
The
frozen
mud
roads
that
led
into
town
were
*NL*
fairly
smooth
and
in
places
ice
covered
the
mud
.
``
There
*NL*
will
be
good
sleighing
,
''
said
Will
Henderson
,
standing
*NL*
by
the
bar
in
Ed
Griffith
's
saloon
.
Out
of
the
saloon
*NL*
he
went
and
met
Sylvester
West
the
druggist
stumbling
*NL*
along
in
the
kind
of
heavy
overshoes
called
arctics
.
*NL*
``
Snow
will
bring
the
people
into
town
on
Saturday
,
''
*NL*
said
the
druggist
.
The
two
men
stopped
and
discussed
*NL*
their
affairs
.
Will
Henderson
,
who
had
on
a
light
*NL*
overcoat
and
no
overshoes
,
kicked
the
heel
of
his
left
*NL*
foot
with
the
toe
of
the
right
.
``
Snow
will
be
good
for
*NL*
the
wheat
,
''
observed
the
druggist
sagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
George
Willard
,
who
had
nothing
to
do
,
was
glad
*NL*
because
he
did
not
feel
like
working
that
day
.
The
*NL*
weekly
paper
had
been
printed
and
taken
to
the
post
*NL*
office
Wednesday
evening
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
on
*NL*
Thursday
.
At
eight
o'clock
,
after
the
morning
train
had
*NL*
passed
,
he
put
a
pair
of
skates
in
his
pocket
and
went
*NL*
up
to
Waterworks
Pond
but
did
not
go
skating
.
Past
the
*NL*
pond
and
along
a
path
that
followed
Wine
Creek
he
went
*NL*
until
he
came
to
a
grove
of
beech
trees
.
There
he
built
*NL*
a
fire
against
the
side
of
a
log
and
sat
down
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
log
to
think
.
When
the
snow
began
to
fall
*NL*
and
the
wind
to
blow
he
hurried
about
getting
fuel
for
*NL*
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
reporter
was
thinking
of
Kate
Swift
,
who
had
*NL*
once
been
his
school
teacher
.
On
the
evening
before
he
*NL*
had
gone
to
her
house
to
get
a
book
she
wanted
him
to
*NL*
read
and
had
been
alone
with
her
for
an
hour
.
For
the
*NL*
fourth
or
fifth
time
the
woman
had
talked
to
him
with
*NL*
great
earnestness
and
he
could
not
make
out
what
she
*NL*
meant
by
her
talk
.
He
began
to
believe
she
must
be
in
*NL*
love
with
him
and
the
thought
was
both
pleasing
and
*NL*
annoying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
from
the
log
he
sprang
and
began
to
pile
sticks
on
*NL*
the
fire
.
Looking
about
to
be
sure
he
was
alone
he
*NL*
talked
aloud
pretending
he
was
in
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
woman
,
``
Oh
,
you
're
just
letting
on
,
you
know
you
are
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
.
``
I
am
going
to
find
out
about
you
.
You
*NL*
wait
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
got
up
and
went
back
along
the
path
*NL*
toward
town
leaving
the
fire
blazing
in
the
wood
.
As
he
*NL*
went
through
the
streets
the
skates
clanked
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
In
his
own
room
in
the
New
Willard
House
he
*NL*
built
a
fire
in
the
stove
and
lay
down
on
top
of
the
*NL*
bed
.
He
began
to
have
lustful
thoughts
and
pulling
down
*NL*
the
shade
of
the
window
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
his
*NL*
face
to
the
wall
.
He
took
a
pillow
into
his
arms
and
*NL*
embraced
it
thinking
first
of
the
school
teacher
,
who
*NL*
by
her
words
had
stirred
something
within
him
,
and
*NL*
later
of
Helen
White
,
the
slim
daughter
of
the
town
*NL*
banker
,
with
whom
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
half
in
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
nine
o'clock
of
that
evening
snow
lay
deep
in
the
*NL*
streets
and
the
weather
had
become
bitter
cold
.
It
was
*NL*
difficult
to
walk
about
.
The
stores
were
dark
and
the
*NL*
people
had
crawled
away
to
their
houses
.
The
evening
*NL*
train
from
Cleveland
was
very
late
but
nobody
was
*NL*
interested
in
its
arrival
.
By
ten
o'clock
all
but
four
*NL*
of
the
eighteen
hundred
citizens
of
the
town
were
in
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hop
Higgins
,
the
night
watchman
,
was
partially
awake
.
*NL*
He
was
lame
and
carried
a
heavy
stick
.
On
dark
nights
*NL*
he
carried
a
lantern
.
Between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
he
*NL*
went
his
rounds
.
Up
and
down
Main
Street
he
stumbled
*NL*
through
the
drifts
trying
the
doors
of
the
stores
.
Then
*NL*
he
went
into
alleyways
and
tried
the
back
doors
.
*NL*
Finding
all
tight
he
hurried
around
the
corner
to
the
*NL*
New
Willard
House
and
beat
on
the
door
.
Through
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
night
he
intended
to
stay
by
the
stove
.
*NL*
``
You
go
to
bed
.
I
'll
keep
the
stove
going
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
the
boy
who
slept
on
a
cot
in
the
hotel
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hop
Higgins
sat
down
by
the
stove
and
took
off
his
*NL*
shoes
.
When
the
boy
had
gone
to
sleep
he
began
to
think
*NL*
of
his
own
affairs
.
He
intended
to
paint
his
house
in
*NL*
the
spring
and
sat
by
the
stove
calculating
the
cost
of
*NL*
paint
and
labor
.
That
led
him
into
other
calculations
.
*NL*
The
night
watchman
was
sixty
years
old
and
wanted
to
*NL*
retire
.
He
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
Civil
War
and
drew
*NL*
a
small
pension
.
He
hoped
to
find
some
new
method
of
*NL*
making
a
living
and
aspired
to
become
a
professional
*NL*
breeder
of
ferrets
.
Already
he
had
four
of
the
*NL*
strangely
shaped
savage
little
creatures
,
that
are
used
*NL*
by
sportsmen
in
the
pursuit
of
rabbits
,
in
the
cellar
*NL*
of
his
house
.
``
Now
I
have
one
male
and
three
females
,
''
*NL*
he
mused
.
``
If
I
am
lucky
by
spring
I
shall
have
twelve
*NL*
or
fifteen
.
In
another
year
I
shall
be
able
to
begin
*NL*
advertising
ferrets
for
sale
in
the
sporting
papers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nightwatchman
settled
into
his
chair
and
his
mind
*NL*
became
a
blank
.
He
did
not
sleep
.
By
years
of
practice
*NL*
he
had
trained
himself
to
sit
for
hours
through
the
*NL*
long
nights
neither
asleep
nor
awake
.
In
the
morning
he
*NL*
was
almost
as
refreshed
as
though
he
had
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Hop
Higgins
safely
stowed
away
in
the
chair
behind
*NL*
the
stove
only
three
people
were
awake
in
Winesburg
.
*NL*
George
Willard
was
in
the
office
of
the
Eagle
*NL*
pretending
to
be
at
work
on
the
writing
of
a
story
but
*NL*
in
reality
continuing
the
mood
of
the
morning
by
the
*NL*
fire
in
the
wood
.
In
the
bell
tower
of
the
Presbyterian
*NL*
Church
the
Reverend
Curtis
Hartman
was
sitting
in
the
*NL*
darkness
preparing
himself
for
a
revelation
from
God
,
*NL*
and
Kate
Swift
,
the
school
teacher
,
was
leaving
her
*NL*
house
for
a
walk
in
the
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
ten
o'clock
when
Kate
Swift
set
out
and
the
*NL*
walk
was
unpremeditated
.
It
was
as
though
the
man
and
*NL*
the
boy
,
by
thinking
of
her
,
had
driven
her
forth
into
*NL*
the
wintry
streets
.
Aunt
Elizabeth
Swift
had
gone
to
*NL*
the
county
seat
concerning
some
business
in
connection
*NL*
with
mortgages
in
which
she
had
money
invested
and
*NL*
would
not
be
back
until
the
next
day
.
By
a
huge
stove
,
*NL*
called
a
base
burner
,
in
the
living
room
of
the
house
*NL*
sat
the
daughter
reading
a
book
.
Suddenly
she
sprang
to
*NL*
her
feet
and
,
snatching
a
cloak
from
a
rack
by
the
*NL*
front
door
,
ran
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
age
of
thirty
Kate
Swift
was
not
known
in
*NL*
Winesburg
as
a
pretty
woman
.
Her
complexion
was
not
*NL*
good
and
her
face
was
covered
with
blotches
that
*NL*
indicated
ill
health
.
Alone
in
the
night
in
the
winter
*NL*
streets
she
was
lovely
.
Her
back
was
straight
,
her
*NL*
shoulders
square
,
and
her
features
were
as
the
features
*NL*
of
a
tiny
goddess
on
a
pedestal
in
a
garden
in
the
dim
*NL*
light
of
a
summer
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
afternoon
the
school
teacher
had
been
to
see
*NL*
Doctor
Welling
concerning
her
health
.
The
doctor
had
*NL*
scolded
her
and
had
declared
she
was
in
danger
of
*NL*
losing
her
hearing
.
It
was
foolish
for
Kate
Swift
to
be
*NL*
abroad
in
the
storm
,
foolish
and
perhaps
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
in
the
streets
did
not
remember
the
words
of
*NL*
the
doctor
and
would
not
have
turned
back
had
she
*NL*
remembered
.
She
was
very
cold
but
after
walking
for
*NL*
five
minutes
no
longer
minded
the
cold
.
First
she
went
*NL*
to
the
end
of
her
own
street
and
then
across
a
pair
of
*NL*
hay
scales
set
in
the
ground
before
a
feed
barn
and
*NL*
into
Trunion
Pike
.
Along
Trunion
Pike
she
went
to
Ned
*NL*
Winters
'
barn
and
turning
east
followed
a
street
of
low
*NL*
frame
houses
that
led
over
Gospel
Hill
and
into
Sucker
*NL*
Road
that
ran
down
a
shallow
valley
past
Ike
Smead
's
*NL*
chicken
farm
to
Waterworks
Pond
.
As
she
went
along
,
the
*NL*
bold
,
excited
mood
that
had
driven
her
out
of
doors
*NL*
passed
and
then
returned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
biting
and
forbidding
in
the
*NL*
character
of
Kate
Swift
.
Everyone
felt
it
.
In
the
*NL*
schoolroom
she
was
silent
,
cold
,
and
stern
,
and
yet
in
*NL*
an
odd
way
very
close
to
her
pupils
.
Once
in
a
long
*NL*
while
something
seemed
to
have
come
over
her
and
she
*NL*
was
happy
.
All
of
the
children
in
the
schoolroom
felt
*NL*
the
effect
of
her
happiness
.
For
a
time
they
did
not
*NL*
work
but
sat
back
in
their
chairs
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
hands
clasped
behind
her
back
the
school
teacher
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
in
the
schoolroom
and
talked
very
*NL*
rapidly
.
It
did
not
seem
to
matter
what
subject
came
*NL*
into
her
mind
.
Once
she
talked
to
the
children
of
*NL*
Charles
Lamb
and
made
up
strange
,
intimate
little
*NL*
stories
concerning
the
life
of
the
dead
writer
.
The
*NL*
stories
were
told
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
lived
in
*NL*
a
house
with
Charles
Lamb
and
knew
all
the
secrets
of
*NL*
his
private
life
.
The
children
were
somewhat
confused
,
*NL*
thinking
Charles
Lamb
must
be
someone
who
had
once
*NL*
lived
in
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
the
teacher
talked
to
the
children
*NL*
of
Benvenuto
Cellini
.
That
time
they
laughed
.
What
a
*NL*
bragging
,
blustering
,
brave
,
lovable
fellow
she
made
of
*NL*
the
old
artist
!
Concerning
him
also
she
invented
*NL*
anecdotes
.
There
was
one
of
a
German
music
teacher
who
*NL*
had
a
room
above
Cellini
's
lodgings
in
the
city
of
*NL*
Milan
that
made
the
boys
guffaw
.
Sugars
McNutts
,
a
fat
*NL*
boy
with
red
cheeks
,
laughed
so
hard
that
he
became
*NL*
dizzy
and
fell
off
his
seat
and
Kate
Swift
laughed
with
*NL*
him
.
Then
suddenly
she
became
again
cold
and
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
winter
night
when
she
walked
through
the
*NL*
deserted
snow-covered
streets
,
a
crisis
had
come
into
*NL*
the
life
of
the
school
teacher
.
Although
no
one
in
*NL*
Winesburg
would
have
suspected
it
,
her
life
had
been
*NL*
very
adventurous
.
It
was
still
adventurous
.
Day
by
day
*NL*
as
she
worked
in
the
schoolroom
or
walked
in
the
*NL*
streets
,
grief
,
hope
,
and
desire
fought
within
her
.
*NL*
Behind
a
cold
exterior
the
most
extraordinary
events
*NL*
transpired
in
her
mind
.
The
people
of
the
town
thought
*NL*
of
her
as
a
confirmed
old
maid
and
because
she
spoke
*NL*
sharply
and
went
her
own
way
thought
her
lacking
in
all
*NL*
the
human
feeling
that
did
so
much
to
make
and
mar
*NL*
their
own
lives
.
In
reality
she
was
the
most
eagerly
*NL*
passionate
soul
among
them
,
and
more
than
once
,
in
the
*NL*
five
years
since
she
had
come
back
from
her
travels
to
*NL*
settle
in
Winesburg
and
become
a
school
teacher
,
had
*NL*
been
compelled
to
go
out
of
the
house
and
walk
half
*NL*
through
the
night
fighting
out
some
battle
raging
*NL*
within
.
Once
on
a
night
when
it
rained
she
had
stayed
*NL*
out
six
hours
and
when
she
came
home
had
a
quarrel
with
*NL*
Aunt
Elizabeth
Swift
.
``
I
am
glad
you
're
not
a
man
,
''
*NL*
said
the
mother
sharply
.
``
More
than
once
I
've
waited
*NL*
for
your
father
to
come
home
,
not
knowing
what
new
mess
*NL*
he
had
got
into
.
I
've
had
my
share
of
uncertainty
and
*NL*
you
can
not
blame
me
if
I
do
not
want
to
see
the
worst
*NL*
side
of
him
reproduced
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Kate
Swift
's
mind
was
ablaze
with
thoughts
of
George
*NL*
Willard
.
In
something
he
had
written
as
a
school
boy
*NL*
she
thought
she
had
recognized
the
spark
of
genius
and
*NL*
wanted
to
blow
on
the
spark
.
One
day
in
the
summer
she
*NL*
had
gone
to
the
Eagle
office
and
finding
the
boy
*NL*
unoccupied
had
taken
him
out
Main
Street
to
the
Fair
*NL*
Ground
,
where
the
two
sat
on
a
grassy
bank
and
talked
.
*NL*
The
school
teacher
tried
to
bring
home
to
the
mind
of
*NL*
the
boy
some
conception
of
the
difficulties
he
would
*NL*
have
to
face
as
a
writer
.
``
You
will
have
to
know
life
,
''
*NL*
she
declared
,
and
her
voice
trembled
with
earnestness
.
*NL*
She
took
hold
of
George
Willard
's
shoulders
and
turned
*NL*
him
about
so
that
she
could
look
into
his
eyes
.
A
*NL*
passer-by
might
have
thought
them
about
to
embrace
.
``
If
*NL*
you
are
to
become
a
writer
you
'll
have
to
stop
fooling
*NL*
with
words
,
''
she
explained
.
``
It
would
be
better
to
give
*NL*
up
the
notion
of
writing
until
you
are
better
prepared
.
*NL*
Now
it
's
time
to
be
living
.
I
do
n't
want
to
frighten
*NL*
you
,
but
I
would
like
to
make
you
understand
the
import
*NL*
of
what
you
think
of
attempting
.
You
must
not
become
a
*NL*
mere
peddler
of
words
.
The
thing
to
learn
is
to
know
*NL*
what
people
are
thinking
about
,
not
what
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
before
that
stormy
Thursday
night
when
*NL*
the
Reverend
Curtis
Hartman
sat
in
the
bell
tower
of
*NL*
the
church
waiting
to
look
at
her
body
,
young
Willard
*NL*
had
gone
to
visit
the
teacher
and
to
borrow
a
book
.
It
*NL*
was
then
the
thing
happened
that
confused
and
puzzled
*NL*
the
boy
.
He
had
the
book
under
his
arm
and
was
*NL*
preparing
to
depart
.
Again
Kate
Swift
talked
with
great
*NL*
earnestness
.
Night
was
coming
on
and
the
light
in
the
*NL*
room
grew
dim
.
As
he
turned
to
go
she
spoke
his
name
*NL*
softly
and
with
an
impulsive
movement
took
hold
of
his
*NL*
hand
.
Because
the
reporter
was
rapidly
becoming
a
man
*NL*
something
of
his
man
's
appeal
,
combined
with
the
*NL*
winsomeness
of
the
boy
,
stirred
the
heart
of
the
lonely
*NL*
woman
.
A
passionate
desire
to
have
him
understand
the
*NL*
import
of
life
,
to
learn
to
interpret
it
truly
and
*NL*
honestly
,
swept
over
her
.
Leaning
forward
,
her
lips
*NL*
brushed
his
cheek
.
At
the
same
moment
he
for
the
first
*NL*
time
became
aware
of
the
marked
beauty
of
her
features
.
*NL*
They
were
both
embarrassed
,
and
to
relieve
her
feeling
*NL*
she
became
harsh
and
domineering
.
``
What
's
the
use
?
It
*NL*
will
be
ten
years
before
you
begin
to
understand
what
I
*NL*
mean
when
I
talk
to
you
,
''
she
cried
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
night
of
the
storm
and
while
the
minister
sat
in
*NL*
the
church
waiting
for
her
,
Kate
Swift
went
to
the
*NL*
office
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
,
intending
to
have
*NL*
another
talk
with
the
boy
.
After
the
long
walk
in
the
*NL*
snow
she
was
cold
,
lonely
,
and
tired
.
As
she
came
*NL*
through
Main
Street
she
saw
the
fight
from
the
*NL*
printshop
window
shining
on
the
snow
and
on
an
impulse
*NL*
opened
the
door
and
went
in
.
For
an
hour
she
sat
by
the
*NL*
stove
in
the
office
talking
of
life
.
She
talked
with
*NL*
passionate
earnestness
.
The
impulse
that
had
driven
her
*NL*
out
into
the
snow
poured
itself
out
into
talk
.
She
*NL*
became
inspired
as
she
sometimes
did
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
children
in
school
.
A
great
eagerness
to
open
the
*NL*
door
of
life
to
the
boy
,
who
had
been
her
pupil
and
who
*NL*
she
thought
might
possess
a
talent
for
the
*NL*
understanding
of
life
,
had
possession
of
her
.
So
strong
*NL*
was
her
passion
that
it
became
something
physical
.
*NL*
Again
her
hands
took
hold
of
his
shoulders
and
she
*NL*
turned
him
about
.
In
the
dim
light
her
eyes
blazed
.
She
*NL*
arose
and
laughed
,
not
sharply
as
was
customary
with
*NL*
her
,
but
in
a
queer
,
hesitating
way
.
``
I
must
be
going
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
In
a
moment
,
if
I
stay
,
I
'll
be
wanting
to
*NL*
kiss
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
newspaper
office
a
confusion
arose
.
Kate
Swift
*NL*
turned
and
walked
to
the
door
.
She
was
a
teacher
but
*NL*
she
was
also
a
woman
.
As
she
looked
at
George
Willard
,
*NL*
the
passionate
desire
to
be
loved
by
a
man
,
that
had
a
*NL*
thousand
times
before
swept
like
a
storm
over
her
body
,
*NL*
took
possession
of
her
.
In
the
lamplight
George
Willard
*NL*
looked
no
longer
a
boy
,
but
a
man
ready
to
play
the
*NL*
part
of
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
school
teacher
let
George
Willard
take
her
into
his
*NL*
arms
.
In
the
warm
little
office
the
air
became
suddenly
*NL*
heavy
and
the
strength
went
out
of
her
body
.
Leaning
*NL*
against
a
low
counter
by
the
door
she
waited
.
When
he
*NL*
came
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
turned
and
let
*NL*
her
body
fall
heavily
against
him
.
For
George
Willard
*NL*
the
confusion
was
immediately
increased
.
For
a
moment
*NL*
he
held
the
body
of
the
woman
tightly
against
his
body
*NL*
and
then
it
stiffened
.
Two
sharp
little
fists
began
to
*NL*
beat
on
his
face
.
When
the
school
teacher
had
run
away
*NL*
and
left
him
alone
,
he
walked
up
and
down
the
office
*NL*
swearing
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
into
this
confusion
that
the
Reverend
Curtis
*NL*
Hartman
protruded
himself
.
When
he
came
in
George
*NL*
Willard
thought
the
town
had
gone
mad
.
Shaking
a
*NL*
bleeding
fist
in
the
air
,
the
minister
proclaimed
the
*NL*
woman
George
had
only
a
moment
before
held
in
his
arms
*NL*
an
instrument
of
God
bearing
a
message
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
George
blew
out
the
lamp
by
the
window
and
locking
the
*NL*
door
of
the
printshop
went
home
.
Through
the
hotel
*NL*
office
,
past
Hop
Higgins
lost
in
his
dream
of
the
*NL*
raising
of
ferrets
,
he
went
and
up
into
his
own
room
.
*NL*
The
fire
in
the
stove
had
gone
out
and
he
undressed
in
*NL*
the
cold
.
When
he
got
into
bed
the
sheets
were
like
*NL*
blankets
of
dry
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
rolled
about
in
the
bed
on
which
he
had
*NL*
lain
in
the
afternoon
hugging
the
pillow
and
thinking
*NL*
thoughts
of
Kate
Swift
.
The
words
of
the
minister
,
who
*NL*
he
thought
had
gone
suddenly
insane
,
rang
in
his
ears
.
*NL*
His
eyes
stared
about
the
room
.
The
resentment
,
natural
*NL*
to
the
baffled
male
,
passed
and
he
tried
to
understand
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
He
could
not
make
it
out
.
Over
and
*NL*
over
he
turned
the
matter
in
his
mind
.
Hours
passed
and
*NL*
he
began
to
think
it
must
be
time
for
another
day
to
*NL*
come
.
At
four
o'clock
he
pulled
the
covers
up
about
his
*NL*
neck
and
tried
to
sleep
.
When
he
became
drowsy
and
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
,
he
raised
a
hand
and
with
it
groped
*NL*
about
in
the
darkness
.
``
I
have
missed
something
.
I
have
*NL*
missed
something
Kate
Swift
was
trying
to
tell
me
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
sleepily
.
Then
he
slept
and
in
all
Winesburg
*NL*
he
was
the
last
soul
on
that
winter
night
to
go
to
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
LONELINESS
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
son
of
Mrs.
Al
Robinson
who
once
owned
a
*NL*
farm
on
a
side
road
leading
off
Trunion
Pike
,
east
of
*NL*
Winesburg
and
two
miles
beyond
the
town
limits
.
The
*NL*
farmhouse
was
painted
brown
and
the
blinds
to
all
of
*NL*
the
windows
facing
the
road
were
kept
closed
.
In
the
*NL*
road
before
the
house
a
flock
of
chickens
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
two
guinea
hens
,
lay
in
the
deep
dust
.
Enoch
lived
*NL*
in
the
house
with
his
mother
in
those
days
and
when
he
*NL*
was
a
young
boy
went
to
school
at
the
Winesburg
High
*NL*
School
.
Old
citizens
remembered
him
as
a
quiet
,
smiling
*NL*
youth
inclined
to
silence
.
He
walked
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
road
when
he
came
into
town
and
sometimes
read
a
*NL*
book
.
Drivers
of
teams
had
to
shout
and
swear
to
make
*NL*
him
realize
where
he
was
so
that
he
would
turn
out
of
*NL*
the
beaten
track
and
let
them
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
twenty-one
years
old
Enoch
went
to
New
York
*NL*
City
and
was
a
city
man
for
fifteen
years
.
He
studied
*NL*
French
and
went
to
an
art
school
,
hoping
to
develop
a
*NL*
faculty
he
had
for
drawing
.
In
his
own
mind
he
planned
*NL*
to
go
to
Paris
and
to
finish
his
art
education
among
*NL*
the
masters
there
,
but
that
never
turned
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
ever
turned
out
for
Enoch
Robinson
.
He
could
*NL*
draw
well
enough
and
he
had
many
odd
delicate
thoughts
*NL*
hidden
away
in
his
brain
that
might
have
expressed
*NL*
themselves
through
the
brush
of
a
painter
,
but
he
was
*NL*
always
a
child
and
that
was
a
handicap
to
his
worldly
*NL*
development
.
He
never
grew
up
and
of
course
he
could
n't
*NL*
understand
people
and
he
could
n't
make
people
*NL*
understand
him
.
The
child
in
him
kept
bumping
against
*NL*
things
,
against
actualities
like
money
and
sex
and
*NL*
opinions
.
Once
he
was
hit
by
a
street
car
and
thrown
*NL*
against
an
iron
post
.
That
made
him
lame
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
the
many
things
that
kept
things
from
turning
out
for
*NL*
Enoch
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
New
York
City
,
when
he
first
went
there
to
live
and
*NL*
before
he
became
confused
and
disconcerted
by
the
facts
*NL*
of
life
,
Enoch
went
about
a
good
deal
with
young
men
.
*NL*
He
got
into
a
group
of
other
young
artists
,
both
men
*NL*
and
women
,
and
in
the
evenings
they
sometimes
came
to
*NL*
visit
him
in
his
room
.
Once
he
got
drunk
and
was
taken
*NL*
to
a
police
station
where
a
police
magistrate
*NL*
frightened
him
horribly
,
and
once
he
tried
to
have
an
*NL*
affair
with
a
woman
of
the
town
met
on
the
sidewalk
*NL*
before
his
lodging
house
.
The
woman
and
Enoch
walked
*NL*
together
three
blocks
and
then
the
young
man
grew
*NL*
afraid
and
ran
away
.
The
woman
had
been
drinking
and
*NL*
the
incident
amused
her
.
She
leaned
against
the
wall
of
*NL*
a
building
and
laughed
so
heartily
that
another
man
*NL*
stopped
and
laughed
with
her
.
The
two
went
away
*NL*
together
,
still
laughing
,
and
Enoch
crept
off
to
his
*NL*
room
trembling
and
vexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
in
which
young
Robinson
lived
in
New
York
*NL*
faced
Washington
Square
and
was
long
and
narrow
like
a
*NL*
hallway
.
It
is
important
to
get
that
fixed
in
your
*NL*
mind
.
The
story
of
Enoch
is
in
fact
the
story
of
a
room
*NL*
almost
more
than
it
is
the
story
of
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
into
the
room
in
the
evening
came
young
Enoch
's
*NL*
friends
.
There
was
nothing
particularly
striking
about
*NL*
them
except
that
they
were
artists
of
the
kind
that
*NL*
talk
.
Everyone
knows
of
the
talking
artists
.
Throughout
*NL*
all
of
the
known
history
of
the
world
they
have
*NL*
gathered
in
rooms
and
talked
.
They
talk
of
art
and
are
*NL*
passionately
,
almost
feverishly
,
in
earnest
about
it
.
*NL*
They
think
it
matters
much
more
than
it
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
these
people
gathered
and
smoked
cigarettes
and
*NL*
talked
and
Enoch
Robinson
,
the
boy
from
the
farm
near
*NL*
Winesburg
,
was
there
.
He
stayed
in
a
corner
and
for
the
*NL*
most
part
said
nothing
.
How
his
big
blue
childlike
eyes
*NL*
stared
about
!
On
the
walls
were
pictures
he
had
made
,
*NL*
crude
things
,
half
finished
.
His
friends
talked
of
*NL*
these
.
Leaning
back
in
their
chairs
,
they
talked
and
*NL*
talked
with
their
heads
rocking
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
Words
were
said
about
line
and
values
and
composition
,
*NL*
lots
of
words
,
such
as
are
always
being
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enoch
wanted
to
talk
too
but
he
did
n't
know
how
.
He
was
*NL*
too
excited
to
talk
coherently
.
When
he
tried
he
*NL*
sputtered
and
stammered
and
his
voice
sounded
strange
*NL*
and
squeaky
to
him
.
That
made
him
stop
talking
.
He
knew
*NL*
what
he
wanted
to
say
,
but
he
knew
also
that
he
could
*NL*
never
by
any
possibility
say
it
.
When
a
picture
he
had
*NL*
painted
was
under
discussion
,
he
wanted
to
burst
out
*NL*
with
something
like
this
:
``
You
do
n't
get
the
point
,
''
he
*NL*
wanted
to
explain
;
``
the
picture
you
see
does
n't
consist
*NL*
of
the
things
you
see
and
say
words
about
.
There
is
*NL*
something
else
,
something
you
do
n't
see
at
all
,
*NL*
something
you
are
n't
intended
to
see
.
Look
at
this
one
*NL*
over
here
,
by
the
door
here
,
where
the
light
from
the
*NL*
window
falls
on
it
.
The
dark
spot
by
the
road
that
you
*NL*
might
not
notice
at
all
is
,
you
see
,
the
beginning
of
*NL*
everything
.
There
is
a
clump
of
elders
there
such
as
*NL*
used
to
grow
beside
the
road
before
our
house
back
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
Ohio
,
and
in
among
the
elders
there
is
*NL*
something
hidden
.
It
is
a
woman
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
She
*NL*
has
been
thrown
from
a
horse
and
the
horse
has
run
away
*NL*
out
of
sight
.
Do
you
not
see
how
the
old
man
who
drives
*NL*
a
cart
looks
anxiously
about
?
That
is
Thad
Grayback
who
*NL*
has
a
farm
up
the
road
.
He
is
taking
corn
to
Winesburg
*NL*
to
be
ground
into
meal
at
Comstock
's
mill
.
He
knows
*NL*
there
is
something
in
the
elders
,
something
hidden
*NL*
away
,
and
yet
he
does
n't
quite
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
woman
you
see
,
that
's
what
it
is
!
It
's
a
woman
*NL*
and
,
oh
,
she
is
lovely
!
She
is
hurt
and
is
suffering
*NL*
but
she
makes
no
sound
.
Do
n't
you
see
how
it
is
?
She
*NL*
lies
quite
still
,
white
and
still
,
and
the
beauty
comes
*NL*
out
from
her
and
spreads
over
everything
.
It
is
in
the
*NL*
sky
back
there
and
all
around
everywhere
.
I
did
n't
try
*NL*
to
paint
the
woman
,
of
course
.
She
is
too
beautiful
to
*NL*
be
painted
.
How
dull
to
talk
of
composition
and
such
*NL*
things
!
Why
do
you
not
look
at
the
sky
and
then
run
*NL*
away
as
I
used
to
do
when
I
was
a
boy
back
there
in
*NL*
Winesburg
,
Ohio
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
the
kind
of
thing
young
Enoch
Robinson
trembled
*NL*
to
say
to
the
guests
who
came
into
his
room
when
he
was
*NL*
a
young
fellow
in
New
York
City
,
but
he
always
ended
by
*NL*
saying
nothing
.
Then
he
began
to
doubt
his
own
mind
.
He
*NL*
was
afraid
the
things
he
felt
were
not
getting
*NL*
expressed
in
the
pictures
he
painted
.
In
a
half
*NL*
indignant
mood
he
stopped
inviting
people
into
his
room
*NL*
and
presently
got
into
the
habit
of
locking
the
door
.
*NL*
He
began
to
think
that
enough
people
had
visited
him
,
*NL*
that
he
did
not
need
people
any
more
.
With
quick
*NL*
imagination
he
began
to
invent
his
own
people
to
whom
*NL*
he
could
really
talk
and
to
whom
he
explained
the
*NL*
things
he
had
been
unable
to
explain
to
living
people
.
*NL*
His
room
began
to
be
inhabited
by
the
spirits
of
men
*NL*
and
women
among
whom
he
went
,
in
his
turn
saying
words
.
*NL*
It
was
as
though
everyone
Enoch
Robinson
had
ever
seen
*NL*
had
left
with
him
some
essence
of
himself
,
something
he
*NL*
could
mould
and
change
to
suit
his
own
fancy
,
something
*NL*
that
understood
all
about
such
things
as
the
wounded
*NL*
woman
behind
the
elders
in
the
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mild
,
blue-eyed
young
Ohio
boy
was
a
complete
*NL*
egotist
,
as
all
children
are
egotists
.
He
did
not
want
*NL*
friends
for
the
quite
simple
reason
that
no
child
wants
*NL*
friends
.
He
wanted
most
of
all
the
people
of
his
own
*NL*
mind
,
people
with
whom
he
could
really
talk
,
people
he
*NL*
could
harangue
and
scold
by
the
hour
,
servants
,
you
*NL*
see
,
to
his
fancy
.
Among
these
people
he
was
always
*NL*
self-confident
and
bold
.
They
might
talk
,
to
be
sure
,
*NL*
and
even
have
opinions
of
their
own
,
but
always
he
*NL*
talked
last
and
best
.
He
was
like
a
writer
busy
among
*NL*
the
figures
of
his
brain
,
a
kind
of
tiny
blue-eyed
king
*NL*
he
was
,
in
a
six-dollar
room
facing
Washington
Square
in
*NL*
the
city
of
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Enoch
Robinson
got
married
.
He
began
to
get
*NL*
lonely
and
to
want
to
touch
actual
flesh-and-bone
*NL*
people
with
his
hands
.
Days
passed
when
his
room
seemed
*NL*
empty
.
Lust
visited
his
body
and
desire
grew
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
At
night
strange
fevers
,
burning
within
,
kept
him
*NL*
awake
.
He
married
a
girl
who
sat
in
a
chair
next
to
his
*NL*
own
in
the
art
school
and
went
to
live
in
an
apartment
*NL*
house
in
Brooklyn
.
Two
children
were
born
to
the
woman
*NL*
he
married
,
and
Enoch
got
a
job
in
a
place
where
*NL*
illustrations
are
made
for
advertisements
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
began
another
phase
of
Enoch
's
life
.
He
began
to
*NL*
play
at
a
new
game
.
For
a
while
he
was
very
proud
of
*NL*
himself
in
the
role
of
producing
citizen
of
the
world
.
*NL*
He
dismissed
the
essence
of
things
and
played
with
*NL*
realities
.
In
the
fall
he
voted
at
an
election
and
he
*NL*
had
a
newspaper
thrown
on
his
porch
each
morning
.
When
*NL*
in
the
evening
he
came
home
from
work
he
got
off
a
*NL*
streetcar
and
walked
sedately
along
behind
some
*NL*
business
man
,
striving
to
look
very
substantial
and
*NL*
important
.
As
a
payer
of
taxes
he
thought
he
should
*NL*
post
himself
on
how
things
are
run
.
``
I
'm
getting
to
be
*NL*
of
some
moment
,
a
real
part
of
things
,
of
the
state
and
*NL*
the
city
and
all
that
,
''
he
told
himself
with
an
amusing
*NL*
miniature
air
of
dignity
.
Once
,
coming
home
from
*NL*
Philadelphia
,
he
had
a
discussion
with
a
man
met
on
a
*NL*
train
.
Enoch
talked
about
the
advisability
of
the
*NL*
government
's
owning
and
operating
the
railroads
and
the
*NL*
man
gave
him
a
cigar
.
It
was
Enoch
's
notion
that
such
a
*NL*
move
on
the
part
of
the
government
would
be
a
good
*NL*
thing
,
and
he
grew
quite
excited
as
he
talked
.
Later
he
*NL*
remembered
his
own
words
with
pleasure
.
``
I
gave
him
*NL*
something
to
think
about
,
that
fellow
,
''
he
muttered
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
Brooklyn
*NL*
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
Enoch
's
marriage
did
not
turn
out
.
He
*NL*
himself
brought
it
to
an
end
.
He
began
to
feel
choked
*NL*
and
walled
in
by
the
life
in
the
apartment
,
and
to
feel
*NL*
toward
his
wife
and
even
toward
his
children
as
he
had
*NL*
felt
concerning
the
friends
who
once
came
to
visit
him
.
*NL*
He
began
to
tell
little
lies
about
business
engagements
*NL*
that
would
give
him
freedom
to
walk
alone
in
the
street
*NL*
at
night
and
,
the
chance
offering
,
he
secretly
*NL*
re-rented
the
room
facing
Washington
Square
.
Then
Mrs.
*NL*
Al
Robinson
died
on
the
farm
near
Winesburg
,
and
he
got
*NL*
eight
thousand
dollars
from
the
bank
that
acted
as
*NL*
trustee
of
her
estate
.
That
took
Enoch
out
of
the
world
*NL*
of
men
altogether
.
He
gave
the
money
to
his
wife
and
*NL*
told
her
he
could
not
live
in
the
apartment
any
more
.
*NL*
She
cried
and
was
angry
and
threatened
,
but
he
only
*NL*
stared
at
her
and
went
his
own
way
.
In
reality
the
wife
*NL*
did
not
care
much
.
She
thought
Enoch
slightly
insane
*NL*
and
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
.
When
it
was
quite
sure
*NL*
that
he
would
never
come
back
,
she
took
the
two
*NL*
children
and
went
to
a
village
in
Connecticut
where
she
*NL*
had
lived
as
a
girl
.
In
the
end
she
married
a
man
who
*NL*
bought
and
sold
real
estate
and
was
contented
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Enoch
Robinson
stayed
in
the
New
York
room
among
*NL*
the
people
of
his
fancy
,
playing
with
them
,
talking
to
*NL*
them
,
happy
as
a
child
is
happy
.
They
were
an
odd
lot
,
*NL*
Enoch
's
people
.
They
were
made
,
I
suppose
,
out
of
real
*NL*
people
he
had
seen
and
who
had
for
some
obscure
reason
*NL*
made
an
appeal
to
him
.
There
was
a
woman
with
a
sword
*NL*
in
her
hand
,
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
who
*NL*
went
about
followed
by
a
dog
,
a
young
girl
whose
*NL*
stockings
were
always
coming
down
and
hanging
over
her
*NL*
shoe
tops
.
There
must
have
been
two
dozen
of
the
shadow
*NL*
people
,
invented
by
the
child-mind
of
Enoch
Robinson
,
*NL*
who
lived
in
the
room
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Enoch
was
happy
.
Into
the
room
he
went
and
locked
*NL*
the
door
.
With
an
absurd
air
of
importance
he
talked
*NL*
aloud
,
giving
instructions
,
making
comments
on
life
.
He
*NL*
was
happy
and
satisfied
to
go
on
making
his
living
in
*NL*
the
advertising
place
until
something
happened
.
Of
*NL*
course
something
did
happen
.
That
is
why
he
went
back
*NL*
to
live
in
Winesburg
and
why
we
know
about
him
.
The
*NL*
thing
that
happened
was
a
woman
.
It
would
be
that
way
.
*NL*
He
was
too
happy
.
Something
had
to
come
into
his
world
.
*NL*
Something
had
to
drive
him
out
of
the
New
York
room
to
*NL*
live
out
his
life
an
obscure
,
jerky
little
figure
,
*NL*
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
streets
of
an
Ohio
town
at
*NL*
evening
when
the
sun
was
going
down
behind
the
roof
of
*NL*
Wesley
Moyer
's
livery
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
thing
that
happened
.
Enoch
told
George
*NL*
Willard
about
it
one
night
.
He
wanted
to
talk
to
*NL*
someone
,
and
he
chose
the
young
newspaper
reporter
*NL*
because
the
two
happened
to
be
thrown
together
at
a
*NL*
time
when
the
younger
man
was
in
a
mood
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Youthful
sadness
,
young
man
's
sadness
,
the
sadness
of
a
*NL*
growing
boy
in
a
village
at
the
year
's
end
,
opened
the
*NL*
lips
of
the
old
man
.
The
sadness
was
in
the
heart
of
*NL*
George
Willard
and
was
without
meaning
,
but
it
appealed
*NL*
to
Enoch
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rained
on
the
evening
when
the
two
met
and
talked
,
a
*NL*
drizzly
wet
October
rain
.
The
fruition
of
the
year
had
*NL*
come
and
the
night
should
have
been
fine
with
a
moon
in
*NL*
the
sky
and
the
crisp
sharp
promise
of
frost
in
the
*NL*
air
,
but
it
was
n't
that
way
.
It
rained
and
little
*NL*
puddles
of
water
shone
under
the
street
lamps
on
Main
*NL*
Street
.
In
the
woods
in
the
darkness
beyond
the
Fair
*NL*
Ground
water
dripped
from
the
black
trees
.
Beneath
the
*NL*
trees
wet
leaves
were
pasted
against
tree
roots
that
*NL*
protruded
from
the
ground
.
In
gardens
back
of
houses
in
*NL*
Winesburg
dry
shriveled
potato
vines
lay
sprawling
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
Men
who
had
finished
the
evening
meal
and
*NL*
who
had
planned
to
go
uptown
to
talk
the
evening
away
*NL*
with
other
men
at
the
back
of
some
store
changed
their
*NL*
minds
.
George
Willard
tramped
about
in
the
rain
and
was
*NL*
glad
that
it
rained
.
He
felt
that
way
.
He
was
like
*NL*
Enoch
Robinson
on
the
evenings
when
the
old
man
came
*NL*
down
out
of
his
room
and
wandered
alone
in
the
streets
.
*NL*
He
was
like
that
only
that
George
Willard
had
become
a
*NL*
tall
young
man
and
did
not
think
it
manly
to
weep
and
*NL*
carry
on
.
For
a
month
his
mother
had
been
very
ill
and
*NL*
that
had
something
to
do
with
his
sadness
,
but
not
*NL*
much
.
He
thought
about
himself
and
to
the
young
that
*NL*
always
brings
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enoch
Robinson
and
George
Willard
met
beneath
a
wooden
*NL*
awning
that
extended
out
over
the
sidewalk
before
*NL*
Voight
's
wagon
shop
on
Maumee
Street
just
off
the
main
*NL*
street
of
Winesburg
.
They
went
together
from
there
*NL*
through
the
rain-washed
streets
to
the
older
man
's
room
*NL*
on
the
third
floor
of
the
Heffner
Block
.
The
young
*NL*
reporter
went
willingly
enough
.
Enoch
Robinson
asked
*NL*
him
to
go
after
the
two
had
talked
for
ten
minutes
.
The
*NL*
boy
was
a
little
afraid
but
had
never
been
more
curious
*NL*
in
his
life
.
A
hundred
times
he
had
heard
the
old
man
*NL*
spoken
of
as
a
little
off
his
head
and
he
thought
*NL*
himself
rather
brave
and
manly
to
go
at
all
.
From
the
*NL*
very
beginning
,
in
the
street
in
the
rain
,
the
old
man
*NL*
talked
in
a
queer
way
,
trying
to
tell
the
story
of
the
*NL*
room
in
Washington
Square
and
of
his
life
in
the
room
.
*NL*
``
You
'll
understand
if
you
try
hard
enough
,
''
he
said
*NL*
conclusively
.
``
I
have
looked
at
you
when
you
went
past
*NL*
me
on
the
street
and
I
think
you
can
understand
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
hard
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
believe
what
I
*NL*
say
,
just
listen
and
believe
,
that
's
all
there
is
to
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
eleven
o'clock
that
evening
when
old
Enoch
,
*NL*
talking
to
George
Willard
in
the
room
in
the
Heffner
*NL*
Block
,
came
to
the
vital
thing
,
the
story
of
the
woman
*NL*
and
of
what
drove
him
out
of
the
city
to
live
out
his
*NL*
life
alone
and
defeated
in
Winesburg
.
He
sat
on
a
cot
*NL*
by
the
window
with
his
head
in
his
hand
and
George
*NL*
Willard
was
in
a
chair
by
a
table
.
A
kerosene
lamp
sat
*NL*
on
the
table
and
the
room
,
although
almost
bare
of
*NL*
furniture
,
was
scrupulously
clean
.
As
the
man
talked
*NL*
George
Willard
began
to
feel
that
he
would
like
to
get
*NL*
out
of
the
chair
and
sit
on
the
cot
also
.
He
wanted
to
*NL*
put
his
arms
about
the
little
old
man
.
In
the
half
*NL*
darkness
the
man
talked
and
the
boy
listened
,
filled
*NL*
with
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
got
to
coming
in
there
after
there
had
n't
been
*NL*
anyone
in
the
room
for
years
,
''
said
Enoch
Robinson
.
*NL*
``
She
saw
me
in
the
hallway
of
the
house
and
we
got
*NL*
acquainted
.
I
do
n't
know
just
what
she
did
in
her
own
*NL*
room
.
I
never
went
there
.
I
think
she
was
a
musician
*NL*
and
played
a
violin
.
Every
now
and
then
she
came
and
*NL*
knocked
at
the
door
and
I
opened
it
.
In
she
came
and
*NL*
sat
down
beside
me
,
just
sat
and
looked
about
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
Anyway
,
she
said
nothing
that
mattered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
arose
from
the
cot
and
moved
about
the
*NL*
room
.
The
overcoat
he
wore
was
wet
from
the
rain
and
*NL*
drops
of
water
kept
falling
with
a
soft
thump
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
When
he
again
sat
upon
the
cot
George
Willard
*NL*
got
out
of
the
chair
and
sat
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
feeling
about
her
.
She
sat
there
in
the
room
*NL*
with
me
and
she
was
too
big
for
the
room
.
I
felt
that
*NL*
she
was
driving
everything
else
away
.
We
just
talked
of
*NL*
little
things
,
but
I
could
n't
sit
still
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
touch
her
with
my
fingers
and
to
kiss
her
.
Her
hands
*NL*
were
so
strong
and
her
face
was
so
good
and
she
looked
*NL*
at
me
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trembling
voice
of
the
old
man
became
silent
and
*NL*
his
body
shook
as
from
a
chill
.
``
I
was
afraid
,
''
he
*NL*
whispered
.
``
I
was
terribly
afraid
.
I
did
n't
want
to
let
*NL*
her
come
in
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
but
I
could
n't
*NL*
sit
still
.
`
No
,
no
,
'
I
said
to
myself
,
but
I
got
up
and
*NL*
opened
the
door
just
the
same
.
She
was
so
grown
up
,
you
*NL*
see
.
She
was
a
woman
.
I
thought
she
would
be
bigger
*NL*
than
I
was
there
in
that
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enoch
Robinson
stared
at
George
Willard
,
his
childlike
*NL*
blue
eyes
shining
in
the
lamplight
.
Again
he
shivered
.
*NL*
``
I
wanted
her
and
all
the
time
I
did
n't
want
her
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
.
``
Then
I
began
to
tell
her
about
my
people
,
*NL*
about
everything
that
meant
anything
to
me
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
keep
quiet
,
to
keep
myself
to
myself
,
but
I
could
n't
.
I
*NL*
felt
just
as
I
did
about
opening
the
door
.
Sometimes
I
*NL*
ached
to
have
her
go
away
and
never
come
back
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
sprang
to
his
feet
and
his
voice
shook
with
*NL*
excitement
.
``
One
night
something
happened
.
I
became
mad
*NL*
to
make
her
understand
me
and
to
know
what
a
big
thing
*NL*
I
was
in
that
room
.
I
wanted
her
to
see
how
important
I
*NL*
was
.
I
told
her
over
and
over
.
When
she
tried
to
go
*NL*
away
,
I
ran
and
locked
the
door
.
I
followed
her
about
.
*NL*
I
talked
and
talked
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
things
*NL*
went
to
smash
.
A
look
came
into
her
eyes
and
I
knew
she
*NL*
did
understand
.
Maybe
she
had
understood
all
the
time
.
*NL*
I
was
furious
.
I
could
n't
stand
it
.
I
wanted
her
to
*NL*
understand
but
,
do
n't
you
see
,
I
could
n't
let
her
*NL*
understand
.
I
felt
that
then
she
would
know
everything
,
*NL*
that
I
would
be
submerged
,
drowned
out
,
you
see
.
That
's
*NL*
how
it
is
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
lamp
and
the
*NL*
boy
listened
,
filled
with
awe
.
``
Go
away
,
boy
,
''
said
the
*NL*
man
.
``
Do
n't
stay
here
with
me
any
more
.
I
thought
it
*NL*
might
be
a
good
thing
to
tell
you
but
it
is
n't
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
talk
any
more
.
Go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
shook
his
head
and
a
note
of
command
*NL*
came
into
his
voice
.
``
Do
n't
stop
now
.
Tell
me
the
rest
*NL*
of
it
,
''
he
commanded
sharply
.
``
What
happened
?
Tell
me
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enoch
Robinson
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
window
*NL*
that
looked
down
into
the
deserted
main
street
of
*NL*
Winesburg
.
George
Willard
followed
.
By
the
window
the
*NL*
two
stood
,
the
tall
awkward
boy-man
and
the
little
*NL*
wrinkled
man-boy
.
The
childish
,
eager
voice
carried
*NL*
forward
the
tale
.
``
I
swore
at
her
,
''
he
explained
.
``
I
*NL*
said
vile
words
.
I
ordered
her
to
go
away
and
not
to
*NL*
come
back
.
Oh
,
I
said
terrible
things
.
At
first
she
*NL*
pretended
not
to
understand
but
I
kept
at
it
.
I
*NL*
screamed
and
stamped
on
the
floor
.
I
made
the
house
*NL*
ring
with
my
curses
.
I
did
n't
want
ever
to
see
her
*NL*
again
and
I
knew
,
after
some
of
the
things
I
said
,
that
*NL*
I
never
would
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
voice
broke
and
he
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
``
Things
went
to
smash
,
''
he
said
quietly
and
sadly
.
``
Out
*NL*
she
went
through
the
door
and
all
the
life
there
had
*NL*
been
in
the
room
followed
her
out
.
She
took
all
of
my
*NL*
people
away
.
They
all
went
out
through
the
door
after
*NL*
her
.
That
's
the
way
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
turned
and
went
out
of
Enoch
Robinson
's
*NL*
room
.
In
the
darkness
by
the
window
,
as
he
went
through
*NL*
the
door
,
he
could
hear
the
thin
old
voice
whimpering
*NL*
and
complaining
.
``
I
'm
alone
,
all
alone
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
voice
.
``
It
was
warm
and
friendly
in
my
room
but
now
I
'm
*NL*
all
alone

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AN
AWAKENING
*NL*
*NL*
Belle
Carpenter
had
a
dark
skin
,
grey
eyes
,
and
thick
*NL*
lips
.
She
was
tall
and
strong
.
When
black
thoughts
*NL*
visited
her
she
grew
angry
and
wished
she
were
a
man
*NL*
and
could
fight
someone
with
her
fists
.
She
worked
in
*NL*
the
millinery
shop
kept
by
Mrs.
Kate
McHugh
and
during
*NL*
the
day
sat
trimming
hats
by
a
window
at
the
rear
of
*NL*
the
store
.
She
was
the
daughter
of
Henry
Carpenter
,
*NL*
bookkeeper
in
the
First
National
Bank
of
Winesburg
,
and
*NL*
lived
with
him
in
a
gloomy
old
house
far
out
at
the
end
*NL*
of
Buckeye
Street
.
The
house
was
surrounded
by
pine
*NL*
trees
and
there
was
no
grass
beneath
the
trees
.
A
rusty
*NL*
tin
eaves-trough
had
slipped
from
its
fastenings
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
house
and
when
the
wind
blew
it
beat
*NL*
against
the
roof
of
a
small
shed
,
making
a
dismal
*NL*
drumming
noise
that
sometimes
persisted
all
through
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
a
young
girl
Henry
Carpenter
made
life
*NL*
almost
unbearable
for
Belle
,
but
as
she
emerged
from
*NL*
girlhood
into
womanhood
he
lost
his
power
over
her
.
The
*NL*
bookkeeper
's
life
was
made
up
of
innumerable
little
*NL*
pettinesses
.
When
he
went
to
the
bank
in
the
morning
he
*NL*
stepped
into
a
closet
and
put
on
a
black
alpaca
coat
*NL*
that
had
become
shabby
with
age
.
At
night
when
he
*NL*
returned
to
his
home
he
donned
another
black
alpaca
*NL*
coat
.
Every
evening
he
pressed
the
clothes
worn
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
He
had
invented
an
arrangement
of
boards
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
The
trousers
to
his
street
suit
were
*NL*
placed
between
the
boards
and
the
boards
were
clamped
*NL*
together
with
heavy
screws
.
In
the
morning
he
wiped
the
*NL*
boards
with
a
damp
cloth
and
stood
them
upright
behind
*NL*
the
dining
room
door
.
If
they
were
moved
during
the
day
*NL*
he
was
speechless
with
anger
and
did
not
recover
his
*NL*
equilibrium
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bank
cashier
was
a
little
bully
and
was
afraid
of
*NL*
his
daughter
.
She
,
he
realized
,
knew
the
story
of
his
*NL*
brutal
treatment
of
her
mother
and
hated
him
for
it
.
*NL*
One
day
she
went
home
at
noon
and
carried
a
handful
of
*NL*
soft
mud
,
taken
from
the
road
,
into
the
house
.
With
the
*NL*
mud
she
smeared
the
face
of
the
boards
used
for
the
*NL*
pressing
of
trousers
and
then
went
back
to
her
work
*NL*
feeling
relieved
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Belle
Carpenter
occasionally
walked
out
in
the
evening
*NL*
with
George
Willard
.
Secretly
she
loved
another
man
,
*NL*
but
her
love
affair
,
about
which
no
one
knew
,
caused
*NL*
her
much
anxiety
.
She
was
in
love
with
Ed
Handby
,
*NL*
bartender
in
Ed
Griffith
's
Saloon
,
and
went
about
with
*NL*
the
young
reporter
as
a
kind
of
relief
to
her
feelings
.
*NL*
She
did
not
think
that
her
station
in
life
would
permit
*NL*
her
to
be
seen
in
the
company
of
the
bartender
and
*NL*
walked
about
under
the
trees
with
George
Willard
and
*NL*
let
him
kiss
her
to
relieve
a
longing
that
was
very
*NL*
insistent
in
her
nature
.
She
felt
that
she
could
keep
*NL*
the
younger
man
within
bounds
.
About
Ed
Handby
she
was
*NL*
somewhat
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Handby
,
the
bartender
,
was
a
tall
,
broad-shouldered
man
*NL*
of
thirty
who
lived
in
a
room
upstairs
above
Griffith
's
*NL*
saloon
.
His
fists
were
large
and
his
eyes
unusually
*NL*
small
,
but
his
voice
,
as
though
striving
to
conceal
the
*NL*
power
back
of
his
fists
,
was
soft
and
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twenty-five
the
bartender
had
inherited
a
large
farm
*NL*
from
an
uncle
in
Indiana
.
When
sold
,
the
farm
brought
*NL*
in
eight
thousand
dollars
,
which
Ed
spent
in
six
*NL*
months
.
Going
to
Sandusky
,
on
Lake
Erie
,
he
began
an
*NL*
orgy
of
dissipation
,
the
story
of
which
afterward
*NL*
filled
his
home
town
with
awe
.
Here
and
there
he
went
*NL*
throwing
the
money
about
,
driving
carriages
through
the
*NL*
streets
,
giving
wine
parties
to
crowds
of
men
and
*NL*
women
,
playing
cards
for
high
stakes
and
keeping
*NL*
mistresses
whose
wardrobes
cost
him
hundreds
of
*NL*
dollars
.
One
night
at
a
resort
called
Cedar
Point
,
he
*NL*
got
into
a
fight
and
ran
amuck
like
a
wild
thing
.
With
*NL*
his
fist
he
broke
a
large
mirror
in
the
wash
room
of
a
*NL*
hotel
and
later
went
about
smashing
windows
and
*NL*
breaking
chairs
in
dance
halls
for
the
joy
of
hearing
*NL*
the
glass
rattle
on
the
floor
and
seeing
the
terror
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
clerks
who
had
come
from
Sandusky
to
spend
*NL*
the
evening
at
the
resort
with
their
sweethearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
between
Ed
Handby
and
Belle
Carpenter
on
the
*NL*
surface
amounted
to
nothing
.
He
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
spending
but
one
evening
in
her
company
.
On
that
*NL*
evening
he
hired
a
horse
and
buggy
at
Wesley
Moyer
's
*NL*
livery
barn
and
took
her
for
a
drive
.
The
conviction
*NL*
that
she
was
the
woman
his
nature
demanded
and
that
he
*NL*
must
get
her
settled
upon
him
and
he
told
her
of
his
*NL*
desires
.
The
bartender
was
ready
to
marry
and
to
begin
*NL*
trying
to
earn
money
for
the
support
of
his
wife
,
but
*NL*
so
simple
was
his
nature
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
*NL*
explain
his
intentions
.
His
body
ached
with
physical
*NL*
longing
and
with
his
body
he
expressed
himself
.
Taking
*NL*
the
milliner
into
his
arms
and
holding
her
tightly
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
struggles
,
he
kissed
her
until
she
became
*NL*
helpless
.
Then
he
brought
her
back
to
town
and
let
her
*NL*
out
of
the
buggy
.
``
When
I
get
hold
of
you
again
I
'll
*NL*
not
let
you
go
.
You
ca
n't
play
with
me
,
''
he
declared
as
*NL*
he
turned
to
drive
away
.
Then
,
jumping
out
of
the
*NL*
buggy
,
he
gripped
her
shoulders
with
his
strong
hands
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
keep
you
for
good
the
next
time
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
*NL*
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
to
that
.
It
's
you
and
*NL*
me
for
it
and
I
'm
going
to
have
you
before
I
get
*NL*
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
in
January
when
there
was
a
new
moon
George
*NL*
Willard
,
who
was
in
Ed
Handby
's
mind
the
only
obstacle
*NL*
to
his
getting
Belle
Carpenter
,
went
for
a
walk
.
Early
*NL*
that
evening
George
went
into
Ransom
Surbeck
's
pool
*NL*
room
with
Seth
Richmond
and
Art
Wilson
,
son
of
the
town
*NL*
butcher
.
Seth
Richmond
stood
with
his
back
against
the
*NL*
wall
and
remained
silent
,
but
George
Willard
talked
.
*NL*
The
pool
room
was
filled
with
Winesburg
boys
and
they
*NL*
talked
of
women
.
The
young
reporter
got
into
that
vein
.
*NL*
He
said
that
women
should
look
out
for
themselves
,
that
*NL*
the
fellow
who
went
out
with
a
girl
was
not
responsible
*NL*
for
what
happened
.
As
he
talked
he
looked
about
,
eager
*NL*
for
attention
.
He
held
the
floor
for
five
minutes
and
*NL*
then
Art
Wilson
began
to
talk
.
Art
was
learning
the
*NL*
barber
's
trade
in
Cal
Prouse
's
shop
and
already
began
*NL*
to
consider
himself
an
authority
in
such
matters
as
*NL*
baseball
,
horse
racing
,
drinking
,
and
going
about
with
*NL*
women
.
He
began
to
tell
of
a
night
when
he
with
two
men
*NL*
from
Winesburg
went
into
a
house
of
prostitution
at
the
*NL*
county
seat
.
The
butcher
's
son
held
a
cigar
in
the
side
*NL*
of
his
mouth
and
as
he
talked
spat
on
the
floor
.
``
The
*NL*
women
in
the
place
could
n't
embarrass
me
although
they
*NL*
tried
hard
enough
,
''
he
boasted
.
``
One
of
the
girls
in
*NL*
the
house
tried
to
get
fresh
,
but
I
fooled
her
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
she
began
to
talk
I
went
and
sat
in
her
lap
.
*NL*
Everyone
in
the
room
laughed
when
I
kissed
her
.
I
*NL*
taught
her
to
let
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
went
out
of
the
pool
room
and
into
Main
*NL*
Street
.
For
days
the
weather
had
been
bitter
cold
with
*NL*
a
high
wind
blowing
down
on
the
town
from
Lake
Erie
,
*NL*
eighteen
miles
to
the
north
,
but
on
that
night
the
wind
*NL*
had
died
away
and
a
new
moon
made
the
night
unusually
*NL*
lovely
.
Without
thinking
where
he
was
going
or
what
he
*NL*
wanted
to
do
,
George
went
out
of
Main
Street
and
began
*NL*
walking
in
dimly
lighted
streets
filled
with
frame
*NL*
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
doors
under
the
black
sky
filled
with
stars
he
*NL*
forgot
his
companions
of
the
pool
room
.
Because
it
was
*NL*
dark
and
he
was
alone
he
began
to
talk
aloud
.
In
a
*NL*
spirit
of
play
he
reeled
along
the
street
imitating
a
*NL*
drunken
man
and
then
imagined
himself
a
soldier
clad
in
*NL*
shining
boots
that
reached
to
the
knees
and
wearing
a
*NL*
sword
that
jingled
as
he
walked
.
As
a
soldier
he
*NL*
pictured
himself
as
an
inspector
,
passing
before
a
long
*NL*
line
of
men
who
stood
at
attention
.
He
began
to
examine
*NL*
the
accoutrements
of
the
men
.
Before
a
tree
he
stopped
*NL*
and
began
to
scold
.
``
Your
pack
is
not
in
order
,
''
he
*NL*
said
sharply
.
``
How
many
times
will
I
have
to
speak
of
*NL*
this
matter
?
Everything
must
be
in
order
here
.
We
have
*NL*
a
difficult
task
before
us
and
no
difficult
task
can
be
*NL*
done
without
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hypnotized
by
his
own
words
,
the
young
man
stumbled
*NL*
along
the
board
sidewalk
saying
more
words
.
``
There
is
a
*NL*
law
for
armies
and
for
men
too
,
''
he
muttered
,
lost
in
*NL*
reflection
.
``
The
law
begins
with
little
things
and
*NL*
spreads
out
until
it
covers
everything
.
In
every
little
*NL*
thing
there
must
be
order
,
in
the
place
where
men
work
,
*NL*
in
their
clothes
,
in
their
thoughts
.
I
myself
must
be
*NL*
orderly
.
I
must
learn
that
law
.
I
must
get
myself
into
*NL*
touch
with
something
orderly
and
big
that
swings
*NL*
through
the
night
like
a
star
.
In
my
little
way
I
must
*NL*
begin
to
learn
something
,
to
give
and
swing
and
work
*NL*
with
life
,
with
the
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
stopped
by
a
picket
fence
near
a
street
*NL*
lamp
and
his
body
began
to
tremble
.
He
had
never
before
*NL*
thought
such
thoughts
as
had
just
come
into
his
head
*NL*
and
he
wondered
where
they
had
come
from
.
For
the
*NL*
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
voice
outside
of
*NL*
himself
had
been
talking
as
he
walked
.
He
was
amazed
*NL*
and
delighted
with
his
own
mind
and
when
he
walked
on
*NL*
again
spoke
of
the
matter
with
fervor
.
``
To
come
out
of
*NL*
Ransom
Surbeck
's
pool
room
and
think
things
like
that
,
''
*NL*
he
whispered
.
``
It
is
better
to
be
alone
.
If
I
talked
*NL*
like
Art
Wilson
the
boys
would
understand
me
but
they
*NL*
would
n't
understand
what
I
've
been
thinking
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
,
as
in
all
Ohio
towns
of
twenty
years
ago
,
*NL*
there
was
a
section
in
which
lived
day
laborers
.
As
the
*NL*
time
of
factories
had
not
yet
come
,
the
laborers
worked
*NL*
in
the
fields
or
were
section
hands
on
the
railroads
.
*NL*
They
worked
twelve
hours
a
day
and
received
one
dollar
*NL*
for
the
long
day
of
toil
.
The
houses
in
which
they
*NL*
lived
were
small
cheaply
constructed
wooden
affairs
*NL*
with
a
garden
at
the
back
.
The
more
comfortable
among
*NL*
them
kept
cows
and
perhaps
a
pig
,
housed
in
a
little
*NL*
shed
at
the
rear
of
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
head
filled
with
resounding
thoughts
,
George
*NL*
Willard
walked
into
such
a
street
on
the
clear
January
*NL*
night
.
The
street
was
dimly
lighted
and
in
places
there
*NL*
was
no
sidewalk
.
In
the
scene
that
lay
about
him
there
*NL*
was
something
that
excited
his
already
aroused
fancy
.
*NL*
For
a
year
he
had
been
devoting
all
of
his
odd
moments
*NL*
to
the
reading
of
books
and
now
some
tale
he
had
read
*NL*
concerning
life
in
old
world
towns
of
the
middle
ages
*NL*
came
sharply
back
to
his
mind
so
that
he
stumbled
*NL*
forward
with
the
curious
feeling
of
one
revisiting
a
*NL*
place
that
had
been
a
part
of
some
former
existence
.
On
*NL*
an
impulse
he
turned
out
of
the
street
and
went
into
a
*NL*
little
dark
alleyway
behind
the
sheds
in
which
lived
*NL*
the
cows
and
pigs
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
half
hour
he
stayed
in
the
alleyway
,
smelling
the
*NL*
strong
smell
of
animals
too
closely
housed
and
letting
*NL*
his
mind
play
with
the
strange
new
thoughts
that
came
*NL*
to
him
.
The
very
rankness
of
the
smell
of
manure
in
the
*NL*
clear
sweet
air
awoke
something
heady
in
his
brain
.
The
*NL*
poor
little
houses
lighted
by
kerosene
lamps
,
the
smoke
*NL*
from
the
chimneys
mounting
straight
up
into
the
clear
*NL*
air
,
the
grunting
of
pigs
,
the
women
clad
in
cheap
*NL*
calico
dresses
and
washing
dishes
in
the
kitchens
,
the
*NL*
footsteps
of
men
coming
out
of
the
houses
and
going
off
*NL*
to
the
stores
and
saloons
of
Main
Street
,
the
dogs
*NL*
barking
and
the
children
crying
--
all
of
these
things
*NL*
made
him
seem
,
as
he
lurked
in
the
darkness
,
oddly
*NL*
detached
and
apart
from
all
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
young
man
,
unable
to
bear
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
own
thoughts
,
began
to
move
cautiously
along
the
*NL*
alleyway
.
A
dog
attacked
him
and
had
to
be
driven
away
*NL*
with
stones
,
and
a
man
appeared
at
the
door
of
one
of
*NL*
the
houses
and
swore
at
the
dog
.
George
went
into
a
*NL*
vacant
lot
and
throwing
back
his
head
looked
up
at
the
*NL*
sky
.
He
felt
unutterably
big
and
remade
by
the
simple
*NL*
experience
through
which
he
had
been
passing
and
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
fervor
of
emotion
put
up
his
hands
,
thrusting
*NL*
them
into
the
darkness
above
his
head
and
muttering
*NL*
words
.
The
desire
to
say
words
overcame
him
and
he
said
*NL*
words
without
meaning
,
rolling
them
over
on
his
tongue
*NL*
and
saying
them
because
they
were
brave
words
,
full
of
*NL*
meaning
.
``
Death
,
''
he
muttered
,
``
night
,
the
sea
,
fear
,
*NL*
loveliness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
came
out
of
the
vacant
lot
and
stood
*NL*
again
on
the
sidewalk
facing
the
houses
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
all
of
the
people
in
the
little
street
must
be
brothers
*NL*
and
sisters
to
him
and
he
wished
he
had
the
courage
to
*NL*
call
them
out
of
their
houses
and
to
shake
their
hands
.
*NL*
``
If
there
were
only
a
woman
here
I
would
take
hold
of
*NL*
her
hand
and
we
would
run
until
we
were
both
tired
*NL*
out
,
''
he
thought
.
``
That
would
make
me
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
With
the
thought
of
a
woman
in
his
mind
he
walked
out
*NL*
of
the
street
and
went
toward
the
house
where
Belle
*NL*
Carpenter
lived
.
He
thought
she
would
understand
his
*NL*
mood
and
that
he
could
achieve
in
her
presence
a
*NL*
position
he
had
long
been
wanting
to
achieve
.
In
the
*NL*
past
when
he
had
been
with
her
and
had
kissed
her
lips
*NL*
he
had
come
away
filled
with
anger
at
himself
.
He
had
*NL*
felt
like
one
being
used
for
some
obscure
purpose
and
*NL*
had
not
enjoyed
the
feeling
.
Now
he
thought
he
had
*NL*
suddenly
become
too
big
to
be
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
George
got
to
Belle
Carpenter
's
house
there
had
*NL*
already
been
a
visitor
there
before
him
.
Ed
Handby
had
*NL*
come
to
the
door
and
calling
Belle
out
of
the
house
had
*NL*
tried
to
talk
to
her
.
He
had
wanted
to
ask
the
woman
to
*NL*
come
away
with
him
and
to
be
his
wife
,
but
when
she
*NL*
came
and
stood
by
the
door
he
lost
his
self-assurance
*NL*
and
became
sullen
.
``
You
stay
away
from
that
kid
,
''
he
*NL*
growled
,
thinking
of
George
Willard
,
and
then
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
else
to
say
,
turned
to
go
away
.
``
If
I
*NL*
catch
you
together
I
will
break
your
bones
and
his
*NL*
too
,
''
he
added
.
The
bartender
had
come
to
woo
,
not
to
*NL*
threaten
,
and
was
angry
with
himself
because
of
his
*NL*
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
lover
had
departed
Belle
went
indoors
and
ran
*NL*
hurriedly
upstairs
.
From
a
window
at
the
upper
part
of
*NL*
the
house
she
saw
Ed
Handby
cross
the
street
and
sit
*NL*
down
on
a
horse
block
before
the
house
of
a
neighbor
.
*NL*
In
the
dim
light
the
man
sat
motionless
holding
his
*NL*
head
in
his
hands
.
She
was
made
happy
by
the
sight
,
and
*NL*
when
George
Willard
came
to
the
door
she
greeted
him
*NL*
effusively
and
hurriedly
put
on
her
hat
.
She
thought
*NL*
that
,
as
she
walked
through
the
streets
with
young
*NL*
Willard
,
Ed
Handby
would
follow
and
she
wanted
to
make
*NL*
him
suffer
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
hour
Belle
Carpenter
and
the
young
reporter
*NL*
walked
about
under
the
trees
in
the
sweet
night
air
.
*NL*
George
Willard
was
full
of
big
words
.
The
sense
of
*NL*
power
that
had
come
to
him
during
the
hour
in
the
*NL*
darkness
in
the
alleyway
remained
with
him
and
he
*NL*
talked
boldly
,
swaggering
along
and
swinging
his
arms
*NL*
about
.
He
wanted
to
make
Belle
Carpenter
realize
that
*NL*
he
was
aware
of
his
former
weakness
and
that
he
had
*NL*
changed
.
``
You
'll
find
me
different
,
''
he
declared
,
*NL*
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looking
boldly
*NL*
into
her
eyes
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
but
it
is
so
.
You
've
*NL*
got
to
take
me
for
a
man
or
let
me
alone
.
That
's
how
it
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
and
down
the
quiet
streets
under
the
new
moon
went
*NL*
the
woman
and
the
boy
.
When
George
had
finished
talking
*NL*
they
turned
down
a
side
street
and
went
across
a
bridge
*NL*
into
a
path
that
ran
up
the
side
of
a
hill
.
The
hill
*NL*
began
at
Waterworks
Pond
and
climbed
upward
to
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Fair
Grounds
.
On
the
hillside
grew
dense
*NL*
bushes
and
small
trees
and
among
the
bushes
were
little
*NL*
open
spaces
carpeted
with
long
grass
,
now
stiff
and
*NL*
frozen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
behind
the
woman
up
the
hill
George
*NL*
Willard
's
heart
began
to
beat
rapidly
and
his
shoulders
*NL*
straightened
.
Suddenly
he
decided
that
Belle
Carpenter
*NL*
was
about
to
surrender
herself
to
him
.
The
new
force
*NL*
that
had
manifested
itself
in
him
had
,
he
felt
,
been
at
*NL*
work
upon
her
and
had
led
to
her
conquest
.
The
thought
*NL*
made
him
half
drunk
with
the
sense
of
masculine
power
.
*NL*
Although
he
had
been
annoyed
that
as
they
walked
about
*NL*
she
had
not
seemed
to
be
listening
to
his
words
,
the
*NL*
fact
that
she
had
accompanied
him
to
this
place
took
*NL*
all
his
doubts
away
.
``
It
is
different
.
Everything
has
*NL*
become
different
,
''
he
thought
and
taking
hold
of
her
*NL*
shoulder
turned
her
about
and
stood
looking
at
her
,
his
*NL*
eyes
shining
with
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Belle
Carpenter
did
not
resist
.
When
he
kissed
her
*NL*
upon
the
lips
she
leaned
heavily
against
him
and
looked
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
into
the
darkness
.
In
her
whole
*NL*
attitude
there
was
a
suggestion
of
waiting
.
Again
,
as
*NL*
in
the
alleyway
,
George
Willard
's
mind
ran
off
into
*NL*
words
and
,
holding
the
woman
tightly
he
whispered
the
*NL*
words
into
the
still
night
.
``
Lust
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
lust
*NL*
and
night
and
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
did
not
understand
what
happened
to
him
*NL*
that
night
on
the
hillside
.
Later
,
when
he
got
to
his
*NL*
own
room
,
he
wanted
to
weep
and
then
grew
half
insane
*NL*
with
anger
and
hate
.
He
hated
Belle
Carpenter
and
was
*NL*
sure
that
all
his
life
he
would
continue
to
hate
her
.
*NL*
On
the
hillside
he
had
led
the
woman
to
one
of
the
*NL*
little
open
spaces
among
the
bushes
and
had
dropped
to
*NL*
his
knees
beside
her
.
As
in
the
vacant
lot
,
by
the
*NL*
laborers
'
houses
,
he
had
put
up
his
hands
in
gratitude
*NL*
for
the
new
power
in
himself
and
was
waiting
for
the
*NL*
woman
to
speak
when
Ed
Handby
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bartender
did
not
want
to
beat
the
boy
,
who
he
*NL*
thought
had
tried
to
take
his
woman
away
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
beating
was
unnecessary
,
that
he
had
power
within
*NL*
himself
to
accomplish
his
purpose
without
using
his
*NL*
fists
.
Gripping
George
by
the
shoulder
and
pulling
him
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
he
held
him
with
one
hand
while
he
looked
*NL*
at
Belle
Carpenter
seated
on
the
grass
.
Then
with
a
*NL*
quick
wide
movement
of
his
arm
he
sent
the
younger
man
*NL*
sprawling
away
into
the
bushes
and
began
to
bully
the
*NL*
woman
,
who
had
risen
to
her
feet
.
``
You
're
no
good
,
''
he
*NL*
said
roughly
.
``
I
've
half
a
mind
not
to
bother
with
you
.
*NL*
I
'd
let
you
alone
if
I
did
n't
want
you
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
bushes
George
Willard
*NL*
stared
at
the
scene
before
him
and
tried
hard
to
think
.
*NL*
He
prepared
to
spring
at
the
man
who
had
humiliated
*NL*
him
.
To
be
beaten
seemed
to
be
infinitely
better
than
*NL*
to
be
thus
hurled
ignominiously
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
times
the
young
reporter
sprang
at
Ed
Handby
and
*NL*
each
time
the
bartender
,
catching
him
by
the
shoulder
,
*NL*
hurled
him
back
into
the
bushes
.
The
older
man
seemed
*NL*
prepared
to
keep
the
exercise
going
indefinitely
but
*NL*
George
Willard
's
head
struck
the
root
of
a
tree
and
he
*NL*
lay
still
.
Then
Ed
Handby
took
Belle
Carpenter
by
the
*NL*
arm
and
marched
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
heard
the
man
and
woman
making
their
way
through
*NL*
the
bushes
.
As
he
crept
down
the
hillside
his
heart
was
*NL*
sick
within
him
.
He
hated
himself
and
he
hated
the
fate
*NL*
that
had
brought
about
his
humiliation
.
When
his
mind
*NL*
went
back
to
the
hour
alone
in
the
alleyway
he
was
*NL*
puzzled
and
stopping
in
the
darkness
listened
,
hoping
*NL*
to
hear
again
the
voice
outside
himself
that
had
so
*NL*
short
a
time
before
put
new
courage
into
his
heart
.
*NL*
When
his
way
homeward
led
him
again
into
the
street
of
*NL*
frame
houses
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
and
began
to
*NL*
run
,
wanting
to
get
quickly
out
of
the
neighborhood
*NL*
that
now
seemed
to
him
utterly
squalid
and
commonplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
QUEER
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
seat
on
a
box
in
the
rough
board
shed
that
*NL*
stuck
like
a
burr
on
the
rear
of
Cowley
&
Son
's
store
*NL*
in
Winesburg
,
Elmer
Cowley
,
the
junior
member
of
the
*NL*
firm
,
could
see
through
a
dirty
window
into
the
*NL*
printshop
of
the
Winesburg
Eagle
.
Elmer
was
putting
new
*NL*
shoelaces
in
his
shoes
.
They
did
not
go
in
readily
and
*NL*
he
had
to
take
the
shoes
off
.
With
the
shoes
in
his
*NL*
hand
he
sat
looking
at
a
large
hole
in
the
heel
of
one
*NL*
of
his
stockings
.
Then
looking
quickly
up
he
saw
George
*NL*
Willard
,
the
only
newspaper
reporter
in
Winesburg
,
*NL*
standing
at
the
back
door
of
the
Eagle
printshop
and
*NL*
staring
absentmindedly
about
.
``
Well
,
well
,
what
next
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
young
man
with
the
shoes
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
jumping
to
his
feet
and
creeping
away
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
crept
into
Elmer
Cowley
's
face
and
his
hands
*NL*
began
to
tremble
.
In
Cowley
&
Son
's
store
a
Jewish
*NL*
traveling
salesman
stood
by
the
counter
talking
to
his
*NL*
father
.
He
imagined
the
reporter
could
hear
what
was
*NL*
being
said
and
the
thought
made
him
furious
.
With
one
*NL*
of
the
shoes
still
held
in
his
hand
he
stood
in
a
*NL*
corner
of
the
shed
and
stamped
with
a
stockinged
foot
*NL*
upon
the
board
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cowley
&
Son
's
store
did
not
face
the
main
street
of
*NL*
Winesburg
.
The
front
was
on
Maumee
Street
and
beyond
it
*NL*
was
Voight
's
wagon
shop
and
a
shed
for
the
sheltering
*NL*
of
farmers
'
horses
.
Beside
the
store
an
alleyway
ran
*NL*
behind
the
main
street
stores
and
all
day
drays
and
*NL*
delivery
wagons
,
intent
on
bringing
in
and
taking
out
*NL*
goods
,
passed
up
and
down
.
The
store
itself
was
*NL*
indescribable
.
Will
Henderson
once
said
of
it
that
it
*NL*
sold
everything
and
nothing
.
In
the
window
facing
*NL*
Maumee
Street
stood
a
chunk
of
coal
as
large
as
an
*NL*
apple
barrel
,
to
indicate
that
orders
for
coal
were
*NL*
taken
,
and
beside
the
black
mass
of
the
coal
stood
*NL*
three
combs
of
honey
grown
brown
and
dirty
in
their
*NL*
wooden
frames
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
honey
had
stood
in
the
store
window
for
six
months
.
*NL*
It
was
for
sale
as
were
also
the
coat
hangers
,
patent
*NL*
suspender
buttons
,
cans
of
roof
paint
,
bottles
of
*NL*
rheumatism
cure
,
and
a
substitute
for
coffee
that
*NL*
companioned
the
honey
in
its
patient
willingness
to
*NL*
serve
the
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ebenezer
Cowley
,
the
man
who
stood
in
the
store
*NL*
listening
to
the
eager
patter
of
words
that
fell
from
*NL*
the
lips
of
the
traveling
man
,
was
tall
and
lean
and
*NL*
looked
unwashed
.
On
his
scrawny
neck
was
a
large
wen
*NL*
partially
covered
by
a
grey
beard
.
He
wore
a
long
*NL*
Prince
Albert
coat
.
The
coat
had
been
purchased
to
*NL*
serve
as
a
wedding
garment
.
Before
he
became
a
merchant
*NL*
Ebenezer
was
a
farmer
and
after
his
marriage
he
wore
*NL*
the
Prince
Albert
coat
to
church
on
Sundays
and
on
*NL*
Saturday
afternoons
when
he
came
into
town
to
trade
.
*NL*
When
he
sold
the
farm
to
become
a
merchant
he
wore
the
*NL*
coat
constantly
.
It
had
become
brown
with
age
and
was
*NL*
covered
with
grease
spots
,
but
in
it
Ebenezer
always
*NL*
felt
dressed
up
and
ready
for
the
day
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
merchant
Ebenezer
was
not
happily
placed
in
life
*NL*
and
he
had
not
been
happily
placed
as
a
farmer
.
Still
*NL*
he
existed
.
His
family
,
consisting
of
a
daughter
named
*NL*
Mabel
and
the
son
,
lived
with
him
in
rooms
above
the
*NL*
store
and
it
did
not
cost
them
much
to
live
.
His
*NL*
troubles
were
not
financial
.
His
unhappiness
as
a
*NL*
merchant
lay
in
the
fact
that
when
a
traveling
man
with
*NL*
wares
to
be
sold
came
in
at
the
front
door
he
was
*NL*
afraid
.
Behind
the
counter
he
stood
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
He
was
afraid
,
first
that
he
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
*NL*
buy
and
thus
lose
the
opportunity
to
sell
again
;
second
*NL*
that
he
would
not
be
stubborn
enough
and
would
in
a
*NL*
moment
of
weakness
buy
what
could
not
be
sold
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
store
on
the
morning
when
Elmer
Cowley
saw
*NL*
George
Willard
standing
and
apparently
listening
at
the
*NL*
back
door
of
the
Eagle
printshop
,
a
situation
had
*NL*
arisen
that
always
stirred
the
son
's
wrath
.
The
*NL*
traveling
man
talked
and
Ebenezer
listened
,
his
whole
*NL*
figure
expressing
uncertainty
.
``
You
see
how
quickly
it
*NL*
is
done
,
''
said
the
traveling
man
,
who
had
for
sale
a
*NL*
small
flat
metal
substitute
for
collar
buttons
.
With
*NL*
one
hand
he
quickly
unfastened
a
collar
from
his
shirt
*NL*
and
then
fastened
it
on
again
.
He
assumed
a
flattering
*NL*
wheedling
tone
.
``
I
tell
you
what
,
men
have
come
to
the
*NL*
end
of
all
this
fooling
with
collar
buttons
and
you
are
*NL*
the
man
to
make
money
out
of
the
change
that
is
coming
.
*NL*
I
am
offering
you
the
exclusive
agency
for
this
town
.
*NL*
Take
twenty
dozen
of
these
fasteners
and
I
'll
not
visit
*NL*
any
other
store
.
I
'll
leave
the
field
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveling
man
leaned
over
the
counter
and
tapped
*NL*
with
his
finger
on
Ebenezer
's
breast
.
``
It
's
an
*NL*
opportunity
and
I
want
you
to
take
it
,
''
he
urged
.
``
A
*NL*
friend
of
mine
told
me
about
you
.
`
See
that
man
*NL*
Cowley
,
'
he
said
.
`
He
's
a
live
one
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveling
man
paused
and
waited
.
Taking
a
book
*NL*
from
his
pocket
he
began
writing
out
the
order
.
Still
*NL*
holding
the
shoe
in
his
hand
Elmer
Cowley
went
through
*NL*
the
store
,
past
the
two
absorbed
men
,
to
a
glass
*NL*
showcase
near
the
front
door
.
He
took
a
cheap
revolver
*NL*
from
the
case
and
began
to
wave
it
about
.
``
You
get
out
*NL*
of
here
!
''
he
shrieked
.
``
We
do
n't
want
any
collar
*NL*
fasteners
here
.
''
An
idea
came
to
him
.
``
Mind
,
I
'm
not
*NL*
making
any
threat
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
do
n't
say
I
'll
shoot
.
*NL*
Maybe
I
just
took
this
gun
out
of
the
case
to
look
at
*NL*
it
.
But
you
better
get
out
.
Yes
sir
,
I
'll
say
that
.
You
*NL*
better
grab
up
your
things
and
get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
storekeeper
's
voice
rose
to
a
scream
and
*NL*
going
behind
the
counter
he
began
to
advance
upon
the
*NL*
two
men
.
``
We
're
through
being
fools
here
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
``
We
ai
n't
going
to
buy
any
more
stuff
until
we
begin
to
*NL*
sell
.
We
ai
n't
going
to
keep
on
being
queer
and
have
*NL*
folks
staring
and
listening
.
You
get
out
of
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveling
man
left
.
Raking
the
samples
of
collar
*NL*
fasteners
off
the
counter
into
a
black
leather
bag
,
he
*NL*
ran
.
He
was
a
small
man
and
very
bow-legged
and
he
ran
*NL*
awkwardly
.
The
black
bag
caught
against
the
door
and
he
*NL*
stumbled
and
fell
.
``
Crazy
,
that
's
what
he
is
--
crazy
!
''
*NL*
he
sputtered
as
he
arose
from
the
sidewalk
and
hurried
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
store
Elmer
Cowley
and
his
father
stared
at
each
*NL*
other
.
Now
that
the
immediate
object
of
his
wrath
had
*NL*
fled
,
the
younger
man
was
embarrassed
.
``
Well
,
I
meant
*NL*
it
.
I
think
we
've
been
queer
long
enough
,
''
he
declared
,
*NL*
going
to
the
showcase
and
replacing
the
revolver
.
*NL*
Sitting
on
a
barrel
he
pulled
on
and
fastened
the
shoe
*NL*
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
.
He
was
waiting
for
*NL*
some
word
of
understanding
from
his
father
but
when
*NL*
Ebenezer
spoke
his
words
only
served
to
reawaken
the
*NL*
wrath
in
the
son
and
the
young
man
ran
out
of
the
store
*NL*
without
replying
.
Scratching
his
grey
beard
with
his
*NL*
long
dirty
fingers
,
the
merchant
looked
at
his
son
with
*NL*
the
same
wavering
uncertain
stare
with
which
he
had
*NL*
confronted
the
traveling
man
.
``
I
'll
be
starched
,
''
he
*NL*
said
softly
.
``
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
be
washed
and
ironed
and
*NL*
starched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
Cowley
went
out
of
Winesburg
and
along
a
country
*NL*
road
that
paralleled
the
railroad
track
.
He
did
not
*NL*
know
where
he
was
going
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
.
In
*NL*
the
shelter
of
a
deep
cut
where
the
road
,
after
turning
*NL*
sharply
to
the
right
,
dipped
under
the
tracks
he
*NL*
stopped
and
the
passion
that
had
been
the
cause
of
his
*NL*
outburst
in
the
store
began
to
again
find
expression
.
*NL*
``
I
will
not
be
queer
--
one
to
be
looked
at
and
listened
*NL*
to
,
''
he
declared
aloud
.
``
I
'll
be
like
other
people
.
*NL*
I
'll
show
that
George
Willard
.
He
'll
find
out
.
I
'll
*NL*
show
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
distraught
young
man
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
road
and
glared
back
at
the
town
.
He
did
not
know
the
*NL*
reporter
George
Willard
and
had
no
special
feeling
*NL*
concerning
the
tall
boy
who
ran
about
town
gathering
*NL*
the
town
news
.
The
reporter
had
merely
come
,
by
his
*NL*
presence
in
the
office
and
in
the
printshop
of
the
*NL*
Winesburg
Eagle
,
to
stand
for
something
in
the
young
*NL*
merchant
's
mind
.
He
thought
the
boy
who
passed
and
*NL*
repassed
Cowley
&
Son
's
store
and
who
stopped
to
talk
*NL*
to
people
in
the
street
must
be
thinking
of
him
and
*NL*
perhaps
laughing
at
him
.
George
Willard
,
he
felt
,
*NL*
belonged
to
the
town
,
typified
the
town
,
represented
in
*NL*
his
person
the
spirit
of
the
town
.
Elmer
Cowley
could
*NL*
not
have
believed
that
George
Willard
had
also
his
days
*NL*
of
unhappiness
,
that
vague
hungers
and
secret
unnamable
*NL*
desires
visited
also
his
mind
.
Did
he
not
represent
*NL*
public
opinion
and
had
not
the
public
opinion
of
*NL*
Winesburg
condemned
the
Cowleys
to
queerness
?
Did
he
*NL*
not
walk
whistling
and
laughing
through
Main
Street
?
*NL*
Might
not
one
by
striking
his
person
strike
also
the
*NL*
greater
enemy
--
the
thing
that
smiled
and
went
its
own
*NL*
way
--
the
judgment
of
Winesburg
?
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
Cowley
was
extraordinarily
tall
and
his
arms
were
*NL*
long
and
powerful
.
His
hair
,
his
eyebrows
,
and
the
*NL*
downy
beard
that
had
begun
to
grow
upon
his
chin
,
were
*NL*
pale
almost
to
whiteness
.
His
teeth
protruded
from
*NL*
between
his
lips
and
his
eyes
were
blue
with
the
*NL*
colorless
blueness
of
the
marbles
called
``
aggies
''
that
*NL*
the
boys
of
Winesburg
carried
in
their
pockets
.
Elmer
*NL*
had
lived
in
Winesburg
for
a
year
and
had
made
no
*NL*
friends
.
He
was
,
he
felt
,
one
condemned
to
go
through
*NL*
life
without
friends
and
he
hated
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sullenly
the
tall
young
man
tramped
along
the
road
with
*NL*
his
hands
stuffed
into
his
trouser
pockets
.
The
day
was
*NL*
cold
with
a
raw
wind
,
but
presently
the
sun
began
to
*NL*
shine
and
the
road
became
soft
and
muddy
.
The
tops
of
*NL*
the
ridges
of
frozen
mud
that
formed
the
road
began
to
*NL*
melt
and
the
mud
clung
to
Elmer
's
shoes
.
His
feet
*NL*
became
cold
.
When
he
had
gone
several
miles
he
turned
*NL*
off
the
road
,
crossed
a
field
and
entered
a
wood
.
In
*NL*
the
wood
he
gathered
sticks
to
build
a
fire
,
by
which
*NL*
he
sat
trying
to
warm
himself
,
miserable
in
body
and
in
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
hours
he
sat
on
the
log
by
the
fire
and
then
,
*NL*
arising
and
creeping
cautiously
through
a
mass
of
*NL*
underbrush
,
he
went
to
a
fence
and
looked
across
fields
*NL*
to
a
small
farmhouse
surrounded
by
low
sheds
.
A
smile
*NL*
came
to
his
lips
and
he
began
making
motions
with
his
*NL*
long
arms
to
a
man
who
was
husking
corn
in
one
of
the
*NL*
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
hour
of
misery
the
young
merchant
had
returned
*NL*
to
the
farm
where
he
had
lived
through
boyhood
and
*NL*
where
there
was
another
human
being
to
whom
he
felt
he
*NL*
could
explain
himself
.
The
man
on
the
farm
was
a
*NL*
half-witted
old
fellow
named
Mook
.
He
had
once
been
*NL*
employed
by
Ebenezer
Cowley
and
had
stayed
on
the
farm
*NL*
when
it
was
sold
.
The
old
man
lived
in
one
of
the
*NL*
unpainted
sheds
back
of
the
farmhouse
and
puttered
*NL*
about
all
day
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mook
the
half-wit
lived
happily
.
With
childlike
faith
*NL*
he
believed
in
the
intelligence
of
the
animals
that
*NL*
lived
in
the
sheds
with
him
,
and
when
he
was
lonely
*NL*
held
long
conversations
with
the
cows
,
the
pigs
,
and
*NL*
even
with
the
chickens
that
ran
about
the
barnyard
.
He
*NL*
it
was
who
had
put
the
expression
regarding
being
*NL*
``
laundered
''
into
the
mouth
of
his
former
employer
.
When
*NL*
excited
or
surprised
by
anything
he
smiled
vaguely
and
*NL*
muttered
:
``
I
'll
be
washed
and
ironed
.
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
*NL*
be
washed
and
ironed
and
starched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
half-witted
old
man
left
his
husking
of
corn
*NL*
and
came
into
the
wood
to
meet
Elmer
Cowley
,
he
was
*NL*
neither
surprised
nor
especially
interested
in
the
*NL*
sudden
appearance
of
the
young
man
.
His
feet
also
were
*NL*
cold
and
he
sat
on
the
log
by
the
fire
,
grateful
for
*NL*
the
warmth
and
apparently
indifferent
to
what
Elmer
had
*NL*
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
talked
earnestly
and
with
great
freedom
,
walking
*NL*
up
and
down
and
waving
his
arms
about
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
understand
what
's
the
matter
with
me
so
of
course
you
*NL*
do
n't
care
,
''
he
declared
.
``
With
me
it
's
different
.
Look
*NL*
how
it
has
always
been
with
me
.
Father
is
queer
and
*NL*
mother
was
queer
,
too
.
Even
the
clothes
mother
used
to
*NL*
wear
were
not
like
other
people
's
clothes
,
and
look
at
*NL*
that
coat
in
which
father
goes
about
there
in
town
,
*NL*
thinking
he
's
dressed
up
,
too
.
Why
do
n't
he
get
a
new
*NL*
one
?
It
would
n't
cost
much
.
I
'll
tell
you
why
.
Father
*NL*
does
n't
know
and
when
mother
was
alive
she
did
n't
know
*NL*
either
.
Mabel
is
different
.
She
knows
but
she
wo
n't
say
*NL*
anything
.
I
will
,
though
.
I
'm
not
going
to
be
stared
at
*NL*
any
longer
.
Why
look
here
,
Mook
,
father
does
n't
know
*NL*
that
his
store
there
in
town
is
just
a
queer
jumble
,
*NL*
that
he
'll
never
sell
the
stuff
he
buys
.
He
knows
*NL*
nothing
about
it
.
Sometimes
he
's
a
little
worried
that
*NL*
trade
does
n't
come
and
then
he
goes
and
buys
something
*NL*
else
.
In
the
evenings
he
sits
by
the
fire
upstairs
and
*NL*
says
trade
will
come
after
a
while
.
He
is
n't
worried
.
*NL*
He
's
queer
.
He
does
n't
know
enough
to
be
worried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
young
man
became
more
excited
.
``
He
do
n't
*NL*
know
but
I
know
,
''
he
shouted
,
stopping
to
gaze
down
*NL*
into
the
dumb
,
unresponsive
face
of
the
half-wit
.
``
I
*NL*
know
too
well
.
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
When
we
lived
out
here
*NL*
it
was
different
.
I
worked
and
at
night
I
went
to
bed
*NL*
and
slept
.
I
was
n't
always
seeing
people
and
thinking
*NL*
as
I
am
now
.
In
the
evening
,
there
in
town
,
I
go
to
the
*NL*
post
office
or
to
the
depot
to
see
the
train
come
in
,
*NL*
and
no
one
says
anything
to
me
.
Everyone
stands
around
*NL*
and
laughs
and
they
talk
but
they
say
nothing
to
me
.
*NL*
Then
I
feel
so
queer
that
I
ca
n't
talk
either
.
I
go
*NL*
away
.
I
do
n't
say
anything
.
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fury
of
the
young
man
became
uncontrollable
.
``
I
*NL*
wo
n't
stand
it
,
''
he
yelled
,
looking
up
at
the
bare
*NL*
branches
of
the
trees
.
``
I
'm
not
made
to
stand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maddened
by
the
dull
face
of
the
man
on
the
log
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
Elmer
turned
and
glared
at
him
as
he
had
glared
*NL*
back
along
the
road
at
the
town
of
Winesburg
.
``
Go
on
*NL*
back
to
work
,
''
he
screamed
.
``
What
good
does
it
do
me
to
*NL*
talk
to
you
?
''
A
thought
came
to
him
and
his
voice
*NL*
dropped
.
``
I
'm
a
coward
too
,
eh
?
''
he
muttered
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
know
why
I
came
clear
out
here
afoot
?
I
had
to
tell
*NL*
someone
and
you
were
the
only
one
I
could
tell
.
I
*NL*
hunted
out
another
queer
one
,
you
see
.
I
ran
away
,
*NL*
that
's
what
I
did
.
I
could
n't
stand
up
to
someone
like
*NL*
that
George
Willard
.
I
had
to
come
to
you
.
I
ought
to
*NL*
tell
him
and
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
his
voice
arose
to
a
shout
and
his
arms
flew
*NL*
about
.
``
I
will
tell
him
.
I
wo
n't
be
queer
.
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
what
they
think
.
I
wo
n't
stand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
Cowley
ran
out
of
the
woods
leaving
the
half-wit
*NL*
sitting
on
the
log
before
the
fire
.
Presently
the
old
*NL*
man
arose
and
climbing
over
the
fence
went
back
to
his
*NL*
work
in
the
corn
.
``
I
'll
be
washed
and
ironed
and
*NL*
starched
,
''
he
declared
.
``
Well
,
well
,
I
'll
be
washed
and
*NL*
ironed
.
''
Mook
was
interested
.
He
went
along
a
lane
to
a
*NL*
field
where
two
cows
stood
nibbling
at
a
straw
stack
.
*NL*
``
Elmer
was
here
,
''
he
said
to
the
cows
.
``
Elmer
is
crazy
.
*NL*
You
better
get
behind
the
stack
where
he
do
n't
see
you
.
*NL*
He
'll
hurt
someone
yet
,
Elmer
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
that
evening
Elmer
Cowley
put
his
head
*NL*
in
at
the
front
door
of
the
office
of
the
Winesburg
*NL*
Eagle
where
George
Willard
sat
writing
.
His
cap
was
*NL*
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
a
sullen
determined
look
*NL*
was
on
his
face
.
``
You
come
on
outside
with
me
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
stepping
in
and
closing
the
door
.
He
kept
his
*NL*
hand
on
the
knob
as
though
prepared
to
resist
anyone
*NL*
else
coming
in
.
``
You
just
come
along
outside
.
I
want
to
*NL*
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
and
Elmer
Cowley
walked
through
the
main
*NL*
street
of
Winesburg
.
The
night
was
cold
and
George
*NL*
Willard
had
on
a
new
overcoat
and
looked
very
spruce
*NL*
and
dressed
up
.
He
thrust
his
hands
into
the
overcoat
*NL*
pockets
and
looked
inquiringly
at
his
companion
.
He
had
*NL*
long
been
wanting
to
make
friends
with
the
young
*NL*
merchant
and
find
out
what
was
in
his
mind
.
Now
he
*NL*
thought
he
saw
a
chance
and
was
delighted
.
``
I
wonder
*NL*
what
he
's
up
to
?
Perhaps
he
thinks
he
has
a
piece
of
*NL*
news
for
the
paper
.
It
ca
n't
be
a
fire
because
I
*NL*
have
n't
heard
the
fire
bell
and
there
is
n't
anyone
*NL*
running
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
main
street
of
Winesburg
,
on
the
cold
November
*NL*
evening
,
but
few
citizens
appeared
and
these
hurried
*NL*
along
bent
on
getting
to
the
stove
at
the
back
of
some
*NL*
store
.
The
windows
of
the
stores
were
frosted
and
the
*NL*
wind
rattled
the
tin
sign
that
hung
over
the
entrance
*NL*
to
the
stairway
leading
to
Doctor
Welling
's
office
.
*NL*
Before
Hern
's
Grocery
a
basket
of
apples
and
a
rack
*NL*
filled
with
new
brooms
stood
on
the
sidewalk
.
Elmer
*NL*
Cowley
stopped
and
stood
facing
George
Willard
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
talk
and
his
arms
began
to
pump
up
and
down
.
*NL*
His
face
worked
spasmodically
.
He
seemed
about
to
*NL*
shout
.
``
Oh
,
you
go
on
back
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Do
n't
stay
out
*NL*
here
with
me
.
I
ai
n't
got
anything
to
tell
you
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
see
you
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
hours
the
distracted
young
merchant
wandered
*NL*
through
the
resident
streets
of
Winesburg
blind
with
*NL*
anger
,
brought
on
by
his
failure
to
declare
his
*NL*
determination
not
to
be
queer
.
Bitterly
the
sense
of
*NL*
defeat
settled
upon
him
and
he
wanted
to
weep
.
After
*NL*
the
hours
of
futile
sputtering
at
nothingness
that
had
*NL*
occupied
the
afternoon
and
his
failure
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
young
reporter
,
he
thought
he
could
see
no
hope
*NL*
of
a
future
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
a
new
idea
dawned
for
him
.
In
the
darkness
*NL*
that
surrounded
him
he
began
to
see
a
light
.
Going
to
*NL*
the
now
darkened
store
,
where
Cowley
&
Son
had
for
over
*NL*
a
year
waited
vainly
for
trade
to
come
,
he
crept
*NL*
stealthily
in
and
felt
about
in
a
barrel
that
stood
by
*NL*
the
stove
at
the
rear
.
In
the
barrel
beneath
shavings
*NL*
lay
a
tin
box
containing
Cowley
&
Son
's
cash
.
Every
*NL*
evening
Ebenezer
Cowley
put
the
box
in
the
barrel
when
*NL*
he
closed
the
store
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
.
``
They
*NL*
would
n't
never
think
of
a
careless
place
like
that
,
''
he
*NL*
told
himself
,
thinking
of
robbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
took
twenty
dollars
,
two
ten-dollar
bills
,
from
*NL*
the
little
roll
containing
perhaps
four
hundred
*NL*
dollars
,
the
cash
left
from
the
sale
of
the
farm
.
Then
*NL*
replacing
the
box
beneath
the
shavings
he
went
quietly
*NL*
out
at
the
front
door
and
walked
again
in
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
that
he
thought
might
put
an
end
to
all
of
his
*NL*
unhappiness
was
very
simple
.
``
I
will
get
out
of
here
,
*NL*
run
away
from
home
,
''
he
told
himself
.
He
knew
that
a
*NL*
local
freight
train
passed
through
Winesburg
at
*NL*
midnight
and
went
on
to
Cleveland
,
where
it
arrived
at
*NL*
dawn
.
He
would
steal
a
ride
on
the
local
and
when
he
*NL*
got
to
Cleveland
would
lose
himself
in
the
crowds
*NL*
there
.
He
would
get
work
in
some
shop
and
become
*NL*
friends
with
the
other
workmen
and
would
be
*NL*
indistinguishable
.
Then
he
could
talk
and
laugh
.
He
*NL*
would
no
longer
be
queer
and
would
make
friends
.
Life
*NL*
would
begin
to
have
warmth
and
meaning
for
him
as
it
*NL*
had
for
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
awkward
young
man
,
striding
through
the
*NL*
streets
,
laughed
at
himself
because
he
had
been
angry
*NL*
and
had
been
half
afraid
of
George
Willard
.
He
decided
*NL*
he
would
have
his
talk
with
the
young
reporter
before
*NL*
he
left
town
,
that
he
would
tell
him
about
things
,
*NL*
perhaps
challenge
him
,
challenge
all
of
Winesburg
*NL*
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aglow
with
new
confidence
Elmer
went
to
the
office
of
*NL*
the
New
Willard
House
and
pounded
on
the
door
.
A
*NL*
sleep-eyed
boy
slept
on
a
cot
in
the
office
.
He
*NL*
received
no
salary
but
was
fed
at
the
hotel
table
and
*NL*
bore
with
pride
the
title
of
``
night
clerk
.
''
Before
the
*NL*
boy
Elmer
was
bold
,
insistent
.
``
You
`
wake
him
up
,
''
he
*NL*
commanded
.
``
You
tell
him
to
come
down
by
the
depot
.
I
*NL*
got
to
see
him
and
I
'm
going
away
on
the
local
.
Tell
*NL*
him
to
dress
and
come
on
down
.
I
ai
n't
got
much
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
midnight
local
had
finished
its
work
in
Winesburg
*NL*
and
the
trainsmen
were
coupling
cars
,
swinging
lanterns
*NL*
and
preparing
to
resume
their
flight
east
.
George
*NL*
Willard
,
rubbing
his
eyes
and
again
wearing
the
new
*NL*
overcoat
,
ran
down
to
the
station
platform
afire
with
*NL*
curiosity
.
``
Well
,
here
I
am
.
What
do
you
want
?
You
've
*NL*
got
something
to
tell
me
,
eh
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
tried
to
explain
.
He
wet
his
lips
with
his
*NL*
tongue
and
looked
at
the
train
that
had
begun
to
groan
*NL*
and
get
under
way
.
``
Well
,
you
see
,
''
he
began
,
and
then
*NL*
lost
control
of
his
tongue
.
``
I
'll
be
washed
and
ironed
.
*NL*
I
'll
be
washed
and
ironed
and
starched
,
''
he
muttered
*NL*
half
incoherently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elmer
Cowley
danced
with
fury
beside
the
groaning
train
*NL*
in
the
darkness
on
the
station
platform
.
Lights
leaped
*NL*
into
the
air
and
bobbed
up
and
down
before
his
eyes
.
*NL*
Taking
the
two
ten-dollar
bills
from
his
pocket
he
*NL*
thrust
them
into
George
Willard
's
hand
.
``
Take
them
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
I
do
n't
want
them
.
Give
them
to
father
.
I
stole
*NL*
them
.
''
With
a
snarl
of
rage
he
turned
and
his
long
arms
*NL*
began
to
flay
the
air
.
Like
one
struggling
for
release
*NL*
from
hands
that
held
him
he
struck
out
,
hitting
George
*NL*
Willard
blow
after
blow
on
the
breast
,
the
neck
,
the
*NL*
mouth
.
The
young
reporter
rolled
over
on
the
platform
*NL*
half
unconscious
,
stunned
by
the
terrific
force
of
the
*NL*
blows
.
Springing
aboard
the
passing
train
and
running
*NL*
over
the
tops
of
cars
,
Elmer
sprang
down
to
a
flat
car
*NL*
and
lying
on
his
face
looked
back
,
trying
to
see
the
*NL*
fallen
man
in
the
darkness
.
Pride
surged
up
in
him
.
``
I
*NL*
showed
him
,
''
he
cried
.
``
I
guess
I
showed
him
.
I
ai
n't
*NL*
so
queer
.
I
guess
I
showed
him

THE
UNTOLD
LIE
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
Pearson
and
Hal
Winters
were
farm
hands
employed
on
*NL*
a
farm
three
miles
north
of
Winesburg
.
On
Saturday
*NL*
afternoons
they
came
into
town
and
wandered
about
*NL*
through
the
streets
with
other
fellows
from
the
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
was
a
quiet
,
rather
nervous
man
of
perhaps
fifty
*NL*
with
a
brown
beard
and
shoulders
rounded
by
too
much
*NL*
and
too
hard
labor
.
In
his
nature
he
was
as
unlike
Hal
*NL*
Winters
as
two
men
can
be
unlike
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
was
an
altogether
serious
man
and
had
a
little
*NL*
sharp-featured
wife
who
had
also
a
sharp
voice
.
The
*NL*
two
,
with
half
a
dozen
thin-legged
children
,
lived
in
a
*NL*
tumble-down
frame
house
beside
a
creek
at
the
back
end
*NL*
of
the
Wills
farm
where
Ray
was
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
Winters
,
his
fellow
employee
,
was
a
young
fellow
.
*NL*
He
was
not
of
the
Ned
Winters
family
,
who
were
very
*NL*
respectable
people
in
Winesburg
,
but
was
one
of
the
*NL*
three
sons
of
the
old
man
called
Windpeter
Winters
who
*NL*
had
a
sawmill
near
Unionville
,
six
miles
away
,
and
who
*NL*
was
looked
upon
by
everyone
in
Winesburg
as
a
confirmed
*NL*
old
reprobate
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
from
the
part
of
Northern
Ohio
in
which
*NL*
Winesburg
lies
will
remember
old
Windpeter
by
his
*NL*
unusual
and
tragic
death
.
He
got
drunk
one
evening
in
*NL*
town
and
started
to
drive
home
to
Unionville
along
the
*NL*
railroad
tracks
.
Henry
Brattenburg
,
the
butcher
,
who
*NL*
lived
out
that
way
,
stopped
him
at
the
edge
of
the
town
*NL*
and
told
him
he
was
sure
to
meet
the
down
train
but
*NL*
Windpeter
slashed
at
him
with
his
whip
and
drove
on
.
*NL*
When
the
train
struck
and
killed
him
and
his
two
horses
*NL*
a
farmer
and
his
wife
who
were
driving
home
along
a
*NL*
nearby
road
saw
the
accident
.
They
said
that
old
*NL*
Windpeter
stood
up
on
the
seat
of
his
wagon
,
raving
and
*NL*
swearing
at
the
onrushing
locomotive
,
and
that
he
*NL*
fairly
screamed
with
delight
when
the
team
,
maddened
by
*NL*
his
incessant
slashing
at
them
,
rushed
straight
ahead
*NL*
to
certain
death
.
Boys
like
young
George
Willard
and
*NL*
Seth
Richmond
will
remember
the
incident
quite
vividly
*NL*
because
,
although
everyone
in
our
town
said
that
the
*NL*
old
man
would
go
straight
to
hell
and
that
the
*NL*
community
was
better
off
without
him
,
they
had
a
secret
*NL*
conviction
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
admired
*NL*
his
foolish
courage
.
Most
boys
have
seasons
of
wishing
*NL*
they
could
die
gloriously
instead
of
just
being
grocery
*NL*
clerks
and
going
on
with
their
humdrum
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
not
the
story
of
Windpeter
Winters
nor
yet
*NL*
of
his
son
Hal
who
worked
on
the
Wills
farm
with
Ray
*NL*
Pearson
.
It
is
Ray
's
story
.
It
will
,
however
,
be
*NL*
necessary
to
talk
a
little
of
young
Hal
so
that
you
*NL*
will
get
into
the
spirit
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
was
a
bad
one
.
Everyone
said
that
.
There
were
*NL*
three
of
the
Winters
boys
in
that
family
,
John
,
Hal
,
*NL*
and
Edward
,
all
broad-shouldered
big
fellows
like
old
*NL*
Windpeter
himself
and
all
fighters
and
woman-chasers
*NL*
and
generally
all-around
bad
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
was
the
worst
of
the
lot
and
always
up
to
some
*NL*
devilment
.
He
once
stole
a
load
of
boards
from
his
*NL*
father
's
mill
and
sold
them
in
Winesburg
.
With
the
*NL*
money
he
bought
himself
a
suit
of
cheap
,
flashy
*NL*
clothes
.
Then
he
got
drunk
and
when
his
father
came
*NL*
raving
into
town
to
find
him
,
they
met
and
fought
with
*NL*
their
fists
on
Main
Street
and
were
arrested
and
put
*NL*
into
jail
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
went
to
work
on
the
Wills
farm
because
there
was
a
*NL*
country
school
teacher
out
that
way
who
had
taken
his
*NL*
fancy
.
He
was
only
twenty-two
then
but
had
already
been
*NL*
in
two
or
three
of
what
were
spoken
of
in
Winesburg
as
*NL*
``
women
scrapes
.
''
Everyone
who
heard
of
his
infatuation
*NL*
for
the
school
teacher
was
sure
it
would
turn
out
*NL*
badly
.
``
He
'll
only
get
her
into
trouble
,
you
'll
see
,
''
*NL*
was
the
word
that
went
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
these
two
men
,
Ray
and
Hal
,
were
at
work
in
a
*NL*
field
on
a
day
in
the
late
October
.
They
were
husking
*NL*
corn
and
occasionally
something
was
said
and
they
*NL*
laughed
.
Then
came
silence
.
Ray
,
who
was
the
more
*NL*
sensitive
and
always
minded
things
more
,
had
chapped
*NL*
hands
and
they
hurt
.
He
put
them
into
his
coat
pockets
*NL*
and
looked
away
across
the
fields
.
He
was
in
a
sad
,
*NL*
distracted
mood
and
was
affected
by
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
country
.
If
you
knew
the
Winesburg
country
in
the
fall
*NL*
and
how
the
low
hills
are
all
splashed
with
yellows
and
*NL*
reds
you
would
understand
his
feeling
.
He
began
to
*NL*
think
of
the
time
,
long
ago
when
he
was
a
young
fellow
*NL*
living
with
his
father
,
then
a
baker
in
Winesburg
,
and
*NL*
how
on
such
days
he
had
wandered
away
into
the
woods
to
*NL*
gather
nuts
,
hunt
rabbits
,
or
just
to
loaf
about
and
*NL*
smoke
his
pipe
.
His
marriage
had
come
about
through
one
*NL*
of
his
days
of
wandering
.
He
had
induced
a
girl
who
*NL*
waited
on
trade
in
his
father
's
shop
to
go
with
him
and
*NL*
something
had
happened
.
He
was
thinking
of
that
*NL*
afternoon
and
how
it
had
affected
his
whole
life
when
a
*NL*
spirit
of
protest
awoke
in
him
.
He
had
forgotten
about
*NL*
Hal
and
muttered
words
.
``
Tricked
by
Gad
,
that
's
what
I
*NL*
was
,
tricked
by
life
and
made
a
fool
of
,
''
he
said
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
understanding
his
thoughts
,
Hal
Winters
spoke
*NL*
up
.
``
Well
,
has
it
been
worth
while
?
What
about
it
,
eh
?
*NL*
What
about
marriage
and
all
that
?
''
he
asked
and
then
*NL*
laughed
.
Hal
tried
to
keep
on
laughing
but
he
too
was
*NL*
in
an
earnest
mood
.
He
began
to
talk
earnestly
.
``
Has
a
*NL*
fellow
got
to
do
it
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Has
he
got
to
be
*NL*
harnessed
up
and
driven
through
life
like
a
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hal
did
n't
wait
for
an
answer
but
sprang
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
began
to
walk
back
and
forth
between
the
corn
*NL*
shocks
.
He
was
getting
more
and
more
excited
.
Bending
*NL*
down
suddenly
he
picked
up
an
ear
of
the
yellow
corn
*NL*
and
threw
it
at
the
fence
.
``
I
've
got
Nell
Gunther
in
*NL*
trouble
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
telling
you
,
but
you
keep
your
*NL*
mouth
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
Pearson
arose
and
stood
staring
.
He
was
almost
a
*NL*
foot
shorter
than
Hal
,
and
when
the
younger
man
came
*NL*
and
put
his
two
hands
on
the
older
man
's
shoulders
they
*NL*
made
a
picture
.
There
they
stood
in
the
big
empty
field
*NL*
with
the
quiet
corn
shocks
standing
in
rows
behind
them
*NL*
and
the
red
and
yellow
hills
in
the
distance
,
and
from
*NL*
being
just
two
indifferent
workmen
they
had
become
all
*NL*
alive
to
each
other
.
Hal
sensed
it
and
because
that
was
*NL*
his
way
he
laughed
.
``
Well
,
old
daddy
,
''
he
said
*NL*
awkwardly
,
``
come
on
,
advise
me
.
I
've
got
Nell
in
*NL*
trouble
.
Perhaps
you
've
been
in
the
same
fix
yourself
.
*NL*
I
know
what
everyone
would
say
is
the
right
thing
to
*NL*
do
,
but
what
do
you
say
?
Shall
I
marry
and
settle
down
?
*NL*
Shall
I
put
myself
into
the
harness
to
be
worn
out
like
*NL*
an
old
horse
?
You
know
me
,
Ray
.
There
ca
n't
anyone
*NL*
break
me
but
I
can
break
myself
.
Shall
I
do
it
or
shall
*NL*
I
tell
Nell
to
go
to
the
devil
?
Come
on
,
you
tell
me
.
*NL*
Whatever
you
say
,
Ray
,
I
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
could
n't
answer
.
He
shook
Hal
's
hands
loose
and
*NL*
turning
walked
straight
away
toward
the
barn
.
He
was
a
*NL*
sensitive
man
and
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
.
He
knew
*NL*
there
was
only
one
thing
to
say
to
Hal
Winters
,
son
of
*NL*
old
Windpeter
Winters
,
only
one
thing
that
all
his
own
*NL*
training
and
all
the
beliefs
of
the
people
he
knew
*NL*
would
approve
,
but
for
his
life
he
could
n't
say
what
he
*NL*
knew
he
should
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
four
that
afternoon
Ray
was
puttering
*NL*
about
the
barnyard
when
his
wife
came
up
the
lane
along
*NL*
the
creek
and
called
him
.
After
the
talk
with
Hal
he
*NL*
had
n't
returned
to
the
cornfield
but
worked
about
the
*NL*
barn
.
He
had
already
done
the
evening
chores
and
had
*NL*
seen
Hal
,
dressed
and
ready
for
a
roistering
night
in
*NL*
town
,
come
out
of
the
farmhouse
and
go
into
the
road
.
*NL*
Along
the
path
to
his
own
house
he
trudged
behind
his
*NL*
wife
,
looking
at
the
ground
and
thinking
.
He
could
n't
*NL*
make
out
what
was
wrong
.
Every
time
he
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
and
saw
the
beauty
of
the
country
in
the
failing
light
*NL*
he
wanted
to
do
something
he
had
never
done
before
,
*NL*
shout
or
scream
or
hit
his
wife
with
his
fists
or
*NL*
something
equally
unexpected
and
terrifying
.
Along
the
*NL*
path
he
went
scratching
his
head
and
trying
to
make
it
*NL*
out
.
He
looked
hard
at
his
wife
's
back
but
she
seemed
*NL*
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
wanted
him
to
go
into
town
for
groceries
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
had
told
him
what
she
wanted
began
to
*NL*
scold
.
``
You
're
always
puttering
,
''
she
said
.
``
Now
I
want
*NL*
you
to
hustle
.
There
is
n't
anything
in
the
house
for
*NL*
supper
and
you
've
got
to
get
to
town
and
back
in
a
*NL*
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
went
into
his
own
house
and
took
an
overcoat
from
a
*NL*
hook
back
of
the
door
.
It
was
torn
about
the
pockets
*NL*
and
the
collar
was
shiny
.
His
wife
went
into
the
*NL*
bedroom
and
presently
came
out
with
a
soiled
cloth
in
*NL*
one
hand
and
three
silver
dollars
in
the
other
.
*NL*
Somewhere
in
the
house
a
child
wept
bitterly
and
a
dog
*NL*
that
had
been
sleeping
by
the
stove
arose
and
yawned
.
*NL*
Again
the
wife
scolded
.
``
The
children
will
cry
and
cry
.
*NL*
Why
are
you
always
puttering
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
went
out
of
the
house
and
climbed
the
fence
into
a
*NL*
field
.
It
was
just
growing
dark
and
the
scene
that
lay
*NL*
before
him
was
lovely
.
All
the
low
hills
were
washed
*NL*
with
color
and
even
the
little
clusters
of
bushes
in
*NL*
the
corners
of
the
fences
were
alive
with
beauty
.
The
*NL*
whole
world
seemed
to
Ray
Pearson
to
have
become
alive
*NL*
with
something
just
as
he
and
Hal
had
suddenly
become
*NL*
alive
when
they
stood
in
the
corn
field
staring
into
*NL*
each
other
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beauty
of
the
country
about
Winesburg
was
too
much
*NL*
for
Ray
on
that
fall
evening
.
That
is
all
there
was
to
*NL*
it
.
He
could
not
stand
it
.
Of
a
sudden
he
forgot
all
*NL*
about
being
a
quiet
old
farm
hand
and
throwing
off
the
*NL*
torn
overcoat
began
to
run
across
the
field
.
As
he
ran
*NL*
he
shouted
a
protest
against
his
life
,
against
all
*NL*
life
,
against
everything
that
makes
life
ugly
.
``
There
*NL*
was
no
promise
made
,
''
he
cried
into
the
empty
spaces
*NL*
that
lay
about
him
.
``
I
did
n't
promise
my
Minnie
*NL*
anything
and
Hal
has
n't
made
any
promise
to
Nell
.
I
*NL*
know
he
has
n't
.
She
went
into
the
woods
with
him
*NL*
because
she
wanted
to
go
.
What
he
wanted
she
wanted
.
*NL*
Why
should
I
pay
?
Why
should
Hal
pay
?
Why
should
anyone
*NL*
pay
?
I
do
n't
want
Hal
to
become
old
and
worn
out
.
I
'll
*NL*
tell
him
.
I
wo
n't
let
it
go
on
.
I
'll
catch
Hal
before
*NL*
he
gets
to
town
and
I
'll
tell
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
ran
clumsily
and
once
he
stumbled
and
fell
down
.
*NL*
``
I
must
catch
Hal
and
tell
him
,
''
he
kept
thinking
,
and
*NL*
although
his
breath
came
in
gasps
he
kept
running
*NL*
harder
and
harder
.
As
he
ran
he
thought
of
things
that
*NL*
had
n't
come
into
his
mind
for
years
--
how
at
the
time
he
*NL*
married
he
had
planned
to
go
west
to
his
uncle
in
*NL*
Portland
,
Oregon
--
how
he
had
n't
wanted
to
be
a
farm
*NL*
hand
,
but
had
thought
when
he
got
out
West
he
would
go
*NL*
to
sea
and
be
a
sailor
or
get
a
job
on
a
ranch
and
ride
*NL*
a
horse
into
Western
towns
,
shouting
and
laughing
and
*NL*
waking
the
people
in
the
houses
with
his
wild
cries
.
*NL*
Then
as
he
ran
he
remembered
his
children
and
in
fancy
*NL*
felt
their
hands
clutching
at
him
.
All
of
his
thoughts
*NL*
of
himself
were
involved
with
the
thoughts
of
Hal
and
*NL*
he
thought
the
children
were
clutching
at
the
younger
*NL*
man
also
.
``
They
are
the
accidents
of
life
,
Hal
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
They
are
not
mine
or
yours
.
I
had
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darkness
began
to
spread
over
the
fields
as
Ray
Pearson
*NL*
ran
on
and
on
.
His
breath
came
in
little
sobs
.
When
he
*NL*
came
to
the
fence
at
the
edge
of
the
road
and
*NL*
confronted
Hal
Winters
,
all
dressed
up
and
smoking
a
*NL*
pipe
as
he
walked
jauntily
along
,
he
could
not
have
*NL*
told
what
he
thought
or
what
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
Pearson
lost
his
nerve
and
this
is
really
the
end
*NL*
of
the
story
of
what
happened
to
him
.
It
was
almost
*NL*
dark
when
he
got
to
the
fence
and
he
put
his
hands
on
*NL*
the
top
bar
and
stood
staring
.
Hal
Winters
jumped
a
*NL*
ditch
and
coming
up
close
to
Ray
put
his
hands
into
his
*NL*
pockets
and
laughed
.
He
seemed
to
have
lost
his
own
*NL*
sense
of
what
had
happened
in
the
corn
field
and
when
*NL*
he
put
up
a
strong
hand
and
took
hold
of
the
lapel
of
*NL*
Ray
's
coat
he
shook
the
old
man
as
he
might
have
shaken
*NL*
a
dog
that
had
misbehaved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
to
tell
me
,
eh
?
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
never
mind
*NL*
telling
me
anything
.
I
'm
not
a
coward
and
I
've
already
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
.
''
He
laughed
again
and
jumped
back
*NL*
across
the
ditch
.
``
Nell
ai
n't
no
fool
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
*NL*
did
n't
ask
me
to
marry
her
.
I
want
to
marry
her
.
I
want
*NL*
to
settle
down
and
have
kids
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
Pearson
also
laughed
.
He
felt
like
laughing
at
*NL*
himself
and
all
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
form
of
Hal
Winters
disappeared
in
the
dusk
that
*NL*
lay
over
the
road
that
led
to
Winesburg
,
he
turned
and
*NL*
walked
slowly
back
across
the
fields
to
where
he
had
*NL*
left
his
torn
overcoat
.
As
he
went
some
memory
of
*NL*
pleasant
evenings
spent
with
the
thin-legged
children
*NL*
in
the
tumble-down
house
by
the
creek
must
have
come
*NL*
into
his
mind
,
for
he
muttered
words
.
``
It
's
just
as
*NL*
well
.
Whatever
I
told
him
would
have
been
a
lie
,
''
he
*NL*
said
softly
,
and
then
his
form
also
disappeared
into
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DRINK
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Foster
came
to
Winesburg
from
Cincinnati
when
he
*NL*
was
still
young
and
could
get
many
new
impressions
.
His
*NL*
grandmother
had
been
raised
on
a
farm
near
the
town
and
*NL*
as
a
young
girl
had
gone
to
school
there
when
Winesburg
*NL*
was
a
village
of
twelve
or
fifteen
houses
clustered
*NL*
about
a
general
store
on
the
Trunion
Pike
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
life
the
old
woman
had
led
since
she
went
away
*NL*
from
the
frontier
settlement
and
what
a
strong
,
capable
*NL*
little
old
thing
she
was
!
She
had
been
in
Kansas
,
in
*NL*
Canada
,
and
in
New
York
City
,
traveling
about
with
her
*NL*
husband
,
a
mechanic
,
before
he
died
.
Later
she
went
to
*NL*
stay
with
her
daughter
,
who
had
also
married
a
mechanic
*NL*
and
lived
in
Covington
,
Kentucky
,
across
the
river
from
*NL*
Cincinnati
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
began
the
hard
years
for
Tom
Foster
's
grandmother
.
*NL*
First
her
son-in-law
was
killed
by
a
policeman
during
a
*NL*
strike
and
then
Tom
's
mother
became
an
invalid
and
died
*NL*
also
.
The
grandmother
had
saved
a
little
money
,
but
it
*NL*
was
swept
away
by
the
illness
of
the
daughter
and
by
*NL*
the
cost
of
the
two
funerals
.
She
became
a
half
*NL*
worn-out
old
woman
worker
and
lived
with
the
grandson
*NL*
above
a
junk
shop
on
a
side
street
in
Cincinnati
.
For
*NL*
five
years
she
scrubbed
the
floors
in
an
office
*NL*
building
and
then
got
a
place
as
dish
washer
in
a
*NL*
restaurant
.
Her
hands
were
all
twisted
out
of
shape
.
*NL*
When
she
took
hold
of
a
mop
or
a
broom
handle
the
hands
*NL*
looked
like
the
dried
stems
of
an
old
creeping
vine
*NL*
clinging
to
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
came
back
to
Winesburg
as
soon
as
she
got
*NL*
the
chance
.
One
evening
as
she
was
coming
home
from
*NL*
work
she
found
a
pocket-book
containing
thirty-seven
*NL*
dollars
,
and
that
opened
the
way
.
The
trip
was
a
great
*NL*
adventure
for
the
boy
.
It
was
past
seven
o'clock
at
*NL*
night
when
the
grandmother
came
home
with
the
*NL*
pocket-book
held
tightly
in
her
old
hands
and
she
was
*NL*
so
excited
she
could
scarcely
speak
.
She
insisted
on
*NL*
leaving
Cincinnati
that
night
,
saying
that
if
they
*NL*
stayed
until
morning
the
owner
of
the
money
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
find
them
out
and
make
trouble
.
Tom
,
who
was
*NL*
then
sixteen
years
old
,
had
to
go
trudging
off
to
the
*NL*
station
with
the
old
woman
,
bearing
all
of
their
*NL*
earthly
belongings
done
up
in
a
worn-out
blanket
and
*NL*
slung
across
his
back
.
By
his
side
walked
the
*NL*
grandmother
urging
him
forward
.
Her
toothless
old
mouth
*NL*
twitched
nervously
,
and
when
Tom
grew
weary
and
wanted
*NL*
to
put
the
pack
down
at
a
street
crossing
,
she
snatched
*NL*
it
up
and
if
he
had
not
prevented
would
have
slung
it
*NL*
across
her
own
back
.
When
they
got
into
the
train
and
*NL*
it
had
run
out
of
the
city
she
was
as
delighted
as
a
*NL*
girl
and
talked
as
the
boy
had
never
heard
her
talk
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
the
night
as
the
train
rattled
along
,
the
*NL*
grandmother
told
Tom
tales
of
Winesburg
and
of
how
he
*NL*
would
enjoy
his
life
working
in
the
fields
and
shooting
*NL*
wild
things
in
the
woods
there
.
She
could
not
believe
*NL*
that
the
tiny
village
of
fifty
years
before
had
grown
*NL*
into
a
thriving
town
in
her
absence
,
and
in
the
morning
*NL*
when
the
train
came
to
Winesburg
did
not
want
to
get
*NL*
off
.
``
It
is
n't
what
I
thought
.
It
may
be
hard
for
you
*NL*
here
,
''
she
said
,
and
then
the
train
went
on
its
way
and
*NL*
the
two
stood
confused
,
not
knowing
where
to
turn
,
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
Albert
Longworth
,
the
Winesburg
baggage
*NL*
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
Foster
did
get
along
all
right
.
He
was
one
to
*NL*
get
along
anywhere
.
Mrs.
White
,
the
banker
's
wife
,
*NL*
employed
his
grandmother
to
work
in
the
kitchen
and
he
*NL*
got
a
place
as
stable
boy
in
the
banker
's
new
brick
*NL*
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
servants
were
hard
to
get
.
The
woman
who
*NL*
wanted
help
in
her
housework
employed
a
``
hired
girl
''
*NL*
who
insisted
on
sitting
at
the
table
with
the
family
.
*NL*
Mrs.
White
was
sick
of
hired
girls
and
snatched
at
the
*NL*
chance
to
get
hold
of
the
old
city
woman
.
She
furnished
*NL*
a
room
for
the
boy
Tom
upstairs
in
the
barn
.
``
He
can
*NL*
mow
the
lawn
and
run
errands
when
the
horses
do
not
*NL*
need
attention
,
''
she
explained
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Foster
was
rather
small
for
his
age
and
had
a
large
*NL*
head
covered
with
stiff
black
hair
that
stood
straight
*NL*
up
.
The
hair
emphasized
the
bigness
of
his
head
.
His
*NL*
voice
was
the
softest
thing
imaginable
,
and
he
was
*NL*
himself
so
gentle
and
quiet
that
he
slipped
into
the
*NL*
life
of
the
town
without
attracting
the
least
bit
of
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
could
not
help
wondering
where
Tom
Foster
got
his
*NL*
gentleness
.
In
Cincinnati
he
had
lived
in
a
*NL*
neighborhood
where
gangs
of
tough
boys
prowled
through
*NL*
the
streets
,
and
all
through
his
early
formative
years
*NL*
he
ran
about
with
tough
boys
.
For
a
while
he
was
a
*NL*
messenger
for
a
telegraph
company
and
delivered
*NL*
messages
in
a
neighborhood
sprinkled
with
houses
of
*NL*
prostitution
.
The
women
in
the
houses
knew
and
loved
*NL*
Tom
Foster
and
the
tough
boys
in
the
gangs
loved
him
*NL*
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
asserted
himself
.
That
was
one
thing
that
*NL*
helped
him
escape
.
In
an
odd
way
he
stood
in
the
shadow
*NL*
of
the
wall
of
life
,
was
meant
to
stand
in
the
shadow
.
*NL*
He
saw
the
men
and
women
in
the
houses
of
lust
,
sensed
*NL*
their
casual
and
horrible
love
affairs
,
saw
boys
*NL*
fighting
and
listened
to
their
tales
of
thieving
and
*NL*
drunkenness
,
unmoved
and
strangely
unaffected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
Tom
did
steal
.
That
was
while
he
still
lived
in
*NL*
the
city
.
The
grandmother
was
ill
at
the
time
and
he
*NL*
himself
was
out
of
work
.
There
was
nothing
to
eat
in
*NL*
the
house
,
and
so
he
went
into
a
harness
shop
on
a
side
*NL*
street
and
stole
a
dollar
and
seventy-five
cents
out
of
*NL*
the
cash
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
harness
shop
was
run
by
an
old
man
with
a
long
*NL*
mustache
.
He
saw
the
boy
lurking
about
and
thought
*NL*
nothing
of
it
.
When
he
went
out
into
the
street
to
talk
*NL*
to
a
teamster
Tom
opened
the
cash
drawer
and
taking
the
*NL*
money
walked
away
.
Later
he
was
caught
and
his
*NL*
grandmother
settled
the
matter
by
offering
to
come
*NL*
twice
a
week
for
a
month
and
scrub
the
shop
.
The
boy
*NL*
was
ashamed
,
but
he
was
rather
glad
,
too
.
``
It
is
all
*NL*
right
to
be
ashamed
and
makes
me
understand
new
*NL*
things
,
''
he
said
to
the
grandmother
,
who
did
n't
know
*NL*
what
the
boy
was
talking
about
but
loved
him
so
much
*NL*
that
it
did
n't
matter
whether
she
understood
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
year
Tom
Foster
lived
in
the
banker
's
stable
and
*NL*
then
lost
his
place
there
.
He
did
n't
take
very
good
*NL*
care
of
the
horses
and
he
was
a
constant
source
of
*NL*
irritation
to
the
banker
's
wife
.
She
told
him
to
mow
*NL*
the
lawn
and
he
forgot
.
Then
she
sent
him
to
the
store
*NL*
or
to
the
post
office
and
he
did
not
come
back
but
*NL*
joined
a
group
of
men
and
boys
and
spent
the
whole
*NL*
afternoon
with
them
,
standing
about
,
listening
and
*NL*
occasionally
,
when
addressed
,
saying
a
few
words
.
As
in
*NL*
the
city
in
the
houses
of
prostitution
and
with
the
*NL*
rowdy
boys
running
through
the
streets
at
night
,
so
in
*NL*
Winesburg
among
its
citizens
he
had
always
the
power
to
*NL*
be
a
part
of
and
yet
distinctly
apart
from
the
life
*NL*
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Tom
lost
his
place
at
Banker
White
's
he
did
not
*NL*
live
with
his
grandmother
,
although
often
in
the
*NL*
evening
she
came
to
visit
him
.
He
rented
a
room
at
the
*NL*
rear
of
a
little
frame
building
belonging
to
old
Rufus
*NL*
Whiting
.
The
building
was
on
Duane
Street
,
just
off
*NL*
Main
Street
,
and
had
been
used
for
years
as
a
law
*NL*
office
by
the
old
man
,
who
had
become
too
feeble
and
*NL*
forgetful
for
the
practice
of
his
profession
but
did
*NL*
not
realize
his
inefficiency
.
He
liked
Tom
and
let
him
*NL*
have
the
room
for
a
dollar
a
month
.
In
the
late
*NL*
afternoon
when
the
lawyer
had
gone
home
the
boy
had
the
*NL*
place
to
himself
and
spent
hours
lying
on
the
floor
by
*NL*
the
stove
and
thinking
of
things
.
In
the
evening
the
*NL*
grandmother
came
and
sat
in
the
lawyer
's
chair
to
smoke
*NL*
a
pipe
while
Tom
remained
silent
,
as
he
always
did
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
the
old
woman
talked
with
great
vigor
.
Sometimes
*NL*
she
was
angry
about
some
happening
at
the
banker
's
*NL*
house
and
scolded
away
for
hours
.
Out
of
her
own
*NL*
earnings
she
bought
a
mop
and
regularly
scrubbed
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
office
.
Then
when
the
place
was
spotlessly
*NL*
clean
and
smelled
clean
she
lighted
her
clay
pipe
and
*NL*
she
and
Tom
had
a
smoke
together
.
``
When
you
get
ready
*NL*
to
die
then
I
will
die
also
,
''
she
said
to
the
boy
lying
*NL*
on
the
floor
beside
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Foster
enjoyed
life
in
Winesburg
.
He
did
odd
jobs
,
*NL*
such
as
cutting
wood
for
kitchen
stoves
and
mowing
the
*NL*
grass
before
houses
.
In
late
May
and
early
June
he
*NL*
picked
strawberries
in
the
fields
.
He
had
time
to
loaf
*NL*
and
he
enjoyed
loafing
.
Banker
White
had
given
him
a
*NL*
cast-off
coat
which
was
too
large
for
him
,
but
his
*NL*
grandmother
cut
it
down
,
and
he
had
also
an
overcoat
,
*NL*
got
at
the
same
place
,
that
was
lined
with
fur
.
The
fur
*NL*
was
worn
away
in
spots
,
but
the
coat
was
warm
and
in
*NL*
the
winter
Tom
slept
in
it
.
He
thought
his
method
of
*NL*
getting
along
good
enough
and
was
happy
and
satisfied
*NL*
with
the
way
life
in
Winesburg
had
turned
out
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
absurd
little
things
made
Tom
Foster
happy
.
*NL*
That
,
I
suppose
,
was
why
people
loved
him
.
In
Hern
's
*NL*
Grocery
they
would
be
roasting
coffee
on
Friday
*NL*
afternoon
,
preparatory
to
the
Saturday
rush
of
trade
,
*NL*
and
the
rich
odor
invaded
lower
Main
Street
.
Tom
Foster
*NL*
appeared
and
sat
on
a
box
at
the
rear
of
the
store
.
For
*NL*
an
hour
he
did
not
move
but
sat
perfectly
still
,
*NL*
filling
his
being
with
the
spicy
odor
that
made
him
*NL*
half
drunk
with
happiness
.
``
I
like
it
,
''
he
said
gently
.
*NL*
``
It
makes
me
think
of
things
far
away
,
places
and
*NL*
things
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
Tom
Foster
got
drunk
.
That
came
about
in
a
*NL*
curious
way
.
He
never
had
been
drunk
before
,
and
indeed
*NL*
in
all
his
life
had
never
taken
a
drink
of
anything
*NL*
intoxicating
,
but
he
felt
he
needed
to
be
drunk
that
*NL*
one
time
and
so
went
and
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Cincinnati
,
when
he
lived
there
,
Tom
had
found
out
*NL*
many
things
,
things
about
ugliness
and
crime
and
lust
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
he
knew
more
of
these
things
than
anyone
else
*NL*
in
Winesburg
.
The
matter
of
sex
in
particular
had
*NL*
presented
itself
to
him
in
a
quite
horrible
way
and
had
*NL*
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
.
He
thought
,
after
*NL*
what
he
had
seen
of
the
women
standing
before
the
*NL*
squalid
houses
on
cold
nights
and
the
look
he
had
seen
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
the
men
who
stopped
to
talk
to
them
,
*NL*
that
he
would
put
sex
altogether
out
of
his
own
life
.
*NL*
One
of
the
women
of
the
neighborhood
tempted
him
once
*NL*
and
he
went
into
a
room
with
her
.
He
never
forgot
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
room
nor
the
greedy
look
that
came
into
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
woman
.
It
sickened
him
and
in
a
very
*NL*
terrible
way
left
a
scar
on
his
soul
.
He
had
always
*NL*
before
thought
of
women
as
quite
innocent
things
,
much
*NL*
like
his
grandmother
,
but
after
that
one
experience
in
*NL*
the
room
he
dismissed
women
from
his
mind
.
So
gentle
*NL*
was
his
nature
that
he
could
not
hate
anything
and
not
*NL*
being
able
to
understand
he
decided
to
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Tom
did
forget
until
he
came
to
Winesburg
.
After
he
*NL*
had
lived
there
for
two
years
something
began
to
stir
*NL*
in
him
.
On
all
sides
he
saw
youth
making
love
and
he
*NL*
was
himself
a
youth
.
Before
he
knew
what
had
happened
*NL*
he
was
in
love
also
.
He
fell
in
love
with
Helen
White
,
*NL*
daughter
of
the
man
for
whom
he
had
worked
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
thinking
of
her
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
problem
for
Tom
and
he
settled
it
in
his
own
*NL*
way
.
He
let
himself
think
of
Helen
White
whenever
her
*NL*
figure
came
into
his
mind
and
only
concerned
himself
*NL*
with
the
manner
of
his
thoughts
.
He
had
a
fight
,
a
*NL*
quiet
determined
little
fight
of
his
own
,
to
keep
his
*NL*
desires
in
the
channel
where
he
thought
they
belonged
,
*NL*
but
on
the
whole
he
was
victorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
came
the
spring
night
when
he
got
drunk
.
Tom
*NL*
was
wild
on
that
night
.
He
was
like
an
innocent
young
*NL*
buck
of
the
forest
that
has
eaten
of
some
maddening
*NL*
weed
.
The
thing
began
,
ran
its
course
,
and
was
ended
in
*NL*
one
night
,
and
you
may
be
sure
that
no
one
in
Winesburg
*NL*
was
any
the
worse
for
Tom
's
outbreak
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
the
night
was
one
to
make
a
*NL*
sensitive
nature
drunk
.
The
trees
along
the
residence
*NL*
streets
of
the
town
were
all
newly
clothed
in
soft
*NL*
green
leaves
,
in
the
gardens
behind
the
houses
men
were
*NL*
puttering
about
in
vegetable
gardens
,
and
in
the
air
*NL*
there
was
a
hush
,
a
waiting
kind
of
silence
very
*NL*
stirring
to
the
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
left
his
room
on
Duane
Street
just
as
the
young
*NL*
night
began
to
make
itself
felt
.
First
he
walked
*NL*
through
the
streets
,
going
softly
and
quietly
along
,
*NL*
thinking
thoughts
that
he
tried
to
put
into
words
.
He
*NL*
said
that
Helen
White
was
a
flame
dancing
in
the
air
*NL*
and
that
he
was
a
little
tree
without
leaves
standing
*NL*
out
sharply
against
the
sky
.
Then
he
said
that
she
was
*NL*
a
wind
,
a
strong
terrible
wind
,
coming
out
of
the
*NL*
darkness
of
a
stormy
sea
and
that
he
was
a
boat
left
on
*NL*
the
shore
of
the
sea
by
a
fisherman
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
idea
pleased
the
boy
and
he
sauntered
along
*NL*
playing
with
it
.
He
went
into
Main
Street
and
sat
on
*NL*
the
curbing
before
Wacker
's
tobacco
store
.
For
an
hour
*NL*
he
lingered
about
listening
to
the
talk
of
men
,
but
it
*NL*
did
not
interest
him
much
and
he
slipped
away
.
Then
he
*NL*
decided
to
get
drunk
and
went
into
Willy
's
saloon
and
*NL*
bought
a
bottle
of
whiskey
.
Putting
the
bottle
into
his
*NL*
pocket
,
he
walked
out
of
town
,
wanting
to
be
alone
to
*NL*
think
more
thoughts
and
to
drink
the
whiskey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
drunk
sitting
on
a
bank
of
new
grass
beside
the
*NL*
road
about
a
mile
north
of
town
.
Before
him
was
a
white
*NL*
road
and
at
his
back
an
apple
orchard
in
full
bloom
.
He
*NL*
took
a
drink
out
of
the
bottle
and
then
lay
down
on
the
*NL*
grass
.
He
thought
of
mornings
in
Winesburg
and
of
how
*NL*
the
stones
in
the
graveled
driveway
by
Banker
White
's
*NL*
house
were
wet
with
dew
and
glistened
in
the
morning
*NL*
light
.
He
thought
of
the
nights
in
the
barn
when
it
*NL*
rained
and
he
lay
awake
hearing
the
drumming
of
the
*NL*
raindrops
and
smelling
the
warm
smell
of
horses
and
of
*NL*
hay
.
Then
he
thought
of
a
storm
that
had
gone
roaring
*NL*
through
Winesburg
several
days
before
and
,
his
mind
*NL*
going
back
,
he
relived
the
night
he
had
spent
on
the
*NL*
train
with
his
grandmother
when
the
two
were
coming
*NL*
from
Cincinnati
.
Sharply
he
remembered
how
strange
it
*NL*
had
seemed
to
sit
quietly
in
the
coach
and
to
feel
the
*NL*
power
of
the
engine
hurling
the
train
along
through
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
drunk
in
a
very
short
time
.
He
kept
taking
*NL*
drinks
from
the
bottle
as
the
thoughts
visited
him
and
*NL*
when
his
head
began
to
reel
got
up
and
walked
along
the
*NL*
road
going
away
from
Winesburg
.
There
was
a
bridge
on
*NL*
the
road
that
ran
out
of
Winesburg
north
to
Lake
Erie
*NL*
and
the
drunken
boy
made
his
way
along
the
road
to
the
*NL*
bridge
.
There
he
sat
down
.
He
tried
to
drink
again
,
but
*NL*
when
he
had
taken
the
cork
out
of
the
bottle
he
became
*NL*
ill
and
put
it
quickly
back
.
His
head
was
rocking
back
*NL*
and
forth
and
so
he
sat
on
the
stone
approach
to
the
*NL*
bridge
and
sighed
.
His
head
seemed
to
be
flying
about
*NL*
like
a
pinwheel
and
then
projecting
itself
off
into
*NL*
space
and
his
arms
and
legs
flopped
helplessly
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
Tom
got
back
into
town
.
George
*NL*
Willard
found
him
wandering
about
and
took
him
into
the
*NL*
Eagle
printshop
.
Then
he
became
afraid
that
the
drunken
*NL*
boy
would
make
a
mess
on
the
floor
and
helped
him
into
*NL*
the
alleyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reporter
was
confused
by
Tom
Foster
.
The
drunken
*NL*
boy
talked
of
Helen
White
and
said
he
had
been
with
her
*NL*
on
the
shore
of
a
sea
and
had
made
love
to
her
.
George
*NL*
had
seen
Helen
White
walking
in
the
street
with
her
*NL*
father
during
the
evening
and
decided
that
Tom
was
out
*NL*
of
his
head
.
A
sentiment
concerning
Helen
White
that
*NL*
lurked
in
his
own
heart
flamed
up
and
he
became
angry
.
*NL*
``
Now
you
quit
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
wo
n't
let
Helen
*NL*
White
's
name
be
dragged
into
this
.
I
wo
n't
let
that
*NL*
happen
.
''
He
began
shaking
Tom
's
shoulder
,
trying
to
*NL*
make
him
understand
.
``
You
quit
it
,
''
he
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
hours
the
two
young
men
,
thus
strangely
*NL*
thrown
together
,
stayed
in
the
printshop
.
When
he
had
a
*NL*
little
recovered
George
took
Tom
for
a
walk
.
They
went
*NL*
into
the
country
and
sat
on
a
log
near
the
edge
of
a
*NL*
wood
.
Something
in
the
still
night
drew
them
together
*NL*
and
when
the
drunken
boy
's
head
began
to
clear
they
*NL*
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
good
to
be
drunk
,
''
Tom
Foster
said
.
``
It
taught
*NL*
me
something
.
I
wo
n't
have
to
do
it
again
.
I
will
think
*NL*
more
dearly
after
this
.
You
see
how
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
did
not
see
,
but
his
anger
concerning
*NL*
Helen
White
passed
and
he
felt
drawn
toward
the
pale
,
*NL*
shaken
boy
as
he
had
never
before
been
drawn
toward
*NL*
anyone
.
With
motherly
solicitude
,
he
insisted
that
Tom
*NL*
get
to
his
feet
and
walk
about
.
Again
they
went
back
to
*NL*
the
printshop
and
sat
in
silence
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reporter
could
not
get
the
purpose
of
Tom
Foster
's
*NL*
action
straightened
out
in
his
mind
.
When
Tom
spoke
*NL*
again
of
Helen
White
he
again
grew
angry
and
began
to
*NL*
scold
.
``
You
quit
that
,
''
he
said
sharply
.
``
You
have
n't
*NL*
been
with
her
.
What
makes
you
say
you
have
?
What
makes
*NL*
you
keep
saying
such
things
?
Now
you
quit
it
,
do
you
*NL*
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
hurt
.
He
could
n't
quarrel
with
George
Willard
*NL*
because
he
was
incapable
of
quarreling
,
so
he
got
up
to
*NL*
go
away
.
When
George
Willard
was
insistent
he
put
out
*NL*
his
hand
,
laying
it
on
the
older
boy
's
arm
,
and
tried
*NL*
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
softly
,
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
.
I
was
*NL*
happy
.
You
see
how
that
was
.
Helen
White
made
me
happy
*NL*
and
the
night
did
too
.
I
wanted
to
suffer
,
to
be
hurt
*NL*
somehow
.
I
thought
that
was
what
I
should
do
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
suffer
,
you
see
,
because
everyone
suffers
and
does
*NL*
wrong
.
I
thought
of
a
lot
of
things
to
do
,
but
they
*NL*
would
n't
work
.
They
all
hurt
someone
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Foster
's
voice
arose
,
and
for
once
in
his
life
he
*NL*
became
almost
excited
.
``
It
was
like
making
love
,
that
's
*NL*
what
I
mean
,
''
he
explained
.
``
Do
n't
you
see
how
it
is
?
*NL*
It
hurt
me
to
do
what
I
did
and
made
everything
*NL*
strange
.
That
's
why
I
did
it
.
I
'm
glad
,
too
.
It
taught
*NL*
me
something
,
that
's
it
,
that
's
what
I
wanted
.
Do
n't
*NL*
you
understand
?
I
wanted
to
learn
things
,
you
see
.
*NL*
That
's
why
I
did
it
.

DEATH
*NL*
*NL*
The
stairway
leading
up
to
Doctor
Reefy
's
office
,
in
*NL*
the
Heffner
Block
above
the
Paris
Dry
Goods
store
,
was
*NL*
but
dimly
lighted
.
At
the
head
of
the
stairway
hung
a
*NL*
lamp
with
a
dirty
chimney
that
was
fastened
by
a
*NL*
bracket
to
the
wall
.
The
lamp
had
a
tin
reflector
,
*NL*
brown
with
rust
and
covered
with
dust
.
The
people
who
*NL*
went
up
the
stairway
followed
with
their
feet
the
feet
*NL*
of
many
who
had
gone
before
.
The
soft
boards
of
the
*NL*
stairs
had
yielded
under
the
pressure
of
feet
and
deep
*NL*
hollows
marked
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
top
of
the
stairway
a
turn
to
the
right
brought
*NL*
you
to
the
doctor
's
door
.
To
the
left
was
a
dark
*NL*
hallway
filled
with
rubbish
.
Old
chairs
,
carpenter
's
*NL*
horses
,
step
ladders
and
empty
boxes
lay
in
the
*NL*
darkness
waiting
for
shins
to
be
barked
.
The
pile
of
*NL*
rubbish
belonged
to
the
Paris
Dry
Goods
Company
.
When
a
*NL*
counter
or
a
row
of
shelves
in
the
store
became
*NL*
useless
,
clerks
carried
it
up
the
stairway
and
threw
it
*NL*
on
the
pile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Reefy
's
office
was
as
large
as
a
barn
.
A
stove
*NL*
with
a
round
paunch
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
*NL*
Around
its
base
was
piled
sawdust
,
held
in
place
by
*NL*
heavy
planks
nailed
to
the
floor
.
By
the
door
stood
a
*NL*
huge
table
that
had
once
been
a
part
of
the
furniture
*NL*
of
Herrick
's
Clothing
Store
and
that
had
been
used
for
*NL*
displaying
custom-made
clothes
.
It
was
covered
with
*NL*
books
,
bottles
,
and
surgical
instruments
.
Near
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
table
lay
three
or
four
apples
left
by
John
*NL*
Spaniard
,
a
tree
nurseryman
who
was
Doctor
Reefy
's
*NL*
friend
,
and
who
had
slipped
the
apples
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
middle
age
Doctor
Reefy
was
tall
and
awkward
.
The
*NL*
grey
beard
he
later
wore
had
not
yet
appeared
,
but
on
*NL*
the
upper
lip
grew
a
brown
mustache
.
He
was
not
a
*NL*
graceful
man
,
as
when
he
grew
older
,
and
was
much
*NL*
occupied
with
the
problem
of
disposing
of
his
hands
and
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
summer
afternoons
,
when
she
had
been
married
many
*NL*
years
and
when
her
son
George
was
a
boy
of
twelve
or
*NL*
fourteen
,
Elizabeth
Willard
sometimes
went
up
the
worn
*NL*
steps
to
Doctor
Reefy
's
office
.
Already
the
woman
's
*NL*
naturally
tall
figure
had
begun
to
droop
and
to
drag
*NL*
itself
listlessly
about
.
Ostensibly
she
went
to
see
the
*NL*
doctor
because
of
her
health
,
but
on
the
half
dozen
*NL*
occasions
when
she
had
been
to
see
him
the
outcome
of
*NL*
the
visits
did
not
primarily
concern
her
health
.
She
*NL*
and
the
doctor
talked
of
that
but
they
talked
most
of
*NL*
her
life
,
of
their
two
lives
and
of
the
ideas
that
had
*NL*
come
to
them
as
they
lived
their
lives
in
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
big
empty
office
the
man
and
the
woman
sat
*NL*
looking
at
each
other
and
they
were
a
good
deal
alike
.
*NL*
Their
bodies
were
different
,
as
were
also
the
color
of
*NL*
their
eyes
,
the
length
of
their
noses
,
and
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
their
existence
,
but
something
inside
*NL*
them
meant
the
same
thing
,
wanted
the
same
release
,
*NL*
would
have
left
the
same
impression
on
the
memory
of
an
*NL*
onlooker
.
Later
,
and
when
he
grew
older
and
married
a
*NL*
young
wife
,
the
doctor
often
talked
to
her
of
the
hours
*NL*
spent
with
the
sick
woman
and
expressed
a
good
many
*NL*
things
he
had
been
unable
to
express
to
Elizabeth
.
He
*NL*
was
almost
a
poet
in
his
old
age
and
his
notion
of
what
*NL*
happened
took
a
poetic
turn
.
``
I
had
come
to
the
time
in
*NL*
my
life
when
prayer
became
necessary
and
so
I
invented
*NL*
gods
and
prayed
to
them
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
did
not
say
my
*NL*
prayers
in
words
nor
did
I
kneel
down
but
sat
perfectly
*NL*
still
in
my
chair
.
In
the
late
afternoon
when
it
was
*NL*
hot
and
quiet
on
Main
Street
or
in
the
winter
when
the
*NL*
days
were
gloomy
,
the
gods
came
into
the
office
and
I
*NL*
thought
no
one
knew
about
them
.
Then
I
found
that
this
*NL*
woman
Elizabeth
knew
,
that
she
worshipped
also
the
same
*NL*
gods
.
I
have
a
notion
that
she
came
to
the
office
*NL*
because
she
thought
the
gods
would
be
there
but
she
was
*NL*
happy
to
find
herself
not
alone
just
the
same
.
It
was
*NL*
an
experience
that
can
not
be
explained
,
although
I
*NL*
suppose
it
is
always
happening
to
men
and
women
in
all
*NL*
sorts
of
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
summer
afternoons
when
Elizabeth
and
the
doctor
*NL*
sat
in
the
office
and
talked
of
their
two
lives
they
*NL*
talked
of
other
lives
also
.
Sometimes
the
doctor
made
*NL*
philosophic
epigrams
.
Then
he
chuckled
with
amusement
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
after
a
period
of
silence
,
a
word
was
said
*NL*
or
a
hint
given
that
strangely
illuminated
the
life
of
*NL*
the
speaker
,
a
wish
became
a
desire
,
or
a
dream
,
half
*NL*
dead
,
flared
suddenly
into
life
.
For
the
most
part
the
*NL*
words
came
from
the
woman
and
she
said
them
without
*NL*
looking
at
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
she
came
to
see
the
doctor
the
hotel
keeper
's
*NL*
wife
talked
a
little
more
freely
and
after
an
hour
or
*NL*
two
in
his
presence
went
down
the
stairway
into
Main
*NL*
Street
feeling
renewed
and
strengthened
against
the
*NL*
dullness
of
her
days
.
With
something
approaching
a
*NL*
girlhood
swing
to
her
body
she
walked
along
,
but
when
*NL*
she
had
got
back
to
her
chair
by
the
window
of
her
room
*NL*
and
when
darkness
had
come
on
and
a
girl
from
the
hotel
*NL*
dining
room
brought
her
dinner
on
a
tray
,
she
let
it
*NL*
grow
cold
.
Her
thoughts
ran
away
to
her
girlhood
with
*NL*
its
passionate
longing
for
adventure
and
she
remembered
*NL*
the
arms
of
men
that
had
held
her
when
adventure
was
a
*NL*
possible
thing
for
her
.
Particularly
she
remembered
one
*NL*
who
had
for
a
time
been
her
lover
and
who
in
the
moment
*NL*
of
his
passion
had
cried
out
to
her
more
than
a
hundred
*NL*
times
,
saying
the
same
words
madly
over
and
over
:
``
You
*NL*
dear
!
You
dear
!
You
lovely
dear
!
''
The
words
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
expressed
something
she
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
have
achieved
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
room
in
the
shabby
old
hotel
the
sick
wife
of
*NL*
the
hotel
keeper
began
to
weep
and
,
putting
her
hands
*NL*
to
her
face
,
rocked
back
and
forth
.
The
words
of
her
*NL*
one
friend
,
Doctor
Reefy
,
rang
in
her
ears
.
``
Love
is
*NL*
like
a
wind
stirring
the
grass
beneath
trees
on
a
black
*NL*
night
,
''
he
had
said
.
``
You
must
not
try
to
make
love
*NL*
definite
.
It
is
the
divine
accident
of
life
.
If
you
try
*NL*
to
be
definite
and
sure
about
it
and
to
live
beneath
*NL*
the
trees
,
where
soft
night
winds
blow
,
the
long
hot
*NL*
day
of
disappointment
comes
swiftly
and
the
gritty
dust
*NL*
from
passing
wagons
gathers
upon
lips
inflamed
and
made
*NL*
tender
by
kisses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
Willard
could
not
remember
her
mother
who
had
*NL*
died
when
she
was
but
five
years
old
.
Her
girlhood
had
*NL*
been
lived
in
the
most
haphazard
manner
imaginable
.
Her
*NL*
father
was
a
man
who
had
wanted
to
be
let
alone
and
the
*NL*
affairs
of
the
hotel
would
not
let
him
alone
.
He
also
*NL*
had
lived
and
died
a
sick
man
.
Every
day
he
arose
with
*NL*
a
cheerful
face
,
but
by
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
all
*NL*
the
joy
had
gone
out
of
his
heart
.
When
a
guest
*NL*
complained
of
the
fare
in
the
hotel
dining
room
or
one
*NL*
of
the
girls
who
made
up
the
beds
got
married
and
went
*NL*
away
,
he
stamped
on
the
floor
and
swore
.
At
night
when
*NL*
he
went
to
bed
he
thought
of
his
daughter
growing
up
*NL*
among
the
stream
of
people
that
drifted
in
and
out
of
*NL*
the
hotel
and
was
overcome
with
sadness
.
As
the
girl
*NL*
grew
older
and
began
to
walk
out
in
the
evening
with
*NL*
men
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
,
but
when
he
tried
was
not
*NL*
successful
.
He
always
forgot
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
*NL*
spent
the
time
complaining
of
his
own
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
girlhood
and
young
womanhood
Elizabeth
had
tried
*NL*
to
be
a
real
adventurer
in
life
.
At
eighteen
life
had
*NL*
so
gripped
her
that
she
was
no
longer
a
virgin
but
,
*NL*
although
she
had
a
half
dozen
lovers
before
she
married
*NL*
Tom
Willard
,
she
had
never
entered
upon
an
adventure
*NL*
prompted
by
desire
alone
.
Like
all
the
women
in
the
*NL*
world
,
she
wanted
a
real
lover
.
Always
there
was
*NL*
something
she
sought
blindly
,
passionately
,
some
hidden
*NL*
wonder
in
life
.
The
tall
beautiful
girl
with
the
*NL*
swinging
stride
who
had
walked
under
the
trees
with
men
*NL*
was
forever
putting
out
her
hand
into
the
darkness
and
*NL*
trying
to
get
hold
of
some
other
hand
.
In
all
the
*NL*
babble
of
words
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
men
with
*NL*
whom
she
adventured
she
was
trying
to
find
what
would
*NL*
be
for
her
the
true
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
had
married
Tom
Willard
,
a
clerk
in
her
*NL*
father
's
hotel
,
because
he
was
at
hand
and
wanted
to
*NL*
marry
at
the
time
when
the
determination
to
marry
came
*NL*
to
her
.
For
a
while
,
like
most
young
girls
,
she
thought
*NL*
marriage
would
change
the
face
of
life
.
If
there
was
in
*NL*
her
mind
a
doubt
of
the
outcome
of
the
marriage
with
*NL*
Tom
she
brushed
it
aside
.
Her
father
was
ill
and
near
*NL*
death
at
the
time
and
she
was
perplexed
because
of
the
*NL*
meaningless
outcome
of
an
affair
in
which
she
had
just
*NL*
been
involved
.
Other
girls
of
her
age
in
Winesburg
were
*NL*
marrying
men
she
had
always
known
,
grocery
clerks
or
*NL*
young
farmers
.
In
the
evening
they
walked
in
Main
*NL*
Street
with
their
husbands
and
when
she
passed
they
*NL*
smiled
happily
.
She
began
to
think
that
the
fact
of
*NL*
marriage
might
be
full
of
some
hidden
significance
.
*NL*
Young
wives
with
whom
she
talked
spoke
softly
and
*NL*
shyly
.
``
It
changes
things
to
have
a
man
of
your
own
,
''
*NL*
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
before
her
marriage
the
perplexed
girl
*NL*
had
a
talk
with
her
father
.
Later
she
wondered
if
the
*NL*
hours
alone
with
the
sick
man
had
not
led
to
her
*NL*
decision
to
marry
.
The
father
talked
of
his
life
and
*NL*
advised
the
daughter
to
avoid
being
led
into
another
*NL*
such
muddle
.
He
abused
Tom
Willard
,
and
that
led
*NL*
Elizabeth
to
come
to
the
clerk
's
defense
.
The
sick
man
*NL*
became
excited
and
tried
to
get
out
of
bed
.
When
she
*NL*
would
not
let
him
walk
about
he
began
to
complain
.
*NL*
``
I
've
never
been
let
alone
,
''
he
said
.
``
Although
I
've
*NL*
worked
hard
I
've
not
made
the
hotel
pay
.
Even
now
I
owe
*NL*
money
at
the
bank
.
You
'll
find
that
out
when
I
'm
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
sick
man
became
tense
with
*NL*
earnestness
.
Being
unable
to
arise
,
he
put
out
his
hand
*NL*
and
pulled
the
girl
's
head
down
beside
his
own
.
*NL*
``
There
's
a
way
out
,
''
he
whispered
.
``
Do
n't
marry
Tom
*NL*
Willard
or
anyone
else
here
in
Winesburg
.
There
is
*NL*
eight
hundred
dollars
in
a
tin
box
in
my
trunk
.
Take
it
*NL*
and
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
sick
man
's
voice
became
querulous
.
``
You
've
*NL*
got
to
promise
,
''
he
declared
.
``
If
you
wo
n't
promise
not
*NL*
to
marry
,
give
me
your
word
that
you
'll
never
tell
Tom

about
the
money

It
is
mine
and
if
I
give
it
to
you
*NL*
I
've
the
right
to
make
that
demand
.
Hide
it
away

It
is
*NL*
to
make
up
to
you
for
my
failure
as
a
father

Some
time
*NL*
it
may
prove
to
be
a
door
,
a
great
open
door
to
you

Come
now

I

you
I
'm
about

die
,
give
me
your
*NL*
promise

In
Doctor
Reefy
's
office
,
Elizabeth
,
a
tired
gaunt
old
*NL*
woman
at
forty-one
,
sat
in
a
chair
near
the
stove
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
floor
.
By
a
small
desk
near
the
window
*NL*
sat
the
doctor
.
His
hands
played
with
a
lead
pencil
*NL*
that
lay
on
the
desk
.
Elizabeth
talked
of
her
life
as
a
*NL*
married
woman
.
She
became
impersonal
and
forgot
her
*NL*
husband
,
only
using
him
as
a
lay
figure
to
give
point
*NL*
to
her
tale
.
``
And
then
I
was
married
and
it
did
not
*NL*
turn
out
at
all
,
''
she
said
bitterly
.
``
As
soon
as
I
had
*NL*
gone
into
it
I
began
to
be
afraid
.
Perhaps
I
knew
too
*NL*
much
before
and
then
perhaps
I
found
out
too
much
*NL*
during
my
first
night
with
him
.
I
do
n't
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fool
I
was
.
When
father
gave
me
the
money
and
*NL*
tried
to
talk
me
out
of
the
thought
of
marriage
,
I
*NL*
would
not
listen
.
I
thought
of
what
the
girls
who
were
*NL*
married
had
said
of
it
and
I
wanted
marriage
also
.
It
*NL*
was
n't
Tom
I
wanted
,
it
was
marriage
.
When
father
went
*NL*
to
sleep
I
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
thought
of
the
*NL*
life
I
had
led
.
I
did
n't
want
to
be
a
bad
woman
.
The
*NL*
town
was
full
of
stories
about
me
.
I
even
began
to
be
*NL*
afraid
Tom
would
change
his
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
voice
began
to
quiver
with
excitement
.
To
*NL*
Doctor
Reefy
,
who
without
realizing
what
was
happening
*NL*
had
begun
to
love
her
,
there
came
an
odd
illusion
.
He
*NL*
thought
that
as
she
talked
the
woman
's
body
was
*NL*
changing
,
that
she
was
becoming
younger
,
straighter
,
*NL*
stronger
.
When
he
could
not
shake
off
the
illusion
his
*NL*
mind
gave
it
a
professional
twist
.
``
It
is
good
for
both
*NL*
her
body
and
her
mind
,
this
talking
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
began
telling
of
an
incident
that
had
*NL*
happened
one
afternoon
a
few
months
after
her
marriage
.
*NL*
Her
voice
became
steadier
.
``
In
the
late
afternoon
I
*NL*
went
for
a
drive
alone
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
had
a
buggy
and
a
*NL*
little
grey
pony
I
kept
in
Moyer
's
Livery
.
Tom
was
*NL*
painting
and
repapering
rooms
in
the
hotel
.
He
wanted
*NL*
money
and
I
was
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
him
*NL*
about
the
eight
hundred
dollars
father
had
given
to
me
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
decide
to
do
it
.
I
did
n't
like
him
well
*NL*
enough
.
There
was
always
paint
on
his
hands
and
face
*NL*
during
those
days
and
he
smelled
of
paint
.
He
was
*NL*
trying
to
fix
up
the
old
hotel
,
and
make
it
new
and
*NL*
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
woman
sat
up
very
straight
in
her
chair
and
*NL*
made
a
quick
girlish
movement
with
her
hand
as
she
told
*NL*
of
the
drive
alone
on
the
spring
afternoon
.
``
It
was
*NL*
cloudy
and
a
storm
threatened
,
''
she
said
.
``
Black
clouds
*NL*
made
the
green
of
the
trees
and
the
grass
stand
out
so
*NL*
that
the
colors
hurt
my
eyes
.
I
went
out
Trunion
Pike
a
*NL*
mile
or
more
and
then
turned
into
a
side
road
.
The
*NL*
little
horse
went
quickly
along
up
hill
and
down
.
I
was
*NL*
impatient
.
Thoughts
came
and
I
wanted
to
get
away
from
*NL*
my
thoughts
.
I
began
to
beat
the
horse
.
The
black
*NL*
clouds
settled
down
and
it
began
to
rain
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
go
at
a
terrible
speed
,
to
drive
on
and
on
forever
.
I
*NL*
wanted
to
get
out
of
town
,
out
of
my
clothes
,
out
of
my
*NL*
marriage
,
out
of
my
body
,
out
of
everything
.
I
almost
*NL*
killed
the
horse
,
making
him
run
,
and
when
he
could
not
*NL*
run
any
more
I
got
out
of
the
buggy
and
ran
afoot
into
*NL*
the
darkness
until
I
fell
and
hurt
my
side
.
I
wanted
to
*NL*
run
away
from
everything
but
I
wanted
to
run
towards
*NL*
something
too
.
Do
n't
you
see
,
dear
,
how
it
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
sprang
out
of
the
chair
and
began
to
walk
*NL*
about
in
the
office
.
She
walked
as
Doctor
Reefy
thought
*NL*
he
had
never
seen
anyone
walk
before
.
To
her
whole
body
*NL*
there
was
a
swing
,
a
rhythm
that
intoxicated
him
.
When
*NL*
she
came
and
knelt
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
he
*NL*
took
her
into
his
arms
and
began
to
kiss
her
*NL*
passionately
.
``
I
cried
all
the
way
home
,
''
she
said
,
as
*NL*
she
tried
to
continue
the
story
of
her
wild
ride
,
but
*NL*
he
did
not
listen
.
``
You
dear
!
You
lovely
dear
!
Oh
you
*NL*
lovely
dear
!
''
he
muttered
and
thought
he
held
in
his
*NL*
arms
not
the
tired-out
woman
of
forty-one
but
a
lovely
*NL*
and
innocent
girl
who
had
been
able
by
some
miracle
to
*NL*
project
herself
out
of
the
husk
of
the
body
of
the
*NL*
tired-out
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Reefy
did
not
see
the
woman
he
had
held
in
his
*NL*
arms
again
until
after
her
death
.
On
the
summer
*NL*
afternoon
in
the
office
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
becoming
her
lover
a
half
grotesque
little
incident
*NL*
brought
his
love-making
quickly
to
an
end
.
As
the
man
*NL*
and
woman
held
each
other
tightly
heavy
feet
came
*NL*
tramping
up
the
office
stairs
.
The
two
sprang
to
their
*NL*
feet
and
stood
listening
and
trembling
.
The
noise
on
*NL*
the
stairs
was
made
by
a
clerk
from
the
Paris
Dry
Goods
*NL*
Company
.
With
a
loud
bang
he
threw
an
empty
box
on
the
*NL*
pile
of
rubbish
in
the
hallway
and
then
went
heavily
*NL*
down
the
stairs
.
Elizabeth
followed
him
almost
*NL*
immediately
.
The
thing
that
had
come
to
life
in
her
as
*NL*
she
talked
to
her
one
friend
died
suddenly
.
She
was
*NL*
hysterical
,
as
was
also
Doctor
Reefy
,
and
did
not
want
*NL*
to
continue
the
talk
.
Along
the
street
she
went
with
*NL*
the
blood
still
singing
in
her
body
,
but
when
she
*NL*
turned
out
of
Main
Street
and
saw
ahead
the
lights
of
*NL*
the
New
Willard
House
,
she
began
to
tremble
and
her
*NL*
knees
shook
so
that
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
would
*NL*
fall
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
woman
spent
the
last
few
months
of
her
life
*NL*
hungering
for
death
.
Along
the
road
of
death
she
went
,
*NL*
seeking
,
hungering
.
She
personified
the
figure
of
death
*NL*
and
made
him
now
a
strong
black-haired
youth
running
*NL*
over
hills
,
now
a
stern
quiet
man
marked
and
scarred
by
*NL*
the
business
of
living
.
In
the
darkness
of
her
room
she
*NL*
put
out
her
hand
,
thrusting
it
from
under
the
covers
of
*NL*
her
bed
,
and
she
thought
that
death
like
a
living
thing
*NL*
put
out
his
hand
to
her
.
``
Be
patient
,
lover
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
.
``
Keep
yourself
young
and
beautiful
and
be
*NL*
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
when
disease
laid
its
heavy
hand
upon
*NL*
her
and
defeated
her
plans
for
telling
her
son
George
*NL*
of
the
eight
hundred
dollars
hidden
away
,
she
got
out
*NL*
of
bed
and
crept
half
across
the
room
pleading
with
*NL*
death
for
another
hour
of
life
.
``
Wait
,
dear
!
The
boy
!
*NL*
The
boy
!
The
boy
!
''
she
pleaded
as
she
tried
with
all
of
*NL*
her
strength
to
fight
off
the
arms
of
the
lover
she
had
*NL*
wanted
so
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
died
one
day
in
March
in
the
year
when
her
*NL*
son
George
became
eighteen
,
and
the
young
man
had
but
*NL*
little
sense
of
the
meaning
of
her
death
.
Only
time
*NL*
could
give
him
that
.
For
a
month
he
had
seen
her
lying
*NL*
white
and
still
and
speechless
in
her
bed
,
and
then
one
*NL*
afternoon
the
doctor
stopped
him
in
the
hallway
and
*NL*
said
a
few
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
went
into
his
own
room
and
closed
the
*NL*
door
.
He
had
a
queer
empty
feeling
in
the
region
of
his
*NL*
stomach
.
For
a
moment
he
sat
staring
at
,
the
floor
and
*NL*
then
jumping
up
went
for
a
walk
.
Along
the
station
*NL*
platform
he
went
,
and
around
through
residence
streets
*NL*
past
the
high-school
building
,
thinking
almost
entirely
*NL*
of
his
own
affairs
.
The
notion
of
death
could
not
get
*NL*
hold
of
him
and
he
was
in
fact
a
little
annoyed
that
*NL*
his
mother
had
died
on
that
day
.
He
had
just
received
a
*NL*
note
from
Helen
White
,
the
daughter
of
the
town
banker
,
*NL*
in
answer
to
one
from
him
.
``
Tonight
I
could
have
gone
*NL*
to
see
her
and
now
it
will
have
to
be
put
off
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
half
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elizabeth
died
on
a
Friday
afternoon
at
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
It
had
been
cold
and
rainy
in
the
morning
but
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
the
sun
came
out
.
Before
she
died
she
lay
*NL*
paralyzed
for
six
days
unable
to
speak
or
move
and
with
*NL*
only
her
mind
and
her
eyes
alive
.
For
three
of
the
six
*NL*
days
she
struggled
,
thinking
of
her
boy
,
trying
to
say
*NL*
some
few
words
in
regard
to
his
future
,
and
in
her
eyes
*NL*
there
was
an
appeal
so
touching
that
all
who
saw
it
*NL*
kept
the
memory
of
the
dying
woman
in
their
minds
for
*NL*
years
.
Even
Tom
Willard
,
who
had
always
half
resented
*NL*
his
wife
,
forgot
his
resentment
and
the
tears
ran
out
*NL*
of
his
eyes
and
lodged
in
his
mustache
.
The
mustache
*NL*
had
begun
to
turn
grey
and
Tom
colored
it
with
dye
.
*NL*
There
was
oil
in
the
preparation
he
used
for
the
*NL*
purpose
and
the
tears
,
catching
in
the
mustache
and
*NL*
being
brushed
away
by
his
hand
,
formed
a
fine
mist-like
*NL*
vapor
.
In
his
grief
Tom
Willard
's
face
looked
like
the
*NL*
face
of
a
little
dog
that
has
been
out
a
long
time
in
*NL*
bitter
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
came
home
along
Main
Street
at
dark
on
the
day
*NL*
of
his
mother
's
death
and
,
after
going
to
his
own
room
*NL*
to
brush
his
hair
and
clothes
,
went
along
the
hallway
*NL*
and
into
the
room
where
the
body
lay
.
There
was
a
*NL*
candle
on
the
dressing
table
by
the
door
and
Doctor
*NL*
Reefy
sat
in
a
chair
by
the
bed
.
The
doctor
arose
and
*NL*
started
to
go
out
.
He
put
out
his
hand
as
though
to
*NL*
greet
the
younger
man
and
then
awkwardly
drew
it
back
*NL*
again
.
The
air
of
the
room
was
heavy
with
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
two
self-conscious
human
beings
,
and
the
man
*NL*
hurried
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dead
woman
's
son
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
looked
at
*NL*
the
floor
.
He
again
thought
of
his
own
affairs
and
*NL*
definitely
decided
he
would
make
a
change
in
his
life
,
*NL*
that
he
would
leave
Winesburg
.
``
I
will
go
to
some
city
.
*NL*
Perhaps
I
can
get
a
job
on
some
newspaper
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
and
then
his
mind
turned
to
the
girl
with
whom
he
was
*NL*
to
have
spent
this
evening
and
again
he
was
half
angry
*NL*
at
the
turn
of
events
that
had
prevented
his
going
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dimly
lighted
room
with
the
dead
woman
the
young
*NL*
man
began
to
have
thoughts
.
His
mind
played
with
*NL*
thoughts
of
life
as
his
mother
's
mind
had
played
with
*NL*
the
thought
of
death
.
He
closed
his
eyes
and
imagined
*NL*
that
the
red
young
lips
of
Helen
White
touched
his
own
*NL*
lips
.
His
body
trembled
and
his
hands
shook
.
And
then
*NL*
something
happened
.
The
boy
sprang
to
his
feet
and
*NL*
stood
stiffly
.
He
looked
at
the
figure
of
the
dead
*NL*
woman
under
the
sheets
and
shame
for
his
thoughts
swept
*NL*
over
him
so
that
he
began
to
weep
.
A
new
notion
came
*NL*
into
his
mind
and
he
turned
and
looked
guiltily
about
*NL*
as
though
afraid
he
would
be
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
became
possessed
of
a
madness
to
lift
*NL*
the
sheet
from
the
body
of
his
mother
and
look
at
her
*NL*
face
.
The
thought
that
had
come
into
his
mind
gripped
*NL*
him
terribly
.
He
became
convinced
that
not
his
mother
*NL*
but
someone
else
lay
in
the
bed
before
him
.
The
*NL*
conviction
was
so
real
that
it
was
almost
unbearable
.
*NL*
The
body
under
the
sheets
was
long
and
in
death
looked
*NL*
young
and
graceful
.
To
the
boy
,
held
by
some
strange
*NL*
fancy
,
it
was
unspeakably
lovely
.
The
feeling
that
the
*NL*
body
before
him
was
alive
,
that
in
another
moment
a
*NL*
lovely
woman
would
spring
out
of
the
bed
and
confront
*NL*
him
,
became
so
overpowering
that
he
could
not
bear
the
*NL*
suspense
.
Again
and
again
he
put
out
his
hand
.
Once
he
*NL*
touched
and
half
lifted
the
white
sheet
that
covered
*NL*
her
,
but
his
courage
failed
and
he
,
like
Doctor
Reefy
,
*NL*
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
In
the
hallway
outside
*NL*
the
door
he
stopped
and
trembled
so
that
he
had
to
put
*NL*
a
hand
against
the
wall
to
support
himself
.
``
That
's
not
*NL*
my
mother
.
That
's
not
my
mother
in
there
,
''
he
whispered
*NL*
to
himself
and
again
his
body
shook
with
fright
and
*NL*
uncertainty
.
When
Aunt
Elizabeth
Swift
,
who
had
come
to
*NL*
watch
over
the
body
,
came
out
of
an
adjoining
room
he
*NL*
put
his
hand
into
hers
and
began
to
sob
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
from
side
to
side
,
half
blind
with
grief
.
``
My
*NL*
mother
is
dead
,
''
he
said
,
and
then
forgetting
the
woman
*NL*
he
turned
and
stared
at
the
door
through
which
he
had
*NL*
just
come
.
``
The
dear
,
the
dear
,
oh
the
lovely
dear
,
''
*NL*
the
boy
,
urged
by
some
impulse
outside
himself
,
*NL*
muttered
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
eight
hundred
dollars
the
dead
woman
had
*NL*
kept
hidden
so
long
and
that
was
to
give
George
Willard
*NL*
his
start
in
the
city
,
it
lay
in
the
tin
box
behind
the
*NL*
plaster
by
the
foot
of
his
mother
's
bed
.
Elizabeth
had
*NL*
put
it
there
a
week
after
her
marriage
,
breaking
the
*NL*
plaster
away
with
a
stick
.
Then
she
got
one
of
the
*NL*
workmen
her
husband
was
at
that
time
employing
about
*NL*
the
hotel
to
mend
the
wall
.
``
I
jammed
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
bed
against
it
,
''
she
had
explained
to
her
husband
,
*NL*
unable
at
the
moment
to
give
up
her
dream
of
release
,
*NL*
the
release
that
after
all
came
to
her
but
twice
in
her
*NL*
life
,
in
the
moments
when
her
lovers
Death
and
Doctor
*NL*
Reefy
held
her
in
their
arms
.

SOPHISTICATION
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
early
evening
of
a
day
in
the
late
fall
and
the
*NL*
Winesburg
County
Fair
had
brought
crowds
of
country
*NL*
people
into
town
.
The
day
had
been
clear
and
the
night
*NL*
came
on
warm
and
pleasant
.
On
the
Trunion
Pike
,
where
*NL*
the
road
after
it
left
town
stretched
away
between
*NL*
berry
fields
now
covered
with
dry
brown
leaves
,
the
*NL*
dust
from
passing
wagons
arose
in
clouds
.
Children
,
*NL*
curled
into
little
balls
,
slept
on
the
straw
scattered
*NL*
on
wagon
beds
.
Their
hair
was
full
of
dust
and
their
*NL*
fingers
black
and
sticky
.
The
dust
rolled
away
over
the
*NL*
fields
and
the
departing
sun
set
it
ablaze
with
colors
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
main
street
of
Winesburg
crowds
filled
the
*NL*
stores
and
the
sidewalks
.
Night
came
on
,
horses
*NL*
whinnied
,
the
clerks
in
the
stores
ran
madly
about
,
*NL*
children
became
lost
and
cried
lustily
,
an
American
*NL*
town
worked
terribly
at
the
task
of
amusing
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pushing
his
way
through
the
crowds
in
Main
Street
,
*NL*
young
George
Willard
concealed
himself
in
the
stairway
*NL*
leading
to
Doctor
Reefy
's
office
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
people
.
With
feverish
eyes
he
watched
the
faces
*NL*
drifting
past
under
the
store
lights
.
Thoughts
kept
*NL*
coming
into
his
head
and
he
did
not
want
to
think
.
He
*NL*
stamped
impatiently
on
the
wooden
steps
and
looked
*NL*
sharply
about
.
``
Well
,
is
she
going
to
stay
with
him
all
*NL*
day
?
Have
I
done
all
this
waiting
for
nothing
?
''
he
*NL*
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Willard
,
the
Ohio
village
boy
,
was
fast
growing
*NL*
into
manhood
and
new
thoughts
had
been
coming
into
his
*NL*
mind
.
All
that
day
,
amid
the
jam
of
people
at
the
Fair
,
*NL*
he
had
gone
about
feeling
lonely
.
He
was
about
to
leave
*NL*
Winesburg
to
go
away
to
some
city
where
he
hoped
to
get
*NL*
work
on
a
city
newspaper
and
he
felt
grown
up
.
The
mood
*NL*
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
was
a
thing
known
to
*NL*
men
and
unknown
to
boys
.
He
felt
old
and
a
little
*NL*
tired
.
Memories
awoke
in
him
.
To
his
mind
his
new
sense
*NL*
of
maturity
set
him
apart
,
made
of
him
a
half-tragic
*NL*
figure
.
He
wanted
someone
to
understand
the
feeling
*NL*
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
after
his
mother
's
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
time
in
the
life
of
every
boy
when
he
for
*NL*
the
first
time
takes
the
backward
view
of
life
.
Perhaps
*NL*
that
is
the
moment
when
he
crosses
the
line
into
*NL*
manhood
.
The
boy
is
walking
through
the
street
of
his
*NL*
town
.
He
is
thinking
of
the
future
and
of
the
figure
he
*NL*
will
cut
in
the
world
.
Ambitions
and
regrets
awake
*NL*
within
him
.
Suddenly
something
happens
;
he
stops
under
*NL*
a
tree
and
waits
as
for
a
voice
calling
his
name
.
*NL*
Ghosts
of
old
things
creep
into
his
consciousness
;
the
*NL*
voices
outside
of
himself
whisper
a
message
concerning
*NL*
the
limitations
of
life
.
From
being
quite
sure
of
*NL*
himself
and
his
future
he
becomes
not
at
all
sure
.
If
*NL*
he
be
an
imaginative
boy
a
door
is
torn
open
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
he
looks
out
upon
the
world
,
seeing
,
as
*NL*
though
they
marched
in
procession
before
him
,
the
*NL*
countless
figures
of
men
who
before
his
time
have
come
*NL*
out
of
nothingness
into
the
world
,
lived
their
lives
*NL*
and
again
disappeared
into
nothingness
.
The
sadness
of
*NL*
sophistication
has
come
to
the
boy
.
With
a
little
gasp
*NL*
he
sees
himself
as
merely
a
leaf
blown
by
the
wind
*NL*
through
the
streets
of
his
village
.
He
knows
that
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
the
stout
talk
of
his
fellows
he
must
live
*NL*
and
die
in
uncertainty
,
a
thing
blown
by
the
winds
,
a
*NL*
thing
destined
like
corn
to
wilt
in
the
sun
.
He
shivers
*NL*
and
looks
eagerly
about
.
The
eighteen
years
he
has
*NL*
lived
seem
but
a
moment
,
a
breathing
space
in
the
long
*NL*
march
of
humanity
.
Already
he
hears
death
calling
.
With
*NL*
all
his
heart
he
wants
to
come
close
to
some
other
*NL*
human
,
touch
someone
with
his
hands
,
be
touched
by
the
*NL*
hand
of
another
.
If
he
prefers
that
the
other
be
a
*NL*
woman
,
that
is
because
he
believes
that
a
woman
will
be
*NL*
gentle
,
that
she
will
understand
.
He
wants
,
most
of
*NL*
all
,
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
moment
of
sophistication
came
to
George
*NL*
Willard
his
mind
turned
to
Helen
White
,
the
Winesburg
*NL*
banker
's
daughter
.
Always
he
had
been
conscious
of
the
*NL*
girl
growing
into
womanhood
as
he
grew
into
manhood
.
*NL*
Once
on
a
summer
night
when
he
was
eighteen
,
he
had
*NL*
walked
with
her
on
a
country
road
and
in
her
presence
*NL*
had
given
way
to
an
impulse
to
boast
,
to
make
himself
*NL*
appear
big
and
significant
in
her
eyes
.
Now
he
wanted
*NL*
to
see
her
for
another
purpose
.
He
wanted
to
tell
her
*NL*
of
the
new
impulses
that
had
come
to
him
.
He
had
tried
*NL*
to
make
her
think
of
him
as
a
man
when
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
manhood
and
now
he
wanted
to
be
with
her
and
to
try
*NL*
to
make
her
feel
the
change
he
believed
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
his
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Helen
White
,
she
also
had
come
to
a
period
of
*NL*
change
.
What
George
felt
,
she
in
her
young
woman
's
way
*NL*
felt
also
.
She
was
no
longer
a
girl
and
hungered
to
*NL*
reach
into
the
grace
and
beauty
of
womanhood
.
She
had
*NL*
come
home
from
Cleveland
,
where
she
was
attending
*NL*
college
,
to
spend
a
day
at
the
Fair
.
She
also
had
begun
*NL*
to
have
memories
.
During
the
day
she
sat
in
the
*NL*
grand-stand
with
a
young
man
,
one
of
the
instructors
*NL*
from
the
college
,
who
was
a
guest
of
her
mother
's
.
The
*NL*
young
man
was
of
a
pedantic
turn
of
mind
and
she
felt
*NL*
at
once
he
would
not
do
for
her
purpose
.
At
the
Fair
*NL*
she
was
glad
to
be
seen
in
his
company
as
he
was
well
*NL*
dressed
and
a
stranger
.
She
knew
that
the
fact
of
his
*NL*
presence
would
create
an
impression
.
During
the
day
she
*NL*
was
happy
,
but
when
night
came
on
she
began
to
grow
*NL*
restless
.
She
wanted
to
drive
the
instructor
away
,
to
*NL*
get
out
of
his
presence
.
While
they
sat
together
in
the
*NL*
grand-stand
and
while
the
eyes
of
former
schoolmates
*NL*
were
upon
them
,
she
paid
so
much
attention
to
her
*NL*
escort
that
he
grew
interested
.
``
A
scholar
needs
money
.
*NL*
I
should
marry
a
woman
with
money
,
''
he
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
White
was
thinking
of
George
Willard
even
as
he
*NL*
wandered
gloomily
through
the
crowds
thinking
of
her
.
*NL*
She
remembered
the
summer
evening
when
they
had
walked
*NL*
together
and
wanted
to
walk
with
him
again
.
She
thought
*NL*
that
the
months
she
had
spent
in
the
city
,
the
going
to
*NL*
theaters
and
the
seeing
of
great
crowds
wandering
in
*NL*
lighted
thoroughfares
,
had
changed
her
profoundly
.
She
*NL*
wanted
him
to
feel
and
be
conscious
of
the
change
in
*NL*
her
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
evening
together
that
had
left
its
mark
on
*NL*
the
memory
of
both
the
young
man
and
woman
had
,
when
*NL*
looked
at
quite
sensibly
,
been
rather
stupidly
spent
.
*NL*
They
had
walked
out
of
town
along
a
country
road
.
Then
*NL*
they
had
stopped
by
a
fence
near
a
field
of
young
corn
*NL*
and
George
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
let
it
hang
on
*NL*
his
arm
.
``
Well
,
I
've
stayed
here
in
*NL*
Winesburg
--
yes
--
I
've
not
yet
gone
away
but
I
'm
growing
*NL*
up
,
''
he
had
said
.
``
I
've
been
reading
books
and
I
've
*NL*
been
thinking
.
I
'm
going
to
try
to
amount
to
something
*NL*
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
explained
,
``
that
is
n't
the
point
.
Perhaps
*NL*
I
'd
better
quit
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
confused
boy
put
his
hand
on
the
girl
's
arm
.
His
*NL*
voice
trembled
.
The
two
started
to
walk
back
along
the
*NL*
road
toward
town
.
In
his
desperation
George
boasted
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
be
a
big
man
,
the
biggest
that
ever
lived
*NL*
here
in
Winesburg
,
''
he
declared
.
``
I
want
you
to
do
*NL*
something
,
I
do
n't
know
what
.
Perhaps
it
is
none
of
my
*NL*
business
.
I
want
you
to
try
to
be
different
from
other
*NL*
women
.
You
see
the
point
.
It
's
none
of
my
business
I
*NL*
tell
you
.
I
want
you
to
be
a
beautiful
woman
.
You
see
*NL*
what
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
's
voice
failed
and
in
silence
the
two
came
back
*NL*
into
town
and
went
along
the
street
to
Helen
White
's
*NL*
house
.
At
the
gate
he
tried
to
say
something
*NL*
impressive
.
Speeches
he
had
thought
out
came
into
his
*NL*
head
,
but
they
seemed
utterly
pointless
.
``
I
thought
--
I
*NL*
used
to
think
--
I
had
it
in
my
mind
you
would
marry
Seth
*NL*
Richmond
.
Now
I
know
you
wo
n't
,
''
was
all
he
could
find
*NL*
to
say
as
she
went
through
the
gate
and
toward
the
door
*NL*
of
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
warm
fall
evening
as
he
stood
in
the
stairway
*NL*
and
looked
at
the
crowd
drifting
through
Main
Street
,
*NL*
George
thought
of
the
talk
beside
the
field
of
young
*NL*
corn
and
was
ashamed
of
the
figure
he
had
made
of
*NL*
himself
.
In
the
street
the
people
surged
up
and
down
*NL*
like
cattle
confined
in
a
pen
.
Buggies
and
wagons
*NL*
almost
filled
the
narrow
thoroughfare
.
A
band
played
*NL*
and
small
boys
raced
along
the
sidewalk
,
diving
between
*NL*
the
legs
of
men
.
Young
men
with
shining
red
faces
*NL*
walked
awkwardly
about
with
girls
on
their
arms
.
In
a
*NL*
room
above
one
of
the
stores
,
where
a
dance
was
to
be
*NL*
held
,
the
fiddlers
tuned
their
instruments
.
The
broken
*NL*
sounds
floated
down
through
an
open
window
and
out
*NL*
across
the
murmur
of
voices
and
the
loud
blare
of
the
*NL*
horns
of
the
band
.
The
medley
of
sounds
got
on
young
*NL*
Willard
's
nerves
.
Everywhere
,
on
all
sides
,
the
sense
*NL*
of
crowding
,
moving
life
closed
in
about
him
.
He
wanted
*NL*
to
run
away
by
himself
and
think
.
``
If
she
wants
to
stay
*NL*
with
that
fellow
she
may
.
Why
should
I
care
?
What
*NL*
difference
does
it
make
to
me
?
''
he
growled
and
went
*NL*
along
Main
Street
and
through
Hern
's
Grocery
into
a
*NL*
side
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
felt
so
utterly
lonely
and
dejected
that
he
*NL*
wanted
to
weep
but
pride
made
him
walk
rapidly
along
,
*NL*
swinging
his
arms
.
He
came
to
Wesley
Moyer
's
livery
*NL*
barn
and
stopped
in
the
shadows
to
listen
to
a
group
of
*NL*
men
who
talked
of
a
race
Wesley
's
stallion
,
Tony
Tip
,
*NL*
had
won
at
the
Fair
during
the
afternoon
.
A
crowd
had
*NL*
gathered
in
front
of
the
barn
and
before
the
crowd
*NL*
walked
Wesley
,
prancing
up
and
down
boasting
.
He
held
a
*NL*
whip
in
his
hand
and
kept
tapping
the
ground
.
Little
*NL*
puffs
of
dust
arose
in
the
lamplight
.
``
Hell
,
quit
your
*NL*
talking
,
''
Wesley
exclaimed
.
``
I
was
n't
afraid
,
I
knew
I
*NL*
had
'em
beat
all
the
time
.
I
was
n't
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ordinarily
George
Willard
would
have
been
intensely
*NL*
interested
in
the
boasting
of
Moyer
,
the
horseman
.
Now
*NL*
it
made
him
angry
.
He
turned
and
hurried
away
along
the
*NL*
street
.
``
Old
windbag
,
''
he
sputtered
.
``
Why
does
he
want
*NL*
to
be
bragging
?
Why
do
n't
he
shut
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
George
went
into
a
vacant
lot
and
,
as
he
hurried
along
,
*NL*
fell
over
a
pile
of
rubbish
.
A
nail
protruding
from
an
*NL*
empty
barrel
tore
his
trousers
.
He
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
ground
and
swore
.
With
a
pin
he
mended
the
torn
place
*NL*
and
then
arose
and
went
on
.
``
I
'll
go
to
Helen
White
's
*NL*
house
,
that
's
what
I
'll
do
.
I
'll
walk
right
in
.
I
'll
*NL*
say
that
I
want
to
see
her
.
I
'll
walk
right
in
and
sit
*NL*
down
,
that
's
what
I
'll
do
,
''
he
declared
,
climbing
over
*NL*
a
fence
and
beginning
to
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
veranda
of
Banker
White
's
house
Helen
was
*NL*
restless
and
distraught
.
The
instructor
sat
between
the
*NL*
mother
and
daughter
.
His
talk
wearied
the
girl
.
*NL*
Although
he
had
also
been
raised
in
an
Ohio
town
,
the
*NL*
instructor
began
to
put
on
the
airs
of
the
city
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
appear
cosmopolitan
.
``
I
like
the
chance
you
*NL*
have
given
me
to
study
the
background
out
of
which
most
*NL*
of
our
girls
come
,
''
he
declared
.
``
It
was
good
of
you
,
*NL*
Mrs.
White
,
to
have
me
down
for
the
day
.
''
He
turned
to
*NL*
Helen
and
laughed
.
``
Your
life
is
still
bound
up
with
*NL*
the
life
of
this
town
?
''
he
asked
.
``
There
are
people
*NL*
here
in
whom
you
are
interested
?
''
To
the
girl
his
voice
*NL*
sounded
pompous
and
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
arose
and
went
into
the
house
.
At
the
door
*NL*
leading
to
a
garden
at
the
back
she
stopped
and
stood
*NL*
listening
.
Her
mother
began
to
talk
.
``
There
is
no
one
*NL*
here
fit
to
associate
with
a
girl
of
Helen
's
breeding
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Helen
ran
down
a
flight
of
stairs
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
house
and
into
the
garden
.
In
the
darkness
she
stopped
*NL*
and
stood
trembling
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
world
*NL*
was
full
of
meaningless
people
saying
words
.
Afire
with
*NL*
eagerness
she
ran
through
a
garden
gate
and
,
turning
a
*NL*
corner
by
the
banker
's
barn
,
went
into
a
little
side
*NL*
street
.
``
George
!
Where
are
you
,
George
?
''
she
cried
,
*NL*
filled
with
nervous
excitement
.
She
stopped
running
,
*NL*
and
leaned
against
a
tree
to
laugh
hysterically
.
Along
*NL*
the
dark
little
street
came
George
Willard
,
still
*NL*
saying
words
.
``
I
'm
going
to
walk
right
into
her
house
.
*NL*
I
'll
go
right
in
and
sit
down
,
''
he
declared
as
he
came
*NL*
up
to
her
.
He
stopped
and
stared
stupidly
.
``
Come
on
,
''
*NL*
he
said
and
took
hold
of
her
hand
.
With
hanging
heads
*NL*
they
walked
away
along
the
street
under
the
trees
.
Dry
*NL*
leaves
rustled
under
foot
.
Now
that
he
had
found
her
*NL*
George
wondered
what
he
had
better
do
and
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
upper
end
of
the
Fair
Ground
,
in
Winesburg
,
*NL*
there
is
a
half
decayed
old
grand-stand
.
It
has
never
*NL*
been
painted
and
the
boards
are
all
warped
out
of
*NL*
shape
.
The
Fair
Ground
stands
on
top
of
a
low
hill
*NL*
rising
out
of
the
valley
of
Wine
Creek
and
from
the
*NL*
grand-stand
one
can
see
at
night
,
over
a
cornfield
,
the
*NL*
lights
of
the
town
reflected
against
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
and
Helen
climbed
the
hill
to
the
Fair
Ground
,
*NL*
coming
by
the
path
past
Waterworks
Pond
.
The
feeling
of
*NL*
loneliness
and
isolation
that
had
come
to
the
young
man
*NL*
in
the
crowded
streets
of
his
town
was
both
broken
and
*NL*
intensified
by
the
presence
of
Helen
.
What
he
felt
was
*NL*
reflected
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
youth
there
are
always
two
forces
fighting
in
*NL*
people
.
The
warm
unthinking
little
animal
struggles
*NL*
against
the
thing
that
reflects
and
remembers
,
and
the
*NL*
older
,
the
more
sophisticated
thing
had
possession
of
*NL*
George
Willard
.
Sensing
his
mood
,
Helen
walked
beside
*NL*
him
filled
with
respect
.
When
they
got
to
the
*NL*
grand-stand
they
climbed
up
under
the
roof
and
sat
down
*NL*
on
one
of
the
long
bench-like
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
memorable
in
the
experience
to
be
*NL*
had
by
going
into
a
fair
ground
that
stands
at
the
edge
*NL*
of
a
Middle
Western
town
on
a
night
after
the
annual
*NL*
fair
has
been
held
.
The
sensation
is
one
never
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
.
On
all
sides
are
ghosts
,
not
of
the
dead
,
*NL*
but
of
living
people
.
Here
,
during
the
day
just
passed
,
*NL*
have
come
the
people
pouring
in
from
the
town
and
the
*NL*
country
around
.
Farmers
with
their
wives
and
children
*NL*
and
all
the
people
from
the
hundreds
of
little
frame
*NL*
houses
have
gathered
within
these
board
walls
.
Young
*NL*
girls
have
laughed
and
men
with
beards
have
talked
of
*NL*
the
affairs
of
their
lives
.
The
place
has
been
filled
*NL*
to
overflowing
with
life
.
It
has
itched
and
squirmed
*NL*
with
life
and
now
it
is
night
and
the
life
has
all
gone
*NL*
away
.
The
silence
is
almost
terrifying
.
One
conceals
*NL*
oneself
standing
silently
beside
the
trunk
of
a
tree
*NL*
and
what
there
is
of
a
reflective
tendency
in
his
*NL*
nature
is
intensified
.
One
shudders
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
the
meaninglessness
of
life
while
at
the
same
instant
,
*NL*
and
if
the
people
of
the
town
are
his
people
,
one
loves
*NL*
life
so
intensely
that
tears
come
into
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
under
the
roof
of
the
grand-stand
,
*NL*
George
Willard
sat
beside
Helen
White
and
felt
very
*NL*
keenly
his
own
insignificance
in
the
scheme
of
*NL*
existence
.
Now
that
he
had
come
out
of
town
where
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
people
stirring
about
,
busy
with
a
*NL*
multitude
of
affairs
,
had
been
so
irritating
,
the
*NL*
irritation
was
all
gone
.
The
presence
of
Helen
renewed
*NL*
and
refreshed
him
.
It
was
as
though
her
woman
's
hand
*NL*
was
assisting
him
to
make
some
minute
readjustment
of
*NL*
the
machinery
of
his
life
.
He
began
to
think
of
the
*NL*
people
in
the
town
where
he
had
always
lived
with
*NL*
something
like
reverence
.
He
had
reverence
for
Helen
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
love
and
to
be
loved
by
her
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
want
at
the
moment
to
be
confused
by
her
womanhood
.
*NL*
In
the
darkness
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
when
she
*NL*
crept
close
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
.
A
wind
began
to
*NL*
blow
and
he
shivered
.
With
all
his
strength
he
tried
to
*NL*
hold
and
to
understand
the
mood
that
had
come
upon
him
.
*NL*
In
that
high
place
in
the
darkness
the
two
oddly
*NL*
sensitive
human
atoms
held
each
other
tightly
and
*NL*
waited
.
In
the
mind
of
each
was
the
same
thought
.
``
I
*NL*
have
come
to
this
lonely
place
and
here
is
this
other
,
''
*NL*
was
the
substance
of
the
thing
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Winesburg
the
crowded
day
had
run
itself
out
into
*NL*
the
long
night
of
the
late
fall
.
Farm
horses
jogged
*NL*
away
along
lonely
country
roads
pulling
their
portion
*NL*
of
weary
people
.
Clerks
began
to
bring
samples
of
goods
*NL*
in
off
the
sidewalks
and
lock
the
doors
of
stores
.
In
*NL*
the
Opera
House
a
crowd
had
gathered
to
see
a
show
and
*NL*
further
down
Main
Street
the
fiddlers
,
their
*NL*
instruments
tuned
,
sweated
and
worked
to
keep
the
feet
*NL*
of
youth
flying
over
a
dance
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
in
the
grand-stand
Helen
White
and
*NL*
George
Willard
remained
silent
.
Now
and
then
the
spell
*NL*
that
held
them
was
broken
and
they
turned
and
tried
in
*NL*
the
dim
light
to
see
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
They
*NL*
kissed
but
that
impulse
did
not
last
.
At
the
upper
end
*NL*
of
the
Fair
Ground
a
half
dozen
men
worked
over
horses
*NL*
that
had
raced
during
the
afternoon
.
The
men
had
built
*NL*
a
fire
and
were
heating
kettles
of
water
.
Only
their
*NL*
legs
could
be
seen
as
they
passed
back
and
forth
in
the
*NL*
light
.
When
the
wind
blew
the
little
flames
of
the
fire
*NL*
danced
crazily
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
and
Helen
arose
and
walked
away
into
the
*NL*
darkness
.
They
went
along
a
path
past
a
field
of
corn
*NL*
that
had
not
yet
been
cut
.
The
wind
whispered
among
the
*NL*
dry
corn
blades
.
For
a
moment
during
the
walk
back
into
*NL*
town
the
spell
that
held
them
was
broken
.
When
they
had
*NL*
come
to
the
crest
of
Waterworks
Hill
they
stopped
by
a
*NL*
tree
and
George
again
put
his
hands
on
the
girl
's
*NL*
shoulders
.
She
embraced
him
eagerly
and
then
again
they
*NL*
drew
quickly
back
from
that
impulse
.
They
stopped
*NL*
kissing
and
stood
a
little
apart
.
Mutual
respect
grew
*NL*
big
in
them
.
They
were
both
embarrassed
and
to
relieve
*NL*
their
embarrassment
dropped
into
the
animalism
of
*NL*
youth
.
They
laughed
and
began
to
pull
and
haul
at
each
*NL*
other
.
In
some
way
chastened
and
purified
by
the
mood
*NL*
they
had
been
in
,
they
became
,
not
man
and
woman
,
not
*NL*
boy
and
girl
,
but
excited
little
animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
they
went
down
the
hill
.
In
the
darkness
*NL*
they
played
like
two
splendid
young
things
in
a
young
*NL*
world
.
Once
,
running
swiftly
forward
,
Helen
tripped
*NL*
George
and
he
fell
.
He
squirmed
and
shouted
.
Shaking
*NL*
with
laughter
,
he
roiled
down
the
hill
.
Helen
ran
after
*NL*
him
.
For
just
a
moment
she
stopped
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
There
was
no
way
of
knowing
what
woman
's
thoughts
went
*NL*
through
her
mind
but
,
when
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
*NL*
reached
and
she
came
up
to
the
boy
,
she
took
his
arm
*NL*
and
walked
beside
him
in
dignified
silence
.
For
some
*NL*
reason
they
could
not
have
explained
they
had
both
got
*NL*
from
their
silent
evening
together
the
thing
needed
.
*NL*
Man
or
boy
,
woman
or
girl
,
they
had
for
a
moment
taken
*NL*
hold
of
the
thing
that
makes
the
mature
life
of
men
and
*NL*
women
in
the
modern
world
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEPARTURE
*NL*
*NL*
Young
George
Willard
got
out
of
bed
at
four
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
It
was
April
and
the
young
tree
leaves
were
*NL*
just
coming
out
of
their
buds
.
The
trees
along
the
*NL*
residence
streets
in
Winesburg
are
maple
and
the
seeds
*NL*
are
winged
.
When
the
wind
blows
they
whirl
crazily
*NL*
about
,
filling
the
air
and
making
a
carpet
underfoot
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
came
downstairs
into
the
hotel
office
carrying
a
*NL*
brown
leather
bag
.
His
trunk
was
packed
for
departure
.
*NL*
Since
two
o'clock
he
had
been
awake
thinking
of
the
*NL*
journey
he
was
about
to
take
and
wondering
what
he
*NL*
would
find
at
the
end
of
his
journey
.
The
boy
who
slept
*NL*
in
the
hotel
office
lay
on
a
cot
by
the
door
.
His
mouth
*NL*
was
open
and
he
snored
lustily
.
George
crept
past
the
*NL*
cot
and
went
out
into
the
silent
deserted
main
street
.
*NL*
The
east
was
pink
with
the
dawn
and
long
streaks
of
*NL*
light
climbed
into
the
sky
where
a
few
stars
still
*NL*
shone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
last
house
on
Trunion
Pike
in
Winesburg
*NL*
there
is
a
great
stretch
of
open
fields
.
The
fields
are
*NL*
owned
by
farmers
who
live
in
town
and
drive
homeward
at
*NL*
evening
along
Trunion
Pike
in
light
creaking
wagons
.
In
*NL*
the
fields
are
planted
berries
and
small
fruits
.
In
the
*NL*
late
afternoon
in
the
hot
summers
when
the
road
and
the
*NL*
fields
are
covered
with
dust
,
a
smoky
haze
lies
over
*NL*
the
great
flat
basin
of
land
.
To
look
across
it
is
like
*NL*
looking
out
across
the
sea
.
In
the
spring
when
the
land
*NL*
is
green
the
effect
is
somewhat
different
.
The
land
*NL*
becomes
a
wide
green
billiard
table
on
which
tiny
human
*NL*
insects
toil
up
and
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
his
boyhood
and
young
manhood
George
*NL*
Willard
had
been
in
the
habit
of
walking
on
Trunion
*NL*
Pike
.
He
had
been
in
the
midst
of
the
great
open
place
*NL*
on
winter
nights
when
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
only
*NL*
the
moon
looked
down
at
him
;
he
had
been
there
in
the
*NL*
fall
when
bleak
winds
blew
and
on
summer
evenings
when
*NL*
the
air
vibrated
with
the
song
of
insects
.
On
the
April
*NL*
morning
he
wanted
to
go
there
again
,
to
walk
again
in
*NL*
the
silence
.
He
did
walk
to
where
the
road
dipped
down
*NL*
by
a
little
stream
two
miles
from
town
and
then
turned
*NL*
and
walked
silently
back
again
.
When
he
got
to
Main
*NL*
Street
clerks
were
sweeping
the
sidewalks
before
the
*NL*
stores
.
``
Hey
,
you
George
.
How
does
it
feel
to
be
going
*NL*
away
?
''
they
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
westbound
train
leaves
Winesburg
at
seven
*NL*
forty-five
in
the
morning
.
Tom
Little
is
conductor
.
His
*NL*
train
runs
from
Cleveland
to
where
it
connects
with
a
*NL*
great
trunk
line
railroad
with
terminals
in
Chicago
and
*NL*
New
York
.
Tom
has
what
in
railroad
circles
is
called
an
*NL*
``
easy
run
.
''
Every
evening
he
returns
to
his
family
.
In
*NL*
the
fall
and
spring
he
spends
his
Sundays
fishing
in
*NL*
Lake
Erie
.
He
has
a
round
red
face
and
small
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
He
knows
the
people
in
the
towns
along
his
railroad
*NL*
better
than
a
city
man
knows
the
people
who
live
in
his
*NL*
apartment
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
came
down
the
little
incline
from
the
New
*NL*
Willard
House
at
seven
o'clock
.
Tom
Willard
carried
his
*NL*
bag
.
The
son
had
become
taller
than
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
station
platform
everyone
shook
the
young
man
's
*NL*
hand
.
More
than
a
dozen
people
waited
about
.
Then
they
*NL*
talked
of
their
own
affairs
.
Even
Will
Henderson
,
who
*NL*
was
lazy
and
often
slept
until
nine
,
had
got
out
of
*NL*
bed
.
George
was
embarrassed
.
Gertrude
Wilmot
,
a
tall
*NL*
thin
woman
of
fifty
who
worked
in
the
Winesburg
post
*NL*
office
,
came
along
the
station
platform
.
She
had
never
*NL*
before
paid
any
attention
to
George
.
Now
she
stopped
*NL*
and
put
out
her
hand
.
In
two
words
she
voiced
what
*NL*
everyone
felt
.
``
Good
luck
,
''
she
said
sharply
and
then
*NL*
turning
went
on
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
train
came
into
the
station
George
felt
*NL*
relieved
.
He
scampered
hurriedly
aboard
.
Helen
White
*NL*
came
running
along
Main
Street
hoping
to
have
a
parting
*NL*
word
with
him
,
but
he
had
found
a
seat
and
did
not
see
*NL*
her
.
When
the
train
started
Tom
Little
punched
his
*NL*
ticket
,
grinned
and
,
although
he
knew
George
well
and
*NL*
knew
on
what
adventure
he
was
just
setting
out
,
made
no
*NL*
comment
.
Tom
had
seen
a
thousand
George
Willards
go
out
*NL*
of
their
towns
to
the
city
.
It
was
a
commonplace
enough
*NL*
incident
with
him
.
In
the
smoking
car
there
was
a
man
*NL*
who
had
just
invited
Tom
to
go
on
a
fishing
trip
to
*NL*
Sandusky
Bay
.
He
wanted
to
accept
the
invitation
and
*NL*
talk
over
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
glanced
up
and
down
the
car
to
be
sure
no
one
*NL*
was
looking
,
then
took
out
his
pocket-book
and
counted
*NL*
his
money
.
His
mind
was
occupied
with
a
desire
not
to
*NL*
appear
green
.
Almost
the
last
words
his
father
had
said
*NL*
to
him
concerned
the
matter
of
his
behavior
when
he
got
*NL*
to
the
city
.
``
Be
a
sharp
one
,
''
Tom
Willard
had
said
.
*NL*
``
Keep
your
eyes
on
your
money
.
Be
awake
.
That
's
the
*NL*
ticket
.
Do
n't
let
anyone
think
you
're
a
greenhorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
George
counted
his
money
he
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
window
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
train
was
*NL*
still
in
Winesburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
going
out
of
his
town
to
meet
the
*NL*
adventure
of
life
,
began
to
think
but
he
did
not
think
*NL*
of
anything
very
big
or
dramatic
.
Things
like
his
*NL*
mother
's
death
,
his
departure
from
Winesburg
,
the
*NL*
uncertainty
of
his
future
life
in
the
city
,
the
serious
*NL*
and
larger
aspects
of
his
life
did
not
come
into
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
little
things
--
Turk
Smollet
wheeling
*NL*
boards
through
the
main
street
of
his
town
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
a
tall
woman
,
beautifully
gowned
,
who
had
once
*NL*
stayed
overnight
at
his
father
's
hotel
,
Butch
Wheeler
*NL*
the
lamp
lighter
of
Winesburg
hurrying
through
the
*NL*
streets
on
a
summer
evening
and
holding
a
torch
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
Helen
White
standing
by
a
window
in
the
Winesburg
*NL*
post
office
and
putting
a
stamp
on
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
's
mind
was
carried
away
by
his
growing
*NL*
passion
for
dreams
.
One
looking
at
him
would
not
have
*NL*
thought
him
particularly
sharp
.
With
the
recollection
*NL*
of
little
things
occupying
his
mind
he
closed
his
eyes
*NL*
and
leaned
back
in
the
car
seat
.
He
stayed
that
way
for
*NL*
a
long
time
and
when
he
aroused
himself
and
again
*NL*
looked
out
of
the
car
window
the
town
of
Winesburg
had
*NL*
disappeared
and
his
life
there
had
become
but
a
*NL*
background
on
which
to
paint
the
dreams
of
his
manhood
.
