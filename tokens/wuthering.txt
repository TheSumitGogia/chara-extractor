WUTHERING
HEIGHTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
1801
.
--
I
have
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
my
landlord
--
the
solitary
*NL*
neighbour
that
I
shall
be
troubled
with
.
This
is
certainly
a
beautiful
*NL*
country
!
In
all
England
,
I
do
not
believe
that
I
could
have
fixed
on
a
*NL*
situation
so
completely
removed
from
the
stir
of
society
.
A
perfect
*NL*
misanthropist
's
heaven
:
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
I
are
such
a
suitable
pair
*NL*
to
divide
the
desolation
between
us
.
A
capital
fellow
!
He
little
*NL*
imagined
how
my
heart
warmed
towards
him
when
I
beheld
his
black
eyes
*NL*
withdraw
so
suspiciously
under
their
brows
,
as
I
rode
up
,
and
when
his
*NL*
fingers
sheltered
themselves
,
with
a
jealous
resolution
,
still
further
in
*NL*
his
waistcoat
,
as
I
announced
my
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
nod
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Lockwood
,
your
new
tenant
,
sir
.
I
do
myself
the
honour
of
calling
*NL*
as
soon
as
possible
after
my
arrival
,
to
express
the
hope
that
I
have
not
*NL*
inconvenienced
you
by
my
perseverance
in
soliciting
the
occupation
of
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
:
I
heard
yesterday
you
had
had
some
thoughts
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thrushcross
Grange
is
my
own
,
sir
,
'
he
interrupted
,
wincing
.
'
I
should
*NL*
not
allow
any
one
to
inconvenience
me
,
if
I
could
hinder
it
--
walk
in
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
`
walk
in
'
was
uttered
with
closed
teeth
,
and
expressed
the
sentiment
,
*NL*
`
Go
to
the
Deuce
:
'
even
the
gate
over
which
he
leant
manifested
no
*NL*
sympathising
movement
to
the
words
;
and
I
think
that
circumstance
*NL*
determined
me
to
accept
the
invitation
:
I
felt
interested
in
a
man
who
*NL*
seemed
more
exaggeratedly
reserved
than
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
my
horse
's
breast
fairly
pushing
the
barrier
,
he
did
put
out
*NL*
his
hand
to
unchain
it
,
and
then
sullenly
preceded
me
up
the
causeway
,
*NL*
calling
,
as
we
entered
the
court
,
--
`
Joseph
,
take
Mr.
Lockwood
's
horse
;
*NL*
and
bring
up
some
wine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
we
have
the
whole
establishment
of
domestics
,
I
suppose
,
'
was
the
*NL*
reflection
suggested
by
this
compound
order
.
`
No
wonder
the
grass
grows
*NL*
up
between
the
flags
,
and
cattle
are
the
only
hedge-cutters
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
was
an
elderly
,
nay
,
an
old
man
:
very
old
,
perhaps
,
though
hale
*NL*
and
sinewy
.
`
The
Lord
help
us
!
'
he
soliloquised
in
an
undertone
of
*NL*
peevish
displeasure
,
while
relieving
me
of
my
horse
:
looking
,
meantime
,
*NL*
in
my
face
so
sourly
that
I
charitably
conjectured
he
must
have
need
of
*NL*
divine
aid
to
digest
his
dinner
,
and
his
pious
ejaculation
had
no
*NL*
reference
to
my
unexpected
advent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
is
the
name
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
`
Wuthering
'
*NL*
being
a
significant
provincial
adjective
,
descriptive
of
the
atmospheric
*NL*
tumult
to
which
its
station
is
exposed
in
stormy
weather
.
Pure
,
bracing
*NL*
ventilation
they
must
have
up
there
at
all
times
,
indeed
:
one
may
guess
*NL*
the
power
of
the
north
wind
blowing
over
the
edge
,
by
the
excessive
slant
*NL*
of
a
few
stunted
firs
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
by
a
range
of
gaunt
*NL*
thorns
all
stretching
their
limbs
one
way
,
as
if
craving
alms
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
Happily
,
the
architect
had
foresight
to
build
it
strong
:
the
narrow
*NL*
windows
are
deeply
set
in
the
wall
,
and
the
corners
defended
with
large
*NL*
jutting
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
passing
the
threshold
,
I
paused
to
admire
a
quantity
of
grotesque
*NL*
carving
lavished
over
the
front
,
and
especially
about
the
principal
door
;
*NL*
above
which
,
among
a
wilderness
of
crumbling
griffins
and
shameless
*NL*
little
boys
,
I
detected
the
date
'
1500
,
'
and
the
name
`
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
'
*NL*
I
would
have
made
a
few
comments
,
and
requested
a
short
history
of
the
*NL*
place
from
the
surly
owner
;
but
his
attitude
at
the
door
appeared
to
*NL*
demand
my
speedy
entrance
,
or
complete
departure
,
and
I
had
no
desire
to
*NL*
aggravate
his
impatience
previous
to
inspecting
the
penetralium
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
stop
brought
us
into
the
family
sitting-room
,
without
any
*NL*
introductory
lobby
or
passage
:
they
call
it
here
`
the
house
'
*NL*
pre-eminently
.
It
includes
kitchen
and
parlour
,
generally
;
but
I
believe
*NL*
at
Wuthering
Heights
the
kitchen
is
forced
to
retreat
altogether
into
*NL*
another
quarter
:
at
least
I
distinguished
a
chatter
of
tongues
,
and
a
*NL*
clatter
of
culinary
utensils
,
deep
within
;
and
I
observed
no
signs
of
*NL*
roasting
,
boiling
,
or
baking
,
about
the
huge
fireplace
;
nor
any
glitter
*NL*
of
copper
saucepans
and
tin
cullenders
on
the
walls
.
One
end
,
indeed
,
*NL*
reflected
splendidly
both
light
and
heat
from
ranks
of
immense
pewter
*NL*
dishes
,
interspersed
with
silver
jugs
and
tankards
,
towering
row
after
*NL*
row
,
on
a
vast
oak
dresser
,
to
the
very
roof
.
The
latter
had
never
been
*NL*
under-drawn
:
its
entire
anatomy
lay
bare
to
an
inquiring
eye
,
except
*NL*
where
a
frame
of
wood
laden
with
oatcakes
and
clusters
of
legs
of
beef
,
*NL*
mutton
,
and
ham
,
concealed
it
.
Above
the
chimney
were
sundry
villainous
*NL*
old
guns
,
and
a
couple
of
horse-pistols
:
and
,
by
way
of
ornament
,
three
*NL*
gaudily-painted
canisters
disposed
along
its
ledge
.
The
floor
was
of
*NL*
smooth
,
white
stone
;
the
chairs
,
high-backed
,
primitive
structures
,
*NL*
painted
green
:
one
or
two
heavy
black
ones
lurking
in
the
shade
.
In
an
*NL*
arch
under
the
dresser
reposed
a
huge
,
liver-coloured
bitch
pointer
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
squealing
puppies
;
and
other
dogs
haunted
other
*NL*
recesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
and
furniture
would
have
been
nothing
extraordinary
as
*NL*
belonging
to
a
homely
,
northern
farmer
,
with
a
stubborn
countenance
,
and
*NL*
stalwart
limbs
set
out
to
advantage
in
knee-breeches
and
gaiters
.
Such
*NL*
an
individual
seated
in
his
arm-chair
,
his
mug
of
ale
frothing
on
the
*NL*
round
table
before
him
,
is
to
be
seen
in
any
circuit
of
five
or
six
miles
*NL*
among
these
hills
,
if
you
go
at
the
right
time
after
dinner
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
forms
a
singular
contrast
to
his
abode
and
style
of
living
.
He
*NL*
is
a
dark-skinned
gipsy
in
aspect
,
in
dress
and
manners
a
gentleman
:
that
*NL*
is
,
as
much
a
gentleman
as
many
a
country
squire
:
rather
slovenly
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
yet
not
looking
amiss
with
his
negligence
,
because
he
has
an
*NL*
erect
and
handsome
figure
;
and
rather
morose
.
Possibly
,
some
people
*NL*
might
suspect
him
of
a
degree
of
under-bred
pride
;
I
have
a
sympathetic
*NL*
chord
within
that
tells
me
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
:
I
know
,
by
*NL*
instinct
,
his
reserve
springs
from
an
aversion
to
showy
displays
of
*NL*
feeling
--
to
manifestations
of
mutual
kindliness
.
He
'll
love
and
hate
*NL*
equally
under
cover
,
and
esteem
it
a
species
of
impertinence
to
be
loved
*NL*
or
hated
again
.
No
,
I
'm
running
on
too
fast
:
I
bestow
my
own
attributes
*NL*
over-liberally
on
him
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
may
have
entirely
dissimilar
*NL*
reasons
for
keeping
his
hand
out
of
the
way
when
he
meets
a
would-be
*NL*
acquaintance
,
to
those
which
actuate
me
.
Let
me
hope
my
constitution
is
*NL*
almost
peculiar
:
my
dear
mother
used
to
say
I
should
never
have
a
*NL*
comfortable
home
;
and
only
last
summer
I
proved
myself
perfectly
unworthy
*NL*
of
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
enjoying
a
month
of
fine
weather
at
the
sea-coast
,
I
was
thrown
*NL*
into
the
company
of
a
most
fascinating
creature
:
a
real
goddess
in
my
*NL*
eyes
,
as
long
as
she
took
no
notice
of
me
.
I
`
never
told
my
love
'
*NL*
vocally
;
still
,
if
looks
have
language
,
the
merest
idiot
might
have
*NL*
guessed
I
was
over
head
and
ears
:
she
understood
me
at
last
,
and
looked
a
*NL*
return
--
the
sweetest
of
all
imaginable
looks
.
And
what
did
I
do
?
I
*NL*
confess
it
with
shame
--
shrunk
icily
into
myself
,
like
a
snail
;
at
every
*NL*
glance
retired
colder
and
farther
;
till
finally
the
poor
innocent
was
led
*NL*
to
doubt
her
own
senses
,
and
,
overwhelmed
with
confusion
at
her
supposed
*NL*
mistake
,
persuaded
her
mamma
to
decamp
.
By
this
curious
turn
of
*NL*
disposition
I
have
gained
the
reputation
of
deliberate
heartlessness
;
how
*NL*
undeserved
,
I
alone
can
appreciate
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
hearthstone
opposite
that
towards
which
*NL*
my
landlord
advanced
,
and
filled
up
an
interval
of
silence
by
attempting
*NL*
to
caress
the
canine
mother
,
who
had
left
her
nursery
,
and
was
sneaking
*NL*
wolfishly
to
the
back
of
my
legs
,
her
lip
curled
up
,
and
her
white
teeth
*NL*
watering
for
a
snatch
.
My
caress
provoked
a
long
,
guttural
gnarl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
better
let
the
dog
alone
,
'
growled
Mr.
Heathcliff
in
unison
,
*NL*
checking
fiercer
demonstrations
with
a
punch
of
his
foot
.
`
She
's
not
*NL*
accustomed
to
be
spoiled
--
not
kept
for
a
pet
.
'
Then
,
striding
to
a
side
*NL*
door
,
he
shouted
again
,
`
Joseph
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
mumbled
indistinctly
in
the
depths
of
the
cellar
,
but
gave
no
*NL*
intimation
of
ascending
;
so
his
master
dived
down
to
him
,
leaving
me
*NL*
_
vis-a-vis
_
the
ruffianly
bitch
and
a
pair
of
grim
shaggy
sheep-dogs
,
*NL*
who
shared
with
her
a
jealous
guardianship
over
all
my
movements
.
Not
*NL*
anxious
to
come
in
contact
with
their
fangs
,
I
sat
still
;
but
,
imagining
*NL*
they
would
scarcely
understand
tacit
insults
,
I
unfortunately
indulged
*NL*
in
winking
and
making
faces
at
the
trio
,
and
some
turn
of
my
physiognomy
*NL*
so
irritated
madam
,
that
she
suddenly
broke
into
a
fury
and
leapt
on
my
*NL*
knees
.
I
flung
her
back
,
and
hastened
to
interpose
the
table
between
us
.
*NL*
This
proceeding
aroused
the
whole
hive
:
half-a-dozen
four-footed
fiends
,
*NL*
of
various
sizes
and
ages
,
issued
from
hidden
dens
to
the
common
centre
.
*NL*
I
felt
my
heels
and
coat-laps
peculiar
subjects
of
assault
;
and
parrying
*NL*
off
the
larger
combatants
as
effectually
as
I
could
with
the
poker
,
I
*NL*
was
constrained
to
demand
,
aloud
,
assistance
from
some
of
the
household
*NL*
in
re-establishing
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
and
his
man
climbed
the
cellar
steps
with
vexatious
*NL*
phlegm
:
I
do
n't
think
they
moved
one
second
faster
than
usual
,
though
*NL*
the
hearth
was
an
absolute
tempest
of
worrying
and
yelping
.
Happily
,
an
*NL*
inhabitant
of
the
kitchen
made
more
despatch
:
a
lusty
dame
,
with
*NL*
tucked-up
gown
,
bare
arms
,
and
fire-flushed
cheeks
,
rushed
into
the
*NL*
midst
of
us
flourishing
a
frying-pan
:
and
used
that
weapon
,
and
her
*NL*
tongue
,
to
such
purpose
,
that
the
storm
subsided
magically
,
and
she
only
*NL*
remained
,
heaving
like
a
sea
after
a
high
wind
,
when
her
master
entered
*NL*
on
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
the
devil
is
the
matter
?
'
he
asked
,
eyeing
me
in
a
manner
that
I
*NL*
could
ill
endure
,
after
this
inhospitable
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
the
devil
,
indeed
!
'
I
muttered
.
`
The
herd
of
possessed
swine
could
*NL*
have
had
no
worse
spirits
in
them
than
those
animals
of
yours
,
sir
.
You
*NL*
might
as
well
leave
a
stranger
with
a
brood
of
tigers
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
wo
n't
meddle
with
persons
who
touch
nothing
,
'
he
remarked
,
putting
*NL*
the
bottle
before
me
,
and
restoring
the
displaced
table
.
`
The
dogs
do
*NL*
right
to
be
vigilant
.
Take
a
glass
of
wine
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
thank
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
bitten
,
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
had
been
,
I
would
have
set
my
signet
on
the
biter
.
'
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
countenance
relaxed
into
a
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
,
'
he
said
,
`
you
are
flurried
,
Mr.
Lockwood
.
Here
,
take
a
*NL*
little
wine
.
Guests
are
so
exceedingly
rare
in
this
house
that
I
and
my
*NL*
dogs
,
I
am
willing
to
own
,
hardly
know
how
to
receive
them
.
Your
health
,
*NL*
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
bowed
and
returned
the
pledge
;
beginning
to
perceive
that
it
would
be
*NL*
foolish
to
sit
sulking
for
the
misbehaviour
of
a
pack
of
curs
;
besides
,
I
*NL*
felt
loth
to
yield
the
fellow
further
amusement
at
my
expense
;
since
his
*NL*
humour
took
that
turn
.
He
--
probably
swayed
by
prudential
consideration
*NL*
of
the
folly
of
offending
a
good
tenant
--
relaxed
a
little
in
the
laconic
*NL*
style
of
chipping
off
his
pronouns
and
auxiliary
verbs
,
and
introduced
*NL*
what
he
supposed
would
be
a
subject
of
interest
to
me
,
--
a
discourse
on
*NL*
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
my
present
place
of
retirement
.
I
*NL*
found
him
very
intelligent
on
the
topics
we
touched
;
and
before
I
went
*NL*
home
,
I
was
encouraged
so
far
as
to
volunteer
another
visit
to-morrow
.
He
*NL*
evidently
wished
no
repetition
of
my
intrusion
.
I
shall
go
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
.
It
is
astonishing
how
sociable
I
feel
myself
compared
*NL*
with
him
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
afternoon
set
in
misty
and
cold
.
I
had
half
a
mind
to
spend
it
*NL*
by
my
study
fire
,
instead
of
wading
through
heath
and
mud
to
Wuthering
*NL*
Heights
.
On
coming
up
from
dinner
,
however
,
-LRB-
N.B.
--
I
dine
between
twelve
*NL*
and
one
o'clock
;
the
housekeeper
,
a
matronly
lady
,
taken
as
a
fixture
*NL*
along
with
the
house
,
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
comprehend
my
request
that
*NL*
I
might
be
served
at
five
-RRB-
--
on
mounting
the
stairs
with
this
lazy
*NL*
intention
,
and
stepping
into
the
room
,
I
saw
a
servant-girl
on
her
knees
*NL*
surrounded
by
brushes
and
coal-scuttles
,
and
raising
an
infernal
dust
as
*NL*
she
extinguished
the
flames
with
heaps
of
cinders
.
This
spectacle
drove
*NL*
me
back
immediately
;
I
took
my
hat
,
and
,
after
a
four-miles
'
walk
,
*NL*
arrived
at
Heathcliff
's
garden-gate
just
in
time
to
escape
the
first
*NL*
feathery
flakes
of
a
snow-shower
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
bleak
hill-top
the
earth
was
hard
with
a
black
frost
,
and
the
air
*NL*
made
me
shiver
through
every
limb
.
Being
unable
to
remove
the
chain
,
I
*NL*
jumped
over
,
and
,
running
up
the
flagged
causeway
bordered
with
*NL*
straggling
gooseberry-bushes
,
knocked
vainly
for
admittance
,
till
my
*NL*
knuckles
tingled
and
the
dogs
howled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wretched
inmates
!
'
I
ejaculated
,
mentally
,
`
you
deserve
perpetual
*NL*
isolation
from
your
species
for
your
churlish
inhospitality
.
At
least
,
I
*NL*
would
not
keep
my
doors
barred
in
the
day-time
.
I
do
n't
care
--
I
will
get
*NL*
in
!
'
So
resolved
,
I
grasped
the
latch
and
shook
it
vehemently
.
*NL*
Vinegar-faced
Joseph
projected
his
head
from
a
round
window
of
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
are
ye
for
?
'
he
shouted
.
`
T
'
maister
's
down
i
'
t
'
fowld
.
Go
round
*NL*
by
th
'
end
o
'
t
'
laith
,
if
ye
went
to
spake
to
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
nobody
inside
to
open
the
door
?
'
I
hallooed
,
responsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
nobbut
t
'
missis
;
and
shoo
'll
not
oppen
'
t
an
ye
mak
'
yer
*NL*
flaysome
dins
till
neeght
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
?
Can
not
you
tell
her
whom
I
am
,
eh
,
Joseph
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor-ne
me
!
I
'll
hae
no
hend
wi
`
t
,
'
muttered
the
head
,
vanishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snow
began
to
drive
thickly
.
I
seized
the
handle
to
essay
another
*NL*
trial
;
when
a
young
man
without
coat
,
and
shouldering
a
pitchfork
,
*NL*
appeared
in
the
yard
behind
.
He
hailed
me
to
follow
him
,
and
,
after
*NL*
marching
through
a
wash-house
,
and
a
paved
area
containing
a
coal-shed
,
*NL*
pump
,
and
pigeon-cot
,
we
at
length
arrived
in
the
huge
,
warm
,
cheerful
*NL*
apartment
where
I
was
formerly
received
.
It
glowed
delightfully
in
the
*NL*
radiance
of
an
immense
fire
,
compounded
of
coal
,
peat
,
and
wood
;
and
near
*NL*
the
table
,
laid
for
a
plentiful
evening
meal
,
I
was
pleased
to
observe
*NL*
the
`
missis
,
'
an
individual
whose
existence
I
had
never
previously
*NL*
suspected
.
I
bowed
and
waited
,
thinking
she
would
bid
me
take
a
seat
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
me
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
,
and
remained
motionless
and
*NL*
mute
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rough
weather
!
'
I
remarked
.
`
I
'm
afraid
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
the
door
must
*NL*
bear
the
consequence
of
your
servants
'
leisure
attendance
:
I
had
hard
*NL*
work
to
make
them
hear
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
opened
her
mouth
.
I
stared
--
she
stared
also
:
at
any
rate
,
she
*NL*
kept
her
eyes
on
me
in
a
cool
,
regardless
manner
,
exceedingly
*NL*
embarrassing
and
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sit
down
,
'
said
the
young
man
,
gruffly
.
`
He
'll
be
in
soon
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
;
and
hemmed
,
and
called
the
villain
Juno
,
who
deigned
,
at
this
*NL*
second
interview
,
to
move
the
extreme
tip
of
her
tail
,
in
token
of
owning
*NL*
my
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
beautiful
animal
!
'
I
commenced
again
.
`
Do
you
intend
parting
with
the
*NL*
little
ones
,
madam
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
are
not
mine
,
'
said
the
amiable
hostess
,
more
repellingly
than
*NL*
Heathcliff
himself
could
have
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
your
favourites
are
among
these
?
'
I
continued
,
turning
to
an
obscure
*NL*
cushion
full
of
something
like
cats
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
strange
choice
of
favourites
!
'
she
observed
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unluckily
,
it
was
a
heap
of
dead
rabbits
.
I
hemmed
once
more
,
and
drew
*NL*
closer
to
the
hearth
,
repeating
my
comment
on
the
wildness
of
the
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
not
have
come
out
,
'
she
said
,
rising
and
reaching
from
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
two
of
the
painted
canisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
position
before
was
sheltered
from
the
light
;
now
,
I
had
a
distinct
*NL*
view
of
her
whole
figure
and
countenance
.
She
was
slender
,
and
*NL*
apparently
scarcely
past
girlhood
:
an
admirable
form
,
and
the
most
*NL*
exquisite
little
face
that
I
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
beholding
;
*NL*
small
features
,
very
fair
;
flaxen
ringlets
,
or
rather
golden
,
hanging
*NL*
loose
on
her
delicate
neck
;
and
eyes
,
had
they
been
agreeable
in
*NL*
expression
,
that
would
have
been
irresistible
:
fortunately
for
my
*NL*
susceptible
heart
,
the
only
sentiment
they
evinced
hovered
between
scorn
*NL*
and
a
kind
of
desperation
,
singularly
unnatural
to
be
detected
there
.
The
*NL*
canisters
were
almost
out
of
her
reach
;
I
made
a
motion
to
aid
her
;
she
*NL*
turned
upon
me
as
a
miser
might
turn
if
any
one
attempted
to
assist
him
*NL*
in
counting
his
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
want
your
help
,
'
she
snapped
;
'
I
can
get
them
for
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
!
'
I
hastened
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Were
you
asked
to
tea
?
'
she
demanded
,
tying
an
apron
over
her
neat
black
*NL*
frock
,
and
standing
with
a
spoonful
of
the
leaf
poised
over
the
pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
a
cup
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Were
you
asked
?
'
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
I
said
,
half
smiling
.
`
You
are
the
proper
person
to
ask
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
the
tea
back
,
spoon
and
all
,
and
resumed
her
chair
in
a
pet
;
*NL*
her
forehead
corrugated
,
and
her
red
under-lip
pushed
out
,
like
a
child
's
*NL*
ready
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
young
man
had
slung
on
to
his
person
a
decidedly
shabby
*NL*
upper
garment
,
and
,
erecting
himself
before
the
blaze
,
looked
down
on
me
*NL*
from
the
corner
of
his
eyes
,
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
were
some
*NL*
mortal
feud
unavenged
between
us
.
I
began
to
doubt
whether
he
were
a
*NL*
servant
or
not
:
his
dress
and
speech
were
both
rude
,
entirely
devoid
of
*NL*
the
superiority
observable
in
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
;
his
thick
brown
*NL*
curls
were
rough
and
uncultivated
,
his
whiskers
encroached
bearishly
over
*NL*
his
cheeks
,
and
his
hands
were
embrowned
like
those
of
a
common
labourer
:
*NL*
still
his
bearing
was
free
,
almost
haughty
,
and
he
showed
none
of
a
*NL*
domestic
's
assiduity
in
attending
on
the
lady
of
the
house
.
In
the
*NL*
absence
of
clear
proofs
of
his
condition
,
I
deemed
it
best
to
abstain
*NL*
from
noticing
his
curious
conduct
;
and
,
five
minutes
afterwards
,
the
*NL*
entrance
of
Heathcliff
relieved
me
,
in
some
measure
,
from
my
*NL*
uncomfortable
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
,
sir
,
I
am
come
,
according
to
promise
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
assuming
*NL*
the
cheerful
;
`
and
I
fear
I
shall
be
weather-bound
for
half
an
hour
,
if
*NL*
you
can
afford
me
shelter
during
that
space
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Half
an
hour
?
'
he
said
,
shaking
the
white
flakes
from
his
clothes
;
'
I
*NL*
wonder
you
should
select
the
thick
of
a
snow-storm
to
ramble
about
in
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
that
you
run
a
risk
of
being
lost
in
the
marshes
?
People
*NL*
familiar
with
these
moors
often
miss
their
road
on
such
evenings
;
and
I
*NL*
can
tell
you
there
is
no
chance
of
a
change
at
present
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
can
get
a
guide
among
your
lads
,
and
he
might
stay
at
the
*NL*
Grange
till
morning
--
could
you
spare
me
one
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
could
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
indeed
!
Well
,
then
,
I
must
trust
to
my
own
sagacity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Umph
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
going
to
mak
'
the
tea
?
'
demanded
he
of
the
shabby
coat
,
shifting
*NL*
his
ferocious
gaze
from
me
to
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
_
he
_
to
have
any
?
'
she
asked
,
appealing
to
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
it
ready
,
will
you
?
'
was
the
answer
,
uttered
so
savagely
that
I
*NL*
started
.
The
tone
in
which
the
words
were
said
revealed
a
genuine
bad
*NL*
nature
.
I
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
call
Heathcliff
a
capital
fellow
.
*NL*
When
the
preparations
were
finished
,
he
invited
me
with
--
`
Now
,
sir
,
bring
*NL*
forward
your
chair
.
'
And
we
all
,
including
the
rustic
youth
,
drew
round
*NL*
the
table
:
an
austere
silence
prevailing
while
we
discussed
our
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
,
if
I
had
caused
the
cloud
,
it
was
my
duty
to
make
an
effort
to
*NL*
dispel
it
.
They
could
not
every
day
sit
so
grim
and
taciturn
;
and
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
however
ill-tempered
they
might
be
,
that
the
universal
scowl
*NL*
they
wore
was
their
every-day
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
strange
,
'
I
began
,
in
the
interval
of
swallowing
one
cup
of
tea
*NL*
and
receiving
another
--
`
it
is
strange
how
custom
can
mould
our
tastes
and
*NL*
ideas
:
many
could
not
imagine
the
existence
of
happiness
in
a
life
of
*NL*
such
complete
exile
from
the
world
as
you
spend
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
yet
,
*NL*
I
'll
venture
to
say
,
that
,
surrounded
by
your
family
,
and
with
your
*NL*
amiable
lady
as
the
presiding
genius
over
your
home
and
heart
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
amiable
lady
!
'
he
interrupted
,
with
an
almost
diabolical
sneer
on
his
*NL*
face
.
`
Where
is
she
--
my
amiable
lady
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
your
wife
,
I
mean
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
yes
--
oh
,
you
would
intimate
that
her
spirit
has
taken
the
post
of
*NL*
ministering
angel
,
and
guards
the
fortunes
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
even
*NL*
when
her
body
is
gone
.
Is
that
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
myself
in
a
blunder
,
I
attempted
to
correct
it
.
I
might
have
*NL*
seen
there
was
too
great
a
disparity
between
the
ages
of
the
parties
to
*NL*
make
it
likely
that
they
were
man
and
wife
.
One
was
about
forty
:
a
*NL*
period
of
mental
vigour
at
which
men
seldom
cherish
the
delusion
of
being
*NL*
married
for
love
by
girls
:
that
dream
is
reserved
for
the
solace
of
our
*NL*
declining
years
.
The
other
did
not
look
seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
flashed
upon
me
--
`
The
clown
at
my
elbow
,
who
is
drinking
his
tea
*NL*
out
of
a
basin
and
eating
his
bread
with
unwashed
hands
,
may
be
her
*NL*
husband
:
Heathcliff
junior
,
of
course
.
Here
is
the
consequence
of
being
*NL*
buried
alive
:
she
has
thrown
herself
away
upon
that
boor
from
sheer
*NL*
ignorance
that
better
individuals
existed
!
A
sad
pity
--
I
must
beware
how
*NL*
I
cause
her
to
regret
her
choice
.
'
The
last
reflection
may
seem
*NL*
conceited
;
it
was
not
.
My
neighbour
struck
me
as
bordering
on
repulsive
;
*NL*
I
knew
,
through
experience
,
that
I
was
tolerably
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Heathcliff
is
my
daughter-in-law
,
'
said
Heathcliff
,
corroborating
*NL*
my
surmise
.
He
turned
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
peculiar
look
in
her
direction
:
a
*NL*
look
of
hatred
;
unless
he
has
a
most
perverse
set
of
facial
muscles
that
*NL*
will
not
,
like
those
of
other
people
,
interpret
the
language
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
certainly
--
I
see
now
:
you
are
the
favoured
possessor
of
the
*NL*
beneficent
fairy
,
'
I
remarked
,
turning
to
my
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
worse
than
before
:
the
youth
grew
crimson
,
and
clenched
his
*NL*
fist
,
with
every
appearance
of
a
meditated
assault
.
But
he
seemed
to
*NL*
recollect
himself
presently
,
and
smothered
the
storm
in
a
brutal
curse
,
*NL*
muttered
on
my
behalf
:
which
,
however
,
I
took
care
not
to
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Unhappy
in
your
conjectures
,
sir
,
'
observed
my
host
;
`
we
neither
of
us
*NL*
have
the
privilege
of
owning
your
good
fairy
;
her
mate
is
dead
.
I
said
*NL*
she
was
my
daughter-in-law
:
therefore
,
she
must
have
married
my
son
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
this
young
man
is
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
my
son
,
assuredly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
smiled
again
,
as
if
it
were
rather
too
bold
a
jest
to
*NL*
attribute
the
paternity
of
that
bear
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
name
is
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
'
growled
the
other
;
`
and
I
'd
counsel
you
to
*NL*
respect
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
shown
no
disrespect
,
'
was
my
reply
,
laughing
internally
at
the
*NL*
dignity
with
which
he
announced
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fixed
his
eye
on
me
longer
than
I
cared
to
return
the
stare
,
for
fear
*NL*
I
might
be
tempted
either
to
box
his
ears
or
render
my
hilarity
audible
.
*NL*
I
began
to
feel
unmistakably
out
of
place
in
that
pleasant
family
circle
.
*NL*
The
dismal
spiritual
atmosphere
overcame
,
and
more
than
neutralised
,
the
*NL*
glowing
physical
comforts
round
me
;
and
I
resolved
to
be
cautious
how
I
*NL*
ventured
under
those
rafters
a
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
business
of
eating
being
concluded
,
and
no
one
uttering
a
word
of
*NL*
sociable
conversation
,
I
approached
a
window
to
examine
the
weather
.
A
*NL*
sorrowful
sight
I
saw
:
dark
night
coming
down
prematurely
,
and
sky
and
*NL*
hills
mingled
in
one
bitter
whirl
of
wind
and
suffocating
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
it
possible
for
me
to
get
home
now
without
a
guide
,
'
I
*NL*
could
not
help
exclaiming
.
`
The
roads
will
be
buried
already
;
and
,
if
*NL*
they
were
bare
,
I
could
scarcely
distinguish
a
foot
in
advance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hareton
,
drive
those
dozen
sheep
into
the
barn
porch
.
They
'll
be
*NL*
covered
if
left
in
the
fold
all
night
:
and
put
a
plank
before
them
,
'
said
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
must
I
do
?
'
I
continued
,
with
rising
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
to
my
question
;
and
on
looking
round
I
saw
only
Joseph
*NL*
bringing
in
a
pail
of
porridge
for
the
dogs
,
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
leaning
*NL*
over
the
fire
,
diverting
herself
with
burning
a
bundle
of
matches
which
*NL*
had
fallen
from
the
chimney-piece
as
she
restored
the
tea-canister
to
its
*NL*
place
.
The
former
,
when
he
had
deposited
his
burden
,
took
a
critical
*NL*
survey
of
the
room
,
and
in
cracked
tones
grated
out
--
`
Aw
wonder
how
yah
*NL*
can
faishion
to
stand
thear
i
'
idleness
un
war
,
when
all
on
'em
s
goan
*NL*
out
!
Bud
yah
're
a
nowt
,
and
it
's
no
use
talking
--
yah
'll
niver
mend
o'yer
*NL*
ill
ways
,
but
goa
raight
to
t
'
divil
,
like
yer
mother
afore
ye
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
imagined
,
for
a
moment
,
that
this
piece
of
eloquence
was
addressed
to
*NL*
me
;
and
,
sufficiently
enraged
,
stepped
towards
the
aged
rascal
with
an
*NL*
intention
of
kicking
him
out
of
the
door
.
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
however
,
*NL*
checked
me
by
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
scandalous
old
hypocrite
!
'
she
replied
.
`
Are
you
not
afraid
of
*NL*
being
carried
away
bodily
,
whenever
you
mention
the
devil
's
name
?
I
warn
*NL*
you
to
refrain
from
provoking
me
,
or
I
'll
ask
your
abduction
as
a
special
*NL*
favour
!
Stop
!
look
here
,
Joseph
,
'
she
continued
,
taking
a
long
,
dark
*NL*
book
from
a
shelf
;
`
I
'll
show
you
how
far
I
've
progressed
in
the
Black
*NL*
Art
:
I
shall
soon
be
competent
to
make
a
clear
house
of
it
.
The
red
cow
*NL*
did
n't
die
by
chance
;
and
your
rheumatism
can
hardly
be
reckoned
among
*NL*
providential
visitations
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
wicked
,
wicked
!
'
gasped
the
elder
;
`
may
the
Lord
deliver
us
from
*NL*
evil
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
reprobate
!
you
are
a
castaway
--
be
off
,
or
I
'll
hurt
you
seriously
!
*NL*
I
'll
have
you
all
modelled
in
wax
and
clay
!
and
the
first
who
passes
the
*NL*
limits
I
fix
shall
--
I
'll
not
say
what
he
shall
be
done
to
--
but
,
you
'll
*NL*
see
!
Go
,
I
'm
looking
at
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
witch
put
a
mock
malignity
into
her
beautiful
eyes
,
and
*NL*
Joseph
,
trembling
with
sincere
horror
,
hurried
out
,
praying
,
and
*NL*
ejaculating
`
wicked
'
as
he
went
.
I
thought
her
conduct
must
be
prompted
*NL*
by
a
species
of
dreary
fun
;
and
,
now
that
we
were
alone
,
I
endeavoured
to
*NL*
interest
her
in
my
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
'
I
said
earnestly
,
`
you
must
excuse
me
for
troubling
*NL*
you
.
I
presume
,
because
,
with
that
face
,
I
'm
sure
you
can
not
help
being
*NL*
good-hearted
.
Do
point
out
some
landmarks
by
which
I
may
know
my
way
*NL*
home
:
I
have
no
more
idea
how
to
get
there
than
you
would
have
how
to
get
*NL*
to
London
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
the
road
you
came
,
'
she
answered
,
ensconcing
herself
in
a
chair
,
*NL*
with
a
candle
,
and
the
long
book
open
before
her
.
`
It
is
brief
advice
,
*NL*
but
as
sound
as
I
can
give
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
if
you
hear
of
me
being
discovered
dead
in
a
bog
or
a
pit
full
of
*NL*
snow
,
your
conscience
wo
n't
whisper
that
it
is
partly
your
fault
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
so
?
I
can
not
escort
you
.
They
would
n't
let
me
go
to
the
end
of
the
*NL*
garden
wall
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
You
_
!
I
should
be
sorry
to
ask
you
to
cross
the
threshold
,
for
my
*NL*
convenience
,
on
such
a
night
,
'
I
cried
.
'
I
want
you
to
tell
me
my
way
,
*NL*
not
to
_
show
_
it
:
or
else
to
persuade
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
give
me
a
guide
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
?
There
is
himself
,
Earnshaw
,
Zillah
,
Joseph
and
I.
Which
would
you
*NL*
have
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
there
no
boys
at
the
farm
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
those
are
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
it
follows
that
I
am
compelled
to
stay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
you
may
settle
with
your
host
.
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
make
no
more
rash
journeys
on
these
*NL*
hills
,
'
cried
Heathcliff
's
stern
voice
from
the
kitchen
entrance
.
`
As
to
*NL*
staying
here
,
I
do
n't
keep
accommodations
for
visitors
:
you
must
share
a
*NL*
bed
with
Hareton
or
Joseph
,
if
you
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
sleep
on
a
chair
in
this
room
,
'
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
!
A
stranger
is
a
stranger
,
be
he
rich
or
poor
:
it
will
not
suit
*NL*
me
to
permit
any
one
the
range
of
the
place
while
I
am
off
guard
!
'
said
*NL*
the
unmannerly
wretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
insult
my
patience
was
at
an
end
.
I
uttered
an
expression
of
*NL*
disgust
,
and
pushed
past
him
into
the
yard
,
running
against
Earnshaw
in
*NL*
my
haste
.
It
was
so
dark
that
I
could
not
see
the
means
of
exit
;
and
,
as
*NL*
I
wandered
round
,
I
heard
another
specimen
of
their
civil
behaviour
*NL*
amongst
each
other
.
At
first
the
young
man
appeared
about
to
befriend
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
go
with
him
as
far
as
the
park
,
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
go
with
him
to
hell
!
'
exclaimed
his
master
,
or
whatever
relation
*NL*
he
bore
.
`
And
who
is
to
look
after
the
horses
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
man
's
life
is
of
more
consequence
than
one
evening
's
neglect
of
the
*NL*
horses
:
somebody
must
go
,
'
murmured
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
more
kindly
than
I
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
your
command
!
'
retorted
Hareton
.
`
If
you
set
store
on
him
,
you
'd
*NL*
better
be
quiet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
hope
his
ghost
will
haunt
you
;
and
I
hope
Mr.
Heathcliff
will
*NL*
never
get
another
tenant
till
the
Grange
is
a
ruin
,
'
she
answered
,
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hearken
,
hearken
,
shoo
's
cursing
on
'em
!
'
muttered
Joseph
,
towards
whom
*NL*
I
had
been
steering
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
within
earshot
,
milking
the
cows
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
,
which
*NL*
I
seized
unceremoniously
,
and
,
calling
out
that
I
would
send
it
back
on
*NL*
the
morrow
,
rushed
to
the
nearest
postern
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Maister
,
maister
,
he
's
staling
t
'
lanthern
!
'
shouted
the
ancient
,
*NL*
pursuing
my
retreat
.
`
Hey
,
Gnasher
!
Hey
,
dog
!
Hey
Wolf
,
holld
him
,
*NL*
holld
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
On
opening
the
little
door
,
two
hairy
monsters
flew
at
my
throat
,
bearing
*NL*
me
down
,
and
extinguishing
the
light
;
while
a
mingled
guffaw
from
*NL*
Heathcliff
and
Hareton
put
the
copestone
on
my
rage
and
humiliation
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
the
beasts
seemed
more
bent
on
stretching
their
paws
,
and
*NL*
yawning
,
and
flourishing
their
tails
,
than
devouring
me
alive
;
but
they
*NL*
would
suffer
no
resurrection
,
and
I
was
forced
to
lie
till
their
*NL*
malignant
masters
pleased
to
deliver
me
:
then
,
hatless
and
trembling
with
*NL*
wrath
,
I
ordered
the
miscreants
to
let
me
out
--
on
their
peril
to
keep
me
*NL*
one
minute
longer
--
with
several
incoherent
threats
of
retaliation
that
,
*NL*
in
their
indefinite
depth
of
virulency
,
smacked
of
King
Lear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vehemence
of
my
agitation
brought
on
a
copious
bleeding
at
the
nose
,
*NL*
and
still
Heathcliff
laughed
,
and
still
I
scolded
.
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
would
have
concluded
the
scene
,
had
there
not
been
one
person
at
hand
*NL*
rather
more
rational
than
myself
,
and
more
benevolent
than
my
*NL*
entertainer
.
This
was
Zillah
,
the
stout
housewife
;
who
at
length
issued
*NL*
forth
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
the
uproar
.
She
thought
that
some
of
*NL*
them
had
been
laying
violent
hands
on
me
;
and
,
not
daring
to
attack
her
*NL*
master
,
she
turned
her
vocal
artillery
against
the
younger
scoundrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
'
she
cried
,
'
I
wonder
what
you
'll
have
agait
next
?
*NL*
Are
we
going
to
murder
folk
on
our
very
door-stones
?
I
see
this
house
*NL*
will
never
do
for
me
--
look
at
t
'
poor
lad
,
he
's
fair
choking
!
Wisht
,
*NL*
wisht
;
you
mun
'n'
t
go
on
so
.
Come
in
,
and
I
'll
cure
that
:
there
now
,
*NL*
hold
ye
still
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
she
suddenly
splashed
a
pint
of
icy
water
down
my
neck
,
*NL*
and
pulled
me
into
the
kitchen
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
followed
,
his
accidental
*NL*
merriment
expiring
quickly
in
his
habitual
moroseness
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
sick
exceedingly
,
and
dizzy
,
and
faint
;
and
thus
compelled
perforce
*NL*
to
accept
lodgings
under
his
roof
.
He
told
Zillah
to
give
me
a
glass
of
*NL*
brandy
,
and
then
passed
on
to
the
inner
room
;
while
she
condoled
with
me
*NL*
on
my
sorry
predicament
,
and
having
obeyed
his
orders
,
whereby
I
was
*NL*
somewhat
revived
,
ushered
me
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
leading
the
way
upstairs
,
she
recommended
that
I
should
hide
the
*NL*
candle
,
and
not
make
a
noise
;
for
her
master
had
an
odd
notion
about
the
*NL*
chamber
she
would
put
me
in
,
and
never
let
anybody
lodge
there
willingly
.
*NL*
I
asked
the
reason
.
She
did
not
know
,
she
answered
:
she
had
only
lived
*NL*
there
a
year
or
two
;
and
they
had
so
many
queer
goings
on
,
she
could
not
*NL*
begin
to
be
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
stupefied
to
be
curious
myself
,
I
fastened
my
door
and
glanced
round
*NL*
for
the
bed
.
The
whole
furniture
consisted
of
a
chair
,
a
clothes-press
,
*NL*
and
a
large
oak
case
,
with
squares
cut
out
near
the
top
resembling
coach
*NL*
windows
.
Having
approached
this
structure
,
I
looked
inside
,
and
*NL*
perceived
it
to
be
a
singular
sort
of
old-fashioned
couch
,
very
*NL*
conveniently
designed
to
obviate
the
necessity
for
every
member
of
the
*NL*
family
having
a
room
to
himself
.
In
fact
,
it
formed
a
little
closet
,
and
*NL*
the
ledge
of
a
window
,
which
it
enclosed
,
served
as
a
table
.
I
slid
back
*NL*
the
panelled
sides
,
got
in
with
my
light
,
pulled
them
together
again
,
and
*NL*
felt
secure
against
the
vigilance
of
Heathcliff
,
and
every
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ledge
,
where
I
placed
my
candle
,
had
a
few
mildewed
books
piled
up
in
*NL*
one
corner
;
and
it
was
covered
with
writing
scratched
on
the
paint
.
This
*NL*
writing
,
however
,
was
nothing
but
a
name
repeated
in
all
kinds
of
*NL*
characters
,
large
and
small
--
_
Catherine
Earnshaw
_
,
here
and
there
varied
*NL*
to
_
Catherine
Heathcliff
_
,
and
then
again
to
_
Catherine
Linton
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vapid
listlessness
I
leant
my
head
against
the
window
,
and
continued
*NL*
spelling
over
Catherine
Earnshaw
--
Heathcliff
--
Linton
,
till
my
eyes
*NL*
closed
;
but
they
had
not
rested
five
minutes
when
a
glare
of
white
*NL*
letters
started
from
the
dark
,
as
vivid
as
spectres
--
the
air
swarmed
with
*NL*
Catherines
;
and
rousing
myself
to
dispel
the
obtrusive
name
,
I
discovered
*NL*
my
candle-wick
reclining
on
one
of
the
antique
volumes
,
and
perfuming
the
*NL*
place
with
an
odour
of
roasted
calf-skin
.
I
snuffed
it
off
,
and
,
very
*NL*
ill
at
ease
under
the
influence
of
cold
and
lingering
nausea
,
sat
up
and
*NL*
spread
open
the
injured
tome
on
my
knee
.
It
was
a
Testament
,
in
lean
*NL*
type
,
and
smelling
dreadfully
musty
:
a
fly-leaf
bore
the
*NL*
inscription
--
`
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
her
book
,
'
and
a
date
some
quarter
of
a
*NL*
century
back
.
I
shut
it
,
and
took
up
another
and
another
,
till
I
had
*NL*
examined
all
.
Catherine
's
library
was
select
,
and
its
state
of
*NL*
dilapidation
proved
it
to
have
been
well
used
,
though
not
altogether
for
*NL*
a
legitimate
purpose
:
scarcely
one
chapter
had
escaped
,
a
pen-and-ink
*NL*
commentary
--
at
least
the
appearance
of
one
--
covering
every
morsel
of
*NL*
blank
that
the
printer
had
left
.
Some
were
detached
sentences
;
other
*NL*
parts
took
the
form
of
a
regular
diary
,
scrawled
in
an
unformed
,
childish
*NL*
hand
.
At
the
top
of
an
extra
page
-LRB-
quite
a
treasure
,
probably
,
when
*NL*
first
lighted
on
-RRB-
I
was
greatly
amused
to
behold
an
excellent
caricature
*NL*
of
my
friend
Joseph
,
--
rudely
,
yet
powerfully
sketched
.
An
immediate
*NL*
interest
kindled
within
me
for
the
unknown
Catherine
,
and
I
began
*NL*
forthwith
to
decipher
her
faded
hieroglyphics
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
awful
Sunday
,
'
commenced
the
paragraph
beneath
.
'
I
wish
my
father
*NL*
were
back
again
.
Hindley
is
a
detestable
substitute
--
his
conduct
to
*NL*
Heathcliff
is
atrocious
--
H.
and
I
are
going
to
rebel
--
we
took
our
*NL*
initiatory
step
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
day
had
been
flooding
with
rain
;
we
could
not
go
to
church
,
so
*NL*
Joseph
must
needs
get
up
a
congregation
in
the
garret
;
and
,
while
Hindley
*NL*
and
his
wife
basked
downstairs
before
a
comfortable
fire
--
doing
anything
*NL*
but
reading
their
Bibles
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
--
Heathcliff
,
myself
,
and
the
*NL*
unhappy
ploughboy
were
commanded
to
take
our
prayer-books
,
and
mount
:
we
*NL*
were
ranged
in
a
row
,
on
a
sack
of
corn
,
groaning
and
shivering
,
and
*NL*
hoping
that
Joseph
would
shiver
too
,
so
that
he
might
give
us
a
short
*NL*
homily
for
his
own
sake
.
A
vain
idea
!
The
service
lasted
precisely
*NL*
three
hours
;
and
yet
my
brother
had
the
face
to
exclaim
,
when
he
saw
us
*NL*
descending
,
``
What
,
done
already
?
''
On
Sunday
evenings
we
used
to
be
*NL*
permitted
to
play
,
if
we
did
not
make
much
noise
;
now
a
mere
titter
is
*NL*
sufficient
to
send
us
into
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
forget
you
have
a
master
here
,
''
says
the
tyrant
.
``
I
'll
demolish
*NL*
the
first
who
puts
me
out
of
temper
!
I
insist
on
perfect
sobriety
and
*NL*
silence
.
Oh
,
boy
!
was
that
you
?
Frances
darling
,
pull
his
hair
as
you
*NL*
go
by
:
I
heard
him
snap
his
fingers
.
''
Frances
pulled
his
hair
heartily
,
*NL*
and
then
went
and
seated
herself
on
her
husband
's
knee
,
and
there
they
*NL*
were
,
like
two
babies
,
kissing
and
talking
nonsense
by
the
hour
--
foolish
*NL*
palaver
that
we
should
be
ashamed
of
.
We
made
ourselves
as
snug
as
our
*NL*
means
allowed
in
the
arch
of
the
dresser
.
I
had
just
fastened
our
*NL*
pinafores
together
,
and
hung
them
up
for
a
curtain
,
when
in
comes
Joseph
,
*NL*
on
an
errand
from
the
stables
.
He
tears
down
my
handiwork
,
boxes
my
*NL*
ears
,
and
croaks
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
T
'
maister
nobbut

buried
,
and
Sabbath
not
o'ered
,

and

Shame
on

sit

*NL*
down
,
ill

there

if
ye
'll
read
'em
:
sit
ye
*NL*
down
,
and
think

'
yer
sowls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Saying
this
,
he
compelled
us
so
to
square
our
positions
that
we
might
*NL*
receive
from
the
far-off
fire
a
dull
ray
to
show
us
the
text
of
the
*NL*
lumber
he
thrust
upon
us
.
I
could
not
bear
the
employment
.
I
took
my
*NL*
dingy
volume
by
the
scroop
,
and
hurled
it
into
the
dog-kennel
,
vowing
I
*NL*
hated
a
good
book
.
Heathcliff
kicked
his
to
the
same
place
.
Then
there
*NL*
was
a
hubbub
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Maister
Hindley
!
''
shouted
our
chaplain
.
``
Maister
,
coom

*NL*

It

*NL*
fair

that

Ech

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hindley
hurried
up
from
his
paradise
on
the
hearth
,
and
seizing
one
of
*NL*
us
by
the
collar
,
and
the
other
by
the
arm
,
hurled
both
into
the
*NL*
back-kitchen
;
where
,
Joseph
asseverated
,
``
owd
Nick
''
would
fetch
us
as
*NL*
sure
as
we
were
living
:
and
,
so
comforted
,
we
each
sought
a
separate
*NL*
nook
to
await
his
advent
.
I
reached
this
book
,
and
a
pot
of
ink
from
a
*NL*
shelf
,
and
pushed
the
house-door
ajar
to
give
me
light
,
and
I
have
got
*NL*
the
time
on
with
writing
for
twenty
minutes
;
but
my
companion
is
*NL*
impatient
,
and
proposes
that
we
should
appropriate
the
dairywoman
's
*NL*
cloak
,
and
have
a
scamper
on
the
moors
,
under
its
shelter
.
A
pleasant
*NL*
suggestion
--
and
then
,
if
the
surly
old
man
come
in
,
he
may
believe
his
*NL*
prophecy
verified
--
we
can
not
be
damper
,
or
colder
,
in
the
rain
than
we
*NL*
are
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
Catherine
fulfilled
her
project
,
for
the
next
sentence
took
up
*NL*
another
subject
:
she
waxed
lachrymose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
little
did
I
dream
that
Hindley
would
ever
make
me
cry
so
!
'
she
*NL*
wrote
.
`
My
head
aches
,
till
I
can
not
keep
it
on
the
pillow
;
and
still
I
*NL*
ca
n't
give
over
.
Poor
Heathcliff
!
Hindley
calls
him
a
vagabond
,
and
*NL*
wo
n't
let
him
sit
with
us
,
nor
eat
with
us
any
more
;
and
,
he
says
,
he
and
*NL*
I
must
not
play
together
,
and
threatens
to
turn
him
out
of
the
house
if
*NL*
we
break
his
orders
.
He
has
been
blaming
our
father
-LRB-
how
dared
he
?
-RRB-
for
*NL*
treating
H.
too
liberally
;
and
swears
he
will
reduce
him
to
his
right
*NL*
place
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
nod
drowsily
over
the
dim
page
:
my
eye
wandered
from
*NL*
manuscript
to
print
.
I
saw
a
red
ornamented
title
--
`
Seventy
Times
Seven
,
*NL*
and
the
First
of
the
Seventy-First
.
A
Pious
Discourse
delivered
by
the
*NL*
Reverend
Jabez
Branderham
,
in
the
Chapel
of
Gimmerden
Sough
.
'
And
while
*NL*
I
was
,
half-consciously
,
worrying
my
brain
to
guess
what
Jabez
Branderham
*NL*
would
make
of
his
subject
,
I
sank
back
in
bed
,
and
fell
asleep
.
Alas
,
*NL*
for
the
effects
of
bad
tea
and
bad
temper
!
What
else
could
it
be
that
*NL*
made
me
pass
such
a
terrible
night
?
I
do
n't
remember
another
that
I
can
*NL*
at
all
compare
with
it
since
I
was
capable
of
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
dream
,
almost
before
I
ceased
to
be
sensible
of
my
locality
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
morning
;
and
I
had
set
out
on
my
way
home
,
with
Joseph
for
*NL*
a
guide
.
The
snow
lay
yards
deep
in
our
road
;
and
,
as
we
floundered
on
,
*NL*
my
companion
wearied
me
with
constant
reproaches
that
I
had
not
brought
a
*NL*
pilgrim
's
staff
:
telling
me
that
I
could
never
get
into
the
house
without
*NL*
one
,
and
boastfully
flourishing
a
heavy-headed
cudgel
,
which
I
understood
*NL*
to
be
so
denominated
.
For
a
moment
I
considered
it
absurd
that
I
should
*NL*
need
such
a
weapon
to
gain
admittance
into
my
own
residence
.
Then
a
new
*NL*
idea
flashed
across
me
.
I
was
not
going
there
:
we
were
journeying
to
*NL*
hear
the
famous
Jabez
Branderham
preach
,
from
the
text
--
`
Seventy
Times
*NL*
Seven
;
'
and
either
Joseph
,
the
preacher
,
or
I
had
committed
the
`
First
of
*NL*
the
Seventy-First
,
'
and
were
to
be
publicly
exposed
and
excommunicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
to
the
chapel
.
I
have
passed
it
really
in
my
walks
,
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
;
it
lies
in
a
hollow
,
between
two
hills
:
an
elevated
hollow
,
near
*NL*
a
swamp
,
whose
peaty
moisture
is
said
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
*NL*
embalming
on
the
few
corpses
deposited
there
.
The
roof
has
been
kept
*NL*
whole
hitherto
;
but
as
the
clergyman
's
stipend
is
only
twenty
pounds
per
*NL*
annum
,
and
a
house
with
two
rooms
,
threatening
speedily
to
determine
into
*NL*
one
,
no
clergyman
will
undertake
the
duties
of
pastor
:
especially
as
it
*NL*
is
currently
reported
that
his
flock
would
rather
let
him
starve
than
*NL*
increase
the
living
by
one
penny
from
their
own
pockets
.
However
,
in
my
*NL*
dream
,
Jabez
had
a
full
and
attentive
congregation
;
and
he
preached
--
good
*NL*
God
!
what
a
sermon
;
divided
into
_
four
hundred
and
ninety
_
parts
,
each
*NL*
fully
equal
to
an
ordinary
address
from
the
pulpit
,
and
each
discussing
a
*NL*
separate
sin
!
Where
he
searched
for
them
,
I
can
not
tell
.
He
had
his
*NL*
private
manner
of
interpreting
the
phrase
,
and
it
seemed
necessary
the
*NL*
brother
should
sin
different
sins
on
every
occasion
.
They
were
of
the
*NL*
most
curious
character
:
odd
transgressions
that
I
never
imagined
*NL*
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
how
weary
I
grow
.
How
I
writhed
,
and
yawned
,
and
nodded
,
and
*NL*
revived
!
How
I
pinched
and
pricked
myself
,
and
rubbed
my
eyes
,
and
stood
*NL*
up
,
and
sat
down
again
,
and
nudged
Joseph
to
inform
me
if
he
would
_
ever
_
*NL*
have
done
.
I
was
condemned
to
hear
all
out
:
finally
,
he
reached
the
*NL*
'
_
First
of
the
Seventy-First
_
.
'
At
that
crisis
,
a
sudden
inspiration
*NL*
descended
on
me
;
I
was
moved
to
rise
and
denounce
Jabez
Branderham
as
the
*NL*
sinner
of
the
sin
that
no
Christian
need
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sir
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
`
sitting
here
within
these
four
walls
,
at
one
*NL*
stretch
,
I
have
endured
and
forgiven
the
four
hundred
and
ninety
heads
of
*NL*
your
discourse
.
Seventy
times
seven
times
have
I
plucked
up
my
hat
and
*NL*
been
about
to
depart
--
Seventy
times
seven
times
have
you
preposterously
*NL*
forced
me
to
resume
my
seat
.
The
four
hundred
and
ninety-first
is
too
*NL*
much
.
Fellow-martyrs
,
have
at
him
!
Drag
him
down
,
and
crush
him
to
*NL*
atoms
,
that
the
place
which
knows
him
may
know
him
no
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Thou
art
the
Man
_
!
'
cried
Jabez
,
after
a
solemn
pause
,
leaning
over
his
*NL*
cushion
.
`
Seventy
times
seven
times
didst
thou
gapingly
contort
thy
*NL*
visage
--
seventy
times
seven
did
I
take
counsel
with
my
soul
--
Lo
,
this
is
*NL*
human
weakness
:
this
also
may
be
absolved
!
The
First
of
the
*NL*
Seventy-First
is
come
.
Brethren
,
execute
upon
him
the
judgment
written
.
*NL*
Such
honour
have
all
His
saints
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
concluding
word
,
the
whole
assembly
,
exalting
their
pilgrim
's
*NL*
staves
,
rushed
round
me
in
a
body
;
and
I
,
having
no
weapon
to
raise
in
*NL*
self-defence
,
commenced
grappling
with
Joseph
,
my
nearest
and
most
*NL*
ferocious
assailant
,
for
his
.
In
the
confluence
of
the
multitude
,
*NL*
several
clubs
crossed
;
blows
,
aimed
at
me
,
fell
on
other
sconces
.
*NL*
Presently
the
whole
chapel
resounded
with
rappings
and
counter
rappings
:
*NL*
every
man
's
hand
was
against
his
neighbour
;
and
Branderham
,
unwilling
to
*NL*
remain
idle
,
poured
forth
his
zeal
in
a
shower
of
loud
taps
on
the
boards
*NL*
of
the
pulpit
,
which
responded
so
smartly
that
,
at
last
,
to
my
*NL*
unspeakable
relief
,
they
woke
me
.
And
what
was
it
that
had
suggested
the
*NL*
tremendous
tumult
?
What
had
played
Jabez
's
part
in
the
row
?
Merely
the
*NL*
branch
of
a
fir-tree
that
touched
my
lattice
as
the
blast
wailed
by
,
and
*NL*
rattled
its
dry
cones
against
the
panes
!
I
listened
doubtingly
an
*NL*
instant
;
detected
the
disturber
,
then
turned
and
dozed
,
and
dreamt
again
:
*NL*
if
possible
,
still
more
disagreeably
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
I
remembered
I
was
lying
in
the
oak
closet
,
and
I
heard
*NL*
distinctly
the
gusty
wind
,
and
the
driving
of
the
snow
;
I
heard
,
also
,
*NL*
the
fir
bough
repeat
its
teasing
sound
,
and
ascribed
it
to
the
right
*NL*
cause
:
but
it
annoyed
me
so
much
,
that
I
resolved
to
silence
it
,
if
*NL*
possible
;
and
,
I
thought
,
I
rose
and
endeavoured
to
unhasp
the
casement
.
*NL*
The
hook
was
soldered
into
the
staple
:
a
circumstance
observed
by
me
when
*NL*
awake
,
but
forgotten
.
'
I
must
stop
it
,
nevertheless
!
'
I
muttered
,
*NL*
knocking
my
knuckles
through
the
glass
,
and
stretching
an
arm
out
to
*NL*
seize
the
importunate
branch
;
instead
of
which
,
my
fingers
closed
on
the
*NL*
fingers
of
a
little
,
ice-cold
hand
!
The
intense
horror
of
nightmare
came
*NL*
over
me
:
I
tried
to
draw
back
my
arm
,
but
the
hand
clung
to
it
,
and
a
*NL*
most
melancholy
voice
sobbed
,
`
Let
me
in
--
let
me
in
!
'
`
Who
are
you
?
'
I
*NL*
asked
,
struggling
,
meanwhile
,
to
disengage
myself
.
`
Catherine
Linton
,
'
*NL*
it
replied
,
shiveringly
-LRB-
why
did
I
think
of
_
Linton
_
?
I
had
read
*NL*
_
Earnshaw
_
twenty
times
for
Linton
-RRB-
--
`
I
'm
come
home
:
I
'd
lost
my
way
on
*NL*
the
moor
!
'
As
it
spoke
,
I
discerned
,
obscurely
,
a
child
's
face
looking
*NL*
through
the
window
.
Terror
made
me
cruel
;
and
,
finding
it
useless
to
*NL*
attempt
shaking
the
creature
off
,
I
pulled
its
wrist
on
to
the
broken
*NL*
pane
,
and
rubbed
it
to
and
fro
till
the
blood
ran
down
and
soaked
the
*NL*
bedclothes
:
still
it
wailed
,
`
Let
me
in
!
'
and
maintained
its
tenacious
*NL*
gripe
,
almost
maddening
me
with
fear
.
`
How
can
I
!
'
I
said
at
length
.
*NL*
`
Let
_
me
_
go
,
if
you
want
me
to
let
you
in
!
'
The
fingers
relaxed
,
I
*NL*
snatched
mine
through
the
hole
,
hurriedly
piled
the
books
up
in
a
pyramid
*NL*
against
it
,
and
stopped
my
ears
to
exclude
the
lamentable
prayer
.
I
*NL*
seemed
to
keep
them
closed
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
yet
,
the
instant
I
*NL*
listened
again
,
there
was
the
doleful
cry
moaning
on
!
`
Begone
!
'
I
*NL*
shouted
.
`
I
'll
never
let
you
in
,
not
if
you
beg
for
twenty
years
.
'
`
It
*NL*
is
twenty
years
,
'
mourned
the
voice
:
`
twenty
years
.
I
've
been
a
waif
for
*NL*
twenty
years
!
'
Thereat
began
a
feeble
scratching
outside
,
and
the
pile
*NL*
of
books
moved
as
if
thrust
forward
.
I
tried
to
jump
up
;
but
could
not
*NL*
stir
a
limb
;
and
so
yelled
aloud
,
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
.
To
my
*NL*
confusion
,
I
discovered
the
yell
was
not
ideal
:
hasty
footsteps
*NL*
approached
my
chamber
door
;
somebody
pushed
it
open
,
with
a
vigorous
*NL*
hand
,
and
a
light
glimmered
through
the
squares
at
the
top
of
the
bed
.
I
*NL*
sat
shuddering
yet
,
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
:
the
*NL*
intruder
appeared
to
hesitate
,
and
muttered
to
himself
.
At
last
,
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
half-whisper
,
plainly
not
expecting
an
answer
,
`
Is
any
one
*NL*
here
?
'
I
considered
it
best
to
confess
my
presence
;
for
I
knew
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
accents
,
and
feared
he
might
search
further
,
if
I
kept
*NL*
quiet
.
With
this
intention
,
I
turned
and
opened
the
panels
.
I
shall
not
*NL*
soon
forget
the
effect
my
action
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
stood
near
the
entrance
,
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
;
with
a
*NL*
candle
dripping
over
his
fingers
,
and
his
face
as
white
as
the
wall
*NL*
behind
him
.
The
first
creak
of
the
oak
startled
him
like
an
electric
*NL*
shock
:
the
light
leaped
from
his
hold
to
a
distance
of
some
feet
,
and
his
*NL*
agitation
was
so
extreme
,
that
he
could
hardly
pick
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
only
your
guest
,
sir
,
'
I
called
out
,
desirous
to
spare
him
the
*NL*
humiliation
of
exposing
his
cowardice
further
.
'
I
had
the
misfortune
to
*NL*
scream
in
my
sleep
,
owing
to
a
frightful
nightmare
.
I
'm
sorry
I
*NL*
disturbed
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
God
confound
you
,
Mr.
Lockwood
!
I
wish
you
were
at
the
--
'
commenced
*NL*
my
host
,
setting
the
candle
on
a
chair
,
because
he
found
it
impossible
to
*NL*
hold
it
steady
.
`
And
who
showed
you
up
into
this
room
?
'
he
continued
,
*NL*
crushing
his
nails
into
his
palms
,
and
grinding
his
teeth
to
subdue
the
*NL*
maxillary
convulsions
.
`
Who
was
it
?
I
've
a
good
mind
to
turn
them
out
*NL*
of
the
house
this
moment
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
your
servant
Zillah
,
'
I
replied
,
flinging
myself
on
to
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
rapidly
resuming
my
garments
.
'
I
should
not
care
if
you
did
,
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
;
she
richly
deserves
it
.
I
suppose
that
she
wanted
to
get
*NL*
another
proof
that
the
place
was
haunted
,
at
my
expense
.
Well
,
it
*NL*
is
--
swarming
with
ghosts
and
goblins
!
You
have
reason
in
shutting
it
up
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
.
No
one
will
thank
you
for
a
doze
in
such
a
den
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
asked
Heathcliff
,
`
and
what
are
you
doing
?
Lie
down
*NL*
and
finish
out
the
night
,
since
you
_
are
_
here
;
but
,
for
heaven
's
sake
!
*NL*
do
n't
repeat
that
horrid
noise
:
nothing
could
excuse
it
,
unless
you
were
*NL*
having
your
throat
cut
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
the
little
fiend
had
got
in
at
the
window
,
she
probably
would
have
*NL*
strangled
me
!
'
I
returned
.
`
I
'm
not
going
to
endure
the
persecutions
of
*NL*
your
hospitable
ancestors
again
.
Was
not
the
Reverend
Jabez
Branderham
*NL*
akin
to
you
on
the
mother
's
side
?
And
that
minx
,
Catherine
Linton
,
or
*NL*
Earnshaw
,
or
however
she
was
called
--
she
must
have
been
a
*NL*
changeling
--
wicked
little
soul
!
She
told
me
she
had
been
walking
the
*NL*
earth
these
twenty
years
:
a
just
punishment
for
her
mortal
*NL*
transgressions
,
I
've
no
doubt
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
were
these
words
uttered
when
I
recollected
the
association
of
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
with
Catherine
's
name
in
the
book
,
which
had
completely
*NL*
slipped
from
my
memory
,
till
thus
awakened
.
I
blushed
at
my
*NL*
inconsideration
:
but
,
without
showing
further
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
offence
,
I
hastened
to
add
--
`
The
truth
is
,
sir
,
I
passed
the
first
part
*NL*
of
the
night
in
--
'
Here
I
stopped
afresh
--
I
was
about
to
say
`
perusing
*NL*
those
old
volumes
,
'
then
it
would
have
revealed
my
knowledge
of
their
*NL*
written
,
as
well
as
their
printed
,
contents
;
so
,
correcting
myself
,
I
*NL*
went
on
--
`
in
spelling
over
the
name
scratched
on
that
window-ledge
.
A
*NL*
monotonous
occupation
,
calculated
to
set
me
asleep
,
like
counting
,
or
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
_
can
_
you
mean
by
talking
in
this
way
to
_
me
_
!
'
thundered
*NL*
Heathcliff
with
savage
vehemence
.
`
How
--
how
_
dare
_
you
,
under
my
*NL*
roof
?
--
God
!
he
's
mad
to
speak
so
!
'
And
he
struck
his
forehead
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
know
whether
to
resent
this
language
or
pursue
my
explanation
;
*NL*
but
he
seemed
so
powerfully
affected
that
I
took
pity
and
proceeded
with
*NL*
my
dreams
;
affirming
I
had
never
heard
the
appellation
of
`
Catherine
*NL*
Linton
'
before
,
but
reading
it
often
over
produced
an
impression
which
*NL*
personified
itself
when
I
had
no
longer
my
imagination
under
control
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
gradually
fell
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
bed
,
as
I
spoke
;
*NL*
finally
sitting
down
almost
concealed
behind
it
.
I
guessed
,
however
,
by
*NL*
his
irregular
and
intercepted
breathing
,
that
he
struggled
to
vanquish
an
*NL*
excess
of
violent
emotion
.
Not
liking
to
show
him
that
I
had
heard
the
*NL*
conflict
,
I
continued
my
toilette
rather
noisily
,
looked
at
my
watch
,
and
*NL*
soliloquised
on
the
length
of
the
night
:
`
Not
three
o'clock
yet
!
I
could
*NL*
have
taken
oath
it
had
been
six
.
Time
stagnates
here
:
we
must
surely
*NL*
have
retired
to
rest
at
eight
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Always
at
nine
in
winter
,
and
rise
at
four
,
'
said
my
host
,
suppressing
a
*NL*
groan
:
and
,
as
I
fancied
,
by
the
motion
of
his
arm
's
shadow
,
dashing
a
*NL*
tear
from
his
eyes
.
`
Mr.
Lockwood
,
'
he
added
,
`
you
may
go
into
my
room
:
*NL*
you
'll
only
be
in
the
way
,
coming
down-stairs
so
early
:
and
your
childish
*NL*
outcry
has
sent
sleep
to
the
devil
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
for
me
,
too
,
'
I
replied
.
`
I
'll
walk
in
the
yard
till
daylight
,
and
*NL*
then
I
'll
be
off
;
and
you
need
not
dread
a
repetition
of
my
intrusion
.
*NL*
I
'm
now
quite
cured
of
seeking
pleasure
in
society
,
be
it
country
or
*NL*
town
.
A
sensible
man
ought
to
find
sufficient
company
in
himself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Delightful
company
!
'
muttered
Heathcliff
.
`
Take
the
candle
,
and
go
*NL*
where
you
please
.
I
shall
join
you
directly
.
Keep
out
of
the
yard
,
*NL*
though
,
the
dogs
are
unchained
;
and
the
house
--
Juno
mounts
sentinel
*NL*
there
,
and
--
nay
,
you
can
only
ramble
about
the
steps
and
passages
.
But
,
*NL*
away
with
you
!
I
'll
come
in
two
minutes
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
,
so
far
as
to
quit
the
chamber
;
when
,
ignorant
where
the
narrow
*NL*
lobbies
led
,
I
stood
still
,
and
was
witness
,
involuntarily
,
to
a
piece
of
*NL*
superstition
on
the
part
of
my
landlord
which
belied
,
oddly
,
his
apparent
*NL*
sense
.
He
got
on
to
the
bed
,
and
wrenched
open
the
lattice
,
bursting
,
as
*NL*
he
pulled
at
it
,
into
an
uncontrollable
passion
of
tears
.
`
Come
in
!
come
*NL*
in
!
'
he
sobbed
.
`
Cathy
,
do
come
.
Oh
,
do
--
_
once
_
more
!
Oh
!
my
heart
's
*NL*
darling
!
hear
me
_
this
_
time
,
Catherine
,
at
last
!
'
The
spectre
showed
a
*NL*
spectre
's
ordinary
caprice
:
it
gave
no
sign
of
being
;
but
the
snow
and
*NL*
wind
whirled
wildly
through
,
even
reaching
my
station
,
and
blowing
out
*NL*
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
anguish
in
the
gush
of
grief
that
accompanied
this
raving
,
*NL*
that
my
compassion
made
me
overlook
its
folly
,
and
I
drew
off
,
half
angry
*NL*
to
have
listened
at
all
,
and
vexed
at
having
related
my
ridiculous
*NL*
nightmare
,
since
it
produced
that
agony
;
though
_
why
_
was
beyond
my
*NL*
comprehension
.
I
descended
cautiously
to
the
lower
regions
,
and
landed
*NL*
in
the
back-kitchen
,
where
a
gleam
of
fire
,
raked
compactly
together
,
*NL*
enabled
me
to
rekindle
my
candle
.
Nothing
was
stirring
except
a
*NL*
brindled
,
grey
cat
,
which
crept
from
the
ashes
,
and
saluted
me
with
a
*NL*
querulous
mew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
benches
,
shaped
in
sections
of
a
circle
,
nearly
enclosed
the
hearth
;
*NL*
on
one
of
these
I
stretched
myself
,
and
Grimalkin
mounted
the
other
.
We
*NL*
were
both
of
us
nodding
ere
any
one
invaded
our
retreat
,
and
then
it
was
*NL*
Joseph
,
shuffling
down
a
wooden
ladder
that
vanished
in
the
roof
,
through
*NL*
a
trap
:
the
ascent
to
his
garret
,
I
suppose
.
He
cast
a
sinister
look
at
*NL*
the
little
flame
which
I
had
enticed
to
play
between
the
ribs
,
swept
the
*NL*
cat
from
its
elevation
,
and
bestowing
himself
in
the
vacancy
,
commenced
*NL*
the
operation
of
stuffing
a
three-inch
pipe
with
tobacco
.
My
presence
in
*NL*
his
sanctum
was
evidently
esteemed
a
piece
of
impudence
too
shameful
for
*NL*
remark
:
he
silently
applied
the
tube
to
his
lips
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
puffed
away
.
I
let
him
enjoy
the
luxury
unannoyed
;
and
after
sucking
out
*NL*
his
last
wreath
,
and
heaving
a
profound
sigh
,
he
got
up
,
and
departed
as
*NL*
solemnly
as
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
more
elastic
footstep
entered
next
;
and
now
I
opened
my
mouth
for
a
*NL*
`
good-morning
,
'
but
closed
it
again
,
the
salutation
unachieved
;
for
*NL*
Hareton
Earnshaw
was
performing
his
orison
_
sotto
voce
_
,
in
a
series
of
*NL*
curses
directed
against
every
object
he
touched
,
while
he
rummaged
a
*NL*
corner
for
a
spade
or
shovel
to
dig
through
the
drifts
.
He
glanced
over
*NL*
the
back
of
the
bench
,
dilating
his
nostrils
,
and
thought
as
little
of
*NL*
exchanging
civilities
with
me
as
with
my
companion
the
cat
.
I
guessed
,
*NL*
by
his
preparations
,
that
egress
was
allowed
,
and
,
leaving
my
hard
couch
,
*NL*
made
a
movement
to
follow
him
.
He
noticed
this
,
and
thrust
at
an
inner
*NL*
door
with
the
end
of
his
spade
,
intimating
by
an
inarticulate
sound
that
*NL*
there
was
the
place
where
I
must
go
,
if
I
changed
my
locality
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
opened
into
the
house
,
where
the
females
were
already
astir
;
Zillah
*NL*
urging
flakes
of
flame
up
the
chimney
with
a
colossal
bellows
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
kneeling
on
the
hearth
,
reading
a
book
by
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
blaze
.
She
held
her
hand
interposed
between
the
furnace-heat
and
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
seemed
absorbed
in
her
occupation
;
desisting
from
it
only
to
*NL*
chide
the
servant
for
covering
her
with
sparks
,
or
to
push
away
a
dog
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
that
snoozled
its
nose
overforwardly
into
her
face
.
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
see
Heathcliff
there
also
.
He
stood
by
the
fire
,
his
back
*NL*
towards
me
,
just
finishing
a
stormy
scene
with
poor
Zillah
;
who
ever
and
*NL*
anon
interrupted
her
labour
to
pluck
up
the
corner
of
her
apron
,
and
*NL*
heave
an
indignant
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
,
you
worthless
--
'
he
broke
out
as
I
entered
,
turning
to
his
*NL*
daughter-in-law
,
and
employing
an
epithet
as
harmless
as
duck
,
or
sheep
,
*NL*
but
generally
represented
by
a
dash
--
.
`
There
you
are
,
at
your
idle
*NL*
tricks
again
!
The
rest
of
them
do
earn
their
bread
--
you
live
on
my
*NL*
charity
!
Put
your
trash
away
,
and
find
something
to
do
.
You
shall
pay
*NL*
me
for
the
plague
of
having
you
eternally
in
my
sight
--
do
you
hear
,
*NL*
damnable
jade
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
put
my
trash
away
,
because
you
can
make
me
if
I
refuse
,
'
answered
*NL*
the
young
lady
,
closing
her
book
,
and
throwing
it
on
a
chair
.
`
But
I
'll
*NL*
not
do
anything
,
though
you
should
swear
your
tongue
out
,
except
what
I
*NL*
please
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
lifted
his
hand
,
and
the
speaker
sprang
to
a
safer
distance
,
*NL*
obviously
acquainted
with
its
weight
.
Having
no
desire
to
be
entertained
*NL*
by
a
cat-and-dog
combat
,
I
stepped
forward
briskly
,
as
if
eager
to
*NL*
partake
the
warmth
of
the
hearth
,
and
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
interrupted
dispute
.
Each
had
enough
decorum
to
suspend
further
*NL*
hostilities
:
Heathcliff
placed
his
fists
,
out
of
temptation
,
in
his
*NL*
pockets
;
Mrs.
Heathcliff
curled
her
lip
,
and
walked
to
a
seat
far
off
,
*NL*
where
she
kept
her
word
by
playing
the
part
of
a
statue
during
the
*NL*
remainder
of
my
stay
.
That
was
not
long
.
I
declined
joining
their
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
,
at
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
,
took
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
escaping
into
the
free
air
,
now
clear
,
and
still
,
and
cold
as
impalpable
*NL*
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlord
halloed
for
me
to
stop
ere
I
reached
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
offered
to
accompany
me
across
the
moor
.
It
was
well
he
did
,
*NL*
for
the
whole
hill-back
was
one
billowy
,
white
ocean
;
the
swells
and
*NL*
falls
not
indicating
corresponding
rises
and
depressions
in
the
ground
:
*NL*
many
pits
,
at
least
,
were
filled
to
a
level
;
and
entire
ranges
of
mounds
,
*NL*
the
refuse
of
the
quarries
,
blotted
from
the
chart
which
my
yesterday
's
*NL*
walk
left
pictured
in
my
mind
.
I
had
remarked
on
one
side
of
the
road
,
*NL*
at
intervals
of
six
or
seven
yards
,
a
line
of
upright
stones
,
continued
*NL*
through
the
whole
length
of
the
barren
:
these
were
erected
and
daubed
*NL*
with
lime
on
purpose
to
serve
as
guides
in
the
dark
,
and
also
when
a
*NL*
fall
,
like
the
present
,
confounded
the
deep
swamps
on
either
hand
with
*NL*
the
firmer
path
:
but
,
excepting
a
dirty
dot
pointing
up
here
and
there
,
*NL*
all
traces
of
their
existence
had
vanished
:
and
my
companion
found
it
*NL*
necessary
to
warn
me
frequently
to
steer
to
the
right
or
left
,
when
I
*NL*
imagined
I
was
following
,
correctly
,
the
windings
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
exchanged
little
conversation
,
and
he
halted
at
the
entrance
of
*NL*
Thrushcross
Park
,
saying
,
I
could
make
no
error
there
.
Our
adieux
were
*NL*
limited
to
a
hasty
bow
,
and
then
I
pushed
forward
,
trusting
to
my
own
*NL*
resources
;
for
the
porter
's
lodge
is
untenanted
as
yet
.
The
distance
*NL*
from
the
gate
to
the
grange
is
two
miles
;
I
believe
I
managed
to
make
it
*NL*
four
,
what
with
losing
myself
among
the
trees
,
and
sinking
up
to
the
neck
*NL*
in
snow
:
a
predicament
which
only
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
*NL*
appreciate
.
At
any
rate
,
whatever
were
my
wanderings
,
the
clock
chimed
*NL*
twelve
as
I
entered
the
house
;
and
that
gave
exactly
an
hour
for
every
*NL*
mile
of
the
usual
way
from
Wuthering
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
human
fixture
and
her
satellites
rushed
to
welcome
me
;
exclaiming
,
*NL*
tumultuously
,
they
had
completely
given
me
up
:
everybody
conjectured
that
*NL*
I
perished
last
night
;
and
they
were
wondering
how
they
must
set
about
*NL*
the
search
for
my
remains
.
I
bid
them
be
quiet
,
now
that
they
saw
me
*NL*
returned
,
and
,
benumbed
to
my
very
heart
,
I
dragged
up-stairs
;
whence
,
*NL*
after
putting
on
dry
clothes
,
and
pacing
to
and
fro
thirty
or
forty
*NL*
minutes
,
to
restore
the
animal
heat
,
I
adjourned
to
my
study
,
feeble
as
a
*NL*
kitten
:
almost
too
much
so
to
enjoy
the
cheerful
fire
and
smoking
coffee
*NL*
which
the
servant
had
prepared
for
my
refreshment
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
vain
weathercocks
we
are
!
I
,
who
had
determined
to
hold
myself
*NL*
independent
of
all
social
intercourse
,
and
thanked
my
stars
that
,
at
*NL*
length
,
I
had
lighted
on
a
spot
where
it
was
next
to
impracticable
--
I
,
*NL*
weak
wretch
,
after
maintaining
till
dusk
a
struggle
with
low
spirits
and
*NL*
solitude
,
was
finally
compelled
to
strike
my
colours
;
and
under
pretence
*NL*
of
gaining
information
concerning
the
necessities
of
my
establishment
,
I
*NL*
desired
Mrs.
Dean
,
when
she
brought
in
supper
,
to
sit
down
while
I
ate
*NL*
it
;
hoping
sincerely
she
would
prove
a
regular
gossip
,
and
either
rouse
*NL*
me
to
animation
or
lull
me
to
sleep
by
her
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
lived
here
a
considerable
time
,
'
I
commenced
;
`
did
you
not
say
*NL*
sixteen
years
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eighteen
,
sir
:
I
came
when
the
mistress
was
married
,
to
wait
on
her
;
*NL*
after
she
died
,
the
master
retained
me
for
his
housekeeper
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
ensued
a
pause
.
She
was
not
a
gossip
,
I
feared
;
unless
about
her
*NL*
own
affairs
,
and
those
could
hardly
interest
me
.
However
,
having
studied
*NL*
for
an
interval
,
with
a
fist
on
either
knee
,
and
a
cloud
of
meditation
*NL*
over
her
ruddy
countenance
,
she
ejaculated
--
`
Ah
,
times
are
greatly
*NL*
changed
since
then
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
I
remarked
,
`
you
've
seen
a
good
many
alterations
,
I
suppose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
:
and
troubles
too
,
'
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
'll
turn
the
talk
on
my
landlord
's
family
!
'
I
thought
to
myself
.
'
A
*NL*
good
subject
to
start
!
And
that
pretty
girl-widow
,
I
should
like
to
know
*NL*
her
history
:
whether
she
be
a
native
of
the
country
,
or
,
as
is
more
*NL*
probable
,
an
exotic
that
the
surly
_
indigenae
_
will
not
recognise
for
*NL*
kin
.
'
With
this
intention
I
asked
Mrs.
Dean
why
Heathcliff
let
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
preferred
living
in
a
situation
and
residence
so
*NL*
much
inferior
.
`
Is
he
not
rich
enough
to
keep
the
estate
in
good
order
?
'
*NL*
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rich
,
sir
!
'
she
returned
.
`
He
has
nobody
knows
what
money
,
and
every
*NL*
year
it
increases
.
Yes
,
yes
,
he
's
rich
enough
to
live
in
a
finer
house
*NL*
than
this
:
but
he
's
very
near
--
close-handed
;
and
,
if
he
had
meant
to
flit
*NL*
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
a
good
tenant
he
could
not
*NL*
have
borne
to
miss
the
chance
of
getting
a
few
hundreds
more
.
It
is
*NL*
strange
people
should
be
so
greedy
,
when
they
are
alone
in
the
world
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
a
son
,
it
seems
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
he
had
one
--
he
is
dead
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
that
young
lady
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
is
his
widow
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
did
she
come
from
originally
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
sir
,
she
is
my
late
master
's
daughter
:
Catherine
Linton
was
her
*NL*
maiden
name
.
I
nursed
her
,
poor
thing
!
I
did
wish
Mr.
Heathcliff
would
*NL*
remove
here
,
and
then
we
might
have
been
together
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
Catherine
Linton
?
'
I
exclaimed
,
astonished
.
But
a
minute
's
*NL*
reflection
convinced
me
it
was
not
my
ghostly
Catherine
.
`
Then
,
'
I
*NL*
continued
,
`
my
predecessor
's
name
was
Linton
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
who
is
that
Earnshaw
:
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
who
lives
with
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
?
Are
they
relations
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
he
is
the
late
Mrs.
Linton
's
nephew
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
young
lady
's
cousin
,
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
and
her
husband
was
her
cousin
also
:
one
on
the
mother
's
,
the
other
*NL*
on
the
father
's
side
:
Heathcliff
married
Mr.
Linton
's
sister
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
the
house
at
Wuthering
Heights
has
``
Earnshaw
''
carved
over
the
*NL*
front
door
.
Are
they
an
old
family
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
old
,
sir
;
and
Hareton
is
the
last
of
them
,
as
our
Miss
Cathy
is
of
*NL*
us
--
I
mean
,
of
the
Lintons
.
Have
you
been
to
Wuthering
Heights
?
I
beg
*NL*
pardon
for
asking
;
but
I
should
like
to
hear
how
she
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Heathcliff
?
she
looked
very
well
,
and
very
handsome
;
yet
,
I
think
,
*NL*
not
very
happy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
dear
,
I
do
n't
wonder
!
And
how
did
you
like
the
master
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
rough
fellow
,
rather
,
Mrs.
Dean
.
Is
not
that
his
character
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Rough
as
a
saw-edge
,
and
hard
as
whinstone
!
The
less
you
meddle
with
*NL*
him
the
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
must
have
had
some
ups
and
downs
in
life
to
make
him
such
a
churl
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
anything
of
his
history
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
cuckoo
's
,
sir
--
I
know
all
about
it
:
except
where
he
was
born
,
and
*NL*
who
were
his
parents
,
and
how
he
got
his
money
at
first
.
And
Hareton
has
*NL*
been
cast
out
like
an
unfledged
dunnock
!
The
unfortunate
lad
is
the
only
*NL*
one
in
all
this
parish
that
does
not
guess
how
he
has
been
cheated
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
it
will
be
a
charitable
deed
to
tell
me
something
of
my
*NL*
neighbours
:
I
feel
I
shall
not
rest
if
I
go
to
bed
;
so
be
good
enough
to
*NL*
sit
and
chat
an
hour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
certainly
,
sir
!
I
'll
just
fetch
a
little
sewing
,
and
then
I
'll
sit
*NL*
as
long
as
you
please
.
But
you
've
caught
cold
:
I
saw
you
shivering
,
and
*NL*
you
must
have
some
gruel
to
drive
it
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
worthy
woman
bustled
off
,
and
I
crouched
nearer
the
fire
;
my
head
*NL*
felt
hot
,
and
the
rest
of
me
chill
:
moreover
,
I
was
excited
,
almost
to
a
*NL*
pitch
of
foolishness
,
through
my
nerves
and
brain
.
This
caused
me
to
*NL*
feel
,
not
uncomfortable
,
but
rather
fearful
-LRB-
as
I
am
still
-RRB-
of
serious
*NL*
effects
from
the
incidents
of
to-day
and
yesterday
.
She
returned
*NL*
presently
,
bringing
a
smoking
basin
and
a
basket
of
work
;
and
,
having
*NL*
placed
the
former
on
the
hob
,
drew
in
her
seat
,
evidently
pleased
to
find
*NL*
me
so
companionable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
came
to
live
here
,
she
commenced
--
waiting
no
farther
invitation
*NL*
to
her
story
--
I
was
almost
always
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
because
my
mother
*NL*
had
nursed
Mr.
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
that
was
Hareton
's
father
,
and
I
got
*NL*
used
to
playing
with
the
children
:
I
ran
errands
too
,
and
helped
to
make
*NL*
hay
,
and
hung
about
the
farm
ready
for
anything
that
anybody
would
set
me
*NL*
to
.
One
fine
summer
morning
--
it
was
the
beginning
of
harvest
,
I
*NL*
remember
--
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
the
old
master
,
came
down-stairs
,
dressed
for
a
*NL*
journey
;
and
,
after
he
had
told
Joseph
what
was
to
be
done
during
the
*NL*
day
,
he
turned
to
Hindley
,
and
Cathy
,
and
me
--
for
I
sat
eating
my
*NL*
porridge
with
them
--
and
he
said
,
speaking
to
his
son
,
`
Now
,
my
bonny
man
,
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
Liverpool
to-day
,
what
shall
I
bring
you
?
You
may
choose
*NL*
what
you
like
:
only
let
it
be
little
,
for
I
shall
walk
there
and
back
:
*NL*
sixty
miles
each
way
,
that
is
a
long
spell
!
'
Hindley
named
a
fiddle
,
and
*NL*
then
he
asked
Miss
Cathy
;
she
was
hardly
six
years
old
,
but
she
could
*NL*
ride
any
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
she
chose
a
whip
.
He
did
not
forget
*NL*
me
;
for
he
had
a
kind
heart
,
though
he
was
rather
severe
sometimes
.
He
*NL*
promised
to
bring
me
a
pocketful
of
apples
and
pears
,
and
then
he
kissed
*NL*
his
children
,
said
good-bye
,
and
set
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
a
long
while
to
us
all
--
the
three
days
of
his
absence
--
and
*NL*
often
did
little
Cathy
ask
when
he
would
be
home
.
Mrs.
Earnshaw
expected
*NL*
him
by
supper-time
on
the
third
evening
,
and
she
put
the
meal
off
hour
*NL*
after
hour
;
there
were
no
signs
of
his
coming
,
however
,
and
at
last
the
*NL*
children
got
tired
of
running
down
to
the
gate
to
look
.
Then
it
grew
*NL*
dark
;
she
would
have
had
them
to
bed
,
but
they
begged
sadly
to
be
allowed
*NL*
to
stay
up
;
and
,
just
about
eleven
o'clock
,
the
door-latch
was
raised
*NL*
quietly
,
and
in
stepped
the
master
.
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
*NL*
laughing
and
groaning
,
and
bid
them
all
stand
off
,
for
he
was
nearly
*NL*
killed
--
he
would
not
have
such
another
walk
for
the
three
kingdoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
at
the
end
of
it
to
be
flighted
to
death
!
'
he
said
,
opening
his
*NL*
great-coat
,
which
he
held
bundled
up
in
his
arms
.
`
See
here
,
wife
!
I
*NL*
was
never
so
beaten
with
anything
in
my
life
:
but
you
must
e
`
en
take
it
*NL*
as
a
gift
of
God
;
though
it
's
as
dark
almost
as
if
it
came
from
the
*NL*
devil
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
crowded
round
,
and
over
Miss
Cathy
's
head
I
had
a
peep
at
a
dirty
,
*NL*
ragged
,
black-haired
child
;
big
enough
both
to
walk
and
talk
:
indeed
,
its
*NL*
face
looked
older
than
Catherine
's
;
yet
when
it
was
set
on
its
feet
,
it
*NL*
only
stared
round
,
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
some
gibberish
that
*NL*
nobody
could
understand
.
I
was
frightened
,
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
was
ready
*NL*
to
fling
it
out
of
doors
:
she
did
fly
up
,
asking
how
he
could
fashion
to
*NL*
bring
that
gipsy
brat
into
the
house
,
when
they
had
their
own
bairns
to
*NL*
feed
and
fend
for
?
What
he
meant
to
do
with
it
,
and
whether
he
were
mad
?
*NL*
The
master
tried
to
explain
the
matter
;
but
he
was
really
half
dead
with
*NL*
fatigue
,
and
all
that
I
could
make
out
,
amongst
her
scolding
,
was
a
tale
*NL*
of
his
seeing
it
starving
,
and
houseless
,
and
as
good
as
dumb
,
in
the
*NL*
streets
of
Liverpool
,
where
he
picked
it
up
and
inquired
for
its
owner
.
*NL*
Not
a
soul
knew
to
whom
it
belonged
,
he
said
;
and
his
money
and
time
*NL*
being
both
limited
,
he
thought
it
better
to
take
it
home
with
him
at
*NL*
once
,
than
run
into
vain
expenses
there
:
because
he
was
determined
he
*NL*
would
not
leave
it
as
he
found
it
.
Well
,
the
conclusion
was
,
that
my
*NL*
mistress
grumbled
herself
calm
;
and
Mr.
Earnshaw
told
me
to
wash
it
,
and
*NL*
give
it
clean
things
,
and
let
it
sleep
with
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hindley
and
Cathy
contented
themselves
with
looking
and
listening
till
*NL*
peace
was
restored
:
then
,
both
began
searching
their
father
's
pockets
*NL*
for
the
presents
he
had
promised
them
.
The
former
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
,
*NL*
but
when
he
drew
out
what
had
been
a
fiddle
,
crushed
to
morsels
in
the
*NL*
great-coat
,
he
blubbered
aloud
;
and
Cathy
,
when
she
learned
the
master
*NL*
had
lost
her
whip
in
attending
on
the
stranger
,
showed
her
humour
by
*NL*
grinning
and
spitting
at
the
stupid
little
thing
;
earning
for
her
pains
*NL*
a
sound
blow
from
her
father
,
to
teach
her
cleaner
manners
.
They
*NL*
entirely
refused
to
have
it
in
bed
with
them
,
or
even
in
their
room
;
and
*NL*
I
had
no
more
sense
,
so
I
put
it
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
,
hoping
it
*NL*
might
be
gone
on
the
morrow
.
By
chance
,
or
else
attracted
by
hearing
his
*NL*
voice
,
it
crept
to
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
door
,
and
there
he
found
it
on
*NL*
quitting
his
chamber
.
Inquiries
were
made
as
to
how
it
got
there
;
I
was
*NL*
obliged
to
confess
,
and
in
recompense
for
my
cowardice
and
inhumanity
*NL*
was
sent
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Heathcliff
's
first
introduction
to
the
family
.
On
coming
back
a
*NL*
few
days
afterwards
-LRB-
for
I
did
not
consider
my
banishment
perpetual
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
found
they
had
christened
him
`
Heathcliff
'
:
it
was
the
name
of
a
son
who
*NL*
died
in
childhood
,
and
it
has
served
him
ever
since
,
both
for
Christian
*NL*
and
surname
.
Miss
Cathy
and
he
were
now
very
thick
;
but
Hindley
hated
*NL*
him
:
and
to
say
the
truth
I
did
the
same
;
and
we
plagued
and
went
on
with
*NL*
him
shamefully
:
for
I
was
n't
reasonable
enough
to
feel
my
injustice
,
and
*NL*
the
mistress
never
put
in
a
word
on
his
behalf
when
she
saw
him
wronged
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
a
sullen
,
patient
child
;
hardened
,
perhaps
,
to
ill-treatment
:
*NL*
he
would
stand
Hindley
's
blows
without
winking
or
shedding
a
tear
,
and
my
*NL*
pinches
moved
him
only
to
draw
in
a
breath
and
open
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
*NL*
had
hurt
himself
by
accident
,
and
nobody
was
to
blame
.
This
endurance
*NL*
made
old
Earnshaw
furious
,
when
he
discovered
his
son
persecuting
the
*NL*
poor
fatherless
child
,
as
he
called
him
.
He
took
to
Heathcliff
*NL*
strangely
,
believing
all
he
said
-LRB-
for
that
matter
,
he
said
precious
*NL*
little
,
and
generally
the
truth
-RRB-
,
and
petting
him
up
far
above
Cathy
,
who
*NL*
was
too
mischievous
and
wayward
for
a
favourite
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
he
bred
bad
feeling
in
the
house
;
and
at
*NL*
Mrs.
Earnshaw
's
death
,
which
happened
in
less
than
two
years
after
,
the
*NL*
young
master
had
learned
to
regard
his
father
as
an
oppressor
rather
than
*NL*
a
friend
,
and
Heathcliff
as
a
usurper
of
his
parent
's
affections
and
his
*NL*
privileges
;
and
he
grew
bitter
with
brooding
over
these
injuries
.
I
*NL*
sympathised
a
while
;
but
when
the
children
fell
ill
of
the
measles
,
and
I
*NL*
had
to
tend
them
,
and
take
on
me
the
cares
of
a
woman
at
once
,
I
changed
*NL*
my
idea
.
Heathcliff
was
dangerously
sick
;
and
while
he
lay
at
the
worst
*NL*
he
would
have
me
constantly
by
his
pillow
:
I
suppose
he
felt
I
did
a
good
*NL*
deal
for
him
,
and
he
had
n't
wit
to
guess
that
I
was
compelled
to
do
it
.
*NL*
However
,
I
will
say
this
,
he
was
the
quietest
child
that
ever
nurse
*NL*
watched
over
.
The
difference
between
him
and
the
others
forced
me
to
be
*NL*
less
partial
.
Cathy
and
her
brother
harassed
me
terribly
:
he
was
as
*NL*
uncomplaining
as
a
lamb
;
though
hardness
,
not
gentleness
,
made
him
give
*NL*
little
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
through
,
and
the
doctor
affirmed
it
was
in
a
great
measure
owing
*NL*
to
me
,
and
praised
me
for
my
care
.
I
was
vain
of
his
commendations
,
and
*NL*
softened
towards
the
being
by
whose
means
I
earned
them
,
and
thus
Hindley
*NL*
lost
his
last
ally
:
still
I
could
n't
dote
on
Heathcliff
,
and
I
wondered
*NL*
often
what
my
master
saw
to
admire
so
much
in
the
sullen
boy
;
who
never
,
*NL*
to
my
recollection
,
repaid
his
indulgence
by
any
sign
of
gratitude
.
He
*NL*
was
not
insolent
to
his
benefactor
,
he
was
simply
insensible
;
though
*NL*
knowing
perfectly
the
hold
he
had
on
his
heart
,
and
conscious
he
had
only
*NL*
to
speak
and
all
the
house
would
be
obliged
to
bend
to
his
wishes
.
As
an
*NL*
instance
,
I
remember
Mr.
Earnshaw
once
bought
a
couple
of
colts
at
the
*NL*
parish
fair
,
and
gave
the
lads
each
one
.
Heathcliff
took
the
handsomest
,
*NL*
but
it
soon
fell
lame
,
and
when
he
discovered
it
,
he
said
to
Hindley
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
exchange
horses
with
me
:
I
do
n't
like
mine
;
and
if
you
wo
n't
I
*NL*
shall
tell
your
father
of
the
three
thrashings
you
've
given
me
this
week
,
*NL*
and
show
him
my
arm
,
which
is
black
to
the
shoulder
.
'
Hindley
put
out
*NL*
his
tongue
,
and
cuffed
him
over
the
ears
.
`
You
'd
better
do
it
at
once
,
'
*NL*
he
persisted
,
escaping
to
the
porch
-LRB-
they
were
in
the
stable
-RRB-
:
`
you
will
*NL*
have
to
:
and
if
I
speak
of
these
blows
,
you
'll
get
them
again
with
*NL*
interest
.
'
`
Off
,
dog
!
'
cried
Hindley
,
threatening
him
with
an
iron
*NL*
weight
used
for
weighing
potatoes
and
hay
.
`
Throw
it
,
'
he
replied
,
*NL*
standing
still
,
`
and
then
I
'll
tell
how
you
boasted
that
you
would
turn
*NL*
me
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
he
died
,
and
see
whether
he
will
not
turn
you
*NL*
out
directly
.
'
Hindley
threw
it
,
hitting
him
on
the
breast
,
and
down
he
*NL*
fell
,
but
staggered
up
immediately
,
breathless
and
white
;
and
,
had
not
I
*NL*
prevented
it
,
he
would
have
gone
just
so
to
the
master
,
and
got
full
*NL*
revenge
by
letting
his
condition
plead
for
him
,
intimating
who
had
caused
*NL*
it
.
`
Take
my
colt
,
Gipsy
,
then
!
'
said
young
Earnshaw
.
`
And
I
pray
that
*NL*
he
may
break
your
neck
:
take
him
,
and
be
damned
,
you
beggarly
interloper
!
*NL*
and
wheedle
my
father
out
of
all
he
has
:
only
afterwards
show
him
what
*NL*
you
are
,
imp
of
Satan
.
--
And
take
that
,
I
hope
he
'll
kick
out
your
*NL*
brains
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
had
gone
to
loose
the
beast
,
and
shift
it
to
his
own
stall
;
he
*NL*
was
passing
behind
it
,
when
Hindley
finished
his
speech
by
knocking
him
*NL*
under
its
feet
,
and
without
stopping
to
examine
whether
his
hopes
were
*NL*
fulfilled
,
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
.
I
was
surprised
to
witness
how
*NL*
coolly
the
child
gathered
himself
up
,
and
went
on
with
his
intention
;
*NL*
exchanging
saddles
and
all
,
and
then
sitting
down
on
a
bundle
of
hay
to
*NL*
overcome
the
qualm
which
the
violent
blow
occasioned
,
before
he
entered
*NL*
the
house
.
I
persuaded
him
easily
to
let
me
lay
the
blame
of
his
bruises
*NL*
on
the
horse
:
he
minded
little
what
tale
was
told
since
he
had
what
he
*NL*
wanted
.
He
complained
so
seldom
,
indeed
,
of
such
stirs
as
these
,
that
I
*NL*
really
thought
him
not
vindictive
:
I
was
deceived
completely
,
as
you
will
*NL*
hear
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
time
Mr.
Earnshaw
began
to
fail
.
He
had
been
active
and
*NL*
healthy
,
yet
his
strength
left
him
suddenly
;
and
when
he
was
confined
to
*NL*
the
chimney-corner
he
grew
grievously
irritable
.
A
nothing
vexed
him
;
*NL*
and
suspected
slights
of
his
authority
nearly
threw
him
into
fits
.
This
*NL*
was
especially
to
be
remarked
if
any
one
attempted
to
impose
upon
,
or
*NL*
domineer
over
,
his
favourite
:
he
was
painfully
jealous
lest
a
word
*NL*
should
be
spoken
amiss
to
him
;
seeming
to
have
got
into
his
head
the
*NL*
notion
that
,
because
he
liked
Heathcliff
,
all
hated
,
and
longed
to
do
*NL*
him
an
ill-turn
.
It
was
a
disadvantage
to
the
lad
;
for
the
kinder
among
*NL*
us
did
not
wish
to
fret
the
master
,
so
we
humoured
his
partiality
;
and
*NL*
that
humouring
was
rich
nourishment
to
the
child
's
pride
and
black
*NL*
tempers
.
Still
it
became
in
a
manner
necessary
;
twice
,
or
thrice
,
*NL*
Hindley
's
manifestation
of
scorn
,
while
his
father
was
near
,
roused
the
*NL*
old
man
to
a
fury
:
he
seized
his
stick
to
strike
him
,
and
shook
with
*NL*
rage
that
he
could
not
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
our
curate
-LRB-
we
had
a
curate
then
who
made
the
living
answer
by
*NL*
teaching
the
little
Lintons
and
Earnshaws
,
and
farming
his
bit
of
land
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
advised
that
the
young
man
should
be
sent
to
college
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Earnshaw
agreed
,
though
with
a
heavy
spirit
,
for
he
said
--
`
Hindley
was
*NL*
nought
,
and
would
never
thrive
as
where
he
wandered
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
hoped
heartily
we
should
have
peace
now
.
It
hurt
me
to
think
the
*NL*
master
should
be
made
uncomfortable
by
his
own
good
deed
.
I
fancied
the
*NL*
discontent
of
age
and
disease
arose
from
his
family
disagreements
;
as
he
*NL*
would
have
it
that
it
did
:
really
,
you
know
,
sir
,
it
was
in
his
sinking
*NL*
frame
.
We
might
have
got
on
tolerably
,
notwithstanding
,
but
for
two
*NL*
people
--
Miss
Cathy
,
and
Joseph
,
the
servant
:
you
saw
him
,
I
daresay
,
up
*NL*
yonder
.
He
was
,
and
is
yet
most
likely
,
the
wearisomest
self-righteous
*NL*
Pharisee
that
ever
ransacked
a
Bible
to
rake
the
promises
to
himself
and
*NL*
fling
the
curses
to
his
neighbours
.
By
his
knack
of
sermonising
and
*NL*
pious
discoursing
,
he
contrived
to
make
a
great
impression
on
Mr.
*NL*
Earnshaw
;
and
the
more
feeble
the
master
became
,
the
more
influence
he
*NL*
gained
.
He
was
relentless
in
worrying
him
about
his
soul
's
concerns
,
and
*NL*
about
ruling
his
children
rigidly
.
He
encouraged
him
to
regard
Hindley
*NL*
as
a
reprobate
;
and
,
night
after
night
,
he
regularly
grumbled
out
a
long
*NL*
string
of
tales
against
Heathcliff
and
Catherine
:
always
minding
to
*NL*
flatter
Earnshaw
's
weakness
by
heaping
the
heaviest
blame
on
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
she
had
ways
with
her
such
as
I
never
saw
a
child
take
up
*NL*
before
;
and
she
put
all
of
us
past
our
patience
fifty
times
and
oftener
*NL*
in
a
day
:
from
the
hour
she
came
down-stairs
till
the
hour
she
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
we
had
not
a
minute
's
security
that
she
would
n't
be
in
mischief
.
Her
*NL*
spirits
were
always
at
high-water
mark
,
her
tongue
always
going
--
singing
,
*NL*
laughing
,
and
plaguing
everybody
who
would
not
do
the
same
.
A
wild
,
*NL*
wicked
slip
she
was
--
but
she
had
the
bonniest
eye
,
the
sweetest
smile
,
*NL*
and
lightest
foot
in
the
parish
:
and
,
after
all
,
I
believe
she
meant
no
*NL*
harm
;
for
when
once
she
made
you
cry
in
good
earnest
,
it
seldom
happened
*NL*
that
she
would
not
keep
you
company
,
and
oblige
you
to
be
quiet
that
you
*NL*
might
comfort
her
.
She
was
much
too
fond
of
Heathcliff
.
The
greatest
*NL*
punishment
we
could
invent
for
her
was
to
keep
her
separate
from
him
:
yet
*NL*
she
got
chided
more
than
any
of
us
on
his
account
.
In
play
,
she
liked
*NL*
exceedingly
to
act
the
little
mistress
;
using
her
hands
freely
,
and
*NL*
commanding
her
companions
:
she
did
so
to
me
,
but
I
would
not
bear
*NL*
slapping
and
ordering
;
and
so
I
let
her
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
did
not
understand
jokes
from
his
children
:
he
had
*NL*
always
been
strict
and
grave
with
them
;
and
Catherine
,
on
her
part
,
had
*NL*
no
idea
why
her
father
should
be
crosser
and
less
patient
in
his
ailing
*NL*
condition
than
he
was
in
his
prime
.
His
peevish
reproofs
wakened
in
her
*NL*
a
naughty
delight
to
provoke
him
:
she
was
never
so
happy
as
when
we
were
*NL*
all
scolding
her
at
once
,
and
she
defying
us
with
her
bold
,
saucy
look
,
*NL*
and
her
ready
words
;
turning
Joseph
's
religious
curses
into
ridicule
,
*NL*
baiting
me
,
and
doing
just
what
her
father
hated
most
--
showing
how
her
*NL*
pretended
insolence
,
which
he
thought
real
,
had
more
power
over
*NL*
Heathcliff
than
his
kindness
:
how
the
boy
would
do
_
her
_
bidding
in
*NL*
anything
,
and
_
his
_
only
when
it
suited
his
own
inclination
.
After
*NL*
behaving
as
badly
as
possible
all
day
,
she
sometimes
came
fondling
to
*NL*
make
it
up
at
night
.
`
Nay
,
Cathy
,
'
the
old
man
would
say
,
'
I
can
not
love
*NL*
thee
,
thou
`
rt
worse
than
thy
brother
.
Go
,
say
thy
prayers
,
child
,
and
*NL*
ask
God
's
pardon
.
I
doubt
thy
mother
and
I
must
rue
that
we
ever
reared
*NL*
thee
!
'
That
made
her
cry
,
at
first
;
and
then
being
repulsed
continually
*NL*
hardened
her
,
and
she
laughed
if
I
told
her
to
say
she
was
sorry
for
her
*NL*
faults
,
and
beg
to
be
forgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
hour
came
,
at
last
,
that
ended
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
troubles
on
earth
.
*NL*
He
died
quietly
in
his
chair
one
October
evening
,
seated
by
the
*NL*
fire-side
.
A
high
wind
blustered
round
the
house
,
and
roared
in
the
*NL*
chimney
:
it
sounded
wild
and
stormy
,
yet
it
was
not
cold
,
and
we
were
all
*NL*
together
--
I
,
a
little
removed
from
the
hearth
,
busy
at
my
knitting
,
and
*NL*
Joseph
reading
his
Bible
near
the
table
-LRB-
for
the
servants
generally
sat
*NL*
in
the
house
then
,
after
their
work
was
done
-RRB-
.
Miss
Cathy
had
been
sick
,
*NL*
and
that
made
her
still
;
she
leant
against
her
father
's
knee
,
and
*NL*
Heathcliff
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
head
in
her
lap
.
I
remember
*NL*
the
master
,
before
he
fell
into
a
doze
,
stroking
her
bonny
hair
--
it
*NL*
pleased
him
rarely
to
see
her
gentle
--
and
saying
,
`
Why
canst
thou
not
*NL*
always
be
a
good
lass
,
Cathy
?
'
And
she
turned
her
face
up
to
his
,
and
*NL*
laughed
,
and
answered
,
`
Why
can
not
you
always
be
a
good
man
,
father
?
'
But
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
vexed
again
,
she
kissed
his
hand
,
and
said
she
*NL*
would
sing
him
to
sleep
.
She
began
singing
very
low
,
till
his
fingers
*NL*
dropped
from
hers
,
and
his
head
sank
on
his
breast
.
Then
I
told
her
to
*NL*
hush
,
and
not
stir
,
for
fear
she
should
wake
him
.
We
all
kept
as
mute
as
*NL*
mice
a
full
half-hour
,
and
should
have
done
so
longer
,
only
Joseph
,
*NL*
having
finished
his
chapter
,
got
up
and
said
that
he
must
rouse
the
*NL*
master
for
prayers
and
bed
.
He
stepped
forward
,
and
called
him
by
name
,
*NL*
and
touched
his
shoulder
;
but
he
would
not
move
:
so
he
took
the
candle
*NL*
and
looked
at
him
.
I
thought
there
was
something
wrong
as
he
set
down
*NL*
the
light
;
and
seizing
the
children
each
by
an
arm
,
whispered
them
to
*NL*
`
frame
up-stairs
,
and
make
little
din
--
they
might
pray
alone
that
*NL*
evening
--
he
had
summut
to
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
bid
father
good-night
first
,
'
said
Catherine
,
putting
her
arms
*NL*
round
his
neck
,
before
we
could
hinder
her
.
The
poor
thing
discovered
*NL*
her
loss
directly
--
she
screamed
out
--
`
Oh
,
he
's
dead
,
Heathcliff
!
he
's
*NL*
dead
!
'
And
they
both
set
up
a
heart-breaking
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
joined
my
wail
to
theirs
,
loud
and
bitter
;
but
Joseph
asked
what
we
*NL*
could
be
thinking
of
to
roar
in
that
way
over
a
saint
in
heaven
.
He
told
*NL*
me
to
put
on
my
cloak
and
run
to
Gimmerton
for
the
doctor
and
the
parson
.
*NL*
I
could
not
guess
the
use
that
either
would
be
of
,
then
.
However
,
I
*NL*
went
,
through
wind
and
rain
,
and
brought
one
,
the
doctor
,
back
with
me
;
*NL*
the
other
said
he
would
come
in
the
morning
.
Leaving
Joseph
to
explain
*NL*
matters
,
I
ran
to
the
children
's
room
:
their
door
was
ajar
,
I
saw
they
*NL*
had
never
lain
down
,
though
it
was
past
midnight
;
but
they
were
calmer
,
*NL*
and
did
not
need
me
to
console
them
.
The
little
souls
were
comforting
*NL*
each
other
with
better
thoughts
than
I
could
have
hit
on
:
no
parson
in
*NL*
the
world
ever
pictured
heaven
so
beautifully
as
they
did
,
in
their
*NL*
innocent
talk
;
and
,
while
I
sobbed
and
listened
,
I
could
not
help
wishing
*NL*
we
were
all
there
safe
together
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hindley
came
home
to
the
funeral
;
and
--
a
thing
that
amazed
us
,
and
*NL*
set
the
neighbours
gossiping
right
and
left
--
he
brought
a
wife
with
him
.
*NL*
What
she
was
,
and
where
she
was
born
,
he
never
informed
us
:
probably
,
she
*NL*
had
neither
money
nor
name
to
recommend
her
,
or
he
would
scarcely
have
*NL*
kept
the
union
from
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
one
that
would
have
disturbed
the
house
much
on
her
own
*NL*
account
.
Every
object
she
saw
,
the
moment
she
crossed
the
threshold
,
*NL*
appeared
to
delight
her
;
and
every
circumstance
that
took
place
about
*NL*
her
:
except
the
preparing
for
the
burial
,
and
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
mourners
.
I
thought
she
was
half
silly
,
from
her
behaviour
while
that
*NL*
went
on
:
she
ran
into
her
chamber
,
and
made
me
come
with
her
,
though
I
*NL*
should
have
been
dressing
the
children
:
and
there
she
sat
shivering
and
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
,
and
asking
repeatedly
--
`
Are
they
gone
yet
?
'
Then
she
*NL*
began
describing
with
hysterical
emotion
the
effect
it
produced
on
her
to
*NL*
see
black
;
and
started
,
and
trembled
,
and
,
at
last
,
fell
a-weeping
--
and
*NL*
when
I
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
answered
,
she
did
n't
know
;
but
she
felt
*NL*
so
afraid
of
dying
!
I
imagined
her
as
little
likely
to
die
as
myself
.
*NL*
She
was
rather
thin
,
but
young
,
and
fresh-complexioned
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
as
bright
as
diamonds
.
I
did
remark
,
to
be
sure
,
that
mounting
*NL*
the
stairs
made
her
breathe
very
quick
;
that
the
least
sudden
noise
set
*NL*
her
all
in
a
quiver
,
and
that
she
coughed
troublesomely
sometimes
:
but
I
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
what
these
symptoms
portended
,
and
had
no
impulse
to
*NL*
sympathise
with
her
.
We
do
n't
in
general
take
to
foreigners
here
,
Mr.
*NL*
Lockwood
,
unless
they
take
to
us
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Earnshaw
was
altered
considerably
in
the
three
years
of
his
*NL*
absence
.
He
had
grown
sparer
,
and
lost
his
colour
,
and
spoke
and
dressed
*NL*
quite
differently
;
and
,
on
the
very
day
of
his
return
,
he
told
Joseph
*NL*
and
me
we
must
thenceforth
quarter
ourselves
in
the
back-kitchen
,
and
*NL*
leave
the
house
for
him
.
Indeed
,
he
would
have
carpeted
and
papered
a
*NL*
small
spare
room
for
a
parlour
;
but
his
wife
expressed
such
pleasure
at
*NL*
the
white
floor
and
huge
glowing
fireplace
,
at
the
pewter
dishes
and
*NL*
delf-case
,
and
dog-kennel
,
and
the
wide
space
there
was
to
move
about
in
*NL*
where
they
usually
sat
,
that
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
her
comfort
,
*NL*
and
so
dropped
the
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
expressed
pleasure
,
too
,
at
finding
a
sister
among
her
new
*NL*
acquaintance
;
and
she
prattled
to
Catherine
,
and
kissed
her
,
and
ran
*NL*
about
with
her
,
and
gave
her
quantities
of
presents
,
at
the
beginning
.
*NL*
Her
affection
tired
very
soon
,
however
,
and
when
she
grew
peevish
,
*NL*
Hindley
became
tyrannical
.
A
few
words
from
her
,
evincing
a
dislike
to
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
were
enough
to
rouse
in
him
all
his
old
hatred
of
the
boy
.
He
*NL*
drove
him
from
their
company
to
the
servants
,
deprived
him
of
the
*NL*
instructions
of
the
curate
,
and
insisted
that
he
should
labour
out
of
*NL*
doors
instead
;
compelling
him
to
do
so
as
hard
as
any
other
lad
on
the
*NL*
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
bore
his
degradation
pretty
well
at
first
,
because
Cathy
*NL*
taught
him
what
she
learnt
,
and
worked
or
played
with
him
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
They
both
promised
fair
to
grow
up
as
rude
as
savages
;
the
young
master
*NL*
being
entirely
negligent
how
they
behaved
,
and
what
they
did
,
so
they
*NL*
kept
clear
of
him
.
He
would
not
even
have
seen
after
their
going
to
*NL*
church
on
Sundays
,
only
Joseph
and
the
curate
reprimanded
his
*NL*
carelessness
when
they
absented
themselves
;
and
that
reminded
him
to
*NL*
order
Heathcliff
a
flogging
,
and
Catherine
a
fast
from
dinner
or
supper
.
*NL*
But
it
was
one
of
their
chief
amusements
to
run
away
to
the
moors
in
the
*NL*
morning
and
remain
there
all
day
,
and
the
after
punishment
grew
a
mere
*NL*
thing
to
laugh
at
.
The
curate
might
set
as
many
chapters
as
he
pleased
*NL*
for
Catherine
to
get
by
heart
,
and
Joseph
might
thrash
Heathcliff
till
*NL*
his
arm
ached
;
they
forgot
everything
the
minute
they
were
together
*NL*
again
:
at
least
the
minute
they
had
contrived
some
naughty
plan
of
*NL*
revenge
;
and
many
a
time
I
've
cried
to
myself
to
watch
them
growing
more
*NL*
reckless
daily
,
and
I
not
daring
to
speak
a
syllable
,
for
fear
of
losing
*NL*
the
small
power
I
still
retained
over
the
unfriended
creatures
.
One
*NL*
Sunday
evening
,
it
chanced
that
they
were
banished
from
the
sitting-room
,
*NL*
for
making
a
noise
,
or
a
light
offence
of
the
kind
;
and
when
I
went
to
*NL*
call
them
to
supper
,
I
could
discover
them
nowhere
.
We
searched
the
*NL*
house
,
above
and
below
,
and
the
yard
and
stables
;
they
were
invisible
:
*NL*
and
,
at
last
,
Hindley
in
a
passion
told
us
to
bolt
the
doors
,
and
swore
*NL*
nobody
should
let
them
in
that
night
.
The
household
went
to
bed
;
and
I
,
*NL*
too
,
anxious
to
lie
down
,
opened
my
lattice
and
put
my
head
out
to
*NL*
hearken
,
though
it
rained
:
determined
to
admit
them
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
prohibition
,
should
they
return
.
In
a
while
,
I
distinguished
steps
*NL*
coming
up
the
road
,
and
the
light
of
a
lantern
glimmered
through
the
*NL*
gate
.
I
threw
a
shawl
over
my
head
and
ran
to
prevent
them
from
waking
*NL*
Mr.
Earnshaw
by
knocking
.
There
was
Heathcliff
,
by
himself
:
it
gave
me
a
*NL*
start
to
see
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
Miss
Catherine
?
'
I
cried
hurriedly
.
`
No
accident
,
I
hope
?
'
`
At
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
,
'
he
answered
;
`
and
I
would
have
been
there
too
,
but
*NL*
they
had
not
the
manners
to
ask
me
to
stay
.
'
`
Well
,
you
will
catch
it
!
'
*NL*
I
said
:
`
you
'll
never
be
content
till
you
're
sent
about
your
business
.
*NL*
What
in
the
world
led
you
wandering
to
Thrushcross
Grange
?
'
`
Let
me
get
*NL*
off
my
wet
clothes
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
,
Nelly
,
'
he
replied
.
*NL*
I
bid
him
beware
of
rousing
the
master
,
and
while
he
undressed
and
I
*NL*
waited
to
put
out
the
candle
,
he
continued
--
`
Cathy
and
I
escaped
from
*NL*
the
wash-house
to
have
a
ramble
at
liberty
,
and
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
Grange
lights
,
we
thought
we
would
just
go
and
see
whether
the
Lintons
*NL*
passed
their
Sunday
evenings
standing
shivering
in
corners
,
while
their
*NL*
father
and
mother
sat
eating
and
drinking
,
and
singing
and
laughing
,
and
*NL*
burning
their
eyes
out
before
the
fire
.
Do
you
think
they
do
?
Or
reading
*NL*
sermons
,
and
being
catechised
by
their
manservant
,
and
set
to
learn
a
*NL*
column
of
Scripture
names
,
if
they
do
n't
answer
properly
?
'
`
Probably
*NL*
not
,
'
I
responded
.
`
They
are
good
children
,
no
doubt
,
and
do
n't
deserve
*NL*
the
treatment
you
receive
,
for
your
bad
conduct
.
'
`
Do
n't
cant
,
Nelly
,
'
*NL*
he
said
:
`
nonsense
!
We
ran
from
the
top
of
the
Heights
to
the
park
,
*NL*
without
stopping
--
Catherine
completely
beaten
in
the
race
,
because
she
*NL*
was
barefoot
.
You
'll
have
to
seek
for
her
shoes
in
the
bog
to-morrow
.
We
*NL*
crept
through
a
broken
hedge
,
groped
our
way
up
the
path
,
and
planted
*NL*
ourselves
on
a
flower-plot
under
the
drawing-room
window
.
The
light
came
*NL*
from
thence
;
they
had
not
put
up
the
shutters
,
and
the
curtains
were
*NL*
only
half
closed
.
Both
of
us
were
able
to
look
in
by
standing
on
the
*NL*
basement
,
and
clinging
to
the
ledge
,
and
we
saw
--
ah
!
it
was
beautiful
--
a
*NL*
splendid
place
carpeted
with
crimson
,
and
crimson-covered
chairs
and
*NL*
tables
,
and
a
pure
white
ceiling
bordered
by
gold
,
a
shower
of
*NL*
glass-drops
hanging
in
silver
chains
from
the
centre
,
and
shimmering
*NL*
with
little
soft
tapers
.
Old
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
were
not
there
;
Edgar
*NL*
and
his
sisters
had
it
entirely
to
themselves
.
Should
n't
they
have
been
*NL*
happy
?
We
should
have
thought
ourselves
in
heaven
!
And
now
,
guess
what
*NL*
your
good
children
were
doing
?
Isabella
--
I
believe
she
is
eleven
,
a
year
*NL*
younger
than
Cathy
--
lay
screaming
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
*NL*
shrieking
as
if
witches
were
running
red-hot
needles
into
her
.
Edgar
*NL*
stood
on
the
hearth
weeping
silently
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
table
sat
*NL*
a
little
dog
,
shaking
its
paw
and
yelping
;
which
,
from
their
mutual
*NL*
accusations
,
we
understood
they
had
nearly
pulled
in
two
between
them
.
*NL*
The
idiots
!
That
was
their
pleasure
!
to
quarrel
who
should
hold
a
heap
*NL*
of
warm
hair
,
and
each
begin
to
cry
because
both
,
after
struggling
to
*NL*
get
it
,
refused
to
take
it
.
We
laughed
outright
at
the
petted
things
;
we
*NL*
did
despise
them
!
When
would
you
catch
me
wishing
to
have
what
Catherine
*NL*
wanted
?
or
find
us
by
ourselves
,
seeking
entertainment
in
yelling
,
and
*NL*
sobbing
,
and
rolling
on
the
ground
,
divided
by
the
whole
room
?
I
'd
not
*NL*
exchange
,
for
a
thousand
lives
,
my
condition
here
,
for
Edgar
Linton
's
at
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
--
not
if
I
might
have
the
privilege
of
flinging
Joseph
*NL*
off
the
highest
gable
,
and
painting
the
house-front
with
Hindley
's
*NL*
blood
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
hush
!
'
I
interrupted
.
`
Still
you
have
not
told
me
,
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
how
Catherine
is
left
behind
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
told
you
we
laughed
,
'
he
answered
.
`
The
Lintons
heard
us
,
and
with
*NL*
one
accord
they
shot
like
arrows
to
the
door
;
there
was
silence
,
and
*NL*
then
a
cry
,
``
Oh
,
mamma
,
mamma
!
Oh
,
papa
!
Oh
,
mamma
,
come
here
.
Oh
,
papa
,
*NL*
oh
!
''
They
really
did
howl
out
something
in
that
way
.
We
made
frightful
*NL*
noises
to
terrify
them
still
more
,
and
then
we
dropped
off
the
ledge
,
*NL*
because
somebody
was
drawing
the
bars
,
and
we
felt
we
had
better
flee
.
I
*NL*
had
Cathy
by
the
hand
,
and
was
urging
her
on
,
when
all
at
once
she
fell
*NL*
down
.
``
Run
,
Heathcliff
,
run
!
''
she
whispered
.
``
They
have
let
the
bull-dog
*NL*
loose
,
and
he
holds
me
!
''
The
devil
had
seized
her
ankle
,
Nelly
:
I
heard
*NL*
his
abominable
snorting
.
She
did
not
yell
out
--
no
!
she
would
have
*NL*
scorned
to
do
it
,
if
she
had
been
spitted
on
the
horns
of
a
mad
cow
.
I
*NL*
did
,
though
:
I
vociferated
curses
enough
to
annihilate
any
fiend
in
*NL*
Christendom
;
and
I
got
a
stone
and
thrust
it
between
his
jaws
,
and
tried
*NL*
with
all
my
might
to
cram
it
down
his
throat
.
A
beast
of
a
servant
came
*NL*
up
with
a
lantern
,
at
last
,
shouting
--
``
Keep
fast
,
Skulker
,
keep
fast
!
''
*NL*
He
changed
his
note
,
however
,
when
he
saw
Skulker
's
game
.
The
dog
was
*NL*
throttled
off
;
his
huge
,
purple
tongue
hanging
half
a
foot
out
of
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
his
pendent
lips
streaming
with
bloody
slaver
.
The
man
took
*NL*
Cathy
up
;
she
was
sick
:
not
from
fear
,
I
'm
certain
,
but
from
pain
.
He
*NL*
carried
her
in
;
I
followed
,
grumbling
execrations
and
vengeance
.
``
What
*NL*
prey
,
Robert
?
''
hallooed
Linton
from
the
entrance
.
``
Skulker
has
caught
a
*NL*
little
girl
,
sir
,
''
he
replied
;
``
and
there
's
a
lad
here
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
making
a
clutch
at
me
,
``
who
looks
an
out-and-outer
!
Very
like
the
*NL*
robbers
were
for
putting
them
through
the
window
to
open
the
doors
to
*NL*
the
gang
after
all
were
asleep
,
that
they
might
murder
us
at
their
ease
.
*NL*
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
foul-mouthed
thief
,
you
!
you
shall
go
to
the
*NL*
gallows
for
this
.
Mr.
Linton
,
sir
,
do
n't
lay
by
your
gun
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
*NL*
Robert
,
''
said
the
old
fool
.
``
The
rascals
knew
that
yesterday
was
my
*NL*
rent-day
:
they
thought
to
have
me
cleverly
.
Come
in
;
I
'll
furnish
them
a
*NL*
reception
.
There
,
John
,
fasten
the
chain
.
Give
Skulker
some
water
,
*NL*
Jenny
.
To
beard
a
magistrate
in
his
stronghold
,
and
on
the
Sabbath
,
too
!
*NL*
Where
will
their
insolence
stop
?
Oh
,
my
dear
Mary
,
look
here
!
Do
n't
be
*NL*
afraid
,
it
is
but
a
boy
--
yet
the
villain
scowls
so
plainly
in
his
face
;
*NL*
would
it
not
be
a
kindness
to
the
country
to
hang
him
at
once
,
before
he
*NL*
shows
his
nature
in
acts
as
well
as
features
?
''
He
pulled
me
under
the
*NL*
chandelier
,
and
Mrs.
Linton
placed
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
raised
*NL*
her
hands
in
horror
.
The
cowardly
children
crept
nearer
also
,
Isabella
*NL*
lisping
--
``
Frightful
thing
!
Put
him
in
the
cellar
,
papa
.
He
's
exactly
*NL*
like
the
son
of
the
fortune-teller
that
stole
my
tame
pheasant
.
Is
n't
*NL*
he
,
Edgar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
While
they
examined
me
,
Cathy
came
round
;
she
heard
the
last
speech
,
and
*NL*
laughed
.
Edgar
Linton
,
after
an
inquisitive
stare
,
collected
sufficient
*NL*
wit
to
recognise
her
.
They
see
us
at
church
,
you
know
,
though
we
seldom
*NL*
meet
them
elsewhere
.
``
That
's
Miss
Earnshaw
?
''
he
whispered
to
his
mother
,
*NL*
``
and
look
how
Skulker
has
bitten
her
--
how
her
foot
bleeds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Miss
Earnshaw
?
Nonsense
!
''
cried
the
dame
;
``
Miss
Earnshaw
scouring
the
*NL*
country
with
a
gipsy
!
And
yet
,
my
dear
,
the
child
is
in
mourning
--
surely
*NL*
it
is
--
and
she
may
be
lamed
for
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
culpable
carelessness
in
her
brother
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Linton
,
*NL*
turning
from
me
to
Catherine
.
``
I
've
understood
from
Shielders
''
'
-LRB-
that
*NL*
was
the
curate
,
sir
-RRB-
'
``
that
he
lets
her
grow
up
in
absolute
heathenism
.
*NL*
But
who
is
this
?
Where
did
she
pick
up
this
companion
?
Oho
!
I
declare
*NL*
he
is
that
strange
acquisition
my
late
neighbour
made
,
in
his
journey
to
*NL*
Liverpool
--
a
little
Lascar
,
or
an
American
or
Spanish
castaway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
A
wicked
boy
,
at
all
events
,
''
remarked
the
old
lady
,
``
and
quite
unfit
*NL*
for
a
decent
house
!
Did
you
notice
his
language
,
Linton
?
I
'm
shocked
*NL*
that
my
children
should
have
heard
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
recommenced
cursing
--
do
n't
be
angry
,
Nelly
--
and
so
Robert
was
ordered
*NL*
to
take
me
off
.
I
refused
to
go
without
Cathy
;
he
dragged
me
into
the
*NL*
garden
,
pushed
the
lantern
into
my
hand
,
assured
me
that
Mr.
Earnshaw
*NL*
should
be
informed
of
my
behaviour
,
and
,
bidding
me
march
directly
,
*NL*
secured
the
door
again
.
The
curtains
were
still
looped
up
at
one
corner
,
*NL*
and
I
resumed
my
station
as
spy
;
because
,
if
Catherine
had
wished
to
*NL*
return
,
I
intended
shattering
their
great
glass
panes
to
a
million
of
*NL*
fragments
,
unless
they
let
her
out
.
She
sat
on
the
sofa
quietly
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
took
off
the
grey
cloak
of
the
dairy-maid
which
we
had
borrowed
*NL*
for
our
excursion
,
shaking
her
head
and
expostulating
with
her
,
I
*NL*
suppose
:
she
was
a
young
lady
,
and
they
made
a
distinction
between
her
*NL*
treatment
and
mine
.
Then
the
woman-servant
brought
a
basin
of
warm
*NL*
water
,
and
washed
her
feet
;
and
Mr.
Linton
mixed
a
tumbler
of
negus
,
and
*NL*
Isabella
emptied
a
plateful
of
cakes
into
her
lap
,
and
Edgar
stood
gaping
*NL*
at
a
distance
.
Afterwards
,
they
dried
and
combed
her
beautiful
hair
,
and
*NL*
gave
her
a
pair
of
enormous
slippers
,
and
wheeled
her
to
the
fire
;
and
I
*NL*
left
her
,
as
merry
as
she
could
be
,
dividing
her
food
between
the
little
*NL*
dog
and
Skulker
,
whose
nose
she
pinched
as
he
ate
;
and
kindling
a
spark
*NL*
of
spirit
in
the
vacant
blue
eyes
of
the
Lintons
--
a
dim
reflection
from
*NL*
her
own
enchanting
face
.
I
saw
they
were
full
of
stupid
admiration
;
she
*NL*
is
so
immeasurably
superior
to
them
--
to
everybody
on
earth
,
is
she
not
,
*NL*
Nelly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
will
more
come
of
this
business
than
you
reckon
on
,
'
I
answered
,
*NL*
covering
him
up
and
extinguishing
the
light
.
`
You
are
incurable
,
*NL*
Heathcliff
;
and
Mr.
Hindley
will
have
to
proceed
to
extremities
,
see
if
*NL*
he
wo
n't
.
'
My
words
came
truer
than
I
desired
.
The
luckless
adventure
*NL*
made
Earnshaw
furious
.
And
then
Mr.
Linton
,
to
mend
matters
,
paid
us
a
*NL*
visit
himself
on
the
morrow
,
and
read
the
young
master
such
a
lecture
on
*NL*
the
road
he
guided
his
family
,
that
he
was
stirred
to
look
about
him
,
in
*NL*
earnest
.
Heathcliff
received
no
flogging
,
but
he
was
told
that
the
first
*NL*
word
he
spoke
to
Miss
Catherine
should
ensure
a
dismissal
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Earnshaw
undertook
to
keep
her
sister-in-law
in
due
restraint
when
she
*NL*
returned
home
;
employing
art
,
not
force
:
with
force
she
would
have
found
*NL*
it
impossible
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
stayed
at
Thrushcross
Grange
five
weeks
:
till
Christmas
.
By
that
*NL*
time
her
ankle
was
thoroughly
cured
,
and
her
manners
much
improved
.
The
*NL*
mistress
visited
her
often
in
the
interval
,
and
commenced
her
plan
of
*NL*
reform
by
trying
to
raise
her
self-respect
with
fine
clothes
and
*NL*
flattery
,
which
she
took
readily
;
so
that
,
instead
of
a
wild
,
hatless
*NL*
little
savage
jumping
into
the
house
,
and
rushing
to
squeeze
us
all
*NL*
breathless
,
there
`
lighted
from
a
handsome
black
pony
a
very
dignified
*NL*
person
,
with
brown
ringlets
falling
from
the
cover
of
a
feathered
beaver
,
*NL*
and
a
long
cloth
habit
,
which
she
was
obliged
to
hold
up
with
both
hands
*NL*
that
she
might
sail
in
.
Hindley
lifted
her
from
her
horse
,
exclaiming
*NL*
delightedly
,
`
Why
,
Cathy
,
you
are
quite
a
beauty
!
I
should
scarcely
have
*NL*
known
you
:
you
look
like
a
lady
now
.
Isabella
Linton
is
not
to
be
*NL*
compared
with
her
,
is
she
,
Frances
?
'
`
Isabella
has
not
her
natural
*NL*
advantages
,
'
replied
his
wife
:
`
but
she
must
mind
and
not
grow
wild
again
*NL*
here
.
Ellen
,
help
Miss
Catherine
off
with
her
things
--
Stay
,
dear
,
you
*NL*
will
disarrange
your
curls
--
let
me
untie
your
hat
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
removed
the
habit
,
and
there
shone
forth
beneath
a
grand
plaid
silk
*NL*
frock
,
white
trousers
,
and
burnished
shoes
;
and
,
while
her
eyes
sparkled
*NL*
joyfully
when
the
dogs
came
bounding
up
to
welcome
her
,
she
dared
hardly
*NL*
touch
them
lest
they
should
fawn
upon
her
splendid
garments
.
She
kissed
*NL*
me
gently
:
I
was
all
flour
making
the
Christmas
cake
,
and
it
would
not
*NL*
have
done
to
give
me
a
hug
;
and
then
she
looked
round
for
Heathcliff
.
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
watched
anxiously
their
meeting
;
thinking
it
would
*NL*
enable
them
to
judge
,
in
some
measure
,
what
grounds
they
had
for
hoping
*NL*
to
succeed
in
separating
the
two
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
was
hard
to
discover
,
at
first
.
If
he
were
careless
,
and
*NL*
uncared
for
,
before
Catherine
's
absence
,
he
had
been
ten
times
more
so
*NL*
since
.
Nobody
but
I
even
did
him
the
kindness
to
call
him
a
dirty
boy
,
*NL*
and
bid
him
wash
himself
,
once
a
week
;
and
children
of
his
age
seldom
*NL*
have
a
natural
pleasure
in
soap
and
water
.
Therefore
,
not
to
mention
his
*NL*
clothes
,
which
had
seen
three
months
'
service
in
mire
and
dust
,
and
his
*NL*
thick
uncombed
hair
,
the
surface
of
his
face
and
hands
was
dismally
*NL*
beclouded
.
He
might
well
skulk
behind
the
settle
,
on
beholding
such
a
*NL*
bright
,
graceful
damsel
enter
the
house
,
instead
of
a
rough-headed
*NL*
counterpart
of
himself
,
as
he
expected
.
`
Is
Heathcliff
not
here
?
'
she
*NL*
demanded
,
pulling
off
her
gloves
,
and
displaying
fingers
wonderfully
*NL*
whitened
with
doing
nothing
and
staying
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
,
you
may
come
forward
,
'
cried
Mr.
Hindley
,
enjoying
his
*NL*
discomfiture
,
and
gratified
to
see
what
a
forbidding
young
blackguard
he
*NL*
would
be
compelled
to
present
himself
.
`
You
may
come
and
wish
Miss
*NL*
Catherine
welcome
,
like
the
other
servants
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
,
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
friend
in
his
concealment
,
flew
to
*NL*
embrace
him
;
she
bestowed
seven
or
eight
kisses
on
his
cheek
within
the
*NL*
second
,
and
then
stopped
,
and
drawing
back
,
burst
into
a
laugh
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
`
Why
,
how
very
black
and
cross
you
look
!
and
how
--
how
funny
*NL*
and
grim
!
But
that
's
because
I
'm
used
to
Edgar
and
Isabella
Linton
.
*NL*
Well
,
Heathcliff
,
have
you
forgotten
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
some
reason
to
put
the
question
,
for
shame
and
pride
threw
double
*NL*
gloom
over
his
countenance
,
and
kept
him
immovable
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shake
hands
,
Heathcliff
,
'
said
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
condescendingly
;
`
once
in
a
*NL*
way
that
is
permitted
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
not
,
'
replied
the
boy
,
finding
his
tongue
at
last
;
'
I
shall
not
*NL*
stand
to
be
laughed
at
.
I
shall
not
bear
it
!
'
And
he
would
have
broken
*NL*
from
the
circle
,
but
Miss
Cathy
seized
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
mean
to
laugh
at
you
,
'
she
said
;
'
I
could
not
hinder
myself
:
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
shake
hands
at
least
!
What
are
you
sulky
for
?
It
was
only
*NL*
that
you
looked
odd
.
If
you
wash
your
face
and
brush
your
hair
,
it
will
*NL*
be
all
right
:
but
you
are
so
dirty
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
concernedly
at
the
dusky
fingers
she
held
in
her
own
,
and
also
*NL*
at
her
dress
;
which
she
feared
had
gained
no
embellishment
from
its
*NL*
contact
with
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
n't
have
touched
me
!
'
he
answered
,
following
her
eye
and
*NL*
snatching
away
his
hand
.
'
I
shall
be
as
dirty
as
I
please
:
and
I
like
to
*NL*
be
dirty
,
and
I
will
be
dirty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
dashed
headforemost
out
of
the
room
,
amid
the
merriment
of
*NL*
the
master
and
mistress
,
and
to
the
serious
disturbance
of
Catherine
;
who
*NL*
could
not
comprehend
how
her
remarks
should
have
produced
such
an
*NL*
exhibition
of
bad
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
playing
lady
's
-
maid
to
the
new-comer
,
and
putting
my
cakes
in
the
*NL*
oven
,
and
making
the
house
and
kitchen
cheerful
with
great
fires
,
*NL*
befitting
Christmas-eve
,
I
prepared
to
sit
down
and
amuse
myself
by
*NL*
singing
carols
,
all
alone
;
regardless
of
Joseph
's
affirmations
that
he
*NL*
considered
the
merry
tunes
I
chose
as
next
door
to
songs
.
He
had
retired
*NL*
to
private
prayer
in
his
chamber
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Earnshaw
were
engaging
*NL*
Missy
's
attention
by
sundry
gay
trifles
bought
for
her
to
present
to
the
*NL*
little
Lintons
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
their
kindness
.
They
had
invited
*NL*
them
to
spend
the
morrow
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
the
invitation
had
*NL*
been
accepted
,
on
one
condition
:
Mrs.
Linton
begged
that
her
darlings
*NL*
might
be
kept
carefully
apart
from
that
`
naughty
swearing
boy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Under
these
circumstances
I
remained
solitary
.
I
smelt
the
rich
scent
of
*NL*
the
heating
spices
;
and
admired
the
shining
kitchen
utensils
,
the
*NL*
polished
clock
,
decked
in
holly
,
the
silver
mugs
ranged
on
a
tray
ready
*NL*
to
be
filled
with
mulled
ale
for
supper
;
and
above
all
,
the
speckless
*NL*
purity
of
my
particular
care
--
the
scoured
and
well-swept
floor
.
I
gave
*NL*
due
inward
applause
to
every
object
,
and
then
I
remembered
how
old
*NL*
Earnshaw
used
to
come
in
when
all
was
tidied
,
and
call
me
a
cant
lass
,
*NL*
and
slip
a
shilling
into
my
hand
as
a
Christmas-box
;
and
from
that
I
went
*NL*
on
to
think
of
his
fondness
for
Heathcliff
,
and
his
dread
lest
he
should
*NL*
suffer
neglect
after
death
had
removed
him
:
and
that
naturally
led
me
to
*NL*
consider
the
poor
lad
's
situation
now
,
and
from
singing
I
changed
my
mind
*NL*
to
crying
.
It
struck
me
soon
,
however
,
there
would
be
more
sense
in
*NL*
endeavouring
to
repair
some
of
his
wrongs
than
shedding
tears
over
them
:
*NL*
I
got
up
and
walked
into
the
court
to
seek
him
.
He
was
not
far
;
I
found
*NL*
him
smoothing
the
glossy
coat
of
the
new
pony
in
the
stable
,
and
feeding
*NL*
the
other
beasts
,
according
to
custom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Make
haste
,
Heathcliff
!
'
I
said
,
`
the
kitchen
is
so
comfortable
;
and
*NL*
Joseph
is
up-stairs
:
make
haste
,
and
let
me
dress
you
smart
before
Miss
*NL*
Cathy
comes
out
,
and
then
you
can
sit
together
,
with
the
whole
hearth
to
*NL*
yourselves
,
and
have
a
long
chatter
till
bedtime
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
proceeded
with
his
task
,
and
never
turned
his
head
towards
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
--
are
you
coming
?
'
I
continued
.
`
There
's
a
little
cake
for
each
of
*NL*
you
,
nearly
enough
;
and
you
'll
need
half-an-hour
's
donning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
five
minutes
,
but
getting
no
answer
left
him
.
Catherine
supped
*NL*
with
her
brother
and
sister-in-law
:
Joseph
and
I
joined
at
an
unsociable
*NL*
meal
,
seasoned
with
reproofs
on
one
side
and
sauciness
on
the
other
.
His
*NL*
cake
and
cheese
remained
on
the
table
all
night
for
the
fairies
.
He
*NL*
managed
to
continue
work
till
nine
o'clock
,
and
then
marched
dumb
and
*NL*
dour
to
his
chamber
.
Cathy
sat
up
late
,
having
a
world
of
things
to
*NL*
order
for
the
reception
of
her
new
friends
:
she
came
into
the
kitchen
*NL*
once
to
speak
to
her
old
one
;
but
he
was
gone
,
and
she
only
stayed
to
ask
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
with
him
,
and
then
went
back
.
In
the
morning
he
rose
*NL*
early
;
and
,
as
it
was
a
holiday
,
carried
his
ill-humour
on
to
the
moors
;
*NL*
not
re-appearing
till
the
family
were
departed
for
church
.
Fasting
and
*NL*
reflection
seemed
to
have
brought
him
to
a
better
spirit
.
He
hung
about
*NL*
me
for
a
while
,
and
having
screwed
up
his
courage
,
exclaimed
*NL*
abruptly
--
`
Nelly
,
make
me
decent
,
I
'm
going
to
be
good
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
High
time
,
Heathcliff
,
'
I
said
;
`
you
_
have
_
grieved
Catherine
:
she
's
*NL*
sorry
she
ever
came
home
,
I
daresay
!
It
looks
as
if
you
envied
her
,
*NL*
because
she
is
more
thought
of
than
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
notion
of
_
envying
_
Catherine
was
incomprehensible
to
him
,
but
the
*NL*
notion
of
grieving
her
he
understood
clearly
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
she
say
she
was
grieved
?
'
he
inquired
,
looking
very
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
cried
when
I
told
her
you
were
off
again
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
_
I
_
cried
last
night
,
'
he
returned
,
`
and
I
had
more
reason
to
cry
*NL*
than
she
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
:
you
had
the
reason
of
going
to
bed
with
a
proud
heart
and
an
empty
*NL*
stomach
,
'
said
I.
`
Proud
people
breed
sad
sorrows
for
themselves
.
But
,
*NL*
if
you
be
ashamed
of
your
touchiness
,
you
must
ask
pardon
,
mind
,
when
she
*NL*
comes
in
.
You
must
go
up
and
offer
to
kiss
her
,
and
say
--
you
know
best
*NL*
what
to
say
;
only
do
it
heartily
,
and
not
as
if
you
thought
her
converted
*NL*
into
a
stranger
by
her
grand
dress
.
And
now
,
though
I
have
dinner
to
get
*NL*
ready
,
I
'll
steal
time
to
arrange
you
so
that
Edgar
Linton
shall
look
*NL*
quite
a
doll
beside
you
:
and
that
he
does
.
You
are
younger
,
and
yet
,
*NL*
I
'll
be
bound
,
you
are
taller
and
twice
as
broad
across
the
shoulders
;
*NL*
you
could
knock
him
down
in
a
twinkling
;
do
n't
you
feel
that
you
could
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
face
brightened
a
moment
;
then
it
was
overcast
afresh
,
and
*NL*
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
Nelly
,
if
I
knocked
him
down
twenty
times
,
that
would
n't
make
him
*NL*
less
handsome
or
me
more
so
.
I
wish
I
had
light
hair
and
a
fair
skin
,
*NL*
and
was
dressed
and
behaved
as
well
,
and
had
a
chance
of
being
as
rich
as
*NL*
he
will
be
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
cried
for
mamma
at
every
turn
,
'
I
added
,
`
and
trembled
if
a
country
*NL*
lad
heaved
his
fist
against
you
,
and
sat
at
home
all
day
for
a
shower
of
*NL*
rain
.
Oh
,
Heathcliff
,
you
are
showing
a
poor
spirit
!
Come
to
the
glass
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
let
you
see
what
you
should
wish
.
Do
you
mark
those
two
lines
*NL*
between
your
eyes
;
and
those
thick
brows
,
that
,
instead
of
rising
arched
,
*NL*
sink
in
the
middle
;
and
that
couple
of
black
fiends
,
so
deeply
buried
,
*NL*
who
never
open
their
windows
boldly
,
but
lurk
glinting
under
them
,
like
*NL*
devil
's
spies
?
Wish
and
learn
to
smooth
away
the
surly
wrinkles
,
to
*NL*
raise
your
lids
frankly
,
and
change
the
fiends
to
confident
,
innocent
*NL*
angels
,
suspecting
and
doubting
nothing
,
and
always
seeing
friends
where
*NL*
they
are
not
sure
of
foes
.
Do
n't
get
the
expression
of
a
vicious
cur
*NL*
that
appears
to
know
the
kicks
it
gets
are
its
desert
,
and
yet
hates
all
*NL*
the
world
,
as
well
as
the
kicker
,
for
what
it
suffers
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
other
words
,
I
must
wish
for
Edgar
Linton
's
great
blue
eyes
and
even
*NL*
forehead
,
'
he
replied
.
'
I
do
--
and
that
wo
n't
help
me
to
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
good
heart
will
help
you
to
a
bonny
face
,
my
lad
,
'
I
continued
,
`
if
*NL*
you
were
a
regular
black
;
and
a
bad
one
will
turn
the
bonniest
into
*NL*
something
worse
than
ugly
.
And
now
that
we
've
done
washing
,
and
combing
,
*NL*
and
sulking
--
tell
me
whether
you
do
n't
think
yourself
rather
handsome
?
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
,
I
do
.
You
're
fit
for
a
prince
in
disguise
.
Who
knows
but
*NL*
your
father
was
Emperor
of
China
,
and
your
mother
an
Indian
queen
,
each
*NL*
of
them
able
to
buy
up
,
with
one
week
's
income
,
Wuthering
Heights
and
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
together
?
And
you
were
kidnapped
by
wicked
sailors
*NL*
and
brought
to
England
.
Were
I
in
your
place
,
I
would
frame
high
notions
*NL*
of
my
birth
;
and
the
thoughts
of
what
I
was
should
give
me
courage
and
*NL*
dignity
to
support
the
oppressions
of
a
little
farmer
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
chattered
on
;
and
Heathcliff
gradually
lost
his
frown
and
began
to
*NL*
look
quite
pleasant
,
when
all
at
once
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
*NL*
a
rumbling
sound
moving
up
the
road
and
entering
the
court
.
He
ran
to
*NL*
the
window
and
I
to
the
door
,
just
in
time
to
behold
the
two
Lintons
*NL*
descend
from
the
family
carriage
,
smothered
in
cloaks
and
furs
,
and
the
*NL*
Earnshaws
dismount
from
their
horses
:
they
often
rode
to
church
in
*NL*
winter
.
Catherine
took
a
hand
of
each
of
the
children
,
and
brought
them
*NL*
into
the
house
and
set
them
before
the
fire
,
which
quickly
put
colour
*NL*
into
their
white
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
urged
my
companion
to
hasten
now
and
show
his
amiable
humour
,
and
he
*NL*
willingly
obeyed
;
but
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
,
as
he
opened
the
door
*NL*
leading
from
the
kitchen
on
one
side
,
Hindley
opened
it
on
the
other
.
*NL*
They
met
,
and
the
master
,
irritated
at
seeing
him
clean
and
cheerful
,
or
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
eager
to
keep
his
promise
to
Mrs.
Linton
,
shoved
him
back
with
a
*NL*
sudden
thrust
,
and
angrily
bade
Joseph
`
keep
the
fellow
out
of
the
*NL*
room
--
send
him
into
the
garret
till
dinner
is
over
.
He
'll
be
cramming
*NL*
his
fingers
in
the
tarts
and
stealing
the
fruit
,
if
left
alone
with
them
*NL*
a
minute
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
sir
,
'
I
could
not
avoid
answering
,
`
he
'll
touch
nothing
,
not
he
:
*NL*
and
I
suppose
he
must
have
his
share
of
the
dainties
as
well
as
we
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shall
have
his
share
of
my
hand
,
if
I
catch
him
downstairs
till
*NL*
dark
,
'
cried
Hindley
.
`
Begone
,
you
vagabond
!
What
!
you
are
attempting
*NL*
the
coxcomb
,
are
you
?
Wait
till
I
get
hold
of
those
elegant
locks
--
see
*NL*
if
I
wo
n't
pull
them
a
bit
longer
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
are
long
enough
already
,
'
observed
Master
Linton
,
peeping
from
the
*NL*
doorway
;
'
I
wonder
they
do
n't
make
his
head
ache
.
It
's
like
a
colt
's
*NL*
mane
over
his
eyes
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
ventured
this
remark
without
any
intention
to
insult
;
but
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
violent
nature
was
not
prepared
to
endure
the
appearance
of
impertinence
*NL*
from
one
whom
he
seemed
to
hate
,
even
then
,
as
a
rival
.
He
seized
a
*NL*
tureen
of
hot
apple
sauce
-LRB-
the
first
thing
that
came
under
his
gripe
-RRB-
and
*NL*
dashed
it
full
against
the
speaker
's
face
and
neck
;
who
instantly
*NL*
commenced
a
lament
that
brought
Isabella
and
Catherine
hurrying
to
the
*NL*
place
.
Mr.
Earnshaw
snatched
up
the
culprit
directly
and
conveyed
him
to
*NL*
his
chamber
;
where
,
doubtless
,
he
administered
a
rough
remedy
to
cool
the
*NL*
fit
of
passion
,
for
he
appeared
red
and
breathless
.
I
got
the
dishcloth
,
*NL*
and
rather
spitefully
scrubbed
Edgar
's
nose
and
mouth
,
affirming
it
*NL*
served
him
right
for
meddling
.
His
sister
began
weeping
to
go
home
,
and
*NL*
Cathy
stood
by
confounded
,
blushing
for
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
not
have
spoken
to
him
!
'
she
expostulated
with
Master
Linton
.
*NL*
`
He
was
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
now
you
've
spoilt
your
visit
;
and
he
'll
be
*NL*
flogged
:
I
hate
him
to
be
flogged
!
I
ca
n't
eat
my
dinner
.
Why
did
you
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
Edgar
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
,
'
sobbed
the
youth
,
escaping
from
my
hands
,
and
finishing
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
purification
with
his
cambric
pocket-handkerchief
.
'
I
*NL*
promised
mamma
that
I
would
n't
say
one
word
to
him
,
and
I
did
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
do
n't
cry
,
'
replied
Catherine
,
contemptuously
;
`
you
're
not
killed
.
*NL*
Do
n't
make
more
mischief
;
my
brother
is
coming
:
be
quiet
!
Hush
,
*NL*
Isabella
!
Has
anybody
hurt
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
there
,
children
--
to
your
seats
!
'
cried
Hindley
,
bustling
in
.
*NL*
`
That
brute
of
a
lad
has
warmed
me
nicely
.
Next
time
,
Master
Edgar
,
take
*NL*
the
law
into
your
own
fists
--
it
will
give
you
an
appetite
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
party
recovered
its
equanimity
at
sight
of
the
fragrant
feast
.
*NL*
They
were
hungry
after
their
ride
,
and
easily
consoled
,
since
no
real
*NL*
harm
had
befallen
them
.
Mr.
Earnshaw
carved
bountiful
platefuls
,
and
the
*NL*
mistress
made
them
merry
with
lively
talk
.
I
waited
behind
her
chair
,
*NL*
and
was
pained
to
behold
Catherine
,
with
dry
eyes
and
an
indifferent
air
,
*NL*
commence
cutting
up
the
wing
of
a
goose
before
her
.
`
An
unfeeling
*NL*
child
,
'
I
thought
to
myself
;
`
how
lightly
she
dismisses
her
old
*NL*
playmate
's
troubles
.
I
could
not
have
imagined
her
to
be
so
selfish
.
'
*NL*
She
lifted
a
mouthful
to
her
lips
:
then
she
set
it
down
again
:
her
cheeks
*NL*
flushed
,
and
the
tears
gushed
over
them
.
She
slipped
her
fork
to
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
hastily
dived
under
the
cloth
to
conceal
her
emotion
.
I
did
*NL*
not
call
her
unfeeling
long
;
for
I
perceived
she
was
in
purgatory
*NL*
throughout
the
day
,
and
wearying
to
find
an
opportunity
of
getting
by
*NL*
herself
,
or
paying
a
visit
to
Heathcliff
,
who
had
been
locked
up
by
the
*NL*
master
:
as
I
discovered
,
on
endeavouring
to
introduce
to
him
a
private
*NL*
mess
of
victuals
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
we
had
a
dance
.
Cathy
begged
that
he
might
be
liberated
*NL*
then
,
as
Isabella
Linton
had
no
partner
:
her
entreaties
were
vain
,
and
I
*NL*
was
appointed
to
supply
the
deficiency
.
We
got
rid
of
all
gloom
in
the
*NL*
excitement
of
the
exercise
,
and
our
pleasure
was
increased
by
the
arrival
*NL*
of
the
Gimmerton
band
,
mustering
fifteen
strong
:
a
trumpet
,
a
trombone
,
*NL*
clarionets
,
bassoons
,
French
horns
,
and
a
bass
viol
,
besides
singers
.
*NL*
They
go
the
rounds
of
all
the
respectable
houses
,
and
receive
*NL*
contributions
every
Christmas
,
and
we
esteemed
it
a
first-rate
treat
to
*NL*
hear
them
.
After
the
usual
carols
had
been
sung
,
we
set
them
to
songs
*NL*
and
glees
.
Mrs.
Earnshaw
loved
the
music
,
and
so
they
gave
us
plenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
loved
it
too
:
but
she
said
it
sounded
sweetest
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
steps
,
and
she
went
up
in
the
dark
:
I
followed
.
They
shut
the
house
*NL*
door
below
,
never
noting
our
absence
,
it
was
so
full
of
people
.
She
made
*NL*
no
stay
at
the
stairs
'
-
head
,
but
mounted
farther
,
to
the
garret
where
*NL*
Heathcliff
was
confined
,
and
called
him
.
He
stubbornly
declined
*NL*
answering
for
a
while
:
she
persevered
,
and
finally
persuaded
him
to
hold
*NL*
communion
with
her
through
the
boards
.
I
let
the
poor
things
converse
*NL*
unmolested
,
till
I
supposed
the
songs
were
going
to
cease
,
and
the
*NL*
singers
to
get
some
refreshment
:
then
I
clambered
up
the
ladder
to
warn
*NL*
her
.
Instead
of
finding
her
outside
,
I
heard
her
voice
within
.
The
*NL*
little
monkey
had
crept
by
the
skylight
of
one
garret
,
along
the
roof
,
*NL*
into
the
skylight
of
the
other
,
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
I
*NL*
could
coax
her
out
again
.
When
she
did
come
,
Heathcliff
came
with
her
,
*NL*
and
she
insisted
that
I
should
take
him
into
the
kitchen
,
as
my
*NL*
fellow-servant
had
gone
to
a
neighbour
's
,
to
be
removed
from
the
sound
*NL*
of
our
`
devil
's
psalmody
,
'
as
it
pleased
him
to
call
it
.
I
told
them
I
*NL*
intended
by
no
means
to
encourage
their
tricks
:
but
as
the
prisoner
had
*NL*
never
broken
his
fast
since
yesterday
's
dinner
,
I
would
wink
at
his
*NL*
cheating
Mr.
Hindley
that
once
.
He
went
down
:
I
set
him
a
stool
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
offered
him
a
quantity
of
good
things
:
but
he
was
sick
and
*NL*
could
eat
little
,
and
my
attempts
to
entertain
him
were
thrown
away
.
He
*NL*
leant
his
two
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
and
*NL*
remained
rapt
in
dumb
meditation
.
On
my
inquiring
the
subject
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
answered
gravely
--
`
I
'm
trying
to
settle
how
I
shall
pay
*NL*
Hindley
back
.
I
do
n't
care
how
long
I
wait
,
if
I
can
only
do
it
at
last
.
*NL*
I
hope
he
will
not
die
before
I
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
shame
,
Heathcliff
!
'
said
I.
`
It
is
for
God
to
punish
wicked
people
;
*NL*
we
should
learn
to
forgive
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
God
wo
n't
have
the
satisfaction
that
I
shall
,
'
he
returned
.
'
I
only
*NL*
wish
I
knew
the
best
way
!
Let
me
alone
,
and
I
'll
plan
it
out
:
while
I
'm
*NL*
thinking
of
that
I
do
n't
feel
pain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
forget
these
tales
can
not
divert
you
.
I
'm
annoyed
*NL*
how
I
should
dream
of
chattering
on
at
such
a
rate
;
and
your
gruel
cold
,
*NL*
and
you
nodding
for
bed
!
I
could
have
told
Heathcliff
's
history
,
all
*NL*
that
you
need
hear
,
in
half
a
dozen
words
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
interrupting
herself
,
the
housekeeper
rose
,
and
proceeded
to
lay
*NL*
aside
her
sewing
;
but
I
felt
incapable
of
moving
from
the
hearth
,
and
I
*NL*
was
very
far
from
nodding
.
`
Sit
still
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
'
I
cried
;
`
do
sit
*NL*
still
another
half-hour
.
You
've
done
just
right
to
tell
the
story
*NL*
leisurely
.
That
is
the
method
I
like
;
and
you
must
finish
it
in
the
same
*NL*
style
.
I
am
interested
in
every
character
you
have
mentioned
,
more
or
*NL*
less
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
clock
is
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
,
sir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
matter
--
I
'm
not
accustomed
to
go
to
bed
in
the
long
hours
.
One
or
*NL*
two
is
early
enough
for
a
person
who
lies
till
ten
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
n't
lie
till
ten
.
There
's
the
very
prime
of
the
morning
gone
*NL*
long
before
that
time
.
A
person
who
has
not
done
one-half
his
day
's
work
*NL*
by
ten
o'clock
,
runs
a
chance
of
leaving
the
other
half
undone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
resume
your
chair
;
because
to-morrow
I
intend
*NL*
lengthening
the
night
till
afternoon
.
I
prognosticate
for
myself
an
*NL*
obstinate
cold
,
at
least
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
not
,
sir
.
Well
,
you
must
allow
me
to
leap
over
some
three
years
;
*NL*
during
that
space
Mrs.
Earnshaw
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
I
'll
allow
nothing
of
the
sort
!
Are
you
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
mood
of
mind
in
which
,
if
you
were
seated
alone
,
and
the
cat
licking
its
*NL*
kitten
on
the
rug
before
you
,
you
would
watch
the
operation
so
intently
*NL*
that
puss
's
neglect
of
one
ear
would
put
you
seriously
out
of
temper
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
terribly
lazy
mood
,
I
should
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
the
contrary
,
a
tiresomely
active
one
.
It
is
mine
,
at
present
;
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
continue
minutely
.
I
perceive
that
people
in
these
regions
*NL*
acquire
over
people
in
towns
the
value
that
a
spider
in
a
dungeon
does
*NL*
over
a
spider
in
a
cottage
,
to
their
various
occupants
;
and
yet
the
*NL*
deepened
attraction
is
not
entirely
owing
to
the
situation
of
the
*NL*
looker-on
.
They
_
do
_
live
more
in
earnest
,
more
in
themselves
,
and
less
*NL*
in
surface
,
change
,
and
frivolous
external
things
.
I
could
fancy
a
love
*NL*
for
life
here
almost
possible
;
and
I
was
a
fixed
unbeliever
in
any
love
*NL*
of
a
year
's
standing
.
One
state
resembles
setting
a
hungry
man
down
to
a
*NL*
single
dish
,
on
which
he
may
concentrate
his
entire
appetite
and
do
it
*NL*
justice
;
the
other
,
introducing
him
to
a
table
laid
out
by
French
cooks
:
*NL*
he
can
perhaps
extract
as
much
enjoyment
from
the
whole
;
but
each
part
*NL*
is
a
mere
atom
in
his
regard
and
remembrance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
here
we
are
the
same
as
anywhere
else
,
when
you
get
to
know
us
,
'
*NL*
observed
Mrs.
Dean
,
somewhat
puzzled
at
my
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Excuse
me
,
'
I
responded
;
`
you
,
my
good
friend
,
are
a
striking
evidence
*NL*
against
that
assertion
.
Excepting
a
few
provincialisms
of
slight
*NL*
consequence
,
you
have
no
marks
of
the
manners
which
I
am
habituated
to
*NL*
consider
as
peculiar
to
your
class
.
I
am
sure
you
have
thought
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
than
the
generality
of
servants
think
.
You
have
been
compelled
*NL*
to
cultivate
your
reflective
faculties
for
want
of
occasions
for
*NL*
frittering
your
life
away
in
silly
trifles
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dean
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
certainly
esteem
myself
a
steady
,
reasonable
kind
of
body
,
'
she
said
;
*NL*
`
not
exactly
from
living
among
the
hills
and
seeing
one
set
of
faces
,
and
*NL*
one
series
of
actions
,
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
but
I
have
*NL*
undergone
sharp
discipline
,
which
has
taught
me
wisdom
;
and
then
,
I
have
*NL*
read
more
than
you
would
fancy
,
Mr.
Lockwood
.
You
could
not
open
a
book
*NL*
in
this
library
that
I
have
not
looked
into
,
and
got
something
out
of
*NL*
also
:
unless
it
be
that
range
of
Greek
and
Latin
,
and
that
of
French
;
and
*NL*
those
I
know
one
from
another
:
it
is
as
much
as
you
can
expect
of
a
poor
*NL*
man
's
daughter
.
However
,
if
I
am
to
follow
my
story
in
true
gossip
's
*NL*
fashion
,
I
had
better
go
on
;
and
instead
of
leaping
three
years
,
I
will
*NL*
be
content
to
pass
to
the
next
summer
--
the
summer
of
1778
,
that
is
nearly
*NL*
twenty-three
years
ago
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
a
fine
June
day
my
first
bonny
little
nursling
,
and
the
*NL*
last
of
the
ancient
Earnshaw
stock
,
was
born
.
We
were
busy
with
the
hay
*NL*
in
a
far-away
field
,
when
the
girl
that
usually
brought
our
breakfasts
*NL*
came
running
an
hour
too
soon
across
the
meadow
and
up
the
lane
,
calling
*NL*
me
as
she
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
such
a
grand
bairn
!
'
she
panted
out
.
`
The
finest
lad
that
ever
*NL*
breathed
!
But
the
doctor
says
missis
must
go
:
he
says
she
's
been
in
a
*NL*
consumption
these
many
months
.
I
heard
him
tell
Mr.
Hindley
:
and
now
she
*NL*
has
nothing
to
keep
her
,
and
she
'll
be
dead
before
winter
.
You
must
come
*NL*
home
directly
.
You
're
to
nurse
it
,
Nelly
:
to
feed
it
with
sugar
and
*NL*
milk
,
and
take
care
of
it
day
and
night
.
I
wish
I
were
you
,
because
it
*NL*
will
be
all
yours
when
there
is
no
missis
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
is
she
very
ill
?
'
I
asked
,
flinging
down
my
rake
and
tying
my
*NL*
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
guess
she
is
;
yet
she
looks
bravely
,
'
replied
the
girl
,
`
and
she
talks
*NL*
as
if
she
thought
of
living
to
see
it
grow
a
man
.
She
's
out
of
her
head
*NL*
for
joy
,
it
's
such
a
beauty
!
If
I
were
her
I
'm
certain
I
should
not
die
:
*NL*
I
should
get
better
at
the
bare
sight
of
it
,
in
spite
of
Kenneth
.
I
was
*NL*
fairly
mad
at
him
.
Dame
Archer
brought
the
cherub
down
to
master
,
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
his
face
just
began
to
light
up
,
when
the
old
croaker
steps
*NL*
forward
,
and
says
he
--
``
Earnshaw
,
it
's
a
blessing
your
wife
has
been
*NL*
spared
to
leave
you
this
son
.
When
she
came
,
I
felt
convinced
we
*NL*
should
n't
keep
her
long
;
and
now
,
I
must
tell
you
,
the
winter
will
*NL*
probably
finish
her
.
Do
n't
take
on
,
and
fret
about
it
too
much
:
it
ca
n't
*NL*
be
helped
.
And
besides
,
you
should
have
known
better
than
to
choose
such
*NL*
a
rush
of
a
lass
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
did
the
master
answer
?
'
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
he
swore
:
but
I
did
n't
mind
him
,
I
was
straining
to
see
the
*NL*
bairn
,
'
and
she
began
again
to
describe
it
rapturously
.
I
,
as
zealous
as
*NL*
herself
,
hurried
eagerly
home
to
admire
,
on
my
part
;
though
I
was
very
*NL*
sad
for
Hindley
's
sake
.
He
had
room
in
his
heart
only
for
two
idols
--
his
*NL*
wife
and
himself
:
he
doted
on
both
,
and
adored
one
,
and
I
could
n't
*NL*
conceive
how
he
would
bear
the
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
there
he
stood
at
the
front
door
;
and
,
*NL*
as
I
passed
in
,
I
asked
,
`
how
was
the
baby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nearly
ready
to
run
about
,
Nell
!
'
he
replied
,
putting
on
a
cheerful
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
mistress
?
'
I
ventured
to
inquire
;
`
the
doctor
says
she
's
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
the
doctor
!
'
he
interrupted
,
reddening
.
`
Frances
is
quite
right
:
*NL*
she
'll
be
perfectly
well
by
this
time
next
week
.
Are
you
going
*NL*
up-stairs
?
will
you
tell
her
that
I
'll
come
,
if
she
'll
promise
not
to
*NL*
talk
.
I
left
her
because
she
would
not
hold
her
tongue
;
and
she
*NL*
must
--
tell
her
Mr.
Kenneth
says
she
must
be
quiet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
delivered
this
message
to
Mrs.
Earnshaw
;
she
seemed
in
flighty
spirits
,
*NL*
and
replied
merrily
,
'
I
hardly
spoke
a
word
,
Ellen
,
and
there
he
has
gone
*NL*
out
twice
,
crying
.
Well
,
say
I
promise
I
wo
n't
speak
:
but
that
does
not
*NL*
bind
me
not
to
laugh
at
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
soul
!
Till
within
a
week
of
her
death
that
gay
heart
never
failed
*NL*
her
;
and
her
husband
persisted
doggedly
,
nay
,
furiously
,
in
affirming
her
*NL*
health
improved
every
day
.
When
Kenneth
warned
him
that
his
medicines
*NL*
were
useless
at
that
stage
of
the
malady
,
and
he
need
n't
put
him
to
*NL*
further
expense
by
attending
her
,
he
retorted
,
'
I
know
you
need
not
--
she
's
*NL*
well
--
she
does
not
want
any
more
attendance
from
you
!
She
never
was
in
a
*NL*
consumption
.
It
was
a
fever
;
and
it
is
gone
:
her
pulse
is
as
slow
as
*NL*
mine
now
,
and
her
cheek
as
cool
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
his
wife
the
same
story
,
and
she
seemed
to
believe
him
;
but
one
*NL*
night
,
while
leaning
on
his
shoulder
,
in
the
act
of
saying
she
thought
*NL*
she
should
be
able
to
get
up
to-morrow
,
a
fit
of
coughing
took
her
--
a
*NL*
very
slight
one
--
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
;
she
put
her
two
hands
about
*NL*
his
neck
,
her
face
changed
,
and
she
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
girl
had
anticipated
,
the
child
Hareton
fell
wholly
into
my
hands
.
*NL*
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
provided
he
saw
him
healthy
and
never
heard
him
cry
,
was
*NL*
contented
,
as
far
as
regarded
him
.
For
himself
,
he
grew
desperate
:
his
*NL*
sorrow
was
of
that
kind
that
will
not
lament
.
He
neither
wept
nor
*NL*
prayed
;
he
cursed
and
defied
:
execrated
God
and
man
,
and
gave
himself
up
*NL*
to
reckless
dissipation
.
The
servants
could
not
bear
his
tyrannical
and
*NL*
evil
conduct
long
:
Joseph
and
I
were
the
only
two
that
would
stay
.
I
had
*NL*
not
the
heart
to
leave
my
charge
;
and
besides
,
you
know
,
I
had
been
his
*NL*
foster-sister
,
and
excused
his
behaviour
more
readily
than
a
stranger
*NL*
would
.
Joseph
remained
to
hector
over
tenants
and
labourers
;
and
because
*NL*
it
was
his
vocation
to
be
where
he
had
plenty
of
wickedness
to
reprove
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
's
bad
ways
and
bad
companions
formed
a
pretty
example
for
*NL*
Catherine
and
Heathcliff
.
His
treatment
of
the
latter
was
enough
to
make
*NL*
a
fiend
of
a
saint
.
And
,
truly
,
it
appeared
as
if
the
lad
_
were
_
*NL*
possessed
of
something
diabolical
at
that
period
.
He
delighted
to
*NL*
witness
Hindley
degrading
himself
past
redemption
;
and
became
daily
more
*NL*
notable
for
savage
sullenness
and
ferocity
.
I
could
not
half
tell
what
*NL*
an
infernal
house
we
had
.
The
curate
dropped
calling
,
and
nobody
decent
*NL*
came
near
us
,
at
last
;
unless
Edgar
Linton
's
visits
to
Miss
Cathy
might
*NL*
be
an
exception
.
At
fifteen
she
was
the
queen
of
the
country-side
;
she
*NL*
had
no
peer
;
and
she
did
turn
out
a
haughty
,
headstrong
creature
!
I
own
*NL*
I
did
not
like
her
,
after
infancy
was
past
;
and
I
vexed
her
frequently
by
*NL*
trying
to
bring
down
her
arrogance
:
she
never
took
an
aversion
to
me
,
*NL*
though
.
She
had
a
wondrous
constancy
to
old
attachments
:
even
Heathcliff
*NL*
kept
his
hold
on
her
affections
unalterably
;
and
young
Linton
,
with
all
*NL*
his
superiority
,
found
it
difficult
to
make
an
equally
deep
impression
.
*NL*
He
was
my
late
master
:
that
is
his
portrait
over
the
fireplace
.
It
used
*NL*
to
hang
on
one
side
,
and
his
wife
's
on
the
other
;
but
hers
has
been
*NL*
removed
,
or
else
you
might
see
something
of
what
she
was
.
Can
you
make
*NL*
that
out
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dean
raised
the
candle
,
and
I
discerned
a
soft-featured
face
,
*NL*
exceedingly
resembling
the
young
lady
at
the
Heights
,
but
more
pensive
*NL*
and
amiable
in
expression
.
It
formed
a
sweet
picture
.
The
long
light
*NL*
hair
curled
slightly
on
the
temples
;
the
eyes
were
large
and
serious
;
the
*NL*
figure
almost
too
graceful
.
I
did
not
marvel
how
Catherine
Earnshaw
*NL*
could
forget
her
first
friend
for
such
an
individual
.
I
marvelled
much
*NL*
how
he
,
with
a
mind
to
correspond
with
his
person
,
could
fancy
my
idea
of
*NL*
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
very
agreeable
portrait
,
'
I
observed
to
the
house-keeper
.
`
Is
it
*NL*
like
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
she
answered
;
`
but
he
looked
better
when
he
was
animated
;
that
is
*NL*
his
everyday
countenance
:
he
wanted
spirit
in
general
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
had
kept
up
her
acquaintance
with
the
Lintons
since
her
*NL*
five-weeks
'
residence
among
them
;
and
as
she
had
no
temptation
to
show
*NL*
her
rough
side
in
their
company
,
and
had
the
sense
to
be
ashamed
of
*NL*
being
rude
where
she
experienced
such
invariable
courtesy
,
she
imposed
*NL*
unwittingly
on
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
by
her
ingenious
cordiality
;
*NL*
gained
the
admiration
of
Isabella
,
and
the
heart
and
soul
of
her
*NL*
brother
:
acquisitions
that
flattered
her
from
the
first
--
for
she
was
*NL*
full
of
ambition
--
and
led
her
to
adopt
a
double
character
without
*NL*
exactly
intending
to
deceive
any
one
.
In
the
place
where
she
heard
*NL*
Heathcliff
termed
a
`
vulgar
young
ruffian
,
'
and
`
worse
than
a
brute
,
'
*NL*
she
took
care
not
to
act
like
him
;
but
at
home
she
had
small
inclination
*NL*
to
practise
politeness
that
would
only
be
laughed
at
,
and
restrain
an
*NL*
unruly
nature
when
it
would
bring
her
neither
credit
nor
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Edgar
seldom
mustered
courage
to
visit
Wuthering
Heights
openly
.
He
*NL*
had
a
terror
of
Earnshaw
's
reputation
,
and
shrunk
from
encountering
him
;
*NL*
and
yet
he
was
always
received
with
our
best
attempts
at
civility
:
the
*NL*
master
himself
avoided
offending
him
,
knowing
why
he
came
;
and
if
he
*NL*
could
not
be
gracious
,
kept
out
of
the
way
.
I
rather
think
his
*NL*
appearance
there
was
distasteful
to
Catherine
;
she
was
not
artful
,
never
*NL*
played
the
coquette
,
and
had
evidently
an
objection
to
her
two
friends
*NL*
meeting
at
all
;
for
when
Heathcliff
expressed
contempt
of
Linton
in
his
*NL*
presence
,
she
could
not
half
coincide
,
as
she
did
in
his
absence
;
and
*NL*
when
Linton
evinced
disgust
and
antipathy
to
Heathcliff
,
she
dared
not
*NL*
treat
his
sentiments
with
indifference
,
as
if
depreciation
of
her
*NL*
playmate
were
of
scarcely
any
consequence
to
her
.
I
've
had
many
a
laugh
*NL*
at
her
perplexities
and
untold
troubles
,
which
she
vainly
strove
to
hide
*NL*
from
my
mockery
.
That
sounds
ill-natured
:
but
she
was
so
proud
it
became
*NL*
really
impossible
to
pity
her
distresses
,
till
she
should
be
chastened
*NL*
into
more
humility
.
She
did
bring
herself
,
finally
,
to
confess
,
and
to
*NL*
confide
in
me
:
there
was
not
a
soul
else
that
she
might
fashion
into
an
*NL*
adviser
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hindley
had
gone
from
home
one
afternoon
,
and
Heathcliff
presumed
to
*NL*
give
himself
a
holiday
on
the
strength
of
it
.
He
had
reached
the
age
of
*NL*
sixteen
then
,
I
think
,
and
without
having
bad
features
,
or
being
*NL*
deficient
in
intellect
,
he
contrived
to
convey
an
impression
of
inward
*NL*
and
outward
repulsiveness
that
his
present
aspect
retains
no
traces
of
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
he
had
by
that
time
lost
the
benefit
of
his
early
*NL*
education
:
continual
hard
work
,
begun
soon
and
concluded
late
,
had
*NL*
extinguished
any
curiosity
he
once
possessed
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
,
and
*NL*
any
love
for
books
or
learning
.
His
childhood
's
sense
of
superiority
,
*NL*
instilled
into
him
by
the
favours
of
old
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
was
faded
away
.
He
*NL*
struggled
long
to
keep
up
an
equality
with
Catherine
in
her
studies
,
and
*NL*
yielded
with
poignant
though
silent
regret
:
but
he
yielded
completely
;
*NL*
and
there
was
no
prevailing
on
him
to
take
a
step
in
the
way
of
moving
*NL*
upward
,
when
he
found
he
must
,
necessarily
,
sink
beneath
his
former
*NL*
level
.
Then
personal
appearance
sympathised
with
mental
deterioration
:
*NL*
he
acquired
a
slouching
gait
and
ignoble
look
;
his
naturally
reserved
*NL*
disposition
was
exaggerated
into
an
almost
idiotic
excess
of
unsociable
*NL*
moroseness
;
and
he
took
a
grim
pleasure
,
apparently
,
in
exciting
the
*NL*
aversion
rather
than
the
esteem
of
his
few
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
and
he
were
constant
companions
still
at
his
seasons
of
respite
*NL*
from
labour
;
but
he
had
ceased
to
express
his
fondness
for
her
in
words
,
*NL*
and
recoiled
with
angry
suspicion
from
her
girlish
caresses
,
as
if
*NL*
conscious
there
could
be
no
gratification
in
lavishing
such
marks
of
*NL*
affection
on
him
.
On
the
before-named
occasion
he
came
into
the
house
to
*NL*
announce
his
intention
of
doing
nothing
,
while
I
was
assisting
Miss
Cathy
*NL*
to
arrange
her
dress
:
she
had
not
reckoned
on
his
taking
it
into
his
head
*NL*
to
be
idle
;
and
imagining
she
would
have
the
whole
place
to
herself
,
she
*NL*
managed
,
by
some
means
,
to
inform
Mr.
Edgar
of
her
brother
's
absence
,
and
*NL*
was
then
preparing
to
receive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cathy
,
are
you
busy
this
afternoon
?
'
asked
Heathcliff
.
`
Are
you
going
*NL*
anywhere
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
it
is
raining
,
'
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
have
you
that
silk
frock
on
,
then
?
'
he
said
.
`
Nobody
coming
here
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
that
I
know
of
,
'
stammered
Miss
:
`
but
you
should
be
in
the
field
*NL*
now
,
Heathcliff
.
It
is
an
hour
past
dinnertime
:
I
thought
you
were
*NL*
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hindley
does
not
often
free
us
from
his
accursed
presence
,
'
observed
the
*NL*
boy
.
`
I
'll
not
work
any
more
to-day
:
I
'll
stay
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
but
Joseph
will
tell
,
'
she
suggested
;
`
you
'd
better
go
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Joseph
is
loading
lime
on
the
further
side
of
Penistone
Crags
;
it
will
*NL*
take
him
till
dark
,
and
he
'll
never
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
saying
,
he
lounged
to
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
.
Catherine
reflected
an
*NL*
instant
,
with
knitted
brows
--
she
found
it
needful
to
smooth
the
way
for
*NL*
an
intrusion
.
`
Isabella
and
Edgar
Linton
talked
of
calling
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
'
she
said
,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
minute
's
silence
.
`
As
it
*NL*
rains
,
I
hardly
expect
them
;
but
they
may
come
,
and
if
they
do
,
you
run
*NL*
the
risk
of
being
scolded
for
no
good
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Order
Ellen
to
say
you
are
engaged
,
Cathy
,
'
he
persisted
;
`
do
n't
turn
me
*NL*
out
for
those
pitiful
,
silly
friends
of
yours
!
I
'm
on
the
point
,
*NL*
sometimes
,
of
complaining
that
they
--
but
I
'll
not
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
they
what
?
'
cried
Catherine
,
gazing
at
him
with
a
troubled
*NL*
countenance
.
`
Oh
,
Nelly
!
'
she
added
petulantly
,
jerking
her
head
away
*NL*
from
my
hands
,
`
you
've
combed
my
hair
quite
out
of
curl
!
That
's
enough
;
*NL*
let
me
alone
.
What
are
you
on
the
point
of
complaining
about
,
*NL*
Heathcliff
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
--
only
look
at
the
almanack
on
that
wall
;
'
he
pointed
to
a
framed
*NL*
sheet
hanging
near
the
window
,
and
continued
,
`
The
crosses
are
for
the
*NL*
evenings
you
have
spent
with
the
Lintons
,
the
dots
for
those
spent
with
*NL*
me
.
Do
you
see
?
I
've
marked
every
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
--
very
foolish
:
as
if
I
took
notice
!
'
replied
Catherine
,
in
a
peevish
*NL*
tone
.
`
And
where
is
the
sense
of
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
show
that
I
_
do
_
take
notice
,
'
said
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
should
I
always
be
sitting
with
you
?
'
she
demanded
,
growing
more
*NL*
irritated
.
`
What
good
do
I
get
?
What
do
you
talk
about
?
You
might
be
*NL*
dumb
,
or
a
baby
,
for
anything
you
say
to
amuse
me
,
or
for
anything
you
*NL*
do
,
either
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
never
told
me
before
that
I
talked
too
little
,
or
that
you
disliked
*NL*
my
company
,
Cathy
!
'
exclaimed
Heathcliff
,
in
much
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
no
company
at
all
,
when
people
know
nothing
and
say
nothing
,
'
she
*NL*
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
rose
up
,
but
he
had
n't
time
to
express
his
feelings
*NL*
further
,
for
a
horse
's
feet
were
heard
on
the
flags
,
and
having
knocked
*NL*
gently
,
young
Linton
entered
,
his
face
brilliant
with
delight
at
the
*NL*
unexpected
summon
she
had
received
.
Doubtless
Catherine
marked
the
*NL*
difference
between
her
friends
,
as
one
came
in
and
the
other
went
out
.
*NL*
The
contrast
resembled
what
you
see
in
exchanging
a
bleak
,
hilly
,
coal
*NL*
country
for
a
beautiful
fertile
valley
;
and
his
voice
and
greeting
were
*NL*
as
opposite
as
his
aspect
.
He
had
a
sweet
,
low
manner
of
speaking
,
and
*NL*
pronounced
his
words
as
you
do
:
that
's
less
gruff
than
we
talk
here
,
and
*NL*
softer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
come
too
soon
,
am
I
?
'
he
said
,
casting
a
look
at
me
:
I
had
begun
*NL*
to
wipe
the
plate
,
and
tidy
some
drawers
at
the
far
end
in
the
dresser
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
answered
Catherine
.
`
What
are
you
doing
there
,
Nelly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
work
,
Miss
,
'
I
replied
.
-LRB-
Mr.
Hindley
had
given
me
directions
to
make
*NL*
a
third
party
in
any
private
visits
Linton
chose
to
pay
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
She
stepped
behind
me
and
whispered
crossly
,
`
Take
yourself
and
your
*NL*
dusters
off
;
when
company
are
in
the
house
,
servants
do
n't
commence
*NL*
scouring
and
cleaning
in
the
room
where
they
are
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
good
opportunity
,
now
that
master
is
away
,
'
I
answered
aloud
:
`
he
*NL*
hates
me
to
be
fidgeting
over
these
things
in
his
presence
.
I
'm
sure
Mr.
*NL*
Edgar
will
excuse
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hate
you
to
be
fidgeting
in
_
my
_
presence
,
'
exclaimed
the
young
lady
*NL*
imperiously
,
not
allowing
her
guest
time
to
speak
:
she
had
failed
to
*NL*
recover
her
equanimity
since
the
little
dispute
with
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
Miss
Catherine
,
'
was
my
response
;
and
I
proceeded
*NL*
assiduously
with
my
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
supposing
Edgar
could
not
see
her
,
snatched
the
cloth
from
my
hand
,
*NL*
and
pinched
me
,
with
a
prolonged
wrench
,
very
spitefully
on
the
arm
.
I
've
*NL*
said
I
did
not
love
her
,
and
rather
relished
mortifying
her
vanity
now
*NL*
and
then
:
besides
,
she
hurt
me
extremely
;
so
I
started
up
from
my
knees
,
*NL*
and
screamed
out
,
`
Oh
,
Miss
,
that
's
a
nasty
trick
!
You
have
no
right
to
*NL*
nip
me
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
bear
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
touch
you
,
you
lying
creature
!
'
cried
she
,
her
fingers
tingling
*NL*
to
repeat
the
act
,
and
her
ears
red
with
rage
.
She
never
had
power
to
*NL*
conceal
her
passion
,
it
always
set
her
whole
complexion
in
a
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
that
,
then
?
'
I
retorted
,
showing
a
decided
purple
witness
to
*NL*
refute
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stamped
her
foot
,
wavered
a
moment
,
and
then
,
irresistibly
impelled
*NL*
by
the
naughty
spirit
within
her
,
slapped
me
on
the
cheek
:
a
stinging
*NL*
blow
that
filled
both
eyes
with
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
,
love
!
Catherine
!
'
interposed
Linton
,
greatly
shocked
at
the
*NL*
double
fault
of
falsehood
and
violence
which
his
idol
had
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Leave
the
room
,
Ellen
!
'
she
repeated
,
trembling
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Hareton
,
who
followed
me
everywhere
,
and
was
sitting
near
me
on
*NL*
the
floor
,
at
seeing
my
tears
commenced
crying
himself
,
and
sobbed
out
*NL*
complaints
against
`
wicked
aunt
Cathy
,
'
which
drew
her
fury
on
to
his
*NL*
unlucky
head
:
she
seized
his
shoulders
,
and
shook
him
till
the
poor
child
*NL*
waxed
livid
,
and
Edgar
thoughtlessly
laid
hold
of
her
hands
to
deliver
*NL*
him
.
In
an
instant
one
was
wrung
free
,
and
the
astonished
young
man
felt
*NL*
it
applied
over
his
own
ear
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
mistaken
for
jest
.
*NL*
He
drew
back
in
consternation
.
I
lifted
Hareton
in
my
arms
,
and
walked
*NL*
off
to
the
kitchen
with
him
,
leaving
the
door
of
communication
open
,
for
*NL*
I
was
curious
to
watch
how
they
would
settle
their
disagreement
.
The
*NL*
insulted
visitor
moved
to
the
spot
where
he
had
laid
his
hat
,
pale
and
*NL*
with
a
quivering
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
!
'
I
said
to
myself
.
`
Take
warning
and
begone
!
It
's
a
*NL*
kindness
to
let
you
have
a
glimpse
of
her
genuine
disposition
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
are
you
going
?
'
demanded
Catherine
,
advancing
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
swerved
aside
,
and
attempted
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
not
go
!
'
she
exclaimed
,
energetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
and
shall
!
'
he
replied
in
a
subdued
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
she
persisted
,
grasping
the
handle
;
`
not
yet
,
Edgar
Linton
:
sit
*NL*
down
;
you
shall
not
leave
me
in
that
temper
.
I
should
be
miserable
all
*NL*
night
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
miserable
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
I
stay
after
you
have
struck
me
?
'
asked
Linton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
was
mute
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
've
made
me
afraid
and
ashamed
of
you
,
'
he
continued
;
`
I
'll
not
come
*NL*
here
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
began
to
glisten
and
her
lids
to
twinkle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
told
a
deliberate
untruth
!
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
!
'
she
cried
,
recovering
her
speech
;
'
I
did
nothing
*NL*
deliberately
.
Well
,
go
,
if
you
please
--
get
away
!
And
now
I
'll
cry
--
I
'll
*NL*
cry
myself
sick
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
down
on
her
knees
by
a
chair
,
and
set
to
weeping
in
serious
*NL*
earnest
.
Edgar
persevered
in
his
resolution
as
far
as
the
court
;
there
*NL*
he
lingered
.
I
resolved
to
encourage
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Miss
is
dreadfully
wayward
,
sir
,
'
I
called
out
.
`
As
bad
as
any
marred
*NL*
child
:
you
'd
better
be
riding
home
,
or
else
she
will
be
sick
,
only
to
*NL*
grieve
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
soft
thing
looked
askance
through
the
window
:
he
possessed
the
power
*NL*
to
depart
as
much
as
a
cat
possesses
the
power
to
leave
a
mouse
half
*NL*
killed
,
or
a
bird
half
eaten
.
Ah
,
I
thought
,
there
will
be
no
saving
*NL*
him
:
he
's
doomed
,
and
flies
to
his
fate
!
And
so
it
was
:
he
turned
*NL*
abruptly
,
hastened
into
the
house
again
,
shut
the
door
behind
him
;
and
*NL*
when
I
went
in
a
while
after
to
inform
them
that
Earnshaw
had
come
home
*NL*
rabid
drunk
,
ready
to
pull
the
whole
place
about
our
ears
-LRB-
his
ordinary
*NL*
frame
of
mind
in
that
condition
-RRB-
,
I
saw
the
quarrel
had
merely
effected
a
*NL*
closer
intimacy
--
had
broken
the
outworks
of
youthful
timidity
,
and
*NL*
enabled
them
to
forsake
the
disguise
of
friendship
,
and
confess
*NL*
themselves
lovers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Intelligence
of
Mr.
Hindley
's
arrival
drove
Linton
speedily
to
his
horse
,
*NL*
and
Catherine
to
her
chamber
.
I
went
to
hide
little
Hareton
,
and
to
take
*NL*
the
shot
out
of
the
master
's
fowling-piece
,
which
he
was
fond
of
playing
*NL*
with
in
his
insane
excitement
,
to
the
hazard
of
the
lives
of
any
who
*NL*
provoked
,
or
even
attracted
his
notice
too
much
;
and
I
had
hit
upon
the
*NL*
plan
of
removing
it
,
that
he
might
do
less
mischief
if
he
did
go
the
*NL*
length
of
firing
the
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
,
vociferating
oaths
dreadful
to
hear
;
and
caught
me
in
the
act
*NL*
of
stowing
his
son
away
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
.
Hareton
was
impressed
*NL*
with
a
wholesome
terror
of
encountering
either
his
wild
beast
's
fondness
*NL*
or
his
madman
's
rage
;
for
in
one
he
ran
a
chance
of
being
squeezed
and
*NL*
kissed
to
death
,
and
in
the
other
of
being
flung
into
the
fire
,
or
dashed
*NL*
against
the
wall
;
and
the
poor
thing
remained
perfectly
quiet
wherever
I
*NL*
chose
to
put
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
I
've
found
it
out
at
last
!
'
cried
Hindley
,
pulling
me
back
by
the
*NL*
skin
of
my
neck
,
like
a
dog
.
`
By
heaven
and
hell
,
you
've
sworn
between
*NL*
you
to
murder
that
child
!
I
know
how
it
is
,
now
,
that
he
is
always
out
*NL*
of
my
way
.
But
,
with
the
help
of
Satan
,
I
shall
make
you
swallow
the
*NL*
carving-knife
,
Nelly
!
You
need
n't
laugh
;
for
I
've
just
crammed
Kenneth
,
*NL*
head-downmost
,
in
the
Black-horse
marsh
;
and
two
is
the
same
as
one
--
and
*NL*
I
want
to
kill
some
of
you
:
I
shall
have
no
rest
till
I
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
do
n't
like
the
carving-knife
,
Mr.
Hindley
,
'
I
answered
;
`
it
has
*NL*
been
cutting
red
herrings
.
I
'd
rather
be
shot
,
if
you
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
rather
be
damned
!
'
he
said
;
`
and
so
you
shall
.
No
law
in
England
*NL*
can
hinder
a
man
from
keeping
his
house
decent
,
and
mine
's
abominable
!
*NL*
Open
your
mouth
.
'
He
held
the
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
pushed
its
point
*NL*
between
my
teeth
:
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
was
never
much
afraid
of
his
*NL*
vagaries
.
I
spat
out
,
and
affirmed
it
tasted
detestably
--
I
would
not
*NL*
take
it
on
any
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
he
,
releasing
me
,
'
I
see
that
hideous
little
villain
is
not
*NL*
Hareton
:
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Nell
.
If
it
be
,
he
deserves
flaying
alive
*NL*
for
not
running
to
welcome
me
,
and
for
screaming
as
if
I
were
a
goblin
.
*NL*
Unnatural
cub
,
come
hither
!
I
'll
teach
thee
to
impose
on
a
good-hearted
,
*NL*
deluded
father
.
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
the
lad
would
be
handsomer
cropped
?
*NL*
It
makes
a
dog
fiercer
,
and
I
love
something
fierce
--
get
me
a
*NL*
scissors
--
something
fierce
and
trim
!
Besides
,
it
's
infernal
*NL*
affectation
--
devilish
conceit
it
is
,
to
cherish
our
ears
--
we
're
asses
*NL*
enough
without
them
.
Hush
,
child
,
hush
!
Well
then
,
it
is
my
darling
!
*NL*
wisht
,
dry
thy
eyes
--
there
's
a
joy
;
kiss
me
.
What
!
it
wo
n't
?
Kiss
me
,
*NL*
Hareton
!
Damn
thee
,
kiss
me
!
By
God
,
as
if
I
would
rear
such
a
monster
!
*NL*
As
sure
as
I
'm
living
,
I
'll
break
the
brat
's
neck
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Hareton
was
squalling
and
kicking
in
his
father
's
arms
with
all
his
*NL*
might
,
and
redoubled
his
yells
when
he
carried
him
up-stairs
and
lifted
*NL*
him
over
the
banister
.
I
cried
out
that
he
would
frighten
the
child
into
*NL*
fits
,
and
ran
to
rescue
him
.
As
I
reached
them
,
Hindley
leant
forward
on
*NL*
the
rails
to
listen
to
a
noise
below
;
almost
forgetting
what
he
had
in
*NL*
his
hands
.
`
Who
is
that
?
'
he
asked
,
hearing
some
one
approaching
the
*NL*
stairs
'
-
foot
.
I
leant
forward
also
,
for
the
purpose
of
signing
to
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
whose
step
I
recognised
,
not
to
come
further
;
and
,
at
the
*NL*
instant
when
my
eye
quitted
Hareton
,
he
gave
a
sudden
spring
,
delivered
*NL*
himself
from
the
careless
grasp
that
held
him
,
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
scarcely
time
to
experience
a
thrill
of
horror
before
we
saw
*NL*
that
the
little
wretch
was
safe
.
Heathcliff
arrived
underneath
just
at
*NL*
the
critical
moment
;
by
a
natural
impulse
he
arrested
his
descent
,
and
*NL*
setting
him
on
his
feet
,
looked
up
to
discover
the
author
of
the
*NL*
accident
.
A
miser
who
has
parted
with
a
lucky
lottery
ticket
for
five
*NL*
shillings
,
and
finds
next
day
he
has
lost
in
the
bargain
five
thousand
*NL*
pounds
,
could
not
show
a
blanker
countenance
than
he
did
on
beholding
the
*NL*
figure
of
Mr.
Earnshaw
above
.
It
expressed
,
plainer
than
words
could
do
,
*NL*
the
intensest
anguish
at
having
made
himself
the
instrument
of
thwarting
*NL*
his
own
revenge
.
Had
it
been
dark
,
I
daresay
he
would
have
tried
to
*NL*
remedy
the
mistake
by
smashing
Hareton
's
skull
on
the
steps
;
but
,
we
*NL*
witnessed
his
salvation
;
and
I
was
presently
below
with
my
precious
*NL*
charge
pressed
to
my
heart
.
Hindley
descended
more
leisurely
,
sobered
*NL*
and
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
your
fault
,
Ellen
,
'
he
said
;
`
you
should
have
kept
him
out
of
*NL*
sight
:
you
should
have
taken
him
from
me
!
Is
he
injured
anywhere
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Injured
!
'
I
cried
angrily
;
`
if
he
is
not
killed
,
he
'll
be
an
idiot
!
Oh
!
*NL*
I
wonder
his
mother
does
not
rise
from
her
grave
to
see
how
you
use
him
.
*NL*
You
're
worse
than
a
heathen
--
treating
your
own
flesh
and
blood
in
that
*NL*
manner
!
'
He
attempted
to
touch
the
child
,
who
,
on
finding
himself
with
*NL*
me
,
sobbed
off
his
terror
directly
.
At
the
first
finger
his
father
laid
*NL*
on
him
,
however
,
he
shrieked
again
louder
than
before
,
and
struggled
as
*NL*
if
he
would
go
into
convulsions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shall
not
meddle
with
him
!
'
I
continued
.
`
He
hates
you
--
they
all
*NL*
hate
you
--
that
's
the
truth
!
A
happy
family
you
have
;
and
a
pretty
state
*NL*
you
're
come
to
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
come
to
a
prettier
,
yet
,
Nelly
,
'
laughed
the
misguided
man
,
*NL*
recovering
his
hardness
.
`
At
present
,
convey
yourself
and
him
away
.
And
*NL*
hark
you
,
Heathcliff
!
clear
you
too
quite
from
my
reach
and
hearing
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
murder
you
to-night
;
unless
,
perhaps
,
I
set
the
house
on
fire
:
*NL*
but
that
's
as
my
fancy
goes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
While
saying
this
he
took
a
pint
bottle
of
brandy
from
the
dresser
,
and
*NL*
poured
some
into
a
tumbler
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
do
n't
!
'
I
entreated
.
`
Mr.
Hindley
,
do
take
warning
.
Have
mercy
on
*NL*
this
unfortunate
boy
,
if
you
care
nothing
for
yourself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Any
one
will
do
better
for
him
than
I
shall
,
'
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
mercy
on
your
own
soul
!
'
I
said
,
endeavouring
to
snatch
the
glass
*NL*
from
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
I
!
On
the
contrary
,
I
shall
have
great
pleasure
in
sending
it
to
*NL*
perdition
to
punish
its
Maker
,
'
exclaimed
the
blasphemer
.
`
Here
's
to
its
*NL*
hearty
damnation
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
the
spirits
and
impatiently
bade
us
go
;
terminating
his
command
*NL*
with
a
sequel
of
horrid
imprecations
too
bad
to
repeat
or
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
pity
he
can
not
kill
himself
with
drink
,
'
observed
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
muttering
an
echo
of
curses
back
when
the
door
was
shut
.
`
He
's
doing
his
*NL*
very
utmost
;
but
his
constitution
defies
him
.
Mr.
Kenneth
says
he
would
*NL*
wager
his
mare
that
he
'll
outlive
any
man
on
this
side
Gimmerton
,
and
go
*NL*
to
the
grave
a
hoary
sinner
;
unless
some
happy
chance
out
of
the
common
*NL*
course
befall
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
kitchen
,
and
sat
down
to
lull
my
little
lamb
to
sleep
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
as
I
thought
,
walked
through
to
the
barn
.
It
turned
out
*NL*
afterwards
that
he
only
got
as
far
as
the
other
side
the
settle
,
when
he
*NL*
flung
himself
on
a
bench
by
the
wall
,
removed
from
the
fire
and
remained
*NL*
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
rocking
Hareton
on
my
knee
,
and
humming
a
song
that
began
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
far
in
the
night
,
and
the
bairnies
grat
,
*NL*
The
mither
beneath
the
mools
heard
that
,
*NL*
*NL*
when
Miss
Cathy
,
who
had
listened
to
the
hubbub
from
her
room
,
put
her
*NL*
head
in
,
and
whispered
,
--
`
Are
you
alone
,
Nelly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Miss
,
'
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
and
approached
the
hearth
.
I
,
supposing
she
was
going
to
say
*NL*
something
,
looked
up
.
The
expression
of
her
face
seemed
disturbed
and
*NL*
anxious
.
Her
lips
were
half
asunder
,
as
if
she
meant
to
speak
,
and
she
*NL*
drew
a
breath
;
but
it
escaped
in
a
sigh
instead
of
a
sentence
.
I
resumed
*NL*
my
song
;
not
having
forgotten
her
recent
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
's
Heathcliff
?
'
she
said
,
interrupting
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
his
work
in
the
stable
,
'
was
my
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
contradict
me
;
perhaps
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
.
There
*NL*
followed
another
long
pause
,
during
which
I
perceived
a
drop
or
two
*NL*
trickle
from
Catherine
's
cheek
to
the
flags
.
Is
she
sorry
for
her
*NL*
shameful
conduct
?
--
I
asked
myself
.
That
will
be
a
novelty
:
but
she
may
*NL*
come
to
the
point
--
as
she
will
--
I
sha
'n'
t
help
her
!
No
,
she
felt
small
*NL*
trouble
regarding
any
subject
,
save
her
own
concerns
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
dear
!
'
she
cried
at
last
.
`
I
'm
very
unhappy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
pity
,
'
observed
I.
`
You
're
hard
to
please
;
so
many
friends
and
so
few
*NL*
cares
,
and
ca
n't
make
yourself
content
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nelly
,
will
you
keep
a
secret
for
me
?
'
she
pursued
,
kneeling
down
by
me
,
*NL*
and
lifting
her
winsome
eyes
to
my
face
with
that
sort
of
look
which
*NL*
turns
off
bad
temper
,
even
when
one
has
all
the
right
in
the
world
to
*NL*
indulge
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
worth
keeping
?
'
I
inquired
,
less
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
and
it
worries
me
,
and
I
must
let
it
out
!
I
want
to
know
what
I
*NL*
should
do
.
To-day
,
Edgar
Linton
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
,
and
I
've
*NL*
given
him
an
answer
.
Now
,
before
I
tell
you
whether
it
was
a
consent
or
*NL*
denial
,
you
tell
me
which
it
ought
to
have
been
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Really
,
Miss
Catherine
,
how
can
I
know
?
'
I
replied
.
`
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
considering
the
exhibition
you
performed
in
his
presence
this
afternoon
,
*NL*
I
might
say
it
would
be
wise
to
refuse
him
:
since
he
asked
you
after
*NL*
that
,
he
must
either
be
hopelessly
stupid
or
a
venturesome
fool
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
talk
so
,
I
wo
n't
tell
you
any
more
,
'
she
returned
,
peevishly
*NL*
rising
to
her
feet
.
'
I
accepted
him
,
Nelly
.
Be
quick
,
and
say
whether
I
*NL*
was
wrong
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
accepted
him
!
Then
what
good
is
it
discussing
the
matter
?
You
have
*NL*
pledged
your
word
,
and
can
not
retract
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
say
whether
I
should
have
done
so
--
do
!
'
she
exclaimed
in
an
*NL*
irritated
tone
;
chafing
her
hands
together
,
and
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
are
many
things
to
be
considered
before
that
question
can
be
*NL*
answered
properly
,
'
I
said
,
sententiously
.
`
First
and
foremost
,
do
you
*NL*
love
Mr.
Edgar
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
can
help
it
?
Of
course
I
do
,
'
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
put
her
through
the
following
catechism
:
for
a
girl
of
twenty-two
*NL*
it
was
not
injudicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
do
you
love
him
,
Miss
Cathy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
,
I
do
--
that
's
sufficient
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
no
means
;
you
must
say
why
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
because
he
is
handsome
,
and
pleasant
to
be
with
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bad
!
'
was
my
commentary
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
because
he
is
young
and
cheerful
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Bad
,
still
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
because
he
loves
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indifferent
,
coming
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
will
be
rich
,
and
I
shall
like
to
be
the
greatest
woman
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
and
I
shall
be
proud
of
having
such
a
husband
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Worst
of
all
.
And
now
,
say
how
you
love
him
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
everybody
loves
--
You
're
silly
,
Nelly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
all
--
Answer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
love
the
ground
under
his
feet
,
and
the
air
over
his
head
,
and
*NL*
everything
he
touches
,
and
every
word
he
says
.
I
love
all
his
looks
,
and
*NL*
all
his
actions
,
and
him
entirely
and
altogether
.
There
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
why
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
;
you
are
making
a
jest
of
it
:
it
is
exceedingly
ill-natured
!
It
's
*NL*
no
jest
to
me
!
'
said
the
young
lady
,
scowling
,
and
turning
her
face
to
*NL*
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
very
far
from
jesting
,
Miss
Catherine
,
'
I
replied
.
`
You
love
Mr.
*NL*
Edgar
because
he
is
handsome
,
and
young
,
and
cheerful
,
and
rich
,
and
*NL*
loves
you
.
The
last
,
however
,
goes
for
nothing
:
you
would
love
him
*NL*
without
that
,
probably
;
and
with
it
you
would
n't
,
unless
he
possessed
the
*NL*
four
former
attractions
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
to
be
sure
not
:
I
should
only
pity
him
--
hate
him
,
perhaps
,
if
he
*NL*
were
ugly
,
and
a
clown
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
there
are
several
other
handsome
,
rich
young
men
in
the
world
:
*NL*
handsomer
,
possibly
,
and
richer
than
he
is
.
What
should
hinder
you
from
*NL*
loving
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
there
be
any
,
they
are
out
of
my
way
:
I
've
seen
none
like
Edgar
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
see
some
;
and
he
wo
n't
always
be
handsome
,
and
young
,
and
may
*NL*
not
always
be
rich
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
now
;
and
I
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
.
I
wish
you
would
*NL*
speak
rationally
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
that
settles
it
:
if
you
have
only
to
do
with
the
present
,
marry
*NL*
Mr.
Linton
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
want
your
permission
for
that
--
I
_
shall
_
marry
him
:
and
yet
you
*NL*
have
not
told
me
whether
I
'm
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perfectly
right
;
if
people
be
right
to
marry
only
for
the
present
.
And
*NL*
now
,
let
us
hear
what
you
are
unhappy
about
.
Your
brother
will
be
*NL*
pleased
;
the
old
lady
and
gentleman
will
not
object
,
I
think
;
you
will
*NL*
escape
from
a
disorderly
,
comfortless
home
into
a
wealthy
,
respectable
*NL*
one
;
and
you
love
Edgar
,
and
Edgar
loves
you
.
All
seems
smooth
and
easy
:
*NL*
where
is
the
obstacle
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Here
_
!
and
_
here
_
!
'
replied
Catherine
,
striking
one
hand
on
her
*NL*
forehead
,
and
the
other
on
her
breast
:
`
in
whichever
place
the
soul
*NL*
lives
.
In
my
soul
and
in
my
heart
,
I
'm
convinced
I
'm
wrong
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
very
strange
!
I
can
not
make
it
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
my
secret
.
But
if
you
will
not
mock
at
me
,
I
'll
explain
it
:
I
*NL*
ca
n't
do
it
distinctly
;
but
I
'll
give
you
a
feeling
of
how
I
feel
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
seated
herself
by
me
again
:
her
countenance
grew
sadder
and
graver
,
*NL*
and
her
clasped
hands
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nelly
,
do
you
never
dream
queer
dreams
?
'
she
said
,
suddenly
,
after
some
*NL*
minutes
'
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
now
and
then
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
do
I.
I
've
dreamt
in
my
life
dreams
that
have
stayed
with
me
*NL*
ever
after
,
and
changed
my
ideas
:
they
've
gone
through
and
through
me
,
*NL*
like
wine
through
water
,
and
altered
the
colour
of
my
mind
.
And
this
is
*NL*
one
:
I
'm
going
to
tell
it
--
but
take
care
not
to
smile
at
any
part
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
do
n't
,
Miss
Catherine
!
'
I
cried
.
`
We
're
dismal
enough
without
*NL*
conjuring
up
ghosts
and
visions
to
perplex
us
.
Come
,
come
,
be
merry
and
*NL*
like
yourself
!
Look
at
little
Hareton
!
_
he
's
_
dreaming
nothing
dreary
.
*NL*
How
sweetly
he
smiles
in
his
sleep
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
and
how
sweetly
his
father
curses
in
his
solitude
!
You
remember
*NL*
him
,
I
daresay
,
when
he
was
just
such
another
as
that
chubby
thing
:
*NL*
nearly
as
young
and
innocent
.
However
,
Nelly
,
I
shall
oblige
you
to
*NL*
listen
:
it
's
not
long
;
and
I
've
no
power
to
be
merry
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
hear
it
,
I
wo
n't
hear
it
!
'
I
repeated
,
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
superstitious
about
dreams
then
,
and
am
still
;
and
Catherine
had
an
*NL*
unusual
gloom
in
her
aspect
,
that
made
me
dread
something
from
which
I
*NL*
might
shape
a
prophecy
,
and
foresee
a
fearful
catastrophe
.
She
was
*NL*
vexed
,
but
she
did
not
proceed
.
Apparently
taking
up
another
subject
,
*NL*
she
recommenced
in
a
short
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
were
in
heaven
,
Nelly
,
I
should
be
extremely
miserable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
you
are
not
fit
to
go
there
,
'
I
answered
.
`
All
sinners
would
be
*NL*
miserable
in
heaven
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
is
not
for
that
.
I
dreamt
once
that
I
was
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
hearken
to
your
dreams
,
Miss
Catherine
!
I
'll
go
to
*NL*
bed
,
'
I
interrupted
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
,
and
held
me
down
;
for
I
made
a
motion
to
leave
my
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
nothing
,
'
cried
she
:
'
I
was
only
going
to
say
that
heaven
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
my
home
;
and
I
broke
my
heart
with
weeping
to
come
back
to
*NL*
earth
;
and
the
angels
were
so
angry
that
they
flung
me
out
into
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
heath
on
the
top
of
Wuthering
Heights
;
where
I
woke
sobbing
*NL*
for
joy
.
That
will
do
to
explain
my
secret
,
as
well
as
the
other
.
I
've
*NL*
no
more
business
to
marry
Edgar
Linton
than
I
have
to
be
in
heaven
;
and
*NL*
if
the
wicked
man
in
there
had
not
brought
Heathcliff
so
low
,
I
should
n't
*NL*
have
thought
of
it
.
It
would
degrade
me
to
marry
Heathcliff
now
;
so
he
*NL*
shall
never
know
how
I
love
him
:
and
that
,
not
because
he
's
handsome
,
*NL*
Nelly
,
but
because
he
's
more
myself
than
I
am
.
Whatever
our
souls
are
*NL*
made
of
,
his
and
mine
are
the
same
;
and
Linton
's
is
as
different
as
a
*NL*
moonbeam
from
lightning
,
or
frost
from
fire
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
this
speech
ended
I
became
sensible
of
Heathcliff
's
presence
.
Having
*NL*
noticed
a
slight
movement
,
I
turned
my
head
,
and
saw
him
rise
from
the
*NL*
bench
,
and
steal
out
noiselessly
.
He
had
listened
till
he
heard
*NL*
Catherine
say
it
would
degrade
her
to
marry
him
,
and
then
he
stayed
to
*NL*
hear
no
further
.
My
companion
,
sitting
on
the
ground
,
was
prevented
by
*NL*
the
back
of
the
settle
from
remarking
his
presence
or
departure
;
but
I
*NL*
started
,
and
bade
her
hush
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
?
'
she
asked
,
gazing
nervously
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Joseph
is
here
,
'
I
answered
,
catching
opportunely
the
roll
of
his
*NL*
cartwheels
up
the
road
;
`
and
Heathcliff
will
come
in
with
him
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
sure
whether
he
were
not
at
the
door
this
moment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
he
could
n't
overhear
me
at
the
door
!
'
said
she
.
`
Give
me
Hareton
,
*NL*
while
you
get
the
supper
,
and
when
it
is
ready
ask
me
to
sup
with
you
.
I
*NL*
want
to
cheat
my
uncomfortable
conscience
,
and
be
convinced
that
*NL*
Heathcliff
has
no
notion
of
these
things
.
He
has
not
,
has
he
?
He
does
*NL*
not
know
what
being
in
love
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
no
reason
that
he
should
not
know
,
as
well
as
you
,
'
I
returned
;
*NL*
`
and
if
you
are
his
choice
,
he
'll
be
the
most
unfortunate
creature
that
*NL*
ever
was
born
!
As
soon
as
you
become
Mrs.
Linton
,
he
loses
friend
,
and
*NL*
love
,
and
all
!
Have
you
considered
how
you
'll
bear
the
separation
,
and
*NL*
how
he
'll
bear
to
be
quite
deserted
in
the
world
?
Because
,
Miss
*NL*
Catherine
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
quite
deserted
!
we
separated
!
'
she
exclaimed
,
with
an
accent
of
*NL*
indignation
.
`
Who
is
to
separate
us
,
pray
?
They
'll
meet
the
fate
of
*NL*
Milo
!
Not
as
long
as
I
live
,
Ellen
:
for
no
mortal
creature
.
Every
*NL*
Linton
on
the
face
of
the
earth
might
melt
into
nothing
before
I
could
*NL*
consent
to
forsake
Heathcliff
.
Oh
,
that
's
not
what
I
intend
--
that
's
not
*NL*
what
I
mean
!
I
should
n't
be
Mrs.
Linton
were
such
a
price
demanded
!
*NL*
He
'll
be
as
much
to
me
as
he
has
been
all
his
lifetime
.
Edgar
must
shake
*NL*
off
his
antipathy
,
and
tolerate
him
,
at
least
.
He
will
,
when
he
learns
*NL*
my
true
feelings
towards
him
.
Nelly
,
I
see
now
you
think
me
a
selfish
*NL*
wretch
;
but
did
it
never
strike
you
that
if
Heathcliff
and
I
married
,
we
*NL*
should
be
beggars
?
whereas
,
if
I
marry
Linton
I
can
aid
Heathcliff
to
*NL*
rise
,
and
place
him
out
of
my
brother
's
power
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
your
husband
's
money
,
Miss
Catherine
?
'
I
asked
.
`
You
'll
find
him
*NL*
not
so
pliable
as
you
calculate
upon
:
and
,
though
I
'm
hardly
a
judge
,
I
*NL*
think
that
's
the
worst
motive
you
've
given
yet
for
being
the
wife
of
*NL*
young
Linton
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
,
'
retorted
she
;
`
it
is
the
best
!
The
others
were
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
my
whims
:
and
for
Edgar
's
sake
,
too
,
to
satisfy
him
.
This
*NL*
is
for
the
sake
of
one
who
comprehends
in
his
person
my
feelings
to
Edgar
*NL*
and
myself
.
I
can
not
express
it
;
but
surely
you
and
everybody
have
a
*NL*
notion
that
there
is
or
should
be
an
existence
of
yours
beyond
you
.
What
*NL*
were
the
use
of
my
creation
,
if
I
were
entirely
contained
here
?
My
great
*NL*
miseries
in
this
world
have
been
Heathcliff
's
miseries
,
and
I
watched
and
*NL*
felt
each
from
the
beginning
:
my
great
thought
in
living
is
himself
.
If
*NL*
all
else
perished
,
and
_
he
_
remained
,
_
I
_
should
still
continue
to
be
;
*NL*
and
if
all
else
remained
,
and
he
were
annihilated
,
the
universe
would
*NL*
turn
to
a
mighty
stranger
:
I
should
not
seem
a
part
of
it
.
--
My
love
for
*NL*
Linton
is
like
the
foliage
in
the
woods
:
time
will
change
it
,
I
'm
well
*NL*
aware
,
as
winter
changes
the
trees
.
My
love
for
Heathcliff
resembles
the
*NL*
eternal
rocks
beneath
:
a
source
of
little
visible
delight
,
but
necessary
.
*NL*
Nelly
,
I
_
am
_
Heathcliff
!
He
's
always
,
always
in
my
mind
:
not
as
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
any
more
than
I
am
always
a
pleasure
to
myself
,
but
as
my
own
*NL*
being
.
So
do
n't
talk
of
our
separation
again
:
it
is
impracticable
;
and
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
hid
her
face
in
the
folds
of
my
gown
;
but
I
jerked
it
*NL*
forcibly
away
.
I
was
out
of
patience
with
her
folly
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
can
make
any
sense
of
your
nonsense
,
Miss
,
'
I
said
,
`
it
only
goes
*NL*
to
convince
me
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
duties
you
undertake
in
*NL*
marrying
;
or
else
that
you
are
a
wicked
,
unprincipled
girl
.
But
trouble
*NL*
me
with
no
more
secrets
:
I
'll
not
promise
to
keep
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
keep
that
?
'
she
asked
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
'll
not
promise
,
'
I
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
about
to
insist
,
when
the
entrance
of
Joseph
finished
our
*NL*
conversation
;
and
Catherine
removed
her
seat
to
a
corner
,
and
nursed
*NL*
Hareton
,
while
I
made
the
supper
.
After
it
was
cooked
,
my
fellow-servant
*NL*
and
I
began
to
quarrel
who
should
carry
some
to
Mr.
Hindley
;
and
we
*NL*
did
n't
settle
it
till
all
was
nearly
cold
.
Then
we
came
to
the
agreement
*NL*
that
we
would
let
him
ask
,
if
he
wanted
any
;
for
we
feared
particularly
*NL*
to
go
into
his
presence
when
he
had
been
some
time
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
how
is
n't
that
nowt
comed
in
fro
'
th
'
field
,
be
this
time
?
What
is
*NL*
he
about
?
girt
idle
seeght
!
'
demanded
the
old
man
,
looking
round
for
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
call
him
,
'
I
replied
.
`
He
's
in
the
barn
,
I
've
no
doubt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
and
called
,
but
got
no
answer
.
On
returning
,
I
whispered
to
*NL*
Catherine
that
he
had
heard
a
good
part
of
what
she
said
,
I
was
sure
;
and
*NL*
told
how
I
saw
him
quit
the
kitchen
just
as
she
complained
of
her
*NL*
brother
's
conduct
regarding
him
.
She
jumped
up
in
a
fine
fright
,
flung
*NL*
Hareton
on
to
the
settle
,
and
ran
to
seek
for
her
friend
herself
;
not
*NL*
taking
leisure
to
consider
why
she
was
so
flurried
,
or
how
her
talk
would
*NL*
have
affected
him
.
She
was
absent
such
a
while
that
Joseph
proposed
we
*NL*
should
wait
no
longer
.
He
cunningly
conjectured
they
were
staying
away
*NL*
in
order
to
avoid
hearing
his
protracted
blessing
.
They
were
`
ill
eneugh
*NL*
for
ony
fahl
manners
,
'
he
affirmed
.
And
on
their
behalf
he
added
that
*NL*
night
a
special
prayer
to
the
usual
quarter-of-an-hour
's
supplication
*NL*
before
meat
,
and
would
have
tacked
another
to
the
end
of
the
grace
,
had
*NL*
not
his
young
mistress
broken
in
upon
him
with
a
hurried
command
that
he
*NL*
must
run
down
the
road
,
and
,
wherever
Heathcliff
had
rambled
,
find
and
*NL*
make
him
re-enter
directly
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
to
speak
to
him
,
and
I
_
must
_
,
before
I
go
upstairs
,
'
she
said
.
*NL*
`
And
the
gate
is
open
:
he
is
somewhere
out
of
hearing
;
for
he
would
not
*NL*
reply
,
though
I
shouted
at
the
top
of
the
fold
as
loud
as
I
could
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
objected
at
first
;
she
was
too
much
in
earnest
,
however
,
to
suffer
*NL*
contradiction
;
and
at
last
he
placed
his
hat
on
his
head
,
and
walked
*NL*
grumbling
forth
.
Meantime
,
Catherine
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
,
*NL*
exclaiming
--
'
I
wonder
where
he
is
--
I
wonder
where
he
can
be
!
What
did
I
*NL*
say
,
Nelly
?
I
've
forgotten
.
Was
he
vexed
at
my
bad
humour
this
*NL*
afternoon
?
Dear
!
tell
me
what
I
've
said
to
grieve
him
?
I
do
wish
he
'd
*NL*
come
.
I
do
wish
he
would
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
noise
for
nothing
!
'
I
cried
,
though
rather
uneasy
myself
.
`
What
*NL*
a
trifle
scares
you
!
It
's
surely
no
great
cause
of
alarm
that
Heathcliff
*NL*
should
take
a
moonlight
saunter
on
the
moors
,
or
even
lie
too
sulky
to
*NL*
speak
to
us
in
the
hay-loft
.
I
'll
engage
he
's
lurking
there
.
See
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
ferret
him
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
departed
to
renew
my
search
;
its
result
was
disappointment
,
and
*NL*
Joseph
's
quest
ended
in
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yon
lad

war

'
observed
he
on
re-entering
.
`
He
's
left
th
'
*NL*
gate
at
t
'
full
swing
,
and
Miss

'
interrupted
Catherine
.
`

replied
.
`
It

'
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
a
very
dark
evening
for
summer
:
the
clouds
appeared
inclined
to
*NL*
thunder
,
and
I
said
we
had
better
all
sit
down
;
the
approaching
rain
*NL*
would
be
certain
to
bring
him
home
without
further
trouble
.
However
,
*NL*
Catherine
would
not
be
persuaded
into
tranquillity
.
She
kept
wandering
*NL*
to
and
fro
,
from
the
gate
to
the
door
,
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
*NL*
permitted
no
repose
;
and
at
length
took
up
a
permanent
situation
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
wall
,
near
the
road
:
where
,
heedless
of
my
expostulations
and
*NL*
the
growling
thunder
,
and
the
great
drops
that
began
to
plash
around
her
,
*NL*
she
remained
,
calling
at
intervals
,
and
then
listening
,
and
then
crying
*NL*
outright
.
She
beat
Hareton
,
or
any
child
,
at
a
good
passionate
fit
of
*NL*
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
midnight
,
while
we
still
sat
up
,
the
storm
came
rattling
over
the
*NL*
Heights
in
full
fury
.
There
was
a
violent
wind
,
as
well
as
thunder
,
and
*NL*
either
one
or
the
other
split
a
tree
off
at
the
corner
of
the
building
:
a
*NL*
huge
bough
fell
across
the
roof
,
and
knocked
down
a
portion
of
the
east
*NL*
chimney-stack
,
sending
a
clatter
of
stones
and
soot
into
the
*NL*
kitchen-fire
.
We
thought
a
bolt
had
fallen
in
the
middle
of
us
;
and
*NL*
Joseph
swung
on
to
his
knees
,
beseeching
the
Lord
to
remember
the
*NL*
patriarchs
Noah
and
Lot
,
and
,
as
in
former
times
,
spare
the
righteous
,
*NL*
though
he
smote
the
ungodly
.
I
felt
some
sentiment
that
it
must
be
a
*NL*
judgment
on
us
also
.
The
Jonah
,
in
my
mind
,
was
Mr.
Earnshaw
;
and
I
*NL*
shook
the
handle
of
his
den
that
I
might
ascertain
if
he
were
yet
living
.
*NL*
He
replied
audibly
enough
,
in
a
fashion
which
made
my
companion
*NL*
vociferate
,
more
clamorously
than
before
,
that
a
wide
distinction
might
*NL*
be
drawn
between
saints
like
himself
and
sinners
like
his
master
.
But
*NL*
the
uproar
passed
away
in
twenty
minutes
,
leaving
us
all
unharmed
;
*NL*
excepting
Cathy
,
who
got
thoroughly
drenched
for
her
obstinacy
in
*NL*
refusing
to
take
shelter
,
and
standing
bonnetless
and
shawlless
to
catch
*NL*
as
much
water
as
she
could
with
her
hair
and
clothes
.
She
came
in
and
*NL*
lay
down
on
the
settle
,
all
soaked
as
she
was
,
turning
her
face
to
the
*NL*
back
,
and
putting
her
hands
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Miss
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
touching
her
shoulder
;
`
you
are
not
bent
on
*NL*
getting
your
death
,
are
you
?
Do
you
know
what
o'clock
it
is
?
Half-past
*NL*
twelve
.
Come
,
come
to
bed
!
there
's
no
use
waiting
any
longer
on
that
*NL*
foolish
boy
:
he
'll
be
gone
to
Gimmerton
,
and
he
'll
stay
there
now
.
He
*NL*
guesses
we
should
n't
wait
for
him
till
this
late
hour
:
at
least
,
he
*NL*
guesses
that
only
Mr.
Hindley
would
be
up
;
and
he
'd
rather
avoid
having
*NL*
the
door
opened
by
the
master
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
nay
,
he
's
noan
at
Gimmerton
,
'
said
Joseph
.
`
I
's
niver
wonder
but
*NL*
he
's
at
t
'
bothom
of
a
bog-hoile
.
This
visitation
wor
n't
for
nowt
,
and
I
*NL*
wod
hev
'
ye
to
look
out
,
Miss
--

next
.
Thank
Hivin
for
all
!
*NL*
All
warks
togither
for
gooid
to
them
as
is
chozzen
,
and
piked
out
fro
'
*NL*
th
'
rubbidge
!
Yah
knaw
whet
t
'
Scripture
ses
.
'
And
he
began
quoting
*NL*
several
texts
,
referring
us
to
chapters
and
verses
where
we
might
find
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
having
vainly
begged
the
wilful
girl
to
rise
and
remove
her
wet
*NL*
things
,
left
him
preaching
and
her
shivering
,
and
betook
myself
to
bed
*NL*
with
little
Hareton
,
who
slept
as
fast
as
if
everyone
had
been
sleeping
*NL*
round
him
.
I
heard
Joseph
read
on
a
while
afterwards
;
then
I
*NL*
distinguished
his
slow
step
on
the
ladder
,
and
then
I
dropped
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
down
somewhat
later
than
usual
,
I
saw
,
by
the
sunbeams
piercing
*NL*
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
,
Miss
Catherine
still
seated
near
the
*NL*
fireplace
.
The
house-door
was
ajar
,
too
;
light
entered
from
its
unclosed
*NL*
windows
;
Hindley
had
come
out
,
and
stood
on
the
kitchen
hearth
,
haggard
*NL*
and
drowsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
ails
you
,
Cathy
?
'
he
was
saying
when
I
entered
:
`
you
look
as
dismal
*NL*
as
a
drowned
whelp
.
Why
are
you
so
damp
and
pale
,
child
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
been
wet
,
'
she
answered
reluctantly
,
`
and
I
'm
cold
,
that
's
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
she
is
naughty
!
'
I
cried
,
perceiving
the
master
to
be
tolerably
*NL*
sober
.
`
She
got
steeped
in
the
shower
of
yesterday
evening
,
and
there
*NL*
she
has
sat
the
night
through
,
and
I
could
n't
prevail
on
her
to
stir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Earnshaw
stared
at
us
in
surprise
.
`
The
night
through
,
'
he
repeated
.
*NL*
`
What
kept
her
up
?
not
fear
of
the
thunder
,
surely
?
That
was
over
hours
*NL*
since
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
of
us
wished
to
mention
Heathcliff
's
absence
,
as
long
as
we
could
*NL*
conceal
it
;
so
I
replied
,
I
did
n't
know
how
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
*NL*
sit
up
;
and
she
said
nothing
.
The
morning
was
fresh
and
cool
;
I
threw
*NL*
back
the
lattice
,
and
presently
the
room
filled
with
sweet
scents
from
*NL*
the
garden
;
but
Catherine
called
peevishly
to
me
,
`
Ellen
,
shut
the
*NL*
window
.
I
'm
starving
!
'
And
her
teeth
chattered
as
she
shrank
closer
to
*NL*
the
almost
extinguished
embers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
ill
,
'
said
Hindley
,
taking
her
wrist
;
'
I
suppose
that
's
the
reason
*NL*
she
would
not
go
to
bed
.
Damn
it
!
I
do
n't
want
to
be
troubled
with
more
*NL*
sickness
here
.
What
took
you
into
the
rain
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Running
after
t
'
lads
,
as
usuald
!
'
croaked
Joseph
,
catching
an
*NL*
opportunity
from
our
hesitation
to
thrust
in
his
evil
tongue
.
`
If
I
war
*NL*
yah
,
maister
,
I
'd
just
slam
t
'
boards
i
'
their
faces
all
on
'em
,
gentle
*NL*
and
simple
!
Never
a
day
ut
yah
're
off
,
but
yon
cat
o
'
Linton
comes
*NL*
sneaking
hither
;
and
Miss
Nelly
,
shoo
's
a
fine
lass
!
shoo
sits
watching
*NL*
for
ye
i
'
t
'
kitchen
;
and
as
yah
're
in
at
one
door
,
he
's
out
at
t
`
other
;
*NL*
and
,
then
,
wer
grand
lady
goes
a-courting
of
her
side
!
It
's
bonny
*NL*
behaviour
,
lurking
amang
t
'
fields
,
after
twelve
o
'
t
'
night
,
wi
'
that
*NL*
fahl
,
flaysome
divil
of
a
gipsy
,
Heathcliff
!
They
think
_
I
'm
_
blind
;
but
*NL*
I
'm
noan
:
nowt
ut

Linton

coming
and
going

*NL*
and

-LRB-
directing
his
discourse
to
me
-RRB-
,
`
yah
gooid

nip
up
and

clatter
up

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
,
eavesdropper
!
'
cried
Catherine
;
`
none
of
your
insolence
before
*NL*
me
!
Edgar
Linton
came
yesterday
by
chance
,
Hindley
;
and
it
was
_
I
_
who
*NL*
told
him
to
be
off
:
because
I
knew
you
would
not
like
to
have
met
him
as
*NL*
you
were
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
lie
,
Cathy
,
no
doubt
,
'
answered
her
brother
,
`
and
you
are
a
*NL*
confounded
simpleton
!
But
never
mind
Linton
at
present
:
tell
me
,
were
*NL*
you
not
with
Heathcliff
last
night
?
Speak
the
truth
,
now
.
You
need
not
*NL*
be
afraid
of
harming
him
:
though
I
hate
him
as
much
as
ever
,
he
did
me
a
*NL*
good
turn
a
short
time
since
that
will
make
my
conscience
tender
of
*NL*
breaking
his
neck
.
To
prevent
it
,
I
shall
send
him
about
his
business
*NL*
this
very
morning
;
and
after
he
's
gone
,
I
'd
advise
you
all
to
look
sharp
:
*NL*
I
shall
only
have
the
more
humour
for
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
saw
Heathcliff
last
night
,
'
answered
Catherine
,
beginning
to
sob
*NL*
bitterly
:
`
and
if
you
do
turn
him
out
of
doors
,
I
'll
go
with
him
.
But
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
you
'll
never
have
an
opportunity
:
perhaps
,
he
's
gone
.
'
Here
she
*NL*
burst
into
uncontrollable
grief
,
and
the
remainder
of
her
words
were
*NL*
inarticulate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hindley
lavished
on
her
a
torrent
of
scornful
abuse
,
and
bade
her
get
to
*NL*
her
room
immediately
,
or
she
should
n't
cry
for
nothing
!
I
obliged
her
to
*NL*
obey
;
and
I
shall
never
forget
what
a
scene
she
acted
when
we
reached
her
*NL*
chamber
:
it
terrified
me
.
I
thought
she
was
going
mad
,
and
I
begged
*NL*
Joseph
to
run
for
the
doctor
.
It
proved
the
commencement
of
delirium
:
*NL*
Mr.
Kenneth
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
,
pronounced
her
dangerously
ill
;
she
*NL*
had
a
fever
.
He
bled
her
,
and
he
told
me
to
let
her
live
on
whey
and
*NL*
water-gruel
,
and
take
care
she
did
not
throw
herself
downstairs
or
out
of
*NL*
the
window
;
and
then
he
left
:
for
he
had
enough
to
do
in
the
parish
,
*NL*
where
two
or
three
miles
was
the
ordinary
distance
between
cottage
and
*NL*
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
can
not
say
I
made
a
gentle
nurse
,
and
Joseph
and
the
master
were
*NL*
no
better
,
and
though
our
patient
was
as
wearisome
and
headstrong
as
a
*NL*
patient
could
be
,
she
weathered
it
through
.
Old
Mrs.
Linton
paid
us
*NL*
several
visits
,
to
be
sure
,
and
set
things
to
rights
,
and
scolded
and
*NL*
ordered
us
all
;
and
when
Catherine
was
convalescent
,
she
insisted
on
*NL*
conveying
her
to
Thrushcross
Grange
:
for
which
deliverance
we
were
very
*NL*
grateful
.
But
the
poor
dame
had
reason
to
repent
of
her
kindness
:
she
*NL*
and
her
husband
both
took
the
fever
,
and
died
within
a
few
days
of
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
young
lady
returned
to
us
saucier
and
more
passionate
,
and
haughtier
*NL*
than
ever
.
Heathcliff
had
never
been
heard
of
since
the
evening
of
the
*NL*
thunder-storm
;
and
,
one
day
,
I
had
the
misfortune
,
when
she
had
provoked
*NL*
me
exceedingly
,
to
lay
the
blame
of
his
disappearance
on
her
:
where
*NL*
indeed
it
belonged
,
as
she
well
knew
.
From
that
period
,
for
several
*NL*
months
,
she
ceased
to
hold
any
communication
with
me
,
save
in
the
*NL*
relation
of
a
mere
servant
.
Joseph
fell
under
a
ban
also
:
he
would
speak
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
lecture
her
all
the
same
as
if
she
were
a
little
girl
;
and
*NL*
she
esteemed
herself
a
woman
,
and
our
mistress
,
and
thought
that
her
*NL*
recent
illness
gave
her
a
claim
to
be
treated
with
consideration
.
Then
*NL*
the
doctor
had
said
that
she
would
not
bear
crossing
much
;
she
ought
to
*NL*
have
her
own
way
;
and
it
was
nothing
less
than
murder
in
her
eyes
for
any
*NL*
one
to
presume
to
stand
up
and
contradict
her
.
From
Mr.
Earnshaw
and
his
*NL*
companions
she
kept
aloof
;
and
tutored
by
Kenneth
,
and
serious
threats
of
*NL*
a
fit
that
often
attended
her
rages
,
her
brother
allowed
her
whatever
she
*NL*
pleased
to
demand
,
and
generally
avoided
aggravating
her
fiery
temper
.
He
*NL*
was
rather
too
indulgent
in
humouring
her
caprices
;
not
from
affection
,
*NL*
but
from
pride
:
he
wished
earnestly
to
see
her
bring
honour
to
the
family
*NL*
by
an
alliance
with
the
Lintons
,
and
as
long
as
she
let
him
alone
she
*NL*
might
trample
on
us
like
slaves
,
for
aught
he
cared
!
Edgar
Linton
,
as
*NL*
multitudes
have
been
before
and
will
be
after
him
,
was
infatuated
:
and
*NL*
believed
himself
the
happiest
man
alive
on
the
day
he
led
her
to
*NL*
Gimmerton
Chapel
,
three
years
subsequent
to
his
father
's
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
against
my
inclination
,
I
was
persuaded
to
leave
Wuthering
Heights
*NL*
and
accompany
her
here
.
Little
Hareton
was
nearly
five
years
old
,
and
I
*NL*
had
just
begun
to
teach
him
his
letters
.
We
made
a
sad
parting
;
but
*NL*
Catherine
's
tears
were
more
powerful
than
ours
.
When
I
refused
to
go
,
*NL*
and
when
she
found
her
entreaties
did
not
move
me
,
she
went
lamenting
to
*NL*
her
husband
and
brother
.
The
former
offered
me
munificent
wages
;
the
*NL*
latter
ordered
me
to
pack
up
:
he
wanted
no
women
in
the
house
,
he
said
,
*NL*
now
that
there
was
no
mistress
;
and
as
to
Hareton
,
the
curate
should
take
*NL*
him
in
hand
,
by-and-by
.
And
so
I
had
but
one
choice
left
:
to
do
as
I
was
*NL*
ordered
.
I
told
the
master
he
got
rid
of
all
decent
people
only
to
run
*NL*
to
ruin
a
little
faster
;
I
kissed
Hareton
,
said
good-by
;
and
since
then
*NL*
he
has
been
a
stranger
:
and
it
's
very
queer
to
think
it
,
but
I
've
no
*NL*
doubt
he
has
completely
forgotten
all
about
Ellen
Dean
,
and
that
he
was
*NL*
ever
more
than
all
the
world
to
her
and
she
to
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
of
the
housekeeper
's
story
she
chanced
to
glance
towards
*NL*
the
time-piece
over
the
chimney
;
and
was
in
amazement
on
seeing
the
*NL*
minute-hand
measure
half-past
one
.
She
would
not
hear
of
staying
a
*NL*
second
longer
:
in
truth
,
I
felt
rather
disposed
to
defer
the
sequel
of
*NL*
her
narrative
myself
.
And
now
that
she
is
vanished
to
her
rest
,
and
I
*NL*
have
meditated
for
another
hour
or
two
,
I
shall
summon
courage

of
aching

of

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
charming
introduction
to
a
hermit
's
life
!
Four
weeks
'
torture
,
*NL*
tossing
,
and
sickness
!
Oh
,
these
bleak
winds
and
bitter
northern
skies
,
*NL*
and
impassable
roads
,
and
dilatory
country
surgeons
!
And
oh
,
this
dearth
*NL*
of
the
human
physiognomy
!
and
,
worse
than
all
,
the
terrible
intimation
of
*NL*
Kenneth
that
I
need
not
expect
to
be
out
of
doors
till
spring
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
has
just
honoured
me
with
a
call
.
About
seven
days
ago
he
*NL*
sent
me
a
brace
of
grouse
--
the
last
of
the
season
.
Scoundrel
!
He
is
not
*NL*
altogether
guiltless
in
this
illness
of
mine
;
and
that
I
had
a
great
mind
*NL*
to
tell
him
.
But
,
alas
!
how
could
I
offend
a
man
who
was
charitable
*NL*
enough
to
sit
at
my
bedside
a
good
hour
,
and
talk
on
some
other
subject
*NL*
than
pills
and
draughts
,
blisters
and
leeches
?
This
is
quite
an
easy
*NL*
interval
.
I
am
too
weak
to
read
;
yet
I
feel
as
if
I
could
enjoy
*NL*
something
interesting
.
Why
not
have
up
Mrs.
Dean
to
finish
her
tale
?
I
*NL*
can
recollect
its
chief
incidents
,
as
far
as
she
had
gone
.
Yes
:
I
*NL*
remember
her
hero
had
run
off
,
and
never
been
heard
of
for
three
years
;
*NL*
and
the
heroine
was
married
.
I
'll
ring
:
she
'll
be
delighted
to
find
me
*NL*
capable
of
talking
cheerfully
.
Mrs.
Dean
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
wants
twenty
minutes
,
sir
,
to
taking
the
medicine
,
'
she
commenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Away
,
away
with
it
!
'
I
replied
;
'
I
desire
to
have
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
doctor
says
you
must
drop
the
powders
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
all
my
heart
!
Do
n't
interrupt
me
.
Come
and
take
your
seat
here
.
*NL*
Keep
your
fingers
from
that
bitter
phalanx
of
vials
.
Draw
your
knitting
*NL*
out
of
your
pocket
--
that
will
do
--
now
continue
the
history
of
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
from
where
you
left
off
,
to
the
present
day
.
Did
he
finish
*NL*
his
education
on
the
Continent
,
and
come
back
a
gentleman
?
or
did
he
get
*NL*
a
sizar
's
place
at
college
,
or
escape
to
America
,
and
earn
honours
by
*NL*
drawing
blood
from
his
foster-country
?
or
make
a
fortune
more
promptly
on
*NL*
the
English
highways
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
may
have
done
a
little
in
all
these
vocations
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
give
my
word
for
any
.
I
stated
before
that
I
did
n't
know
how
he
*NL*
gained
his
money
;
neither
am
I
aware
of
the
means
he
took
to
raise
his
*NL*
mind
from
the
savage
ignorance
into
which
it
was
sunk
:
but
,
with
your
*NL*
leave
,
I
'll
proceed
in
my
own
fashion
,
if
you
think
it
will
amuse
and
not
*NL*
weary
you
.
Are
you
feeling
better
this
morning
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
good
news
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
Miss
Catherine
and
myself
to
Thrushcross
Grange
;
and
,
to
my
*NL*
agreeable
disappointment
,
she
behaved
infinitely
better
than
I
dared
to
*NL*
expect
.
She
seemed
almost
over-fond
of
Mr.
Linton
;
and
even
to
his
*NL*
sister
she
showed
plenty
of
affection
.
They
were
both
very
attentive
to
*NL*
her
comfort
,
certainly
.
It
was
not
the
thorn
bending
to
the
*NL*
honeysuckles
,
but
the
honeysuckles
embracing
the
thorn
.
There
were
no
*NL*
mutual
concessions
:
one
stood
erect
,
and
the
others
yielded
:
and
who
can
*NL*
be
ill-natured
and
bad-tempered
when
they
encounter
neither
opposition
*NL*
nor
indifference
?
I
observed
that
Mr.
Edgar
had
a
deep-rooted
fear
of
*NL*
ruffling
her
humour
.
He
concealed
it
from
her
;
but
if
ever
he
heard
me
*NL*
answer
sharply
,
or
saw
any
other
servant
grow
cloudy
at
some
imperious
*NL*
order
of
hers
,
he
would
show
his
trouble
by
a
frown
of
displeasure
that
*NL*
never
darkened
on
his
own
account
.
He
many
a
time
spoke
sternly
to
me
*NL*
about
my
pertness
;
and
averred
that
the
stab
of
a
knife
could
not
inflict
*NL*
a
worse
pang
than
he
suffered
at
seeing
his
lady
vexed
.
Not
to
grieve
a
*NL*
kind
master
,
I
learned
to
be
less
touchy
;
and
,
for
the
space
of
half
a
*NL*
year
,
the
gunpowder
lay
as
harmless
as
sand
,
because
no
fire
came
near
to
*NL*
explode
it
.
Catherine
had
seasons
of
gloom
and
silence
now
and
then
:
*NL*
they
were
respected
with
sympathising
silence
by
her
husband
,
who
*NL*
ascribed
them
to
an
alteration
in
her
constitution
,
produced
by
her
*NL*
perilous
illness
;
as
she
was
never
subject
to
depression
of
spirits
*NL*
before
.
The
return
of
sunshine
was
welcomed
by
answering
sunshine
from
*NL*
him
.
I
believe
I
may
assert
that
they
were
really
in
possession
of
deep
*NL*
and
growing
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
ended
.
Well
,
we
_
must
_
be
for
ourselves
in
the
long
run
;
the
mild
and
*NL*
generous
are
only
more
justly
selfish
than
the
domineering
;
and
it
ended
*NL*
when
circumstances
caused
each
to
feel
that
the
one
's
interest
was
not
*NL*
the
chief
consideration
in
the
other
's
thoughts
.
On
a
mellow
evening
in
*NL*
September
,
I
was
coming
from
the
garden
with
a
heavy
basket
of
apples
*NL*
which
I
had
been
gathering
.
It
had
got
dusk
,
and
the
moon
looked
over
*NL*
the
high
wall
of
the
court
,
causing
undefined
shadows
to
lurk
in
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
numerous
projecting
portions
of
the
building
.
I
set
my
*NL*
burden
on
the
house-steps
by
the
kitchen-door
,
and
lingered
to
rest
,
and
*NL*
drew
in
a
few
more
breaths
of
the
soft
,
sweet
air
;
my
eyes
were
on
the
*NL*
moon
,
and
my
back
to
the
entrance
,
when
I
heard
a
voice
behind
me
*NL*
say
,
--
`
Nelly
,
is
that
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
deep
voice
,
and
foreign
in
tone
;
yet
there
was
something
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
pronouncing
my
name
which
made
it
sound
familiar
.
I
turned
*NL*
about
to
discover
who
spoke
,
fearfully
;
for
the
doors
were
shut
,
and
I
*NL*
had
seen
nobody
on
approaching
the
steps
.
Something
stirred
in
the
*NL*
porch
;
and
,
moving
nearer
,
I
distinguished
a
tall
man
dressed
in
dark
*NL*
clothes
,
with
dark
face
and
hair
.
He
leant
against
the
side
,
and
held
*NL*
his
fingers
on
the
latch
as
if
intending
to
open
for
himself
.
`
Who
can
*NL*
it
be
?
'
I
thought
.
`
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
Oh
,
no
!
The
voice
has
no
resemblance
*NL*
to
his
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
waited
here
an
hour
,
'
he
resumed
,
while
I
continued
staring
;
`
and
*NL*
the
whole
of
that
time
all
round
has
been
as
still
as
death
.
I
dared
not
*NL*
enter
.
You
do
not
know
me
?
Look
,
I
'm
not
a
stranger
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
ray
fell
on
his
features
;
the
cheeks
were
sallow
,
and
half
covered
with
*NL*
black
whiskers
;
the
brows
lowering
,
the
eyes
deep-set
and
singular
.
I
*NL*
remembered
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
'
I
cried
,
uncertain
whether
to
regard
him
as
a
worldly
visitor
,
*NL*
and
I
raised
my
hands
in
amazement
.
`
What
!
you
come
back
?
Is
it
really
*NL*
you
?
Is
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Heathcliff
,
'
he
replied
,
glancing
from
me
up
to
the
windows
,
which
*NL*
reflected
a
score
of
glittering
moons
,
but
showed
no
lights
from
within
.
*NL*
`
Are
they
at
home
?
where
is
she
?
Nelly
,
you
are
not
glad
!
you
need
n't
be
*NL*
so
disturbed
.
Is
she
here
?
Speak
!
I
want
to
have
one
word
with
*NL*
her
--
your
mistress
.
Go
,
and
say
some
person
from
Gimmerton
desires
to
*NL*
see
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
will
she
take
it
?
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
What
will
she
do
?
The
surprise
*NL*
bewilders
me
--
it
will
put
her
out
of
her
head
!
And
you
_
are
_
Heathcliff
!
*NL*
But
altered
!
Nay
,
there
's
no
comprehending
it
.
Have
you
been
for
a
*NL*
soldier
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
and
carry
my
message
,
'
he
interrupted
,
impatiently
.
`
I
'm
in
hell
*NL*
till
you
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
the
latch
,
and
I
entered
;
but
when
I
got
to
the
parlour
where
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Linton
were
,
I
could
not
persuade
myself
to
proceed
.
At
*NL*
length
I
resolved
on
making
an
excuse
to
ask
if
they
would
have
the
*NL*
candles
lighted
,
and
I
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
together
in
a
window
whose
lattice
lay
back
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
and
displayed
,
beyond
the
garden
trees
,
and
the
wild
green
park
,
the
*NL*
valley
of
Gimmerton
,
with
a
long
line
of
mist
winding
nearly
to
its
top
*NL*
-LRB-
for
very
soon
after
you
pass
the
chapel
,
as
you
may
have
noticed
,
the
*NL*
sough
that
runs
from
the
marshes
joins
a
beck
which
follows
the
bend
of
*NL*
the
glen
-RRB-
.
Wuthering
Heights
rose
above
this
silvery
vapour
;
but
our
old
*NL*
house
was
invisible
;
it
rather
dips
down
on
the
other
side
.
Both
the
*NL*
room
and
its
occupants
,
and
the
scene
they
gazed
on
,
looked
wondrously
*NL*
peaceful
.
I
shrank
reluctantly
from
performing
my
errand
;
and
was
*NL*
actually
going
away
leaving
it
unsaid
,
after
having
put
my
question
about
*NL*
the
candles
,
when
a
sense
of
my
folly
compelled
me
to
return
,
and
mutter
,
*NL*
'
A
person
from
Gimmerton
wishes
to
see
you
ma'am
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
does
he
want
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Linton
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
question
him
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
close
the
curtains
,
Nelly
,
'
she
said
;
`
and
bring
up
tea
.
I
'll
be
*NL*
back
again
directly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
quitted
the
apartment
;
Mr.
Edgar
inquired
,
carelessly
,
who
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Some
one
mistress
does
not
expect
,
'
I
replied
.
`
That
Heathcliff
--
you
*NL*
recollect
him
,
sir
--
who
used
to
live
at
Mr.
Earnshaw
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
the
gipsy
--
the
ploughboy
?
'
he
cried
.
`
Why
did
you
not
say
so
to
*NL*
Catherine
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
you
must
not
call
him
by
those
names
,
master
,
'
I
said
.
`
She
'd
be
*NL*
sadly
grieved
to
hear
you
.
She
was
nearly
heartbroken
when
he
ran
off
.
I
*NL*
guess
his
return
will
make
a
jubilee
to
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Linton
walked
to
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
that
*NL*
overlooked
the
court
.
He
unfastened
it
,
and
leant
out
.
I
suppose
they
*NL*
were
below
,
for
he
exclaimed
quickly
:
`
Do
n't
stand
there
,
love
!
Bring
*NL*
the
person
in
,
if
it
be
anyone
particular
.
'
Ere
long
,
I
heard
the
click
*NL*
of
the
latch
,
and
Catherine
flew
up-stairs
,
breathless
and
wild
;
too
*NL*
excited
to
show
gladness
:
indeed
,
by
her
face
,
you
would
rather
have
*NL*
surmised
an
awful
calamity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Edgar
,
Edgar
!
'
she
panted
,
flinging
her
arms
round
his
neck
.
`
Oh
,
*NL*
Edgar
darling
!
Heathcliff
's
come
back
--
he
is
!
'
And
she
tightened
her
*NL*
embrace
to
a
squeeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
cried
her
husband
,
crossly
,
`
do
n't
strangle
me
for
that
!
He
*NL*
never
struck
me
as
such
a
marvellous
treasure
.
There
is
no
need
to
be
*NL*
frantic
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
you
did
n't
like
him
,
'
she
answered
,
repressing
a
little
the
*NL*
intensity
of
her
delight
.
`
Yet
,
for
my
sake
,
you
must
be
friends
now
.
*NL*
Shall
I
tell
him
to
come
up
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
,
'
he
said
,
`
into
the
parlour
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
else
?
'
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
vexed
,
and
suggested
the
kitchen
as
a
more
suitable
place
for
*NL*
him
.
Mrs.
Linton
eyed
him
with
a
droll
expression
--
half
angry
,
half
*NL*
laughing
at
his
fastidiousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
she
added
,
after
a
while
;
'
I
can
not
sit
in
the
kitchen
.
Set
two
*NL*
tables
here
,
Ellen
:
one
for
your
master
and
Miss
Isabella
,
being
gentry
;
*NL*
the
other
for
Heathcliff
and
myself
,
being
of
the
lower
orders
.
Will
*NL*
that
please
you
,
dear
?
Or
must
I
have
a
fire
lighted
elsewhere
?
If
so
,
*NL*
give
directions
.
I
'll
run
down
and
secure
my
guest
.
I
'm
afraid
the
joy
*NL*
is
too
great
to
be
real
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
about
to
dart
off
again
;
but
Edgar
arrested
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
You
_
bid
him
step
up
,
'
he
said
,
addressing
me
;
`
and
,
Catherine
,
try
to
*NL*
be
glad
,
without
being
absurd
.
The
whole
household
need
not
witness
the
*NL*
sight
of
your
welcoming
a
runaway
servant
as
a
brother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
descended
,
and
found
Heathcliff
waiting
under
the
porch
,
evidently
*NL*
anticipating
an
invitation
to
enter
.
He
followed
my
guidance
without
*NL*
waste
of
words
,
and
I
ushered
him
into
the
presence
of
the
master
and
*NL*
mistress
,
whose
flushed
cheeks
betrayed
signs
of
warm
talking
.
But
the
*NL*
lady
's
glowed
with
another
feeling
when
her
friend
appeared
at
the
door
:
*NL*
she
sprang
forward
,
took
both
his
hands
,
and
led
him
to
Linton
;
and
then
*NL*
she
seized
Linton
's
reluctant
fingers
and
crushed
them
into
his
.
Now
,
*NL*
fully
revealed
by
the
fire
and
candlelight
,
I
was
amazed
,
more
than
ever
,
*NL*
to
behold
the
transformation
of
Heathcliff
.
He
had
grown
a
tall
,
*NL*
athletic
,
well-formed
man
;
beside
whom
my
master
seemed
quite
slender
and
*NL*
youth-like
.
His
upright
carriage
suggested
the
idea
of
his
having
been
*NL*
in
the
army
.
His
countenance
was
much
older
in
expression
and
decision
*NL*
of
feature
than
Mr.
Linton
's
;
it
looked
intelligent
,
and
retained
no
*NL*
marks
of
former
degradation
.
A
half-civilised
ferocity
lurked
yet
in
the
*NL*
depressed
brows
and
eyes
full
of
black
fire
,
but
it
was
subdued
;
and
his
*NL*
manner
was
even
dignified
:
quite
divested
of
roughness
,
though
stern
for
*NL*
grace
.
My
master
's
surprise
equalled
or
exceeded
mine
:
he
remained
for
a
*NL*
minute
at
a
loss
how
to
address
the
ploughboy
,
as
he
had
called
him
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
dropped
his
slight
hand
,
and
stood
looking
at
him
coolly
till
*NL*
he
chose
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sit
down
,
sir
,
'
he
said
,
at
length
.
`
Mrs.
Linton
,
recalling
old
times
,
*NL*
would
have
me
give
you
a
cordial
reception
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
am
*NL*
gratified
when
anything
occurs
to
please
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
also
,
'
answered
Heathcliff
,
`
especially
if
it
be
anything
in
which
*NL*
I
have
a
part
.
I
shall
stay
an
hour
or
two
willingly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
seat
opposite
Catherine
,
who
kept
her
gaze
fixed
on
him
as
if
*NL*
she
feared
he
would
vanish
were
she
to
remove
it
.
He
did
not
raise
his
*NL*
to
her
often
:
a
quick
glance
now
and
then
sufficed
;
but
it
flashed
back
,
*NL*
each
time
more
confidently
,
the
undisguised
delight
he
drank
from
hers
.
*NL*
They
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
mutual
joy
to
suffer
embarrassment
.
*NL*
Not
so
Mr.
Edgar
:
he
grew
pale
with
pure
annoyance
:
a
feeling
that
*NL*
reached
its
climax
when
his
lady
rose
,
and
stepping
across
the
rug
,
*NL*
seized
Heathcliff
's
hands
again
,
and
laughed
like
one
beside
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
think
it
a
dream
to-morrow
!
'
she
cried
.
'
I
shall
not
be
able
to
*NL*
believe
that
I
have
seen
,
and
touched
,
and
spoken
to
you
once
more
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
cruel
Heathcliff
!
you
do
n't
deserve
this
welcome
.
To
be
absent
and
*NL*
silent
for
three
years
,
and
never
to
think
of
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
little
more
than
you
have
thought
of
me
,
'
he
murmured
.
'
I
heard
of
*NL*
your
marriage
,
Cathy
,
not
long
since
;
and
,
while
waiting
in
the
yard
*NL*
below
,
I
meditated
this
plan
--
just
to
have
one
glimpse
of
your
face
,
a
*NL*
stare
of
surprise
,
perhaps
,
and
pretended
pleasure
;
afterwards
settle
my
*NL*
score
with
Hindley
;
and
then
prevent
the
law
by
doing
execution
on
*NL*
myself
.
Your
welcome
has
put
these
ideas
out
of
my
mind
;
but
beware
of
*NL*
meeting
me
with
another
aspect
next
time
!
Nay
,
you
'll
not
drive
me
off
*NL*
again
.
You
were
really
sorry
for
me
,
were
you
?
Well
,
there
was
cause
.
*NL*
I
've
fought
through
a
bitter
life
since
I
last
heard
your
voice
;
and
you
*NL*
must
forgive
me
,
for
I
struggled
only
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
,
unless
we
are
to
have
cold
tea
,
please
to
come
to
the
table
,
'
*NL*
interrupted
Linton
,
striving
to
preserve
his
ordinary
tone
,
and
a
due
*NL*
measure
of
politeness
.
`
Mr.
Heathcliff
will
have
a
long
walk
,
wherever
*NL*
he
may
lodge
to-night
;
and
I
'm
thirsty
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
post
before
the
urn
;
and
Miss
Isabella
came
,
summoned
by
the
*NL*
bell
;
then
,
having
handed
their
chairs
forward
,
I
left
the
room
.
The
*NL*
meal
hardly
endured
ten
minutes
.
Catherine
's
cup
was
never
filled
:
she
*NL*
could
neither
eat
nor
drink
.
Edgar
had
made
a
slop
in
his
saucer
,
and
*NL*
scarcely
swallowed
a
mouthful
.
Their
guest
did
not
protract
his
stay
*NL*
that
evening
above
an
hour
longer
.
I
asked
,
as
he
departed
,
if
he
went
*NL*
to
Gimmerton
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
'
he
answered
:
`
Mr.
Earnshaw
invited
me
,
when
I
*NL*
called
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Earnshaw
invited
_
him
_
!
and
_
he
_
called
on
Mr.
Earnshaw
!
I
pondered
*NL*
this
sentence
painfully
,
after
he
was
gone
.
Is
he
turning
out
a
bit
of
a
*NL*
hypocrite
,
and
coming
into
the
country
to
work
mischief
under
a
cloak
?
I
*NL*
mused
:
I
had
a
presentiment
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
he
had
better
*NL*
have
remained
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
was
wakened
from
my
first
nap
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
gliding
into
my
chamber
,
taking
a
seat
on
my
bedside
,
and
pulling
*NL*
me
by
the
hair
to
rouse
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
rest
,
Ellen
,
'
she
said
,
by
way
of
apology
.
`
And
I
want
some
*NL*
living
creature
to
keep
me
company
in
my
happiness
!
Edgar
is
sulky
,
*NL*
because
I
'm
glad
of
a
thing
that
does
not
interest
him
:
he
refuses
to
*NL*
open
his
mouth
,
except
to
utter
pettish
,
silly
speeches
;
and
he
affirmed
*NL*
I
was
cruel
and
selfish
for
wishing
to
talk
when
he
was
so
sick
and
*NL*
sleepy
.
He
always
contrives
to
be
sick
at
the
least
cross
!
I
gave
a
few
*NL*
sentences
of
commendation
to
Heathcliff
,
and
he
,
either
for
a
headache
or
*NL*
a
pang
of
envy
,
began
to
cry
:
so
I
got
up
and
left
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
use
is
it
praising
Heathcliff
to
him
?
'
I
answered
.
`
As
lads
they
*NL*
had
an
aversion
to
each
other
,
and
Heathcliff
would
hate
just
as
much
to
*NL*
hear
him
praised
:
it
's
human
nature
.
Let
Mr.
Linton
alone
about
him
,
*NL*
unless
you
would
like
an
open
quarrel
between
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
does
it
not
show
great
weakness
?
'
pursued
she
.
`
I
'm
not
envious
:
I
*NL*
never
feel
hurt
at
the
brightness
of
Isabella
's
yellow
hair
and
the
*NL*
whiteness
of
her
skin
,
at
her
dainty
elegance
,
and
the
fondness
all
the
*NL*
family
exhibit
for
her
.
Even
you
,
Nelly
,
if
we
have
a
dispute
sometimes
,
*NL*
you
back
Isabella
at
once
;
and
I
yield
like
a
foolish
mother
:
I
call
her
*NL*
a
darling
,
and
flatter
her
into
a
good
temper
.
It
pleases
her
brother
to
*NL*
see
us
cordial
,
and
that
pleases
me
.
But
they
are
very
much
alike
:
they
*NL*
are
spoiled
children
,
and
fancy
the
world
was
made
for
their
*NL*
accommodation
;
and
though
I
humour
both
,
I
think
a
smart
chastisement
*NL*
might
improve
them
all
the
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
mistaken
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
'
said
I.
`
They
humour
you
:
I
know
what
*NL*
there
would
be
to
do
if
they
did
not
.
You
can
well
afford
to
indulge
*NL*
their
passing
whims
as
long
as
their
business
is
to
anticipate
all
your
*NL*
desires
.
You
may
,
however
,
fall
out
,
at
last
,
over
something
of
equal
*NL*
consequence
to
both
sides
;
and
then
those
you
term
weak
are
very
capable
*NL*
of
being
as
obstinate
as
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
then
we
shall
fight
to
the
death
,
sha
'n'
t
we
,
Nelly
?
'
she
returned
,
*NL*
laughing
.
`
No
!
I
tell
you
,
I
have
such
faith
in
Linton
's
love
,
that
I
*NL*
believe
I
might
kill
him
,
and
he
would
n't
wish
to
retaliate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
advised
her
to
value
him
the
more
for
his
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
,
'
she
answered
,
`
but
he
need
n't
resort
to
whining
for
trifles
.
It
*NL*
is
childish
and
,
instead
of
melting
into
tears
because
I
said
that
*NL*
Heathcliff
was
now
worthy
of
anyone
's
regard
,
and
it
would
honour
the
*NL*
first
gentleman
in
the
country
to
be
his
friend
,
he
ought
to
have
said
it
*NL*
for
me
,
and
been
delighted
from
sympathy
.
He
must
get
accustomed
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
may
as
well
like
him
:
considering
how
Heathcliff
has
reason
to
*NL*
object
to
him
,
I
'm
sure
he
behaved
excellently
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
think
of
his
going
to
Wuthering
Heights
?
'
I
inquired
.
`
He
*NL*
is
reformed
in
every
respect
,
apparently
:
quite
a
Christian
:
offering
the
*NL*
right
hand
of
fellowship
to
his
enemies
all
around
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
explained
it
,
'
she
replied
.
'
I
wonder
as
much
as
you
.
He
said
he
*NL*
called
to
gather
information
concerning
me
from
you
,
supposing
you
*NL*
resided
there
still
;
and
Joseph
told
Hindley
,
who
came
out
and
fell
to
*NL*
questioning
him
of
what
he
had
been
doing
,
and
how
he
had
been
living
;
*NL*
and
finally
,
desired
him
to
walk
in
.
There
were
some
persons
sitting
at
*NL*
cards
;
Heathcliff
joined
them
;
my
brother
lost
some
money
to
him
,
and
,
*NL*
finding
him
plentifully
supplied
,
he
requested
that
he
would
come
again
*NL*
in
the
evening
:
to
which
he
consented
.
Hindley
is
too
reckless
to
select
*NL*
his
acquaintance
prudently
:
he
does
n't
trouble
himself
to
reflect
on
the
*NL*
causes
he
might
have
for
mistrusting
one
whom
he
has
basely
injured
.
But
*NL*
Heathcliff
affirms
his
principal
reason
for
resuming
a
connection
with
*NL*
his
ancient
persecutor
is
a
wish
to
install
himself
in
quarters
at
walking
*NL*
distance
from
the
Grange
,
and
an
attachment
to
the
house
where
we
lived
*NL*
together
;
and
likewise
a
hope
that
I
shall
have
more
opportunities
of
*NL*
seeing
him
there
than
I
could
have
if
he
settled
in
Gimmerton
.
He
means
*NL*
to
offer
liberal
payment
for
permission
to
lodge
at
the
Heights
;
and
*NL*
doubtless
my
brother
's
covetousness
will
prompt
him
to
accept
the
terms
:
*NL*
he
was
always
greedy
;
though
what
he
grasps
with
one
hand
he
flings
away
*NL*
with
the
other
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
nice
place
for
a
young
man
to
fix
his
dwelling
in
!
'
said
I.
`
Have
*NL*
you
no
fear
of
the
consequences
,
Mrs.
Linton
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
for
my
friend
,
'
she
replied
:
`
his
strong
head
will
keep
him
from
*NL*
danger
;
a
little
for
Hindley
:
but
he
ca
n't
be
made
morally
worse
than
he
*NL*
is
;
and
I
stand
between
him
and
bodily
harm
.
The
event
of
this
evening
*NL*
has
reconciled
me
to
God
and
humanity
!
I
had
risen
in
angry
rebellion
*NL*
against
Providence
.
Oh
,
I
've
endured
very
,
very
bitter
misery
,
Nelly
!
If
*NL*
that
creature
knew
how
bitter
,
he
'd
be
ashamed
to
cloud
its
removal
with
*NL*
idle
petulance
.
It
was
kindness
for
him
which
induced
me
to
bear
it
*NL*
alone
:
had
I
expressed
the
agony
I
frequently
felt
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
taught
to
long
for
its
alleviation
as
ardently
as
I.
However
,
it
's
over
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
take
no
revenge
on
his
folly
;
I
can
afford
to
suffer
anything
*NL*
hereafter
!
Should
the
meanest
thing
alive
slap
me
on
the
cheek
,
I
'd
not
*NL*
only
turn
the
other
,
but
I
'd
ask
pardon
for
provoking
it
;
and
,
as
a
*NL*
proof
,
I
'll
go
make
my
peace
with
Edgar
instantly
.
Good-night
!
I
'm
an
*NL*
angel
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
self-complacent
conviction
she
departed
;
and
the
success
of
her
*NL*
fulfilled
resolution
was
obvious
on
the
morrow
:
Mr.
Linton
had
not
only
*NL*
abjured
his
peevishness
-LRB-
though
his
spirits
seemed
still
subdued
by
*NL*
Catherine
's
exuberance
of
vivacity
-RRB-
,
but
he
ventured
no
objection
to
her
*NL*
taking
Isabella
with
her
to
Wuthering
Heights
in
the
afternoon
;
and
she
*NL*
rewarded
him
with
such
a
summer
of
sweetness
and
affection
in
return
as
*NL*
made
the
house
a
paradise
for
several
days
;
both
master
and
servants
*NL*
profiting
from
the
perpetual
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
--
Mr.
Heathcliff
I
should
say
in
future
--
used
the
liberty
of
*NL*
visiting
at
Thrushcross
Grange
cautiously
,
at
first
:
he
seemed
estimating
*NL*
how
far
its
owner
would
bear
his
intrusion
.
Catherine
,
also
,
deemed
it
*NL*
judicious
to
moderate
her
expressions
of
pleasure
in
receiving
him
;
and
*NL*
he
gradually
established
his
right
to
be
expected
.
He
retained
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
the
reserve
for
which
his
boyhood
was
remarkable
;
and
that
served
*NL*
to
repress
all
startling
demonstrations
of
feeling
.
My
master
's
*NL*
uneasiness
experienced
a
lull
,
and
further
circumstances
diverted
it
into
*NL*
another
channel
for
a
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
new
source
of
trouble
sprang
from
the
not
anticipated
misfortune
of
*NL*
Isabella
Linton
evincing
a
sudden
and
irresistible
attraction
towards
the
*NL*
tolerated
guest
.
She
was
at
that
time
a
charming
young
lady
of
eighteen
;
*NL*
infantile
in
manners
,
though
possessed
of
keen
wit
,
keen
feelings
,
and
a
*NL*
keen
temper
,
too
,
if
irritated
.
Her
brother
,
who
loved
her
tenderly
,
was
*NL*
appalled
at
this
fantastic
preference
.
Leaving
aside
the
degradation
of
*NL*
an
alliance
with
a
nameless
man
,
and
the
possible
fact
that
his
property
,
*NL*
in
default
of
heirs
male
,
might
pass
into
such
a
one
's
power
,
he
had
*NL*
sense
to
comprehend
Heathcliff
's
disposition
:
to
know
that
,
though
his
*NL*
exterior
was
altered
,
his
mind
was
unchangeable
and
unchanged
.
And
he
*NL*
dreaded
that
mind
:
it
revolted
him
:
he
shrank
forebodingly
from
the
idea
*NL*
of
committing
Isabella
to
its
keeping
.
He
would
have
recoiled
still
more
*NL*
had
he
been
aware
that
her
attachment
rose
unsolicited
,
and
was
bestowed
*NL*
where
it
awakened
no
reciprocation
of
sentiment
;
for
the
minute
he
*NL*
discovered
its
existence
he
laid
the
blame
on
Heathcliff
's
deliberate
*NL*
designing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
all
remarked
,
during
some
time
,
that
Miss
Linton
fretted
and
pined
*NL*
over
something
.
She
grew
cross
and
wearisome
;
snapping
at
and
teasing
*NL*
Catherine
continually
,
at
the
imminent
risk
of
exhausting
her
limited
*NL*
patience
.
We
excused
her
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
on
the
plea
of
*NL*
ill-health
:
she
was
dwindling
and
fading
before
our
eyes
.
But
one
day
,
*NL*
when
she
had
been
peculiarly
wayward
,
rejecting
her
breakfast
,
*NL*
complaining
that
the
servants
did
not
do
what
she
told
them
;
that
the
*NL*
mistress
would
allow
her
to
be
nothing
in
the
house
,
and
Edgar
neglected
*NL*
her
;
that
she
had
caught
a
cold
with
the
doors
being
left
open
,
and
we
*NL*
let
the
parlour
fire
go
out
on
purpose
to
vex
her
,
with
a
hundred
yet
*NL*
more
frivolous
accusations
,
Mrs.
Linton
peremptorily
insisted
that
she
*NL*
should
get
to
bed
;
and
,
having
scolded
her
heartily
,
threatened
to
send
*NL*
for
the
doctor
.
Mention
of
Kenneth
caused
her
to
exclaim
,
instantly
,
*NL*
that
her
health
was
perfect
,
and
it
was
only
Catherine
's
harshness
which
*NL*
made
her
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
can
you
say
I
am
harsh
,
you
naughty
fondling
?
'
cried
the
mistress
,
*NL*
amazed
at
the
unreasonable
assertion
.
`
You
are
surely
losing
your
*NL*
reason
.
When
have
I
been
harsh
,
tell
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yesterday
,
'
sobbed
Isabella
,
`
and
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yesterday
!
'
said
her
sister-in-law
.
`
On
what
occasion
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
our
walk
along
the
moor
:
you
told
me
to
ramble
where
I
pleased
,
while
*NL*
you
sauntered
on
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
that
's
your
notion
of
harshness
?
'
said
Catherine
,
laughing
.
`
It
was
*NL*
no
hint
that
your
company
was
superfluous
?
We
did
n't
care
whether
you
*NL*
kept
with
us
or
not
;
I
merely
thought
Heathcliff
's
talk
would
have
*NL*
nothing
entertaining
for
your
ears
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
no
,
'
wept
the
young
lady
;
`
you
wished
me
away
,
because
you
knew
I
*NL*
liked
to
be
there
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
she
sane
?
'
asked
Mrs.
Linton
,
appealing
to
me
.
`
I
'll
repeat
our
*NL*
conversation
,
word
for
word
,
Isabella
;
and
you
point
out
any
charm
it
*NL*
could
have
had
for
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
mind
the
conversation
,
'
she
answered
:
'
I
wanted
to
be
with
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
?
'
said
Catherine
,
perceiving
her
hesitate
to
complete
the
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
him
:
and
I
wo
n't
be
always
sent
off
!
'
she
continued
,
kindling
up
.
*NL*
`
You
are
a
dog
in
the
manger
,
Cathy
,
and
desire
no
one
to
be
loved
but
*NL*
yourself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
an
impertinent
little
monkey
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
in
*NL*
surprise
.
`
But
I
'll
not
believe
this
idiotcy
!
It
is
impossible
that
you
*NL*
can
covet
the
admiration
of
Heathcliff
--
that
you
consider
him
an
*NL*
agreeable
person
!
I
hope
I
have
misunderstood
you
,
Isabella
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
you
have
not
,
'
said
the
infatuated
girl
.
'
I
love
him
more
than
ever
*NL*
you
loved
Edgar
,
and
he
might
love
me
,
if
you
would
let
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
n't
be
you
for
a
kingdom
,
then
!
'
Catherine
declared
,
*NL*
emphatically
:
and
she
seemed
to
speak
sincerely
.
`
Nelly
,
help
me
to
*NL*
convince
her
of
her
madness
.
Tell
her
what
Heathcliff
is
:
an
unreclaimed
*NL*
creature
,
without
refinement
,
without
cultivation
;
an
arid
wilderness
of
*NL*
furze
and
whinstone
.
I
'd
as
soon
put
that
little
canary
into
the
park
on
*NL*
a
winter
's
day
,
as
recommend
you
to
bestow
your
heart
on
him
!
It
is
*NL*
deplorable
ignorance
of
his
character
,
child
,
and
nothing
else
,
which
*NL*
makes
that
dream
enter
your
head
.
Pray
,
do
n't
imagine
that
he
conceals
*NL*
depths
of
benevolence
and
affection
beneath
a
stern
exterior
!
He
's
not
a
*NL*
rough
diamond
--
a
pearl-containing
oyster
of
a
rustic
:
he
's
a
fierce
,
*NL*
pitiless
,
wolfish
man
.
I
never
say
to
him
,
``
Let
this
or
that
enemy
*NL*
alone
,
because
it
would
be
ungenerous
or
cruel
to
harm
them
;
''
I
say
,
``
Let
*NL*
them
alone
,
because
_
I
_
should
hate
them
to
be
wronged
:
''
and
he
'd
crush
*NL*
you
like
a
sparrow
's
egg
,
Isabella
,
if
he
found
you
a
troublesome
charge
.
*NL*
I
know
he
could
n't
love
a
Linton
;
and
yet
he
'd
be
quite
capable
of
*NL*
marrying
your
fortune
and
expectations
:
avarice
is
growing
with
him
a
*NL*
besetting
sin
.
There
's
my
picture
:
and
I
'm
his
friend
--
so
much
so
,
that
*NL*
had
he
thought
seriously
to
catch
you
,
I
should
,
perhaps
,
have
held
my
*NL*
tongue
,
and
let
you
fall
into
his
trap
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Linton
regarded
her
sister-in-law
with
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
shame
!
for
shame
!
'
she
repeated
,
angrily
.
`
You
are
worse
than
*NL*
twenty
foes
,
you
poisonous
friend
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
you
wo
n't
believe
me
,
then
?
'
said
Catherine
.
`
You
think
I
speak
*NL*
from
wicked
selfishness
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
certain
you
do
,
'
retorted
Isabella
;
`
and
I
shudder
at
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
!
'
cried
the
other
.
`
Try
for
yourself
,
if
that
be
your
spirit
:
I
*NL*
have
done
,
and
yield
the
argument
to
your
saucy
insolence
.
'
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
must
suffer
for
her
egotism
!
'
she
sobbed
,
as
Mrs.
Linton
left
the
*NL*
room
.
`
All
,
all
is
against
me
:
she
has
blighted
my
single
consolation
.
*NL*
But
she
uttered
falsehoods
,
did
n't
she
?
Mr.
Heathcliff
is
not
a
fiend
:
*NL*
he
has
an
honourable
soul
,
and
a
true
one
,
or
how
could
he
remember
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Banish
him
from
your
thoughts
,
Miss
,
'
I
said
.
`
He
's
a
bird
of
bad
omen
:
*NL*
no
mate
for
you
.
Mrs.
Linton
spoke
strongly
,
and
yet
I
ca
n't
contradict
*NL*
her
.
She
is
better
acquainted
with
his
heart
than
I
,
or
any
one
besides
;
*NL*
and
she
never
would
represent
him
as
worse
than
he
is
.
Honest
people
*NL*
do
n't
hide
their
deeds
.
How
has
he
been
living
?
how
has
he
got
rich
?
why
*NL*
is
he
staying
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
the
house
of
a
man
whom
he
abhors
?
*NL*
They
say
Mr.
Earnshaw
is
worse
and
worse
since
he
came
.
They
sit
up
all
*NL*
night
together
continually
,
and
Hindley
has
been
borrowing
money
on
his
*NL*
land
,
and
does
nothing
but
play
and
drink
:
I
heard
only
a
week
ago
--
it
*NL*
was
Joseph
who
told
me
--
I
met
him
at
Gimmerton
:
``

Now
,
Miss
Linton
,
Joseph
is
an
*NL*
old
rascal
,
but
no
liar
;
and
,
if
his
account
of
Heathcliff
's
conduct
be
*NL*
true
,
you
would
never
think
of
desiring
such
a
husband
,
would
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
leagued
with
the
rest
,
Ellen
!
'
she
replied
.
`
I
'll
not
listen
to
*NL*
your
slanders
.
What
malevolence
you
must
have
to
wish
to
convince
me
*NL*
that
there
is
no
happiness
in
the
world
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
would
have
got
over
this
fancy
if
left
to
herself
,
or
*NL*
persevered
in
nursing
it
perpetually
,
I
can
not
say
:
she
had
little
time
*NL*
to
reflect
.
The
day
after
,
there
was
a
justice-meeting
at
the
next
town
;
*NL*
my
master
was
obliged
to
attend
;
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
aware
of
his
*NL*
absence
,
called
rather
earlier
than
usual
.
Catherine
and
Isabella
were
*NL*
sitting
in
the
library
,
on
hostile
terms
,
but
silent
:
the
latter
alarmed
*NL*
at
her
recent
indiscretion
,
and
the
disclosure
she
had
made
of
her
secret
*NL*
feelings
in
a
transient
fit
of
passion
;
the
former
,
on
mature
*NL*
consideration
,
really
offended
with
her
companion
;
and
,
if
she
laughed
*NL*
again
at
her
pertness
,
inclined
to
make
it
no
laughing
matter
to
her
.
She
*NL*
did
laugh
as
she
saw
Heathcliff
pass
the
window
.
I
was
sweeping
the
*NL*
hearth
,
and
I
noticed
a
mischievous
smile
on
her
lips
.
Isabella
,
*NL*
absorbed
in
her
meditations
,
or
a
book
,
remained
till
the
door
opened
;
*NL*
and
it
was
too
late
to
attempt
an
escape
,
which
she
would
gladly
have
*NL*
done
had
it
been
practicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
in
,
that
's
right
!
'
exclaimed
the
mistress
,
gaily
,
pulling
a
chair
*NL*
to
the
fire
.
`
Here
are
two
people
sadly
in
need
of
a
third
to
thaw
the
*NL*
ice
between
them
;
and
you
are
the
very
one
we
should
both
of
us
choose
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
I
'm
proud
to
show
you
,
at
last
,
somebody
that
dotes
on
you
*NL*
more
than
myself
.
I
expect
you
to
feel
flattered
.
Nay
,
it
's
not
Nelly
;
*NL*
do
n't
look
at
her
!
My
poor
little
sister-in-law
is
breaking
her
heart
by
*NL*
mere
contemplation
of
your
physical
and
moral
beauty
.
It
lies
in
your
*NL*
own
power
to
be
Edgar
's
brother
!
No
,
no
,
Isabella
,
you
sha
'n'

run
off

'
*NL*
she
continued
,
arresting
,
with
feigned
playfulness
,
the
confounded
girl
,
*NL*
who
had
risen
indignantly
.
`
We
were
quarrelling
like
cats
about
you
,
*NL*
Heathcliff
;
and
I
was
fairly
beaten
in
protestations
of
devotion
and
*NL*
admiration
:
and
,
moreover
,
I
was
informed
that
if
I
would
but
have
the
*NL*
manners
to
stand
aside
,
my
rival
,
as
she
will
have
herself
to
be
,
would
*NL*
shoot
a
shaft
into
your
soul
that
would
fix
you
for
ever
,
and
send
my
*NL*
image
into
eternal
oblivion
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
!
'
said
Isabella
,
calling
up
her
dignity
,
and
disdaining
to
*NL*
struggle
from
the
tight
grasp
that
held
her
,
`
I
'd
thank
you
to
adhere
to
*NL*
the
truth
and
not
slander
me
,
even
in
joke
!
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
be
kind
*NL*
enough
to
bid
this
friend
of
yours
release
me
:
she
forgets
that
you
and
I
*NL*
are
not
intimate
acquaintances
;
and
what
amuses
her
is
painful
to
me
*NL*
beyond
expression
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
guest
answered
nothing
,
but
took
his
seat
,
and
looked
thoroughly
*NL*
indifferent
what
sentiments
she
cherished
concerning
him
,
she
turned
and
*NL*
whispered
an
earnest
appeal
for
liberty
to
her
tormentor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
no
means
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Linton
in
answer
.
'
I
wo
n't
be
named
a
dog
in
*NL*
the
manger
again
.
You
_
shall
_
stay
:
now
then
!
Heathcliff
,
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
evince
satisfaction
at
my
pleasant
news
?
Isabella
swears
that
the
love
*NL*
Edgar
has
for
me
is
nothing
to
that
she
entertains
for
you
.
I
'm
sure
she
*NL*
made
some
speech
of
the
kind
;
did
she
not
,
Ellen
?
And
she
has
fasted
*NL*
ever
since
the
day
before
yesterday
's
walk
,
from
sorrow
and
rage
that
I
*NL*
despatched
her
out
of
your
society
under
the
idea
of
its
being
*NL*
unacceptable
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
you
belie
her
,
'
said
Heathcliff
,
twisting
his
chair
to
face
*NL*
them
.
`
She
wishes
to
be
out
of
my
society
now
,
at
any
rate
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
stared
hard
at
the
object
of
discourse
,
as
one
might
do
at
a
*NL*
strange
repulsive
animal
:
a
centipede
from
the
Indies
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
which
curiosity
leads
one
to
examine
in
spite
of
the
aversion
it
raises
.
*NL*
The
poor
thing
could
n't
bear
that
;
she
grew
white
and
red
in
rapid
*NL*
succession
,
and
,
while
tears
beaded
her
lashes
,
bent
the
strength
of
her
*NL*
small
fingers
to
loosen
the
firm
clutch
of
Catherine
;
and
perceiving
that
*NL*
as
fast
as
she
raised
one
finger
off
her
arm
another
closed
down
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
remove
the
whole
together
,
she
began
to
make
use
of
her
nails
;
*NL*
and
their
sharpness
presently
ornamented
the
detainer
's
with
crescents
of
*NL*
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
a
tigress
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
setting
her
free
,
and
shaking
*NL*
her
hand
with
pain
.
`
Begone
,
for
God
's
sake
,
and
hide
your
vixen
face
!
*NL*
How
foolish
to
reveal
those
talons
to
him
.
Ca
n't
you
fancy
the
*NL*
conclusions
he
'll
draw
?
Look
,
Heathcliff
!
they
are
instruments
that
will
*NL*
do
execution
--
you
must
beware
of
your
eyes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
wrench
them
off
her
fingers
,
if
they
ever
menaced
me
,
'
he
answered
,
*NL*
brutally
,
when
the
door
had
closed
after
her
.
`
But
what
did
you
mean
by
*NL*
teasing
the
creature
in
that
manner
,
Cathy
?
You
were
not
speaking
the
*NL*
truth
,
were
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
assure
you
I
was
,
'
she
returned
.
`
She
has
been
dying
for
your
sake
*NL*
several
weeks
,
and
raving
about
you
this
morning
,
and
pouring
forth
a
*NL*
deluge
of
abuse
,
because
I
represented
your
failings
in
a
plain
light
,
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
her
adoration
.
But
do
n't
notice
it
*NL*
further
:
I
wished
to
punish
her
sauciness
,
that
's
all
.
I
like
her
too
*NL*
well
,
my
dear
Heathcliff
,
to
let
you
absolutely
seize
and
devour
her
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
like
her
too
ill
to
attempt
it
,
'
said
he
,
`
except
in
a
very
*NL*
ghoulish
fashion
.
You
'd
hear
of
odd
things
if
I
lived
alone
with
that
*NL*
mawkish
,
waxen
face
:
the
most
ordinary
would
be
painting
on
its
white
the
*NL*
colours
of
the
rainbow
,
and
turning
the
blue
eyes
black
,
every
day
or
*NL*
two
:
they
detestably
resemble
Linton
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Delectably
!
'
observed
Catherine
.
`
They
are
dove
's
eyes
--
angel
's
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
her
brother
's
heir
,
is
she
not
?
'
he
asked
,
after
a
brief
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
,
'
returned
his
companion
.
`
Half
a
dozen
*NL*
nephews
shall
erase
her
title
,
please
heaven
!
Abstract
your
mind
from
*NL*
the
subject
at
present
:
you
are
too
prone
to
covet
your
neighbour
's
*NL*
goods
;
remember
_
this
_
neighbour
's
goods
are
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
they
were
_
mine
_
,
they
would
be
none
the
less
that
,
'
said
Heathcliff
;
*NL*
`
but
though
Isabella
Linton
may
be
silly
,
she
is
scarcely
mad
;
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
we
'll
dismiss
the
matter
,
as
you
advise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
From
their
tongues
they
did
dismiss
it
;
and
Catherine
,
probably
,
from
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
The
other
,
I
felt
certain
,
recalled
it
often
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
evening
.
I
saw
him
smile
to
himself
--
grin
rather
--
and
lapse
into
*NL*
ominous
musing
whenever
Mrs.
Linton
had
occasion
to
be
absent
from
the
*NL*
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
determined
to
watch
his
movements
.
My
heart
invariably
cleaved
to
the
*NL*
master
's
,
in
preference
to
Catherine
's
side
:
with
reason
I
imagined
,
for
*NL*
he
was
kind
,
and
trustful
,
and
honourable
;
and
she
--
she
could
not
be
*NL*
called
_
opposite
_
,
yet
she
seemed
to
allow
herself
such
wide
latitude
,
*NL*
that
I
had
little
faith
in
her
principles
,
and
still
less
sympathy
for
*NL*
her
feelings
.
I
wanted
something
to
happen
which
might
have
the
effect
*NL*
of
freeing
both
Wuthering
Heights
and
the
Grange
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
*NL*
quietly
;
leaving
us
as
we
had
been
prior
to
his
advent
.
His
visits
were
*NL*
a
continual
nightmare
to
me
;
and
,
I
suspected
,
to
my
master
also
.
His
*NL*
abode
at
the
Heights
was
an
oppression
past
explaining
.
I
felt
that
God
*NL*
had
forsaken
the
stray
sheep
there
to
its
own
wicked
wanderings
,
and
an
*NL*
evil
beast
prowled
between
it
and
the
fold
,
waiting
his
time
to
spring
*NL*
and
destroy
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
while
meditating
on
these
things
in
solitude
,
I
've
got
up
in
a
*NL*
sudden
terror
,
and
put
on
my
bonnet
to
go
see
how
all
was
at
the
farm
.
*NL*
I
've
persuaded
my
conscience
that
it
was
a
duty
to
warn
him
how
people
*NL*
talked
regarding
his
ways
;
and
then
I
've
recollected
his
confirmed
bad
*NL*
habits
,
and
,
hopeless
of
benefiting
him
,
have
flinched
from
re-entering
*NL*
the
dismal
house
,
doubting
if
I
could
bear
to
be
taken
at
my
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
time
I
passed
the
old
gate
,
going
out
of
my
way
,
on
a
journey
to
*NL*
Gimmerton
.
It
was
about
the
period
that
my
narrative
has
reached
:
a
*NL*
bright
frosty
afternoon
;
the
ground
bare
,
and
the
road
hard
and
dry
.
I
*NL*
came
to
a
stone
where
the
highway
branches
off
on
to
the
moor
at
your
*NL*
left
hand
;
a
rough
sand-pillar
,
with
the
letters
W.
H.
cut
on
its
north
*NL*
side
,
on
the
east
,
G.
,
and
on
the
south-west
,
T.
G
.
It
serves
as
a
*NL*
guide-post
to
the
Grange
,
the
Heights
,
and
village
.
The
sun
shone
yellow
*NL*
on
its
grey
head
,
reminding
me
of
summer
;
and
I
can
not
say
why
,
but
all
*NL*
at
once
a
gush
of
child
's
sensations
flowed
into
my
heart
.
Hindley
and
I
*NL*
held
it
a
favourite
spot
twenty
years
before
.
I
gazed
long
at
the
*NL*
weather-worn
block
;
and
,
stooping
down
,
perceived
a
hole
near
the
bottom
*NL*
still
full
of
snail-shells
and
pebbles
,
which
we
were
fond
of
storing
*NL*
there
with
more
perishable
things
;
and
,
as
fresh
as
reality
,
it
appeared
*NL*
that
I
beheld
my
early
playmate
seated
on
the
withered
turf
:
his
dark
,
*NL*
square
head
bent
forward
,
and
his
little
hand
scooping
out
the
earth
*NL*
with
a
piece
of
slate
.
`
Poor
Hindley
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
involuntarily
.
I
*NL*
started
:
my
bodily
eye
was
cheated
into
a
momentary
belief
that
the
*NL*
child
lifted
its
face
and
stared
straight
into
mine
!
It
vanished
in
a
*NL*
twinkling
;
but
immediately
I
felt
an
irresistible
yearning
to
be
at
the
*NL*
Heights
.
Superstition
urged
me
to
comply
with
this
impulse
:
supposing
he
*NL*
should
be
dead
!
I
thought
--
or
should
die
soon
!
--
supposing
it
were
a
sign
*NL*
of
death
!
The
nearer
I
got
to
the
house
the
more
agitated
I
grew
;
and
on
*NL*
catching
sight
of
it
I
trembled
in
every
limb
.
The
apparition
had
*NL*
outstripped
me
:
it
stood
looking
through
the
gate
.
That
was
my
first
*NL*
idea
on
observing
an
elf-locked
,
brown-eyed
boy
setting
his
ruddy
*NL*
countenance
against
the
bars
.
Further
reflection
suggested
this
must
be
*NL*
Hareton
,
_
my
_
Hareton
,
not
altered
greatly
since
I
left
him
,
ten
months
*NL*
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
bless
thee
,
darling
!
'
I
cried
,
forgetting
instantaneously
my
*NL*
foolish
fears
.
`
Hareton
,
it
's
Nelly
!
Nelly
,
thy
nurse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
retreated
out
of
arm
's
length
,
and
picked
up
a
large
flint
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
come
to
see
thy
father
,
Hareton
,
'
I
added
,
guessing
from
the
*NL*
action
that
Nelly
,
if
she
lived
in
his
memory
at
all
,
was
not
recognised
*NL*
as
one
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
missile
to
hurl
it
;
I
commenced
a
soothing
speech
,
but
*NL*
could
not
stay
his
hand
:
the
stone
struck
my
bonnet
;
and
then
ensued
,
*NL*
from
the
stammering
lips
of
the
little
fellow
,
a
string
of
curses
,
which
,
*NL*
whether
he
comprehended
them
or
not
,
were
delivered
with
practised
*NL*
emphasis
,
and
distorted
his
baby
features
into
a
shocking
expression
of
*NL*
malignity
.
You
may
be
certain
this
grieved
more
than
angered
me
.
Fit
to
*NL*
cry
,
I
took
an
orange
from
my
pocket
,
and
offered
it
to
propitiate
him
.
*NL*
He
hesitated
,
and
then
snatched
it
from
my
hold
;
as
if
he
fancied
I
only
*NL*
intended
to
tempt
and
disappoint
him
.
I
showed
another
,
keeping
it
out
*NL*
of
his
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
has
taught
you
those
fine
words
,
my
bairn
?
'
I
inquired
.
`
The
*NL*
curate
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
the
curate
,
and
thee
!
Gie
me
that
,
'
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
us
where
you
got
your
lessons
,
and
you
shall
have
it
,
'
said
I.
*NL*
`
Who
's
your
master
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Devil
daddy
,
'
was
his
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
do
you
learn
from
daddy
?
'
I
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
at
the
fruit
;
I
raised
it
higher
.
`
What
does
he
teach
you
?
'
I
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Naught
,
'
said
he
,
`
but
to
keep
out
of
his
gait
.
Daddy
can
not
bide
me
,
*NL*
because
I
swear
at
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
and
the
devil
teaches
you
to
swear
at
daddy
?
'
I
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
--
nay
,
'
he
drawled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
,
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
asked
if
he
liked
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
!
'
he
answered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desiring
to
have
his
reasons
for
liking
him
,
I
could
only
gather
the
*NL*
sentences
--
'
I
know
n't
:
he
pays
dad
back
what
he
gies
to
me
--
he
curses
*NL*
daddy
for
cursing
me
.
He
says
I
mun
do
as
I
will
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
curate
does
not
teach
you
to
read
and
write
,
then
?
'
I
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
was
told
the
curate
should
have
his
--
teeth
dashed
down
his
--
throat
,
*NL*
if
he
stepped
over
the
threshold
--
Heathcliff
had
promised
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
the
orange
in
his
hand
,
and
bade
him
tell
his
father
that
a
woman
*NL*
called
Nelly
Dean
was
waiting
to
speak
with
him
,
by
the
garden
gate
.
He
*NL*
went
up
the
walk
,
and
entered
the
house
;
but
,
instead
of
Hindley
,
*NL*
Heathcliff
appeared
on
the
door-stones
;
and
I
turned
directly
and
ran
*NL*
down
the
road
as
hard
as
ever
I
could
race
,
making
no
halt
till
I
gained
*NL*
the
guide-post
,
and
feeling
as
scared
as
if
I
had
raised
a
goblin
.
This
*NL*
is
not
much
connected
with
Miss
Isabella
's
affair
:
except
that
it
urged
*NL*
me
to
resolve
further
on
mounting
vigilant
guard
,
and
doing
my
utmost
to
*NL*
check
the
spread
of
such
bad
influence
at
the
Grange
:
even
though
I
*NL*
should
wake
a
domestic
storm
,
by
thwarting
Mrs.
Linton
's
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
Heathcliff
came
my
young
lady
chanced
to
be
feeding
some
*NL*
pigeons
in
the
court
.
She
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
her
sister-in-law
*NL*
for
three
days
;
but
she
had
likewise
dropped
her
fretful
complaining
,
and
*NL*
we
found
it
a
great
comfort
.
Heathcliff
had
not
the
habit
of
bestowing
a
*NL*
single
unnecessary
civility
on
Miss
Linton
,
I
knew
.
Now
,
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
beheld
her
,
his
first
precaution
was
to
take
a
sweeping
survey
of
the
*NL*
house-front
.
I
was
standing
by
the
kitchen-window
,
but
I
drew
out
of
*NL*
sight
.
He
then
stepped
across
the
pavement
to
her
,
and
said
something
:
*NL*
she
seemed
embarrassed
,
and
desirous
of
getting
away
;
to
prevent
it
,
he
*NL*
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
.
She
averted
her
face
:
he
apparently
put
some
*NL*
question
which
she
had
no
mind
to
answer
.
There
was
another
rapid
glance
*NL*
at
the
house
,
and
supposing
himself
unseen
,
the
scoundrel
had
the
*NL*
impudence
to
embrace
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Judas
!
Traitor
!
'
I
ejaculated
.
`
You
are
a
hypocrite
,
too
,
are
you
?
A
*NL*
deliberate
deceiver
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
,
Nelly
?
'
said
Catherine
's
voice
at
my
elbow
:
I
had
been
*NL*
over-intent
on
watching
the
pair
outside
to
mark
her
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
worthless
friend
!
'
I
answered
,
warmly
:
`
the
sneaking
rascal
yonder
.
*NL*
Ah
,
he
has
caught
a
glimpse
of
us
--
he
is
coming
in
!
I
wonder
will
he
*NL*
have
the
heart
to
find
a
plausible
excuse
for
making
love
to
Miss
,
when
*NL*
he
told
you
he
hated
her
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
saw
Isabella
tear
herself
free
,
and
run
into
the
garden
;
and
*NL*
a
minute
after
,
Heathcliff
opened
the
door
.
I
could
n't
withhold
giving
*NL*
some
loose
to
my
indignation
;
but
Catherine
angrily
insisted
on
silence
,
*NL*
and
threatened
to
order
me
out
of
the
kitchen
,
if
I
dared
to
be
so
*NL*
presumptuous
as
to
put
in
my
insolent
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
hear
you
,
people
might
think
you
were
the
mistress
!
'
she
cried
.
`
You
*NL*
want
setting
down
in
your
right
place
!
Heathcliff
,
what
are
you
about
,
*NL*
raising
this
stir
?
I
said
you
must
let
Isabella
alone
!
--
I
beg
you
will
,
*NL*
unless
you
are
tired
of
being
received
here
,
and
wish
Linton
to
draw
the
*NL*
bolts
against
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
forbid
that
he
should
try
!
'
answered
the
black
villain
.
I
detested
*NL*
him
just
then
.
`
God
keep
him
meek
and
patient
!
Every
day
I
grow
madder
*NL*
after
sending
him
to
heaven
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
said
Catherine
,
shutting
the
inner
door
!
`
Do
n't
vex
me
.
Why
*NL*
have
you
disregarded
my
request
?
Did
she
come
across
you
on
purpose
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
to
you
?
'
he
growled
.
'
I
have
a
right
to
kiss
her
,
if
she
*NL*
chooses
;
and
you
have
no
right
to
object
.
I
am
not
_
your
_
husband
:
_
you
_
*NL*
need
n't
be
jealous
of
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
jealous
of
you
,
'
replied
the
mistress
;
`
I
'm
jealous
for
you
.
*NL*
Clear
your
face
:
you
sha
'n'
t
scowl
at
me
!
If
you
like
Isabella
,
you
*NL*
shall
marry
her
.
But
do
you
like
her
?
Tell
the
truth
,
Heathcliff
!
*NL*
There
,
you
wo
n't
answer
.
I
'm
certain
you
do
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
would
Mr.
Linton
approve
of
his
sister
marrying
that
man
?
'
I
*NL*
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Linton
should
approve
,
'
returned
my
lady
,
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
might
spare
himself
the
trouble
,
'
said
Heathcliff
:
'
I
could
do
as
*NL*
well
without
his
approbation
.
And
as
to
you
,
Catherine
,
I
have
a
mind
to
*NL*
speak
a
few
words
now
,
while
we
are
at
it
.
I
want
you
to
be
aware
that
I
*NL*
_
know
_
you
have
treated
me
infernally
--
infernally
!
Do
you
hear
?
And
if
*NL*
you
flatter
yourself
that
I
do
n't
perceive
it
,
you
are
a
fool
;
and
if
*NL*
you
think
I
can
be
consoled
by
sweet
words
,
you
are
an
idiot
:
and
if
you
*NL*
fancy
I
'll
suffer
unrevenged
,
I
'll
convince
you
of
the
contrary
,
in
a
*NL*
very
little
while
!
Meantime
,
thank
you
for
telling
me
your
*NL*
sister-in-law
's
secret
:
I
swear
I
'll
make
the
most
of
it
.
And
stand
you
*NL*
aside
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
new
phase
of
his
character
is
this
?
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
Linton
,
in
*NL*
amazement
.
`
I
've
treated
you
infernally
--
and
you
'll
take
your
revenge
!
*NL*
How
will
you
take
it
,
ungrateful
brute
?
How
have
I
treated
you
*NL*
infernally
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
seek
no
revenge
on
you
,
'
replied
Heathcliff
,
less
vehemently
.
`
That
's
*NL*
not
the
plan
.
The
tyrant
grinds
down
his
slaves
and
they
do
n't
turn
*NL*
against
him
;
they
crush
those
beneath
them
.
You
are
welcome
to
torture
*NL*
me
to
death
for
your
amusement
,
only
allow
me
to
amuse
myself
a
little
in
*NL*
the
same
style
,
and
refrain
from
insult
as
much
as
you
are
able
.
Having
*NL*
levelled
my
palace
,
do
n't
erect
a
hovel
and
complacently
admire
your
own
*NL*
charity
in
giving
me
that
for
a
home
.
If
I
imagined
you
really
wished
me
*NL*
to
marry
Isabel
,
I
'd
cut
my
throat
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
the
evil
is
that
I
am
_
not
_
jealous
,
is
it
?
'
cried
Catherine
.
`
Well
,
*NL*
I
wo
n't
repeat
my
offer
of
a
wife
:
it
is
as
bad
as
offering
Satan
a
lost
*NL*
soul
.
Your
bliss
lies
,
like
his
,
in
inflicting
misery
.
You
prove
it
.
*NL*
Edgar
is
restored
from
the
ill-temper
he
gave
way
to
at
your
coming
;
I
*NL*
begin
to
be
secure
and
tranquil
;
and
you
,
restless
to
know
us
at
peace
,
*NL*
appear
resolved
on
exciting
a
quarrel
.
Quarrel
with
Edgar
,
if
you
*NL*
please
,
Heathcliff
,
and
deceive
his
sister
:
you
'll
hit
on
exactly
the
*NL*
most
efficient
method
of
revenging
yourself
on
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
ceased
.
Mrs.
Linton
sat
down
by
the
fire
,
flushed
and
*NL*
gloomy
.
The
spirit
which
served
her
was
growing
intractable
:
she
could
*NL*
neither
lay
nor
control
it
.
He
stood
on
the
hearth
with
folded
arms
,
*NL*
brooding
on
his
evil
thoughts
;
and
in
this
position
I
left
them
to
seek
*NL*
the
master
,
who
was
wondering
what
kept
Catherine
below
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
'
said
he
,
when
I
entered
,
`
have
you
seen
your
mistress
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
;
she
's
in
the
kitchen
,
sir
,
'
I
answered
.
`
She
's
sadly
put
out
by
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
behaviour
:
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
think
it
's
time
to
arrange
*NL*
his
visits
on
another
footing
.
There
's
harm
in
being
too
soft
,
and
now
*NL*
it
's
come
to
this
--
.
'
And
I
related
the
scene
in
the
court
,
and
,
as
near
*NL*
as
I
dared
,
the
whole
subsequent
dispute
.
I
fancied
it
could
not
be
very
*NL*
prejudicial
to
Mrs.
Linton
;
unless
she
made
it
so
afterwards
,
by
assuming
*NL*
the
defensive
for
her
guest
.
Edgar
Linton
had
difficulty
in
hearing
me
*NL*
to
the
close
.
His
first
words
revealed
that
he
did
not
clear
his
wife
of
*NL*
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
insufferable
!
'
he
exclaimed
.
`
It
is
disgraceful
that
she
should
*NL*
own
him
for
a
friend
,
and
force
his
company
on
me
!
Call
me
two
men
out
*NL*
of
the
hall
,
Ellen
.
Catherine
shall
linger
no
longer
to
argue
with
the
*NL*
low
ruffian
--
I
have
humoured
her
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
,
and
bidding
the
servants
wait
in
the
passage
,
went
,
*NL*
followed
by
me
,
to
the
kitchen
.
Its
occupants
had
recommenced
their
*NL*
angry
discussion
:
Mrs.
Linton
,
at
least
,
was
scolding
with
renewed
*NL*
vigour
;
Heathcliff
had
moved
to
the
window
,
and
hung
his
head
,
somewhat
*NL*
cowed
by
her
violent
rating
apparently
.
He
saw
the
master
first
,
and
*NL*
made
a
hasty
motion
that
she
should
be
silent
;
which
she
obeyed
,
*NL*
abruptly
,
on
discovering
the
reason
of
his
intimation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
is
this
?
'
said
Linton
,
addressing
her
;
`
what
notion
of
propriety
*NL*
must
you
have
to
remain
here
,
after
the
language
which
has
been
held
to
*NL*
you
by
that
blackguard
?
I
suppose
,
because
it
is
his
ordinary
talk
you
*NL*
think
nothing
of
it
:
you
are
habituated
to
his
baseness
,
and
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
imagine
I
can
get
used
to
it
too
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
been
listening
at
the
door
,
Edgar
?
'
asked
the
mistress
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
particularly
calculated
to
provoke
her
husband
,
implying
both
*NL*
carelessness
and
contempt
of
his
irritation
.
Heathcliff
,
who
had
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
at
the
former
speech
,
gave
a
sneering
laugh
at
the
latter
;
on
*NL*
purpose
,
it
seemed
,
to
draw
Mr.
Linton
's
attention
to
him
.
He
succeeded
;
*NL*
but
Edgar
did
not
mean
to
entertain
him
with
any
high
flights
of
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
been
so
far
forbearing
with
you
,
sir
,
'
he
said
quietly
;
`
not
that
I
*NL*
was
ignorant
of
your
miserable
,
degraded
character
,
but
I
felt
you
were
*NL*
only
partly
responsible
for
that
;
and
Catherine
wishing
to
keep
up
your
*NL*
acquaintance
,
I
acquiesced
--
foolishly
.
Your
presence
is
a
moral
poison
*NL*
that
would
contaminate
the
most
virtuous
:
for
that
cause
,
and
to
prevent
*NL*
worse
consequences
,
I
shall
deny
you
hereafter
admission
into
this
house
,
*NL*
and
give
notice
now
that
I
require
your
instant
departure
.
Three
*NL*
minutes
'
delay
will
render
it
involuntary
and
ignominious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
measured
the
height
and
breadth
of
the
speaker
with
an
eye
*NL*
full
of
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cathy
,
this
lamb
of
yours
threatens
like
a
bull
!
'
he
said
.
`
It
is
in
*NL*
danger
of
splitting
its
skull
against
my
knuckles
.
By
God
!
Mr.
Linton
,
*NL*
I
'm
mortally
sorry
that
you
are
not
worth
knocking
down
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
master
glanced
towards
the
passage
,
and
signed
me
to
fetch
the
men
:
he
*NL*
had
no
intention
of
hazarding
a
personal
encounter
.
I
obeyed
the
hint
;
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Linton
,
suspecting
something
,
followed
;
and
when
I
attempted
to
*NL*
call
them
,
she
pulled
me
back
,
slammed
the
door
to
,
and
locked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fair
means
!
'
she
said
,
in
answer
to
her
husband
's
look
of
angry
*NL*
surprise
.
`
If
you
have
not
courage
to
attack
him
,
make
an
apology
,
or
*NL*
allow
yourself
to
be
beaten
.
It
will
correct
you
of
feigning
more
valour
*NL*
than
you
possess
.
No
,
I
'll
swallow
the
key
before
you
shall
get
it
!
I
'm
*NL*
delightfully
rewarded
for
my
kindness
to
each
!
After
constant
indulgence
*NL*
of
one
's
weak
nature
,
and
the
other
's
bad
one
,
I
earn
for
thanks
two
*NL*
samples
of
blind
ingratitude
,
stupid
to
absurdity
!
Edgar
,
I
was
*NL*
defending
you
and
yours
;
and
I
wish
Heathcliff
may
flog
you
sick
,
for
*NL*
daring
to
think
an
evil
thought
of
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
need
the
medium
of
a
flogging
to
produce
that
effect
on
the
*NL*
master
.
He
tried
to
wrest
the
key
from
Catherine
's
grasp
,
and
for
safety
*NL*
she
flung
it
into
the
hottest
part
of
the
fire
;
whereupon
Mr.
Edgar
was
*NL*
taken
with
a
nervous
trembling
,
and
his
countenance
grew
deadly
pale
.
For
*NL*
his
life
he
could
not
avert
that
excess
of
emotion
:
mingled
anguish
and
*NL*
humiliation
overcame
him
completely
.
He
leant
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
*NL*
and
covered
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
heavens
!
In
old
days
this
would
win
you
knighthood
!
'
exclaimed
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
.
`
We
are
vanquished
!
we
are
vanquished
!
Heathcliff
would
as
soon
*NL*
lift
a
finger
at
you
as
the
king
would
march
his
army
against
a
colony
of
*NL*
mice
.
Cheer
up
!
you
sha
'n'
t
be
hurt
!
Your
type
is
not
a
lamb
,
it
's
a
*NL*
sucking
leveret
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
you
joy
of
the
milk-blooded
coward
,
Cathy
!
'
said
her
friend
.
'
I
*NL*
compliment
you
on
your
taste
.
And
that
is
the
slavering
,
shivering
thing
*NL*
you
preferred
to
me
!
I
would
not
strike
him
with
my
fist
,
but
I
'd
kick
*NL*
him
with
my
foot
,
and
experience
considerable
satisfaction
.
Is
he
*NL*
weeping
,
or
is
he
going
to
faint
for
fear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
approached
and
gave
the
chair
on
which
Linton
rested
a
push
.
*NL*
He
'd
better
have
kept
his
distance
:
my
master
quickly
sprang
erect
,
and
*NL*
struck
him
full
on
the
throat
a
blow
that
would
have
levelled
a
slighter
*NL*
man
.
It
took
his
breath
for
a
minute
;
and
while
he
choked
,
Mr.
Linton
*NL*
walked
out
by
the
back
door
into
the
yard
,
and
from
thence
to
the
front
*NL*
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
you
've
done
with
coming
here
,
'
cried
Catherine
.
`
Get
away
,
now
;
*NL*
he
'll
return
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
half-a-dozen
assistants
.
If
he
*NL*
did
overhear
us
,
of
course
he
'd
never
forgive
you
.
You
've
played
me
an
*NL*
ill
turn
,
Heathcliff
!
But
go
--
make
haste
!
I
'd
rather
see
Edgar
at
bay
*NL*
than
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
suppose
I
'm
going
with
that
blow
burning
in
my
gullet
?
'
he
*NL*
thundered
.
`
By
hell
,
no
!
I
'll
crush
his
ribs
in
like
a
rotten
hazel-nut
*NL*
before
I
cross
the
threshold
!
If
I
do
n't
floor
him
now
,
I
shall
murder
*NL*
him
some
time
;
so
,
as
you
value
his
existence
,
let
me
get
at
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
not
coming
,
'
I
interposed
,
framing
a
bit
of
a
lie
.
`
There
's
the
*NL*
coachman
and
the
two
gardeners
;
you
'll
surely
not
wait
to
be
thrust
into
*NL*
the
road
by
them
!
Each
has
a
bludgeon
;
and
master
will
,
very
likely
,
be
*NL*
watching
from
the
parlour-windows
to
see
that
they
fulfil
his
orders
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardeners
and
coachman
were
there
:
but
Linton
was
with
them
.
They
*NL*
had
already
entered
the
court
.
Heathcliff
,
on
the
second
thoughts
,
*NL*
resolved
to
avoid
a
struggle
against
three
underlings
:
he
seized
the
*NL*
poker
,
smashed
the
lock
from
the
inner
door
,
and
made
his
escape
as
they
*NL*
tramped
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
,
who
was
very
much
excited
,
bade
me
accompany
her
up-stairs
.
*NL*
She
did
not
know
my
share
in
contributing
to
the
disturbance
,
and
I
was
*NL*
anxious
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
nearly
distracted
,
Nelly
!
'
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
herself
on
the
*NL*
sofa
.
'
A
thousand
smiths
'
hammers
are
beating
in
my
head
!
Tell
Isabella
*NL*
to
shun
me
;
this
uproar
is
owing
to
her
;
and
should
she
or
any
one
else
*NL*
aggravate
my
anger
at
present
,
I
shall
get
wild
.
And
,
Nelly
,
say
to
*NL*
Edgar
,
if
you
see
him
again
to-night
,
that
I
'm
in
danger
of
being
*NL*
seriously
ill
.
I
wish
it
may
prove
true
.
He
has
startled
and
distressed
*NL*
me
shockingly
!
I
want
to
frighten
him
.
Besides
,
he
might
come
and
begin
*NL*
a
string
of
abuse
or
complainings
;
I
'm
certain
I
should
recriminate
,
and
*NL*
God
knows
where
we
should
end
!
Will
you
do
so
,
my
good
Nelly
?
You
are
*NL*
aware
that
I
am
no
way
blamable
in
this
matter
.
What
possessed
him
to
*NL*
turn
listener
?
Heathcliff
's
talk
was
outrageous
,
after
you
left
us
;
but
*NL*
I
could
soon
have
diverted
him
from
Isabella
,
and
the
rest
meant
nothing
.
*NL*
Now
all
is
dashed
wrong
;
by
the
fool
's
craving
to
hear
evil
of
self
,
that
*NL*
haunts
some
people
like
a
demon
!
Had
Edgar
never
gathered
our
*NL*
conversation
,
he
would
never
have
been
the
worse
for
it
.
Really
,
when
he
*NL*
opened
on
me
in
that
unreasonable
tone
of
displeasure
after
I
had
scolded
*NL*
Heathcliff
till
I
was
hoarse
for
him
,
I
did
not
care
hardly
what
they
did
*NL*
to
each
other
;
especially
as
I
felt
that
,
however
the
scene
closed
,
we
*NL*
should
all
be
driven
asunder
for
nobody
knows
how
long
!
Well
,
if
I
*NL*
can
not
keep
Heathcliff
for
my
friend
--
if
Edgar
will
be
mean
and
jealous
,
*NL*
I
'll
try
to
break
their
hearts
by
breaking
my
own
.
That
will
be
a
prompt
*NL*
way
of
finishing
all
,
when
I
am
pushed
to
extremity
!
But
it
's
a
deed
to
*NL*
be
reserved
for
a
forlorn
hope
;
I
'd
not
take
Linton
by
surprise
with
it
.
*NL*
To
this
point
he
has
been
discreet
in
dreading
to
provoke
me
;
you
must
*NL*
represent
the
peril
of
quitting
that
policy
,
and
remind
him
of
my
*NL*
passionate
temper
,
verging
,
when
kindled
,
on
frenzy
.
I
wish
you
could
*NL*
dismiss
that
apathy
out
of
that
countenance
,
and
look
rather
more
anxious
*NL*
about
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
stolidity
with
which
I
received
these
instructions
was
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
rather
exasperating
:
for
they
were
delivered
in
perfect
sincerity
;
but
I
*NL*
believed
a
person
who
could
plan
the
turning
of
her
fits
of
passion
to
*NL*
account
,
beforehand
,
might
,
by
exerting
her
will
,
manage
to
control
*NL*
herself
tolerably
,
even
while
under
their
influence
;
and
I
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
`
frighten
'
her
husband
,
as
she
said
,
and
multiply
his
annoyances
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
serving
her
selfishness
.
Therefore
I
said
nothing
when
I
*NL*
met
the
master
coming
towards
the
parlour
;
but
I
took
the
liberty
of
*NL*
turning
back
to
listen
whether
they
would
resume
their
quarrel
together
.
*NL*
He
began
to
speak
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Remain
where
you
are
,
Catherine
,
'
he
said
;
without
any
anger
in
his
*NL*
voice
,
but
with
much
sorrowful
despondency
.
'
I
shall
not
stay
.
I
am
*NL*
neither
come
to
wrangle
nor
be
reconciled
;
but
I
wish
just
to
learn
*NL*
whether
,
after
this
evening
's
events
,
you
intend
to
continue
your
*NL*
intimacy
with
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
'
interrupted
the
mistress
,
stamping
her
foot
,
`
for
*NL*
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
hear
no
more
of
it
now
!
Your
cold
blood
can
not
be
*NL*
worked
into
a
fever
:
your
veins
are
full
of
ice-water
;
but
mine
are
*NL*
boiling
,
and
the
sight
of
such
chillness
makes
them
dance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
get
rid
of
me
,
answer
my
question
,
'
persevered
Mr.
Linton
.
`
You
must
*NL*
answer
it
;
and
that
violence
does
not
alarm
me
.
I
have
found
that
you
*NL*
can
be
as
stoical
as
anyone
,
when
you
please
.
Will
you
give
up
*NL*
Heathcliff
hereafter
,
or
will
you
give
up
me
?
It
is
impossible
for
you
*NL*
to
be
_
my
_
friend
and
_
his
_
at
the
same
time
;
and
I
absolutely
_
require
_
*NL*
to
know
which
you
choose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
require
to
be
let
alone
!
'
exclaimed
Catherine
,
furiously
.
'
I
demand
*NL*
it
!
Do
n't
you
see
I
can
scarcely
stand
?
Edgar
,
you
--
you
leave
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
rang
the
bell
till
it
broke
with
a
twang
;
I
entered
leisurely
.
It
*NL*
was
enough
to
try
the
temper
of
a
saint
,
such
senseless
,
wicked
rages
!
*NL*
There
she
lay
dashing
her
head
against
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
grinding
*NL*
her
teeth
,
so
that
you
might
fancy
she
would
crash
them
to
splinters
!
Mr.
*NL*
Linton
stood
looking
at
her
in
sudden
compunction
and
fear
.
He
told
me
*NL*
to
fetch
some
water
.
She
had
no
breath
for
speaking
.
I
brought
a
glass
*NL*
full
;
and
as
she
would
not
drink
,
I
sprinkled
it
on
her
face
.
In
a
few
*NL*
seconds
she
stretched
herself
out
stiff
,
and
turned
up
her
eyes
,
while
*NL*
her
cheeks
,
at
once
blanched
and
livid
,
assumed
the
aspect
of
death
.
*NL*
Linton
looked
terrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
nothing
in
the
world
the
matter
,
'
I
whispered
.
I
did
not
want
*NL*
him
to
yield
,
though
I
could
not
help
being
afraid
in
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
has
blood
on
her
lips
!
'
he
said
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
!
'
I
answered
,
tartly
.
And
I
told
him
how
she
had
resolved
,
*NL*
previous
to
his
coming
,
on
exhibiting
a
fit
of
frenzy
.
I
incautiously
*NL*
gave
the
account
aloud
,
and
she
heard
me
;
for
she
started
up
--
her
hair
*NL*
flying
over
her
shoulders
,
her
eyes
flashing
,
the
muscles
of
her
neck
*NL*
and
arms
standing
out
preternaturally
.
I
made
up
my
mind
for
broken
*NL*
bones
,
at
least
;
but
she
only
glared
about
her
for
an
instant
,
and
then
*NL*
rushed
from
the
room
.
The
master
directed
me
to
follow
;
I
did
,
to
her
*NL*
chamber-door
:
she
hindered
me
from
going
further
by
securing
it
against
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
never
offered
to
descend
to
breakfast
next
morning
,
I
went
to
ask
*NL*
whether
she
would
have
some
carried
up
.
`
No
!
'
she
replied
,
peremptorily
.
*NL*
The
same
question
was
repeated
at
dinner
and
tea
;
and
again
on
the
morrow
*NL*
after
,
and
received
the
same
answer
.
Mr.
Linton
,
on
his
part
,
spent
his
*NL*
time
in
the
library
,
and
did
not
inquire
concerning
his
wife
's
*NL*
occupations
.
Isabella
and
he
had
had
an
hour
's
interview
,
during
which
*NL*
he
tried
to
elicit
from
her
some
sentiment
of
proper
horror
for
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
advances
:
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
her
evasive
replies
,
*NL*
and
was
obliged
to
close
the
examination
unsatisfactorily
;
adding
,
*NL*
however
,
a
solemn
warning
,
that
if
she
were
so
insane
as
to
encourage
*NL*
that
worthless
suitor
,
it
would
dissolve
all
bonds
of
relationship
*NL*
between
herself
and
him
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Miss
Linton
moped
about
the
park
and
garden
,
always
silent
,
and
*NL*
almost
always
in
tears
;
and
her
brother
shut
himself
up
among
books
that
*NL*
he
never
opened
--
wearying
,
I
guessed
,
with
a
continual
vague
expectation
*NL*
that
Catherine
,
repenting
her
conduct
,
would
come
of
her
own
accord
to
*NL*
ask
pardon
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
--
and
_
she
_
fasted
pertinaciously
,
*NL*
under
the
idea
,
probably
,
that
at
every
meal
Edgar
was
ready
to
choke
for
*NL*
her
absence
,
and
pride
alone
held
him
from
running
to
cast
himself
at
her
*NL*
feet
;
I
went
about
my
household
duties
,
convinced
that
the
Grange
had
but
*NL*
one
sensible
soul
in
its
walls
,
and
that
lodged
in
my
body
.
I
wasted
no
*NL*
condolences
on
Miss
,
nor
any
expostulations
on
my
mistress
;
nor
did
I
pay
*NL*
much
attention
to
the
sighs
of
my
master
,
who
yearned
to
hear
his
lady
's
*NL*
name
,
since
he
might
not
hear
her
voice
.
I
determined
they
should
come
*NL*
about
as
they
pleased
for
me
;
and
though
it
was
a
tiresomely
slow
*NL*
process
,
I
began
to
rejoice
at
length
in
a
faint
dawn
of
its
progress
:
as
*NL*
I
thought
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
,
on
the
third
day
,
unbarred
her
door
,
and
having
finished
the
*NL*
water
in
her
pitcher
and
decanter
,
desired
a
renewed
supply
,
and
a
basin
*NL*
of
gruel
,
for
she
believed
she
was
dying
.
That
I
set
down
as
a
speech
*NL*
meant
for
Edgar
's
ears
;
I
believed
no
such
thing
,
so
I
kept
it
to
myself
*NL*
and
brought
her
some
tea
and
dry
toast
.
She
ate
and
drank
eagerly
,
and
*NL*
sank
back
on
her
pillow
again
,
clenching
her
hands
and
groaning
.
`
Oh
,
I
*NL*
will
die
,
'
she
exclaimed
,
`
since
no
one
cares
anything
about
me
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
had
not
taken
that
.
'
Then
a
good
while
after
I
heard
her
murmur
,
`
No
,
*NL*
I
'll
not
die
--
he
'd
be
glad
--
he
does
not
love
me
at
all
--
he
would
never
*NL*
miss
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
you
want
anything
,
ma'am
?
'
I
inquired
,
still
preserving
my
external
*NL*
composure
,
in
spite
of
her
ghastly
countenance
and
strange
,
exaggerated
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
that
apathetic
being
doing
?
'
she
demanded
,
pushing
the
thick
*NL*
entangled
locks
from
her
wasted
face
.
`
Has
he
fallen
into
a
lethargy
,
or
*NL*
is
he
dead
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Neither
,
'
replied
I
;
`
if
you
mean
Mr.
Linton
.
He
's
tolerably
well
,
I
*NL*
think
,
though
his
studies
occupy
him
rather
more
than
they
ought
:
he
is
*NL*
continually
among
his
books
,
since
he
has
no
other
society
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
not
have
spoken
so
if
I
had
known
her
true
condition
,
but
I
*NL*
could
not
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
she
acted
a
part
of
her
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Among
his
books
!
'
she
cried
,
confounded
.
`
And
I
dying
!
I
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
the
grave
!
My
God
!
does
he
know
how
I
'm
altered
?
'
continued
she
,
*NL*
staring
at
her
reflection
in
a
mirror
hanging
against
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
`
Is
that
Catherine
Linton
?
He
imagines
me
in
a
pet
--
in
play
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
Can
not
you
inform
him
that
it
is
frightful
earnest
?
Nelly
,
if
it
be
not
*NL*
too
late
,
as
soon
as
I
learn
how
he
feels
,
I
'll
choose
between
these
two
:
*NL*
either
to
starve
at
once
--
that
would
be
no
punishment
unless
he
had
a
*NL*
heart
--
or
to
recover
,
and
leave
the
country
.
Are
you
speaking
the
truth
*NL*
about
him
now
?
Take
care
.
Is
he
actually
so
utterly
indifferent
for
my
*NL*
life
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
ma'am
,
'
I
answered
,
`
the
master
has
no
idea
of
your
being
deranged
;
*NL*
and
of
course
he
does
not
fear
that
you
will
let
yourself
die
of
hunger
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
think
not
?
Can
not
you
tell
him
I
will
?
'
she
returned
.
`
Persuade
*NL*
him
!
speak
of
your
own
mind
:
say
you
are
certain
I
will
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
you
forget
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
'
I
suggested
,
`
that
you
have
eaten
some
*NL*
food
with
a
relish
this
evening
,
and
to-morrow
you
will
perceive
its
good
*NL*
effects
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
were
only
sure
it
would
kill
him
,
'
she
interrupted
,
`
I
'd
kill
*NL*
myself
directly
!
These
three
awful
nights
I
've
never
closed
my
lids
--
and
*NL*
oh
,
I
've
been
tormented
!
I
've
been
haunted
,
Nelly
!
But
I
begin
to
fancy
*NL*
you
do
n't
like
me
.
How
strange
!
I
thought
,
though
everybody
hated
and
*NL*
despised
each
other
,
they
could
not
avoid
loving
me
.
And
they
have
all
*NL*
turned
to
enemies
in
a
few
hours
:
they
have
,
I
'm
positive
;
the
people
*NL*
here
.
How
dreary
to
meet
death
,
surrounded
by
their
cold
faces
!
*NL*
Isabella
,
terrified
and
repelled
,
afraid
to
enter
the
room
,
it
would
be
*NL*
so
dreadful
to
watch
Catherine
go
.
And
Edgar
standing
solemnly
by
to
see
*NL*
it
over
;
then
offering
prayers
of
thanks
to
God
for
restoring
peace
to
*NL*
his
house
,
and
going
back
to
his
_
books
_
!
What
in
the
name
of
all
that
*NL*
feels
has
he
to
do
with
_
books
_
,
when
I
am
dying
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
bear
the
notion
which
I
had
put
into
her
head
of
Mr.
*NL*
Linton
's
philosophical
resignation
.
Tossing
about
,
she
increased
her
*NL*
feverish
bewilderment
to
madness
,
and
tore
the
pillow
with
her
teeth
;
*NL*
then
raising
herself
up
all
burning
,
desired
that
I
would
open
the
*NL*
window
.
We
were
in
the
middle
of
winter
,
the
wind
blew
strong
from
the
*NL*
north-east
,
and
I
objected
.
Both
the
expressions
flitting
over
her
face
,
*NL*
and
the
changes
of
her
moods
,
began
to
alarm
me
terribly
;
and
brought
to
*NL*
my
recollection
her
former
illness
,
and
the
doctor
's
injunction
that
she
*NL*
should
not
be
crossed
.
A
minute
previously
she
was
violent
;
now
,
*NL*
supported
on
one
arm
,
and
not
noticing
my
refusal
to
obey
her
,
she
seemed
*NL*
to
find
childish
diversion
in
pulling
the
feathers
from
the
rents
she
had
*NL*
just
made
,
and
ranging
them
on
the
sheet
according
to
their
different
*NL*
species
:
her
mind
had
strayed
to
other
associations
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
a
turkey
's
,
'
she
murmured
to
herself
;
`
and
this
is
a
wild
duck
's
;
*NL*
and
this
is
a
pigeon
's
.
Ah
,
they
put
pigeons
'
feathers
in
the
pillows
--
no
*NL*
wonder
I
could
n't
die
!
Let
me
take
care
to
throw
it
on
the
floor
when
I
*NL*
lie
down
.
And
here
is
a
moor-cock
's
;
and
this
--
I
should
know
it
among
a
*NL*
thousand
--
it
's
a
lapwing
's
.
Bonny
bird
;
wheeling
over
our
heads
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
moor
.
It
wanted
to
get
to
its
nest
,
for
the
clouds
had
*NL*
touched
the
swells
,
and
it
felt
rain
coming
.
This
feather
was
picked
up
*NL*
from
the
heath
,
the
bird
was
not
shot
:
we
saw
its
nest
in
the
winter
,
*NL*
full
of
little
skeletons
.
Heathcliff
set
a
trap
over
it
,
and
the
old
*NL*
ones
dared
not
come
.
I
made
him
promise
he
'd
never
shoot
a
lapwing
after
*NL*
that
,
and
he
did
n't
.
Yes
,
here
are
more
!
Did
he
shoot
my
lapwings
,
*NL*
Nelly
?
Are
they
red
,
any
of
them
?
Let
me
look
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
over
with
that
baby-work
!
'
I
interrupted
,
dragging
the
pillow
away
,
*NL*
and
turning
the
holes
towards
the
mattress
,
for
she
was
removing
its
*NL*
contents
by
handfuls
.
`
Lie
down
and
shut
your
eyes
:
you
're
wandering
.
*NL*
There
's
a
mess
!
The
down
is
flying
about
like
snow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
here
and
there
collecting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
in
you
,
Nelly
,
'
she
continued
dreamily
,
`
an
aged
woman
:
you
have
*NL*
grey
hair
and
bent
shoulders
.
This
bed
is
the
fairy
cave
under
Penistone
*NL*
crags
,
and
you
are
gathering
elf-bolts
to
hurt
our
heifers
;
pretending
,
*NL*
while
I
am
near
,
that
they
are
only
locks
of
wool
.
That
's
what
you
'll
*NL*
come
to
fifty
years
hence
:
I
know
you
are
not
so
now
.
I
'm
not
wandering
:
*NL*
you
're
mistaken
,
or
else
I
should
believe
you
really
_
were
_
that
withered
*NL*
hag
,
and
I
should
think
I
_
was
_
under
Penistone
Crags
;
and
I
'm
conscious
*NL*
it
's
night
,
and
there
are
two
candles
on
the
table
making
the
black
press
*NL*
shine
like
jet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
black
press
?
where
is
that
?
'
I
asked
.
`
You
are
talking
in
your
*NL*
sleep
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
against
the
wall
,
as
it
always
is
,
'
she
replied
.
`
It
_
does
_
appear
*NL*
odd
--
I
see
a
face
in
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
no
press
in
the
room
,
and
never
was
,
'
said
I
,
resuming
my
seat
,
*NL*
and
looping
up
the
curtain
that
I
might
watch
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
_
you
_
see
that
face
?
'
she
inquired
,
gazing
earnestly
at
the
*NL*
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
say
what
I
could
,
I
was
incapable
of
making
her
comprehend
it
to
be
*NL*
her
own
;
so
I
rose
and
covered
it
with
a
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
behind
there
still
!
'
she
pursued
,
anxiously
.
`
And
it
stirred
.
Who
*NL*
is
it
?
I
hope
it
will
not
come
out
when
you
are
gone
!
Oh
!
Nelly
,
the
*NL*
room
is
haunted
!
I
'm
afraid
of
being
alone
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
bid
her
be
composed
;
for
a
succession
of
*NL*
shudders
convulsed
her
frame
,
and
she
would
keep
straining
her
gaze
*NL*
towards
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
nobody
here
!
'
I
insisted
.
`
It
was
_
yourself
_
,
Mrs.
Linton
:
you
*NL*
knew
it
a
while
since
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Myself
!
'
she
gasped
,
`
and
the
clock
is
striking
twelve
!
It
's
true
,
*NL*
then
!
that
's
dreadful
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fingers
clutched
the
clothes
,
and
gathered
them
over
her
eyes
.
I
*NL*
attempted
to
steal
to
the
door
with
an
intention
of
calling
her
husband
;
*NL*
but
I
was
summoned
back
by
a
piercing
shriek
--
the
shawl
had
dropped
from
*NL*
the
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
is
the
matter
?
'
cried
I.
`
Who
is
coward
now
?
Wake
up
!
That
*NL*
is
the
glass
--
the
mirror
,
Mrs.
Linton
;
and
you
see
yourself
in
it
,
and
*NL*
there
am
I
too
by
your
side
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Trembling
and
bewildered
,
she
held
me
fast
,
but
the
horror
gradually
*NL*
passed
from
her
countenance
;
its
paleness
gave
place
to
a
glow
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
dear
!
I
thought
I
was
at
home
,
'
she
sighed
.
'
I
thought
I
was
lying
*NL*
in
my
chamber
at
Wuthering
Heights
.
Because
I
'm
weak
,
my
brain
got
*NL*
confused
,
and
I
screamed
unconsciously
.
Do
n't
say
anything
;
but
stay
*NL*
with
me
.
I
dread
sleeping
:
my
dreams
appal
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
sound
sleep
would
do
you
good
,
ma'am
,
'
I
answered
:
`
and
I
hope
this
*NL*
suffering
will
prevent
your
trying
starving
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
if
I
were
but
in
my
own
bed
in
the
old
house
!
'
she
went
on
bitterly
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
.
`
And
that
wind
sounding
in
the
firs
by
the
lattice
.
*NL*
Do
let
me
feel
it
--
it
comes
straight
down
the
moor
--
do
let
me
have
one
*NL*
breath
!
'
To
pacify
her
I
held
the
casement
ajar
a
few
seconds
.
A
cold
*NL*
blast
rushed
through
;
I
closed
it
,
and
returned
to
my
post
.
She
lay
*NL*
still
now
,
her
face
bathed
in
tears
.
Exhaustion
of
body
had
entirely
*NL*
subdued
her
spirit
:
our
fiery
Catherine
was
no
better
than
a
wailing
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long
is
it
since
I
shut
myself
in
here
?
'
she
asked
,
suddenly
*NL*
reviving
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
Monday
evening
,
'
I
replied
,
`
and
this
is
Thursday
night
,
or
*NL*
rather
Friday
morning
,
at
present
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
of
the
same
week
?
'
she
exclaimed
.
`
Only
that
brief
time
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Long
enough
to
live
on
nothing
but
cold
water
and
ill-temper
,
'
observed
*NL*
I.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
it
seems
a
weary
number
of
hours
,
'
she
muttered
doubtfully
:
`
it
*NL*
must
be
more
.
I
remember
being
in
the
parlour
after
they
had
quarrelled
,
*NL*
and
Edgar
being
cruelly
provoking
,
and
me
running
into
this
room
*NL*
desperate
.
As
soon
as
ever
I
had
barred
the
door
,
utter
blackness
*NL*
overwhelmed
me
,
and
I
fell
on
the
floor
.
I
could
n't
explain
to
Edgar
how
*NL*
certain
I
felt
of
having
a
fit
,
or
going
raging
mad
,
if
he
persisted
in
*NL*
teasing
me
!
I
had
no
command
of
tongue
,
or
brain
,
and
he
did
not
guess
*NL*
my
agony
,
perhaps
:
it
barely
left
me
sense
to
try
to
escape
from
him
and
*NL*
his
voice
.
Before
I
recovered
sufficiently
to
see
and
hear
,
it
began
to
*NL*
be
dawn
,
and
,
Nelly
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
thought
,
and
what
has
kept
*NL*
recurring
and
recurring
till
I
feared
for
my
reason
.
I
thought
as
I
lay
*NL*
there
,
with
my
head
against
that
table
leg
,
and
my
eyes
dimly
discerning
*NL*
the
grey
square
of
the
window
,
that
I
was
enclosed
in
the
oak-panelled
*NL*
bed
at
home
;
and
my
heart
ached
with
some
great
grief
which
,
just
*NL*
waking
,
I
could
not
recollect
.
I
pondered
,
and
worried
myself
to
*NL*
discover
what
it
could
be
,
and
,
most
strangely
,
the
whole
last
seven
*NL*
years
of
my
life
grew
a
blank
!
I
did
not
recall
that
they
had
been
at
*NL*
all
.
I
was
a
child
;
my
father
was
just
buried
,
and
my
misery
arose
from
*NL*
the
separation
that
Hindley
had
ordered
between
me
and
Heathcliff
.
I
was
*NL*
laid
alone
,
for
the
first
time
;
and
,
rousing
from
a
dismal
doze
after
a
*NL*
night
of
weeping
,
I
lifted
my
hand
to
push
the
panels
aside
:
it
struck
*NL*
the
table-top
!
I
swept
it
along
the
carpet
,
and
then
memory
burst
in
:
my
*NL*
late
anguish
was
swallowed
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
.
I
can
not
say
why
I
*NL*
felt
so
wildly
wretched
:
it
must
have
been
temporary
derangement
;
for
*NL*
there
is
scarcely
cause
.
But
,
supposing
at
twelve
years
old
I
had
been
*NL*
wrenched
from
the
Heights
,
and
every
early
association
,
and
my
all
in
*NL*
all
,
as
Heathcliff
was
at
that
time
,
and
been
converted
at
a
stroke
into
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
,
the
lady
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
the
wife
of
a
stranger
:
*NL*
an
exile
,
and
outcast
,
thenceforth
,
from
what
had
been
my
world
.
You
may
*NL*
fancy
a
glimpse
of
the
abyss
where
I
grovelled
!
Shake
your
head
as
you
*NL*
will
,
Nelly
,
you
have
helped
to
unsettle
me
!
You
should
have
spoken
to
*NL*
Edgar
,
indeed
you
should
,
and
compelled
him
to
leave
me
quiet
!
Oh
,
I
'm
*NL*
burning
!
I
wish
I
were
out
of
doors
!
I
wish
I
were
a
girl
again
,
half
*NL*
savage
and
hardy
,
and
free
;
and
laughing
at
injuries
,
not
maddening
*NL*
under
them
!
Why
am
I
so
changed
?
why
does
my
blood
rush
into
a
hell
of
*NL*
tumult
at
a
few
words
?
I
'm
sure
I
should
be
myself
were
I
once
among
the
*NL*
heather
on
those
hills
.
Open
the
window
again
wide
:
fasten
it
open
!
*NL*
Quick
,
why
do
n't
you
move
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
I
wo
n't
give
you
your
death
of
cold
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
give
me
a
chance
of
life
,
you
mean
,
'
she
said
,
sullenly
.
*NL*
`
However
,
I
'm
not
helpless
yet
;
I
'll
open
it
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
sliding
from
the
bed
before
I
could
hinder
her
,
she
crossed
the
room
,
*NL*
walking
very
uncertainly
,
threw
it
back
,
and
bent
out
,
careless
of
the
*NL*
frosty
air
that
cut
about
her
shoulders
as
keen
as
a
knife
.
I
entreated
,
*NL*
and
finally
attempted
to
force
her
to
retire
.
But
I
soon
found
her
*NL*
delirious
strength
much
surpassed
mine
-LRB-
she
was
delirious
,
I
became
*NL*
convinced
by
her
subsequent
actions
and
ravings
-RRB-
.
There
was
no
moon
,
and
*NL*
everything
beneath
lay
in
misty
darkness
:
not
a
light
gleamed
from
any
*NL*
house
,
far
or
near
all
had
been
extinguished
long
ago
:
and
those
at
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
were
never
visible
--
still
she
asserted
she
caught
their
*NL*
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
!
'
she
cried
eagerly
,
`
that
's
my
room
with
the
candle
in
it
,
and
the
*NL*
trees
swaying
before
it
;
and
the
other
candle
is
in
Joseph
's
garret
.
*NL*
Joseph
sits
up
late
,
does
n't
he
?
He
's
waiting
till
I
come
home
that
he
*NL*
may
lock
the
gate
.
Well
,
he
'll
wait
a
while
yet
.
It
's
a
rough
journey
,
*NL*
and
a
sad
heart
to
travel
it
;
and
we
must
pass
by
Gimmerton
Kirk
to
go
*NL*
that
journey
!
We
've
braved
its
ghosts
often
together
,
and
dared
each
*NL*
other
to
stand
among
the
graves
and
ask
them
to
come
.
But
,
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
if
I
dare
you
now
,
will
you
venture
?
If
you
do
,
I
'll
keep
you
.
I
'll
not
*NL*
lie
there
by
myself
:
they
may
bury
me
twelve
feet
deep
,
and
throw
the
*NL*
church
down
over
me
,
but
I
wo
n't
rest
till
you
are
with
me
.
I
never
*NL*
will
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
resumed
with
a
strange
smile
.
`
He
's
considering
--
he
'd
*NL*
rather
I
'd
come
to
him
!
Find
a
way
,
then
!
not
through
that
kirkyard
.
You
*NL*
are
slow
!
Be
content
,
you
always
followed
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
it
vain
to
argue
against
her
insanity
,
I
was
planning
how
I
*NL*
could
reach
something
to
wrap
about
her
,
without
quitting
my
hold
of
*NL*
herself
-LRB-
for
I
could
not
trust
her
alone
by
the
gaping
lattice
-RRB-
,
when
,
to
*NL*
my
consternation
,
I
heard
the
rattle
of
the
door-handle
,
and
Mr.
Linton
*NL*
entered
.
He
had
only
then
come
from
the
library
;
and
,
in
passing
through
*NL*
the
lobby
,
had
noticed
our
talking
and
been
attracted
by
curiosity
,
or
*NL*
fear
,
to
examine
what
it
signified
,
at
that
late
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
sir
!
'
I
cried
,
checking
the
exclamation
risen
to
his
lips
at
the
*NL*
sight
which
met
him
,
and
the
bleak
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
.
`
My
poor
*NL*
mistress
is
ill
,
and
she
quite
masters
me
:
I
can
not
manage
her
at
all
;
*NL*
pray
,
come
and
persuade
her
to
go
to
bed
.
Forget
your
anger
,
for
she
's
*NL*
hard
to
guide
any
way
but
her
own
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
ill
?
'
he
said
,
hastening
to
us
.
`
Shut
the
window
,
Ellen
!
*NL*
Catherine
!
why
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
The
haggardness
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
appearance
smote
him
*NL*
speechless
,
and
he
could
only
glance
from
her
to
me
in
horrified
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
been
fretting
here
,
'
I
continued
,
`
and
eating
scarcely
anything
,
*NL*
and
never
complaining
:
she
would
admit
none
of
us
till
this
evening
,
and
*NL*
so
we
could
n't
inform
you
of
her
state
,
as
we
were
not
aware
of
it
*NL*
ourselves
;
but
it
is
nothing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
I
uttered
my
explanations
awkwardly
;
the
master
frowned
.
`
It
is
*NL*
nothing
,
is
it
,
Ellen
Dean
?
'
he
said
sternly
.
`
You
shall
account
more
*NL*
clearly
for
keeping
me
ignorant
of
this
!
'
And
he
took
his
wife
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
looked
at
her
with
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
she
gave
him
no
glance
of
recognition
:
he
was
invisible
to
her
*NL*
abstracted
gaze
.
The
delirium
was
not
fixed
,
however
;
having
weaned
her
*NL*
eyes
from
contemplating
the
outer
darkness
,
by
degrees
she
centred
her
*NL*
attention
on
him
,
and
discovered
who
it
was
that
held
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
you
are
come
,
are
you
,
Edgar
Linton
?
'
she
said
,
with
angry
*NL*
animation
.
`
You
are
one
of
those
things
that
are
ever
found
when
least
*NL*
wanted
,
and
when
you
are
wanted
,
never
!
I
suppose
we
shall
have
plenty
*NL*
of
lamentations
now
--
I
see
we
shall
--
but
they
ca
n't
keep
me
from
my
*NL*
narrow
home
out
yonder
:
my
resting-place
,
where
I
'm
bound
before
spring
*NL*
is
over
!
There
it
is
:
not
among
the
Lintons
,
mind
,
under
the
*NL*
chapel-roof
,
but
in
the
open
air
,
with
a
head-stone
;
and
you
may
please
*NL*
yourself
whether
you
go
to
them
or
come
to
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
,
what
have
you
done
?
'
commenced
the
master
.
`
Am
I
nothing
to
*NL*
you
any
more
?
Do
you
love
that
wretch
Heath
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
!
'
cried
Mrs.
Linton
.
`
Hush
,
this
moment
!
You
mention
that
name
*NL*
and
I
end
the
matter
instantly
by
a
spring
from
the
window
!
What
you
*NL*
touch
at
present
you
may
have
;
but
my
soul
will
be
on
that
hill-top
*NL*
before
you
lay
hands
on
me
again
.
I
do
n't
want
you
,
Edgar
:
I
'm
past
*NL*
wanting
you
.
Return
to
your
books
.
I
'm
glad
you
possess
a
consolation
,
*NL*
for
all
you
had
in
me
is
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
mind
wanders
,
sir
,
'
I
interposed
.
`
She
has
been
talking
nonsense
*NL*
the
whole
evening
;
but
let
her
have
quiet
,
and
proper
attendance
,
and
*NL*
she
'll
rally
.
Hereafter
,
we
must
be
cautious
how
we
vex
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
desire
no
further
advice
from
you
,
'
answered
Mr.
Linton
.
`
You
knew
*NL*
your
mistress
's
nature
,
and
you
encouraged
me
to
harass
her
.
And
not
to
*NL*
give
me
one
hint
of
how
she
has
been
these
three
days
!
It
was
heartless
!
*NL*
Months
of
sickness
could
not
cause
such
a
change
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
defend
myself
,
thinking
it
too
bad
to
be
blamed
for
another
's
*NL*
wicked
waywardness
.
'
I
knew
Mrs.
Linton
's
nature
to
be
headstrong
and
*NL*
domineering
,
'
cried
I
:
`
but
I
did
n't
know
that
you
wished
to
foster
her
*NL*
fierce
temper
!
I
did
n't
know
that
,
to
humour
her
,
I
should
wink
at
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
I
performed
the
duty
of
a
faithful
servant
in
telling
you
,
*NL*
and
I
have
got
a
faithful
servant
's
wages
!
Well
,
it
will
teach
me
to
be
*NL*
careful
next
time
.
Next
time
you
may
gather
intelligence
for
yourself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
next
time
you
bring
a
tale
to
me
you
shall
quit
my
service
,
Ellen
*NL*
Dean
,
'
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
rather
hear
nothing
about
it
,
I
suppose
,
then
,
Mr.
Linton
?
'
said
*NL*
I.
`
Heathcliff
has
your
permission
to
come
a-courting
to
Miss
,
and
to
*NL*
drop
in
at
every
opportunity
your
absence
offers
,
on
purpose
to
poison
*NL*
the
mistress
against
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Confused
as
Catherine
was
,
her
wits
were
alert
at
applying
our
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
Nelly
has
played
traitor
,
'
she
exclaimed
,
passionately
.
`
Nelly
is
*NL*
my
hidden
enemy
.
You
witch
!
So
you
do
seek
elf-bolts
to
hurt
us
!
Let
*NL*
me
go
,
and
I
'll
make
her
rue
!
I
'll
make
her
howl
a
recantation
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
maniac
's
fury
kindled
under
her
brows
;
she
struggled
desperately
to
*NL*
disengage
herself
from
Linton
's
arms
.
I
felt
no
inclination
to
tarry
the
*NL*
event
;
and
,
resolving
to
seek
medical
aid
on
my
own
responsibility
,
I
*NL*
quitted
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
passing
the
garden
to
reach
the
road
,
at
a
place
where
a
bridle
hook
*NL*
is
driven
into
the
wall
,
I
saw
something
white
moved
irregularly
,
*NL*
evidently
by
another
agent
than
the
wind
.
Notwithstanding
my
hurry
,
I
*NL*
stayed
to
examine
it
,
lest
ever
after
I
should
have
the
conviction
*NL*
impressed
on
my
imagination
that
it
was
a
creature
of
the
other
world
.
My
*NL*
surprise
and
perplexity
were
great
on
discovering
,
by
touch
more
than
*NL*
vision
,
Miss
Isabella
's
springer
,
Fanny
,
suspended
by
a
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
nearly
at
its
last
gasp
.
I
quickly
released
the
animal
,
and
lifted
it
*NL*
into
the
garden
.
I
had
seen
it
follow
its
mistress
up-stairs
when
she
*NL*
went
to
bed
;
and
wondered
much
how
it
could
have
got
out
there
,
and
what
*NL*
mischievous
person
had
treated
it
so
.
While
untying
the
knot
round
the
*NL*
hook
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
repeatedly
caught
the
beat
of
horses
'
feet
*NL*
galloping
at
some
distance
;
but
there
were
such
a
number
of
things
to
*NL*
occupy
my
reflections
that
I
hardly
gave
the
circumstance
a
thought
:
*NL*
though
it
was
a
strange
sound
,
in
that
place
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kenneth
was
fortunately
just
issuing
from
his
house
to
see
a
patient
*NL*
in
the
village
as
I
came
up
the
street
;
and
my
account
of
Catherine
*NL*
Linton
's
malady
induced
him
to
accompany
me
back
immediately
.
He
was
a
*NL*
plain
rough
man
;
and
he
made
no
scruple
to
speak
his
doubts
of
her
*NL*
surviving
this
second
attack
;
unless
she
were
more
submissive
to
his
*NL*
directions
than
she
had
shown
herself
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nelly
Dean
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
ca
n't
help
fancying
there
's
an
extra
cause
for
*NL*
this
.
What
has
there
been
to
do
at
the
Grange
?
We
've
odd
reports
up
*NL*
here
.
A
stout
,
hearty
lass
like
Catherine
does
not
fall
ill
for
a
*NL*
trifle
;
and
that
sort
of
people
should
not
either
.
It
's
hard
work
*NL*
bringing
them
through
fevers
,
and
such
things
.
How
did
it
begin
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
master
will
inform
you
,
'
I
answered
;
`
but
you
are
acquainted
with
*NL*
the
Earnshaws
'
violent
dispositions
,
and
Mrs.
Linton
caps
them
all
.
I
*NL*
may
say
this
;
it
commenced
in
a
quarrel
.
She
was
struck
during
a
tempest
*NL*
of
passion
with
a
kind
of
fit
.
That
's
her
account
,
at
least
:
for
she
*NL*
flew
off
in
the
height
of
it
,
and
locked
herself
up
.
Afterwards
,
she
*NL*
refused
to
eat
,
and
now
she
alternately
raves
and
remains
in
a
half
*NL*
dream
;
knowing
those
about
her
,
but
having
her
mind
filled
with
all
sorts
*NL*
of
strange
ideas
and
illusions
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Linton
will
be
sorry
?
'
observed
Kenneth
,
interrogatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sorry
?
he
'll
break
his
heart
should
anything
happen
!
'
I
replied
.
`
Do
n't
*NL*
alarm
him
more
than
necessary
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
told
him
to
beware
,
'
said
my
companion
;
`
and
he
must
bide
the
*NL*
consequences
of
neglecting
my
warning
!
Has
n't
he
been
intimate
with
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
lately
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
frequently
visits
at
the
Grange
,
'
answered
I
,
`
though
more
on
*NL*
the
strength
of
the
mistress
having
known
him
when
a
boy
,
than
because
*NL*
the
master
likes
his
company
.
At
present
he
's
discharged
from
the
*NL*
trouble
of
calling
;
owing
to
some
presumptuous
aspirations
after
Miss
*NL*
Linton
which
he
manifested
.
I
hardly
think
he
'll
be
taken
in
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
does
Miss
Linton
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
him
?
'
was
the
doctor
's
next
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
in
her
confidence
,
'
returned
I
,
reluctant
to
continue
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
's
a
sly
one
,
'
he
remarked
,
shaking
his
head
.
`
She
keeps
her
own
*NL*
counsel
!
But
she
's
a
real
little
fool
.
I
have
it
from
good
authority
*NL*
that
last
night
-LRB-
and
a
pretty
night
it
was
!
-RRB-
she
and
Heathcliff
were
*NL*
walking
in
the
plantation
at
the
back
of
your
house
above
two
hours
;
and
*NL*
he
pressed
her
not
to
go
in
again
,
but
just
mount
his
horse
and
away
with
*NL*
him
!
My
informant
said
she
could
only
put
him
off
by
pledging
her
word
*NL*
of
honour
to
be
prepared
on
their
first
meeting
after
that
:
when
it
was
*NL*
to
be
he
did
n't
hear
;
but
you
urge
Mr.
Linton
to
look
sharp
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
news
filled
me
with
fresh
fears
;
I
outstripped
Kenneth
,
and
ran
most
*NL*
of
the
way
back
.
The
little
dog
was
yelping
in
the
garden
yet
.
I
spared
*NL*
a
minute
to
open
the
gate
for
it
,
but
instead
of
going
to
the
house
door
,
*NL*
it
coursed
up
and
down
snuffing
the
grass
,
and
would
have
escaped
to
the
*NL*
road
,
had
I
not
seized
it
and
conveyed
it
in
with
me
.
On
ascending
to
*NL*
Isabella
's
room
,
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
:
it
was
empty
.
Had
I
been
*NL*
a
few
hours
sooner
Mrs.
Linton
's
illness
might
have
arrested
her
rash
*NL*
step
.
But
what
could
be
done
now
?
There
was
a
bare
possibility
of
*NL*
overtaking
them
if
pursued
instantly
.
_
I
_
could
not
pursue
them
,
*NL*
however
;
and
I
dared
not
rouse
the
family
,
and
fill
the
place
with
*NL*
confusion
;
still
less
unfold
the
business
to
my
master
,
absorbed
as
he
*NL*
was
in
his
present
calamity
,
and
having
no
heart
to
spare
for
a
second
*NL*
grief
!
I
saw
nothing
for
it
but
to
hold
my
tongue
,
and
suffer
matters
to
*NL*
take
their
course
;
and
Kenneth
being
arrived
,
I
went
with
a
badly
*NL*
composed
countenance
to
announce
him
.
Catherine
lay
in
a
troubled
sleep
:
*NL*
her
husband
had
succeeded
in
soothing
the
excess
of
frenzy
;
he
now
hung
*NL*
over
her
pillow
,
watching
every
shade
and
every
change
of
her
painfully
*NL*
expressive
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
on
examining
the
case
for
himself
,
spoke
hopefully
to
him
of
*NL*
its
having
a
favourable
termination
,
if
we
could
only
preserve
around
her
*NL*
perfect
and
constant
tranquillity
.
To
me
,
he
signified
the
threatening
*NL*
danger
was
not
so
much
death
,
as
permanent
alienation
of
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
close
my
eyes
that
night
,
nor
did
Mr.
Linton
:
indeed
,
we
never
*NL*
went
to
bed
;
and
the
servants
were
all
up
long
before
the
usual
hour
,
*NL*
moving
through
the
house
with
stealthy
tread
,
and
exchanging
whispers
as
*NL*
they
encountered
each
other
in
their
vocations
.
Every
one
was
active
but
*NL*
Miss
Isabella
;
and
they
began
to
remark
how
sound
she
slept
:
her
brother
,
*NL*
too
,
asked
if
she
had
risen
,
and
seemed
impatient
for
her
presence
,
and
*NL*
hurt
that
she
showed
so
little
anxiety
for
her
sister-in-law
.
I
trembled
*NL*
lest
he
should
send
me
to
call
her
;
but
I
was
spared
the
pain
of
being
*NL*
the
first
proclaimant
of
her
flight
.
One
of
the
maids
,
a
thoughtless
*NL*
girl
,
who
had
been
on
an
early
errand
to
Gimmerton
,
came
panting
*NL*
up-stairs
,
open-mouthed
,
and
dashed
into
the
chamber
,
crying
:
`
Oh
,
dear
,
*NL*
dear
!
What
mun
we
have
next
?
Master
,
master
,
our
young
lady
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
your
noise
!
'
cried
,
I
hastily
,
enraged
at
her
clamorous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
lower
,
Mary
--
What
is
the
matter
?
'
said
Mr.
Linton
.
`
What
ails
*NL*
your
young
lady
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
gone
,
she
's
gone
!
Yon
'
Heathcliff
's
run
off
wi
'
her
!
'
gasped
the
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
not
true
!
'
exclaimed
Linton
,
rising
in
agitation
.
`
It
can
not
*NL*
be
:
how
has
the
idea
entered
your
head
?
Ellen
Dean
,
go
and
seek
her
.
It
*NL*
is
incredible
:
it
can
not
be
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
he
took
the
servant
to
the
door
,
and
then
repeated
his
demand
*NL*
to
know
her
reasons
for
such
an
assertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
met
on
the
road
a
lad
that
fetches
milk
here
,
'
she
stammered
,
*NL*
`
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
n't
in
trouble
at
the
Grange
.
I
thought
he
*NL*
meant
for
missis
's
sickness
,
so
I
answered
,
yes
.
Then
says
he
,
``
There
's
*NL*
somebody
gone
after
'em
,
I
guess
?
''
I
stared
.
He
saw
I
knew
nought
about
*NL*
it
,
and
he
told
how
a
gentleman
and
lady
had
stopped
to
have
a
horse
's
*NL*
shoe
fastened
at
a
blacksmith
's
shop
,
two
miles
out
of
Gimmerton
,
not
*NL*
very
long
after
midnight
!
and
how
the
blacksmith
's
lass
had
got
up
to
spy
*NL*
who
they
were
:
she
knew
them
both
directly
.
And
she
noticed
the
*NL*
man
--
Heathcliff
it
was
,
she
felt
certain
:
nob
`
dy
could
mistake
him
,
*NL*
besides
--
put
a
sovereign
in
her
father
's
hand
for
payment
.
The
lady
had
*NL*
a
cloak
about
her
face
;
but
having
desired
a
sup
of
water
,
while
she
*NL*
drank
it
fell
back
,
and
she
saw
her
very
plain
.
Heathcliff
held
both
*NL*
bridles
as
they
rode
on
,
and
they
set
their
faces
from
the
village
,
and
*NL*
went
as
fast
as
the
rough
roads
would
let
them
.
The
lass
said
nothing
to
*NL*
her
father
,
but
she
told
it
all
over
Gimmerton
this
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
and
peeped
,
for
form
's
sake
,
into
Isabella
's
room
;
confirming
,
when
*NL*
I
returned
,
the
servant
's
statement
.
Mr.
Linton
had
resumed
his
seat
by
*NL*
the
bed
;
on
my
re-entrance
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
read
the
meaning
of
my
*NL*
blank
aspect
,
and
dropped
them
without
giving
an
order
,
or
uttering
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
we
to
try
any
measures
for
overtaking
and
bringing
her
back
,
'
I
*NL*
inquired
.
`
How
should
we
do
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
went
of
her
own
accord
,
'
answered
the
master
;
`
she
had
a
right
to
go
*NL*
if
she
pleased
.
Trouble
me
no
more
about
her
.
Hereafter
she
is
only
my
*NL*
sister
in
name
:
not
because
I
disown
her
,
but
because
she
has
disowned
*NL*
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
all
he
said
on
the
subject
:
he
did
not
make
single
inquiry
*NL*
further
,
or
mention
her
in
any
way
,
except
directing
me
to
send
what
*NL*
property
she
had
in
the
house
to
her
fresh
home
,
wherever
it
was
,
when
I
*NL*
knew
it
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
months
the
fugitives
remained
absent
;
in
those
two
months
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
encountered
and
conquered
the
worst
shock
of
what
was
denominated
*NL*
a
brain
fever
.
No
mother
could
have
nursed
an
only
child
more
devotedly
*NL*
than
Edgar
tended
her
.
Day
and
night
he
was
watching
,
and
patiently
*NL*
enduring
all
the
annoyances
that
irritable
nerves
and
a
shaken
reason
*NL*
could
inflict
;
and
,
though
Kenneth
remarked
that
what
he
saved
from
the
*NL*
grave
would
only
recompense
his
care
by
forming
the
source
of
constant
*NL*
future
anxiety
--
in
fact
,
that
his
health
and
strength
were
being
*NL*
sacrificed
to
preserve
a
mere
ruin
of
humanity
--
he
knew
no
limits
in
*NL*
gratitude
and
joy
when
Catherine
's
life
was
declared
out
of
danger
;
and
*NL*
hour
after
hour
he
would
sit
beside
her
,
tracing
the
gradual
return
to
*NL*
bodily
health
,
and
flattering
his
too
sanguine
hopes
with
the
illusion
*NL*
that
her
mind
would
settle
back
to
its
right
balance
also
,
and
she
would
*NL*
soon
be
entirely
her
former
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
she
left
her
chamber
was
at
the
commencement
of
the
*NL*
following
March
.
Mr.
Linton
had
put
on
her
pillow
,
in
the
morning
,
a
*NL*
handful
of
golden
crocuses
;
her
eye
,
long
stranger
to
any
gleam
of
*NL*
pleasure
,
caught
them
in
waking
,
and
shone
delighted
as
she
gathered
them
*NL*
eagerly
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
These
are
the
earliest
flowers
at
the
Heights
,
'
she
exclaimed
.
`
They
*NL*
remind
me
of
soft
thaw
winds
,
and
warm
sunshine
,
and
nearly
melted
snow
.
*NL*
Edgar
,
is
there
not
a
south
wind
,
and
is
not
the
snow
almost
gone
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
snow
is
quite
gone
down
here
,
darling
,
'
replied
her
husband
;
`
and
I
*NL*
only
see
two
white
spots
on
the
whole
range
of
moors
:
the
sky
is
blue
,
*NL*
and
the
larks
are
singing
,
and
the
becks
and
brooks
are
all
brim
full
.
*NL*
Catherine
,
last
spring
at
this
time
,
I
was
longing
to
have
you
under
this
*NL*
roof
;
now
,
I
wish
you
were
a
mile
or
two
up
those
hills
:
the
air
blows
so
*NL*
sweetly
,
I
feel
that
it
would
cure
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
never
be
there
but
once
more
,
'
said
the
invalid
;
`
and
then
*NL*
you
'll
leave
me
,
and
I
shall
remain
for
ever
.
Next
spring
you
'll
long
*NL*
again
to
have
me
under
this
roof
,
and
you
'll
look
back
and
think
you
were
*NL*
happy
to-day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
lavished
on
her
the
kindest
caresses
,
and
tried
to
cheer
her
by
*NL*
the
fondest
words
;
but
,
vaguely
regarding
the
flowers
,
she
let
the
tears
*NL*
collect
on
her
lashes
and
stream
down
her
cheeks
unheeding
.
We
knew
she
*NL*
was
really
better
,
and
,
therefore
,
decided
that
long
confinement
to
a
*NL*
single
place
produced
much
of
this
despondency
,
and
it
might
be
partially
*NL*
removed
by
a
change
of
scene
.
The
master
told
me
to
light
a
fire
in
the
*NL*
many-weeks
'
deserted
parlour
,
and
to
set
an
easy-chair
in
the
sunshine
by
*NL*
the
window
;
and
then
he
brought
her
down
,
and
she
sat
a
long
while
*NL*
enjoying
the
genial
heat
,
and
,
as
we
expected
,
revived
by
the
objects
*NL*
round
her
:
which
,
though
familiar
,
were
free
from
the
dreary
associations
*NL*
investing
her
hated
sick
chamber
.
By
evening
she
seemed
greatly
*NL*
exhausted
;
yet
no
arguments
could
persuade
her
to
return
to
that
*NL*
apartment
,
and
I
had
to
arrange
the
parlour
sofa
for
her
bed
,
till
*NL*
another
room
could
be
prepared
.
To
obviate
the
fatigue
of
mounting
and
*NL*
descending
the
stairs
,
we
fitted
up
this
,
where
you
lie
at
present
--
on
*NL*
the
same
floor
with
the
parlour
;
and
she
was
soon
strong
enough
to
move
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
,
leaning
on
Edgar
's
arm
.
Ah
,
I
thought
myself
,
she
*NL*
might
recover
,
so
waited
on
as
she
was
.
And
there
was
double
cause
to
*NL*
desire
it
,
for
on
her
existence
depended
that
of
another
:
we
cherished
*NL*
the
hope
that
in
a
little
while
Mr.
Linton
's
heart
would
be
gladdened
,
*NL*
and
his
lands
secured
from
a
stranger
's
gripe
,
by
the
birth
of
an
heir
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
mention
that
Isabella
sent
to
her
brother
,
some
six
weeks
from
*NL*
her
departure
,
a
short
note
,
announcing
her
marriage
with
Heathcliff
.
It
*NL*
appeared
dry
and
cold
;
but
at
the
bottom
was
dotted
in
with
pencil
an
*NL*
obscure
apology
,
and
an
entreaty
for
kind
remembrance
and
reconciliation
,
*NL*
if
her
proceeding
had
offended
him
:
asserting
that
she
could
not
help
it
*NL*
then
,
and
being
done
,
she
had
now
no
power
to
repeal
it
.
Linton
did
not
*NL*
reply
to
this
,
I
believe
;
and
,
in
a
fortnight
more
,
I
got
a
long
letter
,
*NL*
which
I
considered
odd
,
coming
from
the
pen
of
a
bride
just
out
of
the
*NL*
honeymoon
.
I
'll
read
it
:
for
I
keep
it
yet
.
Any
relic
of
the
dead
is
*NL*
precious
,
if
they
were
valued
living
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
ELLEN
,
it
begins
,
--
I
came
last
night
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
*NL*
heard
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
Catherine
has
been
,
and
is
yet
,
very
ill
.
*NL*
I
must
not
write
to
her
,
I
suppose
,
and
my
brother
is
either
too
angry
or
*NL*
too
distressed
to
answer
what
I
sent
him
.
Still
,
I
must
write
to
*NL*
somebody
,
and
the
only
choice
left
me
is
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inform
Edgar
that
I
'd
give
the
world
to
see
his
face
again
--
that
my
heart
*NL*
returned
to
Thrushcross
Grange
in
twenty-four
hours
after
I
left
it
,
and
*NL*
is
there
at
this
moment
,
full
of
warm
feelings
for
him
,
and
Catherine
!
_
I
*NL*
ca
n't
follow
it
though
_
--
-LRB-
these
words
are
underlined
-RRB-
--
they
need
not
*NL*
expect
me
,
and
they
may
draw
what
conclusions
they
please
;
taking
care
,
*NL*
however
,
to
lay
nothing
at
the
door
of
my
weak
will
or
deficient
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remainder
of
the
letter
is
for
yourself
alone
.
I
want
to
ask
you
two
*NL*
questions
:
the
first
is
,
--
How
did
you
contrive
to
preserve
the
common
*NL*
sympathies
of
human
nature
when
you
resided
here
?
I
can
not
recognise
any
*NL*
sentiment
which
those
around
share
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
question
I
have
great
interest
in
;
it
is
this
--
Is
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
a
man
?
If
so
,
is
he
mad
?
And
if
not
,
is
he
a
devil
?
I
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
tell
my
reasons
for
making
this
inquiry
;
but
I
beseech
you
to
*NL*
explain
,
if
you
can
,
what
I
have
married
:
that
is
,
when
you
call
to
see
*NL*
me
;
and
you
must
call
,
Ellen
,
very
soon
.
Do
n't
write
,
but
come
,
and
*NL*
bring
me
something
from
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
you
shall
hear
how
I
have
been
received
in
my
new
home
,
as
I
am
led
*NL*
to
imagine
the
Heights
will
be
.
It
is
to
amuse
myself
that
I
dwell
on
*NL*
such
subjects
as
the
lack
of
external
comforts
:
they
never
occupy
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
except
at
the
moment
when
I
miss
them
.
I
should
laugh
and
*NL*
dance
for
joy
,
if
I
found
their
absence
was
the
total
of
my
miseries
,
and
*NL*
the
rest
was
an
unnatural
dream
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
set
behind
the
Grange
as
we
turned
on
to
the
moors
;
by
that
,
I
*NL*
judged
it
to
be
six
o'clock
;
and
my
companion
halted
half
an
hour
,
to
*NL*
inspect
the
park
,
and
the
gardens
,
and
,
probably
,
the
place
itself
,
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
;
so
it
was
dark
when
we
dismounted
in
the
paved
yard
of
*NL*
the
farm-house
,
and
your
old
fellow-servant
,
Joseph
,
issued
out
to
*NL*
receive
us
by
the
light
of
a
dip
candle
.
He
did
it
with
a
courtesy
that
*NL*
redounded
to
his
credit
.
His
first
act
was
to
elevate
his
torch
to
a
*NL*
level
with
my
face
,
squint
malignantly
,
project
his
under-lip
,
and
turn
*NL*
away
.
Then
he
took
the
two
horses
,
and
led
them
into
the
stables
;
*NL*
reappearing
for
the
purpose
of
locking
the
outer
gate
,
as
if
we
lived
in
*NL*
an
ancient
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
stayed
to
speak
to
him
,
and
I
entered
the
kitchen
--
a
dingy
,
*NL*
untidy
hole
;
I
daresay
you
would
not
know
it
,
it
is
so
changed
since
it
*NL*
was
in
your
charge
.
By
the
fire
stood
a
ruffianly
child
,
strong
in
limb
*NL*
and
dirty
in
garb
,
with
a
look
of
Catherine
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
*NL*
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
Edgar
's
legal
nephew
,
'
I
reflected
--
`
mine
in
a
manner
;
I
must
*NL*
shake
hands
,
and
--
yes
--
I
must
kiss
him
.
It
is
right
to
establish
a
good
*NL*
understanding
at
the
beginning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
approached
,
and
,
attempting
to
take
his
chubby
fist
,
said
--
`
How
do
you
*NL*
do
,
my
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
in
a
jargon
I
did
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Shall
you
and
I
be
friends
,
Hareton
?
'
was
my
next
essay
at
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
oath
,
and
a
threat
to
set
Throttler
on
me
if
I
did
not
`
frame
off
'
*NL*
rewarded
my
perseverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hey
,
Throttler
,
lad
!
'
whispered
the
little
wretch
,
rousing
a
half-bred
*NL*
bull-dog
from
its
lair
in
a
corner
.
`
Now
,
wilt
thou
be
ganging
?
'
he
*NL*
asked
authoritatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Love
for
my
life
urged
a
compliance
;
I
stepped
over
the
threshold
to
wait
*NL*
till
the
others
should
enter
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
nowhere
visible
;
and
*NL*
Joseph
,
whom
I
followed
to
the
stables
,
and
requested
to
accompany
me
in
,
*NL*
after
staring
and
muttering
to
himself
,
screwed
up
his
nose
and
*NL*
replied
--
`
Mim
!
mim
!
mim
!
Did
iver
Christian
body
hear
aught
like
it
?
*NL*
Mincing
un
'
munching
!
How
can
I
tell
whet
ye
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
I
wish
you
to
come
with
me
into
the
house
!
'
I
cried
,
thinking
him
*NL*
deaf
,
yet
highly
disgusted
at
his
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
o
'
me
!
I
getten
summut
else
to
do
,
'
he
answered
,
and
continued
his
*NL*
work
;
moving
his
lantern
jaws
meanwhile
,
and
surveying
my
dress
and
*NL*
countenance
-LRB-
the
former
a
great
deal
too
fine
,
but
the
latter
,
I
'm
sure
,
*NL*
as
sad
as
he
could
desire
-RRB-
with
sovereign
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
round
the
yard
,
and
through
a
wicket
,
to
another
door
,
at
which
*NL*
I
took
the
liberty
of
knocking
,
in
hopes
some
more
civil
servant
might
*NL*
show
himself
.
After
a
short
suspense
,
it
was
opened
by
a
tall
,
gaunt
*NL*
man
,
without
neckerchief
,
and
otherwise
extremely
slovenly
;
his
features
*NL*
were
lost
in
masses
of
shaggy
hair
that
hung
on
his
shoulders
;
and
_
his
_
*NL*
eyes
,
too
,
were
like
a
ghostly
Catherine
's
with
all
their
beauty
*NL*
annihilated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
your
business
here
?
'
he
demanded
,
grimly
.
`
Who
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
name
was
Isabella
Linton
,
'
I
replied
.
`
You
've
seen
me
before
,
sir
.
*NL*
I
'm
lately
married
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
has
brought
me
here
--
I
*NL*
suppose
,
by
your
permission
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
come
back
,
then
?
'
asked
the
hermit
,
glaring
like
a
hungry
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
--
we
came
just
now
,
'
I
said
;
`
but
he
left
me
by
the
kitchen
door
;
and
*NL*
when
I
would
have
gone
in
,
your
little
boy
played
sentinel
over
the
*NL*
place
,
and
frightened
me
off
by
the
help
of
a
bull-dog
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
well
the
hellish
villain
has
kept
his
word
!
'
growled
my
future
*NL*
host
,
searching
the
darkness
beyond
me
in
expectation
of
discovering
*NL*
Heathcliff
;
and
then
he
indulged
in
a
soliloquy
of
execrations
,
and
*NL*
threats
of
what
he
would
have
done
had
the
`
fiend
'
deceived
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
repented
having
tried
this
second
entrance
,
and
was
almost
inclined
to
*NL*
slip
away
before
he
finished
cursing
,
but
ere
I
could
execute
that
*NL*
intention
,
he
ordered
me
in
,
and
shut
and
re-fastened
the
door
.
There
*NL*
was
a
great
fire
,
and
that
was
all
the
light
in
the
huge
apartment
,
whose
*NL*
floor
had
grown
a
uniform
grey
;
and
the
once
brilliant
pewter-dishes
,
*NL*
which
used
to
attract
my
gaze
when
I
was
a
girl
,
partook
of
a
similar
*NL*
obscurity
,
created
by
tarnish
and
dust
.
I
inquired
whether
I
might
call
*NL*
the
maid
,
and
be
conducted
to
a
bedroom
!
Mr.
Earnshaw
vouchsafed
no
*NL*
answer
.
He
walked
up
and
down
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
apparently
*NL*
quite
forgetting
my
presence
;
and
his
abstraction
was
evidently
so
deep
,
*NL*
and
his
whole
aspect
so
misanthropical
,
that
I
shrank
from
disturbing
him
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
'll
not
be
surprised
,
Ellen
,
at
my
feeling
particularly
cheerless
,
*NL*
seated
in
worse
than
solitude
on
that
inhospitable
hearth
,
and
*NL*
remembering
that
four
miles
distant
lay
my
delightful
home
,
containing
*NL*
the
only
people
I
loved
on
earth
;
and
there
might
as
well
be
the
*NL*
Atlantic
to
part
us
,
instead
of
those
four
miles
:
I
could
not
overpass
*NL*
them
!
I
questioned
with
myself
--
where
must
I
turn
for
comfort
?
and
--
mind
*NL*
you
do
n't
tell
Edgar
,
or
Catherine
--
above
every
sorrow
beside
,
this
rose
*NL*
pre-eminent
:
despair
at
finding
nobody
who
could
or
would
be
my
ally
*NL*
against
Heathcliff
!
I
had
sought
shelter
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
almost
*NL*
gladly
,
because
I
was
secured
by
that
arrangement
from
living
alone
with
*NL*
him
;
but
he
knew
the
people
we
were
coming
amongst
,
and
he
did
not
fear
*NL*
their
intermeddling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
and
thought
a
doleful
time
:
the
clock
struck
eight
,
and
nine
,
and
*NL*
still
my
companion
paced
to
and
fro
,
his
head
bent
on
his
breast
,
and
*NL*
perfectly
silent
,
unless
a
groan
or
a
bitter
ejaculation
forced
itself
*NL*
out
at
intervals
.
I
listened
to
detect
a
woman
's
voice
in
the
house
,
and
*NL*
filled
the
interim
with
wild
regrets
and
dismal
anticipations
,
which
,
at
*NL*
last
,
spoke
audibly
in
irrepressible
sighing
and
weeping
.
I
was
not
*NL*
aware
how
openly
I
grieved
,
till
Earnshaw
halted
opposite
,
in
his
*NL*
measured
walk
,
and
gave
me
a
stare
of
newly-awakened
surprise
.
Taking
*NL*
advantage
of
his
recovered
attention
,
I
exclaimed
--
`
I
'm
tired
with
my
*NL*
journey
,
and
I
want
to
go
to
bed
!
Where
is
the
maid-servant
?
Direct
me
*NL*
to
her
,
as
she
wo
n't
come
to
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
have
none
,
'
he
answered
;
`
you
must
wait
on
yourself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
must
I
sleep
,
then
?
'
I
sobbed
;
I
was
beyond
regarding
*NL*
self-respect
,
weighed
down
by
fatigue
and
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Joseph
will
show
you
Heathcliff
's
chamber
,
'
said
he
;
`
open
that
*NL*
door
--
he
's
in
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
going
to
obey
,
but
he
suddenly
arrested
me
,
and
added
in
the
*NL*
strangest
tone
--
`
Be
so
good
as
to
turn
your
lock
,
and
draw
your
*NL*
bolt
--
do
n't
omit
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
'
I
said
.
`
But
why
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
?
'
I
did
not
relish
the
notion
of
*NL*
deliberately
fastening
myself
in
with
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
here
!
'
he
replied
,
pulling
from
his
waistcoat
a
*NL*
curiously-constructed
pistol
,
having
a
double-edged
spring
knife
attached
*NL*
to
the
barrel
.
`
That
's
a
great
tempter
to
a
desperate
man
,
is
it
not
?
I
*NL*
can
not
resist
going
up
with
this
every
night
,
and
trying
his
door
.
If
*NL*
once
I
find
it
open
he
's
done
for
;
I
do
it
invariably
,
even
though
the
*NL*
minute
before
I
have
been
recalling
a
hundred
reasons
that
should
make
me
*NL*
refrain
:
it
is
some
devil
that
urges
me
to
thwart
my
own
schemes
by
*NL*
killing
him
.
You
fight
against
that
devil
for
love
as
long
as
you
may
;
*NL*
when
the
time
comes
,
not
all
the
angels
in
heaven
shall
save
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
surveyed
the
weapon
inquisitively
.
A
hideous
notion
struck
me
:
how
*NL*
powerful
I
should
be
possessing
such
an
instrument
!
I
took
it
from
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
touched
the
blade
.
He
looked
astonished
at
the
expression
my
*NL*
face
assumed
during
a
brief
second
:
it
was
not
horror
,
it
was
*NL*
covetousness
.
He
snatched
the
pistol
back
,
jealously
;
shut
the
knife
,
*NL*
and
returned
it
to
its
concealment
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
care
if
you
tell
him
,
'
said
he
.
`
Put
him
on
his
guard
,
and
*NL*
watch
for
him
.
You
know
the
terms
we
are
on
,
I
see
:
his
danger
does
not
*NL*
shock
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
has
Heathcliff
done
to
you
?
'
I
asked
.
`
In
what
has
he
wronged
you
,
*NL*
to
warrant
this
appalling
hatred
?
Would
n't
it
be
wiser
to
bid
him
quit
*NL*
the
house
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
thundered
Earnshaw
;
`
should
he
offer
to
leave
me
,
he
's
a
dead
man
:
*NL*
persuade
him
to
attempt
it
,
and
you
are
a
murderess
!
Am
I
to
lose
_
all
_
,
*NL*
without
a
chance
of
retrieval
?
Is
Hareton
to
be
a
beggar
?
Oh
,
*NL*
damnation
!
I
_
will
_
have
it
back
;
and
I
'll
have
_
his
_
gold
too
;
and
then
*NL*
his
blood
;
and
hell
shall
have
his
soul
!
It
will
be
ten
times
blacker
*NL*
with
that
guest
than
ever
it
was
before
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
You
've
acquainted
me
,
Ellen
,
with
your
old
master
's
habits
.
He
is
*NL*
clearly
on
the
verge
of
madness
:
he
was
so
last
night
at
least
.
I
*NL*
shuddered
to
be
near
him
,
and
thought
on
the
servant
's
ill-bred
*NL*
moroseness
as
comparatively
agreeable
.
He
now
recommenced
his
moody
*NL*
walk
,
and
I
raised
the
latch
,
and
escaped
into
the
kitchen
.
Joseph
was
*NL*
bending
over
the
fire
,
peering
into
a
large
pan
that
swung
above
it
;
and
*NL*
a
wooden
bowl
of
oatmeal
stood
on
the
settle
close
by
.
The
contents
of
*NL*
the
pan
began
to
boil
,
and
he
turned
to
plunge
his
hand
into
the
bowl
;
I
*NL*
conjectured
that
this
preparation
was
probably
for
our
supper
,
and
,
being
*NL*
hungry
,
I
resolved
it
should
be
eatable
;
so
,
crying
out
sharply
,
'
_
I
'll
_
*NL*
make
the
porridge
!
'
I
removed
the
vessel
out
of
his
reach
,
and
proceeded
*NL*
to
take
off
my
hat
and
riding-habit
.
`
Mr.
Earnshaw
,
'
I
continued
,
*NL*
`
directs
me
to
wait
on
myself
:
I
will
.
I
'm
not
going
to
act
the
lady
*NL*
among
you
,
for
fear
I
should
starve
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gooid
Lord
!
'
he
muttered
,
sitting
down
,
and
stroking
his
ribbed
*NL*
stockings
from
the
knee
to
the
ankle
.
`
If
there
's
to
be
fresh
*NL*
ortherings
--
just
when
I
getten
used
to
two
maisters
,
if
I
mun
hev
'
a
*NL*
_
mistress
_
set
o'er
my
heead
,
it
's
like
time
to
be
flitting
.
I
niver
*NL*
_
did
_
think
to
see
t
'
day
that
I
mud
lave
th
'
owld
place
--
but
I
doubt
*NL*
it
's
nigh
at
hand
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
lamentation
drew
no
notice
from
me
:
I
went
briskly
to
work
,
sighing
*NL*
to
remember
a
period
when
it
would
have
been
all
merry
fun
;
but
compelled
*NL*
speedily
to
drive
off
the
remembrance
.
It
racked
me
to
recall
past
*NL*
happiness
and
the
greater
peril
there
was
of
conjuring
up
its
apparition
,
*NL*
the
quicker
the
thible
ran
round
,
and
the
faster
the
handfuls
of
meal
*NL*
fell
into
the
water
.
Joseph
beheld
my
style
of
cookery
with
growing
*NL*
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thear
!
'
he
ejaculated
.
`
Hareton
,
thou
will
n't
sup
thy
porridge
*NL*
to-neeght
;
they
'll
be
naught
but
lumps
as
big
as
my
neive
.
Thear
,
agean
!
*NL*
I
'd
fling

un

all

if
I
wer

There
,
pale
t
'
guilp
off

un
'
*NL*
then
ye
'll
hae
done
wi

`
t.
Bang
,
bang
.
It
's
a
mercy
t
'
bothom
is
n't
*NL*
deaved
out
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
rather
a
rough
mess
,
I
own
,
when
poured
into
the
basins
;
four
*NL*
had
been
provided
,
and
a
gallon
pitcher
of
new
milk
was
brought
from
the
*NL*
dairy
,
which
Hareton
seized
and
commenced
drinking
and
spilling
from
the
*NL*
expansive
lip
.
I
expostulated
,
and
desired
that
he
should
have
his
in
a
*NL*
mug
;
affirming
that
I
could
not
taste
the
liquid
treated
so
dirtily
.
The
*NL*
old
cynic
chose
to
be
vastly
offended
at
this
nicety
;
assuring
me
,
*NL*
repeatedly
,
that
`
the
barn
was
every
bit
as
good
'
as
I
,
`
and
every
bit
as
*NL*
wollsome
,
'
and
wondering
how
I
could
fashion
to
be
so
conceited
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
infant
ruffian
continued
sucking
;
and
glowered
up
at
me
*NL*
defyingly
,
as
he
slavered
into
the
jug
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
have
my
supper
in
another
room
,
'
I
said
.
`
Have
you
no
place
you
*NL*
call
a
parlour
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Parlour

!
'
he
echoed
,
sneeringly
,
'
_
parlour
_
!
Nay
,

've
noa

'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
shall
go
up-stairs
,
'
I
answered
;
`
show
me
a
chamber
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
my
basin
on
a
tray
,
and
went
myself
to
fetch
some
more
milk
.
With
*NL*
great
grumblings
,
the
fellow
rose
,
and
preceded
me
in
my
ascent
:
we
*NL*
mounted
to
the
garrets
;
he
opened
a
door
,
now
and
then
,
to
look
into
the
*NL*
apartments
we
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
's
a
rahm
,
'
he
said
,
at
last
,
flinging
back
a
cranky
board
on
*NL*
hinges
.
`
It
's
weel
eneugh
to
ate
a
few
porridge
in
.
There
's
a
pack
o

t

'
*NL*
*NL*
The
`
rahm
'
was
a
kind
of
lumber-hole
smelling
strong
of
malt
and
grain
;
*NL*
various
sacks
of
which
articles
were
piled
around
,
leaving
a
wide
,
bare
*NL*
space
in
the
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
man
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
facing
him
angrily
,
`
this
is
not
a
place
to
*NL*
sleep
in
.
I
wish
to
see
my
bed-room
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Bed-rume

!
'
he
repeated
,
in
a
tone
of
mockery
.
`
Yah

'
*NL*
_
bed-rumes

'
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
into
the
second
garret
,
only
differing
from
the
first
in
being
*NL*
more
naked
about
the
walls
,
and
having
a
large
,
low
,
curtainless
bed
,
*NL*
with
an
indigo-coloured
quilt
,
at
one
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
I
want
with
yours
?
'
I
retorted
.
'
I
suppose
Mr.
Heathcliff
does
*NL*
not
lodge
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
does
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
it
's
Maister
_
Hathecliff

'
cried
he
,
as
if
making
a
*NL*
new
discovery
.
`
Could
n't

said
soa
,

Joseph
,
'
I
could
not
refrain
from
observing
,
`
and
*NL*
pleasant
inmates
;
and
I
think
the
concentrated
essence
of
all
the
madness
*NL*
in
the
world
took
up
its
abode
in
my
brain
the
day
I
linked
my
fate
with
*NL*
theirs
!
However
,
that
is
not
to
the
present
purpose
--
there
are
other
*NL*
rooms
.
For
heaven
's
sake
be
quick
,
and
let

!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
to
this
adjuration
;
only
plodding
doggedly
down
the
*NL*
wooden
steps
,
and
halting
,
before
an
apartment
which
,
from
that
halt
and
*NL*
the
superior
quality
of
its
furniture
,
I
conjectured
to
be
the
best
one
.
*NL*
There
was
a
carpet
--
a
good
one
,
but
the
pattern
was
obliterated
by
dust
;
*NL*
a
fireplace
hung
with
cut-paper
,
dropping
to
pieces
;
a
handsome
*NL*
oak-bedstead
with
ample
crimson
curtains
of
rather
expensive
material
and
*NL*
modern
make
;
but
they
had
evidently
experienced
rough
usage
:
the
*NL*
vallances
hung
in
festoons
,
wrenched
from
their
rings
,
and
the
iron
rod
*NL*
supporting
them
was
bent
in
an
arc
on
one
side
,
causing
the
drapery
to
*NL*
trail
upon
the
floor
.
The
chairs
were
also
damaged
,
many
of
them
*NL*
severely
;
and
deep
indentations
deformed
the
panels
of
the
walls
.
I
was
*NL*
endeavouring
to
gather
resolution
for
entering
and
taking
possession
,
*NL*
when
my
fool
of
a
guide
announced
,
--
`
This
here
is
t
'
maister
's
.
'
My
*NL*
supper
by
this
time
was
cold
,
my
appetite
gone
,
and
my
patience
*NL*
exhausted
.
I
insisted
on
being
provided
instantly
with
a
place
of
*NL*
refuge
,
and
means
of
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whear

'
began
the
religious
elder
.
`
The

'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
vexed
,
I
flung
my
tray
and
its
contents
on
the
ground
;
and
then
*NL*
seated
myself
at
the
stairs
'
-
head
,
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
,
and
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ech

exclaimed
Joseph
.
`

But

'
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
went
on
scolding
to
his
den
beneath
,
taking
the
candle
with
*NL*
him
;
and
I
remained
in
the
dark
.
The
period
of
reflection
succeeding
*NL*
this
silly
action
compelled
me
to
admit
the
necessity
of
smothering
my
*NL*
pride
and
choking
my
wrath
,
and
bestirring
myself
to
remove
its
effects
.
*NL*
An
unexpected
aid
presently
appeared
in
the
shape
of
Throttler
,
whom
I
*NL*
now
recognised
as
a
son
of
our
old
Skulker
:
it
had
spent
its
whelphood
*NL*
at
the
Grange
,
and
was
given
by
my
father
to
Mr.
Hindley
.
I
fancy
it
*NL*
knew
me
:
it
pushed
its
nose
against
mine
by
way
of
salute
,
and
then
*NL*
hastened
to
devour
the
porridge
;
while
I
groped
from
step
to
step
,
*NL*
collecting
the
shattered
earthenware
,
and
drying
the
spatters
of
milk
*NL*
from
the
banister
with
my
pocket-handkerchief
.
Our
labours
were
scarcely
*NL*
over
when
I
heard
Earnshaw
's
tread
in
the
passage
;
my
assistant
tucked
*NL*
in
his
tail
,
and
pressed
to
the
wall
;
I
stole
into
the
nearest
doorway
.
*NL*
The
dog
's
endeavour
to
avoid
him
was
unsuccessful
;
as
I
guessed
by
a
*NL*
scutter
down-stairs
,
and
a
prolonged
,
piteous
yelping
.
I
had
better
*NL*
luck
:
he
passed
on
,
entered
his
chamber
,
and
shut
the
door
.
Directly
*NL*
after
Joseph
came
up
with
Hareton
,
to
put
him
to
bed
.
I
had
found
*NL*
shelter
in
Hareton
's
room
,
and
the
old
man
,
on
seeing
me
,
said
,
--
`
They
's
*NL*
rahm
for
boath
ye
un
'
yer
pride
,
now
,
I
sud
think
i
'
the
hahse

It
's
*NL*
empty
;
ye
may
hev

it
all
to

,
un
'
Him
as
allus
maks
a
third
,
i
'
*NL*
sich
ill
company
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Gladly
did
I
take
advantage
of
this
intimation
;
and
the
minute
I
flung
*NL*
myself
into
a
chair
,
by
the
fire
,
I
nodded
,
and
slept
.
My
slumber
was
*NL*
deep
and
sweet
,
though
over
far
too
soon
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
awoke
me
;
he
*NL*
had
just
come
in
,
and
demanded
,
in
his
loving
manner
,
what
I
was
doing
*NL*
there
?
I
told
him
the
cause
of
my
staying
up
so
late
--
that
he
had
the
*NL*
key
of
our
room
in
his
pocket
.
The
adjective
_
our
_
gave
mortal
offence
.
*NL*
He
swore
it
was
not
,
nor
ever
should
be
,
mine
;
and
he
'd
--
but
I
'll
not
*NL*
repeat
his
language
,
nor
describe
his
habitual
conduct
:
he
is
ingenious
*NL*
and
unresting
in
seeking
to
gain
my
abhorrence
!
I
sometimes
wonder
at
*NL*
him
with
an
intensity
that
deadens
my
fear
:
yet
,
I
assure
you
,
a
tiger
or
*NL*
a
venomous
serpent
could
not
rouse
terror
in
me
equal
to
that
which
he
*NL*
wakens
.
He
told
me
of
Catherine
's
illness
,
and
accused
my
brother
of
*NL*
causing
it
promising
that
I
should
be
Edgar
's
proxy
in
suffering
,
till
he
*NL*
could
get
hold
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
hate
him
--
I
am
wretched
--
I
have
been
a
fool
!
Beware
of
uttering
one
*NL*
breath
of
this
to
any
one
at
the
Grange
.
I
shall
expect
you
every
*NL*
day
--
do
n't
disappoint
me
!

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
had
perused
this
epistle
I
went
to
the
master
,
and
informed
*NL*
him
that
his
sister
had
arrived
at
the
Heights
,
and
sent
me
a
letter
*NL*
expressing
her
sorrow
for
Mrs.
Linton
's
situation
,
and
her
ardent
desire
*NL*
to
see
him
;
with
a
wish
that
he
would
transmit
to
her
,
as
early
as
*NL*
possible
,
some
token
of
forgiveness
by
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Forgiveness
!
'
said
Linton
.
'
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
her
,
Ellen
.
You
*NL*
may
call
at
Wuthering
Heights
this
afternoon
,
if
you
like
,
and
say
that
I
*NL*
am
not
angry
,
but
I
'm
sorry
to
have
lost
her
;
especially
as
I
can
never
*NL*
think
she
'll
be
happy
.
It
is
out
of
the
question
my
going
to
see
her
,
*NL*
however
:
we
are
eternally
divided
;
and
should
she
really
wish
to
oblige
*NL*
me
,
let
her
persuade
the
villain
she
has
married
to
leave
the
country
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
wo
n't
write
her
a
little
note
,
sir
?
'
I
asked
,
imploringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
he
answered
.
`
It
is
needless
.
My
communication
with
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
family
shall
be
as
sparing
as
his
with
mine
.
It
shall
not
exist
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Edgar
's
coldness
depressed
me
exceedingly
;
and
all
the
way
from
the
*NL*
Grange
I
puzzled
my
brains
how
to
put
more
heart
into
what
he
said
,
when
*NL*
I
repeated
it
;
and
how
to
soften
his
refusal
of
even
a
few
lines
to
*NL*
console
Isabella
.
I
daresay
she
had
been
on
the
watch
for
me
since
*NL*
morning
:
I
saw
her
looking
through
the
lattice
as
I
came
up
the
garden
*NL*
causeway
,
and
I
nodded
to
her
;
but
she
drew
back
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
*NL*
observed
.
I
entered
without
knocking
.
There
never
was
such
a
dreary
,
*NL*
dismal
scene
as
the
formerly
cheerful
house
presented
!
I
must
confess
,
*NL*
that
if
I
had
been
in
the
young
lady
's
place
,
I
would
,
at
least
,
have
*NL*
swept
the
hearth
,
and
wiped
the
tables
with
a
duster
.
But
she
already
*NL*
partook
of
the
pervading
spirit
of
neglect
which
encompassed
her
.
Her
*NL*
pretty
face
was
wan
and
listless
;
her
hair
uncurled
:
some
locks
hanging
*NL*
lankly
down
,
and
some
carelessly
twisted
round
her
head
.
Probably
she
*NL*
had
not
touched
her
dress
since
yester
evening
.
Hindley
was
not
there
.
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
sat
at
a
table
,
turning
over
some
papers
in
his
*NL*
pocket-book
;
but
he
rose
when
I
appeared
,
asked
me
how
I
did
,
quite
*NL*
friendly
,
and
offered
me
a
chair
.
He
was
the
only
thing
there
that
*NL*
seemed
decent
;
and
I
thought
he
never
looked
better
.
So
much
had
*NL*
circumstances
altered
their
positions
,
that
he
would
certainly
have
*NL*
struck
a
stranger
as
a
born
and
bred
gentleman
;
and
his
wife
as
a
*NL*
thorough
little
slattern
!
She
came
forward
eagerly
to
greet
me
,
and
held
*NL*
out
one
hand
to
take
the
expected
letter
.
I
shook
my
head
.
She
would
n't
*NL*
understand
the
hint
,
but
followed
me
to
a
sideboard
,
where
I
went
to
lay
*NL*
my
bonnet
,
and
importuned
me
in
a
whisper
to
give
her
directly
what
I
*NL*
had
brought
.
Heathcliff
guessed
the
meaning
of
her
manoeuvres
,
and
*NL*
said
--
`
If
you
have
got
anything
for
Isabella
-LRB-
as
no
doubt
you
have
,
*NL*
Nelly
-RRB-
,
give
it
to
her
.
You
need
n't
make
a
secret
of
it
:
we
have
no
*NL*
secrets
between
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
have
nothing
,
'
I
replied
,
thinking
it
best
to
speak
the
truth
at
*NL*
once
.
`
My
master
bid
me
tell
his
sister
that
she
must
not
expect
either
*NL*
a
letter
or
a
visit
from
him
at
present
.
He
sends
his
love
,
ma'am
,
and
*NL*
his
wishes
for
your
happiness
,
and
his
pardon
for
the
grief
you
have
*NL*
occasioned
;
but
he
thinks
that
after
this
time
his
household
and
the
*NL*
household
here
should
drop
intercommunication
,
as
nothing
could
come
of
*NL*
keeping
it
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
lip
quivered
slightly
,
and
she
returned
to
her
seat
in
*NL*
the
window
.
Her
husband
took
his
stand
on
the
hearthstone
,
near
me
,
and
*NL*
began
to
put
questions
concerning
Catherine
.
I
told
him
as
much
as
I
*NL*
thought
proper
of
her
illness
,
and
he
extorted
from
me
,
by
*NL*
cross-examination
,
most
of
the
facts
connected
with
its
origin
.
I
blamed
*NL*
her
,
as
she
deserved
,
for
bringing
it
all
on
herself
;
and
ended
by
hoping
*NL*
that
he
would
follow
Mr.
Linton
's
example
and
avoid
future
interference
*NL*
with
his
family
,
for
good
or
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Linton
is
now
just
recovering
,
'
I
said
;
`
she
'll
never
be
like
she
*NL*
was
,
but
her
life
is
spared
;
and
if
you
really
have
a
regard
for
her
,
*NL*
you
'll
shun
crossing
her
way
again
:
nay
,
you
'll
move
out
of
this
country
*NL*
entirely
;
and
that
you
may
not
regret
it
,
I
'll
inform
you
Catherine
*NL*
Linton
is
as
different
now
from
your
old
friend
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
as
*NL*
that
young
lady
is
different
from
me
.
Her
appearance
is
changed
greatly
,
*NL*
her
character
much
more
so
;
and
the
person
who
is
compelled
,
of
*NL*
necessity
,
to
be
her
companion
,
will
only
sustain
his
affection
hereafter
*NL*
by
the
remembrance
of
what
she
once
was
,
by
common
humanity
,
and
a
sense
*NL*
of
duty
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
quite
possible
,
'
remarked
Heathcliff
,
forcing
himself
to
seem
*NL*
calm
:
`
quite
possible
that
your
master
should
have
nothing
but
common
*NL*
humanity
and
a
sense
of
duty
to
fall
back
upon
.
But
do
you
imagine
that
*NL*
I
shall
leave
Catherine
to
his
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
?
and
can
you
compare
*NL*
my
feelings
respecting
Catherine
to
his
?
Before
you
leave
this
house
,
I
*NL*
must
exact
a
promise
from
you
that
you
'll
get
me
an
interview
with
her
:
*NL*
consent
,
or
refuse
,
I
_
will
_
see
her
!
What
do
you
say
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
I
replied
,
`
you
must
not
:
you
never
shall
,
*NL*
through
my
means
.
Another
encounter
between
you
and
the
master
would
*NL*
kill
her
altogether
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
your
aid
that
may
be
avoided
,
'
he
continued
;
`
and
should
there
be
*NL*
danger
of
such
an
event
--
should
he
be
the
cause
of
adding
a
single
*NL*
trouble
more
to
her
existence
--
why
,
I
think
I
shall
be
justified
in
going
*NL*
to
extremes
!
I
wish
you
had
sincerity
enough
to
tell
me
whether
*NL*
Catherine
would
suffer
greatly
from
his
loss
:
the
fear
that
she
would
*NL*
restrains
me
.
And
there
you
see
the
distinction
between
our
feelings
:
*NL*
had
he
been
in
my
place
,
and
I
in
his
,
though
I
hated
him
with
a
hatred
*NL*
that
turned
my
life
to
gall
,
I
never
would
have
raised
a
hand
against
*NL*
him
.
You
may
look
incredulous
,
if
you
please
!
I
never
would
have
*NL*
banished
him
from
her
society
as
long
as
she
desired
his
.
The
moment
her
*NL*
regard
ceased
,
I
would
have
torn
his
heart
out
,
and
drunk
his
blood
!
But
,
*NL*
till
then
--
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
you
do
n't
know
me
--
till
then
,
I
would
*NL*
have
died
by
inches
before
I
touched
a
single
hair
of
his
head
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
yet
,
'
I
interrupted
,
`
you
have
no
scruples
in
completely
ruining
all
*NL*
hopes
of
her
perfect
restoration
,
by
thrusting
yourself
into
her
*NL*
remembrance
now
,
when
she
has
nearly
forgotten
you
,
and
involving
her
in
*NL*
a
new
tumult
of
discord
and
distress
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
suppose
she
has
nearly
forgotten
me
?
'
he
said
.
`
Oh
,
Nelly
!
you
know
*NL*
she
has
not
!
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
for
every
thought
she
spends
*NL*
on
Linton
she
spends
a
thousand
on
me
!
At
a
most
miserable
period
of
my
*NL*
life
,
I
had
a
notion
of
the
kind
:
it
haunted
me
on
my
return
to
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
last
summer
;
but
only
her
own
assurance
could
make
me
admit
*NL*
the
horrible
idea
again
.
And
then
,
Linton
would
be
nothing
,
nor
Hindley
,
*NL*
nor
all
the
dreams
that
ever
I
dreamt
.
Two
words
would
comprehend
my
*NL*
future
--
_
death
_
and
_
hell
_
:
existence
,
after
losing
her
,
would
be
hell
.
*NL*
Yet
I
was
a
fool
to
fancy
for
a
moment
that
she
valued
Edgar
Linton
's
*NL*
attachment
more
than
mine
.
If
he
loved
with
all
the
powers
of
his
puny
*NL*
being
,
he
could
n't
love
as
much
in
eighty
years
as
I
could
in
a
day
.
And
*NL*
Catherine
has
a
heart
as
deep
as
I
have
:
the
sea
could
be
as
readily
*NL*
contained
in
that
horse-trough
as
her
whole
affection
be
monopolised
by
*NL*
him
.
Tush
!
He
is
scarcely
a
degree
dearer
to
her
than
her
dog
,
or
her
*NL*
horse
.
It
is
not
in
him
to
be
loved
like
me
:
how
can
she
love
in
him
*NL*
what
he
has
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
and
Edgar
are
as
fond
of
each
other
as
any
two
people
can
be
,
'
*NL*
cried
Isabella
,
with
sudden
vivacity
.
`
No
one
has
a
right
to
talk
in
*NL*
that
manner
,
and
I
wo
n't
hear
my
brother
depreciated
in
silence
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
brother
is
wondrous
fond
of
you
too
,
is
n't
he
?
'
observed
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
scornfully
.
`
He
turns
you
adrift
on
the
world
with
*NL*
surprising
alacrity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
not
aware
of
what
I
suffer
,
'
she
replied
.
'
I
did
n't
tell
him
*NL*
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
been
telling
him
something
,
then
:
you
have
written
,
have
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
say
that
I
was
married
,
I
did
write
--
you
saw
the
note
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
nothing
since
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
young
lady
is
looking
sadly
the
worse
for
her
change
of
condition
,
'
I
*NL*
remarked
.
`
Somebody
's
love
comes
short
in
her
case
,
obviously
;
whose
,
I
*NL*
may
guess
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
should
n't
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
guess
it
was
her
own
,
'
said
Heathcliff
.
`
She
degenerates
into
*NL*
a
mere
slut
!
She
is
tired
of
trying
to
please
me
uncommonly
early
.
You
'd
*NL*
hardly
credit
it
,
but
the
very
morrow
of
our
wedding
she
was
weeping
to
*NL*
go
home
.
However
,
she
'll
suit
this
house
so
much
the
better
for
not
*NL*
being
over
nice
,
and
I
'll
take
care
she
does
not
disgrace
me
by
rambling
*NL*
abroad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
sir
,
'
returned
I
,
'
I
hope
you
'll
consider
that
Mrs.
Heathcliff
is
*NL*
accustomed
to
be
looked
after
and
waited
on
;
and
that
she
has
been
*NL*
brought
up
like
an
only
daughter
,
whom
every
one
was
ready
to
serve
.
You
*NL*
must
let
her
have
a
maid
to
keep
things
tidy
about
her
,
and
you
must
*NL*
treat
her
kindly
.
Whatever
be
your
notion
of
Mr.
Edgar
,
you
can
not
doubt
*NL*
that
she
has
a
capacity
for
strong
attachments
,
or
she
would
n't
have
*NL*
abandoned
the
elegancies
,
and
comforts
,
and
friends
of
her
former
home
,
*NL*
to
fix
contentedly
,
in
such
a
wilderness
as
this
,
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
abandoned
them
under
a
delusion
,
'
he
answered
;
`
picturing
in
me
a
*NL*
hero
of
romance
,
and
expecting
unlimited
indulgences
from
my
chivalrous
*NL*
devotion
.
I
can
hardly
regard
her
in
the
light
of
a
rational
creature
,
*NL*
so
obstinately
has
she
persisted
in
forming
a
fabulous
notion
of
my
*NL*
character
and
acting
on
the
false
impressions
she
cherished
.
But
,
at
*NL*
last
,
I
think
she
begins
to
know
me
:
I
do
n't
perceive
the
silly
smiles
*NL*
and
grimaces
that
provoked
me
at
first
;
and
the
senseless
incapability
of
*NL*
discerning
that
I
was
in
earnest
when
I
gave
her
my
opinion
of
her
*NL*
infatuation
and
herself
.
It
was
a
marvellous
effort
of
perspicacity
to
*NL*
discover
that
I
did
not
love
her
.
I
believed
,
at
one
time
,
no
lessons
*NL*
could
teach
her
that
!
And
yet
it
is
poorly
learnt
;
for
this
morning
she
*NL*
announced
,
as
a
piece
of
appalling
intelligence
,
that
I
had
actually
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
her
hate
me
!
A
positive
labour
of
Hercules
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
!
If
it
be
achieved
,
I
have
cause
to
return
thanks
.
Can
I
trust
your
*NL*
assertion
,
Isabella
?
Are
you
sure
you
hate
me
?
If
I
let
you
alone
for
*NL*
half
a
day
,
wo
n't
you
come
sighing
and
wheedling
to
me
again
?
I
daresay
*NL*
she
would
rather
I
had
seemed
all
tenderness
before
you
:
it
wounds
her
*NL*
vanity
to
have
the
truth
exposed
.
But
I
do
n't
care
who
knows
that
the
*NL*
passion
was
wholly
on
one
side
:
and
I
never
told
her
a
lie
about
it
.
She
*NL*
can
not
accuse
me
of
showing
one
bit
of
deceitful
softness
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
she
saw
me
do
,
on
coming
out
of
the
Grange
,
was
to
hang
up
her
*NL*
little
dog
;
and
when
she
pleaded
for
it
,
the
first
words
I
uttered
were
a
*NL*
wish
that
I
had
the
hanging
of
every
being
belonging
to
her
,
except
one
:
*NL*
possibly
she
took
that
exception
for
herself
.
But
no
brutality
disgusted
*NL*
her
:
I
suppose
she
has
an
innate
admiration
of
it
,
if
only
her
precious
*NL*
person
were
secure
from
injury
!
Now
,
was
it
not
the
depth
of
*NL*
absurdity
--
of
genuine
idiotcy
,
for
that
pitiful
,
slavish
,
mean-minded
*NL*
brach
to
dream
that
I
could
love
her
?
Tell
your
master
,
Nelly
,
that
I
*NL*
never
,
in
all
my
life
,
met
with
such
an
abject
thing
as
she
is
.
She
even
*NL*
disgraces
the
name
of
Linton
;
and
I
've
sometimes
relented
,
from
pure
lack
*NL*
of
invention
,
in
my
experiments
on
what
she
could
endure
,
and
still
creep
*NL*
shamefully
cringing
back
!
But
tell
him
,
also
,
to
set
his
fraternal
and
*NL*
magisterial
heart
at
ease
:
that
I
keep
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
*NL*
law
.
I
have
avoided
,
up
to
this
period
,
giving
her
the
slightest
right
*NL*
to
claim
a
separation
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
she
'd
thank
nobody
for
dividing
*NL*
us
.
If
she
desired
to
go
,
she
might
:
the
nuisance
of
her
presence
*NL*
outweighs
the
gratification
to
be
derived
from
tormenting
her
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
said
I
,
`
this
is
the
talk
of
a
madman
;
your
wife
,
most
*NL*
likely
,
is
convinced
you
are
mad
;
and
,
for
that
reason
,
she
has
borne
*NL*
with
you
hitherto
:
but
now
that
you
say
she
may
go
,
she
'll
doubtless
*NL*
avail
herself
of
the
permission
.
You
are
not
so
bewitched
,
ma'am
,
are
*NL*
you
,
as
to
remain
with
him
of
your
own
accord
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
care
,
Ellen
!
'
answered
Isabella
,
her
eyes
sparkling
irefully
;
there
*NL*
was
no
misdoubting
by
their
expression
the
full
success
of
her
partner
's
*NL*
endeavours
to
make
himself
detested
.
`
Do
n't
put
faith
in
a
single
word
*NL*
he
speaks
.
He
's
a
lying
fiend
!
a
monster
,
and
not
a
human
being
!
I
've
*NL*
been
told
I
might
leave
him
before
;
and
I
've
made
the
attempt
,
but
I
dare
*NL*
not
repeat
it
!
Only
,
Ellen
,
promise
you
'll
not
mention
a
syllable
of
his
*NL*
infamous
conversation
to
my
brother
or
Catherine
.
Whatever
he
may
*NL*
pretend
,
he
wishes
to
provoke
Edgar
to
desperation
:
he
says
he
has
*NL*
married
me
on
purpose
to
obtain
power
over
him
;
and
he
sha
'n'
t
obtain
*NL*
it
--
I
'll
die
first
!
I
just
hope
,
I
pray
,
that
he
may
forget
his
*NL*
diabolical
prudence
and
kill
me
!
The
single
pleasure
I
can
imagine
is
to
*NL*
die
,
or
to
see
him
dead
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
--
that
will
do
for
the
present
!
'
said
Heathcliff
.
`
If
you
are
*NL*
called
upon
in
a
court
of
law
,
you
'll
remember
her
language
,
Nelly
!
And
*NL*
take
a
good
look
at
that
countenance
:
she
's
near
the
point
which
would
*NL*
suit
me
.
No
;
you
're
not
fit
to
be
your
own
guardian
,
Isabella
,
now
;
and
*NL*
I
,
being
your
legal
protector
,
must
retain
you
in
my
custody
,
however
*NL*
distasteful
the
obligation
may
be
.
Go
up-stairs
;
I
have
something
to
say
*NL*
to
Ellen
Dean
in
private
.
That
's
not
the
way
:
up-stairs
,
I
tell
you
!
*NL*
Why
,
this
is
the
road
upstairs
,
child
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
,
and
thrust
her
from
the
room
;
and
returned
muttering
--
'
I
have
*NL*
no
pity
!
I
have
no
pity
!
The
more
the
worms
writhe
,
the
more
I
yearn
to
*NL*
crush
out
their
entrails
!
It
is
a
moral
teething
;
and
I
grind
with
*NL*
greater
energy
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
pain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
understand
what
the
word
pity
means
?
'
I
said
,
hastening
to
resume
*NL*
my
bonnet
.
`
Did
you
ever
feel
a
touch
of
it
in
your
life
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
that
down
!
'
he
interrupted
,
perceiving
my
intention
to
depart
.
`
You
*NL*
are
not
going
yet
.
Come
here
now
,
Nelly
:
I
must
either
persuade
or
*NL*
compel
you
to
aid
me
in
fulfilling
my
determination
to
see
Catherine
,
and
*NL*
that
without
delay
.
I
swear
that
I
meditate
no
harm
:
I
do
n't
desire
to
*NL*
cause
any
disturbance
,
or
to
exasperate
or
insult
Mr.
Linton
;
I
only
wish
*NL*
to
hear
from
herself
how
she
is
,
and
why
she
has
been
ill
;
and
to
ask
if
*NL*
anything
that
I
could
do
would
be
of
use
to
her
.
Last
night
I
was
in
the
*NL*
Grange
garden
six
hours
,
and
I
'll
return
there
to-night
;
and
every
night
*NL*
I
'll
haunt
the
place
,
and
every
day
,
till
I
find
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
entering
.
If
Edgar
Linton
meets
me
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
knock
him
*NL*
down
,
and
give
him
enough
to
insure
his
quiescence
while
I
stay
.
If
his
*NL*
servants
oppose
me
,
I
shall
threaten
them
off
with
these
pistols
.
But
*NL*
would
n't
it
be
better
to
prevent
my
coming
in
contact
with
them
,
or
their
*NL*
master
?
And
you
could
do
it
so
easily
.
I
'd
warn
you
when
I
came
,
and
*NL*
then
you
might
let
me
in
unobserved
,
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
,
and
watch
*NL*
till
I
departed
,
your
conscience
quite
calm
:
you
would
be
hindering
*NL*
mischief
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
protested
against
playing
that
treacherous
part
in
my
employer
's
house
:
*NL*
and
,
besides
,
I
urged
the
cruelty
and
selfishness
of
his
destroying
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
's
tranquillity
for
his
satisfaction
.
`
The
commonest
occurrence
*NL*
startles
her
painfully
,
'
I
said
.
`
She
's
all
nerves
,
and
she
could
n't
*NL*
bear
the
surprise
,
I
'm
positive
.
Do
n't
persist
,
sir
!
or
else
I
shall
be
*NL*
obliged
to
inform
my
master
of
your
designs
;
and
he
'll
take
measures
to
*NL*
secure
his
house
and
its
inmates
from
any
such
unwarrantable
intrusions
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
that
case
I
'll
take
measures
to
secure
you
,
woman
!
'
exclaimed
*NL*
Heathcliff
;
`
you
shall
not
leave
Wuthering
Heights
till
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
.
It
is
a
foolish
story
to
assert
that
Catherine
could
not
bear
*NL*
to
see
me
;
and
as
to
surprising
her
,
I
do
n't
desire
it
:
you
must
prepare
*NL*
her
--
ask
her
if
I
may
come
.
You
say
she
never
mentions
my
name
,
and
that
*NL*
I
am
never
mentioned
to
her
.
To
whom
should
she
mention
me
if
I
am
a
*NL*
forbidden
topic
in
the
house
?
She
thinks
you
are
all
spies
for
her
*NL*
husband
.
Oh
,
I
've
no
doubt
she
's
in
hell
among
you
!
I
guess
by
her
*NL*
silence
,
as
much
as
anything
,
what
she
feels
.
You
say
she
is
often
*NL*
restless
,
and
anxious-looking
:
is
that
a
proof
of
tranquillity
?
You
talk
*NL*
of
her
mind
being
unsettled
.
How
the
devil
could
it
be
otherwise
in
her
*NL*
frightful
isolation
?
And
that
insipid
,
paltry
creature
attending
her
*NL*
from
_
duty
_
and
_
humanity
_
!
From
_
pity
_
and
_
charity
_
!
He
might
as
well
*NL*
plant
an
oak
in
a
flower-pot
,
and
expect
it
to
thrive
,
as
imagine
he
can
*NL*
restore
her
to
vigour
in
the
soil
of
his
shallow
cares
?
Let
us
settle
it
*NL*
at
once
:
will
you
stay
here
,
and
am
I
to
fight
my
way
to
Catherine
over
*NL*
Linton
and
his
footman
?
Or
will
you
be
my
friend
,
as
you
have
been
*NL*
hitherto
,
and
do
what
I
request
?
Decide
!
because
there
is
no
reason
for
*NL*
my
lingering
another
minute
,
if
you
persist
in
your
stubborn
ill-nature
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
argued
and
complained
,
and
flatly
refused
him
fifty
*NL*
times
;
but
in
the
long
run
he
forced
me
to
an
agreement
.
I
engaged
to
*NL*
carry
a
letter
from
him
to
my
mistress
;
and
should
she
consent
,
I
*NL*
promised
to
let
him
have
intelligence
of
Linton
's
next
absence
from
home
,
*NL*
when
he
might
come
,
and
get
in
as
he
was
able
:
I
would
n't
be
there
,
and
*NL*
my
fellow-servants
should
be
equally
out
of
the
way
.
Was
it
right
or
*NL*
wrong
?
I
fear
it
was
wrong
,
though
expedient
.
I
thought
I
prevented
*NL*
another
explosion
by
my
compliance
;
and
I
thought
,
too
,
it
might
create
a
*NL*
favourable
crisis
in
Catherine
's
mental
illness
:
and
then
I
remembered
*NL*
Mr.
Edgar
's
stern
rebuke
of
my
carrying
tales
;
and
I
tried
to
smooth
away
*NL*
all
disquietude
on
the
subject
,
by
affirming
,
with
frequent
iteration
,
*NL*
that
that
betrayal
of
trust
,
if
it
merited
so
harsh
an
appellation
,
*NL*
should
be
the
last
.
Notwithstanding
,
my
journey
homeward
was
sadder
than
*NL*
my
journey
thither
;
and
many
misgivings
I
had
,
ere
I
could
prevail
on
*NL*
myself
to
put
the
missive
into
Mrs.
Linton
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
is
Kenneth
;
I
'll
go
down
,
and
tell
him
how
much
better
you
are
.
*NL*
My
history
is
_
dree
_
,
as
we
say
,
and
will
serve
to
while
away
another
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dree
,
and
dreary
!
I
reflected
as
the
good
woman
descended
to
receive
the
*NL*
doctor
:
and
not
exactly
of
the
kind
which
I
should
have
chosen
to
amuse
*NL*
me
.
But
never
mind
!
I
'll
extract
wholesome
medicines
from
Mrs.
Dean
's
*NL*
bitter
herbs
;
and
firstly
,
let
me
beware
of
the
fascination
that
lurks
in
*NL*
Catherine
Heathcliff
's
brilliant
eyes
.
I
should
be
in
a
curious
taking
*NL*
if
I
surrendered
my
heart
to
that
young
person
,
and
the
daughter
turned
*NL*
out
a
second
edition
of
the
mother
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Another
week
over
--
and
I
am
so
many
days
nearer
health
,
and
spring
!
I
*NL*
have
now
heard
all
my
neighbour
's
history
,
at
different
sittings
,
as
the
*NL*
housekeeper
could
spare
time
from
more
important
occupations
.
I
'll
*NL*
continue
it
in
her
own
words
,
only
a
little
condensed
.
She
is
,
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
a
very
fair
narrator
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
could
improve
her
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
she
said
,
the
evening
of
my
visit
to
the
Heights
,
I
knew
,
*NL*
as
well
as
if
I
saw
him
,
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
about
the
place
;
and
I
*NL*
shunned
going
out
,
because
I
still
carried
his
letter
in
my
pocket
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
be
threatened
or
teased
any
more
.
I
had
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
not
to
give
it
till
my
master
went
somewhere
,
as
I
could
not
guess
how
*NL*
its
receipt
would
affect
Catherine
.
The
consequence
was
,
that
it
did
not
*NL*
reach
her
before
the
lapse
of
three
days
.
The
fourth
was
Sunday
,
and
I
*NL*
brought
it
into
her
room
after
the
family
were
gone
to
church
.
There
was
*NL*
a
manservant
left
to
keep
the
house
with
me
,
and
we
generally
made
a
*NL*
practice
of
locking
the
doors
during
the
hours
of
service
;
but
on
that
*NL*
occasion
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
pleasant
that
I
set
them
wide
open
,
*NL*
and
,
to
fulfil
my
engagement
,
as
I
knew
who
would
be
coming
,
I
told
my
*NL*
companion
that
the
mistress
wished
very
much
for
some
oranges
,
and
he
*NL*
must
run
over
to
the
village
and
get
a
few
,
to
be
paid
for
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
He
departed
,
and
I
went
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
sat
in
a
loose
white
dress
,
with
a
light
shawl
over
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
in
the
recess
of
the
open
window
,
as
usual
.
Her
thick
,
long
*NL*
hair
had
been
partly
removed
at
the
beginning
of
her
illness
,
and
now
she
*NL*
wore
it
simply
combed
in
its
natural
tresses
over
her
temples
and
neck
.
*NL*
Her
appearance
was
altered
,
as
I
had
told
Heathcliff
;
but
when
she
was
*NL*
calm
,
there
seemed
unearthly
beauty
in
the
change
.
The
flash
of
her
eyes
*NL*
had
been
succeeded
by
a
dreamy
and
melancholy
softness
;
they
no
longer
*NL*
gave
the
impression
of
looking
at
the
objects
around
her
:
they
appeared
*NL*
always
to
gaze
beyond
,
and
far
beyond
--
you
would
have
said
out
of
this
*NL*
world
.
Then
,
the
paleness
of
her
face
--
its
haggard
aspect
having
*NL*
vanished
as
she
recovered
flesh
--
and
the
peculiar
expression
arising
from
*NL*
her
mental
state
,
though
painfully
suggestive
of
their
causes
,
added
to
*NL*
the
touching
interest
which
she
awakened
;
and
--
invariably
to
me
,
I
know
,
*NL*
and
to
any
person
who
saw
her
,
I
should
think
--
refuted
more
tangible
*NL*
proofs
of
convalescence
,
and
stamped
her
as
one
doomed
to
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
book
lay
spread
on
the
sill
before
her
,
and
the
scarcely
perceptible
*NL*
wind
fluttered
its
leaves
at
intervals
.
I
believe
Linton
had
laid
it
*NL*
there
:
for
she
never
endeavoured
to
divert
herself
with
reading
,
or
*NL*
occupation
of
any
kind
,
and
he
would
spend
many
an
hour
in
trying
to
*NL*
entice
her
attention
to
some
subject
which
had
formerly
been
her
*NL*
amusement
.
She
was
conscious
of
his
aim
,
and
in
her
better
moods
endured
*NL*
his
efforts
placidly
,
only
showing
their
uselessness
by
now
and
then
*NL*
suppressing
a
wearied
sigh
,
and
checking
him
at
last
with
the
saddest
of
*NL*
smiles
and
kisses
.
At
other
times
,
she
would
turn
petulantly
away
,
and
*NL*
hide
her
face
in
her
hands
,
or
even
push
him
off
angrily
;
and
then
he
*NL*
took
care
to
let
her
alone
,
for
he
was
certain
of
doing
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gimmerton
chapel
bells
were
still
ringing
;
and
the
full
,
mellow
flow
of
*NL*
the
beck
in
the
valley
came
soothingly
on
the
ear
.
It
was
a
sweet
*NL*
substitute
for
the
yet
absent
murmur
of
the
summer
foliage
,
which
drowned
*NL*
that
music
about
the
Grange
when
the
trees
were
in
leaf
.
At
Wuthering
*NL*
Heights
it
always
sounded
on
quiet
days
following
a
great
thaw
or
a
*NL*
season
of
steady
rain
.
And
of
Wuthering
Heights
Catherine
was
thinking
*NL*
as
she
listened
:
that
is
,
if
she
thought
or
listened
at
all
;
but
she
had
*NL*
the
vague
,
distant
look
I
mentioned
before
,
which
expressed
no
*NL*
recognition
of
material
things
either
by
ear
or
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
a
letter
for
you
,
Mrs.
Linton
,
'
I
said
,
gently
inserting
it
in
*NL*
one
hand
that
rested
on
her
knee
.
`
You
must
read
it
immediately
,
because
*NL*
it
wants
an
answer
.
Shall
I
break
the
seal
?
'
`
Yes
,
'
she
answered
,
*NL*
without
altering
the
direction
of
her
eyes
.
I
opened
it
--
it
was
very
*NL*
short
.
`
Now
,
'
I
continued
,
`
read
it
.
'
She
drew
away
her
hand
,
and
let
*NL*
it
fall
.
I
replaced
it
in
her
lap
,
and
stood
waiting
till
it
should
*NL*
please
her
to
glance
down
;
but
that
movement
was
so
long
delayed
that
at
*NL*
last
I
resumed
--
`
Must
I
read
it
,
ma'am
?
It
is
from
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
start
and
a
troubled
gleam
of
recollection
,
and
a
struggle
to
*NL*
arrange
her
ideas
.
She
lifted
the
letter
,
and
seemed
to
peruse
it
;
and
*NL*
when
she
came
to
the
signature
she
sighed
:
yet
still
I
found
she
had
not
*NL*
gathered
its
import
,
for
,
upon
my
desiring
to
hear
her
reply
,
she
merely
*NL*
pointed
to
the
name
,
and
gazed
at
me
with
mournful
and
questioning
*NL*
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
he
wishes
to
see
you
,
'
said
I
,
guessing
her
need
of
an
*NL*
interpreter
.
`
He
's
in
the
garden
by
this
time
,
and
impatient
to
know
*NL*
what
answer
I
shall
bring
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
spoke
,
I
observed
a
large
dog
lying
on
the
sunny
grass
beneath
raise
*NL*
its
ears
as
if
about
to
bark
,
and
then
smoothing
them
back
,
announce
,
by
*NL*
a
wag
of
the
tail
,
that
some
one
approached
whom
it
did
not
consider
a
*NL*
stranger
.
Mrs.
Linton
bent
forward
,
and
listened
breathlessly
.
The
*NL*
minute
after
a
step
traversed
the
hall
;
the
open
house
was
too
tempting
*NL*
for
Heathcliff
to
resist
walking
in
:
most
likely
he
supposed
that
I
was
*NL*
inclined
to
shirk
my
promise
,
and
so
resolved
to
trust
to
his
own
*NL*
audacity
.
With
straining
eagerness
Catherine
gazed
towards
the
entrance
*NL*
of
her
chamber
.
He
did
not
hit
the
right
room
directly
:
she
motioned
me
*NL*
to
admit
him
,
but
he
found
it
out
ere
I
could
reach
the
door
,
and
in
a
*NL*
stride
or
two
was
at
her
side
,
and
had
her
grasped
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
neither
spoke
nor
loosed
his
hold
for
some
five
minutes
,
during
which
*NL*
period
he
bestowed
more
kisses
than
ever
he
gave
in
his
life
before
,
I
*NL*
daresay
:
but
then
my
mistress
had
kissed
him
first
,
and
I
plainly
saw
*NL*
that
he
could
hardly
bear
,
for
downright
agony
,
to
look
into
her
face
!
*NL*
The
same
conviction
had
stricken
him
as
me
,
from
the
instant
he
beheld
*NL*
her
,
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
ultimate
recovery
there
--
she
was
*NL*
fated
,
sure
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Cathy
!
Oh
,
my
life
!
how
can
I
bear
it
?
'
was
the
first
sentence
he
*NL*
uttered
,
in
a
tone
that
did
not
seek
to
disguise
his
despair
.
And
now
he
*NL*
stared
at
her
so
earnestly
that
I
thought
the
very
intensity
of
his
gaze
*NL*
would
bring
tears
into
his
eyes
;
but
they
burned
with
anguish
:
they
did
*NL*
not
melt
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
now
?
'
said
Catherine
,
leaning
back
,
and
returning
his
look
with
a
*NL*
suddenly
clouded
brow
:
her
humour
was
a
mere
vane
for
constantly
varying
*NL*
caprices
.
`
You
and
Edgar
have
broken
my
heart
,
Heathcliff
!
And
you
both
*NL*
come
to
bewail
the
deed
to
me
,
as
if
you
were
the
people
to
be
pitied
!
I
*NL*
shall
not
pity
you
,
not
I
.
You
have
killed
me
--
and
thriven
on
it
,
I
*NL*
think
.
How
strong
you
are
!
How
many
years
do
you
mean
to
live
after
I
*NL*
am
gone
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
had
knelt
on
one
knee
to
embrace
her
;
he
attempted
to
rise
,
*NL*
but
she
seized
his
hair
,
and
kept
him
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
I
could
hold
you
,
'
she
continued
,
bitterly
,
'till
we
were
both
*NL*
dead
!
I
should
n't
care
what
you
suffered
.
I
care
nothing
for
your
*NL*
sufferings
.
Why
should
n't
you
suffer
?
I
do
!
Will
you
forget
me
?
Will
*NL*
you
be
happy
when
I
am
in
the
earth
?
Will
you
say
twenty
years
hence
,
*NL*
``
That
's
the
grave
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
?
I
loved
her
long
ago
,
and
was
*NL*
wretched
to
lose
her
;
but
it
is
past
.
I
've
loved
many
others
since
:
my
*NL*
children
are
dearer
to
me
than
she
was
;
and
,
at
death
,
I
shall
not
*NL*
rejoice
that
I
am
going
to
her
:
I
shall
be
sorry
that
I
must
leave
*NL*
them
!
''
Will
you
say
so
,
Heathcliff
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
torture
me
till
I
'm
as
mad
as
yourself
,
'
cried
he
,
wrenching
his
*NL*
head
free
,
and
grinding
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
,
to
a
cool
spectator
,
made
a
strange
and
fearful
picture
.
Well
*NL*
might
Catherine
deem
that
heaven
would
be
a
land
of
exile
to
her
,
unless
*NL*
with
her
mortal
body
she
cast
away
her
moral
character
also
.
Her
present
*NL*
countenance
had
a
wild
vindictiveness
in
its
white
cheek
,
and
a
bloodless
*NL*
lip
and
scintillating
eye
;
and
she
retained
in
her
closed
fingers
a
*NL*
portion
of
the
locks
she
had
been
grasping
.
As
to
her
companion
,
while
*NL*
raising
himself
with
one
hand
,
he
had
taken
her
arm
with
the
other
;
and
*NL*
so
inadequate
was
his
stock
of
gentleness
to
the
requirements
of
her
*NL*
condition
,
that
on
his
letting
go
I
saw
four
distinct
impressions
left
*NL*
blue
in
the
colourless
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
possessed
with
a
devil
,
'
he
pursued
,
savagely
,
`
to
talk
in
that
*NL*
manner
to
me
when
you
are
dying
?
Do
you
reflect
that
all
those
words
*NL*
will
be
branded
in
my
memory
,
and
eating
deeper
eternally
after
you
have
*NL*
left
me
?
You
know
you
lie
to
say
I
have
killed
you
:
and
,
Catherine
,
you
*NL*
know
that
I
could
as
soon
forget
you
as
my
existence
!
Is
it
not
*NL*
sufficient
for
your
infernal
selfishness
,
that
while
you
are
at
peace
I
*NL*
shall
writhe
in
the
torments
of
hell
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
not
be
at
peace
,
'
moaned
Catherine
,
recalled
to
a
sense
of
*NL*
physical
weakness
by
the
violent
,
unequal
throbbing
of
her
heart
,
which
*NL*
beat
visibly
and
audibly
under
this
excess
of
agitation
.
She
said
*NL*
nothing
further
till
the
paroxysm
was
over
;
then
she
continued
,
more
*NL*
kindly
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
wishing
you
greater
torment
than
I
have
,
Heathcliff
.
I
only
*NL*
wish
us
never
to
be
parted
:
and
should
a
word
of
mine
distress
you
*NL*
hereafter
,
think
I
feel
the
same
distress
underground
,
and
for
my
own
*NL*
sake
,
forgive
me
!
Come
here
and
kneel
down
again
!
You
never
harmed
me
*NL*
in
your
life
.
Nay
,
if
you
nurse
anger
,
that
will
be
worse
to
remember
*NL*
than
my
harsh
words
!
Wo
n't
you
come
here
again
?
Do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
went
to
the
back
of
her
chair
,
and
leant
over
,
but
not
so
far
*NL*
as
to
let
her
see
his
face
,
which
was
livid
with
emotion
.
She
bent
round
*NL*
to
look
at
him
;
he
would
not
permit
it
:
turning
abruptly
,
he
walked
to
*NL*
the
fireplace
,
where
he
stood
,
silent
,
with
his
back
towards
us
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Linton
's
glance
followed
him
suspiciously
:
every
movement
woke
a
new
*NL*
sentiment
in
her
.
After
a
pause
and
a
prolonged
gaze
,
she
resumed
;
*NL*
addressing
me
in
accents
of
indignant
disappointment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
see
,
Nelly
,
he
would
not
relent
a
moment
to
keep
me
out
of
the
*NL*
grave
.
_
That
_
is
how
I
'm
loved
!
Well
,
never
mind
.
That
is
not
_
my
_
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
I
shall
love
mine
yet
;
and
take
him
with
me
:
he
's
in
my
*NL*
soul
.
And
,
'
added
she
musingly
,
`
the
thing
that
irks
me
most
is
this
*NL*
shattered
prison
,
after
all
.
I
'm
tired
of
being
enclosed
here
.
I
'm
*NL*
wearying
to
escape
into
that
glorious
world
,
and
to
be
always
there
:
not
*NL*
seeing
it
dimly
through
tears
,
and
yearning
for
it
through
the
walls
of
*NL*
an
aching
heart
:
but
really
with
it
,
and
in
it
.
Nelly
,
you
think
you
are
*NL*
better
and
more
fortunate
than
I
;
in
full
health
and
strength
:
you
are
*NL*
sorry
for
me
--
very
soon
that
will
be
altered
.
I
shall
be
sorry
for
*NL*
_
you
_
.
I
shall
be
incomparably
beyond
and
above
you
all
.
I
_
wonder
_
he
*NL*
wo
n't
be
near
me
!
'
She
went
on
to
herself
.
'
I
thought
he
wished
it
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
dear
!
you
should
not
be
sullen
now
.
Do
come
to
me
,
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
eagerness
she
rose
and
supported
herself
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
.
*NL*
At
that
earnest
appeal
he
turned
to
her
,
looking
absolutely
desperate
.
*NL*
His
eyes
,
wide
and
wet
,
at
last
flashed
fiercely
on
her
;
his
breast
*NL*
heaved
convulsively
.
An
instant
they
held
asunder
,
and
then
how
they
met
*NL*
I
hardly
saw
,
but
Catherine
made
a
spring
,
and
he
caught
her
,
and
they
*NL*
were
locked
in
an
embrace
from
which
I
thought
my
mistress
would
never
be
*NL*
released
alive
:
in
fact
,
to
my
eyes
,
she
seemed
directly
insensible
.
He
*NL*
flung
himself
into
the
nearest
seat
,
and
on
my
approaching
hurriedly
to
*NL*
ascertain
if
she
had
fainted
,
he
gnashed
at
me
,
and
foamed
like
a
mad
*NL*
dog
,
and
gathered
her
to
him
with
greedy
jealousy
.
I
did
not
feel
as
if
*NL*
I
were
in
the
company
of
a
creature
of
my
own
species
:
it
appeared
that
*NL*
he
would
not
understand
,
though
I
spoke
to
him
;
so
I
stood
off
,
and
held
*NL*
my
tongue
,
in
great
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
movement
of
Catherine
's
relieved
me
a
little
presently
:
she
put
up
her
*NL*
hand
to
clasp
his
neck
,
and
bring
her
cheek
to
his
as
he
held
her
;
while
*NL*
he
,
in
return
,
covering
her
with
frantic
caresses
,
said
wildly
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
teach
me
now
how
cruel
you
've
been
--
cruel
and
false
.
_
Why
_
did
you
*NL*
despise
me
?
_
Why
_
did
you
betray
your
own
heart
,
Cathy
?
I
have
not
one
*NL*
word
of
comfort
.
You
deserve
this
.
You
have
killed
yourself
.
Yes
,
you
*NL*
may
kiss
me
,
and
cry
;
and
wring
out
my
kisses
and
tears
:
they
'll
blight
*NL*
you
--
they
'll
damn
you
.
You
loved
me
--
then
what
_
right
_
had
you
to
leave
*NL*
me
?
What
right
--
answer
me
--
for
the
poor
fancy
you
felt
for
Linton
?
*NL*
Because
misery
and
degradation
,
and
death
,
and
nothing
that
God
or
Satan
*NL*
could
inflict
would
have
parted
us
,
_
you
_
,
of
your
own
will
,
did
it
.
I
*NL*
have
not
broken
your
heart
--
_
you
_
have
broken
it
;
and
in
breaking
it
,
you
*NL*
have
broken
mine
.
So
much
the
worse
for
me
that
I
am
strong
.
Do
I
want
*NL*
to
live
?
What
kind
of
living
will
it
be
when
you
--
oh
,
God
!
would
_
you
_
*NL*
like
to
live
with
your
soul
in
the
grave
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
alone
.
Let
me
alone
,
'
sobbed
Catherine
.
`
If
I
've
done
wrong
,
*NL*
I
'm
dying
for
it
.
It
is
enough
!
You
left
me
too
:
but
I
wo
n't
upbraid
*NL*
you
!
I
forgive
you
.
Forgive
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
hard
to
forgive
,
and
to
look
at
those
eyes
,
and
feel
those
wasted
*NL*
hands
,
'
he
answered
.
`
Kiss
me
again
;
and
do
n't
let
me
see
your
eyes
!
I
*NL*
forgive
what
you
have
done
to
me
.
I
love
_
my
_
murderer
--
but
_
yours
_
!
How
*NL*
can
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
--
their
faces
hid
against
each
other
,
and
washed
by
each
*NL*
other
's
tears
.
At
least
,
I
suppose
the
weeping
was
on
both
sides
;
as
it
*NL*
seemed
Heathcliff
could
weep
on
a
great
occasion
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
grew
very
uncomfortable
,
meanwhile
;
for
the
afternoon
wore
fast
away
,
*NL*
the
man
whom
I
had
sent
off
returned
from
his
errand
,
and
I
could
*NL*
distinguish
,
by
the
shine
of
the
western
sun
up
the
valley
,
a
concourse
*NL*
thickening
outside
Gimmerton
chapel
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Service
is
over
,
'
I
announced
.
`
My
master
will
be
here
in
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
groaned
a
curse
,
and
strained
Catherine
closer
:
she
never
*NL*
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ere
long
I
perceived
a
group
of
the
servants
passing
up
the
road
towards
*NL*
the
kitchen
wing
.
Mr.
Linton
was
not
far
behind
;
he
opened
the
gate
*NL*
himself
and
sauntered
slowly
up
,
probably
enjoying
the
lovely
afternoon
*NL*
that
breathed
as
soft
as
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
he
is
here
,
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
For
heaven
's
sake
,
hurry
down
!
You
'll
*NL*
not
meet
any
one
on
the
front
stairs
.
Do
be
quick
;
and
stay
among
the
*NL*
trees
till
he
is
fairly
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
go
,
Cathy
,
'
said
Heathcliff
,
seeking
to
extricate
himself
from
*NL*
his
companion
's
arms
.
`
But
if
I
live
,
I
'll
see
you
again
before
you
are
*NL*
asleep
.
I
wo
n't
stray
five
yards
from
your
window
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
not
go
!
'
she
answered
,
holding
him
as
firmly
as
her
strength
*NL*
allowed
.
`
You
_
shall
_
not
,
I
tell
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
one
hour
,
'
he
pleaded
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
for
one
minute
,
'
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
_
must
_
--
Linton
will
be
up
immediately
,
'
persisted
the
alarmed
*NL*
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
risen
,
and
unfixed
her
fingers
by
the
act
--
she
clung
fast
,
*NL*
gasping
:
there
was
mad
resolution
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
'
she
shrieked
.
`
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
go
.
It
is
the
last
time
!
Edgar
*NL*
will
not
hurt
us
.
Heathcliff
,
I
shall
die
!
I
shall
die
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damn
the
fool
!
There
he
is
,
'
cried
Heathcliff
,
sinking
back
into
his
*NL*
seat
.
`
Hush
,
my
darling
!
Hush
,
hush
,
Catherine
!
I
'll
stay
.
If
he
shot
*NL*
me
so
,
I
'd
expire
with
a
blessing
on
my
lips
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
they
were
fast
again
.
I
heard
my
master
mounting
the
*NL*
stairs
--
the
cold
sweat
ran
from
my
forehead
:
I
was
horrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
going
to
listen
to
her
ravings
?
'
I
said
,
passionately
.
`
She
*NL*
does
not
know
what
she
says
.
Will
you
ruin
her
,
because
she
has
not
wit
*NL*
to
help
herself
?
Get
up
!
You
could
be
free
instantly
.
That
is
the
most
*NL*
diabolical
deed
that
ever
you
did
.
We
are
all
done
for
--
master
,
*NL*
mistress
,
and
servant
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrung
my
hands
,
and
cried
out
;
and
Mr.
Linton
hastened
his
step
at
the
*NL*
noise
.
In
the
midst
of
my
agitation
,
I
was
sincerely
glad
to
observe
*NL*
that
Catherine
's
arms
had
fallen
relaxed
,
and
her
head
hung
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
fainted
,
or
dead
,
'
I
thought
:
`
so
much
the
better
.
Far
better
*NL*
that
she
should
be
dead
,
than
lingering
a
burden
and
a
misery-maker
to
*NL*
all
about
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
sprang
to
his
unbidden
guest
,
blanched
with
astonishment
and
rage
.
*NL*
What
he
meant
to
do
I
can
not
tell
;
however
,
the
other
stopped
all
*NL*
demonstrations
,
at
once
,
by
placing
the
lifeless-looking
form
in
his
*NL*
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
there
!
'
he
said
.
`
Unless
you
be
a
fiend
,
help
her
first
--
then
you
*NL*
shall
speak
to
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
into
the
parlour
,
and
sat
down
.
Mr.
Linton
summoned
me
,
and
*NL*
with
great
difficulty
,
and
after
resorting
to
many
means
,
we
managed
to
*NL*
restore
her
to
sensation
;
but
she
was
all
bewildered
;
she
sighed
,
and
*NL*
moaned
,
and
knew
nobody
.
Edgar
,
in
his
anxiety
for
her
,
forgot
her
hated
*NL*
friend
.
I
did
not
.
I
went
,
at
the
earliest
opportunity
,
and
besought
*NL*
him
to
depart
;
affirming
that
Catherine
was
better
,
and
he
should
hear
*NL*
from
me
in
the
morning
how
she
passed
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
not
refuse
to
go
out
of
doors
,
'
he
answered
;
`
but
I
shall
stay
*NL*
in
the
garden
:
and
,
Nelly
,
mind
you
keep
your
word
to-morrow
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
under
those
larch-trees
.
Mind
!
or
I
pay
another
visit
,
whether
Linton
be
*NL*
in
or
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
sent
a
rapid
glance
through
the
half-open
door
of
the
chamber
,
and
,
*NL*
ascertaining
that
what
I
stated
was
apparently
true
,
delivered
the
house
*NL*
of
his
luckless
presence
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
About
twelve
o'clock
that
night
was
born
the
Catherine
you
saw
at
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
:
a
puny
,
seven-months
'
child
;
and
two
hours
after
the
*NL*
mother
died
,
having
never
recovered
sufficient
consciousness
to
miss
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
or
know
Edgar
.
The
latter
's
distraction
at
his
bereavement
*NL*
is
a
subject
too
painful
to
be
dwelt
on
;
its
after-effects
showed
how
*NL*
deep
the
sorrow
sunk
.
A
great
addition
,
in
my
eyes
,
was
his
being
left
*NL*
without
an
heir
.
I
bemoaned
that
,
as
I
gazed
on
the
feeble
orphan
;
and
I
*NL*
mentally
abused
old
Linton
for
-LRB-
what
was
only
natural
partiality
-RRB-
the
*NL*
securing
his
estate
to
his
own
daughter
,
instead
of
his
son
's
.
An
*NL*
unwelcomed
infant
it
was
,
poor
thing
!
It
might
have
wailed
out
of
life
,
*NL*
and
nobody
cared
a
morsel
,
during
those
first
hours
of
existence
.
We
*NL*
redeemed
the
neglect
afterwards
;
but
its
beginning
was
as
friendless
as
*NL*
its
end
is
likely
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
--
bright
and
cheerful
out
of
doors
--
stole
softened
in
through
*NL*
the
blinds
of
the
silent
room
,
and
suffused
the
couch
and
its
occupant
*NL*
with
a
mellow
,
tender
glow
.
Edgar
Linton
had
his
head
laid
on
the
*NL*
pillow
,
and
his
eyes
shut
.
His
young
and
fair
features
were
almost
as
*NL*
deathlike
as
those
of
the
form
beside
him
,
and
almost
as
fixed
:
but
_
his
_
*NL*
was
the
hush
of
exhausted
anguish
,
and
_
hers
_
of
perfect
peace
.
Her
brow
*NL*
smooth
,
her
lids
closed
,
her
lips
wearing
the
expression
of
a
smile
;
no
*NL*
angel
in
heaven
could
be
more
beautiful
than
she
appeared
.
And
I
partook
*NL*
of
the
infinite
calm
in
which
she
lay
:
my
mind
was
never
in
a
holier
*NL*
frame
than
while
I
gazed
on
that
untroubled
image
of
Divine
rest
.
I
*NL*
instinctively
echoed
the
words
she
had
uttered
a
few
hours
before
:
*NL*
`
Incomparably
beyond
and
above
us
all
!
Whether
still
on
earth
or
now
in
*NL*
heaven
,
her
spirit
is
at
home
with
God
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
if
it
be
a
peculiarity
in
me
,
but
I
am
seldom
otherwise
than
*NL*
happy
while
watching
in
the
chamber
of
death
,
should
no
frenzied
or
*NL*
despairing
mourner
share
the
duty
with
me
.
I
see
a
repose
that
neither
*NL*
earth
nor
hell
can
break
,
and
I
feel
an
assurance
of
the
endless
and
*NL*
shadowless
hereafter
--
the
Eternity
they
have
entered
--
where
life
is
*NL*
boundless
in
its
duration
,
and
love
in
its
sympathy
,
and
joy
in
its
*NL*
fulness
.
I
noticed
on
that
occasion
how
much
selfishness
there
is
even
*NL*
in
a
love
like
Mr.
Linton
's
,
when
he
so
regretted
Catherine
's
blessed
*NL*
release
!
To
be
sure
,
one
might
have
doubted
,
after
the
wayward
and
*NL*
impatient
existence
she
had
led
,
whether
she
merited
a
haven
of
peace
at
*NL*
last
.
One
might
doubt
in
seasons
of
cold
reflection
;
but
not
then
,
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
her
corpse
.
It
asserted
its
own
tranquillity
,
which
*NL*
seemed
a
pledge
of
equal
quiet
to
its
former
inhabitant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
believe
such
people
are
happy
in
the
other
world
,
sir
?
I
'd
give
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
declined
answering
Mrs.
Dean
's
question
,
which
struck
me
as
something
*NL*
heterodox
.
She
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
Retracing
the
course
of
Catherine
Linton
,
I
fear
we
have
no
right
to
*NL*
think
she
is
;
but
we
'll
leave
her
with
her
Maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
looked
asleep
,
and
I
ventured
soon
after
sunrise
to
quit
the
*NL*
room
and
steal
out
to
the
pure
refreshing
air
.
The
servants
thought
me
*NL*
gone
to
shake
off
the
drowsiness
of
my
protracted
watch
;
in
reality
,
my
*NL*
chief
motive
was
seeing
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
If
he
had
remained
among
the
*NL*
larches
all
night
,
he
would
have
heard
nothing
of
the
stir
at
the
Grange
;
*NL*
unless
,
perhaps
,
he
might
catch
the
gallop
of
the
messenger
going
to
*NL*
Gimmerton
.
If
he
had
come
nearer
,
he
would
probably
be
aware
,
from
the
*NL*
lights
flitting
to
and
fro
,
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
outer
*NL*
doors
,
that
all
was
not
right
within
.
I
wished
,
yet
feared
,
to
find
him
.
*NL*
I
felt
the
terrible
news
must
be
told
,
and
I
longed
to
get
it
over
;
but
*NL*
how
to
do
it
I
did
not
know
.
He
was
there
--
at
least
,
a
few
yards
further
*NL*
in
the
park
;
leant
against
an
old
ash-tree
,
his
hat
off
,
and
his
hair
*NL*
soaked
with
the
dew
that
had
gathered
on
the
budded
branches
,
and
fell
*NL*
pattering
round
him
.
He
had
been
standing
a
long
time
in
that
position
,
*NL*
for
I
saw
a
pair
of
ousels
passing
and
repassing
scarcely
three
feet
from
*NL*
him
,
busy
in
building
their
nest
,
and
regarding
his
proximity
no
more
*NL*
than
that
of
a
piece
of
timber
.
They
flew
off
at
my
approach
,
and
he
*NL*
raised
his
eyes
and
spoke
:
--
`
She
's
dead
!
'
he
said
;
`
I
've
not
waited
for
*NL*
you
to
learn
that
.
Put
your
handkerchief
away
--
do
n't
snivel
before
me
.
*NL*
Damn
you
all
!
she
wants
none
of
your
tears
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
weeping
as
much
for
him
as
her
:
we
do
sometimes
pity
creatures
that
*NL*
have
none
of
the
feeling
either
for
themselves
or
others
.
When
I
first
*NL*
looked
into
his
face
,
I
perceived
that
he
had
got
intelligence
of
the
*NL*
catastrophe
;
and
a
foolish
notion
struck
me
that
his
heart
was
quelled
*NL*
and
he
prayed
,
because
his
lips
moved
and
his
gaze
was
bent
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
she
's
dead
!
'
I
answered
,
checking
my
sobs
and
drying
my
cheeks
.
*NL*
`
Gone
to
heaven
,
I
hope
;
where
we
may
,
every
one
,
join
her
,
if
we
take
*NL*
due
warning
and
leave
our
evil
ways
to
follow
good
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
_
she
_
take
due
warning
,
then
?
'
asked
Heathcliff
,
attempting
a
sneer
.
*NL*
`
Did
she
die
like
a
saint
?
Come
,
give
me
a
true
history
of
the
event
.
*NL*
How
did
--
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
endeavoured
to
pronounce
the
name
,
but
could
not
manage
it
;
and
*NL*
compressing
his
mouth
he
held
a
silent
combat
with
his
inward
agony
,
*NL*
defying
,
meanwhile
,
my
sympathy
with
an
unflinching
,
ferocious
stare
.
*NL*
`
How
did
she
die
?
'
he
resumed
,
at
last
--
fain
,
notwithstanding
his
*NL*
hardihood
,
to
have
a
support
behind
him
;
for
,
after
the
struggle
,
he
*NL*
trembled
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
his
very
finger-ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Poor
wretch
!
'
I
thought
;
`
you
have
a
heart
and
nerves
the
same
as
your
*NL*
brother
men
!
Why
should
you
be
anxious
to
conceal
them
?
Your
pride
*NL*
can
not
blind
God
!
You
tempt
him
to
wring
them
,
till
he
forces
a
cry
of
*NL*
humiliation
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quietly
as
a
lamb
!
'
I
answered
,
aloud
.
`
She
drew
a
sigh
,
and
stretched
*NL*
herself
,
like
a
child
reviving
,
and
sinking
again
to
sleep
;
and
five
*NL*
minutes
after
I
felt
one
little
pulse
at
her
heart
,
and
nothing
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
--
did
she
ever
mention
me
?
'
he
asked
,
hesitating
,
as
if
he
dreaded
*NL*
the
answer
to
his
question
would
introduce
details
that
he
could
not
bear
*NL*
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
senses
never
returned
:
she
recognised
nobody
from
the
time
you
left
*NL*
her
,
'
I
said
.
`
She
lies
with
a
sweet
smile
on
her
face
;
and
her
latest
*NL*
ideas
wandered
back
to
pleasant
early
days
.
Her
life
closed
in
a
gentle
*NL*
dream
--
may
she
wake
as
kindly
in
the
other
world
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
she
wake
in
torment
!
'
he
cried
,
with
frightful
vehemence
,
stamping
*NL*
his
foot
,
and
groaning
in
a
sudden
paroxysm
of
ungovernable
passion
.
*NL*
`
Why
,
she
's
a
liar
to
the
end
!
Where
is
she
?
Not
_
there
_
--
not
in
*NL*
heaven
--
not
perished
--
where
?
Oh
!
you
said
you
cared
nothing
for
my
*NL*
sufferings
!
And
I
pray
one
prayer
--
I
repeat
it
till
my
tongue
*NL*
stiffens
--
Catherine
Earnshaw
,
may
you
not
rest
as
long
as
I
am
living
;
*NL*
you
said
I
killed
you
--
haunt
me
,
then
!
The
murdered
_
do
_
haunt
their
*NL*
murderers
,
I
believe
.
I
know
that
ghosts
_
have
_
wandered
on
earth
.
Be
*NL*
with
me
always
--
take
any
form
--
drive
me
mad
!
only
_
do
_
not
leave
me
in
*NL*
this
abyss
,
where
I
can
not
find
you
!
Oh
,
God
!
it
is
unutterable
!
I
*NL*
_
can
not
_
live
without
my
life
!
I
_
can
not
_
live
without
my
soul
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
dashed
his
head
against
the
knotted
trunk
;
and
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
*NL*
howled
,
not
like
a
man
,
but
like
a
savage
beast
being
goaded
to
death
*NL*
with
knives
and
spears
.
I
observed
several
splashes
of
blood
about
the
*NL*
bark
of
the
tree
,
and
his
hand
and
forehead
were
both
stained
;
probably
*NL*
the
scene
I
witnessed
was
a
repetition
of
others
acted
during
the
night
.
*NL*
It
hardly
moved
my
compassion
--
it
appalled
me
:
still
,
I
felt
reluctant
to
*NL*
quit
him
so
.
But
the
moment
he
recollected
himself
enough
to
notice
me
*NL*
watching
,
he
thundered
a
command
for
me
to
go
,
and
I
obeyed
.
He
was
*NL*
beyond
my
skill
to
quiet
or
console
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Linton
's
funeral
was
appointed
to
take
place
on
the
Friday
following
*NL*
her
decease
;
and
till
then
her
coffin
remained
uncovered
,
and
strewn
with
*NL*
flowers
and
scented
leaves
,
in
the
great
drawing-room
.
Linton
spent
his
*NL*
days
and
nights
there
,
a
sleepless
guardian
;
and
--
a
circumstance
*NL*
concealed
from
all
but
me
--
Heathcliff
spent
his
nights
,
at
least
,
*NL*
outside
,
equally
a
stranger
to
repose
.
I
held
no
communication
with
him
:
*NL*
still
,
I
was
conscious
of
his
design
to
enter
,
if
he
could
;
and
on
the
*NL*
Tuesday
,
a
little
after
dark
,
when
my
master
,
from
sheer
fatigue
,
had
*NL*
been
compelled
to
retire
a
couple
of
hours
,
I
went
and
opened
one
of
the
*NL*
windows
;
moved
by
his
perseverance
to
give
him
a
chance
of
bestowing
on
*NL*
the
faded
image
of
his
idol
one
final
adieu
.
He
did
not
omit
to
avail
*NL*
himself
of
the
opportunity
,
cautiously
and
briefly
;
too
cautiously
to
*NL*
betray
his
presence
by
the
slightest
noise
.
Indeed
,
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
discovered
that
he
had
been
there
,
except
for
the
disarrangement
of
the
*NL*
drapery
about
the
corpse
's
face
,
and
for
observing
on
the
floor
a
curl
of
*NL*
light
hair
,
fastened
with
a
silver
thread
;
which
,
on
examination
,
I
*NL*
ascertained
to
have
been
taken
from
a
locket
hung
round
Catherine
's
neck
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
had
opened
the
trinket
and
cast
out
its
contents
,
replacing
*NL*
them
by
a
black
lock
of
his
own
.
I
twisted
the
two
,
and
enclosed
them
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Earnshaw
was
,
of
course
,
invited
to
attend
the
remains
of
his
sister
*NL*
to
the
grave
;
he
sent
no
excuse
,
but
he
never
came
;
so
that
,
besides
her
*NL*
husband
,
the
mourners
were
wholly
composed
of
tenants
and
servants
.
*NL*
Isabella
was
not
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
of
Catherine
's
interment
,
to
the
surprise
of
the
villagers
,
was
*NL*
neither
in
the
chapel
under
the
carved
monument
of
the
Lintons
,
nor
yet
*NL*
by
the
tombs
of
her
own
relations
,
outside
.
It
was
dug
on
a
green
slope
*NL*
in
a
corner
of
the
kirk-yard
,
where
the
wall
is
so
low
that
heath
and
*NL*
bilberry-plants
have
climbed
over
it
from
the
moor
;
and
peat-mould
almost
*NL*
buries
it
.
Her
husband
lies
in
the
same
spot
now
;
and
they
have
each
a
*NL*
simple
headstone
above
,
and
a
plain
grey
block
at
their
feet
,
to
mark
the
*NL*
graves
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
Friday
made
the
last
of
our
fine
days
for
a
month
.
In
the
evening
*NL*
the
weather
broke
:
the
wind
shifted
from
south
to
north-east
,
and
brought
*NL*
rain
first
,
and
then
sleet
and
snow
.
On
the
morrow
one
could
hardly
*NL*
imagine
that
there
had
been
three
weeks
of
summer
:
the
primroses
and
*NL*
crocuses
were
hidden
under
wintry
drifts
;
the
larks
were
silent
,
the
*NL*
young
leaves
of
the
early
trees
smitten
and
blackened
.
And
dreary
,
and
*NL*
chill
,
and
dismal
,
that
morrow
did
creep
over
!
My
master
kept
his
room
;
*NL*
I
took
possession
of
the
lonely
parlour
,
converting
it
into
a
nursery
:
*NL*
and
there
I
was
,
sitting
with
the
moaning
doll
of
a
child
laid
on
my
*NL*
knee
;
rocking
it
to
and
fro
,
and
watching
,
meanwhile
,
the
still
driving
*NL*
flakes
build
up
the
uncurtained
window
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
some
*NL*
person
entered
,
out
of
breath
and
laughing
!
My
anger
was
greater
than
my
*NL*
astonishment
for
a
minute
.
I
supposed
it
one
of
the
maids
,
and
I
*NL*
cried
--
`
Have
done
!
How
dare
you
show
your
giddiness
here
;
What
would
Mr.
*NL*
Linton
say
if
he
heard
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Excuse
me
!
'
answered
a
familiar
voice
;
`
but
I
know
Edgar
is
in
bed
,
and
*NL*
I
can
not
stop
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
the
speaker
came
forward
to
the
fire
,
panting
and
holding
her
*NL*
hand
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
run
the
whole
way
from
Wuthering
Heights
!
'
she
continued
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
;
`
except
where
I
've
flown
.
I
could
n't
count
the
number
of
falls
*NL*
I
've
had
.
Oh
,
I
'm
aching
all
over
!
Do
n't
be
alarmed
!
There
shall
be
an
*NL*
explanation
as
soon
as
I
can
give
it
;
only
just
have
the
goodness
to
step
*NL*
out
and
order
the
carriage
to
take
me
on
to
Gimmerton
,
and
tell
a
servant
*NL*
to
seek
up
a
few
clothes
in
my
wardrobe
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
intruder
was
Mrs.
Heathcliff
.
She
certainly
seemed
in
no
laughing
*NL*
predicament
:
her
hair
streamed
on
her
shoulders
,
dripping
with
snow
and
*NL*
water
;
she
was
dressed
in
the
girlish
dress
she
commonly
wore
,
befitting
*NL*
her
age
more
than
her
position
:
a
low
frock
with
short
sleeves
,
and
*NL*
nothing
on
either
head
or
neck
.
The
frock
was
of
light
silk
,
and
clung
*NL*
to
her
with
wet
,
and
her
feet
were
protected
merely
by
thin
slippers
;
add
*NL*
to
this
a
deep
cut
under
one
ear
,
which
only
the
cold
prevented
from
*NL*
bleeding
profusely
,
a
white
face
scratched
and
bruised
,
and
a
frame
*NL*
hardly
able
to
support
itself
through
fatigue
;
and
you
may
fancy
my
first
*NL*
fright
was
not
much
allayed
when
I
had
had
leisure
to
examine
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
young
lady
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
`
I
'll
stir
nowhere
,
and
hear
nothing
,
*NL*
till
you
have
removed
every
article
of
your
clothes
,
and
put
on
dry
*NL*
things
;
and
certainly
you
shall
not
go
to
Gimmerton
to-night
,
so
it
is
*NL*
needless
to
order
the
carriage
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
I
shall
,
'
she
said
;
`
walking
or
riding
:
yet
I
've
no
objection
*NL*
to
dress
myself
decently
.
And
--
ah
,
see
how
it
flows
down
my
neck
now
!
*NL*
The
fire
does
make
it
smart
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
insisted
on
my
fulfilling
her
directions
,
before
she
would
let
me
*NL*
touch
her
;
and
not
till
after
the
coachman
had
been
instructed
to
get
*NL*
ready
,
and
a
maid
set
to
pack
up
some
necessary
attire
,
did
I
obtain
her
*NL*
consent
for
binding
the
wound
and
helping
to
change
her
garments
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Ellen
,
'
she
said
,
when
my
task
was
finished
and
she
was
seated
in
*NL*
an
easy-chair
on
the
hearth
,
with
a
cup
of
tea
before
her
,
`
you
sit
down
*NL*
opposite
me
,
and
put
poor
Catherine
's
baby
away
:
I
do
n't
like
to
see
it
!
*NL*
You
must
n't
think
I
care
little
for
Catherine
,
because
I
behaved
so
*NL*
foolishly
on
entering
:
I
've
cried
,
too
,
bitterly
--
yes
,
more
than
any
one
*NL*
else
has
reason
to
cry
.
We
parted
unreconciled
,
you
remember
,
and
I
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
forgive
myself
.
But
,
for
all
that
,
I
was
not
going
to
sympathise
*NL*
with
him
--
the
brute
beast
!
Oh
,
give
me
the
poker
!
This
is
the
last
*NL*
thing
of
his
I
have
about
me
:
'
she
slipped
the
gold
ring
from
her
third
*NL*
finger
,
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
.
`
I
'll
smash
it
!
'
she
continued
,
*NL*
striking
it
with
childish
spite
,
`
and
then
I
'll
burn
it
!
'
and
she
took
*NL*
and
dropped
the
misused
article
among
the
coals
.
`
There
!
he
shall
buy
*NL*
another
,
if
he
gets
me
back
again
.
He
'd
be
capable
of
coming
to
seek
me
,
*NL*
to
tease
Edgar
.
I
dare
not
stay
,
lest
that
notion
should
possess
his
*NL*
wicked
head
!
And
besides
,
Edgar
has
not
been
kind
,
has
he
?
And
I
wo
n't
*NL*
come
suing
for
his
assistance
;
nor
will
I
bring
him
into
more
trouble
.
*NL*
Necessity
compelled
me
to
seek
shelter
here
;
though
,
if
I
had
not
learned
*NL*
he
was
out
of
the
way
,
I
'd
have
halted
at
the
kitchen
,
washed
my
face
,
*NL*
warmed
myself
,
got
you
to
bring
what
I
wanted
,
and
departed
again
to
*NL*
anywhere
out
of
the
reach
of
my
accursed
--
of
that
incarnate
goblin
!
Ah
,
*NL*
he
was
in
such
a
fury
!
If
he
had
caught
me
!
It
's
a
pity
Earnshaw
is
not
*NL*
his
match
in
strength
:
I
would
n't
have
run
till
I
'd
seen
him
all
but
*NL*
demolished
,
had
Hindley
been
able
to
do
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
do
n't
talk
so
fast
,
Miss
!
'
I
interrupted
;
`
you
'll
disorder
the
*NL*
handkerchief
I
have
tied
round
your
face
,
and
make
the
cut
bleed
again
.
*NL*
Drink
your
tea
,
and
take
breath
,
and
give
over
laughing
:
laughter
is
*NL*
sadly
out
of
place
under
this
roof
,
and
in
your
condition
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
undeniable
truth
,
'
she
replied
.
`
Listen
to
that
child
!
It
maintains
*NL*
a
constant
wail
--
send
it
out
of
my
hearing
for
an
hour
;
I
sha
'n'
t
stay
*NL*
any
longer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
rang
the
bell
,
and
committed
it
to
a
servant
's
care
;
and
then
I
*NL*
inquired
what
had
urged
her
to
escape
from
Wuthering
Heights
in
such
an
*NL*
unlikely
plight
,
and
where
she
meant
to
go
,
as
she
refused
remaining
with
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ought
,
and
I
wished
to
remain
,
'
answered
she
,
`
to
cheer
Edgar
and
take
*NL*
care
of
the
baby
,
for
two
things
,
and
because
the
Grange
is
my
right
*NL*
home
.
But
I
tell
you
he
would
n't
let
me
!
Do
you
think
he
could
bear
to
*NL*
see
me
grow
fat
and
merry
--
could
bear
to
think
that
we
were
tranquil
,
and
*NL*
not
resolve
on
poisoning
our
comfort
?
Now
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
being
sure
that
he
detests
me
,
to
the
point
of
its
annoying
him
seriously
*NL*
to
have
me
within
ear-shot
or
eyesight
:
I
notice
,
when
I
enter
his
*NL*
presence
,
the
muscles
of
his
countenance
are
involuntarily
distorted
into
*NL*
an
expression
of
hatred
;
partly
arising
from
his
knowledge
of
the
good
*NL*
causes
I
have
to
feel
that
sentiment
for
him
,
and
partly
from
original
*NL*
aversion
.
It
is
strong
enough
to
make
me
feel
pretty
certain
that
he
*NL*
would
not
chase
me
over
England
,
supposing
I
contrived
a
clear
escape
;
*NL*
and
therefore
I
must
get
quite
away
.
I
've
recovered
from
my
first
desire
*NL*
to
be
killed
by
him
:
I
'd
rather
he
'd
kill
himself
!
He
has
extinguished
*NL*
my
love
effectually
,
and
so
I
'm
at
my
ease
.
I
can
recollect
yet
how
I
*NL*
loved
him
;
and
can
dimly
imagine
that
I
could
still
be
loving
him
,
if
--
no
,
*NL*
no
!
Even
if
he
had
doted
on
me
,
the
devilish
nature
would
have
revealed
*NL*
its
existence
somehow
.
Catherine
had
an
awfully
perverted
taste
to
*NL*
esteem
him
so
dearly
,
knowing
him
so
well
.
Monster
!
would
that
he
could
*NL*
be
blotted
out
of
creation
,
and
out
of
my
memory
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
hush
!
He
's
a
human
being
,
'
I
said
.
`
Be
more
charitable
:
there
*NL*
are
worse
men
than
he
is
yet
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
not
a
human
being
,
'
she
retorted
;
`
and
he
has
no
claim
on
my
*NL*
charity
.
I
gave
him
my
heart
,
and
he
took
and
pinched
it
to
death
,
and
*NL*
flung
it
back
to
me
.
People
feel
with
their
hearts
,
Ellen
:
and
since
he
*NL*
has
destroyed
mine
,
I
have
not
power
to
feel
for
him
:
and
I
would
not
,
*NL*
though
he
groaned
from
this
to
his
dying
day
,
and
wept
tears
of
blood
for
*NL*
Catherine
!
No
,
indeed
,
indeed
,
I
would
n't
!
'
And
here
Isabella
began
to
*NL*
cry
;
but
,
immediately
dashing
the
water
from
her
lashes
,
she
recommenced
.
*NL*
`
You
asked
,
what
has
driven
me
to
flight
at
last
?
I
was
compelled
to
*NL*
attempt
it
,
because
I
had
succeeded
in
rousing
his
rage
a
pitch
above
his
*NL*
malignity
.
Pulling
out
the
nerves
with
red
hot
pincers
requires
more
*NL*
coolness
than
knocking
on
the
head
.
He
was
worked
up
to
forget
the
*NL*
fiendish
prudence
he
boasted
of
,
and
proceeded
to
murderous
violence
.
I
*NL*
experienced
pleasure
in
being
able
to
exasperate
him
:
the
sense
of
*NL*
pleasure
woke
my
instinct
of
self-preservation
,
so
I
fairly
broke
free
;
*NL*
and
if
ever
I
come
into
his
hands
again
he
is
welcome
to
a
signal
*NL*
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yesterday
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
should
have
been
at
the
funeral
.
He
*NL*
kept
himself
sober
for
the
purpose
--
tolerably
sober
:
not
going
to
bed
mad
*NL*
at
six
o'clock
and
getting
up
drunk
at
twelve
.
Consequently
,
he
rose
,
in
*NL*
suicidal
low
spirits
,
as
fit
for
the
church
as
for
a
dance
;
and
instead
,
*NL*
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
swallowed
gin
or
brandy
by
tumblerfuls
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
--
I
shudder
to
name
him
!
has
been
a
stranger
in
the
house
from
*NL*
last
Sunday
till
to-day
.
Whether
the
angels
have
fed
him
,
or
his
kin
*NL*
beneath
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
has
not
eaten
a
meal
with
us
for
nearly
a
*NL*
week
.
He
has
just
come
home
at
dawn
,
and
gone
up-stairs
to
his
chamber
;
*NL*
locking
himself
in
--
as
if
anybody
dreamt
of
coveting
his
company
!
There
*NL*
he
has
continued
,
praying
like
a
Methodist
:
only
the
deity
he
implored
is
*NL*
senseless
dust
and
ashes
;
and
God
,
when
addressed
,
was
curiously
*NL*
confounded
with
his
own
black
father
!
After
concluding
these
precious
*NL*
orisons
--
and
they
lasted
generally
till
he
grew
hoarse
and
his
voice
was
*NL*
strangled
in
his
throat
--
he
would
be
off
again
;
always
straight
down
to
*NL*
the
Grange
!
I
wonder
Edgar
did
not
send
for
a
constable
,
and
give
him
*NL*
into
custody
!
For
me
,
grieved
as
I
was
about
Catherine
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
avoid
regarding
this
season
of
deliverance
from
degrading
*NL*
oppression
as
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
recovered
spirits
sufficient
to
bear
Joseph
's
eternal
lectures
without
*NL*
weeping
,
and
to
move
up
and
down
the
house
less
with
the
foot
of
a
*NL*
frightened
thief
than
formerly
.
You
would
n't
think
that
I
should
cry
at
*NL*
anything
Joseph
could
say
;
but
he
and
Hareton
are
detestable
companions
.
*NL*
I
'd
rather
sit
with
Hindley
,
and
hear
his
awful
talk
,
than
with
``
t
'
*NL*
little
maister
''
and
his
staunch
supporter
,
that
odious
old
man
!
When
*NL*
Heathcliff
is
in
,
I
'm
often
obliged
to
seek
the
kitchen
and
their
*NL*
society
,
or
starve
among
the
damp
uninhabited
chambers
;
when
he
is
not
,
*NL*
as
was
the
case
this
week
,
I
establish
a
table
and
chair
at
one
corner
of
*NL*
the
house
fire
,
and
never
mind
how
Mr.
Earnshaw
may
occupy
himself
;
and
*NL*
he
does
not
interfere
with
my
arrangements
.
He
is
quieter
now
than
he
*NL*
used
to
be
,
if
no
one
provokes
him
:
more
sullen
and
depressed
,
and
less
*NL*
furious
.
Joseph
affirms
he
's
sure
he
's
an
altered
man
:
that
the
Lord
has
*NL*
touched
his
heart
,
and
he
is
saved
``
so
as
by
fire
.
''
I
'm
puzzled
to
*NL*
detect
signs
of
the
favourable
change
:
but
it
is
not
my
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yester-evening
I
sat
in
my
nook
reading
some
old
books
till
late
on
*NL*
towards
twelve
.
It
seemed
so
dismal
to
go
up-stairs
,
with
the
wild
snow
*NL*
blowing
outside
,
and
my
thoughts
continually
reverting
to
the
kirk-yard
*NL*
and
the
new-made
grave
!
I
dared
hardly
lift
my
eyes
from
the
page
before
*NL*
me
,
that
melancholy
scene
so
instantly
usurped
its
place
.
Hindley
sat
*NL*
opposite
,
his
head
leant
on
his
hand
;
perhaps
meditating
on
the
same
*NL*
subject
.
He
had
ceased
drinking
at
a
point
below
irrationality
,
and
had
*NL*
neither
stirred
nor
spoken
during
two
or
three
hours
.
There
was
no
sound
*NL*
through
the
house
but
the
moaning
wind
,
which
shook
the
windows
every
now
*NL*
and
then
,
the
faint
crackling
of
the
coals
,
and
the
click
of
my
snuffers
*NL*
as
I
removed
at
intervals
the
long
wick
of
the
candle
.
Hareton
and
*NL*
Joseph
were
probably
fast
asleep
in
bed
.
It
was
very
,
very
sad
:
and
*NL*
while
I
read
I
sighed
,
for
it
seemed
as
if
all
joy
had
vanished
from
the
*NL*
world
,
never
to
be
restored
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
doleful
silence
was
broken
at
length
by
the
sound
of
the
kitchen
*NL*
latch
:
Heathcliff
had
returned
from
his
watch
earlier
than
usual
;
owing
,
*NL*
I
suppose
,
to
the
sudden
storm
.
That
entrance
was
fastened
,
and
we
heard
*NL*
him
coming
round
to
get
in
by
the
other
.
I
rose
with
an
irrepressible
*NL*
expression
of
what
I
felt
on
my
lips
,
which
induced
my
companion
,
who
had
*NL*
been
staring
towards
the
door
,
to
turn
and
look
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
'll
keep
him
out
five
minutes
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
You
wo
n't
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
,
you
may
keep
him
out
the
whole
night
for
me
,
''
I
answered
.
``
Do
!
put
*NL*
the
key
in
the
lock
,
and
draw
the
bolts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Earnshaw
accomplished
this
ere
his
guest
reached
the
front
;
he
then
came
*NL*
and
brought
his
chair
to
the
other
side
of
my
table
,
leaning
over
it
,
and
*NL*
searching
in
my
eyes
for
a
sympathy
with
the
burning
hate
that
gleamed
*NL*
from
his
:
as
he
both
looked
and
felt
like
an
assassin
,
he
could
n't
*NL*
exactly
find
that
;
but
he
discovered
enough
to
encourage
him
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
,
and
I
,
''
he
said
,
``
have
each
a
great
debt
to
settle
with
the
man
*NL*
out
yonder
!
If
we
were
neither
of
us
cowards
,
we
might
combine
to
*NL*
discharge
it
.
Are
you
as
soft
as
your
brother
?
Are
you
willing
to
*NL*
endure
to
the
last
,
and
not
once
attempt
a
repayment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
'm
weary
of
enduring
now
,
''
I
replied
;
``
and
I
'd
be
glad
of
a
*NL*
retaliation
that
would
n't
recoil
on
myself
;
but
treachery
and
violence
*NL*
are
spears
pointed
at
both
ends
;
they
wound
those
who
resort
to
them
*NL*
worse
than
their
enemies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Treachery
and
violence
are
a
just
return
for
treachery
and
violence
!
''
*NL*
cried
Hindley
.
``
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
I
'll
ask
you
to
do
nothing
;
but
sit
*NL*
still
and
be
dumb
.
Tell
me
now
,
can
you
?
I
'm
sure
you
would
have
as
*NL*
much
pleasure
as
I
in
witnessing
the
conclusion
of
the
fiend
's
existence
;
*NL*
he
'll
be
_
your
_
death
unless
you
overreach
him
;
and
he
'll
be
_
my
_
ruin
.
*NL*
Damn
the
hellish
villain
!
He
knocks
at
the
door
as
if
he
were
master
*NL*
here
already
!
Promise
to
hold
your
tongue
,
and
before
that
clock
*NL*
strikes
--
it
wants
three
minutes
of
one
--
you
're

*NL*
*NL*
`
He
took
the
implements
which
I
described
to
you
in
my
letter
from
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
would
have
turned
down
the
candle
.
I
snatched
it
away
,
*NL*
however
,
and
seized
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
'll
not
hold
my
tongue
!
''
I
said
;
``
you
must
n't
touch
him
.
Let
the
door
*NL*
remain
shut
,
and
be
quiet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
!
I
've
formed
my
resolution
,
and
by
God
I
'll
execute
it
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
desperate
being
.
``
I
'll
do
you
a
kindness
in
spite
of
yourself

and
*NL*
Hareton
justice
!
And
you
need
n't
trouble
your
head
to
screen
me
;
*NL*
Catherine
is
gone
.
Nobody
alive
would
regret
me
,
or
be
ashamed
,
though
I
*NL*
cut
my
throat
this
minute
--
and
it
's
time
to
make
an
end
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
might
as
well
have
struggled
with
a
bear
,
or
reasoned
with
a
lunatic
.
*NL*
The
only
resource
left
me
was
to
run
to
a
lattice
and
warn
his
intended
*NL*
victim
of
the
fate
which
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
'd
better
seek
shelter
somewhere
else
to-night
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
in
*NL*
rather
a
triumphant
tone
.
``
Mr.
Earnshaw
has
a
mind
to
shoot
you
,
if
you
*NL*
persist
in
endeavouring
to
enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
'd
better
open
the
door
,
you
--
''
he
answered
,
addressing
me
by
some
*NL*
elegant
term
that
I
do
n't
care
to
repeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
shall
not
meddle
in
the
matter
,
''
I
retorted
again
.
``
Come
in
and
get
*NL*
shot
,
if
you
please
.
I
've
done
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
that
I
shut
the
window
and
returned
to
my
place
by
the
fire
;
having
*NL*
too
small
a
stock
of
hypocrisy
at
my
command
to
pretend
any
anxiety
for
*NL*
the
danger
that
menaced
him
.
Earnshaw
swore
passionately
at
me
:
*NL*
affirming
that
I
loved
the
villain
yet
;
and
calling
me
all
sorts
of
names
*NL*
for
the
base
spirit
I
evinced
.
And
I
,
in
my
secret
heart
-LRB-
and
conscience
*NL*
never
reproached
me
-RRB-
,
thought
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
for
_
him
_
*NL*
should
Heathcliff
put
him
out
of
misery
;
and
what
a
blessing
for
_
me
_
*NL*
should
he
send
Heathcliff
to
his
right
abode
!
As
I
sat
nursing
these
*NL*
reflections
,
the
casement
behind
me
was
banged
on
to
the
floor
by
a
blow
*NL*
from
the
latter
individual
,
and
his
black
countenance
looked
blightingly
*NL*
through
.
The
stanchions
stood
too
close
to
suffer
his
shoulders
to
*NL*
follow
,
and
I
smiled
,
exulting
in
my
fancied
security
.
His
hair
and
*NL*
clothes
were
whitened
with
snow
,
and
his
sharp
cannibal
teeth
,
revealed
*NL*
by
cold
and
wrath
,
gleamed
through
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Isabella
,
let
me
in
,
or
I
'll
make
you
repent
!
''
he
``
girned
,
''
as
Joseph
*NL*
calls
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
can
not
commit
murder
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Mr.
Hindley
stands
sentinel
with
*NL*
a
knife
and
loaded
pistol
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Let
me
in
by
the
kitchen
door
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Hindley
will
be
there
before
me
,
''
I
answered
:
``
and
that
's
a
poor
love
*NL*
of
yours
that
can
not
bear
a
shower
of
snow
!
We
were
left
at
peace
in
our
*NL*
beds
as
long
as
the
summer
moon
shone
,
but
the
moment
a
blast
of
winter
*NL*
returns
,
you
must
run
for
shelter
!
Heathcliff
,
if
I
were
you
,
I
'd
go
*NL*
stretch
myself
over
her
grave
and
die
like
a
faithful
dog
.
The
world
is
*NL*
surely
not
worth
living
in
now
,
is
it
?
You
had
distinctly
impressed
on
*NL*
me
the
idea
that
Catherine
was
the
whole
joy
of
your
life
:
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
how
you
think
of
surviving
her
loss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
's
there
,
is
he
?
''
exclaimed
my
companion
,
rushing
to
the
gap
.
``
If
I
*NL*
can
get
my
arm
out
I
can
hit
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
,
Ellen
,
you
'll
set
me
down
as
really
wicked
;
but
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
all
,
so
do
n't
judge
.
I
would
n't
have
aided
or
abetted
an
attempt
on
*NL*
even
_
his
_
life
for
anything
.
Wish
that
he
were
dead
,
I
must
;
and
*NL*
therefore
I
was
fearfully
disappointed
,
and
unnerved
by
terror
for
the
*NL*
consequences
of
my
taunting
speech
,
when
he
flung
himself
on
Earnshaw
's
*NL*
weapon
and
wrenched
it
from
his
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
charge
exploded
,
and
the
knife
,
in
springing
back
,
closed
into
its
*NL*
owner
's
wrist
.
Heathcliff
pulled
it
away
by
main
force
,
slitting
up
the
*NL*
flesh
as
it
passed
on
,
and
thrust
it
dripping
into
his
pocket
.
He
then
*NL*
took
a
stone
,
struck
down
the
division
between
two
windows
,
and
sprang
*NL*
in
.
His
adversary
had
fallen
senseless
with
excessive
pain
and
the
flow
*NL*
of
blood
,
that
gushed
from
an
artery
or
a
large
vein
.
The
ruffian
kicked
*NL*
and
trampled
on
him
,
and
dashed
his
head
repeatedly
against
the
flags
,
*NL*
holding
me
with
one
hand
,
meantime
,
to
prevent
me
summoning
Joseph
.
He
*NL*
exerted
preterhuman
self-denial
in
abstaining
from
finishing
him
*NL*
completely
;
but
getting
out
of
breath
,
he
finally
desisted
,
and
dragged
*NL*
the
apparently
inanimate
body
on
to
the
settle
.
There
he
tore
off
the
*NL*
sleeve
of
Earnshaw
's
coat
,
and
bound
up
the
wound
with
brutal
roughness
;
*NL*
spitting
and
cursing
during
the
operation
as
energetically
as
he
had
*NL*
kicked
before
.
Being
at
liberty
,
I
lost
no
time
in
seeking
the
old
*NL*
servant
;
who
,
having
gathered
by
degrees
the
purport
of
my
hasty
tale
,
*NL*
hurried
below
,
gasping
,
as
he
descended
the
steps
two
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
is
ther
to
do
,
now
?
what
is
ther
to
do
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
There
's
this
to
do
,
''
thundered
Heathcliff
,
``
that
your
master
's
mad
;
and
*NL*
should
he
last
another
month
,
I
'll
have
him
to
an
asylum
.
And
how
the
*NL*
devil
did
you
come
to
fasten
me
out
,
you
toothless
hound
?
Do
n't
stand
*NL*
muttering
and
mumbling
there
.
Come
,
I
'm
not
going
to
nurse
him
.
Wash
*NL*
that
stuff
away
;
and
mind
the
sparks
of
your
candle
--
it
is
more
than
half
*NL*
brandy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
so
ye
've
been
murthering
on
him
?
''
exclaimed
Joseph
,
lifting
his
*NL*
hands
and
eyes
in
horror
.
``
If
iver
I
seed
a
seeght
loike
this
!
May
the
*NL*
Lord
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
gave
him
a
push
on
to
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
blood
,
*NL*
and
flung
a
towel
to
him
;
but
instead
of
proceeding
to
dry
it
up
,
he
*NL*
joined
his
hands
and
began
a
prayer
,
which
excited
my
laughter
from
its
*NL*
odd
phraseology
.
I
was
in
the
condition
of
mind
to
be
shocked
at
*NL*
nothing
:
in
fact
,
I
was
as
reckless
as
some
malefactors
show
themselves
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Oh
,
I
forgot
you
,
''
said
the
tyrant
.
``
You
shall
do
that
.
Down
with
*NL*
you
.
And
you
conspire
with
him
against
me
,
do
you
,
viper
?
There
,
that
*NL*
is
work
fit
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shook
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
,
and
pitched
me
beside
Joseph
,
who
*NL*
steadily
concluded
his
supplications
,
and
then
rose
,
vowing
he
would
set
*NL*
off
for
the
Grange
directly
.
Mr.
Linton
was
a
magistrate
,
and
though
he
*NL*
had
fifty
wives
dead
,
he
should
inquire
into
this
.
He
was
so
obstinate
*NL*
in
his
resolution
,
that
Heathcliff
deemed
it
expedient
to
compel
from
my
*NL*
lips
a
recapitulation
of
what
had
taken
place
;
standing
over
me
,
heaving
*NL*
with
malevolence
,
as
I
reluctantly
delivered
the
account
in
answer
to
his
*NL*
questions
.
It
required
a
great
deal
of
labour
to
satisfy
the
old
man
*NL*
that
Heathcliff
was
not
the
aggressor
;
especially
with
my
hardly-wrung
*NL*
replies
.
However
,
Mr.
Earnshaw
soon
convinced
him
that
he
was
alive
*NL*
still
;
Joseph
hastened
to
administer
a
dose
of
spirits
,
and
by
their
*NL*
succour
his
master
presently
regained
motion
and
consciousness
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
aware
that
his
opponent
was
ignorant
of
the
treatment
*NL*
received
while
insensible
,
called
him
deliriously
intoxicated
;
and
said
*NL*
he
should
not
notice
his
atrocious
conduct
further
,
but
advised
him
to
*NL*
get
to
bed
.
To
my
joy
,
he
left
us
,
after
giving
this
judicious
counsel
,
*NL*
and
Hindley
stretched
himself
on
the
hearthstone
.
I
departed
to
my
own
*NL*
room
,
marvelling
that
I
had
escaped
so
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
morning
,
when
I
came
down
,
about
half
an
hour
before
noon
,
Mr.
*NL*
Earnshaw
was
sitting
by
the
fire
,
deadly
sick
;
his
evil
genius
,
almost
as
*NL*
gaunt
and
ghastly
,
leant
against
the
chimney
.
Neither
appeared
inclined
*NL*
to
dine
,
and
,
having
waited
till
all
was
cold
on
the
table
,
I
commenced
*NL*
alone
.
Nothing
hindered
me
from
eating
heartily
,
and
I
experienced
a
*NL*
certain
sense
of
satisfaction
and
superiority
,
as
,
at
intervals
,
I
cast
a
*NL*
look
towards
my
silent
companions
,
and
felt
the
comfort
of
a
quiet
*NL*
conscience
within
me
.
After
I
had
done
,
I
ventured
on
the
unusual
*NL*
liberty
of
drawing
near
the
fire
,
going
round
Earnshaw
's
seat
,
and
*NL*
kneeling
in
the
corner
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
did
not
glance
my
way
,
and
I
gazed
up
,
and
contemplated
his
*NL*
features
almost
as
confidently
as
if
they
had
been
turned
to
stone
.
His
*NL*
forehead
,
that
I
once
thought
so
manly
,
and
that
I
now
think
so
*NL*
diabolical
,
was
shaded
with
a
heavy
cloud
;
his
basilisk
eyes
were
nearly
*NL*
quenched
by
sleeplessness
,
and
weeping
,
perhaps
,
for
the
lashes
were
wet
*NL*
then
:
his
lips
devoid
of
their
ferocious
sneer
,
and
sealed
in
an
*NL*
expression
of
unspeakable
sadness
.
Had
it
been
another
,
I
would
have
*NL*
covered
my
face
in
the
presence
of
such
grief
.
In
_
his
_
case
,
I
was
*NL*
gratified
;
and
,
ignoble
as
it
seems
to
insult
a
fallen
enemy
,
I
could
n't
*NL*
miss
this
chance
of
sticking
in
a
dart
:
his
weakness
was
the
only
time
*NL*
when
I
could
taste
the
delight
of
paying
wrong
for
wrong
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fie
,
fie
,
Miss
!
'
I
interrupted
.
`
One
might
suppose
you
had
never
opened
*NL*
a
Bible
in
your
life
.
If
God
afflict
your
enemies
,
surely
that
ought
to
*NL*
suffice
you
.
It
is
both
mean
and
presumptuous
to
add
your
torture
to
*NL*
his
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
general
I
'll
allow
that
it
would
be
,
Ellen
,
'
she
continued
;
`
but
what
*NL*
misery
laid
on
Heathcliff
could
content
me
,
unless
I
have
a
hand
in
it
?
*NL*
I
'd
rather
he
suffered
less
,
if
I
might
cause
his
sufferings
and
he
might
*NL*
_
know
_
that
I
was
the
cause
.
Oh
,
I
owe
him
so
much
.
On
only
one
*NL*
condition
can
I
hope
to
forgive
him
.
It
is
,
if
I
may
take
an
eye
for
an
*NL*
eye
,
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
;
for
every
wrench
of
agony
return
a
wrench
:
*NL*
reduce
him
to
my
level
.
As
he
was
the
first
to
injure
,
make
him
the
*NL*
first
to
implore
pardon
;
and
then
--
why
then
,
Ellen
,
I
might
show
you
some
*NL*
generosity
.
But
it
is
utterly
impossible
I
can
ever
be
revenged
,
and
*NL*
therefore
I
can
not
forgive
him
.
Hindley
wanted
some
water
,
and
I
handed
*NL*
him
a
glass
,
and
asked
him
how
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Not
as
ill
as
I
wish
,
''
he
replied
.
``
But
leaving
out
my
arm
,
every
inch
*NL*
of
me
is
as
sore
as
if
I
had
been
fighting
with
a
legion
of
imps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
,
no
wonder
,
''
was
my
next
remark
.
``
Catherine
used
to
boast
that
she
*NL*
stood
between
you
and
bodily
harm
:
she
meant
that
certain
persons
would
*NL*
not
hurt
you
for
fear
of
offending
her
.
It
's
well
people
do
n't
_
really
_
*NL*
rise
from
their
grave
,
or
,
last
night
,
she
might
have
witnessed
a
*NL*
repulsive
scene
!
Are
not
you
bruised
,
and
cut
over
your
chest
and
*NL*
shoulders
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
ca
n't
say
,
''
he
answered
,
``
but
what
do
you
mean
?
Did
he
dare
to
*NL*
strike
me
when
I
was
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
trampled
on
and
kicked
you
,
and
dashed
you
on
the
ground
,
''
I
*NL*
whispered
.
``
And
his
mouth
watered
to
tear
you
with
his
teeth
;
because
*NL*
he
's
only
half
man
:
not
so
much
,
and
the
rest
fiend

''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Earnshaw
looked
up
,
like
me
,
to
the
countenance
of
our
mutual
foe
;
*NL*
who
,
absorbed
in
his
anguish
,
seemed
insensible
to
anything
around
him
:
*NL*
the
longer
he
stood
,
the
plainer
his
reflections
revealed
their
blackness
*NL*
through
his
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Oh
,
if
God
would
but
give
me
strength
to
strangle
him
in
my
last
agony
,
*NL*
I
'd
go
to
hell
with
joy
,
''
groaned
the
impatient
man
,
writhing
to
rise
,
*NL*
and
sinking
back
in
despair
,
convinced
of
his
inadequacy
for
the
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Nay
,
it
's
enough
that
he
has
murdered
one
of
you
,
''
I
observed
aloud
.
*NL*
``
At
the
Grange
,
every
one
knows
your
sister
would
have
been
living
now
*NL*
had
it
not
been
for
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
After
all
,
it
is
preferable
to
be
*NL*
hated
than
loved
by
him
.
When
I
recollect
how
happy
we
were
--
how
happy
*NL*
Catherine
was
before
he
came
--
I
'm
fit
to
curse
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Most
likely
,
Heathcliff
noticed
more
the
truth
of
what
was
said
,
than
*NL*
the
spirit
of
the
person
who
said
it
.
His
attention
was
roused
,
I
saw
,
*NL*
for
his
eyes
rained
down
tears
among
the
ashes
,
and
he
drew
his
breath
in
*NL*
suffocating
sighs
.
I
stared
full
at
him
,
and
laughed
scornfully
.
The
*NL*
clouded
windows
of
hell
flashed
a
moment
towards
me
;
the
fiend
which
*NL*
usually
looked
out
,
however
,
was
so
dimmed
and
drowned
that
I
did
not
*NL*
fear
to
hazard
another
sound
of
derision
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Get
up
,
and
begone
out
of
my
sight
,
''
said
the
mourner
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
guessed
he
uttered
those
words
,
at
least
,
though
his
voice
was
hardly
*NL*
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
I
replied
.
``
But
I
loved
Catherine
too
;
and
her
*NL*
brother
requires
attendance
,
which
,
for
her
sake
,
I
shall
supply
.
Now
,
*NL*
that
she
's
dead
,
I
see
her
in
Hindley
:
Hindley
has
exactly
her
eyes
,
if
*NL*
you
had
not
tried
to
gouge
them
out
,
and
made
them
black
and
red
;
and
*NL*
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Get
up
,
wretched
idiot
,
before
I
stamp
you
to
death
!
''
he
cried
,
making
*NL*
a
movement
that
caused
me
to
make
one
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
But
then
,
''
I
continued
,
holding
myself
ready
to
flee
,
``
if
poor
*NL*
Catherine
had
trusted
you
,
and
assumed
the
ridiculous
,
contemptible
,
*NL*
degrading
title
of
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
she
would
soon
have
presented
a
*NL*
similar
picture
!
_
She
_
would
n't
have
borne
your
abominable
behaviour
*NL*
quietly
:
her
detestation
and
disgust
must
have
found
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
back
of
the
settle
and
Earnshaw
's
person
interposed
between
me
and
*NL*
him
;
so
instead
of
endeavouring
to
reach
me
,
he
snatched
a
dinner-knife
*NL*
from
the
table
and
flung
it
at
my
head
.
It
struck
beneath
my
ear
,
and
*NL*
stopped
the
sentence
I
was
uttering
;
but
,
pulling
it
out
,
I
sprang
to
the
*NL*
door
and
delivered
another
;
which
I
hope
went
a
little
deeper
than
his
*NL*
missile
.
The
last
glimpse
I
caught
of
him
was
a
furious
rush
on
his
*NL*
part
,
checked
by
the
embrace
of
his
host
;
and
both
fell
locked
together
*NL*
on
the
hearth
.
In
my
flight
through
the
kitchen
I
bid
Joseph
speed
to
*NL*
his
master
;
I
knocked
over
Hareton
,
who
was
hanging
a
litter
of
puppies
*NL*
from
a
chair-back
in
the
doorway
;
and
,
blessed
as
a
soul
escaped
from
*NL*
purgatory
,
I
bounded
,
leaped
,
and
flew
down
the
steep
road
;
then
,
*NL*
quitting
its
windings
,
shot
direct
across
the
moor
,
rolling
over
banks
,
*NL*
and
wading
through
marshes
:
precipitating
myself
,
in
fact
,
towards
the
*NL*
beacon-light
of
the
Grange
.
And
far
rather
would
I
be
condemned
to
a
*NL*
perpetual
dwelling
in
the
infernal
regions
than
,
even
for
one
night
,
*NL*
abide
beneath
the
roof
of
Wuthering
Heights
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Isabella
ceased
speaking
,
and
took
a
drink
of
tea
;
then
she
rose
,
and
*NL*
bidding
me
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
a
great
shawl
I
had
brought
,
and
*NL*
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
my
entreaties
for
her
to
remain
another
hour
,
she
*NL*
stepped
on
to
a
chair
,
kissed
Edgar
's
and
Catherine
's
portraits
,
bestowed
*NL*
a
similar
salute
on
me
,
and
descended
to
the
carriage
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
Fanny
,
who
yelped
wild
with
joy
at
recovering
her
mistress
.
She
was
*NL*
driven
away
,
never
to
revisit
this
neighbourhood
:
but
a
regular
*NL*
correspondence
was
established
between
her
and
my
master
when
things
were
*NL*
more
settled
.
I
believe
her
new
abode
was
in
the
south
,
near
London
;
*NL*
there
she
had
a
son
born
a
few
months
subsequent
to
her
escape
.
He
was
*NL*
christened
Linton
,
and
,
from
the
first
,
she
reported
him
to
be
an
ailing
,
*NL*
peevish
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
meeting
me
one
day
in
the
village
,
inquired
where
she
*NL*
lived
.
I
refused
to
tell
.
He
remarked
that
it
was
not
of
any
moment
,
*NL*
only
she
must
beware
of
coming
to
her
brother
:
she
should
not
be
with
*NL*
him
,
if
he
had
to
keep
her
himself
.
Though
I
would
give
no
information
,
*NL*
he
discovered
,
through
some
of
the
other
servants
,
both
her
place
of
*NL*
residence
and
the
existence
of
the
child
.
Still
,
he
did
n't
molest
her
:
*NL*
for
which
forbearance
she
might
thank
his
aversion
,
I
suppose
.
He
often
*NL*
asked
about
the
infant
,
when
he
saw
me
;
and
on
hearing
its
name
,
smiled
*NL*
grimly
,
and
observed
:
`
They
wish
me
to
hate
it
too
,
do
they
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
they
wish
you
to
know
anything
about
it
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
'll
have
it
,
'
he
said
,
`
when
I
want
it
.
They
may
reckon
on
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
its
mother
died
before
the
time
arrived
;
some
thirteen
years
*NL*
after
the
decease
of
Catherine
,
when
Linton
was
twelve
,
or
a
little
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
succeeding
Isabella
's
unexpected
visit
I
had
no
opportunity
of
*NL*
speaking
to
my
master
:
he
shunned
conversation
,
and
was
fit
for
*NL*
discussing
nothing
.
When
I
could
get
him
to
listen
,
I
saw
it
pleased
him
*NL*
that
his
sister
had
left
her
husband
;
whom
he
abhorred
with
an
intensity
*NL*
which
the
mildness
of
his
nature
would
scarcely
seem
to
allow
.
So
deep
*NL*
and
sensitive
was
his
aversion
,
that
he
refrained
from
going
anywhere
*NL*
where
he
was
likely
to
see
or
hear
of
Heathcliff
.
Grief
,
and
that
*NL*
together
,
transformed
him
into
a
complete
hermit
:
he
threw
up
his
office
*NL*
of
magistrate
,
ceased
even
to
attend
church
,
avoided
the
village
on
all
*NL*
occasions
,
and
spent
a
life
of
entire
seclusion
within
the
limits
of
his
*NL*
park
and
grounds
;
only
varied
by
solitary
rambles
on
the
moors
,
and
*NL*
visits
to
the
grave
of
his
wife
,
mostly
at
evening
,
or
early
morning
*NL*
before
other
wanderers
were
abroad
.
But
he
was
too
good
to
be
thoroughly
*NL*
unhappy
long
.
_
He
_
did
n't
pray
for
Catherine
's
soul
to
haunt
him
.
Time
*NL*
brought
resignation
,
and
a
melancholy
sweeter
than
common
joy
.
He
*NL*
recalled
her
memory
with
ardent
,
tender
love
,
and
hopeful
aspiring
to
the
*NL*
better
world
;
where
he
doubted
not
she
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
earthly
consolation
and
affections
also
.
For
a
few
days
,
I
*NL*
said
,
he
seemed
regardless
of
the
puny
successor
to
the
departed
:
that
*NL*
coldness
melted
as
fast
as
snow
in
April
,
and
ere
the
tiny
thing
could
*NL*
stammer
a
word
or
totter
a
step
it
wielded
a
despot
's
sceptre
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
It
was
named
Catherine
;
but
he
never
called
it
the
name
in
full
,
*NL*
as
he
had
never
called
the
first
Catherine
short
:
probably
because
*NL*
Heathcliff
had
a
habit
of
doing
so
.
The
little
one
was
always
Cathy
:
it
*NL*
formed
to
him
a
distinction
from
the
mother
,
and
yet
a
connection
with
*NL*
her
;
and
his
attachment
sprang
from
its
relation
to
her
,
far
more
than
*NL*
from
its
being
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
to
draw
a
comparison
between
him
and
Hindley
Earnshaw
,
and
perplex
*NL*
myself
to
explain
satisfactorily
why
their
conduct
was
so
opposite
in
*NL*
similar
circumstances
.
They
had
both
been
fond
husbands
,
and
were
both
*NL*
attached
to
their
children
;
and
I
could
not
see
how
they
should
n't
both
*NL*
have
taken
the
same
road
,
for
good
or
evil
.
But
,
I
thought
in
my
mind
,
*NL*
Hindley
,
with
apparently
the
stronger
head
,
has
shown
himself
sadly
the
*NL*
worse
and
the
weaker
man
.
When
his
ship
struck
,
the
captain
abandoned
*NL*
his
post
;
and
the
crew
,
instead
of
trying
to
save
her
,
rushed
into
riot
*NL*
and
confusion
,
leaving
no
hope
for
their
luckless
vessel
.
Linton
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
displayed
the
true
courage
of
a
loyal
and
faithful
soul
:
he
*NL*
trusted
God
;
and
God
comforted
him
.
One
hoped
,
and
the
other
despaired
:
*NL*
they
chose
their
own
lots
,
and
were
righteously
doomed
to
endure
them
.
*NL*
But
you
'll
not
want
to
hear
my
moralising
,
Mr.
Lockwood
;
you
'll
judge
,
as
*NL*
well
as
I
can
,
all
these
things
:
at
least
,
you
'll
think
you
will
,
and
*NL*
that
's
the
same
.
The
end
of
Earnshaw
was
what
might
have
been
expected
;
*NL*
it
followed
fast
on
his
sister
's
:
there
were
scarcely
six
months
between
*NL*
them
.
We
,
at
the
Grange
,
never
got
a
very
succinct
account
of
his
state
*NL*
preceding
it
;
all
that
I
did
learn
was
on
occasion
of
going
to
aid
in
the
*NL*
preparations
for
the
funeral
.
Mr.
Kenneth
came
to
announce
the
event
to
*NL*
my
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Nelly
,
'
said
he
,
riding
into
the
yard
one
morning
,
too
early
not
*NL*
to
alarm
me
with
an
instant
presentiment
of
bad
news
,
`
it
's
yours
and
my
*NL*
turn
to
go
into
mourning
at
present
.
Who
's
given
us
the
slip
now
,
do
you
*NL*
think
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
?
'
I
asked
in
a
flurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
guess
!
'
he
returned
,
dismounting
,
and
slinging
his
bridle
on
a
hook
*NL*
by
the
door
.
`
And
nip
up
the
corner
of
your
apron
:
I
'm
certain
you
'll
*NL*
need
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
surely
?
'
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
!
would
you
have
tears
for
him
?
'
said
the
doctor
.
`
No
,
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
a
tough
young
fellow
:
he
looks
blooming
to-day
.
I
've
just
seen
him
.
He
's
*NL*
rapidly
regaining
flesh
since
he
lost
his
better
half
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
it
,
then
,
Mr.
Kenneth
?
'
I
repeated
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hindley
Earnshaw
!
Your
old
friend
Hindley
,
'
he
replied
,
`
and
my
wicked
*NL*
gossip
:
though
he
's
been
too
wild
for
me
this
long
while
.
There
!
I
said
*NL*
we
should
draw
water
.
But
cheer
up
!
He
died
true
to
his
character
:
*NL*
drunk
as
a
lord
.
Poor
lad
!
I
'm
sorry
,
too
.
One
ca
n't
help
missing
an
*NL*
old
companion
:
though
he
had
the
worst
tricks
with
him
that
ever
man
*NL*
imagined
,
and
has
done
me
many
a
rascally
turn
.
He
's
barely
*NL*
twenty-seven
,
it
seems
;
that
's
your
own
age
:
who
would
have
thought
you
*NL*
were
born
in
one
year
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
confess
this
blow
was
greater
to
me
than
the
shock
of
Mrs.
Linton
's
*NL*
death
:
ancient
associations
lingered
round
my
heart
;
I
sat
down
in
the
*NL*
porch
and
wept
as
for
a
blood
relation
,
desiring
Mr.
Kenneth
to
get
*NL*
another
servant
to
introduce
him
to
the
master
.
I
could
not
hinder
*NL*
myself
from
pondering
on
the
question
--
`
Had
he
had
fair
play
?
'
Whatever
*NL*
I
did
,
that
idea
would
bother
me
:
it
was
so
tiresomely
pertinacious
that
*NL*
I
resolved
on
requesting
leave
to
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
and
assist
in
*NL*
the
last
duties
to
the
dead
.
Mr.
Linton
was
extremely
reluctant
to
*NL*
consent
,
but
I
pleaded
eloquently
for
the
friendless
condition
in
which
*NL*
he
lay
;
and
I
said
my
old
master
and
foster-brother
had
a
claim
on
my
*NL*
services
as
strong
as
his
own
.
Besides
,
I
reminded
him
that
the
child
*NL*
Hareton
was
his
wife
's
nephew
,
and
,
in
the
absence
of
nearer
kin
,
he
*NL*
ought
to
act
as
its
guardian
;
and
he
ought
to
and
must
inquire
how
the
*NL*
property
was
left
,
and
look
over
the
concerns
of
his
brother-in-law
.
He
*NL*
was
unfit
for
attending
to
such
matters
then
,
but
he
bid
me
speak
to
his
*NL*
lawyer
;
and
at
length
permitted
me
to
go
.
His
lawyer
had
been
Earnshaw
's
*NL*
also
:
I
called
at
the
village
,
and
asked
him
to
accompany
me
.
He
shook
*NL*
his
head
,
and
advised
that
Heathcliff
should
be
let
alone
;
affirming
,
if
*NL*
the
truth
were
known
,
Hareton
would
be
found
little
else
than
a
beggar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
father
died
in
debt
,
'
he
said
;
`
the
whole
property
is
mortgaged
,
and
*NL*
the
sole
chance
for
the
natural
heir
is
to
allow
him
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
creating
some
interest
in
the
creditor
's
heart
,
that
he
may
be
inclined
*NL*
to
deal
leniently
towards
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
reached
the
Heights
,
I
explained
that
I
had
come
to
see
everything
*NL*
carried
on
decently
;
and
Joseph
,
who
appeared
in
sufficient
distress
,
*NL*
expressed
satisfaction
at
my
presence
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
said
he
did
not
*NL*
perceive
that
I
was
wanted
;
but
I
might
stay
and
order
the
arrangements
*NL*
for
the
funeral
,
if
I
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Correctly
,
'
he
remarked
,
`
that
fool
's
body
should
be
buried
at
the
*NL*
cross-roads
,
without
ceremony
of
any
kind
.
I
happened
to
leave
him
ten
*NL*
minutes
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
in
that
interval
he
fastened
the
two
*NL*
doors
of
the
house
against
me
,
and
he
has
spent
the
night
in
drinking
*NL*
himself
to
death
deliberately
!
We
broke
in
this
morning
,
for
we
heard
*NL*
him
sporting
like
a
horse
;
and
there
he
was
,
laid
over
the
settle
:
*NL*
flaying
and
scalping
would
not
have
wakened
him
.
I
sent
for
Kenneth
,
and
*NL*
he
came
;
but
not
till
the
beast
had
changed
into
carrion
:
he
was
both
*NL*
dead
and
cold
,
and
stark
;
and
so
you
'll
allow
it
was
useless
making
more
*NL*
stir
about
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
servant
confirmed
this
statement
,
but
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
rayther
he
'd
goan
hisseln
for
t
'
doctor
!
I
sud
ha
'
taen
tent
o
'
t
'
*NL*
maister
better
nor
him
--
and
he
war
n't
deead
when
I
left
,
naught
o
'
t
'
*NL*
soart
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
insisted
on
the
funeral
being
respectable
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
said
I
might
*NL*
have
my
own
way
there
too
:
only
,
he
desired
me
to
remember
that
the
money
*NL*
for
the
whole
affair
came
out
of
his
pocket
.
He
maintained
a
hard
,
*NL*
careless
deportment
,
indicative
of
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
:
if
anything
,
*NL*
it
expressed
a
flinty
gratification
at
a
piece
of
difficult
work
*NL*
successfully
executed
.
I
observed
once
,
indeed
,
something
like
*NL*
exultation
in
his
aspect
:
it
was
just
when
the
people
were
bearing
the
*NL*
coffin
from
the
house
.
He
had
the
hypocrisy
to
represent
a
mourner
:
and
*NL*
previous
to
following
with
Hareton
,
he
lifted
the
unfortunate
child
on
to
*NL*
the
table
and
muttered
,
with
peculiar
gusto
,
`
Now
,
my
bonny
lad
,
you
are
*NL*
_
mine
_
!
And
we
'll
see
if
one
tree
wo
n't
grow
as
crooked
as
another
,
with
*NL*
the
same
wind
to
twist
it
!
'
The
unsuspecting
thing
was
pleased
at
this
*NL*
speech
:
he
played
with
Heathcliff
's
whiskers
,
and
stroked
his
cheek
;
but
*NL*
I
divined
its
meaning
,
and
observed
tartly
,
`
That
boy
must
go
back
with
*NL*
me
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
sir
.
There
is
nothing
in
the
world
less
yours
*NL*
than
he
is
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Does
Linton
say
so
?
'
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
--
he
has
ordered
me
to
take
him
,
'
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
the
scoundrel
,
`
we
'll
not
argue
the
subject
now
:
but
I
have
*NL*
a
fancy
to
try
my
hand
at
rearing
a
young
one
;
so
intimate
to
your
master
*NL*
that
I
must
supply
the
place
of
this
with
my
own
,
if
he
attempt
to
remove
*NL*
it
.
I
do
n't
engage
to
let
Hareton
go
undisputed
;
but
I
'll
be
pretty
sure
*NL*
to
make
the
other
come
!
Remember
to
tell
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
hint
was
enough
to
bind
our
hands
.
I
repeated
its
substance
on
my
*NL*
return
;
and
Edgar
Linton
,
little
interested
at
the
commencement
,
spoke
no
*NL*
more
of
interfering
.
I
'm
not
aware
that
he
could
have
done
it
to
any
*NL*
purpose
,
had
he
been
ever
so
willing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guest
was
now
the
master
of
Wuthering
Heights
:
he
held
firm
*NL*
possession
,
and
proved
to
the
attorney
--
who
,
in
his
turn
,
proved
it
to
*NL*
Mr.
Linton
--
that
Earnshaw
had
mortgaged
every
yard
of
land
he
owned
for
*NL*
cash
to
supply
his
mania
for
gaming
;
and
he
,
Heathcliff
,
was
the
*NL*
mortgagee
.
In
that
manner
Hareton
,
who
should
now
be
the
first
gentleman
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
,
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
dependence
on
*NL*
his
father
's
inveterate
enemy
;
and
lives
in
his
own
house
as
a
servant
,
*NL*
deprived
of
the
advantage
of
wages
:
quite
unable
to
right
himself
,
*NL*
because
of
his
friendlessness
,
and
his
ignorance
that
he
has
been
*NL*
wronged
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
twelve
years
,
continued
Mrs.
Dean
,
following
that
dismal
period
were
*NL*
the
happiest
of
my
life
:
my
greatest
troubles
in
their
passage
rose
from
*NL*
our
little
lady
's
trifling
illnesses
,
which
she
had
to
experience
in
*NL*
common
with
all
children
,
rich
and
poor
.
For
the
rest
,
after
the
first
*NL*
six
months
,
she
grew
like
a
larch
,
and
could
walk
and
talk
too
,
in
her
*NL*
own
way
,
before
the
heath
blossomed
a
second
time
over
Mrs.
Linton
's
*NL*
dust
.
She
was
the
most
winning
thing
that
ever
brought
sunshine
into
a
*NL*
desolate
house
:
a
real
beauty
in
face
,
with
the
Earnshaws
'
handsome
dark
*NL*
eyes
,
but
the
Lintons
'
fair
skin
and
small
features
,
and
yellow
curling
*NL*
hair
.
Her
spirit
was
high
,
though
not
rough
,
and
qualified
by
a
heart
*NL*
sensitive
and
lively
to
excess
in
its
affections
.
That
capacity
for
*NL*
intense
attachments
reminded
me
of
her
mother
:
still
she
did
not
resemble
*NL*
her
:
for
she
could
be
soft
and
mild
as
a
dove
,
and
she
had
a
gentle
voice
*NL*
and
pensive
expression
:
her
anger
was
never
furious
;
her
love
never
*NL*
fierce
:
it
was
deep
and
tender
.
However
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
,
she
*NL*
had
faults
to
foil
her
gifts
.
A
propensity
to
be
saucy
was
one
;
and
a
*NL*
perverse
will
,
that
indulged
children
invariably
acquire
,
whether
they
be
*NL*
good
tempered
or
cross
.
If
a
servant
chanced
to
vex
her
,
it
was
*NL*
always
--
'
I
shall
tell
papa
!
'
And
if
he
reproved
her
,
even
by
a
look
,
you
*NL*
would
have
thought
it
a
heart-breaking
business
:
I
do
n't
believe
he
ever
*NL*
did
speak
a
harsh
word
to
her
.
He
took
her
education
entirely
on
*NL*
himself
,
and
made
it
an
amusement
.
Fortunately
,
curiosity
and
a
quick
*NL*
intellect
made
her
an
apt
scholar
:
she
learned
rapidly
and
eagerly
,
and
*NL*
did
honour
to
his
teaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
she
reached
the
age
of
thirteen
she
had
not
once
been
beyond
the
*NL*
range
of
the
park
by
herself
.
Mr.
Linton
would
take
her
with
him
a
mile
*NL*
or
so
outside
,
on
rare
occasions
;
but
he
trusted
her
to
no
one
else
.
*NL*
Gimmerton
was
an
unsubstantial
name
in
her
ears
;
the
chapel
,
the
only
*NL*
building
she
had
approached
or
entered
,
except
her
own
home
.
Wuthering
*NL*
Heights
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
did
not
exist
for
her
:
she
was
a
perfect
*NL*
recluse
;
and
,
apparently
,
perfectly
contented
.
Sometimes
,
indeed
,
while
*NL*
surveying
the
country
from
her
nursery
window
,
she
would
observe
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
how
long
will
it
be
before
I
can
walk
to
the
top
of
those
hills
?
*NL*
I
wonder
what
lies
on
the
other
side
--
is
it
the
sea
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Miss
Cathy
,
'
I
would
answer
;
`
it
is
hills
again
,
just
like
these
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
are
those
golden
rocks
like
when
you
stand
under
them
?
'
she
*NL*
once
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abrupt
descent
of
Penistone
Crags
particularly
attracted
her
notice
;
*NL*
especially
when
the
setting
sun
shone
on
it
and
the
topmost
heights
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
extent
of
landscape
besides
lay
in
shadow
.
I
explained
that
*NL*
they
were
bare
masses
of
stone
,
with
hardly
enough
earth
in
their
clefts
*NL*
to
nourish
a
stunted
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
why
are
they
bright
so
long
after
it
is
evening
here
?
'
she
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
they
are
a
great
deal
higher
up
than
we
are
,
'
replied
I
;
`
you
*NL*
could
not
climb
them
,
they
are
too
high
and
steep
.
In
winter
the
frost
*NL*
is
always
there
before
it
comes
to
us
;
and
deep
into
summer
I
have
found
*NL*
snow
under
that
black
hollow
on
the
north-east
side
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
have
been
on
them
!
'
she
cried
gleefully
.
`
Then
I
can
go
,
too
,
*NL*
when
I
am
a
woman
.
Has
papa
been
,
Ellen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Papa
would
tell
you
,
Miss
,
'
I
answered
,
hastily
,
`
that
they
are
not
*NL*
worth
the
trouble
of
visiting
.
The
moors
,
where
you
ramble
with
him
,
are
*NL*
much
nicer
;
and
Thrushcross
Park
is
the
finest
place
in
the
world
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
know
the
park
,
and
I
do
n't
know
those
,
'
she
murmured
to
herself
.
*NL*
`
And
I
should
delight
to
look
round
me
from
the
brow
of
that
tallest
*NL*
point
:
my
little
pony
Minny
shall
take
me
some
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
maids
mentioning
the
Fairy
Cave
,
quite
turned
her
head
with
a
*NL*
desire
to
fulfil
this
project
:
she
teased
Mr.
Linton
about
it
;
and
he
*NL*
promised
she
should
have
the
journey
when
she
got
older
.
But
Miss
*NL*
Catherine
measured
her
age
by
months
,
and
,
`
Now
,
am
I
old
enough
to
go
to
*NL*
Penistone
Crags
?
'
was
the
constant
question
in
her
mouth
.
The
road
*NL*
thither
wound
close
by
Wuthering
Heights
.
Edgar
had
not
the
heart
to
*NL*
pass
it
;
so
she
received
as
constantly
the
answer
,
`
Not
yet
,
love
:
not
*NL*
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
Mrs.
Heathcliff
lived
above
a
dozen
years
after
quitting
her
*NL*
husband
.
Her
family
were
of
a
delicate
constitution
:
she
and
Edgar
both
*NL*
lacked
the
ruddy
health
that
you
will
generally
meet
in
these
parts
.
What
*NL*
her
last
illness
was
,
I
am
not
certain
:
I
conjecture
,
they
died
of
the
*NL*
same
thing
,
a
kind
of
fever
,
slow
at
its
commencement
,
but
incurable
,
and
*NL*
rapidly
consuming
life
towards
the
close
.
She
wrote
to
inform
her
*NL*
brother
of
the
probable
conclusion
of
a
four-months
'
indisposition
under
*NL*
which
she
had
suffered
,
and
entreated
him
to
come
to
her
,
if
possible
;
*NL*
for
she
had
much
to
settle
,
and
she
wished
to
bid
him
adieu
,
and
deliver
*NL*
Linton
safely
into
his
hands
.
Her
hope
was
that
Linton
might
be
left
*NL*
with
him
,
as
he
had
been
with
her
:
his
father
,
she
would
fain
convince
*NL*
herself
,
had
no
desire
to
assume
the
burden
of
his
maintenance
or
*NL*
education
.
My
master
hesitated
not
a
moment
in
complying
with
her
*NL*
request
:
reluctant
as
he
was
to
leave
home
at
ordinary
calls
,
he
flew
to
*NL*
answer
this
;
commanding
Catherine
to
my
peculiar
vigilance
,
in
his
*NL*
absence
,
with
reiterated
orders
that
she
must
not
wander
out
of
the
park
,
*NL*
even
under
my
escort
he
did
not
calculate
on
her
going
unaccompanied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
away
three
weeks
.
The
first
day
or
two
my
charge
sat
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
library
,
too
sad
for
either
reading
or
playing
:
in
that
quiet
*NL*
state
she
caused
me
little
trouble
;
but
it
was
succeeded
by
an
interval
*NL*
of
impatient
,
fretful
weariness
;
and
being
too
busy
,
and
too
old
then
,
to
*NL*
run
up
and
down
amusing
her
,
I
hit
on
a
method
by
which
she
might
*NL*
entertain
herself
.
I
used
to
send
her
on
her
travels
round
the
*NL*
grounds
--
now
on
foot
,
and
now
on
a
pony
;
indulging
her
with
a
patient
*NL*
audience
of
all
her
real
and
imaginary
adventures
when
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
shone
in
full
prime
;
and
she
took
such
a
taste
for
this
*NL*
solitary
rambling
that
she
often
contrived
to
remain
out
from
breakfast
*NL*
till
tea
;
and
then
the
evenings
were
spent
in
recounting
her
fanciful
*NL*
tales
.
I
did
not
fear
her
breaking
bounds
;
because
the
gates
were
*NL*
generally
locked
,
and
I
thought
she
would
scarcely
venture
forth
alone
,
*NL*
if
they
had
stood
wide
open
.
Unluckily
,
my
confidence
proved
misplaced
.
*NL*
Catherine
came
to
me
,
one
morning
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
said
she
was
*NL*
that
day
an
Arabian
merchant
,
going
to
cross
the
Desert
with
his
caravan
;
*NL*
and
I
must
give
her
plenty
of
provision
for
herself
and
beasts
:
a
horse
,
*NL*
and
three
camels
,
personated
by
a
large
hound
and
a
couple
of
pointers
.
I
*NL*
got
together
good
store
of
dainties
,
and
slung
them
in
a
basket
on
one
*NL*
side
of
the
saddle
;
and
she
sprang
up
as
gay
as
a
fairy
,
sheltered
by
her
*NL*
wide-brimmed
hat
and
gauze
veil
from
the
July
sun
,
and
trotted
off
with
a
*NL*
merry
laugh
,
mocking
my
cautious
counsel
to
avoid
galloping
,
and
come
*NL*
back
early
.
The
naughty
thing
never
made
her
appearance
at
tea
.
One
*NL*
traveller
,
the
hound
,
being
an
old
dog
and
fond
of
its
ease
,
returned
;
*NL*
but
neither
Cathy
,
nor
the
pony
,
nor
the
two
pointers
were
visible
in
any
*NL*
direction
:
I
despatched
emissaries
down
this
path
,
and
that
path
,
and
at
*NL*
last
went
wandering
in
search
of
her
myself
.
There
was
a
labourer
*NL*
working
at
a
fence
round
a
plantation
,
on
the
borders
of
the
grounds
.
I
*NL*
inquired
of
him
if
he
had
seen
our
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
saw
her
at
morn
,
'
he
replied
:
`
she
would
have
me
to
cut
her
a
hazel
*NL*
switch
,
and
then
she
leapt
her
Galloway
over
the
hedge
yonder
,
where
it
*NL*
is
lowest
,
and
galloped
out
of
sight
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
You
may
guess
how
I
felt
at
hearing
this
news
.
It
struck
me
directly
she
*NL*
must
have
started
for
Penistone
Crags
.
`
What
will
become
of
her
?
'
I
*NL*
ejaculated
,
pushing
through
a
gap
which
the
man
was
repairing
,
and
making
*NL*
straight
to
the
high-road
.
I
walked
as
if
for
a
wager
,
mile
after
mile
,
*NL*
till
a
turn
brought
me
in
view
of
the
Heights
;
but
no
Catherine
could
I
*NL*
detect
,
far
or
near
.
The
Crags
lie
about
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
place
,
and
that
is
four
from
the
Grange
,
so
I
began
to
fear
*NL*
night
would
fall
ere
I
could
reach
them
.
`
And
what
if
she
should
have
*NL*
slipped
in
clambering
among
them
,
'
I
reflected
,
`
and
been
killed
,
or
*NL*
broken
some
of
her
bones
?
'
My
suspense
was
truly
painful
;
and
,
at
first
,
*NL*
it
gave
me
delightful
relief
to
observe
,
in
hurrying
by
the
farmhouse
,
*NL*
Charlie
,
the
fiercest
of
the
pointers
,
lying
under
a
window
,
with
swelled
*NL*
head
and
bleeding
ear
.
I
opened
the
wicket
and
ran
to
the
door
,
knocking
*NL*
vehemently
for
admittance
.
A
woman
whom
I
knew
,
and
who
formerly
lived
*NL*
at
Gimmerton
,
answered
:
she
had
been
servant
there
since
the
death
of
Mr.
*NL*
Earnshaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
'
said
she
,
`
you
are
come
a-seeking
your
little
mistress
!
Do
n't
be
*NL*
frightened
.
She
's
here
safe
:
but
I
'm
glad
it
is
n't
the
master
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
is
not
at
home
then
,
is
he
?
'
I
panted
,
quite
breathless
with
quick
*NL*
walking
and
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
she
replied
:
`
both
he
and
Joseph
are
off
,
and
I
think
they
*NL*
wo
n't
return
this
hour
or
more
.
Step
in
and
rest
you
a
bit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
entered
,
and
beheld
my
stray
lamb
seated
on
the
hearth
,
rocking
herself
*NL*
in
a
little
chair
that
had
been
her
mother
's
when
a
child
.
Her
hat
was
*NL*
hung
against
the
wall
,
and
she
seemed
perfectly
at
home
,
laughing
and
*NL*
chattering
,
in
the
best
spirits
imaginable
,
to
Hareton
--
now
a
great
,
*NL*
strong
lad
of
eighteen
--
who
stared
at
her
with
considerable
curiosity
and
*NL*
astonishment
:
comprehending
precious
little
of
the
fluent
succession
of
*NL*
remarks
and
questions
which
her
tongue
never
ceased
pouring
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
,
Miss
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
concealing
my
joy
under
an
angry
*NL*
countenance
.
`
This
is
your
last
ride
,
till
papa
comes
back
.
I
'll
not
*NL*
trust
you
over
the
threshold
again
,
you
naughty
,
naughty
girl
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
,
Ellen
!
'
she
cried
,
gaily
,
jumping
up
and
running
to
my
side
.
'
I
*NL*
shall
have
a
pretty
story
to
tell
to-night
;
and
so
you
've
found
me
out
.
*NL*
Have
you
ever
been
here
in
your
life
before
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
that
hat
on
,
and
home
at
once
,
'
said
I.
`
I
'm
dreadfully
grieved
at
*NL*
you
,
Miss
Cathy
:
you
've
done
extremely
wrong
!
It
's
no
use
pouting
and
*NL*
crying
:
that
wo
n't
repay
the
trouble
I
've
had
,
scouring
the
country
after
*NL*
you
.
To
think
how
Mr.
Linton
charged
me
to
keep
you
in
;
and
you
stealing
*NL*
off
so
!
It
shows
you
are
a
cunning
little
fox
,
and
nobody
will
put
faith
*NL*
in
you
any
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
have
I
done
?
'
sobbed
she
,
instantly
checked
.
`
Papa
charged
me
*NL*
nothing
:
he
'll
not
scold
me
,
Ellen
--
he
's
never
cross
,
like
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
!
'
I
repeated
.
`
I
'll
tie
the
riband
.
Now
,
let
us
have
no
*NL*
petulance
.
Oh
,
for
shame
!
You
thirteen
years
old
,
and
such
a
baby
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
exclamation
was
caused
by
her
pushing
the
hat
from
her
head
,
and
*NL*
retreating
to
the
chimney
out
of
my
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
said
the
servant
,
`
do
n't
be
hard
on
the
bonny
lass
,
Mrs.
Dean
.
We
*NL*
made
her
stop
:
she
'd
fain
have
ridden
forwards
,
afeard
you
should
be
*NL*
uneasy
.
Hareton
offered
to
go
with
her
,
and
I
thought
he
should
:
it
's
a
*NL*
wild
road
over
the
hills
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
,
during
the
discussion
,
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
too
*NL*
awkward
to
speak
;
though
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
relish
my
intrusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long
am
I
to
wait
?
'
I
continued
,
disregarding
the
woman
's
*NL*
interference
.
`
It
will
be
dark
in
ten
minutes
.
Where
is
the
pony
,
Miss
*NL*
Cathy
?
And
where
is
Phoenix
?
I
shall
leave
you
,
unless
you
be
quick
;
so
*NL*
please
yourself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
pony
is
in
the
yard
,
'
she
replied
,
`
and
Phoenix
is
shut
in
there
.
*NL*
He
's
bitten
--
and
so
is
Charlie
.
I
was
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
;
*NL*
but
you
are
in
a
bad
temper
,
and
do
n't
deserve
to
hear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
picked
up
her
hat
,
and
approached
to
reinstate
it
;
but
perceiving
that
*NL*
the
people
of
the
house
took
her
part
,
she
commenced
capering
round
the
*NL*
room
;
and
on
my
giving
chase
,
ran
like
a
mouse
over
and
under
and
behind
*NL*
the
furniture
,
rendering
it
ridiculous
for
me
to
pursue
.
Hareton
and
the
*NL*
woman
laughed
,
and
she
joined
them
,
and
waxed
more
impertinent
still
;
*NL*
till
I
cried
,
in
great
irritation
,
--
`
Well
,
Miss
Cathy
,
if
you
were
aware
*NL*
whose
house
this
is
you
'd
be
glad
enough
to
get
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
_
your
_
father
's
,
is
n't
it
?
'
said
she
,
turning
to
Hareton
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
he
replied
,
looking
down
,
and
blushing
bashfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
stand
a
steady
gaze
from
her
eyes
,
though
they
were
just
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whose
then
--
your
master
's
?
'
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
deeper
,
with
a
different
feeling
,
muttered
an
oath
,
and
*NL*
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
his
master
?
'
continued
the
tiresome
girl
,
appealing
to
me
.
`
He
*NL*
talked
about
``
our
house
,
''
and
``
our
folk
.
''
I
thought
he
had
been
the
*NL*
owner
's
son
.
And
he
never
said
Miss
:
he
should
have
done
,
should
n't
he
,
*NL*
if
he
's
a
servant
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
grew
black
as
a
thunder-cloud
at
this
childish
speech
.
I
*NL*
silently
shook
my
questioner
,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
equipping
her
for
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
get
my
horse
,
'
she
said
,
addressing
her
unknown
kinsman
as
she
*NL*
would
one
of
the
stable-boys
at
the
Grange
.
`
And
you
may
come
with
me
.
I
*NL*
want
to
see
where
the
goblin-hunter
rises
in
the
marsh
,
and
to
hear
about
*NL*
the
_
fairishes
_
,
as
you
call
them
:
but
make
haste
!
What
's
the
matter
?
*NL*
Get
my
horse
,
I
say
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
see
thee
damned
before
I
be
_
thy
_
servant
!
'
growled
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
see
me
_
what
_
!
'
asked
Catherine
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Damned
--
thou
saucy
witch
!
'
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
,
Miss
Cathy
!
you
see
you
have
got
into
pretty
company
,
'
I
*NL*
interposed
.
`
Nice
words
to
be
used
to
a
young
lady
!
Pray
do
n't
begin
to
*NL*
dispute
with
him
.
Come
,
let
us
seek
for
Minny
ourselves
,
and
begone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
Ellen
,
'
cried
she
,
staring
fixed
in
astonishment
,
`
how
dare
he
*NL*
speak
so
to
me
?
Must
n't
he
be
made
to
do
as
I
ask
him
?
You
wicked
*NL*
creature
,
I
shall
tell
papa
what
you
said
.
--
Now
,
then
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
did
not
appear
to
feel
this
threat
;
so
the
tears
sprang
into
her
*NL*
eyes
with
indignation
.
`
You
bring
the
pony
,
'
she
exclaimed
,
turning
to
*NL*
the
woman
,
`
and
let
my
dog
free
this
moment
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Softly
,
Miss
,
'
answered
she
addressed
;
`
you
'll
lose
nothing
by
being
*NL*
civil
.
Though
Mr.
Hareton
,
there
,
be
not
the
master
's
son
,
he
's
your
*NL*
cousin
:
and
I
was
never
hired
to
serve
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
He
_
my
cousin
!
'
cried
Cathy
,
with
a
scornful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
indeed
,
'
responded
her
reprover
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Ellen
!
do
n't
let
them
say
such
things
,
'
she
pursued
in
great
*NL*
trouble
.
`
Papa
is
gone
to
fetch
my
cousin
from
London
:
my
cousin
is
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
son
.
That
my
--
'
she
stopped
,
and
wept
outright
;
upset
at
the
*NL*
bare
notion
of
relationship
with
such
a
clown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
hush
!
'
I
whispered
;
`
people
can
have
many
cousins
and
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
Miss
Cathy
,
without
being
any
the
worse
for
it
;
only
they
need
n't
*NL*
keep
their
company
,
if
they
be
disagreeable
and
bad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
not
--
he
's
not
my
cousin
,
Ellen
!
'
she
went
on
,
gathering
fresh
grief
*NL*
from
reflection
,
and
flinging
herself
into
my
arms
for
refuge
from
the
*NL*
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
much
vexed
at
her
and
the
servant
for
their
mutual
revelations
;
*NL*
having
no
doubt
of
Linton
's
approaching
arrival
,
communicated
by
the
*NL*
former
,
being
reported
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
;
and
feeling
as
confident
that
*NL*
Catherine
's
first
thought
on
her
father
's
return
would
be
to
seek
an
*NL*
explanation
of
the
latter
's
assertion
concerning
her
rude-bred
kindred
.
*NL*
Hareton
,
recovering
from
his
disgust
at
being
taken
for
a
servant
,
seemed
*NL*
moved
by
her
distress
;
and
,
having
fetched
the
pony
round
to
the
door
,
he
*NL*
took
,
to
propitiate
her
,
a
fine
crooked-legged
terrier
whelp
from
the
*NL*
kennel
,
and
putting
it
into
her
hand
,
bid
her
whist
!
for
he
meant
nought
.
*NL*
Pausing
in
her
lamentations
,
she
surveyed
him
with
a
glance
of
awe
and
*NL*
horror
,
then
burst
forth
anew
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
scarcely
refrain
from
smiling
at
this
antipathy
to
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
;
who
was
a
well-made
,
athletic
youth
,
good-looking
in
features
,
*NL*
and
stout
and
healthy
,
but
attired
in
garments
befitting
his
daily
*NL*
occupations
of
working
on
the
farm
and
lounging
among
the
moors
after
*NL*
rabbits
and
game
.
Still
,
I
thought
I
could
detect
in
his
physiognomy
a
*NL*
mind
owning
better
qualities
than
his
father
ever
possessed
.
Good
things
*NL*
lost
amid
a
wilderness
of
weeds
,
to
be
sure
,
whose
rankness
far
*NL*
over-topped
their
neglected
growth
;
yet
,
notwithstanding
,
evidence
of
a
*NL*
wealthy
soil
,
that
might
yield
luxuriant
crops
under
other
and
favourable
*NL*
circumstances
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
I
believe
,
had
not
treated
him
physically
*NL*
ill
;
thanks
to
his
fearless
nature
,
which
offered
no
temptation
to
that
*NL*
course
of
oppression
:
he
had
none
of
the
timid
susceptibility
that
would
*NL*
have
given
zest
to
ill-treatment
,
in
Heathcliff
's
judgment
.
He
appeared
*NL*
to
have
bent
his
malevolence
on
making
him
a
brute
:
he
was
never
taught
*NL*
to
read
or
write
;
never
rebuked
for
any
bad
habit
which
did
not
annoy
his
*NL*
keeper
;
never
led
a
single
step
towards
virtue
,
or
guarded
by
a
single
*NL*
precept
against
vice
.
And
from
what
I
heard
,
Joseph
contributed
much
to
*NL*
his
deterioration
,
by
a
narrow-minded
partiality
which
prompted
him
to
*NL*
flatter
and
pet
him
,
as
a
boy
,
because
he
was
the
head
of
the
old
family
.
*NL*
And
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
accusing
Catherine
Earnshaw
and
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
when
children
,
of
putting
the
master
past
his
patience
,
and
*NL*
compelling
him
to
seek
solace
in
drink
by
what
he
termed
their
`
offald
*NL*
ways
,
'
so
at
present
he
laid
the
whole
burden
of
Hareton
's
faults
on
the
*NL*
shoulders
of
the
usurper
of
his
property
.
If
the
lad
swore
,
he
would
n't
*NL*
correct
him
:
nor
however
culpably
he
behaved
.
It
gave
Joseph
*NL*
satisfaction
,
apparently
,
to
watch
him
go
the
worst
lengths
:
he
allowed
*NL*
that
the
lad
was
ruined
:
that
his
soul
was
abandoned
to
perdition
;
but
*NL*
then
he
reflected
that
Heathcliff
must
answer
for
it
.
Hareton
's
blood
*NL*
would
be
required
at
his
hands
;
and
there
lay
immense
consolation
in
that
*NL*
thought
.
Joseph
had
instilled
into
him
a
pride
of
name
,
and
of
his
*NL*
lineage
;
he
would
,
had
he
dared
,
have
fostered
hate
between
him
and
the
*NL*
present
owner
of
the
Heights
:
but
his
dread
of
that
owner
amounted
to
*NL*
superstition
;
and
he
confined
his
feelings
regarding
him
to
muttered
*NL*
innuendoes
and
private
comminations
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
intimately
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
mode
of
living
customary
in
those
days
at
Wuthering
*NL*
Heights
:
I
only
speak
from
hearsay
;
for
I
saw
little
.
The
villagers
*NL*
affirmed
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
_
near
_
,
and
a
cruel
hard
landlord
to
his
*NL*
tenants
;
but
the
house
,
inside
,
had
regained
its
ancient
aspect
of
*NL*
comfort
under
female
management
,
and
the
scenes
of
riot
common
in
*NL*
Hindley
's
time
were
not
now
enacted
within
its
walls
.
The
master
was
too
*NL*
gloomy
to
seek
companionship
with
any
people
,
good
or
bad
;
and
he
is
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
however
,
is
not
making
progress
with
my
story
.
Miss
Cathy
rejected
*NL*
the
peace-offering
of
the
terrier
,
and
demanded
her
own
dogs
,
Charlie
and
*NL*
Phoenix
.
They
came
limping
and
hanging
their
heads
;
and
we
set
out
for
*NL*
home
,
sadly
out
of
sorts
,
every
one
of
us
.
I
could
not
wring
from
my
*NL*
little
lady
how
she
had
spent
the
day
;
except
that
,
as
I
supposed
,
the
*NL*
goal
of
her
pilgrimage
was
Penistone
Crags
;
and
she
arrived
without
*NL*
adventure
to
the
gate
of
the
farm-house
,
when
Hareton
happened
to
issue
*NL*
forth
,
attended
by
some
canine
followers
,
who
attacked
her
train
.
They
*NL*
had
a
smart
battle
,
before
their
owners
could
separate
them
:
that
formed
*NL*
an
introduction
.
Catherine
told
Hareton
who
she
was
,
and
where
she
was
*NL*
going
;
and
asked
him
to
show
her
the
way
:
finally
,
beguiling
him
to
*NL*
accompany
her
.
He
opened
the
mysteries
of
the
Fairy
Cave
,
and
twenty
*NL*
other
queer
places
.
But
,
being
in
disgrace
,
I
was
not
favoured
with
a
*NL*
description
of
the
interesting
objects
she
saw
.
I
could
gather
,
however
,
*NL*
that
her
guide
had
been
a
favourite
till
she
hurt
his
feelings
by
*NL*
addressing
him
as
a
servant
;
and
Heathcliff
's
housekeeper
hurt
hers
by
*NL*
calling
him
her
cousin
.
Then
the
language
he
had
held
to
her
rankled
in
*NL*
her
heart
;
she
who
was
always
`
love
,
'
and
`
darling
,
'
and
`
queen
,
'
and
*NL*
`
angel
,
'
with
everybody
at
the
Grange
,
to
be
insulted
so
shockingly
by
a
*NL*
stranger
!
She
did
not
comprehend
it
;
and
hard
work
I
had
to
obtain
a
*NL*
promise
that
she
would
not
lay
the
grievance
before
her
father
.
I
*NL*
explained
how
he
objected
to
the
whole
household
at
the
Heights
,
and
how
*NL*
sorry
he
would
be
to
find
she
had
been
there
;
but
I
insisted
most
on
the
*NL*
fact
,
that
if
she
revealed
my
negligence
of
his
orders
,
he
would
perhaps
*NL*
be
so
angry
that
I
should
have
to
leave
;
and
Cathy
could
n't
bear
that
*NL*
prospect
:
she
pledged
her
word
,
and
kept
it
for
my
sake
.
After
all
,
she
*NL*
was
a
sweet
little
girl
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
,
edged
with
black
,
announced
the
day
of
my
master
's
return
.
*NL*
Isabella
was
dead
;
and
he
wrote
to
bid
me
get
mourning
for
his
daughter
,
*NL*
and
arrange
a
room
,
and
other
accommodations
,
for
his
youthful
nephew
.
*NL*
Catherine
ran
wild
with
joy
at
the
idea
of
welcoming
her
father
back
;
and
*NL*
indulged
most
sanguine
anticipations
of
the
innumerable
excellencies
of
*NL*
her
`
real
'
cousin
.
The
evening
of
their
expected
arrival
came
.
Since
*NL*
early
morning
she
had
been
busy
ordering
her
own
small
affairs
;
and
now
*NL*
attired
in
her
new
black
frock
--
poor
thing
!
her
aunt
's
death
impressed
*NL*
her
with
no
definite
sorrow
--
she
obliged
me
,
by
constant
worrying
,
to
*NL*
walk
with
her
down
through
the
grounds
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Linton
is
just
six
months
younger
than
I
am
,
'
she
chattered
,
as
we
*NL*
strolled
leisurely
over
the
swells
and
hollows
of
mossy
turf
,
under
*NL*
shadow
of
the
trees
.
`
How
delightful
it
will
be
to
have
him
for
a
*NL*
playfellow
!
Aunt
Isabella
sent
papa
a
beautiful
lock
of
his
hair
;
it
was
*NL*
lighter
than
mine
--
more
flaxen
,
and
quite
as
fine
.
I
have
it
carefully
*NL*
preserved
in
a
little
glass
box
;
and
I
've
often
thought
what
a
pleasure
*NL*
it
would
be
to
see
its
owner
.
Oh
!
I
am
happy
--
and
papa
,
dear
,
dear
papa
!
*NL*
Come
,
Ellen
,
let
us
run
!
come
,
run
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
,
and
returned
and
ran
again
,
many
times
before
my
sober
footsteps
*NL*
reached
the
gate
,
and
then
she
seated
herself
on
the
grassy
bank
beside
*NL*
the
path
,
and
tried
to
wait
patiently
;
but
that
was
impossible
:
she
*NL*
could
n't
be
still
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long
they
are
!
'
she
exclaimed
.
`
Ah
,
I
see
,
some
dust
on
the
*NL*
road
--
they
are
coming
!
No
!
When
will
they
be
here
?
May
we
not
go
a
*NL*
little
way
--
half
a
mile
,
Ellen
,
only
just
half
a
mile
?
Do
say
Yes
:
to
*NL*
that
clump
of
birches
at
the
turn
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
refused
staunchly
.
At
length
her
suspense
was
ended
:
the
travelling
*NL*
carriage
rolled
in
sight
.
Miss
Cathy
shrieked
and
stretched
out
her
arms
*NL*
as
soon
as
she
caught
her
father
's
face
looking
from
the
window
.
He
*NL*
descended
,
nearly
as
eager
as
herself
;
and
a
considerable
interval
*NL*
elapsed
ere
they
had
a
thought
to
spare
for
any
but
themselves
.
While
*NL*
they
exchanged
caresses
I
took
a
peep
in
to
see
after
Linton
.
He
was
*NL*
asleep
in
a
corner
,
wrapped
in
a
warm
,
fur-lined
cloak
,
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
winter
.
A
pale
,
delicate
,
effeminate
boy
,
who
might
have
been
taken
for
*NL*
my
master
's
younger
brother
,
so
strong
was
the
resemblance
:
but
there
was
*NL*
a
sickly
peevishness
in
his
aspect
that
Edgar
Linton
never
had
.
The
*NL*
latter
saw
me
looking
;
and
having
shaken
hands
,
advised
me
to
close
the
*NL*
door
,
and
leave
him
undisturbed
;
for
the
journey
had
fatigued
him
.
Cathy
*NL*
would
fain
have
taken
one
glance
,
but
her
father
told
her
to
come
,
and
*NL*
they
walked
together
up
the
park
,
while
I
hastened
before
to
prepare
the
*NL*
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
darling
,
'
said
Mr.
Linton
,
addressing
his
daughter
,
as
they
halted
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
the
front
steps
:
`
your
cousin
is
not
so
strong
or
so
*NL*
merry
as
you
are
,
and
he
has
lost
his
mother
,
remember
,
a
very
short
time
*NL*
since
;
therefore
,
do
n't
expect
him
to
play
and
run
about
with
you
*NL*
directly
.
And
do
n't
harass
him
much
by
talking
:
let
him
be
quiet
this
*NL*
evening
,
at
least
,
will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
papa
,
'
answered
Catherine
:
`
but
I
do
want
to
see
him
;
and
he
*NL*
has
n't
once
looked
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
stopped
;
and
the
sleeper
being
roused
,
was
lifted
to
the
*NL*
ground
by
his
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
your
cousin
Cathy
,
Linton
,
'
he
said
,
putting
their
little
hands
*NL*
together
.
`
She
's
fond
of
you
already
;
and
mind
you
do
n't
grieve
her
by
*NL*
crying
to-night
.
Try
to
be
cheerful
now
;
the
travelling
is
at
an
end
,
*NL*
and
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
rest
and
amuse
yourself
as
you
please
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
go
to
bed
,
then
,
'
answered
the
boy
,
shrinking
from
Catherine
's
*NL*
salute
;
and
he
put
his
fingers
to
remove
incipient
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
come
,
there
's
a
good
child
,
'
I
whispered
,
leading
him
in
.
`
You
'll
*NL*
make
her
weep
too
--
see
how
sorry
she
is
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
whether
it
was
sorrow
for
him
,
but
his
cousin
put
on
as
sad
*NL*
a
countenance
as
himself
,
and
returned
to
her
father
.
All
three
entered
,
*NL*
and
mounted
to
the
library
,
where
tea
was
laid
ready
.
I
proceeded
to
*NL*
remove
Linton
's
cap
and
mantle
,
and
placed
him
on
a
chair
by
the
table
;
*NL*
but
he
was
no
sooner
seated
than
he
began
to
cry
afresh
.
My
master
*NL*
inquired
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
sit
on
a
chair
,
'
sobbed
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Go
to
the
sofa
,
then
,
and
Ellen
shall
bring
you
some
tea
,
'
answered
his
*NL*
uncle
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
greatly
tried
,
during
the
journey
,
I
felt
convinced
,
by
his
*NL*
fretful
ailing
charge
.
Linton
slowly
trailed
himself
off
,
and
lay
down
.
*NL*
Cathy
carried
a
footstool
and
her
cup
to
his
side
.
At
first
she
sat
*NL*
silent
;
but
that
could
not
last
:
she
had
resolved
to
make
a
pet
of
her
*NL*
little
cousin
,
as
she
would
have
him
to
be
;
and
she
commenced
stroking
*NL*
his
curls
,
and
kissing
his
cheek
,
and
offering
him
tea
in
her
saucer
,
*NL*
like
a
baby
.
This
pleased
him
,
for
he
was
not
much
better
:
he
dried
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
lightened
into
a
faint
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
he
'll
do
very
well
,
'
said
the
master
to
me
,
after
watching
them
a
*NL*
minute
.
`
Very
well
,
if
we
can
keep
him
,
Ellen
.
The
company
of
a
child
*NL*
of
his
own
age
will
instil
new
spirit
into
him
soon
,
and
by
wishing
for
*NL*
strength
he
'll
gain
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ay
,
if
we
can
keep
him
!
'
I
mused
to
myself
;
and
sore
misgivings
came
*NL*
over
me
that
there
was
slight
hope
of
that
.
And
then
,
I
thought
,
how
*NL*
ever
will
that
weakling
live
at
Wuthering
Heights
?
Between
his
father
*NL*
and
Hareton
,
what
playmates
and
instructors
they
'll
be
.
Our
doubts
were
*NL*
presently
decided
--
even
earlier
than
I
expected
.
I
had
just
taken
the
*NL*
children
up-stairs
,
after
tea
was
finished
,
and
seen
Linton
asleep
--
he
*NL*
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
him
till
that
was
the
case
--
I
had
come
down
,
*NL*
and
was
standing
by
the
table
in
the
hall
,
lighting
a
bedroom
candle
for
*NL*
Mr.
Edgar
,
when
a
maid
stepped
out
of
the
kitchen
and
informed
me
that
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
servant
Joseph
was
at
the
door
,
and
wished
to
speak
with
*NL*
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
ask
him
what
he
wants
first
,
'
I
said
,
in
considerable
*NL*
trepidation
.
'
A
very
unlikely
hour
to
be
troubling
people
,
and
the
*NL*
instant
they
have
returned
from
a
long
journey
.
I
do
n't
think
the
master
*NL*
can
see
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
had
advanced
through
the
kitchen
as
I
uttered
these
words
,
and
now
*NL*
presented
himself
in
the
hall
.
He
was
donned
in
his
Sunday
garments
,
*NL*
with
his
most
sanctimonious
and
sourest
face
,
and
,
holding
his
hat
in
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
his
stick
in
the
other
,
he
proceeded
to
clean
his
shoes
on
the
*NL*
mat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-evening
,
Joseph
,
'
I
said
,
coldly
.
`
What
business
brings
you
here
*NL*
to-night
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
Maister
Linton
I
mun
spake
to
,
'
he
answered
,
waving
me
disdainfully
*NL*
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Linton
is
going
to
bed
;
unless
you
have
something
particular
to
say
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
he
wo
n't
hear
it
now
,
'
I
continued
.
`
You
had
better
sit
down
in
*NL*
there
,
and
entrust
your
message
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
is
his
rahm
?
'
pursued
the
fellow
,
surveying
the
range
of
closed
*NL*
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
perceived
he
was
bent
on
refusing
my
mediation
,
so
very
reluctantly
I
*NL*
went
up
to
the
library
,
and
announced
the
unseasonable
visitor
,
advising
*NL*
that
he
should
be
dismissed
till
next
day
.
Mr.
Linton
had
no
time
to
*NL*
empower
me
to
do
so
,
for
Joseph
mounted
close
at
my
heels
,
and
,
pushing
*NL*
into
the
apartment
,
planted
himself
at
the
far
side
of
the
table
,
with
*NL*
his
two
fists
clapped
on
the
head
of
his
stick
,
and
began
in
an
elevated
*NL*
tone
,
as
if
anticipating
opposition
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hathecliff
has
sent
me
for
his
lad
,
and
I
munn
'
t
goa
back
`
bout
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
Linton
was
silent
a
minute
;
an
expression
of
exceeding
sorrow
*NL*
overcast
his
features
:
he
would
have
pitied
the
child
on
his
own
account
;
*NL*
but
,
recalling
Isabella
's
hopes
and
fears
,
and
anxious
wishes
for
her
*NL*
son
,
and
her
commendations
of
him
to
his
care
,
he
grieved
bitterly
at
the
*NL*
prospect
of
yielding
him
up
,
and
searched
in
his
heart
how
it
might
be
*NL*
avoided
.
No
plan
offered
itself
:
the
very
exhibition
of
any
desire
to
*NL*
keep
him
would
have
rendered
the
claimant
more
peremptory
:
there
was
*NL*
nothing
left
but
to
resign
him
.
However
,
he
was
not
going
to
rouse
him
*NL*
from
his
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
he
answered
calmly
,
`
that
his
son
shall
come
to
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
to-morrow
.
He
is
in
bed
,
and
too
tired
to
go
the
*NL*
distance
now
.
You
may
also
tell
him
that
the
mother
of
Linton
desired
*NL*
him
to
remain
under
my
guardianship
;
and
,
at
present
,
his
health
is
very
*NL*
precarious
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Noa
!
'
said
Joseph
,
giving
a
thud
with
his
prop
on
the
floor
,
and
*NL*
assuming
an
authoritative
air
.
`
Noa
!

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
obviate
the
danger
of
this
threat
being
fulfilled
,
Mr.
Linton
*NL*
commissioned
me
to
take
the
boy
home
early
,
on
Catherine
's
pony
;
and
,
*NL*
said
he
--
`
As
we
shall
now
have
no
influence
over
his
destiny
,
good
or
*NL*
bad
,
you
must
say
nothing
of
where
he
is
gone
to
my
daughter
:
she
can
not
*NL*
associate
with
him
hereafter
,
and
it
is
better
for
her
to
remain
in
*NL*
ignorance
of
his
proximity
;
lest
she
should
be
restless
,
and
anxious
to
*NL*
visit
the
Heights
.
Merely
tell
her
his
father
sent
for
him
suddenly
,
and
*NL*
he
has
been
obliged
to
leave
us
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
was
very
reluctant
to
be
roused
from
his
bed
at
five
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
astonished
to
be
informed
that
he
must
prepare
for
further
travelling
;
*NL*
but
I
softened
off
the
matter
by
stating
that
he
was
going
to
spend
some
*NL*
time
with
his
father
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
wished
to
see
him
so
much
,
he
*NL*
did
not
like
to
defer
the
pleasure
till
he
should
recover
from
his
late
*NL*
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
father
!
'
he
cried
,
in
strange
perplexity
.
`
Mamma
never
told
me
I
had
*NL*
a
father
.
Where
does
he
live
?
I
'd
rather
stay
with
uncle
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
lives
a
little
distance
from
the
Grange
,
'
I
replied
;
`
just
beyond
*NL*
those
hills
:
not
so
far
,
but
you
may
walk
over
here
when
you
get
hearty
.
*NL*
And
you
should
be
glad
to
go
home
,
and
to
see
him
.
You
must
try
to
love
*NL*
him
,
as
you
did
your
mother
,
and
then
he
will
love
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
why
have
I
not
heard
of
him
before
?
'
asked
Linton
.
`
Why
did
n't
*NL*
mamma
and
he
live
together
,
as
other
people
do
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
business
to
keep
him
in
the
north
,
'
I
answered
,
`
and
your
*NL*
mother
's
health
required
her
to
reside
in
the
south
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
why
did
n't
mamma
speak
to
me
about
him
?
'
persevered
the
child
.
`
She
*NL*
often
talked
of
uncle
,
and
I
learnt
to
love
him
long
ago
.
How
am
I
to
*NL*
love
papa
?
I
do
n't
know
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
all
children
love
their
parents
,
'
I
said
.
`
Your
mother
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
thought
you
would
want
to
be
with
him
if
she
mentioned
him
often
to
you
.
*NL*
Let
us
make
haste
.
An
early
ride
on
such
a
beautiful
morning
is
much
*NL*
preferable
to
an
hour
's
more
sleep
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
_
she
_
to
go
with
us
,
'
he
demanded
,
`
the
little
girl
I
saw
yesterday
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
now
,
'
replied
I.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
uncle
?
'
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
shall
be
your
companion
there
,
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
sank
back
on
his
pillow
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
go
without
uncle
,
'
he
cried
at
length
:
'
I
ca
n't
tell
where
you
*NL*
mean
to
take
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
attempted
to
persuade
him
of
the
naughtiness
of
showing
reluctance
to
*NL*
meet
his
father
;
still
he
obstinately
resisted
any
progress
towards
*NL*
dressing
,
and
I
had
to
call
for
my
master
's
assistance
in
coaxing
him
out
*NL*
of
bed
.
The
poor
thing
was
finally
got
off
,
with
several
delusive
*NL*
assurances
that
his
absence
should
be
short
:
that
Mr.
Edgar
and
Cathy
*NL*
would
visit
him
,
and
other
promises
,
equally
ill-founded
,
which
I
*NL*
invented
and
reiterated
at
intervals
throughout
the
way
.
The
pure
*NL*
heather-scented
air
,
the
bright
sunshine
,
and
the
gentle
canter
of
Minny
,
*NL*
relieved
his
despondency
after
a
while
.
He
began
to
put
questions
*NL*
concerning
his
new
home
,
and
its
inhabitants
,
with
greater
interest
and
*NL*
liveliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
Wuthering
Heights
as
pleasant
a
place
as
Thrushcross
Grange
?
'
he
*NL*
inquired
,
turning
to
take
a
last
glance
into
the
valley
,
whence
a
light
*NL*
mist
mounted
and
formed
a
fleecy
cloud
on
the
skirts
of
the
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
so
buried
in
trees
,
'
I
replied
,
`
and
it
is
not
quite
so
large
,
*NL*
but
you
can
see
the
country
beautifully
all
round
;
and
the
air
is
*NL*
healthier
for
you
--
fresher
and
drier
.
You
will
,
perhaps
,
think
the
*NL*
building
old
and
dark
at
first
;
though
it
is
a
respectable
house
:
the
*NL*
next
best
in
the
neighbourhood
.
And
you
will
have
such
nice
rambles
on
*NL*
the
moors
.
Hareton
Earnshaw
--
that
is
,
Miss
Cathy
's
other
cousin
,
and
so
*NL*
yours
in
a
manner
--
will
show
you
all
the
sweetest
spots
;
and
you
can
*NL*
bring
a
book
in
fine
weather
,
and
make
a
green
hollow
your
study
;
and
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
your
uncle
may
join
you
in
a
walk
:
he
does
,
frequently
,
*NL*
walk
out
on
the
hills
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
is
my
father
like
?
'
he
asked
.
`
Is
he
as
young
and
handsome
as
*NL*
uncle
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
as
young
,
'
said
I
;
`
but
he
has
black
hair
and
eyes
,
and
looks
*NL*
sterner
;
and
he
is
taller
and
bigger
altogether
.
He
'll
not
seem
to
you
*NL*
so
gentle
and
kind
at
first
,
perhaps
,
because
it
is
not
his
way
:
still
,
*NL*
mind
you
,
be
frank
and
cordial
with
him
;
and
naturally
he
'll
be
fonder
of
*NL*
you
than
any
uncle
,
for
you
are
his
own
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Black
hair
and
eyes
!
'
mused
Linton
.
'
I
ca
n't
fancy
him
.
Then
I
am
not
*NL*
like
him
,
am
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
much
,
'
I
answered
:
not
a
morsel
,
I
thought
,
surveying
with
regret
*NL*
the
white
complexion
and
slim
frame
of
my
companion
,
and
his
large
*NL*
languid
eyes
--
his
mother
's
eyes
,
save
that
,
unless
a
morbid
touchiness
*NL*
kindled
them
a
moment
,
they
had
not
a
vestige
of
her
sparkling
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
strange
that
he
should
never
come
to
see
mamma
and
me
!
'
he
murmured
.
*NL*
`
Has
he
ever
seen
me
?
If
he
has
,
I
must
have
been
a
baby
.
I
remember
*NL*
not
a
single
thing
about
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Master
Linton
,
'
said
I
,
`
three
hundred
miles
is
a
great
distance
;
*NL*
and
ten
years
seem
very
different
in
length
to
a
grown-up
person
compared
*NL*
with
what
they
do
to
you
.
It
is
probable
Mr.
Heathcliff
proposed
going
*NL*
from
summer
to
summer
,
but
never
found
a
convenient
opportunity
;
and
now
*NL*
it
is
too
late
.
Do
n't
trouble
him
with
questions
on
the
subject
:
it
will
*NL*
disturb
him
,
for
no
good
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
fully
occupied
with
his
own
cogitations
for
the
remainder
of
*NL*
the
ride
,
till
we
halted
before
the
farmhouse
garden-gate
.
I
watched
to
*NL*
catch
his
impressions
in
his
countenance
.
He
surveyed
the
carved
front
*NL*
and
low-browed
lattices
,
the
straggling
gooseberry-bushes
and
crooked
*NL*
firs
,
with
solemn
intentness
,
and
then
shook
his
head
:
his
private
*NL*
feelings
entirely
disapproved
of
the
exterior
of
his
new
abode
.
But
he
*NL*
had
sense
to
postpone
complaining
:
there
might
be
compensation
within
.
*NL*
Before
he
dismounted
,
I
went
and
opened
the
door
.
It
was
half-past
six
;
*NL*
the
family
had
just
finished
breakfast
:
the
servant
was
clearing
and
*NL*
wiping
down
the
table
.
Joseph
stood
by
his
master
's
chair
telling
some
*NL*
tale
concerning
a
lame
horse
;
and
Hareton
was
preparing
for
the
hayfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hallo
,
Nelly
!
'
said
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
when
he
saw
me
.
'
I
feared
I
should
*NL*
have
to
come
down
and
fetch
my
property
myself
.
You
've
brought
it
,
have
*NL*
you
?
Let
us
see
what
we
can
make
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
strode
to
the
door
:
Hareton
and
Joseph
followed
in
gaping
*NL*
curiosity
.
Poor
Linton
ran
a
frightened
eye
over
the
faces
of
the
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sure-ly
,
'
said
Joseph
after
a
grave
inspection
,
`
he
's
swopped
wi
'
ye
,
*NL*
Maister
,
an
'
yon
's
his
lass
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
having
stared
his
son
into
an
ague
of
confusion
,
uttered
a
*NL*
scornful
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
God
!
what
a
beauty
!
what
a
lovely
,
charming
thing
!
'
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
`
Hav
'n'
t
they
reared
it
on
snails
and
sour
milk
,
Nelly
?
Oh
,
damn
my
*NL*
soul
!
but
that
's
worse
than
I
expected
--
and
the
devil
knows
I
was
not
*NL*
sanguine
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
bid
the
trembling
and
bewildered
child
get
down
,
and
enter
.
He
did
not
*NL*
thoroughly
comprehend
the
meaning
of
his
father
's
speech
,
or
whether
it
*NL*
were
intended
for
him
:
indeed
,
he
was
not
yet
certain
that
the
grim
,
*NL*
sneering
stranger
was
his
father
.
But
he
clung
to
me
with
growing
*NL*
trepidation
;
and
on
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
taking
a
seat
and
bidding
him
`
come
*NL*
hither
'
he
hid
his
face
on
my
shoulder
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tut
,
tut
!
'
said
Heathcliff
,
stretching
out
a
hand
and
dragging
him
*NL*
roughly
between
his
knees
,
and
then
holding
up
his
head
by
the
chin
.
*NL*
`
None
of
that
nonsense
!
We
're
not
going
to
hurt
thee
,
Linton
--
is
n't
that
*NL*
thy
name
?
Thou
art
thy
mother
's
child
,
entirely
!
Where
is
my
share
in
*NL*
thee
,
puling
chicken
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
off
the
boy
's
cap
and
pushed
back
his
thick
flaxen
curls
,
felt
*NL*
his
slender
arms
and
his
small
fingers
;
during
which
examination
Linton
*NL*
ceased
crying
,
and
lifted
his
great
blue
eyes
to
inspect
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
me
?
'
asked
Heathcliff
,
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
*NL*
limbs
were
all
equally
frail
and
feeble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
Linton
,
with
a
gaze
of
vacant
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
've
heard
of
me
,
I
daresay
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
he
replied
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
What
a
shame
of
your
mother
,
never
to
waken
your
filial
regard
for
*NL*
me
!
You
are
my
son
,
then
,
I
'll
tell
you
;
and
your
mother
was
a
wicked
*NL*
slut
to
leave
you
in
ignorance
of
the
sort
of
father
you
possessed
.
Now
,
*NL*
do
n't
wince
,
and
colour
up
!
Though
it
is
something
to
see
you
have
not
*NL*
white
blood
.
Be
a
good
lad
;
and
I
'll
do
for
you
.
Nelly
,
if
you
be
tired
*NL*
you
may
sit
down
;
if
not
,
get
home
again
.
I
guess
you
'll
report
what
you
*NL*
hear
and
see
to
the
cipher
at
the
Grange
;
and
this
thing
wo
n't
be
settled
*NL*
while
you
linger
about
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
replied
I
,
'
I
hope
you
'll
be
kind
to
the
boy
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
or
*NL*
you
'll
not
keep
him
long
;
and
he
's
all
you
have
akin
in
the
wide
world
,
*NL*
that
you
will
ever
know
--
remember
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
be
very
kind
to
him
,
you
need
n't
fear
,
'
he
said
,
laughing
.
`
Only
*NL*
nobody
else
must
be
kind
to
him
:
I
'm
jealous
of
monopolising
his
*NL*
affection
.
And
,
to
begin
my
kindness
,
Joseph
,
bring
the
lad
some
*NL*
breakfast
.
Hareton
,
you
infernal
calf
,
begone
to
your
work
.
Yes
,
Nell
,
'
*NL*
he
added
,
when
they
had
departed
,
`
my
son
is
prospective
owner
of
your
*NL*
place
,
and
I
should
not
wish
him
to
die
till
I
was
certain
of
being
his
*NL*
successor
.
Besides
,
he
's
_
mine
_
,
and
I
want
the
triumph
of
seeing
_
my
_
*NL*
descendant
fairly
lord
of
their
estates
;
my
child
hiring
their
children
*NL*
to
till
their
fathers
'
lands
for
wages
.
That
is
the
sole
consideration
*NL*
which
can
make
me
endure
the
whelp
:
I
despise
him
for
himself
,
and
hate
*NL*
him
for
the
memories
he
revives
!
But
that
consideration
is
sufficient
:
*NL*
he
's
as
safe
with
me
,
and
shall
be
tended
as
carefully
as
your
master
*NL*
tends
his
own
.
I
have
a
room
up-stairs
,
furnished
for
him
in
handsome
*NL*
style
;
I
've
engaged
a
tutor
,
also
,
to
come
three
times
a
week
,
from
*NL*
twenty
miles
'
distance
,
to
teach
him
what
he
pleases
to
learn
.
I
've
*NL*
ordered
Hareton
to
obey
him
:
and
in
fact
I
've
arranged
everything
with
a
*NL*
view
to
preserve
the
superior
and
the
gentleman
in
him
,
above
his
*NL*
associates
.
I
do
regret
,
however
,
that
he
so
little
deserves
the
*NL*
trouble
:
if
I
wished
any
blessing
in
the
world
,
it
was
to
find
him
a
*NL*
worthy
object
of
pride
;
and
I
'm
bitterly
disappointed
with
the
*NL*
whey-faced
,
whining
wretch
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
speaking
,
Joseph
returned
bearing
a
basin
of
milk-porridge
,
*NL*
and
placed
it
before
Linton
:
who
stirred
round
the
homely
mess
with
a
*NL*
look
of
aversion
,
and
affirmed
he
could
not
eat
it
.
I
saw
the
old
*NL*
man-servant
shared
largely
in
his
master
's
scorn
of
the
child
;
though
he
*NL*
was
compelled
to
retain
the
sentiment
in
his
heart
,
because
Heathcliff
*NL*
plainly
meant
his
underlings
to
hold
him
in
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
not
ate
it
?
'
repeated
he
,
peering
in
Linton
's
face
,
and
subduing
his
*NL*
voice
to
a
whisper
,
for
fear
of
being
overheard
.
`
But
Maister
Hareton
*NL*
nivir
ate
naught
else
,
when
he
wer
a
little
`
un
;
and
what
wer
gooid
*NL*
enough
for
him
's
gooid
enough
for
ye
,
I
's
rayther
think
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
_
sha
'n'
t
_
eat
it
!
'
answered
Linton
,
snappishly
.
`
Take
it
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
snatched
up
the
food
indignantly
,
and
brought
it
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
aught
ails
th
'
victuals
?
'
he
asked
,
thrusting
the
tray
under
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
should
ail
them
?
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wah
!
'
answered
Joseph
,
`
yon
dainty
chap
says
he
cannut
ate
'em
.
But
I
*NL*
guess
it
's
raight
!
His
mother
wer
just
soa
--
we
wer
a
`
most
too
mucky
to
*NL*
sow
t
'
corn
for
makking
her
breead
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
mention
his
mother
to
me
,
'
said
the
master
,
angrily
.
`
Get
him
*NL*
something
that
he
can
eat
,
that
's
all
.
What
is
his
usual
food
,
Nelly
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
suggested
boiled
milk
or
tea
;
and
the
housekeeper
received
instructions
*NL*
to
prepare
some
.
Come
,
I
reflected
,
his
father
's
selfishness
may
*NL*
contribute
to
his
comfort
.
He
perceives
his
delicate
constitution
,
and
*NL*
the
necessity
of
treating
him
tolerably
.
I
'll
console
Mr.
Edgar
by
*NL*
acquainting
him
with
the
turn
Heathcliff
's
humour
has
taken
.
Having
no
*NL*
excuse
for
lingering
longer
,
I
slipped
out
,
while
Linton
was
engaged
in
*NL*
timidly
rebuffing
the
advances
of
a
friendly
sheep-dog
.
But
he
was
too
*NL*
much
on
the
alert
to
be
cheated
:
as
I
closed
the
door
,
I
heard
a
cry
,
and
*NL*
a
frantic
repetition
of
the
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
leave
me
!
I
'll
not
stay
here
!
I
'll
not
stay
here
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
latch
was
raised
and
fell
:
they
did
not
suffer
him
to
come
*NL*
forth
.
I
mounted
Minny
,
and
urged
her
to
a
trot
;
and
so
my
brief
*NL*
guardianship
ended
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
sad
work
with
little
Cathy
that
day
:
she
rose
in
high
glee
,
eager
*NL*
to
join
her
cousin
,
and
such
passionate
tears
and
lamentations
followed
*NL*
the
news
of
his
departure
that
Edgar
himself
was
obliged
to
soothe
her
,
*NL*
by
affirming
he
should
come
back
soon
:
he
added
,
however
,
`
if
I
can
get
*NL*
him
'
;
and
there
were
no
hopes
of
that
.
This
promise
poorly
pacified
her
;
*NL*
but
time
was
more
potent
;
and
though
still
at
intervals
she
inquired
of
*NL*
her
father
when
Linton
would
return
,
before
she
did
see
him
again
his
*NL*
features
had
waxed
so
dim
in
her
memory
that
she
did
not
recognise
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
chanced
to
encounter
the
housekeeper
of
Wuthering
Heights
,
in
*NL*
paying
business
visits
to
Gimmerton
,
I
used
to
ask
how
the
young
master
*NL*
got
on
;
for
he
lived
almost
as
secluded
as
Catherine
herself
,
and
was
*NL*
never
to
be
seen
.
I
could
gather
from
her
that
he
continued
in
weak
*NL*
health
,
and
was
a
tiresome
inmate
.
She
said
Mr.
Heathcliff
seemed
to
*NL*
dislike
him
ever
longer
and
worse
,
though
he
took
some
trouble
to
conceal
*NL*
it
:
he
had
an
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
could
not
do
at
*NL*
all
with
his
sitting
in
the
same
room
with
him
many
minutes
together
.
*NL*
There
seldom
passed
much
talk
between
them
:
Linton
learnt
his
lessons
and
*NL*
spent
his
evenings
in
a
small
apartment
they
called
the
parlour
:
or
else
*NL*
lay
in
bed
all
day
:
for
he
was
constantly
getting
coughs
,
and
colds
,
and
*NL*
aches
,
and
pains
of
some
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
never
know
such
a
fainthearted
creature
,
'
added
the
woman
;
`
nor
*NL*
one
so
careful
of
hisseln
.
He
_
will
_
go
on
,
if
I
leave
the
window
open
a
*NL*
bit
late
in
the
evening
.
Oh
!
it
's
killing
,
a
breath
of
night
air
!
And
he
*NL*
must
have
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
summer
;
and
Joseph
's
bacca-pipe
is
*NL*
poison
;
and
he
must
always
have
sweets
and
dainties
,
and
always
milk
,
*NL*
milk
for
ever
--
heeding
naught
how
the
rest
of
us
are
pinched
in
winter
;
*NL*
and
there
he
'll
sit
,
wrapped
in
his
furred
cloak
in
his
chair
by
the
*NL*
fire
,
with
some
toast
and
water
or
other
slop
on
the
hob
to
sip
at
;
and
*NL*
if
Hareton
,
for
pity
,
comes
to
amuse
him
--
Hareton
is
not
bad-natured
,
*NL*
though
he
's
rough
--
they
're
sure
to
part
,
one
swearing
and
the
other
*NL*
crying
.
I
believe
the
master
would
relish
Earnshaw
's
thrashing
him
to
a
*NL*
mummy
,
if
he
were
not
his
son
;
and
I
'm
certain
he
would
be
fit
to
turn
*NL*
him
out
of
doors
,
if
he
knew
half
the
nursing
he
gives
hisseln
.
But
then
*NL*
he
wo
n't
go
into
danger
of
temptation
:
he
never
enters
the
parlour
,
and
*NL*
should
Linton
show
those
ways
in
the
house
where
he
is
,
he
sends
him
*NL*
up-stairs
directly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
divined
,
from
this
account
,
that
utter
lack
of
sympathy
had
rendered
*NL*
young
Heathcliff
selfish
and
disagreeable
,
if
he
were
not
so
originally
;
*NL*
and
my
interest
in
him
,
consequently
,
decayed
:
though
still
I
was
moved
*NL*
with
a
sense
of
grief
at
his
lot
,
and
a
wish
that
he
had
been
left
with
*NL*
us
.
Mr.
Edgar
encouraged
me
to
gain
information
:
he
thought
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
him
,
I
fancy
,
and
would
have
run
some
risk
to
see
him
;
and
he
told
*NL*
me
once
to
ask
the
housekeeper
whether
he
ever
came
into
the
village
?
She
*NL*
said
he
had
only
been
twice
,
on
horseback
,
accompanying
his
father
;
and
*NL*
both
times
he
pretended
to
be
quite
knocked
up
for
three
or
four
days
*NL*
afterwards
.
That
housekeeper
left
,
if
I
recollect
rightly
,
two
years
*NL*
after
he
came
;
and
another
,
whom
I
did
not
know
,
was
her
successor
;
she
*NL*
lives
there
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
wore
on
at
the
Grange
in
its
former
pleasant
way
till
Miss
Cathy
*NL*
reached
sixteen
.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
birth
we
never
manifested
any
*NL*
signs
of
rejoicing
,
because
it
was
also
the
anniversary
of
my
late
*NL*
mistress
's
death
.
Her
father
invariably
spent
that
day
alone
in
the
*NL*
library
;
and
walked
,
at
dusk
,
as
far
as
Gimmerton
kirkyard
,
where
he
*NL*
would
frequently
prolong
his
stay
beyond
midnight
.
Therefore
Catherine
*NL*
was
thrown
on
her
own
resources
for
amusement
.
This
twentieth
of
March
*NL*
was
a
beautiful
spring
day
,
and
when
her
father
had
retired
,
my
young
*NL*
lady
came
down
dressed
for
going
out
,
and
said
she
asked
to
have
a
ramble
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
with
me
:
Mr.
Linton
had
given
her
leave
,
if
we
*NL*
went
only
a
short
distance
and
were
back
within
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
make
haste
,
Ellen
!
'
she
cried
.
'
I
know
where
I
wish
to
go
;
where
a
*NL*
colony
of
moor-game
are
settled
:
I
want
to
see
whether
they
have
made
*NL*
their
nests
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
must
be
a
good
distance
up
,
'
I
answered
;
`
they
do
n't
breed
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
moor
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
it
's
not
,
'
she
said
.
`
I
've
gone
very
near
with
papa
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
sallied
out
,
thinking
nothing
more
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
She
bounded
before
me
,
and
returned
to
my
side
,
and
was
off
again
like
a
*NL*
young
greyhound
;
and
,
at
first
,
I
found
plenty
of
entertainment
in
*NL*
listening
to
the
larks
singing
far
and
near
,
and
enjoying
the
sweet
,
warm
*NL*
sunshine
;
and
watching
her
,
my
pet
and
my
delight
,
with
her
golden
*NL*
ringlets
flying
loose
behind
,
and
her
bright
cheek
,
as
soft
and
pure
in
*NL*
its
bloom
as
a
wild
rose
,
and
her
eyes
radiant
with
cloudless
pleasure
.
*NL*
She
was
a
happy
creature
,
and
an
angel
,
in
those
days
.
It
's
a
pity
she
*NL*
could
not
be
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
said
I
,
`
where
are
your
moor-game
,
Miss
Cathy
?
We
should
be
at
*NL*
them
:
the
Grange
park-fence
is
a
great
way
off
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
a
little
further
--
only
a
little
further
,
Ellen
,
'
was
her
answer
,
*NL*
continually
.
`
Climb
to
that
hillock
,
pass
that
bank
,
and
by
the
time
you
*NL*
reach
the
other
side
I
shall
have
raised
the
birds
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
were
so
many
hillocks
and
banks
to
climb
and
pass
,
that
,
at
*NL*
length
,
I
began
to
be
weary
,
and
told
her
we
must
halt
,
and
retrace
our
*NL*
steps
.
I
shouted
to
her
,
as
she
had
outstripped
me
a
long
way
;
she
*NL*
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
regard
,
for
she
still
sprang
on
,
and
I
was
*NL*
compelled
to
follow
.
Finally
,
she
dived
into
a
hollow
;
and
before
I
came
*NL*
in
sight
of
her
again
,
she
was
two
miles
nearer
Wuthering
Heights
than
*NL*
her
own
home
;
and
I
beheld
a
couple
of
persons
arrest
her
,
one
of
whom
I
*NL*
felt
convinced
was
Mr.
Heathcliff
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
had
been
caught
in
the
fact
of
plundering
,
or
,
at
least
,
hunting
*NL*
out
the
nests
of
the
grouse
.
The
Heights
were
Heathcliff
's
land
,
and
he
*NL*
was
reproving
the
poacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
neither
taken
any
nor
found
any
,
'
she
said
,
as
I
toiled
to
them
,
*NL*
expanding
her
hands
in
corroboration
of
the
statement
.
'
I
did
n't
mean
to
*NL*
take
them
;
but
papa
told
me
there
were
quantities
up
here
,
and
I
wished
*NL*
to
see
the
eggs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
glanced
at
me
with
an
ill-meaning
smile
,
expressing
his
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
party
,
and
,
consequently
,
his
malevolence
towards
*NL*
it
,
and
demanded
who
`
papa
'
was
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Linton
of
Thrushcross
Grange
,
'
she
replied
.
'
I
thought
you
did
not
*NL*
know
me
,
or
you
would
n't
have
spoken
in
that
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
suppose
papa
is
highly
esteemed
and
respected
,
then
?
'
he
said
,
*NL*
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
are
you
?
'
inquired
Catherine
,
gazing
curiously
on
the
speaker
.
*NL*
`
That
man
I
've
seen
before
.
Is
he
your
son
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
Hareton
,
the
other
individual
,
who
had
gained
nothing
but
*NL*
increased
bulk
and
strength
by
the
addition
of
two
years
to
his
age
:
he
*NL*
seemed
as
awkward
and
rough
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Miss
Cathy
,
'
I
interrupted
,
`
it
will
be
three
hours
instead
of
one
that
*NL*
we
are
out
,
presently
.
We
really
must
go
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
that
man
is
not
my
son
,
'
answered
Heathcliff
,
pushing
me
aside
.
`
But
*NL*
I
have
one
,
and
you
have
seen
him
before
too
;
and
,
though
your
nurse
is
*NL*
in
a
hurry
,
I
think
both
you
and
she
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
*NL*
rest
.
Will
you
just
turn
this
nab
of
heath
,
and
walk
into
my
house
?
*NL*
You
'll
get
home
earlier
for
the
ease
;
and
you
shall
receive
a
kind
*NL*
welcome
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
whispered
Catherine
that
she
must
n't
,
on
any
account
,
accede
to
the
*NL*
proposal
:
it
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
?
'
she
asked
,
aloud
.
`
I
'm
tired
of
running
,
and
the
ground
is
dewy
:
*NL*
I
ca
n't
sit
here
.
Let
us
go
,
Ellen
.
Besides
,
he
says
I
have
seen
his
*NL*
son
.
He
's
mistaken
,
I
think
;
but
I
guess
where
he
lives
:
at
the
*NL*
farmhouse
I
visited
in
coming
from
Penistone
Crags
.
Do
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
.
Come
,
Nelly
,
hold
your
tongue
--
it
will
be
a
treat
for
her
to
look
*NL*
in
on
us
.
Hareton
,
get
forwards
with
the
lass
.
You
shall
walk
with
me
,
*NL*
Nelly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
's
not
going
to
any
such
place
,
'
I
cried
,
struggling
to
release
*NL*
my
arm
,
which
he
had
seized
:
but
she
was
almost
at
the
door-stones
*NL*
already
,
scampering
round
the
brow
at
full
speed
.
Her
appointed
*NL*
companion
did
not
pretend
to
escort
her
:
he
shied
off
by
the
road-side
,
*NL*
and
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
it
's
very
wrong
,
'
I
continued
:
`
you
know
you
mean
no
*NL*
good
.
And
there
she
'll
see
Linton
,
and
all
will
be
told
as
soon
as
ever
*NL*
we
return
;
and
I
shall
have
the
blame
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
her
to
see
Linton
,
'
he
answered
;
`
he
's
looking
better
these
few
*NL*
days
;
it
's
not
often
he
's
fit
to
be
seen
.
And
we
'll
soon
persuade
her
to
*NL*
keep
the
visit
secret
:
where
is
the
harm
of
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
harm
of
it
is
,
that
her
father
would
hate
me
if
he
found
I
suffered
*NL*
her
to
enter
your
house
;
and
I
am
convinced
you
have
a
bad
design
in
*NL*
encouraging
her
to
do
so
,
'
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
design
is
as
honest
as
possible
.
I
'll
inform
you
of
its
whole
*NL*
scope
,
'
he
said
.
`
That
the
two
cousins
may
fall
in
love
,
and
get
*NL*
married
.
I
'm
acting
generously
to
your
master
:
his
young
chit
has
no
*NL*
expectations
,
and
should
she
second
my
wishes
she
'll
be
provided
for
at
*NL*
once
as
joint
successor
with
Linton
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
Linton
died
,
'
I
answered
,
`
and
his
life
is
quite
uncertain
,
Catherine
*NL*
would
be
the
heir
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
she
would
not
,
'
he
said
.
`
There
is
no
clause
in
the
will
to
secure
*NL*
it
so
:
his
property
would
go
to
me
;
but
,
to
prevent
disputes
,
I
desire
*NL*
their
union
,
and
am
resolved
to
bring
it
about
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
'm
resolved
she
shall
never
approach
your
house
with
me
again
,
'
I
*NL*
returned
,
as
we
reached
the
gate
,
where
Miss
Cathy
waited
our
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
bade
me
be
quiet
;
and
,
preceding
us
up
the
path
,
hastened
to
*NL*
open
the
door
.
My
young
lady
gave
him
several
looks
,
as
if
she
could
not
*NL*
exactly
make
up
her
mind
what
to
think
of
him
;
but
now
he
smiled
when
he
*NL*
met
her
eye
,
and
softened
his
voice
in
addressing
her
;
and
I
was
foolish
*NL*
enough
to
imagine
the
memory
of
her
mother
might
disarm
him
from
desiring
*NL*
her
injury
.
Linton
stood
on
the
hearth
.
He
had
been
out
walking
in
the
*NL*
fields
,
for
his
cap
was
on
,
and
he
was
calling
to
Joseph
to
bring
him
dry
*NL*
shoes
.
He
had
grown
tall
of
his
age
,
still
wanting
some
months
of
*NL*
sixteen
.
His
features
were
pretty
yet
,
and
his
eye
and
complexion
*NL*
brighter
than
I
remembered
them
,
though
with
merely
temporary
lustre
*NL*
borrowed
from
the
salubrious
air
and
genial
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
who
is
that
?
'
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
turning
to
Cathy
.
`
Can
you
*NL*
tell
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
son
?
'
she
said
,
having
doubtfully
surveyed
,
first
one
and
then
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
answered
he
:
`
but
is
this
the
only
time
you
have
beheld
him
?
*NL*
Think
!
Ah
!
you
have
a
short
memory
.
Linton
,
do
n't
you
recall
your
*NL*
cousin
,
that
you
used
to
tease
us
so
with
wishing
to
see
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
Linton
!
'
cried
Cathy
,
kindling
into
joyful
surprise
at
the
name
.
*NL*
`
Is
that
little
Linton
?
He
's
taller
than
I
am
!
Are
you
Linton
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
stepped
forward
,
and
acknowledged
himself
:
she
kissed
him
*NL*
fervently
,
and
they
gazed
with
wonder
at
the
change
time
had
wrought
in
*NL*
the
appearance
of
each
.
Catherine
had
reached
her
full
height
;
her
*NL*
figure
was
both
plump
and
slender
,
elastic
as
steel
,
and
her
whole
aspect
*NL*
sparkling
with
health
and
spirits
.
Linton
's
looks
and
movements
were
*NL*
very
languid
,
and
his
form
extremely
slight
;
but
there
was
a
grace
in
his
*NL*
manner
that
mitigated
these
defects
,
and
rendered
him
not
unpleasing
.
*NL*
After
exchanging
numerous
marks
of
fondness
with
him
,
his
cousin
went
to
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
lingered
by
the
door
,
dividing
his
attention
between
*NL*
the
objects
inside
and
those
that
lay
without
:
pretending
,
that
is
,
to
*NL*
observe
the
latter
,
and
really
noting
the
former
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
are
my
uncle
,
then
!
'
she
cried
,
reaching
up
to
salute
him
.
'
I
*NL*
thought
I
liked
you
,
though
you
were
cross
at
first
.
Why
do
n't
you
visit
*NL*
at
the
Grange
with
Linton
?
To
live
all
these
years
such
close
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
never
see
us
,
is
odd
:
what
have
you
done
so
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
visited
it
once
or
twice
too
often
before
you
were
born
,
'
he
answered
.
*NL*
`
There
--
damn
it
!
If
you
have
any
kisses
to
spare
,
give
them
to
Linton
:
*NL*
they
are
thrown
away
on
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Naughty
Ellen
!
'
exclaimed
Catherine
,
flying
to
attack
me
next
with
her
*NL*
lavish
caresses
.
`
Wicked
Ellen
!
to
try
to
hinder
me
from
entering
.
But
*NL*
I
'll
take
this
walk
every
morning
in
future
:
may
I
,
uncle
?
and
sometimes
*NL*
bring
papa
.
Wo
n't
you
be
glad
to
see
us
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
'
replied
the
uncle
,
with
a
hardly
suppressed
grimace
,
*NL*
resulting
from
his
deep
aversion
to
both
the
proposed
visitors
.
`
But
*NL*
stay
,
'
he
continued
,
turning
towards
the
young
lady
.
`
Now
I
think
of
it
,
*NL*
I
'd
better
tell
you
.
Mr.
Linton
has
a
prejudice
against
me
:
we
*NL*
quarrelled
at
one
time
of
our
lives
,
with
unchristian
ferocity
;
and
,
if
*NL*
you
mention
coming
here
to
him
,
he
'll
put
a
veto
on
your
visits
*NL*
altogether
.
Therefore
,
you
must
not
mention
it
,
unless
you
be
careless
*NL*
of
seeing
your
cousin
hereafter
:
you
may
come
,
if
you
will
,
but
you
must
*NL*
not
mention
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
you
quarrel
?
'
asked
Catherine
,
considerably
crestfallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
thought
me
too
poor
to
wed
his
sister
,
'
answered
Heathcliff
,
`
and
was
*NL*
grieved
that
I
got
her
:
his
pride
was
hurt
,
and
he
'll
never
forgive
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
wrong
!
'
said
the
young
lady
:
`
some
time
I
'll
tell
him
so
.
But
*NL*
Linton
and
I
have
no
share
in
your
quarrel
.
I
'll
not
come
here
,
then
;
he
*NL*
shall
come
to
the
Grange
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
will
be
too
far
for
me
,
'
murmured
her
cousin
:
`
to
walk
four
miles
*NL*
would
kill
me
.
No
,
come
here
,
Miss
Catherine
,
now
and
then
:
not
every
*NL*
morning
,
but
once
or
twice
a
week
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
launched
towards
his
son
a
glance
of
bitter
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
,
Nelly
,
I
shall
lose
my
labour
,
'
he
muttered
to
me
.
`
Miss
*NL*
Catherine
,
as
the
ninny
calls
her
,
will
discover
his
value
,
and
send
him
*NL*
to
the
devil
.
Now
,
if
it
had
been
Hareton
!
--
Do
you
know
that
,
twenty
*NL*
times
a
day
,
I
covet
Hareton
,
with
all
his
degradation
?
I
'd
have
loved
*NL*
the
lad
had
he
been
some
one
else
.
But
I
think
he
's
safe
from
_
her
_
*NL*
love
.
I
'll
pit
him
against
that
paltry
creature
,
unless
it
bestir
itself
*NL*
briskly
.
We
calculate
it
will
scarcely
last
till
it
is
eighteen
.
Oh
,
*NL*
confound
the
vapid
thing
!
He
's
absorbed
in
drying
his
feet
,
and
never
*NL*
looks
at
her
.
--
Linton
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
father
,
'
answered
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
nothing
to
show
your
cousin
anywhere
about
,
not
even
a
rabbit
*NL*
or
a
weasel
's
nest
?
Take
her
into
the
garden
,
before
you
change
your
*NL*
shoes
;
and
into
the
stable
to
see
your
horse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
n't
you
rather
sit
here
?
'
asked
Linton
,
addressing
Cathy
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
expressed
reluctance
to
move
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
she
replied
,
casting
a
longing
look
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
evidently
eager
to
be
active
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
seat
,
and
shrank
closer
to
the
fire
.
Heathcliff
rose
,
and
*NL*
went
into
the
kitchen
,
and
from
thence
to
the
yard
,
calling
out
for
*NL*
Hareton
.
Hareton
responded
,
and
presently
the
two
re-entered
.
The
young
*NL*
man
had
been
washing
himself
,
as
was
visible
by
the
glow
on
his
cheeks
*NL*
and
his
wetted
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
'll
ask
_
you
_
,
uncle
,
'
cried
Miss
Cathy
,
recollecting
the
*NL*
housekeeper
's
assertion
.
`
That
is
not
my
cousin
,
is
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
he
,
replied
,
`
your
mother
's
nephew
.
Do
n't
you
like
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
looked
queer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
not
a
handsome
lad
?
'
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
uncivil
little
thing
stood
on
tiptoe
,
and
whispered
a
sentence
in
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
ear
.
He
laughed
;
Hareton
darkened
:
I
perceived
he
was
very
*NL*
sensitive
to
suspected
slights
,
and
had
obviously
a
dim
notion
of
his
*NL*
inferiority
.
But
his
master
or
guardian
chased
the
frown
by
exclaiming
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
be
the
favourite
among
us
,
Hareton
!
She
says
you
are
a
--
What
was
*NL*
it
?
Well
,
something
very
flattering
.
Here
!
you
go
with
her
round
the
*NL*
farm
.
And
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
mind
!
Do
n't
use
any
bad
words
;
and
*NL*
do
n't
stare
when
the
young
lady
is
not
looking
at
you
,
and
be
ready
to
*NL*
hide
your
face
when
she
is
;
and
,
when
you
speak
,
say
your
words
slowly
,
*NL*
and
keep
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
.
Be
off
,
and
entertain
her
as
*NL*
nicely
as
you
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
the
couple
walking
past
the
window
.
Earnshaw
had
his
*NL*
countenance
completely
averted
from
his
companion
.
He
seemed
studying
*NL*
the
familiar
landscape
with
a
stranger
's
and
an
artist
's
interest
.
*NL*
Catherine
took
a
sly
look
at
him
,
expressing
small
admiration
.
She
then
*NL*
turned
her
attention
to
seeking
out
objects
of
amusement
for
herself
,
and
*NL*
tripped
merrily
on
,
lilting
a
tune
to
supply
the
lack
of
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
tied
his
tongue
,
'
observed
Heathcliff
.
`
He
'll
not
venture
a
single
*NL*
syllable
all
the
time
!
Nelly
,
you
recollect
me
at
his
age
--
nay
,
some
*NL*
years
younger
.
Did
I
ever
look
so
stupid
:
so
``
gaumless
,
''
as
Joseph
calls
*NL*
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Worse
,
'
I
replied
,
`
because
more
sullen
with
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
a
pleasure
in
him
,
'
he
continued
,
reflecting
aloud
.
`
He
has
*NL*
satisfied
my
expectations
.
If
he
were
a
born
fool
I
should
not
enjoy
it
*NL*
half
so
much
.
But
he
's
no
fool
;
and
I
can
sympathise
with
all
his
*NL*
feelings
,
having
felt
them
myself
.
I
know
what
he
suffers
now
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
exactly
:
it
is
merely
a
beginning
of
what
he
shall
suffer
,
*NL*
though
.
And
he
'll
never
be
able
to
emerge
from
his
bathos
of
coarseness
*NL*
and
ignorance
.
I
've
got
him
faster
than
his
scoundrel
of
a
father
*NL*
secured
me
,
and
lower
;
for
he
takes
a
pride
in
his
brutishness
.
I
've
*NL*
taught
him
to
scorn
everything
extra-animal
as
silly
and
weak
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
Hindley
would
be
proud
of
his
son
,
if
he
could
see
him
?
almost
as
*NL*
proud
as
I
am
of
mine
.
But
there
's
this
difference
;
one
is
gold
put
to
*NL*
the
use
of
paving-stones
,
and
the
other
is
tin
polished
to
ape
a
service
*NL*
of
silver
.
_
Mine
_
has
nothing
valuable
about
it
;
yet
I
shall
have
the
*NL*
merit
of
making
it
go
as
far
as
such
poor
stuff
can
go
.
_
His
_
had
*NL*
first-rate
qualities
,
and
they
are
lost
:
rendered
worse
than
unavailing
.
*NL*
I
have
nothing
to
regret
;
he
would
have
more
than
any
but
I
are
aware
*NL*
of
.
And
the
best
of
it
is
,
Hareton
is
damnably
fond
of
me
!
You
'll
own
*NL*
that
I
've
outmatched
Hindley
there
.
If
the
dead
villain
could
rise
from
*NL*
his
grave
to
abuse
me
for
his
offspring
's
wrongs
,
I
should
have
the
fun
*NL*
of
seeing
the
said
offspring
fight
him
back
again
,
indignant
that
he
*NL*
should
dare
to
rail
at
the
one
friend
he
has
in
the
world
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
chuckled
a
fiendish
laugh
at
the
idea
.
I
made
no
reply
,
*NL*
because
I
saw
that
he
expected
none
.
Meantime
,
our
young
companion
,
who
*NL*
sat
too
removed
from
us
to
hear
what
was
said
,
began
to
evince
symptoms
*NL*
of
uneasiness
,
probably
repenting
that
he
had
denied
himself
the
treat
of
*NL*
Catherine
's
society
for
fear
of
a
little
fatigue
.
His
father
remarked
*NL*
the
restless
glances
wandering
to
the
window
,
and
the
hand
irresolutely
*NL*
extended
towards
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
up
,
you
idle
boy
!
'
he
exclaimed
,
with
assumed
heartiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Away
after
them
!
they
are
just
at
the
corner
,
by
the
stand
of
hives
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
gathered
his
energies
,
and
left
the
hearth
.
The
lattice
was
open
,
*NL*
and
,
as
he
stepped
out
,
I
heard
Cathy
inquiring
of
her
unsociable
*NL*
attendant
what
was
that
inscription
over
the
door
?
Hareton
stared
up
,
and
*NL*
scratched
his
head
like
a
true
clown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
some
damnable
writing
,
'
he
answered
.
'
I
can
not
read
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ca
n't
read
it
?
'
cried
Catherine
;
'
I
can
read
it
:
it
's
English
.
But
I
*NL*
want
to
know
why
it
is
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
giggled
:
the
first
appearance
of
mirth
he
had
exhibited
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
does
not
know
his
letters
,
'
he
said
to
his
cousin
.
`
Could
you
*NL*
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
a
colossal
dunce
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
all
as
he
should
be
?
'
asked
Miss
Cathy
,
seriously
;
`
or
is
he
*NL*
simple
:
not
right
?
I
've
questioned
him
twice
now
,
and
each
time
he
*NL*
looked
so
stupid
I
think
he
does
not
understand
me
.
I
can
hardly
*NL*
understand
him
,
I
'm
sure
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
repeated
his
laugh
,
and
glanced
at
Hareton
tauntingly
;
who
*NL*
certainly
did
not
seem
quite
clear
of
comprehension
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
nothing
the
matter
but
laziness
;
is
there
,
Earnshaw
?
'
he
said
.
*NL*
`
My
cousin
fancies
you
are
an
idiot
.
There
you
experience
the
*NL*
consequence
of
scorning
``
book-larning
,
''
as
you
would
say
.
Have
you
*NL*
noticed
,
Catherine
,
his
frightful
Yorkshire
pronunciation
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
where
the
devil
is
the
use
o
n't
?
'
growled
Hareton
,
more
ready
in
*NL*
answering
his
daily
companion
.
He
was
about
to
enlarge
further
,
but
the
*NL*
two
youngsters
broke
into
a
noisy
fit
of
merriment
:
my
giddy
miss
being
*NL*
delighted
to
discover
that
she
might
turn
his
strange
talk
to
matter
of
*NL*
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
is
the
use
of
the
devil
in
that
sentence
?
'
tittered
Linton
.
`
Papa
*NL*
told
you
not
to
say
any
bad
words
,
and
you
ca
n't
open
your
mouth
without
*NL*
one
.
Do
try
to
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
now
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
thou
were
n't
more
a
lass
than
a
lad
,
I
'd
fell
thee
this
minute
,
I
*NL*
would
;
pitiful
lath
of
a
crater
!
'
retorted
the
angry
boor
,
retreating
,
*NL*
while
his
face
burnt
with
mingled
rage
and
mortification
!
for
he
was
*NL*
conscious
of
being
insulted
,
and
embarrassed
how
to
resent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
having
overheard
the
conversation
,
as
well
as
I
,
smiled
*NL*
when
he
saw
him
go
;
but
immediately
afterwards
cast
a
look
of
singular
*NL*
aversion
on
the
flippant
pair
,
who
remained
chattering
in
the
door-way
:
*NL*
the
boy
finding
animation
enough
while
discussing
Hareton
's
faults
and
*NL*
deficiencies
,
and
relating
anecdotes
of
his
goings
on
;
and
the
girl
*NL*
relishing
his
pert
and
spiteful
sayings
,
without
considering
the
*NL*
ill-nature
they
evinced
.
I
began
to
dislike
,
more
than
to
compassionate
*NL*
Linton
,
and
to
excuse
his
father
in
some
measure
for
holding
him
cheap
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stayed
till
afternoon
:
I
could
not
tear
Miss
Cathy
away
sooner
;
but
*NL*
happily
my
master
had
not
quitted
his
apartment
,
and
remained
ignorant
of
*NL*
our
prolonged
absence
.
As
we
walked
home
,
I
would
fain
have
enlightened
*NL*
my
charge
on
the
characters
of
the
people
we
had
quitted
:
but
she
got
it
*NL*
into
her
head
that
I
was
prejudiced
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aha
!
'
she
cried
,
`
you
take
papa
's
side
,
Ellen
:
you
are
partial
I
know
;
*NL*
or
else
you
would
n't
have
cheated
me
so
many
years
into
the
notion
that
*NL*
Linton
lived
a
long
way
from
here
.
I
'm
really
extremely
angry
;
only
I
'm
*NL*
so
pleased
I
ca
n't
show
it
!
But
you
must
hold
your
tongue
about
_
my
_
*NL*
uncle
;
he
's
my
uncle
,
remember
;
and
I
'll
scold
papa
for
quarrelling
with
*NL*
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
she
ran
on
,
till
I
relinquished
the
endeavour
to
convince
her
of
*NL*
her
mistake
.
She
did
not
mention
the
visit
that
night
,
because
she
did
*NL*
not
see
Mr.
Linton
.
Next
day
it
all
came
out
,
sadly
to
my
chagrin
;
and
*NL*
still
I
was
not
altogether
sorry
:
I
thought
the
burden
of
directing
and
*NL*
warning
would
be
more
efficiently
borne
by
him
than
me
.
But
he
was
too
*NL*
timid
in
giving
satisfactory
reasons
for
his
wish
that
she
should
shun
*NL*
connection
with
the
household
of
the
Heights
,
and
Catherine
liked
good
*NL*
reasons
for
every
restraint
that
harassed
her
petted
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Papa
!
'
she
exclaimed
,
after
the
morning
's
salutations
,
`
guess
whom
I
saw
*NL*
yesterday
,
in
my
walk
on
the
moors
.
Ah
,
papa
,
you
started
!
you
've
not
*NL*
done
right
,
have
you
,
now
?
I
saw
--
but
listen
,
and
you
shall
hear
how
I
*NL*
found
you
out
;
and
Ellen
,
who
is
in
league
with
you
,
and
yet
pretended
to
*NL*
pity
me
so
,
when
I
kept
hoping
,
and
was
always
disappointed
about
*NL*
Linton
's
coming
back
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
faithful
account
of
her
excursion
and
its
consequences
;
and
my
*NL*
master
,
though
he
cast
more
than
one
reproachful
look
at
me
,
said
nothing
*NL*
till
she
had
concluded
.
Then
he
drew
her
to
him
,
and
asked
if
she
knew
*NL*
why
he
had
concealed
Linton
's
near
neighbourhood
from
her
?
Could
she
*NL*
think
it
was
to
deny
her
a
pleasure
that
she
might
harmlessly
enjoy
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
because
you
disliked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
believe
I
care
more
for
my
own
feelings
than
yours
,
Cathy
?
'
he
*NL*
said
.
`
No
,
it
was
not
because
I
disliked
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
because
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
dislikes
me
;
and
is
a
most
diabolical
man
,
delighting
to
wrong
*NL*
and
ruin
those
he
hates
,
if
they
give
him
the
slightest
opportunity
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
you
could
not
keep
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
cousin
without
*NL*
being
brought
into
contact
with
him
;
and
I
knew
he
would
detest
you
on
my
*NL*
account
;
so
for
your
own
good
,
and
nothing
else
,
I
took
precautions
that
*NL*
you
should
not
see
Linton
again
.
I
meant
to
explain
this
some
time
as
*NL*
you
grew
older
,
and
I
'm
sorry
I
delayed
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
quite
cordial
,
papa
,
'
observed
Catherine
,
not
at
*NL*
all
convinced
;
`
and
he
did
n't
object
to
our
seeing
each
other
:
he
said
I
*NL*
might
come
to
his
house
when
I
pleased
;
only
I
must
not
tell
you
,
because
*NL*
you
had
quarrelled
with
him
,
and
would
not
forgive
him
for
marrying
aunt
*NL*
Isabella
.
And
you
wo
n't
.
_
You
_
are
the
one
to
be
blamed
:
he
is
willing
*NL*
to
let
us
be
friends
,
at
least
;
Linton
and
I
;
and
you
are
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
master
,
perceiving
that
she
would
not
take
his
word
for
her
*NL*
uncle-in-law
's
evil
disposition
,
gave
a
hasty
sketch
of
his
conduct
to
*NL*
Isabella
,
and
the
manner
in
which
Wuthering
Heights
became
his
property
.
*NL*
He
could
not
bear
to
discourse
long
upon
the
topic
;
for
though
he
spoke
*NL*
little
of
it
,
he
still
felt
the
same
horror
and
detestation
of
his
*NL*
ancient
enemy
that
had
occupied
his
heart
ever
since
Mrs.
Linton
's
*NL*
death
.
`
She
might
have
been
living
yet
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
!
'
was
*NL*
his
constant
bitter
reflection
;
and
,
in
his
eyes
,
Heathcliff
seemed
a
*NL*
murderer
.
Miss
Cathy
--
conversant
with
no
bad
deeds
except
her
own
slight
*NL*
acts
of
disobedience
,
injustice
,
and
passion
,
arising
from
hot
temper
*NL*
and
thoughtlessness
,
and
repented
of
on
the
day
they
were
committed
--
was
*NL*
amazed
at
the
blackness
of
spirit
that
could
brood
on
and
cover
revenge
*NL*
for
years
,
and
deliberately
prosecute
its
plans
without
a
visitation
of
*NL*
remorse
.
She
appeared
so
deeply
impressed
and
shocked
at
this
new
view
*NL*
of
human
nature
--
excluded
from
all
her
studies
and
all
her
ideas
till
*NL*
now
--
that
Mr.
Edgar
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
pursue
the
subject
.
He
*NL*
merely
added
:
`
You
will
know
hereafter
,
darling
,
why
I
wish
you
to
avoid
*NL*
his
house
and
family
;
now
return
to
your
old
employments
and
amusements
,
*NL*
and
think
no
more
about
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
kissed
her
father
,
and
sat
down
quietly
to
her
lessons
for
a
*NL*
couple
of
hours
,
according
to
custom
;
then
she
accompanied
him
into
the
*NL*
grounds
,
and
the
whole
day
passed
as
usual
:
but
in
the
evening
,
when
she
*NL*
had
retired
to
her
room
,
and
I
went
to
help
her
to
undress
,
I
found
her
*NL*
crying
,
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
fie
,
silly
child
!
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
If
you
had
any
real
griefs
you
'd
*NL*
be
ashamed
to
waste
a
tear
on
this
little
contrariety
.
You
never
had
one
*NL*
shadow
of
substantial
sorrow
,
Miss
Catherine
.
Suppose
,
for
a
minute
,
*NL*
that
master
and
I
were
dead
,
and
you
were
by
yourself
in
the
world
:
how
*NL*
would
you
feel
,
then
?
Compare
the
present
occasion
with
such
an
*NL*
affliction
as
that
,
and
be
thankful
for
the
friends
you
have
,
instead
of
*NL*
coveting
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
crying
for
myself
,
Ellen
,
'
she
answered
,
`
it
's
for
him
.
He
*NL*
expected
to
see
me
again
to-morrow
,
and
there
he
'll
be
so
disappointed
:
*NL*
and
he
'll
wait
for
me
,
and
I
sha
'n'
t
come
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
!
'
said
I
,
`
do
you
imagine
he
has
thought
as
much
of
you
as
you
*NL*
have
of
him
?
Has
n't
he
Hareton
for
a
companion
?
Not
one
in
a
hundred
*NL*
would
weep
at
losing
a
relation
they
had
just
seen
twice
,
for
two
*NL*
afternoons
.
Linton
will
conjecture
how
it
is
,
and
trouble
himself
no
*NL*
further
about
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
may
I
not
write
a
note
to
tell
him
why
I
can
not
come
?
'
she
asked
,
*NL*
rising
to
her
feet
.
`
And
just
send
those
books
I
promised
to
lend
him
?
*NL*
His
books
are
not
as
nice
as
mine
,
and
he
wanted
to
have
them
extremely
,
*NL*
when
I
told
him
how
interesting
they
were
.
May
I
not
,
Ellen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
!
no
,
indeed
!
'
replied
I
with
decision
.
`
Then
he
would
write
*NL*
to
you
,
and
there
'd
never
be
an
end
of
it
.
No
,
Miss
Catherine
,
the
*NL*
acquaintance
must
be
dropped
entirely
:
so
papa
expects
,
and
I
shall
see
*NL*
that
it
is
done
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
how
can
one
little
note
--
?
'
she
recommenced
,
putting
on
an
imploring
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
!
'
I
interrupted
.
`
We
'll
not
begin
with
your
little
notes
.
Get
*NL*
into
bed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
at
me
a
very
naughty
look
,
so
naughty
that
I
would
not
kiss
her
*NL*
good-night
at
first
:
I
covered
her
up
,
and
shut
her
door
,
in
great
*NL*
displeasure
;
but
,
repenting
half-way
,
I
returned
softly
,
and
lo
!
there
*NL*
was
Miss
standing
at
the
table
with
a
bit
of
blank
paper
before
her
and
a
*NL*
pencil
in
her
hand
,
which
she
guiltily
slipped
out
of
sight
on
my
*NL*
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
get
nobody
to
take
that
,
Catherine
,
'
I
said
,
`
if
you
write
it
;
*NL*
and
at
present
I
shall
put
out
your
candle
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
the
extinguisher
on
the
flame
,
receiving
as
I
did
so
a
slap
on
my
*NL*
hand
and
a
petulant
`
cross
thing
!
'
I
then
quitted
her
again
,
and
she
*NL*
drew
the
bolt
in
one
of
her
worst
,
most
peevish
humours
.
The
letter
was
*NL*
finished
and
forwarded
to
its
destination
by
a
milk-fetcher
who
came
from
*NL*
the
village
;
but
that
I
did
n't
learn
till
some
time
afterwards
.
Weeks
*NL*
passed
on
,
and
Cathy
recovered
her
temper
;
though
she
grew
wondrous
fond
*NL*
of
stealing
off
to
corners
by
herself
and
often
,
if
I
came
near
her
*NL*
suddenly
while
reading
,
she
would
start
and
bend
over
the
book
,
evidently
*NL*
desirous
to
hide
it
;
and
I
detected
edges
of
loose
paper
sticking
out
*NL*
beyond
the
leaves
.
She
also
got
a
trick
of
coming
down
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
and
lingering
about
the
kitchen
,
as
if
she
were
expecting
the
*NL*
arrival
of
something
;
and
she
had
a
small
drawer
in
a
cabinet
in
the
*NL*
library
,
which
she
would
trifle
over
for
hours
,
and
whose
key
she
took
*NL*
special
care
to
remove
when
she
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
she
inspected
this
drawer
,
I
observed
that
the
playthings
and
*NL*
trinkets
which
recently
formed
its
contents
were
transmuted
into
bits
of
*NL*
folded
paper
.
My
curiosity
and
suspicions
were
roused
;
I
determined
to
*NL*
take
a
peep
at
her
mysterious
treasures
;
so
,
at
night
,
as
soon
as
she
and
*NL*
my
master
were
safe
upstairs
,
I
searched
,
and
readily
found
among
my
*NL*
house
keys
one
that
would
fit
the
lock
.
Having
opened
,
I
emptied
the
*NL*
whole
contents
into
my
apron
,
and
took
them
with
me
to
examine
at
leisure
*NL*
in
my
own
chamber
.
Though
I
could
not
but
suspect
,
I
was
still
surprised
*NL*
to
discover
that
they
were
a
mass
of
correspondence
--
daily
almost
,
it
*NL*
must
have
been
--
from
Linton
Heathcliff
:
answers
to
documents
forwarded
by
*NL*
her
.
The
earlier
dated
were
embarrassed
and
short
;
gradually
,
however
,
*NL*
they
expanded
into
copious
love-letters
,
foolish
,
as
the
age
of
the
*NL*
writer
rendered
natural
,
yet
with
touches
here
and
there
which
I
thought
*NL*
were
borrowed
from
a
more
experienced
source
.
Some
of
them
struck
me
as
*NL*
singularly
odd
compounds
of
ardour
and
flatness
;
commencing
in
strong
*NL*
feeling
,
and
concluding
in
the
affected
,
wordy
style
that
a
schoolboy
*NL*
might
use
to
a
fancied
,
incorporeal
sweetheart
.
Whether
they
satisfied
*NL*
Cathy
I
do
n't
know
;
but
they
appeared
very
worthless
trash
to
me
.
After
*NL*
turning
over
as
many
as
I
thought
proper
,
I
tied
them
in
a
handkerchief
*NL*
and
set
them
aside
,
relocking
the
vacant
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Following
her
habit
,
my
young
lady
descended
early
,
and
visited
the
*NL*
kitchen
:
I
watched
her
go
to
the
door
,
on
the
arrival
of
a
certain
little
*NL*
boy
;
and
,
while
the
dairymaid
filled
his
can
,
she
tucked
something
into
*NL*
his
jacket
pocket
,
and
plucked
something
out
.
I
went
round
by
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
laid
wait
for
the
messenger
;
who
fought
valorously
to
defend
*NL*
his
trust
,
and
we
spilt
the
milk
between
us
;
but
I
succeeded
in
*NL*
abstracting
the
epistle
;
and
,
threatening
serious
consequences
if
he
did
*NL*
not
look
sharp
home
,
I
remained
under
the
wall
and
perused
Miss
Cathy
's
*NL*
affectionate
composition
.
It
was
more
simple
and
more
eloquent
than
her
*NL*
cousin
's
:
very
pretty
and
very
silly
.
I
shook
my
head
,
and
went
*NL*
meditating
into
the
house
.
The
day
being
wet
,
she
could
not
divert
*NL*
herself
with
rambling
about
the
park
;
so
,
at
the
conclusion
of
her
*NL*
morning
studies
,
she
resorted
to
the
solace
of
the
drawer
.
Her
father
*NL*
sat
reading
at
the
table
;
and
I
,
on
purpose
,
had
sought
a
bit
of
work
in
*NL*
some
unripped
fringes
of
the
window-curtain
,
keeping
my
eye
steadily
*NL*
fixed
on
her
proceedings
.
Never
did
any
bird
flying
back
to
a
plundered
*NL*
nest
,
which
it
had
left
brimful
of
chirping
young
ones
,
express
more
*NL*
complete
despair
,
in
its
anguished
cries
and
flutterings
,
than
she
by
her
*NL*
single
`
Oh
!
'
and
the
change
that
transfigured
her
late
happy
countenance
.
*NL*
Mr.
Linton
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
matter
,
love
?
Have
you
hurt
yourself
?
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tone
and
look
assured
her
_
he
_
had
not
been
the
discoverer
of
the
*NL*
hoard
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
papa
!
'
she
gasped
.
`
Ellen
!
Ellen
!
come
up-stairs
--
I
'm
sick
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
her
summons
,
and
accompanied
her
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Ellen
!
you
have
got
them
,
'
she
commenced
immediately
,
dropping
on
*NL*
her
knees
,
when
we
were
enclosed
alone
.
`
Oh
,
give
them
to
me
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
never
,
never
do
so
again
!
Do
n't
tell
papa
.
You
have
not
told
papa
,
*NL*
Ellen
?
say
you
have
not
?
I
've
been
exceedingly
naughty
,
but
I
wo
n't
do
*NL*
it
any
more
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
grave
severity
in
my
manner
I
bade
her
stand
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
`
Miss
Catherine
,
you
are
tolerably
far
on
,
it
seems
:
*NL*
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
them
!
A
fine
bundle
of
trash
you
study
in
*NL*
your
leisure
hours
,
to
be
sure
:
why
,
it
's
good
enough
to
be
printed
!
And
*NL*
what
do
you
suppose
the
master
will
think
when
I
display
it
before
him
?
I
*NL*
hav
'n'
t
shown
it
yet
,
but
you
need
n't
imagine
I
shall
keep
your
*NL*
ridiculous
secrets
.
For
shame
!
and
you
must
have
led
the
way
in
writing
*NL*
such
absurdities
:
he
would
not
have
thought
of
beginning
,
I
'm
certain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
!
I
did
n't
!
'
sobbed
Cathy
,
fit
to
break
her
heart
.
'
I
did
n't
*NL*
once
think
of
loving
him
till
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Loving
_
!
'
cried
I
,
as
scornfully
as
I
could
utter
the
word
.
'
_
Loving
_
!
*NL*
Did
anybody
ever
hear
the
like
!
I
might
just
as
well
talk
of
loving
the
*NL*
miller
who
comes
once
a
year
to
buy
our
corn
.
Pretty
loving
,
indeed
!
and
*NL*
both
times
together
you
have
seen
Linton
hardly
four
hours
in
your
life
!
*NL*
Now
here
is
the
babyish
trash
.
I
'm
going
with
it
to
the
library
;
and
*NL*
we
'll
see
what
your
father
says
to
such
_
loving
_
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
at
her
precious
epistles
,
but
I
held
them
above
my
head
;
and
*NL*
then
she
poured
out
further
frantic
entreaties
that
I
would
burn
them
--
do
*NL*
anything
rather
than
show
them
.
And
being
really
fully
as
much
inclined
*NL*
to
laugh
as
scold
--
for
I
esteemed
it
all
girlish
vanity
--
I
at
length
*NL*
relented
in
a
measure
,
and
asked
,
--
`
If
I
consent
to
burn
them
,
will
you
*NL*
promise
faithfully
neither
to
send
nor
receive
a
letter
again
,
nor
a
book
*NL*
-LRB-
for
I
perceive
you
have
sent
him
books
-RRB-
,
nor
locks
of
hair
,
nor
rings
,
*NL*
nor
playthings
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
do
n't
send
playthings
,
'
cried
Catherine
,
her
pride
overcoming
her
*NL*
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
anything
at
all
,
then
,
my
lady
?
'
I
said
.
`
Unless
you
will
,
here
I
*NL*
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
promise
,
Ellen
!
'
she
cried
,
catching
my
dress
.
`
Oh
,
put
them
in
the
*NL*
fire
,
do
,
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
proceeded
to
open
a
place
with
the
poker
the
sacrifice
was
too
*NL*
painful
to
be
borne
.
She
earnestly
supplicated
that
I
would
spare
her
*NL*
one
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
or
two
,
Ellen
,
to
keep
for
Linton
's
sake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
unknotted
the
handkerchief
,
and
commenced
dropping
them
in
from
an
*NL*
angle
,
and
the
flame
curled
up
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
have
one
,
you
cruel
wretch
!
'
she
screamed
,
darting
her
hand
into
*NL*
the
fire
,
and
drawing
forth
some
half-consumed
fragments
,
at
the
expense
*NL*
of
her
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
--
and
I
will
have
some
to
exhibit
to
papa
!
'
I
answered
,
*NL*
shaking
back
the
rest
into
the
bundle
,
and
turning
anew
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
emptied
her
blackened
pieces
into
the
flames
,
and
motioned
me
to
*NL*
finish
the
immolation
.
It
was
done
;
I
stirred
up
the
ashes
,
and
interred
*NL*
them
under
a
shovelful
of
coals
;
and
she
mutely
,
and
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
intense
injury
,
retired
to
her
private
apartment
.
I
descended
to
tell
my
*NL*
master
that
the
young
lady
's
qualm
of
sickness
was
almost
gone
,
but
I
*NL*
judged
it
best
for
her
to
lie
down
a
while
.
She
would
n't
dine
;
but
she
*NL*
reappeared
at
tea
,
pale
,
and
red
about
the
eyes
,
and
marvellously
subdued
*NL*
in
outward
aspect
.
Next
morning
I
answered
the
letter
by
a
slip
of
*NL*
paper
,
inscribed
,
`
Master
Heathcliff
is
requested
to
send
no
more
notes
*NL*
to
Miss
Linton
,
as
she
will
not
receive
them
.
'
And
,
henceforth
,
the
*NL*
little
boy
came
with
vacant
pockets
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Summer
drew
to
an
end
,
and
early
autumn
:
it
was
past
Michaelmas
,
but
the
*NL*
harvest
was
late
that
year
,
and
a
few
of
our
fields
were
still
uncleared
.
*NL*
Mr.
Linton
and
his
daughter
would
frequently
walk
out
among
the
reapers
;
*NL*
at
the
carrying
of
the
last
sheaves
they
stayed
till
dusk
,
and
the
*NL*
evening
happening
to
be
chill
and
damp
,
my
master
caught
a
bad
cold
,
that
*NL*
settled
obstinately
on
his
lungs
,
and
confined
him
indoors
throughout
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
winter
,
nearly
without
intermission
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Cathy
,
frightened
from
her
little
romance
,
had
been
considerably
*NL*
sadder
and
duller
since
its
abandonment
;
and
her
father
insisted
on
her
*NL*
reading
less
,
and
taking
more
exercise
.
She
had
his
companionship
no
*NL*
longer
;
I
esteemed
it
a
duty
to
supply
its
lack
,
as
much
as
possible
,
*NL*
with
mine
:
an
inefficient
substitute
;
for
I
could
only
spare
two
or
three
*NL*
hours
,
from
my
numerous
diurnal
occupations
,
to
follow
her
footsteps
,
and
*NL*
then
my
society
was
obviously
less
desirable
than
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
afternoon
in
October
,
or
the
beginning
of
November
--
a
fresh
watery
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
the
turf
and
paths
were
rustling
with
moist
,
withered
*NL*
leaves
,
and
the
cold
blue
sky
was
half
hidden
by
clouds
--
dark
grey
*NL*
streamers
,
rapidly
mounting
from
the
west
,
and
boding
abundant
rain
--
I
*NL*
requested
my
young
lady
to
forego
her
ramble
,
because
I
was
certain
of
*NL*
showers
.
She
refused
;
and
I
unwillingly
donned
a
cloak
,
and
took
my
*NL*
umbrella
to
accompany
her
on
a
stroll
to
the
bottom
of
the
park
:
a
formal
*NL*
walk
which
she
generally
affected
if
low-spirited
--
and
that
she
*NL*
invariably
was
when
Mr.
Edgar
had
been
worse
than
ordinary
,
a
thing
never
*NL*
known
from
his
confession
,
but
guessed
both
by
her
and
me
from
his
*NL*
increased
silence
and
the
melancholy
of
his
countenance
.
She
went
sadly
*NL*
on
:
there
was
no
running
or
bounding
now
,
though
the
chill
wind
might
*NL*
well
have
tempted
her
to
race
.
And
often
,
from
the
side
of
my
eye
,
I
*NL*
could
detect
her
raising
a
hand
,
and
brushing
something
off
her
cheek
.
I
*NL*
gazed
round
for
a
means
of
diverting
her
thoughts
.
On
one
side
of
the
*NL*
road
rose
a
high
,
rough
bank
,
where
hazels
and
stunted
oaks
,
with
their
*NL*
roots
half
exposed
,
held
uncertain
tenure
:
the
soil
was
too
loose
for
the
*NL*
latter
;
and
strong
winds
had
blown
some
nearly
horizontal
.
In
summer
*NL*
Miss
Catherine
delighted
to
climb
along
these
trunks
,
and
sit
in
the
*NL*
branches
,
swinging
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
;
and
I
,
pleased
with
her
*NL*
agility
and
her
light
,
childish
heart
,
still
considered
it
proper
to
*NL*
scold
every
time
I
caught
her
at
such
an
elevation
,
but
so
that
she
knew
*NL*
there
was
no
necessity
for
descending
.
From
dinner
to
tea
she
would
lie
*NL*
in
her
breeze-rocked
cradle
,
doing
nothing
except
singing
old
songs
--
my
*NL*
nursery
lore
--
to
herself
,
or
watching
the
birds
,
joint
tenants
,
feed
and
*NL*
entice
their
young
ones
to
fly
:
or
nestling
with
closed
lids
,
half
*NL*
thinking
,
half
dreaming
,
happier
than
words
can
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
,
Miss
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
pointing
to
a
nook
under
the
roots
of
one
*NL*
twisted
tree
.
`
Winter
is
not
here
yet
.
There
's
a
little
flower
up
*NL*
yonder
,
the
last
bud
from
the
multitude
of
bluebells
that
clouded
those
*NL*
turf
steps
in
July
with
a
lilac
mist
.
Will
you
clamber
up
,
and
pluck
it
*NL*
to
show
to
papa
?
'
Cathy
stared
a
long
time
at
the
lonely
blossom
*NL*
trembling
in
its
earthy
shelter
,
and
replied
,
at
length
--
`
No
,
I
'll
not
*NL*
touch
it
:
but
it
looks
melancholy
,
does
it
not
,
Ellen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
I
observed
,
`
about
as
starved
and
suckless
as
you
:
your
cheeks
are
*NL*
bloodless
;
let
us
take
hold
of
hands
and
run
.
You
're
so
low
,
I
daresay
I
*NL*
shall
keep
up
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
she
repeated
,
and
continued
sauntering
on
,
pausing
at
intervals
to
*NL*
muse
over
a
bit
of
moss
,
or
a
tuft
of
blanched
grass
,
or
a
fungus
*NL*
spreading
its
bright
orange
among
the
heaps
of
brown
foliage
;
and
,
ever
*NL*
and
anon
,
her
hand
was
lifted
to
her
averted
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
,
why
are
you
crying
,
love
?
'
I
asked
,
approaching
and
putting
*NL*
my
arm
over
her
shoulder
.
`
You
must
n't
cry
because
papa
has
a
cold
;
be
*NL*
thankful
it
is
nothing
worse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
put
no
further
restraint
on
her
tears
;
her
breath
was
stifled
by
*NL*
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
it
will
be
something
worse
,
'
she
said
.
`
And
what
shall
I
do
when
*NL*
papa
and
you
leave
me
,
and
I
am
by
myself
?
I
ca
n't
forget
your
words
,
*NL*
Ellen
;
they
are
always
in
my
ear
.
How
life
will
be
changed
,
how
dreary
*NL*
the
world
will
be
,
when
papa
and
you
are
dead
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
can
tell
whether
you
wo
n't
die
before
us
,
'
I
replied
.
`
It
's
wrong
*NL*
to
anticipate
evil
.
We
'll
hope
there
are
years
and
years
to
come
before
*NL*
any
of
us
go
:
master
is
young
,
and
I
am
strong
,
and
hardly
forty-five
.
My
*NL*
mother
lived
till
eighty
,
a
canty
dame
to
the
last
.
And
suppose
Mr.
*NL*
Linton
were
spared
till
he
saw
sixty
,
that
would
be
more
years
than
you
*NL*
have
counted
,
Miss.
.
And
would
it
not
be
foolish
to
mourn
a
calamity
*NL*
above
twenty
years
beforehand
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
Aunt
Isabella
was
younger
than
papa
,
'
she
remarked
,
gazing
up
with
*NL*
timid
hope
to
seek
further
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aunt
Isabella
had
not
you
and
me
to
nurse
her
,
'
I
replied
.
`
She
was
n't
*NL*
as
happy
as
Master
:
she
had
n't
as
much
to
live
for
.
All
you
need
do
,
is
*NL*
to
wait
well
on
your
father
,
and
cheer
him
by
letting
him
see
you
*NL*
cheerful
;
and
avoid
giving
him
anxiety
on
any
subject
:
mind
that
,
Cathy
!
*NL*
I
'll
not
disguise
but
you
might
kill
him
if
you
were
wild
and
reckless
,
*NL*
and
cherished
a
foolish
,
fanciful
affection
for
the
son
of
a
person
who
*NL*
would
be
glad
to
have
him
in
his
grave
;
and
allowed
him
to
discover
that
*NL*
you
fretted
over
the
separation
he
has
judged
it
expedient
to
make
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
fret
about
nothing
on
earth
except
papa
's
illness
,
'
answered
my
*NL*
companion
.
'
I
care
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
papa
.
And
I
'll
*NL*
never
--
never
--
oh
,
never
,
while
I
have
my
senses
,
do
an
act
or
say
a
word
*NL*
to
vex
him
.
I
love
him
better
than
myself
,
Ellen
;
and
I
know
it
by
this
:
*NL*
I
pray
every
night
that
I
may
live
after
him
;
because
I
would
rather
be
*NL*
miserable
than
that
he
should
be
:
that
proves
I
love
him
better
than
*NL*
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good
words
,
'
I
replied
.
`
But
deeds
must
prove
it
also
;
and
after
he
is
*NL*
well
,
remember
you
do
n't
forget
resolutions
formed
in
the
hour
of
fear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
talked
,
we
neared
a
door
that
opened
on
the
road
;
and
my
young
*NL*
lady
,
lightening
into
sunshine
again
,
climbed
up
and
seated
herself
on
*NL*
the
top
of
the
wall
,
reaching
over
to
gather
some
hips
that
bloomed
*NL*
scarlet
on
the
summit
branches
of
the
wild-rose
trees
shadowing
the
*NL*
highway
side
:
the
lower
fruit
had
disappeared
,
but
only
birds
could
touch
*NL*
the
upper
,
except
from
Cathy
's
present
station
.
In
stretching
to
pull
*NL*
them
,
her
hat
fell
off
;
and
as
the
door
was
locked
,
she
proposed
*NL*
scrambling
down
to
recover
it
.
I
bid
her
be
cautious
lest
she
got
a
*NL*
fall
,
and
she
nimbly
disappeared
.
But
the
return
was
no
such
easy
*NL*
matter
:
the
stones
were
smooth
and
neatly
cemented
,
and
the
rose-bushes
*NL*
and
black-berry
stragglers
could
yield
no
assistance
in
re-ascending
.
I
,
*NL*
like
a
fool
,
did
n't
recollect
that
,
till
I
heard
her
laughing
and
*NL*
exclaiming
--
`
Ellen
!
you
'll
have
to
fetch
the
key
,
or
else
I
must
run
*NL*
round
to
the
porter
's
lodge
.
I
ca
n't
scale
the
ramparts
on
this
side
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
where
you
are
,
'
I
answered
;
'
I
have
my
bundle
of
keys
in
my
pocket
:
*NL*
perhaps
I
may
manage
to
open
it
;
if
not
,
I
'll
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
amused
herself
with
dancing
to
and
fro
before
the
door
,
while
I
*NL*
tried
all
the
large
keys
in
succession
.
I
had
applied
the
last
,
and
*NL*
found
that
none
would
do
;
so
,
repeating
my
desire
that
she
would
remain
*NL*
there
,
I
was
about
to
hurry
home
as
fast
as
I
could
,
when
an
approaching
*NL*
sound
arrested
me
.
It
was
the
trot
of
a
horse
;
Cathy
's
dance
stopped
*NL*
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
is
that
?
'
I
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
I
wish
you
could
open
the
door
,
'
whispered
back
my
companion
,
*NL*
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ho
,
Miss
Linton
!
'
cried
a
deep
voice
-LRB-
the
rider
's
-RRB-
,
`
I
'm
glad
to
meet
*NL*
you
.
Do
n't
be
in
haste
to
enter
,
for
I
have
an
explanation
to
ask
and
*NL*
obtain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sha
'n'
t
speak
to
you
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
answered
Catherine
.
`
Papa
says
*NL*
you
are
a
wicked
man
,
and
you
hate
both
him
and
me
;
and
Ellen
says
the
*NL*
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
,
'
said
Heathcliff
.
-LRB-
He
it
was
.
-RRB-
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
hate
my
son
,
I
suppose
;
and
it
is
concerning
him
that
I
demand
your
*NL*
attention
.
Yes
;
you
have
cause
to
blush
.
Two
or
three
months
since
,
*NL*
were
you
not
in
the
habit
of
writing
to
Linton
?
making
love
in
play
,
eh
?
*NL*
You
deserved
,
both
of
you
,
flogging
for
that
!
You
especially
,
the
elder
;
*NL*
and
less
sensitive
,
as
it
turns
out
.
I
've
got
your
letters
,
and
if
you
*NL*
give
me
any
pertness
I
'll
send
them
to
your
father
.
I
presume
you
grew
*NL*
weary
of
the
amusement
and
dropped
it
,
did
n't
you
?
Well
,
you
dropped
*NL*
Linton
with
it
into
a
Slough
of
Despond
.
He
was
in
earnest
:
in
love
,
*NL*
really
.
As
true
as
I
live
,
he
's
dying
for
you
;
breaking
his
heart
at
*NL*
your
fickleness
:
not
figuratively
,
but
actually
.
Though
Hareton
has
made
*NL*
him
a
standing
jest
for
six
weeks
,
and
I
have
used
more
serious
measures
,
*NL*
and
attempted
to
frighten
him
out
of
his
idiotcy
,
he
gets
worse
daily
;
*NL*
and
he
'll
be
under
the
sod
before
summer
,
unless
you
restore
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
can
you
lie
so
glaringly
to
the
poor
child
?
'
I
called
from
the
*NL*
inside
.
`
Pray
ride
on
!
How
can
you
deliberately
get
up
such
paltry
*NL*
falsehoods
?
Miss
Cathy
,
I
'll
knock
the
lock
off
with
a
stone
:
you
wo
n't
*NL*
believe
that
vile
nonsense
.
You
can
feel
in
yourself
it
is
impossible
*NL*
that
a
person
should
die
for
love
of
a
stranger
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
not
aware
there
were
eavesdroppers
,
'
muttered
the
detected
*NL*
villain
.
`
Worthy
Mrs.
Dean
,
I
like
you
,
but
I
do
n't
like
your
*NL*
double-dealing
,
'
he
added
aloud
.
`
How
could
_
you
_
lie
so
glaringly
as
to
*NL*
affirm
I
hated
the
``
poor
child
''
?
and
invent
bugbear
stories
to
terrify
*NL*
her
from
my
door-stones
?
Catherine
Linton
-LRB-
the
very
name
warms
me
-RRB-
,
my
*NL*
bonny
lass
,
I
shall
be
from
home
all
this
week
;
go
and
see
if
have
not
*NL*
spoken
truth
:
do
,
there
's
a
darling
!
Just
imagine
your
father
in
my
*NL*
place
,
and
Linton
in
yours
;
then
think
how
you
would
value
your
careless
*NL*
lover
if
he
refused
to
stir
a
step
to
comfort
you
,
when
your
father
*NL*
himself
entreated
him
;
and
do
n't
,
from
pure
stupidity
,
fall
into
the
*NL*
same
error
.
I
swear
,
on
my
salvation
,
he
's
going
to
his
grave
,
and
none
*NL*
but
you
can
save
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
lock
gave
way
and
I
issued
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
swear
Linton
is
dying
,
'
repeated
Heathcliff
,
looking
hard
at
me
.
`
And
*NL*
grief
and
disappointment
are
hastening
his
death
.
Nelly
,
if
you
wo
n't
*NL*
let
her
go
,
you
can
walk
over
yourself
.
But
I
shall
not
return
till
this
*NL*
time
next
week
;
and
I
think
your
master
himself
would
scarcely
object
to
*NL*
her
visiting
her
cousin
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
in
,
'
said
I
,
taking
Cathy
by
the
arm
and
half
forcing
her
to
*NL*
re-enter
;
for
she
lingered
,
viewing
with
troubled
eyes
the
features
of
*NL*
the
speaker
,
too
stern
to
express
his
inward
deceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
his
horse
close
,
and
,
bending
down
,
observed
--
`
Miss
Catherine
,
*NL*
I
'll
own
to
you
that
I
have
little
patience
with
Linton
;
and
Hareton
and
*NL*
Joseph
have
less
.
I
'll
own
that
he
's
with
a
harsh
set
.
He
pines
for
*NL*
kindness
,
as
well
as
love
;
and
a
kind
word
from
you
would
be
his
best
*NL*
medicine
.
Do
n't
mind
Mrs.
Dean
's
cruel
cautions
;
but
be
generous
,
and
*NL*
contrive
to
see
him
.
He
dreams
of
you
day
and
night
,
and
can
not
be
*NL*
persuaded
that
you
do
n't
hate
him
,
since
you
neither
write
nor
call
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
closed
the
door
,
and
rolled
a
stone
to
assist
the
loosened
lock
in
*NL*
holding
it
;
and
spreading
my
umbrella
,
I
drew
my
charge
underneath
:
for
*NL*
the
rain
began
to
drive
through
the
moaning
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
warned
us
to
avoid
delay
.
Our
hurry
prevented
any
comment
on
the
*NL*
encounter
with
Heathcliff
,
as
we
stretched
towards
home
;
but
I
divined
*NL*
instinctively
that
Catherine
's
heart
was
clouded
now
in
double
darkness
.
*NL*
Her
features
were
so
sad
,
they
did
not
seem
hers
:
she
evidently
regarded
*NL*
what
she
had
heard
as
every
syllable
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
had
retired
to
rest
before
we
came
in
.
Cathy
stole
to
his
*NL*
room
to
inquire
how
he
was
;
he
had
fallen
asleep
.
She
returned
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
to
sit
with
her
in
the
library
.
We
took
our
tea
together
;
and
*NL*
afterwards
she
lay
down
on
the
rug
,
and
told
me
not
to
talk
,
for
she
was
*NL*
weary
.
I
got
a
book
,
and
pretended
to
read
.
As
soon
as
she
supposed
me
*NL*
absorbed
in
my
occupation
,
she
recommenced
her
silent
weeping
:
it
*NL*
appeared
,
at
present
,
her
favourite
diversion
.
I
suffered
her
to
enjoy
*NL*
it
a
while
;
then
I
expostulated
:
deriding
and
ridiculing
all
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
's
assertions
about
his
son
,
as
if
I
were
certain
she
would
*NL*
coincide
.
Alas
!
I
had
n't
skill
to
counteract
the
effect
his
account
had
*NL*
produced
:
it
was
just
what
he
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
be
right
,
Ellen
,
'
she
answered
;
`
but
I
shall
never
feel
at
ease
*NL*
till
I
know
.
And
I
must
tell
Linton
it
is
not
my
fault
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
write
,
and
convince
him
that
I
shall
not
change
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
What
use
were
anger
and
protestations
against
her
silly
credulity
?
We
*NL*
parted
that
night
--
hostile
;
but
next
day
beheld
me
on
the
road
to
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
,
by
the
side
of
my
wilful
young
mistress
's
pony
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
bear
to
witness
her
sorrow
:
to
see
her
pale
,
dejected
*NL*
countenance
,
and
heavy
eyes
:
and
I
yielded
,
in
the
faint
hope
that
Linton
*NL*
himself
might
prove
,
by
his
reception
of
us
,
how
little
of
the
tale
was
*NL*
founded
on
fact
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
rainy
night
had
ushered
in
a
misty
morning
--
half
frost
,
half
*NL*
drizzle
--
and
temporary
brooks
crossed
our
path
--
gurgling
from
the
*NL*
uplands
.
My
feet
were
thoroughly
wetted
;
I
was
cross
and
low
;
exactly
*NL*
the
humour
suited
for
making
the
most
of
these
disagreeable
things
.
We
*NL*
entered
the
farm-house
by
the
kitchen
way
,
to
ascertain
whether
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
were
really
absent
:
because
I
put
slight
faith
in
his
own
*NL*
affirmation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
seemed
sitting
in
a
sort
of
elysium
alone
,
beside
a
roaring
fire
;
*NL*
a
quart
of
ale
on
the
table
near
him
,
bristling
with
large
pieces
of
*NL*
toasted
oat-cake
;
and
his
black
,
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
Catherine
ran
*NL*
to
the
hearth
to
warm
herself
.
I
asked
if
the
master
was
in
?
My
*NL*
question
remained
so
long
unanswered
,
that
I
thought
the
old
man
had
*NL*
grown
deaf
,
and
repeated
it
louder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Na
--
ay
!
'
he
snarled
,
or
rather
screamed
through
his
nose
.
`
Na
--
ay
!
yah
*NL*
muh
goa
back
whear
yah
coom
frough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Joseph
!
'
cried
a
peevish
voice
,
simultaneously
with
me
,
from
the
inner
*NL*
room
.
`
How
often
am
I
to
call
you
?
There
are
only
a
few
red
ashes
now
.
*NL*
Joseph
!
come
this
moment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Vigorous
puffs
,
and
a
resolute
stare
into
the
grate
,
declared
he
had
no
*NL*
ear
for
this
appeal
.
The
housekeeper
and
Hareton
were
invisible
;
one
*NL*
gone
on
an
errand
,
and
the
other
at
his
work
,
probably
.
We
knew
Linton
's
*NL*
tones
,
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
hope
you
'll
die
in
a
garret
,
starved
to
death
!
'
said
the
boy
,
*NL*
mistaking
our
approach
for
that
of
his
negligent
attendant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
on
observing
his
error
:
his
cousin
flew
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
that
you
,
Miss
Linton
?
'
he
said
,
raising
his
head
from
the
arm
of
the
*NL*
great
chair
,
in
which
he
reclined
.
`
No
--
do
n't
kiss
me
:
it
takes
my
*NL*
breath
.
Dear
me
!
Papa
said
you
would
call
,
'
continued
he
,
after
*NL*
recovering
a
little
from
Catherine
's
embrace
;
while
she
stood
by
looking
*NL*
very
contrite
.
`
Will
you
shut
the
door
,
if
you
please
?
you
left
it
open
;
*NL*
and
those
--
those
_
detestable
_
creatures
wo
n't
bring
coals
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
It
's
so
cold
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
stirred
up
the
cinders
,
and
fetched
a
scuttleful
myself
.
The
invalid
*NL*
complained
of
being
covered
with
ashes
;
but
he
had
a
tiresome
cough
,
and
*NL*
looked
feverish
and
ill
,
so
I
did
not
rebuke
his
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Linton
,
'
murmured
Catherine
,
when
his
corrugated
brow
relaxed
,
*NL*
`
are
you
glad
to
see
me
?
Can
I
do
you
any
good
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
n't
you
come
before
?
'
he
asked
.
`
You
should
have
come
,
instead
*NL*
of
writing
.
It
tired
me
dreadfully
writing
those
long
letters
.
I
'd
far
*NL*
rather
have
talked
to
you
.
Now
,
I
can
neither
bear
to
talk
,
nor
anything
*NL*
else
.
I
wonder
where
Zillah
is
!
Will
you
'
-LRB-
looking
at
me
-RRB-
`
step
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
and
see
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
received
no
thanks
for
my
other
service
;
and
being
unwilling
to
run
*NL*
to
and
fro
at
his
behest
,
I
replied
--
`
Nobody
is
out
there
but
Joseph
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
to
drink
,
'
he
exclaimed
fretfully
,
turning
away
.
`
Zillah
is
*NL*
constantly
gadding
off
to
Gimmerton
since
papa
went
:
it
's
miserable
!
And
*NL*
I
'm
obliged
to
come
down
here
--
they
resolved
never
to
hear
me
up-stairs
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
your
father
attentive
to
you
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
'
I
asked
,
perceiving
*NL*
Catherine
to
be
checked
in
her
friendly
advances
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Attentive
?
He
makes
them
a
little
more
attentive
at
least
,
'
he
cried
.
*NL*
`
The
wretches
!
Do
you
know
,
Miss
Linton
,
that
brute
Hareton
laughs
at
*NL*
me
!
I
hate
him
!
indeed
,
I
hate
them
all
:
they
are
odious
beings
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
began
searching
for
some
water
;
she
lighted
on
a
pitcher
in
the
*NL*
dresser
,
filled
a
tumbler
,
and
brought
it
.
He
bid
her
add
a
spoonful
of
*NL*
wine
from
a
bottle
on
the
table
;
and
having
swallowed
a
small
portion
,
*NL*
appeared
more
tranquil
,
and
said
she
was
very
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
are
you
glad
to
see
me
?
'
asked
she
,
reiterating
her
former
question
*NL*
and
pleased
to
detect
the
faint
dawn
of
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
am
.
It
's
something
new
to
hear
a
voice
like
yours
!
'
he
replied
.
*NL*
`
But
I
have
been
vexed
,
because
you
would
n't
come
.
And
papa
swore
it
was
*NL*
owing
to
me
:
he
called
me
a
pitiful
,
shuffling
,
worthless
thing
;
and
said
*NL*
you
despised
me
;
and
if
he
had
been
in
my
place
,
he
would
be
more
the
*NL*
master
of
the
Grange
than
your
father
by
this
time
.
But
you
do
n't
*NL*
despise
me
,
do
you
,
Miss
--
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
you
would
say
Catherine
,
or
Cathy
,
'
interrupted
my
young
lady
.
*NL*
`
Despise
you
?
No
!
Next
to
papa
and
Ellen
,
I
love
you
better
than
*NL*
anybody
living
.
I
do
n't
love
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
though
;
and
I
dare
not
come
*NL*
when
he
returns
:
will
he
stay
away
many
days
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
many
,
'
answered
Linton
;
`
but
he
goes
on
to
the
moors
frequently
,
*NL*
since
the
shooting
season
commenced
;
and
you
might
spend
an
hour
or
two
*NL*
with
me
in
his
absence
.
Do
say
you
will
.
I
think
I
should
not
be
*NL*
peevish
with
you
:
you
'd
not
provoke
me
,
and
you
'd
always
be
ready
to
help
*NL*
me
,
would
n't
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
Catherine
,
stroking
his
long
soft
hair
:
`
if
I
could
only
get
*NL*
papa
's
consent
,
I
'd
spend
half
my
time
with
you
.
Pretty
Linton
!
I
wish
*NL*
you
were
my
brother
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
then
you
would
like
me
as
well
as
your
father
?
'
observed
he
,
more
*NL*
cheerfully
.
`
But
papa
says
you
would
love
me
better
than
him
and
all
the
*NL*
world
,
if
you
were
my
wife
;
so
I
'd
rather
you
were
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
should
never
love
anybody
better
than
papa
,
'
she
returned
gravely
.
*NL*
`
And
people
hate
their
wives
,
sometimes
;
but
not
their
sisters
and
*NL*
brothers
:
and
if
you
were
the
latter
,
you
would
live
with
us
,
and
papa
*NL*
would
be
as
fond
of
you
as
he
is
of
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
denied
that
people
ever
hated
their
wives
;
but
Cathy
affirmed
they
*NL*
did
,
and
,
in
her
wisdom
,
instanced
his
own
father
's
aversion
to
her
aunt
.
*NL*
I
endeavoured
to
stop
her
thoughtless
tongue
.
I
could
n't
succeed
till
*NL*
everything
she
knew
was
out
.
Master
Heathcliff
,
much
irritated
,
asserted
*NL*
her
relation
was
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Papa
told
me
;
and
papa
does
not
tell
falsehoods
,
'
she
answered
pertly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
My
_
papa
scorns
yours
!
'
cried
Linton
.
`
He
calls
him
a
sneaking
fool
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yours
is
a
wicked
man
,
'
retorted
Catherine
;
`
and
you
are
very
naughty
to
*NL*
dare
to
repeat
what
he
says
.
He
must
be
wicked
to
have
made
Aunt
*NL*
Isabella
leave
him
as
she
did
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
n't
leave
him
,
'
said
the
boy
;
`
you
sha
'n'
t
contradict
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
,
'
cried
my
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
!
'
said
Linton
.
`
Your
mother
hated
your
*NL*
father
:
now
then
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
exclaimed
Catherine
,
too
enraged
to
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
she
loved
mine
,
'
added
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
little
liar
!
I
hate
you
now
!
'
she
panted
,
and
her
face
grew
red
*NL*
with
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
did
!
she
did
!
'
sang
Linton
,
sinking
into
the
recess
of
his
chair
,
*NL*
and
leaning
back
his
head
to
enjoy
the
agitation
of
the
other
disputant
,
*NL*
who
stood
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
Master
Heathcliff
!
'
I
said
;
`
that
's
your
father
's
tale
,
too
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
n't
:
you
hold
your
tongue
!
'
he
answered
.
`
She
did
,
she
did
,
*NL*
Catherine
!
she
did
,
she
did
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
,
beside
herself
,
gave
the
chair
a
violent
push
,
and
caused
him
to
*NL*
fall
against
one
arm
.
He
was
immediately
seized
by
a
suffocating
cough
*NL*
that
soon
ended
his
triumph
.
It
lasted
so
long
that
it
frightened
even
*NL*
me
.
As
to
his
cousin
,
she
wept
with
all
her
might
,
aghast
at
the
*NL*
mischief
she
had
done
:
though
she
said
nothing
.
I
held
him
till
the
fit
*NL*
exhausted
itself
.
Then
he
thrust
me
away
,
and
leant
his
head
down
*NL*
silently
.
Catherine
quelled
her
lamentations
also
,
took
a
seat
opposite
,
*NL*
and
looked
solemnly
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
do
you
feel
now
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
'
I
inquired
,
after
waiting
ten
*NL*
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
_
she
_
felt
as
I
do
,
'
he
replied
:
`
spiteful
,
cruel
thing
!
Hareton
*NL*
never
touches
me
:
he
never
struck
me
in
his
life
.
And
I
was
better
*NL*
to-day
:
and
there
--
'
his
voice
died
in
a
whimper
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
did
n't
strike
you
!
'
muttered
Cathy
,
chewing
her
lip
to
prevent
*NL*
another
burst
of
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
and
moaned
like
one
under
great
suffering
,
and
kept
it
up
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
;
on
purpose
to
distress
his
cousin
apparently
,
for
*NL*
whenever
he
caught
a
stifled
sob
from
her
he
put
renewed
pain
and
pathos
*NL*
into
the
inflexions
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sorry
I
hurt
you
,
Linton
,
'
she
said
at
length
,
racked
beyond
*NL*
endurance
.
`
But
I
could
n't
have
been
hurt
by
that
little
push
,
and
I
had
*NL*
no
idea
that
you
could
,
either
:
you
're
not
much
,
are
you
,
Linton
?
Do
n't
*NL*
let
me
go
home
thinking
I
've
done
you
harm
.
Answer
!
speak
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
speak
to
you
,
'
he
murmured
;
`
you
've
hurt
me
so
that
I
shall
lie
*NL*
awake
all
night
choking
with
this
cough
.
If
you
had
it
you
'd
know
what
*NL*
it
was
;
but
_
you
'll
_
be
comfortably
asleep
while
I
'm
in
agony
,
and
nobody
*NL*
near
me
.
I
wonder
how
you
would
like
to
pass
those
fearful
nights
!
'
And
*NL*
he
began
to
wail
aloud
,
for
very
pity
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Since
you
are
in
the
habit
of
passing
dreadful
nights
,
'
I
said
,
`
it
*NL*
wo
n't
be
Miss
who
spoils
your
ease
:
you
'd
be
the
same
had
she
never
come
.
*NL*
However
,
she
shall
not
disturb
you
again
;
and
perhaps
you
'll
get
quieter
*NL*
when
we
leave
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
I
go
?
'
asked
Catherine
dolefully
,
bending
over
him
.
`
Do
you
want
*NL*
me
to
go
,
Linton
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
ca
n't
alter
what
you
've
done
,
'
he
replied
pettishly
,
shrinking
from
*NL*
her
,
`
unless
you
alter
it
for
the
worse
by
teasing
me
into
a
fever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
then
,
I
must
go
?
'
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
alone
,
at
least
,
'
said
he
;
'
I
ca
n't
bear
your
talking
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
,
and
resisted
my
persuasions
to
departure
a
tiresome
while
;
*NL*
but
as
he
neither
looked
up
nor
spoke
,
she
finally
made
a
movement
to
the
*NL*
door
,
and
I
followed
.
We
were
recalled
by
a
scream
.
Linton
had
slid
*NL*
from
his
seat
on
to
the
hearthstone
,
and
lay
writhing
in
the
mere
*NL*
perverseness
of
an
indulged
plague
of
a
child
,
determined
to
be
as
*NL*
grievous
and
harassing
as
it
can
.
I
thoroughly
gauged
his
disposition
*NL*
from
his
behaviour
,
and
saw
at
once
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
*NL*
humouring
him
.
Not
so
my
companion
:
she
ran
back
in
terror
,
knelt
down
,
*NL*
and
cried
,
and
soothed
,
and
entreated
,
till
he
grew
quiet
from
lack
of
*NL*
breath
:
by
no
means
from
compunction
at
distressing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
lift
him
on
to
the
settle
,
'
I
said
,
`
and
he
may
roll
about
as
he
*NL*
pleases
:
we
ca
n't
stop
to
watch
him
.
I
hope
you
are
satisfied
,
Miss
*NL*
Cathy
,
that
you
are
not
the
person
to
benefit
him
;
and
that
his
condition
*NL*
of
health
is
not
occasioned
by
attachment
to
you
.
Now
,
then
,
there
he
*NL*
is
!
Come
away
:
as
soon
as
he
knows
there
is
nobody
by
to
care
for
his
*NL*
nonsense
,
he
'll
be
glad
to
lie
still
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
placed
a
cushion
under
his
head
,
and
offered
him
some
water
;
he
*NL*
rejected
the
latter
,
and
tossed
uneasily
on
the
former
,
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
stone
or
a
block
of
wood
.
She
tried
to
put
it
more
comfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
do
with
that
,
'
he
said
;
`
it
's
not
high
enough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
brought
another
to
lay
above
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
too
high
,
'
murmured
the
provoking
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
must
I
arrange
it
,
then
?
'
she
asked
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
twined
himself
up
to
her
,
as
she
half
knelt
by
the
settle
,
and
*NL*
converted
her
shoulder
into
a
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
that
wo
n't
do
,
'
I
said
.
`
You
'll
be
content
with
the
cushion
,
Master
*NL*
Heathcliff
.
Miss
has
wasted
too
much
time
on
you
already
:
we
can
not
*NL*
remain
five
minutes
longer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
we
can
!
'
replied
Cathy
.
`
He
's
good
and
patient
now
.
He
's
*NL*
beginning
to
think
I
shall
have
far
greater
misery
than
he
will
to-night
,
*NL*
if
I
believe
he
is
the
worse
for
my
visit
:
and
then
I
dare
not
come
*NL*
again
.
Tell
the
truth
about
it
,
Linton
;
for
I
mus
n't
come
,
if
I
have
*NL*
hurt
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
come
,
to
cure
me
,
'
he
answered
.
`
You
ought
to
come
,
because
*NL*
you
have
hurt
me
:
you
know
you
have
extremely
!
I
was
not
as
ill
when
you
*NL*
entered
as
I
am
at
present
--
was
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
've
made
yourself
ill
by
crying
and
being
in
a
passion
.
--
I
did
n't
*NL*
do
it
all
,
'
said
his
cousin
.
`
However
,
we
'll
be
friends
now
.
And
you
*NL*
want
me
:
you
would
wish
to
see
me
sometimes
,
really
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
told
you
I
did
,
'
he
replied
impatiently
.
`
Sit
on
the
settle
and
let
*NL*
me
lean
on
your
knee
.
That
's
as
mamma
used
to
do
,
whole
afternoons
*NL*
together
.
Sit
quite
still
and
do
n't
talk
:
but
you
may
sing
a
song
,
if
*NL*
you
can
sing
;
or
you
may
say
a
nice
long
interesting
ballad
--
one
of
those
*NL*
you
promised
to
teach
me
;
or
a
story
.
I
'd
rather
have
a
ballad
,
though
:
*NL*
begin
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
repeated
the
longest
she
could
remember
.
The
employment
*NL*
pleased
both
mightily
.
Linton
would
have
another
,
and
after
that
*NL*
another
,
notwithstanding
my
strenuous
objections
;
and
so
they
went
on
*NL*
until
the
clock
struck
twelve
,
and
we
heard
Hareton
in
the
court
,
*NL*
returning
for
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
to-morrow
,
Catherine
,
will
you
be
here
to-morrow
?
'
asked
young
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
holding
her
frock
as
she
rose
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
I
answered
,
`
nor
next
day
neither
.
'
She
,
however
,
gave
a
different
*NL*
response
evidently
,
for
his
forehead
cleared
as
she
stooped
and
whispered
*NL*
in
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
go
to-morrow
,
recollect
,
Miss
!
'
I
commenced
,
when
we
were
out
*NL*
of
the
house
.
`
You
are
not
dreaming
of
it
,
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
I
'll
take
good
care
,
'
I
continued
:
`
I
'll
have
that
lock
mended
,
and
*NL*
you
can
escape
by
no
way
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
get
over
the
wall
,
'
she
said
laughing
.
`
The
Grange
is
not
a
*NL*
prison
,
Ellen
,
and
you
are
not
my
gaoler
.
And
besides
,
I
'm
almost
*NL*
seventeen
:
I
'm
a
woman
.
And
I
'm
certain
Linton
would
recover
quickly
if
*NL*
he
had
me
to
look
after
him
.
I
'm
older
than
he
is
,
you
know
,
and
wiser
:
*NL*
less
childish
,
am
I
not
?
And
he
'll
soon
do
as
I
direct
him
,
with
some
*NL*
slight
coaxing
.
He
's
a
pretty
little
darling
when
he
's
good
.
I
'd
make
*NL*
such
a
pet
of
him
,
if
he
were
mine
.
We
should
never
quarrel
,
should
we
*NL*
after
we
were
used
to
each
other
?
Do
n't
you
like
him
,
Ellen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Like
him
!
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
The
worst-tempered
bit
of
a
sickly
slip
that
*NL*
ever
struggled
into
its
teens
.
Happily
,
as
Mr.
Heathcliff
conjectured
,
*NL*
he
'll
not
win
twenty
.
I
doubt
whether
he
'll
see
spring
,
indeed
.
And
*NL*
small
loss
to
his
family
whenever
he
drops
off
.
And
lucky
it
is
for
us
*NL*
that
his
father
took
him
:
the
kinder
he
was
treated
,
the
more
tedious
and
*NL*
selfish
he
'd
be
.
I
'm
glad
you
have
no
chance
of
having
him
for
a
*NL*
husband
,
Miss
Catherine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
waxed
serious
at
hearing
this
speech
.
To
speak
of
his
death
*NL*
so
regardlessly
wounded
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
younger
than
I
,
'
she
answered
,
after
a
protracted
pause
of
*NL*
meditation
,
`
and
he
ought
to
live
the
longest
:
he
will
--
he
must
live
as
*NL*
long
as
I
do
.
He
's
as
strong
now
as
when
he
first
came
into
the
north
;
*NL*
I
'm
positive
of
that
.
It
's
only
a
cold
that
ails
him
,
the
same
as
papa
*NL*
has
.
You
say
papa
will
get
better
,
and
why
should
n't
he
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
well
,
'
I
cried
,
`
after
all
,
we
need
n't
trouble
ourselves
;
for
*NL*
listen
,
Miss
,
--
and
mind
,
I
'll
keep
my
word
,
--
if
you
attempt
going
to
*NL*
Wuthering
Heights
again
,
with
or
without
me
,
I
shall
inform
Mr.
Linton
,
*NL*
and
,
unless
he
allow
it
,
the
intimacy
with
your
cousin
must
not
be
*NL*
revived
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
has
been
revived
,
'
muttered
Cathy
,
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
not
be
continued
,
then
,
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
'll
see
,
'
was
her
reply
,
and
she
set
off
at
a
gallop
,
leaving
me
to
*NL*
toil
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
both
reached
home
before
our
dinner-time
;
my
master
supposed
we
had
*NL*
been
wandering
through
the
park
,
and
therefore
he
demanded
no
explanation
*NL*
of
our
absence
.
As
soon
as
I
entered
I
hastened
to
change
my
soaked
*NL*
shoes
and
stockings
;
but
sitting
such
awhile
at
the
Heights
had
done
the
*NL*
mischief
.
On
the
succeeding
morning
I
was
laid
up
,
and
during
three
*NL*
weeks
I
remained
incapacitated
for
attending
to
my
duties
:
a
calamity
*NL*
never
experienced
prior
to
that
period
,
and
never
,
I
am
thankful
to
say
,
*NL*
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
little
mistress
behaved
like
an
angel
in
coming
to
wait
on
me
,
and
*NL*
cheer
my
solitude
;
the
confinement
brought
me
exceedingly
low
.
It
is
*NL*
wearisome
,
to
a
stirring
active
body
:
but
few
have
slighter
reasons
for
*NL*
complaint
than
I
had
.
The
moment
Catherine
left
Mr.
Linton
's
room
she
*NL*
appeared
at
my
bedside
.
Her
day
was
divided
between
us
;
no
amusement
*NL*
usurped
a
minute
:
she
neglected
her
meals
,
her
studies
,
and
her
play
;
and
*NL*
she
was
the
fondest
nurse
that
ever
watched
.
She
must
have
had
a
warm
*NL*
heart
,
when
she
loved
her
father
so
,
to
give
so
much
to
me
.
I
said
her
*NL*
days
were
divided
between
us
;
but
the
master
retired
early
,
and
I
*NL*
generally
needed
nothing
after
six
o'clock
,
thus
the
evening
was
her
own
.
*NL*
Poor
thing
!
I
never
considered
what
she
did
with
herself
after
tea
.
And
*NL*
though
frequently
,
when
she
looked
in
to
bid
me
good-night
,
I
remarked
a
*NL*
fresh
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
a
pinkness
over
her
slender
fingers
,
*NL*
instead
of
fancying
the
line
borrowed
from
a
cold
ride
across
the
moors
,
*NL*
I
laid
it
to
the
charge
of
a
hot
fire
in
the
library
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
close
of
three
weeks
I
was
able
to
quit
my
chamber
and
move
about
*NL*
the
house
.
And
on
the
first
occasion
of
my
sitting
up
in
the
evening
I
*NL*
asked
Catherine
to
read
to
me
,
because
my
eyes
were
weak
.
We
were
in
the
*NL*
library
,
the
master
having
gone
to
bed
:
she
consented
,
rather
*NL*
unwillingly
,
I
fancied
;
and
imagining
my
sort
of
books
did
not
suit
her
,
*NL*
I
bid
her
please
herself
in
the
choice
of
what
she
perused
.
She
selected
*NL*
one
of
her
own
favourites
,
and
got
forward
steadily
about
an
hour
;
then
*NL*
came
frequent
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
are
not
you
tired
?
Had
n't
you
better
lie
down
now
?
You
'll
be
*NL*
sick
,
keeping
up
so
long
,
Ellen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
dear
,
I
'm
not
tired
,
'
I
returned
,
continually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
me
immovable
,
she
essayed
another
method
of
showing
her
*NL*
disrelish
for
her
occupation
.
It
changed
to
yawning
,
and
stretching
,
*NL*
and
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
I
'm
tired
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
over
then
and
talk
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
worse
:
she
fretted
and
sighed
,
and
looked
at
her
watch
till
*NL*
eight
,
and
finally
went
to
her
room
,
completely
overdone
with
sleep
;
*NL*
judging
by
her
peevish
,
heavy
look
,
and
the
constant
rubbing
she
*NL*
inflicted
on
her
eyes
.
The
following
night
she
seemed
more
impatient
*NL*
still
;
and
on
the
third
from
recovering
my
company
she
complained
of
a
*NL*
headache
,
and
left
me
.
I
thought
her
conduct
odd
;
and
having
remained
*NL*
alone
a
long
while
,
I
resolved
on
going
and
inquiring
whether
she
were
*NL*
better
,
and
asking
her
to
come
and
lie
on
the
sofa
,
instead
of
up-stairs
*NL*
in
the
dark
.
No
Catherine
could
I
discover
up-stairs
,
and
none
below
.
*NL*
The
servants
affirmed
they
had
not
seen
her
.
I
listened
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
*NL*
door
;
all
was
silence
.
I
returned
to
her
apartment
,
extinguished
my
*NL*
candle
,
and
seated
myself
in
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
shone
bright
;
a
sprinkling
of
snow
covered
the
ground
,
and
I
*NL*
reflected
that
she
might
,
possibly
,
have
taken
it
into
her
head
to
walk
*NL*
about
the
garden
,
for
refreshment
.
I
did
detect
a
figure
creeping
along
*NL*
the
inner
fence
of
the
park
;
but
it
was
not
my
young
mistress
:
on
its
*NL*
emerging
into
the
light
,
I
recognised
one
of
the
grooms
.
He
stood
a
*NL*
considerable
period
,
viewing
the
carriage-road
through
the
grounds
;
then
*NL*
started
off
at
a
brisk
pace
,
as
if
he
had
detected
something
,
and
*NL*
reappeared
presently
,
leading
Miss
's
pony
;
and
there
she
was
,
just
*NL*
dismounted
,
and
walking
by
its
side
.
The
man
took
his
charge
stealthily
*NL*
across
the
grass
towards
the
stable
.
Cathy
entered
by
the
*NL*
casement-window
of
the
drawing-room
,
and
glided
noiselessly
up
to
where
I
*NL*
awaited
her
.
She
put
the
door
gently
too
,
slipped
off
her
snowy
shoes
,
*NL*
untied
her
hat
,
and
was
proceeding
,
unconscious
of
my
espionage
,
to
lay
*NL*
aside
her
mantle
,
when
I
suddenly
rose
and
revealed
myself
.
The
surprise
*NL*
petrified
her
an
instant
:
she
uttered
an
inarticulate
exclamation
,
and
*NL*
stood
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
Miss
Catherine
,
'
I
began
,
too
vividly
impressed
by
her
recent
*NL*
kindness
to
break
into
a
scold
,
`
where
have
you
been
riding
out
at
this
*NL*
hour
?
And
why
should
you
try
to
deceive
me
by
telling
a
tale
?
Where
*NL*
have
you
been
?
Speak
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
the
bottom
of
the
park
,
'
she
stammered
.
'
I
did
n't
tell
a
tale
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
nowhere
else
?
'
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
was
the
muttered
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Catherine
!
'
I
cried
,
sorrowfully
.
`
You
know
you
have
been
doing
*NL*
wrong
,
or
you
would
n't
be
driven
to
uttering
an
untruth
to
me
.
That
does
*NL*
grieve
me
.
I
'd
rather
be
three
months
ill
,
than
hear
you
frame
a
*NL*
deliberate
lie
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
forward
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
threw
her
arms
round
my
*NL*
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Ellen
,
I
'm
so
afraid
of
you
being
angry
,
'
she
said
.
`
Promise
not
*NL*
to
be
angry
,
and
you
shall
know
the
very
truth
:
I
hate
to
hide
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
down
in
the
window-seat
;
I
assured
her
I
would
not
scold
,
whatever
*NL*
her
secret
might
be
,
and
I
guessed
it
,
of
course
;
so
she
commenced
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
been
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
Ellen
,
and
I
've
never
missed
going
a
day
*NL*
since
you
fell
ill
;
except
thrice
before
,
and
twice
after
you
left
your
*NL*
room
.
I
gave
Michael
books
and
pictures
to
prepare
Minny
every
evening
,
*NL*
and
to
put
her
back
in
the
stable
:
you
must
n't
scold
him
either
,
mind
.
I
*NL*
was
at
the
Heights
by
half-past
six
,
and
generally
stayed
till
half-past
*NL*
eight
,
and
then
galloped
home
.
It
was
not
to
amuse
myself
that
I
went
:
I
*NL*
was
often
wretched
all
the
time
.
Now
and
then
I
was
happy
:
once
in
a
*NL*
week
perhaps
.
At
first
,
I
expected
there
would
be
sad
work
persuading
*NL*
you
to
let
me
keep
my
word
to
Linton
:
for
I
had
engaged
to
call
again
*NL*
next
day
,
when
we
quitted
him
;
but
,
as
you
stayed
up-stairs
on
the
*NL*
morrow
,
I
escaped
that
trouble
.
While
Michael
was
refastening
the
lock
*NL*
of
the
park
door
in
the
afternoon
,
I
got
possession
of
the
key
,
and
told
*NL*
him
how
my
cousin
wished
me
to
visit
him
,
because
he
was
sick
,
and
*NL*
could
n't
come
to
the
Grange
;
and
how
papa
would
object
to
my
going
:
and
*NL*
then
I
negotiated
with
him
about
the
pony
.
He
is
fond
of
reading
,
and
he
*NL*
thinks
of
leaving
soon
to
get
married
;
so
he
offered
,
if
I
would
lend
him
*NL*
books
out
of
the
library
,
to
do
what
I
wished
:
but
I
preferred
giving
him
*NL*
my
own
,
and
that
satisfied
him
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
my
second
visit
Linton
seemed
in
lively
spirits
;
and
Zillah
-LRB-
that
is
*NL*
their
housekeeper
-RRB-
made
us
a
clean
room
and
a
good
fire
,
and
told
us
*NL*
that
,
as
Joseph
was
out
at
a
prayer-meeting
and
Hareton
Earnshaw
was
off
*NL*
with
his
dogs
--
robbing
our
woods
of
pheasants
,
as
I
heard
afterwards
--
we
*NL*
might
do
what
we
liked
.
She
brought
me
some
warm
wine
and
gingerbread
,
*NL*
and
appeared
exceedingly
good-natured
,
and
Linton
sat
in
the
arm-chair
,
*NL*
and
I
in
the
little
rocking
chair
on
the
hearth-stone
,
and
we
laughed
and
*NL*
talked
so
merrily
,
and
found
so
much
to
say
:
we
planned
where
we
would
*NL*
go
,
and
what
we
would
do
in
summer
.
I
need
n't
repeat
that
,
because
you
*NL*
would
call
it
silly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
time
,
however
,
we
were
near
quarrelling
.
He
said
the
pleasantest
*NL*
manner
of
spending
a
hot
July
day
was
lying
from
morning
till
evening
on
*NL*
a
bank
of
heath
in
the
middle
of
the
moors
,
with
the
bees
humming
*NL*
dreamily
about
among
the
bloom
,
and
the
larks
singing
high
up
overhead
,
*NL*
and
the
blue
sky
and
bright
sun
shining
steadily
and
cloudlessly
.
That
*NL*
was
his
most
perfect
idea
of
heaven
's
happiness
:
mine
was
rocking
in
a
*NL*
rustling
green
tree
,
with
a
west
wind
blowing
,
and
bright
white
clouds
*NL*
flitting
rapidly
above
;
and
not
only
larks
,
but
throstles
,
and
*NL*
blackbirds
,
and
linnets
,
and
cuckoos
pouring
out
music
on
every
side
,
and
*NL*
the
moors
seen
at
a
distance
,
broken
into
cool
dusky
dells
;
but
close
by
*NL*
great
swells
of
long
grass
undulating
in
waves
to
the
breeze
;
and
woods
*NL*
and
sounding
water
,
and
the
whole
world
awake
and
wild
with
joy
.
He
*NL*
wanted
all
to
lie
in
an
ecstasy
of
peace
;
I
wanted
all
to
sparkle
and
*NL*
dance
in
a
glorious
jubilee
.
I
said
his
heaven
would
be
only
half
alive
;
*NL*
and
he
said
mine
would
be
drunk
:
I
said
I
should
fall
asleep
in
his
;
and
*NL*
he
said
he
could
not
breathe
in
mine
,
and
began
to
grow
very
snappish
.
At
*NL*
last
,
we
agreed
to
try
both
,
as
soon
as
the
right
weather
came
;
and
then
*NL*
we
kissed
each
other
and
were
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
sitting
still
an
hour
,
I
looked
at
the
great
room
with
its
smooth
*NL*
uncarpeted
floor
,
and
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
play
in
,
if
we
*NL*
removed
the
table
;
and
I
asked
Linton
to
call
Zillah
in
to
help
us
,
and
*NL*
we
'd
have
a
game
at
blindman
's
-
buff
;
she
should
try
to
catch
us
:
you
used
*NL*
to
,
you
know
,
Ellen
.
He
would
n't
:
there
was
no
pleasure
in
it
,
he
said
;
*NL*
but
he
consented
to
play
at
ball
with
me
.
We
found
two
in
a
cupboard
,
*NL*
among
a
heap
of
old
toys
,
tops
,
and
hoops
,
and
battledores
and
*NL*
shuttlecocks
.
One
was
marked
C.
,
and
the
other
H.
;
I
wished
to
have
the
*NL*
C.
,
because
that
stood
for
Catherine
,
and
the
H.
might
be
for
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
his
name
;
but
the
bran
came
out
of
H.
,
and
Linton
did
n't
like
it
.
I
beat
*NL*
him
constantly
:
and
he
got
cross
again
,
and
coughed
,
and
returned
to
his
*NL*
chair
.
That
night
,
though
,
he
easily
recovered
his
good
humour
:
he
was
*NL*
charmed
with
two
or
three
pretty
songs
--
_
your
_
songs
,
Ellen
;
and
when
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
go
,
he
begged
and
entreated
me
to
come
the
following
*NL*
evening
;
and
I
promised
.
Minny
and
I
went
flying
home
as
light
as
air
;
*NL*
and
I
dreamt
of
Wuthering
Heights
and
my
sweet
,
darling
cousin
,
till
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
the
morrow
I
was
sad
;
partly
because
you
were
poorly
,
and
partly
that
*NL*
I
wished
my
father
knew
,
and
approved
of
my
excursions
:
but
it
was
*NL*
beautiful
moonlight
after
tea
;
and
,
as
I
rode
on
,
the
gloom
cleared
.
I
*NL*
shall
have
another
happy
evening
,
I
thought
to
myself
;
and
what
delights
*NL*
me
more
,
my
pretty
Linton
will
.
I
trotted
up
their
garden
,
and
was
*NL*
turning
round
to
the
back
,
when
that
fellow
Earnshaw
met
me
,
took
my
*NL*
bridle
,
and
bid
me
go
in
by
the
front
entrance
.
He
patted
Minny
's
neck
,
*NL*
and
said
she
was
a
bonny
beast
,
and
appeared
as
if
he
wanted
me
to
speak
*NL*
to
him
.
I
only
told
him
to
leave
my
horse
alone
,
or
else
it
would
kick
*NL*
him
.
He
answered
in
his
vulgar
accent
,
``
It
would
n't
do
mitch
hurt
if
it
*NL*
did
;
''
and
surveyed
its
legs
with
a
smile
.
I
was
half
inclined
to
make
it
*NL*
try
;
however
,
he
moved
off
to
open
the
door
,
and
,
as
he
raised
the
latch
,
*NL*
he
looked
up
to
the
inscription
above
,
and
said
,
with
a
stupid
mixture
of
*NL*
awkwardness
and
elation
:
``
Miss
Catherine
!
I
can
read
yon
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Wonderful
,
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
Pray
let
us
hear
you
--
you
_
are
_
grown
*NL*
clever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
spelt
,
and
drawled
over
by
syllables
,
the
name
--
``
Hareton
Earnshaw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
the
figures
?
''
I
cried
,
encouragingly
,
perceiving
that
he
came
to
a
*NL*
dead
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
can
not
tell
them
yet
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Oh
,
you
dunce
!
''
I
said
,
laughing
heartily
at
his
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
fool
stared
,
with
a
grin
hovering
about
his
lips
,
and
a
scowl
*NL*
gathering
over
his
eyes
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
might
not
join
in
my
*NL*
mirth
:
whether
it
were
not
pleasant
familiarity
,
or
what
it
really
was
,
*NL*
contempt
.
I
settled
his
doubts
,
by
suddenly
retrieving
my
gravity
and
*NL*
desiring
him
to
walk
away
,
for
I
came
to
see
Linton
,
not
him
.
He
*NL*
reddened
--
I
saw
that
by
the
moonlight
--
dropped
his
hand
from
the
latch
,
*NL*
and
skulked
off
,
a
picture
of
mortified
vanity
.
He
imagined
himself
to
*NL*
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
,
I
suppose
,
because
he
could
spell
his
own
*NL*
name
;
and
was
marvellously
discomfited
that
I
did
n't
think
the
same
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
Miss
Catherine
,
dear
!
'
--
I
interrupted
.
'
I
shall
not
scold
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
your
conduct
there
.
If
you
had
remembered
that
Hareton
was
*NL*
your
cousin
as
much
as
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
would
have
felt
how
*NL*
improper
it
was
to
behave
in
that
way
.
At
least
,
it
was
praiseworthy
*NL*
ambition
for
him
to
desire
to
be
as
accomplished
as
Linton
;
and
probably
*NL*
he
did
not
learn
merely
to
show
off
:
you
had
made
him
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
ignorance
before
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
and
he
wished
to
remedy
it
and
please
*NL*
you
.
To
sneer
at
his
imperfect
attempt
was
very
bad
breeding
.
Had
you
*NL*
been
brought
up
in
his
circumstances
,
would
you
be
less
rude
?
He
was
as
*NL*
quick
and
as
intelligent
a
child
as
ever
you
were
;
and
I
'm
hurt
that
he
*NL*
should
be
despised
now
,
because
that
base
Heathcliff
has
treated
him
so
*NL*
unjustly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Ellen
,
you
wo
n't
cry
about
it
,
will
you
?
'
she
exclaimed
,
surprised
*NL*
at
my
earnestness
.
`
But
wait
,
and
you
shall
hear
if
he
conned
his
A
B
C
*NL*
to
please
me
;
and
if
it
were
worth
while
being
civil
to
the
brute
.
I
*NL*
entered
;
Linton
was
lying
on
the
settle
,
and
half
got
up
to
welcome
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
'm
ill
to-night
,
Catherine
,
love
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
you
must
have
all
the
*NL*
talk
,
and
let
me
listen
.
Come
,
and
sit
by
me
.
I
was
sure
you
would
n't
*NL*
break
your
word
,
and
I
'll
make
you
promise
again
,
before
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
knew
now
that
I
must
n't
tease
him
,
as
he
was
ill
;
and
I
spoke
softly
*NL*
and
put
no
questions
,
and
avoided
irritating
him
in
any
way
.
I
had
*NL*
brought
some
of
my
nicest
books
for
him
:
he
asked
me
to
read
a
little
of
*NL*
one
,
and
I
was
about
to
comply
,
when
Earnshaw
burst
the
door
open
:
having
*NL*
gathered
venom
with
reflection
.
He
advanced
direct
to
us
,
seized
Linton
*NL*
by
the
arm
,
and
swung
him
off
the
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Get
to
thy
own
room
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
voice
almost
inarticulate
with
*NL*
passion
;
and
his
face
looked
swelled
and
furious
.
``
Take
her
there
if
she
*NL*
comes
to
see
thee
:
thou
shall
n't
keep
me
out
of
this
.
Begone
wi
'
ye
*NL*
both
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
swore
at
us
,
and
left
Linton
no
time
to
answer
,
nearly
throwing
him
*NL*
into
the
kitchen
;
and
he
clenched
his
fist
as
I
followed
,
seemingly
*NL*
longing
to
knock
me
down
.
I
was
afraid
for
a
moment
,
and
I
let
one
*NL*
volume
fall
;
he
kicked
it
after
me
,
and
shut
us
out
.
I
heard
a
*NL*
malignant
,
crackly
laugh
by
the
fire
,
and
turning
,
beheld
that
odious
*NL*
Joseph
standing
rubbing
his
bony
hands
,
and
quivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
wer

He

*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Where
must
we
go

''
I
asked
of
my
cousin
,
disregarding
the
old
wretch
's
*NL*
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Linton
was
white
and
trembling
.
He
was
not
pretty
then
,
Ellen
:
oh
,
no
!
*NL*
he
looked
frightful
;
for
his
thin
face
and
large
eyes
were
wrought
into
*NL*
an
expression
of
frantic
,
powerless
fury
.
He
grasped
the
handle
of
the
*NL*
door
,
and
shook
it
:
it
was
fastened
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
If

--
If

n't

,

''
he
rather
shrieked
than
said
.
``
Devil
!
devil
!
--
I
'll
kill
*NL*
you
--
I
'll
kill
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
uttered
his
croaking
laugh
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Thear
,
that
's
t
'
father

''
he
cried
.
``
That

''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
took
hold
of
Linton
's
hands
,
and
tried
to
pull
him
away
;
but
he
*NL*
shrieked
so
shockingly
that
I
dared
not
proceed
.
At
last
his
cries
were
*NL*
choked
by
a
dreadful
fit
of
coughing
;
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
,
and
he
*NL*
fell
on
the
ground
.
I
ran
into
the
yard
,
sick
with
terror
;
and
called
*NL*
for
Zillah
,
as
loud
as
I
could
.
She
soon
heard
me
:
she
was
milking
the
*NL*
cows
in
a
shed
behind
the
barn
,
and
hurrying
from
her
work
,
she
inquired
*NL*
what
there
was
to
do
?
I
had
n't
breath
to
explain
;
dragging
her
in
,
I
*NL*
looked
about
for
Linton
.
Earnshaw
had
come
out
to
examine
the
mischief
*NL*
he
had
caused
,
and
he
was
then
conveying
the
poor
thing
up-stairs
.
Zillah
*NL*
and
I
ascended
after
him
;
but
he
stopped
me
at
the
top
of
the
steps
,
and
*NL*
said
I
should
n't
go
in
:
I
must
go
home
.
I
exclaimed
that
he
had
killed
*NL*
Linton
,
and
I
_
would
_
enter
.
Joseph
locked
the
door
,
and
declared
I
*NL*
should
do
``
no
sich
stuff
,
''
and
asked
me
whether
I
were
``
bahn
to
be
as
mad
*NL*
as
him
.
''
I
stood
crying
till
the
housekeeper
reappeared
.
She
affirmed
*NL*
he
would
be
better
in
a
bit
,
but
he
could
n't
do
with
that
shrieking
and
*NL*
din
;
and
she
took
me
,
and
nearly
carried
me
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ellen
,
I
was
ready
to
tear
my
hair
off
my
head
!
I
sobbed
and
wept
so
*NL*
that
my
eyes
were
almost
blind
;
and
the
ruffian
you
have
such
sympathy
*NL*
with
stood
opposite
:
presuming
every
now
and
then
to
bid
me
``
wisht
,
''
and
*NL*
denying
that
it
was
his
fault
;
and
,
finally
,
frightened
by
my
assertions
*NL*
that
I
would
tell
papa
,
and
that
he
should
be
put
in
prison
and
hanged
,
*NL*
he
commenced
blubbering
himself
,
and
hurried
out
to
hide
his
cowardly
*NL*
agitation
.
Still
,
I
was
not
rid
of
him
:
when
at
length
they
compelled
me
*NL*
to
depart
,
and
I
had
got
some
hundred
yards
off
the
premises
,
he
suddenly
*NL*
issued
from
the
shadow
of
the
road-side
,
and
checked
Minny
and
took
hold
*NL*
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Miss
Catherine
,
I
'm
ill
grieved
,
''
he
began
,
``
but
it
's
rayther
too
bad
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
gave
him
a
cut
with
my
whip
,
thinking
perhaps
he
would
murder
me
.
He
*NL*
let
go
,
thundering
one
of
his
horrid
curses
,
and
I
galloped
home
more
*NL*
than
half
out
of
my
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
bid
you
good-night
that
evening
,
and
I
did
n't
go
to
Wuthering
*NL*
Heights
the
next
:
I
wished
to
go
exceedingly
;
but
I
was
strangely
*NL*
excited
,
and
dreaded
to
hear
that
Linton
was
dead
,
sometimes
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
encountering
Hareton
.
On
the
third
*NL*
day
I
took
courage
:
at
least
,
I
could
n't
bear
longer
suspense
,
and
stole
*NL*
off
once
more
.
I
went
at
five
o'clock
,
and
walked
;
fancying
I
might
*NL*
manage
to
creep
into
the
house
,
and
up
to
Linton
's
room
,
unobserved
.
*NL*
However
,
the
dogs
gave
notice
of
my
approach
.
Zillah
received
me
,
and
*NL*
saying
``
the
lad
was
mending
nicely
,
''
showed
me
into
a
small
,
tidy
,
*NL*
carpeted
apartment
,
where
,
to
my
inexpressible
joy
,
I
beheld
Linton
laid
*NL*
on
a
little
sofa
,
reading
one
of
my
books
.
But
he
would
neither
speak
to
*NL*
me
nor
look
at
me
,
through
a
whole
hour
,
Ellen
:
he
has
such
an
unhappy
*NL*
temper
.
And
what
quite
confounded
me
,
when
he
did
open
his
mouth
,
it
was
*NL*
to
utter
the
falsehood
that
I
had
occasioned
the
uproar
,
and
Hareton
was
*NL*
not
to
blame
!
Unable
to
reply
,
except
passionately
,
I
got
up
and
walked
*NL*
from
the
room
.
He
sent
after
me
a
faint
``
Catherine
!
''
He
did
not
reckon
*NL*
on
being
answered
so
:
but
I
would
n't
turn
back
;
and
the
morrow
was
the
*NL*
second
day
on
which
I
stayed
at
home
,
nearly
determined
to
visit
him
no
*NL*
more
.
But
it
was
so
miserable
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
,
and
never
*NL*
hearing
anything
about
him
,
that
my
resolution
melted
into
air
before
it
*NL*
was
properly
formed
.
It
had
appeared
wrong
to
take
the
journey
once
;
now
*NL*
it
seemed
wrong
to
refrain
.
Michael
came
to
ask
if
he
must
saddle
Minny
;
*NL*
I
said
``
Yes
,
''
and
considered
myself
doing
a
duty
as
she
bore
me
over
the
*NL*
hills
.
I
was
forced
to
pass
the
front
windows
to
get
to
the
court
:
it
*NL*
was
no
use
trying
to
conceal
my
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Young
master
is
in
the
house
,
''
said
Zillah
,
as
she
saw
me
making
for
*NL*
the
parlour
.
I
went
in
;
Earnshaw
was
there
also
,
but
he
quitted
the
room
*NL*
directly
.
Linton
sat
in
the
great
arm-chair
half
asleep
;
walking
up
to
*NL*
the
fire
,
I
began
in
a
serious
tone
,
partly
meaning
it
to
be
true
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
As
you
do
n't
like
me
,
Linton
,
and
as
you
think
I
come
on
purpose
to
*NL*
hurt
you
,
and
pretend
that
I
do
so
every
time
,
this
is
our
last
meeting
:
*NL*
let
us
say
good-bye
;
and
tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
you
have
no
wish
to
see
*NL*
me
,
and
that
he
must
n't
invent
any
more
falsehoods
on
the
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Sit
down
and
take
your
hat
off
,
Catherine
,
''
he
answered
.
``
You
are
so
*NL*
much
happier
than
I
am
,
you
ought
to
be
better
.
Papa
talks
enough
of
my
*NL*
defects
,
and
shows
enough
scorn
of
me
,
to
make
it
natural
I
should
doubt
*NL*
myself
.
I
doubt
whether
I
am
not
altogether
as
worthless
as
he
calls
me
,
*NL*
frequently
;
and
then
I
feel
so
cross
and
bitter
,
I
hate
everybody
!
I
am
*NL*
worthless
,
and
bad
in
temper
,
and
bad
in
spirit
,
almost
always
;
and
,
if
*NL*
you
choose
,
you
may
say
good-bye
:
you
'll
get
rid
of
an
annoyance
.
Only
,
*NL*
Catherine
,
do
me
this
justice
:
believe
that
if
I
might
be
as
sweet
,
and
*NL*
as
kind
,
and
as
good
as
you
are
,
I
would
be
;
as
willingly
,
and
more
so
,
*NL*
than
as
happy
and
as
healthy
.
And
believe
that
your
kindness
has
made
me
*NL*
love
you
deeper
than
if
I
deserved
your
love
:
and
though
I
could
n't
,
and
*NL*
can
not
help
showing
my
nature
to
you
,
I
regret
it
and
repent
it
;
and
*NL*
shall
regret
and
repent
it
till
I
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
felt
he
spoke
the
truth
;
and
I
felt
I
must
forgive
him
:
and
,
though
we
*NL*
should
quarrel
the
next
moment
,
I
must
forgive
him
again
.
We
were
*NL*
reconciled
;
but
we
cried
,
both
of
us
,
the
whole
time
I
stayed
:
not
*NL*
entirely
for
sorrow
;
yet
I
_
was
_
sorry
Linton
had
that
distorted
nature
.
*NL*
He
'll
never
let
his
friends
be
at
ease
,
and
he
'll
never
be
at
ease
*NL*
himself
!
I
have
always
gone
to
his
little
parlour
,
since
that
night
;
*NL*
because
his
father
returned
the
day
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
three
times
,
I
think
,
we
have
been
merry
and
hopeful
,
as
we
were
*NL*
the
first
evening
;
the
rest
of
my
visits
were
dreary
and
troubled
:
now
*NL*
with
his
selfishness
and
spite
,
and
now
with
his
sufferings
:
but
I
've
*NL*
learned
to
endure
the
former
with
nearly
as
little
resentment
as
the
*NL*
latter
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
purposely
avoids
me
:
I
have
hardly
seen
him
at
*NL*
all
.
Last
Sunday
,
indeed
,
coming
earlier
than
usual
,
I
heard
him
abusing
*NL*
poor
Linton
cruelly
for
his
conduct
of
the
night
before
.
I
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
how
he
knew
of
it
,
unless
he
listened
.
Linton
had
certainly
behaved
*NL*
provokingly
:
however
,
it
was
the
business
of
nobody
but
me
,
and
I
*NL*
interrupted
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
lecture
by
entering
and
telling
him
so
.
He
*NL*
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
went
away
,
saying
he
was
glad
I
took
that
view
of
*NL*
the
matter
.
Since
then
,
I
've
told
Linton
he
must
whisper
his
bitter
*NL*
things
.
Now
,
Ellen
,
you
have
heard
all
.
I
ca
n't
be
prevented
from
going
*NL*
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
except
by
inflicting
misery
on
two
people
;
whereas
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
only
not
tell
papa
,
my
going
need
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
*NL*
none
.
You
'll
not
tell
,
will
you
?
It
will
be
very
heartless
,
if
you
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
make
up
my
mind
on
that
point
by
to-morrow
,
Miss
Catherine
,
'
I
*NL*
replied
.
`
It
requires
some
study
;
and
so
I
'll
leave
you
to
your
rest
,
*NL*
and
go
think
it
over
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
it
over
aloud
,
in
my
master
's
presence
;
walking
straight
from
*NL*
her
room
to
his
,
and
relating
the
whole
story
:
with
the
exception
of
her
*NL*
conversations
with
her
cousin
,
and
any
mention
of
Hareton
.
Mr.
Linton
*NL*
was
alarmed
and
distressed
,
more
than
he
would
acknowledge
to
me
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
,
Catherine
learnt
my
betrayal
of
her
confidence
,
and
she
learnt
*NL*
also
that
her
secret
visits
were
to
end
.
In
vain
she
wept
and
writhed
*NL*
against
the
interdict
,
and
implored
her
father
to
have
pity
on
Linton
:
*NL*
all
she
got
to
comfort
her
was
a
promise
that
he
would
write
and
give
him
*NL*
leave
to
come
to
the
Grange
when
he
pleased
;
but
explaining
that
he
must
*NL*
no
longer
expect
to
see
Catherine
at
Wuthering
Heights
.
Perhaps
,
had
he
*NL*
been
aware
of
his
nephew
's
disposition
and
state
of
health
,
he
would
have
*NL*
seen
fit
to
withhold
even
that
slight
consolation
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
These
things
happened
last
winter
,
sir
,
'
said
Mrs.
Dean
;
`
hardly
more
*NL*
than
a
year
ago
.
Last
winter
,
I
did
not
think
,
at
another
twelve
months
'
*NL*
end
,
I
should
be
amusing
a
stranger
to
the
family
with
relating
them
!
*NL*
Yet
,
who
knows
how
long
you
'll
be
a
stranger
?
You
're
too
young
to
rest
*NL*
always
contented
,
living
by
yourself
;
and
I
some
way
fancy
no
one
could
*NL*
see
Catherine
Linton
and
not
love
her
.
You
smile
;
but
why
do
you
look
so
*NL*
lively
and
interested
when
I
talk
about
her
?
and
why
have
you
asked
me
to
*NL*
hang
her
picture
over
your
fireplace
?
and
why
--
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
my
good
friend
!
'
I
cried
.
`
It
may
be
very
possible
that
_
I
_
*NL*
should
love
her
;
but
would
she
love
me
?
I
doubt
it
too
much
to
venture
*NL*
my
tranquillity
by
running
into
temptation
:
and
then
my
home
is
not
here
.
*NL*
I
'm
of
the
busy
world
,
and
to
its
arms
I
must
return
.
Go
on
.
Was
*NL*
Catherine
obedient
to
her
father
's
commands
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
,
'
continued
the
housekeeper
.
`
Her
affection
for
him
was
still
*NL*
the
chief
sentiment
in
her
heart
;
and
he
spoke
without
anger
:
he
spoke
in
*NL*
the
deep
tenderness
of
one
about
to
leave
his
treasure
amid
perils
and
*NL*
foes
,
where
his
remembered
words
would
be
the
only
aid
that
he
could
*NL*
bequeath
to
guide
her
.
He
said
to
me
,
a
few
days
afterwards
,
``
I
wish
my
*NL*
nephew
would
write
,
Ellen
,
or
call
.
Tell
me
,
sincerely
,
what
you
think
*NL*
of
him
:
is
he
changed
for
the
better
,
or
is
there
a
prospect
of
*NL*
improvement
,
as
he
grows
a
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
's
very
delicate
,
sir
,
''
I
replied
;
``
and
scarcely
likely
to
reach
*NL*
manhood
:
but
this
I
can
say
,
he
does
not
resemble
his
father
;
and
if
Miss
*NL*
Catherine
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
him
,
he
would
not
be
beyond
her
*NL*
control
:
unless
she
were
extremely
and
foolishly
indulgent
.
However
,
*NL*
master
,
you
'll
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
acquainted
with
him
and
see
*NL*
whether
he
would
suit
her
:
it
wants
four
years
and
more
to
his
being
of
*NL*
age
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
sighed
;
and
,
walking
to
the
window
,
looked
out
towards
Gimmerton
*NL*
Kirk
.
It
was
a
misty
afternoon
,
but
the
February
sun
shone
dimly
,
and
we
*NL*
could
just
distinguish
the
two
fir-trees
in
the
yard
,
and
the
*NL*
sparely-scattered
gravestones
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
prayed
often
,
'
he
half
soliloquised
,
`
for
the
approach
of
what
is
*NL*
coming
;
and
now
I
begin
to
shrink
,
and
fear
it
.
I
thought
the
memory
of
*NL*
the
hour
I
came
down
that
glen
a
bridegroom
would
be
less
sweet
than
the
*NL*
anticipation
that
I
was
soon
,
in
a
few
months
,
or
,
possibly
,
weeks
,
to
be
*NL*
carried
up
,
and
laid
in
its
lonely
hollow
!
Ellen
,
I
've
been
very
happy
*NL*
with
my
little
Cathy
:
through
winter
nights
and
summer
days
she
was
a
*NL*
living
hope
at
my
side
.
But
I
've
been
as
happy
musing
by
myself
among
*NL*
those
stones
,
under
that
old
church
:
lying
,
through
the
long
June
*NL*
evenings
,
on
the
green
mound
of
her
mother
's
grave
,
and
wishing
--
yearning
*NL*
for
the
time
when
I
might
lie
beneath
it
.
What
can
I
do
for
Cathy
?
How
*NL*
must
I
quit
her
?
I
'd
not
care
one
moment
for
Linton
being
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
son
;
nor
for
his
taking
her
from
me
,
if
he
could
console
her
for
my
loss
.
*NL*
I
'd
not
care
that
Heathcliff
gained
his
ends
,
and
triumphed
in
robbing
me
*NL*
of
my
last
blessing
!
But
should
Linton
be
unworthy
--
only
a
feeble
tool
*NL*
to
his
father
--
I
can
not
abandon
her
to
him
!
And
,
hard
though
it
be
to
*NL*
crush
her
buoyant
spirit
,
I
must
persevere
in
making
her
sad
while
I
*NL*
live
,
and
leaving
her
solitary
when
I
die
.
Darling
!
I
'd
rather
resign
*NL*
her
to
God
,
and
lay
her
in
the
earth
before
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Resign
her
to
God
as
it
is
,
sir
,
'
I
answered
,
`
and
if
we
should
lose
*NL*
you
--
which
may
He
forbid
--
under
His
providence
,
I
'll
stand
her
friend
and
*NL*
counsellor
to
the
last
.
Miss
Catherine
is
a
good
girl
:
I
do
n't
fear
that
*NL*
she
will
go
wilfully
wrong
;
and
people
who
do
their
duty
are
always
*NL*
finally
rewarded
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
advanced
;
yet
my
master
gathered
no
real
strength
,
though
he
*NL*
resumed
his
walks
in
the
grounds
with
his
daughter
.
To
her
inexperienced
*NL*
notions
,
this
itself
was
a
sign
of
convalescence
;
and
then
his
cheek
was
*NL*
often
flushed
,
and
his
eyes
were
bright
;
she
felt
sure
of
his
recovering
.
*NL*
On
her
seventeenth
birthday
,
he
did
not
visit
the
churchyard
:
it
was
*NL*
raining
,
and
I
observed
--
`
You
'll
surely
not
go
out
to-night
,
sir
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
,
--
`
No
,
I
'll
defer
it
this
year
a
little
longer
.
'
He
wrote
*NL*
again
to
Linton
,
expressing
his
great
desire
to
see
him
;
and
,
had
the
*NL*
invalid
been
presentable
,
I
've
no
doubt
his
father
would
have
permitted
*NL*
him
to
come
.
As
it
was
,
being
instructed
,
he
returned
an
answer
,
*NL*
intimating
that
Mr.
Heathcliff
objected
to
his
calling
at
the
Grange
;
but
*NL*
his
uncle
's
kind
remembrance
delighted
him
,
and
he
hoped
to
meet
him
*NL*
sometimes
in
his
rambles
,
and
personally
to
petition
that
his
cousin
and
*NL*
he
might
not
remain
long
so
utterly
divided
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
part
of
his
letter
was
simple
,
and
probably
his
own
.
Heathcliff
*NL*
knew
he
could
plead
eloquently
for
Catherine
's
company
,
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
ask
,
'
he
said
,
`
that
she
may
visit
here
;
but
am
I
never
to
see
*NL*
her
,
because
my
father
forbids
me
to
go
to
her
home
,
and
you
forbid
her
*NL*
to
come
to
mine
?
Do
,
now
and
then
,
ride
with
her
towards
the
Heights
;
*NL*
and
let
us
exchange
a
few
words
,
in
your
presence
!
We
have
done
nothing
*NL*
to
deserve
this
separation
;
and
you
are
not
angry
with
me
:
you
have
no
*NL*
reason
to
dislike
me
,
you
allow
,
yourself
.
Dear
uncle
!
send
me
a
kind
*NL*
note
to-morrow
,
and
leave
to
join
you
anywhere
you
please
,
except
at
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
.
I
believe
an
interview
would
convince
you
that
my
*NL*
father
's
character
is
not
mine
:
he
affirms
I
am
more
your
nephew
than
his
*NL*
son
;
and
though
I
have
faults
which
render
me
unworthy
of
Catherine
,
she
*NL*
has
excused
them
,
and
for
her
sake
,
you
should
also
.
You
inquire
after
*NL*
my
health
--
it
is
better
;
but
while
I
remain
cut
off
from
all
hope
,
and
*NL*
doomed
to
solitude
,
or
the
society
of
those
who
never
did
and
never
will
*NL*
like
me
,
how
can
I
be
cheerful
and
well
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
,
though
he
felt
for
the
boy
,
could
not
consent
to
grant
his
*NL*
request
;
because
he
could
not
accompany
Catherine
.
He
said
,
in
summer
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
they
might
meet
:
meantime
,
he
wished
him
to
continue
writing
at
*NL*
intervals
,
and
engaged
to
give
him
what
advice
and
comfort
he
was
able
by
*NL*
letter
;
being
well
aware
of
his
hard
position
in
his
family
.
Linton
*NL*
complied
;
and
had
he
been
unrestrained
,
would
probably
have
spoiled
all
*NL*
by
filling
his
epistles
with
complaints
and
lamentations
:
but
his
father
*NL*
kept
a
sharp
watch
over
him
;
and
,
of
course
,
insisted
on
every
line
that
*NL*
my
master
sent
being
shown
;
so
,
instead
of
penning
his
peculiar
personal
*NL*
sufferings
and
distresses
,
the
themes
constantly
uppermost
in
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
he
harped
on
the
cruel
obligation
of
being
held
asunder
from
*NL*
his
friend
and
love
;
and
gently
intimated
that
Mr.
Linton
must
allow
an
*NL*
interview
soon
,
or
he
should
fear
he
was
purposely
deceiving
him
with
*NL*
empty
promises
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
was
a
powerful
ally
at
home
;
and
between
them
they
at
length
*NL*
persuaded
my
master
to
acquiesce
in
their
having
a
ride
or
a
walk
*NL*
together
about
once
a
week
,
under
my
guardianship
,
and
on
the
moors
*NL*
nearest
the
Grange
:
for
June
found
him
still
declining
.
Though
he
had
*NL*
set
aside
yearly
a
portion
of
his
income
for
my
young
lady
's
fortune
,
he
*NL*
had
a
natural
desire
that
she
might
retain
--
or
at
least
return
in
a
short
*NL*
time
to
--
the
house
of
her
ancestors
;
and
he
considered
her
only
prospect
*NL*
of
doing
that
was
by
a
union
with
his
heir
;
he
had
no
idea
that
the
*NL*
latter
was
failing
almost
as
fast
as
himself
;
nor
had
any
one
,
I
believe
:
*NL*
no
doctor
visited
the
Heights
,
and
no
one
saw
Master
Heathcliff
to
make
*NL*
report
of
his
condition
among
us
.
I
,
for
my
part
,
began
to
fancy
my
*NL*
forebodings
were
false
,
and
that
he
must
be
actually
rallying
,
when
he
*NL*
mentioned
riding
and
walking
on
the
moors
,
and
seemed
so
earnest
in
*NL*
pursuing
his
object
.
I
could
not
picture
a
father
treating
a
dying
child
*NL*
as
tyrannically
and
wickedly
as
I
afterwards
learned
Heathcliff
had
*NL*
treated
him
,
to
compel
this
apparent
eagerness
:
his
efforts
redoubling
*NL*
the
more
imminently
his
avaricious
and
unfeeling
plans
were
threatened
*NL*
with
defeat
by
death
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Summer
was
already
past
its
prime
,
when
Edgar
reluctantly
yielded
his
*NL*
assent
to
their
entreaties
,
and
Catherine
and
I
set
out
on
our
first
ride
*NL*
to
join
her
cousin
.
It
was
a
close
,
sultry
day
:
devoid
of
sunshine
,
but
*NL*
with
a
sky
too
dappled
and
hazy
to
threaten
rain
:
and
our
place
of
*NL*
meeting
had
been
fixed
at
the
guide-stone
,
by
the
cross-roads
.
On
*NL*
arriving
there
,
however
,
a
little
herd-boy
,
despatched
as
a
messenger
,
*NL*
told
us
that
,
--
`
Maister
Linton
wer
just
o
'
this
side
th
'
Heights
:
and
*NL*
he
'd
be
mitch
obleeged
to
us
to
gang
on
a
bit
further
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
Master
Linton
has
forgot
the
first
injunction
of
his
uncle
,
'
I
*NL*
observed
:
`
he
bid
us
keep
on
the
Grange
land
,
and
here
we
are
off
at
*NL*
once
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
we
'll
turn
our
horses
'
heads
round
when
we
reach
him
,
'
answered
my
*NL*
companion
;
`
our
excursion
shall
lie
towards
home
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
we
reached
him
,
and
that
was
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
*NL*
his
own
door
,
we
found
he
had
no
horse
;
and
we
were
forced
to
dismount
,
*NL*
and
leave
ours
to
graze
.
He
lay
on
the
heath
,
awaiting
our
approach
,
and
*NL*
did
not
rise
till
we
came
within
a
few
yards
.
Then
he
walked
so
feebly
,
*NL*
and
looked
so
pale
,
that
I
immediately
exclaimed
,
--
`
Why
,
Master
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
you
are
not
fit
for
enjoying
a
ramble
this
morning
.
How
ill
*NL*
you
do
look
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
surveyed
him
with
grief
and
astonishment
:
she
changed
the
*NL*
ejaculation
of
joy
on
her
lips
to
one
of
alarm
;
and
the
congratulation
on
*NL*
their
long-postponed
meeting
to
an
anxious
inquiry
,
whether
he
were
worse
*NL*
than
usual
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
--
better
--
better
!
'
he
panted
,
trembling
,
and
retaining
her
hand
as
if
*NL*
he
needed
its
support
,
while
his
large
blue
eyes
wandered
timidly
over
*NL*
her
;
the
hollowness
round
them
transforming
to
haggard
wildness
the
*NL*
languid
expression
they
once
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
have
been
worse
,
'
persisted
his
cousin
;
`
worse
than
when
I
saw
*NL*
you
last
;
you
are
thinner
,
and
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
tired
,
'
he
interrupted
,
hurriedly
.
`
It
is
too
hot
for
walking
,
let
*NL*
us
rest
here
.
And
,
in
the
morning
,
I
often
feel
sick
--
papa
says
I
grow
*NL*
so
fast
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Badly
satisfied
,
Cathy
sat
down
,
and
he
reclined
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
something
like
your
paradise
,
'
said
she
,
making
an
effort
at
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
`
You
recollect
the
two
days
we
agreed
to
spend
in
the
*NL*
place
and
way
each
thought
pleasantest
?
This
is
nearly
yours
,
only
there
*NL*
are
clouds
;
but
then
they
are
so
soft
and
mellow
:
it
is
nicer
than
*NL*
sunshine
.
Next
week
,
if
you
can
,
we
'll
ride
down
to
the
Grange
Park
,
and
*NL*
try
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
did
not
appear
to
remember
what
she
talked
of
and
he
had
evidently
*NL*
great
difficulty
in
sustaining
any
kind
of
conversation
.
His
lack
of
*NL*
interest
in
the
subjects
she
started
,
and
his
equal
incapacity
to
*NL*
contribute
to
her
entertainment
,
were
so
obvious
that
she
could
not
*NL*
conceal
her
disappointment
.
An
indefinite
alteration
had
come
over
his
*NL*
whole
person
and
manner
.
The
pettishness
that
might
be
caressed
into
*NL*
fondness
,
had
yielded
to
a
listless
apathy
;
there
was
less
of
the
peevish
*NL*
temper
of
a
child
which
frets
and
teases
on
purpose
to
be
soothed
,
and
*NL*
more
of
the
self-absorbed
moroseness
of
a
confirmed
invalid
,
repelling
*NL*
consolation
,
and
ready
to
regard
the
good-humoured
mirth
of
others
as
an
*NL*
insult
.
Catherine
perceived
,
as
well
as
I
did
,
that
he
held
it
rather
a
*NL*
punishment
,
than
a
gratification
,
to
endure
our
company
;
and
she
made
no
*NL*
scruple
of
proposing
,
presently
,
to
depart
.
That
proposal
,
unexpectedly
,
*NL*
roused
Linton
from
his
lethargy
,
and
threw
him
into
a
strange
state
of
*NL*
agitation
.
He
glanced
fearfully
towards
the
Heights
,
begging
she
would
*NL*
remain
another
half-hour
,
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
think
,
'
said
Cathy
,
`
you
'd
be
more
comfortable
at
home
than
*NL*
sitting
here
;
and
I
can
not
amuse
you
to-day
,
I
see
,
by
my
tales
,
and
*NL*
songs
,
and
chatter
:
you
have
grown
wiser
than
I
,
in
these
six
months
;
you
*NL*
have
little
taste
for
my
diversions
now
:
or
else
,
if
I
could
amuse
you
,
*NL*
I
'd
willingly
stay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
to
rest
yourself
,
'
he
replied
.
`
And
,
Catherine
,
do
n't
think
or
say
*NL*
that
I
'm
_
very
_
unwell
:
it
is
the
heavy
weather
and
heat
that
make
me
*NL*
dull
;
and
I
walked
about
,
before
you
came
,
a
great
deal
for
me
.
Tell
*NL*
uncle
I
'm
in
tolerable
health
,
will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
him
that
_
you
_
say
so
,
Linton
.
I
could
n't
affirm
that
you
*NL*
are
,
'
observed
my
young
lady
,
wondering
at
his
pertinacious
assertion
of
*NL*
what
was
evidently
an
untruth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
be
here
again
next
Thursday
,
'
continued
he
,
shunning
her
puzzled
*NL*
gaze
.
`
And
give
him
my
thanks
for
permitting
you
to
come
--
my
best
*NL*
thanks
,
Catherine
.
And
--
and
,
if
you
_
did
_
meet
my
father
,
and
he
asked
*NL*
you
about
me
,
do
n't
lead
him
to
suppose
that
I
've
been
extremely
silent
*NL*
and
stupid
:
do
n't
look
sad
and
downcast
,
as
you
are
doing
--
he
'll
be
*NL*
angry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
care
nothing
for
his
anger
,
'
exclaimed
Cathy
,
imagining
she
would
be
*NL*
its
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
do
,
'
said
her
cousin
,
shuddering
.
'
_
Do
n't
_
provoke
him
against
*NL*
me
,
Catherine
,
for
he
is
very
hard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
severe
to
you
,
Master
Heathcliff
?
'
I
inquired
.
`
Has
he
grown
*NL*
weary
of
indulgence
,
and
passed
from
passive
to
active
hatred
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
looked
at
me
,
but
did
not
answer
;
and
,
after
keeping
her
seat
by
*NL*
his
side
another
ten
minutes
,
during
which
his
head
fell
drowsily
on
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
he
uttered
nothing
except
suppressed
moans
of
exhaustion
or
*NL*
pain
,
Cathy
began
to
seek
solace
in
looking
for
bilberries
,
and
sharing
*NL*
the
produce
of
her
researches
with
me
:
she
did
not
offer
them
to
him
,
for
*NL*
she
saw
further
notice
would
only
weary
and
annoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
half-an-hour
now
,
Ellen
?
'
she
whispered
in
my
ear
,
at
last
.
'
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
why
we
should
stay
.
He
's
asleep
,
and
papa
will
be
wanting
us
*NL*
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
we
must
not
leave
him
asleep
,
'
I
answered
;
`
wait
till
he
wakes
,
*NL*
and
be
patient
.
You
were
mighty
eager
to
set
off
,
but
your
longing
to
*NL*
see
poor
Linton
has
soon
evaporated
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
_
he
_
wish
to
see
me
?
'
returned
Catherine
.
`
In
his
crossest
*NL*
humours
,
formerly
,
I
liked
him
better
than
I
do
in
his
present
curious
*NL*
mood
.
It
's
just
as
if
it
were
a
task
he
was
compelled
to
perform
--
this
*NL*
interview
--
for
fear
his
father
should
scold
him
.
But
I
'm
hardly
going
to
*NL*
come
to
give
Mr.
Heathcliff
pleasure
;
whatever
reason
he
may
have
for
*NL*
ordering
Linton
to
undergo
this
penance
.
And
,
though
I
'm
glad
he
's
*NL*
better
in
health
,
I
'm
sorry
he
's
so
much
less
pleasant
,
and
so
much
less
*NL*
affectionate
to
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
think
_
he
is
_
better
in
health
,
then
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
she
answered
;
`
because
he
always
made
such
a
great
deal
of
his
*NL*
sufferings
,
you
know
.
He
is
not
tolerably
well
,
as
he
told
me
to
tell
*NL*
papa
;
but
he
's
better
,
very
likely
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
you
differ
with
me
,
Miss
Cathy
,
'
I
remarked
;
'
I
should
conjecture
*NL*
him
to
be
far
worse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
here
started
from
his
slumber
in
bewildered
terror
,
and
asked
if
*NL*
any
one
had
called
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
Catherine
;
`
unless
in
dreams
.
I
can
not
conceive
how
you
*NL*
manage
to
doze
out
of
doors
,
in
the
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
I
heard
my
father
,
'
he
gasped
,
glancing
up
to
the
frowning
nab
*NL*
above
us
.
`
You
are
sure
nobody
spoke
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
sure
,
'
replied
his
cousin
.
`
Only
Ellen
and
I
were
disputing
*NL*
concerning
your
health
.
Are
you
truly
stronger
,
Linton
,
than
when
we
*NL*
separated
in
winter
?
If
you
be
,
I
'm
certain
one
thing
is
not
*NL*
stronger
--
your
regard
for
me
:
speak
,
--
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
gushed
from
Linton
's
eyes
as
he
answered
,
`
Yes
,
yes
,
I
am
!
'
*NL*
And
,
still
under
the
spell
of
the
imaginary
voice
,
his
gaze
wandered
up
*NL*
and
down
to
detect
its
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
rose
.
`
For
to-day
we
must
part
,
'
she
said
.
`
And
I
wo
n't
conceal
*NL*
that
I
have
been
sadly
disappointed
with
our
meeting
;
though
I
'll
mention
*NL*
it
to
nobody
but
you
:
not
that
I
stand
in
awe
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush
,
'
murmured
Linton
;
`
for
God
's
sake
,
hush
!
He
's
coming
.
'
And
he
*NL*
clung
to
Catherine
's
arm
,
striving
to
detain
her
;
but
at
that
*NL*
announcement
she
hastily
disengaged
herself
,
and
whistled
to
Minny
,
who
*NL*
obeyed
her
like
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
be
here
next
Thursday
,
'
she
cried
,
springing
to
the
saddle
.
*NL*
`
Good-bye
.
Quick
,
Ellen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
left
him
,
scarcely
conscious
of
our
departure
,
so
absorbed
was
*NL*
he
in
anticipating
his
father
's
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
reached
home
,
Catherine
's
displeasure
softened
into
a
perplexed
*NL*
sensation
of
pity
and
regret
,
largely
blended
with
vague
,
uneasy
doubts
*NL*
about
Linton
's
actual
circumstances
,
physical
and
social
:
in
which
I
*NL*
partook
,
though
I
counselled
her
not
to
say
much
;
for
a
second
journey
*NL*
would
make
us
better
judges
.
My
master
requested
an
account
of
our
*NL*
ongoings
.
His
nephew
's
offering
of
thanks
was
duly
delivered
,
Miss
Cathy
*NL*
gently
touching
on
the
rest
:
I
also
threw
little
light
on
his
inquiries
,
*NL*
for
I
hardly
knew
what
to
hide
and
what
to
reveal
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
days
glided
away
,
every
one
marking
its
course
by
the
henceforth
*NL*
rapid
alteration
of
Edgar
Linton
's
state
.
The
havoc
that
months
had
*NL*
previously
wrought
was
now
emulated
by
the
inroads
of
hours
.
Catherine
*NL*
we
would
fain
have
deluded
yet
;
but
her
own
quick
spirit
refused
to
*NL*
delude
her
:
it
divined
in
secret
,
and
brooded
on
the
dreadful
*NL*
probability
,
gradually
ripening
into
certainty
.
She
had
not
the
heart
to
*NL*
mention
her
ride
,
when
Thursday
came
round
;
I
mentioned
it
for
her
,
and
*NL*
obtained
permission
to
order
her
out
of
doors
:
for
the
library
,
where
her
*NL*
father
stopped
a
short
time
daily
--
the
brief
period
he
could
bear
to
sit
*NL*
up
--
and
his
chamber
,
had
become
her
whole
world
.
She
grudged
each
moment
*NL*
that
did
not
find
her
bending
over
his
pillow
,
or
seated
by
his
side
.
Her
*NL*
countenance
grew
wan
with
watching
and
sorrow
,
and
my
master
gladly
*NL*
dismissed
her
to
what
he
flattered
himself
would
be
a
happy
change
of
*NL*
scene
and
society
;
drawing
comfort
from
the
hope
that
she
would
not
now
*NL*
be
left
entirely
alone
after
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
fixed
idea
,
I
guessed
by
several
observations
he
let
fall
,
that
,
*NL*
as
his
nephew
resembled
him
in
person
,
he
would
resemble
him
in
mind
;
for
*NL*
Linton
's
letters
bore
few
or
no
indications
of
his
defective
character
.
*NL*
And
I
,
through
pardonable
weakness
,
refrained
from
correcting
the
error
;
*NL*
asking
myself
what
good
there
would
be
in
disturbing
his
last
moments
*NL*
with
information
that
he
had
neither
power
nor
opportunity
to
turn
to
*NL*
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
deferred
our
excursion
till
the
afternoon
;
a
golden
afternoon
of
*NL*
August
:
every
breath
from
the
hills
so
full
of
life
,
that
it
seemed
*NL*
whoever
respired
it
,
though
dying
,
might
revive
.
Catherine
's
face
was
*NL*
just
like
the
landscape
--
shadows
and
sunshine
flitting
over
it
in
rapid
*NL*
succession
;
but
the
shadows
rested
longer
,
and
the
sunshine
was
more
*NL*
transient
;
and
her
poor
little
heart
reproached
itself
for
even
that
*NL*
passing
forgetfulness
of
its
cares
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
discerned
Linton
watching
at
the
same
spot
he
had
selected
before
.
My
*NL*
young
mistress
alighted
,
and
told
me
that
,
as
she
was
resolved
to
stay
a
*NL*
very
little
while
,
I
had
better
hold
the
pony
and
remain
on
horseback
;
*NL*
but
I
dissented
:
I
would
n't
risk
losing
sight
of
the
charge
committed
to
*NL*
me
a
minute
;
so
we
climbed
the
slope
of
heath
together
.
Master
*NL*
Heathcliff
received
us
with
greater
animation
on
this
occasion
:
not
the
*NL*
animation
of
high
spirits
though
,
nor
yet
of
joy
;
it
looked
more
like
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
late
!
'
he
said
,
speaking
short
and
with
difficulty
.
`
Is
not
your
*NL*
father
very
ill
?
I
thought
you
would
n't
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
Why
_
wo
n't
you
be
candid
?
'
cried
Catherine
,
swallowing
her
greeting
.
*NL*
`
Why
can
not
you
say
at
once
you
do
n't
want
me
?
It
is
strange
,
Linton
,
*NL*
that
for
the
second
time
you
have
brought
me
here
on
purpose
,
apparently
*NL*
to
distress
us
both
,
and
for
no
reason
besides
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
shivered
,
and
glanced
at
her
,
half
supplicating
,
half
ashamed
;
but
*NL*
his
cousin
's
patience
was
not
sufficient
to
endure
this
enigmatical
*NL*
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
father
_
is
_
very
ill
,
'
she
said
;
`
and
why
am
I
called
from
his
*NL*
bedside
?
Why
did
n't
you
send
to
absolve
me
from
my
promise
,
when
you
*NL*
wished
I
would
n't
keep
it
?
Come
!
I
desire
an
explanation
:
playing
and
*NL*
trifling
are
completely
banished
out
of
my
mind
;
and
I
ca
n't
dance
*NL*
attendance
on
your
affectations
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
affectations
!
'
he
murmured
;
`
what
are
they
?
For
heaven
's
sake
,
*NL*
Catherine
,
do
n't
look
so
angry
!
Despise
me
as
much
as
you
please
;
I
am
a
*NL*
worthless
,
cowardly
wretch
:
I
ca
n't
be
scorned
enough
;
but
I
'm
too
mean
*NL*
for
your
anger
.
Hate
my
father
,
and
spare
me
for
contempt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
!
'
cried
Catherine
in
a
passion
.
`
Foolish
,
silly
boy
!
And
*NL*
there
!
he
trembles
:
as
if
I
were
really
going
to
touch
him
!
You
need
n't
*NL*
bespeak
contempt
,
Linton
:
anybody
will
have
it
spontaneously
at
your
*NL*
service
.
Get
off
!
I
shall
return
home
:
it
is
folly
dragging
you
from
*NL*
the
hearth-stone
,
and
pretending
--
what
do
we
pretend
?
Let
go
my
frock
!
*NL*
If
I
pitied
you
for
crying
and
looking
so
very
frightened
,
you
should
*NL*
spurn
such
pity
.
Ellen
,
tell
him
how
disgraceful
this
conduct
is
.
Rise
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
degrade
yourself
into
an
abject
reptile
--
_
do
n't
_
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
With
streaming
face
and
an
expression
of
agony
,
Linton
had
thrown
his
*NL*
nerveless
frame
along
the
ground
:
he
seemed
convulsed
with
exquisite
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
he
sobbed
,
'
I
can
not
bear
it
!
Catherine
,
Catherine
,
I
'm
a
traitor
,
*NL*
too
,
and
I
dare
not
tell
you
!
But
leave
me
,
and
I
shall
be
killed
!
*NL*
_
Dear
_
Catherine
,
my
life
is
in
your
hands
:
and
you
have
said
you
loved
*NL*
me
,
and
if
you
did
,
it
would
n't
harm
you
.
You
'll
not
go
,
then
?
kind
,
*NL*
sweet
,
good
Catherine
!
And
perhaps
you
_
will
_
consent
--
and
he
'll
let
me
*NL*
die
with
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
young
lady
,
on
witnessing
his
intense
anguish
,
stooped
to
raise
him
.
*NL*
The
old
feeling
of
indulgent
tenderness
overcame
her
vexation
,
and
she
*NL*
grew
thoroughly
moved
and
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Consent
to
what
?
'
she
asked
.
`
To
stay
!
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
*NL*
strange
talk
,
and
I
will
.
You
contradict
your
own
words
,
and
distract
*NL*
me
!
Be
calm
and
frank
,
and
confess
at
once
all
that
weighs
on
your
*NL*
heart
.
You
would
n't
injure
me
,
Linton
,
would
you
?
You
would
n't
let
any
*NL*
enemy
hurt
me
,
if
you
could
prevent
it
?
I
'll
believe
you
are
a
coward
,
*NL*
for
yourself
,
but
not
a
cowardly
betrayer
of
your
best
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
my
father
threatened
me
,
'
gasped
the
boy
,
clasping
his
attenuated
*NL*
fingers
,
`
and
I
dread
him
--
I
dread
him
!
I
_
dare
_
not
tell
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
well
!
'
said
Catherine
,
with
scornful
compassion
,
`
keep
your
secret
:
*NL*
_
I
'm
_
no
coward
.
Save
yourself
:
I
'm
not
afraid
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
magnanimity
provoked
his
tears
:
he
wept
wildly
,
kissing
her
*NL*
supporting
hands
,
and
yet
could
not
summon
courage
to
speak
out
.
I
was
*NL*
cogitating
what
the
mystery
might
be
,
and
determined
Catherine
should
*NL*
never
suffer
to
benefit
him
or
any
one
else
,
by
my
good
will
;
when
,
*NL*
hearing
a
rustle
among
the
ling
,
I
looked
up
and
saw
Mr.
Heathcliff
*NL*
almost
close
upon
us
,
descending
the
Heights
.
He
did
n't
cast
a
glance
*NL*
towards
my
companions
,
though
they
were
sufficiently
near
for
Linton
's
*NL*
sobs
to
be
audible
;
but
hailing
me
in
the
almost
hearty
tone
he
assumed
*NL*
to
none
besides
,
and
the
sincerity
of
which
I
could
n't
avoid
doubting
,
he
*NL*
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
something
to
see
you
so
near
to
my
house
,
Nelly
.
How
are
you
at
*NL*
the
Grange
?
Let
us
hear
.
The
rumour
goes
,
'
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
*NL*
`
that
Edgar
Linton
is
on
his
death-bed
:
perhaps
they
exaggerate
his
*NL*
illness
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
;
my
master
is
dying
,
'
I
replied
:
`
it
is
true
enough
.
A
sad
thing
it
*NL*
will
be
for
us
all
,
but
a
blessing
for
him
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long
will
he
last
,
do
you
think
?
'
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
,
'
he
continued
,
looking
at
the
two
young
people
,
who
were
fixed
*NL*
under
his
eye
--
Linton
appeared
as
if
he
could
not
venture
to
stir
or
*NL*
raise
his
head
,
and
Catherine
could
not
move
,
on
his
account
--
`
because
*NL*
that
lad
yonder
seems
determined
to
beat
me
;
and
I
'd
thank
his
uncle
to
*NL*
be
quick
,
and
go
before
him
!
Hallo
!
has
the
whelp
been
playing
that
game
*NL*
long
?
I
_
did
_
give
him
some
lessons
about
snivelling
.
Is
he
pretty
*NL*
lively
with
Miss
Linton
generally
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Lively
?
no
--
he
has
shown
the
greatest
distress
,
'
I
answered
.
`
To
see
*NL*
him
,
I
should
say
,
that
instead
of
rambling
with
his
sweetheart
on
the
*NL*
hills
,
he
ought
to
be
in
bed
,
under
the
hands
of
a
doctor
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shall
be
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
'
muttered
Heathcliff
.
`
But
first
--
get
up
,
*NL*
Linton
!
Get
up
!
'
he
shouted
.
`
Do
n't
grovel
on
the
ground
there
up
,
this
*NL*
moment
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Linton
had
sunk
prostrate
again
in
another
paroxysm
of
helpless
fear
,
*NL*
caused
by
his
father
's
glance
towards
him
,
I
suppose
:
there
was
nothing
*NL*
else
to
produce
such
humiliation
.
He
made
several
efforts
to
obey
,
but
*NL*
his
little
strength
was
annihilated
for
the
time
,
and
he
fell
back
again
*NL*
with
a
moan
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
advanced
,
and
lifted
him
to
lean
against
a
*NL*
ridge
of
turf
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
he
,
with
curbed
ferocity
,
`
I
'm
getting
angry
and
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
command
that
paltry
spirit
of
yours
--
_
damn
_
you
!
get
up
directly
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
,
father
,
'
he
panted
.
`
Only
,
let
me
alone
,
or
I
shall
faint
.
I
've
*NL*
done
as
you
wished
,
I
'm
sure
.
Catherine
will
tell
you
that
I
--
that
*NL*
I
--
have
been
cheerful
.
Ah
!
keep
by
me
,
Catherine
;
give
me
your
hand
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
mine
,
'
said
his
father
;
`
stand
on
your
feet
.
There
now
--
she
'll
*NL*
lend
you
her
arm
:
that
's
right
,
look
at
her
.
You
would
imagine
I
was
the
*NL*
devil
himself
,
Miss
Linton
,
to
excite
such
horror
.
Be
so
kind
as
to
walk
*NL*
home
with
him
,
will
you
?
He
shudders
if
I
touch
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Linton
dear
!
'
whispered
Catherine
,
'
I
ca
n't
go
to
Wuthering
Heights
:
*NL*
papa
has
forbidden
me
.
He
'll
not
harm
you
:
why
are
you
so
afraid
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
never
re-enter
that
house
,
'
he
answered
.
`
I
'm
_
not
_
to
re-enter
*NL*
it
without
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
!
'
cried
his
father
.
`
We
'll
respect
Catherine
's
filial
scruples
.
*NL*
Nelly
,
take
him
in
,
and
I
'll
follow
your
advice
concerning
the
doctor
,
*NL*
without
delay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'll
do
well
,
'
replied
I.
`
But
I
must
remain
with
my
mistress
:
to
*NL*
mind
your
son
is
not
my
business
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
very
stiff
,
'
said
Heathcliff
,
'
I
know
that
:
but
you
'll
force
me
*NL*
to
pinch
the
baby
and
make
it
scream
before
it
moves
your
charity
.
Come
,
*NL*
then
,
my
hero
.
Are
you
willing
to
return
,
escorted
by
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
once
more
,
and
made
as
if
he
would
seize
the
fragile
being
;
*NL*
but
,
shrinking
back
,
Linton
clung
to
his
cousin
,
and
implored
her
to
*NL*
accompany
him
,
with
a
frantic
importunity
that
admitted
no
denial
.
*NL*
However
I
disapproved
,
I
could
n't
hinder
her
:
indeed
,
how
could
she
have
*NL*
refused
him
herself
?
What
was
filling
him
with
dread
we
had
no
means
of
*NL*
discerning
;
but
there
he
was
,
powerless
under
its
gripe
,
and
any
addition
*NL*
seemed
capable
of
shocking
him
into
idiotcy
.
We
reached
the
threshold
;
*NL*
Catherine
walked
in
,
and
I
stood
waiting
till
she
had
conducted
the
*NL*
invalid
to
a
chair
,
expecting
her
out
immediately
;
when
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
pushing
me
forward
,
exclaimed
--
`
My
house
is
not
stricken
with
the
plague
,
*NL*
Nelly
;
and
I
have
a
mind
to
be
hospitable
to-day
:
sit
down
,
and
allow
me
*NL*
to
shut
the
door
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
and
locked
it
also
.
I
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shall
have
tea
before
you
go
home
,
'
he
added
.
'
I
am
by
myself
.
*NL*
Hareton
is
gone
with
some
cattle
to
the
Lees
,
and
Zillah
and
Joseph
are
*NL*
off
on
a
journey
of
pleasure
;
and
,
though
I
'm
used
to
being
alone
,
I
'd
*NL*
rather
have
some
interesting
company
,
if
I
can
get
it
.
Miss
Linton
,
take
*NL*
your
seat
by
_
him
_
.
I
give
you
what
I
have
:
the
present
is
hardly
worth
*NL*
accepting
;
but
I
have
nothing
else
to
offer
.
It
is
Linton
,
I
mean
.
How
*NL*
she
does
stare
!
It
's
odd
what
a
savage
feeling
I
have
to
anything
that
*NL*
seems
afraid
of
me
!
Had
I
been
born
where
laws
are
less
strict
and
*NL*
tastes
less
dainty
,
I
should
treat
myself
to
a
slow
vivisection
of
those
*NL*
two
,
as
an
evening
's
amusement
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
in
his
breath
,
struck
the
table
,
and
swore
to
himself
,
`
By
hell
!
*NL*
I
hate
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
not
afraid
of
you
!
'
exclaimed
Catherine
,
who
could
not
hear
the
*NL*
latter
part
of
his
speech
.
She
stepped
close
up
;
her
black
eyes
flashing
*NL*
with
passion
and
resolution
.
`
Give
me
that
key
:
I
will
have
it
!
'
she
*NL*
said
.
'
I
would
n't
eat
or
drink
here
,
if
I
were
starving
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
had
the
key
in
his
hand
that
remained
on
the
table
.
He
looked
*NL*
up
,
seized
with
a
sort
of
surprise
at
her
boldness
;
or
,
possibly
,
*NL*
reminded
,
by
her
voice
and
glance
,
of
the
person
from
whom
she
inherited
*NL*
it
.
She
snatched
at
the
instrument
,
and
half
succeeded
in
getting
it
out
*NL*
of
his
loosened
fingers
:
but
her
action
recalled
him
to
the
present
;
he
*NL*
recovered
it
speedily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Catherine
Linton
,
'
he
said
,
`
stand
off
,
or
I
shall
knock
you
down
;
*NL*
and
,
that
will
make
Mrs.
Dean
mad
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Regardless
of
this
warning
,
she
captured
his
closed
hand
and
its
contents
*NL*
again
.
`
We
_
will
_
go
!
'
she
repeated
,
exerting
her
utmost
efforts
to
cause
*NL*
the
iron
muscles
to
relax
;
and
finding
that
her
nails
made
no
impression
,
*NL*
she
applied
her
teeth
pretty
sharply
.
Heathcliff
glanced
at
me
a
glance
*NL*
that
kept
me
from
interfering
a
moment
.
Catherine
was
too
intent
on
his
*NL*
fingers
to
notice
his
face
.
He
opened
them
suddenly
,
and
resigned
the
*NL*
object
of
dispute
;
but
,
ere
she
had
well
secured
it
,
he
seized
her
with
*NL*
the
liberated
hand
,
and
,
pulling
her
on
his
knee
,
administered
with
the
*NL*
other
a
shower
of
terrific
slaps
on
both
sides
of
the
head
,
each
*NL*
sufficient
to
have
fulfilled
his
threat
,
had
she
been
able
to
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
diabolical
violence
I
rushed
on
him
furiously
.
`
You
villain
!
'
I
*NL*
began
to
cry
,
`
you
villain
!
'
A
touch
on
the
chest
silenced
me
:
I
am
*NL*
stout
,
and
soon
put
out
of
breath
;
and
,
what
with
that
and
the
rage
,
I
*NL*
staggered
dizzily
back
and
felt
ready
to
suffocate
,
or
to
burst
a
*NL*
blood-vessel
.
The
scene
was
over
in
two
minutes
;
Catherine
,
released
,
*NL*
put
her
two
hands
to
her
temples
,
and
looked
just
as
if
she
were
not
*NL*
sure
whether
her
ears
were
off
or
on
.
She
trembled
like
a
reed
,
poor
*NL*
thing
,
and
leant
against
the
table
perfectly
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
how
to
chastise
children
,
you
see
,
'
said
the
scoundrel
,
grimly
,
*NL*
as
he
stooped
to
repossess
himself
of
the
key
,
which
had
dropped
to
the
*NL*
floor
.
`
Go
to
Linton
now
,
as
I
told
you
;
and
cry
at
your
ease
!
I
shall
*NL*
be
your
father
,
to-morrow
--
all
the
father
you
'll
have
in
a
few
days
--
and
*NL*
you
shall
have
plenty
of
that
.
You
can
bear
plenty
;
you
're
no
weakling
:
*NL*
you
shall
have
a
daily
taste
,
if
I
catch
such
a
devil
of
a
temper
in
your
*NL*
eyes
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
ran
to
me
instead
of
Linton
,
and
knelt
down
and
put
her
burning
*NL*
cheek
on
my
lap
,
weeping
aloud
.
Her
cousin
had
shrunk
into
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
settle
,
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
,
congratulating
himself
,
I
dare
say
,
that
*NL*
the
correction
had
alighted
on
another
than
him
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
perceiving
us
all
confounded
,
rose
,
and
expeditiously
made
the
tea
*NL*
himself
.
The
cups
and
saucers
were
laid
ready
.
He
poured
it
out
,
and
*NL*
handed
me
a
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wash
away
your
spleen
,
'
he
said
.
`
And
help
your
own
naughty
pet
and
*NL*
mine
.
It
is
not
poisoned
,
though
I
prepared
it
.
I
'm
going
out
to
seek
*NL*
your
horses
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Our
first
thought
,
on
his
departure
,
was
to
force
an
exit
somewhere
.
We
*NL*
tried
the
kitchen
door
,
but
that
was
fastened
outside
:
we
looked
at
the
*NL*
windows
--
they
were
too
narrow
for
even
Cathy
's
little
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Master
Linton
,
'
I
cried
,
seeing
we
were
regularly
imprisoned
,
`
you
know
*NL*
what
your
diabolical
father
is
after
,
and
you
shall
tell
us
,
or
I
'll
box
*NL*
your
ears
,
as
he
has
done
your
cousin
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
Linton
,
you
must
tell
,
'
said
Catherine
.
`
It
was
for
your
sake
I
*NL*
came
;
and
it
will
be
wickedly
ungrateful
if
you
refuse
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Give
me
some
tea
,
I
'm
thirsty
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
,
'
he
answered
.
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Dean
,
go
away
.
I
do
n't
like
you
standing
over
me
.
Now
,
Catherine
,
*NL*
you
are
letting
your
tears
fall
into
my
cup
.
I
wo
n't
drink
that
.
Give
*NL*
me
another
.
'
Catherine
pushed
another
to
him
,
and
wiped
her
face
.
I
*NL*
felt
disgusted
at
the
little
wretch
's
composure
,
since
he
was
no
longer
*NL*
in
terror
for
himself
.
The
anguish
he
had
exhibited
on
the
moor
subsided
*NL*
as
soon
as
ever
he
entered
Wuthering
Heights
;
so
I
guessed
he
had
been
*NL*
menaced
with
an
awful
visitation
of
wrath
if
he
failed
in
decoying
us
*NL*
there
;
and
,
that
accomplished
,
he
had
no
further
immediate
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Papa
wants
us
to
be
married
,
'
he
continued
,
after
sipping
some
of
the
*NL*
liquid
.
`
And
he
knows
your
papa
would
n't
let
us
marry
now
;
and
he
's
*NL*
afraid
of
my
dying
if
we
wait
;
so
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
you
are
to
stay
here
all
night
;
and
,
if
you
do
as
he
wishes
,
you
*NL*
shall
return
home
next
day
,
and
take
me
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
you
with
her
,
pitiful
changeling
!
'
I
exclaimed
.
'
_
You
_
marry
?
Why
,
*NL*
the
man
is
mad
!
or
he
thinks
us
fools
,
every
one
.
And
do
you
imagine
*NL*
that
beautiful
young
lady
,
that
healthy
,
hearty
girl
,
will
tie
herself
to
*NL*
a
little
perishing
monkey
like
you
?
Are
you
cherishing
the
notion
that
*NL*
anybody
,
let
alone
Miss
Catherine
Linton
,
would
have
you
for
a
husband
?
*NL*
You
want
whipping
for
bringing
us
in
here
at
all
,
with
your
dastardly
*NL*
puling
tricks
:
and
--
do
n't
look
so
silly
,
now
!
I
've
a
very
good
mind
to
*NL*
shake
you
severely
,
for
your
contemptible
treachery
,
and
your
imbecile
*NL*
conceit
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
give
him
a
slight
shaking
;
but
it
brought
on
the
cough
,
and
he
took
*NL*
to
his
ordinary
resource
of
moaning
and
weeping
,
and
Catherine
rebuked
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
all
night
?
No
,
'
she
said
,
looking
slowly
round
.
`
Ellen
,
I
'll
burn
*NL*
that
door
down
but
I
'll
get
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
would
have
commenced
the
execution
of
her
threat
directly
,
but
*NL*
Linton
was
up
in
alarm
for
his
dear
self
again
.
He
clasped
her
in
his
*NL*
two
feeble
arms
sobbing
:
--
`
Wo
n't
you
have
me
,
and
save
me
?
not
let
me
*NL*
come
to
the
Grange
?
Oh
,
darling
Catherine
!
you
must
n't
go
and
leave
,
*NL*
after
all
.
You
_
must
_
obey
my
father
--
you
_
must
_
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
obey
my
own
,
'
she
replied
,
`
and
relieve
him
from
this
cruel
*NL*
suspense
.
The
whole
night
!
What
would
he
think
?
He
'll
be
distressed
*NL*
already
.
I
'll
either
break
or
burn
a
way
out
of
the
house
.
Be
quiet
!
*NL*
You
're
in
no
danger
;
but
if
you
hinder
me
--
Linton
,
I
love
papa
better
*NL*
than
you
!
'
The
mortal
terror
he
felt
of
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
anger
restored
*NL*
to
the
boy
his
coward
's
eloquence
.
Catherine
was
near
distraught
:
still
,
*NL*
she
persisted
that
she
must
go
home
,
and
tried
entreaty
in
her
turn
,
*NL*
persuading
him
to
subdue
his
selfish
agony
.
While
they
were
thus
*NL*
occupied
,
our
jailor
re-entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
beasts
have
trotted
off
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
--
now
Linton
!
snivelling
*NL*
again
?
What
has
she
been
doing
to
you
?
Come
,
come
--
have
done
,
and
get
*NL*
to
bed
.
In
a
month
or
two
,
my
lad
,
you
'll
be
able
to
pay
her
back
her
*NL*
present
tyrannies
with
a
vigorous
hand
.
You
're
pining
for
pure
love
,
are
*NL*
you
not
?
nothing
else
in
the
world
:
and
she
shall
have
you
!
There
,
to
*NL*
bed
!
Zillah
wo
n't
be
here
to-night
;
you
must
undress
yourself
.
Hush
!
*NL*
hold
your
noise
!
Once
in
your
own
room
,
I
'll
not
come
near
you
:
you
*NL*
need
n't
fear
.
By
chance
,
you
've
managed
tolerably
.
I
'll
look
to
the
*NL*
rest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
these
words
,
holding
the
door
open
for
his
son
to
pass
,
and
the
*NL*
latter
achieved
his
exit
exactly
as
a
spaniel
might
which
suspected
the
*NL*
person
who
attended
on
it
of
designing
a
spiteful
squeeze
.
The
lock
was
*NL*
re-secured
.
Heathcliff
approached
the
fire
,
where
my
mistress
and
I
*NL*
stood
silent
.
Catherine
looked
up
,
and
instinctively
raised
her
hand
to
*NL*
her
cheek
:
his
neighbourhood
revived
a
painful
sensation
.
Anybody
else
*NL*
would
have
been
incapable
of
regarding
the
childish
act
with
sternness
,
*NL*
but
he
scowled
on
her
and
muttered
--
`
Oh
!
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
?
Your
*NL*
courage
is
well
disguised
:
you
seem
damnably
afraid
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
_
am
_
afraid
now
,
'
she
replied
,
`
because
,
if
I
stay
,
papa
will
be
*NL*
miserable
:
and
how
can
I
endure
making
him
miserable
--
when
he
--
when
*NL*
he
--
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
let
_
me
_
go
home
!
I
promise
to
marry
Linton
:
papa
*NL*
would
like
me
to
:
and
I
love
him
.
Why
should
you
wish
to
force
me
to
do
*NL*
what
I
'll
willingly
do
of
myself
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
him
dare
to
force
you
,
'
I
cried
.
`
There
's
law
in
the
land
,
thank
*NL*
God
!
there
is
;
though
we
be
in
an
out-of-the-way
place
.
I
'd
inform
if
he
*NL*
were
my
own
son
:
and
it
's
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
!
'
said
the
ruffian
.
`
To
the
devil
with
your
clamour
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
_
you
_
to
speak
.
Miss
Linton
,
I
shall
enjoy
myself
remarkably
in
*NL*
thinking
your
father
will
be
miserable
:
I
shall
not
sleep
for
*NL*
satisfaction
.
You
could
have
hit
on
no
surer
way
of
fixing
your
*NL*
residence
under
my
roof
for
the
next
twenty-four
hours
than
informing
me
*NL*
that
such
an
event
would
follow
.
As
to
your
promise
to
marry
Linton
,
*NL*
I
'll
take
care
you
shall
keep
it
;
for
you
shall
not
quit
this
place
till
*NL*
it
is
fulfilled
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Send
Ellen
,
then
,
to
let
papa
know
I
'm
safe
!
'
exclaimed
Catherine
,
*NL*
weeping
bitterly
.
`
Or
marry
me
now
.
Poor
papa
!
Ellen
,
he
'll
think
*NL*
we
're
lost
.
What
shall
we
do
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
he
!
He
'll
think
you
are
tired
of
waiting
on
him
,
and
run
off
for
a
*NL*
little
amusement
,
'
answered
Heathcliff
.
`
You
can
not
deny
that
you
*NL*
entered
my
house
of
your
own
accord
,
in
contempt
of
his
injunctions
to
*NL*
the
contrary
.
And
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
desire
amusement
*NL*
at
your
age
;
and
that
you
would
weary
of
nursing
a
sick
man
,
and
that
man
*NL*
_
only
_
your
father
.
Catherine
,
his
happiest
days
were
over
when
your
*NL*
days
began
.
He
cursed
you
,
I
dare
say
,
for
coming
into
the
world
-LRB-
I
did
,
*NL*
at
least
-RRB-
;
and
it
would
just
do
if
he
cursed
you
as
_
he
_
went
out
of
it
.
*NL*
I
'd
join
him
.
I
do
n't
love
you
!
How
should
I
?
Weep
away
.
As
far
as
I
*NL*
can
see
,
it
will
be
your
chief
diversion
hereafter
;
unless
Linton
make
*NL*
amends
for
other
losses
:
and
your
provident
parent
appears
to
fancy
he
*NL*
may
.
His
letters
of
advice
and
consolation
entertained
me
vastly
.
In
*NL*
his
last
he
recommended
my
jewel
to
be
careful
of
his
;
and
kind
to
her
*NL*
when
he
got
her
.
Careful
and
kind
--
that
's
paternal
.
But
Linton
requires
*NL*
his
whole
stock
of
care
and
kindness
for
himself
.
Linton
can
play
the
*NL*
little
tyrant
well
.
He
'll
undertake
to
torture
any
number
of
cats
,
if
*NL*
their
teeth
be
drawn
and
their
claws
pared
.
You
'll
be
able
to
tell
his
*NL*
uncle
fine
tales
of
his
_
kindness
_
,
when
you
get
home
again
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
right
there
!
'
I
said
;
`
explain
your
son
's
character
.
Show
his
*NL*
resemblance
to
yourself
:
and
then
,
I
hope
,
Miss
Cathy
will
think
twice
*NL*
before
she
takes
the
cockatrice
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
much
mind
speaking
of
his
amiable
qualities
now
,
'
he
answered
;
*NL*
`
because
she
must
either
accept
him
or
remain
a
prisoner
,
and
you
along
*NL*
with
her
,
till
your
master
dies
.
I
can
detain
you
both
,
quite
concealed
,
*NL*
here
.
If
you
doubt
,
encourage
her
to
retract
her
word
,
and
you
'll
have
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
judging
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
not
retract
my
word
,
'
said
Catherine
.
`
I
'll
marry
him
within
this
*NL*
hour
,
if
I
may
go
to
Thrushcross
Grange
afterwards
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
*NL*
you
're
a
cruel
man
,
but
you
're
not
a
fiend
;
and
you
wo
n't
,
from
_
mere
_
*NL*
malice
,
destroy
irrevocably
all
my
happiness
.
If
papa
thought
I
had
left
*NL*
him
on
purpose
,
and
if
he
died
before
I
returned
,
could
I
bear
to
live
?
*NL*
I
've
given
over
crying
:
but
I
'm
going
to
kneel
here
,
at
your
knee
;
and
*NL*
I
'll
not
get
up
,
and
I
'll
not
take
my
eyes
from
your
face
till
you
look
*NL*
back
at
me
!
No
,
do
n't
turn
away
!
_
do
look
_
!
you
'll
see
nothing
to
*NL*
provoke
you
.
I
do
n't
hate
you
.
I
'm
not
angry
that
you
struck
me
.
Have
*NL*
you
never
loved
_
anybody
_
in
all
your
life
,
uncle
?
_
never
_
?
Ah
!
you
must
*NL*
look
once
.
I
'm
so
wretched
,
you
ca
n't
help
being
sorry
and
pitying
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Keep
your
eft
's
fingers
off
;
and
move
,
or
I
'll
kick
you
!
'
cried
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
brutally
repulsing
her
.
`
I
'd
rather
be
hugged
by
a
snake
.
*NL*
How
the
devil
can
you
dream
of
fawning
on
me
?
I
_
detest
_
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
:
shook
himself
,
indeed
,
as
if
his
flesh
crept
*NL*
with
aversion
;
and
thrust
back
his
chair
;
while
I
got
up
,
and
opened
my
*NL*
mouth
,
to
commence
a
downright
torrent
of
abuse
.
But
I
was
rendered
dumb
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
,
by
a
threat
that
I
should
be
shown
*NL*
into
a
room
by
myself
the
very
next
syllable
I
uttered
.
It
was
growing
*NL*
dark
--
we
heard
a
sound
of
voices
at
the
garden-gate
.
Our
host
hurried
*NL*
out
instantly
:
_
he
_
had
his
wits
about
him
;
_
we
_
had
not
.
There
was
a
*NL*
talk
of
two
or
three
minutes
,
and
he
returned
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
it
had
been
your
cousin
Hareton
,
'
I
observed
to
Catherine
.
'
I
*NL*
wish
he
would
arrive
!
Who
knows
but
he
might
take
our
part
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
three
servants
sent
to
seek
you
from
the
Grange
,
'
said
*NL*
Heathcliff
,
overhearing
me
.
`
You
should
have
opened
a
lattice
and
called
*NL*
out
:
but
I
could
swear
that
chit
is
glad
you
did
n't
.
She
's
glad
to
be
*NL*
obliged
to
stay
,
I
'm
certain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
learning
the
chance
we
had
missed
,
we
both
gave
vent
to
our
grief
*NL*
without
control
;
and
he
allowed
us
to
wail
on
till
nine
o'clock
.
Then
he
*NL*
bid
us
go
upstairs
,
through
the
kitchen
,
to
Zillah
's
chamber
;
and
I
*NL*
whispered
my
companion
to
obey
:
perhaps
we
might
contrive
to
get
through
*NL*
the
window
there
,
or
into
a
garret
,
and
out
by
its
skylight
.
The
window
,
*NL*
however
,
was
narrow
,
like
those
below
,
and
the
garret
trap
was
safe
from
*NL*
our
attempts
;
for
we
were
fastened
in
as
before
.
We
neither
of
us
lay
*NL*
down
:
Catherine
took
her
station
by
the
lattice
,
and
watched
anxiously
*NL*
for
morning
;
a
deep
sigh
being
the
only
answer
I
could
obtain
to
my
*NL*
frequent
entreaties
that
she
would
try
to
rest
.
I
seated
myself
in
a
*NL*
chair
,
and
rocked
to
and
fro
,
passing
harsh
judgment
on
my
many
*NL*
derelictions
of
duty
;
from
which
,
it
struck
me
then
,
all
the
misfortunes
*NL*
of
my
employers
sprang
.
It
was
not
the
case
,
in
reality
,
I
am
aware
;
but
*NL*
it
was
,
in
my
imagination
,
that
dismal
night
;
and
I
thought
Heathcliff
*NL*
himself
less
guilty
than
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
he
came
,
and
inquired
if
Miss
Linton
had
risen
.
She
ran
*NL*
to
the
door
immediately
,
and
answered
,
`
Yes
.
'
`
Here
,
then
,
'
he
said
,
*NL*
opening
it
,
and
pulling
her
out
.
I
rose
to
follow
,
but
he
turned
the
*NL*
lock
again
.
I
demanded
my
release
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Be
patient
,
'
he
replied
;
`
I
'll
send
up
your
breakfast
in
a
while
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
thumped
on
the
panels
,
and
rattled
the
latch
angrily
and
Catherine
*NL*
asked
why
I
was
still
shut
up
?
He
answered
,
I
must
try
to
endure
it
*NL*
another
hour
,
and
they
went
away
.
I
endured
it
two
or
three
hours
;
at
*NL*
length
,
I
heard
a
footstep
:
not
Heathcliff
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
brought
you
something
to
eat
,
'
said
a
voice
;
`
oppen
t
'
door
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Complying
eagerly
,
I
beheld
Hareton
,
laden
with
food
enough
to
last
me
*NL*
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tak
'
it
,
'
he
added
,
thrusting
the
tray
into
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stay
one
minute
,
'
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
cried
he
,
and
retired
,
regardless
of
any
prayers
I
could
pour
*NL*
forth
to
detain
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
I
remained
enclosed
the
whole
day
,
and
the
whole
of
the
next
*NL*
night
;
and
another
,
and
another
.
Five
nights
and
four
days
I
remained
,
*NL*
altogether
,
seeing
nobody
but
Hareton
once
every
morning
;
and
he
was
a
*NL*
model
of
a
jailor
:
surly
,
and
dumb
,
and
deaf
to
every
attempt
at
moving
*NL*
his
sense
of
justice
or
compassion
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fifth
morning
,
or
rather
afternoon
,
a
different
step
*NL*
approached
--
lighter
and
shorter
;
and
,
this
time
,
the
person
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
It
was
Zillah
;
donned
in
her
scarlet
shawl
,
with
a
black
silk
*NL*
bonnet
on
her
head
,
and
a
willow-basket
swung
to
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eh
,
dear
!
Mrs.
Dean
!
'
she
exclaimed
.
`
Well
!
there
is
a
talk
about
you
*NL*
at
Gimmerton
.
I
never
thought
but
you
were
sunk
in
the
Blackhorse
marsh
,
*NL*
and
missy
with
you
,
till
master
told
me
you
'd
been
found
,
and
he
'd
lodged
*NL*
you
here
!
What
!
and
you
must
have
got
on
an
island
,
sure
?
And
how
long
*NL*
were
you
in
the
hole
?
Did
master
save
you
,
Mrs.
Dean
?
But
you
're
not
so
*NL*
thin
--
you
've
not
been
so
poorly
,
have
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
master
is
a
true
scoundrel
!
'
I
replied
.
`
But
he
shall
answer
for
*NL*
it
.
He
need
n't
have
raised
that
tale
:
it
shall
all
be
laid
bare
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
mean
?
'
asked
Zillah
.
`
It
's
not
his
tale
:
they
tell
that
in
*NL*
the
village
--
about
your
being
lost
in
the
marsh
;
and
I
calls
to
Earnshaw
,
*NL*
when
I
come
in
--
``
Eh
,
they
's
queer
things
,
Mr.
Hareton
,
happened
since
I
*NL*
went
off
.
It
's
a
sad
pity
of
that
likely
young
lass
,
and
cant
Nelly
*NL*
Dean
.
''
He
stared
.
I
thought
he
had
not
heard
aught
,
so
I
told
him
the
*NL*
rumour
.
The
master
listened
,
and
he
just
smiled
to
himself
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
If
they
have
been
in
the
marsh
,
they
are
out
now
,
Zillah
.
Nelly
Dean
is
*NL*
lodged
,
at
this
minute
,
in
your
room
.
You
can
tell
her
to
flit
,
when
you
*NL*
go
up
;
here
is
the
key
.
The
bog-water
got
into
her
head
,
and
she
would
*NL*
have
run
home
quite
flighty
;
but
I
fixed
her
till
she
came
round
to
her
*NL*
senses
.
You
can
bid
her
go
to
the
Grange
at
once
,
if
she
be
able
,
and
*NL*
carry
a
message
from
me
,
that
her
young
lady
will
follow
in
time
to
*NL*
attend
the
squire
's
funeral
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Edgar
is
not
dead
?
'
I
gasped
.
`
Oh
!
Zillah
,
Zillah
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
;
sit
you
down
,
my
good
mistress
,
'
she
replied
;
`
you
're
right
*NL*
sickly
yet
.
He
's
not
dead
;
Doctor
Kenneth
thinks
he
may
last
another
*NL*
day
.
I
met
him
on
the
road
and
asked
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
sitting
down
,
I
snatched
my
outdoor
things
,
and
hastened
*NL*
below
,
for
the
way
was
free
.
On
entering
the
house
,
I
looked
about
for
*NL*
some
one
to
give
information
of
Catherine
.
The
place
was
filled
with
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
the
door
stood
wide
open
;
but
nobody
seemed
at
hand
.
As
I
*NL*
hesitated
whether
to
go
off
at
once
,
or
return
and
seek
my
mistress
,
a
*NL*
slight
cough
drew
my
attention
to
the
hearth
.
Linton
lay
on
the
settle
,
*NL*
sole
tenant
,
sucking
a
stick
of
sugar-candy
,
and
pursuing
my
movements
*NL*
with
apathetic
eyes
.
`
Where
is
Miss
Catherine
?
'
I
demanded
sternly
,
*NL*
supposing
I
could
frighten
him
into
giving
intelligence
,
by
catching
him
*NL*
thus
,
alone
.
He
sucked
on
like
an
innocent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
she
gone
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
he
replied
;
`
she
's
upstairs
:
she
's
not
to
go
;
we
wo
n't
let
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
let
her
,
little
idiot
!
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
Direct
me
to
her
room
*NL*
immediately
,
or
I
'll
make
you
sing
out
sharply
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Papa
would
make
you
sing
out
,
if
you
attempted
to
get
there
,
'
he
*NL*
answered
.
`
He
says
I
'm
not
to
be
soft
with
Catherine
:
she
's
my
wife
,
and
*NL*
it
's
shameful
that
she
should
wish
to
leave
me
.
He
says
she
hates
me
and
*NL*
wants
me
to
die
,
that
she
may
have
my
money
;
but
she
sha
n't
have
it
:
and
*NL*
she
sha
n't
go
home
!
She
never
shall
!
--
she
may
cry
,
and
be
sick
as
much
*NL*
as
she
pleases
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
his
former
occupation
,
closing
his
lids
,
as
if
he
meant
to
*NL*
drop
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Master
Heathcliff
,
'
I
resumed
,
`
have
you
forgotten
all
Catherine
's
*NL*
kindness
to
you
last
winter
,
when
you
affirmed
you
loved
her
,
and
when
*NL*
she
brought
you
books
and
sung
you
songs
,
and
came
many
a
time
through
*NL*
wind
and
snow
to
see
you
?
She
wept
to
miss
one
evening
,
because
you
*NL*
would
be
disappointed
;
and
you
felt
then
that
she
was
a
hundred
times
too
*NL*
good
to
you
:
and
now
you
believe
the
lies
your
father
tells
,
though
you
*NL*
know
he
detests
you
both
.
And
you
join
him
against
her
.
That
's
fine
*NL*
gratitude
,
is
it
not
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
corner
of
Linton
's
mouth
fell
,
and
he
took
the
sugar-candy
from
his
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
she
come
to
Wuthering
Heights
because
she
hated
you
?
'
I
continued
.
*NL*
`
Think
for
yourself
!
As
to
your
money
,
she
does
not
even
know
that
you
*NL*
will
have
any
.
And
you
say
she
's
sick
;
and
yet
you
leave
her
alone
,
up
*NL*
there
in
a
strange
house
!
You
who
have
felt
what
it
is
to
be
so
*NL*
neglected
!
You
could
pity
your
own
sufferings
;
and
she
pitied
them
,
too
;
*NL*
but
you
wo
n't
pity
hers
!
I
shed
tears
,
Master
Heathcliff
,
you
see
--
an
*NL*
elderly
woman
,
and
a
servant
merely
--
and
you
,
after
pretending
such
*NL*
affection
,
and
having
reason
to
worship
her
almost
,
store
every
tear
you
*NL*
have
for
yourself
,
and
lie
there
quite
at
ease
.
Ah
!
you
're
a
heartless
,
*NL*
selfish
boy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
stay
with
her
,
'
he
answered
crossly
.
`
I
'll
not
stay
by
myself
.
*NL*
She
cries
so
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
And
she
wo
n't
give
over
,
though
I
say
I
'll
*NL*
call
my
father
.
I
did
call
him
once
,
and
he
threatened
to
strangle
her
*NL*
if
she
was
not
quiet
;
but
she
began
again
the
instant
he
left
the
room
,
*NL*
moaning
and
grieving
all
night
long
,
though
I
screamed
for
vexation
that
*NL*
I
could
n't
sleep
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
Mr.
Heathcliff
out
?
'
I
inquired
,
perceiving
that
the
wretched
*NL*
creature
had
no
power
to
sympathize
with
his
cousin
's
mental
tortures
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
in
the
court
,
'
he
replied
,
`
talking
to
Doctor
Kenneth
;
who
says
*NL*
uncle
is
dying
,
truly
,
at
last
.
I
'm
glad
,
for
I
shall
be
master
of
the
*NL*
Grange
after
him
.
Catherine
always
spoke
of
it
as
her
house
.
It
is
n't
*NL*
hers
!
It
's
mine
:
papa
says
everything
she
has
is
mine
.
All
her
nice
*NL*
books
are
mine
;
she
offered
to
give
me
them
,
and
her
pretty
birds
,
and
*NL*
her
pony
Minny
,
if
I
would
get
the
key
of
our
room
,
and
let
her
out
;
but
*NL*
I
told
her
she
had
nothing
to
give
,
they
were
all
,
all
mine
.
And
then
*NL*
she
cried
,
and
took
a
little
picture
from
her
neck
,
and
said
I
should
*NL*
have
that
;
two
pictures
in
a
gold
case
,
on
one
side
her
mother
,
and
on
*NL*
the
other
uncle
,
when
they
were
young
.
That
was
yesterday
--
I
said
they
*NL*
were
mine
,
too
;
and
tried
to
get
them
from
her
.
The
spiteful
thing
*NL*
would
n't
let
me
:
she
pushed
me
off
,
and
hurt
me
.
I
shrieked
out
--
that
*NL*
frightens
her
--
she
heard
papa
coming
,
and
she
broke
the
hinges
and
*NL*
divided
the
case
,
and
gave
me
her
mother
's
portrait
;
the
other
she
*NL*
attempted
to
hide
:
but
papa
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
and
I
explained
*NL*
it
.
He
took
the
one
I
had
away
,
and
ordered
her
to
resign
hers
to
me
;
*NL*
she
refused
,
and
he
--
he
struck
her
down
,
and
wrenched
it
off
the
chain
,
*NL*
and
crushed
it
with
his
foot
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
were
you
pleased
to
see
her
struck
?
'
I
asked
:
having
my
designs
in
*NL*
encouraging
his
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
winked
,
'
he
answered
:
'
I
wink
to
see
my
father
strike
a
dog
or
a
*NL*
horse
,
he
does
it
so
hard
.
Yet
I
was
glad
at
first
--
she
deserved
*NL*
punishing
for
pushing
me
:
but
when
papa
was
gone
,
she
made
me
come
to
the
*NL*
window
and
showed
me
her
cheek
cut
on
the
inside
,
against
her
teeth
,
and
*NL*
her
mouth
filling
with
blood
;
and
then
she
gathered
up
the
bits
of
the
*NL*
picture
,
and
went
and
sat
down
with
her
face
to
the
wall
,
and
she
has
*NL*
never
spoken
to
me
since
:
and
I
sometimes
think
she
ca
n't
speak
for
pain
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
like
to
think
so
;
but
she
's
a
naughty
thing
for
crying
*NL*
continually
;
and
she
looks
so
pale
and
wild
,
I
'm
afraid
of
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
can
get
the
key
if
you
choose
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
when
I
am
up-stairs
,
'
he
answered
;
`
but
I
ca
n't
walk
up-stairs
*NL*
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
what
apartment
is
it
?
'
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
'
he
cried
,
'
I
sha
n't
tell
_
you
_
where
it
is
.
It
is
our
secret
.
*NL*
Nobody
,
neither
Hareton
nor
Zillah
,
is
to
know
.
There
!
you
've
tired
*NL*
me
--
go
away
,
go
away
!
'
And
he
turned
his
face
on
to
his
arm
,
and
shut
*NL*
his
eyes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
considered
it
best
to
depart
without
seeing
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
bring
a
*NL*
rescue
for
my
young
lady
from
the
Grange
.
On
reaching
it
,
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
my
fellow-servants
to
see
me
,
and
their
joy
also
,
was
*NL*
intense
;
and
when
they
heard
that
their
little
mistress
was
safe
,
two
or
*NL*
three
were
about
to
hurry
up
and
shout
the
news
at
Mr.
Edgar
's
door
:
but
*NL*
I
bespoke
the
announcement
of
it
myself
.
How
changed
I
found
him
,
even
*NL*
in
those
few
days
!
He
lay
an
image
of
sadness
and
resignation
awaiting
*NL*
his
death
.
Very
young
he
looked
:
though
his
actual
age
was
thirty-nine
,
*NL*
one
would
have
called
him
ten
years
younger
,
at
least
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
Catherine
;
for
he
murmured
her
name
.
I
touched
his
hand
,
and
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Catherine
is
coming
,
dear
master
!
'
I
whispered
;
`
she
is
alive
and
well
;
*NL*
and
will
be
here
,
I
hope
,
to-night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
trembled
at
the
first
effects
of
this
intelligence
:
he
half
rose
up
,
*NL*
looked
eagerly
round
the
apartment
,
and
then
sank
back
in
a
swoon
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
recovered
,
I
related
our
compulsory
visit
,
and
detention
at
*NL*
the
Heights
.
I
said
Heathcliff
forced
me
to
go
in
:
which
was
not
quite
*NL*
true
.
I
uttered
as
little
as
possible
against
Linton
;
nor
did
I
describe
*NL*
all
his
father
's
brutal
conduct
--
my
intentions
being
to
add
no
*NL*
bitterness
,
if
I
could
help
it
,
to
his
already
over-flowing
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
divined
that
one
of
his
enemy
's
purposes
was
to
secure
the
personal
*NL*
property
,
as
well
as
the
estate
,
to
his
son
:
or
rather
himself
;
yet
why
*NL*
he
did
not
wait
till
his
decease
was
a
puzzle
to
my
master
,
because
*NL*
ignorant
how
nearly
he
and
his
nephew
would
quit
the
world
together
.
*NL*
However
,
he
felt
that
his
will
had
better
be
altered
:
instead
of
leaving
*NL*
Catherine
's
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
,
he
determined
to
put
it
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
trustees
for
her
use
during
life
,
and
for
her
children
,
if
she
*NL*
had
any
,
after
her
.
By
that
means
,
it
could
not
fall
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
*NL*
should
Linton
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
received
his
orders
,
I
despatched
a
man
to
fetch
the
attorney
,
and
*NL*
four
more
,
provided
with
serviceable
weapons
,
to
demand
my
young
lady
of
*NL*
her
jailor
.
Both
parties
were
delayed
very
late
.
The
single
servant
*NL*
returned
first
.
He
said
Mr.
Green
,
the
lawyer
,
was
out
when
he
arrived
*NL*
at
his
house
,
and
he
had
to
wait
two
hours
for
his
re-entrance
;
and
then
*NL*
Mr.
Green
told
him
he
had
a
little
business
in
the
village
that
must
be
*NL*
done
;
but
he
would
be
at
Thrushcross
Grange
before
morning
.
The
four
men
*NL*
came
back
unaccompanied
also
.
They
brought
word
that
Catherine
was
ill
:
*NL*
too
ill
to
quit
her
room
;
and
Heathcliff
would
not
suffer
them
to
see
*NL*
her
.
I
scolded
the
stupid
fellows
well
for
listening
to
that
tale
,
which
*NL*
I
would
not
carry
to
my
master
;
resolving
to
take
a
whole
bevy
up
to
the
*NL*
Heights
,
at
day-light
,
and
storm
it
literally
,
unless
the
prisoner
were
*NL*
quietly
surrendered
to
us
.
Her
father
_
shall
_
see
her
,
I
vowed
,
and
*NL*
vowed
again
,
if
that
devil
be
killed
on
his
own
doorstones
in
trying
to
*NL*
prevent
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
,
I
was
spared
the
journey
and
the
trouble
.
I
had
gone
*NL*
down-stairs
at
three
o'clock
to
fetch
a
jug
of
water
;
and
was
passing
*NL*
through
the
hall
with
it
in
my
hand
,
when
a
sharp
knock
at
the
front
door
*NL*
made
me
jump
.
`
Oh
!
it
is
Green
,
'
I
said
,
recollecting
myself
--
`
only
*NL*
Green
,
'
and
I
went
on
,
intending
to
send
somebody
else
to
open
it
;
but
*NL*
the
knock
was
repeated
:
not
loud
,
and
still
importunately
.
I
put
the
jug
*NL*
on
the
banister
and
hastened
to
admit
him
myself
.
The
harvest
moon
shone
*NL*
clear
outside
.
It
was
not
the
attorney
.
My
own
sweet
little
mistress
*NL*
sprang
on
my
neck
sobbing
,
`
Ellen
,
Ellen
!
Is
papa
alive
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
I
cried
:
`
yes
,
my
angel
,
he
is
,
God
be
thanked
,
you
are
safe
with
*NL*
us
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
run
,
breathless
as
she
was
,
up-stairs
to
Mr.
Linton
's
room
;
*NL*
but
I
compelled
her
to
sit
down
on
a
chair
,
and
made
her
drink
,
and
*NL*
washed
her
pale
face
,
chafing
it
into
a
faint
colour
with
my
apron
.
Then
*NL*
I
said
I
must
go
first
,
and
tell
of
her
arrival
;
imploring
her
to
say
,
*NL*
she
should
be
happy
with
young
Heathcliff
.
She
stared
,
but
soon
*NL*
comprehending
why
I
counselled
her
to
utter
the
falsehood
,
she
assured
me
*NL*
she
would
not
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
abide
to
be
present
at
their
meeting
.
I
stood
outside
the
*NL*
chamber-door
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
hardly
ventured
near
the
bed
,
*NL*
then
.
All
was
composed
,
however
:
Catherine
's
despair
was
as
silent
as
*NL*
her
father
's
joy
.
She
supported
him
calmly
,
in
appearance
;
and
he
fixed
*NL*
on
her
features
his
raised
eyes
that
seemed
dilating
with
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
died
blissfully
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
he
died
so
.
Kissing
her
cheek
,
he
*NL*
murmured
,
--
'
I
am
going
to
her
;
and
you
,
darling
child
,
shall
come
to
us
!
'
*NL*
and
never
stirred
or
spoke
again
;
but
continued
that
rapt
,
radiant
gaze
,
*NL*
till
his
pulse
imperceptibly
stopped
and
his
soul
departed
.
None
could
*NL*
have
noticed
the
exact
minute
of
his
death
,
it
was
so
entirely
without
a
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Catherine
had
spent
her
tears
,
or
whether
the
grief
were
too
*NL*
weighty
to
let
them
flow
,
she
sat
there
dry-eyed
till
the
sun
rose
:
she
*NL*
sat
till
noon
,
and
would
still
have
remained
brooding
over
that
deathbed
,
*NL*
but
I
insisted
on
her
coming
away
and
taking
some
repose
.
It
was
well
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
removing
her
,
for
at
dinner-time
appeared
the
lawyer
,
having
*NL*
called
at
Wuthering
Heights
to
get
his
instructions
how
to
behave
.
He
*NL*
had
sold
himself
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
that
was
the
cause
of
his
delay
in
*NL*
obeying
my
master
's
summons
.
Fortunately
,
no
thought
of
worldly
affairs
*NL*
crossed
the
latter
's
mind
,
to
disturb
him
,
after
his
daughter
's
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Green
took
upon
himself
to
order
everything
and
everybody
about
the
*NL*
place
.
He
gave
all
the
servants
but
me
,
notice
to
quit
.
He
would
have
*NL*
carried
his
delegated
authority
to
the
point
of
insisting
that
Edgar
*NL*
Linton
should
not
be
buried
beside
his
wife
,
but
in
the
chapel
,
with
his
*NL*
family
.
There
was
the
will
,
however
,
to
hinder
that
,
and
my
loud
*NL*
protestations
against
any
infringement
of
its
directions
.
The
funeral
*NL*
was
hurried
over
;
Catherine
,
Mrs.
Linton
Heathcliff
now
,
was
suffered
to
*NL*
stay
at
the
Grange
till
her
father
's
corpse
had
quitted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
me
that
her
anguish
had
at
last
spurred
Linton
to
incur
the
risk
*NL*
of
liberating
her
.
She
heard
the
men
I
sent
disputing
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
she
gathered
the
sense
of
Heathcliff
's
answer
.
It
drove
her
desperate
.
*NL*
Linton
who
had
been
conveyed
up
to
the
little
parlour
soon
after
I
left
,
*NL*
was
terrified
into
fetching
the
key
before
his
father
re-ascended
.
He
*NL*
had
the
cunning
to
unlock
and
re-lock
the
door
,
without
shutting
it
;
and
*NL*
when
he
should
have
gone
to
bed
,
he
begged
to
sleep
with
Hareton
,
and
his
*NL*
petition
was
granted
for
once
.
Catherine
stole
out
before
break
of
day
.
*NL*
She
dared
not
try
the
doors
lest
the
dogs
should
raise
an
alarm
;
she
*NL*
visited
the
empty
chambers
and
examined
their
windows
;
and
,
luckily
,
*NL*
lighting
on
her
mother
's
,
she
got
easily
out
of
its
lattice
,
and
on
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
by
means
of
the
fir-tree
close
by
.
Her
accomplice
suffered
*NL*
for
his
share
in
the
escape
,
notwithstanding
his
timid
contrivances
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
after
the
funeral
,
my
young
lady
and
I
were
seated
in
the
*NL*
library
;
now
musing
mournfully
--
one
of
us
despairingly
--
on
our
loss
,
now
*NL*
venturing
conjectures
as
to
the
gloomy
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
just
agreed
the
best
destiny
which
could
await
Catherine
would
be
*NL*
a
permission
to
continue
resident
at
the
Grange
;
at
least
during
Linton
's
*NL*
life
:
he
being
allowed
to
join
her
there
,
and
I
to
remain
as
housekeeper
.
*NL*
That
seemed
rather
too
favourable
an
arrangement
to
be
hoped
for
;
and
yet
*NL*
I
did
hope
,
and
began
to
cheer
up
under
the
prospect
of
retaining
my
home
*NL*
and
my
employment
,
and
,
above
all
,
my
beloved
young
mistress
;
when
a
*NL*
servant
--
one
of
the
discarded
ones
,
not
yet
departed
--
rushed
hastily
in
,
*NL*
and
said
`
that
devil
Heathcliff
'
was
coming
through
the
court
:
should
he
*NL*
fasten
the
door
in
his
face
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
been
mad
enough
to
order
that
proceeding
,
we
had
not
time
.
He
*NL*
made
no
ceremony
of
knocking
or
announcing
his
name
:
he
was
master
,
and
*NL*
availed
himself
of
the
master
's
privilege
to
walk
straight
in
,
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
.
The
sound
of
our
informant
's
voice
directed
him
to
the
*NL*
library
;
he
entered
and
motioning
him
out
,
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
room
into
which
he
had
been
ushered
,
as
a
guest
,
eighteen
*NL*
years
before
:
the
same
moon
shone
through
the
window
;
and
the
same
autumn
*NL*
landscape
lay
outside
.
We
had
not
yet
lighted
a
candle
,
but
all
the
*NL*
apartment
was
visible
,
even
to
the
portraits
on
the
wall
:
the
splendid
*NL*
head
of
Mrs.
Linton
,
and
the
graceful
one
of
her
husband
.
Heathcliff
*NL*
advanced
to
the
hearth
.
Time
had
little
altered
his
person
either
.
There
*NL*
was
the
same
man
:
his
dark
face
rather
sallower
and
more
composed
,
his
*NL*
frame
a
stone
or
two
heavier
,
perhaps
,
and
no
other
difference
.
Catherine
*NL*
had
risen
with
an
impulse
to
dash
out
,
when
she
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
!
'
he
said
,
arresting
her
by
the
arm
.
`
No
more
runnings
away
!
Where
*NL*
would
you
go
?
I
'm
come
to
fetch
you
home
;
and
I
hope
you
'll
be
a
dutiful
*NL*
daughter
and
not
encourage
my
son
to
further
disobedience
.
I
was
*NL*
embarrassed
how
to
punish
him
when
I
discovered
his
part
in
the
business
:
*NL*
he
's
such
a
cobweb
,
a
pinch
would
annihilate
him
;
but
you
'll
see
by
his
*NL*
look
that
he
has
received
his
due
!
I
brought
him
down
one
evening
,
the
*NL*
day
before
yesterday
,
and
just
set
him
in
a
chair
,
and
never
touched
him
*NL*
afterwards
.
I
sent
Hareton
out
,
and
we
had
the
room
to
ourselves
.
In
*NL*
two
hours
,
I
called
Joseph
to
carry
him
up
again
;
and
since
then
my
*NL*
presence
is
as
potent
on
his
nerves
as
a
ghost
;
and
I
fancy
he
sees
me
*NL*
often
,
though
I
am
not
near
.
Hareton
says
he
wakes
and
shrieks
in
the
*NL*
night
by
the
hour
together
,
and
calls
you
to
protect
him
from
me
;
and
,
*NL*
whether
you
like
your
precious
mate
,
or
not
,
you
must
come
:
he
's
your
*NL*
concern
now
;
I
yield
all
my
interest
in
him
to
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
let
Catherine
continue
here
,
'
I
pleaded
,
`
and
send
Master
Linton
*NL*
to
her
?
As
you
hate
them
both
,
you
'd
not
miss
them
:
they
can
only
be
a
*NL*
daily
plague
to
your
unnatural
heart
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
seeking
a
tenant
for
the
Grange
,
'
he
answered
;
`
and
I
want
my
*NL*
children
about
me
,
to
be
sure
.
Besides
,
that
lass
owes
me
her
services
*NL*
for
her
bread
.
I
'm
not
going
to
nurture
her
in
luxury
and
idleness
after
*NL*
Linton
is
gone
.
Make
haste
and
get
ready
,
now
;
and
do
n't
oblige
me
to
*NL*
compel
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
,
'
said
Catherine
.
`
Linton
is
all
I
have
to
love
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
though
you
have
done
what
you
could
to
make
him
hateful
to
me
,
and
me
*NL*
to
him
,
you
can
not
make
us
hate
each
other
.
And
I
defy
you
to
hurt
him
*NL*
when
I
am
by
,
and
I
defy
you
to
frighten
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
a
boastful
champion
,
'
replied
Heathcliff
;
`
but
I
do
n't
like
you
*NL*
well
enough
to
hurt
him
:
you
shall
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
torment
,
*NL*
as
long
as
it
lasts
.
It
is
not
I
who
will
make
him
hateful
to
you
--
it
is
*NL*
his
own
sweet
spirit
.
He
's
as
bitter
as
gall
at
your
desertion
and
its
*NL*
consequences
:
do
n't
expect
thanks
for
this
noble
devotion
.
I
heard
him
*NL*
draw
a
pleasant
picture
to
Zillah
of
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
as
*NL*
strong
as
I
:
the
inclination
is
there
,
and
his
very
weakness
will
sharpen
*NL*
his
wits
to
find
a
substitute
for
strength
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
he
has
a
bad
nature
,
'
said
Catherine
:
`
he
's
your
son
.
But
I
'm
*NL*
glad
I
've
a
better
,
to
forgive
it
;
and
I
know
he
loves
me
,
and
for
that
*NL*
reason
I
love
him
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
_
you
_
have
_
nobody
_
to
love
you
;
and
,
*NL*
however
miserable
you
make
us
,
we
shall
still
have
the
revenge
of
*NL*
thinking
that
your
cruelty
arises
from
your
greater
misery
.
You
_
are
_
*NL*
miserable
,
are
you
not
?
Lonely
,
like
the
devil
,
and
envious
like
him
?
*NL*
_
Nobody
_
loves
you
--
_
nobody
_
will
cry
for
you
when
you
die
!
I
would
n't
*NL*
be
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
spoke
with
a
kind
of
dreary
triumph
:
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
her
future
family
,
and
draw
pleasure
*NL*
from
the
griefs
of
her
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
shall
be
sorry
to
be
yourself
presently
,
'
said
her
father-in-law
,
*NL*
`
if
you
stand
there
another
minute
.
Begone
,
witch
,
and
get
your
things
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
scornfully
withdrew
.
In
her
absence
I
began
to
beg
for
Zillah
's
*NL*
place
at
the
Heights
,
offering
to
resign
mine
to
her
;
but
he
would
suffer
*NL*
it
on
no
account
.
He
bid
me
be
silent
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
allowed
himself
a
glance
round
the
room
and
a
look
at
the
pictures
.
*NL*
Having
studied
Mrs.
Linton
's
,
he
said
--
'
I
shall
have
that
home
.
Not
*NL*
because
I
need
it
,
but
--
'
He
turned
abruptly
to
the
fire
,
and
continued
,
*NL*
with
what
,
for
lack
of
a
better
word
,
I
must
call
a
smile
--
`
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
what
I
did
yesterday
!
I
got
the
sexton
,
who
was
digging
Linton
's
grave
,
*NL*
to
remove
the
earth
off
her
coffin
lid
,
and
I
opened
it
.
I
thought
,
*NL*
once
,
I
would
have
stayed
there
:
when
I
saw
her
face
again
--
it
is
hers
*NL*
yet
!
--
he
had
hard
work
to
stir
me
;
but
he
said
it
would
change
if
the
air
*NL*
blew
on
it
,
and
so
I
struck
one
side
of
the
coffin
loose
,
and
covered
it
*NL*
up
:
not
Linton
's
side
,
damn
him
!
I
wish
he
'd
been
soldered
in
lead
.
And
*NL*
I
bribed
the
sexton
to
pull
it
away
when
I
'm
laid
there
,
and
slide
mine
*NL*
out
too
;
I
'll
have
it
made
so
:
and
then
by
the
time
Linton
gets
to
us
*NL*
he
'll
not
know
which
is
which
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
were
very
wicked
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
'
I
exclaimed
;
`
were
you
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
disturb
the
dead
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
disturbed
nobody
,
Nelly
,
'
he
replied
;
`
and
I
gave
some
ease
to
myself
.
*NL*
I
shall
be
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
now
;
and
you
'll
have
a
better
*NL*
chance
of
keeping
me
underground
,
when
I
get
there
.
Disturbed
her
?
No
!
*NL*
she
has
disturbed
me
,
night
and
day
,
through
eighteen
*NL*
years
--
incessantly
--
remorselessly
--
till
yesternight
;
and
yesternight
I
*NL*
was
tranquil
.
I
dreamt
I
was
sleeping
the
last
sleep
by
that
sleeper
,
*NL*
with
my
heart
stopped
and
my
cheek
frozen
against
hers
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
if
she
had
been
dissolved
into
earth
,
or
worse
,
what
would
you
have
*NL*
dreamt
of
then
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
dissolving
with
her
,
and
being
more
happy
still
!
'
he
answered
.
`
Do
*NL*
you
suppose
I
dread
any
change
of
that
sort
?
I
expected
such
a
*NL*
transformation
on
raising
the
lid
--
but
I
'm
better
pleased
that
it
should
*NL*
not
commence
till
I
share
it
.
Besides
,
unless
I
had
received
a
distinct
*NL*
impression
of
her
passionless
features
,
that
strange
feeling
would
hardly
*NL*
have
been
removed
.
It
began
oddly
.
You
know
I
was
wild
after
she
died
;
*NL*
and
eternally
,
from
dawn
to
dawn
,
praying
her
to
return
to
me
her
spirit
!
*NL*
I
have
a
strong
faith
in
ghosts
:
I
have
a
conviction
that
they
can
,
and
*NL*
do
,
exist
among
us
!
The
day
she
was
buried
,
there
came
a
fall
of
snow
.
*NL*
In
the
evening
I
went
to
the
churchyard
.
It
blew
bleak
as
winter
--
all
*NL*
round
was
solitary
.
I
did
n't
fear
that
her
fool
of
a
husband
would
*NL*
wander
up
the
glen
so
late
;
and
no
one
else
had
business
to
bring
them
*NL*
there
.
Being
alone
,
and
conscious
two
yards
of
loose
earth
was
the
sole
*NL*
barrier
between
us
,
I
said
to
myself
--
``
I
'll
have
her
in
my
arms
again
!
If
*NL*
she
be
cold
,
I
'll
think
it
is
this
north
wind
that
chills
_
me
_
;
and
if
*NL*
she
be
motionless
,
it
is
sleep
.
''
I
got
a
spade
from
the
tool-house
,
and
*NL*
began
to
delve
with
all
my
might
--
it
scraped
the
coffin
;
I
fell
to
work
*NL*
with
my
hands
;
the
wood
commenced
cracking
about
the
screws
;
I
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
attaining
my
object
,
when
it
seemed
that
I
heard
a
sigh
from
*NL*
some
one
above
,
close
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
,
and
bending
down
.
``
If
I
*NL*
can
only
get
this
off
,
''
I
muttered
,
``
I
wish
they
may
shovel
in
the
earth
*NL*
over
us
both
!
''
and
I
wrenched
at
it
more
desperately
still
.
There
was
*NL*
another
sigh
,
close
at
my
ear
.
I
appeared
to
feel
the
warm
breath
of
it
*NL*
displacing
the
sleet-laden
wind
.
I
knew
no
living
thing
in
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
was
by
;
but
,
as
certainly
as
you
perceive
the
approach
to
some
*NL*
substantial
body
in
the
dark
,
though
it
can
not
be
discerned
,
so
certainly
*NL*
I
felt
that
Cathy
was
there
:
not
under
me
,
but
on
the
earth
.
A
sudden
*NL*
sense
of
relief
flowed
from
my
heart
through
every
limb
.
I
relinquished
*NL*
my
labour
of
agony
,
and
turned
consoled
at
once
:
unspeakably
consoled
.
*NL*
Her
presence
was
with
me
:
it
remained
while
I
re-filled
the
grave
,
and
*NL*
led
me
home
.
You
may
laugh
,
if
you
will
;
but
I
was
sure
I
should
see
her
*NL*
there
.
I
was
sure
she
was
with
me
,
and
I
could
not
help
talking
to
her
.
*NL*
Having
reached
the
Heights
,
I
rushed
eagerly
to
the
door
.
It
was
*NL*
fastened
;
and
,
I
remember
,
that
accursed
Earnshaw
and
my
wife
opposed
my
*NL*
entrance
.
I
remember
stopping
to
kick
the
breath
out
of
him
,
and
then
*NL*
hurrying
up-stairs
,
to
my
room
and
hers
.
I
looked
round
impatiently
--
I
*NL*
felt
her
by
me
--
I
could
_
almost
_
see
her
,
and
yet
I
_
could
not
_
!
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
sweat
blood
then
,
from
the
anguish
of
my
yearning
--
from
the
*NL*
fervour
of
my
supplications
to
have
but
one
glimpse
!
I
had
not
one
.
She
*NL*
showed
herself
,
as
she
often
was
in
life
,
a
devil
to
me
!
And
,
since
*NL*
then
,
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
,
I
've
been
the
sport
of
that
*NL*
intolerable
torture
!
Infernal
!
keeping
my
nerves
at
such
a
stretch
that
,
*NL*
if
they
had
not
resembled
catgut
,
they
would
long
ago
have
relaxed
to
the
*NL*
feebleness
of
Linton
's
.
When
I
sat
in
the
house
with
Hareton
,
it
seemed
*NL*
that
on
going
out
I
should
meet
her
;
when
I
walked
on
the
moors
I
should
*NL*
meet
her
coming
in
.
When
I
went
from
home
I
hastened
to
return
;
she
*NL*
_
must
_
be
somewhere
at
the
Heights
,
I
was
certain
!
And
when
I
slept
in
*NL*
her
chamber
--
I
was
beaten
out
of
that
.
I
could
n't
lie
there
;
for
the
*NL*
moment
I
closed
my
eyes
,
she
was
either
outside
the
window
,
or
sliding
*NL*
back
the
panels
,
or
entering
the
room
,
or
even
resting
her
darling
head
*NL*
on
the
same
pillow
as
she
did
when
a
child
;
and
I
must
open
my
lids
to
*NL*
see
.
And
so
I
opened
and
closed
them
a
hundred
times
a
night
--
to
be
*NL*
always
disappointed
!
It
racked
me
!
I
've
often
groaned
aloud
,
till
that
*NL*
old
rascal
Joseph
no
doubt
believed
that
my
conscience
was
playing
the
*NL*
fiend
inside
of
me
.
Now
,
since
I
've
seen
her
,
I
'm
pacified
--
a
little
.
It
*NL*
was
a
strange
way
of
killing
:
not
by
inches
,
but
by
fractions
of
*NL*
hairbreadths
,
to
beguile
me
with
the
spectre
of
a
hope
through
eighteen
*NL*
years
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
paused
and
wiped
his
forehead
;
his
hair
clung
to
it
,
wet
*NL*
with
perspiration
;
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
,
the
*NL*
brows
not
contracted
,
but
raised
next
the
temples
;
diminishing
the
grim
*NL*
aspect
of
his
countenance
,
but
imparting
a
peculiar
look
of
trouble
,
and
*NL*
a
painful
appearance
of
mental
tension
towards
one
absorbing
subject
.
He
*NL*
only
half
addressed
me
,
and
I
maintained
silence
.
I
did
n't
like
to
hear
*NL*
him
talk
!
After
a
short
period
he
resumed
his
meditation
on
the
picture
,
*NL*
took
it
down
and
leant
it
against
the
sofa
to
contemplate
it
at
better
*NL*
advantage
;
and
while
so
occupied
Catherine
entered
,
announcing
that
she
*NL*
was
ready
,
when
her
pony
should
be
saddled
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Send
that
over
to-morrow
,
'
said
Heathcliff
to
me
;
then
turning
to
her
,
*NL*
he
added
:
`
You
may
do
without
your
pony
:
it
is
a
fine
evening
,
and
you
'll
*NL*
need
no
ponies
at
Wuthering
Heights
;
for
what
journeys
you
take
,
your
own
*NL*
feet
will
serve
you
.
Come
along
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Good-bye
,
Ellen
!
'
whispered
my
dear
little
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
kissed
me
,
her
lips
felt
like
ice
.
`
Come
and
see
me
,
Ellen
;
do
n't
*NL*
forget
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
care
you
do
no
such
thing
,
Mrs.
Dean
!
'
said
her
new
father
.
`
When
*NL*
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
I
'll
come
here
.
I
want
none
of
your
prying
at
my
*NL*
house
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
signed
her
to
precede
him
;
and
casting
back
a
look
that
cut
my
heart
,
*NL*
she
obeyed
.
I
watched
them
,
from
the
window
,
walk
down
the
garden
.
*NL*
Heathcliff
fixed
Catherine
's
arm
under
his
:
though
she
disputed
the
act
*NL*
at
first
evidently
;
and
with
rapid
strides
he
hurried
her
into
the
alley
,
*NL*
whose
trees
concealed
them
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
paid
a
visit
to
the
Heights
,
but
I
have
not
seen
her
since
she
*NL*
left
:
Joseph
held
the
door
in
his
hand
when
I
called
to
ask
after
her
,
*NL*
and
would
n't
let
me
pass
.
He
said
Mrs.
Linton
was
`
thrang
,
'
and
the
*NL*
master
was
not
in
.
Zillah
has
told
me
something
of
the
way
they
go
on
,
*NL*
otherwise
I
should
hardly
know
who
was
dead
and
who
living
.
She
thinks
*NL*
Catherine
haughty
,
and
does
not
like
her
,
I
can
guess
by
her
talk
.
My
*NL*
young
lady
asked
some
aid
of
her
when
she
first
came
;
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
*NL*
told
her
to
follow
her
own
business
,
and
let
his
daughter-in-law
look
*NL*
after
herself
;
and
Zillah
willingly
acquiesced
,
being
a
narrow-minded
,
*NL*
selfish
woman
.
Catherine
evinced
a
child
's
annoyance
at
this
neglect
;
*NL*
repaid
it
with
contempt
,
and
thus
enlisted
my
informant
among
her
*NL*
enemies
,
as
securely
as
if
she
had
done
her
some
great
wrong
.
I
had
a
*NL*
long
talk
with
Zillah
about
six
weeks
ago
,
a
little
before
you
came
,
one
*NL*
day
when
we
foregathered
on
the
moor
;
and
this
is
what
she
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
first
thing
Mrs.
Linton
did
,
'
she
said
,
`
on
her
arrival
at
the
*NL*
Heights
,
was
to
run
up-stairs
,
without
even
wishing
good-evening
to
me
*NL*
and
Joseph
;
she
shut
herself
into
Linton
's
room
,
and
remained
till
*NL*
morning
.
Then
,
while
the
master
and
Earnshaw
were
at
breakfast
,
she
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
and
asked
all
in
a
quiver
if
the
doctor
might
be
sent
*NL*
for
?
her
cousin
was
very
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
We
know
that
!
''
answered
Heathcliff
;
``
but
his
life
is
not
worth
a
*NL*
farthing
,
and
I
wo
n't
spend
a
farthing
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
But
I
can
not
tell
how
to
do
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
if
nobody
will
help
me
,
*NL*
he
'll
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Walk
out
of
the
room
,
''
cried
the
master
,
``
and
let
me
never
hear
a
word
*NL*
more
about
him
!
None
here
care
what
becomes
of
him
;
if
you
do
,
act
the
*NL*
nurse
;
if
you
do
not
,
lock
him
up
and
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
she
began
to
bother
me
,
and
I
said
I
'd
had
enough
plague
with
the
*NL*
tiresome
thing
;
we
each
had
our
tasks
,
and
hers
was
to
wait
on
Linton
:
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
bid
me
leave
that
labour
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
they
managed
together
,
I
ca
n't
tell
.
I
fancy
he
fretted
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
and
moaned
hisseln
night
and
day
;
and
she
had
precious
little
rest
:
*NL*
one
could
guess
by
her
white
face
and
heavy
eyes
.
She
sometimes
came
*NL*
into
the
kitchen
all
wildered
like
,
and
looked
as
if
she
would
fain
beg
*NL*
assistance
;
but
I
was
not
going
to
disobey
the
master
:
I
never
dare
*NL*
disobey
him
,
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
,
though
I
thought
it
wrong
that
Kenneth
*NL*
should
not
be
sent
for
,
it
was
no
concern
of
mine
either
to
advise
or
*NL*
complain
,
and
I
always
refused
to
meddle
.
Once
or
twice
,
after
we
had
*NL*
gone
to
bed
,
I
've
happened
to
open
my
door
again
and
seen
her
sitting
*NL*
crying
on
the
stairs
'
-
top
;
and
then
I
've
shut
myself
in
quick
,
for
fear
*NL*
of
being
moved
to
interfere
.
I
did
pity
her
then
,
I
'm
sure
:
still
I
*NL*
did
n't
wish
to
lose
my
place
,
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
last
,
one
night
she
came
boldly
into
my
chamber
,
and
frightened
me
*NL*
out
of
my
wits
,
by
saying
,
``
Tell
Mr.
Heathcliff
that
his
son
is
dying
--
I
'm
*NL*
sure
he
is
,
this
time
.
Get
up
,
instantly
,
and
tell
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Having
uttered
this
speech
,
she
vanished
again
.
I
lay
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
listening
and
trembling
.
Nothing
stirred
--
the
house
was
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
mistaken
,
I
said
to
myself
.
He
's
got
over
it
.
I
need
n't
disturb
*NL*
them
;
and
I
began
to
doze
.
But
my
sleep
was
marred
a
second
time
by
a
*NL*
sharp
ringing
of
the
bell
--
the
only
bell
we
have
,
put
up
on
purpose
for
*NL*
Linton
;
and
the
master
called
to
me
to
see
what
was
the
matter
,
and
*NL*
inform
them
that
he
would
n't
have
that
noise
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
delivered
Catherine
's
message
.
He
cursed
to
himself
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
came
out
with
a
lighted
candle
,
and
proceeded
to
their
room
.
I
*NL*
followed
.
Mrs.
Heathcliff
was
seated
by
the
bedside
,
with
her
hands
*NL*
folded
on
her
knees
.
Her
father-in-law
went
up
,
held
the
light
to
*NL*
Linton
's
face
,
looked
at
him
,
and
touched
him
;
afterwards
he
turned
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Now
--
Catherine
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
do
you
feel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
dumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
How
do
you
feel
,
Catherine
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
's
safe
,
and
I
'm
free
,
''
she
answered
:
``
I
should
feel
well
--
but
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
with
a
bitterness
she
could
n't
conceal
,
``
you
have
left
me
so
*NL*
long
to
struggle
against
death
alone
,
that
I
feel
and
see
only
death
!
I
*NL*
feel
like
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
she
looked
like
it
,
too
!
I
gave
her
a
little
wine
.
Hareton
and
*NL*
Joseph
,
who
had
been
wakened
by
the
ringing
and
the
sound
of
feet
,
and
*NL*
heard
our
talk
from
outside
,
now
entered
.
Joseph
was
fain
,
I
believe
,
of
*NL*
the
lad
's
removal
;
Hareton
seemed
a
thought
bothered
:
though
he
was
more
*NL*
taken
up
with
staring
at
Catherine
than
thinking
of
Linton
.
But
the
*NL*
master
bid
him
get
off
to
bed
again
:
we
did
n't
want
his
help
.
He
*NL*
afterwards
made
Joseph
remove
the
body
to
his
chamber
,
and
told
me
to
*NL*
return
to
mine
,
and
Mrs.
Heathcliff
remained
by
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
morning
,
he
sent
me
to
tell
her
she
must
come
down
to
breakfast
:
*NL*
she
had
undressed
,
and
appeared
going
to
sleep
,
and
said
she
was
ill
;
at
*NL*
which
I
hardly
wondered
.
I
informed
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
*NL*
replied
,
--
``
Well
,
let
her
be
till
after
the
funeral
;
and
go
up
now
and
*NL*
then
to
get
her
what
is
needful
;
and
,
as
soon
as
she
seems
better
,
tell
*NL*
me
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
stayed
upstairs
a
fortnight
,
according
to
Zillah
;
who
visited
her
*NL*
twice
a
day
,
and
would
have
been
rather
more
friendly
,
but
her
attempts
*NL*
at
increasing
kindness
were
proudly
and
promptly
repelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
went
up
once
,
to
show
her
Linton
's
will
.
He
had
bequeathed
*NL*
the
whole
of
his
,
and
what
had
been
her
,
moveable
property
,
to
his
*NL*
father
:
the
poor
creature
was
threatened
,
or
coaxed
,
into
that
act
during
*NL*
her
week
's
absence
,
when
his
uncle
died
.
The
lands
,
being
a
minor
,
he
*NL*
could
not
meddle
with
.
However
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
has
claimed
and
kept
them
*NL*
in
his
wife
's
right
and
his
also
:
I
suppose
legally
;
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
Catherine
,
destitute
of
cash
and
friends
,
can
not
disturb
his
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
,
'
said
Zillah
,
`
ever
approached
her
door
,
except
that
once
,
but
*NL*
I
;
and
nobody
asked
anything
about
her
.
The
first
occasion
of
her
coming
*NL*
down
into
the
house
was
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
.
She
had
cried
out
,
when
I
*NL*
carried
up
her
dinner
,
that
she
could
n't
bear
any
longer
being
in
the
*NL*
cold
;
and
I
told
her
the
master
was
going
to
Thrushcross
Grange
,
and
*NL*
Earnshaw
and
I
need
n't
hinder
her
from
descending
;
so
,
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
heard
Heathcliff
's
horse
trot
off
,
she
made
her
appearance
,
donned
in
*NL*
black
,
and
her
yellow
curls
combed
back
behind
her
ears
as
plain
as
a
*NL*
Quaker
:
she
could
n't
comb
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Joseph
and
I
generally
go
to
chapel
on
Sundays
:
'
the
kirk
,
you
know
,
has
*NL*
no
minister
now
,
explained
Mrs.
Dean
;
and
they
call
the
Methodists
'
or
*NL*
Baptists
'
place
-LRB-
I
ca
n't
say
which
it
is
-RRB-
at
Gimmerton
,
a
chapel
.
`
Joseph
*NL*
had
gone
,
'
she
continued
,
`
but
I
thought
proper
to
bide
at
home
.
Young
*NL*
folks
are
always
the
better
for
an
elder
's
over-looking
;
and
Hareton
,
*NL*
with
all
his
bashfulness
,
is
n't
a
model
of
nice
behaviour
.
I
let
him
*NL*
know
that
his
cousin
would
very
likely
sit
with
us
,
and
she
had
been
*NL*
always
used
to
see
the
Sabbath
respected
;
so
he
had
as
good
leave
his
*NL*
guns
and
bits
of
indoor
work
alone
,
while
she
stayed
.
He
coloured
up
at
*NL*
the
news
,
and
cast
his
eyes
over
his
hands
and
clothes
.
The
train-oil
*NL*
and
gunpowder
were
shoved
out
of
sight
in
a
minute
.
I
saw
he
meant
to
*NL*
give
her
his
company
;
and
I
guessed
,
by
his
way
,
he
wanted
to
be
*NL*
presentable
;
so
,
laughing
,
as
I
durst
not
laugh
when
the
master
is
by
,
I
*NL*
offered
to
help
him
,
if
he
would
,
and
joked
at
his
confusion
.
He
grew
*NL*
sullen
,
and
began
to
swear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Mrs.
Dean
,
'
Zillah
went
on
,
seeing
me
not
pleased
by
her
manner
,
*NL*
`
you
happen
think
your
young
lady
too
fine
for
Mr.
Hareton
;
and
happen
*NL*
you
're
right
:
but
I
own
I
should
love
well
to
bring
her
pride
a
peg
*NL*
lower
.
And
what
will
all
her
learning
and
her
daintiness
do
for
her
,
*NL*
now
?
She
's
as
poor
as
you
or
I
:
poorer
,
I
'll
be
bound
:
you
're
saying
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
doing
my
little
all
that
road
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
allowed
Zillah
to
give
him
her
aid
;
and
she
flattered
him
into
a
*NL*
good
humour
;
so
,
when
Catherine
came
,
half
forgetting
her
former
insults
,
*NL*
he
tried
to
make
himself
agreeable
,
by
the
housekeeper
's
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Missis
walked
in
,
'
she
said
,
`
as
chill
as
an
icicle
,
and
as
high
as
a
*NL*
princess
.
I
got
up
and
offered
her
my
seat
in
the
arm-chair
.
No
,
she
*NL*
turned
up
her
nose
at
my
civility
.
Earnshaw
rose
,
too
,
and
bid
her
come
*NL*
to
the
settle
,
and
sit
close
by
the
fire
:
he
was
sure
she
was
starved
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
've
been
starved
a
month
and
more
,
''
she
answered
,
resting
on
the
word
*NL*
as
scornful
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
she
got
a
chair
for
herself
,
and
placed
it
at
a
distance
from
both
*NL*
of
us
.
Having
sat
till
she
was
warm
,
she
began
to
look
round
,
and
*NL*
discovered
a
number
of
books
on
the
dresser
;
she
was
instantly
upon
her
*NL*
feet
again
,
stretching
to
reach
them
:
but
they
were
too
high
up
.
Her
*NL*
cousin
,
after
watching
her
endeavours
a
while
,
at
last
summoned
courage
*NL*
to
help
her
;
she
held
her
frock
,
and
he
filled
it
with
the
first
that
*NL*
came
to
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
a
great
advance
for
the
lad
.
She
did
n't
thank
him
;
still
,
he
*NL*
felt
gratified
that
she
had
accepted
his
assistance
,
and
ventured
to
*NL*
stand
behind
as
she
examined
them
,
and
even
to
stoop
and
point
out
what
*NL*
struck
his
fancy
in
certain
old
pictures
which
they
contained
;
nor
was
he
*NL*
daunted
by
the
saucy
style
in
which
she
jerked
the
page
from
his
finger
:
*NL*
he
contented
himself
with
going
a
bit
farther
back
and
looking
at
her
*NL*
instead
of
the
book
.
She
continued
reading
,
or
seeking
for
something
to
*NL*
read
.
His
attention
became
,
by
degrees
,
quite
centred
in
the
study
of
*NL*
her
thick
silky
curls
:
her
face
he
could
n't
see
,
and
she
could
n't
see
*NL*
him
.
And
,
perhaps
,
not
quite
awake
to
what
he
did
,
but
attracted
like
a
*NL*
child
to
a
candle
,
at
last
he
proceeded
from
staring
to
touching
;
he
put
*NL*
out
his
hand
and
stroked
one
curl
,
as
gently
as
if
it
were
a
bird
.
He
*NL*
might
have
stuck
a
knife
into
her
neck
,
she
started
round
in
such
a
*NL*
taking
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Get
away
this
moment
!
How
dare
you
touch
me
?
Why
are
you
stopping
*NL*
there
?
''
she
cried
,
in
a
tone
of
disgust
.
``
I
ca
n't
endure
you
!
I
'll
go
*NL*
upstairs
again
,
if
you
come
near
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Hareton
recoiled
,
looking
as
foolish
as
he
could
do
:
he
sat
down
in
*NL*
the
settle
very
quiet
,
and
she
continued
turning
over
her
volumes
another
*NL*
half
hour
;
finally
,
Earnshaw
crossed
over
,
and
whispered
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Will
you
ask
her
to
read
to
us
,
Zillah
?
I
'm
stalled
of
doing
naught
;
*NL*
and
I
do
like
--
I
could
like
to
hear
her
!
Dunnot
say
I
wanted
it
,
but
ask
*NL*
of
yourseln
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Mr.
Hareton
wishes
you
would
read
to
us
,
ma'am
,
''
I
said
,
immediately
.
*NL*
``
He
'd
take
it
very
kind
--
he
'd
be
much
obliged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
frowned
;
and
looking
up
,
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Mr.
Hareton
,
and
the
whole
set
of
you
,
will
be
good
enough
to
*NL*
understand
that
I
reject
any
pretence
at
kindness
you
have
the
hypocrisy
*NL*
to
offer
!
I
despise
you
,
and
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
any
of
you
!
*NL*
When
I
would
have
given
my
life
for
one
kind
word
,
even
to
see
one
of
*NL*
your
faces
,
you
all
kept
off
.
But
I
wo
n't
complain
to
you
!
I
'm
driven
*NL*
down
here
by
the
cold
;
not
either
to
amuse
you
or
enjoy
your
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
could
I
ha
'
done
?
''
began
Earnshaw
.
``
How
was
I
to
blame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Oh
!
you
are
an
exception
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Heathcliff
.
``
I
never
missed
*NL*
such
a
concern
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
But
I
offered
more
than
once
,
and
asked
,
''
he
said
,
kindling
up
at
her
*NL*
pertness
,
``
I
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
let
me
wake
for
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Be
silent
!
I
'll
go
out
of
doors
,
or
anywhere
,
rather
than
have
your
*NL*
disagreeable
voice
in
my
ear
!
''
said
my
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hareton
muttered
she
might
go
to
hell
,
for
him
!
and
unslinging
his
gun
,
*NL*
restrained
himself
from
his
Sunday
occupations
no
longer
.
He
talked
now
,
*NL*
freely
enough
;
and
she
presently
saw
fit
to
retreat
to
her
solitude
:
but
*NL*
the
frost
had
set
in
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
pride
,
she
was
forced
to
*NL*
condescend
to
our
company
,
more
and
more
.
However
,
I
took
care
there
*NL*
should
be
no
further
scorning
at
my
good
nature
:
ever
since
,
I
've
been
as
*NL*
stiff
as
herself
;
and
she
has
no
lover
or
liker
among
us
:
and
she
does
*NL*
not
deserve
one
;
for
,
let
them
say
the
least
word
to
her
,
and
she
'll
curl
*NL*
back
without
respect
of
any
one
.
She
'll
snap
at
the
master
himself
,
and
*NL*
as
good
as
dares
him
to
thrash
her
;
and
the
more
hurt
she
gets
,
the
more
*NL*
venomous
she
grows
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
on
hearing
this
account
from
Zillah
,
I
determined
to
leave
my
*NL*
situation
,
take
a
cottage
,
and
get
Catherine
to
come
and
live
with
me
:
*NL*
but
Mr.
Heathcliff
would
as
soon
permit
that
as
he
would
set
up
Hareton
*NL*
in
an
independent
house
;
and
I
can
see
no
remedy
,
at
present
,
unless
she
*NL*
could
marry
again
;
and
that
scheme
it
does
not
come
within
my
province
to
*NL*
arrange
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
Mrs.
Dean
's
story
.
Notwithstanding
the
doctor
's
prophecy
,
I
*NL*
am
rapidly
recovering
strength
;
and
though
it
be
only
the
second
week
in
*NL*
January
,
I
propose
getting
out
on
horseback
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
riding
*NL*
over
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
to
inform
my
landlord
that
I
shall
spend
the
*NL*
next
six
months
in
London
;
and
,
if
he
likes
,
he
may
look
out
for
another
*NL*
tenant
to
take
the
place
after
October
.
I
would
not
pass
another
winter
*NL*
here
for
much
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
was
bright
,
calm
,
and
frosty
.
I
went
to
the
Heights
as
I
*NL*
proposed
:
my
housekeeper
entreated
me
to
bear
a
little
note
from
her
to
*NL*
her
young
lady
,
and
I
did
not
refuse
,
for
the
worthy
woman
was
not
*NL*
conscious
of
anything
odd
in
her
request
.
The
front
door
stood
open
,
but
*NL*
the
jealous
gate
was
fastened
,
as
at
my
last
visit
;
I
knocked
and
invoked
*NL*
Earnshaw
from
among
the
garden-beds
;
he
unchained
it
,
and
I
entered
.
The
*NL*
fellow
is
as
handsome
a
rustic
as
need
be
seen
.
I
took
particular
notice
*NL*
of
him
this
time
;
but
then
he
does
his
best
apparently
to
make
the
least
*NL*
of
his
advantages
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
if
Mr.
Heathcliff
were
at
home
?
He
answered
,
No
;
but
he
would
be
*NL*
in
at
dinner-time
.
It
was
eleven
o'clock
,
and
I
announced
my
intention
*NL*
of
going
in
and
waiting
for
him
;
at
which
he
immediately
flung
down
his
*NL*
tools
and
accompanied
me
,
in
the
office
of
watchdog
,
not
as
a
substitute
*NL*
for
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
entered
together
;
Catherine
was
there
,
making
herself
useful
in
*NL*
preparing
some
vegetables
for
the
approaching
meal
;
she
looked
more
*NL*
sulky
and
less
spirited
than
when
I
had
seen
her
first
.
She
hardly
*NL*
raised
her
eyes
to
notice
me
,
and
continued
her
employment
with
the
same
*NL*
disregard
to
common
forms
of
politeness
as
before
;
never
returning
my
*NL*
bow
and
good-morning
by
the
slightest
acknowledgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
does
not
seem
so
amiable
,
'
I
thought
,
`
as
Mrs.
Dean
would
persuade
*NL*
me
to
believe
.
She
's
a
beauty
,
it
is
true
;
but
not
an
angel
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Earnshaw
surlily
bid
her
remove
her
things
to
the
kitchen
.
`
Remove
them
*NL*
yourself
,
'
she
said
,
pushing
them
from
her
as
soon
as
she
had
done
;
and
*NL*
retiring
to
a
stool
by
the
window
,
where
she
began
to
carve
figures
of
*NL*
birds
and
beasts
out
of
the
turnip-parings
in
her
lap
.
I
approached
her
,
*NL*
pretending
to
desire
a
view
of
the
garden
;
and
,
as
I
fancied
,
adroitly
*NL*
dropped
Mrs.
Dean
's
note
on
to
her
knee
,
unnoticed
by
Hareton
--
but
she
*NL*
asked
aloud
,
`
What
is
that
?
'
And
chucked
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
letter
from
your
old
acquaintance
,
the
housekeeper
at
the
Grange
,
'
I
*NL*
answered
;
annoyed
at
her
exposing
my
kind
deed
,
and
fearful
lest
it
*NL*
should
be
imagined
a
missive
of
my
own
.
She
would
gladly
have
gathered
*NL*
it
up
at
this
information
,
but
Hareton
beat
her
;
he
seized
and
put
it
in
*NL*
his
waistcoat
,
saying
Mr.
Heathcliff
should
look
at
it
first
.
Thereat
,
*NL*
Catherine
silently
turned
her
face
from
us
,
and
,
very
stealthily
,
drew
*NL*
out
her
pocket-handkerchief
and
applied
it
to
her
eyes
;
and
her
cousin
,
*NL*
after
struggling
awhile
to
keep
down
his
softer
feelings
,
pulled
out
the
*NL*
letter
and
flung
it
on
the
floor
beside
her
,
as
ungraciously
as
he
could
.
*NL*
Catherine
caught
and
perused
it
eagerly
;
then
she
put
a
few
questions
to
*NL*
me
concerning
the
inmates
,
rational
and
irrational
,
of
her
former
home
;
*NL*
and
gazing
towards
the
hills
,
murmured
in
soliloquy
:
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
to
be
riding
Minny
down
there
!
I
should
like
to
be
*NL*
climbing
up
there
!
Oh
!
I
'm
tired
--
I
'm
_
stalled
_
,
Hareton
!
'
And
she
*NL*
leant
her
pretty
head
back
against
the
sill
,
with
half
a
yawn
and
half
a
*NL*
sigh
,
and
lapsed
into
an
aspect
of
abstracted
sadness
:
neither
caring
nor
*NL*
knowing
whether
we
remarked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
'
I
said
,
after
sitting
some
time
mute
,
`
you
are
not
*NL*
aware
that
I
am
an
acquaintance
of
yours
?
so
intimate
that
I
think
it
*NL*
strange
you
wo
n't
come
and
speak
to
me
.
My
housekeeper
never
wearies
of
*NL*
talking
about
and
praising
you
;
and
she
'll
be
greatly
disappointed
if
I
*NL*
return
with
no
news
of
or
from
you
,
except
that
you
received
her
letter
*NL*
and
said
nothing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
wonder
at
this
speech
,
and
asked
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Does
Ellen
like
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
very
well
,
'
I
replied
,
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
tell
her
,
'
she
continued
,
`
that
I
would
answer
her
letter
,
but
*NL*
I
have
no
materials
for
writing
:
not
even
a
book
from
which
I
might
tear
*NL*
a
leaf
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
books
!
'
I
exclaimed
.
`
How
do
you
contrive
to
live
here
without
them
?
*NL*
if
I
may
take
the
liberty
to
inquire
.
Though
provided
with
a
large
*NL*
library
,
I
'm
frequently
very
dull
at
the
Grange
;
take
my
books
away
,
and
*NL*
I
should
be
desperate
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
always
reading
,
when
I
had
them
,
'
said
Catherine
;
`
and
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
never
reads
;
so
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
destroy
my
books
.
*NL*
I
have
not
had
a
glimpse
of
one
for
weeks
.
Only
once
,
I
searched
through
*NL*
Joseph
's
store
of
theology
,
to
his
great
irritation
;
and
once
,
Hareton
,
I
*NL*
came
upon
a
secret
stock
in
your
room
--
some
Latin
and
Greek
,
and
some
*NL*
tales
and
poetry
:
all
old
friends
.
I
brought
the
last
here
--
and
you
*NL*
gathered
them
,
as
a
magpie
gathers
silver
spoons
,
for
the
mere
love
of
*NL*
stealing
!
They
are
of
no
use
to
you
;
or
else
you
concealed
them
in
the
*NL*
bad
spirit
that
,
as
you
can
not
enjoy
them
,
nobody
else
shall
.
Perhaps
*NL*
_
your
_
envy
counselled
Mr.
Heathcliff
to
rob
me
of
my
treasures
?
But
*NL*
I
've
most
of
them
written
on
my
brain
and
printed
in
my
heart
,
and
you
*NL*
can
not
deprive
me
of
those
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Earnshaw
blushed
crimson
when
his
cousin
made
this
revelation
of
his
*NL*
private
literary
accumulations
,
and
stammered
an
indignant
denial
of
her
*NL*
accusations
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Hareton
is
desirous
of
increasing
his
amount
of
knowledge
,
'
I
said
,
*NL*
coming
to
his
rescue
.
`
He
is
not
_
envious
_
,
but
_
emulous
_
of
your
*NL*
attainments
.
He
'll
be
a
clever
scholar
in
a
few
years
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
he
wants
me
to
sink
into
a
dunce
,
meantime
,
'
answered
Catherine
.
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
hear
him
trying
to
spell
and
read
to
himself
,
and
pretty
blunders
*NL*
he
makes
!
I
wish
you
would
repeat
Chevy
Chase
as
you
did
yesterday
:
it
*NL*
was
extremely
funny
.
I
heard
you
;
and
I
heard
you
turning
over
the
*NL*
dictionary
to
seek
out
the
hard
words
,
and
then
cursing
because
you
*NL*
could
n't
read
their
explanations
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
evidently
thought
it
too
bad
that
he
should
be
laughed
at
*NL*
for
his
ignorance
,
and
then
laughed
at
for
trying
to
remove
it
.
I
had
a
*NL*
similar
notion
;
and
,
remembering
Mrs.
Dean
's
anecdote
of
his
first
*NL*
attempt
at
enlightening
the
darkness
in
which
he
had
been
reared
,
I
*NL*
observed
,
--
`
But
,
Mrs.
Heathcliff
,
we
have
each
had
a
commencement
,
and
*NL*
each
stumbled
and
tottered
on
the
threshold
;
had
our
teachers
scorned
*NL*
instead
of
aiding
us
,
we
should
stumble
and
totter
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
she
replied
,
'
I
do
n't
wish
to
limit
his
acquirements
:
still
,
he
has
*NL*
no
right
to
appropriate
what
is
mine
,
and
make
it
ridiculous
to
me
with
*NL*
his
vile
mistakes
and
mispronunciations
!
Those
books
,
both
prose
and
*NL*
verse
,
are
consecrated
to
me
by
other
associations
;
and
I
hate
to
have
*NL*
them
debased
and
profaned
in
his
mouth
!
Besides
,
of
all
,
he
has
selected
*NL*
my
favourite
pieces
that
I
love
the
most
to
repeat
,
as
if
out
of
*NL*
deliberate
malice
.

's
chest
heaved
in
silence
a
minute
:
he
laboured
under
a
severe
*NL*
sense
of
mortification
and
wrath
,
which
it
was
no
easy
task
to
suppress
.
*NL*
I
rose
,
and
,
from
a
gentlemanly
idea
of
relieving
his
embarrassment
,
took
*NL*
up
my
station
in
the
doorway
,
surveying
the
external
prospect
as
I
stood
.
*NL*
He
followed
my
example
,
and
left
the
room
;
but
presently
reappeared
,
*NL*
bearing
half
a
dozen
volumes
in
his
hands
,
which
he
threw
into
*NL*
Catherine
's
lap
,
exclaiming
,
--
`
Take
them
!
I
never
want
to
hear
,
or
read
,
*NL*
or
think
of
them
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
have
them
now
,
'
she
answered
.
'
I
shall
connect
them
with
you
,
*NL*
and
hate
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
one
that
had
obviously
been
often
turned
over
,
and
read
a
*NL*
portion
in
the
drawling
tone
of
a
beginner
;
then
laughed
,
and
threw
it
*NL*
from
her
.
`
And
listen
,
'
she
continued
,
provokingly
,
commencing
a
verse
*NL*
of
an
old
ballad
in
the
same
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
self-love
would
endure
no
further
torment
:
I
heard
,
and
not
*NL*
altogether
disapprovingly
,
a
manual
check
given
to
her
saucy
tongue
.
The
*NL*
little
wretch
had
done
her
utmost
to
hurt
her
cousin
's
sensitive
though
*NL*
uncultivated
feelings
,
and
a
physical
argument
was
the
only
mode
he
had
*NL*
of
balancing
the
account
,
and
repaying
its
effects
on
the
inflictor
.
He
*NL*
afterwards
gathered
the
books
and
hurled
them
on
the
fire
.
I
read
in
his
*NL*
countenance
what
anguish
it
was
to
offer
that
sacrifice
to
spleen
.
I
*NL*
fancied
that
as
they
consumed
,
he
recalled
the
pleasure
they
had
already
*NL*
imparted
,
and
the
triumph
and
ever-increasing
pleasure
he
had
anticipated
*NL*
from
them
;
and
I
fancied
I
guessed
the
incitement
to
his
secret
studies
*NL*
also
.
He
had
been
content
with
daily
labour
and
rough
animal
enjoyments
,
*NL*
till
Catherine
crossed
his
path
.
Shame
at
her
scorn
,
and
hope
of
her
*NL*
approval
,
were
his
first
prompters
to
higher
pursuits
;
and
instead
of
*NL*
guarding
him
from
one
and
winning
him
to
the
other
,
his
endeavours
to
*NL*
raise
himself
had
produced
just
the
contrary
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
that
's
all
the
good
that
such
a
brute
as
you
can
get
from
them
!
'
*NL*
cried
Catherine
,
sucking
her
damaged
lip
,
and
watching
the
conflagration
*NL*
with
indignant
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
'd
_
better
_
hold
your
tongue
,
now
,
'
he
answered
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
agitation
precluded
further
speech
;
he
advanced
hastily
to
the
*NL*
entrance
,
where
I
made
way
for
him
to
pass
.
But
ere
he
had
crossed
the
*NL*
door-stones
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
coming
up
the
causeway
,
encountered
him
,
and
*NL*
laying
hold
of
his
shoulder
asked
,
--
`
What
's
to
do
now
,
my
lad
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Naught
,
naught
,
'
he
said
,
and
broke
away
to
enjoy
his
grief
and
anger
in
*NL*
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heathcliff
gazed
after
him
,
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
will
be
odd
if
I
thwart
myself
,
'
he
muttered
,
unconscious
that
I
was
*NL*
behind
him
.
`
But
when
I
look
for
his
father
in
his
face
,
I
find
_
her
_
*NL*
every
day
more
!
How
the
devil
is
he
so
like
?
I
can
hardly
bear
to
see
*NL*
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
his
eyes
to
the
ground
,
and
walked
moodily
in
.
There
was
a
*NL*
restless
,
anxious
expression
in
his
countenance
.
I
had
never
remarked
*NL*
there
before
;
and
he
looked
sparer
in
person
.
His
daughter-in-law
,
on
*NL*
perceiving
him
through
the
window
,
immediately
escaped
to
the
kitchen
,
so
*NL*
that
I
remained
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
again
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
'
he
said
,
in
reply
*NL*
to
my
greeting
;
`
from
selfish
motives
partly
:
I
do
n't
think
I
could
*NL*
readily
supply
your
loss
in
this
desolation
.
I
've
wondered
more
than
*NL*
once
what
brought
you
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
idle
whim
,
I
fear
,
sir
,
'
was
my
answer
;
`
or
else
an
idle
whim
is
*NL*
going
to
spirit
me
away
.
I
shall
set
out
for
London
next
week
;
and
I
*NL*
must
give
you
warning
that
I
feel
no
disposition
to
retain
Thrushcross
*NL*
Grange
beyond
the
twelve
months
I
agreed
to
rent
it
.
I
believe
I
shall
*NL*
not
live
there
any
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
indeed
;
you
're
tired
of
being
banished
from
the
world
,
are
you
?
'
he
*NL*
said
.
`
But
if
you
be
coming
to
plead
off
paying
for
a
place
you
wo
n't
*NL*
occupy
,
your
journey
is
useless
:
I
never
relent
in
exacting
my
due
from
*NL*
any
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
coming
to
plead
off
nothing
about
it
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
considerably
*NL*
irritated
.
`
Should
you
wish
it
,
I
'll
settle
with
you
now
,
'
and
I
drew
my
*NL*
note-book
from
my
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
he
replied
,
coolly
;
`
you
'll
leave
sufficient
behind
to
cover
*NL*
your
debts
,
if
you
fail
to
return
:
I
'm
not
in
such
a
hurry
.
Sit
down
and
*NL*
take
your
dinner
with
us
;
a
guest
that
is
safe
from
repeating
his
visit
*NL*
can
generally
be
made
welcome
.
Catherine
!
bring
the
things
in
:
where
are
*NL*
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
reappeared
,
bearing
a
tray
of
knives
and
forks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
get
your
dinner
with
Joseph
,
'
muttered
Heathcliff
,
aside
,
`
and
*NL*
remain
in
the
kitchen
till
he
is
gone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
his
directions
very
punctually
:
perhaps
she
had
no
temptation
*NL*
to
transgress
.
Living
among
clowns
and
misanthropists
,
she
probably
*NL*
can
not
appreciate
a
better
class
of
people
when
she
meets
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
grim
and
saturnine
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Hareton
,
*NL*
absolutely
dumb
,
on
the
other
,
I
made
a
somewhat
cheerless
meal
,
and
bade
*NL*
adieu
early
.
I
would
have
departed
by
the
back
way
,
to
get
a
last
*NL*
glimpse
of
Catherine
and
annoy
old
Joseph
;
but
Hareton
received
orders
to
*NL*
lead
up
my
horse
,
and
my
host
himself
escorted
me
to
the
door
,
so
I
could
*NL*
not
fulfil
my
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
dreary
life
gets
over
in
that
house
!
'
I
reflected
,
while
riding
down
*NL*
the
road
.
`
What
a
realisation
of
something
more
romantic
than
a
fairy
*NL*
tale
it
would
have
been
for
Mrs.
Linton
Heathcliff
,
had
she
and
I
struck
*NL*
up
an
attachment
,
as
her
good
nurse
desired
,
and
migrated
together
into
*NL*
the
stirring
atmosphere
of
the
town
!

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
1802
.
--
This
September
I
was
invited
to
devastate
the
moors
of
a
friend
in
*NL*
the
north
,
and
on
my
journey
to
his
abode
,
I
unexpectedly
came
within
*NL*
fifteen
miles
of
Gimmerton
.
The
ostler
at
a
roadside
public-house
was
*NL*
holding
a
pail
of
water
to
refresh
my
horses
,
when
a
cart
of
very
green
*NL*
oats
,
newly
reaped
,
passed
by
,
and
he
remarked
,
--
`
Yon
's
frough
Gimmerton
,
*NL*
nah
!
They
're
allas
three
wick
'
after
other
folk
wi
'
ther
harvest
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Gimmerton
?
'
I
repeated
--
my
residence
in
that
locality
had
already
grown
*NL*
dim
and
dreamy
.
`
Ah
!
I
know
.
How
far
is
it
from
this
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Happen
fourteen
mile
o'er
th
'
hills
;
and
a
rough
road
,
'
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
impulse
seized
me
to
visit
Thrushcross
Grange
.
It
was
scarcely
*NL*
noon
,
and
I
conceived
that
I
might
as
well
pass
the
night
under
my
own
*NL*
roof
as
in
an
inn
.
Besides
,
I
could
spare
a
day
easily
to
arrange
*NL*
matters
with
my
landlord
,
and
thus
save
myself
the
trouble
of
invading
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
again
.
Having
rested
awhile
,
I
directed
my
servant
to
*NL*
inquire
the
way
to
the
village
;
and
,
with
great
fatigue
to
our
beasts
,
we
*NL*
managed
the
distance
in
some
three
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
him
there
,
and
proceeded
down
the
valley
alone
.
The
grey
church
*NL*
looked
greyer
,
and
the
lonely
churchyard
lonelier
.
I
distinguished
a
*NL*
moor-sheep
cropping
the
short
turf
on
the
graves
.
It
was
sweet
,
warm
*NL*
weather
--
too
warm
for
travelling
;
but
the
heat
did
not
hinder
me
from
*NL*
enjoying
the
delightful
scenery
above
and
below
:
had
I
seen
it
nearer
*NL*
August
,
I
'm
sure
it
would
have
tempted
me
to
waste
a
month
among
its
*NL*
solitudes
.
In
winter
nothing
more
dreary
,
in
summer
nothing
more
divine
,
*NL*
than
those
glens
shut
in
by
hills
,
and
those
bluff
,
bold
swells
of
heath
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
reached
the
Grange
before
sunset
,
and
knocked
for
admittance
;
but
the
*NL*
family
had
retreated
into
the
back
premises
,
I
judged
,
by
one
thin
,
blue
*NL*
wreath
,
curling
from
the
kitchen
chimney
,
and
they
did
not
hear
.
I
rode
*NL*
into
the
court
.
Under
the
porch
,
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
sat
knitting
,
and
*NL*
an
old
woman
reclined
on
the
housesteps
,
smoking
a
meditative
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
Mrs.
Dean
within
?
'
I
demanded
of
the
dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mistress
Dean
?
Nay
!
'
she
answered
,
`
she
does
n't
bide
here
:
shoo
's
up
at
*NL*
th
'
Heights
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
the
housekeeper
,
then
?
'
I
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eea
,
aw
keep
th
'
hause
,
'
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
'm
Mr.
Lockwood
,
the
master
.
Are
there
any
rooms
to
lodge
me
in
,
*NL*
I
wonder
?
I
wish
to
stay
all
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
T
'
maister
!
'
she
cried
in
astonishment
.
`
Whet
,
whoiver
knew
yah
wur
*NL*
coming
?
Yah
sud
ha
'
send
word
.
They
's
nowt
norther
dry
nor
mensful
*NL*
abaht
t
'
place
:
nowt
there
is
n't
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
down
her
pipe
and
bustled
in
,
the
girl
followed
,
and
I
entered
*NL*
too
;
soon
perceiving
that
her
report
was
true
,
and
,
moreover
,
that
I
had
*NL*
almost
upset
her
wits
by
my
unwelcome
apparition
,
I
bade
her
be
composed
.
*NL*
I
would
go
out
for
a
walk
;
and
,
meantime
she
must
try
to
prepare
a
corner
*NL*
of
a
sitting-room
for
me
to
sup
in
,
and
a
bedroom
to
sleep
in
.
No
*NL*
sweeping
and
dusting
,
only
good
fire
and
dry
sheets
were
necessary
.
She
*NL*
seemed
willing
to
do
her
best
;
though
she
thrust
the
hearth-brush
into
*NL*
the
grates
in
mistake
for
the
poker
,
and
malappropriated
several
other
*NL*
articles
of
her
craft
:
but
I
retired
,
confiding
in
her
energy
for
a
*NL*
resting-place
against
my
return
.
Wuthering
Heights
was
the
goal
of
my
*NL*
proposed
excursion
.
An
afterthought
brought
me
back
,
when
I
had
quitted
*NL*
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
well
at
the
Heights
?
'
I
inquired
of
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eea
,
f
'
r
owt
ee
knaw
!
'
she
answered
,
skurrying
away
with
a
pan
of
hot
*NL*
cinders
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
asked
why
Mrs.
Dean
had
deserted
the
Grange
,
but
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
delay
her
at
such
a
crisis
,
so
I
turned
away
and
made
my
*NL*
exit
,
rambling
leisurely
along
,
with
the
glow
of
a
sinking
sun
behind
,
*NL*
and
the
mild
glory
of
a
rising
moon
in
front
--
one
fading
,
and
the
other
*NL*
brightening
--
as
I
quitted
the
park
,
and
climbed
the
stony
by-road
*NL*
branching
off
to
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
dwelling
.
Before
I
arrived
in
sight
of
*NL*
it
,
all
that
remained
of
day
was
a
beamless
amber
light
along
the
west
:
*NL*
but
I
could
see
every
pebble
on
the
path
,
and
every
blade
of
grass
,
by
*NL*
that
splendid
moon
.
I
had
neither
to
climb
the
gate
nor
to
knock
--
it
*NL*
yielded
to
my
hand
.
That
is
an
improvement
,
I
thought
.
And
I
noticed
*NL*
another
,
by
the
aid
of
my
nostrils
;
a
fragrance
of
stocks
and
wallflowers
*NL*
wafted
on
the
air
from
amongst
the
homely
fruit-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
doors
and
lattices
were
open
;
and
yet
,
as
is
usually
the
case
in
a
*NL*
coal-district
,
a
fine
red
fire
illumined
the
chimney
:
the
comfort
which
*NL*
the
eye
derives
from
it
renders
the
extra
heat
endurable
.
But
the
house
*NL*
of
Wuthering
Heights
is
so
large
that
the
inmates
have
plenty
of
space
*NL*
for
withdrawing
out
of
its
influence
;
and
accordingly
what
inmates
there
*NL*
were
had
stationed
themselves
not
far
from
one
of
the
windows
.
I
could
*NL*
both
see
them
and
hear
them
talk
before
I
entered
,
and
looked
and
*NL*
listened
in
consequence
;
being
moved
thereto
by
a
mingled
sense
of
*NL*
curiosity
and
envy
,
that
grew
as
I
lingered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Con
-
_
trary
_
!
'
said
a
voice
as
sweet
as
a
silver
bell
.
`
That
for
the
*NL*
third
time
,
you
dunce
!
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
again
.
Recollect
,
or
*NL*
I
'll
pull
your
hair
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Contrary
,
then
,
'
answered
another
,
in
deep
but
softened
tones
.
`
And
now
,
*NL*
kiss
me
,
for
minding
so
well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
read
it
over
first
correctly
,
without
a
single
mistake
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
male
speaker
began
to
read
:
he
was
a
young
man
,
respectably
dressed
*NL*
and
seated
at
a
table
,
having
a
book
before
him
.
His
handsome
features
*NL*
glowed
with
pleasure
,
and
his
eyes
kept
impatiently
wandering
from
the
*NL*
page
to
a
small
white
hand
over
his
shoulder
,
which
recalled
him
by
a
*NL*
smart
slap
on
the
cheek
,
whenever
its
owner
detected
such
signs
of
*NL*
inattention
.
Its
owner
stood
behind
;
her
light
,
shining
ringlets
*NL*
blending
,
at
intervals
,
with
his
brown
looks
,
as
she
bent
to
superintend
*NL*
his
studies
;
and
her
face
--
it
was
lucky
he
could
not
see
her
face
,
or
he
*NL*
would
never
have
been
so
steady
.
I
could
;
and
I
bit
my
lip
in
spite
,
at
*NL*
having
thrown
away
the
chance
I
might
have
had
of
doing
something
besides
*NL*
staring
at
its
smiting
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
task
was
done
,
not
free
from
further
blunders
;
but
the
pupil
claimed
*NL*
a
reward
,
and
received
at
least
five
kisses
;
which
,
however
,
he
*NL*
generously
returned
.
Then
they
came
to
the
door
,
and
from
their
*NL*
conversation
I
judged
they
were
about
to
issue
out
and
have
a
walk
on
the
*NL*
moors
.
I
supposed
I
should
be
condemned
in
Hareton
Earnshaw
's
heart
,
if
*NL*
not
by
his
mouth
,
to
the
lowest
pit
in
the
infernal
regions
if
I
showed
*NL*
my
unfortunate
person
in
his
neighbourhood
then
;
and
feeling
very
mean
*NL*
and
malignant
,
I
skulked
round
to
seek
refuge
in
the
kitchen
.
There
was
*NL*
unobstructed
admittance
on
that
side
also
;
and
at
the
door
sat
my
old
*NL*
friend
Nelly
Dean
,
sewing
and
singing
a
song
;
which
was
often
interrupted
*NL*
from
within
by
harsh
words
of
scorn
and
intolerance
,
uttered
in
far
from
*NL*
musical
accents
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
rayther
,
by
th
'
haulf
,
hev
'
'em
swearing
i
'
my
lugs
fro

h
morn
to
*NL*
neeght
,
nor
hearken

!
'
said
the
tenant
of
the
kitchen
,
in
*NL*
answer
to
an
unheard
speech
of
Nelly
's
.
`
It
's
a
blazing
shame
,
that
I
*NL*
can
not
oppen
t
'
blessed
Book
,
but
yah
set
up
them
glories
to
sattan
,
and
*NL*
all
t
'
flaysome
wickednesses
that
iver
were
born
into
th

warld
!
Oh

*NL*
ye
're

and
shoo
's
another
;
and
that
poor
lad
'll
be
lost
*NL*
atween
ye
.
Poor
lad
!
'
he
added
,
with
a
groan
;
`
he
's
witched
:
I
'm
sartin
*NL*
o
n't
.
Oh
,
Lord
,
judge
'em
,
for
there
's
norther
law
nor
justice
among
wer
*NL*
rullers
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
!
or
we
should
be
sitting
in
flaming
fagots
,
I
suppose
,
'
retorted
the
*NL*
singer
.
`
But
wisht
,
old
man
,
and
read
your
Bible
like
a
Christian
,
and
*NL*
never
mind
me
.
This
is
``
Fairy
Annie
's
Wedding
''
--
a
bonny
tune
--
it
goes
to
*NL*
a
dance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dean
was
about
to
recommence
,
when
I
advanced
;
and
recognising
me
*NL*
directly
,
she
jumped
to
her
feet
,
crying
--
`
Why
,
bless
you
,
Mr.
Lockwood
!
*NL*
How
could
you
think
of
returning
in
this
way
?
All
's
shut
up
at
*NL*
Thrushcross
Grange
.
You
should
have
given
us
notice
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
arranged
to
be
accommodated
there
,
for
as
long
as
I
shall
stay
,
'
I
*NL*
answered
.
'
I
depart
again
to-morrow
.
And
how
are
you
transplanted
here
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Dean
?
tell
me
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Zillah
left
,
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
wished
me
to
come
,
soon
after
you
went
*NL*
to
London
,
and
stay
till
you
returned
.
But
,
step
in
,
pray
!
Have
you
*NL*
walked
from
Gimmerton
this
evening
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
From
the
Grange
,
'
I
replied
;
`
and
while
they
make
me
lodging
room
there
,
*NL*
I
want
to
finish
my
business
with
your
master
;
because
I
do
n't
think
of
*NL*
having
another
opportunity
in
a
hurry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
business
,
sir
?
'
said
Nelly
,
conducting
me
into
the
house
.
`
He
's
*NL*
gone
out
at
present
,
and
wo
n't
return
soon
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
the
rent
,
'
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
then
it
is
with
Mrs.
Heathcliff
you
must
settle
,
'
she
observed
;
`
or
*NL*
rather
with
me
.
She
has
not
learnt
to
manage
her
affairs
yet
,
and
I
act
*NL*
for
her
:
there
's
nobody
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
!
you
have
not
heard
of
Heathcliff
's
death
,
I
see
,
'
she
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Heathcliff
dead
!
'
I
exclaimed
,
astonished
.
`
How
long
ago
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Three
months
since
:
but
sit
down
,
and
let
me
take
your
hat
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
all
about
it
.
Stop
,
you
have
had
nothing
to
eat
,
have
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
want
nothing
:
I
have
ordered
supper
at
home
.
You
sit
down
too
.
I
*NL*
never
dreamt
of
his
dying
!
Let
me
hear
how
it
came
to
pass
.
You
say
you
*NL*
do
n't
expect
them
back
for
some
time
--
the
young
people
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
--
I
have
to
scold
them
every
evening
for
their
late
rambles
:
but
they
*NL*
do
n't
care
for
me
.
At
least
,
have
a
drink
of
our
old
ale
;
it
will
do
you
*NL*
good
:
you
seem
weary
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastened
to
fetch
it
before
I
could
refuse
,
and
I
heard
Joseph
asking
*NL*
whether
`
it
war
n't
a
crying
scandal
that
she
should
have
followers
at
her
*NL*
time
of
life
?
And
then
,
to
get
them
jocks
out
o
'
t
'
maister
's
cellar
!
He
*NL*
fair
shaamed
to
`
bide
still
and
see
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
stay
to
retaliate
,
but
re-entered
in
a
minute
,
bearing
a
*NL*
reaming
silver
pint
,
whose
contents
I
lauded
with
becoming
earnestness
.
*NL*
And
afterwards
she
furnished
me
with
the
sequel
of
Heathcliff
's
history
.
*NL*
He
had
a
`
queer
'
end
,
as
she
expressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
summoned
to
Wuthering
Heights
,
within
a
fortnight
of
your
leaving
*NL*
us
,
she
said
;
and
I
obeyed
joyfully
,
for
Catherine
's
sake
.
My
first
*NL*
interview
with
her
grieved
and
shocked
me
:
she
had
altered
so
much
since
*NL*
our
separation
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
did
not
explain
his
reasons
for
taking
a
*NL*
new
mind
about
my
coming
here
;
he
only
told
me
he
wanted
me
,
and
he
was
*NL*
tired
of
seeing
Catherine
:
I
must
make
the
little
parlour
my
*NL*
sitting-room
,
and
keep
her
with
me
.
It
was
enough
if
he
were
obliged
to
*NL*
see
her
once
or
twice
a
day
.
She
seemed
pleased
at
this
arrangement
;
and
,
*NL*
by
degrees
,
I
smuggled
over
a
great
number
of
books
,
and
other
articles
,
*NL*
that
had
formed
her
amusement
at
the
Grange
;
and
flattered
myself
we
*NL*
should
get
on
in
tolerable
comfort
.
The
delusion
did
not
last
long
.
*NL*
Catherine
,
contented
at
first
,
in
a
brief
space
grew
irritable
and
*NL*
restless
.
For
one
thing
,
she
was
forbidden
to
move
out
of
the
garden
,
and
*NL*
it
fretted
her
sadly
to
be
confined
to
its
narrow
bounds
as
spring
drew
*NL*
on
;
for
another
,
in
following
the
house
,
I
was
forced
to
quit
her
*NL*
frequently
,
and
she
complained
of
loneliness
:
she
preferred
quarrelling
*NL*
with
Joseph
in
the
kitchen
to
sitting
at
peace
in
her
solitude
.
I
did
*NL*
not
mind
their
skirmishes
:
but
Hareton
was
often
obliged
to
seek
the
*NL*
kitchen
also
,
when
the
master
wanted
to
have
the
house
to
himself
!
and
*NL*
though
in
the
beginning
she
either
left
it
at
his
approach
,
or
quietly
*NL*
joined
in
my
occupations
,
and
shunned
remarking
or
addressing
him
--
and
*NL*
though
he
was
always
as
sullen
and
silent
as
possible
--
after
a
while
,
she
*NL*
changed
her
behaviour
,
and
became
incapable
of
letting
him
alone
:
talking
*NL*
at
him
;
commenting
on
his
stupidity
and
idleness
;
expressing
her
wonder
*NL*
how
he
could
endure
the
life
he
lived
--
how
he
could
sit
a
whole
evening
*NL*
staring
into
the
fire
,
and
dozing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
just
like
a
dog
,
is
he
not
,
Ellen
?
'
she
once
observed
,
`
or
a
*NL*
cart-horse
?
He
does
his
work
,
eats
his
food
,
and
sleeps
eternally
!
What
*NL*
a
blank
,
dreary
mind
he
must
have
!
Do
you
ever
dream
,
Hareton
?
And
,
if
*NL*
you
do
,
what
is
it
about
?
But
you
ca
n't
speak
to
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
at
him
;
but
he
would
neither
open
his
mouth
nor
look
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
,
perhaps
,
dreaming
now
,
'
she
continued
.
`
He
twitched
his
shoulder
*NL*
as
Juno
twitches
hers
.
Ask
him
,
Ellen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Hareton
will
ask
the
master
to
send
you
up-stairs
,
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
behave
!
'
I
said
.
He
had
not
only
twitched
his
shoulder
but
clenched
his
*NL*
fist
,
as
if
tempted
to
use
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
why
Hareton
never
speaks
,
when
I
am
in
the
kitchen
,
'
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
on
another
occasion
.
`
He
is
afraid
I
shall
laugh
at
him
.
*NL*
Ellen
,
what
do
you
think
?
He
began
to
teach
himself
to
read
once
;
and
,
*NL*
because
I
laughed
,
he
burned
his
books
,
and
dropped
it
:
was
he
not
a
*NL*
fool
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Were
not
you
naughty
?
'
I
said
;
`
answer
me
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
I
was
,
'
she
went
on
;
`
but
I
did
not
expect
him
to
be
so
silly
.
*NL*
Hareton
,
if
I
gave
you
a
book
,
would
you
take
it
now
?
I
'll
try
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
placed
one
she
had
been
perusing
on
his
hand
;
he
flung
it
off
,
and
*NL*
muttered
,
if
she
did
not
give
over
,
he
would
break
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
shall
put
it
here
,
'
she
said
,
`
in
the
table-drawer
;
and
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
whispered
me
to
watch
whether
he
touched
it
,
and
departed
.
But
*NL*
he
would
not
come
near
it
;
and
so
I
informed
her
in
the
morning
,
to
her
*NL*
great
disappointment
.
I
saw
she
was
sorry
for
his
persevering
sulkiness
*NL*
and
indolence
:
her
conscience
reproved
her
for
frightening
him
off
*NL*
improving
himself
:
she
had
done
it
effectually
.
But
her
ingenuity
was
at
*NL*
work
to
remedy
the
injury
:
while
I
ironed
,
or
pursued
other
such
*NL*
stationary
employments
as
I
could
not
well
do
in
the
parlour
,
she
would
*NL*
bring
some
pleasant
volume
and
read
it
aloud
to
me
.
When
Hareton
was
*NL*
there
,
she
generally
paused
in
an
interesting
part
,
and
left
the
book
*NL*
lying
about
:
that
she
did
repeatedly
;
but
he
was
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
,
*NL*
and
,
instead
of
snatching
at
her
bait
,
in
wet
weather
he
took
to
smoking
*NL*
with
Joseph
;
and
they
sat
like
automatons
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
fire
,
*NL*
the
elder
happily
too
deaf
to
understand
her
wicked
nonsense
,
as
he
would
*NL*
have
called
it
,
the
younger
doing
his
best
to
seem
to
disregard
it
.
On
*NL*
fine
evenings
the
latter
followed
his
shooting
expeditions
,
and
Catherine
*NL*
yawned
and
sighed
,
and
teased
me
to
talk
to
her
,
and
ran
off
into
the
*NL*
court
or
garden
the
moment
I
began
;
and
,
as
a
last
resource
,
cried
,
and
*NL*
said
she
was
tired
of
living
:
her
life
was
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
who
grew
more
and
more
disinclined
to
society
,
had
almost
*NL*
banished
Earnshaw
from
his
apartment
.
Owing
to
an
accident
at
the
*NL*
commencement
of
March
,
he
became
for
some
days
a
fixture
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
His
gun
burst
while
out
on
the
hills
by
himself
;
a
splinter
cut
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
he
lost
a
good
deal
of
blood
before
he
could
reach
home
.
The
*NL*
consequence
was
that
,
perforce
,
he
was
condemned
to
the
fireside
and
*NL*
tranquillity
,
till
he
made
it
up
again
.
It
suited
Catherine
to
have
him
*NL*
there
:
at
any
rate
,
it
made
her
hate
her
room
up-stairs
more
than
ever
:
*NL*
and
she
would
compel
me
to
find
out
business
below
,
that
she
might
*NL*
accompany
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Easter
Monday
,
Joseph
went
to
Gimmerton
fair
with
some
cattle
;
and
,
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
I
was
busy
getting
up
linen
in
the
kitchen
.
Earnshaw
sat
,
*NL*
morose
as
usual
,
at
the
chimney
corner
,
and
my
little
mistress
was
*NL*
beguiling
an
idle
hour
with
drawing
pictures
on
the
window-panes
,
varying
*NL*
her
amusement
by
smothered
bursts
of
songs
,
and
whispered
ejaculations
,
*NL*
and
quick
glances
of
annoyance
and
impatience
in
the
direction
of
her
*NL*
cousin
,
who
steadfastly
smoked
,
and
looked
into
the
grate
.
At
a
notice
*NL*
that
I
could
do
with
her
no
longer
intercepting
my
light
,
she
removed
to
*NL*
the
hearthstone
.
I
bestowed
little
attention
on
her
proceedings
,
but
,
*NL*
presently
,
I
heard
her
begin
--
`
I
've
found
out
,
Hareton
,
that
I
want
--
that
*NL*
I
'm
glad
--
that
I
should
like
you
to
be
my
cousin
now
,
if
you
had
not
*NL*
grown
so
cross
to
me
,
and
so
rough
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hareton
,
Hareton
,
Hareton
!
do
you
hear
?
'
she
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Get
off
wi
'
ye
!
'
he
growled
,
with
uncompromising
gruffness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
me
take
that
pipe
,
'
she
said
,
cautiously
advancing
her
hand
and
*NL*
abstracting
it
from
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
could
attempt
to
recover
it
,
it
was
broken
,
and
behind
the
*NL*
fire
.
He
swore
at
her
and
seized
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stop
,
'
she
cried
,
`
you
must
listen
to
me
first
;
and
I
ca
n't
speak
while
*NL*
those
clouds
are
floating
in
my
face
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
go
to
the
devil
!
'
he
exclaimed
,
ferociously
,
`
and
let
me
be
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
she
persisted
,
'
I
wo
n't
:
I
ca
n't
tell
what
to
do
to
make
you
talk
*NL*
to
me
;
and
you
are
determined
not
to
understand
.
When
I
call
you
stupid
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
anything
:
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
despise
you
.
Come
,
you
shall
*NL*
take
notice
of
me
,
Hareton
:
you
are
my
cousin
,
and
you
shall
own
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
have
naught
to
do
wi
'
you
and
your
mucky
pride
,
and
your
damned
*NL*
mocking
tricks
!
'
he
answered
.
`
I
'll
go
to
hell
,
body
and
soul
,
before
I
*NL*
look
sideways
after
you
again
.
Side
out
o
'
t
'
gate
,
now
,
this
minute
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
frowned
,
and
retreated
to
the
window-seat
chewing
her
lip
,
and
*NL*
endeavouring
,
by
humming
an
eccentric
tune
,
to
conceal
a
growing
tendency
*NL*
to
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
be
friends
with
your
cousin
,
Mr.
Hareton
,
'
I
interrupted
,
*NL*
`
since
she
repents
of
her
sauciness
.
It
would
do
you
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
good
:
it
would
make
you
another
man
to
have
her
for
a
companion
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
companion
!
'
he
cried
;
`
when
she
hates
me
,
and
does
not
think
me
fit
to
*NL*
wipe
her
shoon
!
Nay
,
if
it
made
me
a
king
,
I
'd
not
be
scorned
for
*NL*
seeking
her
good-will
any
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
I
who
hate
you
,
it
is
you
who
hate
me
!
'
wept
Cathy
,
no
longer
*NL*
disguising
her
trouble
.
`
You
hate
me
as
much
as
Mr.
Heathcliff
does
,
and
*NL*
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
a
damned
liar
,
'
began
Earnshaw
:
`
why
have
I
made
him
angry
,
by
*NL*
taking
your
part
,
then
,
a
hundred
times
?
and
that
when
you
sneered
at
and
*NL*
despised
me
,
and
--
Go
on
plaguing
me
,
and
I
'll
step
in
yonder
,
and
say
you
*NL*
worried
me
out
of
the
kitchen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
know
you
took
my
part
,
'
she
answered
,
drying
her
eyes
;
`
and
I
*NL*
was
miserable
and
bitter
at
everybody
;
but
now
I
thank
you
,
and
beg
you
*NL*
to
forgive
me
:
what
can
I
do
besides
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
to
the
hearth
,
and
frankly
extended
her
hand
.
He
blackened
*NL*
and
scowled
like
a
thunder-cloud
,
and
kept
his
fists
resolutely
clenched
,
*NL*
and
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
ground
.
Catherine
,
by
instinct
,
must
have
*NL*
divined
it
was
obdurate
perversity
,
and
not
dislike
,
that
prompted
this
*NL*
dogged
conduct
;
for
,
after
remaining
an
instant
undecided
,
she
stooped
*NL*
and
impressed
on
his
cheek
a
gentle
kiss
.
The
little
rogue
thought
I
had
*NL*
not
seen
her
,
and
,
drawing
back
,
she
took
her
former
station
by
the
*NL*
window
,
quite
demurely
.
I
shook
my
head
reprovingly
,
and
then
she
*NL*
blushed
and
whispered
--
`
Well
!
what
should
I
have
done
,
Ellen
?
He
*NL*
would
n't
shake
hands
,
and
he
would
n't
look
:
I
must
show
him
some
way
that
*NL*
I
like
him
--
that
I
want
to
be
friends
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
kiss
convinced
Hareton
,
I
can
not
tell
:
he
was
very
careful
,
*NL*
for
some
minutes
,
that
his
face
should
not
be
seen
,
and
when
he
did
raise
*NL*
it
,
he
was
sadly
puzzled
where
to
turn
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
employed
herself
in
wrapping
a
handsome
book
neatly
in
white
*NL*
paper
,
and
having
tied
it
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
,
and
addressed
it
to
`
Mr.
*NL*
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
'
she
desired
me
to
be
her
ambassadress
,
and
convey
the
*NL*
present
to
its
destined
recipient
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
tell
him
,
if
he
'll
take
it
,
I
'll
come
and
teach
him
to
read
it
*NL*
right
,
'
she
said
;
`
and
,
if
he
refuse
it
,
I
'll
go
upstairs
,
and
never
*NL*
tease
him
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
carried
it
,
and
repeated
the
message
;
anxiously
watched
by
my
employer
.
*NL*
Hareton
would
not
open
his
fingers
,
so
I
laid
it
on
his
knee
.
He
did
not
*NL*
strike
it
off
,
either
.
I
returned
to
my
work
.
Catherine
leaned
her
head
*NL*
and
arms
on
the
table
,
till
she
heard
the
slight
rustle
of
the
covering
*NL*
being
removed
;
then
she
stole
away
,
and
quietly
seated
herself
beside
her
*NL*
cousin
.
He
trembled
,
and
his
face
glowed
:
all
his
rudeness
and
all
his
*NL*
surly
harshness
had
deserted
him
:
he
could
not
summon
courage
,
at
first
,
*NL*
to
utter
a
syllable
in
reply
to
her
questioning
look
,
and
her
murmured
*NL*
petition
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Say
you
forgive
me
,
Hareton
,
do
.
You
can
make
me
so
happy
by
speaking
*NL*
that
little
word
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
muttered
something
inaudible
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
'll
be
my
friend
?
'
added
Catherine
,
interrogatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
you
'll
be
ashamed
of
me
every
day
of
your
life
,
'
he
answered
;
`
and
*NL*
the
more
ashamed
,
the
more
you
know
me
;
and
I
can
not
bide
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
wo
n't
be
my
friend
?
'
she
said
,
smiling
as
sweet
as
honey
,
and
*NL*
creeping
close
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
overheard
no
further
distinguishable
talk
,
but
,
on
looking
round
again
,
*NL*
I
perceived
two
such
radiant
countenances
bent
over
the
page
of
the
*NL*
accepted
book
,
that
I
did
not
doubt
the
treaty
had
been
ratified
on
both
*NL*
sides
;
and
the
enemies
were
,
thenceforth
,
sworn
allies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
work
they
studied
was
full
of
costly
pictures
;
and
those
and
their
*NL*
position
had
charm
enough
to
keep
them
unmoved
till
Joseph
came
home
.
He
,
*NL*
poor
man
,
was
perfectly
aghast
at
the
spectacle
of
Catherine
seated
on
*NL*
the
same
bench
with
Hareton
Earnshaw
,
leaning
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
;
*NL*
and
confounded
at
his
favourite
's
endurance
of
her
proximity
:
it
affected
*NL*
him
too
deeply
to
allow
an
observation
on
the
subject
that
night
.
His
*NL*
emotion
was
only
revealed
by
the
immense
sighs
he
drew
,
as
he
solemnly
*NL*
spread
his
large
Bible
on
the
table
,
and
overlaid
it
with
dirty
*NL*
bank-notes
from
his
pocket-book
,
the
produce
of
the
day
's
transactions
.
*NL*
At
length
he
summoned
Hareton
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tak
'
these
in
to
t
'
maister
,
lad
,
'
he
said
,
`
and
bide
there
.
I
's
gang
*NL*
up
to
my
own
rahm
.
This
hoile
's
neither
mensful
nor
seemly
for
us
:
we
*NL*
mun
side
out
and
seearch
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
Catherine
,
'
I
said
,
`
we
must
``
side
out
''
too
:
I
've
done
my
ironing
.
*NL*
Are
you
ready
to
go
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
eight
o'clock
!
'
she
answered
,
rising
unwillingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hareton
,
I
'll
leave
this
book
upon
the
chimney-piece
,
and
I
'll
bring
*NL*
some
more
to-morrow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ony
books
that
yah
leave
,
I
shall
tak
'
into
th
'
hahse
,
'
said
Joseph
,
*NL*
`
and
it
'll
be
mitch
if
yah
find
'em
agean
;
soa
,
yah
may
plase
yerseln
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Cathy
threatened
that
his
library
should
pay
for
hers
;
and
,
smiling
as
*NL*
she
passed
Hareton
,
went
singing
up-stairs
:
lighter
of
heart
,
I
venture
*NL*
to
say
,
than
ever
she
had
been
under
that
roof
before
;
except
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
during
her
earliest
visits
to
Linton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intimacy
thus
commenced
grew
rapidly
;
though
it
encountered
temporary
*NL*
interruptions
.
Earnshaw
was
not
to
be
civilized
with
a
wish
,
and
my
*NL*
young
lady
was
no
philosopher
,
and
no
paragon
of
patience
;
but
both
their
*NL*
minds
tending
to
the
same
point
--
one
loving
and
desiring
to
esteem
,
and
*NL*
the
other
loving
and
desiring
to
be
esteemed
--
they
contrived
in
the
end
*NL*
to
reach
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
it
was
easy
enough
to
win
Mrs.
Heathcliff
's
heart
.
*NL*
But
now
,
I
'm
glad
you
did
not
try
.
The
crown
of
all
my
wishes
will
be
*NL*
the
union
of
those
two
.
I
shall
envy
no
one
on
their
wedding
day
:
there
*NL*
wo
n't
be
a
happier
woman
than
myself
in
England
!

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
of
that
Monday
,
Earnshaw
being
still
unable
to
follow
his
*NL*
ordinary
employments
,
and
therefore
remaining
about
the
house
,
I
speedily
*NL*
found
it
would
be
impracticable
to
retain
my
charge
beside
me
,
as
*NL*
heretofore
.
She
got
downstairs
before
me
,
and
out
into
the
garden
,
where
*NL*
she
had
seen
her
cousin
performing
some
easy
work
;
and
when
I
went
to
bid
*NL*
them
come
to
breakfast
,
I
saw
she
had
persuaded
him
to
clear
a
large
*NL*
space
of
ground
from
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
,
and
they
were
busy
*NL*
planning
together
an
importation
of
plants
from
the
Grange
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
terrified
at
the
devastation
which
had
been
accomplished
in
a
brief
*NL*
half-hour
;
the
black-currant
trees
were
the
apple
of
Joseph
's
eye
,
and
*NL*
she
had
just
fixed
her
choice
of
a
flower-bed
in
the
midst
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
That
will
be
all
shown
to
the
master
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
`
the
minute
*NL*
it
is
discovered
.
And
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
for
taking
such
*NL*
liberties
with
the
garden
?
We
shall
have
a
fine
explosion
on
the
head
of
*NL*
it
:
see
if
we
do
n't
!
Mr.
Hareton
,
I
wonder
you
should
have
no
more
wit
*NL*
than
to
go
and
make
that
mess
at
her
bidding
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
forgotten
they
were
Joseph
's
,
'
answered
Earnshaw
,
rather
puzzled
;
*NL*
`
but
I
'll
tell
him
I
did
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
We
always
ate
our
meals
with
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
I
held
the
mistress
's
post
*NL*
in
making
tea
and
carving
;
so
I
was
indispensable
at
table
.
Catherine
*NL*
usually
sat
by
me
,
but
to-day
she
stole
nearer
to
Hareton
;
and
I
*NL*
presently
saw
she
would
have
no
more
discretion
in
her
friendship
than
*NL*
she
had
in
her
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
mind
you
do
n't
talk
with
and
notice
your
cousin
too
much
,
'
were
my
*NL*
whispered
instructions
as
we
entered
the
room
.
`
It
will
certainly
annoy
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
and
he
'll
be
mad
at
you
both
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
going
to
,
'
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minute
after
,
she
had
sidled
to
him
,
and
was
sticking
primroses
in
*NL*
his
plate
of
porridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dared
not
speak
to
her
there
:
he
dared
hardly
look
;
and
yet
she
went
*NL*
on
teasing
,
till
he
was
twice
on
the
point
of
being
provoked
to
laugh
.
I
*NL*
frowned
,
and
then
she
glanced
towards
the
master
:
whose
mind
was
occupied
*NL*
on
other
subjects
than
his
company
,
as
his
countenance
evinced
;
and
she
*NL*
grew
serious
for
an
instant
,
scrutinizing
him
with
deep
gravity
.
*NL*
Afterwards
she
turned
,
and
recommenced
her
nonsense
;
at
last
,
Hareton
*NL*
uttered
a
smothered
laugh
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
started
;
his
eye
rapidly
*NL*
surveyed
our
faces
,
Catherine
met
it
with
her
accustomed
look
of
*NL*
nervousness
and
yet
defiance
,
which
he
abhorred
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
well
you
are
out
of
my
reach
,
'
he
exclaimed
.
`
What
fiend
*NL*
possesses
you
to
stare
back
at
me
,
continually
,
with
those
infernal
eyes
?
*NL*
Down
with
them
!
and
do
n't
remind
me
of
your
existence
again
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
had
cured
you
of
laughing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
me
,
'
muttered
Hareton
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
say
?
'
demanded
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
looked
at
his
plate
,
and
did
not
repeat
the
confession
.
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
looked
at
him
a
bit
,
and
then
silently
resumed
his
breakfast
*NL*
and
his
interrupted
musing
.
We
had
nearly
finished
,
and
the
two
young
*NL*
people
prudently
shifted
wider
asunder
,
so
I
anticipated
no
further
*NL*
disturbance
during
that
sitting
:
when
Joseph
appeared
at
the
door
,
*NL*
revealing
by
his
quivering
lip
and
furious
eyes
that
the
outrage
*NL*
committed
on
his
precious
shrubs
was
detected
.
He
must
have
seen
Cathy
*NL*
and
her
cousin
about
the
spot
before
he
examined
it
,
for
while
his
jaws
*NL*
worked
like
those
of
a
cow
chewing
its
cud
,
and
rendered
his
speech
*NL*
difficult
to
understand
,
he
began
:

Heathcliff
,
`

!
What

?
I

in

*NL*

answered
Joseph
.
'
I

Thank

*NL*
It

and

--
till
--
Nay

brusts
my

!
He
's
*NL*
forgotten
all
I
've
done
for
him
,
and
made
on
him
,
and
goan
and
riven
up
a
*NL*
whole
row
o
'
t
'
grandest
currant-trees
i
'
t
'
garden
!
'
and
here
he
*NL*
lamented
outright
;
unmanned
by
a
sense
of
his
bitter
injuries
,
and
*NL*
Earnshaw
's
ingratitude
and
dangerous
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
the
fool
drunk
?
'
asked
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
`
Hareton
,
is
it
you
he
's
*NL*
finding
fault
with
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
pulled
up
two
or
three
bushes
,
'
replied
the
young
man
;
`
but
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
set
'em
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
why
have
you
pulled
them
up
?
'
said
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catherine
wisely
put
in
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
wanted
to
plant
some
flowers
there
,
'
she
cried
.
`
I
'm
the
only
person
*NL*
to
blame
,
for
I
wished
him
to
do
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
who
the
devil
gave
_
you
_
leave
to
touch
a
stick
about
the
place
?
'
*NL*
demanded
her
father-in-law
,
much
surprised
.
`
And
who
ordered
_
you
_
to
*NL*
obey
her
?
'
he
added
,
turning
to
Hareton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
speechless
;
his
cousin
replied
--
`
You
should
n't
grudge
a
*NL*
few
yards
of
earth
for
me
to
ornament
,
when
you
have
taken
all
my
land
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
land
,
insolent
slut
!
You
never
had
any
,
'
said
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
my
money
,
'
she
continued
;
returning
his
angry
glare
,
and
meantime
*NL*
biting
a
piece
of
crust
,
the
remnant
of
her
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Silence
!
'
he
exclaimed
.
`
Get
done
,
and
begone
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
Hareton
's
land
,
and
his
money
,
'
pursued
the
reckless
thing
.
`
Hareton
*NL*
and
I
are
friends
now
;
and
I
shall
tell
him
all
about
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
seemed
confounded
a
moment
:
he
grew
pale
,
and
rose
up
,
eyeing
*NL*
her
all
the
while
,
with
an
expression
of
mortal
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
strike
me
,
Hareton
will
strike
you
,
'
she
said
;
`
so
you
may
as
*NL*
well
sit
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
Hareton
does
not
turn
you
out
of
the
room
,
I
'll
strike
him
to
hell
,
'
*NL*
thundered
Heathcliff
.
`
Damnable
witch
!
dare
you
pretend
to
rouse
him
*NL*
against
me
?
Off
with
her
!
Do
you
hear
?
Fling
her
into
the
kitchen
!
*NL*
I
'll
kill
her
,
Ellen
Dean
,
if
you
let
her
come
into
my
sight
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hareton
tried
,
under
his
breath
,
to
persuade
her
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Drag
her
away
!
'
he
cried
,
savagely
.
`
Are
you
staying
to
talk
?
'
And
he
*NL*
approached
to
execute
his
own
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
'll
not
obey
you
,
wicked
man
,
any
more
,
'
said
Catherine
;
`
and
he
'll
*NL*
soon
detest
you
as
much
as
I
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wisht
!
wisht
!
'
muttered
the
young
man
,
reproachfully
;
'
I
will
not
hear
*NL*
you
speak
so
to
him
.
Have
done
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
wo
n't
let
him
strike
me
?
'
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
then
,
'
he
whispered
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
late
:
Heathcliff
had
caught
hold
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
_
you
_
go
!
'
he
said
to
Earnshaw
.
`
Accursed
witch
!
this
time
she
has
*NL*
provoked
me
when
I
could
not
bear
it
;
and
I
'll
make
her
repent
it
for
*NL*
ever
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
his
hand
in
her
hair
;
Hareton
attempted
to
release
her
locks
,
*NL*
entreating
him
not
to
hurt
her
that
once
.
Heathcliff
's
black
eyes
*NL*
flashed
;
he
seemed
ready
to
tear
Catherine
in
pieces
,
and
I
was
just
*NL*
worked
up
to
risk
coming
to
the
rescue
,
when
of
a
sudden
his
fingers
*NL*
relaxed
;
he
shifted
his
grasp
from
her
head
to
her
arm
,
and
gazed
*NL*
intently
in
her
face
.
Then
he
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
,
stood
a
*NL*
moment
to
collect
himself
apparently
,
and
turning
anew
to
Catherine
,
*NL*
said
,
with
assumed
calmness
--
`
You
must
learn
to
avoid
putting
me
in
a
*NL*
passion
,
or
I
shall
really
murder
you
some
time
!
Go
with
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
*NL*
keep
with
her
;
and
confine
your
insolence
to
her
ears
.
As
to
Hareton
*NL*
Earnshaw
,
if
I
see
him
listen
to
you
,
I
'll
send
him
seeking
his
bread
*NL*
where
he
can
get
it
!
Your
love
will
make
him
an
outcast
and
a
beggar
.
*NL*
Nelly
,
take
her
;
and
leave
me
,
all
of
you
!
Leave
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
led
my
young
lady
out
:
she
was
too
glad
of
her
escape
to
resist
;
the
*NL*
other
followed
,
and
Mr.
Heathcliff
had
the
room
to
himself
till
dinner
.
I
*NL*
had
counselled
Catherine
to
dine
up-stairs
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
perceived
*NL*
her
vacant
seat
,
he
sent
me
to
call
her
.
He
spoke
to
none
of
us
,
ate
*NL*
very
little
,
and
went
out
directly
afterwards
,
intimating
that
he
should
*NL*
not
return
before
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
new
friends
established
themselves
in
the
house
during
his
*NL*
absence
;
where
I
heard
Hareton
sternly
check
his
cousin
,
on
her
offering
*NL*
a
revelation
of
her
father-in-law
's
conduct
to
his
father
.
He
said
he
*NL*
would
n't
suffer
a
word
to
be
uttered
in
his
disparagement
:
if
he
were
the
*NL*
devil
,
it
did
n't
signify
;
he
would
stand
by
him
;
and
he
'd
rather
she
*NL*
would
abuse
himself
,
as
she
used
to
,
than
begin
on
Mr.
Heathcliff
.
*NL*
Catherine
was
waxing
cross
at
this
;
but
he
found
means
to
make
her
hold
*NL*
her
tongue
,
by
asking
how
she
would
like
_
him
_
to
speak
ill
of
her
*NL*
father
?
Then
she
comprehended
that
Earnshaw
took
the
master
's
reputation
*NL*
home
to
himself
;
and
was
attached
by
ties
stronger
than
reason
could
*NL*
break
--
chains
,
forged
by
habit
,
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
attempt
to
*NL*
loosen
.
She
showed
a
good
heart
,
thenceforth
,
in
avoiding
both
*NL*
complaints
and
expressions
of
antipathy
concerning
Heathcliff
;
and
*NL*
confessed
to
me
her
sorrow
that
she
had
endeavoured
to
raise
a
bad
spirit
*NL*
between
him
and
Hareton
:
indeed
,
I
do
n't
believe
she
has
ever
breathed
a
*NL*
syllable
,
in
the
latter
's
hearing
,
against
her
oppressor
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
slight
disagreement
was
over
,
they
were
friends
again
,
and
as
*NL*
busy
as
possible
in
their
several
occupations
of
pupil
and
teacher
.
I
*NL*
came
in
to
sit
with
them
,
after
I
had
done
my
work
;
and
I
felt
so
soothed
*NL*
and
comforted
to
watch
them
,
that
I
did
not
notice
how
time
got
on
.
You
*NL*
know
,
they
both
appeared
in
a
measure
my
children
:
I
had
long
been
proud
*NL*
of
one
;
and
now
,
I
was
sure
,
the
other
would
be
a
source
of
equal
*NL*
satisfaction
.
His
honest
,
warm
,
and
intelligent
nature
shook
off
rapidly
*NL*
the
clouds
of
ignorance
and
degradation
in
which
it
had
been
bred
;
and
*NL*
Catherine
's
sincere
commendations
acted
as
a
spur
to
his
industry
.
His
*NL*
brightening
mind
brightened
his
features
,
and
added
spirit
and
nobility
*NL*
to
their
aspect
:
I
could
hardly
fancy
it
the
same
individual
I
had
beheld
*NL*
on
the
day
I
discovered
my
little
lady
at
Wuthering
Heights
,
after
her
*NL*
expedition
to
the
Crags
.
While
I
admired
and
they
laboured
,
dusk
drew
*NL*
on
,
and
with
it
returned
the
master
.
He
came
upon
us
quite
unexpectedly
,
*NL*
entering
by
the
front
way
,
and
had
a
full
view
of
the
whole
three
,
ere
we
*NL*
could
raise
our
heads
to
glance
at
him
.
Well
,
I
reflected
,
there
was
*NL*
never
a
pleasanter
,
or
more
harmless
sight
;
and
it
will
be
a
burning
*NL*
shame
to
scold
them
.
The
red
fire-light
glowed
on
their
two
bonny
heads
,
*NL*
and
revealed
their
faces
animated
with
the
eager
interest
of
children
;
*NL*
for
,
though
he
was
twenty-three
and
she
eighteen
,
each
had
so
much
of
*NL*
novelty
to
feel
and
learn
,
that
neither
experienced
nor
evinced
the
*NL*
sentiments
of
sober
disenchanted
maturity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lifted
their
eyes
together
,
to
encounter
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
perhaps
you
*NL*
have
never
remarked
that
their
eyes
are
precisely
similar
,
and
they
are
*NL*
those
of
Catherine
Earnshaw
.
The
present
Catherine
has
no
other
likeness
*NL*
to
her
,
except
a
breadth
of
forehead
,
and
a
certain
arch
of
the
nostril
*NL*
that
makes
her
appear
rather
haughty
,
whether
she
will
or
not
.
With
*NL*
Hareton
the
resemblance
is
carried
farther
:
it
is
singular
at
all
times
,
*NL*
_
then
_
it
was
particularly
striking
;
because
his
senses
were
alert
,
and
*NL*
his
mental
faculties
wakened
to
unwonted
activity
.
I
suppose
this
*NL*
resemblance
disarmed
Mr.
Heathcliff
:
he
walked
to
the
hearth
in
evident
*NL*
agitation
;
but
it
quickly
subsided
as
he
looked
at
the
young
man
:
or
,
I
*NL*
should
say
,
altered
its
character
;
for
it
was
there
yet
.
He
took
the
*NL*
book
from
his
hand
,
and
glanced
at
the
open
page
,
then
returned
it
*NL*
without
any
observation
;
merely
signing
Catherine
away
:
her
companion
*NL*
lingered
very
little
behind
her
,
and
I
was
about
to
depart
also
,
but
he
*NL*
bid
me
sit
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
a
poor
conclusion
,
is
it
not
?
'
he
observed
,
having
brooded
awhile
*NL*
on
the
scene
he
had
just
witnessed
:
`
an
absurd
termination
to
my
violent
*NL*
exertions
?
I
get
levers
and
mattocks
to
demolish
the
two
houses
,
and
*NL*
train
myself
to
be
capable
of
working
like
Hercules
,
and
when
everything
*NL*
is
ready
and
in
my
power
,
I
find
the
will
to
lift
a
slate
off
either
roof
*NL*
has
vanished
!
My
old
enemies
have
not
beaten
me
;
now
would
be
the
*NL*
precise
time
to
revenge
myself
on
their
representatives
:
I
could
do
it
;
*NL*
and
none
could
hinder
me
.
But
where
is
the
use
?
I
do
n't
care
for
*NL*
striking
:
I
ca
n't
take
the
trouble
to
raise
my
hand
!
That
sounds
as
if
I
*NL*
had
been
labouring
the
whole
time
only
to
exhibit
a
fine
trait
of
*NL*
magnanimity
.
It
is
far
from
being
the
case
:
I
have
lost
the
faculty
of
*NL*
enjoying
their
destruction
,
and
I
am
too
idle
to
destroy
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nelly
,
there
is
a
strange
change
approaching
;
I
'm
in
its
shadow
at
*NL*
present
.
I
take
so
little
interest
in
my
daily
life
that
I
hardly
*NL*
remember
to
eat
and
drink
.
Those
two
who
have
left
the
room
are
the
only
*NL*
objects
which
retain
a
distinct
material
appearance
to
me
;
and
that
*NL*
appearance
causes
me
pain
,
amounting
to
agony
.
About
_
her
_
I
wo
n't
*NL*
speak
;
and
I
do
n't
desire
to
think
;
but
I
earnestly
wish
she
were
*NL*
invisible
:
her
presence
invokes
only
maddening
sensations
.
_
He
_
moves
me
*NL*
differently
:
and
yet
if
I
could
do
it
without
seeming
insane
,
I
'd
never
*NL*
see
him
again
!
You
'll
perhaps
think
me
rather
inclined
to
become
so
,
'
he
*NL*
added
,
making
an
effort
to
smile
,
`
if
I
try
to
describe
the
thousand
*NL*
forms
of
past
associations
and
ideas
he
awakens
or
embodies
.
But
you
'll
*NL*
not
talk
of
what
I
tell
you
;
and
my
mind
is
so
eternally
secluded
in
*NL*
itself
,
it
is
tempting
at
last
to
turn
it
out
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Five
minutes
ago
Hareton
seemed
a
personification
of
my
youth
,
not
a
*NL*
human
being
;
I
felt
to
him
in
such
a
variety
of
ways
,
that
it
would
have
*NL*
been
impossible
to
have
accosted
him
rationally
.
In
the
first
place
,
his
*NL*
startling
likeness
to
Catherine
connected
him
fearfully
with
her
.
That
,
*NL*
however
,
which
you
may
suppose
the
most
potent
to
arrest
my
imagination
,
*NL*
is
actually
the
least
:
for
what
is
not
connected
with
her
to
me
?
and
what
*NL*
does
not
recall
her
?
I
can
not
look
down
to
this
floor
,
but
her
features
*NL*
are
shaped
in
the
flags
!
In
every
cloud
,
in
every
tree
--
filling
the
air
*NL*
at
night
,
and
caught
by
glimpses
in
every
object
by
day
--
I
am
surrounded
*NL*
with
her
image
!
The
most
ordinary
faces
of
men
and
women
--
my
own
*NL*
features
--
mock
me
with
a
resemblance
.
The
entire
world
is
a
dreadful
*NL*
collection
of
memoranda
that
she
did
exist
,
and
that
I
have
lost
her
!
*NL*
Well
,
Hareton
's
aspect
was
the
ghost
of
my
immortal
love
;
of
my
wild
*NL*
endeavours
to
hold
my
right
;
my
degradation
,
my
pride
,
my
happiness
,
and
*NL*
my
anguish
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
is
frenzy
to
repeat
these
thoughts
to
you
:
only
it
will
let
you
*NL*
know
why
,
with
a
reluctance
to
be
always
alone
,
his
society
is
no
*NL*
benefit
;
rather
an
aggravation
of
the
constant
torment
I
suffer
:
and
it
*NL*
partly
contributes
to
render
me
regardless
how
he
and
his
cousin
go
on
*NL*
together
.
I
can
give
them
no
attention
any
more
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
what
do
you
mean
by
a
_
change
_
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
'
I
said
,
alarmed
at
*NL*
his
manner
:
though
he
was
neither
in
danger
of
losing
his
senses
,
nor
*NL*
dying
,
according
to
my
judgment
:
he
was
quite
strong
and
healthy
;
and
,
as
*NL*
to
his
reason
,
from
childhood
he
had
a
delight
in
dwelling
on
dark
*NL*
things
,
and
entertaining
odd
fancies
.
He
might
have
had
a
monomania
on
*NL*
the
subject
of
his
departed
idol
;
but
on
every
other
point
his
wits
were
*NL*
as
sound
as
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
not
know
that
till
it
comes
,
'
he
said
;
`
I
'm
only
half
conscious
*NL*
of
it
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
no
feeling
of
illness
,
have
you
?
'
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Nelly
,
I
have
not
,
'
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
are
not
afraid
of
death
?
'
I
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Afraid
?
No
!
'
he
replied
.
'
I
have
neither
a
fear
,
nor
a
presentiment
,
*NL*
nor
a
hope
of
death
.
Why
should
I
?
With
my
hard
constitution
and
*NL*
temperate
mode
of
living
,
and
unperilous
occupations
,
I
ought
to
,
and
*NL*
probably
_
shall
_
,
remain
above
ground
till
there
is
scarcely
a
black
hair
*NL*
on
my
head
.
And
yet
I
can
not
continue
in
this
condition
!
I
have
to
*NL*
remind
myself
to
breathe
--
almost
to
remind
my
heart
to
beat
!
And
it
is
*NL*
like
bending
back
a
stiff
spring
:
it
is
by
compulsion
that
I
do
the
*NL*
slightest
act
not
prompted
by
one
thought
;
and
by
compulsion
that
I
*NL*
notice
anything
alive
or
dead
,
which
is
not
associated
with
one
universal
*NL*
idea
.
I
have
a
single
wish
,
and
my
whole
being
and
faculties
are
*NL*
yearning
to
attain
it
.
They
have
yearned
towards
it
so
long
,
and
so
*NL*
unwaveringly
,
that
I
'm
convinced
it
will
be
reached
--
and
soon
--
because
it
*NL*
has
devoured
my
existence
:
I
am
swallowed
up
in
the
anticipation
of
its
*NL*
fulfilment
.
My
confessions
have
not
relieved
me
;
but
they
may
account
*NL*
for
some
otherwise
unaccountable
phases
of
humour
which
I
show
.
O
God
!
*NL*
It
is
a
long
fight
;
I
wish
it
were
over
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
pace
the
room
,
muttering
terrible
things
to
himself
,
till
I
*NL*
was
inclined
to
believe
,
as
he
said
Joseph
did
,
that
conscience
had
*NL*
turned
his
heart
to
an
earthly
hell
.
I
wondered
greatly
how
it
would
*NL*
end
.
Though
he
seldom
before
had
revealed
this
state
of
mind
,
even
by
*NL*
looks
,
it
was
his
habitual
mood
,
I
had
no
doubt
:
he
asserted
it
himself
;
*NL*
but
not
a
soul
,
from
his
general
bearing
,
would
have
conjectured
the
*NL*
fact
.
You
did
not
when
you
saw
him
,
Mr.
Lockwood
:
and
at
the
period
of
*NL*
which
I
speak
,
he
was
just
the
same
as
then
;
only
fonder
of
continued
*NL*
solitude
,
and
perhaps
still
more
laconic
in
company
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
days
after
that
evening
Mr.
Heathcliff
shunned
meeting
us
at
*NL*
meals
;
yet
he
would
not
consent
formally
to
exclude
Hareton
and
Cathy
.
He
*NL*
had
an
aversion
to
yielding
so
completely
to
his
feelings
,
choosing
*NL*
rather
to
absent
himself
;
and
eating
once
in
twenty-four
hours
seemed
*NL*
sufficient
sustenance
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
after
the
family
were
in
bed
,
I
heard
him
go
downstairs
,
and
*NL*
out
at
the
front
door
.
I
did
not
hear
him
re-enter
,
and
in
the
morning
I
*NL*
found
he
was
still
away
.
We
were
in
April
then
:
the
weather
was
sweet
*NL*
and
warm
,
the
grass
as
green
as
showers
and
sun
could
make
it
,
and
the
*NL*
two
dwarf
apple-trees
near
the
southern
wall
in
full
bloom
.
After
*NL*
breakfast
,
Catherine
insisted
on
my
bringing
a
chair
and
sitting
with
my
*NL*
work
under
the
fir-trees
at
the
end
of
the
house
;
and
she
beguiled
*NL*
Hareton
,
who
had
perfectly
recovered
from
his
accident
,
to
dig
and
*NL*
arrange
her
little
garden
,
which
was
shifted
to
that
corner
by
the
*NL*
influence
of
Joseph
's
complaints
.
I
was
comfortably
revelling
in
the
*NL*
spring
fragrance
around
,
and
the
beautiful
soft
blue
overhead
,
when
my
*NL*
young
lady
,
who
had
run
down
near
the
gate
to
procure
some
primrose
roots
*NL*
for
a
border
,
returned
only
half
laden
,
and
informed
us
that
Mr.
*NL*
Heathcliff
was
coming
in
.
`
And
he
spoke
to
me
,
'
she
added
,
with
a
*NL*
perplexed
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
he
say
?
'
asked
Hareton
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
told
me
to
begone
as
fast
as
I
could
,
'
she
answered
.
`
But
he
looked
*NL*
so
different
from
his
usual
look
that
I
stopped
a
moment
to
stare
at
*NL*
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
?
'
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
almost
bright
and
cheerful
.
No
,
_
almost
_
nothing
--
_
very
much
_
*NL*
excited
,
and
wild
,
and
glad
!
'
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Night-walking
amuses
him
,
then
,
'
I
remarked
,
affecting
a
careless
*NL*
manner
:
in
reality
as
surprised
as
she
was
,
and
anxious
to
ascertain
the
*NL*
truth
of
her
statement
;
for
to
see
the
master
looking
glad
would
not
be
*NL*
an
every-day
spectacle
.
I
framed
an
excuse
to
go
in
.
Heathcliff
stood
*NL*
at
the
open
door
;
he
was
pale
,
and
he
trembled
:
yet
,
certainly
,
he
had
a
*NL*
strange
joyful
glitter
in
his
eyes
,
that
altered
the
aspect
of
his
whole
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Will
you
have
some
breakfast
?
'
I
said
.
`
You
must
be
hungry
,
rambling
*NL*
about
all
night
!
'
I
wanted
to
discover
where
he
had
been
,
but
I
did
not
*NL*
like
to
ask
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
'm
not
hungry
,
'
he
answered
,
averting
his
head
,
and
speaking
rather
*NL*
contemptuously
,
as
if
he
guessed
I
was
trying
to
divine
the
occasion
of
*NL*
his
good
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
perplexed
:
I
did
n't
know
whether
it
were
not
a
proper
opportunity
*NL*
to
offer
a
bit
of
admonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
it
right
to
wander
out
of
doors
,
'
I
observed
,
`
instead
of
*NL*
being
in
bed
:
it
is
not
wise
,
at
any
rate
this
moist
season
.
I
daresay
*NL*
you
'll
catch
a
bad
cold
or
a
fever
:
you
have
something
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
but
what
I
can
bear
,
'
he
replied
;
`
and
with
the
greatest
*NL*
pleasure
,
provided
you
'll
leave
me
alone
:
get
in
,
and
do
n't
annoy
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
obeyed
:
and
,
in
passing
,
I
noticed
he
breathed
as
fast
as
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
!
'
I
reflected
to
myself
,
`
we
shall
have
a
fit
of
illness
.
I
can
not
*NL*
conceive
what
he
has
been
doing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
That
noon
he
sat
down
to
dinner
with
us
,
and
received
a
heaped-up
plate
*NL*
from
my
hands
,
as
if
he
intended
to
make
amends
for
previous
fasting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
neither
cold
nor
fever
,
Nelly
,
'
he
remarked
,
in
allusion
to
my
*NL*
morning
's
speech
;
`
and
I
'm
ready
to
do
justice
to
the
food
you
give
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
was
going
to
commence
eating
,
when
the
*NL*
inclination
appeared
to
become
suddenly
extinct
.
He
laid
them
on
the
*NL*
table
,
looked
eagerly
towards
the
window
,
then
rose
and
went
out
.
We
saw
*NL*
him
walking
to
and
fro
in
the
garden
while
we
concluded
our
meal
,
and
*NL*
Earnshaw
said
he
'd
go
and
ask
why
he
would
not
dine
:
he
thought
we
had
*NL*
grieved
him
some
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
is
he
coming
?
'
cried
Catherine
,
when
her
cousin
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nay
,
'
he
answered
;
`
but
he
's
not
angry
:
he
seemed
rarely
pleased
indeed
;
*NL*
only
I
made
him
impatient
by
speaking
to
him
twice
;
and
then
he
bid
me
be
*NL*
off
to
you
:
he
wondered
how
I
could
want
the
company
of
anybody
else
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
his
plate
to
keep
warm
on
the
fender
;
and
after
an
hour
or
two
he
*NL*
re-entered
,
when
the
room
was
clear
,
in
no
degree
calmer
:
the
same
*NL*
unnatural
--
it
was
unnatural
--
appearance
of
joy
under
his
black
brows
;
the
*NL*
same
bloodless
hue
,
and
his
teeth
visible
,
now
and
then
,
in
a
kind
of
*NL*
smile
;
his
frame
shivering
,
not
as
one
shivers
with
chill
or
weakness
,
*NL*
but
as
a
tight-stretched
cord
vibrates
--
a
strong
thrilling
,
rather
than
*NL*
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
ask
what
is
the
matter
,
I
thought
;
or
who
should
?
And
I
*NL*
exclaimed
--
`
Have
you
heard
any
good
news
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
You
look
*NL*
uncommonly
animated
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
should
good
news
come
from
to
me
?
'
he
said
.
`
I
'm
animated
with
*NL*
hunger
;
and
,
seemingly
,
I
must
not
eat
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
dinner
is
here
,
'
I
returned
;
`
why
wo
n't
you
get
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
want
it
now
,
'
he
muttered
,
hastily
:
`
I
'll
wait
till
supper
.
And
,
*NL*
Nelly
,
once
for
all
,
let
me
beg
you
to
warn
Hareton
and
the
other
away
*NL*
from
me
.
I
wish
to
be
troubled
by
nobody
:
I
wish
to
have
this
place
to
*NL*
myself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
some
new
reason
for
this
banishment
?
'
I
inquired
.
`
Tell
me
why
*NL*
you
are
so
queer
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
?
Where
were
you
last
night
?
I
'm
not
*NL*
putting
the
question
through
idle
curiosity
,
but
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
putting
the
question
through
very
idle
curiosity
,
'
he
*NL*
interrupted
,
with
a
laugh
.
`
Yet
I
'll
answer
it
.
Last
night
I
was
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
hell
.
To-day
,
I
am
within
sight
of
my
heaven
.
I
have
my
*NL*
eyes
on
it
:
hardly
three
feet
to
sever
me
!
And
now
you
'd
better
go
!
*NL*
You
'll
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
to
frighten
you
,
if
you
refrain
from
*NL*
prying
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
swept
the
hearth
and
wiped
the
table
,
I
departed
;
more
perplexed
*NL*
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
quit
the
house
again
that
afternoon
,
and
no
one
intruded
on
*NL*
his
solitude
;
till
,
at
eight
o'clock
,
I
deemed
it
proper
,
though
*NL*
unsummoned
,
to
carry
a
candle
and
his
supper
to
him
.
He
was
leaning
*NL*
against
the
ledge
of
an
open
lattice
,
but
not
looking
out
:
his
face
was
*NL*
turned
to
the
interior
gloom
.
The
fire
had
smouldered
to
ashes
;
the
room
*NL*
was
filled
with
the
damp
,
mild
air
of
the
cloudy
evening
;
and
so
still
,
*NL*
that
not
only
the
murmur
of
the
beck
down
Gimmerton
was
distinguishable
,
*NL*
but
its
ripples
and
its
gurgling
over
the
pebbles
,
or
through
the
large
*NL*
stones
which
it
could
not
cover
.
I
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
discontent
*NL*
at
seeing
the
dismal
grate
,
and
commenced
shutting
the
casements
,
one
*NL*
after
another
,
till
I
came
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Must
I
close
this
?
'
I
asked
,
in
order
to
rouse
him
;
for
he
would
not
*NL*
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
flashed
on
his
features
as
I
spoke
.
Oh
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
I
can
not
*NL*
express
what
a
terrible
start
I
got
by
the
momentary
view
!
Those
deep
*NL*
black
eyes
!
That
smile
,
and
ghastly
paleness
!
It
appeared
to
me
,
not
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
but
a
goblin
;
and
,
in
my
terror
,
I
let
the
candle
bend
*NL*
towards
the
wall
,
and
it
left
me
in
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
close
it
,
'
he
replied
,
in
his
familiar
voice
.
`
There
,
that
is
pure
*NL*
awkwardness
!
Why
did
you
hold
the
candle
horizontally
?
Be
quick
,
and
*NL*
bring
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
hurried
out
in
a
foolish
state
of
dread
,
and
said
to
Joseph
--
`
The
*NL*
master
wishes
you
to
take
him
a
light
and
rekindle
the
fire
.
'
For
I
*NL*
dared
not
go
in
myself
again
just
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
rattled
some
fire
into
the
shovel
,
and
went
:
but
he
brought
it
*NL*
back
immediately
,
with
the
supper-tray
in
his
other
hand
,
explaining
that
*NL*
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
going
to
bed
,
and
he
wanted
nothing
to
eat
till
*NL*
morning
.
We
heard
him
mount
the
stairs
directly
;
he
did
not
proceed
to
*NL*
his
ordinary
chamber
,
but
turned
into
that
with
the
panelled
bed
:
its
*NL*
window
,
as
I
mentioned
before
,
is
wide
enough
for
anybody
to
get
through
;
*NL*
and
it
struck
me
that
he
plotted
another
midnight
excursion
,
of
which
he
*NL*
had
rather
we
had
no
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
he
a
ghoul
or
a
vampire
?
'
I
mused
.
I
had
read
of
such
hideous
*NL*
incarnate
demons
.
And
then
I
set
myself
to
reflect
how
I
had
tended
him
*NL*
in
infancy
,
and
watched
him
grow
to
youth
,
and
followed
him
almost
*NL*
through
his
whole
course
;
and
what
absurd
nonsense
it
was
to
yield
to
*NL*
that
sense
of
horror
.
`
But
where
did
he
come
from
,
the
little
dark
*NL*
thing
,
harboured
by
a
good
man
to
his
bane
?
'
muttered
Superstition
,
as
I
*NL*
dozed
into
unconsciousness
.
And
I
began
,
half
dreaming
,
to
weary
myself
*NL*
with
imagining
some
fit
parentage
for
him
;
and
,
repeating
my
waking
*NL*
meditations
,
I
tracked
his
existence
over
again
,
with
grim
variations
;
at
*NL*
last
,
picturing
his
death
and
funeral
:
of
which
,
all
I
can
remember
is
,
*NL*
being
exceedingly
vexed
at
having
the
task
of
dictating
an
inscription
*NL*
for
his
monument
,
and
consulting
the
sexton
about
it
;
and
,
as
he
had
no
*NL*
surname
,
and
we
could
not
tell
his
age
,
we
were
obliged
to
content
*NL*
ourselves
with
the
single
word
,
`
Heathcliff
.
'
That
came
true
:
we
were
.
*NL*
If
you
enter
the
kirkyard
,
you
'll
read
,
on
his
headstone
,
only
that
,
and
*NL*
the
date
of
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawn
restored
me
to
common
sense
.
I
rose
,
and
went
into
the
garden
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
could
see
,
to
ascertain
if
there
were
any
footmarks
under
his
*NL*
window
.
There
were
none
.
`
He
has
stayed
at
home
,
'
I
thought
,
`
and
he
'll
*NL*
be
all
right
to-day
.
'
I
prepared
breakfast
for
the
household
,
as
was
my
*NL*
usual
custom
,
but
told
Hareton
and
Catherine
to
get
theirs
ere
the
master
*NL*
came
down
,
for
he
lay
late
.
They
preferred
taking
it
out
of
doors
,
under
*NL*
the
trees
,
and
I
set
a
little
table
to
accommodate
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
re-entrance
,
I
found
Mr.
Heathcliff
below
.
He
and
Joseph
were
*NL*
conversing
about
some
farming
business
;
he
gave
clear
,
minute
directions
*NL*
concerning
the
matter
discussed
,
but
he
spoke
rapidly
,
and
turned
his
*NL*
head
continually
aside
,
and
had
the
same
excited
expression
,
even
more
*NL*
exaggerated
.
When
Joseph
quitted
the
room
he
took
his
seat
in
the
place
*NL*
he
generally
chose
,
and
I
put
a
basin
of
coffee
before
him
.
He
drew
it
*NL*
nearer
,
and
then
rested
his
arms
on
the
table
,
and
looked
at
the
opposite
*NL*
wall
,
as
I
supposed
,
surveying
one
particular
portion
,
up
and
down
,
with
*NL*
glittering
,
restless
eyes
,
and
with
such
eager
interest
that
he
stopped
*NL*
breathing
during
half
a
minute
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
now
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
pushing
some
bread
against
his
hand
,
`
eat
and
*NL*
drink
that
,
while
it
is
hot
:
it
has
been
waiting
near
an
hour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
n't
notice
me
,
and
yet
he
smiled
.
I
'd
rather
have
seen
him
gnash
*NL*
his
teeth
than
smile
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mr.
Heathcliff
!
master
!
'
I
cried
,
`
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
stare
as
if
*NL*
you
saw
an
unearthly
vision
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
shout
so
loud
,
'
he
replied
.
`
Turn
round
,
and
*NL*
tell
me
,
are
we
by
ourselves
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
'
was
my
answer
;
`
of
course
we
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
I
involuntarily
obeyed
him
,
as
if
I
was
not
quite
sure
.
With
a
*NL*
sweep
of
his
hand
he
cleared
a
vacant
space
in
front
among
the
breakfast
*NL*
things
,
and
leant
forward
to
gaze
more
at
his
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
perceived
he
was
not
looking
at
the
wall
;
for
when
I
regarded
him
*NL*
alone
,
it
seemed
exactly
that
he
gazed
at
something
within
two
yards
'
*NL*
distance
.
And
whatever
it
was
,
it
communicated
,
apparently
,
both
*NL*
pleasure
and
pain
in
exquisite
extremes
:
at
least
the
anguished
,
yet
*NL*
raptured
,
expression
of
his
countenance
suggested
that
idea
.
The
fancied
*NL*
object
was
not
fixed
,
either
:
his
eyes
pursued
it
with
unwearied
*NL*
diligence
,
and
,
even
in
speaking
to
me
,
were
never
weaned
away
.
I
vainly
*NL*
reminded
him
of
his
protracted
abstinence
from
food
:
if
he
stirred
to
*NL*
touch
anything
in
compliance
with
my
entreaties
,
if
he
stretched
his
hand
*NL*
out
to
get
a
piece
of
bread
,
his
fingers
clenched
before
they
reached
it
,
*NL*
and
remained
on
the
table
,
forgetful
of
their
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
,
a
model
of
patience
,
trying
to
attract
his
absorbed
attention
from
*NL*
its
engrossing
speculation
;
till
he
grew
irritable
,
and
got
up
,
asking
*NL*
why
I
would
not
allow
him
to
have
his
own
time
in
taking
his
meals
?
and
*NL*
saying
that
on
the
next
occasion
I
need
n't
wait
:
I
might
set
the
things
*NL*
down
and
go
.
Having
uttered
these
words
he
left
the
house
,
slowly
*NL*
sauntered
down
the
garden
path
,
and
disappeared
through
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hours
crept
anxiously
by
:
another
evening
came
.
I
did
not
retire
to
*NL*
rest
till
late
,
and
when
I
did
,
I
could
not
sleep
.
He
returned
after
*NL*
midnight
,
and
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
,
shut
himself
into
the
room
*NL*
beneath
.
I
listened
,
and
tossed
about
,
and
,
finally
,
dressed
and
*NL*
descended
.
It
was
too
irksome
to
lie
there
,
harassing
my
brain
with
a
*NL*
hundred
idle
misgivings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
distinguished
Mr.
Heathcliff
's
step
,
restlessly
measuring
the
floor
,
*NL*
and
he
frequently
broke
the
silence
by
a
deep
inspiration
,
resembling
a
*NL*
groan
.
He
muttered
detached
words
also
;
the
only
one
I
could
catch
was
*NL*
the
name
of
Catherine
,
coupled
with
some
wild
term
of
endearment
or
*NL*
suffering
;
and
spoken
as
one
would
speak
to
a
person
present
;
low
and
*NL*
earnest
,
and
wrung
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
.
I
had
not
courage
to
walk
*NL*
straight
into
the
apartment
;
but
I
desired
to
divert
him
from
his
*NL*
reverie
,
and
therefore
fell
foul
of
the
kitchen
fire
,
stirred
it
,
and
*NL*
began
to
scrape
the
cinders
.
It
drew
him
forth
sooner
than
I
expected
.
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
immediately
,
and
said
--
`
Nelly
,
come
here
--
is
it
*NL*
morning
?
Come
in
with
your
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
striking
four
,
'
I
answered
.
`
You
want
a
candle
to
take
up-stairs
:
*NL*
you
might
have
lit
one
at
this
fire
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
go
up-stairs
,
'
he
said
.
`
Come
in
,
and
kindle
_
me
_
a
*NL*
fire
,
and
do
anything
there
is
to
do
about
the
room
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
blow
the
coals
red
first
,
before
I
can
carry
any
,
'
I
replied
,
*NL*
getting
a
chair
and
the
bellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
roamed
to
and
fro
,
meantime
,
in
a
state
approaching
distraction
;
his
*NL*
heavy
sighs
succeeding
each
other
so
thick
as
to
leave
no
space
for
*NL*
common
breathing
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
day
breaks
I
'll
send
for
Green
,
'
he
said
;
'
I
wish
to
make
some
*NL*
legal
inquiries
of
him
while
I
can
bestow
a
thought
on
those
matters
,
and
*NL*
while
I
can
act
calmly
.
I
have
not
written
my
will
yet
;
and
how
to
leave
*NL*
my
property
I
can
not
determine
.
I
wish
I
could
annihilate
it
from
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
would
not
talk
so
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
I
interposed
.
`
Let
your
will
be
a
*NL*
while
:
you
'll
be
spared
to
repent
of
your
many
injustices
yet
!
I
never
*NL*
expected
that
your
nerves
would
be
disordered
:
they
are
,
at
present
,
*NL*
marvellously
so
,
however
;
and
almost
entirely
through
your
own
fault
.
*NL*
The
way
you
've
passed
these
three
last
days
might
knock
up
a
Titan
.
Do
*NL*
take
some
food
,
and
some
repose
.
You
need
only
look
at
yourself
in
a
*NL*
glass
to
see
how
you
require
both
.
Your
cheeks
are
hollow
,
and
your
eyes
*NL*
blood-shot
,
like
a
person
starving
with
hunger
and
going
blind
with
loss
*NL*
of
sleep
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
not
my
fault
that
I
can
not
eat
or
rest
,
'
he
replied
.
'
I
assure
*NL*
you
it
is
through
no
settled
designs
.
I
'll
do
both
,
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
possibly
can
.
But
you
might
as
well
bid
a
man
struggling
in
the
water
*NL*
rest
within
arms
'
length
of
the
shore
!
I
must
reach
it
first
,
and
then
*NL*
I
'll
rest
.
Well
,
never
mind
Mr.
Green
:
as
to
repenting
of
my
injustices
,
*NL*
I
've
done
no
injustice
,
and
I
repent
of
nothing
.
I
'm
too
happy
;
and
yet
*NL*
I
'm
not
happy
enough
.
My
soul
's
bliss
kills
my
body
,
but
does
not
*NL*
satisfy
itself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Happy
,
master
?
'
I
cried
.
`
Strange
happiness
!
If
you
would
hear
me
*NL*
without
being
angry
,
I
might
offer
some
advice
that
would
make
you
*NL*
happier
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
that
?
'
he
asked
.
`
Give
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
aware
,
Mr.
Heathcliff
,
'
I
said
,
`
that
from
the
time
you
were
*NL*
thirteen
years
old
you
have
lived
a
selfish
,
unchristian
life
;
and
*NL*
probably
hardly
had
a
Bible
in
your
hands
during
all
that
period
.
You
*NL*
must
have
forgotten
the
contents
of
the
book
,
and
you
may
not
have
space
*NL*
to
search
it
now
.
Could
it
be
hurtful
to
send
for
some
one
--
some
*NL*
minister
of
any
denomination
,
it
does
not
matter
which
--
to
explain
it
,
*NL*
and
show
you
how
very
far
you
have
erred
from
its
precepts
;
and
how
unfit
*NL*
you
will
be
for
its
heaven
,
unless
a
change
takes
place
before
you
die
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
rather
obliged
than
angry
,
Nelly
,
'
he
said
,
`
for
you
remind
me
of
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
I
desire
to
be
buried
.
It
is
to
be
carried
to
the
*NL*
churchyard
in
the
evening
.
You
and
Hareton
may
,
if
you
please
,
accompany
*NL*
me
:
and
mind
,
particularly
,
to
notice
that
the
sexton
obeys
my
directions
*NL*
concerning
the
two
coffins
!
No
minister
need
come
;
nor
need
anything
be
*NL*
said
over
me
.
--
I
tell
you
I
have
nearly
attained
_
my
_
heaven
;
and
that
of
*NL*
others
is
altogether
unvalued
and
uncoveted
by
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
supposing
you
persevered
in
your
obstinate
fast
,
and
died
by
that
*NL*
means
,
and
they
refused
to
bury
you
in
the
precincts
of
the
kirk
?
'
I
*NL*
said
,
shocked
at
his
godless
indifference
.
`
How
would
you
like
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
wo
n't
do
that
,
'
he
replied
:
`
if
they
did
,
you
must
have
me
removed
*NL*
secretly
;
and
if
you
neglect
it
you
shall
prove
,
practically
,
that
the
*NL*
dead
are
not
annihilated
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
heard
the
other
members
of
the
family
stirring
he
retired
*NL*
to
his
den
,
and
I
breathed
freer
.
But
in
the
afternoon
,
while
Joseph
and
*NL*
Hareton
were
at
their
work
,
he
came
into
the
kitchen
again
,
and
,
with
a
*NL*
wild
look
,
bid
me
come
and
sit
in
the
house
:
he
wanted
somebody
with
him
.
*NL*
I
declined
;
telling
him
plainly
that
his
strange
talk
and
manner
*NL*
frightened
me
,
and
I
had
neither
the
nerve
nor
the
will
to
be
his
*NL*
companion
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
believe
you
think
me
a
fiend
,
'
he
said
,
with
his
dismal
laugh
:
*NL*
`
something
too
horrible
to
live
under
a
decent
roof
.
'
Then
turning
to
*NL*
Catherine
,
who
was
there
,
and
who
drew
behind
me
at
his
approach
,
he
*NL*
added
,
half
sneeringly
,
--
`
Will
_
you
_
come
,
chuck
?
I
'll
not
hurt
you
.
No
!
*NL*
to
you
I
've
made
myself
worse
than
the
devil
.
Well
,
there
is
_
one
_
who
*NL*
wo
n't
shrink
from
my
company
!
By
God
!
she
's
relentless
.
Oh
,
damn
it
!
*NL*
It
's
unutterably
too
much
for
flesh
and
blood
to
bear
--
even
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
solicited
the
society
of
no
one
more
.
At
dusk
he
went
into
his
*NL*
chamber
.
Through
the
whole
night
,
and
far
into
the
morning
,
we
heard
him
*NL*
groaning
and
murmuring
to
himself
.
Hareton
was
anxious
to
enter
;
but
I
*NL*
bid
him
fetch
Mr.
Kenneth
,
and
he
should
go
in
and
see
him
.
When
he
*NL*
came
,
and
I
requested
admittance
and
tried
to
open
the
door
,
I
found
it
*NL*
locked
;
and
Heathcliff
bid
us
be
damned
.
He
was
better
,
and
would
be
*NL*
left
alone
;
so
the
doctor
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
evening
was
very
wet
:
indeed
,
it
poured
down
till
day-dawn
;
*NL*
and
,
as
I
took
my
morning
walk
round
the
house
,
I
observed
the
master
's
*NL*
window
swinging
open
,
and
the
rain
driving
straight
in
.
He
can
not
be
in
*NL*
bed
,
I
thought
:
those
showers
would
drench
him
through
.
He
must
either
*NL*
be
up
or
out
.
But
I
'll
make
no
more
ado
,
I
'll
go
boldly
and
look
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Having
succeeded
in
obtaining
entrance
with
another
key
,
I
ran
to
unclose
*NL*
the
panels
,
for
the
chamber
was
vacant
;
quickly
pushing
them
aside
,
I
*NL*
peeped
in
.
Mr.
Heathcliff
was
there
--
laid
on
his
back
.
His
eyes
met
*NL*
mine
so
keen
and
fierce
,
I
started
;
and
then
he
seemed
to
smile
.
I
could
*NL*
not
think
him
dead
:
but
his
face
and
throat
were
washed
with
rain
;
the
*NL*
bed-clothes
dripped
,
and
he
was
perfectly
still
.
The
lattice
,
flapping
*NL*
to
and
fro
,
had
grazed
one
hand
that
rested
on
the
sill
;
no
blood
*NL*
trickled
from
the
broken
skin
,
and
when
I
put
my
fingers
to
it
,
I
could
*NL*
doubt
no
more
:
he
was
dead
and
stark
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
hasped
the
window
;
I
combed
his
black
long
hair
from
his
forehead
;
I
*NL*
tried
to
close
his
eyes
:
to
extinguish
,
if
possible
,
that
frightful
,
*NL*
life-like
gaze
of
exultation
before
any
one
else
beheld
it
.
They
would
*NL*
not
shut
:
they
seemed
to
sneer
at
my
attempts
;
and
his
parted
lips
and
*NL*
sharp
white
teeth
sneered
too
!
Taken
with
another
fit
of
cowardice
,
I
*NL*
cried
out
for
Joseph
.
Joseph
shuffled
up
and
made
a
noise
,
but
*NL*
resolutely
refused
to
meddle
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Th
'
divil
's
harried
off
his
soul
,
'
he
cried
,
`
and
he
may
hev
'
his
*NL*
carcass
into
t
'
bargin
,
for
aught
I
care
!
Ech
!
what
a
wicked
`
un
he
*NL*
looks
,
girning
at
death
!
'
and
the
old
sinner
grinned
in
mockery
.
I
*NL*
thought
he
intended
to
cut
a
caper
round
the
bed
;
but
suddenly
composing
*NL*
himself
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
raised
his
hands
,
and
returned
thanks
*NL*
that
the
lawful
master
and
the
ancient
stock
were
restored
to
their
*NL*
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
stunned
by
the
awful
event
;
and
my
memory
unavoidably
recurred
to
*NL*
former
times
with
a
sort
of
oppressive
sadness
.
But
poor
Hareton
,
the
*NL*
most
wronged
,
was
the
only
one
who
really
suffered
much
.
He
sat
by
the
*NL*
corpse
all
night
,
weeping
in
bitter
earnest
.
He
pressed
its
hand
,
and
*NL*
kissed
the
sarcastic
,
savage
face
that
every
one
else
shrank
from
*NL*
contemplating
;
and
bemoaned
him
with
that
strong
grief
which
springs
*NL*
naturally
from
a
generous
heart
,
though
it
be
tough
as
tempered
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Kenneth
was
perplexed
to
pronounce
of
what
disorder
the
master
died
.
*NL*
I
concealed
the
fact
of
his
having
swallowed
nothing
for
four
days
,
*NL*
fearing
it
might
lead
to
trouble
,
and
then
,
I
am
persuaded
,
he
did
not
*NL*
abstain
on
purpose
:
it
was
the
consequence
of
his
strange
illness
,
not
*NL*
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
buried
him
,
to
the
scandal
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
as
he
wished
.
*NL*
Earnshaw
and
I
,
the
sexton
,
and
six
men
to
carry
the
coffin
,
comprehended
*NL*
the
whole
attendance
.
The
six
men
departed
when
they
had
let
it
down
*NL*
into
the
grave
:
we
stayed
to
see
it
covered
.
Hareton
,
with
a
streaming
*NL*
face
,
dug
green
sods
,
and
laid
them
over
the
brown
mould
himself
:
at
*NL*
present
it
is
as
smooth
and
verdant
as
its
companion
mounds
--
and
I
hope
*NL*
its
tenant
sleeps
as
soundly
.
But
the
country
folks
,
if
you
ask
them
,
*NL*
would
swear
on
the
Bible
that
he
_
walks
_
:
there
are
those
who
speak
to
*NL*
having
met
him
near
the
church
,
and
on
the
moor
,
and
even
within
this
*NL*
house
.
Idle
tales
,
you
'll
say
,
and
so
say
I
.
Yet
that
old
man
by
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
affirms
he
has
seen
two
on
'em
looking
out
of
his
chamber
*NL*
window
on
every
rainy
night
since
his
death
:
--
and
an
odd
thing
happened
*NL*
to
me
about
a
month
ago
.
I
was
going
to
the
Grange
one
evening
--
a
dark
*NL*
evening
,
threatening
thunder
--
and
,
just
at
the
turn
of
the
Heights
,
I
*NL*
encountered
a
little
boy
with
a
sheep
and
two
lambs
before
him
;
he
was
*NL*
crying
terribly
;
and
I
supposed
the
lambs
were
skittish
,
and
would
not
be
*NL*
guided
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
the
matter
,
my
little
man
?
'
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
Heathcliff
and
a
woman
yonder
,
under
t
'
nab
,
'
he
blubbered
,
`
un
'
*NL*
I
darnut
pass
'em
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
nothing
;
but
neither
the
sheep
nor
he
would
go
on
so
I
bid
him
take
*NL*
the
road
lower
down
.
He
probably
raised
the
phantoms
from
thinking
,
as
*NL*
he
traversed
the
moors
alone
,
on
the
nonsense
he
had
heard
his
parents
*NL*
and
companions
repeat
.
Yet
,
still
,
I
do
n't
like
being
out
in
the
dark
*NL*
now
;
and
I
do
n't
like
being
left
by
myself
in
this
grim
house
:
I
can
not
*NL*
help
it
;
I
shall
be
glad
when
they
leave
it
,
and
shift
to
the
Grange
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
are
going
to
the
Grange
,
then
?
'
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
answered
Mrs.
Dean
,
`
as
soon
as
they
are
married
,
and
that
will
be
*NL*
on
New
Year
's
Day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
who
will
live
here
then
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
Joseph
will
take
care
of
the
house
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
lad
to
keep
him
*NL*
company
.
They
will
live
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
rest
will
be
shut
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
the
use
of
such
ghosts
as
choose
to
inhabit
it
?
'
I
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
Mr.
Lockwood
,
'
said
Nelly
,
shaking
her
head
.
'
I
believe
the
dead
*NL*
are
at
peace
:
but
it
is
not
right
to
speak
of
them
with
levity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
garden
gate
swung
to
;
the
ramblers
were
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
They
_
are
afraid
of
nothing
,
'
I
grumbled
,
watching
their
approach
*NL*
through
the
window
.
`
Together
,
they
would
brave
Satan
and
all
his
*NL*
legions
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
stepped
on
to
the
door-stones
,
and
halted
to
take
a
last
look
at
*NL*
the
moon
--
or
,
more
correctly
,
at
each
other
by
her
light
--
I
felt
*NL*
irresistibly
impelled
to
escape
them
again
;
and
,
pressing
a
remembrance
*NL*
into
the
hand
of
Mrs.
Dean
,
and
disregarding
her
expostulations
at
my
*NL*
rudeness
,
I
vanished
through
the
kitchen
as
they
opened
the
house-door
;
*NL*
and
so
should
have
confirmed
Joseph
in
his
opinion
of
his
*NL*
fellow-servant
's
gay
indiscretions
,
had
he
not
fortunately
recognised
me
*NL*
for
a
respectable
character
by
the
sweet
ring
of
a
sovereign
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
walk
home
was
lengthened
by
a
diversion
in
the
direction
of
the
kirk
.
*NL*
When
beneath
its
walls
,
I
perceived
decay
had
made
progress
,
even
in
*NL*
seven
months
:
many
a
window
showed
black
gaps
deprived
of
glass
;
and
*NL*
slates
jutted
off
here
and
there
,
beyond
the
right
line
of
the
roof
,
to
*NL*
be
gradually
worked
off
in
coming
autumn
storms
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sought
,
and
soon
discovered
,
the
three
headstones
on
the
slope
next
the
*NL*
moor
:
the
middle
one
grey
,
and
half
buried
in
the
heath
;
Edgar
Linton
's
*NL*
only
harmonized
by
the
turf
and
moss
creeping
up
its
foot
;
Heathcliff
's
*NL*
still
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lingered
round
them
,
under
that
benign
sky
:
watched
the
moths
*NL*
fluttering
among
the
heath
and
harebells
,
listened
to
the
soft
wind
*NL*
breathing
through
the
grass
,
and
wondered
how
any
one
could
ever
imagine
*NL*
unquiet
slumbers
for
the
sleepers
in
that
quiet
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
