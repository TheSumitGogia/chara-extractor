PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
The
ungentle
laws
and
customs
touched
upon
in
this
tale
are
*NL*
historical
,
and
the
episodes
which
are
used
to
illustrate
them
*NL*
are
also
historical
.
It
is
not
pretended
that
these
laws
and
*NL*
customs
existed
in
England
in
the
sixth
century
;
no
,
it
is
only
*NL*
pretended
that
inasmuch
as
they
existed
in
the
English
and
other
*NL*
civilizations
of
far
later
times
,
it
is
safe
to
consider
that
it
is
*NL*
no
libel
upon
the
sixth
century
to
suppose
them
to
have
been
in
*NL*
practice
in
that
day
also
.
One
is
quite
justified
in
inferring
*NL*
that
whatever
one
of
these
laws
or
customs
was
lacking
in
that
*NL*
remote
time
,
its
place
was
competently
filled
by
a
worse
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
as
to
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
divine
right
*NL*
of
kings
is
not
settled
in
this
book
.
It
was
found
too
difficult
.
*NL*
That
the
executive
head
of
a
nation
should
be
a
person
of
lofty
*NL*
character
and
extraordinary
ability
,
was
manifest
and
indisputable
;
*NL*
that
none
but
the
Deity
could
select
that
head
unerringly
,
was
*NL*
also
manifest
and
indisputable
;
that
the
Deity
ought
to
make
that
*NL*
selection
,
then
,
was
likewise
manifest
and
indisputable
;
consequently
,
*NL*
that
He
does
make
it
,
as
claimed
,
was
an
unavoidable
deduction
.
*NL*
I
mean
,
until
the
author
of
this
book
encountered
the
Pompadour
,
*NL*
and
Lady
Castlemaine
,
and
some
other
executive
heads
of
that
kind
;
*NL*
these
were
found
so
difficult
to
work
into
the
scheme
,
that
it
*NL*
was
judged
better
to
take
the
other
tack
in
this
book
-LRB-
which
*NL*
must
be
issued
this
fall
-RRB-
,
and
then
go
into
training
and
settle
*NL*
the
question
in
another
book
.
It
is
,
of
course
,
a
thing
which
*NL*
ought
to
be
settled
,
and
I
am
not
going
to
have
anything
particular
*NL*
to
do
next
winter
anyway
.

A
WORD
OF
EXPLANATION
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
Warwick
Castle
that
I
came
across
the
curious
stranger
*NL*
whom
I
am
going
to
talk
about
.
He
attracted
me
by
three
things
:
*NL*
his
candid
simplicity
,
his
marvelous
familiarity
with
ancient
armor
,
*NL*
and
the
restfulness
of
his
company
--
for
he
did
all
the
talking
.
*NL*
We
fell
together
,
as
modest
people
will
,
in
the
tail
of
the
herd
*NL*
that
was
being
shown
through
,
and
he
at
once
began
to
say
things
*NL*
which
interested
me
.
As
he
talked
along
,
softly
,
pleasantly
,
*NL*
flowingly
,
he
seemed
to
drift
away
imperceptibly
out
of
this
world
*NL*
and
time
,
and
into
some
remote
era
and
old
forgotten
country
;
*NL*
and
so
he
gradually
wove
such
a
spell
about
me
that
I
seemed
*NL*
to
move
among
the
specters
and
shadows
and
dust
and
mold
of
a
gray
*NL*
antiquity
,
holding
speech
with
a
relic
of
it
!
Exactly
as
I
would
*NL*
speak
of
my
nearest
personal
friends
or
enemies
,
or
my
most
familiar
*NL*
neighbors
,
he
spoke
of
Sir
Bedivere
,
Sir
Bors
de
Ganis
,
Sir
Launcelot
*NL*
of
the
Lake
,
Sir
Galahad
,
and
all
the
other
great
names
of
the
*NL*
Table
Round
--
and
how
old
,
old
,
unspeakably
old
and
faded
and
dry
*NL*
and
musty
and
ancient
he
came
to
look
as
he
went
on
!
Presently
*NL*
he
turned
to
me
and
said
,
just
as
one
might
speak
of
the
weather
,
*NL*
or
any
other
common
matter
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
about
transmigration
of
souls
;
do
you
know
about
*NL*
transposition
of
epochs
--
and
bodies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
not
heard
of
it
.
He
was
so
little
interested
--
just
*NL*
as
when
people
speak
of
the
weather
--
that
he
did
not
notice
*NL*
whether
I
made
him
any
answer
or
not
.
There
was
half
a
moment
*NL*
of
silence
,
immediately
interrupted
by
the
droning
voice
of
the
*NL*
salaried
cicerone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ancient
hauberk
,
date
of
the
sixth
century
,
time
of
King
Arthur
*NL*
and
the
Round
Table
;
said
to
have
belonged
to
the
knight
Sir
Sagramor
*NL*
le
Desirous
;
observe
the
round
hole
through
the
chain-mail
in
*NL*
the
left
breast
;
ca
n't
be
accounted
for
;
supposed
to
have
been
*NL*
done
with
a
bullet
since
invention
of
firearms
--
perhaps
maliciously
*NL*
by
Cromwell
's
soldiers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
acquaintance
smiled
--
not
a
modern
smile
,
but
one
that
must
*NL*
have
gone
out
of
general
use
many
,
many
centuries
ago
--
and
muttered
*NL*
apparently
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wit
ye
well
,
_
I
saw
it
done
_
.
''
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
added
:
*NL*
``
I
did
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
I
had
recovered
from
the
electric
surprise
of
this
*NL*
remark
,
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
evening
I
sat
by
my
fire
at
the
Warwick
Arms
,
steeped
*NL*
in
a
dream
of
the
olden
time
,
while
the
rain
beat
upon
the
windows
,
*NL*
and
the
wind
roared
about
the
eaves
and
corners
.
From
time
to
*NL*
time
I
dipped
into
old
Sir
Thomas
Malory
's
enchanting
book
,
and
*NL*
fed
at
its
rich
feast
of
prodigies
and
adventures
,
breathed
in
*NL*
the
fragrance
of
its
obsolete
names
,
and
dreamed
again
.
Midnight
*NL*
being
come
at
length
,
I
read
another
tale
,
for
a
nightcap
--
this
*NL*
which
here
follows
,
to
wit
:
*NL*
*NL*
HOW
SIR
LAUNCELOT
SLEW
TWO
GIANTS
,
AND
MADE
A
CASTLE
FREE
*NL*
*NL*
Anon
withal
came
there
upon
him
two
great
giants
,
*NL*
well
armed
,
all
save
the
heads
,
with
two
horrible
*NL*
clubs
in
their
hands
.
Sir
Launcelot
put
his
shield
*NL*
afore
him
,
and
put
the
stroke
away
of
the
one
*NL*
giant
,
and
with
his
sword
he
clave
his
head
asunder
.
*NL*
When
his
fellow
saw
that
,
he
ran
away
as
he
were
*NL*
wood
-LSB-
*
demented
-RSB-
,
for
fear
of
the
horrible
strokes
,
*NL*
and
Sir
Launcelot
after
him
with
all
his
might
,
*NL*
and
smote
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
clave
him
to
*NL*
the
middle
.
Then
Sir
Launcelot
went
into
the
hall
,
*NL*
and
there
came
afore
him
three
score
ladies
and
*NL*
damsels
,
and
all
kneeled
unto
him
,
and
thanked
*NL*
God
and
him
of
their
deliverance
.
For
,
sir
,
said
*NL*
they
,
the
most
part
of
us
have
been
here
this
*NL*
seven
year
their
prisoners
,
and
we
have
worked
all
*NL*
manner
of
silk
works
for
our
meat
,
and
we
are
all
*NL*
great
gentle-women
born
,
and
blessed
be
the
time
,
*NL*
knight
,
that
ever
thou
wert
born
;
for
thou
hast
*NL*
done
the
most
worship
that
ever
did
knight
in
the
*NL*
world
,
that
will
we
bear
record
,
and
we
all
pray
*NL*
you
to
tell
us
your
name
,
that
we
may
tell
our
*NL*
friends
who
delivered
us
out
of
prison
.
Fair
*NL*
damsels
,
he
said
,
my
name
is
Sir
Launcelot
du
*NL*
Lake
.
And
so
he
departed
from
them
and
betaught
*NL*
them
unto
God
.
And
then
he
mounted
upon
his
*NL*
horse
,
and
rode
into
many
strange
and
wild
*NL*
countries
,
and
through
many
waters
and
valleys
,
*NL*
and
evil
was
he
lodged
.
And
at
the
last
by
*NL*
fortune
him
happened
against
a
night
to
come
to
*NL*
a
fair
courtilage
,
and
therein
he
found
an
old
*NL*
gentle-woman
that
lodged
him
with
a
good-will
,
*NL*
and
there
he
had
good
cheer
for
him
and
his
horse
.
*NL*
And
when
time
was
,
his
host
brought
him
into
a
*NL*
fair
garret
over
the
gate
to
his
bed
.
There
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
unarmed
him
,
and
set
his
harness
*NL*
by
him
,
and
went
to
bed
,
and
anon
he
fell
on
*NL*
sleep
.
So
,
soon
after
there
came
one
on
*NL*
horseback
,
and
knocked
at
the
gate
in
great
*NL*
haste
.
And
when
Sir
Launcelot
heard
this
he
rose
*NL*
up
,
and
looked
out
at
the
window
,
and
saw
by
the
*NL*
moonlight
three
knights
come
riding
after
that
*NL*
one
man
,
and
all
three
lashed
on
him
at
once
*NL*
with
swords
,
and
that
one
knight
turned
on
them
*NL*
knightly
again
and
defended
him
.
Truly
,
said
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
,
yonder
one
knight
shall
I
help
,
*NL*
for
it
were
shame
for
me
to
see
three
knights
*NL*
on
one
,
and
if
he
be
slain
I
am
partner
of
his
*NL*
death
.
And
therewith
he
took
his
harness
and
*NL*
went
out
at
a
window
by
a
sheet
down
to
the
four
*NL*
knights
,
and
then
Sir
Launcelot
said
on
high
,
*NL*
Turn
you
knights
unto
me
,
and
leave
your
*NL*
fighting
with
that
knight
.
And
then
they
all
*NL*
three
left
Sir
Kay
,
and
turned
unto
Sir
Launcelot
,
*NL*
and
there
began
great
battle
,
for
they
alight
*NL*
all
three
,
and
strake
many
strokes
at
Sir
*NL*
Launcelot
,
and
assailed
him
on
every
side
.
Then
*NL*
Sir
Kay
dressed
him
for
to
have
holpen
Sir
*NL*
Launcelot
.
Nay
,
sir
,
said
he
,
I
will
none
of
*NL*
your
help
,
therefore
as
ye
will
have
my
help
*NL*
let
me
alone
with
them
.
Sir
Kay
for
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
the
knight
suffered
him
for
to
do
his
will
,
*NL*
and
so
stood
aside
.
And
then
anon
within
six
*NL*
strokes
Sir
Launcelot
had
stricken
them
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
they
all
three
cried
,
Sir
Knight
,
we
*NL*
yield
us
unto
you
as
man
of
might
matchless
.
As
*NL*
to
that
,
said
Sir
Launcelot
,
I
will
not
take
*NL*
your
yielding
unto
me
,
but
so
that
ye
yield
*NL*
you
unto
Sir
Kay
the
seneschal
,
on
that
covenant
*NL*
I
will
save
your
lives
and
else
not
.
Fair
knight
,
*NL*
said
they
,
that
were
we
loath
to
do
;
for
as
for
*NL*
Sir
Kay
we
chased
him
hither
,
and
had
overcome
*NL*
him
had
ye
not
been
;
therefore
,
to
yield
us
unto
*NL*
him
it
were
no
reason
.
Well
,
as
to
that
,
said
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
,
advise
you
well
,
for
ye
may
*NL*
choose
whether
ye
will
die
or
live
,
for
an
ye
be
*NL*
yielden
,
it
shall
be
unto
Sir
Kay
.
Fair
knight
,
*NL*
then
they
said
,
in
saving
our
lives
we
will
do
*NL*
as
thou
commandest
us
.
Then
shall
ye
,
said
Sir
*NL*
Launcelot
,
on
Whitsunday
next
coming
go
unto
the
*NL*
court
of
King
Arthur
,
and
there
shall
ye
yield
*NL*
you
unto
Queen
Guenever
,
and
put
you
all
three
*NL*
in
her
grace
and
mercy
,
and
say
that
Sir
Kay
*NL*
sent
you
thither
to
be
her
prisoners
.
On
the
morn
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
arose
early
,
and
left
Sir
Kay
*NL*
sleeping
;
and
Sir
Launcelot
took
Sir
Kay
's
armor
*NL*
and
his
shield
and
armed
him
,
and
so
he
went
to
*NL*
the
stable
and
took
his
horse
,
and
took
his
leave
*NL*
of
his
host
,
and
so
he
departed
.
Then
soon
after
*NL*
arose
Sir
Kay
and
missed
Sir
Launcelot
;
and
*NL*
then
he
espied
that
he
had
his
armor
and
his
*NL*
horse
.
Now
by
my
faith
I
know
well
that
he
will
*NL*
grieve
some
of
the
court
of
King
Arthur
;
for
on
*NL*
him
knights
will
be
bold
,
and
deem
that
it
is
I
,
*NL*
and
that
will
beguile
them
;
and
because
of
his
*NL*
armor
and
shield
I
am
sure
I
shall
ride
in
peace
.
*NL*
And
then
soon
after
departed
Sir
Kay
,
and
*NL*
thanked
his
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
laid
the
book
down
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
my
*NL*
stranger
came
in
.
I
gave
him
a
pipe
and
a
chair
,
and
made
him
*NL*
welcome
.
I
also
comforted
him
with
a
hot
Scotch
whisky
;
gave
him
*NL*
another
one
;
then
still
another
--
hoping
always
for
his
story
.
*NL*
After
a
fourth
persuader
,
he
drifted
into
it
himself
,
in
a
quite
*NL*
simple
and
natural
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
STRANGER
'S
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
an
American
.
I
was
born
and
reared
in
Hartford
,
in
the
State
*NL*
of
Connecticut
--
anyway
,
just
over
the
river
,
in
the
country
.
So
*NL*
I
am
a
Yankee
of
the
Yankees
--
and
practical
;
yes
,
and
nearly
*NL*
barren
of
sentiment
,
I
suppose
--
or
poetry
,
in
other
words
.
My
*NL*
father
was
a
blacksmith
,
my
uncle
was
a
horse
doctor
,
and
I
was
*NL*
both
,
along
at
first
.
Then
I
went
over
to
the
great
arms
factory
*NL*
and
learned
my
real
trade
;
learned
all
there
was
to
it
;
learned
*NL*
to
make
everything
:
guns
,
revolvers
,
cannon
,
boilers
,
engines
,
all
*NL*
sorts
of
labor-saving
machinery
.
Why
,
I
could
make
anything
*NL*
a
body
wanted
--
anything
in
the
world
,
it
did
n't
make
any
difference
*NL*
what
;
and
if
there
was
n't
any
quick
new-fangled
way
to
make
a
thing
,
*NL*
I
could
invent
one
--
and
do
it
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
.
I
became
*NL*
head
superintendent
;
had
a
couple
of
thousand
men
under
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
a
man
like
that
is
a
man
that
is
full
of
fight
--
that
goes
*NL*
without
saying
.
With
a
couple
of
thousand
rough
men
under
one
,
*NL*
one
has
plenty
of
that
sort
of
amusement
.
I
had
,
anyway
.
At
last
*NL*
I
met
my
match
,
and
I
got
my
dose
.
It
was
during
a
misunderstanding
*NL*
conducted
with
crowbars
with
a
fellow
we
used
to
call
Hercules
.
*NL*
He
laid
me
out
with
a
crusher
alongside
the
head
that
made
everything
*NL*
crack
,
and
seemed
to
spring
every
joint
in
my
skull
and
made
it
*NL*
overlap
its
neighbor
.
Then
the
world
went
out
in
darkness
,
and
*NL*
I
did
n't
feel
anything
more
,
and
did
n't
know
anything
at
all
*NL*
--
at
least
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
again
,
I
was
sitting
under
an
oak
tree
,
on
the
*NL*
grass
,
with
a
whole
beautiful
and
broad
country
landscape
all
*NL*
to
myself
--
nearly
.
Not
entirely
;
for
there
was
a
fellow
on
a
horse
,
*NL*
looking
down
at
me
--
a
fellow
fresh
out
of
a
picture-book
.
He
was
*NL*
in
old-time
iron
armor
from
head
to
heel
,
with
a
helmet
on
his
*NL*
head
the
shape
of
a
nail-keg
with
slits
in
it
;
and
he
had
a
shield
,
*NL*
and
a
sword
,
and
a
prodigious
spear
;
and
his
horse
had
armor
on
,
*NL*
too
,
and
a
steel
horn
projecting
from
his
forehead
,
and
gorgeous
*NL*
red
and
green
silk
trappings
that
hung
down
all
around
him
like
*NL*
a
bedquilt
,
nearly
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
sir
,
will
ye
just
?
''
said
this
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
ye
try
a
passage
of
arms
for
land
or
lady
or
for
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
giving
me
?
''
I
said
.
``
Get
along
back
to
your
circus
,
*NL*
or
I
'll
report
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
what
does
this
man
do
but
fall
back
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
*NL*
and
then
come
rushing
at
me
as
hard
as
he
could
tear
,
with
his
*NL*
nail-keg
bent
down
nearly
to
his
horse
's
neck
and
his
long
spear
*NL*
pointed
straight
ahead
.
I
saw
he
meant
business
,
so
I
was
up
*NL*
the
tree
when
he
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
allowed
that
I
was
his
property
,
the
captive
of
his
spear
.
*NL*
There
was
argument
on
his
side
--
and
the
bulk
of
the
advantage
*NL*
--
so
I
judged
it
best
to
humor
him
.
We
fixed
up
an
agreement
*NL*
whereby
I
was
to
go
with
him
and
he
was
not
to
hurt
me
.
I
came
*NL*
down
,
and
we
started
away
,
I
walking
by
the
side
of
his
horse
.
*NL*
We
marched
comfortably
along
,
through
glades
and
over
brooks
which
*NL*
I
could
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
--
which
puzzled
me
and
*NL*
made
me
wonder
--
and
yet
we
did
not
come
to
any
circus
or
sign
of
*NL*
a
circus
.
So
I
gave
up
the
idea
of
a
circus
,
and
concluded
he
was
*NL*
from
an
asylum
.
But
we
never
came
to
an
asylum
--
so
I
was
up
*NL*
a
stump
,
as
you
may
say
.
I
asked
him
how
far
we
were
from
Hartford
.
*NL*
He
said
he
had
never
heard
of
the
place
;
which
I
took
to
be
a
lie
,
*NL*
but
allowed
it
to
go
at
that
.
At
the
end
of
an
hour
we
saw
a
*NL*
far-away
town
sleeping
in
a
valley
by
a
winding
river
;
and
beyond
*NL*
it
on
a
hill
,
a
vast
gray
fortress
,
with
towers
and
turrets
,
*NL*
the
first
I
had
ever
seen
out
of
a
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bridgeport
?
''
said
I
,
pointing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Camelot
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
stranger
had
been
showing
signs
of
sleepiness
.
He
caught
*NL*
himself
nodding
,
now
,
and
smiled
one
of
those
pathetic
,
obsolete
*NL*
smiles
of
his
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
I
ca
n't
go
on
;
but
come
with
me
,
I
've
got
it
all
written
*NL*
out
,
and
you
can
read
it
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
chamber
,
he
said
:
``
First
,
I
kept
a
journal
;
then
by
and
by
,
*NL*
after
years
,
I
took
the
journal
and
turned
it
into
a
book
.
How
*NL*
long
ago
that
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
me
his
manuscript
,
and
pointed
out
the
place
where
*NL*
I
should
begin
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Begin
here
--
I
've
already
told
you
what
goes
before
.
''
He
was
*NL*
steeped
in
drowsiness
by
this
time
.
As
I
went
out
at
his
door
*NL*
I
heard
him
murmur
sleepily
:
``
Give
you
good
den
,
fair
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
down
by
my
fire
and
examined
my
treasure
.
The
first
part
*NL*
of
it
--
the
great
bulk
of
it
--
was
parchment
,
and
yellow
with
age
.
*NL*
I
scanned
a
leaf
particularly
and
saw
that
it
was
a
palimpsest
.
*NL*
Under
the
old
dim
writing
of
the
Yankee
historian
appeared
traces
*NL*
of
a
penmanship
which
was
older
and
dimmer
still
--
Latin
words
*NL*
and
sentences
:
fragments
from
old
monkish
legends
,
evidently
.
*NL*
I
turned
to
the
place
indicated
by
my
stranger
and
began
to
read
*NL*
--
as
follows
:

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
CAMELOT
*NL*
*NL*
``
Camelot
--
Camelot
,
''
said
I
to
myself
.
``
I
do
n't
seem
to
remember
*NL*
hearing
of
it
before
.
Name
of
the
asylum
,
likely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
soft
,
reposeful
summer
landscape
,
as
lovely
as
a
dream
,
*NL*
and
as
lonesome
as
Sunday
.
The
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
*NL*
flowers
,
and
the
buzzing
of
insects
,
and
the
twittering
of
birds
,
*NL*
and
there
were
no
people
,
no
wagons
,
there
was
no
stir
of
life
,
*NL*
nothing
going
on
.
The
road
was
mainly
a
winding
path
with
hoof-prints
*NL*
in
it
,
and
now
and
then
a
faint
trace
of
wheels
on
either
side
in
*NL*
the
grass
--
wheels
that
apparently
had
a
tire
as
broad
as
one
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
a
fair
slip
of
a
girl
,
about
ten
years
old
,
with
a
cataract
*NL*
of
golden
hair
streaming
down
over
her
shoulders
,
came
along
.
*NL*
Around
her
head
she
wore
a
hoop
of
flame-red
poppies
.
It
was
as
*NL*
sweet
an
outfit
as
ever
I
saw
,
what
there
was
of
it
.
She
walked
*NL*
indolently
along
,
with
a
mind
at
rest
,
its
peace
reflected
in
her
*NL*
innocent
face
.
The
circus
man
paid
no
attention
to
her
;
did
n't
*NL*
even
seem
to
see
her
.
And
she
--
she
was
no
more
startled
at
his
*NL*
fantastic
make-up
than
if
she
was
used
to
his
like
every
day
of
*NL*
her
life
.
She
was
going
by
as
indifferently
as
she
might
have
gone
*NL*
by
a
couple
of
cows
;
but
when
she
happened
to
notice
me
,
_
then
_
*NL*
there
was
a
change
!
Up
went
her
hands
,
and
she
was
turned
to
stone
;
*NL*
her
mouth
dropped
open
,
her
eyes
stared
wide
and
timorously
,
she
*NL*
was
the
picture
of
astonished
curiosity
touched
with
fear
.
And
*NL*
there
she
stood
gazing
,
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
fascination
,
till
*NL*
we
turned
a
corner
of
the
wood
and
were
lost
to
her
view
.
That
*NL*
she
should
be
startled
at
me
instead
of
at
the
other
man
,
was
too
*NL*
many
for
me
;
I
could
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
it
.
And
that
she
*NL*
should
seem
to
consider
me
a
spectacle
,
and
totally
overlook
her
*NL*
own
merits
in
that
respect
,
was
another
puzzling
thing
,
and
a
*NL*
display
of
magnanimity
,
too
,
that
was
surprising
in
one
so
young
.
*NL*
There
was
food
for
thought
here
.
I
moved
along
as
one
in
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
approached
the
town
,
signs
of
life
began
to
appear
.
At
*NL*
intervals
we
passed
a
wretched
cabin
,
with
a
thatched
roof
,
and
*NL*
about
it
small
fields
and
garden
patches
in
an
indifferent
state
of
*NL*
cultivation
.
There
were
people
,
too
;
brawny
men
,
with
long
,
coarse
,
*NL*
uncombed
hair
that
hung
down
over
their
faces
and
made
them
look
*NL*
like
animals
.
They
and
the
women
,
as
a
rule
,
wore
a
coarse
*NL*
tow-linen
robe
that
came
well
below
the
knee
,
and
a
rude
sort
of
*NL*
sandal
,
and
many
wore
an
iron
collar
.
The
small
boys
and
girls
*NL*
were
always
naked
;
but
nobody
seemed
to
know
it
.
All
of
these
*NL*
people
stared
at
me
,
talked
about
me
,
ran
into
the
huts
and
fetched
*NL*
out
their
families
to
gape
at
me
;
but
nobody
ever
noticed
that
*NL*
other
fellow
,
except
to
make
him
humble
salutation
and
get
no
*NL*
response
for
their
pains
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
town
were
some
substantial
windowless
houses
of
stone
*NL*
scattered
among
a
wilderness
of
thatched
cabins
;
the
streets
were
*NL*
mere
crooked
alleys
,
and
unpaved
;
troops
of
dogs
and
nude
children
*NL*
played
in
the
sun
and
made
life
and
noise
;
hogs
roamed
and
rooted
*NL*
contentedly
about
,
and
one
of
them
lay
in
a
reeking
wallow
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
main
thoroughfare
and
suckled
her
family
.
*NL*
Presently
there
was
a
distant
blare
of
military
music
;
it
came
*NL*
nearer
,
still
nearer
,
and
soon
a
noble
cavalcade
wound
into
view
,
*NL*
glorious
with
plumed
helmets
and
flashing
mail
and
flaunting
banners
*NL*
and
rich
doublets
and
horse-cloths
and
gilded
spearheads
;
and
*NL*
through
the
muck
and
swine
,
and
naked
brats
,
and
joyous
dogs
,
and
*NL*
shabby
huts
,
it
took
its
gallant
way
,
and
in
its
wake
we
followed
.
*NL*
Followed
through
one
winding
alley
and
then
another
,
--
and
climbing
,
*NL*
always
climbing
--
till
at
last
we
gained
the
breezy
height
where
*NL*
the
huge
castle
stood
.
There
was
an
exchange
of
bugle
blasts
;
*NL*
then
a
parley
from
the
walls
,
where
men-at-arms
,
in
hauberk
and
*NL*
morion
,
marched
back
and
forth
with
halberd
at
shoulder
under
*NL*
flapping
banners
with
the
rude
figure
of
a
dragon
displayed
upon
*NL*
them
;
and
then
the
great
gates
were
flung
open
,
the
drawbridge
*NL*
was
lowered
,
and
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
swept
forward
under
*NL*
the
frowning
arches
;
and
we
,
following
,
soon
found
ourselves
in
*NL*
a
great
paved
court
,
with
towers
and
turrets
stretching
up
into
*NL*
the
blue
air
on
all
the
four
sides
;
and
all
about
us
the
dismount
*NL*
was
going
on
,
and
much
greeting
and
ceremony
,
and
running
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
and
a
gay
display
of
moving
and
intermingling
colors
,
and
*NL*
an
altogether
pleasant
stir
and
noise
and
confusion
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
KING
ARTHUR
'S
COURT
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
I
got
a
chance
I
slipped
aside
privately
and
touched
*NL*
an
ancient
common
looking
man
on
the
shoulder
and
said
,
in
an
*NL*
insinuating
,
confidential
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
,
do
me
a
kindness
.
Do
you
belong
to
the
asylum
,
or
are
*NL*
you
just
on
a
visit
or
something
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
me
over
stupidly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
fair
sir
,
me
seemeth
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
I
said
;
``
I
reckon
you
are
a
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
moved
away
,
cogitating
,
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
an
eye
*NL*
out
for
any
chance
passenger
in
his
right
mind
that
might
come
*NL*
along
and
give
me
some
light
.
I
judged
I
had
found
one
,
presently
;
*NL*
so
I
drew
him
aside
and
said
in
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
see
the
head
keeper
a
minute
--
only
just
a
minute
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prithee
do
not
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
you
_
what
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Hinder
_
me
,
then
,
if
the
word
please
thee
better
.
Then
he
went
*NL*
on
to
say
he
was
an
under-cook
and
could
not
stop
to
gossip
,
*NL*
though
he
would
like
it
another
time
;
for
it
would
comfort
his
*NL*
very
liver
to
know
where
I
got
my
clothes
.
As
he
started
away
he
*NL*
pointed
and
said
yonder
was
one
who
was
idle
enough
for
my
purpose
,
*NL*
and
was
seeking
me
besides
,
no
doubt
.
This
was
an
airy
slim
boy
*NL*
in
shrimp-colored
tights
that
made
him
look
like
a
forked
carrot
,
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
gear
was
blue
silk
and
dainty
laces
and
ruffles
;
*NL*
and
he
had
long
yellow
curls
,
and
wore
a
plumed
pink
satin
cap
*NL*
tilted
complacently
over
his
ear
.
By
his
look
,
he
was
good-natured
;
*NL*
by
his
gait
,
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
.
He
was
pretty
enough
*NL*
to
frame
.
He
arrived
,
looked
me
over
with
a
smiling
and
impudent
*NL*
curiosity
;
said
he
had
come
for
me
,
and
informed
me
that
he
was
a
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
`
long
,
''
I
said
;
``
you
ai
n't
more
than
a
paragraph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pretty
severe
,
but
I
was
nettled
.
However
,
it
never
phazed
*NL*
him
;
he
did
n't
appear
to
know
he
was
hurt
.
He
began
to
talk
and
*NL*
laugh
,
in
happy
,
thoughtless
,
boyish
fashion
,
as
we
walked
along
,
*NL*
and
made
himself
old
friends
with
me
at
once
;
asked
me
all
sorts
*NL*
of
questions
about
myself
and
about
my
clothes
,
but
never
waited
*NL*
for
an
answer
--
always
chattered
straight
ahead
,
as
if
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
he
had
asked
a
question
and
was
n't
expecting
any
reply
,
until
*NL*
at
last
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
was
born
in
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
year
513
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
the
cold
chills
creep
over
me
!
I
stopped
and
said
,
*NL*
a
little
faintly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
did
n't
hear
you
just
right
.
Say
it
again
--
and
say
it
*NL*
slow
.
What
year
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
513
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
513
!
You
do
n't
look
it
!
Come
,
my
boy
,
I
am
a
stranger
and
*NL*
friendless
;
be
honest
and
honorable
with
me
.
Are
you
in
your
*NL*
right
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
these
other
people
in
their
right
minds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
n't
an
asylum
?
I
mean
,
it
is
n't
a
place
where
they
*NL*
cure
crazy
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
was
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
I
said
,
``
either
I
am
a
lunatic
,
or
something
just
*NL*
as
awful
has
happened
.
Now
tell
me
,
honest
and
true
,
where
am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
IN
KING
ARTHUR
'S
COURT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
a
minute
,
to
let
that
idea
shudder
its
way
home
,
*NL*
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
according
to
your
notions
,
what
year
is
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
528
--
nineteenth
of
June
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
a
mournful
sinking
at
the
heart
,
and
muttered
:
``
I
shall
*NL*
never
see
my
friends
again
--
never
,
never
again
.
They
will
not
*NL*
be
born
for
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
seemed
to
believe
the
boy
,
I
did
n't
know
why
.
_
Something
_
in
me
*NL*
seemed
to
believe
him
--
my
consciousness
,
as
you
may
say
;
but
my
*NL*
reason
did
n't
.
My
reason
straightway
began
to
clamor
;
that
was
*NL*
natural
.
I
did
n't
know
how
to
go
about
satisfying
it
,
because
*NL*
I
knew
that
the
testimony
of
men
would
n't
serve
--
my
reason
would
*NL*
say
they
were
lunatics
,
and
throw
out
their
evidence
.
But
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
I
stumbled
on
the
very
thing
,
just
by
luck
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
the
only
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
in
the
first
half
of
the
*NL*
sixth
century
occurred
on
the
21st
of
June
,
A.D.
528
,
O.S.
,
and
*NL*
began
at
3
minutes
after
12
noon
.
I
also
knew
that
no
total
eclipse
*NL*
of
the
sun
was
due
in
what
to
_
me
_
was
the
present
year
--
i.e.
,
1879
.
*NL*
So
,
if
I
could
keep
my
anxiety
and
curiosity
from
eating
the
heart
*NL*
out
of
me
for
forty-eight
hours
,
I
should
then
find
out
for
certain
*NL*
whether
this
boy
was
telling
me
the
truth
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherefore
,
being
a
practical
Connecticut
man
,
I
now
shoved
this
*NL*
whole
problem
clear
out
of
my
mind
till
its
appointed
day
and
hour
*NL*
should
come
,
in
order
that
I
might
turn
all
my
attention
to
the
*NL*
circumstances
of
the
present
moment
,
and
be
alert
and
ready
to
*NL*
make
the
most
out
of
them
that
could
be
made
.
One
thing
at
a
time
,
*NL*
is
my
motto
--
and
just
play
that
thing
for
all
it
is
worth
,
even
*NL*
if
it
's
only
two
pair
and
a
jack
.
I
made
up
my
mind
to
two
things
:
*NL*
if
it
was
still
the
nineteenth
century
and
I
was
among
lunatics
*NL*
and
could
n't
get
away
,
I
would
presently
boss
that
asylum
or
know
*NL*
the
reason
why
;
and
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
was
really
the
sixth
*NL*
century
,
all
right
,
I
did
n't
want
any
softer
thing
:
I
would
boss
*NL*
the
whole
country
inside
of
three
months
;
for
I
judged
I
would
*NL*
have
the
start
of
the
best-educated
man
in
the
kingdom
by
a
matter
*NL*
of
thirteen
hundred
years
and
upward
.
I
'm
not
a
man
to
waste
*NL*
time
after
my
mind
's
made
up
and
there
's
work
on
hand
;
so
I
said
*NL*
to
the
page
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Clarence
,
my
boy
--
if
that
might
happen
to
be
your
name
*NL*
--
I
'll
get
you
to
post
me
up
a
little
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
What
is
*NL*
the
name
of
that
apparition
that
brought
me
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
master
and
thine
?
That
is
the
good
knight
and
great
lord
*NL*
Sir
Kay
the
Seneschal
,
foster
brother
to
our
liege
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
go
on
,
tell
me
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
long
story
of
it
;
but
the
part
that
had
immediate
interest
*NL*
for
me
was
this
:
He
said
I
was
Sir
Kay
's
prisoner
,
and
that
*NL*
in
the
due
course
of
custom
I
would
be
flung
into
a
dungeon
and
*NL*
left
there
on
scant
commons
until
my
friends
ransomed
me
--
unless
*NL*
I
chanced
to
rot
,
first
.
I
saw
that
the
last
chance
had
the
best
*NL*
show
,
but
I
did
n't
waste
any
bother
about
that
;
time
was
too
*NL*
precious
.
The
page
said
,
further
,
that
dinner
was
about
ended
*NL*
in
the
great
hall
by
this
time
,
and
that
as
soon
as
the
sociability
*NL*
and
the
heavy
drinking
should
begin
,
Sir
Kay
would
have
me
in
and
*NL*
exhibit
me
before
King
Arthur
and
his
illustrious
knights
seated
at
*NL*
the
Table
Round
,
and
would
brag
about
his
exploit
in
capturing
*NL*
me
,
and
would
probably
exaggerate
the
facts
a
little
,
but
it
*NL*
would
n't
be
good
form
for
me
to
correct
him
,
and
not
over
safe
,
*NL*
either
;
and
when
I
was
done
being
exhibited
,
then
ho
for
the
*NL*
dungeon
;
but
he
,
Clarence
,
would
find
a
way
to
come
and
see
me
every
*NL*
now
and
then
,
and
cheer
me
up
,
and
help
me
get
word
to
my
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Get
word
to
my
friends
!
I
thanked
him
;
I
could
n't
do
less
;
and
*NL*
about
this
time
a
lackey
came
to
say
I
was
wanted
;
so
Clarence
*NL*
led
me
in
and
took
me
off
to
one
side
and
sat
down
by
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
a
curious
kind
of
spectacle
,
and
interesting
.
It
was
*NL*
an
immense
place
,
and
rather
naked
--
yes
,
and
full
of
loud
contrasts
.
*NL*
It
was
very
,
very
lofty
;
so
lofty
that
the
banners
depending
from
*NL*
the
arched
beams
and
girders
away
up
there
floated
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
twilight
;
there
was
a
stone-railed
gallery
at
each
end
,
high
up
,
*NL*
with
musicians
in
the
one
,
and
women
,
clothed
in
stunning
colors
,
*NL*
in
the
other
.
The
floor
was
of
big
stone
flags
laid
in
black
and
*NL*
white
squares
,
rather
battered
by
age
and
use
,
and
needing
repair
.
*NL*
As
to
ornament
,
there
was
n't
any
,
strictly
speaking
;
though
on
*NL*
the
walls
hung
some
huge
tapestries
which
were
probably
taxed
*NL*
as
works
of
art
;
battle-pieces
,
they
were
,
with
horses
shaped
like
*NL*
those
which
children
cut
out
of
paper
or
create
in
gingerbread
;
*NL*
with
men
on
them
in
scale
armor
whose
scales
are
represented
by
*NL*
round
holes
--
so
that
the
man
's
coat
looks
as
if
it
had
been
done
*NL*
with
a
biscuit-punch
.
There
was
a
fireplace
big
enough
to
camp
in
;
*NL*
and
its
projecting
sides
and
hood
,
of
carved
and
pillared
stonework
,
*NL*
had
the
look
of
a
cathedral
door
.
Along
the
walls
stood
men-at-arms
,
*NL*
in
breastplate
and
morion
,
with
halberds
for
their
only
weapon
*NL*
--
rigid
as
statues
;
and
that
is
what
they
looked
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
groined
and
vaulted
public
square
was
an
oaken
*NL*
table
which
they
called
the
Table
Round
.
It
was
as
large
as
*NL*
a
circus
ring
;
and
around
it
sat
a
great
company
of
men
dressed
*NL*
in
such
various
and
splendid
colors
that
it
hurt
one
's
eyes
to
look
*NL*
at
them
.
They
wore
their
plumed
hats
,
right
along
,
except
that
*NL*
whenever
one
addressed
himself
directly
to
the
king
,
he
lifted
*NL*
his
hat
a
trifle
just
as
he
was
beginning
his
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mainly
they
were
drinking
--
from
entire
ox
horns
;
but
a
few
were
*NL*
still
munching
bread
or
gnawing
beef
bones
.
There
was
about
*NL*
an
average
of
two
dogs
to
one
man
;
and
these
sat
in
expectant
*NL*
attitudes
till
a
spent
bone
was
flung
to
them
,
and
then
they
went
*NL*
for
it
by
brigades
and
divisions
,
with
a
rush
,
and
there
ensued
*NL*
a
fight
which
filled
the
prospect
with
a
tumultuous
chaos
of
*NL*
plunging
heads
and
bodies
and
flashing
tails
,
and
the
storm
of
*NL*
howlings
and
barkings
deafened
all
speech
for
the
time
;
but
that
*NL*
was
no
matter
,
for
the
dog-fight
was
always
a
bigger
interest
*NL*
anyway
;
the
men
rose
,
sometimes
,
to
observe
it
the
better
and
bet
*NL*
on
it
,
and
the
ladies
and
the
musicians
stretched
themselves
out
*NL*
over
their
balusters
with
the
same
object
;
and
all
broke
into
*NL*
delighted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time
.
In
the
end
,
the
winning
*NL*
dog
stretched
himself
out
comfortably
with
his
bone
between
his
*NL*
paws
,
and
proceeded
to
growl
over
it
,
and
gnaw
it
,
and
grease
*NL*
the
floor
with
it
,
just
as
fifty
others
were
already
doing
;
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
court
resumed
their
previous
industries
and
entertainments
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
,
the
speech
and
behavior
of
these
people
were
gracious
*NL*
and
courtly
;
and
I
noticed
that
they
were
good
and
serious
listeners
*NL*
when
anybody
was
telling
anything
--
I
mean
in
a
dog-fightless
*NL*
interval
.
And
plainly
,
too
,
they
were
a
childlike
and
innocent
lot
;
*NL*
telling
lies
of
the
stateliest
pattern
with
a
most
gentle
and
*NL*
winning
naivety
,
and
ready
and
willing
to
listen
to
anybody
else
's
*NL*
lie
,
and
believe
it
,
too
.
It
was
hard
to
associate
them
with
*NL*
anything
cruel
or
dreadful
;
and
yet
they
dealt
in
tales
of
blood
*NL*
and
suffering
with
a
guileless
relish
that
made
me
almost
forget
*NL*
to
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
the
only
prisoner
present
.
There
were
twenty
or
more
.
*NL*
Poor
devils
,
many
of
them
were
maimed
,
hacked
,
carved
,
in
a
frightful
*NL*
way
;
and
their
hair
,
their
faces
,
their
clothing
,
were
caked
with
*NL*
black
and
stiffened
drenchings
of
blood
.
They
were
suffering
*NL*
sharp
physical
pain
,
of
course
;
and
weariness
,
and
hunger
and
*NL*
thirst
,
no
doubt
;
and
at
least
none
had
given
them
the
comfort
*NL*
of
a
wash
,
or
even
the
poor
charity
of
a
lotion
for
their
wounds
;
*NL*
yet
you
never
heard
them
utter
a
moan
or
a
groan
,
or
saw
them
show
*NL*
any
sign
of
restlessness
,
or
any
disposition
to
complain
.
The
*NL*
thought
was
forced
upon
me
:
``
The
rascals
--
_
they
_
have
served
other
*NL*
people
so
in
their
day
;
it
being
their
own
turn
,
now
,
they
were
*NL*
not
expecting
any
better
treatment
than
this
;
so
their
philosophical
*NL*
bearing
is
not
an
outcome
of
mental
training
,
intellectual
fortitude
,
*NL*
reasoning
;
it
is
mere
animal
training
;
they
are
white
Indians
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
KNIGHTS
OF
THE
TABLE
ROUND
*NL*
*NL*
Mainly
the
Round
Table
talk
was
monologues
--
narrative
accounts
*NL*
of
the
adventures
in
which
these
prisoners
were
captured
and
their
*NL*
friends
and
backers
killed
and
stripped
of
their
steeds
and
armor
.
*NL*
As
a
general
thing
--
as
far
as
I
could
make
out
--
these
murderous
*NL*
adventures
were
not
forays
undertaken
to
avenge
injuries
,
nor
to
*NL*
settle
old
disputes
or
sudden
fallings
out
;
no
,
as
a
rule
they
were
*NL*
simply
duels
between
strangers
--
duels
between
people
who
had
never
*NL*
even
been
introduced
to
each
other
,
and
between
whom
existed
no
*NL*
cause
of
offense
whatever
.
Many
a
time
I
had
seen
a
couple
of
boys
,
*NL*
strangers
,
meet
by
chance
,
and
say
simultaneously
,
``
I
can
lick
you
,
''
*NL*
and
go
at
it
on
the
spot
;
but
I
had
always
imagined
until
now
that
*NL*
that
sort
of
thing
belonged
to
children
only
,
and
was
a
sign
and
*NL*
mark
of
childhood
;
but
here
were
these
big
boobies
sticking
to
it
*NL*
and
taking
pride
in
it
clear
up
into
full
age
and
beyond
.
Yet
there
*NL*
was
something
very
engaging
about
these
great
simple-hearted
*NL*
creatures
,
something
attractive
and
lovable
.
There
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
be
brains
enough
in
the
entire
nursery
,
so
to
speak
,
to
bait
*NL*
a
fish-hook
with
;
but
you
did
n't
seem
to
mind
that
,
after
a
little
,
*NL*
because
you
soon
saw
that
brains
were
not
needed
in
a
society
*NL*
like
that
,
and
indeed
would
have
marred
it
,
hindered
it
,
spoiled
*NL*
its
symmetry
--
perhaps
rendered
its
existence
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
fine
manliness
observable
in
almost
every
face
;
and
*NL*
in
some
a
certain
loftiness
and
sweetness
that
rebuked
your
*NL*
belittling
criticisms
and
stilled
them
.
A
most
noble
benignity
*NL*
and
purity
reposed
in
the
countenance
of
him
they
called
Sir
Galahad
,
*NL*
and
likewise
in
the
king
's
also
;
and
there
was
majesty
and
greatness
*NL*
in
the
giant
frame
and
high
bearing
of
Sir
Launcelot
of
the
Lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
presently
an
incident
which
centered
the
general
interest
*NL*
upon
this
Sir
Launcelot
.
At
a
sign
from
a
sort
of
master
of
*NL*
ceremonies
,
six
or
eight
of
the
prisoners
rose
and
came
forward
*NL*
in
a
body
and
knelt
on
the
floor
and
lifted
up
their
hands
toward
*NL*
the
ladies
'
gallery
and
begged
the
grace
of
a
word
with
the
queen
.
*NL*
The
most
conspicuously
situated
lady
in
that
massed
flower-bed
*NL*
of
feminine
show
and
finery
inclined
her
head
by
way
of
assent
,
*NL*
and
then
the
spokesman
of
the
prisoners
delivered
himself
and
his
*NL*
fellows
into
her
hands
for
free
pardon
,
ransom
,
captivity
,
or
death
,
*NL*
as
she
in
her
good
pleasure
might
elect
;
and
this
,
as
he
said
,
he
*NL*
was
doing
by
command
of
Sir
Kay
the
Seneschal
,
whose
prisoners
*NL*
they
were
,
he
having
vanquished
them
by
his
single
might
and
*NL*
prowess
in
sturdy
conflict
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surprise
and
astonishment
flashed
from
face
to
face
all
over
*NL*
the
house
;
the
queen
's
gratified
smile
faded
out
at
the
name
of
*NL*
Sir
Kay
,
and
she
looked
disappointed
;
and
the
page
whispered
in
*NL*
my
ear
with
an
accent
and
manner
expressive
of
extravagant
derision
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
_
Kay
_
,
forsooth
!
Oh
,
call
me
pet
names
,
dearest
,
call
me
*NL*
a
marine
!
In
twice
a
thousand
years
shall
the
unholy
invention
*NL*
of
man
labor
at
odds
to
beget
the
fellow
to
this
majestic
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
eye
was
fastened
with
severe
inquiry
upon
Sir
Kay
.
But
he
*NL*
was
equal
to
the
occasion
.
He
got
up
and
played
his
hand
like
*NL*
a
major
--
and
took
every
trick
.
He
said
he
would
state
the
case
*NL*
exactly
according
to
the
facts
;
he
would
tell
the
simple
*NL*
straightforward
tale
,
without
comment
of
his
own
;
``
and
then
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
if
ye
find
glory
and
honor
due
,
ye
will
give
it
unto
him
*NL*
who
is
the
mightiest
man
of
his
hands
that
ever
bare
shield
or
*NL*
strake
with
sword
in
the
ranks
of
Christian
battle
--
even
him
that
*NL*
sitteth
there
!
''
and
he
pointed
to
Sir
Launcelot
.
Ah
,
he
fetched
*NL*
them
;
it
was
a
rattling
good
stroke
.
Then
he
went
on
and
told
*NL*
how
Sir
Launcelot
,
seeking
adventures
,
some
brief
time
gone
by
,
*NL*
killed
seven
giants
at
one
sweep
of
his
sword
,
and
set
a
hundred
*NL*
and
forty-two
captive
maidens
free
;
and
then
went
further
,
still
*NL*
seeking
adventures
,
and
found
him
-LRB-
Sir
Kay
-RRB-
fighting
a
desperate
*NL*
fight
against
nine
foreign
knights
,
and
straightway
took
the
battle
*NL*
solely
into
his
own
hands
,
and
conquered
the
nine
;
and
that
night
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
rose
quietly
,
and
dressed
him
in
Sir
Kay
's
armor
and
*NL*
took
Sir
Kay
's
horse
and
gat
him
away
into
distant
lands
,
and
*NL*
vanquished
sixteen
knights
in
one
pitched
battle
and
thirty-four
*NL*
in
another
;
and
all
these
and
the
former
nine
he
made
to
swear
*NL*
that
about
Whitsuntide
they
would
ride
to
Arthur
's
court
and
yield
*NL*
them
to
Queen
Guenever
's
hands
as
captives
of
Sir
Kay
the
Seneschal
,
*NL*
spoil
of
his
knightly
prowess
;
and
now
here
were
these
half
dozen
,
*NL*
and
the
rest
would
be
along
as
soon
as
they
might
be
healed
of
*NL*
their
desperate
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
touching
to
see
the
queen
blush
and
smile
,
and
look
*NL*
embarrassed
and
happy
,
and
fling
furtive
glances
at
Sir
Launcelot
*NL*
that
would
have
got
him
shot
in
Arkansas
,
to
a
dead
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
praised
the
valor
and
magnanimity
of
Sir
Launcelot
;
and
*NL*
as
for
me
,
I
was
perfectly
amazed
,
that
one
man
,
all
by
himself
,
*NL*
should
have
been
able
to
beat
down
and
capture
such
battalions
*NL*
of
practiced
fighters
.
I
said
as
much
to
Clarence
;
but
this
mocking
*NL*
featherhead
only
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
Sir
Kay
had
had
time
to
get
another
skin
of
sour
wine
into
him
,
*NL*
ye
had
seen
the
accompt
doubled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
at
the
boy
in
sorrow
;
and
as
I
looked
I
saw
the
cloud
of
*NL*
a
deep
despondency
settle
upon
his
countenance
.
I
followed
the
*NL*
direction
of
his
eye
,
and
saw
that
a
very
old
and
white-bearded
*NL*
man
,
clothed
in
a
flowing
black
gown
,
had
risen
and
was
standing
*NL*
at
the
table
upon
unsteady
legs
,
and
feebly
swaying
his
ancient
*NL*
head
and
surveying
the
company
with
his
watery
and
wandering
eye
.
*NL*
The
same
suffering
look
that
was
in
the
page
's
face
was
observable
*NL*
in
all
the
faces
around
--
the
look
of
dumb
creatures
who
know
that
*NL*
they
must
endure
and
make
no
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
we
shall
have
it
again
,
''
sighed
the
boy
;
``
that
same
old
*NL*
weary
tale
that
he
hath
told
a
thousand
times
in
the
same
words
,
*NL*
and
that
he
_
will
_
tell
till
he
dieth
,
every
time
he
hath
gotten
his
*NL*
barrel
full
and
feeleth
his
exaggeration-mill
a-working
.
Would
*NL*
God
I
had
died
or
I
saw
this
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merlin
,
the
mighty
liar
and
magician
,
perdition
singe
him
for
*NL*
the
weariness
he
worketh
with
his
one
tale
!
But
that
men
fear
*NL*
him
for
that
he
hath
the
storms
and
the
lightnings
and
all
the
*NL*
devils
that
be
in
hell
at
his
beck
and
call

they
would
have
dug
*NL*
his
entrails
out
these
many
years
ago
to
get
at
that
tale
and
*NL*
squelch
it
.
He
telleth
it
always
in
the
third
person
,
making
*NL*
believe
he
is
too
modest
to
glorify
himself
--
maledictions
light
*NL*
upon
him
,
misfortune

his
dole
!
Good
friend
,
prithee
call
me
*NL*
for
evensong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
nestled
himself
upon
my
shoulder
and
pretended
to
go
*NL*
to
sleep
.
The
old
man
began
his
tale
;
and
presently
the
lad
was
*NL*
asleep
in
reality
;
so
also
were
the
dogs
,
and
the
court
,
the
lackeys
,
*NL*
and
the
files
of
men-at-arms
.
The
droning
voice
droned
on
;
a
soft
*NL*
snoring
arose
on
all
sides
and
supported
it
like
a
deep
and
subdued
*NL*
accompaniment
of
wind
instruments
.
Some
heads
were
bowed
upon
*NL*
folded
arms
,
some
lay
back
with
open
mouths
that
issued
unconscious
*NL*
music
;
the
flies
buzzed
and
bit
,
unmolested
,
the
rats
swarmed
*NL*
softly
out
from
a
hundred
holes
,
and
pattered
about
,
and
made
*NL*
themselves
at
home
everywhere
;
and
one
of
them
sat
up
like
a
*NL*
squirrel
on
the
king
's
head
and
held
a
bit
of
cheese
in
its
hands
*NL*
and
nibbled
it
,
and
dribbled
the
crumbs
in
the
king
's
face
with
*NL*
naive
and
impudent
irreverence
.
It
was
a
tranquil
scene
,
and
*NL*
restful
to
the
weary
eye
and
the
jaded
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
old
man
's
tale
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
so
the
king
and
Merlin
departed
,
and
went
until
an
hermit
*NL*
that
was
a
good
man
and
a
great
leech
.
So
the
hermit
searched
*NL*
all
his
wounds
and
gave
him
good
salves
;
so
the
king
was
there
*NL*
three
days
,
and
then
were
his
wounds
well
amended
that
he
might
*NL*
ride
and
go
,
and
so
departed
.
And
as
they
rode
,
Arthur
said
,
*NL*
I
have
no
sword
.
No
force
,
*
-LSB-
*
Footnote
from
M.T.
:
No
matter
.
-RSB-
*NL*
said
Merlin
,
hereby
is
a
sword
that
shall
be
yours
and
I
may
.
*NL*
So
they
rode
till
they
came
to
a
lake
,
the
which
was
a
fair
water
*NL*
and
broad
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
lake
Arthur
was
ware
of
an
arm
*NL*
clothed
in
white
samite
,
that
held
a
fair
sword
in
that
hand
.
*NL*
Lo
,
said
Merlin
,
yonder
is
that
sword
that
I
spake
of
.
With
that
*NL*
they
saw
a
damsel
going
upon
the
lake
.
What
damsel
is
that
?
*NL*
said
Arthur
.
That
is
the
Lady
of
the
lake
,
said
Merlin
;
and
within
*NL*
that
lake
is
a
rock
,
and
therein
is
as
fair
a
place
as
any
on
earth
,
*NL*
and
richly
beseen
,
and
this
damsel
will
come
to
you
anon
,
and
then
*NL*
speak
ye
fair
to
her
that
she
will
give
you
that
sword
.
Anon
*NL*
withal
came
the
damsel
unto
Arthur
and
saluted
him
,
and
he
her
*NL*
again
.
Damsel
,
said
Arthur
,
what
sword
is
that
,
that
yonder
*NL*
the
arm
holdeth
above
the
water
?
I
would
it
were
mine
,
for
I
have
*NL*
no
sword
.
Sir
Arthur
King
,
said
the
damsel
,
that
sword
is
mine
,
*NL*
and
if
ye
will
give
me
a
gift
when
I
ask
it
you
,
ye
shall
have
it
.
*NL*
By
my
faith
,
said
Arthur
,
I
will
give
you
what
gift
ye
will
ask
.
*NL*
Well
,
said
the
damsel
,
go
ye
into
yonder
barge
and
row
yourself
*NL*
to
the
sword
,
and
take
it
and
the
scabbard
with
you
,
and
I
will
ask
*NL*
my
gift
when
I
see
my
time
.
So
Sir
Arthur
and
Merlin
alight
,
and
*NL*
tied
their
horses
to
two
trees
,
and
so
they
went
into
the
ship
,
*NL*
and
when
they
came
to
the
sword
that
the
hand
held
,
Sir
Arthur
*NL*
took
it
up
by
the
handles
,
and
took
it
with
him
.
And
the
arm
*NL*
and
the
hand
went
under
the
water
;
and
so
they
came
unto
the
land
*NL*
and
rode
forth
.
And
then
Sir
Arthur
saw
a
rich
pavilion
.
What
*NL*
signifieth
yonder
pavilion
?
It
is
the
knight
's
pavilion
,
said
*NL*
Merlin
,
that
ye
fought
with
last
,
Sir
Pellinore
,
but
he
is
out
,
*NL*
he
is
not
there
;
he
hath
ado
with
a
knight
of
yours
,
that
hight
*NL*
Egglame
,
and
they
have
fought
together
,
but
at
the
last
Egglame
*NL*
fled
,
and
else
he
had
been
dead
,
and
he
hath
chased
him
even
*NL*
to
Carlion
,
and
we
shall
meet
with
him
anon
in
the
highway
.
That
*NL*
is
well
said
,
said
Arthur
,
now
have
I
a
sword
,
now
will
I
wage
*NL*
battle
with
him
,
and
be
avenged
on
him
.
Sir
,
ye
shall
not
so
,
*NL*
said
Merlin
,
for
the
knight
is
weary
of
fighting
and
chasing
,
so
*NL*
that
ye
shall
have
no
worship
to
have
ado
with
him
;
also
,
he
will
*NL*
not
lightly
be
matched
of
one
knight
living
;
and
therefore
it
is
my
*NL*
counsel
,
let
him
pass
,
for
he
shall
do
you
good
service
in
short
*NL*
time
,
and
his
sons
,
after
his
days
.
Also
ye
shall
see
that
day
*NL*
in
short
space
ye
shall
be
right
glad
to
give
him
your
sister
*NL*
to
wed.
.
When
I
see
him
,
I
will
do
as
ye
advise
me
,
said
Arthur
.
*NL*
Then
Sir
Arthur
looked
on
the
sword
,
and
liked
it
passing
well
.
*NL*
Whether
liketh
you
better
,
said
Merlin
,
the
sword
or
the
scabbard
?
*NL*
Me
liketh
better
the
sword
,
said
Arthur
.
Ye
are
more
unwise
,
*NL*
said
Merlin
,
for
the
scabbard
is
worth
ten
of
the
sword
,
for
while
*NL*
ye
have
the
scabbard
upon
you
ye
shall
never
lose
no
blood
,
be
ye
*NL*
never
so
sore
wounded
;
therefore
,
keep
well
the
scabbard
always
*NL*
with
you
.
So
they
rode
into
Carlion
,
and
by
the
way
they
met
with
*NL*
Sir
Pellinore
;
but
Merlin
had
done
such
a
craft
that
Pellinore
saw
*NL*
not
Arthur
,
and
he
passed
by
without
any
words
.
I
marvel
,
said
*NL*
Arthur
,
that
the
knight
would
not
speak
.
Sir
,
said
Merlin
,
he
saw
*NL*
you
not
;
for
and
he
had
seen
you
ye
had
not
lightly
departed
.
So
*NL*
they
came
unto
Carlion
,
whereof
his
knights
were
passing
glad
.
*NL*
And
when
they
heard
of
his
adventures
they
marveled
that
he
would
*NL*
jeopard
his
person
so
alone
.
But
all
men
of
worship
said
it
was
*NL*
merry
to
be
under
such
a
chieftain
that
would
put
his
person
in
*NL*
adventure
as
other
poor
knights
did
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
SIR
DINADAN
THE
HUMORIST
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
me
that
this
quaint
lie
was
most
simply
and
beautifully
*NL*
told
;
but
then
I
had
heard
it
only
once
,
and
that
makes
a
difference
;
*NL*
it
was
pleasant
to
the
others
when
it
was
fresh
,
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Dinadan
the
Humorist
was
the
first
to
awake
,
and
he
soon
roused
*NL*
the
rest
with
a
practical
joke
of
a
sufficiently
poor
quality
.
*NL*
He
tied
some
metal
mugs
to
a
dog
's
tail
and
turned
him
loose
,
*NL*
and
he
tore
around
and
around
the
place
in
a
frenzy
of
fright
,
*NL*
with
all
the
other
dogs
bellowing
after
him
and
battering
and
*NL*
crashing
against
everything
that
came
in
their
way
and
making
*NL*
altogether
a
chaos
of
confusion
and
a
most
deafening
din
and
*NL*
turmoil
;
at
which
every
man
and
woman
of
the
multitude
laughed
*NL*
till
the
tears
flowed
,
and
some
fell
out
of
their
chairs
and
*NL*
wallowed
on
the
floor
in
ecstasy
.
It
was
just
like
so
many
children
.
*NL*
Sir
Dinadan
was
so
proud
of
his
exploit
that
he
could
not
keep
*NL*
from
telling
over
and
over
again
,
to
weariness
,
how
the
immortal
*NL*
idea
happened
to
occur
to
him
;
and
as
is
the
way
with
humorists
*NL*
of
his
breed
,
he
was
still
laughing
at
it
after
everybody
else
had
*NL*
got
through
.
He
was
so
set
up
that
he
concluded
to
make
a
speech
*NL*
--
of
course
a
humorous
speech
.
I
think
I
never
heard
so
many
old
*NL*
played-out
jokes
strung
together
in
my
life
.
He
was
worse
than
*NL*
the
minstrels
,
worse
than
the
clown
in
the
circus
.
It
seemed
*NL*
peculiarly
sad
to
sit
here
,
thirteen
hundred
years
before
I
was
*NL*
born
,
and
listen
again
to
poor
,
flat
,
worm-eaten
jokes
that
had
*NL*
given
me
the
dry
gripes
when
I
was
a
boy
thirteen
hundred
years
*NL*
afterwards
.
It
about
convinced
me
that
there
is
n't
any
such
thing
*NL*
as
a
new
joke
possible
.
Everybody
laughed
at
these
antiquities
*NL*
--
but
then
they
always
do
;
I
had
noticed
that
,
centuries
later
.
*NL*
However
,
of
course
the
scoffer
did
n't
laugh
--
I
mean
the
boy
.
No
,
*NL*
he
scoffed
;
there
was
n't
anything
he
would
n't
scoff
at
.
He
said
*NL*
the
most
of
Sir
Dinadan
's
jokes
were
rotten
and
the
rest
were
*NL*
petrified
.
I
said
``
petrified
''
was
good
;
as
I
believed
,
myself
,
*NL*
that
the
only
right
way
to
classify
the
majestic
ages
of
some
of
*NL*
those
jokes
was
by
geologic
periods
.
But
that
neat
idea
hit
*NL*
the
boy
in
a
blank
place
,
for
geology
had
n't
been
invented
yet
.
*NL*
However
,
I
made
a
note
of
the
remark
,
and
calculated
to
educate
*NL*
the
commonwealth
up
to
it
if
I
pulled
through
.
It
is
no
use
*NL*
to
throw
a
good
thing
away
merely
because
the
market
is
n't
ripe
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Sir
Kay
arose
and
began
to
fire
up
on
his
history-mill
with
me
*NL*
for
fuel
.
It
was
time
for
me
to
feel
serious
,
and
I
did
.
Sir
Kay
*NL*
told
how
he
had
encountered
me
in
a
far
land
of
barbarians
,
who
*NL*
all
wore
the
same
ridiculous
garb
that
I
did
--
a
garb
that
was
a
work
*NL*
of
enchantment
,
and
intended
to
make
the
wearer
secure
from
hurt
*NL*
by
human
hands
.
However
he
had
nullified
the
force
of
the
*NL*
enchantment
by
prayer
,
and
had
killed
my
thirteen
knights
in
*NL*
a
three
hours
'
battle
,
and
taken
me
prisoner
,
sparing
my
life
*NL*
in
order
that
so
strange
a
curiosity
as
I
was
might
be
exhibited
*NL*
to
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
the
king
and
the
court
.
He
spoke
*NL*
of
me
all
the
time
,
in
the
blandest
way
,
as
``
this
prodigious
giant
,
''
*NL*
and
``
this
horrible
sky-towering
monster
,
''
and
``
this
tusked
and
*NL*
taloned
man-devouring
ogre
''
,
and
everybody
took
in
all
this
bosh
*NL*
in
the
naivest
way
,
and
never
smiled
or
seemed
to
notice
that
*NL*
there
was
any
discrepancy
between
these
watered
statistics
and
me
.
*NL*
He
said
that
in
trying
to
escape
from
him
I
sprang
into
the
top
of
*NL*
a
tree
two
hundred
cubits
high
at
a
single
bound
,
but
he
dislodged
*NL*
me
with
a
stone
the
size
of
a
cow
,
which
``
all-to
brast
''
the
most
*NL*
of
my
bones
,
and
then
swore
me
to
appear
at
Arthur
's
court
for
*NL*
sentence
.
He
ended
by
condemning
me
to
die
at
noon
on
the
21st
;
*NL*
and
was
so
little
concerned
about
it
that
he
stopped
to
yawn
before
*NL*
he
named
the
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
in
a
dismal
state
by
this
time
;
indeed
,
I
was
hardly
enough
*NL*
in
my
right
mind
to
keep
the
run
of
a
dispute
that
sprung
up
as
*NL*
to
how
I
had
better
be
killed
,
the
possibility
of
the
killing
being
*NL*
doubted
by
some
,
because
of
the
enchantment
in
my
clothes
.
And
yet
*NL*
it
was
nothing
but
an
ordinary
suit
of
fifteen-dollar
slop-shops
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
was
sane
enough
to
notice
this
detail
,
to
wit
:
many
of
*NL*
the
terms
used
in
the
most
matter-of-fact
way
by
this
great
*NL*
assemblage
of
the
first
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
land
would
*NL*
have
made
a
Comanche
blush
.
Indelicacy
is
too
mild
a
term
to
convey
*NL*
the
idea
.
However
,
I
had
read
``
Tom
Jones
,
''
and
``
Roderick
Random
,
''
*NL*
and
other
books
of
that
kind
,
and
knew
that
the
highest
and
first
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
England
had
remained
little
or
no
cleaner
*NL*
in
their
talk
,
and
in
the
morals
and
conduct
which
such
talk
*NL*
implies
,
clear
up
to
a
hundred
years
ago
;
in
fact
clear
into
our
*NL*
own
nineteenth
century
--
in
which
century
,
broadly
speaking
,
*NL*
the
earliest
samples
of
the
real
lady
and
real
gentleman
discoverable
*NL*
in
English
history
--
or
in
European
history
,
for
that
matter
--
may
be
*NL*
said
to
have
made
their
appearance
.
Suppose
Sir
Walter
,
instead
*NL*
of
putting
the
conversations
into
the
mouths
of
his
characters
,
*NL*
had
allowed
the
characters
to
speak
for
themselves
?
We
should
*NL*
have
had
talk
from
Rebecca
and
Ivanhoe
and
the
soft
lady
Rowena
*NL*
which
would
embarrass
a
tramp
in
our
day
.
However
,
to
the
*NL*
unconsciously
indelicate
all
things
are
delicate
.
King
Arthur
's
*NL*
people
were
not
aware
that
they
were
indecent
and
I
had
presence
*NL*
of
mind
enough
not
to
mention
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
so
troubled
about
my
enchanted
clothes
that
they
were
*NL*
mightily
relieved
,
at
last
,
when
old
Merlin
swept
the
difficulty
*NL*
away
for
them
with
a
common-sense
hint
.
He
asked
them
why
they
*NL*
were
so
dull
--
why
did
n't
it
occur
to
them
to
strip
me
.
In
half
a
*NL*
minute
I
was
as
naked
as
a
pair
of
tongs
!
And
dear
,
dear
,
to
think
*NL*
of
it
:
I
was
the
only
embarrassed
person
there
.
Everybody
discussed
*NL*
me
;
and
did
it
as
unconcernedly
as
if
I
had
been
a
cabbage
.
*NL*
Queen
Guenever
was
as
naively
interested
as
the
rest
,
and
said
*NL*
she
had
never
seen
anybody
with
legs
just
like
mine
before
.
It
was
*NL*
the
only
compliment
I
got
--
if
it
was
a
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
I
was
carried
off
in
one
direction
,
and
my
perilous
clothes
*NL*
in
another
.
I
was
shoved
into
a
dark
and
narrow
cell
in
a
dungeon
,
*NL*
with
some
scant
remnants
for
dinner
,
some
moldy
straw
for
a
bed
,
*NL*
and
no
end
of
rats
for
company
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
AN
INSPIRATION
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
so
tired
that
even
my
fears
were
not
able
to
keep
me
awake
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
next
came
to
myself
,
I
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
a
very
*NL*
long
time
.
My
first
thought
was
,
``
Well
,
what
an
astonishing
dream
*NL*
I
've
had
!
I
reckon
I
've
waked
only
just
in
time
to
keep
from
*NL*
being
hanged
or
drowned
or
burned
or
something
...
I
'll
nap
again
*NL*
till
the
whistle
blows
,
and
then
I
'll
go
down
to
the
arms
factory
*NL*
and
have
it
out
with
Hercules
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
then
I
heard
the
harsh
music
of
rusty
chains
and
bolts
,
*NL*
a
light
flashed
in
my
eyes
,
and
that
butterfly
,
Clarence
,
stood
*NL*
before
me
!
I
gasped
with
surprise
;
my
breath
almost
got
away
from
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
I
said
,
``
you
here
yet
?
Go
along
with
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
dream
!
scatter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
only
laughed
,
in
his
light-hearted
way
,
and
fell
to
making
*NL*
fun
of
my
sorry
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
I
said
resignedly
,
``
let
the
dream
go
on
;
I
'm
in
no
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prithee
what
dream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dream
?
Why
,
the
dream
that
I
am
in
Arthur
's
court
--
a
person
*NL*
who
never
existed
;
and
that
I
am
talking
to
you
,
who
are
nothing
*NL*
but
a
work
of
the
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
la
,
indeed
!
and
is
it
a
dream
that
you
're
to
be
burned
*NL*
to-morrow
?
Ho-ho
--
answer
me
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shock
that
went
through
me
was
distressing
.
I
now
began
*NL*
to
reason
that
my
situation
was
in
the
last
degree
serious
,
dream
*NL*
or
no
dream
;
for
I
knew
by
past
experience
of
the
lifelike
intensity
*NL*
of
dreams
,
that
to
be
burned
to
death
,
even
in
a
dream
,
would
be
*NL*
very
far
from
being
a
jest
,
and
was
a
thing
to
be
avoided
,
by
any
*NL*
means
,
fair
or
foul
,
that
I
could
contrive
.
So
I
said
beseechingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Clarence
,
good
boy
,
only
friend
I
've
got
,
--
for
you
_
are
_
my
*NL*
friend
,
are
n't
you
?
--
do
n't
fail
me
;
help
me
to
devise
some
way
*NL*
of
escaping
from
this
place
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
but
hear
thyself
!
Escape
?
Why
,
man
,
the
corridors
are
*NL*
in
guard
and
keep
of
men-at-arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
.
But
how
many
,
Clarence
?
Not
many
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Full
a
score
.
One
may
not
hope
to
escape
.
''
After
a
pause
*NL*
--
hesitatingly
:
``
and
there
be
other
reasons
--
and
weightier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
ones
?
What
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
say
--
oh
,
but
I
dare
n't
,
indeed
dare
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
poor
lad
,
what
is
the
matter
?
Why
do
you
blench
?
Why
do
*NL*
you
tremble
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
in
sooth
,
there
is
need
!
I
do
want
to
tell
you
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
be
brave
,
be
a
man
--
speak
out
,
there
's
a
good
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
,
pulled
one
way
by
desire
,
the
other
way
by
fear
;
*NL*
then
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
out
,
listening
;
and
finally
*NL*
crept
close
to
me
and
put
his
mouth
to
my
ear
and
told
me
his
*NL*
fearful
news
in
a
whisper
,
and
with
all
the
cowering
apprehension
*NL*
of
one
who
was
venturing
upon
awful
ground
and
speaking
of
things
*NL*
whose
very
mention
might
be
freighted
with
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merlin
,
in
his
malice
,
has
woven
a
spell
about
this
dungeon
,
and
*NL*
there
bides
not
the
man
in
these
kingdoms
that
would
be
desperate
*NL*
enough
to
essay
to
cross
its
lines
with
you
!
Now
God
pity
me
,
*NL*
I
have
told
it
!
Ah
,
be
kind
to
me
,
be
merciful
to
a
poor
boy
who
*NL*
means
thee
well
;
for
an
thou
betray
me
I
am
lost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
laughed
the
only
really
refreshing
laugh
I
had
had
for
some
time
;
*NL*
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merlin
has
wrought
a
spell
!
_
Merlin
_
,
forsooth
!
That
cheap
old
*NL*
humbug
,
that
maundering
old
ass
?
Bosh
,
pure
bosh
,
the
silliest
bosh
*NL*
in
the
world
!
Why
,
it
does
seem
to
me
that
of
all
the
childish
,
*NL*
idiotic
,
chuckle-headed
,
chicken-livered
superstitions
that
ev
*NL*
--
oh
,
damn
Merlin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clarence
had
slumped
to
his
knees
before
I
had
half
finished
,
*NL*
and
he
was
like
to
go
out
of
his
mind
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
beware
!
These
are
awful
words
!
Any
moment
these
walls
*NL*
may
crumble
upon
us
if
you
say
such
things
.
Oh
call
them
back
*NL*
before
it
is
too
late
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
strange
exhibition
gave
me
a
good
idea
and
set
me
to
*NL*
thinking
.
If
everybody
about
here
was
so
honestly
and
sincerely
*NL*
afraid
of
Merlin
's
pretended
magic
as
Clarence
was
,
certainly
*NL*
a
superior
man
like
me
ought
to
be
shrewd
enough
to
contrive
*NL*
some
way
to
take
advantage
of
such
a
state
of
things
.
I
went
*NL*
on
thinking
,
and
worked
out
a
plan
.
Then
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
.
Pull
yourself
together
;
look
me
in
the
eye
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
why
I
laughed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
but
for
our
blessed
Lady
's
sake
,
do
it
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
laughed
.
Because
I
'm
a
magician
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
!
''
The
boy
recoiled
a
step
,
and
caught
his
breath
,
for
*NL*
the
thing
hit
him
rather
sudden
;
but
the
aspect
which
he
took
*NL*
on
was
very
,
very
respectful
.
I
took
quick
note
of
that
;
it
*NL*
indicated
that
a
humbug
did
n't
need
to
have
a
reputation
in
this
*NL*
asylum
;
people
stood
ready
to
take
him
at
his
word
,
without
that
.
*NL*
I
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
Merlin
seven
hundred
years
,
and
he
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
hun
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
interrupt
me
.
He
has
died
and
come
alive
again
thirteen
*NL*
times
,
and
traveled
under
a
new
name
every
time
:
Smith
,
Jones
,
*NL*
Robinson
,
Jackson
,
Peters
,
Haskins
,
Merlin
--
a
new
alias
every
*NL*
time
he
turns
up
.
I
knew
him
in
Egypt
three
hundred
years
ago
;
*NL*
I
knew
him
in
India
five
hundred
years
ago
--
he
is
always
blethering
*NL*
around
in
my
way
,
everywhere
I
go
;
he
makes
me
tired
.
He
do
n't
*NL*
amount
to
shucks
,
as
a
magician
;
knows
some
of
the
old
common
*NL*
tricks
,
but
has
never
got
beyond
the
rudiments
,
and
never
will
.
*NL*
He
is
well
enough
for
the
provinces
--
one-night
stands
and
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing

you
know

but
dear
me
,

he
_
ought
n't
to
set
up
for
*NL*
an
expert
--
anyway
not
where
there
's
a
real
artist
.
Now
look
here
,
*NL*
Clarence
,
I
am
going
to
stand
your
friend
,
right
along
,
and
in
*NL*
return
you
must
be
mine
.
I
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
.
I
want
*NL*
you
to
get
word
to
the
king
that
I
am
a
magician
myself
--
and
the
*NL*
Supreme
Grand
High-yu-Muck-amuck
and
head
of
the
tribe
,
at
that
;
*NL*
and
I
want
him
to
be
made
to
understand
that
I
am
just
quietly
*NL*
arranging
a
little
calamity
here
that
will
make
the
fur
fly
in
these
*NL*
realms
if
Sir
Kay
's
project
is
carried
out
and
any
harm
comes
*NL*
to
me
.
Will
you
get
that
to
the
king
for
me
?

The
poor
boy
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
could
hardly
answer
me
.
*NL*
It
was
pitiful
to
see
a
creature
so
terrified
,
so
unnerved
,
so
*NL*
demoralized
.
But
he
promised
everything
;
and
on
my
side
he
made
*NL*
me
promise
over
and
over
again
that
I
would
remain
his
friend
,
and
*NL*
never
turn
against
him
or
cast
any
enchantments
upon
him
.
Then
*NL*
he
worked
his
way
out
,
staying
himself
with
his
hand
along
the
*NL*
wall
,
like
a
sick
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
this
thought
occurred
to
me
:
how
heedless
I
have
been
!
*NL*
When
the
boy
gets
calm
,
he
will
wonder
why
a
great
magician
like
me
*NL*
should
have
begged
a
boy
like
him
to
help
me
get
out
of
this
place
;
*NL*
he
will
put
this
and
that
together
,
and
will
see
that
I
am
a
humbug
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
worried
over
that
heedless
blunder
for
an
hour
,
and
called
myself
*NL*
a
great
many
hard
names
,
meantime
.
But
finally
it
occurred
to
me
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
that
these
animals
did
n't
reason
;
that
_
they
_
never
*NL*
put
this
and
that
together
;
that
all
their
talk
showed
that
they
*NL*
did
n't
know
a
discrepancy
when
they
saw
it
.
I
was
at
rest
,
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
one
is
at
rest
,
in
this
world
,
off
he
goes
on
*NL*
something
else
to
worry
about
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
I
had
made
*NL*
another
blunder
:
I
had
sent
the
boy
off
to
alarm
his
betters
with
*NL*
a
threat
--
I
intending
to
invent
a
calamity
at
my
leisure
;
now
*NL*
the
people
who
are
the
readiest
and
eagerest
and
willingest
to
*NL*
swallow
miracles
are
the
very
ones
who
are
hungriest
to
see
you
*NL*
perform
them
;
suppose
I
should
be
called
on
for
a
sample
?
Suppose
*NL*
I
should
be
asked
to
name
my
calamity
?
Yes
,
I
had
made
a
blunder
;
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
invented
my
calamity
first
.
``
What
shall
I
do
?
*NL*
what
can
I
say
,
to
gain
a
little
time
?
''
I
was
in
trouble
again
;
*NL*
in
the
deepest
kind
of
trouble
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
footstep
!
--
they
're
coming
.
If
I
had
only
just
a
moment
*NL*
to
think
...
Good
,
I
've
got
it
.
I
'm
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
it
was
the
eclipse
.
It
came
into
my
mind
in
the
nick
*NL*
of
time
,
how
Columbus
,
or
Cortez
,
or
one
of
those
people
,
played
*NL*
an
eclipse
as
a
saving
trump
once
,
on
some
savages
,
and
I
saw
my
*NL*
chance
.
I
could
play
it
myself
,
now
,
and
it
would
n't
be
any
*NL*
plagiarism
,
either
,
because
I
should
get
it
in
nearly
a
thousand
*NL*
years
ahead
of
those
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clarence
came
in
,
subdued
,
distressed
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hasted
the
message
to
our
liege
the
king
,
and
straightway
he
*NL*
had
me
to
his
presence
.
He
was
frighted
even
to
the
marrow
,
*NL*
and
was
minded
to
give
order
for
your
instant
enlargement
,
and
*NL*
that
you
be
clothed
in
fine
raiment
and
lodged
as
befitted
one
so
*NL*
great
;
but
then
came
Merlin
and
spoiled
all
;
for
he
persuaded
*NL*
the
king
that
you
are
mad
,
and
know
not
whereof
you
speak
;
and
*NL*
said
your
threat
is
but
foolishness
and
idle
vaporing
.
They
*NL*
disputed
long
,
but
in
the
end
,
Merlin
,
scoffing
,
said
,
`
Wherefore
*NL*
hath
he
not
_
named
_
his
brave
calamity
?
Verily
it
is
because
he
*NL*
can
not
.
'
This
thrust
did
in
a
most
sudden
sort
close
the
king
's
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
could
offer
naught
to
turn
the
argument
;
and
so
,
*NL*
reluctant
,
and
full
loth
to
do
you
the
discourtesy
,
he
yet
prayeth
*NL*
you
to
consider
his
perplexed
case
,
as
noting
how
the
matter
stands
,
*NL*
and
name
the
calamity
--
if
so
be
you
have
determined
the
nature
*NL*
of
it
and
the
time
of
its
coming
.
Oh
,
prithee
delay
not
;
to
delay
*NL*
at
such
a
time
were
to
double
and
treble
the
perils
that
already
*NL*
compass
thee
about
.
Oh
,
be
thou
wise
--
name
the
calamity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
allowed
silence
to
accumulate
while
I
got
my
impressiveness
*NL*
together
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
I
been
shut
up
in
this
hole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
were
shut
up
when
yesterday
was
well
spent
.
It
is
9
of
*NL*
the
morning
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Then
I
have
slept
well
,
sure
enough
.
Nine
in
the
morning
*NL*
now
!
And
yet
it
is
the
very
complexion
of
midnight
,
to
a
shade
.
*NL*
This
is
the
20th
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
20th
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
to
be
burned
alive
to-morrow
.
''
The
boy
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
high
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
I
will
tell
you
what
to
say
.
''
I
paused
,
and
stood
over
*NL*
that
cowering
lad
a
whole
minute
in
awful
silence
;
then
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
deep
,
measured
,
charged
with
doom
,
I
began
,
and
rose
by
dramatically
*NL*
graded
stages
to
my
colossal
climax
,
which
I
delivered
in
as
sublime
*NL*
and
noble
a
way
as
ever
I
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
:
``
Go
back
*NL*
and
tell
the
king
that
at
that
hour
I
will
smother
the
whole
world
*NL*
in
the
dead
blackness
of
midnight
;
I
will
blot
out
the
sun
,
and
he
*NL*
shall
never
shine
again
;
the
fruits
of
the
earth
shall
rot
for
lack
*NL*
of
light
and
warmth
,
and
the
peoples
of
the
earth
shall
famish
*NL*
and
die
,
to
the
last
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
carry
the
boy
out
myself
,
he
sunk
into
such
a
collapse
.
*NL*
I
handed
him
over
to
the
soldiers
,
and
went
back
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
ECLIPSE
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
,
realization
soon
began
to
*NL*
supplement
knowledge
.
The
mere
knowledge
of
a
fact
is
pale
;
but
*NL*
when
you
come
to
_
realize
_
your
fact
,
it
takes
on
color
.
It
is
*NL*
all
the
difference
between
hearing
of
a
man
being
stabbed
to
*NL*
the
heart
,
and
seeing
it
done
.
In
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
,
*NL*
the
knowledge
that
I
was
in
deadly
danger
took
to
itself
deeper
*NL*
and
deeper
meaning
all
the
time
;
a
something
which
was
realization
*NL*
crept
inch
by
inch
through
my
veins
and
turned
me
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
a
blessed
provision
of
nature
that
at
times
like
these
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
a
man
's
mercury
has
got
down
to
a
certain
point
there
*NL*
comes
a
revulsion
,
and
he
rallies
.
Hope
springs
up
,
and
cheerfulness
*NL*
along
with
it
,
and
then
he
is
in
good
shape
to
do
something
for
*NL*
himself
,
if
anything
can
be
done
.
When
my
rally
came
,
it
came
with
*NL*
a
bound
.
I
said
to
myself
that
my
eclipse
would
be
sure
to
save
me
,
*NL*
and
make
me
the
greatest
man
in
the
kingdom
besides
;
and
straightway
*NL*
my
mercury
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
tube
,
and
my
solicitudes
*NL*
all
vanished
.
I
was
as
happy
a
man
as
there
was
in
the
world
.
*NL*
I
was
even
impatient
for
to-morrow
to
come
,
I
so
wanted
to
gather
*NL*
in
that
great
triumph
and
be
the
center
of
all
the
nation
's
wonder
*NL*
and
reverence
.
Besides
,
in
a
business
way
it
would
be
the
making
*NL*
of
me
;
I
knew
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
there
was
one
thing
which
had
got
pushed
into
the
background
*NL*
of
my
mind
.
That
was
the
half-conviction
that
when
the
nature
*NL*
of
my
proposed
calamity
should
be
reported
to
those
superstitious
*NL*
people
,
it
would
have
such
an
effect
that
they
would
want
to
*NL*
compromise
.
So
,
by
and
by
when
I
heard
footsteps
coming
,
that
*NL*
thought
was
recalled
to
me
,
and
I
said
to
myself
,
``
As
sure
as
*NL*
anything
,
it
's
the
compromise
.
Well
,
if
it
is
good
,
all
right
,
*NL*
I
will
accept
;
but
if
it
is
n't
,
I
mean
to
stand
my
ground
and
play
*NL*
my
hand
for
all
it
is
worth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
some
men-at-arms
appeared
.
The
leader
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stake
is
ready
.
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stake
!
The
strength
went
out
of
me
,
and
I
almost
fell
down
.
*NL*
It
is
hard
to
get
one
's
breath
at
such
a
time
,
such
lumps
come
into
*NL*
one
's
throat
,
and
such
gaspings
;
but
as
soon
as
I
could
speak
,
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
a
mistake
--
the
execution
is
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Order
changed
;
been
set
forward
a
day
.
Haste
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
lost
.
There
was
no
help
for
me
.
I
was
dazed
,
stupefied
;
*NL*
I
had
no
command
over
myself
,
I
only
wandered
purposely
about
,
*NL*
like
one
out
of
his
mind
;
so
the
soldiers
took
hold
of
me
,
and
*NL*
pulled
me
along
with
them
,
out
of
the
cell
and
along
the
maze
of
*NL*
underground
corridors
,
and
finally
into
the
fierce
glare
of
daylight
*NL*
and
the
upper
world
.
As
we
stepped
into
the
vast
enclosed
court
*NL*
of
the
castle
I
got
a
shock
;
for
the
first
thing
I
saw
was
the
stake
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
center
,
and
near
it
the
piled
fagots
and
a
monk
.
*NL*
On
all
four
sides
of
the
court
the
seated
multitudes
rose
rank
*NL*
above
rank
,
forming
sloping
terraces
that
were
rich
with
color
.
*NL*
The
king
and
the
queen
sat
in
their
thrones
,
the
most
conspicuous
*NL*
figures
there
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
note
all
this
,
occupied
but
a
second
.
The
next
second
Clarence
*NL*
had
slipped
from
some
place
of
concealment
and
was
pouring
news
*NL*
into
my
ear
,
his
eyes
beaming
with
triumph
and
gladness
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tis
through
_
me
_
the
change
was
wrought
!
And
main
hard
have
I
worked
*NL*
to
do
it
,
too
.
But
when
I
revealed
to
them
the
calamity
in
store
,
*NL*
and
saw
how
mighty
was
the
terror
it
did
engender
,
then
saw
I
also
*NL*
that
this
was
the
time
to
strike
!
Wherefore
I
diligently
pretended
,
*NL*
unto
this
and
that
and
the
other
one
,
that
your
power
against
the
sun
*NL*
could
not
reach
its
full
until
the
morrow
;
and
so
if
any
would
save
*NL*
the
sun
and
the
world
,
you
must
be
slain
to-day
,
while
your
*NL*
enchantments
are
but
in
the
weaving
and
lack
potency
.
Odsbodikins
,
*NL*
it
was
but
a
dull
lie
,
a
most
indifferent
invention
,
but
you
should
*NL*
have
seen
them
seize
it
and
swallow
it
,
in
the
frenzy
of
their
*NL*
fright
,
as
it
were
salvation
sent
from
heaven
;
and
all
the
while
*NL*
was
I
laughing
in
my
sleeve
the
one
moment
,
to
see
them
so
cheaply
*NL*
deceived
,
and
glorifying
God
the
next
,
that
He
was
content
to
let
*NL*
the
meanest
of
His
creatures
be
His
instrument
to
the
saving
of
*NL*
thy
life
.
Ah
how
happy
has
the
matter
sped
!
You
will
not
need
*NL*
to
do
the
sun
a
_
real
_
hurt
--
ah
,
forget
not
that
,
on
your
soul
forget
*NL*
it
not
!
Only
make
a
little
darkness
--
only
the
littlest
little
*NL*
darkness
,
mind
,
and
cease
with
that
.
It
will
be
sufficient
.
They
*NL*
will
see
that
I
spoke
falsely
,
--
being
ignorant
,
as
they
will
fancy
*NL*
--
and
with
the
falling
of
the
first
shadow
of
that
darkness
you
*NL*
shall
see
them
go
mad
with
fear
;
and
they
will
set
you
free
and
*NL*
make
you
great
!
Go
to
thy
triumph
,
now
!
But
remember
--
ah
,
good
*NL*
friend
,
I
implore
thee
remember
my
supplication
,
and
do
the
blessed
*NL*
sun
no
hurt
.
For
_
my
_
sake
,
thy
true
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
choked
out
some
words
through
my
grief
and
misery
;
as
much
as
*NL*
to
say
I
would
spare
the
sun
;
for
which
the
lad
's
eyes
paid
me
back
*NL*
with
such
deep
and
loving
gratitude
that
I
had
not
the
heart
*NL*
to
tell
him
his
good-hearted
foolishness
had
ruined
me
and
sent
me
*NL*
to
my
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
soldiers
assisted
me
across
the
court
the
stillness
was
*NL*
so
profound
that
if
I
had
been
blindfold
I
should
have
supposed
*NL*
I
was
in
a
solitude
instead
of
walled
in
by
four
thousand
people
.
*NL*
There
was
not
a
movement
perceptible
in
those
masses
of
humanity
;
*NL*
they
were
as
rigid
as
stone
images
,
and
as
pale
;
and
dread
sat
*NL*
upon
every
countenance
.
This
hush
continued
while
I
was
being
*NL*
chained
to
the
stake
;
it
still
continued
while
the
fagots
were
*NL*
carefully
and
tediously
piled
about
my
ankles
,
my
knees
,
my
thighs
,
*NL*
my
body
.
Then
there
was
a
pause
,
and
a
deeper
hush
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
and
a
man
knelt
down
at
my
feet
with
a
blazing
torch
;
the
multitude
*NL*
strained
forward
,
gazing
,
and
parting
slightly
from
their
seats
*NL*
without
knowing
it
;
the
monk
raised
his
hands
above
my
head
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
toward
the
blue
sky
,
and
began
some
words
in
Latin
;
in
*NL*
this
attitude
he
droned
on
and
on
,
a
little
while
,
and
then
stopped
.
*NL*
I
waited
two
or
three
moments
;
then
looked
up
;
he
was
standing
*NL*
there
petrified
.
With
a
common
impulse
the
multitude
rose
slowly
*NL*
up
and
stared
into
the
sky
.
I
followed
their
eyes
,
as
sure
as
guns
,
*NL*
there
was
my
eclipse
beginning
!
The
life
went
boiling
through
*NL*
my
veins
;
I
was
a
new
man
!
The
rim
of
black
spread
slowly
into
*NL*
the
sun
's
disk
,
my
heart
beat
higher
and
higher
,
and
still
the
*NL*
assemblage
and
the
priest
stared
into
the
sky
,
motionless
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
this
gaze
would
be
turned
upon
me
,
next
.
When
it
was
,
I
was
*NL*
ready
.
I
was
in
one
of
the
most
grand
attitudes
I
ever
struck
,
*NL*
with
my
arm
stretched
up
pointing
to
the
sun
.
It
was
a
noble
*NL*
effect
.
You
could
_
see
_
the
shudder
sweep
the
mass
like
a
wave
.
*NL*
Two
shouts
rang
out
,
one
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
other
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apply
the
torch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forbid
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
was
from
Merlin
,
the
other
from
the
king
.
Merlin
started
*NL*
from
his
place
--
to
apply
the
torch
himself
,
I
judged
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
where
you
are
.
If
any
man
moves
--
even
the
king
--
before
*NL*
I
give
him
leave
,
I
will
blast
him
with
thunder
,
I
will
consume
*NL*
him
with
lightnings
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
multitude
sank
meekly
into
their
seats
,
and
I
was
just
expecting
*NL*
they
would
.
Merlin
hesitated
a
moment
or
two
,
and
I
was
on
pins
*NL*
and
needles
during
that
little
while
.
Then
he
sat
down
,
and
I
took
*NL*
a
good
breath
;
for
I
knew
I
was
master
of
the
situation
now
.
*NL*
The
king
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
merciful
,
fair
sir
,
and
essay
no
further
in
this
perilous
matter
,
*NL*
lest
disaster
follow
.
It
was
reported
to
us
that
your
powers
could
*NL*
not
attain
unto
their
full
strength
until
the
morrow
;
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Majesty
thinks
the
report
may
have
been
a
lie
?
It
_
was
_
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
an
immense
effect
;
up
went
appealing
hands
everywhere
,
*NL*
and
the
king
was
assailed
with
a
storm
of
supplications
that
*NL*
I
might
be
bought
off
at
any
price
,
and
the
calamity
stayed
.
*NL*
The
king
was
eager
to
comply
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
any
terms
,
reverend
sir
,
even
to
the
halving
of
my
kingdom
;
*NL*
but
banish
this
calamity
,
spare
the
sun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
fortune
was
made
.
I
would
have
taken
him
up
in
a
minute
,
but
*NL*
I
could
n't
stop
an
eclipse
;
the
thing
was
out
of
the
question
.
So
*NL*
I
asked
time
to
consider
.
The
king
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
--
ah
,
how
long
,
good
sir
?
Be
merciful
;
look
,
it
groweth
*NL*
darker
,
moment
by
moment
.
Prithee
how
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
long
.
Half
an
hour
--
maybe
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
thousand
pathetic
protests
,
but
I
could
n't
shorten
up
*NL*
any
,
for
I
could
n't
remember
how
long
a
total
eclipse
lasts
.
I
was
*NL*
in
a
puzzled
condition
,
anyway
,
and
wanted
to
think
.
Something
*NL*
was
wrong
about
that
eclipse
,
and
the
fact
was
very
unsettling
.
*NL*
If
this
was
n't
the
one
I
was
after
,
how
was
I
to
tell
whether
this
*NL*
was
the
sixth
century
,
or
nothing
but
a
dream
?
Dear
me
,
if
I
could
*NL*
only
prove
it
was
the
latter
!
Here
was
a
glad
new
hope
.
If
the
boy
*NL*
was
right
about
the
date
,
and
this
was
surely
the
20th
,
it
_
was
n't
_
*NL*
the
sixth
century
.
I
reached
for
the
monk
's
sleeve
,
in
considerable
*NL*
excitement
,
and
asked
him
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hang
him
,
he
said
it
was
the
_
twenty-first
_
!
It
made
me
turn
cold
*NL*
to
hear
him
.
I
begged
him
not
to
make
any
mistake
about
it
;
but
*NL*
he
was
sure
;
he
knew
it
was
the
21st
.
So
,
that
feather-headed
*NL*
boy
had
botched
things
again
!
The
time
of
the
day
was
right
*NL*
for
the
eclipse
;
I
had
seen
that
for
myself
,
in
the
beginning
,
*NL*
by
the
dial
that
was
near
by
.
Yes
,
I
was
in
King
Arthur
's
court
,
*NL*
and
I
might
as
well
make
the
most
out
of
it
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
was
steadily
growing
,
the
people
becoming
more
and
*NL*
more
distressed
.
I
now
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
reflected
,
Sir
King
.
For
a
lesson
,
I
will
let
this
darkness
*NL*
proceed
,
and
spread
night
in
the
world
;
but
whether
I
blot
out
*NL*
the
sun
for
good
,
or
restore
it
,
shall
rest
with
you
.
These
are
*NL*
the
terms
,
to
wit
:
You
shall
remain
king
over
all
your
dominions
,
*NL*
and
receive
all
the
glories
and
honors
that
belong
to
the
kingship
;
*NL*
but
you
shall
appoint
me
your
perpetual
minister
and
executive
,
*NL*
and
give
me
for
my
services
one
per
cent
of
such
actual
increase
*NL*
of
revenue
over
and
above
its
present
amount
as
I
may
succeed
*NL*
in
creating
for
the
state
.
If
I
ca
n't
live
on
that
,
I
sha
'n'
t
ask
*NL*
anybody
to
give
me
a
lift
.
Is
it
satisfactory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
prodigious
roar
of
applause
,
and
out
of
the
midst
*NL*
of
it
the
king
's
voice
rose
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
with
his
bonds
,
and
set
him
free
!
and
do
him
homage
,
high
*NL*
and
low
,
rich
and
poor
,
for
he
is
become
the
king
's
right
hand
,
*NL*
is
clothed
with
power
and
authority
,
and
his
seat
is
upon
the
highest
*NL*
step
of
the
throne
!
Now
sweep
away
this
creeping
night
,
and
bring
*NL*
the
light
and
cheer
again
,
that
all
the
world
may
bless
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
a
common
man
should
be
shamed
before
the
world
,
is
nothing
;
*NL*
but
it
were
dishonor
to
the
_
king
_
if
any
that
saw
his
minister
naked
*NL*
should
not
also
see
him
delivered
from
his
shame
.
If
I
might
ask
*NL*
that
my
clothes
be
brought
again
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
meet
,
''
the
king
broke
in
.
``
Fetch
raiment
of
another
*NL*
sort
;
clothe
him
like
a
prince
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
idea
worked
.
I
wanted
to
keep
things
as
they
were
till
the
*NL*
eclipse
was
total
,
otherwise
they
would
be
trying
again
to
get
*NL*
me
to
dismiss
the
darkness
,
and
of
course
I
could
n't
do
it
.
Sending
*NL*
for
the
clothes
gained
some
delay
,
but
not
enough
.
So
I
had
to
make
*NL*
another
excuse
.
I
said
it
would
be
but
natural
if
the
king
should
*NL*
change
his
mind
and
repent
to
some
extent
of
what
he
had
done
*NL*
under
excitement
;
therefore
I
would
let
the
darkness
grow
a
while
,
*NL*
and
if
at
the
end
of
a
reasonable
time
the
king
had
kept
his
mind
*NL*
the
same
,
the
darkness
should
be
dismissed
.
Neither
the
king
nor
*NL*
anybody
else
was
satisfied
with
that
arrangement
,
but
I
had
*NL*
to
stick
to
my
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
darker
and
darker
and
blacker
and
blacker
,
while
I
struggled
*NL*
with
those
awkward
sixth-century
clothes
.
It
got
to
be
pitch
dark
,
*NL*
at
last
,
and
the
multitude
groaned
with
horror
to
feel
the
cold
*NL*
uncanny
night
breezes
fan
through
the
place
and
see
the
stars
*NL*
come
out
and
twinkle
in
the
sky
.
At
last
the
eclipse
was
total
,
*NL*
and
I
was
very
glad
of
it
,
but
everybody
else
was
in
misery
;
which
*NL*
was
quite
natural
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
,
by
his
silence
,
still
stands
to
the
terms
.
''
Then
*NL*
I
lifted
up
my
hands
--
stood
just
so
a
moment
--
then
I
said
,
with
*NL*
the
most
awful
solemnity
:
``
Let
the
enchantment
dissolve
and
*NL*
pass
harmless
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
response
,
for
a
moment
,
in
that
deep
darkness
and
*NL*
that
graveyard
hush
.
But
when
the
silver
rim
of
the
sun
pushed
*NL*
itself
out
,
a
moment
or
two
later
,
the
assemblage
broke
loose
with
*NL*
a
vast
shout
and
came
pouring
down
like
a
deluge
to
smother
me
*NL*
with
blessings
and
gratitude
;
and
Clarence
was
not
the
last
of
*NL*
the
wash
,
to
be
sure
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
MERLIN
'S
TOWER
*NL*
*NL*
Inasmuch
as
I
was
now
the
second
personage
in
the
Kingdom
,
as
far
*NL*
as
political
power
and
authority
were
concerned
,
much
was
made
*NL*
of
me
.
My
raiment
was
of
silks
and
velvets
and
cloth
of
gold
,
*NL*
and
by
consequence
was
very
showy
,
also
uncomfortable
.
But
habit
*NL*
would
soon
reconcile
me
to
my
clothes
;
I
was
aware
of
that
.
I
was
*NL*
given
the
choicest
suite
of
apartments
in
the
castle
,
after
*NL*
the
king
's
.
They
were
aglow
with
loud-colored
silken
hangings
,
*NL*
but
the
stone
floors
had
nothing
but
rushes
on
them
for
a
carpet
,
*NL*
and
they
were
misfit
rushes
at
that
,
being
not
all
of
one
breed
.
*NL*
As
for
conveniences
,
properly
speaking
,
there
were
n't
any
.
I
mean
*NL*
_
little
_
conveniences
;
it
is
the
little
conveniences
that
make
*NL*
the
real
comfort
of
life
.
The
big
oaken
chairs
,
graced
with
rude
*NL*
carvings
,
were
well
enough
,
but
that
was
the
stopping
place
.
*NL*
There
was
no
soap
,
no
matches
,
no
looking-glass
--
except
a
metal
*NL*
one
,
about
as
powerful
as
a
pail
of
water
.
And
not
a
chromo
.
*NL*
I
had
been
used
to
chromos
for
years
,
and
I
saw
now
that
without
*NL*
my
suspecting
it
a
passion
for
art
had
got
worked
into
the
fabric
*NL*
of
my
being
,
and
was
become
a
part
of
me
.
It
made
me
homesick
*NL*
to
look
around
over
this
proud
and
gaudy
but
heartless
barrenness
*NL*
and
remember
that
in
our
house
in
East
Hartford
,
all
unpretending
*NL*
as
it
was
,
you
could
n't
go
into
a
room
but
you
would
find
an
*NL*
insurance-chromo
,
or
at
least
a
three-color
God-Bless-Our-Home
*NL*
over
the
door
;
and
in
the
parlor
we
had
nine
.
But
here
,
even
in
*NL*
my
grand
room
of
state
,
there
was
n't
anything
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
a
picture
except
a
thing
the
size
of
a
bedquilt
,
which
was
either
*NL*
woven
or
knitted
-LRB-
it
had
darned
places
in
it
-RRB-
,
and
nothing
in
it
*NL*
was
the
right
color
or
the
right
shape
;
and
as
for
proportions
,
*NL*
even
Raphael
himself
could
n't
have
botched
them
more
formidably
,
*NL*
after
all
his
practice
on
those
nightmares
they
call
his
``
celebrated
*NL*
Hampton
Court
cartoons
.
''
Raphael
was
a
bird
.
We
had
several
*NL*
of
his
chromos
;
one
was
his
``
Miraculous
Draught
of
Fishes
,
''
where
*NL*
he
puts
in
a
miracle
of
his
own
--
puts
three
men
into
a
canoe
which
*NL*
would
n't
have
held
a
dog
without
upsetting
.
I
always
admired
*NL*
to
study
R.
's
art
,
it
was
so
fresh
and
unconventional
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
n't
even
a
bell
or
a
speaking-tube
in
the
castle
.
I
had
*NL*
a
great
many
servants
,
and
those
that
were
on
duty
lolled
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
;
and
when
I
wanted
one
of
them
I
had
to
go
and
call
for
him
.
*NL*
There
was
no
gas
,
there
were
no
candles
;
a
bronze
dish
half
full
*NL*
of
boarding-house
butter
with
a
blazing
rag
floating
in
it
was
*NL*
the
thing
that
produced
what
was
regarded
as
light
.
A
lot
of
*NL*
these
hung
along
the
walls
and
modified
the
dark
,
just
toned
it
*NL*
down
enough
to
make
it
dismal
.
If
you
went
out
at
night
,
your
*NL*
servants
carried
torches
.
There
were
no
books
,
pens
,
paper
or
*NL*
ink
,
and
no
glass
in
the
openings
they
believed
to
be
windows
.
*NL*
It
is
a
little
thing
--
glass
is
--
until
it
is
absent
,
then
it
becomes
*NL*
a
big
thing
.
But
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
was
,
that
there
was
n't
*NL*
any
sugar
,
coffee
,
tea
,
or
tobacco
.
I
saw
that
I
was
just
another
*NL*
Robinson
Crusoe
cast
away
on
an
uninhabited
island
,
with
no
society
*NL*
but
some
more
or
less
tame
animals
,
and
if
I
wanted
to
make
life
*NL*
bearable
I
must
do
as
he
did
--
invent
,
contrive
,
create
,
reorganize
*NL*
things
;
set
brain
and
hand
to
work
,
and
keep
them
busy
.
Well
,
*NL*
that
was
in
my
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
troubled
me
along
at
first
--
the
immense
interest
which
*NL*
people
took
in
me
.
Apparently
the
whole
nation
wanted
a
look
*NL*
at
me
.
It
soon
transpired
that
the
eclipse
had
scared
the
British
*NL*
world
almost
to
death
;
that
while
it
lasted
the
whole
country
,
*NL*
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
was
in
a
pitiable
state
of
panic
,
and
*NL*
the
churches
,
hermitages
,
and
monkeries
overflowed
with
praying
*NL*
and
weeping
poor
creatures
who
thought
the
end
of
the
world
was
*NL*
come
.
Then
had
followed
the
news
that
the
producer
of
this
awful
*NL*
event
was
a
stranger
,
a
mighty
magician
at
Arthur
's
court
;
that
he
*NL*
could
have
blown
out
the
sun
like
a
candle
,
and
was
just
going
*NL*
to
do
it
when
his
mercy
was
purchased
,
and
he
then
dissolved
*NL*
his
enchantments
,
and
was
now
recognized
and
honored
as
the
man
*NL*
who
had
by
his
unaided
might
saved
the
globe
from
destruction
and
*NL*
its
peoples
from
extinction
.
Now
if
you
consider
that
everybody
*NL*
believed
that
,
and
not
only
believed
it
,
but
never
even
dreamed
*NL*
of
doubting
it
,
you
will
easily
understand
that
there
was
not
*NL*
a
person
in
all
Britain
that
would
not
have
walked
fifty
miles
*NL*
to
get
a
sight
of
me
.
Of
course
I
was
all
the
talk
--
all
other
*NL*
subjects
were
dropped
;
even
the
king
became
suddenly
a
person
of
*NL*
minor
interest
and
notoriety
.
Within
twenty-four
hours
the
*NL*
delegations
began
to
arrive
,
and
from
that
time
onward
for
a
fortnight
*NL*
they
kept
coming
.
The
village
was
crowded
,
and
all
the
countryside
.
*NL*
I
had
to
go
out
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
show
myself
to
these
*NL*
reverent
and
awe-stricken
multitudes
.
It
came
to
be
a
great
burden
,
*NL*
as
to
time
and
trouble
,
but
of
course
it
was
at
the
same
time
*NL*
compensatingly
agreeable
to
be
so
celebrated
and
such
a
center
*NL*
of
homage
.
It
turned
Brer
Merlin
green
with
envy
and
spite
,
which
*NL*
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
.
But
there
was
one
thing
I
could
n't
*NL*
understand
--
nobody
had
asked
for
an
autograph
.
I
spoke
to
Clarence
*NL*
about
it
.
By
George
!
I
had
to
explain
to
him
what
it
was
.
Then
*NL*
he
said
nobody
in
the
country
could
read
or
write
but
a
few
dozen
*NL*
priests
.
Land
!
think
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
thing
that
troubled
me
a
little
.
Those
multitudes
*NL*
presently
began
to
agitate
for
another
miracle
.
That
was
natural
.
*NL*
To
be
able
to
carry
back
to
their
far
homes
the
boast
that
they
*NL*
had
seen
the
man
who
could
command
the
sun
,
riding
in
the
heavens
,
*NL*
and
be
obeyed
,
would
make
them
great
in
the
eyes
of
their
neighbors
,
*NL*
and
envied
by
them
all
;
but
to
be
able
to
also
say
they
had
seen
*NL*
him
work
a
miracle
themselves
--
why
,
people
would
come
a
distance
*NL*
to
see
_
them
_
.
The
pressure
got
to
be
pretty
strong
.
There
was
*NL*
going
to
be
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
,
and
I
knew
the
date
and
hour
,
*NL*
but
it
was
too
far
away
.
Two
years
.
I
would
have
given
a
good
*NL*
deal
for
license
to
hurry
it
up
and
use
it
now
when
there
was
*NL*
a
big
market
for
it
.
It
seemed
a
great
pity
to
have
it
wasted
so
,
*NL*
and
come
lagging
along
at
a
time
when
a
body
would
n't
have
any
*NL*
use
for
it
,
as
like
as
not
.
If
it
had
been
booked
for
only
a
month
*NL*
away
,
I
could
have
sold
it
short
;
but
,
as
matters
stood
,
I
could
n't
*NL*
seem
to
cipher
out
any
way
to
make
it
do
me
any
good
,
so
I
gave
up
*NL*
trying
.
Next
,
Clarence
found
that
old
Merlin
was
making
himself
*NL*
busy
on
the
sly
among
those
people
.
He
was
spreading
a
report
that
*NL*
I
was
a
humbug
,
and
that
the
reason
I
did
n't
accommodate
the
people
*NL*
with
a
miracle
was
because
I
could
n't
.
I
saw
that
I
must
do
*NL*
something
.
I
presently
thought
out
a
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
my
authority
as
executive
I
threw
Merlin
into
prison
--
the
same
*NL*
cell
I
had
occupied
myself
.
Then
I
gave
public
notice
by
herald
*NL*
and
trumpet
that
I
should
be
busy
with
affairs
of
state
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
,
but
about
the
end
of
that
time
I
would
take
a
moment
's
*NL*
leisure
and
blow
up
Merlin
's
stone
tower
by
fires
from
heaven
;
*NL*
in
the
meantime
,
whoso
listened
to
evil
reports
about
me
,
let
him
*NL*
beware
.
Furthermore
,
I
would
perform
but
this
one
miracle
at
*NL*
this
time
,
and
no
more
;
if
it
failed
to
satisfy
and
any
murmured
,
*NL*
I
would
turn
the
murmurers
into
horses
,
and
make
them
useful
.
*NL*
Quiet
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
Clarence
into
my
confidence
,
to
a
certain
degree
,
and
we
*NL*
went
to
work
privately
.
I
told
him
that
this
was
a
sort
of
miracle
*NL*
that
required
a
trifle
of
preparation
,
and
that
it
would
be
sudden
*NL*
death
to
ever
talk
about
these
preparations
to
anybody
.
That
made
*NL*
his
mouth
safe
enough
.
Clandestinely
we
made
a
few
bushels
of
*NL*
first-rate
blasting
powder
,
and
I
superintended
my
armorers
while
*NL*
they
constructed
a
lightning-rod
and
some
wires
.
This
old
stone
*NL*
tower
was
very
massive
--
and
rather
ruinous
,
too
,
for
it
was
Roman
,
*NL*
and
four
hundred
years
old
.
Yes
,
and
handsome
,
after
a
rude
*NL*
fashion
,
and
clothed
with
ivy
from
base
to
summit
,
as
with
a
shirt
*NL*
of
scale
mail
.
It
stood
on
a
lonely
eminence
,
in
good
view
from
*NL*
the
castle
,
and
about
half
a
mile
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Working
by
night
,
we
stowed
the
powder
in
the
tower
--
dug
stones
*NL*
out
,
on
the
inside
,
and
buried
the
powder
in
the
walls
themselves
,
*NL*
which
were
fifteen
feet
thick
at
the
base
.
We
put
in
a
peck
*NL*
at
a
time
,
in
a
dozen
places
.
We
could
have
blown
up
the
Tower
*NL*
of
London
with
these
charges
.
When
the
thirteenth
night
was
come
*NL*
we
put
up
our
lightning-rod
,
bedded
it
in
one
of
the
batches
of
*NL*
powder
,
and
ran
wires
from
it
to
the
other
batches
.
Everybody
*NL*
had
shunned
that
locality
from
the
day
of
my
proclamation
,
but
*NL*
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
I
thought
best
to
warn
the
people
,
*NL*
through
the
heralds
,
to
keep
clear
away
--
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
.
*NL*
Then
added
,
by
command
,
that
at
some
time
during
the
twenty-four
*NL*
hours
I
would
consummate
the
miracle
,
but
would
first
give
a
brief
*NL*
notice
;
by
flags
on
the
castle
towers
if
in
the
daytime
,
by
*NL*
torch-baskets
in
the
same
places
if
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thunder-showers
had
been
tolerably
frequent
of
late
,
and
I
was
*NL*
not
much
afraid
of
a
failure
;
still
,
I
should
n't
have
cared
for
*NL*
a
delay
of
a
day
or
two
;
I
should
have
explained
that
I
was
busy
*NL*
with
affairs
of
state
yet
,
and
the
people
must
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
we
had
a
blazing
sunny
day
--
almost
the
first
one
without
*NL*
a
cloud
for
three
weeks
;
things
always
happen
so
.
I
kept
secluded
,
*NL*
and
watched
the
weather
.
Clarence
dropped
in
from
time
to
time
*NL*
and
said
the
public
excitement
was
growing
and
growing
all
the
*NL*
time
,
and
the
whole
country
filling
up
with
human
masses
as
far
*NL*
as
one
could
see
from
the
battlements
.
At
last
the
wind
sprang
up
*NL*
and
a
cloud
appeared
--
in
the
right
quarter
,
too
,
and
just
at
*NL*
nightfall
.
For
a
little
while
I
watched
that
distant
cloud
spread
*NL*
and
blacken
,
then
I
judged
it
was
time
for
me
to
appear
.
I
ordered
*NL*
the
torch-baskets
to
be
lit
,
and
Merlin
liberated
and
sent
to
me
.
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
ascended
the
parapet
and
there
found
*NL*
the
king
and
the
court
assembled
and
gazing
off
in
the
darkness
*NL*
toward
Merlin
's
Tower
.
Already
the
darkness
was
so
heavy
that
*NL*
one
could
not
see
far
;
these
people
and
the
old
turrets
,
being
*NL*
partly
in
deep
shadow
and
partly
in
the
red
glow
from
the
great
*NL*
torch-baskets
overhead
,
made
a
good
deal
of
a
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Merlin
arrived
in
a
gloomy
mood
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wanted
to
burn
me
alive
when
I
had
not
done
you
any
harm
,
*NL*
and
latterly
you
have
been
trying
to
injure
my
professional
*NL*
reputation
.
Therefore
I
am
going
to
call
down
fire
and
blow
up
*NL*
your
tower
,
but
it
is
only
fair
to
give
you
a
chance
;
now
if
you
*NL*
think
you
can
break
my
enchantments
and
ward
off
the
fires
,
step
*NL*
to
the
bat
,
it
's
your
innings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
,
fair
sir
,
and
I
will
.
Doubt
it
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
an
imaginary
circle
on
the
stones
of
the
roof
,
and
burnt
*NL*
a
pinch
of
powder
in
it
,
which
sent
up
a
small
cloud
of
aromatic
*NL*
smoke
,
whereat
everybody
fell
back
and
began
to
cross
themselves
*NL*
and
get
uncomfortable
.
Then
he
began
to
mutter
and
make
passes
*NL*
in
the
air
with
his
hands
.
He
worked
himself
up
slowly
and
*NL*
gradually
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
,
and
got
to
thrashing
around
with
*NL*
his
arms
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
.
By
this
time
the
storm
had
*NL*
about
reached
us
;
the
gusts
of
wind
were
flaring
the
torches
and
*NL*
making
the
shadows
swash
about
,
the
first
heavy
drops
of
rain
*NL*
were
falling
,
the
world
abroad
was
black
as
pitch
,
the
lightning
*NL*
began
to
wink
fitfully
.
Of
course
,
my
rod
would
be
loading
itself
*NL*
now
.
In
fact
,
things
were
imminent
.
So
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
time
enough
.
I
have
given
you
every
advantage
,
*NL*
and
not
interfered
.
It
is
plain
your
magic
is
weak
.
It
is
only
*NL*
fair
that
I
begin
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
about
three
passes
in
the
air
,
and
then
there
was
an
awful
*NL*
crash
and
that
old
tower
leaped
into
the
sky
in
chunks
,
along
*NL*
with
a
vast
volcanic
fountain
of
fire
that
turned
night
to
noonday
,
*NL*
and
showed
a
thousand
acres
of
human
beings
groveling
on
the
ground
*NL*
in
a
general
collapse
of
consternation
.
Well
,
it
rained
mortar
and
*NL*
masonry
the
rest
of
the
week
.
This
was
the
report
;
but
probably
*NL*
the
facts
would
have
modified
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
effective
miracle
.
The
great
bothersome
temporary
*NL*
population
vanished
.
There
were
a
good
many
thousand
tracks
*NL*
in
the
mud
the
next
morning
,
but
they
were
all
outward
bound
.
*NL*
If
I
had
advertised
another
miracle
I
could
n't
have
raised
an
*NL*
audience
with
a
sheriff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Merlin
's
stock
was
flat
.
The
king
wanted
to
stop
his
wages
;
he
*NL*
even
wanted
to
banish
him
,
but
I
interfered
.
I
said
he
would
be
*NL*
useful
to
work
the
weather
,
and
attend
to
small
matters
like
that
,
*NL*
and
I
would
give
him
a
lift
now
and
then
when
his
poor
little
*NL*
parlor-magic
soured
on
him
.
There
was
n't
a
rag
of
his
tower
left
,
*NL*
but
I
had
the
government
rebuild
it
for
him
,
and
advised
him
*NL*
to
take
boarders
;
but
he
was
too
high-toned
for
that
.
And
as
for
*NL*
being
grateful
,
he
never
even
said
thank
you
.
He
was
a
rather
*NL*
hard
lot
,
take
him
how
you
might
;
but
then
you
could
n't
fairly
*NL*
expect
a
man
to
be
sweet
that
had
been
set
back
so
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BOSS
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
vested
with
enormous
authority
is
a
fine
thing
;
but
to
have
*NL*
the
on-looking
world
consent
to
it
is
a
finer
.
The
tower
episode
*NL*
solidified
my
power
,
and
made
it
impregnable
.
If
any
were
perchance
*NL*
disposed
to
be
jealous
and
critical
before
that
,
they
experienced
*NL*
a
change
of
heart
,
now
.
There
was
not
any
one
in
the
kingdom
*NL*
who
would
have
considered
it
good
judgment
to
meddle
with
my
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
fast
getting
adjusted
to
my
situation
and
circumstances
.
*NL*
For
a
time
,
I
used
to
wake
up
,
mornings
,
and
smile
at
my
``
dream
,
''
*NL*
and
listen
for
the
Colt
's
factory
whistle
;
but
that
sort
of
thing
*NL*
played
itself
out
,
gradually
,
and
at
last
I
was
fully
able
to
realize
*NL*
that
I
was
actually
living
in
the
sixth
century
,
and
in
Arthur
's
*NL*
court
,
not
a
lunatic
asylum
.
After
that
,
I
was
just
as
much
*NL*
at
home
in
that
century
as
I
could
have
been
in
any
other
;
and
*NL*
as
for
preference
,
I
would
n't
have
traded
it
for
the
twentieth
.
*NL*
Look
at
the
opportunities
here
for
a
man
of
knowledge
,
brains
,
*NL*
pluck
,
and
enterprise
to
sail
in
and
grow
up
with
the
country
.
*NL*
The
grandest
field
that
ever
was
;
and
all
my
own
;
not
a
competitor
;
*NL*
not
a
man
who
was
n't
a
baby
to
me
in
acquirements
and
capacities
;
*NL*
whereas
,
what
would
I
amount
to
in
the
twentieth
century
?
I
should
*NL*
be
foreman
of
a
factory
,
that
is
about
all
;
and
could
drag
a
seine
*NL*
down
street
any
day
and
catch
a
hundred
better
men
than
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
jump
I
had
made
!
I
could
n't
keep
from
thinking
about
it
,
*NL*
and
contemplating
it
,
just
as
one
does
who
has
struck
oil
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
back
of
me
that
could
approach
it
,
unless
it
might
be
*NL*
Joseph
's
case
;
and
Joseph
's
only
approached
it
,
it
did
n't
equal
*NL*
it
,
quite
.
For
it
stands
to
reason
that
as
Joseph
's
splendid
*NL*
financial
ingenuities
advantaged
nobody
but
the
king
,
the
general
*NL*
public
must
have
regarded
him
with
a
good
deal
of
disfavor
,
whereas
*NL*
I
had
done
my
entire
public
a
kindness
in
sparing
the
sun
,
and
was
*NL*
popular
by
reason
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
shadow
of
a
king
;
I
was
the
substance
;
the
king
himself
*NL*
was
the
shadow
.
My
power
was
colossal
;
and
it
was
not
a
mere
*NL*
name
,
as
such
things
have
generally
been
,
it
was
the
genuine
*NL*
article
.
I
stood
here
,
at
the
very
spring
and
source
of
the
second
*NL*
great
period
of
the
world
's
history
;
and
could
see
the
trickling
*NL*
stream
of
that
history
gather
and
deepen
and
broaden
,
and
roll
*NL*
its
mighty
tides
down
the
far
centuries
;
and
I
could
note
the
*NL*
upspringing
of
adventurers
like
myself
in
the
shelter
of
its
long
*NL*
array
of
thrones
:
De
Montforts
,
Gavestons
,
Mortimers
,
Villierses
;
*NL*
the
war-making
,
campaign-directing
wantons
of
France
,
and
Charles
*NL*
the
Second
's
scepter-wielding
drabs
;
but
nowhere
in
the
procession
*NL*
was
my
full-sized
fellow
visible
.
I
was
a
Unique
;
and
glad
to
know
*NL*
that
that
fact
could
not
be
dislodged
or
challenged
for
thirteen
*NL*
centuries
and
a
half
,
for
sure
.
Yes
,
in
power
I
was
equal
to
*NL*
the
king
.
At
the
same
time
there
was
another
power
that
was
*NL*
a
trifle
stronger
than
both
of
us
put
together
.
That
was
the
Church
.
*NL*
I
do
not
wish
to
disguise
that
fact
.
I
could
n't
,
if
I
wanted
to
.
*NL*
But
never
mind
about
that
,
now
;
it
will
show
up
,
in
its
proper
*NL*
place
,
later
on
.
It
did
n't
cause
me
any
trouble
in
the
beginning
*NL*
--
at
least
any
of
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
a
curious
country
,
and
full
of
interest
.
And
the
*NL*
people
!
They
were
the
quaintest
and
simplest
and
trustingest
race
;
*NL*
why
,
they
were
nothing
but
rabbits
.
It
was
pitiful
for
a
person
*NL*
born
in
a
wholesome
free
atmosphere
to
listen
to
their
humble
*NL*
and
hearty
outpourings
of
loyalty
toward
their
king
and
Church
*NL*
and
nobility
;
as
if
they
had
any
more
occasion
to
love
and
honor
*NL*
king
and
Church
and
noble
than
a
slave
has
to
love
and
honor
*NL*
the
lash
,
or
a
dog
has
to
love
and
honor
the
stranger
that
kicks
him
!
*NL*
Why
,
dear
me
,
_
any
_
kind
of
royalty
,
howsoever
modified
,
_
any
_
kind
*NL*
of
aristocracy
,
howsoever
pruned
,
is
rightly
an
insult
;
but
if
you
*NL*
are
born
and
brought
up
under
that
sort
of
arrangement
you
probably
*NL*
never
find
it
out
for
yourself
,
and
do
n't
believe
it
when
somebody
*NL*
else
tells
you
.
It
is
enough
to
make
a
body
ashamed
of
his
race
*NL*
to
think
of
the
sort
of
froth
that
has
always
occupied
its
thrones
*NL*
without
shadow
of
right
or
reason
,
and
the
seventh-rate
people
*NL*
that
have
always
figured
as
its
aristocracies
--
a
company
of
monarchs
*NL*
and
nobles
who
,
as
a
rule
,
would
have
achieved
only
poverty
and
*NL*
obscurity
if
left
,
like
their
betters
,
to
their
own
exertions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
of
King
Arthur
's
British
nation
were
slaves
,
pure
and
*NL*
simple
,
and
bore
that
name
,
and
wore
the
iron
collar
on
their
*NL*
necks
;
and
the
rest
were
slaves
in
fact
,
but
without
the
name
;
*NL*
they
imagined
themselves
men
and
freemen
,
and
called
themselves
*NL*
so
.
The
truth
was
,
the
nation
as
a
body
was
in
the
world
for
one
*NL*
object
,
and
one
only
:
to
grovel
before
king
and
Church
and
noble
;
*NL*
to
slave
for
them
,
sweat
blood
for
them
,
starve
that
they
might
*NL*
be
fed
,
work
that
they
might
play
,
drink
misery
to
the
dregs
that
*NL*
they
might
be
happy
,
go
naked
that
they
might
wear
silks
and
*NL*
jewels
,
pay
taxes
that
they
might
be
spared
from
paying
them
,
*NL*
be
familiar
all
their
lives
with
the
degrading
language
and
postures
*NL*
of
adulation
that
they
might
walk
in
pride
and
think
themselves
*NL*
the
gods
of
this
world
.
And
for
all
this
,
the
thanks
they
got
were
*NL*
cuffs
and
contempt
;
and
so
poor-spirited
were
they
that
they
took
*NL*
even
this
sort
of
attention
as
an
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inherited
ideas
are
a
curious
thing
,
and
interesting
to
observe
*NL*
and
examine
.
I
had
mine
,
the
king
and
his
people
had
theirs
.
*NL*
In
both
cases
they
flowed
in
ruts
worn
deep
by
time
and
habit
,
*NL*
and
the
man
who
should
have
proposed
to
divert
them
by
reason
*NL*
and
argument
would
have
had
a
long
contract
on
his
hands
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
those
people
had
inherited
the
idea
that
all
men
without
*NL*
title
and
a
long
pedigree
,
whether
they
had
great
natural
gifts
*NL*
and
acquirements
or
had
n't
,
were
creatures
of
no
more
consideration
*NL*
than
so
many
animals
,
bugs
,
insects
;
whereas
I
had
inherited
the
idea
*NL*
that
human
daws
who
can
consent
to
masquerade
in
the
peacock-shams
*NL*
of
inherited
dignities
and
unearned
titles
,
are
of
no
good
but
*NL*
to
be
laughed
at
.
The
way
I
was
looked
upon
was
odd
,
but
it
was
*NL*
natural
.
You
know
how
the
keeper
and
the
public
regard
the
elephant
*NL*
in
the
menagerie
:
well
,
that
is
the
idea
.
They
are
full
of
*NL*
admiration
of
his
vast
bulk
and
his
prodigious
strength
;
they
*NL*
speak
with
pride
of
the
fact
that
he
can
do
a
hundred
marvels
*NL*
which
are
far
and
away
beyond
their
own
powers
;
and
they
speak
*NL*
with
the
same
pride
of
the
fact
that
in
his
wrath
he
is
able
*NL*
to
drive
a
thousand
men
before
him
.
But
does
that
make
him
one
*NL*
of
_
them
_
?
No
;
the
raggedest
tramp
in
the
pit
would
smile
at
*NL*
the
idea
.
He
could
n't
comprehend
it
;
could
n't
take
it
in
;
could
n't
*NL*
in
any
remote
way
conceive
of
it
.
Well
,
to
the
king
,
the
nobles
,
*NL*
and
all
the
nation
,
down
to
the
very
slaves
and
tramps
,
I
was
*NL*
just
that
kind
of
an
elephant
,
and
nothing
more
.
I
was
admired
,
*NL*
also
feared
;
but
it
was
as
an
animal
is
admired
and
feared
.
*NL*
The
animal
is
not
reverenced
,
neither
was
I
;
I
was
not
even
*NL*
respected
.
I
had
no
pedigree
,
no
inherited
title
;
so
in
the
king
's
*NL*
and
nobles
'
eyes
I
was
mere
dirt
;
the
people
regarded
me
with
*NL*
wonder
and
awe
,
but
there
was
no
reverence
mixed
with
it
;
through
*NL*
the
force
of
inherited
ideas
they
were
not
able
to
conceive
of
*NL*
anything
being
entitled
to
that
except
pedigree
and
lordship
.
*NL*
There
you
see
the
hand
of
that
awful
power
,
the
Roman
Catholic
*NL*
Church
.
In
two
or
three
little
centuries
it
had
converted
a
nation
*NL*
of
men
to
a
nation
of
worms
.
Before
the
day
of
the
Church
's
*NL*
supremacy
in
the
world
,
men
were
men
,
and
held
their
heads
up
,
*NL*
and
had
a
man
's
pride
and
spirit
and
independence
;
and
what
*NL*
of
greatness
and
position
a
person
got
,
he
got
mainly
by
achievement
,
*NL*
not
by
birth
.
But
then
the
Church
came
to
the
front
,
with
an
axe
*NL*
to
grind
;
and
she
was
wise
,
subtle
,
and
knew
more
than
one
way
*NL*
to
skin
a
cat
--
or
a
nation
;
she
invented
``
divine
right
of
kings
,
''
*NL*
and
propped
it
all
around
,
brick
by
brick
,
with
the
Beatitudes
*NL*
--
wrenching
them
from
their
good
purpose
to
make
them
fortify
*NL*
an
evil
one
;
she
preached
-LRB-
to
the
commoner
-RRB-
humility
,
obedience
*NL*
to
superiors
,
the
beauty
of
self-sacrifice
;
she
preached
-LRB-
to
the
*NL*
commoner
-RRB-
meekness
under
insult
;
preached
-LRB-
still
to
the
commoner
,
*NL*
always
to
the
commoner
-RRB-
patience
,
meanness
of
spirit
,
non-resistance
*NL*
under
oppression
;
and
she
introduced
heritable
ranks
and
*NL*
aristocracies
,
and
taught
all
the
Christian
populations
of
the
earth
*NL*
to
bow
down
to
them
and
worship
them
.
Even
down
to
my
birth-century
*NL*
that
poison
was
still
in
the
blood
of
Christendom
,
and
the
best
*NL*
of
English
commoners
was
still
content
to
see
his
inferiors
*NL*
impudently
continuing
to
hold
a
number
of
positions
,
such
as
*NL*
lordships
and
the
throne
,
to
which
the
grotesque
laws
of
his
country
*NL*
did
not
allow
him
to
aspire
;
in
fact
,
he
was
not
merely
contented
*NL*
with
this
strange
condition
of
things
,
he
was
even
able
to
persuade
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
proud
of
it
.
It
seems
to
show
that
there
is
n't
*NL*
anything
you
ca
n't
stand
,
if
you
are
only
born
and
bred
to
it
.
*NL*
Of
course
that
taint
,
that
reverence
for
rank
and
title
,
had
been
*NL*
in
our
American
blood
,
too
--
I
know
that
;
but
when
I
left
America
*NL*
it
had
disappeared
--
at
least
to
all
intents
and
purposes
.
The
*NL*
remnant
of
it
was
restricted
to
the
dudes
and
dudesses
.
When
*NL*
a
disease
has
worked
its
way
down
to
that
level
,
it
may
fairly
*NL*
be
said
to
be
out
of
the
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
my
anomalous
position
in
King
Arthur
's
kingdom
.
*NL*
Here
I
was
,
a
giant
among
pigmies
,
a
man
among
children
,
a
master
*NL*
intelligence
among
intellectual
moles
:
by
all
rational
measurement
*NL*
the
one
and
only
actually
great
man
in
that
whole
British
world
;
*NL*
and
yet
there
and
then
,
just
as
in
the
remote
England
of
my
*NL*
birth-time
,
the
sheep-witted
earl
who
could
claim
long
descent
*NL*
from
a
king
's
leman
,
acquired
at
second-hand
from
the
slums
of
*NL*
London
,
was
a
better
man
than
I
was
.
Such
a
personage
was
fawned
*NL*
upon
in
Arthur
's
realm
and
reverently
looked
up
to
by
everybody
,
*NL*
even
though
his
dispositions
were
as
mean
as
his
intelligence
,
*NL*
and
his
morals
as
base
as
his
lineage
.
There
were
times
when
*NL*
_
he
_
could
sit
down
in
the
king
's
presence
,
but
I
could
n't
.
I
could
*NL*
have
got
a
title
easily
enough
,
and
that
would
have
raised
me
*NL*
a
large
step
in
everybody
's
eyes
;
even
in
the
king
's
,
the
giver
*NL*
of
it
.
But
I
did
n't
ask
for
it
;
and
I
declined
it
when
it
was
*NL*
offered
.
I
could
n't
have
enjoyed
such
a
thing
with
my
notions
;
*NL*
and
it
would
n't
have
been
fair
,
anyway
,
because
as
far
back
as
*NL*
I
could
go
,
our
tribe
had
always
been
short
of
the
bar
sinister
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
have
felt
really
and
satisfactorily
fine
and
proud
*NL*
and
set-up
over
any
title
except
one
that
should
come
from
the
nation
*NL*
itself
,
the
only
legitimate
source
;
and
such
an
one
I
hoped
to
win
;
*NL*
and
in
the
course
of
years
of
honest
and
honorable
endeavor
,
I
did
*NL*
win
it
and
did
wear
it
with
a
high
and
clean
pride
.
This
title
*NL*
fell
casually
from
the
lips
of
a
blacksmith
,
one
day
,
in
a
village
,
*NL*
was
caught
up
as
a
happy
thought
and
tossed
from
mouth
to
mouth
*NL*
with
a
laugh
and
an
affirmative
vote
;
in
ten
days
it
had
swept
*NL*
the
kingdom
,
and
was
become
as
familiar
as
the
king
's
name
.
I
was
*NL*
never
known
by
any
other
designation
afterward
,
whether
in
the
*NL*
nation
's
talk
or
in
grave
debate
upon
matters
of
state
at
the
*NL*
council-board
of
the
sovereign
.
This
title
,
translated
into
modern
*NL*
speech
,
would
be
THE
BOSS
.
Elected
by
the
nation
.
That
suited
me
.
*NL*
And
it
was
a
pretty
high
title
.
There
were
very
few
THE
'S
,
and
*NL*
I
was
one
of
them
.
If
you
spoke
of
the
duke
,
or
the
earl
,
or
*NL*
the
bishop
,
how
could
anybody
tell
which
one
you
meant
?
But
if
*NL*
you
spoke
of
The
King
or
The
Queen
or
The
Boss
,
it
was
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
liked
the
king
,
and
as
king
I
respected
him
--
respected
*NL*
the
office
;
at
least
respected
it
as
much
as
I
was
capable
of
*NL*
respecting
any
unearned
supremacy
;
but
as
MEN
I
looked
down
upon
*NL*
him
and
his
nobles
--
privately
.
And
he
and
they
liked
me
,
and
*NL*
respected
my
office
;
but
as
an
animal
,
without
birth
or
sham
title
,
*NL*
they
looked
down
upon
me
--
and
were
not
particularly
private
about
it
,
*NL*
either
.
I
did
n't
charge
for
my
opinion
about
them
,
and
they
did
n't
*NL*
charge
for
their
opinion
about
me
:
the
account
was
square
,
the
*NL*
books
balanced
,
everybody
was
satisfied
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
TOURNAMENT
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
always
having
grand
tournaments
there
at
Camelot
;
and
*NL*
very
stirring
and
picturesque
and
ridiculous
human
bull-fights
*NL*
they
were
,
too
,
but
just
a
little
wearisome
to
the
practical
mind
.
*NL*
However
,
I
was
generally
on
hand
--
for
two
reasons
:
a
man
must
*NL*
not
hold
himself
aloof
from
the
things
which
his
friends
and
his
*NL*
community
have
at
heart
if
he
would
be
liked
--
especially
as
*NL*
a
statesman
;
and
both
as
business
man
and
statesman
I
wanted
*NL*
to
study
the
tournament
and
see
if
I
could
n't
invent
an
improvement
*NL*
on
it
.
That
reminds
me
to
remark
,
in
passing
,
that
the
very
first
*NL*
official
thing
I
did
,
in
my
administration
--
and
it
was
on
the
very
*NL*
first
day
of
it
,
too
--
was
to
start
a
patent
office
;
for
I
knew
*NL*
that
a
country
without
a
patent
office
and
good
patent
laws
was
*NL*
just
a
crab
,
and
could
n't
travel
any
way
but
sideways
or
backways
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
ran
along
,
a
tournament
nearly
every
week
;
and
now
and
then
*NL*
the
boys
used
to
want
me
to
take
a
hand
--
I
mean
Sir
Launcelot
and
*NL*
the
rest
--
but
I
said
I
would
by
and
by
;
no
hurry
yet
,
and
too
much
*NL*
government
machinery
to
oil
up
and
set
to
rights
and
start
a-going
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
one
tournament
which
was
continued
from
day
to
day
during
*NL*
more
than
a
week
,
and
as
many
as
five
hundred
knights
took
part
*NL*
in
it
,
from
first
to
last
.
They
were
weeks
gathering
.
They
came
*NL*
on
horseback
from
everywhere
;
from
the
very
ends
of
the
country
,
*NL*
and
even
from
beyond
the
sea
;
and
many
brought
ladies
,
and
all
*NL*
brought
squires
and
troops
of
servants
.
It
was
a
most
gaudy
and
*NL*
gorgeous
crowd
,
as
to
costumery
,
and
very
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
country
and
the
time
,
in
the
way
of
high
animal
spirits
,
innocent
*NL*
indecencies
of
language
,
and
happy-hearted
indifference
to
morals
.
*NL*
It
was
fight
or
look
on
,
all
day
and
every
day
;
and
sing
,
gamble
,
*NL*
dance
,
carouse
half
the
night
every
night
.
They
had
a
most
noble
*NL*
good
time
.
You
never
saw
such
people
.
Those
banks
of
beautiful
*NL*
ladies
,
shining
in
their
barbaric
splendors
,
would
see
a
knight
*NL*
sprawl
from
his
horse
in
the
lists
with
a
lanceshaft
the
thickness
*NL*
of
your
ankle
clean
through
him
and
the
blood
spouting
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
fainting
they
would
clap
their
hands
and
crowd
each
other
for
a
*NL*
better
view
;
only
sometimes
one
would
dive
into
her
handkerchief
,
*NL*
and
look
ostentatiously
broken-hearted
,
and
then
you
could
lay
*NL*
two
to
one
that
there
was
a
scandal
there
somewhere
and
she
was
*NL*
afraid
the
public
had
n't
found
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
at
night
would
have
been
annoying
to
me
ordinarily
,
but
*NL*
I
did
n't
mind
it
in
the
present
circumstances
,
because
it
kept
me
*NL*
from
hearing
the
quacks
detaching
legs
and
arms
from
the
day
's
*NL*
cripples
.
They
ruined
an
uncommon
good
old
cross-cut
saw
for
me
,
*NL*
and
broke
the
saw-buck
,
too
,
but
I
let
it
pass
.
And
as
for
my
*NL*
axe
--
well
,
I
made
up
my
mind
that
the
next
time
I
lent
an
axe
*NL*
to
a
surgeon
I
would
pick
my
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
not
only
watched
this
tournament
from
day
to
day
,
but
detailed
*NL*
an
intelligent
priest
from
my
Department
of
Public
Morals
and
*NL*
Agriculture
,
and
ordered
him
to
report
it
;
for
it
was
my
purpose
*NL*
by
and
by
,
when
I
should
have
gotten
the
people
along
far
enough
,
*NL*
to
start
a
newspaper
.
The
first
thing
you
want
in
a
new
country
,
*NL*
is
a
patent
office
;
then
work
up
your
school
system
;
and
after
that
,
*NL*
out
with
your
paper
.
A
newspaper
has
its
faults
,
and
plenty
of
them
,
*NL*
but
no
matter
,
it
's
hark
from
the
tomb
for
a
dead
nation
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
you
forget
it
.
You
ca
n't
resurrect
a
dead
nation
without
it
;
there
*NL*
is
n't
any
way
.
So
I
wanted
to
sample
things
,
and
be
finding
out
*NL*
what
sort
of
reporter-material
I
might
be
able
to
rake
together
out
*NL*
of
the
sixth
century
when
I
should
come
to
need
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
priest
did
very
well
,
considering
.
He
got
in
all
*NL*
the
details
,
and
that
is
a
good
thing
in
a
local
item
:
you
see
,
*NL*
he
had
kept
books
for
the
undertaker-department
of
his
church
*NL*
when
he
was
younger
,
and
there
,
you
know
,
the
money
's
in
the
details
;
*NL*
the
more
details
,
the
more
swag
:
bearers
,
mutes
,
candles
,
prayers
*NL*
--
everything
counts
;
and
if
the
bereaved
do
n't
buy
prayers
enough
*NL*
you
mark
up
your
candles
with
a
forked
pencil
,
and
your
bill
*NL*
shows
up
all
right
.
And
he
had
a
good
knack
at
getting
in
the
*NL*
complimentary
thing
here
and
there
about
a
knight
that
was
likely
*NL*
to
advertise
--
no
,
I
mean
a
knight
that
had
influence
;
and
he
also
*NL*
had
a
neat
gift
of
exaggeration
,
for
in
his
time
he
had
kept
door
*NL*
for
a
pious
hermit
who
lived
in
a
sty
and
worked
miracles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
this
novice
's
report
lacked
whoop
and
crash
and
lurid
*NL*
description
,
and
therefore
wanted
the
true
ring
;
but
its
antique
*NL*
wording
was
quaint
and
sweet
and
simple
,
and
full
of
the
fragrances
*NL*
and
flavors
of
the
time
,
and
these
little
merits
made
up
in
a
measure
*NL*
for
its
more
important
lacks
.
Here
is
an
extract
from
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Sir
Brian
de
les
Isles
and
Grummore
Grummorsum
,
*NL*
knights
of
the
castle
,
encountered
with
Sir
Aglovale
and
*NL*
Sir
Tor
,
and
Sir
Tor
smote
down
Sir
Grummore
Grummorsum
*NL*
to
the
earth
.
Then
came
Sir
Carados
of
the
dolorous
*NL*
tower
,
and
Sir
Turquine
,
knights
of
the
castle
,
and
*NL*
there
encountered
with
them
Sir
Percivale
de
Galis
*NL*
and
Sir
Lamorak
de
Galis
,
that
were
two
brethren
,
and
*NL*
there
encountered
Sir
Percivale
with
Sir
Carados
,
and
*NL*
either
brake
their
spears
unto
their
hands
,
and
then
*NL*
Sir
Turquine
with
Sir
Lamorak
,
and
either
of
them
smote
*NL*
down
other
,
horse
and
all
,
to
the
earth
,
and
either
*NL*
parties
rescued
other
and
horsed
them
again
.
And
Sir
*NL*
Arnold
,
and
Sir
Gauter
,
knights
of
the
castle
,
*NL*
encountered
with
Sir
Brandiles
and
Sir
Kay
,
and
these
*NL*
four
knights
encountered
mightily
,
and
brake
their
*NL*
spears
to
their
hands
.
Then
came
Sir
Pertolope
from
*NL*
the
castle
,
and
there
encountered
with
him
Sir
Lionel
,
*NL*
and
there
Sir
Pertolope
the
green
knight
smote
down
Sir
*NL*
Lionel
,
brother
to
Sir
Launcelot
.
All
this
was
marked
*NL*
by
noble
heralds
,
who
bare
him
best
,
and
their
names
.
*NL*
Then
Sir
Bleobaris
brake
his
spear
upon
Sir
Gareth
,
*NL*
but
of
that
stroke
Sir
Bleobaris
fell
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
When
Sir
Galihodin
saw
that
,
he
bad
Sir
Gareth
keep
him
,
*NL*
and
Sir
Gareth
smote
him
to
the
earth
.
Then
Sir
Galihud
*NL*
gat
a
spear
to
avenge
his
brother
,
and
in
the
same
wise
*NL*
Sir
Gareth
served
him
,
and
Sir
Dinadan
and
his
brother
*NL*
La
Cote
Male
Taile
,
and
Sir
Sagramore
le
Disirous
,
and
*NL*
Sir
Dodinas
le
Savage
;
all
these
he
bare
down
with
one
*NL*
spear
.
When
King
Aswisance
of
Ireland
saw
Sir
Gareth
*NL*
fare
so
he
marvelled
what
he
might
be
,
that
one
time
*NL*
seemed
green
,
and
another
time
,
at
his
again
coming
,
*NL*
he
seemed
blue
.
And
thus
at
every
course
that
he
rode
*NL*
to
and
fro
he
changed
his
color
,
so
that
there
might
*NL*
neither
king
nor
knight
have
ready
cognizance
of
him
.
*NL*
Then
Sir
Agwisance
the
King
of
Ireland
encountered
*NL*
with
Sir
Gareth
,
and
there
Sir
Gareth
smote
him
from
*NL*
his
horse
,
saddle
and
all
.
And
then
came
King
Carados
*NL*
of
Scotland
,
and
Sir
Gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
*NL*
man
.
And
in
the
same
wise
he
served
King
Uriens
of
the
*NL*
land
of
Gore
.
And
then
there
came
in
Sir
Bagdemagus
,
*NL*
and
Sir
Gareth
smote
him
down
horse
and
man
to
the
*NL*
earth
.
And
Bagdemagus
's
son
Meliganus
brake
a
spear
*NL*
upon
Sir
Gareth
mightily
and
knightly
.
And
then
Sir
*NL*
Galahault
the
noble
prince
cried
on
high
,
Knight
with
*NL*
the
many
colors
,
well
hast
thou
justed
;
now
make
thee
*NL*
ready
that
I
may
just
with
thee
.
Sir
Gareth
heard
him
,
*NL*
and
he
gat
a
great
spear
,
and
so
they
encountered
*NL*
together
,
and
there
the
prince
brake
his
spear
;
but
Sir
*NL*
Gareth
smote
him
upon
the
left
side
of
the
helm
,
that
*NL*
he
reeled
here
and
there
,
and
he
had
fallen
down
had
not
*NL*
his
men
recovered
him
.
Truly
,
said
King
Arthur
,
that
*NL*
knight
with
the
many
colors
is
a
good
knight
.
Wherefore
*NL*
the
king
called
unto
him
Sir
Launcelot
,
and
prayed
him
*NL*
to
encounter
with
that
knight
.
Sir
,
said
Launcelot
,
I
*NL*
may
as
well
find
in
my
heart
for
to
forbear
him
at
*NL*
this
time
,
for
he
hath
had
travail
enough
this
day
,
and
*NL*
when
a
good
knight
doth
so
well
upon
some
day
,
it
is
*NL*
no
good
knight
's
part
to
let
him
of
his
worship
,
and
,
*NL*
namely
,
when
he
seeth
a
knight
hath
done
so
great
*NL*
labour
;
for
peradventure
,
said
Sir
Launcelot
,
his
*NL*
quarrel
is
here
this
day
,
and
peradventure
he
is
best
*NL*
beloved
with
this
lady
of
all
that
be
here
,
for
I
see
*NL*
well
he
paineth
himself
and
enforceth
him
to
do
great
*NL*
deeds
,
and
therefore
,
said
Sir
Launcelot
,
as
for
me
,
*NL*
this
day
he
shall
have
the
honour
;
though
it
lay
in
my
*NL*
power
to
put
him
from
it
,
I
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
unpleasant
little
episode
that
day
,
which
for
reasons
*NL*
of
state
I
struck
out
of
my
priest
's
report
.
You
will
have
noticed
*NL*
that
Garry
was
doing
some
great
fighting
in
the
engagement
.
When
*NL*
I
say
Garry
I
mean
Sir
Gareth
.
Garry
was
my
private
pet
name
*NL*
for
him
;
it
suggests
that
I
had
a
deep
affection
for
him
,
and
that
*NL*
was
the
case
.
But
it
was
a
private
pet
name
only
,
and
never
spoken
*NL*
aloud
to
any
one
,
much
less
to
him
;
being
a
noble
,
he
would
not
*NL*
have
endured
a
familiarity
like
that
from
me
.
Well
,
to
proceed
:
*NL*
I
sat
in
the
private
box
set
apart
for
me
as
the
king
's
minister
.
*NL*
While
Sir
Dinadan
was
waiting
for
his
turn
to
enter
the
lists
,
*NL*
he
came
in
there
and
sat
down
and
began
to
talk
;
for
he
was
always
*NL*
making
up
to
me
,
because
I
was
a
stranger
and
he
liked
to
have
*NL*
a
fresh
market
for
his
jokes
,
the
most
of
them
having
reached
that
*NL*
stage
of
wear
where
the
teller
has
to
do
the
laughing
himself
while
*NL*
the
other
person
looks
sick
.
I
had
always
responded
to
his
efforts
*NL*
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
felt
a
very
deep
and
real
kindness
for
him
,
*NL*
too
,
for
the
reason
that
if
by
malice
of
fate
he
knew
the
one
*NL*
particular
anecdote
which
I
had
heard
oftenest
and
had
most
hated
*NL*
and
most
loathed
all
my
life
,
he
had
at
least
spared
it
me
.
It
was
*NL*
one
which
I
had
heard
attributed
to
every
humorous
person
who
*NL*
had
ever
stood
on
American
soil
,
from
Columbus
down
to
Artemus
Ward
.
*NL*
It
was
about
a
humorous
lecturer
who
flooded
an
ignorant
audience
*NL*
with
the
killingest
jokes
for
an
hour
and
never
got
a
laugh
;
and
*NL*
then
when
he
was
leaving
,
some
gray
simpletons
wrung
him
gratefully
*NL*
by
the
hand
and
said
it
had
been
the
funniest
thing
they
had
ever
*NL*
heard
,
and
``
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
keep
from
laughin
'
right
*NL*
out
in
meetin
'
.
''
That
anecdote
never
saw
the
day
that
it
was
*NL*
worth
the
telling
;
and
yet
I
had
sat
under
the
telling
of
it
*NL*
hundreds
and
thousands
and
millions
and
billions
of
times
,
and
*NL*
cried
and
cursed
all
the
way
through
.
Then
who
can
hope
to
know
*NL*
what
my
feelings
were
,
to
hear
this
armor-plated
ass
start
in
on
*NL*
it
again
,
in
the
murky
twilight
of
tradition
,
before
the
dawn
of
*NL*
history
,
while
even
Lactantius
might
be
referred
to
as
``
the
late
*NL*
Lactantius
,
''
and
the
Crusades
would
n't
be
born
for
five
hundred
*NL*
years
yet
?
Just
as
he
finished
,
the
call-boy
came
;
so
,
haw-hawing
*NL*
like
a
demon
,
he
went
rattling
and
clanking
out
like
a
crate
of
*NL*
loose
castings
,
and
I
knew
nothing
more
.
It
was
some
minutes
*NL*
before
I
came
to
,
and
then
I
opened
my
eyes
just
in
time
to
see
*NL*
Sir
Gareth
fetch
him
an
awful
welt
,
and
I
unconsciously
out
with
*NL*
the
prayer
,
``
I
hope
to
gracious
he
's
killed
!
''
But
by
ill-luck
,
*NL*
before
I
had
got
half
through
with
the
words
,
Sir
Gareth
crashed
*NL*
into
Sir
Sagramor
le
Desirous
and
sent
him
thundering
over
his
*NL*
horse
's
crupper
,
and
Sir
Sagramor
caught
my
remark
and
thought
*NL*
I
meant
it
for
_
him
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
whenever
one
of
those
people
got
a
thing
into
his
head
,
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
it
out
again
.
I
knew
that
,
so
I
saved
my
*NL*
breath
,
and
offered
no
explanations
.
As
soon
as
Sir
Sagramor
*NL*
got
well
,
he
notified
me
that
there
was
a
little
account
to
settle
*NL*
between
us
,
and
he
named
a
day
three
or
four
years
in
the
future
;
*NL*
place
of
settlement
,
the
lists
where
the
offense
had
been
given
.
*NL*
I
said
I
would
be
ready
when
he
got
back
.
You
see
,
he
was
going
*NL*
for
the
Holy
Grail
.
The
boys
all
took
a
flier
at
the
Holy
Grail
*NL*
now
and
then
.
It
was
a
several
years
'
cruise
.
They
always
put
in
*NL*
the
long
absence
snooping
around
,
in
the
most
conscientious
way
,
*NL*
though
none
of
them
had
any
idea
where
the
Holy
Grail
really
was
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
think
any
of
them
actually
expected
to
find
it
,
or
*NL*
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
it
if
he
_
had
_
run
across
it
.
*NL*
You
see
,
it
was
just
the
Northwest
Passage
of
that
day
,
as
you
may
*NL*
say
;
that
was
all
.
Every
year
expeditions
went
out
holy
grailing
,
*NL*
and
next
year
relief
expeditions
went
out
to
hunt
for
_
them
_
.
There
*NL*
was
worlds
of
reputation
in
it
,
but
no
money
.
Why
,
they
actually
*NL*
wanted
_
me
_
to
put
in
!
Well
,
I
should
smile
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
BEGINNINGS
OF
CIVILIZATION
*NL*
*NL*
The
Round
Table
soon
heard
of
the
challenge
,
and
of
course
it
was
*NL*
a
good
deal
discussed
,
for
such
things
interested
the
boys
.
*NL*
The
king
thought
I
ought
now
to
set
forth
in
quest
of
adventures
,
*NL*
so
that
I
might
gain
renown
and
be
the
more
worthy
to
meet
*NL*
Sir
Sagramor
when
the
several
years
should
have
rolled
away
.
*NL*
I
excused
myself
for
the
present
;
I
said
it
would
take
me
three
*NL*
or
four
years
yet
to
get
things
well
fixed
up
and
going
smoothly
;
*NL*
then
I
should
be
ready
;
all
the
chances
were
that
at
the
end
of
*NL*
that
time
Sir
Sagramor
would
still
be
out
grailing
,
so
no
valuable
*NL*
time
would
be
lost
by
the
postponement
;
I
should
then
have
been
*NL*
in
office
six
or
seven
years
,
and
I
believed
my
system
and
machinery
*NL*
would
be
so
well
developed
that
I
could
take
a
holiday
without
*NL*
its
working
any
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
what
I
had
already
accomplished
.
*NL*
In
various
quiet
nooks
and
corners
I
had
the
beginnings
of
all
*NL*
sorts
of
industries
under
way
--
nuclei
of
future
vast
factories
,
*NL*
the
iron
and
steel
missionaries
of
my
future
civilization
.
In
these
*NL*
were
gathered
together
the
brightest
young
minds
I
could
find
,
*NL*
and
I
kept
agents
out
raking
the
country
for
more
,
all
the
time
.
*NL*
I
was
training
a
crowd
of
ignorant
folk
into
experts
--
experts
*NL*
in
every
sort
of
handiwork
and
scientific
calling
.
These
nurseries
*NL*
of
mine
went
smoothly
and
privately
along
undisturbed
in
their
*NL*
obscure
country
retreats
,
for
nobody
was
allowed
to
come
into
their
*NL*
precincts
without
a
special
permit
--
for
I
was
afraid
of
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
started
a
teacher-factory
and
a
lot
of
Sunday-schools
the
*NL*
first
thing
;
as
a
result
,
I
now
had
an
admirable
system
of
graded
*NL*
schools
in
full
blast
in
those
places
,
and
also
a
complete
variety
*NL*
of
Protestant
congregations
all
in
a
prosperous
and
growing
*NL*
condition
.
Everybody
could
be
any
kind
of
a
Christian
he
wanted
*NL*
to
;
there
was
perfect
freedom
in
that
matter
.
But
I
confined
public
*NL*
religious
teaching
to
the
churches
and
the
Sunday-schools
,
permitting
*NL*
nothing
of
it
in
my
other
educational
buildings
.
I
could
have
*NL*
given
my
own
sect
the
preference
and
made
everybody
a
Presbyterian
*NL*
without
any
trouble
,
but
that
would
have
been
to
affront
a
law
*NL*
of
human
nature
:
spiritual
wants
and
instincts
are
as
various
in
*NL*
the
human
family
as
are
physical
appetites
,
complexions
,
and
*NL*
features
,
and
a
man
is
only
at
his
best
,
morally
,
when
he
is
*NL*
equipped
with
the
religious
garment
whose
color
and
shape
and
*NL*
size
most
nicely
accommodate
themselves
to
the
spiritual
complexion
,
*NL*
angularities
,
and
stature
of
the
individual
who
wears
it
;
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
I
was
afraid
of
a
united
Church
;
it
makes
a
mighty
power
,
*NL*
the
mightiest
conceivable
,
and
then
when
it
by
and
by
gets
into
*NL*
selfish
hands
,
as
it
is
always
bound
to
do
,
it
means
death
to
*NL*
human
liberty
and
paralysis
to
human
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
mines
were
royal
property
,
and
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
.
*NL*
They
had
formerly
been
worked
as
savages
always
work
mines
--
holes
*NL*
grubbed
in
the
earth
and
the
mineral
brought
up
in
sacks
of
hide
by
*NL*
hand
,
at
the
rate
of
a
ton
a
day
;
but
I
had
begun
to
put
the
mining
*NL*
on
a
scientific
basis
as
early
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
had
made
pretty
handsome
progress
when
Sir
Sagramor
's
*NL*
challenge
struck
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
years
rolled
by
--
and
then
!
Well
,
you
would
never
imagine
*NL*
it
in
the
world
.
Unlimited
power
is
the
ideal
thing
when
it
is
in
*NL*
safe
hands
.
The
despotism
of
heaven
is
the
one
absolutely
perfect
*NL*
government
.
An
earthly
despotism
would
be
the
absolutely
perfect
*NL*
earthly
government
,
if
the
conditions
were
the
same
,
namely
,
the
*NL*
despot
the
perfectest
individual
of
the
human
race
,
and
his
lease
*NL*
of
life
perpetual
.
But
as
a
perishable
perfect
man
must
die
,
and
*NL*
leave
his
despotism
in
the
hands
of
an
imperfect
successor
,
an
*NL*
earthly
despotism
is
not
merely
a
bad
form
of
government
,
it
is
*NL*
the
worst
form
that
is
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
works
showed
what
a
despot
could
do
with
the
resources
of
*NL*
a
kingdom
at
his
command
.
Unsuspected
by
this
dark
land
,
I
had
*NL*
the
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century
booming
under
its
very
*NL*
nose
!
It
was
fenced
away
from
the
public
view
,
but
there
it
was
,
*NL*
a
gigantic
and
unassailable
fact
--
and
to
be
heard
from
,
yet
,
if
*NL*
I
lived
and
had
luck
.
There
it
was
,
as
sure
a
fact
and
as
substantial
*NL*
a
fact
as
any
serene
volcano
,
standing
innocent
with
its
smokeless
*NL*
summit
in
the
blue
sky
and
giving
no
sign
of
the
rising
hell
in
its
*NL*
bowels
.
My
schools
and
churches
were
children
four
years
before
;
*NL*
they
were
grown-up
now
;
my
shops
of
that
day
were
vast
factories
*NL*
now
;
where
I
had
a
dozen
trained
men
then
,
I
had
a
thousand
now
;
*NL*
where
I
had
one
brilliant
expert
then
,
I
had
fifty
now
.
I
stood
*NL*
with
my
hand
on
the
cock
,
so
to
speak
,
ready
to
turn
it
on
and
*NL*
flood
the
midnight
world
with
light
at
any
moment
.
But
I
was
not
*NL*
going
to
do
the
thing
in
that
sudden
way
.
It
was
not
my
policy
.
*NL*
The
people
could
not
have
stood
it
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
should
have
*NL*
had
the
Established
Roman
Catholic
Church
on
my
back
in
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
I
had
been
going
cautiously
all
the
while
.
I
had
had
confidential
*NL*
agents
trickling
through
the
country
some
time
,
whose
office
was
*NL*
to
undermine
knighthood
by
imperceptible
degrees
,
and
to
gnaw
*NL*
a
little
at
this
and
that
and
the
other
superstition
,
and
so
prepare
*NL*
the
way
gradually
for
a
better
order
of
things
.
I
was
turning
on
*NL*
my
light
one-candle-power
at
a
time
,
and
meant
to
continue
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
scattered
some
branch
schools
secretly
about
the
kingdom
,
*NL*
and
they
were
doing
very
well
.
I
meant
to
work
this
racket
more
*NL*
and
more
,
as
time
wore
on
,
if
nothing
occurred
to
frighten
me
.
*NL*
One
of
my
deepest
secrets
was
my
West
Point
--
my
military
academy
.
*NL*
I
kept
that
most
jealously
out
of
sight
;
and
I
did
the
same
with
my
*NL*
naval
academy
which
I
had
established
at
a
remote
seaport
.
Both
*NL*
were
prospering
to
my
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clarence
was
twenty-two
now
,
and
was
my
head
executive
,
my
right
*NL*
hand
.
He
was
a
darling
;
he
was
equal
to
anything
;
there
was
n't
*NL*
anything
he
could
n't
turn
his
hand
to
.
Of
late
I
had
been
training
*NL*
him
for
journalism
,
for
the
time
seemed
about
right
for
a
start
*NL*
in
the
newspaper
line
;
nothing
big
,
but
just
a
small
weekly
for
*NL*
experimental
circulation
in
my
civilization-nurseries
.
He
took
*NL*
to
it
like
a
duck
;
there
was
an
editor
concealed
in
him
,
sure
.
*NL*
Already
he
had
doubled
himself
in
one
way
;
he
talked
sixth
century
*NL*
and
wrote
nineteenth
.
His
journalistic
style
was
climbing
,
*NL*
steadily
;
it
was
already
up
to
the
back
settlement
Alabama
mark
,
*NL*
and
could
n't
be
told
from
the
editorial
output
of
that
region
*NL*
either
by
matter
or
flavor
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
another
large
departure
on
hand
,
too
.
This
was
a
telegraph
*NL*
and
a
telephone
;
our
first
venture
in
this
line
.
These
wires
were
*NL*
for
private
service
only
,
as
yet
,
and
must
be
kept
private
until
*NL*
a
riper
day
should
come
.
We
had
a
gang
of
men
on
the
road
,
working
*NL*
mainly
by
night
.
They
were
stringing
ground
wires
;
we
were
afraid
*NL*
to
put
up
poles
,
for
they
would
attract
too
much
inquiry
.
Ground
*NL*
wires
were
good
enough
,
in
both
instances
,
for
my
wires
were
*NL*
protected
by
an
insulation
of
my
own
invention
which
was
perfect
.
*NL*
My
men
had
orders
to
strike
across
country
,
avoiding
roads
,
and
*NL*
establishing
connection
with
any
considerable
towns
whose
lights
*NL*
betrayed
their
presence
,
and
leaving
experts
in
charge
.
Nobody
*NL*
could
tell
you
how
to
find
any
place
in
the
kingdom
,
for
nobody
*NL*
ever
went
intentionally
to
any
place
,
but
only
struck
it
by
*NL*
accident
in
his
wanderings
,
and
then
generally
left
it
without
*NL*
thinking
to
inquire
what
its
name
was
.
At
one
time
and
another
*NL*
we
had
sent
out
topographical
expeditions
to
survey
and
map
the
*NL*
kingdom
,
but
the
priests
had
always
interfered
and
raised
trouble
.
*NL*
So
we
had
given
the
thing
up
,
for
the
present
;
it
would
be
poor
*NL*
wisdom
to
antagonize
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
general
condition
of
the
country
,
it
was
as
it
had
been
*NL*
when
I
arrived
in
it
,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
.
I
had
made
*NL*
changes
,
but
they
were
necessarily
slight
,
and
they
were
not
*NL*
noticeable
.
Thus
far
,
I
had
not
even
meddled
with
taxation
,
*NL*
outside
of
the
taxes
which
provided
the
royal
revenues
.
I
had
*NL*
systematized
those
,
and
put
the
service
on
an
effective
and
*NL*
righteous
basis
.
As
a
result
,
these
revenues
were
already
quadrupled
,
*NL*
and
yet
the
burden
was
so
much
more
equably
distributed
than
*NL*
before
,
that
all
the
kingdom
felt
a
sense
of
relief
,
and
the
praises
*NL*
of
my
administration
were
hearty
and
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Personally
,
I
struck
an
interruption
,
now
,
but
I
did
not
mind
it
,
*NL*
it
could
not
have
happened
at
a
better
time
.
Earlier
it
could
*NL*
have
annoyed
me
,
but
now
everything
was
in
good
hands
and
swimming
*NL*
right
along
.
The
king
had
reminded
me
several
times
,
of
late
,
that
*NL*
the
postponement
I
had
asked
for
,
four
years
before
,
had
about
*NL*
run
out
now
.
It
was
a
hint
that
I
ought
to
be
starting
out
to
seek
*NL*
adventures
and
get
up
a
reputation
of
a
size
to
make
me
worthy
*NL*
of
the
honor
of
breaking
a
lance
with
Sir
Sagramor
,
who
was
still
*NL*
out
grailing
,
but
was
being
hunted
for
by
various
relief
expeditions
,
*NL*
and
might
be
found
any
year
,
now
.
So
you
see
I
was
expecting
*NL*
this
interruption
;
it
did
not
take
me
by
surprise
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
YANKEE
IN
SEARCH
OF
ADVENTURES
*NL*
*NL*
There
never
was
such
a
country
for
wandering
liars
;
and
they
were
*NL*
of
both
sexes
.
Hardly
a
month
went
by
without
one
of
these
tramps
*NL*
arriving
;
and
generally
loaded
with
a
tale
about
some
princess
or
*NL*
other
wanting
help
to
get
her
out
of
some
far-away
castle
where
*NL*
she
was
held
in
captivity
by
a
lawless
scoundrel
,
usually
a
giant
.
*NL*
Now
you
would
think
that
the
first
thing
the
king
would
do
after
*NL*
listening
to
such
a
novelette
from
an
entire
stranger
,
would
be
*NL*
to
ask
for
credentials
--
yes
,
and
a
pointer
or
two
as
to
locality
*NL*
of
castle
,
best
route
to
it
,
and
so
on
.
But
nobody
ever
thought
*NL*
of
so
simple
and
common-sense
a
thing
at
that
.
No
,
everybody
*NL*
swallowed
these
people
's
lies
whole
,
and
never
asked
a
question
*NL*
of
any
sort
or
about
anything
.
Well
,
one
day
when
I
was
not
*NL*
around
,
one
of
these
people
came
along
--
it
was
a
she
one
,
this
*NL*
time
--
and
told
a
tale
of
the
usual
pattern
.
Her
mistress
was
*NL*
a
captive
in
a
vast
and
gloomy
castle
,
along
with
forty-four
other
*NL*
young
and
beautiful
girls
,
pretty
much
all
of
them
princesses
;
*NL*
they
had
been
languishing
in
that
cruel
captivity
for
twenty-six
*NL*
years
;
the
masters
of
the
castle
were
three
stupendous
brothers
,
*NL*
each
with
four
arms
and
one
eye
--
the
eye
in
the
center
of
the
*NL*
forehead
,
and
as
big
as
a
fruit
.
Sort
of
fruit
not
mentioned
;
*NL*
their
usual
slovenliness
in
statistics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Would
you
believe
it
?
The
king
and
the
whole
Round
Table
were
*NL*
in
raptures
over
this
preposterous
opportunity
for
adventure
.
*NL*
Every
knight
of
the
Table
jumped
for
the
chance
,
and
begged
for
it
;
*NL*
but
to
their
vexation
and
chagrin
the
king
conferred
it
upon
me
,
*NL*
who
had
not
asked
for
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
an
effort
,
I
contained
my
joy
when
Clarence
brought
me
the
news
.
*NL*
But
he
--
he
could
not
contain
his
.
His
mouth
gushed
delight
and
*NL*
gratitude
in
a
steady
discharge
--
delight
in
my
good
fortune
,
*NL*
gratitude
to
the
king
for
this
splendid
mark
of
his
favor
for
me
.
*NL*
He
could
keep
neither
his
legs
nor
his
body
still
,
but
pirouetted
*NL*
about
the
place
in
an
airy
ecstasy
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
side
,
I
could
have
cursed
the
kindness
that
conferred
upon
*NL*
me
this
benefaction
,
but
I
kept
my
vexation
under
the
surface
*NL*
for
policy
's
sake
,
and
did
what
I
could
to
let
on
to
be
glad
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
_
said
_
I
was
glad
.
And
in
a
way
it
was
true
;
I
was
as
*NL*
glad
as
a
person
is
when
he
is
scalped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
one
must
make
the
best
of
things
,
and
not
waste
time
with
*NL*
useless
fretting
,
but
get
down
to
business
and
see
what
can
be
*NL*
done
.
In
all
lies
there
is
wheat
among
the
chaff
;
I
must
get
at
*NL*
the
wheat
in
this
case
:
so
I
sent
for
the
girl
and
she
came
.
She
*NL*
was
a
comely
enough
creature
,
and
soft
and
modest
,
but
,
if
signs
*NL*
went
for
anything
,
she
did
n't
know
as
much
as
a
lady
's
watch
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
have
you
been
questioned
as
to
particulars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
had
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
expect
you
had
,
but
I
thought
I
would
ask
,
to
make
*NL*
sure
;
it
's
the
way
I
've
been
raised
.
Now
you
must
n't
take
it
*NL*
unkindly
if
I
remind
you
that
as
we
do
n't
know
you
,
we
must
go
*NL*
a
little
slow
.
You
may
be
all
right
,
of
course
,
and
we
'll
hope
*NL*
that
you
are
;
but
to
take
it
for
granted
is
n't
business
.
_
You
_
*NL*
understand
that
.
I
'm
obliged
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
;
just
*NL*
answer
up
fair
and
square
,
and
do
n't
be
afraid

Where
do
you

live

when
you
are
at
home

*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
well
,
it
was
reasonably
plain
,
now
,
why
these
donkeys
did
n't
*NL*
prospect
these
liars
for
details
.
It
may
be
that
this
girl
had
*NL*
a
fact
in
her
somewhere
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
you
could
have
sluiced
*NL*
it
out
with
a
hydraulic
;
nor
got
it
with
the
earlier
forms
of
*NL*
blasting
,
even
;
it
was
a
case
for
dynamite
.
Why
,
she
was
a
perfect
*NL*
ass
;
and
yet
the
king
and
his
knights
had
listened
to
her
as
if
*NL*
she
had
been
a
leaf
out
of
the
gospel
.
It
kind
of
sizes
up
the
*NL*
whole
party
.
And
think
of
the
simple
ways
of
this
court
:
this
*NL*
wandering
wench
had
n't
any
more
trouble
to
get
access
to
the
king
*NL*
in
his
palace
than
she
would
have
had
to
get
into
the
poorhouse
*NL*
in
my
day
and
country
.
In
fact
,
he
was
glad
to
see
her
,
glad
*NL*
to
hear
her
tale
;
with
that
adventure
of
hers
to
offer
,
she
was
*NL*
as
welcome
as
a
corpse
is
to
a
coroner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
I
was
ending-up
these
reflections
,
Clarence
came
back
.
*NL*
I
remarked
upon
the
barren
result
of
my
efforts
with
the
girl
;
*NL*
had
n't
got
hold
of
a
single
point
that
could
help
me
to
find
*NL*
the
castle
.
The
youth
looked
a
little
surprised
,
or
puzzled
,
*NL*
or
something
,
and
intimated
that
he
had
been
wondering
to
himself
*NL*
what
I
had
wanted
to
ask
the
girl
all
those
questions
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
great
guns
,
''
I
said
,
``
do
n't
I
want
to
find
the
castle
?
And
*NL*
how
else
would
I
go
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
,
sweet
your
worship
,
one
may
lightly
answer

I
ween
.

She

They
always

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

*NL*
``
What

She
browse
around
the
hills
and
scour
the
woods
with
me
*NL*
--
alone
--
and
I
as
good
as
engaged
to
be
married
?
Why
,
it
's
scandalous
.
*NL*
Think
how
it
would
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
,
the
dear
face
that
rose
before
me
!
The
boy
was
eager
to
know
*NL*
all
about
this
tender
matter
.
I
swore
him
to
secrecy
and
then
*NL*
whispered
her
name
--
``
Puss
Flanagan
.
''
He
looked
disappointed
,
*NL*
and
said
he
did
n't
remember
the
countess
.
How
natural
it
was
for
*NL*
the
little
courtier
to
give
her
a
rank
.
He
asked
me
where
she
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
East
Har
--
''
I
came
to
myself
and
stopped
,
a
little
confused
;
*NL*
then
I
said
,
``
Never
mind
,
now
;
I
'll
tell
you
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
might
he
see
her
?
Would
I
let
him
see
her
some
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
a
little
thing
to
promise
--
thirteen
hundred
years
*NL*
or
so
--
and
he
so
eager
;
so
I
said
Yes
.
But
I
sighed
;
I
could
n't
*NL*
help
it
.
And
yet
there
was
no
sense
in
sighing
,
for
she
was
n't
*NL*
born
yet
.
But
that
is
the
way
we
are
made
:
we
do
n't
reason
,
*NL*
where
we
feel
;
we
just
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
expedition
was
all
the
talk
that
day
and
that
night
,
and
the
*NL*
boys
were
very
good
to
me
,
and
made
much
of
me
,
and
seemed
to
have
*NL*
forgotten
their
vexation
and
disappointment
,
and
come
to
be
as
*NL*
anxious
for
me
to
hive
those
ogres
and
set
those
ripe
old
virgins
*NL*
loose
as
if
it
were
themselves
that
had
the
contract
.
Well
,
they
*NL*
_
were
_
good
children
--
but
just
children
,
that
is
all
.
And
they
*NL*
gave
me
no
end
of
points
about
how
to
scout
for
giants
,
and
how
*NL*
to
scoop
them
in
;
and
they
told
me
all
sorts
of
charms
against
*NL*
enchantments
,
and
gave
me
salves
and
other
rubbish
to
put
on
my
*NL*
wounds
.
But
it
never
occurred
to
one
of
them
to
reflect
that
if
*NL*
I
was
such
a
wonderful
necromancer
as
I
was
pretending
to
be
,
*NL*
I
ought
not
to
need
salves
or
instructions
,
or
charms
against
*NL*
enchantments
,
and
,
least
of
all
,
arms
and
armor
,
on
a
foray
of
any
*NL*
kind
--
even
against
fire-spouting
dragons
,
and
devils
hot
from
*NL*
perdition
,
let
alone
such
poor
adversaries
as
these
I
was
after
,
*NL*
these
commonplace
ogres
of
the
back
settlements
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
have
an
early
breakfast
,
and
start
at
dawn
,
for
that
was
*NL*
the
usual
way
;
but
I
had
the
demon
's
own
time
with
my
armor
,
*NL*
and
this
delayed
me
a
little
.
It
is
troublesome
to
get
into
,
and
*NL*
there
is
so
much
detail
.
First
you
wrap
a
layer
or
two
of
blanket
*NL*
around
your
body
,
for
a
sort
of
cushion
and
to
keep
off
the
cold
*NL*
iron
;
then
you
put
on
your
sleeves
and
shirt
of
chain
mail
--
these
*NL*
are
made
of
small
steel
links
woven
together
,
and
they
form
a
fabric
*NL*
so
flexible
that
if
you
toss
your
shirt
onto
the
floor
,
it
slumps
*NL*
into
a
pile
like
a
peck
of
wet
fish-net
;
it
is
very
heavy
and
*NL*
is
nearly
the
uncomfortablest
material
in
the
world
for
a
night
*NL*
shirt
,
yet
plenty
used
it
for
that
--
tax
collectors
,
and
reformers
,
*NL*
and
one-horse
kings
with
a
defective
title
,
and
those
sorts
of
*NL*
people
;
then
you
put
on
your
shoes
--
flat-boats
roofed
over
with
*NL*
interleaving
bands
of
steel
--
and
screw
your
clumsy
spurs
into
*NL*
the
heels
.
Next
you
buckle
your
greaves
on
your
legs
,
and
your
*NL*
cuisses
on
your
thighs
;
then
come
your
backplate
and
your
breastplate
,
*NL*
and
you
begin
to
feel
crowded
;
then
you
hitch
onto
the
breastplate
*NL*
the
half-petticoat
of
broad
overlapping
bands
of
steel
which
hangs
*NL*
down
in
front
but
is
scolloped
out
behind
so
you
can
sit
down
,
*NL*
and
is
n't
any
real
improvement
on
an
inverted
coal
scuttle
,
either
*NL*
for
looks
or
for
wear
,
or
to
wipe
your
hands
on
;
next
you
belt
*NL*
on
your
sword
;
then
you
put
your
stove-pipe
joints
onto
your
arms
,
*NL*
your
iron
gauntlets
onto
your
hands
,
your
iron
rat-trap
onto
your
*NL*
head
,
with
a
rag
of
steel
web
hitched
onto
it
to
hang
over
the
back
*NL*
of
your
neck
--
and
there
you
are
,
snug
as
a
candle
in
a
candle-mould
.
*NL*
This
is
no
time
to
dance
.
Well
,
a
man
that
is
packed
away
like
*NL*
that
is
a
nut
that
is
n't
worth
the
cracking
,
there
is
so
little
of
*NL*
the
meat
,
when
you
get
down
to
it
,
by
comparison
with
the
shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
helped
me
,
or
I
never
could
have
got
in
.
Just
as
we
*NL*
finished
,
Sir
Bedivere
happened
in
,
and
I
saw
that
as
like
as
not
*NL*
I
had
n't
chosen
the
most
convenient
outfit
for
a
long
trip
.
How
*NL*
stately
he
looked
;
and
tall
and
broad
and
grand
.
He
had
on
his
*NL*
head
a
conical
steel
casque
that
only
came
down
to
his
ears
,
and
*NL*
for
visor
had
only
a
narrow
steel
bar
that
extended
down
to
his
*NL*
upper
lip
and
protected
his
nose
;
and
all
the
rest
of
him
,
from
*NL*
neck
to
heel
,
was
flexible
chain
mail
,
trousers
and
all
.
But
*NL*
pretty
much
all
of
him
was
hidden
under
his
outside
garment
,
which
*NL*
of
course
was
of
chain
mail
,
as
I
said
,
and
hung
straight
from
his
*NL*
shoulders
to
his
ankles
;
and
from
his
middle
to
the
bottom
,
both
*NL*
before
and
behind
,
was
divided
,
so
that
he
could
ride
and
let
the
*NL*
skirts
hang
down
on
each
side
.
He
was
going
grailing
,
and
it
was
*NL*
just
the
outfit
for
it
,
too
.
I
would
have
given
a
good
deal
for
*NL*
that
ulster
,
but
it
was
too
late
now
to
be
fooling
around
.
The
sun
*NL*
was
just
up
,
the
king
and
the
court
were
all
on
hand
to
see
me
off
*NL*
and
wish
me
luck
;
so
it
would
n't
be
etiquette
for
me
to
tarry
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
get
on
your
horse
yourself
;
no
,
if
you
tried
it
you
*NL*
would
get
disappointed
.
They
carry
you
out
,
just
as
they
carry
*NL*
a
sun-struck
man
to
the
drug
store
,
and
put
you
on
,
and
help
get
*NL*
you
to
rights
,
and
fix
your
feet
in
the
stirrups
;
and
all
the
while
*NL*
you
do
feel
so
strange
and
stuffy
and
like
somebody
else
--
like
*NL*
somebody
that
has
been
married
on
a
sudden
,
or
struck
by
lightning
,
*NL*
or
something
like
that
,
and
has
n't
quite
fetched
around
yet
,
and
*NL*
is
sort
of
numb
,
and
ca
n't
just
get
his
bearings
.
Then
they
*NL*
stood
up
the
mast
they
called
a
spear
,
in
its
socket
by
my
left
*NL*
foot
,
and
I
gripped
it
with
my
hand
;
lastly
they
hung
my
shield
*NL*
around
my
neck
,
and
I
was
all
complete
and
ready
to
up
anchor
*NL*
and
get
to
sea
.
Everybody
was
as
good
to
me
as
they
could
be
,
*NL*
and
a
maid
of
honor
gave
me
the
stirrup-cup
her
own
self
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
more
to
do
now
,
but
for
that
damsel
to
get
up
behind
me
on
*NL*
a
pillion
,
which
she
did
,
and
put
an
arm
or
so
around
me
to
hold
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
started
,
and
everybody
gave
us
a
goodbye
and
waved
their
*NL*
handkerchiefs
or
helmets
.
And
everybody
we
met
,
going
down
the
hill
*NL*
and
through
the
village
was
respectful
to
us
,
except
some
shabby
*NL*
little
boys
on
the
outskirts
.
They
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
a
guy
!
''
And
hove
clods
at
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
experience
boys
are
the
same
in
all
ages
.
They
do
n't
respect
*NL*
anything
,
they
do
n't
care
for
anything
or
anybody
.
They
say
*NL*
``
Go
up
,
baldhead
''
to
the
prophet
going
his
unoffending
way
in
*NL*
the
gray
of
antiquity
;
they
sass
me
in
the
holy
gloom
of
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
;
and
I
had
seen
them
act
the
same
way
in
Buchanan
's
*NL*
administration
;
I
remember
,
because
I
was
there
and
helped
.
The
*NL*
prophet
had
his
bears
and
settled
with
his
boys
;
and
I
wanted
*NL*
to
get
down
and
settle
with
mine
,
but
it
would
n't
answer
,
because
*NL*
I
could
n't
have
got
up
again
.
I
hate
a
country
without
a
derrick
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
SLOW
TORTURE
*NL*
*NL*
Straight
off
,
we
were
in
the
country
.
It
was
most
lovely
and
*NL*
pleasant
in
those
sylvan
solitudes
in
the
early
cool
morning
*NL*
in
the
first
freshness
of
autumn
.
From
hilltops
we
saw
fair
*NL*
green
valleys
lying
spread
out
below
,
with
streams
winding
through
*NL*
them
,
and
island
groves
of
trees
here
and
there
,
and
huge
lonely
*NL*
oaks
scattered
about
and
casting
black
blots
of
shade
;
and
beyond
*NL*
the
valleys
we
saw
the
ranges
of
hills
,
blue
with
haze
,
stretching
*NL*
away
in
billowy
perspective
to
the
horizon
,
with
at
wide
intervals
*NL*
a
dim
fleck
of
white
or
gray
on
a
wave-summit
,
which
we
knew
was
*NL*
a
castle
.
We
crossed
broad
natural
lawns
sparkling
with
dew
,
*NL*
and
we
moved
like
spirits
,
the
cushioned
turf
giving
out
no
sound
*NL*
of
footfall
;
we
dreamed
along
through
glades
in
a
mist
of
green
*NL*
light
that
got
its
tint
from
the
sun-drenched
roof
of
leaves
*NL*
overhead
,
and
by
our
feet
the
clearest
and
coldest
of
runlets
*NL*
went
frisking
and
gossiping
over
its
reefs
and
making
a
sort
of
*NL*
whispering
music
,
comfortable
to
hear
;
and
at
times
we
left
the
*NL*
world
behind
and
entered
into
the
solemn
great
deeps
and
rich
*NL*
gloom
of
the
forest
,
where
furtive
wild
things
whisked
and
scurried
*NL*
by
and
were
gone
before
you
could
even
get
your
eye
on
the
place
*NL*
where
the
noise
was
;
and
where
only
the
earliest
birds
were
turning
*NL*
out
and
getting
to
business
with
a
song
here
and
a
quarrel
yonder
*NL*
and
a
mysterious
far-off
hammering
and
drumming
for
worms
on
*NL*
a
tree
trunk
away
somewhere
in
the
impenetrable
remotenesses
of
*NL*
the
woods
.
And
by
and
by
out
we
would
swing
again
into
the
glare
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
third
or
fourth
or
fifth
time
that
we
swung
out
into
*NL*
the
glare
--
it
was
along
there
somewhere
,
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
*NL*
after
sun-up
--
it
was
n't
as
pleasant
as
it
had
been
.
It
was
*NL*
beginning
to
get
hot
.
This
was
quite
noticeable
.
We
had
a
very
*NL*
long
pull
,
after
that
,
without
any
shade
.
Now
it
is
curious
how
*NL*
progressively
little
frets
grow
and
multiply
after
they
once
get
*NL*
a
start
.
Things
which
I
did
n't
mind
at
all
,
at
first
,
I
began
*NL*
to
mind
now
--
and
more
and
more
,
too
,
all
the
time
.
The
first
*NL*
ten
or
fifteen
times
I
wanted
my
handkerchief
I
did
n't
seem
to
care
;
*NL*
I
got
along
,
and
said
never
mind
,
it
is
n't
any
matter
,
and
dropped
*NL*
it
out
of
my
mind
.
But
now
it
was
different
;
I
wanted
it
all
*NL*
the
time
;
it
was
nag
,
nag
,
nag
,
right
along
,
and
no
rest
;
I
could
n't
*NL*
get
it
out
of
my
mind
;
and
so
at
last
I
lost
my
temper
and
said
*NL*
hang
a
man
that
would
make
a
suit
of
armor
without
any
pockets
*NL*
in
it
.
You
see
I
had
my
handkerchief
in
my
helmet
;
and
some
other
*NL*
things
;
but
it
was
that
kind
of
a
helmet
that
you
ca
n't
take
off
*NL*
by
yourself
.
That
had
n't
occurred
to
me
when
I
put
it
there
;
*NL*
and
in
fact
I
did
n't
know
it
.
I
supposed
it
would
be
particularly
*NL*
convenient
there
.
And
so
now
,
the
thought
of
its
being
there
,
*NL*
so
handy
and
close
by
,
and
yet
not
get-at-able
,
made
it
all
the
*NL*
worse
and
the
harder
to
bear
.
Yes
,
the
thing
that
you
ca
n't
get
*NL*
is
the
thing
that
you
want
,
mainly
;
every
one
has
noticed
that
.
*NL*
Well
,
it
took
my
mind
off
from
everything
else
;
took
it
clear
off
,
*NL*
and
centered
it
in
my
helmet
;
and
mile
after
mile
,
there
it
stayed
,
*NL*
imagining
the
handkerchief
,
picturing
the
handkerchief
;
and
it
*NL*
was
bitter
and
aggravating
to
have
the
salt
sweat
keep
trickling
*NL*
down
into
my
eyes
,
and
I
could
n't
get
at
it
.
It
seems
like
a
little
*NL*
thing
,
on
paper
,
but
it
was
not
a
little
thing
at
all
;
it
was
*NL*
the
most
real
kind
of
misery
.
I
would
not
say
it
if
it
was
not
so
.
*NL*
I
made
up
my
mind
that
I
would
carry
along
a
reticule
next
time
,
*NL*
let
it
look
how
it
might
,
and
people
say
what
they
would
.
Of
course
*NL*
these
iron
dudes
of
the
Round
Table
would
think
it
was
scandalous
,
*NL*
and
maybe
raise
Sheol
about
it
,
but
as
for
me
,
give
me
comfort
*NL*
first
,
and
style
afterwards
.
So
we
jogged
along
,
and
now
and
then
*NL*
we
struck
a
stretch
of
dust
,
and
it
would
tumble
up
in
clouds
and
*NL*
get
into
my
nose
and
make
me
sneeze
and
cry
;
and
of
course
I
said
*NL*
things
I
ought
n't
to
have
said
,
I
do
n't
deny
that
.
I
am
not
*NL*
better
than
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
n't
seem
to
meet
anybody
in
this
lonesome
Britain
,
not
*NL*
even
an
ogre
;
and
,
in
the
mood
I
was
in
then
,
it
was
well
for
*NL*
the
ogre
;
that
is
,
an
ogre
with
a
handkerchief
.
Most
knights
*NL*
would
have
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
his
armor
;
but
so
I
got
*NL*
his
bandanna
,
he
could
keep
his
hardware
,
for
all
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
it
was
getting
hotter
and
hotter
in
there
.
You
see
,
*NL*
the
sun
was
beating
down
and
warming
up
the
iron
more
and
more
*NL*
all
the
time
.
Well
,
when
you
are
hot
,
that
way
,
every
little
thing
*NL*
irritates
you
.
When
I
trotted
,
I
rattled
like
a
crate
of
dishes
,
*NL*
and
that
annoyed
me
;
and
moreover
I
could
n't
seem
to
stand
that
*NL*
shield
slatting
and
banging
,
now
about
my
breast
,
now
around
my
*NL*
back
;
and
if
I
dropped
into
a
walk
my
joints
creaked
and
screeched
*NL*
in
that
wearisome
way
that
a
wheelbarrow
does
,
and
as
we
did
n't
*NL*
create
any
breeze
at
that
gait
,
I
was
like
to
get
fried
in
that
*NL*
stove
;
and
besides
,
the
quieter
you
went
the
heavier
the
iron
*NL*
settled
down
on
you
and
the
more
and
more
tons
you
seemed
to
weigh
*NL*
every
minute
.
And
you
had
to
be
always
changing
hands
,
and
passing
*NL*
your
spear
over
to
the
other
foot
,
it
got
so
irksome
for
one
hand
*NL*
to
hold
it
long
at
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
you
know
,
when
you
perspire
that
way
,
in
rivers
,
there
comes
*NL*
a
time
when
you
--
when
you
--
well
,
when
you
itch
.
You
are
inside
,
*NL*
your
hands
are
outside
;
so
there
you
are
;
nothing
but
iron
between
.
*NL*
It
is
not
a
light
thing
,
let
it
sound
as
it
may
.
First
it
is
one
*NL*
place
;
then
another
;
then
some
more
;
and
it
goes
on
spreading
and
*NL*
spreading
,
and
at
last
the
territory
is
all
occupied
,
and
nobody
*NL*
can
imagine
what
you
feel
like
,
nor
how
unpleasant
it
is
.
And
*NL*
when
it
had
got
to
the
worst
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
I
could
*NL*
not
stand
anything
more
,
a
fly
got
in
through
the
bars
and
settled
*NL*
on
my
nose
,
and
the
bars
were
stuck
and
would
n't
work
,
and
I
*NL*
could
n't
get
the
visor
up
;
and
I
could
only
shake
my
head
,
which
*NL*
was
baking
hot
by
this
time
,
and
the
fly
--
well
,
you
know
how
a
fly
*NL*
acts
when
he
has
got
a
certainty
--
he
only
minded
the
shaking
enough
*NL*
to
change
from
nose
to
lip
,
and
lip
to
ear
,
and
buzz
and
buzz
*NL*
all
around
in
there
,
and
keep
on
lighting
and
biting
,
in
a
way
*NL*
that
a
person
,
already
so
distressed
as
I
was
,
simply
could
not
*NL*
stand
.
So
I
gave
in
,
and
got
Alisande
to
unship
the
helmet
and
*NL*
relieve
me
of
it
.
Then
she
emptied
the
conveniences
out
of
it
*NL*
and
fetched
it
full
of
water
,
and
I
drank
and
then
stood
up
,
and
*NL*
she
poured
the
rest
down
inside
the
armor
.
One
can
not
think
how
*NL*
refreshing
it
was
.
She
continued
to
fetch
and
pour
until
I
was
*NL*
well
soaked
and
thoroughly
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
good
to
have
a
rest
--
and
peace
.
But
nothing
is
quite
*NL*
perfect
in
this
life
,
at
any
time
.
I
had
made
a
pipe
a
while
back
,
*NL*
and
also
some
pretty
fair
tobacco
;
not
the
real
thing
,
but
what
*NL*
some
of
the
Indians
use
:
the
inside
bark
of
the
willow
,
dried
.
*NL*
These
comforts
had
been
in
the
helmet
,
and
now
I
had
them
again
,
*NL*
but
no
matches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
,
as
the
time
wore
along
,
one
annoying
fact
was
borne
in
*NL*
upon
my
understanding
--
that
we
were
weather-bound
.
An
armed
novice
*NL*
can
not
mount
his
horse
without
help
and
plenty
of
it
.
Sandy
was
*NL*
not
enough
;
not
enough
for
me
,
anyway
.
We
had
to
wait
until
*NL*
somebody
should
come
along
.
Waiting
,
in
silence
,
would
have
been
*NL*
agreeable
enough
,
for
I
was
full
of
matter
for
reflection
,
and
*NL*
wanted
to
give
it
a
chance
to
work
.
I
wanted
to
try
and
think
out
*NL*
how
it
was
that
rational
or
even
half-rational
men
could
ever
*NL*
have
learned
to
wear
armor
,
considering
its
inconveniences
;
and
*NL*
how
they
had
managed
to
keep
up
such
a
fashion
for
generations
*NL*
when
it
was
plain
that
what
I
had
suffered
to-day
they
had
had
*NL*
to
suffer
all
the
days
of
their
lives
.
I
wanted
to
think
that
out
;
*NL*
and
moreover
I
wanted
to
think
out
some
way
to
reform
this
evil
*NL*
and
persuade
the
people
to
let
the
foolish
fashion
die
out
;
but
*NL*
thinking
was
out
of
the
question
in
the
circumstances
.
You
could
n't
*NL*
think
,
where
Sandy
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
quite
biddable
creature
and
good-hearted
,
but
she
had
*NL*
a
flow
of
talk
that
was
as
steady
as
a
mill
,
and
made
your
head
*NL*
sore
like
the
drays
and
wagons
in
a
city
.
If
she
had
had
a
cork
*NL*
she
would
have
been
a
comfort
.
But
you
ca
n't
cork
that
kind
;
*NL*
they
would
die
.
Her
clack
was
going
all
day
,
and
you
would
think
*NL*
something
would
surely
happen
to
her
works
,
by
and
by
;
but
no
,
*NL*
they
never
got
out
of
order
;
and
she
never
had
to
slack
up
for
*NL*
words
.
She
could
grind
,
and
pump
,
and
churn
,
and
buzz
by
the
week
,
*NL*
and
never
stop
to
oil
up
or
blow
out
.
And
yet
the
result
was
just
*NL*
nothing
but
wind
.
She
never
had
any
ideas
,
any
more
than
a
fog
*NL*
has
.
She
was
a
perfect
blatherskite
;
I
mean
for
jaw
,
jaw
,
jaw
,
*NL*
talk
,
talk
,
talk
,
jabber
,
jabber
,
jabber
;
but
just
as
good
as
she
*NL*
could
be
.
I
had
n't
minded
her
mill
that
morning
,
on
account
of
*NL*
having
that
hornets
'
nest
of
other
troubles
;
but
more
than
once
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
I
had
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
rest
,
child
;
the
way
you
are
using
up
all
the
domestic
air
,
*NL*
the
kingdom
will
have
to
go
to
importing
it
by
to-morrow
,
and
it
's
*NL*
a
low
enough
treasury
without
that
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
FREEMEN
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
is
strange
how
little
a
while
at
a
time
a
person
can
be
*NL*
contented
.
Only
a
little
while
back
,
when
I
was
riding
and
*NL*
suffering
,
what
a
heaven
this
peace
,
this
rest
,
this
sweet
serenity
*NL*
in
this
secluded
shady
nook
by
this
purling
stream
would
have
*NL*
seemed
,
where
I
could
keep
perfectly
comfortable
all
the
time
*NL*
by
pouring
a
dipper
of
water
into
my
armor
now
and
then
;
yet
*NL*
already
I
was
getting
dissatisfied
;
partly
because
I
could
not
*NL*
light
my
pipe
--
for
,
although
I
had
long
ago
started
a
match
factory
,
*NL*
I
had
forgotten
to
bring
matches
with
me
--
and
partly
because
we
*NL*
had
nothing
to
eat
.
Here
was
another
illustration
of
the
childlike
*NL*
improvidence
of
this
age
and
people
.
A
man
in
armor
always
trusted
*NL*
to
chance
for
his
food
on
a
journey
,
and
would
have
been
scandalized
*NL*
at
the
idea
of
hanging
a
basket
of
sandwiches
on
his
spear
.
There
*NL*
was
probably
not
a
knight
of
all
the
Round
Table
combination
who
*NL*
would
not
rather
have
died
than
been
caught
carrying
such
a
thing
*NL*
as
that
on
his
flagstaff
.
And
yet
there
could
not
be
anything
more
*NL*
sensible
.
It
had
been
my
intention
to
smuggle
a
couple
of
sandwiches
*NL*
into
my
helmet
,
but
I
was
interrupted
in
the
act
,
and
had
to
make
*NL*
an
excuse
and
lay
them
aside
,
and
a
dog
got
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
approached
,
and
with
it
a
storm
.
The
darkness
came
on
fast
.
*NL*
We
must
camp
,
of
course
.
I
found
a
good
shelter
for
the
demoiselle
*NL*
under
a
rock
,
and
went
off
and
found
another
for
myself
.
But
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
remain
in
my
armor
,
because
I
could
not
get
it
off
*NL*
by
myself
and
yet
could
not
allow
Alisande
to
help
,
because
it
*NL*
would
have
seemed
so
like
undressing
before
folk
.
It
would
not
*NL*
have
amounted
to
that
in
reality
,
because
I
had
clothes
on
*NL*
underneath
;
but
the
prejudices
of
one
's
breeding
are
not
gotten
*NL*
rid
of
just
at
a
jump
,
and
I
knew
that
when
it
came
to
stripping
*NL*
off
that
bob-tailed
iron
petticoat
I
should
be
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
storm
came
a
change
of
weather
;
and
the
stronger
the
wind
*NL*
blew
,
and
the
wilder
the
rain
lashed
around
,
the
colder
and
colder
*NL*
it
got
.
Pretty
soon
,
various
kinds
of
bugs
and
ants
and
worms
*NL*
and
things
began
to
flock
in
out
of
the
wet
and
crawl
down
inside
*NL*
my
armor
to
get
warm
;
and
while
some
of
them
behaved
well
enough
,
*NL*
and
snuggled
up
amongst
my
clothes
and
got
quiet
,
the
majority
*NL*
were
of
a
restless
,
uncomfortable
sort
,
and
never
stayed
still
,
*NL*
but
went
on
prowling
and
hunting
for
they
did
not
know
what
;
*NL*
especially
the
ants
,
which
went
tickling
along
in
wearisome
*NL*
procession
from
one
end
of
me
to
the
other
by
the
hour
,
and
are
*NL*
a
kind
of
creatures
which
I
never
wish
to
sleep
with
again
.
*NL*
It
would
be
my
advice
to
persons
situated
in
this
way
,
to
not
roll
*NL*
or
thrash
around
,
because
this
excites
the
interest
of
all
the
*NL*
different
sorts
of
animals
and
makes
every
last
one
of
them
want
*NL*
to
turn
out
and
see
what
is
going
on
,
and
this
makes
things
worse
*NL*
than
they
were
before
,
and
of
course
makes
you
objurgate
harder
,
*NL*
too
,
if
you
can
.
Still
,
if
one
did
not
roll
and
thrash
around
*NL*
he
would
die
;
so
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
do
one
way
as
the
other
;
*NL*
there
is
no
real
choice
.
Even
after
I
was
frozen
solid
I
could
*NL*
still
distinguish
that
tickling
,
just
as
a
corpse
does
when
he
is
*NL*
taking
electric
treatment
.
I
said
I
would
never
wear
armor
*NL*
after
this
trip
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
trying
hours
whilst
I
was
frozen
and
yet
was
in
a
living
*NL*
fire
,
as
you
may
say
,
on
account
of
that
swarm
of
crawlers
,
that
*NL*
same
unanswerable
question
kept
circling
and
circling
through
my
*NL*
tired
head
:
How
do
people
stand
this
miserable
armor
?
How
have
*NL*
they
managed
to
stand
it
all
these
generations
?
How
can
they
sleep
*NL*
at
night
for
dreading
the
tortures
of
next
day
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
morning
came
at
last
,
I
was
in
a
bad
enough
plight
:
seedy
,
*NL*
drowsy
,
fagged
,
from
want
of
sleep
;
weary
from
thrashing
around
,
*NL*
famished
from
long
fasting
;
pining
for
a
bath
,
and
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
the
animals
;
and
crippled
with
rheumatism
.
And
how
had
it
fared
*NL*
with
the
nobly
born
,
the
titled
aristocrat
,
the
Demoiselle
Alisande
*NL*
la
Carteloise
?
Why
,
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
squirrel
;
she
had
slept
*NL*
like
the
dead
;
and
as
for
a
bath
,
probably
neither
she
nor
any
*NL*
other
noble
in
the
land
had
ever
had
one
,
and
so
she
was
not
*NL*
missing
it
.
Measured
by
modern
standards
,
they
were
merely
modified
*NL*
savages
,
those
people
.
This
noble
lady
showed
no
impatience
to
get
*NL*
to
breakfast
--
and
that
smacks
of
the
savage
,
too
.
On
their
journeys
*NL*
those
Britons
were
used
to
long
fasts
,
and
knew
how
to
bear
them
;
*NL*
and
also
how
to
freight
up
against
probable
fasts
before
starting
,
*NL*
after
the
style
of
the
Indian
and
the
anaconda
.
As
like
as
not
,
*NL*
Sandy
was
loaded
for
a
three-day
stretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
off
before
sunrise
,
Sandy
riding
and
I
limping
along
*NL*
behind
.
In
half
an
hour
we
came
upon
a
group
of
ragged
poor
*NL*
creatures
who
had
assembled
to
mend
the
thing
which
was
regarded
*NL*
as
a
road
.
They
were
as
humble
as
animals
to
me
;
and
when
I
*NL*
proposed
to
breakfast
with
them
,
they
were
so
flattered
,
so
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
this
extraordinary
condescension
of
mine
that
*NL*
at
first
they
were
not
able
to
believe
that
I
was
in
earnest
.
*NL*
My
lady
put
up
her
scornful
lip
and
withdrew
to
one
side
;
she
said
*NL*
in
their
hearing
that
she
would
as
soon
think
of
eating
with
the
*NL*
other
cattle
--
a
remark
which
embarrassed
these
poor
devils
merely
*NL*
because
it
referred
to
them
,
and
not
because
it
insulted
or
offended
*NL*
them
,
for
it
did
n't
.
And
yet
they
were
not
slaves
,
not
chattels
.
*NL*
By
a
sarcasm
of
law
and
phrase
they
were
freemen
.
Seven-tenths
*NL*
of
the
free
population
of
the
country
were
of
just
their
class
and
*NL*
degree
:
small
``
independent
''
farmers
,
artisans
,
etc.
;
which
is
*NL*
to
say
,
they
were
the
nation
,
the
actual
Nation
;
they
were
about
*NL*
all
of
it
that
was
useful
,
or
worth
saving
,
or
really
respect-worthy
,
*NL*
and
to
subtract
them
would
have
been
to
subtract
the
Nation
and
*NL*
leave
behind
some
dregs
,
some
refuse
,
in
the
shape
of
a
king
,
*NL*
nobility
and
gentry
,
idle
,
unproductive
,
acquainted
mainly
with
*NL*
the
arts
of
wasting
and
destroying
,
and
of
no
sort
of
use
or
value
*NL*
in
any
rationally
constructed
world
.
And
yet
,
by
ingenious
*NL*
contrivance
,
this
gilded
minority
,
instead
of
being
in
the
tail
*NL*
of
the
procession
where
it
belonged
,
was
marching
head
up
and
*NL*
banners
flying
,
at
the
other
end
of
it
;
had
elected
itself
to
be
*NL*
the
Nation
,
and
these
innumerable
clams
had
permitted
it
so
long
*NL*
that
they
had
come
at
last
to
accept
it
as
a
truth
;
and
not
only
*NL*
that
,
but
to
believe
it
right
and
as
it
should
be
.
The
priests
*NL*
had
told
their
fathers
and
themselves
that
this
ironical
state
*NL*
of
things
was
ordained
of
God
;
and
so
,
not
reflecting
upon
how
*NL*
unlike
God
it
would
be
to
amuse
himself
with
sarcasms
,
and
especially
*NL*
such
poor
transparent
ones
as
this
,
they
had
dropped
the
matter
*NL*
there
and
become
respectfully
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
of
these
meek
people
had
a
strange
enough
sound
in
*NL*
a
formerly
American
ear
.
They
were
freemen
,
but
they
could
not
*NL*
leave
the
estates
of
their
lord
or
their
bishop
without
his
*NL*
permission
;
they
could
not
prepare
their
own
bread
,
but
must
have
*NL*
their
corn
ground
and
their
bread
baked
at
his
mill
and
his
bakery
,
*NL*
and
pay
roundly
for
the
same
;
they
could
not
sell
a
piece
of
their
*NL*
own
property
without
paying
him
a
handsome
percentage
of
the
*NL*
proceeds
,
nor
buy
a
piece
of
somebody
else
's
without
remembering
*NL*
him
in
cash
for
the
privilege
;
they
had
to
harvest
his
grain
for
him
*NL*
gratis
,
and
be
ready
to
come
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
leaving
their
*NL*
own
crop
to
destruction
by
the
threatened
storm
;
they
had
to
let
*NL*
him
plant
fruit
trees
in
their
fields
,
and
then
keep
their
indignation
*NL*
to
themselves
when
his
heedless
fruit-gatherers
trampled
the
grain
*NL*
around
the
trees
;
they
had
to
smother
their
anger
when
his
hunting
*NL*
parties
galloped
through
their
fields
laying
waste
the
result
of
*NL*
their
patient
toil
;
they
were
not
allowed
to
keep
doves
themselves
,
*NL*
and
when
the
swarms
from
my
lord
's
dovecote
settled
on
their
crops
*NL*
they
must
not
lose
their
temper
and
kill
a
bird
,
for
awful
would
*NL*
the
penalty
be
;
when
the
harvest
was
at
last
gathered
,
then
came
*NL*
the
procession
of
robbers
to
levy
their
blackmail
upon
it
:
first
*NL*
the
Church
carted
off
its
fat
tenth
,
then
the
king
's
commissioner
*NL*
took
his
twentieth
,
then
my
lord
's
people
made
a
mighty
inroad
*NL*
upon
the
remainder
;
after
which
,
the
skinned
freeman
had
liberty
*NL*
to
bestow
the
remnant
in
his
barn
,
in
case
it
was
worth
the
trouble
;
*NL*
there
were
taxes
,
and
taxes
,
and
taxes
,
and
more
taxes
,
and
taxes
*NL*
again
,
and
yet
other
taxes
--
upon
this
free
and
independent
pauper
,
*NL*
but
none
upon
his
lord
the
baron
or
the
bishop
,
none
upon
the
*NL*
wasteful
nobility
or
the
all-devouring
Church
;
if
the
baron
would
*NL*
sleep
unvexed
,
the
freeman
must
sit
up
all
night
after
his
day
's
*NL*
work
and
whip
the
ponds
to
keep
the
frogs
quiet
;
if
the
freeman
's
*NL*
daughter
--
but
no
,
that
last
infamy
of
monarchical
government
is
*NL*
unprintable
;
and
finally
,
if
the
freeman
,
grown
desperate
with
his
*NL*
tortures
,
found
his
life
unendurable
under
such
conditions
,
and
*NL*
sacrificed
it
and
fled
to
death
for
mercy
and
refuge
,
the
gentle
*NL*
Church
condemned
him
to
eternal
fire
,
the
gentle
law
buried
him
*NL*
at
midnight
at
the
cross-roads
with
a
stake
through
his
back
,
*NL*
and
his
master
the
baron
or
the
bishop
confiscated
all
his
property
*NL*
and
turned
his
widow
and
his
orphans
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
were
these
freemen
assembled
in
the
early
morning
to
work
*NL*
on
their
lord
the
bishop
's
road
three
days
each
--
gratis
;
every
*NL*
head
of
a
family
,
and
every
son
of
a
family
,
three
days
each
,
*NL*
gratis
,
and
a
day
or
so
added
for
their
servants
.
Why
,
it
was
*NL*
like
reading
about
France
and
the
French
,
before
the
ever
memorable
*NL*
and
blessed
Revolution
,
which
swept
a
thousand
years
of
such
*NL*
villany
away
in
one
swift
tidal-wave
of
blood
--
one
:
a
settlement
*NL*
of
that
hoary
debt
in
the
proportion
of
half
a
drop
of
blood
for
*NL*
each
hogshead
of
it
that
had
been
pressed
by
slow
tortures
out
of
*NL*
that
people
in
the
weary
stretch
of
ten
centuries
of
wrong
and
*NL*
shame
and
misery
the
like
of
which
was
not
to
be
mated
but
in
hell
.
*NL*
There
were
two
``
Reigns
of
Terror
,
''
if
we
would
but
remember
it
*NL*
and
consider
it
;
the
one
wrought
murder
in
hot
passion
,
the
other
*NL*
in
heartless
cold
blood
;
the
one
lasted
mere
months
,
the
other
had
*NL*
lasted
a
thousand
years
;
the
one
inflicted
death
upon
ten
thousand
*NL*
persons
,
the
other
upon
a
hundred
millions
;
but
our
shudders
are
*NL*
all
for
the
``
horrors
''
of
the
minor
Terror
,
the
momentary
Terror
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
;
whereas
,
what
is
the
horror
of
swift
death
by
the
axe
,
*NL*
compared
with
lifelong
death
from
hunger
,
cold
,
insult
,
cruelty
,
*NL*
and
heart-break
?
What
is
swift
death
by
lightning
compared
with
*NL*
death
by
slow
fire
at
the
stake
?
A
city
cemetery
could
contain
the
*NL*
coffins
filled
by
that
brief
Terror
which
we
have
all
been
so
*NL*
diligently
taught
to
shiver
at
and
mourn
over
;
but
all
France
could
*NL*
hardly
contain
the
coffins
filled
by
that
older
and
real
Terror
*NL*
--
that
unspeakably
bitter
and
awful
Terror
which
none
of
us
has
*NL*
been
taught
to
see
in
its
vastness
or
pity
as
it
deserves
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
poor
ostensible
freemen
who
were
sharing
their
breakfast
*NL*
and
their
talk
with
me
,
were
as
full
of
humble
reverence
for
their
*NL*
king
and
Church
and
nobility
as
their
worst
enemy
could
desire
.
*NL*
There
was
something
pitifully
ludicrous
about
it
.
I
asked
them
*NL*
if
they
supposed
a
nation
of
people
ever
existed
,
who
,
with
a
free
*NL*
vote
in
every
man
's
hand
,
would
elect
that
a
single
family
and
its
*NL*
descendants
should
reign
over
it
forever
,
whether
gifted
or
boobies
,
*NL*
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
families
--
including
the
voter
's
;
and
*NL*
would
also
elect
that
a
certain
hundred
families
should
be
raised
*NL*
to
dizzy
summits
of
rank
,
and
clothed
on
with
offensive
transmissible
*NL*
glories
and
privileges
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
the
nation
's
*NL*
families
--
_
including
his
own
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
looked
unhit
,
and
said
they
did
n't
know
;
that
they
had
*NL*
never
thought
about
it
before
,
and
it
had
n't
ever
occurred
to
them
*NL*
that
a
nation
could
be
so
situated
that
every
man
_
could
_
have
*NL*
a
say
in
the
government
.
I
said
I
had
seen
one
--
and
that
it
would
*NL*
last
until
it
had
an
Established
Church
.
Again
they
were
all
*NL*
unhit
--
at
first
.
But
presently
one
man
looked
up
and
asked
me
*NL*
to
state
that
proposition
again
;
and
state
it
slowly
,
so
it
could
*NL*
soak
into
his
understanding
.
I
did
it
;
and
after
a
little
he
had
*NL*
the
idea
,
and
he
brought
his
fist
down
and
said
_
he
_
did
n't
believe
*NL*
a
nation
where
every
man
had
a
vote
would
voluntarily
get
down
*NL*
in
the
mud
and
dirt
in
any
such
way
;
and
that
to
steal
from
a
nation
*NL*
its
will
and
preference
must
be
a
crime
and
the
first
of
all
crimes
.
*NL*
I
said
to
myself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
one
's
a
man
.
If
I
were
backed
by
enough
of
his
sort
,
I
would
*NL*
make
a
strike
for
the
welfare
of
this
country
,
and
try
to
prove
*NL*
myself
its
loyalest
citizen
by
making
a
wholesome
change
in
its
*NL*
system
of
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
my
kind
of
loyalty
was
loyalty
to
one
's
country
,
not
to
*NL*
its
institutions
or
its
office-holders
.
The
country
is
the
real
*NL*
thing
,
the
substantial
thing
,
the
eternal
thing
;
it
is
the
thing
*NL*
to
watch
over
,
and
care
for
,
and
be
loyal
to
;
institutions
are
*NL*
extraneous
,
they
are
its
mere
clothing
,
and
clothing
can
wear
out
,
*NL*
become
ragged
,
cease
to
be
comfortable
,
cease
to
protect
the
body
*NL*
from
winter
,
disease
,
and
death
.
To
be
loyal
to
rags
,
to
shout
*NL*
for
rags
,
to
worship
rags
,
to
die
for
rags
--
that
is
a
loyalty
*NL*
of
unreason
,
it
is
pure
animal
;
it
belongs
to
monarchy
,
was
invented
*NL*
by
monarchy
;
let
monarchy
keep
it
.
I
was
from
Connecticut
,
whose
*NL*
Constitution
declares
``
that
all
political
power
is
inherent
in
*NL*
the
people
,
and
all
free
governments
are
founded
on
their
authority
*NL*
and
instituted
for
their
benefit
;
and
that
they
have
_
at
all
times
_
*NL*
an
undeniable
and
indefeasible
right
to
_
alter
their
form
of
*NL*
government
_
in
such
a
manner
as
they
may
think
expedient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
that
gospel
,
the
citizen
who
thinks
he
sees
that
the
*NL*
commonwealth
's
political
clothes
are
worn
out
,
and
yet
holds
his
*NL*
peace
and
does
not
agitate
for
a
new
suit
,
is
disloyal
;
he
is
*NL*
a
traitor
.
That
he
may
be
the
only
one
who
thinks
he
sees
this
*NL*
decay
,
does
not
excuse
him
;
it
is
his
duty
to
agitate
anyway
,
and
*NL*
it
is
the
duty
of
the
others
to
vote
him
down
if
they
do
not
see
*NL*
the
matter
as
he
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
here
I
was
,
in
a
country
where
a
right
to
say
how
the
*NL*
country
should
be
governed
was
restricted
to
six
persons
in
each
*NL*
thousand
of
its
population
.
For
the
nine
hundred
and
ninety-four
*NL*
to
express
dissatisfaction
with
the
regnant
system
and
propose
*NL*
to
change
it
,
would
have
made
the
whole
six
shudder
as
one
man
,
*NL*
it
would
have
been
so
disloyal
,
so
dishonorable
,
such
putrid
black
*NL*
treason
.
So
to
speak
,
I
was
become
a
stockholder
in
a
corporation
*NL*
where
nine
hundred
and
ninety-four
of
the
members
furnished
all
*NL*
the
money
and
did
all
the
work
,
and
the
other
six
elected
themselves
*NL*
a
permanent
board
of
direction
and
took
all
the
dividends
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
me
that
what
the
nine
hundred
and
ninety-four
dupes
needed
was
*NL*
a
new
deal
.
The
thing
that
would
have
best
suited
the
circus
side
*NL*
of
my
nature
would
have
been
to
resign
the
Boss-ship
and
get
up
*NL*
an
insurrection
and
turn
it
into
a
revolution
;
but
I
knew
that
the
*NL*
Jack
Cade
or
the
Wat
Tyler
who
tries
such
a
thing
without
first
*NL*
educating
his
materials
up
to
revolution
grade
is
almost
absolutely
*NL*
certain
to
get
left
.
I
had
never
been
accustomed
to
getting
left
,
*NL*
even
if
I
do
say
it
myself
.
Wherefore
,
the
``
deal
''
which
had
been
*NL*
for
some
time
working
into
shape
in
my
mind
was
of
a
quite
different
*NL*
pattern
from
the
Cade-Tyler
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
did
not
talk
blood
and
insurrection
to
that
man
there
who
sat
*NL*
munching
black
bread
with
that
abused
and
mistaught
herd
of
human
*NL*
sheep
,
but
took
him
aside
and
talked
matter
of
another
sort
to
him
.
*NL*
After
I
had
finished
,
I
got
him
to
lend
me
a
little
ink
from
his
*NL*
veins
;
and
with
this
and
a
sliver
I
wrote
on
a
piece
of
bark
--
*NL*
*NL*
Put
him
in
the
Man-factory
--
*NL*
*NL*
and
gave
it
to
him
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
to
the
palace
at
Camelot
and
give
it
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
Amyas
le
Poulet
,
whom
I
call
Clarence
,
and
he
will
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
priest
,
then
,
''
said
the
man
,
and
some
of
the
enthusiasm
*NL*
went
out
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
a
priest
?
Did
n't
I
tell
you
that
no
chattel
of
the
Church
,
*NL*
no
bond-slave
of
pope
or
bishop
can
enter
my
Man-Factory
?
Did
n't
*NL*
I
tell
you
that
_
you
_
could
n't
enter
unless
your
religion
,
whatever
*NL*
it
might
be
,
was
your
own
free
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
it
is
so
,
and
for
that
I
was
glad
;
wherefore
it
liked
me
not
,
*NL*
and
bred
in
me
a
cold
doubt
,
to
hear
of
this
priest
being
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
is
n't
a
priest
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
far
from
satisfied
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
a
priest
,
and
yet
can
read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
a
priest
and
yet
can
read
--
yes
,
and
write
,
too
,
for
that
*NL*
matter
.
I
taught
him
myself
.
''
The
man
's
face
cleared
.
``
And
it
is
*NL*
the
first
thing
that
you
yourself
will
be
taught
in
that
Factory
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
would
give
blood
out
of
my

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEFEND
THEE
,
LORD
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
paid
three
pennies
for
my
breakfast
,
and
a
most
extravagant
*NL*
price
it
was
,
too
,
seeing
that
one
could
have
breakfasted
a
dozen
*NL*
persons
for
that
money
;
but
I
was
feeling
good
by
this
time
,
and
*NL*
I
had
always
been
a
kind
of
spendthrift
anyway
;
and
then
these
*NL*
people
had
wanted
to
give
me
the
food
for
nothing
,
scant
as
*NL*
their
provision
was
,
and
so
it
was
a
grateful
pleasure
to
emphasize
*NL*
my
appreciation
and
sincere
thankfulness
with
a
good
big
financial
*NL*
lift
where
the
money
would
do
so
much
more
good
than
it
would
*NL*
in
my
helmet
,
where
,
these
pennies
being
made
of
iron
and
not
*NL*
stinted
in
weight
,
my
half-dollar
's
worth
was
a
good
deal
of
a
*NL*
burden
to
me
.
I
spent
money
rather
too
freely
in
those
days
,
*NL*
it
is
true
;
but
one
reason
for
it
was
that
I
had
n't
got
the
*NL*
proportions
of
things
entirely
adjusted
,
even
yet
,
after
so
long
*NL*
a
sojourn
in
Britain
--
had
n't
got
along
to
where
I
was
able
to
*NL*
absolutely
realize
that
a
penny
in
Arthur
's
land
and
a
couple
of
*NL*
dollars
in
Connecticut
were
about
one
and
the
same
thing
:
just
*NL*
twins
,
as
you
may
say
,
in
purchasing
power
.
If
my
start
from
*NL*
Camelot
could
have
been
delayed
a
very
few
days
I
could
have
paid
*NL*
these
people
in
beautiful
new
coins
from
our
own
mint
,
and
that
*NL*
would
have
pleased
me
;
and
them
,
too
,
not
less
.
I
had
adopted
*NL*
the
American
values
exclusively
.
In
a
week
or
two
now
,
cents
,
*NL*
nickels
,
dimes
,
quarters
,
and
half-dollars
,
and
also
a
trifle
of
*NL*
gold
,
would
be
trickling
in
thin
but
steady
streams
all
through
*NL*
the
commercial
veins
of
the
kingdom
,
and
I
looked
to
see
this
*NL*
new
blood
freshen
up
its
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmers
were
bound
to
throw
in
something
,
to
sort
of
offset
*NL*
my
liberality
,
whether
I
would
or
no
;
so
I
let
them
give
me
a
flint
*NL*
and
steel
;
and
as
soon
as
they
had
comfortably
bestowed
Sandy
*NL*
and
me
on
our
horse
,
I
lit
my
pipe
.
When
the
first
blast
of
smoke
*NL*
shot
out
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
,
all
those
people
broke
*NL*
for
the
woods
,
and
Sandy
went
over
backwards
and
struck
the
ground
*NL*
with
a
dull
thud
.
They
thought
I
was
one
of
those
fire-belching
*NL*
dragons
they
had
heard
so
much
about
from
knights
and
other
*NL*
professional
liars
.
I
had
infinite
trouble
to
persuade
those
people
*NL*
to
venture
back
within
explaining
distance
.
Then
I
told
them
that
*NL*
this
was
only
a
bit
of
enchantment
which
would
work
harm
to
none
*NL*
but
my
enemies
.
And
I
promised
,
with
my
hand
on
my
heart
,
that
*NL*
if
all
who
felt
no
enmity
toward
me
would
come
forward
and
pass
*NL*
before
me
they
should
see
that
only
those
who
remained
behind
would
*NL*
be
struck
dead
.
The
procession
moved
with
a
good
deal
of
promptness
.
*NL*
There
were
no
casualties
to
report
,
for
nobody
had
curiosity
enough
*NL*
to
remain
behind
to
see
what
would
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lost
some
time
,
now
,
for
these
big
children
,
their
fears
gone
,
*NL*
became
so
ravished
with
wonder
over
my
awe-compelling
fireworks
*NL*
that
I
had
to
stay
there
and
smoke
a
couple
of
pipes
out
before
*NL*
they
would
let
me
go
.
Still
the
delay
was
not
wholly
unproductive
,
*NL*
for
it
took
all
that
time
to
get
Sandy
thoroughly
wonted
to
the
new
*NL*
thing
,
she
being
so
close
to
it
,
you
know
.
It
plugged
up
her
*NL*
conversation
mill
,
too
,
for
a
considerable
while
,
and
that
was
*NL*
a
gain
.
But
above
all
other
benefits
accruing
,
I
had
learned
*NL*
something
.
I
was
ready
for
any
giant
or
any
ogre
that
might
come
*NL*
along
,
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
tarried
with
a
holy
hermit
,
that
night
,
and
my
opportunity
*NL*
came
about
the
middle
of
the
next
afternoon
.
We
were
crossing
*NL*
a
vast
meadow
by
way
of
short-cut
,
and
I
was
musing
absently
,
*NL*
hearing
nothing
,
seeing
nothing
,
when
Sandy
suddenly
interrupted
*NL*
a
remark
which
she
had
begun
that
morning
,
with
the
cry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Defend
thee
,
lord
!
--
peril
of
life
is
toward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
slipped
down
from
the
horse
and
ran
a
little
way
and
stood
.
*NL*
I
looked
up
and
saw
,
far
off
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
half
a
dozen
*NL*
armed
knights
and
their
squires
;
and
straightway
there
was
bustle
*NL*
among
them
and
tightening
of
saddle-girths
for
the
mount
.
My
pipe
*NL*
was
ready
and
would
have
been
lit
,
if
I
had
not
been
lost
in
*NL*
thinking
about
how
to
banish
oppression
from
this
land
and
restore
*NL*
to
all
its
people
their
stolen
rights
and
manhood
without
disobliging
*NL*
anybody
.
I
lit
up
at
once
,
and
by
the
time
I
had
got
a
good
head
*NL*
of
reserved
steam
on
,
here
they
came
.
All
together
,
too
;
none
of
*NL*
those
chivalrous
magnanimities
which
one
reads
so
much
about
*NL*
--
one
courtly
rascal
at
a
time
,
and
the
rest
standing
by
to
see
fair
*NL*
play
.
No
,
they
came
in
a
body
,
they
came
with
a
whirr
and
a
rush
,
*NL*
they
came
like
a
volley
from
a
battery
;
came
with
heads
low
down
,
*NL*
plumes
streaming
out
behind
,
lances
advanced
at
a
level
.
It
was
*NL*
a
handsome
sight
,
a
beautiful
sight
--
for
a
man
up
a
tree
.
I
laid
*NL*
my
lance
in
rest
and
waited
,
with
my
heart
beating
,
till
the
iron
*NL*
wave
was
just
ready
to
break
over
me
,
then
spouted
a
column
of
*NL*
white
smoke
through
the
bars
of
my
helmet
.
You
should
have
seen
*NL*
the
wave
go
to
pieces
and
scatter
!
This
was
a
finer
sight
than
*NL*
the
other
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
people
stopped
,
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
,
and
*NL*
this
troubled
me
.
My
satisfaction
collapsed
,
and
fear
came
;
*NL*
I
judged
I
was
a
lost
man
.
But
Sandy
was
radiant
;
and
was
going
*NL*
to
be
eloquent
--
but
I
stopped
her
,
and
told
her
my
magic
had
*NL*
miscarried
,
somehow
or
other
,
and
she
must
mount
,
with
all
despatch
,
*NL*
and
we
must
ride
for
life
.
No
,
she
would
n't
.
She
said
that
my
*NL*
enchantment
had
disabled
those
knights
;
they
were
not
riding
on
,
*NL*
because
they
could
n't
;
wait
,
they
would
drop
out
of
their
saddles
*NL*
presently
,
and
we
would
get
their
horses
and
harness
.
I
could
not
*NL*
deceive
such
trusting
simplicity
,
so
I
said
it
was
a
mistake
;
that
*NL*
when
my
fireworks
killed
at
all
,
they
killed
instantly
;
no
,
the
men
*NL*
would
not
die
,
there
was
something
wrong
about
my
apparatus
,
*NL*
I
could
n't
tell
what
;
but
we
must
hurry
and
get
away
,
for
those
*NL*
people
would
attack
us
again
,
in
a
minute
.
Sandy
laughed
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lack-a-day
,
sir
,
they
be
not
of
that
breed
!
Sir
Launcelot
will
*NL*
give
battle
to
dragons
,
and
will
abide
by
them
,
and
will
assail
*NL*
them
again
,
and
yet
again
,
and
still
again
,
until
he
do
conquer
*NL*
and
destroy
them
;
and
so
likewise
will
Sir
Pellinore
and
Sir
Aglovale
*NL*
and
Sir
Carados
,
and
mayhap
others
,
but
there
be
none
else
that
*NL*
will
venture
it
,
let
the
idle
say
what
the
idle
will
.
And
,
la
,
*NL*
as
to
yonder
base
rufflers
,
think
ye
they
have
not
their
fill
,
*NL*
but
yet
desire
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
are
they
waiting
for
?
Why
do
n't
they
leave
?
*NL*
Nobody
's
hindering
.
Good
land
,
I
'm
willing
to
let
bygones
be
*NL*
bygones
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
,
is
it
?
Oh
,
give
thyself
easement
as
to
that
.
They
dream
*NL*
not
of
it
,
no
,
not
they
.
They
wait
to
yield
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
--
really
,
is
that
`
sooth
'
--
as
you
people
say
?
If
they
want
to
,
*NL*
why
do
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
like
them
much
;
but
an
ye
wot
how
dragons
are
esteemed
,
*NL*
ye
would
not
hold
them
blamable
.
They
fear
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
suppose
I
go
to
them
instead
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
wit
ye
well
they
would
not
abide
your
coming
.
I
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
did
.
She
was
a
handy
person
to
have
along
on
a
raid
.
*NL*
I
would
have
considered
this
a
doubtful
errand
,
myself
.
I
presently
*NL*
saw
the
knights
riding
away
,
and
Sandy
coming
back
.
That
was
*NL*
a
relief
.
I
judged
she
had
somehow
failed
to
get
the
first
innings
*NL*
--
I
mean
in
the
conversation
;
otherwise
the
interview
would
n't
have
*NL*
been
so
short
.
But
it
turned
out
that
she
had
managed
the
business
*NL*
well
;
in
fact
,
admirably
.
She
said
that
when
she
told
those
people
*NL*
I
was
The
Boss
,
it
hit
them
where
they
lived
:
``
smote
them
sore
*NL*
with
fear
and
dread
''
was
her
word
;
and
then
they
were
ready
to
*NL*
put
up
with
anything
she
might
require
.
So
she
swore
them
to
appear
*NL*
at
Arthur
's
court
within
two
days
and
yield
them
,
with
horse
and
*NL*
harness
,
and
be
my
knights
henceforth
,
and
subject
to
my
command
.
*NL*
How
much
better
she
managed
that
thing
than
I
should
have
done
*NL*
it
myself
!
She
was
a
daisy
.

*NL*
SANDY
'S
TALE
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
I
'm
proprietor
of
some
knights
,
''
said
I
,
as
we
rode
off
.
*NL*
``
Who
would
ever
have
supposed
that
I
should
live
to
list
up
assets
*NL*
of
that
sort
.
I
sha
n't
know
what
to
do
with
them
;
unless
I
raffle
*NL*
them
off
.
How
many
of
them
are
there
,
Sandy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
,
please
you
,
sir
,
and
their
squires

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
good
haul
.
Who
are
they
?
Where
do
they
hang
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
they
hang
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
where
do
they
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
understood
thee
not
.
That
will
I
tell
eftsoons

''
Then
she
*NL*
said
musingly
,
and
softly
,
turning
the
words
daintily
over
her
*NL*
tongue
:
``
Hang
they
out

hang

out

where
hang
--
where
do
they
*NL*
hang
out

eh
,
right
so
;
where
do
they
hang
out

Of
a
truth
the
*NL*
phrase
hath
a
fair
and
winsome
grace
,
and
is
prettily
worded
*NL*
withal
.
I
will
repeat
it
anon
and
anon
in
mine
idlesse
,
whereby
*NL*
I
may
peradventure
learn
it
.
Where

Even
so

*NL*

Do

*NL*
``
Cowboys

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

knights

know

You

about

while
back

remember

speaking

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

yes

Go
to

to
work
on
your
*NL*
statistics

and
do
n't
burn
so
much
kindling
getting

fire

about

knights

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
well
,
and
lightly
will
begin

So
they
two
departed
and
*NL*
rode
into
a
great
forest

And
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
Scott
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
I
recognized
my
mistake
at
once
.
I
had
set
her
works
*NL*
a-going
;
it
was
my
own
fault
;
she
would
be
thirty
days
getting
down
*NL*
to
those
facts
.
And
she
generally
began
without
a
preface
and
*NL*
finished
without
a
result
.
If
you
interrupted
her
she
would
either
*NL*
go
right
along
without
noticing
,
or
answer
with
a
couple
of
words
,
*NL*
and
go
back
and
say
the
sentence
over
again
.
So
,
interruptions
*NL*
only
did
harm
;
and
yet
I
had
to
interrupt
,
and
interrupt
pretty
*NL*
frequently
,
too
,
in
order
to
save
my
life
;
a
person
would
die
if
*NL*
he
let
her
monotony
drip
on
him
right
along
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
Scott
!
''
I
said
in
my
distress
.
She
went
right
back
and
*NL*
began
over
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
two
departed
and
rode
into
a
great
forest

And

*NL*

''
_
Which
_
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Gawaine
and
Sir
Uwaine

And
so
they
came
to
an
abbey
of
monks
,
*NL*
and
there
were
well
lodged
.
So
on
the
morn
they
heard
their
masses
*NL*
in
the
abbey
,
and
so
they
rode
forth
till
they
came
to
a
great
*NL*
forest
;
then
was
Sir
Gawaine
ware
in
a
valley
by
a
turret
,
of
*NL*
twelve
fair
damsels
,
and
two
knights
armed
on
great
horses
,
and
*NL*
the
damsels
went
to
and
fro
by
a
tree
.
And
then
was
Sir
Gawaine
*NL*
ware
how
there
hung
a
white
shield
on
that
tree
,
and
ever
as
the
*NL*
damsels
came
by
it
they
spit
upon
it

some
threw
mire
upon

the
shield

*NL*
``
Now

But
I

parading
before

shield

There
is
a

it
beseemeth
evil

And
look
out

hold
on
tight

There

all
right
now

This
horse

born
before

On

If
you
've
got
a
fault
in

world

Sandy

it
is
that
*NL*
you
are
a
shade
too
archaic

But
it
is
n't
any
matter

''
*NL*
*NL*
''

for
I
saw
him
once
proved
at
a
justs
where
many
knights
were
*NL*
gathered
,
and
that
time
there
might
no
man
withstand
him
.
Ah
,
said
*NL*
Sir
Gawaine
,
damsels
,
methinketh
ye
are
to
blame
,
for
it
is
to
*NL*
suppose
he
that
hung
that
shield
there
will
not
be
long
therefrom
,
*NL*
and
then
may
those
knights
match
him
on
horseback
,
and
that
is
*NL*
more
your
worship
than
thus
;
for
I
will
abide
no
longer
to
see
*NL*
a
knight
's
shield
dishonored
.
And
therewith
Sir
Uwaine
and
*NL*
Sir
Gawaine
departed
a
little
from
them
,
and
then
were
they
ware
*NL*
where
Sir
Marhaus
came
riding
on
a
great
horse
straight
toward
*NL*
them
.
And
when
the
twelve
damsels
saw
Sir
Marhaus
they
fled
into
*NL*
the
turret
as
they
were
wild
,
so
that
some
of
them
fell
by
the
way
.
*NL*
Then
the
one
of
the
knights
of
the
tower
dressed
his
shield
,
and
*NL*
said
on
high
,
Sir
Marhaus
defend
thee
.
And
so
they
ran
together
*NL*
that
the
knight
brake
his
spear
on
Marhaus
,
and
Sir
Marhaus
smote
*NL*
him
so
hard
that
he
brake
his
neck
and
the
horse
's
back
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
just
the
trouble
about
this
state
of
things
,
*NL*
it
ruins
so
many
horses

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
saw
the
other
knight
of
the
turret
,
and
dressed
him
toward
*NL*
Marhaus
,
and
they
went
so
eagerly
together
,
that
the
knight
of
*NL*
the
turret
was
soon
smitten
down

horse

man

stark
dead

I
judged

The
truth
is

Alisande

these
archaics

a

the

is
too
limited

suffer
in

they
run
too
much

not
enough

this
throws
about

them
a

all

alike

a

random
is
a
good

so
is
exegesis

for
that

so
is
holocaust

defalcation

usufruct

a

a
body
ought
to

they
come
together
with
*NL*
great
random

a
spear
is
brast
,
and
one
party
brake
his
shield
*NL*

the
other
one
goes
down

horse

man

over
his
horse-tail

then
the
next
candidate

lightly
Sir

so
,
Sir
Knight

said
Sir

I
have
well
felt

ye

good
knight

a
marvelous

as
ever

felt

not

therefore
it
were
a

do

I
feel

are
passing
*NL*
feeble

Ah
,
said
Sir
Gawaine
,
gentle
knight
,
ye
say
the
word
*NL*
that
I
should
say
.
And
therewith
they
took
off
their
helms
and
*NL*
either
kissed
other
,
and
there
they
swore
together
either
to
love
*NL*
other
as
brethren
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
lost
the
thread
there
,
and
dozed
off
to
slumber
,
thinking
*NL*
about
what
a
pity
it
was
that
men
with
such
superb
strength
*NL*
--
strength
enabling
them
to
stand
up
cased
in
cruelly
burdensome
*NL*
iron
and
drenched
with
perspiration
,
and
hack
and
batter
and
bang
*NL*
each
other
for
six
hours
on
a
stretch
--
should
not
have
been
born
*NL*
at
a
time
when
they
could
put
it
to
some
useful
purpose
.
Take
*NL*
a
jackass
,
for
instance
:
a
jackass
has
that
kind
of
strength
,
and
*NL*
puts
it
to
a
useful
purpose
,
and
is
valuable
to
this
world
because
*NL*
he
is
a
jackass
;
but
a
nobleman
is
not
valuable
because
he
is
*NL*
a
jackass
.
It
is
a
mixture
that
is
always
ineffectual
,
and
should
*NL*
never
have
been
attempted
in
the
first
place
.
And
yet
,
once
you
*NL*
start
a
mistake
,
the
trouble
is
done
and
you
never
know
what
is
*NL*
going
to
come
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
to
myself
again
and
began
to
listen
,
I
perceived
that
*NL*
I
had
lost
another
chapter
,
and
that
Alisande
had
wandered
a
long
*NL*
way
off
with
her
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
they
rode
and
came
into
a
deep
valley
full
of
stones
,
*NL*
and
thereby
they
saw
a
fair
stream
of
water
;
above
thereby
was
*NL*
the
head
of
the
stream
,
a
fair
fountain
,
and
three
damsels
sitting
*NL*
thereby
.
In
this
country
,
said
Sir
Marhaus
,
came
never
knight
*NL*
since
it
was
christened
,
but
he
found
strange
adventures

king

Ireland

all
the
rest

you
ought
to
give
him
a
brogue

*NL*

at
least
a
characteristic
expletive
;
by
this
means
one
would

recognize

then

rode

either
saluted

the

a

her
age

gentle

lovely

all
the
world
to
me

and
whom
*NL*
I
shall
never
see
again

How
the
thought
of
her
carries
me
back
*NL*
over
wide
seas
of
memory
to
a
vague
dim
time
,
a
happy
time
,
so
many
,
*NL*
many
centuries
hence
,
when
I
used
to
wake
in
the
soft
summer
*NL*
mornings
,
out
of
sweet
dreams
of
her
,
and
say
``
Hello
,
Central
!
''
*NL*
just
to
hear
her
dear
voice
come
melting
back
to
me
with
a
*NL*
``
Hello

Hank
!
''
that
was
music
of
the
spheres
to
my
enchanted
ear
.
*NL*
She
got
three
dollars
a
week
,
but
she
was
worth
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
follow
Alisande
's
further
explanation
of
who
our
*NL*
captured
knights
were
,
now
--
I
mean
in
case
she
should
ever
get
*NL*
to
explaining
who
they
were
.
My
interest
was
gone
,
my
thoughts
*NL*
were
far
away
,
and
sad
.
By
fitful
glimpses
of
the
drifting
tale
,
*NL*
caught
here
and
there
and
now
and
then
,
I
merely
noted
in
a
vague
*NL*
way
that
each
of
these
three
knights
took
one
of
these
three
damsels
*NL*
up
behind
him
on
his
horse
,
and
one
rode
north
,
another
east
,
*NL*
the
other
south
,
to
seek
adventures
,
and
meet
again
and
lie
,
after
*NL*
year
and
day
.
Year
and
day
--
and
without
baggage
.
It
was
of
*NL*
a
piece
with
the
general
simplicity
of
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
now
setting
.
It
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
when
*NL*
Alisande
had
begun
to
tell
me
who
the
cowboys
were
;
so
she
had
made
*NL*
pretty
good
progress
with
it
--
for
her
.
She
would
arrive
some
time
*NL*
or
other
,
no
doubt
,
but
she
was
not
a
person
who
could
be
hurried
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
approaching
a
castle
which
stood
on
high
ground
;
a
huge
,
*NL*
strong
,
venerable
structure
,
whose
gray
towers
and
battlements
were
*NL*
charmingly
draped
with
ivy
,
and
whose
whole
majestic
mass
was
*NL*
drenched
with
splendors
flung
from
the
sinking
sun
.
It
was
the
*NL*
largest
castle
we
had
seen
,
and
so
I
thought
it
might
be
the
one
*NL*
we
were
after
,
but
Sandy
said
no
.
She
did
not
know
who
owned
it
;
*NL*
she
said
she
had
passed
it
without
calling
,
when
she
went
down
*NL*
to
Camelot
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
MORGAN
LE
FAY
*NL*
*NL*
If
knights
errant
were
to
be
believed
,
not
all
castles
were
desirable
*NL*
places
to
seek
hospitality
in
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
knights
errant
*NL*
were
_
not
_
persons
to
be
believed
--
that
is
,
measured
by
modern
*NL*
standards
of
veracity
;
yet
,
measured
by
the
standards
of
their
own
*NL*
time
,
and
scaled
accordingly
,
you
got
the
truth
.
It
was
very
*NL*
simple
:
you
discounted
a
statement
ninety-seven
per
cent
;
the
rest
*NL*
was
fact
.
Now
after
making
this
allowance
,
the
truth
remained
*NL*
that
if
I
could
find
out
something
about
a
castle
before
ringing
*NL*
the
door-bell
--
I
mean
hailing
the
warders
--
it
was
the
sensible
*NL*
thing
to
do
.
So
I
was
pleased
when
I
saw
in
the
distance
a
horseman
*NL*
making
the
bottom
turn
of
the
road
that
wound
down
from
this
castle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
approached
each
other
,
I
saw
that
he
wore
a
plumed
helmet
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
be
otherwise
clothed
in
steel
,
but
bore
a
curious
*NL*
addition
also
--
a
stiff
square
garment
like
a
herald
's
tabard
.
*NL*
However
,
I
had
to
smile
at
my
own
forgetfulness
when
I
got
nearer
*NL*
and
read
this
sign
on
his
tabard
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Persimmon
's
Soap
--
All
the
Prime-Donna
Use
It
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
little
idea
of
my
own
,
and
had
several
wholesome
purposes
*NL*
in
view
toward
the
civilizing
and
uplifting
of
this
nation
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
it
was
a
furtive
,
underhand
blow
at
this
nonsense
*NL*
of
knight
errantry
,
though
nobody
suspected
that
but
me
.
I
had
*NL*
started
a
number
of
these
people
out
--
the
bravest
knights
I
could
*NL*
get
--
each
sandwiched
between
bulletin-boards
bearing
one
device
*NL*
or
another
,
and
I
judged
that
by
and
by
when
they
got
to
be
numerous
*NL*
enough
they
would
begin
to
look
ridiculous
;
and
then
,
even
the
*NL*
steel-clad
ass
that
_
had
n't
_
any
board
would
himself
begin
to
look
*NL*
ridiculous
because
he
was
out
of
the
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
these
missionaries
would
gradually
,
and
without
creating
*NL*
suspicion
or
exciting
alarm
,
introduce
a
rudimentary
cleanliness
*NL*
among
the
nobility
,
and
from
them
it
would
work
down
to
the
people
,
*NL*
if
the
priests
could
be
kept
quiet
.
This
would
undermine
the
Church
.
*NL*
I
mean
would
be
a
step
toward
that
.
Next
,
education
--
next
,
freedom
*NL*
--
and
then
she
would
begin
to
crumble
.
It
being
my
conviction
that
*NL*
any
Established
Church
is
an
established
crime
,
an
established
*NL*
slave-pen
,
I
had
no
scruples
,
but
was
willing
to
assail
it
in
*NL*
any
way
or
with
any
weapon
that
promised
to
hurt
it
.
Why
,
in
my
*NL*
own
former
day
--
in
remote
centuries
not
yet
stirring
in
the
womb
*NL*
of
time
--
there
were
old
Englishmen
who
imagined
that
they
had
been
*NL*
born
in
a
free
country
:
a
``
free
''
country
with
the
Corporation
Act
*NL*
and
the
Test
still
in
force
in
it
--
timbers
propped
against
men
's
*NL*
liberties
and
dishonored
consciences
to
shore
up
an
Established
*NL*
Anachronism
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
missionaries
were
taught
to
spell
out
the
gilt
signs
on
their
*NL*
tabards
--
the
showy
gilding
was
a
neat
idea
,
I
could
have
got
the
*NL*
king
to
wear
a
bulletin-board
for
the
sake
of
that
barbaric
*NL*
splendor
--
they
were
to
spell
out
these
signs
and
then
explain
to
*NL*
the
lords
and
ladies
what
soap
was
;
and
if
the
lords
and
ladies
*NL*
were
afraid
of
it
,
get
them
to
try
it
on
a
dog
.
The
missionary
's
*NL*
next
move
was
to
get
the
family
together
and
try
it
on
himself
;
*NL*
he
was
to
stop
at
no
experiment
,
however
desperate
,
that
could
*NL*
convince
the
nobility
that
soap
was
harmless
;
if
any
final
doubt
*NL*
remained
,
he
must
catch
a
hermit
--
the
woods
were
full
of
them
;
*NL*
saints
they
called
themselves
,
and
saints
they
were
believed
to
be
.
*NL*
They
were
unspeakably
holy
,
and
worked
miracles
,
and
everybody
*NL*
stood
in
awe
of
them
.
If
a
hermit
could
survive
a
wash
,
and
that
*NL*
failed
to
convince
a
duke
,
give
him
up
,
let
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
my
missionaries
overcame
a
knight
errant
on
the
road
*NL*
they
washed
him
,
and
when
he
got
well
they
swore
him
to
go
and
*NL*
get
a
bulletin-board
and
disseminate
soap
and
civilization
the
rest
*NL*
of
his
days
.
As
a
consequence
the
workers
in
the
field
were
*NL*
increasing
by
degrees
,
and
the
reform
was
steadily
spreading
.
*NL*
My
soap
factory
felt
the
strain
early
.
At
first
I
had
only
two
*NL*
hands
;
but
before
I
had
left
home
I
was
already
employing
fifteen
,
*NL*
and
running
night
and
day
;
and
the
atmospheric
result
was
getting
*NL*
so
pronounced
that
the
king
went
sort
of
fainting
and
gasping
*NL*
around
and
said
he
did
not
believe
he
could
stand
it
much
longer
,
*NL*
and
Sir
Launcelot
got
so
that
he
did
hardly
anything
but
walk
up
*NL*
and
down
the
roof
and
swear
,
although
I
told
him
it
was
worse
up
*NL*
there
than
anywhere
else
,
but
he
said
he
wanted
plenty
of
air
;
and
*NL*
he
was
always
complaining
that
a
palace
was
no
place
for
a
soap
*NL*
factory
anyway
,
and
said
if
a
man
was
to
start
one
in
his
house
*NL*
he
would
be
damned
if
he
would
n't
strangle
him
.
There
were
ladies
*NL*
present
,
too
,
but
much
these
people
ever
cared
for
that
;
they
would
*NL*
swear
before
children
,
if
the
wind
was
their
way
when
the
factory
*NL*
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
missionary
knight
's
name
was
La
Cote
Male
Taile
,
and
he
said
*NL*
that
this
castle
was
the
abode
of
Morgan
le
Fay
,
sister
of
*NL*
King
Arthur
,
and
wife
of
King
Uriens
,
monarch
of
a
realm
about
*NL*
as
big
as
the
District
of
Columbia
--
you
could
stand
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
it
and
throw
bricks
into
the
next
kingdom
.
``
Kings
''
and
``
Kingdoms
''
*NL*
were
as
thick
in
Britain
as
they
had
been
in
little
Palestine
in
*NL*
Joshua
's
time
,
when
people
had
to
sleep
with
their
knees
pulled
up
*NL*
because
they
could
n't
stretch
out
without
a
passport
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Cote
was
much
depressed
,
for
he
had
scored
here
the
worst
*NL*
failure
of
his
campaign
.
He
had
not
worked
off
a
cake
;
yet
he
had
*NL*
tried
all
the
tricks
of
the
trade
,
even
to
the
washing
of
a
hermit
;
*NL*
but
the
hermit
died
.
This
was
,
indeed
,
a
bad
failure
,
for
this
*NL*
animal
would
now
be
dubbed
a
martyr
,
and
would
take
his
place
*NL*
among
the
saints
of
the
Roman
calendar
.
Thus
made
he
his
moan
,
*NL*
this
poor
Sir
La
Cote
Male
Taile
,
and
sorrowed
passing
sore
.
And
*NL*
so
my
heart
bled
for
him
,
and
I
was
moved
to
comfort
and
stay
him
.
*NL*
Wherefore
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forbear
to
grieve
,
fair
knight
,
for
this
is
not
a
defeat
.
We
have
*NL*
brains
,
you
and
I
;
and
for
such
as
have
brains
there
are
no
defeats
,
*NL*
but
only
victories
.
Observe
how
we
will
turn
this
seeming
disaster
*NL*
into
an
advertisement
;
an
advertisement
for
our
soap
;
and
the
*NL*
biggest
one
,
to
draw
,
that
was
ever
thought
of
;
an
advertisement
*NL*
that
will
transform
that
Mount
Washington
defeat
into
a
Matterhorn
*NL*
victory
.
We
will
put
on
your
bulletin-board
,
'
_
Patronized
by
the
*NL*
elect
_
.
'
How
does
that
strike
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
it
is
wonderly
bethought
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
body
is
bound
to
admit
that
for
just
a
modest
little
*NL*
one-line
ad
,
it
's
a
corker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
poor
colporteur
's
griefs
vanished
away
.
He
was
a
brave
*NL*
fellow
,
and
had
done
mighty
feats
of
arms
in
his
time
.
His
chief
*NL*
celebrity
rested
upon
the
events
of
an
excursion
like
this
one
*NL*
of
mine
,
which
he
had
once
made
with
a
damsel
named
Maledisant
,
*NL*
who
was
as
handy
with
her
tongue
as
was
Sandy
,
though
in
a
different
*NL*
way
,
for
her
tongue
churned
forth
only
railings
and
insult
,
whereas
*NL*
Sandy
's
music
was
of
a
kindlier
sort
.
I
knew
his
story
well
,
and
so
*NL*
I
knew
how
to
interpret
the
compassion
that
was
in
his
face
when
he
*NL*
bade
me
farewell
.
He
supposed
I
was
having
a
bitter
hard
time
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sandy
and
I
discussed
his
story
,
as
we
rode
along
,
and
she
said
*NL*
that
La
Cote
's
bad
luck
had
begun
with
the
very
beginning
of
that
*NL*
trip
;
for
the
king
's
fool
had
overthrown
him
on
the
first
day
,
*NL*
and
in
such
cases
it
was
customary
for
the
girl
to
desert
to
the
*NL*
conqueror
,
but
Maledisant
did
n't
do
it
;
and
also
persisted
afterward
*NL*
in
sticking
to
him
,
after
all
his
defeats
.
But
,
said
I
,
suppose
*NL*
the
victor
should
decline
to
accept
his
spoil
?
She
said
that
that
*NL*
would
n't
answer
--
he
must
.
He
could
n't
decline
;
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
regular
.
I
made
a
note
of
that
.
If
Sandy
's
music
got
to
be
too
*NL*
burdensome
,
some
time
,
I
would
let
a
knight
defeat
me
,
on
the
chance
*NL*
that
she
would
desert
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
time
we
were
challenged
by
the
warders
,
from
the
castle
*NL*
walls
,
and
after
a
parley
admitted
.
I
have
nothing
pleasant
to
*NL*
tell
about
that
visit
.
But
it
was
not
a
disappointment
,
for
I
knew
*NL*
Mrs.
le
Fay
by
reputation
,
and
was
not
expecting
anything
pleasant
.
*NL*
She
was
held
in
awe
by
the
whole
realm
,
for
she
had
made
everybody
*NL*
believe
she
was
a
great
sorceress
.
All
her
ways
were
wicked
,
all
*NL*
her
instincts
devilish
.
She
was
loaded
to
the
eyelids
with
cold
*NL*
malice
.
All
her
history
was
black
with
crime
;
and
among
her
crimes
*NL*
murder
was
common
.
I
was
most
curious
to
see
her
;
as
curious
as
*NL*
I
could
have
been
to
see
Satan
.
To
my
surprise
she
was
beautiful
;
*NL*
black
thoughts
had
failed
to
make
her
expression
repulsive
,
age
*NL*
had
failed
to
wrinkle
her
satin
skin
or
mar
its
bloomy
freshness
.
*NL*
She
could
have
passed
for
old
Uriens
'
granddaughter
,
she
could
*NL*
have
been
mistaken
for
sister
to
her
own
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
were
fairly
within
the
castle
gates
we
were
ordered
*NL*
into
her
presence
.
King
Uriens
was
there
,
a
kind-faced
old
man
*NL*
with
a
subdued
look
;
and
also
the
son
,
Sir
Uwaine
le
Blanchemains
,
*NL*
in
whom
I
was
,
of
course
,
interested
on
account
of
the
tradition
*NL*
that
he
had
once
done
battle
with
thirty
knights
,
and
also
on
*NL*
account
of
his
trip
with
Sir
Gawaine
and
Sir
Marhaus
,
which
Sandy
*NL*
had
been
aging
me
with
.
But
Morgan
was
the
main
attraction
,
the
*NL*
conspicuous
personality
here
;
she
was
head
chief
of
this
household
,
*NL*
that
was
plain
.
She
caused
us
to
be
seated
,
and
then
she
began
,
*NL*
with
all
manner
of
pretty
graces
and
graciousnesses
,
to
ask
me
*NL*
questions
.
Dear
me
,
it
was
like
a
bird
or
a
flute
,
or
something
,
*NL*
talking
.
I
felt
persuaded
that
this
woman
must
have
been
*NL*
misrepresented
,
lied
about
.
She
trilled
along
,
and
trilled
along
,
*NL*
and
presently
a
handsome
young
page
,
clothed
like
the
rainbow
,
and
*NL*
as
easy
and
undulatory
of
movement
as
a
wave
,
came
with
something
*NL*
on
a
golden
salver
,
and
,
kneeling
to
present
it
to
her
,
overdid
*NL*
his
graces
and
lost
his
balance
,
and
so
fell
lightly
against
her
*NL*
knee
.
She
slipped
a
dirk
into
him
in
as
matter-of-course
a
way
as
*NL*
another
person
would
have
harpooned
a
rat
!
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
child
!
he
slumped
to
the
floor
,
twisted
his
silken
limbs
in
*NL*
one
great
straining
contortion
of
pain
,
and
was
dead
.
Out
of
the
*NL*
old
king
was
wrung
an
involuntary
``
O-h
!
''
of
compassion
.
The
look
*NL*
he
got
,
made
him
cut
it
suddenly
short
and
not
put
any
more
hyphens
*NL*
in
it
.
Sir
Uwaine
,
at
a
sign
from
his
mother
,
went
to
the
anteroom
*NL*
and
called
some
servants
,
and
meanwhile
madame
went
rippling
sweetly
*NL*
along
with
her
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
that
she
was
a
good
housekeeper
,
for
while
she
talked
she
*NL*
kept
a
corner
of
her
eye
on
the
servants
to
see
that
they
made
*NL*
no
balks
in
handling
the
body
and
getting
it
out
;
when
they
came
*NL*
with
fresh
clean
towels
,
she
sent
back
for
the
other
kind
;
and
*NL*
when
they
had
finished
wiping
the
floor
and
were
going
,
she
indicated
*NL*
a
crimson
fleck
the
size
of
a
tear
which
their
duller
eyes
had
*NL*
overlooked
.
It
was
plain
to
me
that
La
Cote
Male
Taile
had
failed
*NL*
to
see
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
Often
,
how
louder
and
clearer
*NL*
than
any
tongue
,
does
dumb
circumstantial
evidence
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morgan
le
Fay
rippled
along
as
musically
as
ever
.
Marvelous
woman
.
*NL*
And
what
a
glance
she
had
:
when
it
fell
in
reproof
upon
those
*NL*
servants
,
they
shrunk
and
quailed
as
timid
people
do
when
the
*NL*
lightning
flashes
out
of
a
cloud
.
I
could
have
got
the
habit
*NL*
myself
.
It
was
the
same
with
that
poor
old
Brer
Uriens
;
he
was
*NL*
always
on
the
ragged
edge
of
apprehension
;
she
could
not
even
turn
*NL*
toward
him
but
he
winced
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
talk
I
let
drop
a
complimentary
word
about
*NL*
King
Arthur
,
forgetting
for
the
moment
how
this
woman
hated
her
*NL*
brother
.
That
one
little
compliment
was
enough
.
She
clouded
up
*NL*
like
storm
;
she
called
for
her
guards
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hale
me
these
varlets
to
the
dungeons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
struck
cold
on
my
ears
,
for
her
dungeons
had
a
reputation
.
*NL*
Nothing
occurred
to
me
to
say
--
or
do
.
But
not
so
with
Sandy
.
*NL*
As
the
guard
laid
a
hand
upon
me
,
she
piped
up
with
the
tranquilest
*NL*
confidence
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
's
wounds
,
dost
thou
covet
destruction
,
thou
maniac
?
It
is
*NL*
The
Boss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
what
a
happy
idea
that
was
!
--
and
so
simple
;
yet
it
would
never
*NL*
have
occurred
to
me
.
I
was
born
modest
;
not
all
over
,
but
in
spots
;
*NL*
and
this
was
one
of
the
spots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
upon
madame
was
electrical
.
It
cleared
her
countenance
*NL*
and
brought
back
her
smiles
and
all
her
persuasive
graces
and
*NL*
blandishments
;
but
nevertheless
she
was
not
able
to
entirely
cover
up
*NL*
with
them
the
fact
that
she
was
in
a
ghastly
fright
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
,
but
do
list
to
thine
handmaid
!
as
if
one
gifted
with
powers
*NL*
like
to
mine
might
say
the
thing
which
I
have
said
unto
one
who
*NL*
has
vanquished
Merlin
,
and
not
be
jesting
.
By
mine
enchantments
*NL*
I
foresaw
your
coming
,
and
by
them
I
knew
you
when
you
entered
*NL*
here
.
I
did
but
play
this
little
jest
with
hope
to
surprise
you
*NL*
into
some
display
of
your
art
,
as
not
doubting
you
would
blast
*NL*
the
guards
with
occult
fires
,
consuming
them
to
ashes
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
a
marvel
much
beyond
mine
own
ability
,
yet
one
which
I
have
long
*NL*
been
childishly
curious
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guards
were
less
curious
,
and
got
out
as
soon
as
they
got
permission
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
A
ROYAL
BANQUET
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
,
seeing
me
pacific
and
unresentful
,
no
doubt
judged
that
*NL*
I
was
deceived
by
her
excuse
;
for
her
fright
dissolved
away
,
and
*NL*
she
was
soon
so
importunate
to
have
me
give
an
exhibition
and
kill
*NL*
somebody
,
that
the
thing
grew
to
be
embarrassing
.
However
,
to
my
*NL*
relief
she
was
presently
interrupted
by
the
call
to
prayers
.
I
will
*NL*
say
this
much
for
the
nobility
:
that
,
tyrannical
,
murderous
,
*NL*
rapacious
,
and
morally
rotten
as
they
were
,
they
were
deeply
and
*NL*
enthusiastically
religious
.
Nothing
could
divert
them
from
the
*NL*
regular
and
faithful
performance
of
the
pieties
enjoined
by
the
*NL*
Church
.
More
than
once
I
had
seen
a
noble
who
had
gotten
his
*NL*
enemy
at
a
disadvantage
,
stop
to
pray
before
cutting
his
throat
;
*NL*
more
than
once
I
had
seen
a
noble
,
after
ambushing
and
despatching
*NL*
his
enemy
,
retire
to
the
nearest
wayside
shrine
and
humbly
give
*NL*
thanks
,
without
even
waiting
to
rob
the
body
.
There
was
to
be
*NL*
nothing
finer
or
sweeter
in
the
life
of
even
Benvenuto
Cellini
,
*NL*
that
rough-hewn
saint
,
ten
centuries
later
.
All
the
nobles
of
*NL*
Britain
,
with
their
families
,
attended
divine
service
morning
and
*NL*
night
daily
,
in
their
private
chapels
,
and
even
the
worst
of
them
*NL*
had
family
worship
five
or
six
times
a
day
besides
.
The
credit
*NL*
of
this
belonged
entirely
to
the
Church
.
Although
I
was
no
friend
*NL*
to
that
Catholic
Church
,
I
was
obliged
to
admit
this
.
And
often
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
me
,
I
found
myself
saying
,
``
What
would
this
country
*NL*
be
without
the
Church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
prayers
we
had
dinner
in
a
great
banqueting
hall
which
was
*NL*
lighted
by
hundreds
of
grease-jets
,
and
everything
was
as
fine
and
*NL*
lavish
and
rudely
splendid
as
might
become
the
royal
degree
of
the
*NL*
hosts
.
At
the
head
of
the
hall
,
on
a
dais
,
was
the
table
of
the
*NL*
king
,
queen
,
and
their
son
,
Prince
Uwaine
.
Stretching
down
the
hall
*NL*
from
this
,
was
the
general
table
,
on
the
floor
.
At
this
,
above
*NL*
the
salt
,
sat
the
visiting
nobles
and
the
grown
members
of
their
*NL*
families
,
of
both
sexes
,
--
the
resident
Court
,
in
effect
--
sixty-one
*NL*
persons
;
below
the
salt
sat
minor
officers
of
the
household
,
with
*NL*
their
principal
subordinates
:
altogether
a
hundred
and
eighteen
*NL*
persons
sitting
,
and
about
as
many
liveried
servants
standing
*NL*
behind
their
chairs
,
or
serving
in
one
capacity
or
another
.
It
was
*NL*
a
very
fine
show
.
In
a
gallery
a
band
with
cymbals
,
horns
,
harps
,
*NL*
and
other
horrors
,
opened
the
proceedings
with
what
seemed
to
be
*NL*
the
crude
first-draft
or
original
agony
of
the
wail
known
to
later
*NL*
centuries
as
``
In
the
Sweet
Bye
and
Bye
.
''
It
was
new
,
and
ought
*NL*
to
have
been
rehearsed
a
little
more
.
For
some
reason
or
other
*NL*
the
queen
had
the
composer
hanged
,
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
music
,
the
priest
who
stood
behind
the
royal
table
said
*NL*
a
noble
long
grace
in
ostensible
Latin
.
Then
the
battalion
of
*NL*
waiters
broke
away
from
their
posts
,
and
darted
,
rushed
,
flew
,
*NL*
fetched
and
carried
,
and
the
mighty
feeding
began
;
no
words
*NL*
anywhere
,
but
absorbing
attention
to
business
.
The
rows
of
chops
*NL*
opened
and
shut
in
vast
unison
,
and
the
sound
of
it
was
like
to
*NL*
the
muffled
burr
of
subterranean
machinery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
havoc
continued
an
hour
and
a
half
,
and
unimaginable
was
the
*NL*
destruction
of
substantials
.
Of
the
chief
feature
of
the
feast
*NL*
--
the
huge
wild
boar
that
lay
stretched
out
so
portly
and
imposing
*NL*
at
the
start
--
nothing
was
left
but
the
semblance
of
a
hoop-skirt
;
*NL*
and
he
was
but
the
type
and
symbol
of
what
had
happened
to
all
*NL*
the
other
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
pastries
and
so
on
,
the
heavy
drinking
began
--
and
the
talk
.
*NL*
Gallon
after
gallon
of
wine
and
mead
disappeared
,
and
everybody
*NL*
got
comfortable
,
then
happy
,
then
sparklingly
joyous
--
both
sexes
,
*NL*
--
and
by
and
by
pretty
noisy
.
Men
told
anecdotes
that
were
terrific
*NL*
to
hear
,
but
nobody
blushed
;
and
when
the
nub
was
sprung
,
the
*NL*
assemblage
let
go
with
a
horse-laugh
that
shook
the
fortress
.
*NL*
Ladies
answered
back
with
historiettes
that
would
almost
have
made
*NL*
Queen
Margaret
of
Navarre
or
even
the
great
Elizabeth
of
England
*NL*
hide
behind
a
handkerchief
,
but
nobody
hid
here
,
but
only
laughed
*NL*
--
howled
,
you
may
say
.
In
pretty
much
all
of
these
dreadful
stories
,
*NL*
ecclesiastics
were
the
hardy
heroes
,
but
that
did
n't
worry
the
*NL*
chaplain
any
,
he
had
his
laugh
with
the
rest
;
more
than
that
,
upon
*NL*
invitation
he
roared
out
a
song
which
was
of
as
daring
a
sort
as
*NL*
any
that
was
sung
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
midnight
everybody
was
fagged
out
,
and
sore
with
laughing
;
and
,
*NL*
as
a
rule
,
drunk
:
some
weepingly
,
some
affectionately
,
some
*NL*
hilariously
,
some
quarrelsomely
,
some
dead
and
under
the
table
.
*NL*
Of
the
ladies
,
the
worst
spectacle
was
a
lovely
young
duchess
,
whose
*NL*
wedding-eve
this
was
;
and
indeed
she
was
a
spectacle
,
sure
enough
.
*NL*
Just
as
she
was
she
could
have
sat
in
advance
for
the
portrait
of
the
*NL*
young
daughter
of
the
Regent
d'Orleans
,
at
the
famous
dinner
whence
*NL*
she
was
carried
,
foul-mouthed
,
intoxicated
,
and
helpless
,
to
her
bed
,
*NL*
in
the
lost
and
lamented
days
of
the
Ancient
Regime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
even
while
the
priest
was
lifting
his
hands
,
and
all
*NL*
conscious
heads
were
bowed
in
reverent
expectation
of
the
coming
*NL*
blessing
,
there
appeared
under
the
arch
of
the
far-off
door
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
hall
an
old
and
bent
and
white-haired
lady
,
*NL*
leaning
upon
a
crutch-stick
;
and
she
lifted
the
stick
and
pointed
it
*NL*
toward
the
queen
and
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wrath
and
curse
of
God
fall
upon
you
,
woman
without
pity
,
*NL*
who
have
slain
mine
innocent
grandchild
and
made
desolate
this
*NL*
old
heart
that
had
nor
chick
,
nor
friend
nor
stay
nor
comfort
in
*NL*
all
this
world
but
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
crossed
himself
in
a
grisly
fright
,
for
a
curse
was
an
*NL*
awful
thing
to
those
people
;
but
the
queen
rose
up
majestic
,
with
*NL*
the
death-light
in
her
eye
,
and
flung
back
this
ruthless
command
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lay
hands
on
her
!
To
the
stake
with
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guards
left
their
posts
to
obey
.
It
was
a
shame
;
it
was
a
*NL*
cruel
thing
to
see
.
What
could
be
done
?
Sandy
gave
me
a
look
;
*NL*
I
knew
she
had
another
inspiration
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
you
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
up
and
facing
toward
the
queen
in
a
moment
.
She
indicated
*NL*
me
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
_
he
_
saith
this
may
not
be
.
Recall
the
commandment
,
or
he
*NL*
will
dissolve
the
castle
and
it
shall
vanish
away
like
the
instable
*NL*
fabric
of
a
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Confound
it
,
what
a
crazy
contract
to
pledge
a
person
to
!
What
if
*NL*
the
queen
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
consternation
subsided
there
,
and
my
panic
passed
off
;
*NL*
for
the
queen
,
all
in
a
collapse
,
made
no
show
of
resistance
but
*NL*
gave
a
countermanding
sign
and
sunk
into
her
seat
.
When
she
reached
*NL*
it
she
was
sober
.
So
were
many
of
the
others
.
The
assemblage
rose
,
*NL*
whiffed
ceremony
to
the
winds
,
and
rushed
for
the
door
like
a
mob
;
*NL*
overturning
chairs
,
smashing
crockery
,
tugging
,
struggling
,
*NL*
shouldering
,
crowding
--
anything
to
get
out
before
I
should
change
*NL*
my
mind
and
puff
the
castle
into
the
measureless
dim
vacancies
of
*NL*
space
.
Well
,
well
,
well
,
they
_
were
_
a
superstitious
lot
.
It
is
*NL*
all
a
body
can
do
to
conceive
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
queen
was
so
scared
and
humbled
that
she
was
even
afraid
*NL*
to
hang
the
composer
without
first
consulting
me
.
I
was
very
sorry
*NL*
for
her
--
indeed
,
any
one
would
have
been
,
for
she
was
really
*NL*
suffering
;
so
I
was
willing
to
do
anything
that
was
reasonable
,
and
*NL*
had
no
desire
to
carry
things
to
wanton
extremities
.
I
therefore
*NL*
considered
the
matter
thoughtfully
,
and
ended
by
having
the
*NL*
musicians
ordered
into
our
presence
to
play
that
Sweet
Bye
and
*NL*
Bye
again
,
which
they
did
.
Then
I
saw
that
she
was
right
,
and
*NL*
gave
her
permission
to
hang
the
whole
band
.
This
little
relaxation
*NL*
of
sternness
had
a
good
effect
upon
the
queen
.
A
statesman
gains
*NL*
little
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
iron-clad
authority
upon
all
*NL*
occasions
that
offer
,
for
this
wounds
the
just
pride
of
his
*NL*
subordinates
,
and
thus
tends
to
undermine
his
strength
.
A
little
*NL*
concession
,
now
and
then
,
where
it
can
do
no
harm
,
is
the
wiser
policy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
the
queen
was
at
ease
in
her
mind
once
more
,
and
measurably
*NL*
happy
,
her
wine
naturally
began
to
assert
itself
again
,
and
it
got
*NL*
a
little
the
start
of
her
.
I
mean
it
set
her
music
going
--
her
silver
*NL*
bell
of
a
tongue
.
Dear
me
,
she
was
a
master
talker
.
It
would
not
*NL*
become
me
to
suggest
that
it
was
pretty
late
and
that
I
was
a
tired
*NL*
man
and
very
sleepy
.
I
wished
I
had
gone
off
to
bed
when
I
had
*NL*
the
chance
.
Now
I
must
stick
it
out
;
there
was
no
other
way
.
So
*NL*
she
tinkled
along
and
along
,
in
the
otherwise
profound
and
ghostly
*NL*
hush
of
the
sleeping
castle
,
until
by
and
by
there
came
,
as
if
*NL*
from
deep
down
under
us
,
a
far-away
sound
,
as
of
a
muffled
shriek
*NL*
--
with
an
expression
of
agony
about
it
that
made
my
flesh
crawl
.
*NL*
The
queen
stopped
,
and
her
eyes
lighted
with
pleasure
;
she
tilted
*NL*
her
graceful
head
as
a
bird
does
when
it
listens
.
The
sound
bored
*NL*
its
way
up
through
the
stillness
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
truly
a
stubborn
soul
,
and
endureth
long
.
It
is
many
hours
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Endureth
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rack
.
Come
--
ye
shall
see
a
blithe
sight
.
An
he
yield
not
*NL*
his
secret
now
,
ye
shall
see
him
torn
asunder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
silky
smooth
hellion
she
was
;
and
so
composed
and
serene
,
*NL*
when
the
cords
all
down
my
legs
were
hurting
in
sympathy
with
that
*NL*
man
's
pain
.
Conducted
by
mailed
guards
bearing
flaring
torches
,
*NL*
we
tramped
along
echoing
corridors
,
and
down
stone
stairways
dank
*NL*
and
dripping
,
and
smelling
of
mould
and
ages
of
imprisoned
night
*NL*
--
a
chill
,
uncanny
journey
and
a
long
one
,
and
not
made
the
shorter
*NL*
or
the
cheerier
by
the
sorceress
's
talk
,
which
was
about
this
*NL*
sufferer
and
his
crime
.
He
had
been
accused
by
an
anonymous
*NL*
informer
,
of
having
killed
a
stag
in
the
royal
preserves
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anonymous
testimony
is
n't
just
the
right
thing
,
your
Highness
.
*NL*
It
were
fairer
to
confront
the
accused
with
the
accuser
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
thought
of
that
,
it
being
but
of
small
consequence
.
*NL*
But
an
I
would
,
I
could
not
,
for
that
the
accuser
came
masked
by
*NL*
night
,
and
told
the
forester
,
and
straightway
got
him
hence
again
,
*NL*
and
so
the
forester
knoweth
him
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
is
this
Unknown
the
only
person
who
saw
the
stag
killed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
_
no
_
man
_
saw
_
the
killing
,
but
this
Unknown
saw
this
hardy
*NL*
wretch
near
to
the
spot
where
the
stag
lay
,
and
came
with
right
*NL*
loyal
zeal
and
betrayed
him
to
the
forester
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
Unknown
was
near
the
dead
stag
,
too
?
Is
n't
it
just
possible
*NL*
that
he
did
the
killing
himself
?
His
loyal
zeal
--
in
a
mask
--
looks
*NL*
just
a
shade
suspicious
.
But
what
is
your
highness
's
idea
for
*NL*
racking
the
prisoner
?
Where
is
the
profit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
confess
,
else
;
and
then
were
his
soul
lost
.
For
his
*NL*
crime
his
life
is
forfeited
by
the
law
--
and
of
a
surety
will
I
see
*NL*
that
he
payeth
it
!
--
but
it
were
peril
to
my
own
soul
to
let
him
*NL*
die
unconfessed
and
unabsolved
.
Nay
,
I
were
a
fool
to
fling
me
*NL*
into
hell
for
_
his
_
accommodation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
your
Highness
,
suppose
he
has
nothing
to
confess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
that
,
we
shall
see
,
anon
.
An
I
rack
him
to
death
and
he
*NL*
confess
not
,
it
will
peradventure
show
that
he
had
indeed
naught
*NL*
to
confess
--
ye
will
grant
that
that
is
sooth
?
Then
shall
I
not
be
*NL*
damned
for
an
unconfessed
man
that
had
naught
to
confess
*NL*
--
wherefore
,
I
shall
be
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
stubborn
unreasoning
of
the
time
.
It
was
useless
to
*NL*
argue
with
her
.
Arguments
have
no
chance
against
petrified
*NL*
training
;
they
wear
it
as
little
as
the
waves
wear
a
cliff
.
And
*NL*
her
training
was
everybody
's
.
The
brightest
intellect
in
the
land
*NL*
would
not
have
been
able
to
see
that
her
position
was
defective
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
entered
the
rack-cell
I
caught
a
picture
that
will
not
go
*NL*
from
me
;
I
wish
it
would
.
A
native
young
giant
of
thirty
or
*NL*
thereabouts
lay
stretched
upon
the
frame
on
his
back
,
with
his
*NL*
wrists
and
ankles
tied
to
ropes
which
led
over
windlasses
at
either
*NL*
end
.
There
was
no
color
in
him
;
his
features
were
contorted
and
*NL*
set
,
and
sweat-drops
stood
upon
his
forehead
.
A
priest
bent
over
*NL*
him
on
each
side
;
the
executioner
stood
by
;
guards
were
on
duty
;
*NL*
smoking
torches
stood
in
sockets
along
the
walls
;
in
a
corner
*NL*
crouched
a
poor
young
creature
,
her
face
drawn
with
anguish
,
*NL*
a
half-wild
and
hunted
look
in
her
eyes
,
and
in
her
lap
lay
a
little
*NL*
child
asleep
.
Just
as
we
stepped
across
the
threshold
the
*NL*
executioner
gave
his
machine
a
slight
turn
,
which
wrung
a
cry
*NL*
from
both
the
prisoner
and
the
woman
;
but
I
shouted
,
and
the
*NL*
executioner
released
the
strain
without
waiting
to
see
who
spoke
.
*NL*
I
could
not
let
this
horror
go
on
;
it
would
have
killed
me
to
*NL*
see
it
.
I
asked
the
queen
to
let
me
clear
the
place
and
speak
*NL*
to
the
prisoner
privately
;
and
when
she
was
going
to
object
I
spoke
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
and
said
I
did
not
want
to
make
a
scene
before
*NL*
her
servants
,
but
I
must
have
my
way
;
for
I
was
King
Arthur
's
*NL*
representative
,
and
was
speaking
in
his
name
.
She
saw
she
had
*NL*
to
yield
.
I
asked
her
to
indorse
me
to
these
people
,
and
then
*NL*
leave
me
.
It
was
not
pleasant
for
her
,
but
she
took
the
pill
;
*NL*
and
even
went
further
than
I
was
meaning
to
require
.
I
only
wanted
*NL*
the
backing
of
her
own
authority
;
but
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
will
do
in
all
things
as
this
lord
shall
command
.
It
is
The
Boss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
a
good
word
to
conjure
with
:
you
could
see
it
*NL*
by
the
squirming
of
these
rats
.
The
queen
's
guards
fell
into
line
,
*NL*
and
she
and
they
marched
away
,
with
their
torch-bearers
,
and
woke
*NL*
the
echoes
of
the
cavernous
tunnels
with
the
measured
beat
of
their
*NL*
retreating
footfalls
.
I
had
the
prisoner
taken
from
the
rack
and
*NL*
placed
upon
his
bed
,
and
medicaments
applied
to
his
hurts
,
and
*NL*
wine
given
him
to
drink
.
The
woman
crept
near
and
looked
on
,
*NL*
eagerly
,
lovingly
,
but
timorously
,
--
like
one
who
fears
a
repulse
;
*NL*
indeed
,
she
tried
furtively
to
touch
the
man
's
forehead
,
and
jumped
*NL*
back
,
the
picture
of
fright
,
when
I
turned
unconsciously
toward
*NL*
her
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
''
I
said
,
``
stroke
him
,
lass
,
if
you
want
to
.
Do
anything
*NL*
you
're
a
mind
to
;
do
n't
mind
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
her
eyes
were
as
grateful
as
an
animal
's
,
when
you
do
it
*NL*
a
kindness
that
it
understands
.
The
baby
was
out
of
her
way
and
*NL*
she
had
her
cheek
against
the
man
's
in
a
minute
and
her
hands
*NL*
fondling
his
hair
,
and
her
happy
tears
running
down
.
The
man
*NL*
revived
and
caressed
his
wife
with
his
eyes
,
which
was
all
he
*NL*
could
do
.
I
judged
I
might
clear
the
den
,
now
,
and
I
did
;
cleared
*NL*
it
of
all
but
the
family
and
myself
.
Then
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
friend
,
tell
me
your
side
of
this
matter
;
I
know
*NL*
the
other
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
moved
his
head
in
sign
of
refusal
.
But
the
woman
looked
*NL*
pleased
--
as
it
seemed
to
me
--
pleased
with
my
suggestion
.
I
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
All
do
,
in
Arthur
's
realms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
reputation
has
come
to
you
right
and
straight
,
you
should
*NL*
not
be
afraid
to
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
broke
in
,
eagerly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
fair
my
lord
,
do
thou
persuade
him
!
Thou
canst
an
thou
wilt
.
*NL*
Ah
,
he
suffereth
so
;
and
it
is
for
me
--
for
_
me
_
!
And
how
can
I
bear
it
?
*NL*
I
would
I
might
see
him
die
--
a
sweet
,
swift
death
;
oh
,
my
Hugo
,
*NL*
I
can
not
bear
this
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
fell
to
sobbing
and
grovelling
about
my
feet
,
and
still
*NL*
imploring
.
Imploring
what
?
The
man
's
death
?
I
could
not
quite
*NL*
get
the
bearings
of
the
thing
.
But
Hugo
interrupted
her
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
!
Ye
wit
not
what
ye
ask
.
Shall
I
starve
whom
I
love
,
*NL*
to
win
a
gentle
death
?
I
wend
thou
knewest
me
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
ca
n't
quite
make
this
out
.
It
is
a
puzzle
.
Now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
my
lord
,
an
ye
will
but
persuade
him
!
Consider
how
*NL*
these
his
tortures
wound
me
!
Oh
,
and
he
will
not
speak
!
--
whereas
,
*NL*
the
healing
,
the
solace
that
lie
in
a
blessed
swift
death
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
are

you
maundering
about

He
's
going
out
from
here
a
free
*NL*
man
and
whole
--
he
's
not
going
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
white
face
lit
up
,
and
the
woman
flung
herself
at
me
*NL*
in
a
most
surprising
explosion
of
joy
,
and
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
saved
!
--
for
it
is
the
king
's
word
by
the
mouth
of

servant

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

``

stood
the
torture

refused

plain

enough

the
dullest
understanding

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
QUEEN
'S
DUNGEONS
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
arranged
all
that
;
and
I
had
the
man
sent
to
his
home
.
*NL*
I
had
a
great
desire
to
rack
the
executioner
;
not
because
he
was
*NL*
a
good
,
painstaking
and
paingiving
official
,
--
for
surely
it
was
*NL*
not
to
his
discredit
that
he
performed
his
functions
well
--
but
to
*NL*
pay
him
back
for
wantonly
cuffing
and
otherwise
distressing
that
*NL*
young
woman
.
The
priests
told
me
about
this
,
and
were
generously
*NL*
hot
to
have
him
punished
.
Something
of
this
disagreeable
sort
*NL*
was
turning
up
every
now
and
then
.
I
mean
,
episodes
that
showed
*NL*
that
not
all
priests
were
frauds
and
self-seekers
,
but
that
many
,
*NL*
even
the
great
majority
,
of
these
that
were
down
on
the
ground
*NL*
among
the
common
people
,
were
sincere
and
right-hearted
,
and
*NL*
devoted
to
the
alleviation
of
human
troubles
and
sufferings
.
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
a
thing
which
could
not
be
helped
,
so
I
seldom
fretted
*NL*
about
it
,
and
never
many
minutes
at
a
time
;
it
has
never
been
my
*NL*
way
to
bother
much
about
things
which
you
ca
n't
cure
.
But
I
did
*NL*
not
like
it
,
for
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
to
keep
people
*NL*
reconciled
to
an
Established
Church
.
We
_
must
_
have
a
religion
*NL*
--
it
goes
without
saying
--
but
my
idea
is
,
to
have
it
cut
up
into
*NL*
forty
free
sects
,
so
that
they
will
police
each
other
,
as
had
been
*NL*
the
case
in
the
United
States
in
my
time
.
Concentration
of
power
*NL*
in
a
political
machine
is
bad
;
and
an
Established
Church
is
*NL*
only
a
political
machine
;
it
was
invented
for
that
;
it
is
nursed
,
*NL*
cradled
,
preserved
for
that
;
it
is
an
enemy
to
human
liberty
,
and
*NL*
does
no
good
which
it
could
not
better
do
in
a
split-up
and
scattered
*NL*
condition
.
That
was
n't
law
;
it
was
n't
gospel
:
it
was
only
*NL*
an
opinion
--
my
opinion
,
and
I
was
only
a
man
,
one
man
:
so
it
was
n't
*NL*
worth
any
more
than
the
pope
's
--
or
any
less
,
for
that
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
could
n't
rack
the
executioner
,
neither
would
I
overlook
*NL*
the
just
complaint
of
the
priests
.
The
man
must
be
punished
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
so
I
degraded
him
from
his
office
and
made
him
*NL*
leader
of
the
band
--
the
new
one
that
was
to
be
started
.
He
begged
*NL*
hard
,
and
said
he
could
n't
play
--
a
plausible
excuse
,
but
too
thin
;
*NL*
there
was
n't
a
musician
in
the
country
that
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
was
a
good
deal
outraged
,
next
morning
when
she
found
*NL*
she
was
going
to
have
neither
Hugo
's
life
nor
his
property
.
But
*NL*
I
told
her
she
must
bear
this
cross
;
that
while
by
law
and
custom
*NL*
she
certainly
was
entitled
to
both
the
man
's
life
and
his
property
,
*NL*
there
were
extenuating
circumstances
,
and
so
in
Arthur
the
king
's
*NL*
name
I
had
pardoned
him
.
The
deer
was
ravaging
the
man
's
fields
,
*NL*
and
he
had
killed
it
in
sudden
passion
,
and
not
for
gain
;
and
he
*NL*
had
carried
it
into
the
royal
forest
in
the
hope
that
that
might
make
*NL*
detection
of
the
misdoer
impossible
.
Confound
her
,
I
could
n't
*NL*
make
her
see
that
sudden
passion
is
an
extenuating
circumstance
*NL*
in
the
killing
of
venison
--
or
of
a
person
--
so
I
gave
it
up
and
let
*NL*
her
sulk
it
out
.
I
_
did
_
think
I
was
going
to
make
her
see
it
by
*NL*
remarking
that
her
own
sudden
passion
in
the
case
of
the
page
*NL*
modified
that
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crime
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
How
thou
talkest
!
Crime
,
forsooth
!
*NL*
Man
,
I
am
going
to
_
pay
_
for
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
it
was
no
use
to
waste
sense
on
her
.
Training
--
training
is
*NL*
everything
;
training
is
all
there
is
_
to
_
a
person
.
We
speak
of
*NL*
nature
;
it
is
folly
;
there
is
no
such
thing
as
nature
;
what
we
*NL*
call
by
that
misleading
name
is
merely
heredity
and
training
.
*NL*
We
have
no
thoughts
of
our
own
,
no
opinions
of
our
own
;
they
are
*NL*
transmitted
to
us
,
trained
into
us
.
All
that
is
original
in
us
,
*NL*
and
therefore
fairly
creditable
or
discreditable
to
us
,
can
be
*NL*
covered
up
and
hidden
by
the
point
of
a
cambric
needle
,
all
the
*NL*
rest
being
atoms
contributed
by
,
and
inherited
from
,
a
procession
*NL*
of
ancestors
that
stretches
back
a
billion
years
to
the
Adam-clam
*NL*
or
grasshopper
or
monkey
from
whom
our
race
has
been
so
tediously
*NL*
and
ostentatiously
and
unprofitably
developed
.
And
as
for
me
,
*NL*
all
that
I
think
about
in
this
plodding
sad
pilgrimage
,
this
*NL*
pathetic
drift
between
the
eternities
,
is
to
look
out
and
humbly
*NL*
live
a
pure
and
high
and
blameless
life
,
and
save
that
one
*NL*
microscopic
atom
in
me
that
is
truly
_
me
_
:
the
rest
may
land
in
*NL*
Sheol
and
welcome
for
all
I
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
confound
her
,
her
intellect
was
good
,
she
had
brains
enough
,
*NL*
but
her
training
made
her
an
ass
--
that
is
,
from
a
many-centuries-later
*NL*
point
of
view
.
To
kill
the
page
was
no
crime
--
it
was
her
right
;
*NL*
and
upon
her
right
she
stood
,
serenely
and
unconscious
of
offense
.
*NL*
She
was
a
result
of
generations
of
training
in
the
unexamined
and
*NL*
unassailed
belief
that
the
law
which
permitted
her
to
kill
a
subject
*NL*
when
she
chose
was
a
perfectly
right
and
righteous
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
we
must
give
even
Satan
his
due
.
She
deserved
a
compliment
*NL*
for
one
thing
;
and
I
tried
to
pay
it
,
but
the
words
stuck
in
my
*NL*
throat
.
She
had
a
right
to
kill
the
boy
,
but
she
was
in
no
wise
*NL*
obliged
to
pay
for
him
.
That
was
law
for
some
other
people
,
but
*NL*
not
for
her
.
She
knew
quite
well
that
she
was
doing
a
large
and
*NL*
generous
thing
to
pay
for
that
lad
,
and
that
I
ought
in
common
*NL*
fairness
to
come
out
with
something
handsome
about
it
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
--
my
mouth
refused
.
I
could
n't
help
seeing
,
in
my
fancy
,
*NL*
that
poor
old
grandma
with
the
broken
heart
,
and
that
fair
young
*NL*
creature
lying
butchered
,
his
little
silken
pomps
and
vanities
*NL*
laced
with
his
golden
blood
.
How
could
she
_
pay
_
for
him
!
_
Whom
_
*NL*
could
she
pay
?
And
so
,
well
knowing
that
this
woman
,
trained
*NL*
as
she
had
been
,
deserved
praise
,
even
adulation
,
I
was
yet
not
*NL*
able
to
utter
it
,
trained
as
I
had
been
.
The
best
I
could
do
was
*NL*
to
fish
up
a
compliment
from
outside
,
so
to
speak
--
and
the
pity
*NL*
of
it
was
,
that
it
was
true
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
your
people
will
adore
you
for
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
true
,
but
I
meant
to
hang
her
for
it
some
day
if
I
lived
.
*NL*
Some
of
those
laws
were
too
bad
,
altogether
too
bad
.
A
master
*NL*
might
kill
his
slave
for
nothing
--
for
mere
spite
,
malice
,
or
*NL*
to
pass
the
time
--
just
as
we
have
seen
that
the
crowned
head
could
*NL*
do
it
with
_
his
_
slave
,
that
is
to
say
,
anybody
.
A
gentleman
could
*NL*
kill
a
free
commoner
,
and
pay
for
him
--
cash
or
garden-truck
.
*NL*
A
noble
could
kill
a
noble
without
expense
,
as
far
as
the
law
was
*NL*
concerned
,
but
reprisals
in
kind
were
to
be
expected
.
_
Any_body
*NL*
could
kill
_
some_body
,
except
the
commoner
and
the
slave
;
these
had
*NL*
no
privileges
.
If
they
killed
,
it
was
murder
,
and
the
law
would
n't
*NL*
stand
murder
.
It
made
short
work
of
the
experimenter
--
and
of
*NL*
his
family
,
too
,
if
he
murdered
somebody
who
belonged
up
among
*NL*
the
ornamental
ranks
.
If
a
commoner
gave
a
noble
even
so
much
*NL*
as
a
Damiens-scratch
which
did
n't
kill
or
even
hurt
,
he
got
Damiens
'
*NL*
dose
for
it
just
the
same
;
they
pulled
him
to
rags
and
tatters
*NL*
with
horses
,
and
all
the
world
came
to
see
the
show
,
and
crack
*NL*
jokes
,
and
have
a
good
time
;
and
some
of
the
performances
of
the
*NL*
best
people
present
were
as
tough
,
and
as
properly
unprintable
,
*NL*
as
any
that
have
been
printed
by
the
pleasant
Casanova
in
his
*NL*
chapter
about
the
dismemberment
of
Louis
XV
's
poor
awkward
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
had
enough
of
this
grisly
place
by
this
time
,
and
wanted
*NL*
to
leave
,
but
I
could
n't
,
because
I
had
something
on
my
mind
that
*NL*
my
conscience
kept
prodding
me
about
,
and
would
n't
let
me
forget
.
*NL*
If
I
had
the
remaking
of
man
,
he
would
n't
have
any
conscience
.
*NL*
It
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
things
connected
with
a
person
;
*NL*
and
although
it
certainly
does
a
great
deal
of
good
,
it
can
not
*NL*
be
said
to
pay
,
in
the
long
run
;
it
would
be
much
better
to
have
*NL*
less
good
and
more
comfort
.
Still
,
this
is
only
my
opinion
,
and
*NL*
I
am
only
one
man
;
others
,
with
less
experience
,
may
think
*NL*
differently
.
They
have
a
right
to
their
view
.
I
only
stand
*NL*
to
this
:
I
have
noticed
my
conscience
for
many
years
,
and
I
know
*NL*
it
is
more
trouble
and
bother
to
me
than
anything
else
I
started
*NL*
with
.
I
suppose
that
in
the
beginning
I
prized
it
,
because
we
*NL*
prize
anything
that
is
ours
;
and
yet
how
foolish
it
was
to
think
so
.
*NL*
If
we
look
at
it
in
another
way
,
we
see
how
absurd
it
is
:
if
I
had
*NL*
an
anvil
in
me
would
I
prize
it
?
Of
course
not
.
And
yet
when
you
*NL*
come
to
think
,
there
is
no
real
difference
between
a
conscience
*NL*
and
an
anvil
--
I
mean
for
comfort
.
I
have
noticed
it
a
thousand
*NL*
times
.
And
you
could
dissolve
an
anvil
with
acids
,
when
you
*NL*
could
n't
stand
it
any
longer
;
but
there
is
n't
any
way
that
you
can
*NL*
work
off
a
conscience
--
at
least
so
it
will
stay
worked
off
;
not
*NL*
that
I
know
of
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
I
wanted
to
do
before
leaving
,
but
it
was
*NL*
a
disagreeable
matter
,
and
I
hated
to
go
at
it
.
Well
,
it
bothered
*NL*
me
all
the
morning
.
I
could
have
mentioned
it
to
the
old
king
,
*NL*
but
what
would
be
the
use
?
--
he
was
but
an
extinct
volcano
;
he
had
*NL*
been
active
in
his
time
,
but
his
fire
was
out
,
this
good
while
,
*NL*
he
was
only
a
stately
ash-pile
now
;
gentle
enough
,
and
kindly
*NL*
enough
for
my
purpose
,
without
doubt
,
but
not
usable
.
He
was
*NL*
nothing
,
this
so-called
king
:
the
queen
was
the
only
power
there
.
*NL*
And
she
was
a
Vesuvius
.
As
a
favor
,
she
might
consent
to
warm
*NL*
a
flock
of
sparrows
for
you
,
but
then
she
might
take
that
very
*NL*
opportunity
to
turn
herself
loose
and
bury
a
city
.
However
,
*NL*
I
reflected
that
as
often
as
any
other
way
,
when
you
are
expecting
*NL*
the
worst
,
you
get
something
that
is
not
so
bad
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
braced
up
and
placed
my
matter
before
her
royal
Highness
.
*NL*
I
said
I
had
been
having
a
general
jail-delivery
at
Camelot
and
*NL*
among
neighboring
castles
,
and
with
her
permission
I
would
like
*NL*
to
examine
her
collection
,
her
bric-a-brac
--
that
is
to
say
,
her
*NL*
prisoners
.
She
resisted
;
but
I
was
expecting
that
.
But
she
finally
*NL*
consented
.
I
was
expecting
that
,
too
,
but
not
so
soon
.
That
about
*NL*
ended
my
discomfort
.
She
called
her
guards
and
torches
,
and
*NL*
we
went
down
into
the
dungeons
.
These
were
down
under
the
castle
's
*NL*
foundations
,
and
mainly
were
small
cells
hollowed
out
of
the
living
*NL*
rock
.
Some
of
these
cells
had
no
light
at
all
.
In
one
of
them
was
*NL*
a
woman
,
in
foul
rags
,
who
sat
on
the
ground
,
and
would
not
answer
*NL*
a
question
or
speak
a
word
,
but
only
looked
up
at
us
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
through
a
cobweb
of
tangled
hair
,
as
if
to
see
what
casual
thing
*NL*
it
might
be
that
was
disturbing
with
sound
and
light
the
meaningless
*NL*
dull
dream
that
was
become
her
life
;
after
that
,
she
sat
bowed
,
*NL*
with
her
dirt-caked
fingers
idly
interlocked
in
her
lap
,
and
gave
*NL*
no
further
sign
.
This
poor
rack
of
bones
was
a
woman
of
middle
*NL*
age
,
apparently
;
but
only
apparently
;
she
had
been
there
nine
*NL*
years
,
and
was
eighteen
when
she
entered
.
She
was
a
commoner
,
*NL*
and
had
been
sent
here
on
her
bridal
night
by
Sir
Breuse
Sance
Pite
,
*NL*
a
neighboring
lord
whose
vassal
her
father
was
,
and
to
which
said
*NL*
lord
she
had
refused
what
has
since
been
called
le
droit
du
*NL*
seigneur
,
and
,
moreover
,
had
opposed
violence
to
violence
and
spilt
*NL*
half
a
gill
of
his
almost
sacred
blood
.
The
young
husband
had
*NL*
interfered
at
that
point
,
believing
the
bride
's
life
in
danger
,
*NL*
and
had
flung
the
noble
out
into
the
midst
of
the
humble
and
*NL*
trembling
wedding
guests
,
in
the
parlor
,
and
left
him
there
*NL*
astonished
at
this
strange
treatment
,
and
implacably
embittered
*NL*
against
both
bride
and
groom
.
The
said
lord
being
cramped
for
*NL*
dungeon-room
had
asked
the
queen
to
accommodate
his
two
criminals
,
*NL*
and
here
in
her
bastile
they
had
been
ever
since
;
hither
,
indeed
,
*NL*
they
had
come
before
their
crime
was
an
hour
old
,
and
had
never
*NL*
seen
each
other
since
.
Here
they
were
,
kenneled
like
toads
in
the
*NL*
same
rock
;
they
had
passed
nine
pitch
dark
years
within
fifty
feet
*NL*
of
each
other
,
yet
neither
knew
whether
the
other
was
alive
or
not
.
*NL*
All
the
first
years
,
their
only
question
had
been
--
asked
with
*NL*
beseechings
and
tears
that
might
have
moved
stones
,
in
time
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
hearts
are
not
stones
:
``
Is
he
alive
?
''
``
Is
she
alive
?
''
*NL*
But
they
had
never
got
an
answer
;
and
at
last
that
question
was
*NL*
not
asked
any
more
--
or
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
see
the
man
,
after
hearing
all
this
.
He
was
thirty-four
*NL*
years
old
,
and
looked
sixty
.
He
sat
upon
a
squared
block
of
*NL*
stone
,
with
his
head
bent
down
,
his
forearms
resting
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
his
long
hair
hanging
like
a
fringe
before
his
face
,
and
he
was
*NL*
muttering
to
himself
.
He
raised
his
chin
and
looked
us
slowly
*NL*
over
,
in
a
listless
dull
way
,
blinking
with
the
distress
of
the
*NL*
torchlight
,
then
dropped
his
head
and
fell
to
muttering
again
*NL*
and
took
no
further
notice
of
us
.
There
were
some
pathetically
*NL*
suggestive
dumb
witnesses
present
.
On
his
wrists
and
ankles
were
*NL*
cicatrices
,
old
smooth
scars
,
and
fastened
to
the
stone
on
which
*NL*
he
sat
was
a
chain
with
manacles
and
fetters
attached
;
but
this
*NL*
apparatus
lay
idle
on
the
ground
,
and
was
thick
with
rust
.
Chains
*NL*
cease
to
be
needed
after
the
spirit
has
gone
out
of
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
rouse
the
man
;
so
I
said
we
would
take
him
to
her
,
*NL*
and
see
--
to
the
bride
who
was
the
fairest
thing
in
the
earth
to
him
,
*NL*
once
--
roses
,
pearls
,
and
dew
made
flesh
,
for
him
;
a
wonder-work
,
*NL*
the
master-work
of
nature
:
with
eyes
like
no
other
eyes
,
and
voice
*NL*
like
no
other
voice
,
and
a
freshness
,
and
lithe
young
grace
,
and
*NL*
beauty
,
that
belonged
properly
to
the
creatures
of
dreams
--
as
he
*NL*
thought
--
and
to
no
other
.
The
sight
of
her
would
set
his
stagnant
*NL*
blood
leaping
;
the
sight
of
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
disappointment
.
They
sat
together
on
the
ground
and
*NL*
looked
dimly
wondering
into
each
other
's
faces
a
while
,
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
weak
animal
curiosity
;
then
forgot
each
other
's
presence
,
*NL*
and
dropped
their
eyes
,
and
you
saw
that
they
were
away
again
and
*NL*
wandering
in
some
far
land
of
dreams
and
shadows
that
we
know
*NL*
nothing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
them
taken
out
and
sent
to
their
friends
.
The
queen
did
not
*NL*
like
it
much
.
Not
that
she
felt
any
personal
interest
in
the
matter
,
*NL*
but
she
thought
it
disrespectful
to
Sir
Breuse
Sance
Pite
.
However
,
*NL*
I
assured
her
that
if
he
found
he
could
n't
stand
it
I
would
fix
him
*NL*
so
that
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
set
forty-seven
prisoners
loose
out
of
those
awful
rat-holes
,
*NL*
and
left
only
one
in
captivity
.
He
was
a
lord
,
and
had
killed
*NL*
another
lord
,
a
sort
of
kinsman
of
the
queen
.
That
other
lord
*NL*
had
ambushed
him
to
assassinate
him
,
but
this
fellow
had
got
the
*NL*
best
of
him
and
cut
his
throat
.
However
,
it
was
not
for
that
that
*NL*
I
left
him
jailed
,
but
for
maliciously
destroying
the
only
public
*NL*
well
in
one
of
his
wretched
villages
.
The
queen
was
bound
to
hang
*NL*
him
for
killing
her
kinsman
,
but
I
would
not
allow
it
:
it
was
no
*NL*
crime
to
kill
an
assassin
.
But
I
said
I
was
willing
to
let
her
*NL*
hang
him
for
destroying
the
well
;
so
she
concluded
to
put
up
with
*NL*
that
,
as
it
was
better
than
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
me
,
for
what
trifling
offenses
the
most
of
those
forty-seven
*NL*
men
and
women
were
shut
up
there
!
Indeed
,
some
were
there
for
*NL*
no
distinct
offense
at
all
,
but
only
to
gratify
somebody
's
spite
;
*NL*
and
not
always
the
queen
's
by
any
means
,
but
a
friend
's
.
The
newest
*NL*
prisoner
's
crime
was
a
mere
remark
which
he
had
made
.
He
said
*NL*
he
believed
that
men
were
about
all
alike
,
and
one
man
as
good
*NL*
as
another
,
barring
clothes
.
He
said
he
believed
that
if
you
were
*NL*
to
strip
the
nation
naked
and
send
a
stranger
through
the
crowd
,
he
*NL*
could
n't
tell
the
king
from
a
quack
doctor
,
nor
a
duke
from
a
hotel
*NL*
clerk
.
Apparently
here
was
a
man
whose
brains
had
not
been
reduced
*NL*
to
an
ineffectual
mush
by
idiotic
training
.
I
set
him
loose
and
*NL*
sent
him
to
the
Factory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
cells
carved
in
the
living
rock
were
just
behind
the
*NL*
face
of
the
precipice
,
and
in
each
of
these
an
arrow-slit
had
been
*NL*
pierced
outward
to
the
daylight
,
and
so
the
captive
had
a
thin
*NL*
ray
from
the
blessed
sun
for
his
comfort
.
The
case
of
one
of
*NL*
these
poor
fellows
was
particularly
hard
.
From
his
dusky
swallow
's
*NL*
hole
high
up
in
that
vast
wall
of
native
rock
he
could
peer
out
*NL*
through
the
arrow-slit
and
see
his
own
home
off
yonder
in
the
*NL*
valley
;
and
for
twenty-two
years
he
had
watched
it
,
with
heartache
*NL*
and
longing
,
through
that
crack
.
He
could
see
the
lights
shine
*NL*
there
at
night
,
and
in
the
daytime
he
could
see
figures
go
in
and
*NL*
come
out
--
his
wife
and
children
,
some
of
them
,
no
doubt
,
though
*NL*
he
could
not
make
out
at
that
distance
.
In
the
course
of
years
*NL*
he
noted
festivities
there
,
and
tried
to
rejoice
,
and
wondered
*NL*
if
they
were
weddings
or
what
they
might
be
.
And
he
noted
funerals
;
*NL*
and
they
wrung
his
heart
.
He
could
make
out
the
coffin
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
determine
its
size
,
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
*NL*
wife
or
child
.
He
could
see
the
procession
form
,
with
priests
*NL*
and
mourners
,
and
move
solemnly
away
,
bearing
the
secret
with
*NL*
them
.
He
had
left
behind
him
five
children
and
a
wife
;
and
in
*NL*
nineteen
years
he
had
seen
five
funerals
issue
,
and
none
of
them
*NL*
humble
enough
in
pomp
to
denote
a
servant
.
So
he
had
lost
five
*NL*
of
his
treasures
;
there
must
still
be
one
remaining
--
one
now
*NL*
infinitely
,
unspeakably
precious
,
--
but
_
which
_
one
?
wife
,
or
child
?
*NL*
That
was
the
question
that
tortured
him
,
by
night
and
by
day
,
*NL*
asleep
and
awake
.
Well
,
to
have
an
interest
,
of
some
sort
,
and
*NL*
half
a
ray
of
light
,
when
you
are
in
a
dungeon
,
is
a
great
support
*NL*
to
the
body
and
preserver
of
the
intellect
.
This
man
was
in
pretty
*NL*
good
condition
yet
.
By
the
time
he
had
finished
telling
me
his
*NL*
distressful
tale
,
I
was
in
the
same
state
of
mind
that
you
would
*NL*
have
been
in
yourself
,
if
you
have
got
average
human
curiosity
;
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
I
was
as
burning
up
as
he
was
to
find
out
which
*NL*
member
of
the
family
it
was
that
was
left
.
So
I
took
him
over
*NL*
home
myself
;
and
an
amazing
kind
of
a
surprise
party
it
was
,
too
*NL*
--
typhoons
and
cyclones
of
frantic
joy
,
and
whole
Niagaras
of
happy
*NL*
tears
;
and
by
George
!
we
found
the
aforetime
young
matron
graying
*NL*
toward
the
imminent
verge
of
her
half
century
,
and
the
babies
all
*NL*
men
and
women
,
and
some
of
them
married
and
experimenting
familywise
*NL*
themselves
--
for
not
a
soul
of
the
tribe
was
dead
!
Conceive
of
the
*NL*
ingenious
devilishness
of
that
queen
:
she
had
a
special
hatred
for
*NL*
this
prisoner
,
and
she
had
_
invented
_
all
those
funerals
herself
,
*NL*
to
scorch
his
heart
with
;
and
the
sublimest
stroke
of
genius
of
*NL*
the
whole
thing
was
leaving
the
family-invoice
a
funeral
_
short
_
,
*NL*
so
as
to
let
him
wear
his
poor
old
soul
out
guessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
me
,
he
never
would
have
got
out
.
Morgan
le
Fay
hated
him
*NL*
with
her
whole
heart
,
and
she
never
would
have
softened
toward
him
.
*NL*
And
yet
his
crime
was
committed
more
in
thoughtlessness
than
*NL*
deliberate
depravity
.
He
had
said
she
had
red
hair
.
Well
,
she
*NL*
had
;
but
that
was
no
way
to
speak
of
it
.
When
red-headed
people
*NL*
are
above
a
certain
social
grade
their
hair
is
auburn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consider
it
:
among
these
forty-seven
captives
there
were
five
*NL*
whose
names
,
offenses
,
and
dates
of
incarceration
were
no
longer
*NL*
known
!
One
woman
and
four
men
--
all
bent
,
and
wrinkled
,
and
*NL*
mind-extinguished
patriarchs
.
They
themselves
had
long
ago
forgotten
*NL*
these
details
;
at
any
rate
they
had
mere
vague
theories
about
them
,
*NL*
nothing
definite
and
nothing
that
they
repeated
twice
in
the
same
*NL*
way
.
The
succession
of
priests
whose
office
it
had
been
to
pray
*NL*
daily
with
the
captives
and
remind
them
that
God
had
put
them
*NL*
there
,
for
some
wise
purpose
or
other
,
and
teach
them
that
patience
,
*NL*
humbleness
,
and
submission
to
oppression
was
what
He
loved
to
see
*NL*
in
parties
of
a
subordinate
rank
,
had
traditions
about
these
poor
*NL*
old
human
ruins
,
but
nothing
more
.
These
traditions
went
but
*NL*
little
way
,
for
they
concerned
the
length
of
the
incarceration
only
,
*NL*
and
not
the
names
of
the
offenses
.
And
even
by
the
help
of
*NL*
tradition
the
only
thing
that
could
be
proven
was
that
none
of
*NL*
the
five
had
seen
daylight
for
thirty-five
years
:
how
much
longer
*NL*
this
privation
has
lasted
was
not
guessable
.
The
king
and
the
queen
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
these
poor
creatures
,
except
that
they
were
*NL*
heirlooms
,
assets
inherited
,
along
with
the
throne
,
from
the
former
*NL*
firm
.
Nothing
of
their
history
had
been
transmitted
with
their
*NL*
persons
,
and
so
the
inheriting
owners
had
considered
them
of
no
*NL*
value
,
and
had
felt
no
interest
in
them
.
I
said
to
the
queen
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
in
the
world
did
n't
you
set
them
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
a
puzzler
.
She
did
n't
know
_
why
_
she
had
n't
,
the
*NL*
thing
had
never
come
up
in
her
mind
.
So
here
she
was
,
forecasting
*NL*
the
veritable
history
of
future
prisoners
of
the
Castle
d'If
,
*NL*
without
knowing
it
.
It
seemed
plain
to
me
now
,
that
with
her
*NL*
training
,
those
inherited
prisoners
were
merely
property
--
nothing
*NL*
more
,
nothing
less
.
Well
,
when
we
inherit
property
,
it
does
not
*NL*
occur
to
us
to
throw
it
away
,
even
when
we
do
not
value
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
brought
my
procession
of
human
bats
up
into
the
open
world
*NL*
and
the
glare
of
the
afternoon
sun
--
previously
blindfolding
them
,
*NL*
in
charity
for
eyes
so
long
untortured
by
light
--
they
were
a
*NL*
spectacle
to
look
at
.
Skeletons
,
scarecrows
,
goblins
,
pathetic
*NL*
frights
,
every
one
;
legitimatest
possible
children
of
Monarchy
*NL*
by
the
Grace
of
God
and
the
Established
Church
.
I
muttered
absently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
wish
_
I
could
photograph
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
seen
that
kind
of
people
who
will
never
let
on
that
they
*NL*
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
a
new
big
word
.
The
more
ignorant
they
*NL*
are
,
the
more
pitifully
certain
they
are
to
pretend
you
have
n't
*NL*
shot
over
their
heads
.
The
queen
was
just
one
of
that
sort
,
and
*NL*
was
always
making
the
stupidest
blunders
by
reason
of
it
.
She
*NL*
hesitated
a
moment
;
then
her
face
brightened
up
with
sudden
*NL*
comprehension
,
and
she
said
she
would
do
it
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
to
myself
:
She
?
why
what
can
she
know
about
photography
?
*NL*
But
it
was
a
poor
time
to
be
thinking
.
When
I
looked
around
,
she
*NL*
was
moving
on
the
procession
with
an
axe
!
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
certainly
was
a
curious
one
,
was
Morgan
le
Fay
.
I
have
*NL*
seen
a
good
many
kinds
of
women
in
my
time
,
but
she
laid
over
them
*NL*
all
for
variety
.
And
how
sharply
characteristic
of
her
this
episode
*NL*
was
.
She
had
no
more
idea
than
a
horse
of
how
to
photograph
*NL*
a
procession
;
but
being
in
doubt
,
it
was
just
like
her
to
try
*NL*
to
do
it
with
an
axe
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
KNIGHT-ERRANTRY
AS
A
TRADE
*NL*
*NL*
Sandy
and
I
were
on
the
road
again
,
next
morning
,
bright
and
early
.
*NL*
It
was
so
good
to
open
up
one
's
lungs
and
take
in
whole
luscious
*NL*
barrels-ful
of
the
blessed
God
's
untainted
,
dew-fashioned
,
*NL*
woodland-scented
air
once
more
,
after
suffocating
body
and
mind
for
two
*NL*
days
and
nights
in
the
moral
and
physical
stenches
of
that
intolerable
*NL*
old
buzzard-roost
!
I
mean
,
for
me
:
of
course
the
place
was
all
*NL*
right
and
agreeable
enough
for
Sandy
,
for
she
had
been
used
to
*NL*
high
life
all
her
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
girl
,
her
jaws
had
had
a
wearisome
rest
now
for
a
while
,
*NL*
and
I
was
expecting
to
get
the
consequences
.
I
was
right
;
but
she
*NL*
had
stood
by
me
most
helpfully
in
the
castle
,
and
had
mightily
*NL*
supported
and
reinforced
me
with
gigantic
foolishnesses
which
were
*NL*
worth
more
for
the
occasion
than
wisdoms
double
their
size
;
so
*NL*
I
thought
she
had
earned
a
right
to
work
her
mill
for
a
while
,
*NL*
if
she
wanted
to
,
and
I
felt
not
a
pang
when
she
started
it
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
turn
we
unto
Sir
Marhaus
that
rode
with
the
damsel
of
thirty
*NL*
winter
of
age
southward
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
see
if
you
can
work
up
another
half-stretch
on
*NL*
the
trail
of
the
cowboys
,
Sandy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
fair
my
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
ahead
,
then
.
I
wo
n't
interrupt
this
time
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
*NL*
Begin
over
again
;
start
fair
,
and
shake
out
all
your
reefs
,
and
*NL*
I
will
load
my
pipe
and
give
good
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
turn
we
unto
Sir
Marhaus
that
rode
with
the
damsel
of
thirty
*NL*
winter
of
age
southward
.
And
so
they
came
into
a
deep
forest
,
*NL*
and
by
fortune
they
were
nighted
,
and
rode
along
in
a
deep
way
,
*NL*
and
at
the
last
they
came
into
a
courtelage
where
abode
the
duke
*NL*
of
South
Marches
,
and
there
they
asked
harbour
.
And
on
the
morn
*NL*
the
duke
sent
unto
Sir
Marhaus
,
and
bad
him
make
him
ready
.
And
*NL*
so
Sir
Marhaus
arose
and
armed
him
,
and
there
was
a
mass
sung
*NL*
afore
him
,
and
he
brake
his
fast
,
and
so
mounted
on
horseback
in
*NL*
the
court
of
the
castle
,
there
they
should
do
the
battle
.
So
there
*NL*
was
the
duke
already
on
horseback
,
clean
armed
,
and
his
six
sons
*NL*
by
him
,
and
every
each
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
,
and
so
they
*NL*
encountered
,
whereas
the
duke
and
his
two
sons
brake
their
spears
*NL*
upon
him
,
but
Sir
Marhaus
held
up
his
spear
and
touched
none
of
*NL*
them
.
Then
came
the
four
sons
by
couples
,
and
two
of
them
brake
*NL*
their
spears
,
and
so
did
the
other
two
.
And
all
this
while
*NL*
Sir
Marhaus
touched
them
not
.
Then
Sir
Marhaus
ran
to
the
duke
,
*NL*
and
smote
him
with
his
spear
that
horse
and
man
fell
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
And
so
he
served
his
sons
.
And
then
Sir
Marhaus
alight
down
,
and
*NL*
bad
the
duke
yield
him
or
else
he
would
slay
him
.
And
then
some
*NL*
of
his
sons
recovered
,
and
would
have
set
upon
Sir
Marhaus
.
Then
*NL*
Sir
Marhaus
said
to
the
duke
,
Cease
thy
sons
,
or
else
I
will
do
*NL*
the
uttermost
to
you
all
.
When
the
duke
saw
he
might
not
escape
*NL*
the
death
,
he
cried
to
his
sons
,
and
charged
them
to
yield
them
*NL*
to
Sir
Marhaus
.
And
they
kneeled
all
down
and
put
the
pommels
*NL*
of
their
swords
to
the
knight
,
and
so
he
received
them
.
And
then
*NL*
they
holp
up
their
father
,
and
so
by
their
common
assent
promised
*NL*
unto
Sir
Marhaus
never
to
be
foes
unto
King
Arthur
,
and
thereupon
*NL*
at
Whitsuntide
after
,
to
come
he
and
his
sons
,
and
put
them
in
*NL*
the
king
's
grace
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
OGRE
'S
CASTLE
*NL*
*NL*
Between
six
and
nine
we
made
ten
miles
,
which
was
plenty
for
a
*NL*
horse
carrying
triple
--
man
,
woman
,
and
armor
;
then
we
stopped
*NL*
for
a
long
nooning
under
some
trees
by
a
limpid
brook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
so
came
by
and
by
a
knight
riding
;
and
as
he
drew
near
he
*NL*
made
dolorous
moan
,
and
by
the
words
of
it
I
perceived
that
he
*NL*
was
cursing
and
swearing
;
yet
nevertheless
was
I
glad
of
his
*NL*
coming
,
for
that
I
saw
he
bore
a
bulletin-board
whereon
in
letters
*NL*
all
of
shining
gold
was
writ
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
USE
PETERSON
'S
PROPHYLACTIC
TOOTH-BRUSH
--
ALL
THE
GO
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
glad
of
his
coming
,
for
even
by
this
token
I
knew
him
for
*NL*
knight
of
mine
.
It
was
Sir
Madok
de
la
Montaine
,
a
burly
great
*NL*
fellow
whose
chief
distinction
was
that
he
had
come
within
an
ace
*NL*
of
sending
Sir
Launcelot
down
over
his
horse-tail
once
.
He
was
*NL*
never
long
in
a
stranger
's
presence
without
finding
some
pretext
*NL*
or
other
to
let
out
that
great
fact
.
But
there
was
another
fact
*NL*
of
nearly
the
same
size
,
which
he
never
pushed
upon
anybody
unasked
,
*NL*
and
yet
never
withheld
when
asked
:
that
was
,
that
the
reason
he
*NL*
did
n't
quite
succeed
was
,
that
he
was
interrupted
and
sent
down
*NL*
over
horse-tail
himself
.
This
innocent
vast
lubber
did
not
see
*NL*
any
particular
difference
between
the
two
facts
.
I
liked
him
,
*NL*
for
he
was
earnest
in
his
work
,
and
very
valuable
.
And
he
was
so
*NL*
fine
to
look
at
,
with
his
broad
mailed
shoulders
,
and
the
grand
*NL*
leonine
set
of
his
plumed
head
,
and
his
big
shield
with
its
quaint
*NL*
device
of
a
gauntleted
hand
clutching
a
prophylactic
tooth-brush
,
*NL*
with
motto
:
``
Try
Noyoudont
.
''
This
was
a
tooth-wash
that
I
was
*NL*
introducing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aweary
,
he
said
,
and
indeed
he
looked
it
;
but
he
would
not
*NL*
alight
.
He
said
he
was
after
the
stove-polish
man
;
and
with
this
*NL*
he
broke
out
cursing
and
swearing
anew
.
The
bulletin-boarder
*NL*
referred
to
was
Sir
Ossaise
of
Surluse
,
a
brave
knight
,
and
of
*NL*
considerable
celebrity
on
account
of
his
having
tried
conclusions
*NL*
in
a
tournament
once
,
with
no
less
a
Mogul
than
Sir
Gaheris
*NL*
himself
--
although
not
successfully
.
He
was
of
a
light
and
laughing
*NL*
disposition
,
and
to
him
nothing
in
this
world
was
serious
.
It
was
*NL*
for
this
reason
that
I
had
chosen
him
to
work
up
a
stove-polish
*NL*
sentiment
.
There
were
no
stoves
yet
,
and
so
there
could
be
nothing
*NL*
serious
about
stove-polish
.
All
that
the
agent
needed
to
do
was
*NL*
to
deftly
and
by
degrees
prepare
the
public
for
the
great
change
,
*NL*
and
have
them
established
in
predilections
toward
neatness
against
*NL*
the
time
when
the
stove
should
appear
upon
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Madok
was
very
bitter
,
and
brake
out
anew
with
cursings
.
He
*NL*
said
he
had
cursed
his
soul
to
rags
;
and
yet
he
would
not
get
down
*NL*
from
his
horse
,
neither
would
he
take
any
rest
,
or
listen
to
any
*NL*
comfort
,
until
he
should
have
found
Sir
Ossaise
and
settled
this
*NL*
account
.
It
appeared
,
by
what
I
could
piece
together
of
the
*NL*
unprofane
fragments
of
his
statement
,
that
he
had
chanced
upon
*NL*
Sir
Ossaise
at
dawn
of
the
morning
,
and
been
told
that
if
he
would
*NL*
make
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
and
swamps
and
broken
hills
and
*NL*
glades
,
he
could
head
off
a
company
of
travelers
who
would
be
rare
*NL*
customers
for
prophylactics
and
tooth-wash
.
With
characteristic
*NL*
zeal
Sir
Madok
had
plunged
away
at
once
upon
this
quest
,
and
after
*NL*
three
hours
of
awful
crosslot
riding
had
overhauled
his
game
.
And
*NL*
behold
,
it
was
the
five
patriarchs
that
had
been
released
from
the
*NL*
dungeons
the
evening
before
!
Poor
old
creatures
,
it
was
all
of
*NL*
twenty
years
since
any
one
of
them
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
*NL*
equipped
with
any
remaining
snag
or
remnant
of
a
tooth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blank-blank-blank
him
,
''
said
Sir
Madok
,
``
an
I
do
not
stove-polish
*NL*
him
an
I
may
find
him
,
leave
it
to
me
;
for
never
no
knight
that
*NL*
hight
Ossaise
or
aught
else
may
do
me
this
disservice
and
bide
*NL*
on
live
,
an
I
may
find
him
,
the
which
I
have
thereunto
sworn
a
*NL*
great
oath
this
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
these
words
and
others
,
he
lightly
took
his
spear
and
*NL*
gat
him
thence
.
In
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
came
upon
one
*NL*
of
those
very
patriarchs
ourselves
,
in
the
edge
of
a
poor
village
.
*NL*
He
was
basking
in
the
love
of
relatives
and
friends
whom
he
had
not
*NL*
seen
for
fifty
years
;
and
about
him
and
caressing
him
were
also
*NL*
descendants
of
his
own
body
whom
he
had
never
seen
at
all
till
now
;
*NL*
but
to
him
these
were
all
strangers
,
his
memory
was
gone
,
his
mind
*NL*
was
stagnant
.
It
seemed
incredible
that
a
man
could
outlast
half
*NL*
a
century
shut
up
in
a
dark
hole
like
a
rat
,
but
here
were
his
old
*NL*
wife
and
some
old
comrades
to
testify
to
it
.
They
could
remember
*NL*
him
as
he
was
in
the
freshness
and
strength
of
his
young
manhood
,
*NL*
when
he
kissed
his
child
and
delivered
it
to
its
mother
's
hands
*NL*
and
went
away
into
that
long
oblivion
.
The
people
at
the
castle
*NL*
could
not
tell
within
half
a
generation
the
length
of
time
the
man
*NL*
had
been
shut
up
there
for
his
unrecorded
and
forgotten
offense
;
*NL*
but
this
old
wife
knew
;
and
so
did
her
old
child
,
who
stood
there
*NL*
among
her
married
sons
and
daughters
trying
to
realize
a
father
*NL*
who
had
been
to
her
a
name
,
a
thought
,
a
formless
image
,
a
tradition
,
*NL*
all
her
life
,
and
now
was
suddenly
concreted
into
actual
flesh
*NL*
and
blood
and
set
before
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
curious
situation
;
yet
it
is
not
on
that
account
that
*NL*
I
have
made
room
for
it
here
,
but
on
account
of
a
thing
which
*NL*
seemed
to
me
still
more
curious
.
To
wit
,
that
this
dreadful
matter
*NL*
brought
from
these
downtrodden
people
no
outburst
of
rage
against
*NL*
these
oppressors
.
They
had
been
heritors
and
subjects
of
cruelty
*NL*
and
outrage
so
long
that
nothing
could
have
startled
them
but
*NL*
a
kindness
.
Yes
,
here
was
a
curious
revelation
,
indeed
,
of
the
*NL*
depth
to
which
this
people
had
been
sunk
in
slavery
.
Their
entire
*NL*
being
was
reduced
to
a
monotonous
dead
level
of
patience
,
resignation
,
*NL*
dumb
uncomplaining
acceptance
of
whatever
might
befall
them
in
*NL*
this
life
.
Their
very
imagination
was
dead
.
When
you
can
say
*NL*
that
of
a
man
,
he
has
struck
bottom
,
I
reckon
;
there
is
no
lower
*NL*
deep
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rather
wished
I
had
gone
some
other
road
.
This
was
not
the
sort
*NL*
of
experience
for
a
statesman
to
encounter
who
was
planning
out
*NL*
a
peaceful
revolution
in
his
mind
.
For
it
could
not
help
bringing
*NL*
up
the
unget-aroundable
fact
that
,
all
gentle
cant
and
philosophizing
*NL*
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
,
no
people
in
the
world
ever
did
*NL*
achieve
their
freedom
by
goody-goody
talk
and
moral
suasion
:
*NL*
it
being
immutable
law
that
all
revolutions
that
will
succeed
must
*NL*
_
begin
_
in
blood
,
whatever
may
answer
afterward
.
If
history
teaches
*NL*
anything
,
it
teaches
that
.
What
this
folk
needed
,
then
,
was
a
*NL*
Reign
of
Terror
and
a
guillotine
,
and
I
was
the
wrong
man
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
toward
noon
,
Sandy
began
to
show
signs
of
excitement
*NL*
and
feverish
expectancy
.
She
said
we
were
approaching
the
ogre
's
*NL*
castle
.
I
was
surprised
into
an
uncomfortable
shock
.
The
object
*NL*
of
our
quest
had
gradually
dropped
out
of
my
mind
;
this
sudden
*NL*
resurrection
of
it
made
it
seem
quite
a
real
and
startling
thing
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
roused
up
in
me
a
smart
interest
.
Sandy
's
*NL*
excitement
increased
every
moment
;
and
so
did
mine
,
for
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
is
catching
.
My
heart
got
to
thumping
.
You
ca
n't
reason
*NL*
with
your
heart
;
it
has
its
own
laws
,
and
thumps
about
things
which
*NL*
the
intellect
scorns
.
Presently
,
when
Sandy
slid
from
the
horse
,
*NL*
motioned
me
to
stop
,
and
went
creeping
stealthily
,
with
her
head
*NL*
bent
nearly
to
her
knees
,
toward
a
row
of
bushes
that
bordered
*NL*
a
declivity
,
the
thumpings
grew
stronger
and
quicker
.
And
they
*NL*
kept
it
up
while
she
was
gaining
her
ambush
and
getting
her
glimpse
*NL*
over
the
declivity
;
and
also
while
I
was
creeping
to
her
side
on
*NL*
my
knees
.
Her
eyes
were
burning
now
,
as
she
pointed
with
her
*NL*
finger
,
and
said
in
a
panting
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
castle
!
The
castle
!
Lo
,
where
it
looms
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
welcome
disappointment
I
experienced
!
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Castle
?
It
is
nothing
but
a
pigsty
;
a
pigsty
with
a
wattled
*NL*
fence
around
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
surprised
and
distressed
.
The
animation
faded
out
of
*NL*
her
face
;
and
during
many
moments
she
was
lost
in
thought
and
*NL*
silent
.
Then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
enchanted
aforetime
,
''
she
said
in
a
musing
fashion
,
*NL*
as
if
to
herself
.
``
And
how
strange
is
this
marvel
,
and
how
awful
*NL*
--
that
to
the
one
perception
it
is
enchanted
and
dight
in
a
base
*NL*
and
shameful
aspect
;
yet
to
the
perception
of
the
other
it
is
not
*NL*
enchanted
,
hath
suffered
no
change
,
but
stands
firm
and
stately
*NL*
still
,
girt
with
its
moat
and
waving
its
banners
in
the
blue
air
*NL*
from
its
towers
.
And
God
shield
us
,
how
it
pricks
the
heart
to
*NL*
see
again
these
gracious
captives
,
and
the
sorrow
deepened
in
their
*NL*
sweet
faces
!
We
have
tarried
along
,
and
are
to
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
my
cue
.
The
castle
was
enchanted
to
_
me
_
,
not
to
her
.
It
would
*NL*
be
wasted
time
to
try
to
argue
her
out
of
her
delusion
,
it
could
n't
*NL*
be
done
;
I
must
just
humor
it
.
So
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
common
case
--
the
enchanting
of
a
thing
to
one
eye
and
*NL*
leaving
it
in
its
proper
form
to
another
.
You
have
heard
of
it
*NL*
before
,
Sandy
,
though
you
have
n't
happened
to
experience
it
.
*NL*
But
no
harm
is
done
.
In
fact
,
it
is
lucky
the
way
it
is
.
If
these
*NL*
ladies
were
hogs
to
everybody
and
to
themselves
,
it
would
be
*NL*
necessary
to
break
the
enchantment
,
and
that
might
be
impossible
*NL*
if
one
failed
to
find
out
the
particular
process
of
the
enchantment
.
*NL*
And
hazardous
,
too
;
for
in
attempting
a
disenchantment
without
the
*NL*
true
key
,
you
are
liable
to
err
,
and
turn
your
hogs
into
dogs
,
*NL*
and
the
dogs
into
cats
,
the
cats
into
rats
,
and
so
on
,
and
end
by
*NL*
reducing
your
materials
to
nothing
finally
,
or
to
an
odorless
gas
*NL*
which
you
ca
n't
follow
--
which
,
of
course
,
amounts
to
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
But
here
,
by
good
luck
,
no
one
's
eyes
but
mine
are
under
*NL*
the
enchantment
,
and
so
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
dissolve
it
.
*NL*
These
ladies
remain
ladies
to
you
,
and
to
themselves
,
and
to
*NL*
everybody
else
;
and
at
the
same
time
they
will
suffer
in
no
way
*NL*
from
my
delusion
,
for
when
I
know
that
an
ostensible
hog
is
a
*NL*
lady
,
that
is
enough
for
me
,
I
know
how
to
treat
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
oh
,
sweet
my
lord
,
thou
talkest
like
an
angel
.
And
I
know
*NL*
that
thou
wilt
deliver
them
,
for
that
thou
art
minded
to
great
*NL*
deeds
and
art
as
strong
a
knight
of
your
hands
and
as
brave
to
will
*NL*
and
to
do
,
as
any
that
is
on
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
leave
a
princess
in
the
sty
,
Sandy
.
Are
those
three
*NL*
yonder
that
to
my
disordered
eyes
are
starveling
swine-herds
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ogres
,
Are
_
they
_
changed
also
?
It
is
most
wonderful
.
Now
*NL*
am
I
fearful
;
for
how
canst
thou
strike
with
sure
aim
when
five
of
*NL*
their
nine
cubits
of
stature
are
to
thee
invisible
?
Ah
,
go
warily
,
*NL*
fair
sir
;
this
is
a
mightier
emprise
than
I
wend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
be
easy
,
Sandy
.
All
I
need
to
know
is
,
how
_
much
_
of
an
ogre
*NL*
is
invisible
;
then
I
know
how
to
locate
his
vitals
.
Do
n't
you
be
*NL*
afraid
,
I
will
make
short
work
of
these
bunco-steerers
.
Stay
*NL*
where
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
left
Sandy
kneeling
there
,
corpse-faced
but
plucky
and
hopeful
,
*NL*
and
rode
down
to
the
pigsty
,
and
struck
up
a
trade
with
the
*NL*
swine-herds
.
I
won
their
gratitude
by
buying
out
all
the
hogs
*NL*
at
the
lump
sum
of
sixteen
pennies
,
which
was
rather
above
latest
*NL*
quotations
.
I
was
just
in
time
;
for
the
Church
,
the
lord
of
the
*NL*
manor
,
and
the
rest
of
the
tax-gatherers
would
have
been
along
*NL*
next
day
and
swept
off
pretty
much
all
the
stock
,
leaving
the
*NL*
swine-herds
very
short
of
hogs
and
Sandy
out
of
princesses
.
But
*NL*
now
the
tax
people
could
be
paid
in
cash
,
and
there
would
be
*NL*
a
stake
left
besides
.
One
of
the
men
had
ten
children
;
and
he
*NL*
said
that
last
year
when
a
priest
came
and
of
his
ten
pigs
took
*NL*
the
fattest
one
for
tithes
,
the
wife
burst
out
upon
him
,
and
offered
*NL*
him
a
child
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
beast
without
bowels
of
mercy
,
why
leave
me
my
child
,
yet
*NL*
rob
me
of
the
wherewithal
to
feed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
curious
.
The
same
thing
had
happened
in
the
Wales
of
my
day
,
*NL*
under
this
same
old
Established
Church
,
which
was
supposed
by
many
*NL*
to
have
changed
its
nature
when
it
changed
its
disguise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sent
the
three
men
away
,
and
then
opened
the
sty
gate
and
beckoned
*NL*
Sandy
to
come
--
which
she
did
;
and
not
leisurely
,
but
with
the
rush
*NL*
of
a
prairie
fire
.
And
when
I
saw
her
fling
herself
upon
those
*NL*
hogs
,
with
tears
of
joy
running
down
her
cheeks
,
and
strain
them
*NL*
to
her
heart
,
and
kiss
them
,
and
caress
them
,
and
call
them
*NL*
reverently
by
grand
princely
names
,
I
was
ashamed
of
her
,
ashamed
*NL*
of
the
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
to
drive
those
hogs
home
--
ten
miles
;
and
no
ladies
were
*NL*
ever
more
fickle-minded
or
contrary
.
They
would
stay
in
no
road
,
*NL*
no
path
;
they
broke
out
through
the
brush
on
all
sides
,
and
flowed
*NL*
away
in
all
directions
,
over
rocks
,
and
hills
,
and
the
roughest
*NL*
places
they
could
find
.
And
they
must
not
be
struck
,
or
roughly
*NL*
accosted
;
Sandy
could
not
bear
to
see
them
treated
in
ways
unbecoming
*NL*
their
rank
.
The
troublesomest
old
sow
of
the
lot
had
to
be
called
*NL*
my
Lady
,
and
your
Highness
,
like
the
rest
.
It
is
annoying
and
*NL*
difficult
to
scour
around
after
hogs
,
in
armor
.
There
was
one
*NL*
small
countess
,
with
an
iron
ring
in
her
snout
and
hardly
any
hair
*NL*
on
her
back
,
that
was
the
devil
for
perversity
.
She
gave
me
a
race
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
over
all
sorts
of
country
,
and
then
we
were
right
where
*NL*
we
had
started
from
,
having
made
not
a
rod
of
real
progress
.
*NL*
I
seized
her
at
last
by
the
tail
,
and
brought
her
along
squealing
.
*NL*
When
I
overtook
Sandy
she
was
horrified
,
and
said
it
was
in
the
*NL*
last
degree
indelicate
to
drag
a
countess
by
her
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
got
the
hogs
home
just
at
dark
--
most
of
them
.
The
princess
*NL*
Nerovens
de
Morganore
was
missing
,
and
two
of
her
ladies
in
waiting
:
*NL*
namely
,
Miss
Angela
Bohun
,
and
the
Demoiselle
Elaine
Courtemains
,
*NL*
the
former
of
these
two
being
a
young
black
sow
with
a
white
star
*NL*
in
her
forehead
,
and
the
latter
a
brown
one
with
thin
legs
and
a
*NL*
slight
limp
in
the
forward
shank
on
the
starboard
side
--
a
couple
*NL*
of
the
tryingest
blisters
to
drive
that
I
ever
saw
.
Also
among
*NL*
the
missing
were
several
mere
baronesses
--
and
I
wanted
them
to
*NL*
stay
missing
;
but
no
,
all
that
sausage-meat
had
to
be
found
;
so
*NL*
servants
were
sent
out
with
torches
to
scour
the
woods
and
hills
*NL*
to
that
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
the
whole
drove
was
housed
in
the
house
,
and
,
great
*NL*
guns
!
--
well
,
I
never
saw
anything
like
it
.
Nor
ever
heard
anything
*NL*
like
it
.
And
never
smelt
anything
like
it
.
It
was
like
an
*NL*
insurrection
in
a
gasometer
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
PILGRIMS
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
did
get
to
bed
at
last
I
was
unspeakably
tired
;
the
stretching
*NL*
out
,
and
the
relaxing
of
the
long-tense
muscles
,
how
luxurious
,
*NL*
how
delicious
!
but
that
was
as
far
as
I
could
get
--
sleep
was
out
of
*NL*
the
question
for
the
present
.
The
ripping
and
tearing
and
squealing
*NL*
of
the
nobility
up
and
down
the
halls
and
corridors
was
pandemonium
*NL*
come
again
,
and
kept
me
broad
awake
.
Being
awake
,
my
thoughts
*NL*
were
busy
,
of
course
;
and
mainly
they
busied
themselves
with
Sandy
's
*NL*
curious
delusion
.
Here
she
was
,
as
sane
a
person
as
the
kingdom
*NL*
could
produce
;
and
yet
,
from
my
point
of
view
she
was
acting
like
*NL*
a
crazy
woman
.
My
land
,
the
power
of
training
!
of
influence
!
*NL*
of
education
!
It
can
bring
a
body
up
to
believe
anything
.
I
had
*NL*
to
put
myself
in
Sandy
's
place
to
realize
that
she
was
not
a
*NL*
lunatic
.
Yes
,
and
put
her
in
mine
,
to
demonstrate
how
easy
it
is
*NL*
to
seem
a
lunatic
to
a
person
who
has
not
been
taught
as
you
have
*NL*
been
taught
.
If
I
had
told
Sandy
I
had
seen
a
wagon
,
uninfluenced
*NL*
by
enchantment
,
spin
along
fifty
miles
an
hour
;
had
seen
a
man
,
*NL*
unequipped
with
magic
powers
,
get
into
a
basket
and
soar
out
of
*NL*
sight
among
the
clouds
;
and
had
listened
,
without
any
necromancer
's
*NL*
help
,
to
the
conversation
of
a
person
who
was
several
hundred
miles
*NL*
away
,
Sandy
would
not
merely
have
supposed
me
to
be
crazy
,
she
*NL*
would
have
thought
she
knew
it
.
Everybody
around
her
believed
in
*NL*
enchantments
;
nobody
had
any
doubts
;
to
doubt
that
a
castle
could
*NL*
be
turned
into
a
sty
,
and
its
occupants
into
hogs
,
would
have
been
*NL*
the
same
as
my
doubting
among
Connecticut
people
the
actuality
*NL*
of
the
telephone
and
its
wonders
,
--
and
in
both
cases
would
be
*NL*
absolute
proof
of
a
diseased
mind
,
an
unsettled
reason
.
Yes
,
Sandy
*NL*
was
sane
;
that
must
be
admitted
.
If
I
also
would
be
sane
--
to
Sandy
*NL*
--
I
must
keep
my
superstitions
about
unenchanted
and
unmiraculous
*NL*
locomotives
,
balloons
,
and
telephones
,
to
myself
.
Also
,
I
believed
*NL*
that
the
world
was
not
flat
,
and
had
n't
pillars
under
it
to
support
*NL*
it
,
nor
a
canopy
over
it
to
turn
off
a
universe
of
water
that
*NL*
occupied
all
space
above
;
but
as
I
was
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
*NL*
afflicted
with
such
impious
and
criminal
opinions
,
I
recognized
*NL*
that
it
would
be
good
wisdom
to
keep
quiet
about
this
matter
,
too
,
*NL*
if
I
did
not
wish
to
be
suddenly
shunned
and
forsaken
by
everybody
*NL*
as
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Sandy
assembled
the
swine
in
the
dining-room
and
*NL*
gave
them
their
breakfast
,
waiting
upon
them
personally
and
*NL*
manifesting
in
every
way
the
deep
reverence
which
the
natives
of
*NL*
her
island
,
ancient
and
modern
,
have
always
felt
for
rank
,
let
its
*NL*
outward
casket
and
the
mental
and
moral
contents
be
what
they
may
.
*NL*
I
could
have
eaten
with
the
hogs
if
I
had
had
birth
approaching
my
*NL*
lofty
official
rank
;
but
I
had
n't
,
and
so
accepted
the
unavoidable
*NL*
slight
and
made
no
complaint
.
Sandy
and
I
had
our
breakfast
at
*NL*
the
second
table
.
The
family
were
not
at
home
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
are
in
the
family
,
Sandy
,
and
where
do
they
keep
themselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
family
,
good
my
lord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
family
;
your
own
family
.

this

extraordinary

full
of

Her

filled
with
a

thou
troublest

the

more

*NL*
To

sharp
's
the

Even

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
lightning
from
a
clear
sky
,
for
unexpectedness
;
and
the
*NL*
relief
of
it
was
like
pardon
to
a
prisoner
.
She
would
remain
to
*NL*
deliver
the
goods
,
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then
,
Sandy
,
as
our
enterprise

successfully
*NL*
ended

I
will

and
if
ever
another

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
also

I

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
recalling
the
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
You
will
go
with
me

Why

*NL*
*NL*

I

not

*NL*
I
were

blame

thought
that
that
might
ever
hap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elected
for
the
long
term
,
''
I
sighed
to
myself
.
``
I
may
as
well
*NL*
make
the
best
of
it
.
''
So
then
I
spoke
up
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
let
us
make
a
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
gone
to
cry
her
farewells
over
the
pork
,
I
gave
that
*NL*
whole
peerage
away
to
the
servants
.
And
I
asked
them
to
take
*NL*
a
duster
and
dust
around
a
little
where
the
nobilities
had
mainly
*NL*
lodged
and
promenaded
;
but
they
considered
that
that
would
be
*NL*
hardly
worth
while
,
and
would
moreover
be
a
rather
grave
departure
*NL*
from
custom
,
and
therefore
likely
to
make
talk
.
A
departure
from
*NL*
custom
--
that
settled
it
;
it
was
a
nation
capable
of
committing
any
*NL*
crime
but
that
.
The
servants
said
they
would
follow
the
fashion
,
*NL*
a
fashion
grown
sacred
through
immemorial
observance
;
they
would
*NL*
scatter
fresh
rushes
in
all
the
rooms
and
halls
,
and
then
the
*NL*
evidence
of
the
aristocratic
visitation
would
be
no
longer
visible
.
*NL*
It
was
a
kind
of
satire
on
Nature
:
it
was
the
scientific
method
,
*NL*
the
geologic
method
;
it
deposited
the
history
of
the
family
in
*NL*
a
stratified
record
;
and
the
antiquary
could
dig
through
it
and
*NL*
tell
by
the
remains
of
each
period
what
changes
of
diet
the
family
*NL*
had
introduced
successively
for
a
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
we
struck
that
day
was
a
procession
of
pilgrims
.
*NL*
It
was
not
going
our
way
,
but
we
joined
it
,
nevertheless
;
for
it
*NL*
was
hourly
being
borne
in
upon
me
now
,
that
if
I
would
govern
*NL*
this
country
wisely
,
I
must
be
posted
in
the
details
of
its
life
,
*NL*
and
not
at
second
hand
,
but
by
personal
observation
and
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
company
of
pilgrims
resembled
Chaucer
's
in
this
:
that
it
*NL*
had
in
it
a
sample
of
about
all
the
upper
occupations
and
professions
*NL*
the
country
could
show
,
and
a
corresponding
variety
of
costume
.
*NL*
There
were
young
men
and
old
men
,
young
women
and
old
women
,
*NL*
lively
folk
and
grave
folk
.
They
rode
upon
mules
and
horses
,
and
*NL*
there
was
not
a
side-saddle
in
the
party
;
for
this
specialty
was
*NL*
to
remain
unknown
in
England
for
nine
hundred
years
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pleasant
,
friendly
,
sociable
herd
;
pious
,
happy
,
merry
and
*NL*
full
of
unconscious
coarsenesses
and
innocent
indecencies
.
What
*NL*
they
regarded
as
the
merry
tale
went
the
continual
round
and
caused
*NL*
no
more
embarrassment
than
it
would
have
caused
in
the
best
English
*NL*
society
twelve
centuries
later
.
Practical
jokes
worthy
of
the
*NL*
English
wits
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
far-off
nineteenth
century
*NL*
were
sprung
here
and
there
and
yonder
along
the
line
,
and
compelled
*NL*
the
delightedest
applause
;
and
sometimes
when
a
bright
remark
was
*NL*
made
at
one
end
of
the
procession
and
started
on
its
travels
toward
*NL*
the
other
,
you
could
note
its
progress
all
the
way
by
the
sparkling
*NL*
spray
of
laughter
it
threw
off
from
its
bows
as
it
plowed
along
;
*NL*
and
also
by
the
blushes
of
the
mules
in
its
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sandy
knew
the
goal
and
purpose
of
this
pilgrimage
,
and
she
posted
*NL*
me
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
journey
to
the
Valley
of
Holiness
,
for
to
be
blessed
of
the
*NL*
godly
hermits
and
drink
of
the
miraculous
waters
and
be
cleansed
*NL*
from
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
this
watering
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
lieth
a
two-day
journey
hence
,
by
the
borders
of
the
land
that
*NL*
hight
the
Cuckoo
Kingdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
it
.
Is
it
a
celebrated
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
a
truth
,
yes
.
There
be
none
more
so
.
Of
old
time
there
*NL*
lived
there
an
abbot
and
his
monks
.
Belike
were
none
in
the
world
*NL*
more
holy
than
these
;
for
they
gave
themselves
to
study
of
pious
*NL*
books
,
and
spoke
not
the
one
to
the
other
,
or
indeed
to
any
,
and
*NL*
ate
decayed
herbs
and
naught
thereto
,
and
slept
hard
,
and
prayed
*NL*
much
,
and
washed
never
;
also
they
wore
the
same
garment
until
it
*NL*
fell
from
their
bodies
through
age
and
decay
.
Right
so
came
they
*NL*
to
be
known
of
all
the
world
by
reason
of
these
holy
austerities
,
*NL*
and
visited
by
rich
and
poor
,
and
reverenced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
always
there
was
lack
of
water
there
.
Whereas
,
upon
a
time
,
*NL*
the
holy
abbot
prayed
,
and
for
answer
a
great
stream
of
clear
*NL*
water
burst
forth
by
miracle
in
a
desert
place
.
Now
were
the
*NL*
fickle
monks
tempted
of
the
Fiend
,
and
they
wrought
with
their
*NL*
abbot
unceasingly
by
beggings
and
beseechings
that
he
would
construct
*NL*
a
bath
;
and
when
he
was
become
aweary
and
might
not
resist
more
,
*NL*
he
said
have
ye
your
will
,
then
,
and
granted
that
they
asked
.
*NL*
Now
mark
thou
what
't
is
to
forsake
the
ways
of
purity
the
which
*NL*
He
loveth
,
and
wanton
with
such
as
be
worldly
and
an
offense
.
*NL*
These
monks
did
enter
into
the
bath
and
come
thence
washed
as
*NL*
white
as
snow
;
and
lo
,
in
that
moment
His
sign
appeared
,
in
*NL*
miraculous
rebuke
!
for
His
insulted
waters
ceased
to
flow
,
and
*NL*
utterly
vanished
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
fared
mildly
,
Sandy
,
considering
how
that
kind
of
crime
*NL*
is
regarded
in
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belike
;
but
it
was
their
first
sin
;
and
they
had
been
of
perfect

life
for
long
,
and
differing
in
naught
from
the
angels
.
Prayers
,
*NL*
tears
,
torturings
of
the
flesh
,
all
was
vain
to
beguile
that
water
*NL*
to
flow
again
.
Even
processions
;
even
burnt-offerings
;
even
votive
*NL*
candles
to
the
Virgin
,
did
fail
every
each
of
them

all
in

the
land

marvel

How
odd

And
so
upon
a
time

after
year

day

humble

surrender

destroyed

bath

behold

His
anger
was
in
that

moment
appeased
,

the
waters
gushed
richly
forth
again

flow

``
Even
from

very
day

went
abroad

From

came
monks
to
join
;
they
came
*NL*
even
as
the

come
,
in
shoals
;

the
monastery
added
building

to
building

others
to
these

so
spread
wide
its

took

in

came

also

again

more
;

built
over
against

side

added
building
to

mighty

these
were
friendly

they
joined
their
loving

built

asylum
midway

closed
up

when
he
began
eagerly
and
awkwardly
to
lead
up
,
in
the
*NL*
immemorial
way
,
to
that
same
old
anecdote
--
the
one
Sir
Dinadan
*NL*
told
me
,
what
time
I
got
into
trouble
with
Sir
Sagramor
and
was
*NL*
challenged
of
him
on
account
of
it
.
I
excused
myself
and
dropped
*NL*
to
the
rear
of
the
procession
,
sad
at
heart
,
willing
to
go
hence
*NL*
from
this
troubled
life
,
this
vale
of
tears
,
this
brief
day
of
*NL*
broken
rest
,
of
cloud
and
storm
,
of
weary
struggle
and
monotonous
*NL*
defeat
;
and
yet
shrinking
from
the
change
,
as
remembering
how
long
*NL*
eternity
is
,
and
how
many
have
wended
thither
who
know
that
anecdote
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
afternoon
we
overtook
another
procession
of
pilgrims
;
*NL*
but
in
this
one
was
no
merriment
,
no
jokes
,
no
laughter
,
no
playful
*NL*
ways
,
nor
any
happy
giddiness
,
whether
of
youth
or
age
.
Yet
both
*NL*
were
here
,
both
age
and
youth
;
gray
old
men
and
women
,
strong
men
*NL*
and
women
of
middle
age
,
young
husbands
,
young
wives
,
little
boys
*NL*
and
girls
,
and
three
babies
at
the
breast
.
Even
the
children
were
*NL*
smileless
;
there
was
not
a
face
among
all
these
half
a
hundred
*NL*
people
but
was
cast
down
,
and
bore
that
set
expression
of
hopelessness
*NL*
which
is
bred
of
long
and
hard
trials
and
old
acquaintance
with
*NL*
despair
.
They
were
slaves
.
Chains
led
from
their
fettered
feet
*NL*
and
their
manacled
hands
to
a
sole-leather
belt
about
their
waists
;
*NL*
and
all
except
the
children
were
also
linked
together
in
a
file
*NL*
six
feet
apart
,
by
a
single
chain
which
led
from
collar
to
collar
*NL*
all
down
the
line
.
They
were
on
foot
,
and
had
tramped
three
*NL*
hundred
miles
in
eighteen
days
,
upon
the
cheapest
odds
and
ends
*NL*
of
food
,
and
stingy
rations
of
that
.
They
had
slept
in
these
*NL*
chains
every
night
,
bundled
together
like
swine
.
They
had
upon
*NL*
their
bodies
some
poor
rags
,
but
they
could
not
be
said
to
be
*NL*
clothed
.
Their
irons
had
chafed
the
skin
from
their
ankles
and
*NL*
made
sores
which
were
ulcerated
and
wormy
.
Their
naked
feet
were
*NL*
torn
,
and
none
walked
without
a
limp
.
Originally
there
had
been
a
*NL*
hundred
of
these
unfortunates
,
but
about
half
had
been
sold
on
*NL*
the
trip
.
The
trader
in
charge
of
them
rode
a
horse
and
carried
*NL*
a
whip
with
a
short
handle
and
a
long
heavy
lash
divided
into
*NL*
several
knotted
tails
at
the
end
.
With
this
whip
he
cut
the
*NL*
shoulders
of
any
that
tottered
from
weariness
and
pain
,
and
*NL*
straightened
them
up
.
He
did
not
speak
;
the
whip
conveyed
his
*NL*
desire
without
that
.
None
of
these
poor
creatures
looked
up
as
*NL*
we
rode
along
by
;
they
showed
no
consciousness
of
our
presence
.
*NL*
And
they
made
no
sound
but
one
;
that
was
the
dull
and
awful
clank
*NL*
of
their
chains
from
end
to
end
of
the
long
file
,
as
forty-three
*NL*
burdened
feet
rose
and
fell
in
unison
.
The
file
moved
in
a
cloud
*NL*
of
its
own
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
faces
were
gray
with
a
coating
of
dust
.
One
has
seen
*NL*
the
like
of
this
coating
upon
furniture
in
unoccupied
houses
,
and
*NL*
has
written
his
idle
thought
in
it
with
his
finger
.
I
was
reminded
*NL*
of
this
when
I
noticed
the
faces
of
some
of
those
women
,
young
*NL*
mothers
carrying
babes
that
were
near
to
death
and
freedom
,
how
*NL*
a
something
in
their
hearts
was
written
in
the
dust
upon
their
*NL*
faces
,
plain
to
see
,
and
lord
,
how
plain
to
read
!
for
it
was
the
*NL*
track
of
tears
.
One
of
these
young
mothers
was
but
a
girl
,
and
*NL*
it
hurt
me
to
the
heart
to
read
that
writing
,
and
reflect
that
it
*NL*
was
come
up
out
of
the
breast
of
such
a
child
,
a
breast
that
ought
*NL*
not
to
know
trouble
yet
,
but
only
the
gladness
of
the
morning
of
*NL*
life
;
and
no
doubt
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
reeled
just
then
,
giddy
with
fatigue
,
and
down
came
the
lash
*NL*
and
flicked
a
flake
of
skin
from
her
naked
shoulder
.
It
stung
me
*NL*
as
if
I
had
been
hit
instead
.
The
master
halted
the
file
and
*NL*
jumped
from
his
horse
.
He
stormed
and
swore
at
this
girl
,
and
*NL*
said
she
had
made
annoyance
enough
with
her
laziness
,
and
as
this
*NL*
was
the
last
chance
he
should
have
,
he
would
settle
the
account
now
.
*NL*
She
dropped
on
her
knees
and
put
up
her
hands
and
began
to
beg
,
*NL*
and
cry
,
and
implore
,
in
a
passion
of
terror
,
but
the
master
gave
*NL*
no
attention
.
He
snatched
the
child
from
her
,
and
then
made
the
*NL*
men-slaves
who
were
chained
before
and
behind
her
throw
her
on
*NL*
the
ground
and
hold
her
there
and
expose
her
body
;
and
then
he
*NL*
laid
on
with
his
lash
like
a
madman
till
her
back
was
flayed
,
she
*NL*
shrieking
and
struggling
the
while
piteously
.
One
of
the
men
who
*NL*
was
holding
her
turned
away
his
face
,
and
for
this
humanity
he
was
*NL*
reviled
and
flogged
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
our
pilgrims
looked
on
and
commented
--
on
the
expert
way
in
*NL*
which
the
whip
was
handled
.
They
were
too
much
hardened
by
lifelong
*NL*
everyday
familiarity
with
slavery
to
notice
that
there
was
anything
*NL*
else
in
the
exhibition
that
invited
comment
.
This
was
what
slavery
*NL*
could
do
,
in
the
way
of
ossifying
what
one
may
call
the
superior
*NL*
lobe
of
human
feeling
;
for
these
pilgrims
were
kind-hearted
people
,
*NL*
and
they
would
not
have
allowed
that
man
to
treat
a
horse
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wanted
to
stop
the
whole
thing
and
set
the
slaves
free
,
but
that
*NL*
would
not
do
.
I
must
not
interfere
too
much
and
get
myself
a
name
*NL*
for
riding
over
the
country
's
laws
and
the
citizen
's
rights
*NL*
roughshod
.
If
I
lived
and
prospered
I
would
be
the
death
of
*NL*
slavery
,
that
I
was
resolved
upon
;
but
I
would
try
to
fix
it
so
*NL*
that
when
I
became
its
executioner
it
should
be
by
command
of
*NL*
the
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
here
was
the
wayside
shop
of
a
smith
;
and
now
arrived
a
landed
*NL*
proprietor
who
had
bought
this
girl
a
few
miles
back
,
deliverable
*NL*
here
where
her
irons
could
be
taken
off
.
They
were
removed
;
then
*NL*
there
was
a
squabble
between
the
gentleman
and
the
dealer
as
to
*NL*
which
should
pay
the
blacksmith
.
The
moment
the
girl
was
delivered
*NL*
from
her
irons
,
she
flung
herself
,
all
tears
and
frantic
sobbings
,
*NL*
into
the
arms
of
the
slave
who
had
turned
away
his
face
when
she
*NL*
was
whipped
.
He
strained
her
to
his
breast
,
and
smothered
her
*NL*
face
and
the
child
's
with
kisses
,
and
washed
them
with
the
rain
*NL*
of
his
tears
.
I
suspected
.
I
inquired
.
Yes
,
I
was
right
;
it
was
*NL*
husband
and
wife
.
They
had
to
be
torn
apart
by
force
;
the
girl
*NL*
had
to
be
dragged
away
,
and
she
struggled
and
fought
and
shrieked
*NL*
like
one
gone
mad
till
a
turn
of
the
road
hid
her
from
sight
;
and
*NL*
even
after
that
,
we
could
still
make
out
the
fading
plaint
of
those
*NL*
receding
shrieks
.
And
the
husband
and
father
,
with
his
wife
and
*NL*
child
gone
,
never
to
be
seen
by
him
again
in
life
?
--
well
,
the
look
*NL*
of
him
one
might
not
bear
at
all
,
and
so
I
turned
away
;
but
I
knew
*NL*
I
should
never
get
his
picture
out
of
my
mind
again
,
and
there
*NL*
it
is
to
this
day
,
to
wring
my
heartstrings
whenever
I
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
put
up
at
the
inn
in
a
village
just
at
nightfall
,
and
when
*NL*
I
rose
next
morning
and
looked
abroad
,
I
was
ware
where
a
knight
*NL*
came
riding
in
the
golden
glory
of
the
new
day
,
and
recognized
him
*NL*
for
knight
of
mine
--
Sir
Ozana
le
Cure
Hardy
.
He
was
in
the
*NL*
gentlemen
's
furnishing
line
,
and
his
missionarying
specialty
was
*NL*
plug
hats
.
He
was
clothed
all
in
steel
,
in
the
beautifulest
armor
*NL*
of
the
time
--
up
to
where
his
helmet
ought
to
have
been
;
but
he
*NL*
had
n't
any
helmet
,
he
wore
a
shiny
stove-pipe
hat
,
and
was
ridiculous
*NL*
a
spectacle
as
one
might
want
to
see
.
It
was
another
of
my
*NL*
surreptitious
schemes
for
extinguishing
knighthood
by
making
it
*NL*
grotesque
and
absurd
.
Sir
Ozana
's
saddle
was
hung
about
with
*NL*
leather
hat
boxes
,
and
every
time
he
overcame
a
wandering
knight
*NL*
he
swore
him
into
my
service
and
fitted
him
with
a
plug
and
made
*NL*
him
wear
it
.
I
dressed
and
ran
down
to
welcome
Sir
Ozana
and
*NL*
get
his
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
trade
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
will
note
that
I
have
but
these
four
left
;
yet
were
they
sixteen
*NL*
whenas
I
got
me
from
Camelot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

have
certainly
done
nobly

Sir
Ozana
.
Where
have
you
*NL*
been

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am

now

the
Valley
of
Holiness
,
please
you
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
pointed
for

place
myself

Is

anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the

Give

*NL*
*NL*
``

This
shout
burst
from
*NL*
twenty
pilgrim
mouths
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye

As

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HOLY
FOUNTAIN
*NL*
*NL*
The
pilgrims
were
human
beings
.
Otherwise
they
would
have
acted
*NL*
differently
.
They
had
come
a
long
and
difficult
journey
,
and
now
*NL*
when
the
journey
was
nearly
finished
,
and
they
learned
that
the
main
*NL*
thing
they
had
come
for
had
ceased
to
exist
,
they
did
n't
do
as
*NL*
horses
or
cats
or
angle-worms
would
probably
have
done
--
turn
back
*NL*
and
get
at
something
profitable
--
no
,
anxious
as
they
had
before
*NL*
been
to
see
the
miraculous
fountain
,
they
were
as
much
as
forty
*NL*
times
as
anxious
now
to
see
the
place
where
it
had
used
to
be
.
*NL*
There
is
no
accounting
for
human
beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
good
time
;
and
a
couple
of
hours
before
sunset
we
stood
*NL*
upon
the
high
confines
of
the
Valley
of
Holiness
,
and
our
eyes
*NL*
swept
it
from
end
to
end
and
noted
its
features
.
That
is
,
its
*NL*
large
features
.
These
were
the
three
masses
of
buildings
.
They
*NL*
were
distant
and
isolated
temporalities
shrunken
to
toy
constructions
*NL*
in
the
lonely
waste
of
what
seemed
a
desert
--
and
was
.
Such
a
scene
*NL*
is
always
mournful
,
it
is
so
impressively
still
,
and
looks
so
*NL*
steeped
in
death
.
But
there
was
a
sound
here
which
interrupted
*NL*
the
stillness
only
to
add
to
its
mournfulness
;
this
was
the
faint
*NL*
far
sound
of
tolling
bells
which
floated
fitfully
to
us
on
the
*NL*
passing
breeze
,
and
so
faintly
,
so
softly
,
that
we
hardly
knew
*NL*
whether
we
heard
it
with
our
ears
or
with
our
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
reached
the
monastery
before
dark
,
and
there
the
males
were
*NL*
given
lodging
,
but
the
women
were
sent
over
to
the
nunnery
.
The
*NL*
bells
were
close
at
hand
now
,
and
their
solemn
booming
smote
*NL*
upon
the
ear
like
a
message
of
doom
.
A
superstitious
despair
*NL*
possessed
the
heart
of
every
monk
and
published
itself
in
his
*NL*
ghastly
face
.
Everywhere
,
these
black-robed
,
soft-sandaled
,
*NL*
tallow-visaged
specters
appeared
,
flitted
about
and
disappeared
,
*NL*
noiseless
as
the
creatures
of
a
troubled
dream
,
and
as
uncanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
abbot
's
joy
to
see
me
was
pathetic
.
Even
to
tears
;
but
*NL*
he
did
the
shedding
himself
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delay
not
,
son
,
but
get
to
thy
saving
work
.
An
we
bring
not
*NL*
the
water
back
again
,
and
soon
,
we
are
ruined
,
and
the
good
work
*NL*
of
two
hundred
years
must
end
.
And
see
thou
do
it
with
enchantments
*NL*
that
be
holy
,
for
the
Church
will
not
endure
that
work
in
her
cause
*NL*
be
done
by
devil
's
magic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
work
,
Father
,
be
sure
there
will
be
no
devil
's
work
*NL*
connected
with
it
.
I
shall
use
no
arts
that
come
of
the
devil
,
*NL*
and
no
elements
not
created
by
the
hand
of
God
.
But
is
Merlin
*NL*
working
strictly
on
pious
lines
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
said
he
would
,
my
son
,
he
said
he
would
,
and
took
oath
*NL*
to
make
his
promise
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
that
case
,
let
him
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
you
will
not
sit
idle
by
,
but
help
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
answer
to
mix
methods
,
Father
;
neither
would
it
be
*NL*
professional
courtesy
.
Two
of
a
trade
must
not
underbid
each
*NL*
other
.
We
might
as
well
cut
rates
and
be
done
with
it
;
it
would
*NL*
arrive
at
that
in
the
end
.
Merlin
has
the
contract
;
no
other
*NL*
magician
can
touch
it
till
he
throws
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
take
it
from
him
;
it
is
a
terrible
emergency
and
the
*NL*
act
is
thereby
justified
.
And
if
it
were
not
so
,
who
will
give
*NL*
law
to
the
Church
?
The
Church
giveth
law
to
all
;
and
what
she
*NL*
wills
to
do
,
that
she
may
do
,
hurt
whom
it
may
.
I
will
take
it
*NL*
from
him
;
you
shall
begin
upon
the
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
not
be
,
Father
.
No
doubt
,
as
you
say
,
where
power
is
*NL*
supreme
,
one
can
do
as
one
likes
and
suffer
no
injury
;
but
we
poor
*NL*
magicians
are
not
so
situated
.
Merlin
is
a
very
good
magician
*NL*
in
a
small
way
,
and
has
quite
a
neat
provincial
reputation
.
He
*NL*
is
struggling
along
,
doing
the
best
he
can
,
and
it
would
not
be
*NL*
etiquette
for
me
to
take
his
job
until
he
himself
abandons
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbot
's
face
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
is
simple
.
There
are
ways
to
persuade
him
to
abandon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-no
,
Father
,
it
skills
not
,
as
these
people
say

If
he
were
*NL*
persuaded
against
his
will
,
he
would
load
that
well
with
a
malicious
*NL*
enchantment
which
would
balk
me
until
I
found
out
its
secret
.
*NL*
It
might
take
a
month
.
I
could
set
up
a
little
enchantment
of
*NL*
mine
which
I
call
the
telephone
,
and
he
could
not
find
out
its
*NL*
secret
in
a
hundred
years
.
Yes
,
you
perceive
,
he
might
block
me
*NL*
for
a
month
.
Would
you
like
to
risk
a
month
in
a
dry
time
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
month
!
The
mere
thought
of
it
maketh
me
to
shudder

thy

son

But
my
heart
is
heavy
with
this
disappointment

Leave
me
,
and
let
me
wear
my
spirit
with
weariness
and
waiting
,
*NL*
even
as
I
have
done
these
ten
long
days
,
counterfeiting
thus
*NL*
the
thing
that
is
called
rest
,
the
prone
body
making
outward
sign
*NL*
of
repose
where
inwardly
is
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
would
have
been
best
,
all
round
,
for
Merlin
to
waive
*NL*
etiquette
and
quit
and
call
it
half
a
day
,
since
he
would
never
be
*NL*
able
to
start
that
water
,
for
he
was
a
true
magician
of
the
time
;
*NL*
which
is
to
say
,
the
big
miracles
,
the
ones
that
gave
him
his
*NL*
reputation
,
always
had
the
luck
to
be
performed
when
nobody
but
*NL*
Merlin
was
present
;
he
could
n't
start
this
well
with
all
this
crowd
*NL*
around
to
see
;
a
crowd
was
as
bad
for
a
magician
's
miracle
in
*NL*
that
day
as
it
was
for
a
spiritualist
's
miracle
in
mine
;
there
was
*NL*
sure
to
be
some
skeptic
on
hand
to
turn
up
the
gas
at
the
crucial
*NL*
moment
and
spoil
everything
.
But
I
did
not
want
Merlin
to
retire
*NL*
from
the
job
until
I
was
ready
to
take
hold
of
it
effectively
*NL*
myself
;
and
I
could
not
do
that
until
I
got
my
things
from
Camelot
,
*NL*
and
that
would
take
two
or
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
presence
gave
the
monks
hope
,
and
cheered
them
up
a
good
deal
;
*NL*
insomuch
that
they
ate
a
square
meal
that
night
for
the
first
time
*NL*
in
ten
days
.
As
soon
as
their
stomachs
had
been
properly
reinforced
*NL*
with
food
,
their
spirits
began
to
rise
fast
;
when
the
mead
began
to
*NL*
go
round
they
rose
faster
.
By
the
time
everybody
was
half-seas
over
,
*NL*
the
holy
community
was
in
good
shape
to
make
a
night
of
it
;
so
we
*NL*
stayed
by
the
board
and
put
it
through
on
that
line
.
Matters
got
*NL*
to
be
very
jolly
.
Good
old
questionable
stories
were
told
that
made
*NL*
the
tears
run
down
and
cavernous
mouths
stand
wide
and
the
round
*NL*
bellies
shake
with
laughter
;
and
questionable
songs
were
bellowed
out
*NL*
in
a
mighty
chorus
that
drowned
the
boom
of
the
tolling
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
ventured
a
story
myself
;
and
vast
was
the
success
of
it
.
*NL*
Not
right
off
,
of
course
,
for
the
native
of
those
islands
does
*NL*
not
,
as
a
rule
,
dissolve
upon
the
early
applications
of
a
humorous
*NL*
thing
;
but
the
fifth
time
I
told
it
,
they
began
to
crack
in
places
;
*NL*
the
eight
time
I
told
it
,
they
began
to
crumble
;
at
the
twelfth
*NL*
repetition
they
fell
apart
in
chunks
;
and
at
the
fifteenth
they
*NL*
disintegrated
,
and
I
got
a
broom
and
swept
them
up
.
This
language
*NL*
is
figurative
.
Those
islanders
--
well
,
they
are
slow
pay
at
first
,
*NL*
in
the
matter
of
return
for
your
investment
of
effort
,
but
in
the
end
*NL*
they
make
the
pay
of
all
other
nations
poor
and
small
by
contrast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
the
well
next
day
betimes
.
Merlin
was
there
,
enchanting
*NL*
away
like
a
beaver
,
but
not
raising
the
moisture
.
He
was
not
in
*NL*
a
pleasant
humor
;
and
every
time
I
hinted
that
perhaps
this
contract
*NL*
was
a
shade
too
hefty
for
a
novice
he
unlimbered
his
tongue
and
*NL*
cursed
like
a
bishop
--
French
bishop
of
the
Regency
days
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
were
about
as
I
expected
to
find
them
.
The
``
fountain
''
was
*NL*
an
ordinary
well
,
it
had
been
dug
in
the
ordinary
way
,
and
stoned
up
*NL*
in
the
ordinary
way
.
There
was
no
miracle
about
it
.
Even
the
lie
*NL*
that
had
created
its
reputation
was
not
miraculous
;
I
could
have
*NL*
told
it
myself
,
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
.
The
well
was
in
a
*NL*
dark
chamber
which
stood
in
the
center
of
a
cut-stone
chapel
,
whose
*NL*
walls
were
hung
with
pious
pictures
of
a
workmanship
that
would
*NL*
have
made
a
chromo
feel
good
;
pictures
historically
commemorative
*NL*
of
curative
miracles
which
had
been
achieved
by
the
waters
when
*NL*
nobody
was
looking
.
That
is
,
nobody
but
angels
;
they
are
always
*NL*
on
deck
when
there
is
a
miracle
to
the
fore
--
so
as
to
get
put
in
*NL*
the
picture
,
perhaps
.
Angels
are
as
fond
of
that
as
a
fire
company
;
*NL*
look
at
the
old
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-chamber
was
dimly
lighted
by
lamps
;
the
water
was
drawn
*NL*
with
a
windlass
and
chain
by
monks
,
and
poured
into
troughs
which
*NL*
delivered
it
into
stone
reservoirs
outside
in
the
chapel
--
when
*NL*
there
was
water
to
draw
,
I
mean
--
and
none
but
monks
could
enter
*NL*
the
well-chamber
.
I
entered
it
,
for
I
had
temporary
authority
*NL*
to
do
so
,
by
courtesy
of
my
professional
brother
and
subordinate
.
*NL*
But
he
had
n't
entered
it
himself
.
He
did
everything
by
incantations
;
*NL*
he
never
worked
his
intellect
.
If
he
had
stepped
in
there
and
used
*NL*
his
eyes
,
instead
of
his
disordered
mind
,
he
could
have
cured
*NL*
the
well
by
natural
means
,
and
then
turned
it
into
a
miracle
in
*NL*
the
customary
way
;
but
no
,
he
was
an
old
numskull
,
a
magician
who
*NL*
believed
in
his
own
magic
;
and
no
magician
can
thrive
who
is
*NL*
handicapped
with
a
superstition
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
an
idea
that
the
well
had
sprung
a
leak
;
that
some
of
the
*NL*
wall
stones
near
the
bottom
had
fallen
and
exposed
fissures
that
*NL*
allowed
the
water
to
escape
.
I
measured
the
chain
--
98
feet
.
Then
*NL*
I
called
in
a
couple
of
monks
,
locked
the
door
,
took
a
candle
,
and
*NL*
made
them
lower
me
in
the
bucket
.
When
the
chain
was
all
paid
out
,
*NL*
the
candle
confirmed
my
suspicion
;
a
considerable
section
of
the
*NL*
wall
was
gone
,
exposing
a
good
big
fissure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
almost
regretted
that
my
theory
about
the
well
's
trouble
was
*NL*
correct
,
because
I
had
another
one
that
had
a
showy
point
or
two
*NL*
about
it
for
a
miracle
.
I
remembered
that
in
America
,
many
*NL*
centuries
later
,
when
an
oil
well
ceased
to
flow
,
they
used
to
*NL*
blast
it
out
with
a
dynamite
torpedo
.
If
I
should
find
this
well
*NL*
dry
and
no
explanation
of
it
,
I
could
astonish
these
people
most
*NL*
nobly
by
having
a
person
of
no
especial
value
drop
a
dynamite
*NL*
bomb
into
it
.
It
was
my
idea
to
appoint
Merlin
.
However
,
it
was
*NL*
plain
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
bomb
.
One
can
not
have
*NL*
everything
the
way
he
would
like
it
.
A
man
has
no
business
to
*NL*
be
depressed
by
a
disappointment
,
anyway
;
he
ought
to
make
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
get
even
.
That
is
what
I
did
.
I
said
to
myself
,
I
am
in
no
*NL*
hurry
,
I
can
wait
;
that
bomb
will
come
good
yet
.
And
it
did
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
was
above
ground
again
,
I
turned
out
the
monks
,
and
let
down
*NL*
a
fish-line
;
the
well
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
deep
,
and
there
*NL*
was
forty-one
feet
of
water
in
it
.
I
called
in
a
monk
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
deep
is
the
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
sir
,
I
wit
not
,
having
never
been
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
the
water
usually
stand
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
to
the
top
,
these
two
centuries
,
as
the
testimony
goeth
,
*NL*
brought
down
to
us
through
our
predecessors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
--
as
to
recent
times
at
least
--
for
there
was
witness
*NL*
to
it
,
and
better
witness
than
a
monk
;
only
about
twenty
or
thirty
*NL*
feet
of
the
chain
showed
wear
and
use
,
the
rest
of
it
was
unworn
*NL*
and
rusty
.
What
had
happened
when
the
well
gave
out
that
other
*NL*
time
?
Without
doubt
some
practical
person
had
come
along
and
*NL*
mended
the
leak
,
and
then
had
come
up
and
told
the
abbot
he
had
*NL*
discovered
by
divination
that
if
the
sinful
bath
were
destroyed
*NL*
the
well
would
flow
again
.
The
leak
had
befallen
again
now
,
and
*NL*
these
children
would
have
prayed
,
and
processioned
,
and
tolled
*NL*
their
bells
for
heavenly
succor
till
they
all
dried
up
and
blew
*NL*
away
,
and
no
innocent
of
them
all
would
ever
have
thought
to
drop
*NL*
a
fish-line
into
the
well
or
go
down
in
it
and
find
out
what
was
*NL*
really
the
matter
.
Old
habit
of
mind
is
one
of
the
toughest
things
*NL*
to
get
away
from
in
the
world
.
It
transmits
itself
like
physical
*NL*
form
and
feature
;
and
for
a
man
,
in
those
days
,
to
have
had
an
idea
*NL*
that
his
ancestors
had
n't
had
,
would
have
brought
him
under
suspicion
*NL*
of
being
illegitimate
.
I
said
to
the
monk
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
difficult
miracle
to
restore
water
in
a
dry
well
,
but
we
*NL*
will
try
,
if
my
brother
Merlin
fails
.
Brother
Merlin
is
a
very
*NL*
passable
artist
,
but
only
in
the
parlor-magic
line
,
and
he
may
*NL*
not
succeed
;
in
fact
,
is
not
likely
to
succeed
.
But
that
should
*NL*
be
nothing
to
his
discredit
;
the
man
that
can
do
_
this
_
kind
of
*NL*
miracle
knows
enough
to
keep
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hotel
?
I
mind
not
to
have
heard
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
hotel
?
It
's
what
you
call
hostel

The
man
that
can
do
this
*NL*
miracle
can
keep
hostel
.
I
can
do
this
miracle
;
I
shall
do
this
*NL*
miracle
;
yet
I
do
not
try
to
conceal
from
you
that
it
is
a
miracle
*NL*
to
tax
the
occult
powers
to
the
last
strain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
knoweth
that
truth
better
than
the
brotherhood
,
indeed
;
for
*NL*
it
is
of
record
that
aforetime
it
was
parlous
difficult
and
took
*NL*
a
year
.
Natheless
,
God
send
you
good
success
,
and
to
that
end
*NL*
will
we
pray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
business
it
was
a
good
idea
to
get
the
notion
around
*NL*
that
the
thing
was
difficult
.
Many
a
small
thing
has
been
made
*NL*
large
by
the
right
kind
of
advertising
.
That
monk
was
filled
up
*NL*
with
the
difficulty
of
this
enterprise
;
he
would
fill
up
the
others
.
*NL*
In
two
days
the
solicitude
would
be
booming
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
my
way
home
at
noon
,
I
met
Sandy
.
She
had
been
sampling
the
*NL*
hermits
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
like
to
do
that
myself
.
This
is
Wednesday

Is
there
*NL*
a

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Is
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

yes

What

the

*NL*
I
never

dole

the

humble
mortal
who

by
bar
and
lack

great
consecration
seeth
in
his

a
symbol

of
that

do
publish
to
the
*NL*
pitying
eye
with
sackcloth
trappings
whereon
the
ashes
of
grief
*NL*
do
lie
bepowdered
and
bestrewn
,
and
so
,
when
such
shall
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
his
mind
encounter
these
golden
phrases
of
high
mystery
,
*NL*
these
shut-up-shops
,
and
draw-the-game
,
and
bank-the-fires
,
it
is
*NL*
but
by
the
grace
of
God
that
he
burst
not
for
envy
of
the
mind
that
*NL*
can
beget
,
and
tongue
that
can
deliver
so
great
and
mellow-sounding
*NL*
miracles
of
speech
,
and
if
there
do
ensue
confusion
in
that
humbler
*NL*
mind
,
and
failure
to
divine
the
meanings
of
these
wonders
,
then
*NL*
if
so
be
this
miscomprehension
is
not
vain
but
sooth
and
true
,
*NL*
wit
ye
well
it
is
the
very
substance
of
worshipful
dear
homage

*NL*
may
not
lightly
be
misprized
,

had
been

an
ye
had
noted
this

complexion

understood
that

nor

nor

*NL*
turned
to

so
I
pray
you
mercy
of
my
fault
,
*NL*
and
that
ye
will
of
your
kindness
and
your
charity
forgive
it
,
good
*NL*
my
master
and
most
dear
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
n't
make
it
all
out
--
that
is
,
the
details
--
but
I
got
the
*NL*
general
idea
;
and
enough
of
it
,
too
,
to
be
ashamed
.
It
was
not
*NL*
fair
to
spring
those
nineteenth
century
technicalities
upon
the
*NL*
untutored
infant
of
the
sixth
and
then
rail
at
her
because
she
*NL*
could
n't
get
their
drift
;
and
when
she
was
making
the
honest
best
*NL*
drive
at
it
she
could
,
too
,
and
no
fault
of
hers
that
she
could
n't
*NL*
fetch
the
home
plate
;
and
so
I
apologized
.
Then
we
meandered
*NL*
pleasantly
away
toward
the
hermit
holes
in
sociable
converse
*NL*
together
,
and
better
friends
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
gradually
coming
to
have
a
mysterious
and
shuddery
reverence
*NL*
for
this
girl
;
nowadays
whenever
she
pulled
out
from
the
station
*NL*
and
got
her
train
fairly
started
on
one
of
those
horizonless
*NL*
transcontinental
sentences
of
hers
,
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
*NL*
I
was
standing
in
the
awful
presence
of
the
Mother
of
the
German
*NL*
Language
.
I
was
so
impressed
with
this
,
that
sometimes
when
she
*NL*
began
to
empty
one
of
these
sentences
on
me
I
unconsciously
took
*NL*
the
very
attitude
of
reverence
,
and
stood
uncovered
;
and
if
words
*NL*
had
been
water
,
I
had
been
drowned
,
sure
.
She
had
exactly
the
*NL*
German
way
;
whatever
was
in
her
mind
to
be
delivered
,
whether
a
*NL*
mere
remark
,
or
a
sermon
,
or
a
cyclopedia
,
or
the
history
of
a
war
,
*NL*
she
would
get
it
into
a
single
sentence
or
die
.
Whenever
the
literary
*NL*
German
dives
into
a
sentence
,
that
is
the
last
you
are
going
to
see
*NL*
of
him
till
he
emerges
on
the
other
side
of
his
Atlantic
with
his
*NL*
verb
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
drifted
from
hermit
to
hermit
all
the
afternoon
.
It
was
a
most
*NL*
strange
menagerie
.
The
chief
emulation
among
them
seemed
to
be
,
*NL*
to
see
which
could
manage
to
be
the
uncleanest
and
most
prosperous
*NL*
with
vermin
.
Their
manner
and
attitudes
were
the
last
expression
*NL*
of
complacent
self-righteousness
.
It
was
one
anchorite
's
pride
*NL*
to
lie
naked
in
the
mud
and
let
the
insects
bite
him
and
blister
*NL*
him
unmolested
;
it
was
another
's
to
lean
against
a
rock
,
all
day
*NL*
long
,
conspicuous
to
the
admiration
of
the
throng
of
pilgrims
*NL*
and
pray
;
it
was
another
's
to
go
naked
and
crawl
around
on
all
fours
;
*NL*
it
was
another
's
to
drag
about
with
him
,
year
in
and
year
out
,
*NL*
eighty
pounds
of
iron
;
it
was
another
's
to
never
lie
down
when
*NL*
he
slept
,
but
to
stand
among
the
thorn-bushes
and
snore
when
there
*NL*
were
pilgrims
around
to
look
;
a
woman
,
who
had
the
white
hair
of
*NL*
age
,
and
no
other
apparel
,
was
black
from
crown
to
heel
with
*NL*
forty-seven
years
of
holy
abstinence
from
water
.
Groups
of
gazing
*NL*
pilgrims
stood
around
all
and
every
of
these
strange
objects
,
lost
*NL*
in
reverent
wonder
,
and
envious
of
the
fleckless
sanctity
which
*NL*
these
pious
austerities
had
won
for
them
from
an
exacting
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
we
went
to
see
one
of
the
supremely
great
ones
.
He
was
*NL*
a
mighty
celebrity
;
his
fame
had
penetrated
all
Christendom
;
the
*NL*
noble
and
the
renowned
journeyed
from
the
remotest
lands
on
the
globe
*NL*
to
pay
him
reverence
.
His
stand
was
in
the
center
of
the
widest
part
*NL*
of
the
valley
;
and
it
took
all
that
space
to
hold
his
crowds
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
stand
was
a
pillar
sixty
feet
high
,
with
a
broad
platform
on
*NL*
the
top
of
it
.
He
was
now
doing
what
he
had
been
doing
every
day
*NL*
for
twenty
years
up
there
--
bowing
his
body
ceaselessly
and
rapidly
*NL*
almost
to
his
feet
.
It
was
his
way
of
praying
.
I
timed
him
with
a
*NL*
stop
watch
,
and
he
made
1,244
revolutions
in
24
minutes
and
*NL*
46
seconds
.
It
seemed
a
pity
to
have
all
this
power
going
to
waste
.
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
most
useful
motions
in
mechanics
,
the
pedal
*NL*
movement
;
so
I
made
a
note
in
my
memorandum
book
,
purposing
some
*NL*
day
to
apply
a
system
of
elastic
cords
to
him
and
run
a
sewing
*NL*
machine
with
it
.
I
afterward
carried
out
that
scheme
,
and
got
*NL*
five
years
'
good
service
out
of
him
;
in
which
time
he
turned
out
*NL*
upward
of
eighteen
thousand
first-rate
tow-linen
shirts
,
which
*NL*
was
ten
a
day
.
I
worked
him
Sundays
and
all
;
he
was
going
,
Sundays
,
*NL*
the
same
as
week
days
,
and
it
was
no
use
to
waste
the
power
.
*NL*
These
shirts
cost
me
nothing
but
just
the
mere
trifle
for
the
*NL*
materials
--
I
furnished
those
myself
,
it
would
not
have
been
right
*NL*
to
make
him
do
that
--
and
they
sold
like
smoke
to
pilgrims
at
a
*NL*
dollar
and
a
half
apiece
,
which
was
the
price
of
fifty
cows
or
*NL*
a
blooded
race
horse
in
Arthurdom
.
They
were
regarded
as
a
perfect
*NL*
protection
against
sin
,
and
advertised
as
such
by
my
knights
*NL*
everywhere
,
with
the
paint-pot
and
stencil-plate
;
insomuch
that
*NL*
there
was
not
a
cliff
or
a
bowlder
or
a
dead
wall
in
England
but
*NL*
you
could
read
on
it
at
a
mile
distance
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buy
the
only
genuine
St.
Stylite
;
patronized
by
the
Nobility
.
*NL*
Patent
applied
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
money
in
the
business
than
one
knew
what
to
do
with
.
*NL*
As
it
extended
,
I
brought
out
a
line
of
goods
suitable
for
kings
,
*NL*
and
a
nobby
thing
for
duchesses
and
that
sort
,
with
ruffles
down
*NL*
the
forehatch
and
the
running-gear
clewed
up
with
a
featherstitch
*NL*
to
leeward
and
then
hauled
aft
with
a
back-stay
and
triced
up
with
*NL*
a
half-turn
in
the
standing
rigging
forward
of
the
weather-gaskets
.
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
a
daisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
about
that
time
I
noticed
that
the
motive
power
had
taken
to
*NL*
standing
on
one
leg
,
and
I
found
that
there
was
something
the
matter
*NL*
with
the
other
one
;
so
I
stocked
the
business
and
unloaded
,
taking
*NL*
Sir
Bors
de
Ganis
into
camp
financially
along
with
certain
of
his
*NL*
friends
;
for
the
works
stopped
within
a
year
,
and
the
good
saint
*NL*
got
him
to
his
rest
.
But
he
had
earned
it
.
I
can
say
that
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
saw
him
that
first
time
--
however
,
his
personal
condition
*NL*
will
not
quite
bear
description
here
.
You
can
read
it

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
RESTORATION
OF
THE
FOUNTAIN
*NL*
*NL*
Saturday
noon
I
went
to
the
well
and
looked
on
a
while
.
Merlin
*NL*
was
still
burning
smoke-powders
,
and
pawing
the
air
,
and
muttering
*NL*
gibberish
as
hard
as
ever
,
but
looking
pretty
down-hearted
,
for
*NL*
of
course
he
had
not
started
even
a
perspiration
in
that
well
yet
.
*NL*
Finally
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
the
thing
promise
by
this
time
,
partner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
,
I
am
even
now
busied
with
trial
of
the
powerfulest
*NL*
enchantment
known
to
the
princes
of
the
occult
arts
in
the
lands
*NL*
of
the
East
;
an
it
fail
me
,
naught
can
avail
.
Peace
,
until
I
finish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
a
smoke
this
time
that
darkened
all
the
region
,
and
must
*NL*
have
made
matters
uncomfortable
for
the
hermits
,
for
the
wind
*NL*
was
their
way
,
and
it
rolled
down
over
their
dens
in
a
dense
and
*NL*
billowy
fog
.
He
poured
out
volumes
of
speech
to
match
,
and
contorted
*NL*
his
body
and
sawed
the
air
with
his
hands
in
a
most
extraordinary
*NL*
way
.
At
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
he
dropped
down
panting
,
and
*NL*
about
exhausted
.
Now
arrived
the
abbot
and
several
hundred
monks
*NL*
and
nuns
,
and
behind
them
a
multitude
of
pilgrims
and
a
couple
of
*NL*
acres
of
foundlings
,
all
drawn
by
the
prodigious
smoke
,
and
all
*NL*
in
a
grand
state
of
excitement
.
The
abbot
inquired
anxiously
for
*NL*
results
.
Merlin
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
any
labor
of
mortal
might
break
the
spell
that
binds
these
*NL*
waters
,
this
which
I
have
but
just
essayed
had
done
it
.
It
has
*NL*
failed
;
whereby
I
do
now
know
that
that
which
I
had
feared
is
*NL*
a
truth
established
;
the
sign
of
this
failure
is
,
that
the
most
*NL*
potent
spirit
known
to
the
magicians
of
the
East
,
and
whose
name
*NL*
none
may
utter
and
live
,
has
laid
his
spell
upon
this
well
.
The
*NL*
mortal
does
not
breathe
,
nor
ever
will
,
who
can
penetrate
the
secret
*NL*
of
that
spell
,
and
without
that
secret
none
can
break
it
.
The
*NL*
water
will
flow
no
more
forever
,
good
Father
.
I
have
done
what
*NL*
man
could
.
Suffer
me
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
this
threw
the
abbot
into
a
good
deal
of
a
consternation
.
*NL*
He
turned
to
me
with
the
signs
of
it
in
his
face
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
heard
him
.
Is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Part
of
it
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
all
,
then
,
not
all

What
part
is
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
that
spirit
with
the
Russian
name
has
put
his
spell
*NL*
upon
the
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not

Ye
mean
,
not
certainly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wherefore
,
ye
also

he
saith

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
There
are

which
an

break
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
conditions

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
are
nothing
difficult

Only
these

half
a
mile

myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

''
said
Merlin
,
with
an
evil
smile
.
``
Ye
wit
that

*NL*

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

John
W.
Merlin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
home
shot
,
and
it
made
him
wince
;
for
he
was
the
worst
*NL*
weather-failure
in
the
kingdom
.
Whenever
he
ordered
up
the
*NL*
danger-signals
along
the
coast
there
was
a
week
's
dead
calm
,
sure
,
*NL*
and
every
time
he
prophesied
fair
weather
it
rained
brickbats
.
*NL*
But
I
kept
him
in
the
weather
bureau
right
along
,
to
undermine
*NL*
his
reputation
.
However
,
that
shot
raised
his
bile
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
starting
home
to
report
my
death
,
he
said
he
would
remain
*NL*
and
enjoy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
two
experts
arrived
in
the
evening
,
and
pretty
well
fagged
,
*NL*
for
they
had
traveled
double
tides
.
They
had
pack-mules
along
,
*NL*
and
had
brought
everything
I
needed
--
tools
,
pump
,
lead
pipe
,
*NL*
Greek
fire
,
sheaves
of
big
rockets
,
roman
candles
,
colored
fire
*NL*
sprays
,
electric
apparatus
,
and
a
lot
of
sundries
--
everything
*NL*
necessary
for
the
stateliest
kind
of
a
miracle
.
They
got
their
*NL*
supper
and
a
nap
,
and
about
midnight
we
sallied
out
through
a
*NL*
solitude
so
wholly
vacant
and
complete
that
it
quite
overpassed
*NL*
the
required
conditions
.
We
took
possession
of
the
well
and
its
*NL*
surroundings
.
My
boys
were
experts
in
all
sorts
of
things
,
from
*NL*
the
stoning
up
of
a
well
to
the
constructing
of
a
mathematical
*NL*
instrument
.
An
hour
before
sunrise
we
had
that
leak
mended
in
*NL*
ship-shape
fashion
,
and
the
water
began
to
rise
.
Then
we
stowed
our
*NL*
fireworks
in
the
chapel
,
locked
up
the
place
,
and
went
home
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
noon
mass
was
over
,
we
were
at
the
well
again
;
for
there
*NL*
was
a
deal
to
do
yet
,
and
I
was
determined
to
spring
the
miracle
*NL*
before
midnight
,
for
business
reasons
:
for
whereas
a
miracle
*NL*
worked
for
the
Church
on
a
week-day
is
worth
a
good
deal
,
it
is
*NL*
worth
six
times
as
much
if
you
get
it
in
on
a
Sunday
.
In
nine
hours
*NL*
the
water
had
risen
to
its
customary
level
--
that
is
to
say
,
it
was
*NL*
within
twenty-three
feet
of
the
top
.
We
put
in
a
little
iron
pump
,
*NL*
one
of
the
first
turned
out
by
my
works
near
the
capital
;
we
bored
*NL*
into
a
stone
reservoir
which
stood
against
the
outer
wall
of
the
*NL*
well-chamber
and
inserted
a
section
of
lead
pipe
that
was
long
*NL*
enough
to
reach
to
the
door
of
the
chapel
and
project
beyond
*NL*
the
threshold
,
where
the
gushing
water
would
be
visible
to
the
*NL*
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
of
people
I
was
intending
should
be
*NL*
present
on
the
flat
plain
in
front
of
this
little
holy
hillock
at
*NL*
the
proper
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
knocked
the
head
out
of
an
empty
hogshead
and
hoisted
this
*NL*
hogshead
to
the
flat
roof
of
the
chapel
,
where
we
clamped
it
down
*NL*
fast
,
poured
in
gunpowder
till
it
lay
loosely
an
inch
deep
on
the
*NL*
bottom
,
then
we
stood
up
rockets
in
the
hogshead
as
thick
as
they
*NL*
could
loosely
stand
,
all
the
different
breeds
of
rockets
there
are
;
*NL*
and
they
made
a
portly
and
imposing
sheaf
,
I
can
tell
you
.
We
*NL*
grounded
the
wire
of
a
pocket
electrical
battery
in
that
powder
,
*NL*
we
placed
a
whole
magazine
of
Greek
fire
on
each
corner
of
the
*NL*
roof
--
blue
on
one
corner
,
green
on
another
,
red
on
another
,
and
*NL*
purple
on
the
last
--
and
grounded
a
wire
in
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
hundred
yards
off
,
in
the
flat
,
we
built
a
pen
of
*NL*
scantlings
,
about
four
feet
high
,
and
laid
planks
on
it
,
and
so
*NL*
made
a
platform
.
We
covered
it
with
swell
tapestries
borrowed
*NL*
for
the
occasion
,
and
topped
it
off
with
the
abbot
's
own
throne
.
*NL*
When
you
are
going
to
do
a
miracle
for
an
ignorant
race
,
you
want
*NL*
to
get
in
every
detail
that
will
count
;
you
want
to
make
all
the
*NL*
properties
impressive
to
the
public
eye
;
you
want
to
make
matters
*NL*
comfortable
for
your
head
guest
;
then
you
can
turn
yourself
loose
*NL*
and
play
your
effects
for
all
they
are
worth
.
I
know
the
value
of
*NL*
these
things
,
for
I
know
human
nature
.
You
ca
n't
throw
too
much
*NL*
style
into
a
miracle
.
It
costs
trouble
,
and
work
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
money
;
but
it
pays
in
the
end
.
Well
,
we
brought
the
wires
to
*NL*
the
ground
at
the
chapel
,
and
then
brought
them
under
the
ground
*NL*
to
the
platform
,
and
hid
the
batteries
there
.
We
put
a
rope
fence
*NL*
a
hundred
feet
square
around
the
platform
to
keep
off
the
common
*NL*
multitude
,
and
that
finished
the
work
.
My
idea
was
,
doors
open
*NL*
at
10:30
,
performance
to
begin
at
11:25
sharp
.
I
wished
I
could
*NL*
charge
admission
,
but
of
course
that
would
n't
answer
.
I
instructed
*NL*
my
boys
to
be
in
the
chapel
as
early
as
10
,
before
anybody
was
*NL*
around
,
and
be
ready
to
man
the
pumps
at
the
proper
time
,
and
*NL*
make
the
fur
fly
.
Then
we
went
home
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
the
disaster
to
the
well
had
traveled
far
by
this
time
;
*NL*
and
now
for
two
or
three
days
a
steady
avalanche
of
people
had
*NL*
been
pouring
into
the
valley
.
The
lower
end
of
the
valley
was
*NL*
become
one
huge
camp
;
we
should
have
a
good
house
,
no
question
*NL*
about
that
.
Criers
went
the
rounds
early
in
the
evening
and
*NL*
announced
the
coming
attempt
,
which
put
every
pulse
up
to
fever
*NL*
heat
.
They
gave
notice
that
the
abbot
and
his
official
suite
would
*NL*
move
in
state
and
occupy
the
platform
at
10:30
,
up
to
which
time
*NL*
all
the
region
which
was
under
my
ban
must
be
clear
;
the
bells
*NL*
would
then
cease
from
tolling
,
and
this
sign
should
be
permission
*NL*
to
the
multitudes
to
close
in
and
take
their
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
at
the
platform
and
all
ready
to
do
the
honors
when
the
*NL*
abbot
's
solemn
procession
hove
in
sight
--
which
it
did
not
do
till
*NL*
it
was
nearly
to
the
rope
fence
,
because
it
was
a
starless
black
*NL*
night
and
no
torches
permitted
.
With
it
came
Merlin
,
and
took
*NL*
a
front
seat
on
the
platform
;
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
once
.
*NL*
One
could
not
see
the
multitudes
banked
together
beyond
the
ban
,
*NL*
but
they
were
there
,
just
the
same
.
The
moment
the
bells
stopped
,
*NL*
those
banked
masses
broke
and
poured
over
the
line
like
a
vast
*NL*
black
wave
,
and
for
as
much
as
a
half
hour
it
continued
to
flow
,
*NL*
and
then
it
solidified
itself
,
and
you
could
have
walked
upon
*NL*
a
pavement
of
human
heads
to
--
well
,
miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
solemn
stage-wait
,
now
,
for
about
twenty
minutes
--
a
thing
*NL*
I
had
counted
on
for
effect
;
it
is
always
good
to
let
your
audience
*NL*
have
a
chance
to
work
up
its
expectancy
.
At
length
,
out
of
the
*NL*
silence
a
noble
Latin
chant
--
men
's
voices
--
broke
and
swelled
up
*NL*
and
rolled
away
into
the
night
,
a
majestic
tide
of
melody
.
I
had
*NL*
put
that
up
,
too
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
effects
I
ever
invented
.
*NL*
When
it
was
finished
I
stood
up
on
the
platform
and
extended
my
*NL*
hands
abroad
,
for
two
minutes
,
with
my
face
uplifted
--
that
always
*NL*
produces
a
dead
hush
--
and
then
slowly
pronounced
this
ghastly
word
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
awfulness
which
caused
hundreds
to
tremble
,
and
*NL*
many
women
to
faint
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
I
was
moaning
out
the
closing
hunks
of
that
word
,
I
touched
*NL*
off
one
of
my
electric
connections
and
all
that
murky
world
of
*NL*
people
stood
revealed
in
a
hideous
blue
glare
!
It
was
immense
*NL*
--
that
effect
!
Lots
of
people
shrieked
,
women
curled
up
and
quit
*NL*
in
every
direction
,
foundlings
collapsed
by
platoons
.
The
abbot
*NL*
and
the
monks
crossed
themselves
nimbly
and
their
lips
fluttered
*NL*
with
agitated
prayers
.
Merlin
held
his
grip
,
but
he
was
astonished
*NL*
clear
down
to
his
corns
;
he
had
never
seen
anything
to
begin
*NL*
with
that
,
before
.
Now
was
the
time
to
pile
in
the
effects
.
I
lifted
*NL*
my
hands
and
groaned
out
this
word
--
as
it
were
in
agony
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
and
turned
on
the
red
fire
!
You
should
have
heard
that
Atlantic
*NL*
of
people
moan
and
howl
when
that
crimson
hell
joined
the
blue
!
*NL*
After
sixty
seconds
I
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen
-
*NL*
tragoedie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
and
lit
up
the
green
fire
!
After
waiting
only
forty
seconds
this
*NL*
time
,
I
spread
my
arms
abroad
and
thundered
out
the
devastating
*NL*
syllables
of
this
word
of
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
and
whirled
on
the
purple
glare
!
There
they
were
,
all
going
*NL*
at
once
,
red
,
blue
,
green
,
purple
!
--
four
furious
volcanoes
pouring
*NL*
vast
clouds
of
radiant
smoke
aloft
,
and
spreading
a
blinding
*NL*
rainbowed
noonday
to
the
furthest
confines
of
that
valley
.
In
*NL*
the
distance
one
could
see
that
fellow
on
the
pillar
standing
rigid
*NL*
against
the
background
of
sky
,
his
seesaw
stopped
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
twenty
years
.
I
knew
the
boys
were
at
the
pump
now
and
*NL*
ready
.
So
I
said
to
the
abbot
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
is
come
,
Father
.
I
am
about
to
pronounce
the
dread
name
*NL*
and
command
the
spell
to
dissolve
.
You
want
to
brace
up
,
and
take
*NL*
hold
of
something
.
''
Then
I
shouted
to
the
people
:
``
Behold
,
in
*NL*
another
minute
the
spell
will
be
broken
,
or
no
mortal
can
break
it
.
*NL*
If
it
break
,
all
will
know
it
,
for
you
will
see
the
sacred
water
*NL*
gush
from
the
chapel
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stood
a
few
moments
,
to
let
the
hearers
have
a
chance
to
spread
*NL*
my
announcement
to
those
who
could
n't
hear
,
and
so
convey
it
*NL*
to
the
furthest
ranks
,
then
I
made
a
grand
exhibition
of
extra
*NL*
posturing
and
gesturing
,
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lo
,
I
command
the
fell
spirit
that
possesses
the
holy
fountain
*NL*
to
now
disgorge
into
the
skies
all
the
infernal
fires
that
still
*NL*
remain
in
him
,
and
straightway
dissolve
his
spell
and
flee
hence
*NL*
to
the
pit
,
there
to
lie
bound
a
thousand
years
.
By
his
own
dread
*NL*
name
I
command
it
--
BGWJJILLIGKKK
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
touched
off
the
hogshead
of
rockets
,
and
a
vast
fountain
of
*NL*
dazzling
lances
of
fire
vomited
itself
toward
the
zenith
with
a
*NL*
hissing
rush
,
and
burst
in
mid-sky
into
a
storm
of
flashing
jewels
!
*NL*
One
mighty
groan
of
terror
started
up
from
the
massed
people
*NL*
--
then
suddenly
broke
into
a
wild
hosannah
of
joy
--
for
there
,
fair
*NL*
and
plain
in
the
uncanny
glare
,
they
saw
the
freed
water
leaping
*NL*
forth
!
The
old
abbot
could
not
speak
a
word
,
for
tears
and
the
*NL*
chokings
in
his
throat
;
without
utterance
of
any
sort
,
he
folded
me
*NL*
in
his
arms
and
mashed
me
.
It
was
more
eloquent
than
speech
.
*NL*
And
harder
to
get
over
,
too
,
in
a
country
where
there
were
really
*NL*
no
doctors
that
were
worth
a
damaged
nickel
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
should
have
seen
those
acres
of
people
throw
themselves
down
*NL*
in
that
water
and
kiss
it
;
kiss
it
,
and
pet
it
,
and
fondle
it
,
and
*NL*
talk
to
it
as
if
it
were
alive
,
and
welcome
it
back
with
the
dear
*NL*
names
they
gave
their
darlings
,
just
as
if
it
had
been
a
friend
who
*NL*
was
long
gone
away
and
lost
,
and
was
come
home
again
.
Yes
,
it
was
*NL*
pretty
to
see
,
and
made
me
think
more
of
them
than
I
had
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sent
Merlin
home
on
a
shutter
.
He
had
caved
in
and
gone
down
*NL*
like
a
landslide
when
I
pronounced
that
fearful
name
,
and
had
*NL*
never
come
to
since
.
He
never
had
heard
that
name
before
,
--
neither
*NL*
had
I
--
but
to
him
it
was
the
right
one
.
Any
jumble
would
have
*NL*
been
the
right
one
.
He
admitted
,
afterward
,
that
that
spirit
's
own
*NL*
mother
could
not
have
pronounced
that
name
better
than
I
did
.
*NL*
He
never
could
understand
how
I
survived
it
,
and
I
did
n't
tell
*NL*
him
.
It
is
only
young
magicians
that
give
away
a
secret
like
that
.
*NL*
Merlin
spent
three
months
working
enchantments
to
try
to
find
out
*NL*
the
deep
trick
of
how
to
pronounce
that
name
and
outlive
it
.
*NL*
But
he
did
n't
arrive
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
started
to
the
chapel
,
the
populace
uncovered
and
fell
back
*NL*
reverently
to
make
a
wide
way
for
me
,
as
if
I
had
been
some
kind
*NL*
of
a
superior
being
--
and
I
was
.
I
was
aware
of
that
.
I
took
along
*NL*
a
night
shift
of
monks
,
and
taught
them
the
mystery
of
the
pump
,
*NL*
and
set
them
to
work
,
for
it
was
plain
that
a
good
part
of
the
*NL*
people
out
there
were
going
to
sit
up
with
the
water
all
night
,
*NL*
consequently
it
was
but
right
that
they
should
have
all
they
wanted
*NL*
of
it
.
To
those
monks
that
pump
was
a
good
deal
of
a
miracle
*NL*
itself
,
and
they
were
full
of
wonder
over
it
;
and
of
admiration
,
*NL*
too
,
of
the
exceeding
effectiveness
of
its
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
great
night
,
an
immense
night
.
There
was
reputation
in
it
.
*NL*
I
could
hardly
get
to
sleep
for
glorying
over
it
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
A
RIVAL
MAGICIAN
*NL*
*NL*
My
influence
in
the
Valley
of
Holiness
was
something
prodigious
*NL*
now
.
It
seemed
worth
while
to
try
to
turn
it
to
some
valuable
*NL*
account
.
The
thought
came
to
me
the
next
morning
,
and
was
suggested
*NL*
by
my
seeing
one
of
my
knights
who
was
in
the
soap
line
come
*NL*
riding
in
.
According
to
history
,
the
monks
of
this
place
two
*NL*
centuries
before
had
been
worldly
minded
enough
to
want
to
wash
.
*NL*
It
might
be
that
there
was
a
leaven
of
this
unrighteousness
still
*NL*
remaining
.
So
I
sounded
a
Brother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
you
like
a
bath
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
at
the
thought
--
the
thought
of
the
peril
of
it
to
*NL*
the
well
--
but
he
said
with
feeling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
needs
not
to
ask
that
of
a
poor
body
who
has
not
known
that
*NL*
blessed
refreshment
sith
that
he
was
a
boy
.
Would
God
I
might
*NL*
wash
me
!
but
it
may
not
be
,
fair
sir
,
tempt
me
not
;
it
is
forbidden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
sighed
in
such
a
sorrowful
way
that
I
was
resolved
*NL*
he
should
have
at
least
one
layer
of
his
real
estate
removed
,
*NL*
if
it
sized
up
my
whole
influence
and
bankrupted
the
pile
.
So
I
*NL*
went
to
the
abbot
and
asked
for
a
permit
for
this
Brother
.
He
*NL*
blenched
at
the
idea
--
I
do
n't
mean
that
you
could
see
him
blench
,
*NL*
for
of
course
you
could
n't
see
it
without
you
scraped
him
,
and
*NL*
I
did
n't
care
enough
about
it
to
scrape
him
,
but
I
knew
the
blench
*NL*
was
there
,
just
the
same
,
and
within
a
book-cover
's
thickness
of
*NL*
the
surface
,
too
--
blenched
,
and
trembled
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
son
,
ask
aught
else
thou
wilt
,
and
it
is
thine
,
and
freely
*NL*
granted
out
of
a
grateful
heart
--
but
this
,
oh
,
this
!
Would
you
*NL*
drive
away
the
blessed
water
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Father
,
I
will
not
drive
it
away
.
I
have
mysterious
knowledge
*NL*
which
teaches
me
that
there
was
an
error
that
other
time
when
*NL*
it
was
thought
the
institution
of
the
bath
banished
the
fountain
.
''
*NL*
A
large
interest
began
to
show
up
in
the
old
man
's
face
.
``
My
*NL*
knowledge
informs
me
that
the
bath
was
innocent
of
that
misfortune
,
*NL*
which
was
caused
by
quite
another
sort
of
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
brave
words
--
but
--
but
right
welcome
,
if
they
be
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
true
,
indeed
.
Let
me
build
the
bath
again
,
Father
.
*NL*
Let
me
build
it
again
,
and
the
fountain
shall
flow
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promise
this
?
--
you
promise
it
?
Say
the
word
--
say
you
promise
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
promise
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
will
I
have
the
first
bath
myself
!
Go
--
get
ye
to
your
work
.
*NL*
Tarry
not
,
tarry
not
,
but
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
and
my
boys
were
at
work
,
straight
off
.
The
ruins
of
the
old
*NL*
bath
were
there
yet
in
the
basement
of
the
monastery
,
not
a
stone
*NL*
missing
.
They
had
been
left
just
so
,
all
these
lifetimes
,
and
*NL*
avoided
with
a
pious
fear
,
as
things
accursed
.
In
two
days
we
*NL*
had
it
all
done
and
the
water
in
--
a
spacious
pool
of
clear
pure
*NL*
water
that
a
body
could
swim
in
.
It
was
running
water
,
too
.
*NL*
It
came
in
,
and
went
out
,
through
the
ancient
pipes
.
The
old
abbot
*NL*
kept
his
word
,
and
was
the
first
to
try
it
.
He
went
down
black
*NL*
and
shaky
,
leaving
the
whole
black
community
above
troubled
and
*NL*
worried
and
full
of
bodings
;
but
he
came
back
white
and
joyful
,
*NL*
and
the
game
was
made
!
another
triumph
scored
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
good
campaign
that
we
made
in
that
Valley
of
Holiness
,
*NL*
and
I
was
very
well
satisfied
,
and
ready
to
move
on
now
,
but
*NL*
I
struck
a
disappointment
.
I
caught
a
heavy
cold
,
and
it
started
*NL*
up
an
old
lurking
rheumatism
of
mine
.
Of
course
the
rheumatism
*NL*
hunted
up
my
weakest
place
and
located
itself
there
.
This
was
*NL*
the
place
where
the
abbot
put
his
arms
about
me
and
mashed
me
,
what
*NL*
time
he
was
moved
to
testify
his
gratitude
to
me
with
an
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
last
I
got
out
,
I
was
a
shadow
.
But
everybody
was
full
*NL*
of
attentions
and
kindnesses
,
and
these
brought
cheer
back
into
*NL*
my
life
,
and
were
the
right
medicine
to
help
a
convalescent
swiftly
*NL*
up
toward
health
and
strength
again
;
so
I
gained
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sandy
was
worn
out
with
nursing
;
so
I
made
up
my
mind
to
turn
out
*NL*
and
go
a
cruise
alone
,
leaving
her
at
the
nunnery
to
rest
up
.
*NL*
My
idea
was
to
disguise
myself
as
a
freeman
of
peasant
degree
*NL*
and
wander
through
the
country
a
week
or
two
on
foot
.
This
would
*NL*
give
me
a
chance
to
eat
and
lodge
with
the
lowliest
and
poorest
*NL*
class
of
free
citizens
on
equal
terms
.
There
was
no
other
way
*NL*
to
inform
myself
perfectly
of
their
everyday
life
and
the
operation
*NL*
of
the
laws
upon
it
.
If
I
went
among
them
as
a
gentleman
,
there
*NL*
would
be
restraints
and
conventionalities
which
would
shut
me
out
*NL*
from
their
private
joys
and
troubles
,
and
I
should
get
no
further
*NL*
than
the
outside
shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
I
was
out
on
a
long
walk
to
get
up
muscle
for
my
trip
,
*NL*
and
had
climbed
the
ridge
which
bordered
the
northern
extremity
*NL*
of
the
valley
,
when
I
came
upon
an
artificial
opening
in
the
face
*NL*
of
a
low
precipice
,
and
recognized
it
by
its
location
as
a
hermitage
*NL*
which
had
often
been
pointed
out
to
me
from
a
distance
as
the
den
*NL*
of
a
hermit
of
high
renown
for
dirt
and
austerity
.
I
knew
he
had
*NL*
lately
been
offered
a
situation
in
the
Great
Sahara
,
where
lions
*NL*
and
sandflies
made
the
hermit-life
peculiarly
attractive
and
*NL*
difficult
,
and
had
gone
to
Africa
to
take
possession
,
so
I
thought
*NL*
I
would
look
in
and
see
how
the
atmosphere
of
this
den
agreed
*NL*
with
its
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
surprise
was
great
:
the
place
was
newly
swept
and
scoured
.
*NL*
Then
there
was
another
surprise
.
Back
in
the
gloom
of
the
cavern
*NL*
I
heard
the
clink
of
a
little
bell
,
and
then
this
exclamation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
Central
!
Is
this
you
,
Camelot
?
--
Behold
,
thou
mayst
glad
*NL*
thy
heart
an
thou
hast
faith
to
believe
the
wonderful
when
that
*NL*
it
cometh
in
unexpected
guise
and
maketh
itself
manifest
in
*NL*
impossible
places
--
here
standeth
in
the
flesh
his
mightiness
*NL*
The
Boss
,
and
with
thine
own
ears
shall
ye
hear
him
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
what
a
radical
reversal
of
things
this
was
;
what
a
jumbling
*NL*
together
of
extravagant
incongruities
;
what
a
fantastic
conjunction
*NL*
of
opposites
and
irreconcilables
--
the
home
of
the
bogus
miracle
*NL*
become
the
home
of
a
real
one
,
the
den
of
a
mediaeval
hermit
turned
*NL*
into
a
telephone
office
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
telephone
clerk
stepped
into
the
light
,
and
I
recognized
one
*NL*
of
my
young
fellows
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
this
office
been
established
here
,
Ulfius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
since
midnight
,
fair
Sir
Boss
,
an
it
please
you
.
We
saw
many
*NL*
lights
in
the
valley
,
and
so
judged
it
well
to
make
a
station
,
*NL*
for
that
where
so
many
lights
be
needs
must
they
indicate
a
town
*NL*
of
goodly
size
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
.
It
is
n't
a
town
in
the
customary
sense
,
but
it
's
*NL*
a
good
stand
,
anyway
.
Do
you
know
where
you
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
I
have
had
no
time
to
make
inquiry
;
for
whenas
my
*NL*
comradeship
moved
hence
upon
their
labors
,
leaving
me
in
charge
,
*NL*
I
got
me
to
needed
rest
,
purposing
to
inquire
when
I
waked
,
and
*NL*
report
the
place
's
name
to
Camelot
for
record
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
the
Valley
of
Holiness
.

*NL*
*NL*
It
did
n't
take
;
I
mean
,
he
did
n't
start
at
the
name
,
as
I
had
*NL*
supposed
he
would
.
He
merely
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
so
report
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
surrounding
regions

filled

a
telephone
,
anyway

It
is
the
very
*NL*
demon
for
conveying
similarities
of
sound

are
miracles
of
*NL*
divergence
from
similarity
of
sense

But
no

*NL*
the
name
of
the
place
now

Call
up

*NL*
*NL*
He
did
it
,
and
had
Clarence
sent
for
.
It
was
good
to
hear
my
boy
's
*NL*
voice
again
.
It
was
like
being
home
.
After
some
affectionate
*NL*
interchanges
,
and
some
account
of
my
late
illness
,
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
new
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
and

many

pious

themselves

me
likewise

was
I
that
made
selection
of
those
flames

from
out
our

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Mid-afternoon

Prithee

you
with

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
sounded
good
!
In
this
atmosphere
of
telephones
and
lightning
*NL*
communication
with
distant
regions
,
I
was
breathing
the
breath
*NL*
of
life
again
after
long
suffocation
.
I
realized
,
then
,
what
a
*NL*
creepy
,
dull
,
inanimate
horror
this
land
had
been
to
me
all
these
*NL*
years
,
and
how
I
had
been
in
such
a
stifled
condition
of
mind
as
*NL*
to
have
grown
used
to
it
almost
beyond
the
power
to
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gave
my
order
to
the
superintendent
of
the
Academy
personally
.
*NL*
I
also
asked
him
to
bring
me
some
paper
and
a
fountain
pen
and
*NL*
a
box
or
so
of
safety
matches
.
I
was
getting
tired
of
doing
*NL*
without
these
conveniences
.
I
could
have
them
now
,
as
I
was
n't
*NL*
going
to
wear
armor
any
more
at
present
,
and
therefore
could
get
*NL*
at
my
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
back
to
the
monastery
,
I
found
a
thing
of
interest
*NL*
going
on
.
The
abbot
and
his
monks
were
assembled
in
the
great
*NL*
hall
,
observing
with
childish
wonder
and
faith
the
performances
*NL*
of
a
new
magician
,
a
fresh
arrival
.
His
dress
was
the
extreme
of
*NL*
the
fantastic
;
as
showy
and
foolish
as
the
sort
of
thing
an
Indian
*NL*
medicine-man
wears
.
He
was
mowing
,
and
mumbling
,
and
gesticulating
,
*NL*
and
drawing
mystical
figures
in
the
air
and
on
the
floor
,
--
the
*NL*
regular
thing
,
you
know
.
He
was
a
celebrity
from
Asia
--
so
he
*NL*
said
,
and
that
was
enough
.
That
sort
of
evidence
was
as
good
*NL*
as
gold
,
and
passed
current
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
easy
and
cheap
it
was
to
be
a
great
magician
on
this
fellow
's
*NL*
terms
.
His
specialty
was
to
tell
you
what
any
individual
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
globe
was
doing
at
the
moment
;
and
what
he
had
done
*NL*
at
any
time
in
the
past
,
and
what
he
would
do
at
any
time
in
the
*NL*
future
.
He
asked
if
any
would
like
to
know
what
the
Emperor
of
*NL*
the
East
was
doing
now
?
The
sparkling
eyes
and
the
delighted
rubbing
*NL*
of
hands
made
eloquent
answer
--
this
reverend
crowd
_
would
_
like
to
*NL*
know
what
that
monarch
was
at
,
just
as
this
moment
.
The
fraud
*NL*
went
through
some
more
mummery
,
and
then
made
grave
announcement
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
high
and
mighty
Emperor
of
the
East
doth
at
this
moment
put
*NL*
money
in
the
palm
of
a
holy
begging
friar
--
one
,
two
,
three
pieces
,
*NL*
and
they
be
all
of
silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
buzz
of
admiring
exclamations
broke
out
,
all
around
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
marvelous
!
''
``
Wonderful
!
''
``
What
study
,
what
labor
,
to
have
*NL*
acquired
a
so
amazing
power
as
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Would
they
like
to
know
what
the
Supreme
Lord
of
Inde
was
doing
?
*NL*
Yes
.
He
told
them
what
the
Supreme
Lord
of
Inde
was
doing
.
Then
*NL*
he
told
them
what
the
Sultan
of
Egypt
was
at
;
also
what
the
King
*NL*
of
the
Remote
Seas
was
about
.
And
so
on
and
so
on
;
and
with
each
*NL*
new
marvel
the
astonishment
at
his
accuracy
rose
higher
and
higher
.
*NL*
They
thought
he
must
surely
strike
an
uncertain
place
some
time
;
*NL*
but
no
,
he
never
had
to
hesitate
,
he
always
knew
,
and
always
with
*NL*
unerring
precision
.
I
saw
that
if
this
thing
went
on
I
should
lose
*NL*
my
supremacy
,
this
fellow
would
capture
my
following
,
I
should
*NL*
be
left
out
in
the
cold
.
I
must
put
a
cog
in
his
wheel
,
and
do
it
*NL*
right
away
,
too
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
might
ask
,
I
should
very
greatly
like
to
know
what
a
certain
*NL*
person
is
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
and
freely
.
I
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
difficult
--
perhaps
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
art
knoweth
not
that
word
.
The
more
difficult
it
is
,
the
more
*NL*
certainly
will
I
reveal
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
I
was
working
up
the
interest
.
It
was
getting
pretty
*NL*
high
,
too
;
you
could
see
that
by
the
craning
necks
all
around
,
*NL*
and
the
half-suspended
breathing
.
So
now
I
climaxed
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
make
no
mistake
--
if
you
tell
me
truly
what
I
want
to
*NL*
know
--
I
will
give
you
two
hundred
silver
pennies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fortune
is
mine
!
I
will
tell
you
what
you
would
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
tell
me
what
I
am
doing
with
my
right
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah-h
!
''
There
was
a
general
gasp
of
surprise
.
It
had
not
occurred
*NL*
to
anybody
in
the
crowd
--
that
simple
trick
of
inquiring
about
*NL*
somebody
who
was
n't
ten
thousand
miles
away
.
The
magician
was
*NL*
hit
hard
;
it
was
an
emergency
that
had
never
happened
in
his
*NL*
experience
before
,
and
it
corked
him
;
he
did
n't
know
how
to
meet
*NL*
it
.
He
looked
stunned
,
confused
;
he
could
n't
say
a
word
.
``
Come
,
''
*NL*
I
said
,
``
what
are
you
waiting
for
?
Is
it
possible
you
can
answer
up
,
*NL*
right
off
,
and
tell
what
anybody
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
is
*NL*
doing
,
and
yet
ca
n't
tell
what
a
person
is
doing
who
is
n't
three
*NL*
yards
from
you
?
Persons
behind
me
know
what
I
am
doing
with
my
*NL*
right
hand
--
they
will
indorse
you
if
you
tell
correctly
.
''
He
was
*NL*
still
dumb
.
``
Very
well
,
I
'll
tell
you
why
you
do
n't
speak
up
and
*NL*
tell
;
it
is
because
you
do
n't
know
.
_
You
_
a
magician
!
Good
friends
,
*NL*
this
tramp
is
a
mere
fraud
and
liar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
distressed
the
monks
and
terrified
them
.
They
were
not
used
*NL*
to
hearing
these
awful
beings
called
names
,
and
they
did
not
know
*NL*
what
might
be
the
consequence
.
There
was
a
dead
silence
now
;
*NL*
superstitious
bodings
were
in
every
mind
.
The
magician
began
to
*NL*
pull
his
wits
together
,
and
when
he
presently
smiled
an
easy
,
*NL*
nonchalant
smile
,
it
spread
a
mighty
relief
around
;
for
it
indicated
*NL*
that
his
mood
was
not
destructive
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
hath
struck
me
speechless
,
the
frivolity
of
this
person
's
*NL*
speech
.
Let
all
know
,
if
perchance
there
be
any
who
know
it
not
,
*NL*
that
enchanters
of
my
degree
deign
not
to
concern
themselves
with
*NL*
the
doings
of
any
but
kings
,
princes
,
emperors
,
them
that
be
born
*NL*
in
the
purple
and
them
only
.
Had
ye
asked
me
what
Arthur
the
great
*NL*
king
is
doing
,
it
were
another
matter
,
and
I
had
told
ye
;
but
the
*NL*
doings
of
a
subject
interest
me
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
misunderstood
you
.
I
thought
you
said
`
anybody
,
'
and
so
*NL*
I
supposed
`
anybody
'
included
--
well
,
anybody
;
that
is
,
everybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
doth
--
anybody
that
is
of
lofty
birth
;
and
the
better
if
*NL*
he
be
royal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
it
meseemeth
,
might
well
be
,
''
said
the
abbot
,
who
saw
his
*NL*
opportunity
to
smooth
things
and
avert
disaster
,
``
for
it
were
not
*NL*
likely
that
so
wonderful
a
gift
as
this
would
be
conferred
for
*NL*
the
revelation
of
the
concerns
of
lesser
beings
than
such
as
be
*NL*
born
near
to
the
summits
of
greatness
.
Our
Arthur
the
king
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
know
of
him
?
''
broke
in
the
enchanter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
gladly
,
yea
,
and
gratefully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
full
of
awe
and
interest
again
right
away
,
the
*NL*
incorrigible
idiots
.
They
watched
the
incantations
absorbingly
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
me
with
a
``
There
,
now
,
what
can
you
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
air
,
when
the
announcement
came
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
is
weary
with
the
chase
,
and
lieth
in
his
palace
these
*NL*
two
hours
sleeping
a
dreamless
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
's
benison
upon
him
!
''
said
the
abbot
,
and
crossed
himself
;
*NL*
``
may
that
sleep
be
to
the
refreshment
of
his
body
and
his
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
might
be
,
if
he
were
sleeping
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
the
king
*NL*
is
not
sleeping
,
the
king
rides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
trouble
again
--
a
conflict
of
authority
.
Nobody
knew
which
*NL*
of
us
to
believe
;
I
still
had
some
reputation
left
.
The
magician
's
*NL*
scorn
was
stirred
,
and
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lo
,
I
have
seen
many
wonderful
soothsayers
and
prophets
and
*NL*
magicians
in
my
life
days
,
but
none
before
that
could
sit
idle
and
*NL*
see
to
the
heart
of
things
with
never
an
incantation
to
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
lived
in
the
woods
,
and
lost
much
by
it
.
I
use
incantations
*NL*
myself
,
as
this
good
brotherhood
are
aware
--
but
only
on
occasions
*NL*
of
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
comes
to
sarcasming
,
I
reckon
I
know
how
to
keep
my
end
up
.
*NL*
That
jab
made
this
fellow
squirm
.
The
abbot
inquired
after
the
*NL*
queen
and
the
court
,
and
got
this
information
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
be
all
on
sleep
,
being
overcome
by
fatigue
,
like
as
to
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
merely
another
lie
.
Half
of
them
are
about
their
amusements
,
*NL*
the
queen
and
the
other
half
are
not
sleeping
,
they
ride
.
Now
*NL*
perhaps
you
can
spread
yourself
a
little
,
and
tell
us
where
the
king
*NL*
and
queen
and
all
that
are
this
moment
riding
with
them
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
sleep
now
,
as
I
said
;
but
on
the
morrow
they
will
ride
,
*NL*
for
they
go
a
journey
toward
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
will
they
be
the
day
after
to-morrow
at
vespers
?

by

''
*NL*
*NL*
_
That
_
was
a
noble
shot
!
It
set
the
abbot
and
the
monks
in
a
whirl
*NL*
of
excitement
,
and
it
rocked
the
enchanter
to
his
base
.
I
followed
*NL*
the
thing
right
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
king
does
not
arrive
,
I
will
have
myself

:
*NL*
if
he
does
I
will
ride
you
on
a
rail
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
I
went
up
to
the
telephone
office
and
found
that
the
king
*NL*
had
passed
through
two
towns
that
were
on
the
line
.
I
spotted
*NL*
his
progress
on
the
succeeding
day
in
the
same
way
.
I
kept
these
*NL*
matters
to
myself
.
The
third
day
's
reports
showed
that
if
he
*NL*
kept
up
his
gait
he
would
arrive
by
four
in
the
afternoon
.
There
*NL*
was
still
no
sign
anywhere
of
interest
in
his
coming
;
there
seemed
*NL*
to
be
no
preparations
making
to
receive
him
in
state
;
a
strange
*NL*
thing
,
truly
.
Only
one
thing
could
explain
this
:
that
other
*NL*
magician
had
been
cutting
under
me
,
sure
.
This
was
true
.
I
asked
*NL*
a
friend
of
mine
,
a
monk
,
about
it
,
and
he
said
,
yes
,
the
magician
*NL*
had
tried
some
further
enchantments
and
found
out
that
the
court
*NL*
had
concluded
to
make
no
journey
at
all
,
but
stay
at
home
.
Think
*NL*
of
that
!
Observe
how
much
a
reputation
was
worth
in
such
a
country
.
*NL*
These
people
had
seen
me
do
the
very
showiest
bit
of
magic
in
*NL*
history
,
and
the
only
one
within
their
memory
that
had
a
positive
*NL*
value
,
and
yet
here
they
were
,
ready
to
take
up
with
an
adventurer
*NL*
who
could
offer
no
evidence
of
his
powers
but
his
mere
unproven
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
was
not
good
politics
to
let
the
king
come
without
*NL*
any
fuss
and
feathers
at
all
,
so
I
went
down
and
drummed
up
a
*NL*
procession
of
pilgrims
and
smoked
out
a
batch
of
hermits
and
*NL*
started
them
out
at
two
o'clock
to
meet
him
.
And
that
was
the
*NL*
sort
of
state
he
arrived
in
.
The
abbot
was
helpless
with
rage
*NL*
and
humiliation
when
I
brought
him
out
on
a
balcony
and
showed
*NL*
him
the
head
of
the
state
marching
in
and
never
a
monk
on
hand
to
*NL*
offer
him
welcome
,
and
no
stir
of
life
or
clang
of
joy-bell
to
glad
*NL*
his
spirit
.
He
took
one
look
and
then
flew
to
rouse
out
his
forces
.
*NL*
The
next
minute
the
bells
were
dinning
furiously
,
and
the
various
*NL*
buildings
were
vomiting
monks
and
nuns
,
who
went
swarming
in
a
*NL*
rush
toward
the
coming
procession
;
and
with
them
went
that
magician
*NL*
--
and
he
was
on
a
rail
,
too
,
by
the
abbot
's
order
;
and
his
reputation
*NL*
was
in
the
mud
,
and
mine
was
in
the
sky
again
.
Yes
,
a
man
can
*NL*
keep
his
trademark
current
in
such
a
country
,
but
he
ca
n't
sit
*NL*
around
and
do
it
;
he
has
got
to
be
on
deck
and
attending
to
business
*NL*
right
along
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
A
COMPETITIVE
EXAMINATION
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
king
traveled
for
change
of
air
,
or
made
a
progress
,
or
*NL*
visited
a
distant
noble
whom
he
wished
to
bankrupt
with
the
cost
*NL*
of
his
keep
,
part
of
the
administration
moved
with
him
.
It
was
*NL*
a
fashion
of
the
time
.
The
Commission
charged
with
the
examination
*NL*
of
candidates
for
posts
in
the
army
came
with
the
king
to
the
*NL*
Valley
,
whereas
they
could
have
transacted
their
business
just
*NL*
as
well
at
home
.
And
although
this
expedition
was
strictly
a
*NL*
holiday
excursion
for
the
king
,
he
kept
some
of
his
business
*NL*
functions
going
just
the
same
.
He
touched
for
the
evil
,
as
usual
;
*NL*
he
held
court
in
the
gate
at
sunrise
and
tried
cases
,
for
he
was
*NL*
himself
Chief
Justice
of
the
King
's
Bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shone
very
well
in
this
latter
office
.
He
was
a
wise
and
humane
*NL*
judge
,
and
he
clearly
did
his
honest
best
and
fairest
,
--
according
*NL*
to
his
lights
.
That
is
a
large
reservation
.
His
lights
--
I
mean
*NL*
his
rearing
--
often
colored
his
decisions
.
Whenever
there
was
a
*NL*
dispute
between
a
noble
or
gentleman
and
a
person
of
lower
degree
,
*NL*
the
king
's
leanings
and
sympathies
were
for
the
former
class
always
,
*NL*
whether
he
suspected
it
or
not
.
It
was
impossible
that
this
should
*NL*
be
otherwise
.
The
blunting
effects
of
slavery
upon
the
slaveholder
's
*NL*
moral
perceptions
are
known
and
conceded
,
the
world
over
;
and
a
*NL*
privileged
class
,
an
aristocracy
,
is
but
a
band
of
slaveholders
*NL*
under
another
name
.
This
has
a
harsh
sound
,
and
yet
should
not
*NL*
be
offensive
to
any
--
even
to
the
noble
himself
--
unless
the
fact
*NL*
itself
be
an
offense
:
for
the
statement
simply
formulates
a
fact
.
*NL*
The
repulsive
feature
of
slavery
is
the
_
thing
_
,
not
its
name
.
One
*NL*
needs
but
to
hear
an
aristocrat
speak
of
the
classes
that
are
below
*NL*
him
to
recognize
--
and
in
but
indifferently
modified
measure
*NL*
--
the
very
air
and
tone
of
the
actual
slaveholder
;
and
behind
these
*NL*
are
the
slaveholder
's
spirit
,
the
slaveholder
's
blunted
feeling
.
*NL*
They
are
the
result
of
the
same
cause
in
both
cases
:
the
possessor
's
*NL*
old
and
inbred
custom
of
regarding
himself
as
a
superior
being
.
*NL*
The
king
's
judgments
wrought
frequent
injustices
,
but
it
was
merely
*NL*
the
fault
of
his
training
,
his
natural
and
unalterable
sympathies
.
*NL*
He
was
as
unfitted
for
a
judgeship
as
would
be
the
average
mother
*NL*
for
the
position
of
milk-distributor
to
starving
children
in
*NL*
famine-time
;
her
own
children
would
fare
a
shade
better
than
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
very
curious
case
came
before
the
king
.
A
young
girl
,
an
*NL*
orphan
,
who
had
a
considerable
estate
,
married
a
fine
young
fellow
*NL*
who
had
nothing
.
The
girl
's
property
was
within
a
seigniory
held
*NL*
by
the
Church
.
The
bishop
of
the
diocese
,
an
arrogant
scion
of
*NL*
the
great
nobility
,
claimed
the
girl
's
estate
on
the
ground
that
*NL*
she
had
married
privately
,
and
thus
had
cheated
the
Church
out
*NL*
of
one
of
its
rights
as
lord
of
the
seigniory
--
the
one
heretofore
*NL*
referred
to
as
le
droit
du
seigneur
.
The
penalty
of
refusal
or
*NL*
avoidance
was
confiscation
.
The
girl
's
defense
was
,
that
the
*NL*
lordship
of
the
seigniory
was
vested
in
the
bishop
,
and
the
*NL*
particular
right
here
involved
was
not
transferable
,
but
must
be
*NL*
exercised
by
the
lord
himself
or
stand
vacated
;
and
that
an
older
*NL*
law
,
of
the
Church
itself
,
strictly
barred
the
bishop
from
exercising
*NL*
it
.
It
was
a
very
odd
case
,
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
reminded
me
of
something
I
had
read
in
my
youth
about
the
*NL*
ingenious
way
in
which
the
aldermen
of
London
raised
the
money
*NL*
that
built
the
Mansion
House
.
A
person
who
had
not
taken
the
*NL*
Sacrament
according
to
the
Anglican
rite
could
not
stand
as
a
*NL*
candidate
for
sheriff
of
London
.
Thus
Dissenters
were
ineligible
;
*NL*
they
could
not
run
if
asked
,
they
could
not
serve
if
elected
.
*NL*
The
aldermen
,
who
without
any
question
were
Yankees
in
disguise
,
*NL*
hit
upon
this
neat
device
:
they
passed
a
by-law
imposing
a
fine
*NL*
of
L400
upon
any
one
who
should
refuse
to
be
a
candidate
for
*NL*
sheriff
,
and
a
fine
of
L600
upon
any
person
who
,
after
being
*NL*
elected
sheriff
,
refused
to
serve
.
Then
they
went
to
work
and
*NL*
elected
a
lot
of
Dissenters
,
one
after
another
,
and
kept
it
up
*NL*
until
they
had
collected
L15
,000
in
fines
;
and
there
stands
the
*NL*
stately
Mansion
House
to
this
day
,
to
keep
the
blushing
citizen
*NL*
in
mind
of
a
long
past
and
lamented
day
when
a
band
of
Yankees
*NL*
slipped
into
London
and
played
games
of
the
sort
that
has
given
*NL*
their
race
a
unique
and
shady
reputation
among
all
truly
good
*NL*
and
holy
peoples
that
be
in
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
case
seemed
strong
to
me
;
the
bishop
's
case
was
just
*NL*
as
strong
.
I
did
not
see
how
the
king
was
going
to
get
out
of
*NL*
this
hole
.
But
he
got
out
.
I
append
his
decision
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
I
find
small
difficulty
here
,
the
matter
being
even
a
*NL*
child
's
affair
for
simpleness
.
An
the
young
bride
had
conveyed
*NL*
notice
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
to
her
feudal
lord
and
proper
master
*NL*
and
protector
the
bishop
,
she
had
suffered
no
loss
,
for
the
said
*NL*
bishop
could
have
got
a
dispensation
making
him
,
for
temporary
*NL*
conveniency
,
eligible
to
the
exercise
of
his
said
right
,
and
thus
*NL*
would
she
have
kept
all
she
had
.
Whereas
,
failing
in
her
first
*NL*
duty
,
she
hath
by
that
failure
failed
in
all
;
for
whoso
,
clinging
*NL*
to
a
rope
,
severeth
it
above
his
hands
,
must
fall
;
it
being
no
*NL*
defense
to
claim
that
the
rest
of
the
rope
is
sound
,
neither
any
*NL*
deliverance
from
his
peril
,
as
he
shall
find
.
Pardy
,
the
woman
's
*NL*
case
is
rotten
at
the
source
.
It
is
the
decree
of
the
court
that
*NL*
she
forfeit
to
the
said
lord
bishop
all
her
goods
,
even
to
the
*NL*
last
farthing
that
she
doth
possess
,
and
be
thereto
mulcted
in
*NL*
the
costs
.
Next

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
tragic
end
to
a
beautiful
honeymoon
not
yet
three
months
*NL*
old
.
Poor
young
creatures
!
They
had
lived
these
three
months
*NL*
lapped
to
the
lips
in
worldly
comforts
.
These
clothes
and
trinkets
*NL*
they
were
wearing
were
as
fine
and
dainty
as
the
shrewdest
stretch
*NL*
of
the
sumptuary
laws
allowed
to
people
of
their
degree
;
and
in
*NL*
these
pretty
clothes
,
she
crying
on
his
shoulder
,
and
he
trying
*NL*
to
comfort
her
with
hopeful
words
set
to
the
music
of
despair
,
*NL*
they
went
from
the
judgment
seat
out
into
the
world
homeless
,
*NL*
bedless
,
breadless
;
why
,
the
very
beggars
by
the
roadsides
were
*NL*
not
so
poor
as
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
king
was
out
of
the
hole
;
and
on
terms
satisfactory
to
*NL*
the
Church
and
the
rest
of
the
aristocracy
,
no
doubt
.
Men
write
*NL*
many
fine
and
plausible
arguments
in
support
of
monarchy
,
but
*NL*
the
fact
remains
that
where
every
man
in
a
State
has
a
vote
,
brutal
*NL*
laws
are
impossible
.
Arthur
's
people
were
of
course
poor
material
*NL*
for
a
republic
,
because
they
had
been
debased
so
long
by
monarchy
;
*NL*
and
yet
even
they
would
have
been
intelligent
enough
to
make
short
*NL*
work
of
that
law
which
the
king
had
just
been
administering
if
it
*NL*
had
been
submitted
to
their
full
and
free
vote
.
There
is
a
phrase
*NL*
which
has
grown
so
common
in
the
world
's
mouth
that
it
has
come
*NL*
to
seem
to
have
sense
and
meaning
--
the
sense
and
meaning
implied
*NL*
when
it
is
used
;
that
is
the
phrase
which
refers
to
this
or
that
or
*NL*
the
other
nation
as
possibly
being
``
capable
of
self-government
''
;
*NL*
and
the
implied
sense
of
it
is
,
that
there
has
been
a
nation
*NL*
somewhere
,
some
time
or
other
which
_
was
n't
_
capable
of
it
--
was
n't
as
*NL*
able
to
govern
itself
as
some
self-appointed
specialists
were
or
*NL*
would
be
to
govern
it
.
The
master
minds
of
all
nations
,
in
all
*NL*
ages
,
have
sprung
in
affluent
multitude
from
the
mass
of
the
nation
,
*NL*
and
from
the
mass
of
the
nation
only
--
not
from
its
privileged
*NL*
classes
;
and
so
,
no
matter
what
the
nation
's
intellectual
grade
*NL*
was
;
whether
high
or
low
,
the
bulk
of
its
ability
was
in
the
long
*NL*
ranks
of
its
nameless
and
its
poor
,
and
so
it
never
saw
the
day
*NL*
that
it
had
not
the
material
in
abundance
whereby
to
govern
itself
.
*NL*
Which
is
to
assert
an
always
self-proven
fact
:
that
even
the
best
*NL*
governed
and
most
free
and
most
enlightened
monarchy
is
still
*NL*
behind
the
best
condition
attainable
by
its
people
;
and
that
the
*NL*
same
is
true
of
kindred
governments
of
lower
grades
,
all
the
way
*NL*
down
to
the
lowest
.
*NL*
*NL*
King
Arthur
had
hurried
up
the
army
business
altogether
beyond
*NL*
my
calculations
.
I
had
not
supposed
he
would
move
in
the
matter
*NL*
while
I
was
away
;
and
so
I
had
not
mapped
out
a
scheme
for
determining
*NL*
the
merits
of
officers
;
I
had
only
remarked
that
it
would
be
wise
*NL*
to
submit
every
candidate
to
a
sharp
and
searching
examination
;
*NL*
and
privately
I
meant
to
put
together
a
list
of
military
qualifications
*NL*
that
nobody
could
answer
to
but
my
West
Pointers
.
That
ought
*NL*
to
have
been
attended
to
before
I
left
;
for
the
king
was
so
taken
*NL*
with
the
idea
of
a
standing
army
that
he
could
n't
wait
but
must
*NL*
get
about
it
at
once
,
and
get
up
as
good
a
scheme
of
examination
*NL*
as
he
could
invent
out
of
his
own
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
impatient
to
see
what
this
was
;
and
to
show
,
too
,
how
much
*NL*
more
admirable
was
the
one
which
I
should
display
to
the
Examining
*NL*
Board
.
I
intimated
this
,
gently
,
to
the
king
,
and
it
fired
his
*NL*
curiosity
.
When
the
Board
was
assembled
,
I
followed
him
in
;
and
*NL*
behind
us
came
the
candidates
.
One
of
these
candidates
was
a
bright
*NL*
young
West
Pointer
of
mine
,
and
with
him
were
a
couple
of
my
*NL*
West
Point
professors
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
saw
the
Board
,
I
did
not
know
whether
to
cry
or
to
laugh
.
*NL*
The
head
of
it
was
the
officer
known
to
later
centuries
as
Norroy
*NL*
King-at-Arms
!
The
two
other
members
were
chiefs
of
bureaus
in
*NL*
his
department
;
and
all
three
were
priests
,
of
course
;
all
officials
*NL*
who
had
to
know
how
to
read
and
write
were
priests
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
candidate
was
called
first
,
out
of
courtesy
to
me
,
and
the
head
*NL*
of
the
Board
opened
on
him
with
official
solemnity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mal-ease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Son
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weaver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weaver
!
--
God
keep
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
was
staggered
,
from
his
summit
to
his
foundations
;
one
*NL*
clerk
fainted
,
and
the
others
came
near
it
.
The
chairman
pulled
*NL*
himself
together
,
and
said
indignantly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
sufficient
.
Get
you
hence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
appealed
to
the
king
.
I
begged
that
my
candidate
might
be
*NL*
examined
.
The
king
was
willing
,
but
the
Board
,
who
were
all
*NL*
well-born
folk
,
implored
the
king
to
spare
them
the
indignity
of
*NL*
examining
the
weaver
's
son
.
I
knew
they
did
n't
know
enough
to
*NL*
examine
him
anyway
,
so
I
joined
my
prayers
to
theirs
and
the
king
*NL*
turned
the
duty
over
to
my
professors
.
I
had
had
a
blackboard
*NL*
prepared
,
and
it
was
put
up
now
,
and
the
circus
began
.
It
was
*NL*
beautiful
to
hear
the
lad
lay
out
the
science
of
war
,
and
wallow
*NL*
in
details
of
battle
and
siege
,
of
supply
,
transportation
,
mining
*NL*
and
countermining
,
grand
tactics
,
big
strategy
and
little
strategy
,
*NL*
signal
service
,
infantry
,
cavalry
,
artillery
,
and
all
about
siege
*NL*
guns
,
field
guns
,
gatling
guns
,
rifled
guns
,
smooth
bores
,
musket
*NL*
practice
,
revolver
practice
--
and
not
a
solitary
word
of
it
all
*NL*
could
these
catfish
make
head
or
tail
of
,
you
understand
--
and
it
*NL*
was
handsome
to
see
him
chalk
off
mathematical
nightmares
on
the
*NL*
blackboard
that
would
stump
the
angels
themselves
,
and
do
it
like
*NL*
nothing
,
too
--
all
about
eclipses
,
and
comets
,
and
solstices
,
and
*NL*
constellations
,
and
mean
time
,
and
sidereal
time
,
and
dinner
time
,
*NL*
and
bedtime
,
and
every
other
imaginable
thing
above
the
clouds
or
*NL*
under
them
that
you
could
harry
or
bullyrag
an
enemy
with
and
make
*NL*
him
wish
he
had
n't
come
--
and
when
the
boy
made
his
military
salute
*NL*
and
stood
aside
at
last
,
I
was
proud
enough
to
hug
him
,
and
all
*NL*
those
other
people
were
so
dazed
they
looked
partly
petrified
,
*NL*
partly
drunk
,
and
wholly
caught
out
and
snowed
under
.
I
judged
*NL*
that
the
cake
was
ours
,
and
by
a
large
majority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Education
is
a
great
thing
.
This
was
the
same
youth
who
had
come
*NL*
to
West
Point
so
ignorant
that
when
I
asked
him
,
``
If
a
general
*NL*
officer
should
have
a
horse
shot
under
him
on
the
field
of
battle
,
*NL*
what
ought
he
to
do
?
''
answered
up
naively
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
and
brush
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
young
nobles
was
called
up
now
.
I
thought
I
would
*NL*
question
him
a
little
myself
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
your
lordship
read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
flushed
indignantly
,
and
he
fired
this
at
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Takest
me
for
a
clerk
?
I
trow
I
am
not
of
a

that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

the
question

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crowded
his
wrath
down
and
made
out
to
answer
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
write

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
resent
this
,
too
,
but
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

Try
to
conceive
of
this
mollusk
gravely
applying
for
an
official
*NL*
position
,
of
any
kind
under
the
sun
!
Why
,
he
had
all
the
earmarks
*NL*
of
a
typewriter
copyist
,
if
you
leave
out
the
disposition
to
*NL*
contribute
uninvited
emendations
of
your
grammar
and
punctuation
.
*NL*
It
was
unaccountable
that
he
did
n't
attempt
a
little
help
of
that
*NL*
sort
out
of
his
majestic
supply
of
incapacity
for
the
job
.
But
that
*NL*
did
n't
prove
that
he
had
n't
material
in
him
for
the
disposition
,
*NL*
it
only
proved
that
he
was
n't
a
typewriter
copyist
yet
.
After
*NL*
nagging
him
a
little
more
,
I
let
the
professors
loose
on
him
and
*NL*
they
turned
him
inside
out
,
on
the
line
of
scientific
war
,
and
*NL*
found
him
empty
,
of
course
.
He
knew
somewhat
about
the
warfare
*NL*
of
the
time
--
bushwhacking
around
for
ogres
,
and
bull-fights
in
*NL*
the
tournament
ring
,
and
such
things
--
but
otherwise
he
was
empty
*NL*
and
useless
.
Then
we
took
the
other
young
noble
in
hand
,
and
he
*NL*
was
the
first
one
's
twin
,
for
ignorance
and
incapacity
.
I
delivered
*NL*
them
into
the
hands
of
the

the
comfortable
*NL*
consciousness
that
their

said

resumed

there
was

up

it
is
the
humble
step
which
will
lead
to
grandeurs
more
*NL*
worthy
of
the
splendor
of
an
origin
like
to
thine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
down
in
the
bottomless
pit
of
humiliation
.
I
had
promised
*NL*
myself
an
easy
and
zenith-scouring
triumph
,
and
this
was
the
outcome
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
almost
ashamed
to
look
my
poor
disappointed
cadet
in
the
*NL*
face
.
I
told
him
to
go
home
and
be
patient
,
this
was
n't
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
private
audience
with
the
king
,
and
made
a
proposition
.
*NL*
I
said
it
was
quite
right
to
officer
that
regiment
with
nobilities
,
*NL*
and
he
could
n't
have
done
a
wiser
thing
.
It
would
also
be
a
good
*NL*
idea
to
add
five
hundred
officers
to
it
;
in
fact
,
add
as
many
*NL*
officers
as
there
were
nobles
and
relatives
of
nobles
in
the
*NL*
country
,
even
if
there
should
finally
be
five
times
as
many
officers
*NL*
as
privates
in
it
;
and
thus
make
it
the
crack
regiment
,
the
envied
*NL*
regiment
,
the
King
's
Own
regiment
,
and
entitled
to
fight
on
its
*NL*
own
hook
and
in
its
own
way
,
and
go
whither
it
would
and
come
*NL*
when
it
pleased
,
in
time
of
war
,
and
be
utterly
swell
and
independent
.
*NL*
This
would
make
that
regiment
the
heart
's
desire
of
all
the
*NL*
nobility
,
and
they
would
all
be
satisfied
and
happy
.
Then
we
*NL*
would
make
up
the
rest
of
the
standing
army
out
of
commonplace
*NL*
materials
,
and
officer
it
with
nobodies
,
as
was
proper
--
nobodies
*NL*
selected
on
a
basis
of
mere
efficiency
--
and
we
would
make
this
*NL*
regiment
toe
the
line
,
allow
it
no
aristocratic
freedom
from
*NL*
restraint
,
and
force
it
to
do
all
the
work
and
persistent
hammering
,
*NL*
to
the
end
that
whenever
the
King
's
Own
was
tired
and
wanted
to
go
*NL*
off
for
a
change
and
rummage
around
amongst
ogres
and
have
a
good
*NL*
time
,
it
could
go
without
uneasiness
,
knowing
that
matters
were
in
*NL*
safe
hands
behind
it
,
and
business
going
to
be
continued
at
the
*NL*
old
stand
,
same
as
usual
.
The
king
was
charmed
with
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
noticed
that
,
it
gave
me
a
valuable
notion
.
I
thought
*NL*
I
saw
my
way
out
of
an
old
and
stubborn
difficulty
at
last
.
You
*NL*
see
,
the
royalties
of
the
Pendragon
stock
were
a
long-lived
race
*NL*
and
very
fruitful
.
Whenever
a
child
was
born
to
any
of
these
*NL*
--
and
it
was
pretty
often
--
there
was
wild
joy
in
the
nation
's
mouth
,
*NL*
and
piteous
sorrow
in
the
nation
's
heart
.
The
joy
was
questionable
,
*NL*
but
the
grief
was
honest
.
Because
the
event
meant
another
call
*NL*
for
a
Royal
Grant
.
Long
was
the
list
of
these
royalties
,
and
*NL*
they
were
a
heavy
and
steadily
increasing
burden
upon
the
treasury
*NL*
and
a
menace
to
the
crown
.
Yet
Arthur
could
not
believe
this
*NL*
latter
fact
,
and
he
would
not
listen
to
any
of
my
various
projects
*NL*
for
substituting
something
in
the
place
of
the
royal
grants
.
If
I
*NL*
could
have
persuaded
him
to
now
and
then
provide
a
support
for
*NL*
one
of
these
outlying
scions
from
his
own
pocket
,
I
could
have
*NL*
made
a
grand
to-do
over
it
,
and
it
would
have
had
a
good
effect
*NL*
with
the
nation
;
but
no
,
he
would
n't
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
He
had
*NL*
something
like
a
religious
passion
for
royal
grant
;
he
seemed
to
*NL*
look
upon
it
as
a
sort
of
sacred
swag
,
and
one
could
not
irritate
*NL*
him
in
any
way
so
quickly
and
so
surely
as
by
an
attack
upon
that
*NL*
venerable
institution
.
If
I
ventured
to
cautiously
hint
that
there
*NL*
was
not
another
respectable
family
in
England
that
would
humble
*NL*
itself
to
hold
out
the
hat
--
however
,
that
is
as
far
as
I
ever
got
;
*NL*
he
always
cut
me
short
there
,
and
peremptorily
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
believed
I
saw
my
chance
at
last
.
I
would
form
this
crack
*NL*
regiment
out
of
officers
alone
--
not
a
single
private
.
Half
of
it
*NL*
should
consist
of
nobles
,
who
should
fill
all
the
places
up
to
*NL*
Major-General
,
and
serve
gratis
and
pay
their
own
expenses
;
and
*NL*
they
would
be
glad
to
do
this
when
they
should
learn
that
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
regiment
would
consist
exclusively
of
princes
of
the
blood
.
*NL*
These
princes
of
the
blood
should
range
in
rank
from
Lieutenant-General
*NL*
up
to
Field
Marshal
,
and
be
gorgeously
salaried
and
equipped
and
*NL*
fed
by
the
state
.
Moreover
--
and
this
was
the
master
stroke
*NL*
--
it
should
be
decreed
that
these
princely
grandees
should
be
always
*NL*
addressed
by
a
stunningly
gaudy
and
awe-compelling
title
-LRB-
which
*NL*
I
would
presently
invent
-RRB-
,
and
they
and
they
only
in
all
England
*NL*
should
be
so
addressed
.
Finally
,
all
princes
of
the
blood
should
*NL*
have
free
choice
;
join
that
regiment
,
get
that
great
title
,
and
*NL*
renounce
the
royal
grant
,
or
stay
out
and
receive
a
grant
.
Neatest
*NL*
touch
of
all
:
unborn
but
imminent
princes
of
the
blood
could
be
*NL*
_
born
_
into
the
regiment
,
and
start
fair
,
with
good
wages
and
a
*NL*
permanent
situation
,
upon
due
notice
from
the
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
boys
would
join
,
I
was
sure
of
that
;
so
,
all
existing
*NL*
grants
would
be
relinquished
;
that
the
newly
born
would
always
*NL*
join
was
equally
certain
.
Within
sixty
days
that
quaint
and
*NL*
bizarre
anomaly
,
the
Royal
Grant
,
would
cease
to
be
a
living
fact
,
*NL*
and
take
its
place
among
the
curiosities
of
the
past
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FIRST
NEWSPAPER
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
told
the
king
I
was
going
out
disguised
as
a
petty
freeman
*NL*
to
scour
the
country
and
familiarize
myself
with
the
humbler
life
*NL*
of
the
people
,
he
was
all
afire
with
the
novelty
of
the
thing
*NL*
in
a
minute
,
and
was
bound
to
take
a
chance
in
the
adventure
*NL*
himself
--
nothing
should
stop
him
--
he
would
drop
everything
and
*NL*
go
along
--
it
was
the
prettiest
idea
he
had
run
across
for
many
*NL*
a
day
.
He
wanted
to
glide
out
the
back
way
and
start
at
once
;
*NL*
but
I
showed
him
that
that
would
n't
answer
.
You
see
,
he
was
billed
*NL*
for
the
king
's
-
evil
--
to
touch
for
it
,
I
mean
--
and
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
right
to
disappoint
the
house
and
it
would
n't
make
a
delay
worth
*NL*
considering
,
anyway
,
it
was
only
a
one-night
stand
.
And
I
thought
*NL*
he
ought
to
tell
the
queen
he
was
going
away
.
He
clouded
up
at
*NL*
that
and
looked
sad
.
I
was
sorry
I
had
spoken
,
especially
when
*NL*
he
said
mournfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
forgettest
that
Launcelot
is
here
;
and
where
Launcelot
is
,
*NL*
she
noteth
not
the
going
forth
of
the
king
,
nor
what
day
he
returneth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
changed
the
Subject
.
Yes
,
Guenever
was
beautiful
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
but
take
her
all
around
she
was
pretty
slack
.
I
never
*NL*
meddled
in
these
matters
,
they
were
n't
my
affair
,
but
I
did
hate
*NL*
to
see
the
way
things
were
going
on
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
saying
that
*NL*
much
.
Many
's
the
time
she
had
asked
me
,
``
Sir
Boss
,
hast
seen
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
about
?
''
but
if
ever
she
went
fretting
around
for
*NL*
the
king
I
did
n't
happen
to
be
around
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
very
good
lay-out
for
the
king
's
-
evil
business
--
very
*NL*
tidy
and
creditable
.
The
king
sat
under
a
canopy
of
state
;
about
*NL*
him
were
clustered
a
large
body
of
the
clergy
in
full
canonicals
.
*NL*
Conspicuous
,
both
for
location
and
personal
outfit
,
stood
Marinel
,
*NL*
a
hermit
of
the
quack-doctor
species
,
to
introduce
the
sick
.
All
*NL*
abroad
over
the
spacious
floor
,
and
clear
down
to
the
doors
,
*NL*
in
a
thick
jumble
,
lay
or
sat
the
scrofulous
,
under
a
strong
light
.
*NL*
It
was
as
good
as
a
tableau
;
in
fact
,
it
had
all
the
look
of
being
*NL*
gotten
up
for
that
,
though
it
was
n't
.
There
were
eight
hundred
*NL*
sick
people
present
.
The
work
was
slow
;
it
lacked
the
interest
*NL*
of
novelty
for
me
,
because
I
had
seen
the
ceremonies
before
;
*NL*
the
thing
soon
became
tedious
,
but
the
proprieties
required
me
*NL*
to
stick
it
out
.
The
doctor
was
there
for
the
reason
that
in
all
*NL*
such
crowds
there
were
many
people
who
only
imagined
something
*NL*
was
the
matter
with
them
,
and
many
who
were
consciously
sound
*NL*
but
wanted
the
immortal
honor
of
fleshly
contact
with
a
king
,
and
*NL*
yet
others
who
pretended
to
illness
in
order
to
get
the
piece
of
*NL*
coin
that
went
with
the
touch
.
Up
to
this
time
this
coin
had
been
*NL*
a
wee
little
gold
piece
worth
about
a
third
of
a
dollar
.
When
you
*NL*
consider
how
much
that
amount
of
money
would
buy
,
in
that
age
*NL*
and
country
,
and
how
usual
it
was
to
be
scrofulous
,
when
not
dead
,
*NL*
you
would
understand
that
the
annual
king
's
-
evil
appropriation
was
*NL*
just
the
River
and
Harbor
bill
of
that
government
for
the
grip
it
*NL*
took
on
the
treasury
and
the
chance
it
afforded
for
skinning
the
*NL*
surplus
.
So
I
had
privately
concluded
to
touch
the
treasury
itself
*NL*
for
the
king
's
-
evil
.
I
covered
six-sevenths
of
the
appropriation
*NL*
into
the
treasury
a
week
before
starting
from
Camelot
on
my
*NL*
adventures
,
and
ordered
that
the
other
seventh
be
inflated
into
*NL*
five-cent
nickels
and
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
head
clerk
*NL*
of
the
King
's
Evil
Department
;
a
nickel
to
take
the
place
of
each
*NL*
gold
coin
,
you
see
,
and
do
its
work
for
it
.
It
might
strain
the
*NL*
nickel
some
,
but
I
judged
it
could
stand
it
.
As
a
rule
,
I
do
not
*NL*
approve
of
watering
stock
,
but
I
considered
it
square
enough
*NL*
in
this
case
,
for
it
was
just
a
gift
,
anyway
.
Of
course
,
you
can
*NL*
water
a
gift
as
much
as
you
want
to
;
and
I
generally
do
.
The
old
*NL*
gold
and
silver
coins
of
the
country
were
of
ancient
and
unknown
*NL*
origin
,
as
a
rule
,
but
some
of
them
were
Roman
;
they
were
ill-shapen
,
*NL*
and
seldom
rounder
than
a
moon
that
is
a
week
past
the
full
;
they
*NL*
were
hammered
,
not
minted
,
and
they
were
so
worn
with
use
that
*NL*
the
devices
upon
them
were
as
illegible
as
blisters
,
and
looked
*NL*
like
them
.
I
judged
that
a
sharp
,
bright
new
nickel
,
with
a
*NL*
first-rate
likeness
of
the
king
on
one
side
of
it
and
Guenever
*NL*
on
the
other
,
and
a
blooming
pious
motto
,
would
take
the
tuck
out
*NL*
of
scrofula
as
handy
as
a
nobler
coin
and
please
the
scrofulous
*NL*
fancy
more
;
and
I
was
right
.
This
batch
was
the
first
it
was
*NL*
tried
on
,
and
it
worked
to
a
charm
.
The
saving
in
expense
was
*NL*
a
notable
economy
.
You
will
see
that
by
these
figures
:
We
touched
*NL*
a
trifle
over
700
of
the
800
patients
;
at
former
rates
,
this
would
*NL*
have
cost
the
government
about
$
240
;
at
the
new
rate
we
pulled
*NL*
through
for
about
$
35
,
thus
saving
upward
of
$
200
at
one
swoop
.
*NL*
To
appreciate
the
full
magnitude
of
this
stroke
,
consider
these
*NL*
other
figures
:
the
annual
expenses
of
a
national
government
amount
*NL*
to
the
equivalent
of
a
contribution
of
three
days
'
average
wages
of
*NL*
every
individual
of
the
population
,
counting
every
individual
as
*NL*
if
he
were
a
man
.
If
you
take
a
nation
of
60,000,000
,
where
average
*NL*
wages
are
$
2
per
day
,
three
days
'
wages
taken
from
each
individual
*NL*
will
provide
$
360,000,000
and
pay
the
government
's
expenses
.
In
my
*NL*
day
,
in
my
own
country
,
this
money
was
collected
from
imposts
,
*NL*
and
the
citizen
imagined
that
the
foreign
importer
paid
it
,
and
it
*NL*
made
him
comfortable
to
think
so
;
whereas
,
in
fact
,
it
was
paid
*NL*
by
the
American
people
,
and
was
so
equally
and
exactly
distributed
*NL*
among
them
that
the
annual
cost
to
the
100-millionaire
and
the
*NL*
annual
cost
to
the
sucking
child
of
the
day-laborer
was
precisely
*NL*
the
same
--
each
paid
$
6
.
Nothing
could
be
equaler
than
that
,
*NL*
I
reckon
.
Well
,
Scotland
and
Ireland
were
tributary
to
Arthur
,
*NL*
and
the
united
populations
of
the
British
Islands
amounted
to
*NL*
something
less
than
1,000,000
.
A
mechanic
's
average
wage
was
*NL*
3
cents
a
day
,
when
he
paid
his
own
keep
.
By
this
rule
the
national
*NL*
government
's
expenses
were
$
90,000
a
year
,
or
about
$
250
a
day
.
*NL*
Thus
,
by
the
substitution
of
nickels
for
gold
on
a
king
's
-
evil
*NL*
day
,
I
not
only
injured
no
one
,
dissatisfied
no
one
,
but
pleased
*NL*
all
concerned
and
saved
four-fifths
of
that
day
's
national
expense
*NL*
into
the
bargain
--
a
saving
which
would
have
been
the
equivalent
*NL*
of
$
800,000
in
my
day
in
America
.
In
making
this
substitution
*NL*
I
had
drawn
upon
the
wisdom
of
a
very
remote
source
--
the
wisdom
*NL*
of
my
boyhood
--
for
the
true
statesman
does
not
despise
any
wisdom
,
*NL*
howsoever
lowly
may
be
its
origin
:
in
my
boyhood
I
had
always
*NL*
saved
my
pennies
and
contributed
buttons
to
the
foreign
missionary
*NL*
cause
.
The
buttons
would
answer
the
ignorant
savage
as
well
as
*NL*
the
coin
,
the
coin
would
answer
me
better
than
the
buttons
;
all
*NL*
hands
were
happy
and
nobody
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marinel
took
the
patients
as
they
came
.
He
examined
the
candidate
;
*NL*
if
he
could
n't
qualify
he
was
warned
off
;
if
he
could
he
was
passed
*NL*
along
to
the
king
.
A
priest
pronounced
the
words
,
``
They
shall
*NL*
lay
their
hands
on
the
sick
,
and
they
shall
recover
.
''
Then
the
king
*NL*
stroked
the
ulcers
,
while
the
reading
continued
;
finally
,
the
*NL*
patient
graduated
and
got
his
nickel
--
the
king
hanging
it
around
*NL*
his
neck
himself
--
and
was
dismissed
.
Would
you
think
that
that
*NL*
would
cure
?
It
certainly
did
.
Any
mummery
will
cure
if
the
*NL*
patient
's
faith
is
strong
in
it
.
Up
by
Astolat
there
was
a
chapel
*NL*
where
the
Virgin
had
once
appeared
to
a
girl
who
used
to
herd
*NL*
geese
around
there
--
the
girl
said
so
herself
--
and
they
built
the
*NL*
chapel
upon
that
spot
and
hung
a
picture
in
it
representing
the
*NL*
occurrence
--
a
picture
which
you
would
think
it
dangerous
for
a
sick
*NL*
person
to
approach
;
whereas
,
on
the
contrary
,
thousands
of
the
lame
*NL*
and
the
sick
came
and
prayed
before
it
every
year
and
went
away
*NL*
whole
and
sound
;
and
even
the
well
could
look
upon
it
and
live
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
when
I
was
told
these
things
I
did
not
believe
them
;
*NL*
but
when
I
went
there
and
saw
them
I
had
to
succumb
.
I
saw
the
*NL*
cures
effected
myself
;
and
they
were
real
cures
and
not
questionable
.
*NL*
I
saw
cripples
whom
I
had
seen
around
Camelot
for
years
on
crutches
,
*NL*
arrive
and
pray
before
that
picture
,
and
put
down
their
crutches
*NL*
and
walk
off
without
a
limp
.
There
were
piles
of
crutches
there
*NL*
which
had
been
left
by
such
people
as
a
testimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
other
places
people
operated
on
a
patient
's
mind
,
without
saying
*NL*
a
word
to
him
,
and
cured
him
.
In
others
,
experts
assembled
patients
*NL*
in
a
room
and
prayed
over
them
,
and
appealed
to
their
faith
,
and
*NL*
those
patients
went
away
cured
.
Wherever
you
find
a
king
who
ca
n't
*NL*
cure
the
king
's
-
evil
you
can
be
sure
that
the
most
valuable
*NL*
superstition
that
supports
his
throne
--
the
subject
's
belief
in
*NL*
the
divine
appointment
of
his
sovereign
--
has
passed
away
.
In
my
*NL*
youth
the
monarchs
of
England
had
ceased
to
touch
for
the
evil
,
*NL*
but
there
was
no
occasion
for
this
diffidence
:
they
could
have
*NL*
cured
it
forty-nine
times
in
fifty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
when
the
priest
had
been
droning
for
three
hours
,
and
the
*NL*
good
king
polishing
the
evidences
,
and
the
sick
were
still
pressing
*NL*
forward
as
plenty
as
ever
,
I
got
to
feeling
intolerably
bored
.
*NL*
I
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
not
far
from
the
canopy
of
state
.
*NL*
For
the
five
hundredth
time
a
patient
stood
forward
to
have
his
*NL*
repulsivenesses
stroked
;
again
those
words
were
being
droned
out
:
*NL*
``
they
shall
lay
their
hands
on
the
sick
''
--
when
outside
there
rang
*NL*
clear
as
a
clarion
a
note
that
enchanted
my
soul
and
tumbled
*NL*
thirteen
worthless
centuries
about
my
ears
:
``
Camelot
_
Weekly
*NL*
Hosannah
and
Literary
Volcano
!
_
--
latest
irruption
--
only
two
cents
*NL*
--
all
about
the
big
miracle
in
the
Valley
of
Holiness
!
''
One
greater
*NL*
than
kings
had
arrived
--
the
newsboy
.
But
I
was
the
only
person
*NL*
in
all
that
throng
who
knew
the
meaning
of
this
mighty
birth
,
and
*NL*
what
this
imperial
magician
was
come
into
the
world
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dropped
a
nickel
out
of
the
window
and
got
my
paper
;
the
*NL*
Adam-newsboy
of
the
world
went
around
the
corner
to
get
my
change
;
*NL*
is
around
the
corner
yet
.
It
was
delicious
to
see
a
newspaper
*NL*
again
,
yet
I
was
conscious
of
a
secret
shock
when
my
eye
fell
upon
*NL*
the
first
batch
of
display
head-lines
.
I
had
lived
in
a
clammy
*NL*
atmosphere
of
reverence
,
respect
,
deference
,
so
long
that
they
*NL*
sent
a
quivery
little
cold
wave
through
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HIGH

and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
Yes
,
it
was
too
loud
.
Once
I
could
have
*NL*
enjoyed
it
and
seen
nothing
out
of
the
way
about
it
,
but
now
its
*NL*
note
was
discordant
.
It
was
good
Arkansas
journalism
,
but
this
*NL*
was
not
Arkansas
.
Moreover
,
the
next
to
the
last
line
was
calculated
*NL*
to
give
offense
to
the
hermits
,
and
perhaps
lose
us
their
advertising
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
there
was
too
lightsome
a
tone
of
flippancy
all
through
*NL*
the
paper
.
It
was
plain
I
had
undergone
a
considerable
change
*NL*
without
noticing
it
.
I
found
myself
unpleasantly
affected
by
*NL*
pert
little
irreverencies
which
would
have
seemed
but
proper
and
*NL*
airy
graces
of
speech
at
an
earlier
period
of
my
life
.
There
was
an
*NL*
abundance
of
the
following
breed
of
items
,
and
they
discomforted
me
:

*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
was
good
enough
journalism
for
a
beginning
;
I
knew
*NL*
that
quite
well
,
and
yet
it
was
somehow
disappointing
.
The
*NL*
``
Court
Circular
''
pleased
me
better
;
indeed
,
its
simple
and
dignified
*NL*
respectfulness
was
a
distinct
refreshment
to
me
after
all
those
*NL*
disgraceful
familiarities
.
But
even
it
could
have
been
improved
.
*NL*
Do
what
one
may
,
there
is
no
getting
an
air
of
variety
into
a
court
*NL*
circular
,
I
acknowledge
that
.
There
is
a
profound
monotonousness
*NL*
about
its
facts
that
baffles
and
defeats
one
's
sincerest
efforts
*NL*
to
make
them
sparkle
and
enthuse
.
The
best
way
to
manage
--
in
fact
,
*NL*
the
only
sensible
way
--
is
to
disguise
repetitiousness
of
fact
under
*NL*
variety
of
form
:
skin
your
fact
each
time
and
lay
on
a
new
cuticle
*NL*
of
words
.
It
deceives
the
eye
;
you
think
it
is
a
new
fact
;
it
*NL*
gives
you
the
idea
that
the
court
is
carrying
on
like
everything
;
*NL*
this
excites
you
,
and
you
drain
the
whole
column
,
with
a
good
*NL*
appetite
,
and
perhaps
never
notice
that
it
's
a
barrel
of
soup
made
*NL*
out
of
a
single
bean
.
Clarence
's
way
was
good
,
it
was
simple
,
*NL*
it
was
dignified
,
it
was
direct
and
business-like
;
all
I
say
is
,
*NL*
it
was
not
the
best
way
:

However
,
take
the
paper
by
and
large
,
I
was
vastly
pleased
with
it
.
*NL*
Little
crudities
of
a
mechanical
sort
were
observable
here
and
*NL*
there
,
but
there
were
not
enough
of
them
to
amount
to
anything
,
*NL*
and
it
was
good
enough
Arkansas
proof-reading
,
anyhow
,
and
better
*NL*
than
was
needed
in
Arthur
's
day
and
realm
.
As
a
rule
,
the
grammar
*NL*
was
leaky
and
the
construction
more
or
less
lame
;
but
I
did
not
*NL*
much
mind
these
things
.
They
are
common
defects
of
my
own
,
and
*NL*
one
must
n't
criticise
other
people
on
grounds
where
he
ca
n't
stand
*NL*
perpendicular
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
hungry
enough
for
literature
to
want
to
take
down
the
whole
*NL*
paper
at
this
one
meal
,
but
I
got
only
a
few
bites
,
and
then
had
*NL*
to
postpone
,
because
the
monks
around
me
besieged
me
so
with
eager
*NL*
questions
:
What
is
this
curious
thing
?
What
is
it
for
?
Is
it
a
*NL*
handkerchief
?
--
saddle
blanket
?
--
part
of
a
shirt
?
What
is
it
made
of
?
*NL*
How
thin
it
is
,
and
how
dainty
and
frail
;
and
how
it
rattles
.
*NL*
Will
it
wear
,
do
you
think
,
and
wo
n't
the
rain
injure
it
?
Is
it
*NL*
writing
that
appears
on
it
,
or
is
it
only
ornamentation
?
They
*NL*
suspected
it
was
writing
,
because
those
among
them
who
knew
how
*NL*
to
read
Latin
and
had
a
smattering
of
Greek
,
recognized
some
of
*NL*
the
letters
,
but
they
could
make
nothing
out
of
the
result
as
a
*NL*
whole
.
I
put
my
information
in
the
simplest
form
I
could
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
public
journal
;
I
will
explain
what
that
is
,
another
time
.
*NL*
It
is
not
cloth
,
it
is
made
of
paper
;
some
time
I
will
explain
*NL*
what
paper
is
.
The
lines
on
it
are
reading
matter
;
and
not
written
*NL*
by
hand
,
but
printed
;
by
and
by
I
will
explain
what
printing
is
.
*NL*
A
thousand
of
these
sheets
have
been
made
,
all
exactly
like
this
,
*NL*
in
every
minute
detail
--
they
ca
n't
be
told
apart
.
''
Then
they
all
*NL*
broke
out
with
exclamations
of
surprise
and
admiration
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
!
Verily
a
mighty
work
--
a
year
's
work
for
many
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
merely
a
day
's
work
for
a
man
and
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
themselves
,
and
whiffed
out
a
protective
prayer
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah-h
--
a
miracle
,
a
wonder
!
Dark
work
of
enchantment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
let
it
go
at
that
.
Then
I
read
in
a
low
voice
,
to
as
many
as
*NL*
could
crowd
their
shaven
heads
within
hearing
distance
,
part
of
*NL*
the
account
of
the
miracle
of
the
restoration
of
the
well
,
and
*NL*
was
accompanied
by
astonished
and
reverent
ejaculations
all
through
:
*NL*
``
Ah-h-h
!
''
``
How
true
!
''
``
Amazing
,
amazing
!
''
``
These
be
the
very
*NL*
haps
as
they
happened
,
in
marvelous
exactness
!
''
And
might
they
*NL*
take
this
strange
thing
in
their
hands
,
and
feel
of
it
and
examine
*NL*
it
?

they
would
be
very
careful
.
Yes
.
So
they
took
it
,
handling
*NL*
it
as
cautiously
and
devoutly
as
if
it
had
been
some
holy
thing
*NL*
come
from
some
supernatural
region
;
and
gently
felt
of
its
texture
,
*NL*
caressed
its
pleasant
smooth
surface
with
lingering
touch
,
and
*NL*
scanned
the
mysterious
characters
with
fascinated
eyes
.
These
*NL*
grouped
bent
heads
,
these
charmed
faces
,
these
speaking
eyes
*NL*
--
how
beautiful
to
me
!
For
was
not
this
my
darling
,
and
was
not
*NL*
all
this
mute
wonder
and
interest
and
homage
a
most
eloquent
*NL*
tribute
and
unforced
compliment
to
it
?
I
knew
,
then
,
how
a
mother
*NL*
feels
when
women
,
whether
strangers
or
friends
,
take
her
new
baby
,
*NL*
and
close
themselves
about
it
with
one
eager
impulse
,
and
bend
*NL*
their
heads
over
it
in
a
tranced
adoration
that
makes
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
universe
vanish
out
of
their
consciousness
and
be
as
if
it
*NL*
were
not
,
for
that
time
.
I
knew
how
she
feels
,
and
that
there
is
*NL*
no
other
satisfied
ambition
,
whether
of
king
,
conqueror
,
or
poet
,
*NL*
that
ever
reaches
half-way
to
that
serene
far
summit
or
yields
half
*NL*
so
divine
a
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
the
rest
of
the
seance
my
paper
traveled
from
group
to
*NL*
group
all
up
and
down
and
about
that
huge
hall
,
and
my
happy
eye
*NL*
was
upon
it
always
,
and
I
sat
motionless
,
steeped
in
satisfaction
,
*NL*
drunk
with
enjoyment
.
Yes
,
this
was
heaven
;
I
was
tasting
it
once
,
*NL*
if
I
might
never
taste
it
more
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
YANKEE
AND
THE
KING
TRAVEL
INCOGNITO
*NL*
*NL*
About
bedtime
I
took
the
king
to
my
private
quarters
to
cut
his
*NL*
hair
and
help
him
get
the
hang
of
the
lowly
raiment
he
was
to
wear
.
*NL*
The
high
classes
wore
their
hair
banged
across
the
forehead
but
*NL*
hanging
to
the
shoulders
the
rest
of
the
way
around
,
whereas
the
*NL*
lowest
ranks
of
commoners
were
banged
fore
and
aft
both
;
the
slaves
*NL*
were
bangless
,
and
allowed
their
hair
free
growth
.
So
I
inverted
*NL*
a
bowl
over
his
head
and
cut
away
all
the
locks
that
hung
below
it
.
*NL*
I
also
trimmed
his
whiskers
and
mustache
until
they
were
only
*NL*
about
a
half-inch
long
;
and
tried
to
do
it
inartistically
,
and
*NL*
succeeded
.
It
was
a
villainous
disfigurement
.
When
he
got
his
*NL*
lubberly
sandals
on
,
and
his
long
robe
of
coarse
brown
linen
cloth
,
*NL*
which
hung
straight
from
his
neck
to
his
ankle-bones
,
he
was
no
*NL*
longer
the
comeliest
man
in
his
kingdom
,
but
one
of
the
unhandsomest
*NL*
and
most
commonplace
and
unattractive
.
We
were
dressed
and
barbered
*NL*
alike
,
and
could
pass
for
small
farmers
,
or
farm
bailiffs
,
or
*NL*
shepherds
,
or
carters
;
yes
,
or
for
village
artisans
,
if
we
chose
,
*NL*
our
costume
being
in
effect
universal
among
the
poor
,
because
of
*NL*
its
strength
and
cheapness
.
I
do
n't
mean
that
it
was
really
cheap
*NL*
to
a
very
poor
person
,
but
I
do
mean
that
it
was
the
cheapest
*NL*
material
there
was
for
male
attire
--
manufactured
material
,
you
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
slipped
away
an
hour
before
dawn
,
and
by
broad
sun-up
had
made
*NL*
eight
or
ten
miles
,
and
were
in
the
midst
of
a
sparsely
settled
*NL*
country
.
I
had
a
pretty
heavy
knapsack
;
it
was
laden
with
*NL*
provisions
--
provisions
for
the
king
to
taper
down
on
,
till
he
*NL*
could
take
to
the
coarse
fare
of
the
country
without
damage
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
a
comfortable
seat
for
the
king
by
the
roadside
,
and
then
*NL*
gave
him
a
morsel
or
two
to
stay
his
stomach
with
.
Then
I
said
*NL*
I
would
find
some
water
for
him
,
and
strolled
away
.
Part
of
my
*NL*
project
was
to
get
out
of
sight
and
sit
down
and
rest
a
little
*NL*
myself
.
It
had
always
been
my
custom
to
stand
when
in
his
presence
;
*NL*
even
at
the
council
board
,
except
upon
those
rare
occasions
when
*NL*
the
sitting
was
a
very
long
one
,
extending
over
hours
;
then
I
had
*NL*
a
trifling
little
backless
thing
which
was
like
a
reversed
culvert
*NL*
and
was
as
comfortable
as
the
toothache
.
I
did
n't
want
to
break
*NL*
him
in
suddenly
,
but
do
it
by
degrees
.
We
should
have
to
sit
*NL*
together
now
when
in
company
,
or
people
would
notice
;
but
it
would
*NL*
not
be
good
politics
for
me
to
be
playing
equality
with
him
when
*NL*
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
water
some
three
hundred
yards
away
,
and
had
been
*NL*
resting
about
twenty
minutes
,
when
I
heard
voices
.
That
is
all
*NL*
right
,
I
thought
--
peasants
going
to
work
;
nobody
else
likely
to
be
*NL*
stirring
this
early
.
But
the
next
moment
these
comers
jingled
into
*NL*
sight
around
a
turn
of
the
road
--
smartly
clad
people
of
quality
,
*NL*
with
luggage-mules
and
servants
in
their
train
!
I
was
off
like
*NL*
a
shot
,
through
the
bushes
,
by
the
shortest
cut
.
For
a
while
it
*NL*
did
seem
that
these
people
would
pass
the
king
before
I
could
*NL*
get
to
him
;
but
desperation
gives
you
wings
,
you
know
,
and
I
canted
*NL*
my
body
forward
,
inflated
my
breast
,
and
held
my
breath
and
flew
.
*NL*
I
arrived
.
And
in
plenty
good
enough
time
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
my
king
,
but
it
's
no
time
for
ceremony
--
jump
!
Jump
to
*NL*
your
feet
--
some
quality
are
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
marvel
?
Let
them
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
liege
!
You
must
not
be
seen
sitting
.
Rise
!
--
and
stand
in
*NL*
humble
posture
while
they
pass
.
You
are
a
peasant
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
--
I
had
forgot
it
,
so
lost
was
I
in
planning
of
a
huge
war
*NL*
with
Gaul
''
--
he
was
up
by
this
time
,
but
a
farm
could
have
got
up
*NL*
quicker
,
if
there
was
any
kind
of
a
boom
in
real
estate
--
``
and
*NL*
right-so
a
thought
came
randoming
overthwart
this
majestic
dream
*NL*
the
which
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
humbler
attitude
,
my
lord
the
king
--
and
quick
!
Duck
your
head
!
*NL*
--
more
!
--
still
more
!
--
droop
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
his
honest
best
,
but
lord
,
it
was
no
great
things
.
He
looked
*NL*
as
humble
as
the
leaning
tower
at
Pisa
.
It
is
the
most
you
could
*NL*
say
of
it
.
Indeed
,
it
was
such
a
thundering
poor
success
that
*NL*
it
raised
wondering
scowls
all
along
the
line
,
and
a
gorgeous
*NL*
flunkey
at
the
tail
end
of
it
raised
his
whip
;
but
I
jumped
in
*NL*
time
and
was
under
it
when
it
fell
;
and
under
cover
of
the
volley
*NL*
of
coarse
laughter
which
followed
,
I
spoke
up
sharply
and
warned
*NL*
the
king
to
take
no
notice
.
He
mastered
himself
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
sore
tax
;
he
wanted
to
eat
up
the
procession
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
end
our
adventures
at
the
very
start
;
and
we
,
being
*NL*
without
weapons
,
could
do
nothing
with
that
armed
gang
.
If
we
*NL*
are
going
to
succeed
in
our
emprise
,
we
must
not
only
look
the
*NL*
peasant
but
act
the
peasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
wisdom
;
none
can
gainsay
it
.
Let
us
go
on
,
Sir
Boss
.
*NL*
I
will
take
note
and
learn
,
and
do
the
best
I
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
word
.
He
did
the
best
he
could
,
but
I
've
seen
better
.
*NL*
If
you
have
ever
seen
an
active
,
heedless
,
enterprising
child
*NL*
going
diligently
out
of
one
mischief
and
into
another
all
day
*NL*
long
,
and
an
anxious
mother
at
its
heels
all
the
while
,
and
just
*NL*
saving
it
by
a
hair
from
drowning
itself
or
breaking
its
neck
with
*NL*
each
new
experiment
,
you
've
seen
the
king
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
could
have
foreseen
what
the
thing
was
going
to
be
like
,
*NL*
I
should
have
said
,
No
,
if
anybody
wants
to
make
his
living
*NL*
exhibiting
a
king
as
a
peasant
,
let
him
take
the
layout
;
I
can
*NL*
do
better
with
a
menagerie
,
and
last
longer
.
And
yet
,
during
*NL*
the
first
three
days
I
never
allowed
him
to
enter
a
hut
or
other
*NL*
dwelling
.
If
he
could
pass
muster
anywhere
during
his
early
*NL*
novitiate
it
would
be
in
small
inns
and
on
the
road
;
so
to
these
*NL*
places
we
confined
ourselves
.
Yes
,
he
certainly
did
the
best
he
*NL*
could
,
but
what
of
that
?
He
did
n't
improve
a
bit
that
I
could
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
always
frightening
me
,
always
breaking
out
with
fresh
*NL*
astonishers
,
in
new
and
unexpected
places
.
Toward
evening
on
*NL*
the
second
day
,
what
does
he
do
but
blandly
fetch
out
a
dirk
*NL*
from
inside
his
robe
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
guns
,
my
liege
,
where
did
you
get
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
a
smuggler
at
the
inn
,
yester
eve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
world
possessed
you
to
buy
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
escaped
divers
dangers
by
wit
--
thy
wit
--
but
I
have
*NL*
bethought
me
that
it
were
but
prudence
if
I
bore
a
weapon
,
too
.
*NL*
Thine
might
fail
thee
in
some
pinch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
people
of
our
condition
are
not
allowed
to
carry
arms
.
What
*NL*
would
a
lord
say
--
yes
,
or
any
other
person
of
whatever
condition
*NL*
--
if
he
caught
an
upstart
peasant
with
a
dagger
on
his
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
nobody
came
along
just
then
.
*NL*
I
persuaded
him
to
throw
the
dirk
away
;
and
it
was
as
easy
as
*NL*
persuading
a
child
to
give
up
some
bright
fresh
new
way
of
killing
*NL*
itself
.
We
walked
along
,
silent
and
thinking
.
Finally
the
king
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
ye
know
that
I
meditate
a
thing
inconvenient
,
or
that
hath
*NL*
a
peril
in
it
,
why
do
you
not
warn
me
to
cease
from
that
project
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
startling
question
,
and
a
puzzler
.
I
did
n't
quite
know
*NL*
how
to
take
hold
of
it
,
or
what
to
say
,
and
so
,
of
course
,
I
ended
*NL*
by
saying
the
natural
thing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
sire
,
how
can
I
know
what
your
thoughts
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
,
and
stared
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believed
thou
wert
greater
than
Merlin
;
and
truly
in
magic
*NL*
thou
art

But
prophecy
is
greater
than
magic
.
Merlin
is
a
prophet

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
I
had
made
a
blunder
.
I
must
get
back
my
lost
ground
.
*NL*
After
a
deep
reflection
and
careful
planning
,
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
I
have
been
misunderstood
.
I
will
explain
.
There
are
two
*NL*
kinds
of
prophecy
.
One
is
the
gift
to
foretell
things
that
are
but
*NL*
a
little
way
off
,
the
other
is
the
gift
to
foretell
things
that
*NL*
are
whole
ages
and
centuries
away
.
Which
is
the
mightier
gift
,
*NL*
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
last
,
most
surely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
Does
Merlin
possess
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partly
,
yes
.
He
foretold
mysteries
about
my
birth
and
future
*NL*
kingship
that
were
twenty
years
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
ever
gone
beyond
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
not
claim
more
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probably
his
limit
.
All
prophets
have
their
limit
.
The
limit
*NL*
of
some
of
the
great
prophets
has
been
a
hundred
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
few
,
I
ween
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
have
been
two
still
greater
ones
,
whose
limit
was
four
*NL*
hundred
and
six
hundred
years

and
one
whose
limit
compassed
*NL*
even
seven
hundred
and
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gramercy
,
it
is
marvelous
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
these
in
comparison
with
me

are
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``

truly
look
beyond
even
so
vast
a
stretch

of
time

``
Seven
hundred
years

My
liege

as
clear
as
the
vision
of
an
eagle

does
my
prophetic
eye
penetrate
and
lay
bare
the
future
of
this

nearly
thirteen
centuries

a
half

have

eyes
spread
slowly
open

lift
the
earth

entire
atmosphere
as
much
as
an
inch

That
*NL*
settled
Brer
Merlin

One
never
had
any
occasion
to
prove
his
*NL*
facts
,
with
these
people
;
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
state
them

never
occurred
to
anybody
to
doubt
the
statement

``
Now

I
continued
,

both
kinds

long

take
the
trouble

keep

I
seldom
exercise
any
but
the
long
kind

properer
to
Merlin

up
now
and
then
and
flirt
out
a
minor
prophecy
,
but
not
*NL*
often
--
hardly
ever
,
in
fact
.
You
will
remember
that
there
was
*NL*
great
talk
,
when
you
reached
the
Valley
of
Holiness
,
about
my
*NL*
having
prophesied
your
coming
and
the
very
hour
of
your
arrival
,
*NL*
two
or
three
days
beforehand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
yes
,
I
mind
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
have
done
it
as
much
as
forty
times
easier
,
and
*NL*
piled
on
a
thousand
times
more
detail
into
the
bargain
,
if
it
had
*NL*
been
five
hundred
years
away
instead
of
two
or
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
amazing
that
it
should
be
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
genuine
expert
can
always
foretell
a
thing
that
is
five
*NL*
hundred
years
away
easier
than
he
can
a
thing
that
's
only
five
*NL*
hundred
seconds
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
in
reason
it
should
clearly
be
the
other
way
;
it
should
*NL*
be
five
hundred
times
as
easy
to
foretell
the
last
as
the
first
,
*NL*
for
,
indeed
,
it
is
so
close
by
that
one
uninspired
might
almost
*NL*
see
it
.
In
truth
,
the
law
of
prophecy
doth
contradict
the
likelihoods
,
*NL*
most
strangely
making
the
difficult
easy
,
and
the
easy
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wise
head
.
A
peasant
's
cap
was
no
safe
disguise
for
it
;
*NL*
you
could
know
it
for
a
king
's
under
a
diving-bell
,
if
you
could
*NL*
hear
it
work
its
intellect
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
new
trade
now
,
and
plenty
of
business
in
it
.
The
king
*NL*
was
as
hungry
to
find
out
everything
that
was
going
to
happen
*NL*
during
the
next
thirteen
centuries
as
if
he
were
expecting
to
live
*NL*
in
them
.
From
that
time
out
,
I
prophesied
myself
bald-headed
*NL*
trying
to
supply
the
demand
.
I
have
done
some
indiscreet
things
in
*NL*
my
day
,
but
this
thing
of
playing
myself
for
a
prophet
was
the
*NL*
worst
.
Still
,
it
had
its
ameliorations
.
A
prophet
does
n't
have
*NL*
to
have
any
brains
.
They
are
good
to
have
,
of
course
,
for
the
*NL*
ordinary
exigencies
of
life
,
but
they
are
no
use
in
professional
*NL*
work
.
It
is
the
restfulest
vocation
there
is
.
When
the
spirit
of
*NL*
prophecy
comes
upon
you
,
you
merely
take
your
intellect
and
lay
it
*NL*
off
in
a
cool
place
for
a
rest
,
and
unship
your
jaw
and
leave
it
*NL*
alone
;
it
will
work
itself
:
the
result
is
prophecy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
a
knight-errant
or
so
came
along
,
and
the
sight
of
them
*NL*
fired
the
king
's
martial
spirit
every
time
.
He
would
have
forgotten
*NL*
himself
,
sure
,
and
said
something
to
them
in
a
style
a
suspicious
*NL*
shade
or
so
above
his
ostensible
degree
,
and
so
I
always
got
him
*NL*
well
out
of
the
road
in
time
.
Then
he
would
stand
and
look
with
*NL*
all
his
eyes
;
and
a
proud
light
would
flash
from
them
,
and
his
*NL*
nostrils
would
inflate
like
a
war-horse
's
,
and
I
knew
he
was
*NL*
longing
for
a
brush
with
them
.
But
about
noon
of
the
third
day
*NL*
I
had
stopped
in
the
road
to
take
a
precaution
which
had
been
*NL*
suggested
by
the
whip-stroke
that
had
fallen
to
my
share
two
days
*NL*
before
;
a
precaution
which
I
had
afterward
decided
to
leave
untaken
,
*NL*
I
was
so
loath
to
institute
it
;
but
now
I
had
just
had
a
fresh
*NL*
reminder
:
while
striding
heedlessly
along
,
with
jaw
spread
and
*NL*
intellect
at
rest
,
for
I
was
prophesying
,
I
stubbed
my
toe
and
*NL*
fell
sprawling
.
I
was
so
pale
I
could
n't
think
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
then
I
got
softly
and
carefully
up
and
unstrapped
my
knapsack
.
*NL*
I
had
that
dynamite
bomb
in
it
,
done
up
in
wool
in
a
box
.
It
was
*NL*
a
good
thing
to
have
along
;
the
time
would
come
when
I
could
do
*NL*
a
valuable
miracle
with
it
,
maybe
,
but
it
was
a
nervous
thing
*NL*
to
have
about
me
,
and
I
did
n't
like
to
ask
the
king
to
carry
it
.
*NL*
Yet
I
must
either
throw
it
away
or
think
up
some
safe
way
to
get
*NL*
along
with
its
society
.
I
got
it
out
and
slipped
it
into
my
scrip
,
*NL*
and
just
then
here
came
a
couple
of
knights
.
The
king
stood
,
*NL*
stately
as
a
statue
,
gazing
toward
them
--
had
forgotten
himself
again
,
*NL*
of
course
--
and
before
I
could
get
a
word
of
warning
out
,
it
was
*NL*
time
for
him
to
skip
,
and
well
that
he
did
it
,
too
.
He
supposed
*NL*
they
would
turn
aside
.
Turn
aside
to
avoid
trampling
peasant
dirt
*NL*
under
foot
?
When
had
he
ever
turned
aside
himself
--
or
ever
had
*NL*
the
chance
to
do
it
,
if
a
peasant
saw
him
or
any
other
noble
knight
*NL*
in
time
to
judiciously
save
him
the
trouble
?
The
knights
paid
*NL*
no
attention
to
the
king
at
all
;
it
was
his
place
to
look
out
*NL*
himself
,
and
if
he
had
n't
skipped
he
would
have
been
placidly
*NL*
ridden
down
,
and
laughed
at
besides
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
was
in
a
flaming
fury
,
and
launched
out
his
challenge
*NL*
and
epithets
with
a
most
royal
vigor
.
The
knights
were
some
little
*NL*
distance
by
now
.
They
halted
,
greatly
surprised
,
and
turned
in
*NL*
their
saddles
and
looked
back
,
as
if
wondering
if
it
might
be
worth
*NL*
while
to
bother
with
such
scum
as
we
.
Then
they
wheeled
and
*NL*
started
for
us
.
Not
a
moment
must
be
lost
.
I
started
for
_
them
_
.
*NL*
I
passed
them
at
a
rattling
gait
,
and
as
I
went
by
I
flung
out
a
*NL*
hair-lifting
soul-scorching
thirteen-jointed
insult
which
made
*NL*
the
king
's
effort
poor
and
cheap
by
comparison
.
I
got
it
out
of
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
where
they
know
how
.
They
had
such
headway
*NL*
that
they
were
nearly
to
the
king
before
they
could
check
up
;
*NL*
then
,
frantic
with
rage
,
they
stood
up
their
horses
on
their
hind
*NL*
hoofs
and
whirled
them
around
,
and
the
next
moment
here
they
came
,
*NL*
breast
to
breast
.
I
was
seventy
yards
off
,
then
,
and
scrambling
up
*NL*
a
great
bowlder
at
the
roadside
.
When
they
were
within
thirty
*NL*
yards
of
me
they
let
their
long
lances
droop
to
a
level
,
depressed
*NL*
their
mailed
heads
,
and
so
,
with
their
horse-hair
plumes
streaming
*NL*
straight
out
behind
,
most
gallant
to
see
,
this
lightning
express
*NL*
came
tearing
for
me
!
When
they
were
within
fifteen
yards
,
I
sent
*NL*
that
bomb
with
a
sure
aim
,
and
it
struck
the
ground
just
under
*NL*
the
horses
'
noses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
a
neat
thing
,
very
neat
and
pretty
to
see
.
It
resembled
*NL*
a
steamboat
explosion
on
the
Mississippi
;
and
during
the
next
*NL*
fifteen
minutes
we
stood
under
a
steady
drizzle
of
microscopic
*NL*
fragments
of
knights
and
hardware
and
horse-flesh
.
I
say
we
,
*NL*
for
the
king
joined
the
audience
,
of
course
,
as
soon
as
he
had
got
*NL*
his
breath
again
.
There
was
a
hole
there
which
would
afford
steady
*NL*
work
for
all
the
people
in
that
region
for
some
years
to
come
*NL*
--
in
trying
to
explain
it
,
I
mean
;
as
for
filling
it
up
,
that
service
*NL*
would
be
comparatively
prompt
,
and
would
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
*NL*
select
few
--
peasants
of
that
seignory
;
and
they
would
n't
get
*NL*
anything
for
it
,
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
explained
it
to
the
king
myself
.
I
said
it
was
done
with
a
*NL*
dynamite
bomb
.
This
information
did
him
no
damage
,
because
it
*NL*
left
him
as
intelligent
as
he
was
before
.
However
,
it
was
a
noble
*NL*
miracle
,
in
his
eyes
,
and
was
another
settler
for
Merlin
.
I
thought
*NL*
it
well
enough
to
explain
that
this
was
a
miracle
of
so
rare
a
sort
*NL*
that
it
could
n't
be
done
except
when
the
atmospheric
conditions
*NL*
were
just
right
.
Otherwise
he
would
be
encoring
it
every
time
we
*NL*
had
a
good
subject
,
and
that
would
be
inconvenient
,
because
I
*NL*
had
n't
any
more
bombs
along
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
DRILLING
THE
KING
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
,
when
it
was
just
sunrise
,
and
we
*NL*
had
been
tramping
an
hour
in
the
chill
dawn
,
I
came
to
a
resolution
:
*NL*
the
king
_
must
_
be
drilled
;
things
could
not
go
on
so
,
he
must
be
*NL*
taken
in
hand
and
deliberately
and
conscientiously
drilled
,
or
we
*NL*
could
n't
ever
venture
to
enter
a
dwelling
;
the
very
cats
would
know
*NL*
this
masquerader
for
a
humbug
and
no
peasant
.
So
I
called
a
halt
*NL*
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
as
between
clothes
and
countenance
,
you
are
all
right
,
there
*NL*
is
no
discrepancy
;
but
as
between
your
clothes
and
your
bearing
,
*NL*
you
are
all
wrong
,
there
is
a
most
noticeable
discrepancy
.
Your
*NL*
soldierly
stride
,
your
lordly
port
--
these
will
not
do
.
You
stand
*NL*
too
straight
,
your
looks
are
too
high
,
too
confident
.
The
cares
*NL*
of
a
kingdom
do
not
stoop
the
shoulders
,
they
do
not
droop
the
chin
,
*NL*
they
do
not
depress
the
high
level
of
the
eye-glance
,
they
do
not
*NL*
put
doubt
and
fear
in
the
heart
and
hang
out
the
signs
of
them
*NL*
in
slouching
body
and
unsure
step
.
It
is
the
sordid
cares
of
*NL*
the
lowly
born
that
do
these
things
.
You
must
learn
the
trick
;
*NL*
you
must
imitate
the
trademarks
of
poverty
,
misery
,
oppression
,
*NL*
insult
,
and
the
other
several
and
common
inhumanities
that
sap
*NL*
the
manliness
out
of
a
man
and
make
him
a
loyal
and
proper
and
*NL*
approved
subject
and
a
satisfaction
to
his
masters
,
or
the
very
*NL*
infants
will
know
you
for
better
than
your
disguise
,
and
we
shall
go
*NL*
to
pieces
at
the
first
hut
we
stop
at
.
Pray
try
to
walk
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
took
careful
note
,
and
then
tried
an
imitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
fair
--
pretty
fair
.
Chin
a
little
lower
,
please
--
there
,
very
*NL*
good
.
Eyes
too
high
;
pray
do
n't
look
at
the
horizon
,
look
at
the
*NL*
ground
,
ten
steps
in
front
of
you
.
Ah
--
that
is
better
,
that
is
*NL*
very
good
.
Wait
,
please
;
you
betray
too
much
vigor
,
too
much
*NL*
decision
;
you
want
more
of
a
shamble
.
Look
at
me
,
please
--
this
is
*NL*
what
I
mean
...
Now
you
are
getting
it
;
that
is
the
idea
--
at
least
,
*NL*
it
sort
of
approaches
it
...
Yes
,
that
is
pretty
fair
.
_
But
!
_
*NL*
There
is
a
great
big
something
wanting
,
I
do
n't
quite
know
what
*NL*
it
is
.
Please
walk
thirty
yards
,
so
that
I
can
get
a
perspective
*NL*
on
the
thing
...
Now
,
then
--
your
head
's
right
,
speed
's
right
,
*NL*
shoulders
right
,
eyes
right
,
chin
right
,
gait
,
carriage
,
general
*NL*
style
right
--
everything
's
right
!
And
yet
the
fact
remains
,
the
*NL*
aggregate
's
wrong
.
The
account
do
n't
balance
.
Do
it
again
,
*NL*
please
...
_
Now
_
I
think
I
begin
to
see
what
it
is
.
Yes
,
I
've
*NL*
struck
it
.
You
see
,
the
genuine
spiritlessness
is
wanting
;
that
's
*NL*
what
's
the
trouble
.
It
's
all
_
amateur
_
--
mechanical
details
all
*NL*
right
,
almost
to
a
hair
;
everything
about
the
delusion
perfect
,
*NL*
except
that
it
do
n't
delude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
,
must
one
do
,
to
prevail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
think
...
I
ca
n't
seem
to
quite
get
at
it
.
In
fact
,
there
*NL*
is
n't
anything
that
can
right
the
matter
but
practice
.
This
is
*NL*
a
good
place
for
it
:
roots
and
stony
ground
to
break
up
your
*NL*
stately
gait
,
a
region
not
liable
to
interruption
,
only
one
field
*NL*
and
one
hut
in
sight
,
and
they
so
far
away
that
nobody
could
*NL*
see
us
from
there
.
It
will
be
well
to
move
a
little
off
the
road
*NL*
and
put
in
the
whole
day
drilling
you
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
drill
had
gone
on
a
little
while
,
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sire
,
imagine
that
we
are
at
the
door
of
the
hut
yonder
,
*NL*
and
the
family
are
before
us
.
Proceed
,
please
--
accost
the
head
*NL*
of
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
unconsciously
straightened
up
like
a
monument
,
and
said
,
*NL*
with
frozen
austerity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varlet
,
bring
a
seat
;
and
serve
to
me
what
cheer
ye
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
your
grace
,
that
is
not
well
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
lacketh
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
people
do
not
call
_
each
other
_
varlets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
is
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
only
those
above
them
call
them
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
must
I
try
again
.
I
will
call
him
villein
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-no
;
for
he
may
be
a
freeman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
so
.
Then
peradventure
I
should
call
him
goodman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
answer
,
your
grace

but
it
would
be
still
better
if
*NL*
you
said
friend
,
or
brother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother

to
dirt
like
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

_
we

are
pretending

It

even
true

it

withal

Now
't
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite

*NL*
*NL*
The
king
looked
puzzled
--
he
was
n't
a
very
heavy
weight
,
intellectually
.
*NL*
His
head
was
an
hour-glass
;
it
could
stow
an
idea
,
but
it
had
to
do
*NL*
it
a
grain
at
a
time
,
not
the
whole
idea
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
_
you
_
have
a
seat
also
--
and
sit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
did
not
sit
,
the
man
would
perceive
that
we
were
only
pretending
*NL*
to
be
equals

and
playing
the
deception
pretty
poorly
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
and
truly
said
!
How
wonderful
is
truth
,
come
it
in
*NL*
whatsoever
unexpected
form
it
may
!
Yes
,
he
must
bring
out
seats
*NL*
and
food
for
both
,
and
in
serving
us
present
not
ewer
and
napkin
*NL*
with
more
show
of
respect
to
the
one
than
to
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
is
even
yet
a
detail
that
needs
correcting
.
He
must
*NL*
bring
nothing
outside
;
we
will
go
in
--
in
among
the
dirt
,
and
*NL*
possibly
other
repulsive
things
,
--
and
take
the
food
with
the
*NL*
household
,
and
after
the
fashion
of
the
house
,
and
all
on
equal
*NL*
terms
,
except
the
man
be
of
the
serf
class
;
and
finally
,
there
*NL*
will
be
no
ewer
and
no
napkin
,
whether
he
be
serf
or
free
.
Please
*NL*
walk
again
,
my
liege
.
There
--
it
is
better
--
it
is
the
best
yet
;
*NL*
but
not
perfect
.
The
shoulders
have
known
no
ignobler
burden
*NL*
than
iron
mail
,
and
they
will
not
stoop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
,
then
,
the
bag

I
will
learn
the
spirit

with

not
honor

It
is
the
spirit
that
stoopeth
*NL*
the
shoulders
,
I
ween
,
and
not
the
weight
;
for
armor
is
heavy

proud

a
man
standeth
straight
in
it

*NL*
Nay
,
but
me
no
buts
,
offer
me
no
objections

I
will
have
the
thing
.
*NL*
Strap
it
upon
my
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
complete
now
with
that
knapsack
on
,
and
looked
as
little
*NL*
like
a
king
as
any
man
I
had
ever
seen
.
But
it
was
an
obstinate
*NL*
pair
of
shoulders
;
they
could
not
seem
to
learn
the
trick
of
*NL*
stooping
with
any
sort
of
deceptive
naturalness
.
The
drill
went
on
,
*NL*
I
prompting
and
correcting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
make
believe
you
are
in
debt
,
and
eaten
up
by
relentless
*NL*
creditors
;
you
are
out
of
work
--
which
is
horse-shoeing
,
let
us
*NL*
say
--
and
can
get
none
;
and
your
wife
is
sick
,
your
children
are
*NL*
crying
because
they
are
hungry
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
I
drilled
him
as
representing
in
turn
all
*NL*
sorts
of
people
out
of
luck
and
suffering
dire
privations
and
*NL*
misfortunes
.
But
lord
,
it
was
only
just
words
,
words
--
they
meant
*NL*
nothing
in
the
world
to
him
,
I
might
just
as
well
have
whistled
.
*NL*
Words
realize
nothing
,
vivify
nothing
to
you
,
unless
you
have
*NL*
suffered
in
your
own
person
the
thing
which
the
words
try
to
*NL*
describe
.
There
are
wise
people
who
talk
ever
so
knowingly
and
*NL*
complacently
about
``
the
working
classes
,
''
and
satisfy
themselves
*NL*
that
a
day
's
hard
intellectual
work
is
very
much
harder
than
*NL*
a
day
's
hard
manual
toil
,
and
is
righteously
entitled
to
much
*NL*
bigger
pay
.
Why
,
they
really
think
that
,
you
know
,
because
they
*NL*
know
all
about
the
one
,
but
have
n't
tried
the
other
.
But
I
know
*NL*
all
about
both
;
and
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
there
is
n't
money
*NL*
enough
in
the
universe
to
hire
me
to
swing
a
pickaxe
thirty
days
,
*NL*
but
I
will
do
the
hardest
kind
of
intellectual
work
for
just
as
*NL*
near
nothing
as
you
can
cipher
it
down
--
and
I
will
be
satisfied
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Intellectual
``
work
''
is
misnamed
;
it
is
a
pleasure
,
a
dissipation
,
*NL*
and
is
its
own
highest
reward
.
The
poorest
paid
architect
,
*NL*
engineer
,
general
,
author
,
sculptor
,
painter
,
lecturer
,
advocate
,
*NL*
legislator
,
actor
,
preacher
,
singer
is
constructively
in
heaven
*NL*
when
he
is
at
work
;
and
as
for
the
musician
with
the
fiddle-bow
*NL*
in
his
hand
who
sits
in
the
midst
of
a
great
orchestra
with
the
*NL*
ebbing
and
flowing
tides
of
divine
sound
washing
over
him
--
why
,
*NL*
certainly
,
he
is
at
work
,
if
you
wish
to
call
it
that
,
but
lord
,
*NL*
it
's
a
sarcasm
just
the
same
.
The
law
of
work
does
seem
utterly
*NL*
unfair
--
but
there
it
is
,
and
nothing
can
change
it
:
the
higher
*NL*
the
pay
in
enjoyment
the
worker
gets
out
of
it
,
the
higher
shall
*NL*
be
his
pay
in
cash
,
also
.
And
it
's
also
the
very
law
of
those
*NL*
transparent
swindles
,
transmissible
nobility
and
kingship
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SMALLPOX
HUT
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
at
that
hut
at
mid-afternoon
,
we
saw
no
signs
*NL*
of
life
about
it
.
The
field
near
by
had
been
denuded
of
its
crop
*NL*
some
time
before
,
and
had
a
skinned
look
,
so
exhaustively
had
*NL*
it
been
harvested
and
gleaned
.
Fences
,
sheds
,
everything
had
a
*NL*
ruined
look
,
and
were
eloquent
of
poverty
.
No
animal
was
around
*NL*
anywhere
,
no
living
thing
in
sight
.
The
stillness
was
awful
,
it
*NL*
was
like
the
stillness
of
death
.
The
cabin
was
a
one-story
one
,
*NL*
whose
thatch
was
black
with
age
,
and
ragged
from
lack
of
repair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
stood
a
trifle
ajar
.
We
approached
it
stealthily
--
on
tiptoe
*NL*
and
at
half-breath
--
for
that
is
the
way
one
's
feeling
makes
him
do
,
*NL*
at
such
a
time
.
The
king
knocked
.
We
waited
.
No
answer
.
Knocked
*NL*
again
.
No
answer
.
I
pushed
the
door
softly
open
and
looked
in
.
*NL*
I
made
out
some
dim
forms
,
and
a
woman
started
up
from
the
ground
*NL*
and
stared
at
me
,
as
one
does
who
is
wakened
from
sleep
.
Presently
*NL*
she
found
her
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
mercy
!
''
she
pleaded
.
``
All
is
taken
,
nothing
is
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
come
to
take
anything
,
poor
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
a
priest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
come
not
from
the
lord
of
the
manor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
a
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
,
for
the
fear
of
God
,
who
visits
with
misery
and
death
*NL*
such
as
be
harmless
,
tarry
not
here
,
but
fly
!
This
place
is
under
*NL*
his
curse
--
and
his
Church
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
come
in
and
help
you
--
you
are
sick
and
in
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
better
used
to
the
dim
light
now
.
I
could
see
her
hollow
*NL*
eyes
fixed
upon
me
.
I
could
see
how
emaciated
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
the
place
is
under
the
Church
's
ban
.
Save
yourself
*NL*
--
and
go
,
before
some
straggler
see
thee
here
,
and
report
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
yourself
no
trouble
about
me
;
I
do
n't
care
anything
for
the
*NL*
Church
's
curse
.
Let
me
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
all
good
spirits
--
if
there
be
any
such
--
bless
thee
for
that
*NL*
word
.
Would
God
I
had
a
sup
of
water
!
--
but
hold
,
hold
,
forget
*NL*
I
said
it
,
and
fly
;
for
there
is
that
here
that
even
he
that
*NL*
feareth
not
the
Church
must
fear
:
this
disease
whereof
we
die
.
*NL*
Leave
us
,
thou
brave
,
good
stranger
,
and
take
with
thee
such
*NL*
whole
and
sincere
blessing
as
them
that
be
accursed
can
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
this
I
had
picked
up
a
wooden
bowl
and
was
rushing
*NL*
past
the
king
on
my
way
to
the
brook
.
It
was
ten
yards
away
.
*NL*
When
I
got
back
and
entered
,
the
king
was
within
,
and
was
opening
*NL*
the
shutter
that
closed
the
window-hole
,
to
let
in
air
and
light
.
*NL*
The
place
was
full
of
a
foul
stench
.
I
put
the
bowl
to
the
woman
's
*NL*
lips
,
and
as
she
gripped
it
with
her
eager
talons
the
shutter
came
*NL*
open
and
a
strong
light
flooded
her
face
.
Smallpox
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
sprang
to
the
king
,
and
said
in
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
the
door
on
the
instant
,
sire
!
the
woman
is
dying
of
that
*NL*
disease
that
wasted
the
skirts
of
Camelot
two
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
budge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
truth
I
shall
remain
--
and
likewise
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
whispered
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
King
,
it
must
not
be
.
You
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
mean
well
,
and
ye
speak
not
unwisely
.
But
it
were
shame
that
*NL*
a
king
should
know
fear
,
and
shame
that
belted
knight
should
*NL*
withhold
his
hand
where
be
such
as
need
succor
.
Peace
,
I
will
*NL*
not
go
.
It
is
you
who
must
go
.
The
Church
's
ban
is
not
upon
me
,
*NL*
but
it
forbiddeth
you
to
be
here
,
and
she
will
deal
with
you
with
*NL*
a
heavy
hand
an
word
come
to
her
of
your
trespass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
desperate
place
for
him
to
be
in
,
and
might
cost
him
his
*NL*
life
,
but
it
was
no
use
to
argue
with
him
.
If
he
considered
his
*NL*
knightly
honor
at
stake
here
,
that
was
the
end
of
argument
;
he
*NL*
would
stay
,
and
nothing
could
prevent
it
;
I
was
aware
of
that
.
*NL*
And
so
I
dropped
the
subject
.
The
woman
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
sir
,
of
your
kindness
will
ye
climb
the
ladder
there
,
*NL*
and
bring
me
news
of
what
ye
find
?
Be
not
afraid
to
report
,
*NL*
for
times
can
come
when
even
a
mother
's
heart
is
past
breaking
*NL*
--
being
already
broke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abide
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
and
give
the
woman
to
eat
.
I
will
go
.
''
*NL*
And
he
put
down
the
knapsack
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
to
start
,
but
the
king
had
already
started
.
He
halted
,
*NL*
and
looked
down
upon
a
man
who
lay
in
a
dim
light
,
and
had
not
*NL*
noticed
us
thus
far
,
or
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
husband
?
''
the
king
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
be
thanked
for
that
one
charity
,
yes
--
these
three
hours
.
*NL*
Where
shall
I
pay
to
the
full
,
my
gratitude
!
for
my
heart
is
*NL*
bursting
with
it
for
that
sleep
he
sleepeth
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
be
careful
.
We
will
not
wake
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
no
,
that
ye
will
not
,
for
he
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
triumph
it
is
to
know
it
!
None
can
harm
him
,
none
*NL*
insult
him
more
.
He
is
in
heaven
now
,
and
happy
;
or
if
not
there
,
*NL*
he
bides
in
hell
and
is
content
;
for
in
that
place
he
will
find
*NL*
neither
abbot
nor
yet
bishop
.
We
were
boy
and
girl
together
;
we
*NL*
were
man
and
wife
these
five
and
twenty
years
,
and
never
separated
*NL*
till
this
day
.
Think
how
long
that
is
to
love
and
suffer
together
.
*NL*
This
morning
was
he
out
of
his
mind
,
and
in
his
fancy
we
were
*NL*
boy
and
girl
again
and
wandering
in
the
happy
fields
;
and
so
in
*NL*
that
innocent
glad
converse
wandered
he
far
and
farther
,
still
*NL*
lightly
gossiping
,
and
entered
into
those
other
fields
we
know
*NL*
not
of
,
and
was
shut
away
from
mortal
sight
.
And
so
there
was
*NL*
no
parting
,
for
in
his
fancy
I
went
with
him
;
he
knew
not
but
*NL*
I
went
with
him
,
my
hand
in
his
--
my
young
soft
hand
,
not
this
*NL*
withered
claw
.
Ah
,
yes
,
to
go
,
and
know
it
not
;
to
separate
and
*NL*
know
it
not
;
how
could
one
go
peace
--
fuller
than
that
?
It
was
*NL*
his
reward
for
a
cruel
life
patiently
borne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
noise
from
the
direction
of
the
dim
corner
where
*NL*
the
ladder
was
.
It
was
the
king
descending
.
I
could
see
that
he
*NL*
was
bearing
something
in
one
arm
,
and
assisting
himself
with
the
*NL*
other
.
He
came
forward
into
the
light
;
upon
his
breast
lay
a
*NL*
slender
girl
of
fifteen
.
She
was
but
half
conscious
;
she
was
dying
*NL*
of
smallpox
.
Here
was
heroism
at
its
last
and
loftiest
possibility
,
*NL*
its
utmost
summit
;
this
was
challenging
death
in
the
open
field
*NL*
unarmed
,
with
all
the
odds
against
the
challenger
,
no
reward
set
*NL*
upon
the
contest
,
and
no
admiring
world
in
silks
and
cloth
of
gold
*NL*
to
gaze
and
applaud
;
and
yet
the
king
's
bearing
was
as
serenely
*NL*
brave
as
it
had
always
been
in
those
cheaper
contests
where
knight
*NL*
meets
knight
in
equal
fight
and
clothed
in
protecting
steel
.
He
*NL*
was
great
now
;
sublimely
great
.
The
rude
statues
of
his
ancestors
*NL*
in
his
palace
should
have
an
addition
--
I
would
see
to
that
;
and
it
*NL*
would
not
be
a
mailed
king
killing
a
giant
or
a
dragon
,
like
the
*NL*
rest
,
it
would
be
a
king
in
commoner
's
garb
bearing
death
in
his
*NL*
arms
that
a
peasant
mother
might
look
her
last
upon
her
child
and
*NL*
be
comforted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
the
girl
down
by
her
mother
,
who
poured
out
endearments
*NL*
and
caresses
from
an
overflowing
heart
,
and
one
could
detect
a
*NL*
flickering
faint
light
of
response
in
the
child
's
eyes
,
but
that
*NL*
was
all
.
The
mother
hung
over
her
,
kissing
her
,
petting
her
,
and
*NL*
imploring
her
to
speak
,
but
the
lips
only
moved
and
no
sound
came
.
*NL*
I
snatched
my
liquor
flask
from
my
knapsack
,
but
the
woman
forbade
*NL*
me
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
she
does
not
suffer
;
it
is
better
so
.
It
might
bring
her
back
*NL*
to
life
.
None
that
be
so
good
and
kind
as
ye
are
would
do
her
*NL*
that
cruel
hurt
.
For
look
you
--
what
is
left
to
live
for
?
Her
*NL*
brothers
are
gone
,
her
father
is
gone
,
her
mother
goeth
,
the
*NL*
Church
's
curse
is
upon
her
,
and
none
may
shelter
or
befriend
her
*NL*
even
though
she
lay
perishing
in
the
road
.
She
is
desolate
.
I
have
*NL*
not
asked
you
,
good
heart
,
if
her
sister
be
still
on
live
,
here
*NL*
overhead
;
I
had
no
need
;
ye
had
gone
back
,
else
,
and
not
left
*NL*
the
poor
thing
forsaken
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
lieth
at
peace
,
''
interrupted
the
king
,
in
a
subdued
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
change
it
.
How
rich
is
this
day
in
happiness
!
Ah
,
*NL*
my
Annis
,
thou
shalt
join
thy
sister
soon
--
thou
`
rt
on
thy
way
,
*NL*
and
these
be
merciful
friends
that
will
not
hinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
she
fell
to
murmuring
and
cooing
over
the
girl
again
,
and
*NL*
softly
stroking
her
face
and
hair
,
and
kissing
her
and
calling
her
*NL*
by
endearing
names
;
but
there
was
scarcely
sign
of
response
now
*NL*
in
the
glazing
eyes
.
I
saw
tears
well
from
the
king
's
eyes
,
and
*NL*
trickle
down
his
face
.
The
woman
noticed
them
,
too
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
know
that
sign
:
thou
`
st
a
wife
at
home
,
poor
soul
,
and
*NL*
you
and
she
have
gone
hungry
to
bed
,
many
's
the
time
,
that
the
*NL*
little
ones
might
have
your
crust
;
you
know
what
poverty
is
,
and
*NL*
the
daily
insults
of
your
betters
,
and
the
heavy
hand
of
the
Church
*NL*
and
the
king
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
winced
under
this
accidental
home-shot
,
but
kept
still
;
*NL*
he
was
learning
his
part
;
and
he
was
playing
it
well
,
too
,
for
*NL*
a
pretty
dull
beginner
.
I
struck
up
a
diversion
.
I
offered
the
*NL*
woman
food
and
liquor
,
but
she
refused
both
.
She
would
allow
*NL*
nothing
to
come
between
her
and
the
release
of
death
.
Then
I
slipped
*NL*
away
and
brought
the
dead
child
from
aloft
,
and
laid
it
by
her
.
*NL*
This
broke
her
down
again
,
and
there
was
another
scene
that
was
*NL*
full
of
heartbreak
.
By
and
by
I
made
another
diversion
,
and
beguiled
*NL*
her
to
sketch
her
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
know
it
well
yourselves
,
having
suffered
it
--
for
truly
none
*NL*
of
our
condition
in
Britain
escape
it
.
It
is
the
old
,
weary
tale
.
*NL*
We
fought
and
struggled
and
succeeded
;
meaning
by
success
,
that
*NL*
we
lived
and
did
not
die
;
more
than
that
is
not
to
be
claimed
.
No
*NL*
troubles
came
that
we
could
not
outlive
,
till
this
year
brought
*NL*
them
;
then
came
they
all
at
once
,
as
one
might
say
,
and
overwhelmed
*NL*
us
.
Years
ago
the
lord
of
the
manor
planted
certain
fruit
trees
on
*NL*
our
farm
;
in
the
best
part
of
it
,
too
--
a
grievous
wrong
and
shame
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
his
right
,
''
interrupted
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
denieth
that
,
indeed
;
an
the
law
mean
anything
,
what
is
*NL*
the
lord
's
is
his
,
and
what
is
mine
is
his
also
.
Our
farm
was
*NL*
ours
by
lease
,
therefore
't
was
likewise
his
,
to
do
with
it
as
he
*NL*
would
.
Some
little
time
ago
,
three
of
those
trees
were
found
hewn
*NL*
down
.
Our
three
grown
sons
ran
frightened
to
report
the
crime
.
*NL*
Well
,
in
his
lordship
's
dungeon
there
they
lie
,
who
saith
there
*NL*
shall
they
lie
and
rot
till
they
confess
.
They
have
naught
to
*NL*
confess
,
being
innocent
,
wherefore
there
will
they
remain
until
*NL*
they
die
.
Ye
know
that
right
well
,
I
ween
.
Think
how
this
left
us
;
*NL*
a
man
,
a
woman
and
two
children
,
to
gather
a
crop
that
was
planted
*NL*
by
so
much
greater
force
,
yes
,
and
protect
it
night
and
day
from
*NL*
pigeons
and
prowling
animals
that
be
sacred
and
must
not
be
hurt
*NL*
by
any
of
our
sort
.
When
my
lord
's
crop
was
nearly
ready
for
*NL*
the
harvest
,
so
also
was
ours
;
when
his
bell
rang
to
call
us
to
*NL*
his
fields
to
harvest
his
crop
for
nothing
,
he
would
not
allow
that
*NL*
I
and
my
two
girls
should
count
for
our
three
captive
sons
,
but
*NL*
for
only
two
of
them
;
so
,
for
the
lacking
one
were
we
daily
fined
.
*NL*
All
this
time
our
own
crop
was
perishing
through
neglect
;
and
so
*NL*
both
the
priest
and
his
lordship
fined
us
because
their
shares
*NL*
of
it
were
suffering
through
damage
.
In
the
end
the
fines
ate
up
*NL*
our
crop
--
and
they
took
it
all
;
they
took
it
all
and
made
us
harvest
*NL*
it
for
them
,
without
pay
or
food
,
and
we
starving
.
Then
the
worst
*NL*
came
when
I
,
being
out
of
my
mind
with
hunger
and
loss
of
my
boys
,
*NL*
and
grief
to
see
my
husband
and
my
little
maids
in
rags
and
misery
*NL*
and
despair
,
uttered
a
deep
blasphemy
--
oh
!
a
thousand
of
them
!
*NL*
--
against
the
Church
and
the
Church
's
ways
.
It
was
ten
days
ago
.
*NL*
I
had
fallen
sick
with
this
disease
,
and
it
was
to
the
priest
*NL*
I
said
the
words
,
for
he
was
come
to
chide
me
for
lack
of
due
*NL*
humility
under
the
chastening
hand
of
God
.
He
carried
my
trespass
*NL*
to
his
betters
;
I
was
stubborn
;
wherefore
,
presently
upon
my
head
*NL*
and
upon
all
heads
that
were
dear
to
me
,
fell
the
curse
of
Rome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
day
we
are
avoided
,
shunned
with
horror
.
None
has
*NL*
come
near
this
hut
to
know
whether
we
live
or
not
.
The
rest
of
us
*NL*
were
taken
down
.
Then
I
roused
me
and
got
up
,
as
wife
and
mother
*NL*
will
.
It
was
little
they
could
have
eaten
in
any
case
;
it
was
*NL*
less
than
little
they
had
to
eat
.
But
there
was
water
,
and
I
gave
*NL*
them
that
.
How
they
craved
it
!
and
how
they
blessed
it
!
But
the
*NL*
end
came
yesterday
;
my
strength
broke
down
.
Yesterday
was
the
*NL*
last
time
I
ever
saw
my
husband
and
this
youngest
child
alive
.
*NL*
I
have
lain
here
all
these
hours
--
these
ages
,
ye
may
say
--
listening
,
*NL*
listening
for
any
sound
up
there
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
sharp
quick
glance
at
her
eldest
daughter
,
then
cried
*NL*
out
,
``
Oh
,
my
darling
!
''
and
feebly
gathered
the
stiffening
form
*NL*
to
her
sheltering
arms
.
She
had
recognized
the
death-rattle
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
TRAGEDY
OF
THE
MANOR-HOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
all
was
over
,
and
we
sat
in
the
presence
of
four
*NL*
corpses
.
We
covered
them
with
such
rags
as
we
could
find
,
and
*NL*
started
away
,
fastening
the
door
behind
us
.
Their
home
must
be
*NL*
these
people
's
grave
,
for
they
could
not
have
Christian
burial
,
*NL*
or
be
admitted
to
consecrated
ground
.
They
were
as
dogs
,
wild
*NL*
beasts
,
lepers
,
and
no
soul
that
valued
its
hope
of
eternal
life
*NL*
would
throw
it
away
by
meddling
in
any
sort
with
these
rebuked
and
*NL*
smitten
outcasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
not
moved
four
steps
when
I
caught
a
sound
as
of
footsteps
*NL*
upon
gravel
.
My
heart
flew
to
my
throat
.
We
must
not
be
seen
*NL*
coming
from
that
house
.
I
plucked
at
the
king
's
robe
and
we
drew
*NL*
back
and
took
shelter
behind
the
corner
of
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
are
safe
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
it
was
a
close
call
--
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
If
the
night
had
been
lighter
he
might
have
seen
us
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
he
seemed
to
be
so
near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mayhap
it
is
but
a
beast
and
not
a
man
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
But
man
or
beast
,
it
will
be
wise
to
stay
here
a
minute
*NL*
and
let
it
get
by
and
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
It
cometh
hither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
True
again
.
The
step
was
coming
toward
us
--
straight
toward
the
hut
.
*NL*
It
must
be
a
beast
,
then
,
and
we
might
as
well
have
saved
our
*NL*
trepidation
.
I
was
going
to
step
out
,
but
the
king
laid
his
hand
*NL*
upon
my
arm
.
There
was
a
moment
of
silence
,
then
we
heard
a
soft
*NL*
knock
on
the
cabin
door
.
It
made
me
shiver
.
Presently
the
knock
*NL*
was
repeated
,
and
then
we
heard
these
words
in
a
guarded
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
Father
!
Open
--
we
have
got
free
,
and
we
bring
news
to
*NL*
pale
your
cheeks
but
glad
your
hearts
;
and
we
may
not
tarry
,
but
*NL*
must
fly
!
And
--
but
they
answer
not
.
Mother
!
father
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
the
king
toward
the
other
end
of
the
hut
and
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
--
now
we
can
get
to
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
hesitated
,
was
going
to
demur
;
but
just
then
we
heard
*NL*
the
door
give
way
,
and
knew
that
those
desolate
men
were
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
their
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
liege
!
in
a
moment
they
will
strike
a
light
,
and
then
*NL*
will
follow
that
which
it
would
break
your
heart
to
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
hesitate
this
time
.
The
moment
we
were
in
the
road
*NL*
I
ran
;
and
after
a
moment
he
threw
dignity
aside
and
followed
.
*NL*
I
did
not
want
to
think
of
what
was
happening
in
the
hut
--
I
could
n't
*NL*
bear
it
;
I
wanted
to
drive
it
out
of
my
mind
;
so
I
struck
into
the
*NL*
first
subject
that
lay
under
that
one
in
my
mind
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
the
disease
those
people
died
of
,
and
so
have
nothing
*NL*
to
fear
;
but
if
you
have
not
had
it
also
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
in
upon
me
to
say
he
was
in
trouble
,
and
it
was
his
*NL*
conscience
that
was
troubling
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
young
men
have
got
free
,
they
say
--
but
_
how
_
?
It
is
not
*NL*
likely
that
their
lord
hath
set
them
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
make
no
doubt
they
escaped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
trouble
;
I
have
a
fear
that
this
is
so
,
and
your
*NL*
suspicion
doth
confirm
it
,
you
having
the
same
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
call
it
by
that
name
though
.
I
do
suspect
that
they
*NL*
escaped
,
but
if
they
did
,
I
am
not
sorry
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sorry
,
I
_
think
_
--
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
there
for
one
to
be
troubled
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
If
_
they
did
escape
,
then
are
we
bound
in
duty
to
lay
hands
upon
*NL*
them
and
deliver
them
again
to
their
lord
;
for
it
is
not
seemly
*NL*
that
one
of
his
quality
should
suffer
a
so
insolent
and
high-handed
*NL*
outrage
from
persons
of
their
base
degree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
it
was
again
.
He
could
see
only
one
side
of
it
.
He
was
*NL*
born
so
,
educated
so
,
his
veins
were
full
of
ancestral
blood
that
*NL*
was
rotten
with
this
sort
of
unconscious
brutality
,
brought
down
*NL*
by
inheritance
from
a
long
procession
of
hearts
that
had
each
done
*NL*
its
share
toward
poisoning
the
stream
.
To
imprison
these
men
*NL*
without
proof
,
and
starve
their
kindred
,
was
no
harm
,
for
they
were
*NL*
merely
peasants
and
subject
to
the
will
and
pleasure
of
their
lord
,
*NL*
no
matter
what
fearful
form
it
might
take
;
but
for
these
men
to
*NL*
break
out
of
unjust
captivity
was
insult
and
outrage
,
and
a
thing
*NL*
not
to
be
countenanced
by
any
conscientious
person
who
knew
his
*NL*
duty
to
his
sacred
caste
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
worked
more
than
half
an
hour
before
I
got
him
to
change
the
*NL*
subject
--
and
even
then
an
outside
matter
did
it
for
me
.
This
was
*NL*
a
something
which
caught
our
eyes
as
we
struck
the
summit
of
a
*NL*
small
hill
--
a
red
glow
,
a
good
way
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fire
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Fires
interested
me
considerably
,
because
I
was
getting
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
an
insurance
business
started
,
and
was
also
training
some
*NL*
horses
and
building
some
steam
fire-engines
,
with
an
eye
to
a
paid
*NL*
fire
department
by
and
by
.
The
priests
opposed
both
my
fire
and
*NL*
life
insurance
,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
an
insolent
attempt
to
*NL*
hinder
the
decrees
of
God
;
and
if
you
pointed
out
that
they
did
not
*NL*
hinder
the
decrees
in
the
least
,
but
only
modified
the
hard
*NL*
consequences
of
them
if
you
took
out
policies
and
had
luck
,
they
*NL*
retorted
that
that
was
gambling
against
the
decrees
of
God
,
and
was
*NL*
just
as
bad
.
So
they
managed
to
damage
those
industries
more
*NL*
or
less
,
but
I
got
even
on
my
accident
business
.
As
a
rule
,
a
knight
*NL*
is
a
lummux
,
and
some
times
even
a
labrick
,
and
hence
open
to
pretty
*NL*
poor
arguments
when
they
come
glibly
from
a
superstition-monger
,
*NL*
but
even
_
he
_
could
see
the
practical
side
of
a
thing
once
in
a
while
;
*NL*
and
so
of
late
you
could
n't
clean
up
a
tournament
and
pile
the
*NL*
result
without
finding
one
of
my
accident-tickets
in
every
helmet
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
there
awhile
,
in
the
thick
darkness
and
stillness
,
looking
*NL*
toward
the
red
blur
in
the
distance
,
and
trying
to
make
out
the
*NL*
meaning
of
a
far-away
murmur
that
rose
and
fell
fitfully
on
the
*NL*
night
.
Sometimes
it
swelled
up
and
for
a
moment
seemed
less
*NL*
remote
;
but
when
we
were
hopefully
expecting
it
to
betray
its
cause
*NL*
and
nature
,
it
dulled
and
sank
again
,
carrying
its
mystery
with
it
.
*NL*
We
started
down
the
hill
in
its
direction
,
and
the
winding
road
*NL*
plunged
us
at
once
into
almost
solid
darkness
--
darkness
that
was
*NL*
packed
and
crammed
in
between
two
tall
forest
walls
.
We
groped
*NL*
along
down
for
half
a
mile
,
perhaps
,
that
murmur
growing
more
and
*NL*
more
distinct
all
the
time
.
The
coming
storm
threatening
more
and
*NL*
more
,
with
now
and
then
a
little
shiver
of
wind
,
a
faint
show
of
*NL*
lightning
,
and
dull
grumblings
of
distant
thunder
.
I
was
in
the
*NL*
lead
.
I
ran
against
something
--
a
soft
heavy
something
which
gave
,
*NL*
slightly
,
to
the
impulse
of
my
weight
;
at
the
same
moment
the
*NL*
lightning
glared
out
,
and
within
a
foot
of
my
face
was
the
writhing
*NL*
face
of
a
man
who
was
hanging
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
!
That
is
,
*NL*
it
seemed
to
be
writhing
,
but
it
was
not
.
It
was
a
grewsome
sight
.
*NL*
Straightway
there
was
an
ear-splitting
explosion
of
thunder
,
and
*NL*
the
bottom
of
heaven
fell
out
;
the
rain
poured
down
in
a
deluge
.
*NL*
No
matter
,
we
must
try
to
cut
this
man
down
,
on
the
chance
that
*NL*
there
might
be
life
in
him
yet
,
must
n't
we
?
The
lightning
came
*NL*
quick
and
sharp
now
,
and
the
place
was
alternately
noonday
and
*NL*
midnight
.
One
moment
the
man
would
be
hanging
before
me
in
an
*NL*
intense
light
,
and
the
next
he
was
blotted
out
again
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
I
told
the
king
we
must
cut
him
down
.
The
king
at
once
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
hanged
himself
,
he
was
willing
to
lose
him
property
to
*NL*
his
lord
;
so
let
him
be
.
If
others
hanged
him
,
belike
they
had
*NL*
the
right
--
let
him
hang
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
me
no
buts
,
but
even
leave
him
as
he
is
.
And
for
yet
another
*NL*
reason
.
When
the
lightning
cometh
again
--
there
,
look
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
others
hanging
,
within
fifty
yards
of
us
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
weather
meet
for
doing
useless
courtesies
unto
dead
folk
.
*NL*
They
are
past
thanking
you
.
Come
--
it
is
unprofitable
to
tarry
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
reason
in
what
he
said
,
so
we
moved
on
.
Within
the
next
*NL*
mile
we
counted
six
more
hanging
forms
by
the
blaze
of
the
lightning
,
*NL*
and
altogether
it
was
a
grisly
excursion
.
That
murmur
was
a
murmur
*NL*
no
longer
,
it
was
a
roar
;
a
roar
of
men
's
voices
.
A
man
came
flying
*NL*
by
now
,
dimly
through
the
darkness
,
and
other
men
chasing
him
.
*NL*
They
disappeared
.
Presently
another
case
of
the
kind
occurred
,
*NL*
and
then
another
and
another
.
Then
a
sudden
turn
of
the
road
*NL*
brought
us
in
sight
of
that
fire
--
it
was
a
large
manor-house
,
and
*NL*
little
or
nothing
was
left
of
it
--
and
everywhere
men
were
flying
*NL*
and
other
men
raging
after
them
in
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
warned
the
king
that
this
was
not
a
safe
place
for
strangers
.
*NL*
We
would
better
get
away
from
the
light
,
until
matters
should
*NL*
improve
.
We
stepped
back
a
little
,
and
hid
in
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
wood
.
From
this
hiding-place
we
saw
both
men
and
women
hunted
*NL*
by
the
mob
.
The
fearful
work
went
on
until
nearly
dawn
.
Then
,
*NL*
the
fire
being
out
and
the
storm
spent
,
the
voices
and
flying
*NL*
footsteps
presently
ceased
,
and
darkness
and
stillness
reigned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
ventured
out
,
and
hurried
cautiously
away
;
and
although
we
were
*NL*
worn
out
and
sleepy
,
we
kept
on
until
we
had
put
this
place
some
*NL*
miles
behind
us
.
Then
we
asked
hospitality
at
the
hut
of
a
charcoal
*NL*
burner
,
and
got
what
was
to
be
had
.
A
woman
was
up
and
about
,
but
*NL*
the
man
was
still
asleep
,
on
a
straw
shake-down
,
on
the
clay
floor
.
*NL*
The
woman
seemed
uneasy
until
I
explained
that
we
were
travelers
*NL*
and
had
lost
our
way
and
been
wandering
in
the
woods
all
night
.
*NL*
She
became
talkative
,
then
,
and
asked
if
we
had
heard
of
the
*NL*
terrible
goings-on
at
the
manor-house
of
Abblasoure
.
Yes
,
we
had
*NL*
heard
of
them
,
but
what
we
wanted
now
was
rest
and
sleep
.
The
*NL*
king
broke
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sell
us
the
house
and
take
yourselves
away
,
for
we
be
perilous
*NL*
company
,
being
late
come
from
people
that
died
of
the
Spotted
Death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
good
of
him
,
but
unnecessary
.
One
of
the
commonest
decorations
*NL*
of
the
nation
was
the
waffle-iron
face
.
I
had
early
noticed
that
*NL*
the
woman
and
her
husband
were
both
so
decorated
.
She
made
us
*NL*
entirely
welcome
,
and
had
no
fears
;
and
plainly
she
was
immensely
*NL*
impressed
by
the
king
's
proposition
;
for
,
of
course
,
it
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
an
event
in
her
life
to
run
across
a
person
of
the
king
's
*NL*
humble
appearance
who
was
ready
to
buy
a
man
's
house
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
a
night
's
lodging
.
It
gave
her
a
large
respect
for
us
,
and
she
*NL*
strained
the
lean
possibilities
of
her
hovel
to
the
utmost
to
make
*NL*
us
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
slept
till
far
into
the
afternoon
,
and
then
got
up
hungry
enough
to
*NL*
make
cotter
fare
quite
palatable
to
the
king
,
the
more
particularly
*NL*
as
it
was
scant
in
quantity
.
And
also
in
variety
;
it
consisted
*NL*
solely
of
onions
,
salt
,
and
the
national
black
bread
made
out
of
*NL*
horse-feed
.
The
woman
told
us
about
the
affair
of
the
evening
*NL*
before
.
At
ten
or
eleven
at
night
,
when
everybody
was
in
bed
,
*NL*
the
manor-house
burst
into
flames
.
The
country-side
swarmed
to
*NL*
the
rescue
,
and
the
family
were
saved
,
with
one
exception
,
the
*NL*
master
.
He
did
not
appear
.
Everybody
was
frantic
over
this
loss
,
*NL*
and
two
brave
yeomen
sacrificed
their
lives
in
ransacking
the
*NL*
burning
house
seeking
that
valuable
personage
.
But
after
a
while
*NL*
he
was
found
--
what
was
left
of
him
--
which
was
his
corpse
.
It
was
*NL*
in
a
copse
three
hundred
yards
away
,
bound
,
gagged
,
stabbed
in
a
*NL*
dozen
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
had
done
this
?
Suspicion
fell
upon
a
humble
family
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
who
had
been
lately
treated
with
peculiar
harshness
*NL*
by
the
baron
;
and
from
these
people
the
suspicion
easily
extended
*NL*
itself
to
their
relatives
and
familiars
.
A
suspicion
was
enough
;
*NL*
my
lord
's
liveried
retainers
proclaimed
an
instant
crusade
against
*NL*
these
people
,
and
were
promptly
joined
by
the
community
in
general
.
*NL*
The
woman
's
husband
had
been
active
with
the
mob
,
and
had
not
*NL*
returned
home
until
nearly
dawn
.
He
was
gone
now
to
find
out
*NL*
what
the
general
result
had
been
.
While
we
were
still
talking
he
*NL*
came
back
from
his
quest
.
His
report
was
revolting
enough
.
Eighteen
*NL*
persons
hanged
or
butchered
,
and
two
yeomen
and
thirteen
prisoners
*NL*
lost
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
many
prisoners
were
there
altogether
in
the
vaults
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
every
one
of
them
was
lost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
people
arrived
in
time
to
save
the
family
;
how
is
it
they
*NL*
could
save
none
of
the
prisoners
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
puzzled
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
one
unlock
the
vaults
at
such
a
time
?
Marry
,
some
would
*NL*
have
escaped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
mean
that
nobody
_
did
_
unlock
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
went
near
them
,
either
to
lock
or
unlock
.
It
standeth
to
*NL*
reason
that
the
bolts
were
fast
;
wherefore
it
was
only
needful
*NL*
to
establish
a
watch
,
so
that
if
any
broke
the
bonds
he
might
not
*NL*
escape
,
but
be
taken
.
None
were
taken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natheless
,
three
did
escape
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
and
ye
will
do
well
*NL*
to
publish
it
and
set
justice
upon
their
track
,
for
these
murthered
*NL*
the
baron
and
fired
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
expecting
he
would
come
out
with
that
.
For
a
moment
*NL*
the
man
and
his
wife
showed
an
eager
interest
in
this
news
and
*NL*
an
impatience
to
go
out
and
spread
it
;
then
a
sudden
something
*NL*
else
betrayed
itself
in
their
faces
,
and
they
began
to
ask
questions
.
*NL*
I
answered
the
questions
myself
,
and
narrowly
watched
the
effects
*NL*
produced
.
I
was
soon
satisfied
that
the
knowledge
of
who
these
*NL*
three
prisoners
were
had
somehow
changed
the
atmosphere
;
that
*NL*
our
hosts
'
continued
eagerness
to
go
and
spread
the
news
was
now
*NL*
only
pretended
and
not
real
.
The
king
did
not
notice
the
change
,
*NL*
and
I
was
glad
of
that
.
I
worked
the
conversation
around
toward
*NL*
other
details
of
the
night
's
proceedings
,
and
noted
that
these
*NL*
people
were
relieved
to
have
it
take
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painful
thing
observable
about
all
this
business
was
the
*NL*
alacrity
with
which
this
oppressed
community
had
turned
their
*NL*
cruel
hands
against
their
own
class
in
the
interest
of
the
common
*NL*
oppressor
.
This
man
and
woman
seemed
to
feel
that
in
a
quarrel
*NL*
between
a
person
of
their
own
class
and
his
lord
,
it
was
the
natural
*NL*
and
proper
and
rightful
thing
for
that
poor
devil
's
whole
caste
*NL*
to
side
with
the
master
and
fight
his
battle
for
him
,
without
ever
*NL*
stopping
to
inquire
into
the
rights
or
wrongs
of
the
matter
.
This
*NL*
man
had
been
out
helping
to
hang
his
neighbors
,
and
had
done
his
*NL*
work
with
zeal
,
and
yet
was
aware
that
there
was
nothing
against
*NL*
them
but
a
mere
suspicion
,
with
nothing
back
of
it
describable
*NL*
as
evidence
,
still
neither
he
nor
his
wife
seemed
to
see
anything
*NL*
horrible
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
depressing
--
to
a
man
with
the
dream
of
a
republic
in
his
*NL*
head
.
It
reminded
me
of
a
time
thirteen
centuries
away
,
when
*NL*
the
``
poor
whites
''
of
our
South
who
were
always
despised
and
*NL*
frequently
insulted
by
the
slave-lords
around
them
,
and
who
owed
*NL*
their
base
condition
simply
to
the
presence
of
slavery
in
their
*NL*
midst
,
were
yet
pusillanimously
ready
to
side
with
the
slave-lords
*NL*
in
all
political
moves
for
the
upholding
and
perpetuating
of
*NL*
slavery
,
and
did
also
finally
shoulder
their
muskets
and
pour
out
*NL*
their
lives
in
an
effort
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
that
very
*NL*
institution
which
degraded
them
.
And
there
was
only
one
redeeming
*NL*
feature
connected
with
that
pitiful
piece
of
history
;
and
that
was
,
*NL*
that
secretly
the
``
poor
white
''
did
detest
the
slave-lord
,
and
did
*NL*
feel
his
own
shame
.
That
feeling
was
not
brought
to
the
surface
,
*NL*
but
the
fact
that
it
was
there
and
could
have
been
brought
out
,
*NL*
under
favoring
circumstances
,
was
something
--
in
fact
,
it
was
enough
;
*NL*
for
it
showed
that
a
man
is
at
bottom
a
man
,
after
all
,
even
if
it
*NL*
does
n't
show
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
as
it
turned
out
,
this
charcoal
burner
was
just
the
twin
of
*NL*
the
Southern
``
poor
white
''
of
the
far
future
.
The
king
presently
*NL*
showed
impatience
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
ye
prattle
here
all
the
day
,
justice
will
miscarry
.
Think
ye
*NL*
the
criminals
will
abide
in
their
father
's
house
?
They
are
fleeing
,
*NL*
they
are
not
waiting
.
You
should
look
to
it
that
a
party
of
horse
*NL*
be
set
upon
their
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
paled
slightly
,
but
quite
perceptibly
,
and
the
man
looked
*NL*
flustered
and
irresolute
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
friend
,
I
will
walk
a
little
way
with
you
,
and
explain
which
*NL*
direction
I
think
they
would
try
to
take
.
If
they
were
merely
*NL*
resisters
of
the
gabelle
or
some
kindred
absurdity
I
would
try
*NL*
to
protect
them
from
capture
;
but
when
men
murder
a
person
of
*NL*
high
degree
and
likewise
burn
his
house
,
that
is
another
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
remark
was
for
the
king
--
to
quiet
him
.
On
the
road
*NL*
the
man
pulled
his
resolution
together
,
and
began
the
march
with
*NL*
a
steady
gait
,
but
there
was
no
eagerness
in
it
.
By
and
by
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
relation
were
these
men
to
you
--
cousins
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
as
white
as
his
layer
of
charcoal
would
let
him
,
and
*NL*
stopped
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
God
,
how
know
ye
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
it
;
it
was
a
chance
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
lads
,
they
are
lost
.
And
good
lads
they
were
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
actually
going
yonder
to
tell
on
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
n't
quite
know
how
to
take
that
;
but
he
said
,
hesitatingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-s
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
think
you
are
a
damned
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
him
as
glad
as
if
I
had
called
him
an
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
the
good
words
again
,
brother
!
for
surely
ye
mean
that
ye
*NL*
would
not
betray
me
an
I
failed
of
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duty
?
There
is
no
duty
in
the
matter
,
except
the
duty
to
keep
*NL*
still
and
let
those
men
get
away
.
They
've
done
a
righteous
deed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
pleased
;
pleased
,
and
touched
with
apprehension
at
the
*NL*
same
time
.
He
looked
up
and
down
the
road
to
see
that
no
one
*NL*
was
coming
,
and
then
said
in
a
cautious
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
what
land
come
you
,
brother
,
that
you
speak
such
perilous
*NL*
words
,
and
seem
not
to
be
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
perilous
words
when
spoken
to
one
of
my
own
caste
,
*NL*
I
take
it
.
You
would
not
tell
anybody
I
said
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
would
be
drawn
asunder
by
wild
horses
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
me
say
my
say
.
I
have
no
fears
of
your
repeating
*NL*
it
.
I
think
devil
's
work
has
been
done
last
night
upon
those
*NL*
innocent
poor
people
.
That
old
baron
got
only
what
he
deserved
.
*NL*
If
I
had
my
way
,
all
his
kind
should
have
the
same
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fear
and
depression
vanished
from
the
man
's
manner
,
and
gratefulness
*NL*
and
a
brave
animation
took
their
place
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
though
you
be
a
spy
,
and
your
words
a
trap
for
my
undoing
,
*NL*
yet
are
they
such
refreshment
that
to
hear
them
again
and
others
*NL*
like
to
them
,
I
would
go
to
the
gallows
happy
,
as
having
had
one
*NL*
good
feast
at
least
in
a
starved
life
.
And
I
will
say
my
say
now
,
*NL*
and
ye
may
report
it
if
ye
be
so
minded
.
I
helped
to
hang
my
*NL*
neighbors
for
that
it
were
peril
to
my
own
life
to
show
lack
of
*NL*
zeal
in
the
master
's
cause
;
the
others
helped
for
none
other
reason
.
*NL*
All
rejoice
to-day
that
he
is
dead
,
but
all
do
go
about
seemingly
*NL*
sorrowing
,
and
shedding
the
hypocrite
's
tear
,
for
in
that
lies
*NL*
safety
.
I
have
said
the
words
,
I
have
said
the
words
!
the
only
*NL*
ones
that
have
ever
tasted
good
in
my
mouth
,
and
the
reward
of
*NL*
that
taste
is
sufficient
.
Lead
on
,
an
ye
will
,
be
it
even
to
the
*NL*
scaffold
,
for
I
am
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
it
was
,
you
see
.
A
man
is
a
man
,
at
bottom
.
Whole
ages
*NL*
of
abuse
and
oppression
can
not
crush
the
manhood
clear
out
of
him
.
*NL*
Whoever
thinks
it
a
mistake
is
himself
mistaken
.
Yes
,
there
is
*NL*
plenty
good
enough
material
for
a
republic
in
the
most
degraded
*NL*
people
that
ever
existed
--
even
the
Russians
;
plenty
of
manhood
*NL*
in
them
--
even
in
the
Germans
--
if
one
could
but
force
it
out
of
*NL*
its
timid
and
suspicious
privacy
,
to
overthrow
and
trample
in
the
*NL*
mud
any
throne
that
ever
was
set
up
and
any
nobility
that
ever
*NL*
supported
it
.
We
should
see
certain
things
yet
,
let
us
hope
and
*NL*
believe
.
First
,
a
modified
monarchy
,
till
Arthur
's
days
were
done
,
*NL*
then
the
destruction
of
the
throne
,
nobility
abolished
,
every
*NL*
member
of
it
bound
out
to
some
useful
trade
,
universal
suffrage
*NL*
instituted
,
and
the
whole
government
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
men
and
women
of
the
nation
there
to
remain
.
Yes
,
there
was
no
*NL*
occasion
to
give
up
my
dream
yet
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
MARCO
*NL*
*NL*
We
strolled
along
in
a
sufficiently
indolent
fashion
now
,
and
*NL*
talked
.
We
must
dispose
of
about
the
amount
of
time
it
ought
*NL*
to
take
to
go
to
the
little
hamlet
of
Abblasoure
and
put
justice
*NL*
on
the
track
of
those
murderers
and
get
back
home
again
.
And
*NL*
meantime
I
had
an
auxiliary
interest
which
had
never
paled
yet
,
*NL*
never
lost
its
novelty
for
me
since
I
had
been
in
Arthur
's
kingdom
:
*NL*
the
behavior
--
born
of
nice
and
exact
subdivisions
of
caste
--
of
chance
*NL*
passers-by
toward
each
other
.
Toward
the
shaven
monk
who
trudged
*NL*
along
with
his
cowl
tilted
back
and
the
sweat
washing
down
his
*NL*
fat
jowls
,
the
coal-burner
was
deeply
reverent
;
to
the
gentleman
*NL*
he
was
abject
;
with
the
small
farmer
and
the
free
mechanic
he
was
*NL*
cordial
and
gossipy
;
and
when
a
slave
passed
by
with
a
countenance
*NL*
respectfully
lowered
,
this
chap
's
nose
was
in
the
air
--
he
could
n't
*NL*
even
see
him
.
Well
,
there
are
times
when
one
would
like
to
hang
*NL*
the
whole
human
race
and
finish
the
farce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
we
struck
an
incident
.
A
small
mob
of
half-naked
boys
*NL*
and
girls
came
tearing
out
of
the
woods
,
scared
and
shrieking
.
*NL*
The
eldest
among
them
were
not
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
years
*NL*
old
.
They
implored
help
,
but
they
were
so
beside
themselves
that
*NL*
we
could
n't
make
out
what
the
matter
was
.
However
,
we
plunged
*NL*
into
the
wood
,
they
skurrying
in
the
lead
,
and
the
trouble
was
*NL*
quickly
revealed
:
they
had
hanged
a
little
fellow
with
a
bark
rope
,
*NL*
and
he
was
kicking
and
struggling
,
in
the
process
of
choking
to
*NL*
death
.
We
rescued
him
,
and
fetched
him
around
.
It
was
some
more
*NL*
human
nature
;
the
admiring
little
folk
imitating
their
elders
;
*NL*
they
were
playing
mob
,
and
had
achieved
a
success
which
promised
*NL*
to
be
a
good
deal
more
serious
than
they
had
bargained
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
dull
excursion
for
me
.
I
managed
to
put
in
the
time
*NL*
very
well
.
I
made
various
acquaintanceships
,
and
in
my
quality
*NL*
of
stranger
was
able
to
ask
as
many
questions
as
I
wanted
to
.
*NL*
A
thing
which
naturally
interested
me
,
as
a
statesman
,
was
the
*NL*
matter
of
wages
.
I
picked
up
what
I
could
under
that
head
during
*NL*
the
afternoon
.
A
man
who
has
n't
had
much
experience
,
and
does
n't
*NL*
think
,
is
apt
to
measure
a
nation
's
prosperity
or
lack
of
prosperity
*NL*
by
the
mere
size
of
the
prevailing
wages
;
if
the
wages
be
high
,
the
*NL*
nation
is
prosperous
;
if
low
,
it
is
n't
.
Which
is
an
error
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
what
sum
you
get
,
it
's
how
much
you
can
buy
with
it
,
that
's
*NL*
the
important
thing
;
and
it
's
that
that
tells
whether
your
wages
*NL*
are
high
in
fact
or
only
high
in
name
.
I
could
remember
how
it
*NL*
was
in
the
time
of
our
great
civil
war
in
the
nineteenth
century
.
*NL*
In
the
North
a
carpenter
got
three
dollars
a
day
,
gold
valuation
;
*NL*
in
the
South
he
got
fifty
--
payable
in
Confederate
shinplasters
*NL*
worth
a
dollar
a
bushel
.
In
the
North
a
suit
of
overalls
cost
*NL*
three
dollars
--
a
day
's
wages
;
in
the
South
it
cost
seventy-five
*NL*
--
which
was
two
days
'
wages
.
Other
things
were
in
proportion
.
*NL*
Consequently
,
wages
were
twice
as
high
in
the
North
as
they
were
*NL*
in
the
South
,
because
the
one
wage
had
that
much
more
purchasing
*NL*
power
than
the
other
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
made
various
acquaintances
in
the
hamlet
and
a
thing
that
*NL*
gratified
me
a
good
deal
was
to
find
our
new
coins
in
circulation
*NL*
--
lots
of
milrays
,
lots
of
mills
,
lots
of
cents
,
a
good
many
nickels
,
*NL*
and
some
silver
;
all
this
among
the
artisans
and
commonalty
*NL*
generally
;
yes
,
and
even
some
gold
--
but
that
was
at
the
bank
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
the
goldsmith
's
.
I
dropped
in
there
while
Marco
,
*NL*
the
son
of
Marco
,
was
haggling
with
a
shopkeeper
over
a
quarter
*NL*
of
a
pound
of
salt
,
and
asked
for
change
for
a
twenty-dollar
gold
*NL*
piece
.
They
furnished
it
--
that
is
,
after
they
had
chewed
the
piece
,
*NL*
and
rung
it
on
the
counter
,
and
tried
acid
on
it
,
and
asked
me
*NL*
where
I
got
it
,
and
who
I
was
,
and
where
I
was
from
,
and
where
*NL*
I
was
going
to
,
and
when
I
expected
to
get
there
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
a
couple
of
hundred
more
questions
;
and
when
they
got
aground
,
*NL*
I
went
right
on
and
furnished
them
a
lot
of
information
voluntarily
;
*NL*
told
them
I
owned
a
dog
,
and
his
name
was
Watch
,
and
my
first
wife
*NL*
was
a
Free
Will
Baptist
,
and
her
grandfather
was
a
Prohibitionist
,
*NL*
and
I
used
to
know
a
man
who
had
two
thumbs
on
each
hand
and
a
wart
*NL*
on
the
inside
of
his
upper
lip
,
and
died
in
the
hope
of
a
glorious
*NL*
resurrection
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
,
till
even
that
*NL*
hungry
village
questioner
began
to
look
satisfied
,
and
also
a
shade
*NL*
put
out
;
but
he
had
to
respect
a
man
of
my
financial
strength
,
*NL*
and
so
he
did
n't
give
me
any
lip
,
but
I
noticed
he
took
it
out
of
*NL*
his
underlings
,
which
was
a
perfectly
natural
thing
to
do
.
Yes
,
*NL*
they
changed
my
twenty
,
but
I
judged
it
strained
the
bank
a
little
,
*NL*
which
was
a
thing
to
be
expected
,
for
it
was
the
same
as
walking
*NL*
into
a
paltry
village
store
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
requiring
*NL*
the
boss
of
it
to
change
a
two
thousand-dollar
bill
for
you
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
.
He
could
do
it
,
maybe
;
but
at
the
same
time
he
*NL*
would
wonder
how
a
small
farmer
happened
to
be
carrying
so
much
*NL*
money
around
in
his
pocket
;
which
was
probably
this
goldsmith
's
*NL*
thought
,
too
;
for
he
followed
me
to
the
door
and
stood
there
gazing
*NL*
after
me
with
reverent
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
new
money
was
not
only
handsomely
circulating
,
but
its
language
*NL*
was
already
glibly
in
use
;
that
is
to
say
,
people
had
dropped
*NL*
the
names
of
the
former
moneys
,
and
spoke
of
things
as
being
worth
*NL*
so
many
dollars
or
cents
or
mills
or
milrays
now
.
It
was
very
*NL*
gratifying
.
We
were
progressing
,
that
was
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
to
know
several
master
mechanics
,
but
about
the
most
interesting
*NL*
fellow
among
them
was
the
blacksmith
,
Dowley
.
He
was
a
live
man
*NL*
and
a
brisk
talker
,
and
had
two
journeymen
and
three
apprentices
,
*NL*
and
was
doing
a
raging
business
.
In
fact
,
he
was
getting
rich
,
*NL*
hand
over
fist
,
and
was
vastly
respected
.
Marco
was
very
proud
of
*NL*
having
such
a
man
for
a
friend
.
He
had
taken
me
there
ostensibly
*NL*
to
let
me
see
the
big
establishment
which
bought
so
much
of
his
*NL*
charcoal
,
but
really
to
let
me
see
what
easy
and
almost
familiar
*NL*
terms
he
was
on
with
this
great
man
.
Dowley
and
I
fraternized
*NL*
at
once
;
I
had
had
just
such
picked
men
,
splendid
fellows
,
under
*NL*
me
in
the
Colt
Arms
Factory
.
I
was
bound
to
see
more
of
him
,
so
*NL*
I
invited
him
to
come
out
to
Marco
's
Sunday
,
and
dine
with
us
.
*NL*
Marco
was
appalled
,
and
held
his
breath
;
and
when
the
grandee
*NL*
accepted
,
he
was
so
grateful
that
he
almost
forgot
to
be
astonished
*NL*
at
the
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marco
's
joy
was
exuberant
--
but
only
for
a
moment
;
then
he
grew
*NL*
thoughtful
,
then
sad
;
and
when
he
heard
me
tell
Dowley
I
should
*NL*
have
Dickon
,
the
boss
mason
,
and
Smug
,
the
boss
wheelwright
,
out
*NL*
there
,
too
,
the
coal-dust
on
his
face
turned
to
chalk
,
and
he
lost
*NL*
his
grip
.
But
I
knew
what
was
the
matter
with
him
;
it
was
the
*NL*
expense
.
He
saw
ruin
before
him
;
he
judged
that
his
financial
*NL*
days
were
numbered
.
However
,
on
our
way
to
invite
the
others
,
*NL*
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
allow
me
to
have
these
friends
come
;
and
you
must
also
*NL*
allow
me
to
pay
the
costs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
cleared
,
and
he
said
with
spirit
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
all
of
it
,
not
all
of
it
.
Ye
can
not
well
bear
a
burden
*NL*
like
to
this
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped
him
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
's
understand
each
other
on
the
spot
,
old
friend
.
I
am
*NL*
only
a
farm
bailiff
,
it
is
true
;
but
I
am
not
poor
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
I
have
been
very
fortunate
this
year
--
you
would
be
astonished
*NL*
to
know
how
I
have
thriven
.
I
tell
you
the
honest
truth
when
I
say
*NL*
I
could
squander
away
as
many
as
a
dozen
feasts
like
this
and
never
*NL*
care
_
that
_
for
the
expense
!
''
and
I
snapped
my
fingers
.
I
could
*NL*
see
myself
rise
a
foot
at
a
time
in
Marco
's
estimation
,
and
when
*NL*
I
fetched
out
those
last
words
I
was
become
a
very
tower
for
style
*NL*
and
altitude
.
``
So
you
see
,
you
must
let
me
have
my
way
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
contribute
a
cent
to
this
orgy
,
that
's
_
settled
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
grand
and
good
of
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
n't
.
You
've
opened
your
house
to
Jones
and
me
in
the
*NL*
most
generous
way
;
Jones
was
remarking
upon
it
to-day
,
just
before
*NL*
you
came
back
from
the
village
;
for
although
he
would
n't
be
likely
*NL*
to
say
such
a
thing
to
you
--
because
Jones
is
n't
a
talker
,
and
is
*NL*
diffident
in
society
--
he
has
a
good
heart
and
a
grateful
,
and
*NL*
knows
how
to
appreciate
it
when
he
is
well
treated
;
yes
,
you
and
*NL*
your
wife
have
been
very
hospitable
toward
us
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
brother
,
't
is
nothing
--
_
such
_
hospitality
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
_
is
_
something
;
the
best
a
man
has
,
freely
given
,
is
always
*NL*
something
,
and
is
as
good
as
a
prince
can
do
,
and
ranks
right
*NL*
along
beside
it
--
for
even
a
prince
can
but
do
his
best
.
And
so
*NL*
we
'll
shop
around
and
get
up
this
layout
now
,
and
do
n't
you
worry
*NL*
about
the
expense
.
I
'm
one
of
the
worst
spendthrifts
that
ever
*NL*
was
born
.
Why
,
do
you
know
,
sometimes
in
a
single
week
I
spend
*NL*
--
but
never
mind
about
that
--
you
'd
never
believe
it
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
went
gadding
along
,
dropping
in
here
and
there
,
pricing
*NL*
things
,
and
gossiping
with
the
shopkeepers
about
the
riot
,
and
now
*NL*
and
then
running
across
pathetic
reminders
of
it
,
in
the
persons
of
*NL*
shunned
and
tearful
and
houseless
remnants
of
families
whose
homes
*NL*
had
been
taken
from
them
and
their
parents
butchered
or
hanged
.
*NL*
The
raiment
of
Marco
and
his
wife
was
of
coarse
tow-linen
and
*NL*
linsey-woolsey
respectively
,
and
resembled
township
maps
,
it
being
*NL*
made
up
pretty
exclusively
of
patches
which
had
been
added
,
township
*NL*
by
township
,
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
years
,
until
hardly
a
*NL*
hand
's
-
breadth
of
the
original
garments
was
surviving
and
present
.
*NL*
Now
I
wanted
to
fit
these
people
out
with
new
suits
,
on
account
of
*NL*
that
swell
company
,
and
I
did
n't
know
just
how
to
get
at
it
*NL*
--
with
delicacy
,
until
at
last
it
struck
me
that
as
I
had
already
*NL*
been
liberal
in
inventing
wordy
gratitude
for
the
king
,
it
would
*NL*
be
just
the
thing
to
back
it
up
with
evidence
of
a
substantial
*NL*
sort
;
so
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Marco
,
there
's
another
thing
which
you
must
permit
--
out
of
*NL*
kindness
for
Jones
--
because
you
would
n't
want
to
offend
him
.
*NL*
He
was
very
anxious
to
testify
his
appreciation
in
some
way
,
but
*NL*
he
is
so
diffident
he
could
n't
venture
it
himself
,
and
so
he
begged
*NL*
me
to
buy
some
little
things
and
give
them
to
you
and
Dame
Phyllis
*NL*
and
let
him
pay
for
them
without
your
ever
knowing
they
came
from
*NL*
him
--
you
know
how
a
delicate
person
feels
about
that
sort
of
thing
*NL*
--
and
so
I
said
I
would
,
and
we
would
keep
mum
.
Well
,
his
idea
*NL*
was
,
a
new
outfit
of
clothes
for
you
both
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
wastefulness
!
It
may
not
be
,
brother
,
it
may
not
be
.
*NL*
Consider
the
vastness
of
the
sum
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
the
vastness
of
the
sum
!
Try
to
keep
quiet
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
see
how
it
would
seem
;
a
body
ca
n't
get
in
a
word
edgeways
,
*NL*
you
talk
so
much
.
You
ought
to
cure
that
,
Marco
;
it
is
n't
good
*NL*
form
,
you
know
,
and
it
will
grow
on
you
if
you
do
n't
check
it
.
*NL*
Yes
,
we
'll
step
in
here
now
and
price
this
man
's
stuff
--
and
do
n't
*NL*
forget
to
remember
to
not
let
on
to
Jones
that
you
know
he
had
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
it
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
curiously
sensitive
*NL*
and
proud
he
is
.
He
's
a
farmer
--
pretty
fairly
well-to-do
farmer
*NL*
--
and
I
'm
his
bailiff
;
_
but
_
--
the
imagination
of
that
man
!
Why
,
*NL*
sometimes
when
he
forgets
himself
and
gets
to
blowing
off
,
you
'd
*NL*
think
he
was
one
of
the
swells
of
the
earth
;
and
you
might
listen
*NL*
to
him
a
hundred
years
and
never
take
him
for
a
farmer
--
especially
if
*NL*
he
talked
agriculture
.
He
_
thinks
_
he
's
a
Sheol
of
a
farmer
;
thinks
*NL*
he
's
old
Grayback
from
Wayback
;
but
between
you
and
me
privately
*NL*
he
do
n't
know
as
much
about
farming
as
he
does
about
running
*NL*
a
kingdom
--
still
,
whatever
he
talks
about
,
you
want
to
drop
your
*NL*
underjaw
and
listen
,
the
same
as
if
you
had
never
heard
such
*NL*
incredible
wisdom
in
all
your
life
before
,
and
were
afraid
you
*NL*
might
die
before
you
got
enough
of
it
.
That
will
please
Jones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
tickled
Marco
to
the
marrow
to
hear
about
such
an
odd
character
;
*NL*
but
it
also
prepared
him
for
accidents
;
and
in
my
experience
when
*NL*
you
travel
with
a
king
who
is
letting
on
to
be
something
else
and
*NL*
ca
n't
remember
it
more
than
about
half
the
time
,
you
ca
n't
take
*NL*
too
many
precautions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
best
store
we
had
come
across
yet
;
it
had
everything
*NL*
in
it
,
in
small
quantities
,
from
anvils
and
drygoods
all
the
way
*NL*
down
to
fish
and
pinchbeck
jewelry
.
I
concluded
I
would
bunch
*NL*
my
whole
invoice
right
here
,
and
not
go
pricing
around
any
more
.
*NL*
So
I
got
rid
of
Marco
,
by
sending
him
off
to
invite
the
mason
and
*NL*
the
wheelwright
,
which
left
the
field
free
to
me
.
For
I
never
care
*NL*
to
do
a
thing
in
a
quiet
way
;
it
's
got
to
be
theatrical
or
I
do
n't
*NL*
take
any
interest
in
it
.
I
showed
up
money
enough
,
in
a
careless
*NL*
way
,
to
corral
the
shopkeeper
's
respect
,
and
then
I
wrote
down
*NL*
a
list
of
the
things
I
wanted
,
and
handed
it
to
him
to
see
if
he
*NL*
could
read
it
.
He
could
,
and
was
proud
to
show
that
he
could
.
*NL*
He
said
he
had
been
educated
by
a
priest
,
and
could
both
read
*NL*
and
write
.
He
ran
it
through
,
and
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
*NL*
it
was
a
pretty
heavy
bill
.
Well
,
and
so
it
was
,
for
a
little
*NL*
concern
like
that
.
I
was
not
only
providing
a
swell
dinner
,
but
*NL*
some
odds
and
ends
of
extras
.
I
ordered
that
the
things
be
carted
*NL*
out
and
delivered
at
the
dwelling
of
Marco
,
the
son
of
Marco
,
*NL*
by
Saturday
evening
,
and
send
me
the
bill
at
dinner-time
Sunday
.
*NL*
He
said
I
could
depend
upon
his
promptness
and
exactitude
,
it
was
*NL*
the
rule
of
the
house
.
He
also
observed
that
he
would
throw
in
*NL*
a
couple
of
miller-guns
for
the
Marcos
gratis
--
that
everybody
*NL*
was
using
them
now
.
He
had
a
mighty
opinion
of
that
clever
*NL*
device
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
please
fill
them
up
to
the
middle
mark
,
too
;
and
add
that
*NL*
to
the
bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
,
with
pleasure
.
He
filled
them
,
and
I
took
them
with
*NL*
me
.
I
could
n't
venture
to
tell
him
that
the
miller-gun
was
a
*NL*
little
invention
of
my
own
,
and
that
I
had
officially
ordered
that
*NL*
every
shopkeeper
in
the
kingdom
keep
them
on
hand
and
sell
them
*NL*
at
government
price
--
which
was
the
merest
trifle
,
and
the
shopkeeper
*NL*
got
that
,
not
the
government
.
We
furnished
them
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
had
hardly
missed
us
when
we
got
back
at
nightfall
.
He
*NL*
had
early
dropped
again
into
his
dream
of
a
grand
invasion
of
Gaul
*NL*
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
kingdom
at
his
back
,
and
the
afternoon
*NL*
had
slipped
away
without
his
ever
coming
to
himself
again
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
DOWLEY
'S
HUMILIATION
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
when
that
cargo
arrived
toward
sunset
,
Saturday
afternoon
,
*NL*
I
had
my
hands
full
to
keep
the
Marcos
from
fainting
.
They
were
*NL*
sure
Jones
and
I
were
ruined
past
help
,
and
they
blamed
themselves
*NL*
as
accessories
to
this
bankruptcy
.
You
see
,
in
addition
to
the
*NL*
dinner-materials
,
which
called
for
a
sufficiently
round
sum
,
*NL*
I
had
bought
a
lot
of
extras
for
the
future
comfort
of
the
family
:
*NL*
for
instance
,
a
big
lot
of
wheat
,
a
delicacy
as
rare
to
the
tables
*NL*
of
their
class
as
was
ice-cream
to
a
hermit
's
;
also
a
sizeable
*NL*
deal
dinner-table
;
also
two
entire
pounds
of
salt
,
which
was
*NL*
another
piece
of
extravagance
in
those
people
's
eyes
;
also
crockery
,
*NL*
stools
,
the
clothes
,
a
small
cask
of
beer
,
and
so
on
.
I
instructed
*NL*
the
Marcos
to
keep
quiet
about
this
sumptuousness
,
so
as
to
give
*NL*
me
a
chance
to
surprise
the
guests
and
show
off
a
little
.
Concerning
*NL*
the
new
clothes
,
the
simple
couple
were
like
children
;
they
were
up
*NL*
and
down
,
all
night
,
to
see
if
it
was
n't
nearly
daylight
,
so
that
*NL*
they
could
put
them
on
,
and
they
were
into
them
at
last
as
much
*NL*
as
an
hour
before
dawn
was
due
.
Then
their
pleasure
--
not
to
say
*NL*
delirium
--
was
so
fresh
and
novel
and
inspiring
that
the
sight
of
it
*NL*
paid
me
well
for
the
interruptions
which
my
sleep
had
suffered
.
*NL*
The
king
had
slept
just
as
usual
--
like
the
dead
.
The
Marcos
could
*NL*
not
thank
him
for
their
clothes
,
that
being
forbidden
;
but
they
*NL*
tried
every
way
they
could
think
of
to
make
him
see
how
grateful
*NL*
they
were
.
Which
all
went
for
nothing
:
he
did
n't
notice
any
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
turned
out
to
be
one
of
those
rich
and
rare
fall
days
which
is
*NL*
just
a
June
day
toned
down
to
a
degree
where
it
is
heaven
to
be
*NL*
out
of
doors
.
Toward
noon
the
guests
arrived
,
and
we
assembled
*NL*
under
a
great
tree
and
were
soon
as
sociable
as
old
acquaintances
.
*NL*
Even
the
king
's
reserve
melted
a
little
,
though
it
was
some
little
*NL*
trouble
to
him
to
adjust
himself
to
the
name
of
Jones
along
at
*NL*
first
.
I
had
asked
him
to
try
to
not
forget
that
he
was
a
farmer
;
*NL*
but
I
had
also
considered
it
prudent
to
ask
him
to
let
the
thing
*NL*
stand
at
that
,
and
not
elaborate
it
any
.
Because
he
was
just
the
*NL*
kind
of
person
you
could
depend
on
to
spoil
a
little
thing
like
*NL*
that
if
you
did
n't
warn
him
,
his
tongue
was
so
handy
,
and
his
*NL*
spirit
so
willing
,
and
his
information
so
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dowley
was
in
fine
feather
,
and
I
early
got
him
started
,
and
then
*NL*
adroitly
worked
him
around
onto
his
own
history
for
a
text
and
*NL*
himself
for
a
hero
,
and
then
it
was
good
to
sit
there
and
hear
him
*NL*
hum
.
Self-made
man
,
you
know
.
They
know
how
to
talk
.
They
do
*NL*
deserve
more
credit
than
any
other
breed
of
men
,
yes
,
that
is
true
;
*NL*
and
they
are
among
the
very
first
to
find
it
out
,
too
.
He
told
how
*NL*
he
had
begun
life
an
orphan
lad
without
money
and
without
friends
*NL*
able
to
help
him
;
how
he
had
lived
as
the
slaves
of
the
meanest
*NL*
master
lived
;
how
his
day
's
work
was
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
hours
*NL*
long
,
and
yielded
him
only
enough
black
bread
to
keep
him
in
a
*NL*
half-fed
condition
;
how
his
faithful
endeavors
finally
attracted
*NL*
the
attention
of
a
good
blacksmith
,
who
came
near
knocking
him
*NL*
dead
with
kindness
by
suddenly
offering
,
when
he
was
totally
*NL*
unprepared
,
to
take
him
as
his
bound
apprentice
for
nine
years
*NL*
and
give
him
board
and
clothes
and
teach
him
the
trade
--
or
``
mystery
''
*NL*
as
Dowley
called
it
.
That
was
his
first
great
rise
,
his
first
*NL*
gorgeous
stroke
of
fortune
;
and
you
saw
that
he
could
n't
yet
speak
*NL*
of
it
without
a
sort
of
eloquent
wonder
and
delight
that
such
a
*NL*
gilded
promotion
should
have
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
common
human
*NL*
being
.
He
got
no
new
clothing
during
his
apprenticeship
,
but
on
*NL*
his
graduation
day
his
master
tricked
him
out
in
spang-new
tow-linens
*NL*
and
made
him
feel
unspeakably
rich
and
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
me
of
that
day
!
''
the
wheelwright
sang
out
,
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
likewise
!
''
cried
the
mason
.
``
I
would
not
believe
they
*NL*
were
thine
own
;
in
faith
I
could
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
other
!
''
shouted
Dowley
,
with
sparkling
eyes
.
``
I
was
like
*NL*
to
lose
my
character
,
the
neighbors
wending
I
had
mayhap
been
*NL*
stealing
.
It
was
a
great
day
,
a
great
day
;
one
forgetteth
not
*NL*
days
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
and
his
master
was
a
fine
man
,
and
prosperous
,
and
always
*NL*
had
a
great
feast
of
meat
twice
in
the
year
,
and
with
it
white
*NL*
bread
,
true
wheaten
bread
;
in
fact
,
lived
like
a
lord
,
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
And
in
time
Dowley
succeeded
to
the
business
and
married
the
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
consider
what
is
come
to
pass
,
''
said
he
,
impressively
.
*NL*
``
Two
times
in
every
month
there
is
fresh
meat
upon
my
table
.
''
*NL*
He
made
a
pause
here
,
to
let
that
fact
sink
home
,
then
added
*NL*
--
``
and
eight
times
salt
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
even
true
,
''
said
the
wheelwright
,
with
bated
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
of
mine
own
knowledge
,
''
said
the
mason
,
in
the
same
*NL*
reverent
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
table
appeareth
white
bread
every
Sunday
in
the
year
,
''
*NL*
added
the
master
smith
,
with
solemnity
.
``
I
leave
it
to
your
own
*NL*
consciences
,
friends
,
if
this
is
not
also
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
head
,
yes
,
''
cried
the
mason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
testify
it
--
and
I
do
,
''
said
the
wheelwright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
to
furniture
,
ye
shall
say
yourselves
what
mine
equipment
*NL*
is
.
''
He
waved
his
hand
in
fine
gesture
of
granting
frank
and
*NL*
unhampered
freedom
of
speech
,
and
added
:
``
Speak
as
ye
are
moved
;
*NL*
speak
as
ye
would
speak
;
an
I
were
not
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
five
stools
,
and
of
the
sweetest
workmanship
at
that
,
albeit
*NL*
your
family
is
but
three
,
''
said
the
wheelwright
,
with
deep
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
six
wooden
goblets
,
and
six
platters
of
wood
and
two
of
pewter
*NL*
to
eat
and
drink
from
withal
,
''
said
the
mason
,
impressively
.
``
And
*NL*
I
say
it
as
knowing
God
is
my
judge
,
and
we
tarry
not
here
alway
,
*NL*
but
must
answer
at
the
last
day
for
the
things
said
in
the
body
,
*NL*
be
they
false
or
be
they
sooth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
ye
know
what
manner
of
man
I
am
,
brother
Jones
,
''
said
the
*NL*
smith
,
with
a
fine
and
friendly
condescension
,
``
and
doubtless
ye
*NL*
would
look
to
find
me
a
man
jealous
of
his
due
of
respect
and
*NL*
but
sparing
of
outgo
to
strangers
till
their
rating
and
quality
be
*NL*
assured
,
but
trouble
yourself
not
,
as
concerning
that
;
wit
ye
well
*NL*
ye
shall
find
me
a
man
that
regardeth
not
these
matters
but
is
*NL*
willing
to
receive
any
he
as
his
fellow
and
equal
that
carrieth
*NL*
a
right
heart
in
his
body
,
be
his
worldly
estate
howsoever
modest
.
*NL*
And
in
token
of
it
,
here
is
my
hand
;
and
I
say
with
my
own
mouth
*NL*
we
are
equals
--
equals
''
--
and
he
smiled
around
on
the
company
with
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
a
god
who
is
doing
the
handsome
and
gracious
*NL*
thing
and
is
quite
well
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
took
the
hand
with
a
poorly
disguised
reluctance
,
and
*NL*
let
go
of
it
as
willingly
as
a
lady
lets
go
of
a
fish
;
all
of
which
*NL*
had
a
good
effect
,
for
it
was
mistaken
for
an
embarrassment
natural
*NL*
to
one
who
was
being
called
upon
by
greatness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dame
brought
out
the
table
now
,
and
set
it
under
the
tree
.
*NL*
It
caused
a
visible
stir
of
surprise
,
it
being
brand
new
and
a
*NL*
sumptuous
article
of
deal
.
But
the
surprise
rose
higher
still
*NL*
when
the
dame
,
with
a
body
oozing
easy
indifference
at
every
pore
,
*NL*
but
eyes
that
gave
it
all
away
by
absolutely
flaming
with
vanity
,
*NL*
slowly
unfolded
an
actual
simon-pure
tablecloth
and
spread
it
.
*NL*
That
was
a
notch
above
even
the
blacksmith
's
domestic
grandeurs
,
*NL*
and
it
hit
him
hard
;
you
could
see
it
.
But
Marco
was
in
Paradise
;
*NL*
you
could
see
that
,
too
.
Then
the
dame
brought
two
fine
new
*NL*
stools
--
whew
!
that
was
a
sensation
;
it
was
visible
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
every
guest
.
Then
she
brought
two
more
--
as
calmly
as
she
could
.
*NL*
Sensation
again
--
with
awed
murmurs
.
Again
she
brought
two
*NL*
--
walking
on
air
,
she
was
so
proud
.
The
guests
were
petrified
,
and
*NL*
the
mason
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
that
about
earthly
pomps
which
doth
ever
move
to
reverence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
dame
turned
away
,
Marco
could
n't
help
slapping
on
the
climax
*NL*
while
the
thing
was
hot
;
so
he
said
with
what
was
meant
for
a
*NL*
languid
composure
but
was
a
poor
imitation
of
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
suffice
;
leave
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
were
more
yet
!
It
was
a
fine
effect
.
I
could
n't
have
*NL*
played
the
hand
better
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
out
,
the
madam
piled
up
the
surprises
with
a
rush
that
*NL*
fired
the
general
astonishment
up
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
*NL*
shade
,
and
at
the
same
time
paralyzed
expression
of
it
down
to
*NL*
gasped
``
Oh
's
''
and
``
Ah
's
,
''
and
mute
upliftings
of
hands
and
eyes
.
*NL*
She
fetched
crockery
--
new
,
and
plenty
of
it
;
new
wooden
goblets
*NL*
and
other
table
furniture
;
and
beer
,
fish
,
chicken
,
a
goose
,
eggs
,
*NL*
roast
beef
,
roast
mutton
,
a
ham
,
a
small
roast
pig
,
and
a
wealth
*NL*
of
genuine
white
wheaten
bread
.
Take
it
by
and
large
,
that
spread
*NL*
laid
everything
far
and
away
in
the
shade
that
ever
that
crowd
had
*NL*
seen
before
.
And
while
they
sat
there
just
simply
stupefied
with
*NL*
wonder
and
awe
,
I
sort
of
waved
my
hand
as
if
by
accident
,
and
*NL*
the
storekeeper
's
son
emerged
from
space
and
said
he
had
come
*NL*
to
collect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
I
said
,
indifferently
.
``
What
is
the
amount
?
*NL*
give
us
the
items
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
read
off
this
bill
,
while
those
three
amazed
men
listened
,
*NL*
and
serene
waves
of
satisfaction
rolled
over
my
soul
and
alternate
*NL*
waves
of
terror
and
admiration
surged
over

He
ceased
.
There
was
a
pale
and
awful
silence
.
Not
a
limb
stirred
.
*NL*
Not
a
nostril
betrayed
the
passage
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
I
asked
,
in
a
voice
of
the
most
perfect
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
,
fair
sir
,
save
that
certain
matters
of
light
moment
are
*NL*
placed
together
under
a
head
hight
sundries
.
If
it
would
like
*NL*
you
,
I
will
sepa
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
consequence
,
''
I
said
,
accompanying
the
words
with
*NL*
a
gesture
of
the
most
utter
indifference
;
``
give
me
the
grand
*NL*
total
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
leaned
against
the
tree
to
stay
himself
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-nine
thousand
one
hundred
and
fifty
milrays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wheelwright
fell
off
his
stool
,
the
others
grabbed
the
table
*NL*
to
save
themselves
,
and
there
was
a
deep
and
general
ejaculation
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
be
with
us
in
the
day
of
disaster
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
hastened
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
chargeth
me
to
say
he
can
not
honorably
require
you
*NL*
to
pay
it
all
at
this
time
,
and
therefore
only
prayeth
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
paid
no
more
heed
than
if
it
were
the
idle
breeze
,
but
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
indifference
amounting
almost
to
weariness
,
got
out
my
money
*NL*
and
tossed
four
dollars
on
to
the
table
.
Ah
,
you
should
have
seen
*NL*
them
stare
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
was
astonished
and
charmed
.
He
asked
me
to
retain
*NL*
one
of
the
dollars
as
security
,
until
he
could
go
to
town
and
*NL*
--
I
interrupted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
and
fetch
back
nine
cents
?
Nonsense
!
Take
the
whole
.
*NL*
Keep
the
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
amazed
murmur
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
this
being
is
_
made
_
of
money
!
He
throweth
it
away
even
*NL*
as
if
it
were
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blacksmith
was
a
crushed
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
took
his
money
and
reeled
away
drunk
with
fortune
.
I
said
*NL*
to
Marco
and
his
wife
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
folk
,
here
is
a
little
trifle
for
you
''
--
handing
the
miller-guns
*NL*
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
,
though
each
of
them
*NL*
contained
fifteen
cents
in
solid
cash
;
and
while
the
poor
creatures
*NL*
went
to
pieces
with
astonishment
and
gratitude
,
I
turned
to
the
*NL*
others
and
said
as
calmly
as
one
would
ask
the
time
of
day
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
we
are
all
ready
,
I
judge
the
dinner
is
.
Come
,
fall
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
well
,
it
was
immense
;
yes
,
it
was
a
daisy
.
I
do
n't
know
that
*NL*
I
ever
put
a
situation
together
better
,
or
got
happier
spectacular
*NL*
effects
out
of
the
materials
available
.
The
blacksmith
--
well
,
he
*NL*
was
simply
mashed
.
Land
!
I
would
n't
have
felt
what
that
man
was
*NL*
feeling
,
for
anything
in
the
world
.
Here
he
had
been
blowing
and
*NL*
bragging
about
his
grand
meat-feast
twice
a
year
,
and
his
fresh
*NL*
meat
twice
a
month
,
and
his
salt
meat
twice
a
week
,
and
his
white
*NL*
bread
every
Sunday
the
year
round
--
all
for
a
family
of
three
;
the
*NL*
entire
cost
for
the
year
not
above
69.2.6
-LRB-
sixty-nine
cents
,
two
*NL*
mills
and
six
milrays
-RRB-
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
here
comes
along
a
man
*NL*
who
slashes
out
nearly
four
dollars
on
a
single
blow-out
;
and
not
*NL*
only
that
,
but
acts
as
if
it
made
him
tired
to
handle
such
small
*NL*
sums
.
Yes
,
Dowley
was
a
good
deal
wilted
,
and
shrunk-up
and
*NL*
collapsed
;
he
had
the
aspect
of
a
bladder-balloon
that
's
been
*NL*
stepped
on
by
a
cow
.

However
,
I
made
a
dead
set
at
him
,
and
before
the
first
third
*NL*
of
the
dinner
was
reached
,
I
had
him
happy
again
.
It
was
easy
*NL*
to
do
--
in
a
country
of
ranks
and
castes
.
You
see
,
in
a
country
*NL*
where
they
have
ranks
and
castes
,
a
man
is
n't
ever
a
man
,
he
is
*NL*
only
part
of
a
man
,
he
ca
n't
ever
get
his
full
growth
.
You
prove
*NL*
your
superiority
over
him
in
station
,
or
rank
,
or
fortune
,
and
*NL*
that
's
the
end
of
it
--
he
knuckles
down
.
You
ca
n't
insult
him
*NL*
after
that
.
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
quite
that
;
of
course
you
_
can
_
insult
*NL*
him
,
I
only
mean
it
's
difficult
;
and
so
,
unless
you
've
got
a
lot
*NL*
of
useless
time
on
your
hands
it
does
n't
pay
to
try
.
I
had
the
*NL*
smith
's
reverence
now
,
because
I
was
apparently
immensely
prosperous
*NL*
and
rich
;
I
could
have
had
his
adoration
if
I
had
had
some
little
*NL*
gimcrack
title
of
nobility
.
And
not
only
his
,
but
any
commoner
's
*NL*
in
the
land
,
though
he
were
the
mightiest
production
of
all
the
ages
,
*NL*
in
intellect
,
worth
,
and
character
,
and
I
bankrupt
in
all
three
.
*NL*
This
was
to
remain
so
,
as
long
as
England
should
exist
in
the
*NL*
earth
.
With
the
spirit
of
prophecy
upon
me
,
I
could
look
into
*NL*
the
future
and
see
her
erect
statues
and
monuments
to
her
unspeakable
*NL*
Georges
and
other
royal
and
noble
clothes-horses
,
and
leave
unhonored
*NL*
the
creators
of
this
world
--
after
God
--
Gutenburg
,
Watt
,
Arkwright
,
*NL*
Whitney
,
Morse
,
Stephenson
,
Bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
got
his
cargo
aboard
,
and
then
,
the
talk
not
turning
upon
*NL*
battle
,
conquest
,
or
iron-clad
duel
,
he
dulled
down
to
drowsiness
*NL*
and
went
off
to
take
a
nap
.
Mrs.
Marco
cleared
the
table
,
placed
*NL*
the
beer
keg
handy
,
and
went
away
to
eat
her
dinner
of
leavings
*NL*
in
humble
privacy
,
and
the
rest
of
us
soon
drifted
into
matters
*NL*
near
and
dear
to
the
hearts
of
our
sort
--
business
and
wages
,
*NL*
of
course
.
At
a
first
glance
,
things
appeared
to
be
exceeding
*NL*
prosperous
in
this
little
tributary
kingdom
--
whose
lord
was
*NL*
King
Bagdemagus
--
as
compared
with
the
state
of
things
in
my
own
*NL*
region
.
They
had
the
``
protection
''
system
in
full
force
here
,
*NL*
whereas
we
were
working
along
down
toward
free-trade
,
by
easy
*NL*
stages
,
and
were
now
about
half
way
.
Before
long
,
Dowley
and
I
*NL*
were
doing
all
the
talking
,
the
others
hungrily
listening
.
Dowley
*NL*
warmed
to
his
work
,
snuffed
an
advantage
in
the
air
,
and
began
*NL*
to
put
questions
which
he
considered
pretty
awkward
ones
for
me
,
*NL*
and
they
did
have
something
of
that
look
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
your
country
,
brother
,
what
is
the
wage
of
a
master
bailiff
,
*NL*
master
hind
,
carter
,
shepherd
,
swineherd
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
milrays
a
day
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
quarter
of
a
cent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smith
's
face
beamed
with
joy
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
us
they
are
allowed
the
double
of
it
!
And
what
may
a
mechanic
*NL*
get
--
carpenter
,
dauber
,
mason
,
painter
,
blacksmith
,
wheelwright
,
*NL*
and
the
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
average
,
fifty
milrays

half
a
cent
a
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho-ho
!
With
us
they
are
allowed
a
hundred

With
us
any
good
*NL*

a
day

I
count
out
the
tailor
,
but
*NL*
not
the
others
--
they
are
all
allowed
a
cent
a
day
,
and
in
driving
*NL*
times
they
get
more
--
yes
,
up
to
a
hundred
and
ten
and
even
fifteen
*NL*
milrays
a
day
.
I
've
paid
a
hundred
and
fifteen
myself
,
within
*NL*
the
week
.
`
Rah
for
protection
--
to
Sheol
with
free-trade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
face
shone
upon
the
company
like
a
sunburst
.
But
I
did
n't
*NL*
scare
at
all
.
I
rigged
up
my
pile-driver
,
and
allowed
myself
*NL*
fifteen
minutes
to
drive
him
into
the
earth
--
drive
him
_
all
_
in
*NL*
--
drive
him
in
till
not
even
the
curve
of
his
skull
should
show
*NL*
above
ground
.
Here
is
the
way
I
started
in
on
him
.
I
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
pay
a
pound
for
salt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``

when

That
was
a
neat
hit
;
it
made
the
color
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
varieth
somewhat
,
but
not
much
;
one
may
say
seventy-five

*NL*
*NL*

_
We

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
costeth
us
eight
and
one-half
milrays
the
pint

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
get
it
for
four

twenty-five
bottles
for
a

*NL*
What
do
you
pay

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
rate
of
nine
hundred
milrays
the
bushel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
pay

What
do
you

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
observe
the
difference
:
you
pay
eight
cents
and
four
mills
,
*NL*
we
pay
only
four

''
I
prepared
now
to
sock
it
to
him
.
I
said
:
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
dear
friend
,
_
what
's
become
of
your
high
wages
you
*NL*
were
bragging
so
about
a
few
minutes
ago
?
_
''
--
and
I
looked
around
*NL*
on
the
company
with
placid
satisfaction
,
for
I
had
slipped
up
*NL*
on
him
gradually
and
tied
him
hand
and
foot
,
you
see
,
without
his
*NL*
ever
noticing
that
he
was
being
tied
at
all
.
``
What
's
become
of
*NL*
those
noble
high
wages
of
yours
?
--
I
seem
to
have
knocked
the
*NL*
stuffing
all
out
of
them
,
it
appears
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
you
will
believe
me
,
he
merely
looked
surprised
,
that
*NL*
is
all
!
he
did
n't
grasp
the
situation
at
all
,
did
n't
know
he
had
*NL*
walked
into
a
trap
,
did
n't
discover
that
he
was
_
in
_
a
trap
.
I
could
*NL*
have
shot
him
,
from
sheer
vexation
.
With
cloudy
eye
and
a
struggling
*NL*
intellect
he
fetched
this
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
I
seem
not
to
understand
.
It
is
_
proved
_
that
our
wages
*NL*
be
double
thine
;
how
then
may
it
be
that
thou
`
st
knocked
therefrom
*NL*
the
stuffing
?
--
an
miscall
not
the
wonderly
word
,
this
being
the
*NL*
first
time
under
grace
and
providence
of
God
it
hath
been
granted
*NL*
me
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
stunned
;
partly
with
this
unlooked-for
stupidity
on
*NL*
his
part
,
and
partly
because
his
fellows
so
manifestly
sided
with
*NL*
him
and
were
of
his
mind
--
if
you
might
call
it
mind
.
My
position
*NL*
was
simple
enough
,
plain
enough
;
how
could
it
ever
be
simplified
*NL*
more
?
However
,
I
must
try
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
look
here
,
brother
Dowley
,
do
n't
you
see
?
Your
wages
are
*NL*
merely
higher
than
ours
in
_
name
_
,
not
in
_
fact
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
him
!
They
are
the
_
double
_
--
ye
have
confessed
it
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes-yes
,
I
do
n't
deny
that
at
all
.
But
that
's
got
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
it
;
the
_
amount
_
of
the
wages
in
mere
coins
,
with
meaningless
*NL*
names
attached
to
them
to
know
them
by
,
has
got
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
it
.
The
thing
is
,
how
much
can
you
_
buy
_
with
your
wages
?
*NL*
--
that
's
the
idea
.
While
it
is
true
that
with
you
a
good
mechanic
*NL*
is
allowed
about
three
dollars
and
a
half
a
year
,
and
with
us
only
*NL*
about
a
dollar
and
seventy-five
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
ye
're
confessing
it
again
,
ye
're
confessing
it
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confound
it
,
I
've
never
denied
it
,
I
tell
you
!
What
I
say
is
*NL*
this
.
With
us
_
half
_
a
dollar
buys
more
than
a
_
dollar
_
buys
*NL*
with
you
--
and
THEREFORE
it
stands
to
reason
and
the
commonest
*NL*
kind
of
common-sense
,
that
our
wages
are
_
higher
_
than
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
dazed
,
and
said
,
despairingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Verily
,
I
can
not
make
it
out
.
Ye
've
just
said
ours
are
the
*NL*
higher
,
and
with
the
same
breath
ye
take
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
great
Scott
,
is
n't
it
possible
to
get
such
a
simple
thing
*NL*
through
your
head
?
Now
look
here
--
let
me
illustrate
.
We
pay
*NL*
four
cents
for
a
woman
's
stuff
gown
,
you
pay
8.4.0
,
which
is
*NL*
four
mills
more
than
_
double
_
.
What
do
you
allow
a
laboring
*NL*
woman
who
works
on
a
farm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
mills
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
we
allow
but
half
as
much
;
we
pay
her
only
a
tenth
*NL*
of
a

a
day
;
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
ye
're
conf

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
Now
,
you
see
,
the
thing
is
very
simple
;
this
time
you
'll
*NL*
understand
it
.
For
instance
,
it
takes
your
woman
42
days
to
earn
*NL*
her
gown
,
at
2
mills
a
day
--
7
weeks

work

but
ours
earns
hers
*NL*
in
forty
days

two
days
_
short
_
of
7
weeks

Your
woman
has
a
gown
,
*NL*
and
her
whole
seven
weeks
wages
are
gone

ours
has
a
gown

and
*NL*
two
days

wages
left

to
buy
something
else
with

There

_
now
_
*NL*
you
understand
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
--
well
,
he
merely
looked
dubious
,
it
's
the
most
I
can
say
;
*NL*
so
did
the
others
.
I
waited
--
to
let
the
thing
work
.
Dowley
spoke
*NL*
at
last
--
and
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
actually
had
n't
gotten
away
*NL*
from
his
rooted
and
grounded
superstitions
yet
.
He
said
,
with
*NL*
a
trifle
of
hesitancy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
--
ye
can
not
fail
to
grant
that
two
mills
a
day
is
better
*NL*
than
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
Shucks
!
Well
,
of
course
,
I
hated
to
give
it
up
.
So
I
chanced
*NL*
another
flyer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
suppose
a
case
.
Suppose
one
of
your
journeymen
goes
out
*NL*
and
buys
the
following
articles
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
1
pound
of
salt
;
*NL*
1
dozen
eggs
;
*NL*
1
dozen
pints
of
beer
;
*NL*
1
bushel
of
wheat
;
*NL*
1
tow-linen
suit
;
*NL*
5
pounds
of
beef
;
*NL*
5
pounds
of
mutton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lot
will
cost
him
32
cents
.
It
takes
him
32
working
days
*NL*
to
earn
the
money
--
5
weeks
and
2
days
.
Let
him
come
to
us
and
*NL*
work
32
days
at
_
half
_
the
wages
;
he
can
buy
all
those
things
for
*NL*
a
shade
under
14 1/2
cents
;
they
will
cost
him
a
shade
under
29
*NL*
days

work
,
and
he
will
have
about
half
a
week
's
wages
over

Carry
*NL*
it
through
the
year
;
he
would
save
nearly
a
week
's
wages
every
*NL*
two
months

_
your
_

nothing
;
thus
saving
five
or
six
weeks
'
wages
*NL*
in
a
year
,
your
man
not
a
cent
.
_
Now
_
I
reckon
you
understand
that
*NL*
`
high
wages
'
and
`
low
wages
'
are
phrases
that
do
n't
mean
anything
*NL*
in
the
world
until
you
find
out
which
of
them
will
_
buy
_
the
most
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
crusher
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
alas
!
it
did
n't
crush
.
No
,
I
had
to
give
it
up
.
What
those
*NL*
people
valued
was
_
high
wages
_
;
it
did
n't
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
*NL*
any
consequence
to
them
whether
the
high
wages
would
buy
anything
*NL*
or
not
.
They
stood
for
``
protection
,
''
and
swore
by
it
,
which
was
*NL*
reasonable
enough
,
because
interested
parties
had
gulled
them
into
*NL*
the
notion
that
it
was
protection
which
had
created
their
high
*NL*
wages
.
I
proved
to
them
that
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
their
wages
*NL*
had
advanced
but
30
per
cent.
,
while
the
cost
of
living
had
gone
*NL*
up
100
;
and
that
with
us
,
in
a
shorter
time
,
wages
had
advanced
*NL*
40
per
cent
.
while
the
cost
of
living
had
gone
steadily
down
.
But
*NL*
it
did
n't
do
any
good
.
Nothing
could
unseat
their
strange
beliefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
was
smarting
under
a
sense
of
defeat
.
Undeserved
defeat
,
*NL*
but
what
of
that
?
That
did
n't
soften
the
smart
any
.
And
to
think
*NL*
of
the
circumstances
!
the
first
statesman
of
the
age
,
the
capablest
*NL*
man
,
the
best-informed
man
in
the
entire
world
,
the
loftiest
*NL*
uncrowned
head
that
had
moved
through
the
clouds
of
any
political
*NL*
firmament
for
centuries
,
sitting
here
apparently
defeated
in
*NL*
argument
by
an
ignorant
country
blacksmith
!
And
I
could
see
that
*NL*
those
others
were
sorry
for
me
--
which
made
me
blush
till
I
could
*NL*
smell
my
whiskers
scorching
.
Put
yourself
in
my
place
;
feel
as
mean
*NL*
as
I
did
,
as
ashamed
as
I
felt
--
would
n't
_
you
_
have
struck
below
the
*NL*
belt
to
get
even
?
Yes
,
you
would
;
it
is
simply
human
nature
.
*NL*
Well
,
that
is
what
I
did
.
I
am
not
trying
to
justify
it
;
I
'm
only
*NL*
saying
that
I
was
mad
,
and
_
anybody
_
would
have
done
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
when
I
make
up
my
mind
to
hit
a
man
,
I
do
n't
plan
out
*NL*
a
love-tap
;
no
,
that
is
n't
my
way
;
as
long
as
I
'm
going
to
hit
him
*NL*
at
all
,
I
'm
going
to
hit
him
a
lifter
.
And
I
do
n't
jump
at
him
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
risk
making
a
blundering
half-way
business
*NL*
of
it
;
no
,
I
get
away
off
yonder
to
one
side
,
and
work
up
on
him
*NL*
gradually
,
so
that
he
never
suspects
that
I
'm
going
to
hit
him
*NL*
at
all
;
and
by
and
by
,
all
in
a
flash
,
he
's
flat
on
his
back
,
and
*NL*
he
ca
n't
tell
for
the
life
of
him
how
it
all
happened
.
That
is
*NL*
the
way
I
went
for
brother
Dowley
.
I
started
to
talking
lazy
and
*NL*
comfortable
,
as
if
I
was
just
talking
to
pass
the
time
;
and
the
*NL*
oldest
man
in
the
world
could
n't
have
taken
the
bearings
of
my
*NL*
starting
place
and
guessed
where
I
was
going
to
fetch
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
there
's
a
good
many
curious
things
about
law
,
and
custom
,
*NL*
and
usage
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
;
*NL*
yes
,
and
about
the
drift
and
progress
of
human
opinion
and
movement
,
*NL*
too
.
There
are
written
laws
--
they
perish
;
but
there
are
also
*NL*
unwritten
laws
--
_
they
_
are
eternal
.
Take
the
unwritten
law
of
wages
:
*NL*
it
says
they
've
got
to
advance
,
little
by
little
,
straight
through
*NL*
the
centuries
.
And
notice
how
it
works
.
We
know
what
wages
are
*NL*
now
,
here
and
there
and
yonder
;
we
strike
an
average
,
and
say
that
's
*NL*
the
wages
of
to-day
.
We
know
what
the
wages
were
a
hundred
years
*NL*
ago
,
and
what
they
were
two
hundred
years
ago
;
that
's
as
far
back
*NL*
as
we
can
get
,
but
it
suffices
to
give
us
the
law
of
progress
,
*NL*
the
measure
and
rate
of
the
periodical
augmentation
;
and
so
,
without
*NL*
a
document
to
help
us
,
we
can
come
pretty
close
to
determining
*NL*
what
the
wages
were
three
and
four
and
five
hundred
years
ago
.
*NL*
Good
,
so
far
.
Do
we
stop
there
?
No
.
We
stop
looking
backward
;
*NL*
we
face
around
and
apply
the
law
to
the
future
.
My
friends
,
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
what
people
's
wages
are
going
to
be
at
any
date
in
the
*NL*
future
you
want
to
know
,
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
goodman
,
what
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
In
seven
hundred
years
wages
will
have
risen
to
six
times
*NL*
what
they
are
now
,
here
in
your
region
,
and
farm
hands
will
be
*NL*
allowed
3
cents
a
day
,
and
mechanics
6
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
'
t
I
might
die
now
and
live
then
!
''
interrupted
Smug
,
the
*NL*
wheelwright
,
with
a
fine
avaricious
glow
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
n't
all
;
they
'll
get
their
board
besides
--
such
as
it
is
:
*NL*
it
wo
n't
bloat
them

Two
hundred
and
fifty
years
later

pay
attention
*NL*
now

a
mechanic

wages
will
be

you

*NL*
guesswork

wages
will
then
be

twenty

cents
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
gasp
of
awed
astonishment
,
Dickon
the
mason
*NL*
murmured
,
with
raised
eyes
and
hands
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
three
weeks

pay
for
one
day
's
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Riches
!
--
of
a
truth
,
yes
,
riches
!
''
muttered
Marco
,
his
breath
*NL*
coming
quick
and
short
,
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wages
will
keep
on
rising
,
little
by
little
,
little
by
little
,
*NL*
as
steadily
as
a
tree
grows
,
and
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
and
*NL*
forty
years
more
there
'll
be
at
least
_
one
_
country
where
the
*NL*
mechanic
's
average
wage
will
be
_
two
hundred
_
cents
a
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
knocked
them
absolutely
dumb
!
Not
a
man
of
them
could
get
*NL*
his
breath
for
upwards
of
two
minutes
.
Then
the
coal-burner
*NL*
said
prayerfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
I
but
live
to
see
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
income
of
an
earl
!
''
said
Smug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
earl

ye
?
''
said
Dowley
;
``
ye
could
say
more
than
that
and
*NL*
speak
no
lie
;
there
's
no
earl

Bagdemagus
that

*NL*
an

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

that
is
what
is
going

In

Sometimes

Yes

Thirteen

says
the

tranquilly
arrange

away
down

one-sided

But
there
's
*NL*
one
thing
which
certainly
is
n't
fair
.
The
magistrate
fixes
a
*NL*
mechanic
's
wage
at
one
cent
a
day
,
for
instance
.
The
law
says
that
*NL*
if
any
master
shall
venture
,
even
under
utmost
press
of
business
,
*NL*
to
pay
anything
_
over
_
that
cent
a
day
,
even
for
a
single
day
,
he
*NL*
shall
be
both
fined
and
pilloried
for
it
;
and
whoever
knows
he
did
*NL*
it
and
does
n't
inform
,
they
also
shall
be
fined
and
pilloried
.
Now
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
unfair
,
Dowley
,
and
a
deadly
peril
to
all
of
us
,
*NL*
that
because
you
thoughtlessly
confessed
,
a
while
ago
,
that
within
*NL*
a
week
you
have
paid
a
cent
and
fifteen
mil
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
I
tell
_
you
_
it
was
a
smasher
!
You
ought
to
have
seen
them
to
*NL*
go
to
pieces
,
the
whole
gang
.
I
had
just
slipped
up
on
poor
*NL*
smiling
and
complacent
Dowley
so
nice
and
easy
and
softly
,
that
*NL*
he
never
suspected
anything
was
going
to
happen
till
the
blow
*NL*
came
crashing
down
and
knocked
him
all
to
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fine
effect
.
In
fact
,
as
fine
as
any
I
ever
produced
,
with
so
*NL*
little
time
to
work
it
up
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
saw
in
a
moment
that
I
had
overdone
the
thing
a
little
.
*NL*
I
was
expecting
to
scare
them
,
but
I
was
n't
expecting
to
scare
*NL*
them
to
death
.
They
were
mighty
near
it
,
though
.
You
see
they
*NL*
had
been
a
whole
lifetime
learning
to
appreciate
the
pillory
;
and
*NL*
to
have
that
thing
staring
them
in
the
face
,
and
every
one
of
them
*NL*
distinctly
at
the
mercy
of
me
,
a
stranger
,
if
I
chose
to
go
and
*NL*
report
--
well
,
it
was
awful
,
and
they
could
n't
seem
to
recover
*NL*
from
the
shock
,
they
could
n't
seem
to
pull
themselves
together
.
*NL*
Pale
,
shaky
,
dumb
,
pitiful
?
Why
,
they
were
n't
any
better
than
*NL*
so
many
dead
men
.
It
was
very
uncomfortable
.
Of
course
,
I
thought
*NL*
they
would
appeal
to
me
to
keep
mum
,
and
then
we
would
shake
hands
,
*NL*
and
take
a
drink
all
round
,
and
laugh
it
off
,
and
there
an
end
.
*NL*
But
no
;
you
see
I
was
an
unknown
person
,
among
a
cruelly
oppressed
*NL*
and
suspicious
people
,
a
people
always
accustomed
to
having
advantage
*NL*
taken
of
their
helplessness
,
and
never
expecting
just
or
kind
*NL*
treatment
from
any
but
their
own
families
and
very
closest
intimates
.
*NL*
Appeal
to
_
me
_
to
be
gentle
,
to
be
fair
,
to
be
generous
?
Of
course
,
*NL*
they
wanted
to
,
but
they
could
n't
dare
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
YANKEE
AND
THE
KING
SOLD
AS
SLAVES
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
what
had
I
better
do
?
Nothing
in
a
hurry
,
sure
.
I
must
*NL*
get
up
a
diversion
;
anything
to
employ
me
while
I
could
think
,
*NL*
and
while
these
poor
fellows
could
have
a
chance
to
come
to
life
*NL*
again
.
There
sat
Marco
,
petrified
in
the
act
of
trying
to
get
*NL*
the
hang
of
his
miller-gun
--
turned
to
stone
,
just
in
the
attitude
*NL*
he
was
in
when
my
pile-driver
fell
,
the
toy
still
gripped
in
his
*NL*
unconscious
fingers
.
So
I
took
it
from
him
and
proposed
to
explain
*NL*
its
mystery
.
Mystery
!
a
simple
little
thing
like
that
;
and
yet
it
*NL*
was
mysterious
enough
,
for
that
race
and
that
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
such
an
awkward
people
,
with
machinery
;
you
see
,
they
*NL*
were
totally
unused
to
it
.
The
miller-gun
was
a
little
double-barreled
*NL*
tube
of
toughened
glass
,
with
a
neat
little
trick
of
a
spring
*NL*
to
it
,
which
upon
pressure
would
let
a
shot
escape
.
But
the
shot
*NL*
would
n't
hurt
anybody
,
it
would
only
drop
into
your
hand
.
In
the
*NL*
gun
were
two
sizes
--
wee
mustard-seed
shot
,
and
another
sort
that
*NL*
were
several
times
larger
.
They
were
money
.
The
mustard-seed
*NL*
shot
represented
milrays
,
the
larger
ones
mills
.
So
the
gun
was
*NL*
a
purse
;
and
very
handy
,
too
;
you
could
pay
out
money
in
the
dark
*NL*
with
it
,
with
accuracy
;
and
you
could
carry
it
in
your
mouth
;
or
*NL*
in
your
vest
pocket
,
if
you
had
one
.
I
made
them
of
several
sizes
*NL*
--
one
size
so
large
that
it
would
carry
the
equivalent
of
a
dollar
.
*NL*
Using
shot
for
money
was
a
good
thing
for
the
government
;
the
metal
*NL*
cost
nothing
,
and
the
money
could
n't
be
counterfeited
,
for
I
was
*NL*
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
who
knew
how
to
manage
a
shot
tower
.
*NL*
``
Paying
the
shot
''
soon
came
to
be
a
common
phrase
.
Yes
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
it
would
still
be
passing
men
's
lips
,
away
down
in
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
yet
none
would
suspect
how
and
when
it
originated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
joined
us
,
about
this
time
,
mightily
refreshed
by
his
nap
,
*NL*
and
feeling
good
.
Anything
could
make
me
nervous
now
,
I
was
so
*NL*
uneasy
--
for
our
lives
were
in
danger
;
and
so
it
worried
me
to
*NL*
detect
a
complacent
something
in
the
king
's
eye
which
seemed
to
*NL*
indicate
that
he
had
been
loading
himself
up
for
a
performance
*NL*
of
some
kind
or
other
;
confound
it
,
why
must
he
go
and
choose
*NL*
such
a
time
as
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
right
.
He
began
,
straight
off
,
in
the
most
innocently
*NL*
artful
,
and
transparent
,
and
lubberly
way
,
to
lead
up
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
agriculture
.
The
cold
sweat
broke
out
all
over
me
.
*NL*
I
wanted
to
whisper
in
his
ear
,
``
Man
,
we
are
in
awful
danger
!
*NL*
every
moment
is
worth
a
principality
till
we
get
back
these
men
's
*NL*
confidence
;
_
do
n't
_
waste
any
of
this
golden
time
.
''
But
of
course
*NL*
I
could
n't
do
it
.
Whisper
to
him
?
It
would
look
as
if
we
were
*NL*
conspiring
.
So
I
had
to
sit
there
and
look
calm
and
pleasant
while
*NL*
the
king
stood
over
that
dynamite
mine
and
mooned
along
about
his
*NL*
damned
onions
and
things
.
At
first
the
tumult
of
my
own
thoughts
,
*NL*
summoned
by
the
danger-signal
and
swarming
to
the
rescue
from
*NL*
every
quarter
of
my
skull
,
kept
up
such
a
hurrah
and
confusion
*NL*
and
fifing
and
drumming
that
I
could
n't
take
in
a
word
;
but
*NL*
presently
when
my
mob
of
gathering
plans
began
to
crystallize
*NL*
and
fall
into
position
and
form
line
of
battle
,
a
sort
of
order
and
*NL*
quiet
ensued
and
I
caught
the
boom
of
the
king
's
batteries
,
as
if
*NL*
out
of
remote
distance
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
were
not
the
best
way
,
methinks
,
albeit
it
is
not
to
be
denied
*NL*
that
authorities
differ
as
concerning
this
point
,
some
contending
*NL*
that
the
onion
is
but
an
unwholesome
berry
when
stricken
early
*NL*
from
the
tree
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
audience
showed
signs
of
life
,
and
sought
each
other
's
eyes
*NL*
in
a
surprised
and
troubled
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
whileas
others
do
yet
maintain
,
with
much
show
of
reason
,
that
*NL*
this
is
not
of
necessity
the
case
,
instancing
that
plums
and
other
*NL*
like
cereals
do
be
always
dug
in
the
unripe
state
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
audience
exhibited
distinct
distress
;
yes
,
and
also
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
yet
are
they
clearly
wholesome
,
the
more
especially
when
one
*NL*
doth
assuage
the
asperities
of
their
nature
by
admixture
of
the
*NL*
tranquilizing
juice
of
the
wayward
cabbage
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wild
light
of
terror
began
to
glow
in
these
men
's
eyes
,
and
*NL*
one
of
them
muttered
,
``
These
be
errors
,
every
one
--
God
hath
surely
*NL*
smitten
the
mind
of
this
farmer
.
''
I
was
in
miserable
apprehension
;
*NL*
I
sat
upon
thorns
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
and
further
instancing
the
known
truth
that
in
the
case
of
*NL*
animals
,
the
young
,
which
may
be
called
the
green
fruit
of
the
*NL*
creature
,
is
the
better
,
all
confessing
that
when
a
goat
is
ripe
,
*NL*
his
fur
doth
heat
and
sore
engame
his
flesh
,
the
which
defect
,
*NL*
taken
in
connection
with
his
several
rancid
habits
,
and
fulsome
*NL*
appetites
,
and
godless
attitudes
of
mind
,
and
bilious
quality
*NL*
of
morals
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rose
and
went
for
him
!
With
a
fierce
shout
,
``
The
one
would
*NL*
betray
us
,
the
other
is
mad
!
Kill
them
!
Kill
them
!
''
they
flung
*NL*
themselves
upon
us
.
What
joy
flamed
up
in
the
king
's
eye
!
He
*NL*
might
be
lame
in
agriculture
,
but
this
kind
of
thing
was
just
in
*NL*
his
line
.
He
had
been
fasting
long
,
he
was
hungry
for
a
fight
.
*NL*
He
hit
the
blacksmith
a
crack
under
the
jaw
that
lifted
him
clear
*NL*
off
his
feet
and
stretched
him
flat
on
his
back
.
``
St.
George
for
*NL*
Britain
!
''
and
he
downed
the
wheelwright
.
The
mason
was
big
,
but
*NL*
I
laid
him
out
like
nothing
.
The
three
gathered
themselves
up
and
*NL*
came
again
;
went
down
again
;
came
again
;
and
kept
on
repeating
*NL*
this
,
with
native
British
pluck
,
until
they
were
battered
to
jelly
,
*NL*
reeling
with
exhaustion
,
and
so
blind
that
they
could
n't
tell
us
*NL*
from
each
other
;
and
yet
they
kept
right
on
,
hammering
away
with
*NL*
what
might
was
left
in
them
.
Hammering
each
other
--
for
we
stepped
*NL*
aside
and
looked
on
while
they
rolled
,
and
struggled
,
and
gouged
,
*NL*
and
pounded
,
and
bit
,
with
the
strict
and
wordless
attention
to
*NL*
business
of
so
many
bulldogs
.
We
looked
on
without
apprehension
,
*NL*
for
they
were
fast
getting
past
ability
to
go
for
help
against
us
,
*NL*
and
the
arena
was
far
enough
from
the
public
road
to
be
safe
*NL*
from
intrusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
while
they
were
gradually
playing
out
,
it
suddenly
occurred
*NL*
to
me
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
Marco
.
I
looked
around
;
he
*NL*
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
Oh
,
but
this
was
ominous
!
I
pulled
the
*NL*
king
's
sleeve
,
and
we
glided
away
and
rushed
for
the
hut
.
No
Marco
*NL*
there
,
no
Phyllis
there
!
They
had
gone
to
the
road
for
help
,
sure
.
*NL*
I
told
the
king
to
give
his
heels
wings
,
and
I
would
explain
later
.
*NL*
We
made
good
time
across
the
open
ground
,
and
as
we
darted
into
*NL*
the
shelter
of
the
wood
I
glanced
back
and
saw
a
mob
of
excited
*NL*
peasants
swarm
into
view
,
with
Marco
and
his
wife
at
their
head
.
*NL*
They
were
making
a
world
of
noise
,
but
that
could
n't
hurt
anybody
;
*NL*
the
wood
was
dense
,
and
as
soon
as
we
were
well
into
its
depths
*NL*
we
would
take
to
a
tree
and
let
them
whistle
.
Ah
,
but
then
came
*NL*
another
sound
--
dogs
!
Yes
,
that
was
quite
another
matter
.
It
*NL*
magnified
our
contract
--
we
must
find
running
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
tore
along
at
a
good
gait
,
and
soon
left
the
sounds
far
behind
*NL*
and
modified
to
a
murmur
.
We
struck
a
stream
and
darted
into
it
.
*NL*
We
waded
swiftly
down
it
,
in
the
dim
forest
light
,
for
as
much
*NL*
as
three
hundred
yards
,
and
then
came
across
an
oak
with
a
great
*NL*
bough
sticking
out
over
the
water
.
We
climbed
up
on
this
bough
,
*NL*
and
began
to
work
our
way
along
it
to
the
body
of
the
tree
;
now
*NL*
we
began
to
hear
those
sounds
more
plainly
;
so
the
mob
had
struck
*NL*
our
trail
.
For
a
while
the
sounds
approached
pretty
fast
.
And
*NL*
then
for
another
while
they
did
n't
.
No
doubt
the
dogs
had
found
*NL*
the
place
where
we
had
entered
the
stream
,
and
were
now
waltzing
*NL*
up
and
down
the
shores
trying
to
pick
up
the
trail
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
snugly
lodged
in
the
tree
and
curtained
with
foliage
,
*NL*
the
king
was
satisfied
,
but
I
was
doubtful
.
I
believed
we
could
*NL*
crawl
along
a
branch
and
get
into
the
next
tree
,
and
I
judged
it
*NL*
worth
while
to
try
.
We
tried
it
,
and
made
a
success
of
it
,
though
*NL*
the
king
slipped
,
at
the
junction
,
and
came
near
failing
to
connect
.
*NL*
We
got
comfortable
lodgment
and
satisfactory
concealment
among
*NL*
the
foliage
,
and
then
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
listen
to
the
hunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
we
heard
it
coming
--
and
coming
on
the
jump
,
too
;
yes
,
*NL*
and
down
both
sides
of
the
stream
.
Louder
--
louder
--
next
minute
*NL*
it
swelled
swiftly
up
into
a
roar
of
shoutings
,
barkings
,
tramplings
,
*NL*
and
swept
by
like
a
cyclone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
that
the
overhanging
branch
would
suggest
something
*NL*
to
them
,
''
said
I
,
``
but
I
do
n't
mind
the
disappointment
.
Come
,
*NL*
my
liege
,
it
were
well
that
we
make
good
use
of
our
time
.
We
've
*NL*
flanked
them
.
Dark
is
coming
on
,
presently
.
If
we
can
cross
the
*NL*
stream
and
get
a
good
start
,
and
borrow
a
couple
of
horses
from
*NL*
somebody
's
pasture
to
use
for
a
few
hours
,
we
shall
be
safe
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
started
down
,
and
got
nearly
to
the
lowest
limb
,
when
we
seemed
*NL*
to
hear
the
hunt
returning
.
We
stopped
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
``
they
're
baffled
,
they
've
given
it
up
,
they
're
on
*NL*
their
way
home
.
We
will
climb
back
to
our
roost
again
,
and
let
*NL*
them
go
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
climbed
back
.
The
king
listened
a
moment
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
still
search
--
I
wit
the
sign
.
We
did
best
to
abide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
right
.
He
knew
more
about
hunting
than
I
did
.
The
noise
*NL*
approached
steadily
,
but
not
with
a
rush
.
The
king
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
reason
that
we
were
advantaged
by
no
parlous
start
of
them
,
*NL*
and
being
on
foot
are
as
yet
no
mighty
way
from
where
we
took
*NL*
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
that
is
about
it
,
I
am
afraid
,
though
I
was
hoping
*NL*
better
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
drew
nearer
and
nearer
,
and
soon
the
van
was
drifting
*NL*
under
us
,
on
both
sides
of
the
water
.
A
voice
called
a
halt
from
*NL*
the
other
bank
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
they
were
so
minded
,
they
could
get
to
yon
tree
by
this
branch
*NL*
that
overhangs
,
and
yet
not
touch
ground
.
Ye
will
do
well
to
send
*NL*
a
man
up
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
that
we
will
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
admire
my
cuteness
in
foreseeing
this
very
thing
*NL*
and
swapping
trees
to
beat
it
.
But
,
do
n't
you
know
,
there
are
*NL*
some
things
that
can
beat
smartness
and
foresight
?
Awkwardness
*NL*
and
stupidity
can
.
The
best
swordsman
in
the
world
does
n't
need
*NL*
to
fear
the
second
best
swordsman
in
the
world
;
no
,
the
person
*NL*
for
him
to
be
afraid
of
is
some
ignorant
antagonist
who
has
never
*NL*
had
a
sword
in
his
hand
before
;
he
does
n't
do
the
thing
he
ought
*NL*
to
do
,
and
so
the
expert
is
n't
prepared
for
him
;
he
does
the
thing
*NL*
he
ought
not
to
do
;
and
often
it
catches
the
expert
out
and
ends
*NL*
him
on
the
spot
.
Well
,
how
could
I
,
with
all
my
gifts
,
make
any
*NL*
valuable
preparation
against
a
near-sighted
,
cross-eyed
,
pudding-headed
*NL*
clown
who
would
aim
himself
at
the
wrong
tree
and
hit
the
right
*NL*
one
?
And
that
is
what
he
did
.
He
went
for
the
wrong
tree
,
which
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
the
right
one
by
mistake
,
and
up
he
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
were
serious
now
.
We
remained
still
,
and
awaited
developments
.
*NL*
The
peasant
toiled
his
difficult
way
up
.
The
king
raised
himself
*NL*
up
and
stood
;
he
made
a
leg
ready
,
and
when
the
comer
's
head
*NL*
arrived
in
reach
of
it
there
was
a
dull
thud
,
and
down
went
the
man
*NL*
floundering
to
the
ground
.
There
was
a
wild
outbreak
of
anger
*NL*
below
,
and
the
mob
swarmed
in
from
all
around
,
and
there
we
were
*NL*
treed
,
and
prisoners
.
Another
man
started
up
;
the
bridging
bough
*NL*
was
detected
,
and
a
volunteer
started
up
the
tree
that
furnished
*NL*
the
bridge
.
The
king
ordered
me
to
play
Horatius
and
keep
the
*NL*
bridge
.
For
a
while
the
enemy
came
thick
and
fast
;
but
no
matter
,
*NL*
the
head
man
of
each
procession
always
got
a
buffet
that
dislodged
*NL*
him
as
soon
as
he
came
in
reach
.
The
king
's
spirits
rose
,
his
joy
*NL*
was
limitless
.
He
said
that
if
nothing
occurred
to
mar
the
prospect
*NL*
we
should
have
a
beautiful
night
,
for
on
this
line
of
tactics
we
*NL*
could
hold
the
tree
against
the
whole
country-side
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
mob
soon
came
to
that
conclusion
themselves
;
wherefore
*NL*
they
called
off
the
assault
and
began
to
debate
other
plans
.
*NL*
They
had
no
weapons
,
but
there
were
plenty
of
stones
,
and
stones
*NL*
might
answer
.
We
had
no
objections
.
A
stone
might
possibly
*NL*
penetrate
to
us
once
in
a
while
,
but
it
was
n't
very
likely
;
we
were
*NL*
well
protected
by
boughs
and
foliage
,
and
were
not
visible
from
*NL*
any
good
aiming
point
.
If
they
would
but
waste
half
an
hour
in
*NL*
stone-throwing
,
the
dark
would
come
to
our
help
.
We
were
feeling
*NL*
very
well
satisfied
.
We
could
smile
;
almost
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
did
n't
;
which
was
just
as
well
,
for
we
should
have
been
*NL*
interrupted
.
Before
the
stones
had
been
raging
through
the
leaves
*NL*
and
bouncing
from
the
boughs
fifteen
minutes
,
we
began
to
notice
*NL*
a
smell
.
A
couple
of
sniffs
of
it
was
enough
of
an
explanation
*NL*
--
it
was
smoke
!
Our
game
was
up
at
last
.
We
recognized
that
.
When
*NL*
smoke
invites
you
,
you
have
to
come
.
They
raised
their
pile
of
*NL*
dry
brush
and
damp
weeds
higher
and
higher
,
and
when
they
saw
*NL*
the
thick
cloud
begin
to
roll
up
and
smother
the
tree
,
they
broke
*NL*
out
in
a
storm
of
joy-clamors
.
I
got
enough
breath
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proceed
,
my
liege
;
after
you
is
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
gasped
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
down
,
and
then
back
thyself
against
one
side
of
the
*NL*
trunk
,
and
leave
me
the
other
.
Then
will
we
fight
.
Let
each
pile
*NL*
his
dead
according
to
his
own
fashion
and
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
descended
,
barking
and
coughing
,
and
I
followed
.
I
struck
*NL*
the
ground
an
instant
after
him
;
we
sprang
to
our
appointed
places
,
*NL*
and
began
to
give
and
take
with
all
our
might
.
The
powwow
and
*NL*
racket
were
prodigious
;
it
was
a
tempest
of
riot
and
confusion
and
*NL*
thick-falling
blows
.
Suddenly
some
horsemen
tore
into
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
crowd
,
and
a
voice
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
--
or
ye
are
dead
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
good
it
sounded
!
The
owner
of
the
voice
bore
all
the
marks
of
*NL*
a
gentleman
:
picturesque
and
costly
raiment
,
the
aspect
of
command
,
*NL*
a
hard
countenance
,
with
complexion
and
features
marred
by
dissipation
.
*NL*
The
mob
fell
humbly
back
,
like
so
many
spaniels
.
The
gentleman
*NL*
inspected
us
critically
,
then
said
sharply
to
the
peasants
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
ye
doing
to
these
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
be
madmen
,
worshipful
sir
,
that
have
come
wandering
we
know
*NL*
not
whence
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
know
not
whence
?
Do
ye
pretend
ye
know
them
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
honored
sir
,
we
speak
but
the
truth
.
They
are
strangers
*NL*
and
unknown
to
any
in
this
region
;
and
they
be
the
most
violent
*NL*
and
bloodthirsty
madmen
that
ever
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
!
Ye
know
not
what
ye
say
.
They
are
not
mad
.
Who
are
ye
?
*NL*
And
whence
are
ye
?
Explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
but
peaceful
strangers
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
traveling
upon
*NL*
our
own
concerns
.
We
are
from
a
far
country
,
and
unacquainted
*NL*
here
.
We
have
purposed
no
harm
;
and
yet
but
for
your
brave
*NL*
interference
and
protection
these
people
would
have
killed
us
.
*NL*
As
you
have
divined
,
sir
,
we
are
not
mad
;
neither
are
we
violent
*NL*
or
bloodthirsty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
turned
to
his
retinue
and
said
calmly
:
``
Lash
me
*NL*
these
animals
to
their
kennels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mob
vanished
in
an
instant
;
and
after
them
plunged
the
horsemen
,
*NL*
laying
about
them
with
their
whips
and
pitilessly
riding
down
such
*NL*
as
were
witless
enough
to
keep
the
road
instead
of
taking
to
the
*NL*
bush
.
The
shrieks
and
supplications
presently
died
away
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
and
soon
the
horsemen
began
to
straggle
back
.
Meantime
*NL*
the
gentleman
had
been
questioning
us
more
closely
,
but
had
dug
*NL*
no
particulars
out
of
us
.
We
were
lavish
of
recognition
of
the
*NL*
service
he
was
doing
us
,
but
we
revealed
nothing
more
than
that
we
*NL*
were
friendless
strangers
from
a
far
country
.
When
the
escort
were
*NL*
all
returned
,
the
gentleman
said
to
one
of
his
servants
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
the
led-horses
and
mount
these
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
placed
toward
the
rear
,
among
the
servants
.
We
traveled
*NL*
pretty
fast
,
and
finally
drew
rein
some
time
after
dark
at
a
*NL*
roadside
inn
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
the
scene
of
our
*NL*
troubles
.
My
lord
went
immediately
to
his
room
,
after
ordering
*NL*
his
supper
,
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
.
At
dawn
in
the
morning
*NL*
we
breakfasted
and
made
ready
to
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
lord
's
chief
attendant
sauntered
forward
at
that
moment
with
*NL*
indolent
grace
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
said
ye
should
continue
upon
this
road
,
which
is
our
*NL*
direction
likewise
;
wherefore
my
lord
,
the
earl
Grip
,
hath
given
*NL*
commandment
that
ye
retain
the
horses
and
ride
,
and
that
certain
*NL*
of
us
ride
with
ye
a
twenty
mile
to
a
fair
town
that
hight
Cambenet
,
*NL*
whenso
ye
shall
be
out
of
peril
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
do
nothing
less
than
express
our
thanks
and
accept
the
*NL*
offer
.
We
jogged
along
,
six
in
the
party
,
at
a
moderate
and
*NL*
comfortable
gait
,
and
in
conversation
learned
that
my
lord
Grip
*NL*
was
a
very
great
personage
in
his
own
region
,
which
lay
a
day
's
*NL*
journey
beyond
Cambenet
.
We
loitered
to
such
a
degree
that
it
was
*NL*
near
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
when
we
entered
the
market
square
*NL*
of
the
town
.
We
dismounted
,
and
left
our
thanks
once
more
for
*NL*
my
lord
,
and
then
approached
a
crowd
assembled
in
the
center
of
*NL*
the
square
,
to
see
what
might
be
the
object
of
interest
.
It
was
the
*NL*
remnant
of
that
old
peregrinating
band
of
slaves
!
So
they
had
*NL*
been
dragging
their
chains
about
,
all
this
weary
time
.
That
poor
*NL*
husband
was
gone
,
and
also
many
others
;
and
some
few
purchases
*NL*
had
been
added
to
the
gang
.
The
king
was
not
interested
,
and
*NL*
wanted
to
move
along
,
but
I
was
absorbed
,
and
full
of
pity
.
I
could
*NL*
not
take
my
eyes
away
from
these
worn
and
wasted
wrecks
of
humanity
.
*NL*
There
they
sat
,
grounded
upon
the
ground
,
silent
,
uncomplaining
,
*NL*
with
bowed
heads
,
a
pathetic
sight
.
And
by
hideous
contrast
,
a
*NL*
redundant
orator
was
making
a
speech
to
another
gathering
not
thirty
*NL*
steps
away
,
in
fulsome
laudation
of
``
our
glorious
British
liberties
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
boiling
.
I
had
forgotten
I
was
a
plebeian
,
I
was
remembering
*NL*
I
was
a
man
.
Cost
what
it
might
,
I
would
mount
that
rostrum
and
--
*NL*
*NL*
Click
!
the
king
and
I
were
handcuffed
together
!
Our
companions
,
*NL*
those
servants
,
had
done
it
;
my
lord
Grip
stood
looking
on
.
The
*NL*
king
burst
out
in
a
fury
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
meaneth
this
ill-mannered
jest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
lord
merely
said
to
his
head
miscreant
,
coolly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
up
the
slaves
and
sell
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
Slaves
!
_
The
word
had
a
new
sound
--
and
how
unspeakably
awful
!
The
*NL*
king
lifted
his
manacles
and
brought
them
down
with
a
deadly
force
;
*NL*
but
my
lord
was
out
of
the
way
when
they
arrived
.
A
dozen
of
*NL*
the
rascal
's
servants
sprang
forward
,
and
in
a
moment
we
were
*NL*
helpless
,
with
our
hands
bound
behind
us
.
We
so
loudly
and
so
*NL*
earnestly
proclaimed
ourselves
freemen
,
that
we
got
the
interested
*NL*
attention
of
that
liberty-mouthing
orator
and
his
patriotic
crowd
,
*NL*
and
they
gathered
about
us
and
assumed
a
very
determined
attitude
.
*NL*
The
orator
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
,
indeed
,
ye
are
freemen
,
ye
have
nought
to
fear
--
the
God-given
*NL*
liberties
of
Britain
are
about
ye
for
your
shield
and
shelter
!
*NL*
-LRB-
Applause
.
-RRB-
Ye
shall
soon
see
.
Bring
forth
your
proofs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
proofs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proof
that
ye
are
freemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
--
I
remembered
!
I
came
to
myself
;
I
said
nothing
.
But
the
*NL*
king
stormed
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
`
rt
insane
,
man
.
It
were
better
,
and
more
in
reason
,
that
*NL*
this
thief
and
scoundrel
here
prove
that
we
are
_
not
_
freemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
,
he
knew
his
own
laws
just
as
other
people
so
often
know
*NL*
the
laws
;
by
words
,
not
by
effects
.
They
take
a
_
meaning
_
,
and
get
*NL*
to
be
very
vivid
,
when
you
come
to
apply
them
to
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
hands
shook
their
heads
and
looked
disappointed
;
some
turned
*NL*
away
,
no
longer
interested
.
The
orator
said
--
and
this
time
in
the
*NL*
tones
of
business
,
not
of
sentiment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
ye
do
not
know
your
country
's
laws
,
it
were
time
ye
learned
*NL*
them
.
Ye
are
strangers
to
us
;
ye
will
not
deny
that
.
Ye
may
be
*NL*
freemen
,
we
do
not
deny
that
;
but
also
ye
may
be
slaves
.
The
law
*NL*
is
clear
:
it
doth
not
require
the
claimant
to
prove
ye
are
slaves
,
*NL*
it
requireth
you
to
prove
ye
are
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
sir
,
give
us
only
time
to
send
to
Astolat
;
or
give
us
only
*NL*
time
to
send
to
the
Valley
of
Holiness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
,
good
man
,
these
are
extraordinary
requests
,
and
you
may
*NL*
not
hope
to
have
them
granted
.
It
would
cost
much
time
,
and
would
*NL*
unwarrantably
inconvenience
your
master
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Master

,
idiot
!
''
stormed
the
king
.
``
I
have
no
master
,
I
myself
*NL*
am
the
m
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
the
words
out
in
time
to
stop
the
king
.
We
were
in
trouble
*NL*
enough
already
;
it
could
not
help
us
any
to
give
these
people
*NL*
the
notion
that
we
were
lunatics
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
use
in
stringing
out
the
details
.
The
earl
put
us
up
*NL*
and
sold
us
at
auction
.
This
same
infernal
law
had
existed
in
*NL*
our
own
South
in
my
own
time
,
more
than
thirteen
hundred
years
*NL*
later
,
and
under
it
hundreds
of
freemen
who
could
not
prove
that
*NL*
they
were
freemen
had
been
sold
into
lifelong
slavery
without
*NL*
the
circumstance
making
any
particular
impression
upon
me
;
but
the
*NL*
minute
law
and
the
auction
block
came
into
my
personal
experience
,
*NL*
a
thing
which
had
been
merely
improper
before
became
suddenly
*NL*
hellish
.
Well
,
that
's
the
way
we
are
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
we
were
sold
at
auction
,
like
swine
.
In
a
big
town
and
an
*NL*
active
market
we
should
have
brought
a
good
price
;
but
this
place
*NL*
was
utterly
stagnant
and
so
we
sold
at
a
figure
which
makes
me
*NL*
ashamed
,
every
time
I
think
of
it
.
The
King
of
England
brought
*NL*
seven
dollars
,
and
his
prime
minister
nine
;
whereas
the
king
was
*NL*
easily
worth
twelve
dollars
and
I
as
easily
worth
fifteen
.
But
*NL*
that
is
the
way
things
always
go
;
if
you
force
a
sale
on
a
dull
*NL*
market
,
I
do
n't
care
what
the
property
is
,
you
are
going
to
make
*NL*
a
poor
business
of
it
,
and
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
it
.
If
*NL*
the
earl
had
had
wit
enough
to
--
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
there
is
no
occasion
for
my
working
my
sympathies
up
*NL*
on
his
account
.
Let
him
go
,
for
the
present
;
I
took
his
number
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slave-dealer
bought
us
both
,
and
hitched
us
onto
that
long
*NL*
chain
of
his
,
and
we
constituted
the
rear
of
his
procession
.
We
*NL*
took
up
our
line
of
march
and
passed
out
of
Cambenet
at
noon
;
*NL*
and
it
seemed
to
me
unaccountably
strange
and
odd
that
the
King
*NL*
of
England
and
his
chief
minister
,
marching
manacled
and
fettered
*NL*
and
yoked
,
in
a
slave
convoy
,
could
move
by
all
manner
of
idle
men
*NL*
and
women
,
and
under
windows
where
sat
the
sweet
and
the
lovely
,
*NL*
and
yet
never
attract
a
curious
eye
,
never
provoke
a
single
remark
.
*NL*
Dear
,
dear
,
it
only
shows
that
there
is
nothing
diviner
about
a
king
*NL*
than
there
is
about
a
tramp
,
after
all
.
He
is
just
a
cheap
and
*NL*
hollow
artificiality
when
you
do
n't
know
he
is
a
king
.
But
reveal
*NL*
his
quality
,
and
dear
me
it
takes
your
very
breath
away
to
look
*NL*
at
him
.
I
reckon
we
are
all
fools
.
Born
so
,
no
doubt
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
A
PITIFUL
INCIDENT
*NL*
*NL*
It
's
a
world
of
surprises
.
The
king
brooded
;
this
was
natural
.
*NL*
What
would
he
brood
about
,
should
you
say
?
Why
,
about
the
prodigious
*NL*
nature
of
his
fall
,
of
course
--
from
the
loftiest
place
in
the
world
*NL*
to
the
lowest
;
from
the
most
illustrious
station
in
the
world
to
*NL*
the
obscurest
;
from
the
grandest
vocation
among
men
to
the
basest
.
*NL*
No
,
I
take
my
oath
that
the
thing
that
graveled
him
most
,
to
start
*NL*
with
,
was
not
this
,
but
the
price
he
had
fetched
!
He
could
n't
*NL*
seem
to
get
over
that
seven
dollars
.
Well
,
it
stunned
me
so
,
when
*NL*
I
first
found
it
out
,
that
I
could
n't
believe
it
;
it
did
n't
seem
*NL*
natural
.
But
as
soon
as
my
mental
sight
cleared
and
I
got
a
right
*NL*
focus
on
it
,
I
saw
I
was
mistaken
;
it
_
was
_
natural
.
For
this
*NL*
reason
:
a
king
is
a
mere
artificiality
,
and
so
a
king
's
feelings
,
*NL*
like
the
impulses
of
an
automatic
doll
,
are
mere
artificialities
;
*NL*
but
as
a
man
,
he
is
a
reality
,
and
his
feelings
,
as
a
man
,
are
*NL*
real
,
not
phantoms
.
It
shames
the
average
man
to
be
valued
below
*NL*
his
own
estimate
of
his
worth
,
and
the
king
certainly
was
n't
*NL*
anything
more
than
an
average
man
,
if
he
was
up
that
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
Confound
him
,
he
wearied
me
with
arguments
to
show
that
in
anything
*NL*
like
a
fair
market
he
would
have
fetched
twenty-five
dollars
,
*NL*
sure
--
a
thing
which
was
plainly
nonsense
,
and
full
or
the
baldest
*NL*
conceit
;
I
was
n't
worth
it
myself
.
But
it
was
tender
ground
for
*NL*
me
to
argue
on
.
In
fact
,
I
had
to
simply
shirk
argument
and
do
*NL*
the
diplomatic
instead
.
I
had
to
throw
conscience
aside
,
and
*NL*
brazenly
concede
that
he
ought
to
have
brought
twenty-five
dollars
;
*NL*
whereas
I
was
quite
well
aware
that
in
all
the
ages
,
the
world
had
*NL*
never
seen
a
king
that
was
worth
half
the
money
,
and
during
the
*NL*
next
thirteen
centuries
would
n't
see
one
that
was
worth
the
fourth
*NL*
of
it
.
Yes
,
he
tired
me
.
If
he
began
to
talk
about
the
crops
;
*NL*
or
about
the
recent
weather
;
or
about
the
condition
of
politics
;
*NL*
or
about
dogs
,
or
cats
,
or
morals
,
or
theology
--
no
matter
what
*NL*
--
I
sighed
,
for
I
knew
what
was
coming
;
he
was
going
to
get
out
of
it
*NL*
a
palliation
of
that
tiresome
seven-dollar
sale
.
Wherever
we
*NL*
halted
where
there
was
a
crowd
,
he
would
give
me
a
look
which
*NL*
said
plainly
:
``
if
that
thing
could
be
tried
over
again
now
,
with
*NL*
this
kind
of
folk
,
you
would
see
a
different
result
.
''
Well
,
when
*NL*
he
was
first
sold
,
it
secretly
tickled
me
to
see
him
go
for
seven
*NL*
dollars
;
but
before
he
was
done
with
his
sweating
and
worrying
*NL*
I
wished
he
had
fetched
a
hundred
.
The
thing
never
got
a
chance
*NL*
to
die
,
for
every
day
,
at
one
place
or
another
,
possible
purchasers
*NL*
looked
us
over
,
and
,
as
often
as
any
other
way
,
their
comment
on
*NL*
the
king
was
something
like
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
two-dollar-and-a-half
chump
with
a
thirty-dollar
style
.
*NL*
Pity
but
style
was
marketable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
this
sort
of
remark
produced
an
evil
result
.
Our
owner
*NL*
was
a
practical
person
and
he
perceived
that
this
defect
must
be
*NL*
mended
if
he
hoped
to
find
a
purchaser
for
the
king
.
So
he
went
*NL*
to
work
to
take
the
style
out
of
his
sacred
majesty
.
I
could
have
*NL*
given
the
man
some
valuable
advice
,
but
I
did
n't
;
you
must
n't
*NL*
volunteer
advice
to
a
slave-driver
unless
you
want
to
damage
*NL*
the
cause
you
are
arguing
for
.
I
had
found
it
a
sufficiently
*NL*
difficult
job
to
reduce
the
king
's
style
to
a
peasant
's
style
,
*NL*
even
when
he
was
a
willing
and
anxious
pupil
;
now
then
,
to
undertake
*NL*
to
reduce
the
king
's
style
to
a
slave
's
style
--
and
by
force
--
go
to
!
*NL*
it
was
a
stately
contract
.
Never
mind
the
details
--
it
will
save
me
*NL*
trouble
to
let
you
imagine
them
.
I
will
only
remark
that
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
week
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
lash
and
club
*NL*
and
fist
had
done
their
work
well
;
the
king
's
body
was
a
sight
*NL*
to
see
--
and
to
weep
over
;
but
his
spirit
?
--
why
,
it
was
n't
even
*NL*
phased
.
Even
that
dull
clod
of
a
slave-driver
was
able
to
see
*NL*
that
there
can
be
such
a
thing
as
a
slave
who
will
remain
a
man
*NL*
till
he
dies
;
whose
bones
you
can
break
,
but
whose
manhood
you
*NL*
ca
n't
.
This
man
found
that
from
his
first
effort
down
to
his
*NL*
latest
,
he
could
n't
ever
come
within
reach
of
the
king
,
but
the
*NL*
king
was
ready
to
plunge
for
him
,
and
did
it
.
So
he
gave
up
*NL*
at
last
,
and
left
the
king
in
possession
of
his
style
unimpaired
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
,
the
king
was
a
good
deal
more
than
a
king
,
he
was
*NL*
a
man
;
and
when
a
man
is
a
man
,
you
ca
n't
knock
it
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
rough
time
for
a
month
,
tramping
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
,
*NL*
and
suffering
.
And
what
Englishman
was
the
most
interested
in
*NL*
the
slavery
question
by
that
time
?
His
grace
the
king
!
Yes
;
from
*NL*
being
the
most
indifferent
,
he
was
become
the
most
interested
.
*NL*
He
was
become
the
bitterest
hater
of
the
institution
I
had
ever
*NL*
heard
talk
.
And
so
I
ventured
to
ask
once
more
a
question
which
*NL*
I
had
asked
years
before
and
had
gotten
such
a
sharp
answer
that
*NL*
I
had
not
thought
it
prudent
to
meddle
in
the
matter
further
.
*NL*
Would
he
abolish
slavery
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
answer
was
as
sharp
as
before
,
but
it
was
music
this
time
;
*NL*
I
should
n't
ever
wish
to
hear
pleasanter
,
though
the
profanity
*NL*
was
not
good
,
being
awkwardly
put
together
,
and
with
the
crash-word
*NL*
almost
in
the
middle
instead
of
at
the
end
,
where
,
of
course
,
it
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
ready
and
willing
to
get
free
now
;
I
had
n't
wanted
to
get
*NL*
free
any
sooner
.
No
,
I
can
not
quite
say
that
.
I
had
wanted
to
,
*NL*
but
I
had
not
been
willing
to
take
desperate
chances
,
and
had
*NL*
always
dissuaded
the
king
from
them
.
But
now
--
ah
,
it
was
a
new
*NL*
atmosphere
!
Liberty
would
be
worth
any
cost
that
might
be
put
*NL*
upon
it
now
.
I
set
about
a
plan
,
and
was
straightway
charmed
*NL*
with
it
.
It
would
require
time
,
yes
,
and
patience
,
too
,
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
both
.
One
could
invent
quicker
ways
,
and
fully
as
sure
*NL*
ones
;
but
none
that
would
be
as
picturesque
as
this
;
none
that
*NL*
could
be
made
so
dramatic
.
And
so
I
was
not
going
to
give
this
*NL*
one
up
.
It
might
delay
us
months
,
but
no
matter
,
I
would
carry
*NL*
it
out
or
break
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
we
had
an
adventure
.
One
night
we
were
overtaken
*NL*
by
a
snow-storm
while
still
a
mile
from
the
village
we
were
making
*NL*
for
.
Almost
instantly
we
were
shut
up
as
in
a
fog
,
the
driving
*NL*
snow
was
so
thick
.
You
could
n't
see
a
thing
,
and
we
were
soon
*NL*
lost
.
The
slave-driver
lashed
us
desperately
,
for
he
saw
ruin
*NL*
before
him
,
but
his
lashings
only
made
matters
worse
,
for
they
*NL*
drove
us
further
from
the
road
and
from
likelihood
of
succor
.
*NL*
So
we
had
to
stop
at
last
and
slump
down
in
the
snow
where
we
*NL*
were
.
The
storm
continued
until
toward
midnight
,
then
ceased
.
*NL*
By
this
time
two
of
our
feebler
men
and
three
of
our
women
were
*NL*
dead
,
and
others
past
moving
and
threatened
with
death
.
Our
*NL*
master
was
nearly
beside
himself
.
He
stirred
up
the
living
,
and
*NL*
made
us
stand
,
jump
,
slap
ourselves
,
to
restore
our
circulation
,
*NL*
and
he
helped
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
came
a
diversion
.
We
heard
shrieks
and
yells
,
and
soon
a
*NL*
woman
came
running
and
crying
;
and
seeing
our
group
,
she
flung
*NL*
herself
into
our
midst
and
begged
for
protection
.
A
mob
of
people
*NL*
came
tearing
after
her
,
some
with
torches
,
and
they
said
she
was
a
*NL*
witch
who
had
caused
several
cows
to
die
by
a
strange
disease
,
*NL*
and
practiced
her
arts
by
help
of
a
devil
in
the
form
of
a
black
*NL*
cat
.
This
poor
woman
had
been
stoned
until
she
hardly
looked
*NL*
human
,
she
was
so
battered
and
bloody
.
The
mob
wanted
to
burn
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
now
,
what
do
you
suppose
our
master
did
?
When
we
closed
*NL*
around
this
poor
creature
to
shelter
her
,
he
saw
his
chance
.
He
*NL*
said
,
burn
her
here
,
or
they
should
n't
have
her
at
all
.
Imagine
*NL*
that
!
They
were
willing
.
They
fastened
her
to
a
post
;
they
*NL*
brought
wood
and
piled
it
about
her
;
they
applied
the
torch
while
*NL*
she
shrieked
and
pleaded
and
strained
her
two
young
daughters
*NL*
to
her
breast
;
and
our
brute
,
with
a
heart
solely
for
business
,
*NL*
lashed
us
into
position
about
the
stake
and
warmed
us
into
life
*NL*
and
commercial
value
by
the
same
fire
which
took
away
the
innocent
*NL*
life
of
that
poor
harmless
mother
.
That
was
the
sort
of
master
we
*NL*
had
.
I
took
_
his
_
number
.
That
snow-storm
cost
him
nine
of
his
*NL*
flock
;
and
he
was
more
brutal
to
us
than
ever
,
after
that
,
for
*NL*
many
days
together
,
he
was
so
enraged
over
his
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
adventures
all
along
.
One
day
we
ran
into
a
procession
.
*NL*
And
such
a
procession
!
All
the
riffraff
of
the
kingdom
seemed
*NL*
to
be
comprehended
in
it
;
and
all
drunk
at
that
.
In
the
van
was
*NL*
a
cart
with
a
coffin
in
it
,
and
on
the
coffin
sat
a
comely
young
*NL*
girl
of
about
eighteen
suckling
a
baby
,
which
she
squeezed
to
her
*NL*
breast
in
a
passion
of
love
every
little
while
,
and
every
little
*NL*
while
wiped
from
its
face
the
tears
which
her
eyes
rained
down
*NL*
upon
it
;
and
always
the
foolish
little
thing
smiled
up
at
her
,
*NL*
happy
and
content
,
kneading
her
breast
with
its
dimpled
fat
hand
,
*NL*
which
she
patted
and
fondled
right
over
her
breaking
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
and
women
,
boys
and
girls
,
trotted
along
beside
or
after
*NL*
the
cart
,
hooting
,
shouting
profane
and
ribald
remarks
,
singing
*NL*
snatches
of
foul
song
,
skipping
,
dancing
--
a
very
holiday
of
*NL*
hellions
,
a
sickening
sight
.
We
had
struck
a
suburb
of
London
,
*NL*
outside
the
walls
,
and
this
was
a
sample
of
one
sort
of
London
*NL*
society
.
Our
master
secured
a
good
place
for
us
near
the
gallows
.
*NL*
A
priest
was
in
attendance
,
and
he
helped
the
girl
climb
up
,
and
*NL*
said
comforting
words
to
her
,
and
made
the
under-sheriff
provide
*NL*
a
stool
for
her
.
Then
he
stood
there
by
her
on
the
gallows
,
and
*NL*
for
a
moment
looked
down
upon
the
mass
of
upturned
faces
at
his
*NL*
feet
,
then
out
over
the
solid
pavement
of
heads
that
stretched
away
*NL*
on
every
side
occupying
the
vacancies
far
and
near
,
and
then
began
*NL*
to
tell
the
story
of
the
case
.
And
there
was
pity
in
his
voice
*NL*
--
how
seldom
a
sound
that
was
in
that
ignorant
and
savage
land
!
*NL*
I
remember
every
detail
of
what
he
said
,
except
the
words
he
said
*NL*
it
in
;
and
so
I
change
it
into
my
own
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Law
is
intended
to
mete
out
justice
.
Sometimes
it
fails
.
This
*NL*
can
not
be
helped
.
We
can
only
grieve
,
and
be
resigned
,
and
pray
*NL*
for
the
soul
of
him
who
falls
unfairly
by
the
arm
of
the
law
,
and
*NL*
that
his
fellows
may
be
few
.
A
law
sends
this
poor
young
thing
*NL*
to
death
--
and
it
is
right
.
But
another
law
had
placed
her
where
*NL*
she
must
commit
her
crime
or
starve
with
her
child
--
and
before
God
*NL*
that
law
is
responsible
for
both
her
crime
and
her
ignominious
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
while
ago
this
young
thing
,
this
child
of
eighteen
years
,
*NL*
was
as
happy
a
wife
and
mother
as
any
in
England
;
and
her
lips
*NL*
were
blithe
with
song
,
which
is
the
native
speech
of
glad
and
*NL*
innocent
hearts
.
Her
young
husband
was
as
happy
as
she
;
for
he
was
*NL*
doing
his
whole
duty
,
he
worked
early
and
late
at
his
handicraft
,
*NL*
his
bread
was
honest
bread
well
and
fairly
earned
,
he
was
prospering
,
*NL*
he
was
furnishing
shelter
and
sustenance
to
his
family
,
he
was
*NL*
adding
his
mite
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
.
By
consent
of
a
*NL*
treacherous
law
,
instant
destruction
fell
upon
this
holy
home
and
*NL*
swept
it
away
!
That
young
husband
was
waylaid
and
impressed
,
*NL*
and
sent
to
sea
.
The
wife
knew
nothing
of
it
.
She
sought
him
*NL*
everywhere
,
she
moved
the
hardest
hearts
with
the
supplications
*NL*
of
her
tears
,
the
broken
eloquence
of
her
despair
.
Weeks
dragged
*NL*
by
,
she
watching
,
waiting
,
hoping
,
her
mind
going
slowly
to
wreck
*NL*
under
the
burden
of
her
misery
.
Little
by
little
all
her
small
*NL*
possessions
went
for
food
.
When
she
could
no
longer
pay
her
rent
,
*NL*
they
turned
her
out
of
doors
.
She
begged
,
while
she
had
strength
;
*NL*
when
she
was
starving
at
last
,
and
her
milk
failing
,
she
stole
a
*NL*
piece
of
linen
cloth
of
the
value
of
a
fourth
part
of
a
cent
,
*NL*
thinking
to
sell
it
and
save
her
child
.
But
she
was
seen
by
the
*NL*
owner
of
the
cloth
.
She
was
put
in
jail
and
brought
to
trial
.
*NL*
The
man
testified
to
the
facts
.
A
plea
was
made
for
her
,
and
her
*NL*
sorrowful
story
was
told
in
her
behalf
.
She
spoke
,
too
,
by
*NL*
permission
,
and
said
she
did
steal
the
cloth
,
but
that
her
mind
*NL*
was
so
disordered
of
late
by
trouble
that
when
she
was
overborne
*NL*
with
hunger
all
acts
,
criminal
or
other
,
swam
meaningless
through
*NL*
her
brain
and
she
knew
nothing
rightly
,
except
that
she
was
so
*NL*
hungry
!
For
a
moment
all
were
touched
,
and
there
was
disposition
*NL*
to
deal
mercifully
with
her
,
seeing
that
she
was
so
young
and
*NL*
friendless
,
and
her
case
so
piteous
,
and
the
law
that
robbed
her
*NL*
of
her
support
to
blame
as
being
the
first
and
only
cause
of
her
*NL*
transgression
;
but
the
prosecuting
officer
replied
that
whereas
*NL*
these
things
were
all
true
,
and
most
pitiful
as
well
,
still
there
*NL*
was
much
small
theft
in
these
days
,
and
mistimed
mercy
here
would
*NL*
be
a
danger
to
property
--
oh
,
my
God
,
is
there
no
property
in
ruined
*NL*
homes
,
and
orphaned
babes
,
and
broken
hearts
that
British
law
*NL*
holds
precious
!
--
and
so
he
must
require
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
,
the
owner
of
the
stolen
*NL*
linen
rose
trembling
up
,
his
lip
quivering
,
his
face
as
gray
as
*NL*
ashes
;
and
when
the
awful
words
came
,
he
cried
out
,
`
Oh
,
poor
*NL*
child
,
poor
child
,
I
did
not
know
it
was
death
!
'
and
fell
as
a
*NL*
tree
falls
.
When
they
lifted
him
up
his
reason
was
gone
;
before
*NL*
the
sun
was
set
,
he
had
taken
his
own
life
.
A
kindly
man
;
a
man
*NL*
whose
heart
was
right
,
at
bottom
;
add
his
murder
to
this
that
*NL*
is
to
be
now
done
here
;
and
charge
them
both
where
they
belong
*NL*
--
to
the
rulers
and
the
bitter
laws
of
Britain
.
The
time
is
come
,
my
*NL*
child
;
let
me
pray
over
thee
--
not
_
for
_
thee
,
dear
abused
poor
heart
*NL*
and
innocent
,
but
for
them
that
be
guilty
of
thy
ruin
and
death
,
*NL*
who
need
it
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
prayer
they
put
the
noose
around
the
young
girl
's
neck
,
*NL*
and
they
had
great
trouble
to
adjust
the
knot
under
her
ear
,
*NL*
because
she
was
devouring
the
baby
all
the
time
,
wildly
kissing
it
,
*NL*
and
snatching
it
to
her
face
and
her
breast
,
and
drenching
it
*NL*
with
tears
,
and
half
moaning
,
half
shrieking
all
the
while
,
and
the
*NL*
baby
crowing
,
and
laughing
,
and
kicking
its
feet
with
delight
over
*NL*
what
it
took
for
romp
and
play
.
Even
the
hangman
could
n't
stand
it
,
*NL*
but
turned
away
.
When
all
was
ready
the
priest
gently
pulled
and
*NL*
tugged
and
forced
the
child
out
of
the
mother
's
arms
,
and
stepped
*NL*
quickly
out
of
her
reach
;
but
she
clasped
her
hands
,
and
made
a
*NL*
wild
spring
toward
him
,
with
a
shriek
;
but
the
rope
--
and
the
*NL*
under-sheriff
--
held
her
short
.
Then
she
went
on
her
knees
and
*NL*
stretched
out
her
hands
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
kiss
--
oh
,
my
God
,
one
more
,
one
more
,
--
it
is
the
dying
*NL*
that
begs
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
it
;
she
almost
smothered
the
little
thing
.
And
when
they
*NL*
got
it
away
again
,
she
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
child
,
my
darling
,
it
will
die
!
It
has
no
home
,
it
has
*NL*
no
father
,
no
friend
,
no
mother
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
them
all
!
''
said
that
good
priest
.
``
All
these
will
I
be
*NL*
to
it
till
I
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
should
have
seen
her
face
then
!
Gratitude
?
Lord
,
what
do
*NL*
you
want
with
words
to
express
that
?
Words
are
only
painted
fire
;
*NL*
a
look
is
the
fire
itself
.
She
gave
that
look
,
and
carried
it
away
*NL*
to
the
treasury
of
heaven
,
where
all
things
that
are
divine
belong
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
AN
ENCOUNTER
IN
THE
DARK
*NL*
*NL*
London
--
to
a
slave
--
was
a
sufficiently
interesting
place
.
It
was
*NL*
merely
a
great
big
village
;
and
mainly
mud
and
thatch
.
The
streets
*NL*
were
muddy
,
crooked
,
unpaved
.
The
populace
was
an
ever
flocking
*NL*
and
drifting
swarm
of
rags
,
and
splendors
,
of
nodding
plumes
and
*NL*
shining
armor
.
The
king
had
a
palace
there
;
he
saw
the
outside
*NL*
of
it
.
It
made
him
sigh
;
yes
,
and
swear
a
little
,
in
a
poor
*NL*
juvenile
sixth
century
way
.
We
saw
knights
and
grandees
whom
*NL*
we
knew
,
but
they
did
n't
know
us
in
our
rags
and
dirt
and
raw
*NL*
welts
and
bruises
,
and
would
n't
have
recognized
us
if
we
had
hailed
*NL*
them
,
nor
stopped
to
answer
,
either
,
it
being
unlawful
to
speak
*NL*
with
slaves
on
a
chain
.
Sandy
passed
within
ten
yards
of
me
on
*NL*
a
mule
--
hunting
for
me
,
I
imagined
.
But
the
thing
which
clean
*NL*
broke
my
heart
was
something
which
happened
in
front
of
our
old
*NL*
barrack
in
a
square
,
while
we
were
enduring
the
spectacle
of
a
man
*NL*
being
boiled
to
death
in
oil
for
counterfeiting
pennies
.
It
was
*NL*
the
sight
of
a
newsboy
--
and
I
could
n't
get
at
him
!
Still
,
I
had
*NL*
one
comfort
--
here
was
proof
that
Clarence
was
still
alive
and
*NL*
banging
away
.
I
meant
to
be
with
him
before
long
;
the
thought
was
*NL*
full
of
cheer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
one
little
glimpse
of
another
thing
,
one
day
,
which
gave
me
*NL*
a
great
uplift
.
It
was
a
wire
stretching
from
housetop
to
housetop
.
*NL*
Telegraph
or
telephone
,
sure
.
I
did
very
much
wish
I
had
a
little
*NL*
piece
of
it
.
It
was
just
what
I
needed
,
in
order
to
carry
out
my
*NL*
project
of
escape
.
My
idea
was
to
get
loose
some
night
,
along
with
*NL*
the
king
,
then
gag
and
bind
our
master
,
change
clothes
with
him
,
*NL*
batter
him
into
the
aspect
of
a
stranger
,
hitch
him
to
the
slave-chain
,
*NL*
assume
possession
of
the
property
,
march
to
Camelot
,
and
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
get
my
idea
;
you
see
what
a
stunning
dramatic
surprise
*NL*
I
would
wind
up
with
at
the
palace
.
It
was
all
feasible
,
if
*NL*
I
could
only
get
hold
of
a
slender
piece
of
iron
which
I
could
*NL*
shape
into
a
lock-pick
.
I
could
then
undo
the
lumbering
padlocks
*NL*
with
which
our
chains
were
fastened
,
whenever
I
might
choose
.
*NL*
But
I
never
had
any
luck
;
no
such
thing
ever
happened
to
fall
*NL*
in
my
way
.
However
,
my
chance
came
at
last
.
A
gentleman
who
*NL*
had
come
twice
before
to
dicker
for
me
,
without
result
,
or
indeed
*NL*
any
approach
to
a
result
,
came
again
.
I
was
far
from
expecting
*NL*
ever
to
belong
to
him
,
for
the
price
asked
for
me
from
the
time
*NL*
I
was
first
enslaved
was
exorbitant
,
and
always
provoked
either
*NL*
anger
or
derision
,
yet
my
master
stuck
stubbornly
to
it
--
twenty-two
*NL*
dollars
.
He
would
n't
bate
a
cent
.
The
king
was
greatly
admired
,
*NL*
because
of
his
grand
physique
,
but
his
kingly
style
was
against
*NL*
him
,
and
he
was
n't
salable
;
nobody
wanted
that
kind
of
a
slave
.
*NL*
I
considered
myself
safe
from
parting
from
him
because
of
my
*NL*
extravagant
price
.
No
,
I
was
not
expecting
to
ever
belong
to
*NL*
this
gentleman
whom
I
have
spoken
of
,
but
he
had
something
which
*NL*
I
expected
would
belong
to
me
eventually
,
if
he
would
but
visit
*NL*
us
often
enough
.
It
was
a
steel
thing
with
a
long
pin
to
it
,
with
*NL*
which
his
long
cloth
outside
garment
was
fastened
together
in
*NL*
front
.
There
were
three
of
them
.
He
had
disappointed
me
twice
,
*NL*
because
he
did
not
come
quite
close
enough
to
me
to
make
my
project
*NL*
entirely
safe
;
but
this
time
I
succeeded
;
I
captured
the
lower
*NL*
clasp
of
the
three
,
and
when
he
missed
it
he
thought
he
had
lost
*NL*
it
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
chance
to
be
glad
about
a
minute
,
then
straightway
a
chance
*NL*
to
be
sad
again
.
For
when
the
purchase
was
about
to
fail
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
the
master
suddenly
spoke
up
and
said
what
would
be
worded
thus
*NL*
--
in
modern
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
I
'm
tired
supporting
these
two
for
*NL*
no
good
.
Give
me
twenty-two
dollars
for
this
one
,
and
I
'll
throw
*NL*
the
other
one
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
could
n't
get
his
breath
,
he
was
in
such
a
fury
.
He
began
*NL*
to
choke
and
gag
,
and
meantime
the
master
and
the
gentleman
moved
*NL*
away
discussing
.

``

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T

the
morrow
at
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

you

''
said
the
gentleman
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
,
the
master
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
a
time
of
it
to
cool
the
king
down
,
but
I
managed
it
.
*NL*
I
whispered
in
his
ear
,
to
this
effect
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
grace
_
will
_
go
for
nothing
,
but
after
another
fashion
.
And
*NL*
so
shall
I.
To-night
we
shall
both
be
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
How
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
thing
which
I
have
stolen
,
I
will
unlock
these
locks
*NL*
and
cast
off
these
chains
to-night
.
When
he
comes
about
nine-thirty
*NL*
to
inspect
us
for
the
night
,
we
will
seize
him
,
gag
him
,
batter
*NL*
him
,
and
early
in
the
morning
we
will
march
out
of
this
town
,
*NL*
proprietors
of
this
caravan
of
slaves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
as
far
as
I
went
,
but
the
king
was
charmed
and
satisfied
.
*NL*
That
evening
we
waited
patiently
for
our
fellow-slaves
to
get
*NL*
to
sleep
and
signify
it
by
the
usual
sign
,
for
you
must
not
take
*NL*
many
chances
on
those
poor
fellows
if
you
can
avoid
it
.
It
is
*NL*
best
to
keep
your
own
secrets
.
No
doubt
they
fidgeted
only
about
*NL*
as
usual
,
but
it
did
n't
seem
so
to
me
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
they
*NL*
were
going
to
be
forever
getting
down
to
their
regular
snoring
.
*NL*
As
the
time
dragged
on
I
got
nervously
afraid
we
should
n't
have
*NL*
enough
of
it
left
for
our
needs
;
so
I
made
several
premature
*NL*
attempts
,
and
merely
delayed
things
by
it
;
for
I
could
n't
seem
*NL*
to
touch
a
padlock
,
there
in
the
dark
,
without
starting
a
rattle
*NL*
out
of
it
which
interrupted
somebody
's
sleep
and
made
him
turn
*NL*
over
and
wake
some
more
of
the
gang
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
finally
I
did
get
my
last
iron
off
,
and
was
a
free
man
once
*NL*
more
.
I
took
a
good
breath
of
relief
,
and
reached
for
the
king
's
*NL*
irons
.
Too
late
!
in
comes
the
master
,
with
a
light
in
one
hand
*NL*
and
his
heavy
walking-staff
in
the
other
.
I
snuggled
close
among
*NL*
the
wallow
of
snorers
,
to
conceal
as
nearly
as
possible
that
I
was
*NL*
naked
of
irons
;
and
I
kept
a
sharp
lookout
and
prepared
to
spring
*NL*
for
my
man
the
moment
he
should
bend
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
n't
approach
.
He
stopped
,
gazed
absently
toward
our
*NL*
dusky
mass
a
minute
,
evidently
thinking
about
something
else
;
*NL*
then
set
down
his
light
,
moved
musingly
toward
the
door
,
and
before
*NL*
a
body
could
imagine
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
he
was
out
of
the
*NL*
door
and
had
closed
it
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
''
said
the
king
.
``
Fetch
him
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
was
the
thing
to
do
,
and
I
was
up
and
out
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
But
,
dear
me
,
there
were
no
lamps
in
those
days
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
dark
night
.
But
I
glimpsed
a
dim
figure
a
few
steps
*NL*
away
.
I
darted
for
it
,
threw
myself
upon
it
,
and
then
there
was
*NL*
a
state
of
things
and
lively
!
We
fought
and
scuffled
and
struggled
,
*NL*
and
drew
a
crowd
in
no
time
.
They
took
an
immense
interest
in
*NL*
the
fight
and
encouraged
us
all
they
could
,
and
,
in
fact
,
could
n't
*NL*
have
been
pleasanter
or
more
cordial
if
it
had
been
their
own
*NL*
fight
.
Then
a
tremendous
row
broke
out
behind
us
,
and
as
much
*NL*
as
half
of
our
audience
left
us
,
with
a
rush
,
to
invest
some
*NL*
sympathy
in
that
.
Lanterns
began
to
swing
in
all
directions
;
*NL*
it
was
the
watch
gathering
from
far
and
near
.
Presently
a
halberd
*NL*
fell
across
my
back
,
as
a
reminder
,
and
I
knew
what
it
meant
.
*NL*
I
was
in
custody
.
So
was
my
adversary
.
We
were
marched
off
toward
*NL*
prison
,
one
on
each
side
of
the
watchman
.
Here
was
disaster
,
*NL*
here
was
a
fine
scheme
gone
to
sudden
destruction
!
I
tried
to
*NL*
imagine
what
would
happen
when
the
master
should
discover
that
*NL*
it
was
I
who
had
been
fighting
him
;
and
what
would
happen
if
they
*NL*
jailed
us
together
in
the
general
apartment
for
brawlers
and
petty
*NL*
law-breakers
,
as
was
the
custom
;
and
what
might
--
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
my
antagonist
turned
his
face
around
in
my
direction
,
*NL*
the
freckled
light
from
the
watchman
's
tin
lantern
fell
on
it
,
*NL*
and
,
by
George
,
he
was
the
wrong
man
!

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
AN
AWFUL
PREDICAMENT
*NL*
*NL*
Sleep
?
It
was
impossible
.
It
would
naturally
have
been
impossible
*NL*
in
that
noisome
cavern
of
a
jail
,
with
its
mangy
crowd
of
drunken
,
*NL*
quarrelsome
,
and
song-singing
rapscallions
.
But
the
thing
that
*NL*
made
sleep
all
the
more
a
thing
not
to
be
dreamed
of
,
was
my
*NL*
racking
impatience
to
get
out
of
this
place
and
find
out
the
whole
*NL*
size
of
what
might
have
happened
yonder
in
the
slave-quarters
*NL*
in
consequence
of
that
intolerable
miscarriage
of
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
night
,
but
the
morning
got
around
at
last
.
I
made
*NL*
a
full
and
frank
explanation
to
the
court
.
I
said
I
was
a
slave
,
*NL*
the
property
of
the
great
Earl
Grip
,
who
had
arrived
just
after
*NL*
dark
at
the
Tabard
inn
in
the
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
water
,
and
had
stopped
there
over
night
,
by
compulsion
,
he
being
*NL*
taken
deadly
sick
with
a
strange
and
sudden
disorder
.
I
had
been
*NL*
ordered
to
cross
to
the
city
in
all
haste
and
bring
the
best
*NL*
physician
;
I
was
doing
my
best
;
naturally
I
was
running
with
all
*NL*
my
might
;
the
night
was
dark
,
I
ran
against
this
common
person
*NL*
here
,
who
seized
me
by
the
throat
and
began
to
pummel
me
,
although
*NL*
I
told
him
my
errand
,
and
implored
him
,
for
the
sake
of
the
great
*NL*
earl
my
master
's
mortal
peril
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
common
person
interrupted
and
said
it
was
a
lie
;
and
was
going
*NL*
to
explain
how
I
rushed
upon
him
and
attacked
him
without
a
word
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
sirrah
!
''
from
the
court
.
``
Take
him
hence
and
give
him
*NL*
a
few
stripes
whereby
to
teach
him
how
to
treat
the
servant
of
*NL*
a
nobleman
after
a
different
fashion
another
time
.
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
court
begged
my
pardon
,
and
hoped
I
would
not
fail
*NL*
to
tell
his
lordship
it
was
in
no
wise
the
court
's
fault
that
this
*NL*
high-handed
thing
had
happened
.
I
said
I
would
make
it
all
right
,
*NL*
and
so
took
my
leave
.
Took
it
just
in
time
,
too
;
he
was
starting
*NL*
to
ask
me
why
I
did
n't
fetch
out
these
facts
the
moment
I
was
*NL*
arrested
.
I
said
I
would
if
I
had
thought
of
it
--
which
was
true
*NL*
--
but
that
I
was
so
battered
by
that
man
that
all
my
wit
was
knocked
*NL*
out
of
me
--
and
so
forth
and
so
on
,
and
got
myself
away
,
still
*NL*
mumbling
.
I
did
n't
wait
for
breakfast
.
No
grass
grew
under
my
*NL*
feet
.
I
was
soon
at
the
slave
quarters
.
Empty
--
everybody
gone
!
*NL*
That
is
,
everybody
except
one
body
--
the
slave-master
's
.
It
lay
*NL*
there
all
battered
to
pulp
;
and
all
about
were
the
evidences
of
*NL*
a
terrific
fight
.
There
was
a
rude
board
coffin
on
a
cart
at
*NL*
the
door
,
and
workmen
,
assisted
by
the
police
,
were
thinning
a
*NL*
road
through
the
gaping
crowd
in
order
that
they
might
bring
it
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
picked
out
a
man
humble
enough
in
life
to
condescend
to
talk
*NL*
with
one
so
shabby
as
I
,
and
got
his
account
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
sixteen
slaves
here
.
They
rose
against
their
master
*NL*
in
the
night
,
and
thou
seest
how
it
ended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
How
did
it
begin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
witness
but
the
slaves
.
They
said
the
slave
that
*NL*
was
most
valuable
got
free
of
his
bonds
and
escaped
in
some
strange
*NL*
way
--
by
magic
arts
't
was
thought
,
by
reason
that
he
had
no
key
,
*NL*
and
the
locks
were
neither
broke
nor
in
any
wise
injured
.
When
*NL*
the
master
discovered
his
loss
,
he
was
mad
with
despair
,
and
threw
*NL*
himself
upon
his
people
with
his
heavy
stick
,
who
resisted
and
*NL*
brake
his
back
and
in
other
and
divers
ways
did
give
him
hurts
*NL*
that
brought
him
swiftly
to
his
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
dreadful
.
It
will
go
hard
with
the
slaves
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
upon
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
the
trial
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
they
be
a
week
,
think
you
--
and
the
matter
so
simple
?
They
*NL*
were
not
the
half
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
see
how
they
could
determine
which
were
the
guilty
*NL*
ones
in
so
short
a
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Which
_
ones
?
Indeed
,
they
considered
not
particulars
like
to
that
.
*NL*
They
condemned
them
in
a
body
.
Wit
ye
not
the
law
?
--
which
men
*NL*
say
the
Romans
left
behind
them
here
when
they
went
--
that
if
one
*NL*
slave
killeth
his
master
all
the
slaves
of
that
man
must
die
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
I
had
forgotten
.
And
when
will
these
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belike
within
a
four
and
twenty
hours
;
albeit
some
say
they
will
*NL*
wait
a
pair
of
days
more
,
if
peradventure
they
may
find
the
missing
*NL*
one
meantime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
missing
one
!
It
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
likely
they
will
find
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
the
day
is
spent
--
yes
.
They
seek
him
everywhere
.
They
*NL*
stand
at
the
gates
of
the
town
,
with
certain
of
the
slaves
who
*NL*
will
discover
him
to
them
if
he
cometh
,
and
none
can
pass
out
*NL*
but
he
will
be
first
examined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
one
see
the
place
where
the
rest
are
confined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
outside
of
it
--
yes
.
The
inside
of
it
--
but
ye
will
not
want
*NL*
to
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
the
address
of
that
prison
for
future
reference
and
then
*NL*
sauntered
off
.
At
the
first
second-hand
clothing
shop
I
came
to
,
*NL*
up
a
back
street
,
I
got
a
rough
rig
suitable
for
a
common
seaman
*NL*
who
might
be
going
on
a
cold
voyage
,
and
bound
up
my
face
with
*NL*
a
liberal
bandage
,
saying
I
had
a
toothache
.
This
concealed
my
*NL*
worst
bruises
.
It
was
a
transformation
.
I
no
longer
resembled
my
*NL*
former
self
.
Then
I
struck
out
for
that
wire
,
found
it
and
*NL*
followed
it
to
its
den
.
It
was
a
little
room
over
a
butcher
's
*NL*
shop
--
which
meant
that
business
was
n't
very
brisk
in
the
telegraphic
*NL*
line
.
The
young
chap
in
charge
was
drowsing
at
his
table
.
I
locked
*NL*
the
door
and
put
the
vast
key
in
my
bosom
.
This
alarmed
the
young
*NL*
fellow
,
and
he
was
going
to
make
a
noise
;
but
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
your
wind
;
if
you
open
your
mouth
you
are
dead
,
sure
.
Tackle
*NL*
your
instrument
.
Lively
,
now
!
Call
Camelot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
doth
amaze
me
!
How
should
such
as
you
know
aught
of
such
*NL*
matters
as
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
Camelot
!
I
am
a
desperate
man
.
Call
Camelot
,
or
get
away
*NL*
from
the
instrument
and
I
will
do
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
certainly
.
Stop
gabbling
.
Call
the
palace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
the
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
call
Clarence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clarence
_
who
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
Clarence
who
.
Say
you
want
Clarence
;
you
'll
get
*NL*
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
so
.
We
waited
five
nerve-straining
minutes
--
ten
minutes
*NL*
--
how
long
it
did
seem
!
--
and
then
came
a
click
that
was
as
familiar
*NL*
to
me
as
a
human
voice
;
for
Clarence
had
been
my
own
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
lad
,
vacate
!
They
would
have
known
_
my
_
touch
,
maybe
,
*NL*
and
so
your
call
was
surest
;
but
I
'm
all
right
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
vacated
the
place
and
cocked
his
ear
to
listen
--
but
it
did
n't
*NL*
win
.
I
used
a
cipher
.
I
did
n't
waste
any
time
in
sociabilities
*NL*
with
Clarence
,
but
squared
away
for
business
,
straight-off
--
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
is
here
and
in
danger
.
We
were
captured
and
brought
*NL*
here
as
slaves
.
We
should
not
be
able
to
prove
our
identity
*NL*
--
and
the
fact
is
,
I
am
not
in
a
position
to
try
.
Send
a
telegram
*NL*
for
the
palace
here
which
will
carry
conviction
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
answer
came
straight
back
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
know
anything
about
the
telegraph
;
they
have
n't
had
*NL*
any
experience
yet
,
the
line
to
London
is
so
new
.
Better
not
*NL*
venture
that
.
They
might
hang
you
.
Think
up
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Might
hang
us
!
Little
he
knew
how
closely
he
was
crowding
the
*NL*
facts
.
I
could
n't
think
up
anything
for
the
moment
.
Then
an
idea
*NL*
struck
me
,
and
I
started
it
along
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
five
hundred
picked
knights
with
Launcelot
in
the
lead
;
and
*NL*
send
them
on
the
jump
.
Let
them
enter
by
the
southwest
gate
,
and
*NL*
look
out
for
the
man
with
a
white
cloth
around
his
right
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
prompt
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
shall
start
in
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Clarence
;
now
tell
this
lad
here
that
I
'm
a
friend
*NL*
of
yours
and
a
dead-head
;
and
that
he
must
be
discreet
and
say
*NL*
nothing
about
this
visit
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
instrument
began
to
talk
to
the
youth
and
I
hurried
away
.
*NL*
I
fell
to
ciphering
.
In
half
an
hour
it
would
be
nine
o'clock
.
*NL*
Knights
and
horses
in
heavy
armor
could
n't
travel
very
fast
.
*NL*
These
would
make
the
best
time
they
could
,
and
now
that
the
ground
*NL*
was
in
good
condition
,
and
no
snow
or
mud
,
they
would
probably
*NL*
make
a
seven-mile
gait
;
they
would
have
to
change
horses
a
couple
*NL*
of
times
;
they
would
arrive
about
six
,
or
a
little
after
;
it
would
*NL*
still
be
plenty
light
enough
;
they
would
see
the
white
cloth
which
*NL*
I
should
tie
around
my
right
arm
,
and
I
would
take
command
.
We
*NL*
would
surround
that
prison
and
have
the
king
out
in
no
time
.
*NL*
It
would
be
showy
and
picturesque
enough
,
all
things
considered
,
*NL*
though
I
would
have
preferred
noonday
,
on
account
of
the
more
*NL*
theatrical
aspect
the
thing
would
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
then
,
in
order
to
increase
the
strings
to
my
bow
,
I
thought
*NL*
I
would
look
up
some
of
those
people
whom
I
had
formerly
recognized
,
*NL*
and
make
myself
known
.
That
would
help
us
out
of
our
scrape
,
*NL*
without
the
knights
.
But
I
must
proceed
cautiously
,
for
it
was
*NL*
a
risky
business
.
I
must
get
into
sumptuous
raiment
,
and
it
*NL*
would
n't
do
to
run
and
jump
into
it
.
No
,
I
must
work
up
to
it
*NL*
by
degrees
,
buying
suit
after
suit
of
clothes
,
in
shops
wide
apart
,
*NL*
and
getting
a
little
finer
article
with
each
change
,
until
I
should
*NL*
finally
reach
silk
and
velvet
,
and
be
ready
for
my
project
.
So
*NL*
I
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
scheme
fell
through
like
scat
!
The
first
corner
I
turned
,
*NL*
I
came
plump
upon
one
of
our
slaves
,
snooping
around
with
a
watchman
.
*NL*
I
coughed
at
the
moment
,
and
he
gave
me
a
sudden
look
that
bit
right
*NL*
into
my
marrow
.
I
judge
he
thought
he
had
heard
that
cough
before
.
*NL*
I
turned
immediately
into
a
shop
and
worked
along
down
the
counter
,
*NL*
pricing
things
and
watching
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
.
Those
*NL*
people
had
stopped
,
and
were
talking
together
and
looking
in
at
*NL*
the
door
.
I
made
up
my
mind
to
get
out
the
back
way
,
if
there
*NL*
was
a
back
way
,
and
I
asked
the
shopwoman
if
I
could
step
out
*NL*
there
and
look
for
the
escaped
slave
,
who
was
believed
to
be
in
*NL*
hiding
back
there
somewhere
,
and
said
I
was
an
officer
in
disguise
,
*NL*
and
my
pard
was
yonder
at
the
door
with
one
of
the
murderers
in
*NL*
charge
,
and
would
she
be
good
enough
to
step
there
and
tell
him
*NL*
he
need
n't
wait
,
but
had
better
go
at
once
to
the
further
end
of
*NL*
the
back
alley
and
be
ready
to
head
him
off
when
I
rousted
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
blazing
with
eagerness
to
see
one
of
those
already
celebrated
*NL*
murderers
,
and
she
started
on
the
errand
at
once
.
I
slipped
out
*NL*
the
back
way
,
locked
the
door
behind
me
,
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
*NL*
and
started
off
,
chuckling
to
myself
and
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
I
had
gone
and
spoiled
it
again
,
made
another
mistake
.
*NL*
A
double
one
,
in
fact
.
There
were
plenty
of
ways
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
that
officer
by
some
simple
and
plausible
device
,
but
no
,
I
must
*NL*
pick
out
a
picturesque
one
;
it
is
the
crying
defect
of
my
character
.
*NL*
And
then
,
I
had
ordered
my
procedure
upon
what
the
officer
,
being
*NL*
human
,
would
_
naturally
_
do
;
whereas
when
you
are
least
expecting
it
,
*NL*
a
man
will
now
and
then
go
and
do
the
very
thing
which
it
's
_
not
_
*NL*
natural
for
him
to
do
.
The
natural
thing
for
the
officer
to
do
,
*NL*
in
this
case
,
was
to
follow
straight
on
my
heels
;
he
would
find
*NL*
a
stout
oaken
door
,
securely
locked
,
between
him
and
me
;
before
*NL*
he
could
break
it
down
,
I
should
be
far
away
and
engaged
in
slipping
*NL*
into
a
succession
of
baffling
disguises
which
would
soon
get
me
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
raiment
which
was
a
surer
protection
from
meddling
*NL*
law-dogs
in
Britain
than
any
amount
of
mere
innocence
and
purity
*NL*
of
character
.
But
instead
of
doing
the
natural
thing
,
the
officer
*NL*
took
me
at
my
word
,
and
followed
my
instructions
.
And
so
,
as
I
*NL*
came
trotting
out
of
that
cul
de
sac
,
full
of
satisfaction
with
my
*NL*
own
cleverness
,
he
turned
the
corner
and
I
walked
right
into
his
*NL*
handcuffs
.
If
I
had
known
it
was
a
cul
de
sac
--
however
,
there
*NL*
is
n't
any
excusing
a
blunder
like
that
,
let
it
go
.
Charge
it
up
*NL*
to
profit
and
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
was
indignant
,
and
swore
I
had
just
come
ashore
from
*NL*
a
long
voyage
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
--
just
to
see
,
you
know
,
*NL*
if
it
would
deceive
that
slave
.
But
it
did
n't
.
He
knew
me
.
Then
*NL*
I
reproached
him
for
betraying
me
.
He
was
more
surprised
than
*NL*
hurt
.
He
stretched
his
eyes
wide
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
wouldst
have
me
let
thee
,
of
all
men
,
escape
and
not
hang
*NL*
with
us
,
when
thou
`
rt
the
very
_
cause
_
of
our
hanging
?
Go
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
''
was
their
way
of
saying
``
I
should
smile
!
''
or
``
I
like
that
!
''
*NL*
Queer
talkers
,
those
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
there
was
a
sort
of
bastard
justice
in
his
view
of
the
case
,
*NL*
and
so
I
dropped
the
matter
.
When
you
ca
n't
cure
a
disaster
by
*NL*
argument
,
what
is
the
use
to
argue
?
It
is
n't
my
way
.
So
I
only
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
going
to
be
hanged
.
None
of
us
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
men
laughed
,
and
the
slave
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
not
ranked
as
a
fool
--
before
.
You
might
better
keep
*NL*
your
reputation
,
seeing
the
strain
would
not
be
for
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
stand
it
,
I
reckon
.
Before
to-morrow
we
shall
be
out
*NL*
of
prison
,
and
free
to
go
where
we
will
,
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
witty
officer
lifted
at
his
left
ear
with
his
thumb
,
made
*NL*
a
rasping
noise
in
his
throat
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
prison
--
yes
--
ye
say
true
.
And
free
likewise
to
go
where
*NL*
ye
will
,
so
ye
wander
not
out
of
his
grace
the
Devil
's
sultry
realm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
my
temper
,
and
said
,
indifferently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
suppose
you
really
think
we
are
going
to
hang
within
*NL*
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
not
many
minutes
ago
,
for
so
the
thing
was
decided
*NL*
and
proclaimed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
you
've
changed
your
mind
,
is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
that
.
I
only
_
thought
_
,
then
;
I
_
know
_
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
sarcastical
,
so
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sapient
servant
of
the
law
,
condescend
to
tell
us
,
then
,
*NL*
what
you
_
know
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ye
will
all
be
hanged
_
to-day
_
,
at
mid-afternoon
!
Oho
!
that
*NL*
shot
hit
home
!
Lean
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
I
did
need
to
lean
upon
somebody
.
My
knights
could
n't
*NL*
arrive
in
time
.
They
would
be
as
much
as
three
hours
too
late
.
*NL*
Nothing
in
the
world
could
save
the
King
of
England
;
nor
me
,
which
*NL*
was
more
important
.
More
important
,
not
merely
to
me
,
but
to
*NL*
the
nation
--
the
only
nation
on
earth
standing
ready
to
blossom
*NL*
into
civilization
.
I
was
sick
.
I
said
no
more
,
there
was
n't
*NL*
anything
to
say
.
I
knew
what
the
man
meant
;
that
if
the
missing
*NL*
slave
was
found
,
the
postponement
would
be
revoked
,
the
execution
*NL*
take
place
to-day
.
Well
,
the
missing
slave
was
found
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
SIR
LAUNCELOT
AND
KNIGHTS
TO
THE
RESCUE
*NL*
*NL*
Nearing
four
in
the
afternoon
.
The
scene
was
just
outside
the
*NL*
walls
of
London
.
A
cool
,
comfortable
,
superb
day
,
with
a
brilliant
*NL*
sun
;
the
kind
of
day
to
make
one
want
to
live
,
not
die
.
The
*NL*
multitude
was
prodigious
and
far-reaching
;
and
yet
we
fifteen
*NL*
poor
devils
had
n't
a
friend
in
it
.
There
was
something
painful
*NL*
in
that
thought
,
look
at
it
how
you
might
.
There
we
sat
,
on
our
*NL*
tall
scaffold
,
the
butt
of
the
hate
and
mockery
of
all
those
*NL*
enemies
.
We
were
being
made
a
holiday
spectacle
.
They
had
built
*NL*
a
sort
of
grand
stand
for
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
and
these
were
*NL*
there
in
full
force
,
with
their
ladies
.
We
recognized
a
good
*NL*
many
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
got
a
brief
and
unexpected
dash
of
diversion
out
of
*NL*
the
king
.
The
moment
we
were
freed
of
our
bonds
he
sprang
up
,
*NL*
in
his
fantastic
rags
,
with
face
bruised
out
of
all
recognition
,
and
*NL*
proclaimed
himself
Arthur
,
King
of
Britain
,
and
denounced
the
*NL*
awful
penalties
of
treason
upon
every
soul
there
present
if
hair
*NL*
of
his
sacred
head
were
touched
.
It
startled
and
surprised
him
*NL*
to
hear
them
break
into
a
vast
roar
of
laughter
.
It
wounded
his
*NL*
dignity
,
and
he
locked
himself
up
in
silence
.
Then
,
although
*NL*
the
crowd
begged
him
to
go
on
,
and
tried
to
provoke
him
to
it
*NL*
by
catcalls
,
jeers
,
and
shouts
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
speak
!
The
king
!
The
king
!
his
humble
subjects
hunger
*NL*
and
thirst
for
words
of
wisdom
out
of
the
mouth
of
their
master
*NL*
his
Serene
and
Sacred
Raggedness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
went
for
nothing
.
He
put
on
all
his
majesty
and
sat
under
*NL*
this
rain
of
contempt
and
insult
unmoved
.
He
certainly
was
great
*NL*
in
his
way
.
Absently
,
I
had
taken
off
my
white
bandage
and
wound
*NL*
it
about
my
right
arm
.
When
the
crowd
noticed
this
,
they
began
*NL*
upon
me
.
They
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
this
sailor-man
is
his
minister
--
observe
his
costly
*NL*
badge
of
office
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
let
them
go
on
until
they
got
tired
,
and
then
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
his
minister
,
The
Boss
;
and
to-morrow
you
will
hear
*NL*
that
from
Camelot
which
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
no
further
.
They
drowned
me
out
with
joyous
derision
.
But
*NL*
presently
there
was
silence
;
for
the
sheriffs
of
London
,
in
their
*NL*
official
robes
,
with
their
subordinates
,
began
to
make
a
stir
which
*NL*
indicated
that
business
was
about
to
begin
.
In
the
hush
which
*NL*
followed
,
our
crime
was
recited
,
the
death
warrant
read
,
then
*NL*
everybody
uncovered
while
a
priest
uttered
a
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
slave
was
blindfolded
;
the
hangman
unslung
his
rope
.
There
*NL*
lay
the
smooth
road
below
us
,
we
upon
one
side
of
it
,
the
banked
*NL*
multitude
wailing
its
other
side
--
a
good
clear
road
,
and
kept
free
*NL*
by
the
police
--
how
good
it
would
be
to
see
my
five
hundred
horsemen
*NL*
come
tearing
down
it
!
But
no
,
it
was
out
of
the
possibilities
.
*NL*
I
followed
its
receding
thread
out
into
the
distance
--
not
a
horseman
*NL*
on
it
,
or
sign
of
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
jerk
,
and
the
slave
hung
dangling
;
dangling
and
hideously
*NL*
squirming
,
for
his
limbs
were
not
tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
rope
was
unslung
,
in
a
moment
another
slave
was
dangling
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
minute
a
third
slave
was
struggling
in
the
air
.
It
was
*NL*
dreadful
.
I
turned
away
my
head
a
moment
,
and
when
I
turned
back
*NL*
I
missed
the
king
!
They
were
blindfolding
him
!
I
was
paralyzed
;
*NL*
I
could
n't
move
,
I
was
choking
,
my
tongue
was
petrified
.
They
*NL*
finished
blindfolding
him
,
they
led
him
under
the
rope
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
shake
off
that
clinging
impotence
.
But
when
I
saw
them
put
the
*NL*
noose
around
his
neck
,
then
everything
let
go
in
me
and
I
made
*NL*
a
spring
to
the
rescue
--
and
as
I
made
it
I
shot
one
more
glance
*NL*
abroad
--
by
George
!
here
they
came
,
a-tilting
!
--
five
hundred
mailed
*NL*
and
belted
knights
on
bicycles
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandest
sight
that
ever
was
seen
.
Lord
,
how
the
plumes
*NL*
streamed
,
how
the
sun
flamed
and
flashed
from
the
endless
procession
*NL*
of
webby
wheels
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
waved
my
right
arm
as
Launcelot
swept
in
--
he
recognized
my
rag
*NL*
--
I
tore
away
noose
and
bandage
,
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
knees
,
every
rascal
of
you
,
and
salute
the
king
!
Who
*NL*
fails
shall
sup
in
hell
to-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
always
use
that
high
style
when
I
'm
climaxing
an
effect
.
Well
,
*NL*
it
was
noble
to
see
Launcelot
and
the
boys
swarm
up
onto
that
*NL*
scaffold
and
heave
sheriffs
and
such
overboard
.
And
it
was
fine
*NL*
to
see
that
astonished
multitude
go
down
on
their
knees
and
beg
*NL*
their
lives
of
the
king
they
had
just
been
deriding
and
insulting
.
*NL*
And
as
he
stood
apart
there
,
receiving
this
homage
in
rags
,
*NL*
I
thought
to
myself
,
well
,
really
there
is
something
peculiarly
*NL*
grand
about
the
gait
and
bearing
of
a
king
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
immensely
satisfied
.
Take
the
whole
situation
all
around
,
*NL*
it
was
one
of
the
gaudiest
effects
I
ever
instigated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
presently
up
comes
Clarence
,
his
own
self
!
and
winks
,
and
*NL*
says
,
very
modernly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
deal
of
a
surprise
,
was
n't
it
?
I
knew
you
'd
like
it
.
I
've
*NL*
had
the
boys
practicing
this
long
time
,
privately
;
and
just
hungry
*NL*
for
a
chance
to
show
off
.

*NL*
*NL*
THE
YANKEE
'S
FIGHT
WITH
THE
KNIGHTS
*NL*
*NL*
Home
again
,
at
Camelot
.
A
morning
or
two
later
I
found
the
paper
,
*NL*
damp
from
the
press
,
by
my
plate
at
the
breakfast
table
.
I
turned
*NL*
to
the
advertising
columns
,
knowing
I
should
find
something
of
*NL*
personal
interest
to
me
there
.
It
was
this
:

The

*NL*
will

sith
the

*NL*

Clarence

this

*NL*

new
law
,
whidh

*NL*
combatant
to

You
may
want
to
make
a
note
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
the
day
set
,
there
was
no
talk
in
all
Britain
of
anything
*NL*
but
this
combat
.
All
other
topics
sank
into
insignificance
and
*NL*
passed
out
of
men
's
thoughts
and
interest
.
It
was
not
because
*NL*
a
tournament
was
a
great
matter
,
it
was
not
because
Sir
Sagramor
*NL*
had
found
the
Holy
Grail
,
for
he
had
not
,
but
had
failed
;
it
was
*NL*
not
because
the
second
-LRB-
official
-RRB-
personage
in
the
kingdom
was
*NL*
one
of
the
duellists
;
no
,
all
these
features
were
commonplace
.
*NL*
Yet
there
was
abundant
reason
for
the
extraordinary
interest
which
*NL*
this
coming
fight
was
creating
.
It
was
born
of
the
fact
that
all
*NL*
the
nation
knew
that
this
was
not
to
be
a
duel
between
mere
men
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
but
a
duel
between
two
mighty
magicians
;
a
duel
not
*NL*
of
muscle
but
of
mind
,
not
of
human
skill
but
of
superhuman
art
*NL*
and
craft
;
a
final
struggle
for
supremacy
between
the
two
master
*NL*
enchanters
of
the
age
.
It
was
realized
that
the
most
prodigious
*NL*
achievements
of
the
most
renowned
knights
could
not
be
worthy
*NL*
of
comparison
with
a
spectacle
like
this
;
they
could
be
but
child
's
*NL*
play
,
contrasted
with
this
mysterious
and
awful
battle
of
the
gods
.
*NL*
Yes
,
all
the
world
knew
it
was
going
to
be
in
reality
a
duel
*NL*
between
Merlin
and
me
,
a
measuring
of
his
magic
powers
against
*NL*
mine
.
It
was
known
that
Merlin
had
been
busy
whole
days
and
nights
*NL*
together
,
imbuing
Sir
Sagramor
's
arms
and
armor
with
supernal
*NL*
powers
of
offense
and
defense
,
and
that
he
had
procured
for
him
*NL*
from
the
spirits
of
the
air
a
fleecy
veil
which
would
render
the
*NL*
wearer
invisible
to
his
antagonist
while
still
visible
to
other
*NL*
men
.
Against
Sir
Sagramor
,
so
weaponed
and
protected
,
a
thousand
*NL*
knights
could
accomplish
nothing
;
against
him
no
known
enchantments
*NL*
could
prevail
.
These
facts
were
sure
;
regarding
them
there
was
*NL*
no
doubt
,
no
reason
for
doubt
.
There
was
but
one
question
:
might
*NL*
there
be
still
other
enchantments
,
_
unknown
_
to
Merlin
,
which
could
*NL*
render
Sir
Sagramor
's
veil
transparent
to
me
,
and
make
his
enchanted
*NL*
mail
vulnerable
to
my
weapons
?
This
was
the
one
thing
to
be
*NL*
decided
in
the
lists
.
Until
then
the
world
must
remain
in
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
world
thought
there
was
a
vast
matter
at
stake
here
,
and
*NL*
the
world
was
right
,
but
it
was
not
the
one
they
had
in
their
*NL*
minds
.
No
,
a
far
vaster
one
was
upon
the
cast
of
this
die
:
*NL*
_
the
life
of
knight-errantry
_
.
I
was
a
champion
,
it
was
true
,
but
*NL*
not
the
champion
of
the
frivolous
black
arts
,
I
was
the
champion
*NL*
of
hard
unsentimental
common-sense
and
reason
.
I
was
entering
*NL*
the
lists
to
either
destroy
knight-errantry
or
be
its
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vast
as
the
show-grounds
were
,
there
were
no
vacant
spaces
in
them
*NL*
outside
of
the
lists
,
at
ten
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
16th
.
*NL*
The
mammoth
grand-stand
was
clothed
in
flags
,
streamers
,
and
rich
*NL*
tapestries
,
and
packed
with
several
acres
of
small-fry
tributary
*NL*
kings
,
their
suites
,
and
the
British
aristocracy
;
with
our
own
*NL*
royal
gang
in
the
chief
place
,
and
each
and
every
individual
*NL*
a
flashing
prism
of
gaudy
silks
and
velvets
--
well
,
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
to
begin
with
it
but
a
fight
between
an
Upper
Mississippi
*NL*
sunset
and
the
aurora
borealis
.
The
huge
camp
of
beflagged
and
*NL*
gay-colored
tents
at
one
end
of
the
lists
,
with
a
stiff-standing
*NL*
sentinel
at
every
door
and
a
shining
shield
hanging
by
him
for
*NL*
challenge
,
was
another
fine
sight
.
You
see
,
every
knight
was
*NL*
there
who
had
any
ambition
or
any
caste
feeling
;
for
my
feeling
*NL*
toward
their
order
was
not
much
of
a
secret
,
and
so
here
was
their
*NL*
chance
.
If
I
won
my
fight
with
Sir
Sagramor
,
others
would
have
*NL*
the
right
to
call
me
out
as
long
as
I
might
be
willing
to
respond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
at
our
end
there
were
but
two
tents
;
one
for
me
,
and
another
*NL*
for
my
servants
.
At
the
appointed
hour
the
king
made
a
sign
,
and
*NL*
the
heralds
,
in
their
tabards
,
appeared
and
made
proclamation
,
*NL*
naming
the
combatants
and
stating
the
cause
of
quarrel
.
There
*NL*
was
a
pause
,
then
a
ringing
bugle-blast
,
which
was
the
signal
for
*NL*
us
to
come
forth
.
All
the
multitude
caught
their
breath
,
and
*NL*
an
eager
curiosity
flashed
into
every
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
from
his
tent
rode
great
Sir
Sagramor
,
an
imposing
tower
*NL*
of
iron
,
stately
and
rigid
,
his
huge
spear
standing
upright
in
its
*NL*
socket
and
grasped
in
his
strong
hand
,
his
grand
horse
's
face
and
*NL*
breast
cased
in
steel
,
his
body
clothed
in
rich
trappings
that
*NL*
almost
dragged
the
ground
--
oh
,
a
most
noble
picture
.
A
great
*NL*
shout
went
up
,
of
welcome
and
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
out
I
came
.
But
I
did
n't
get
any
shout
.
There
was
*NL*
a
wondering
and
eloquent
silence
for
a
moment
,
then
a
great
wave
*NL*
of
laughter
began
to
sweep
along
that
human
sea
,
but
a
warning
*NL*
bugle-blast
cut
its
career
short
.
I
was
in
the
simplest
and
*NL*
comfortablest
of
gymnast
costumes
--
flesh-colored
tights
from
neck
*NL*
to
heel
,
with
blue
silk
puffings
about
my
loins
,
and
bareheaded
.
*NL*
My
horse
was
not
above
medium
size
,
but
he
was
alert
,
slender-limbed
,
*NL*
muscled
with
watchsprings
,
and
just
a
greyhound
to
go
.
He
was
*NL*
a
beauty
,
glossy
as
silk
,
and
naked
as
he
was
when
he
was
born
,
*NL*
except
for
bridle
and
ranger-saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
iron
tower
and
the
gorgeous
bedquilt
came
cumbrously
but
*NL*
gracefully
pirouetting
down
the
lists
,
and
we
tripped
lightly
up
*NL*
to
meet
them
.
We
halted
;
the
tower
saluted
,
I
responded
;
then
*NL*
we
wheeled
and
rode
side
by
side
to
the
grand-stand
and
faced
*NL*
our
king
and
queen
,
to
whom
we
made
obeisance
.
The
queen
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alack
,
Sir
Boss
,
wilt
fight
naked
,
and
without
lance
or
sword
or
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
king
checked
her
and
made
her
understand
,
with
a
polite
*NL*
phrase
or
two
,
that
this
was
none
of
her
business
.
The
bugles
*NL*
rang
again
;
and
we
separated
and
rode
to
the
ends
of
the
lists
,
*NL*
and
took
position
.
Now
old
Merlin
stepped
into
view
and
cast
*NL*
a
dainty
web
of
gossamer
threads
over
Sir
Sagramor
which
turned
*NL*
him
into
Hamlet
's
ghost
;
the
king
made
a
sign
,
the
bugles
blew
,
*NL*
Sir
Sagramor
laid
his
great
lance
in
rest
,
and
the
next
moment
here
*NL*
he
came
thundering
down
the
course
with
his
veil
flying
out
behind
,
*NL*
and
I
went
whistling
through
the
air
like
an
arrow
to
meet
him
*NL*
--
cocking
my
ear
the
while
,
as
if
noting
the
invisible
knight
's
*NL*
position
and
progress
by
hearing
,
not
sight
.
A
chorus
of
encouraging
*NL*
shouts
burst
out
for
him
,
and
one
brave
voice
flung
out
a
heartening
*NL*
word
for
me
--
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
it
,
slim
Jim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
even
bet
that
Clarence
had
procured
that
favor
for
me
*NL*
--
and
furnished
the
language
,
too
.
When
that
formidable
lance-point
*NL*
was
within
a
yard
and
a
half
of
my
breast
I
twitched
my
horse
aside
*NL*
without
an
effort
,
and
the
big
knight
swept
by
,
scoring
a
blank
.
*NL*
I
got
plenty
of
applause
that
time
.
We
turned
,
braced
up
,
and
*NL*
down
we
came
again
.
Another
blank
for
the
knight
,
a
roar
of
*NL*
applause
for
me
.
This
same
thing
was
repeated
once
more
;
and
*NL*
it
fetched
such
a
whirlwind
of
applause
that
Sir
Sagramor
lost
his
*NL*
temper
,
and
at
once
changed
his
tactics
and
set
himself
the
task
*NL*
of
chasing
me
down
.
Why
,
he
had
n't
any
show
in
the
world
at
that
;
*NL*
it
was
a
game
of
tag
,
with
all
the
advantage
on
my
side
;
I
whirled
*NL*
out
of
his
path
with
ease
whenever
I
chose
,
and
once
I
slapped
him
*NL*
on
the
back
as
I
went
to
the
rear
.
Finally
I
took
the
chase
into
*NL*
my
own
hands
;
and
after
that
,
turn
,
or
twist
,
or
do
what
he
would
,
*NL*
he
was
never
able
to
get
behind
me
again
;
he
found
himself
always
*NL*
in
front
at
the
end
of
his
maneuver
.
So
he
gave
up
that
business
*NL*
and
retired
to
his
end
of
the
lists
.
His
temper
was
clear
gone
now
,
*NL*
and
he
forgot
himself
and
flung
an
insult
at
me
which
disposed
*NL*
of
mine
.
I
slipped
my
lasso
from
the
horn
of
my
saddle
,
and
*NL*
grasped
the
coil
in
my
right
hand
.
This
time
you
should
have
seen
*NL*
him
come
!
--
it
was
a
business
trip
,
sure
;
by
his
gait
there
was
*NL*
blood
in
his
eye
.
I
was
sitting
my
horse
at
ease
,
and
swinging
*NL*
the
great
loop
of
my
lasso
in
wide
circles
about
my
head
;
the
*NL*
moment
he
was
under
way
,
I
started
for
him
;
when
the
space
between
*NL*
us
had
narrowed
to
forty
feet
,
I
sent
the
snaky
spirals
of
the
rope
*NL*
a-cleaving
through
the
air
,
then
darted
aside
and
faced
about
and
*NL*
brought
my
trained
animal
to
a
halt
with
all
his
feet
braced
under
*NL*
him
for
a
surge
.
The
next
moment
the
rope
sprang
taut
and
yanked
*NL*
Sir
Sagramor
out
of
the
saddle
!
Great
Scott
,
but
there
was
*NL*
a
sensation
!
*NL*
*NL*
Unquestionably
,
the
popular
thing
in
this
world
is
novelty
.
These
*NL*
people
had
never
seen
anything
of
that
cowboy
business
before
,
*NL*
and
it
carried
them
clear
off
their
feet
with
delight
.
From
all
*NL*
around
and
everywhere
,
the
shout
went
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Encore
!
encore
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
wondered
where
they
got
the
word
,
but
there
was
no
time
to
cipher
*NL*
on
philological
matters
,
because
the
whole
knight-errantry
hive
*NL*
was
just
humming
now
,
and
my
prospect
for
trade
could
n't
have
*NL*
been
better
.
The
moment
my
lasso
was
released
and
Sir
Sagramor
*NL*
had
been
assisted
to
his
tent
,
I
hauled
in
the
slack
,
took
my
*NL*
station
and
began
to
swing
my
loop
around
my
head
again
.
I
was
*NL*
sure
to
have
use
for
it
as
soon
as
they
could
elect
a
successor
*NL*
for
Sir
Sagramor
,
and
that
could
n't
take
long
where
there
were
*NL*
so
many
hungry
candidates
.
Indeed
,
they
elected
one
straight
off
*NL*
--
Sir
Hervis
de
Revel
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Bzz
_
!
Here
he
came
,
like
a
house
afire
;
I
dodged
:
he
passed
like
*NL*
a
flash
,
with
my
horse-hair
coils
settling
around
his
neck
;
*NL*
a
second
or
so
later
,
_
fst
_
!
his
saddle
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
another
encore
;
and
another
,
and
another
,
and
still
another
.
*NL*
When
I
had
snaked
five
men
out
,
things
began
to
look
serious
to
*NL*
the
ironclads
,
and
they
stopped
and
consulted
together
.
As
a
*NL*
result
,
they
decided
that
it
was
time
to
waive
etiquette
and
send
*NL*
their
greatest
and
best
against
me
.
To
the
astonishment
of
that
*NL*
little
world
,
I
lassoed
Sir
Lamorak
de
Galis
,
and
after
him
*NL*
Sir
Galahad
.
So
you
see
there
was
simply
nothing
to
be
done
now
,
*NL*
but
play
their
right
bower
--
bring
out
the
superbest
of
the
superb
,
*NL*
the
mightiest
of
the
mighty
,
the
great
Sir
Launcelot
himself
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
proud
moment
for
me
?
I
should
think
so
.
Yonder
was
Arthur
,
*NL*
King
of
Britain
;
yonder
was
Guenever
;
yes
,
and
whole
tribes
of
*NL*
little
provincial
kings
and
kinglets
;
and
in
the
tented
camp
yonder
,
*NL*
renowned
knights
from
many
lands
;
and
likewise
the
selectest
body
*NL*
known
to
chivalry
,
the
Knights
of
the
Table
Round
,
the
most
*NL*
illustrious
in
Christendom
;
and
biggest
fact
of
all
,
the
very
sun
*NL*
of
their
shining
system
was
yonder
couching
his
lance
,
the
focal
*NL*
point
of
forty
thousand
adoring
eyes
;
and
all
by
myself
,
here
was
*NL*
I
laying
for
him
.
Across
my
mind
flitted
the
dear
image
of
a
*NL*
certain
hello-girl
of
West
Hartford
,
and
I
wished
she
could
see
*NL*
me
now
.
In
that
moment
,
down
came
the
Invincible
,
with
the
rush
*NL*
of
a
whirlwind
--
the
courtly
world
rose
to
its
feet
and
bent
forward
*NL*
--
the
fateful
coils
went
circling
through
the
air
,
and
before
you
*NL*
could
wink
I
was
towing
Sir
Launcelot
across
the
field
on
his
*NL*
back
,
and
kissing
my
hand
to
the
storm
of
waving
kerchiefs
and
*NL*
the
thunder-crash
of
applause
that
greeted
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
Said
I
to
myself
,
as
I
coiled
my
lariat
and
hung
it
on
my
saddle-horn
,
*NL*
and
sat
there
drunk
with
glory
,
``
The
victory
is
perfect
--
no
other
*NL*
will
venture
against
me
--
knight-errantry
is
dead
.
''
Now
imagine
my
*NL*
astonishment
--
and
everybody
else
's
,
too
--
to
hear
the
peculiar
*NL*
bugle-call
which
announces
that
another
competitor
is
about
to
*NL*
enter
the
lists
!
There
was
a
mystery
here
;
I
could
n't
account
for
*NL*
this
thing
.
Next
,
I
noticed
Merlin
gliding
away
from
me
;
and
then
*NL*
I
noticed
that
my
lasso
was
gone
!
The
old
sleight-of-hand
expert
*NL*
had
stolen
it
,
sure
,
and
slipped
it
under
his
robe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bugle
blew
again
.
I
looked
,
and
down
came
Sagramor
riding
*NL*
again
,
with
his
dust
brushed
off
and
his
veil
nicely
re-arranged
.
*NL*
I
trotted
up
to
meet
him
,
and
pretended
to
find
him
by
the
sound
*NL*
of
his
horse
's
hoofs
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
`
rt
quick
of
ear
,
but
it
will
not
save
thee
from
this
!
''
and
*NL*
he
touched
the
hilt
of
his
great
sword
.
``
An
ye
are
not
able
to
see
*NL*
it
,
because
of
the
influence
of
the
veil
,
know
that
it
is
no
cumbrous
*NL*
lance
,
but
a
sword
--
and
I
ween
ye
will
not
be
able
to
avoid
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
visor
was
up
;
there
was
death
in
his
smile
.
I
should
never
*NL*
be
able
to
dodge
his
sword
,
that
was
plain
.
Somebody
was
going
*NL*
to
die
this
time
.
If
he
got
the
drop
on
me
,
I
could
name
the
*NL*
corpse
.
We
rode
forward
together
,
and
saluted
the
royalties
.
*NL*
This
time
the
king
was
disturbed
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
thy
strange
weapon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
stolen
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
another
at
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sire
,
I
brought
only
the
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Merlin
mixed
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
brought
but
the
one
because
there
was
but
the
one
to
bring
.
*NL*
There
exists
none
other
but
that
one
.
It
belongeth
to
the
king
*NL*
of
the
Demons
of
the
Sea
.
This
man
is
a
pretender
,
and
ignorant
,
*NL*
else
he
had
known
that
that
weapon
can
be
used
in
but
eight
bouts
*NL*
only
,
and
then
it
vanisheth
away
to
its
home
under
the
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
is
he
weaponless
,
''
said
the
king
.
``
Sir
Sagramore
,
ye
will
*NL*
grant
him
leave
to
borrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
will
lend
!
''
said
Sir
Launcelot
,
limping
up
.
``
He
is
as
*NL*
brave
a
knight
of
his
hands
as
any
that
be
on
live
,
and
he
shall
*NL*
have
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
on
his
sword
to
draw
it
,
but
Sir
Sagramor
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
it
may
not
be
.
He
shall
fight
with
his
own
weapons
;
it
*NL*
was
his
privilege
to
choose
them
and
bring
them
.
If
he
has
erred
,
*NL*
on
his
head
be
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knight
!
''
said
the
king
.
``
Thou
`
rt
overwrought
with
passion
;
it
*NL*
disorders
thy
mind
.
Wouldst
kill
a
naked
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
he
do
it
,
he
shall
answer
it
to
me
,
''
said
Sir
Launcelot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
answer
it
to
any
he
that
desireth
!
''
retorted
Sir
Sagramor
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Merlin
broke
in
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
his
lowdownest
*NL*
smile
of
malicious
gratification
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
said
,
right
well
said
!
And
't
is
enough
of
parleying
,
*NL*
let
my
lord
the
king
deliver
the
battle
signal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
had
to
yield
.
The
bugle
made
proclamation
,
and
we
turned
*NL*
apart
and
rode
to
our
stations
.
There
we
stood
,
a
hundred
yards
*NL*
apart
,
facing
each
other
,
rigid
and
motionless
,
like
horsed
statues
.
*NL*
And
so
we
remained
,
in
a
soundless
hush
,
as
much
as
a
full
minute
,
*NL*
everybody
gazing
,
nobody
stirring
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
king
could
*NL*
not
take
heart
to
give
the
signal
.
But
at
last
he
lifted
his
hand
,
*NL*
the
clear
note
of
the
bugle
followed
,
Sir
Sagramor
's
long
blade
*NL*
described
a
flashing
curve
in
the
air
,
and
it
was
superb
to
see
him
*NL*
come
.
I
sat
still
.
On
he
came
.
I
did
not
move
.
People
got
so
*NL*
excited
that
they
shouted
to
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fly
,
fly
!
Save
thyself
!
This
is
murther
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
budged
so
much
as
an
inch
till
that
thundering
apparition
*NL*
had
got
within
fifteen
paces
of
me
;
then
I
snatched
a
dragoon
*NL*
revolver
out
of
my
holster
,
there
was
a
flash
and
a
roar
,
and
*NL*
the
revolver
was
back
in
the
holster
before
anybody
could
tell
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
riderless
horse
plunging
by
,
and
yonder
lay
Sir
Sagramor
,
*NL*
stone
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
that
ran
to
him
were
stricken
dumb
to
find
that
the
life
*NL*
was
actually
gone
out
of
the
man
and
no
reason
for
it
visible
,
*NL*
no
hurt
upon
his
body
,
nothing
like
a
wound
.
There
was
a
hole
*NL*
through
the
breast
of
his
chain-mail
,
but
they
attached
no
importance
*NL*
to
a
little
thing
like
that
;
and
as
a
bullet
wound
there
produces
*NL*
but
little
blood
,
none
came
in
sight
because
of
the
clothing
and
*NL*
swaddlings
under
the
armor
.
The
body
was
dragged
over
to
let
*NL*
the
king
and
the
swells
look
down
upon
it
.
They
were
stupefied
*NL*
with
astonishment
naturally
.
I
was
requested
to
come
and
explain
*NL*
the
miracle
.
But
I
remained
in
my
tracks
,
like
a
statue
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
a
command
,
I
will
come
,
but
my
lord
the
king
knows
that
*NL*
I
am
where
the
laws
of
combat
require
me
to
remain
while
any
desire
*NL*
to
come
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
waited
.
Nobody
challenged
.
Then
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
are
any
who
doubt
that
this
field
is
well
and
fairly
won
,
*NL*
I
do
not
wait
for
them
to
challenge
me
,
I
challenge
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
gallant
offer
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
and
well
beseems
you
.
*NL*
Whom
will
you
name
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
name
none
,
I
challenge
all
!
Here
I
stand
,
and
dare
the
chivalry
*NL*
of
England
to
come
against
me
--
not
by
individuals
,
but
in
mass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
shouted
a
score
of
knights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
heard
the
challenge
.
Take
it
,
or
I
proclaim
you
recreant
*NL*
knights
and
vanquished
,
every
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
``
bluff
''
you
know
.
At
such
a
time
it
is
sound
judgment
*NL*
to
put
on
a
bold
face
and
play
your
hand
for
a
hundred
times
what
*NL*
it
is
worth
;
forty-nine
times
out
of
fifty
nobody
dares
to
``
call
,
''
*NL*
and
you
rake
in
the
chips
.
But
just
this
once
--
well
,
things
looked
*NL*
squally
!
In
just
no
time
,
five
hundred
knights
were
scrambling
*NL*
into
their
saddles
,
and
before
you
could
wink
a
widely
scattering
*NL*
drove
were
under
way
and
clattering
down
upon
me
.
I
snatched
*NL*
both
revolvers
from
the
holsters
and
began
to
measure
distances
*NL*
and
calculate
chances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bang
!
One
saddle
empty
.
Bang
!
another
one
.
Bang
--
bang
,
and
*NL*
I
bagged
two
.
Well
,
it
was
nip
and
tuck
with
us
,
and
I
knew
it
.
*NL*
If
I
spent
the
eleventh
shot
without
convincing
these
people
,
*NL*
the
twelfth
man
would
kill
me
,
sure
.
And
so
I
never
did
feel
*NL*
so
happy
as
I
did
when
my
ninth
downed
its
man
and
I
detected
*NL*
the
wavering
in
the
crowd
which
is
premonitory
of
panic
.
An
instant
*NL*
lost
now
could
knock
out
my
last
chance
.
But
I
did
n't
lose
it
.
*NL*
I
raised
both
revolvers
and
pointed
them
--
the
halted
host
stood
*NL*
their
ground
just
about
one
good
square
moment
,
then
broke
and
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
mine
.
Knight-errantry
was
a
doomed
institution
.
The
*NL*
march
of
civilization
was
begun
.
How
did
I
feel
?
Ah
,
you
never
*NL*
could
imagine
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Brer
Merlin
?
His
stock
was
flat
again
.
Somehow
,
every
time
*NL*
the
magic
of
fol-de-rol
tried
conclusions
with
the
magic
of
science
,
*NL*
the

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
THREE
YEARS
LATER
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
broke
the
back
of
knight-errantry
that
time
,
I
no
longer
*NL*
felt
obliged
to
work
in
secret
.
So
,
the
very
next
day
I
exposed
*NL*
my
hidden
schools
,
my
mines
,
and
my
vast
system
of
clandestine
*NL*
factories
and
workshops
to
an
astonished
world
.
That
is
to
say
,
*NL*
I
exposed
the
nineteenth
century
to
the
inspection
of
the
sixth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
is
always
a
good
plan
to
follow
up
an
advantage
promptly
.
*NL*
The
knights
were
temporarily
down
,
but
if
I
would
keep
them
so
*NL*
I
must
just
simply
paralyze
them
--
nothing
short
of
that
would
*NL*
answer
.
You
see
,
I
was
``
bluffing
''
that
last
time
in
the
field
;
*NL*
it
would
be
natural
for
them
to
work
around
to
that
conclusion
,
*NL*
if
I
gave
them
a
chance
.
So
I
must
not
give
them
time
;
and
I
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
renewed
my
challenge
,
engraved
it
on
brass
,
posted
it
up
where
*NL*
any
priest
could
read
it
to
them
,
and
also
kept
it
standing
in
*NL*
the
advertising
columns
of
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
not
only
renewed
it
,
but
added
to
its
proportions
.
I
said
,
*NL*
name
the
day
,
and
I
would
take
fifty
assistants
and
stand
up
*NL*
_
against
the
massed
chivalry
of
the
whole
earth
and
destroy
it
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
bluffing
this
time
.
I
meant
what
I
said
;
I
could
do
*NL*
what
I
promised
.
There
was
n't
any
way
to
misunderstand
the
language
*NL*
of
that
challenge
.
Even
the
dullest
of
the
chivalry
perceived
*NL*
that
this
was
a
plain
case
of
``
put
up
,
or
shut
up
.
''
They
were
*NL*
wise
and
did
the
latter
.
In
all
the
next
three
years
they
gave
*NL*
me
no
trouble
worth
mentioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consider
the
three
years
sped
.
Now
look
around
on
England
.
A
happy
*NL*
and
prosperous
country
,
and
strangely
altered
.
Schools
everywhere
,
*NL*
and
several
colleges
;
a
number
of
pretty
good
newspapers
.
Even
*NL*
authorship
was
taking
a
start
;
Sir
Dinadan
the
Humorist
was
first
*NL*
in
the
field
,
with
a
volume
of
gray-headed
jokes
which
I
had
been
*NL*
familiar
with
during
thirteen
centuries
.
If
he
had
left
out
that
*NL*
old
rancid
one
about
the
lecturer
I
would
n't
have
said
anything
;
*NL*
but
I
could
n't
stand
that
one
.
I
suppressed
the
book
and
hanged
*NL*
the
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slavery
was
dead
and
gone
;
all
men
were
equal
before
the
law
;
*NL*
taxation
had
been
equalized
.
The
telegraph
,
the
telephone
,
the
*NL*
phonograph
,
the
typewriter
,
the
sewing-machine
,
and
all
the
thousand
*NL*
willing
and
handy
servants
of
steam
and
electricity
were
working
*NL*
their
way
into
favor
.
We
had
a
steamboat
or
two
on
the
Thames
,
*NL*
we
had
steam
warships
,
and
the
beginnings
of
a
steam
commercial
*NL*
marine
;
I
was
getting
ready
to
send
out
an
expedition
to
discover
*NL*
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
building
several
lines
of
railway
,
and
our
line
from
*NL*
Camelot
to
London
was
already
finished
and
in
operation
.
I
was
*NL*
shrewd
enough
to
make
all
offices
connected
with
the
passenger
*NL*
service
places
of
high
and
distinguished
honor
.
My
idea
was
*NL*
to
attract
the
chivalry
and
nobility
,
and
make
them
useful
and
keep
*NL*
them
out
of
mischief
.
The
plan
worked
very
well
,
the
competition
*NL*
for
the
places
was
hot
.
The
conductor
of
the
4.33
express
was
*NL*
a
duke
;
there
was
n't
a
passenger
conductor
on
the
line
below
*NL*
the
degree
of
earl
.
They
were
good
men
,
every
one
,
but
they
had
*NL*
two
defects
which
I
could
n't
cure
,
and
so
had
to
wink
at
:
they
*NL*
would
n't
lay
aside
their
armor
,
and
they
would
``
knock
down
''
fare
*NL*
--
I
mean
rob
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
hardly
a
knight
in
all
the
land
who
was
n't
in
some
useful
*NL*
employment
.
They
were
going
from
end
to
end
of
the
country
in
all
*NL*
manner
of
useful
missionary
capacities
;
their
penchant
for
wandering
,
*NL*
and
their
experience
in
it
,
made
them
altogether
the
most
effective
*NL*
spreaders
of
civilization
we
had
.
They
went
clothed
in
steel
and
*NL*
equipped
with
sword
and
lance
and
battle-axe
,
and
if
they
could
n't
*NL*
persuade
a
person
to
try
a
sewing-machine
on
the
installment
plan
,
*NL*
or
a
melodeon
,
or
a
barbed-wire
fence
,
or
a
prohibition
journal
,
*NL*
or
any
of
the
other
thousand
and
one
things
they
canvassed
for
,
*NL*
they
removed
him
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
very
happy
.
Things
were
working
steadily
toward
a
secretly
*NL*
longed-for
point
.
You
see
,
I
had
two
schemes
in
my
head
which
*NL*
were
the
vastest
of
all
my
projects
.
The
one
was
to
overthrow
the
*NL*
Catholic
Church
and
set
up
the
Protestant
faith
on
its
ruins
*NL*
--
not
as
an
Established
Church
,
but
a
go-as-you-please
one
;
and
*NL*
the
other
project
was
to
get
a
decree
issued
by
and
by
,
commanding
*NL*
that
upon
Arthur
's
death
unlimited
suffrage
should
be
introduced
,
*NL*
and
given
to
men
and
women
alike
--
at
any
rate
to
all
men
,
wise
*NL*
or
unwise
,
and
to
all
mothers
who
at
middle
age
should
be
found
*NL*
to
know
nearly
as
much
as
their
sons
at
twenty-one
.
Arthur
was
*NL*
good
for
thirty
years
yet
,
he
being
about
my
own
age
--
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
forty
--
and
I
believed
that
in
that
time
I
could
easily
*NL*
have
the
active
part
of
the
population
of
that
day
ready
and
eager
*NL*
for
an
event
which
should
be
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
history
*NL*
of
the
world
--
a
rounded
and
complete
governmental
revolution
*NL*
without
bloodshed
.
The
result
to
be
a
republic
.
Well
,
I
may
*NL*
as
well
confess
,
though
I
do
feel
ashamed
when
I
think
of
it
:
*NL*
I
was
beginning
to
have
a
base
hankering
to
be
its
first
president
*NL*
myself
.
Yes
,
there
was
more
or
less
human
nature
in
me
;
I
found
*NL*
that
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clarence
was
with
me
as
concerned
the
revolution
,
but
in
a
modified
*NL*
way
.
His
idea
was
a
republic
,
without
privileged
orders
,
but
with
*NL*
a
hereditary
royal
family
at
the
head
of
it
instead
of
an
elective
*NL*
chief
magistrate
.
He
believed
that
no
nation
that
had
ever
known
*NL*
the
joy
of
worshiping
a
royal
family
could
ever
be
robbed
of
it
*NL*
and
not
fade
away
and
die
of
melancholy
.
I
urged
that
kings
were
*NL*
dangerous
.
He
said
,
then
have
cats
.
He
was
sure
that
a
royal
*NL*
family
of
cats
would
answer
every
purpose
.
They
would
be
as
useful
*NL*
as
any
other
royal
family
,
they
would
know
as
much
,
they
would
*NL*
have
the
same
virtues
and
the
same
treacheries
,
the
same
disposition
*NL*
to
get
up
shindies
with
other
royal
cats
,
they
would
be
laughably
*NL*
vain
and
absurd
and
never
know
it
,
they
would
be
wholly
inexpensive
;
*NL*
finally
,
they
would
have
as
sound
a
divine
right
as
any
other
*NL*
royal
house
,
and
``
Tom
VII
,
or
Tom
XI
,
or
Tom
XIV
by
the
grace
*NL*
of
God
King
,
''
would
sound
as
well
as
it
would
when
applied
to
*NL*
the
ordinary
royal
tomcat
with
tights
on
.
``
And
as
a
rule
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
in
his
neat
modern
English
,
``
the
character
of
these
cats
would
*NL*
be
considerably
above
the
character
of
the
average
king
,
and
this
*NL*
would
be
an
immense
moral
advantage
to
the
nation
,
for
the
reason
*NL*
that
a
nation
always
models
its
morals
after
its
monarch
's
.
The
*NL*
worship
of
royalty
being
founded
in
unreason
,
these
graceful
and
*NL*
harmless
cats
would
easily
become
as
sacred
as
any
other
royalties
,
*NL*
and
indeed
more
so
,
because
it
would
presently
be
noticed
that
*NL*
they
hanged
nobody
,
beheaded
nobody
,
imprisoned
nobody
,
inflicted
*NL*
no
cruelties
or
injustices
of
any
sort
,
and
so
must
be
worthy
of
*NL*
a
deeper
love
and
reverence
than
the
customary
human
king
,
and
*NL*
would
certainly
get
it
.
The
eyes
of
the
whole
harried
world
would
*NL*
soon
be
fixed
upon
this
humane
and
gentle
system
,
and
royal
butchers
*NL*
would
presently
begin
to
disappear
;
their
subjects
would
fill
*NL*
the
vacancies
with
catlings
from
our
own
royal
house
;
we
should
*NL*
become
a
factory
;
we
should
supply
the
thrones
of
the
world
;
within
*NL*
forty
years
all
Europe
would
be
governed
by
cats
,
and
we
should
*NL*
furnish
the
cats
.
The
reign
of
universal
peace
would
begin
then
,
*NL*
to
end
no
more
forever
...
Me-e-e-yow-ow-ow-ow
--
fzt
!
--
wow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hang
him
,
I
supposed
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
was
beginning
to
be
*NL*
persuaded
by
him
,
until
he
exploded
that
cat-howl
and
startled
me
*NL*
almost
out
of
my
clothes
.
But
he
never
could
be
in
earnest
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
know
what
it
was
.
He
had
pictured
a
distinct
and
perfectly
*NL*
rational
and
feasible
improvement
upon
constitutional
monarchy
,
*NL*
but
he
was
too
feather-headed
to
know
it
,
or
care
anything
about
*NL*
it
,
either
.
I
was
going
to
give
him
a
scolding
,
but
Sandy
came
*NL*
flying
in
at
that
moment
,
wild
with
terror
,
and
so
choked
with
sobs
*NL*
that
for
a
minute
she
could
not
get
her
voice
.
I
ran
and
took
her
*NL*
in
my
arms
,
and
lavished
caresses
upon
her
and
said
,
beseechingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
darling
,
speak
!
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
head
fell
limp
upon
my
bosom
,
and
she
gasped
,
almost
inaudibly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
HELLO-CENTRAL
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
''
I
shouted
to
Clarence
;
``
telephone
the
king
's
homeopath
*NL*
to
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
minutes
I
was
kneeling
by
the
child
's
crib
,
and
Sandy
was
*NL*
dispatching
servants
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
all
over
the
*NL*
palace
.
I
took
in
the
situation
almost
at
a
glance
--
membranous
*NL*
croup
!
I
bent
down
and
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake
up
,
sweetheart
!
Hello-Central
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
soft
eyes
languidly
,
and
made
out
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
comfort
.
She
was
far
from
dead
yet
.
I
sent
for
*NL*
preparations
of
sulphur
,
I
rousted
out
the
croup-kettle
myself
;
*NL*
for
I
do
n't
sit
down
and
wait
for
doctors
when
Sandy
or
the
child
*NL*
is
sick
.
I
knew
how
to
nurse
both
of
them
,
and
had
had
experience
.
*NL*
This
little
chap
had
lived
in
my
arms
a
good
part
of
its
small
life
,
*NL*
and
often
I
could
soothe
away
its
troubles
and
get
it
to
laugh
*NL*
through
the
tear-dews
on
its
eye-lashes
when
even
its
mother
could
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
,
in
his
richest
armor
,
came
striding
along
the
great
*NL*
hall
now
on
his
way
to
the
stock-board
;
he
was
president
of
the
*NL*
stock-board
,
and
occupied
the
Siege
Perilous
,
which
he
had
bought
*NL*
of
Sir
Galahad
;
for
the
stock-board
consisted
of
the
Knights
of
*NL*
the
Round
Table
,
and
they
used
the
Round
Table
for
business
purposes
*NL*
now
.
Seats
at
it
were
worth
--
well
,
you
would
never
believe
the
*NL*
figure
,
so
it
is
no
use
to
state
it
.
Sir
Launcelot
was
a
bear
,
and
*NL*
he
had
put
up
a
corner
in
one
of
the
new
lines
,
and
was
just
getting
*NL*
ready
to
squeeze
the
shorts
to-day
;
but
what
of
that
?
He
was
*NL*
the
same
old
Launcelot
,
and
when
he
glanced
in
as
he
was
passing
*NL*
the
door
and
found
out
that
his
pet
was
sick
,
that
was
enough
*NL*
for
him
;
bulls
and
bears
might
fight
it
out
their
own
way
for
all
*NL*
him
,
he
would
come
right
in
here
and
stand
by
little
Hello-Central
*NL*
for
all
he
was
worth
.
And
that
was
what
he
did
.
He
shied
his
*NL*
helmet
into
the
corner
,
and
in
half
a
minute
he
had
a
new
wick
*NL*
in
the
alcohol
lamp
and
was
firing
up
on
the
croup-kettle
.
By
this
*NL*
time
Sandy
had
built
a
blanket
canopy
over
the
crib
,
and
everything
*NL*
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Launcelot
got
up
steam
,
he
and
I
loaded
up
the
kettle
with
*NL*
unslaked
lime
and
carbolic
acid
,
with
a
touch
of
lactic
acid
added
*NL*
thereto
,
then
filled
the
thing
up
with
water
and
inserted
the
*NL*
steam-spout
under
the
canopy
.
Everything
was
ship-shape
now
,
*NL*
and
we
sat
down
on
either
side
of
the
crib
to
stand
our
watch
.
*NL*
Sandy
was
so
grateful
and
so
comforted
that
she
charged
a
couple
*NL*
of
church-wardens
with
willow-bark
and
sumach-tobacco
for
us
,
*NL*
and
told
us
to
smoke
as
much
as
we
pleased
,
it
could
n't
get
under
*NL*
the
canopy
,
and
she
was
used
to
smoke
,
being
the
first
lady
in
the
*NL*
land
who
had
ever
seen
a
cloud
blown
.
Well
,
there
could
n't
be
*NL*
a
more
contented
or
comfortable
sight
than
Sir
Launcelot
in
his
*NL*
noble
armor
sitting
in
gracious
serenity
at
the
end
of
a
yard
*NL*
of
snowy
church-warden
.
He
was
a
beautiful
man
,
a
lovely
man
,
*NL*
and
was
just
intended
to
make
a
wife
and
children
happy
.
But
,
of
*NL*
course
Guenever
--
however
,
it
's
no
use
to
cry
over
what
's
done
and
*NL*
ca
n't
be
helped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
stood
watch-and-watch
with
me
,
right
straight
through
,
*NL*
for
three
days
and
nights
,
till
the
child
was
out
of
danger
;
then
*NL*
he
took
her
up
in
his
great
arms
and
kissed
her
,
with
his
plumes
*NL*
falling
about
her
golden
head
,
then
laid
her
softly
in
Sandy
's
*NL*
lap
again
and
took
his
stately
way
down
the
vast
hall
,
between
*NL*
the
ranks
of
admiring
men-at-arms
and
menials
,
and
so
disappeared
.
*NL*
And
no
instinct
warned
me
that
I
should
never
look
upon
him
again
*NL*
in
this
world
!
Lord
,
what
a
world
of
heart-break
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctors
said
we
must
take
the
child
away
,
if
we
would
coax
*NL*
her
back
to
health
and
strength
again
.
And
she
must
have
sea-air
.
*NL*
So
we
took
a
man-of-war
,
and
a
suite
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
*NL*
persons
,
and
went
cruising
about
,
and
after
a
fortnight
of
this
we
*NL*
stepped
ashore
on
the
French
coast
,
and
the
doctors
thought
it
*NL*
would
be
a
good
idea
to
make
something
of
a
stay
there
.
The
little
*NL*
king
of
that
region
offered
us
his
hospitalities
,
and
we
were
glad
*NL*
to
accept
.
If
he
had
had
as
many
conveniences
as
he
lacked
,
we
*NL*
should
have
been
plenty
comfortable
enough
;
even
as
it
was
,
we
*NL*
made
out
very
well
,
in
his
queer
old
castle
,
by
the
help
of
comforts
*NL*
and
luxuries
from
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
month
I
sent
the
vessel
home
for
fresh
supplies
,
*NL*
and
for
news
.
We
expected
her
back
in
three
or
four
days
.
She
*NL*
would
bring
me
,
along
with
other
news
,
the
result
of
a
certain
*NL*
experiment
which
I
had
been
starting
.
It
was
a
project
of
mine
*NL*
to
replace
the
tournament
with
something
which
might
furnish
an
*NL*
escape
for
the
extra
steam
of
the
chivalry
,
keep
those
bucks
*NL*
entertained
and
out
of
mischief
,
and
at
the
same
time
preserve
*NL*
the
best
thing
in
them
,
which
was
their
hardy
spirit
of
emulation
.
*NL*
I
had
had
a
choice
band
of
them
in
private
training
for
some
time
,
*NL*
and
the
date
was
now
arriving
for
their
first
public
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
experiment
was
baseball
.
In
order
to
give
the
thing
vogue
*NL*
from
the
start
,
and
place
it
out
of
the
reach
of
criticism
,
I
chose
*NL*
my
nines
by
rank
,
not
capacity
.
There
was
n't
a
knight
in
either
*NL*
team
who
was
n't
a
sceptered
sovereign
.
As
for
material
of
this
*NL*
sort
,
there
was
a
glut
of
it
always
around
Arthur
.
You
could
n't
*NL*
throw
a
brick
in
any
direction
and
not
cripple
a
king
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
I
could
n't
get
these
people
to
leave
off
their
armor
;
they
would
n't
*NL*
do
that
when
they
bathed
.
They
consented
to
differentiate
the
*NL*
armor
so
that
a
body
could
tell
one
team
from
the
other
,
but
that
*NL*
was
the
most
they
would
do
.
So
,
one
of
the
teams
wore
chain-mail
*NL*
ulsters
,
and
the
other
wore
plate-armor
made
of
my
new
Bessemer
*NL*
steel
.
Their
practice
in
the
field
was
the
most
fantastic
thing
I
*NL*
ever
saw
.
Being
ball-proof
,
they
never
skipped
out
of
the
way
,
*NL*
but
stood
still
and
took
the
result
;
when
a
Bessemer
was
at
the
bat
*NL*
and
a
ball
hit
him
,
it
would
bound
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
*NL*
sometimes
.
And
when
a
man
was
running
,
and
threw
himself
on
his
*NL*
stomach
to
slide
to
his
base
,
it
was
like
an
iron-clad
coming
into
*NL*
port
.
At
first
I
appointed
men
of
no
rank
to
act
as
umpires
,
but
*NL*
I
had
to
discontinue
that
.
These
people
were
no
easier
to
please
*NL*
than
other
nines
.
The
umpire
's
first
decision
was
usually
his
*NL*
last
;
they
broke
him
in
two
with
a
bat
,
and
his
friends
toted
him
*NL*
home
on
a
shutter
.
When
it
was
noticed
that
no
umpire
ever
survived
*NL*
a
game
,
umpiring
got
to
be
unpopular
.
So
I
was
obliged
to
appoint
*NL*
somebody
whose
rank
and
lofty
position
under
the
government
would
*NL*
protect
him
.

fifty

and
for
solid
fun
would
be
worth
going
around
the
world
to
see
.
*NL*
Everything
would
be
favorable
;
it
was
balmy
and
beautiful
spring

weather
now

and
Nature
was
all
tailored
out
in

new

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
INTERDICT
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
my
attention
was
suddenly
snatched
from
such
matters
;
*NL*
our
child
began
to
lose
ground
again
,
and
we
had
to
go
to
sitting
*NL*
up
with
her
,
her
case
became
so
serious
.
We
could
n't
bear
to
allow
*NL*
anybody
to
help
in
this
service
,
so
we
two
stood
watch-and-watch
,
*NL*
day
in
and
day
out
.
Ah
,
Sandy
,
what
a
right
heart
she
had
,
how
*NL*
simple
,
and
genuine
,
and
good
she
was
!
She
was
a
flawless
wife
*NL*
and
mother
;
and
yet
I
had
married
her
for
no
other
particular
*NL*
reasons
,
except
that
by
the
customs
of
chivalry
she
was
my
property
*NL*
until
some
knight
should
win
her
from
me
in
the
field
.
She
had
*NL*
hunted
Britain
over
for
me
;
had
found
me
at
the
hanging-bout
*NL*
outside
of
London
,
and
had
straightway
resumed
her
old
place
at
*NL*
my
side
in
the
placidest
way
and
as
of
right
.
I
was
a
New
Englander
,
*NL*
and
in
my
opinion
this
sort
of
partnership
would
compromise
her
,
*NL*
sooner
or
later
.
She
could
n't
see
how
,
but
I
cut
argument
short
*NL*
and
we
had
a
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
did
n't
know
I
was
drawing
a
prize
,
yet
that
was
what
I
did
*NL*
draw
.
Within
the
twelvemonth
I
became
her
worshiper
;
and
ours
*NL*
was
the
dearest
and
perfectest
comradeship
that
ever
was
.
People
*NL*
talk
about
beautiful
friendships
between
two
persons
of
the
same
*NL*
sex
.
What
is
the
best
of
that
sort
,
as
compared
with
the
friendship
*NL*
of
man
and
wife
,
where
the
best
impulses
and
highest
ideals
of
*NL*
both
are
the
same
?
There
is
no
place
for
comparison
between
*NL*
the
two
friendships
;
the
one
is
earthly
,
the
other
divine
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
dreams
,
along
at
first
,
I
still
wandered
thirteen
centuries
*NL*
away
,
and
my
unsatisfied
spirit
went
calling
and
harking
all
up
*NL*
and
down
the
unreplying
vacancies
of
a
vanished
world
.
Many
a
*NL*
time
Sandy
heard
that
imploring
cry
come
from
my
lips
in
my
sleep
.
*NL*
With
a
grand
magnanimity
she
saddled
that
cry
of
mine
upon
our
*NL*
child
,
conceiving
it
to
be
the
name
of
some
lost
darling
of
mine
.
*NL*
It
touched
me
to
tears
,
and
it
also
nearly
knocked
me
off
my
feet
,
*NL*
too
,
when
she
smiled
up
in
my
face
for
an
earned
reward
,
and
played
*NL*
her
quaint
and
pretty
surprise
upon
me
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
of
one
who
was
dear
to
thee
is
here
preserved
,
here
made
*NL*
holy
,
and
the
music
of
it
will
abide
alway
in
our
ears
.
Now
*NL*
thou
`
lt
kiss
me
,
as
knowing
the
name
I
have
given
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
did
n't
know
it
,
all
the
same
.
I
had
n't
an
idea
in
the
*NL*
world
;
but
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
confess
it
and
spoil
her
*NL*
pretty
game
;
so
I
never
let
on
,
but
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
sweetheart
--
how
dear
and
good
it
is
of
you
,
too
!
*NL*
But
I
want
to
hear
these
lips
of
yours
,
which
are
also
mine
,
utter
*NL*
it
first
--
then
its
music
will
be
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pleased
to
the
marrow
,
she
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
HELLO-CENTRAL
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
laugh
--
I
am
always
thankful
for
that
--
but
the
strain
*NL*
ruptured
every
cartilage
in
me
,
and
for
weeks
afterward
I
could
*NL*
hear
my
bones
clack
when
I
walked
.
She
never
found
out
her
mistake
.
*NL*
The
first
time
she
heard
that
form
of
salute
used
at
the
telephone
*NL*
she
was
surprised
,
and
not
pleased
;
but
I
told
her
I
had
given
*NL*
order
for
it
:
that
henceforth
and
forever
the
telephone
must
*NL*
always
be
invoked
with
that
reverent
formality
,
in
perpetual
honor
*NL*
and
remembrance
of
my
lost
friend
and
her
small
namesake
.
This
*NL*
was
not
true
.
But
it
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
during
two
weeks
and
a
half
we
watched
by
the
crib
,
and
in
*NL*
our
deep
solicitude
we
were
unconscious
of
any
world
outside
of
*NL*
that
sick-room
.
Then
our
reward
came
:
the
center
of
the
universe
*NL*
turned
the
corner
and
began
to
mend
.
Grateful
?
It
is
n't
the
term
.
*NL*
There
_
is
n't
_
any
term
for
it
.
You
know
that
yourself
,
if
you
've
*NL*
watched
your
child
through
the
Valley
of
the
Shadow
and
seen
it
*NL*
come
back
to
life
and
sweep
night
out
of
the
earth
with
one
*NL*
all-illuminating
smile
that
you
could
cover
with
your
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
we
were
back
in
this
world
in
one
instant
!
Then
we
looked
*NL*
the
same
startled
thought
into
each
other
's
eyes
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
;
more
than
two
weeks
gone
,
and
that
ship
not
back
yet
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
minute
I
appeared
in
the
presence
of
my
train
.
They
*NL*
had
been
steeped
in
troubled
bodings
all
this
time
--
their
faces
*NL*
showed
it
.
I
called
an
escort
and
we
galloped
five
miles
to
a
*NL*
hilltop
overlooking
the
sea
.
Where
was
my
great
commerce
that
*NL*
so
lately
had
made
these
glistening
expanses
populous
and
beautiful
*NL*
with
its
white-winged
flocks
?
Vanished
,
every
one
!
Not
a
sail
,
*NL*
from
verge
to
verge
,
not
a
smoke-bank
--
just
a
dead
and
empty
*NL*
solitude
,
in
place
of
all
that
brisk
and
breezy
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
swiftly
back
,
saying
not
a
word
to
anybody
.
I
told
Sandy
*NL*
this
ghastly
news
.
We
could
imagine
no
explanation
that
would
*NL*
begin
to
explain
.
Had
there
been
an
invasion
?
an
earthquake
?
*NL*
a
pestilence
?
Had
the
nation
been
swept
out
of
existence
?
But
*NL*
guessing
was
profitless
.
I
must
go
--
at
once
.
I
borrowed
the
king
's
*NL*
navy
--
a
``
ship
''
no
bigger
than
a
steam
launch
--
and
was
soon
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parting
--
ah
,
yes
,
that
was
hard
.
As
I
was
devouring
the
child
*NL*
with
last
kisses
,
it
brisked
up
and
jabbered
out
its
vocabulary
!
*NL*
--
the
first
time
in
more
than
two
weeks
,
and
it
made
fools
of
us
*NL*
for
joy
.
The
darling
mispronunciations
of
childhood
!
--
dear
me
,
*NL*
there
's
no
music
that
can
touch
it
;
and
how
one
grieves
when
it
*NL*
wastes
away
and
dissolves
into
correctness
,
knowing
it
will
never
*NL*
visit
his
bereaved
ear
again
.
Well
,
how
good
it
was
to
be
able
*NL*
to
carry
that
gracious
memory
away
with
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
approached
England
the
next
morning
,
with
the
wide
highway
of
*NL*
salt
water
all
to
myself
.
There
were
ships
in
the
harbor
,
at
*NL*
Dover
,
but
they
were
naked
as
to
sails
,
and
there
was
no
sign
*NL*
of
life
about
them
.
It
was
Sunday
;
yet
at
Canterbury
the
streets
*NL*
were
empty
;
strangest
of
all
,
there
was
not
even
a
priest
in
sight
,
*NL*
and
no
stroke
of
a
bell
fell
upon
my
ear
.
The
mournfulness
of
*NL*
death
was
everywhere
.
I
could
n't
understand
it
.
At
last
,
in
*NL*
the
further
edge
of
that
town
I
saw
a
small
funeral
procession
*NL*
--
just
a
family
and
a
few
friends
following
a
coffin
--
no
priest
;
*NL*
a
funeral
without
bell
,
book
,
or
candle
;
there
was
a
church
there
*NL*
close
at
hand
,
but
they
passed
it
by
weeping
,
and
did
not
enter
it
;
*NL*
I
glanced
up
at
the
belfry
,
and
there
hung
the
bell
,
shrouded
in
*NL*
black
,
and
its
tongue
tied
back
.
Now
I
knew
!
Now
I
understood
*NL*
the
stupendous
calamity
that
had
overtaken
England
.
Invasion
?
*NL*
Invasion
is
a
triviality
to
it
.
It
was
the
INTERDICT
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
no
questions
;
I
did
n't
need
to
ask
any
.
The
Church
had
*NL*
struck
;
the
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
get
into
a
disguise
,
and
*NL*
go
warily
.
One
of
my
servants
gave
me
a
suit
of
clothes
,
and
*NL*
when
we
were
safe
beyond
the
town
I
put
them
on
,
and
from
that
time
*NL*
I
traveled
alone
;
I
could
not
risk
the
embarrassment
of
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
miserable
journey
.
A
desolate
silence
everywhere
.
Even
in
*NL*
London
itself
.
Traffic
had
ceased
;
men
did
not
talk
or
laugh
,
or
*NL*
go
in
groups
,
or
even
in
couples
;
they
moved
aimlessly
about
,
each
*NL*
man
by
himself
,
with
his
head
down
,
and
woe
and
terror
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
The
Tower
showed
recent
war-scars
.
Verily
,
much
had
been
happening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
I
meant
to
take
the
train
for
Camelot
.
Train
!
Why
,
*NL*
the
station
was
as
vacant
as
a
cavern
.
I
moved
on
.
The
journey
*NL*
to
Camelot
was
a
repetition
of
what
I
had
already
seen
.
The
Monday
*NL*
and
the
Tuesday
differed
in
no
way
from
the
Sunday
.
I
arrived
*NL*
far
in
the
night
.
From
being
the
best
electric-lighted
town
in
*NL*
the
kingdom
and
the
most
like
a
recumbent
sun
of
anything
you
ever
*NL*
saw
,
it
was
become
simply
a
blot
--
a
blot
upon
darkness
--
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
it
was
darker
and
solider
than
the
rest
of
the
darkness
,
*NL*
and
so
you
could
see
it
a
little
better
;
it
made
me
feel
as
if
*NL*
maybe
it
was
symbolical
--
a
sort
of
sign
that
the
Church
was
going
to
*NL*
_
keep
_
the
upper
hand
now
,
and
snuff
out
all
my
beautiful
civilization
*NL*
just
like
that
.
I
found
no
life
stirring
in
the
somber
streets
.
*NL*
I
groped
my
way
with
a
heavy
heart
.
The
vast
castle
loomed
black
*NL*
upon
the
hilltop
,
not
a
spark
visible
about
it
.
The
drawbridge
*NL*
was
down
,
the
great
gate
stood
wide
,
I
entered
without
challenge
,
*NL*
my
own
heels
making
the
only
sound
I
heard
--
and
it
was
sepulchral
*NL*
enough
,
in
those
huge
vacant
courts
.

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
WAR
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
Clarence
alone
in
his
quarters
,
drowned
in
melancholy
;
*NL*
and
in
place
of
the
electric
light
,
he
had
reinstituted
the
ancient
*NL*
rag-lamp
,
and
sat
there
in
a
grisly
twilight
with
all
curtains
*NL*
drawn
tight
.
He
sprang
up
and
rushed
for
me
eagerly
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
worth
a
billion
milrays
to
look
upon
a
live
person
again

*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
me
as
easily
as
if
I
had
n't
been
disguised
at
all
.
Which
*NL*
frightened
me
;
one
may
easily
believe
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
now
,
tell
me
the
meaning
of
this
fearful
disaster

I
said

it

about

for
one
of
your
modern
improvements

the
stock-board

When

three

London

Canterbury

Dover
were
ready
for

and
also
ready

ripe
for

in

It
was
wildcat

everybody

it

The
stock
was
for

give-away

Yes

he
quietly

up

about
twice

him

to
witness

*NL*
``
Well
,
the
rest
of
the
tale
is
just
war

pure

simple

Launcelot
*NL*
retreated
to
his
town
and
castle
of
Joyous
Gard
,
and
gathered
*NL*
there
a
great
following
of
knights
.
The
king
,
with
a
great
host
,
*NL*
went
there
,
and
there
was
desperate
fighting
during
several
days
,
*NL*
and
,
as
a
result
,
all
the
plain
around
was
paved
with
corpses
*NL*
and
cast-iron
.
Then
the
Church
patched
up
a
peace
between
Arthur
*NL*
and
Launcelot
and
the
queen
and
everybody
--
everybody
but
Sir
Gawaine
.
*NL*
He
was
bitter
about
the
slaying
of
his
brothers
,
Gareth
and
Gaheris
,
*NL*
and
would
not
be
appeased
.
He
notified
Launcelot
to
get
him
*NL*
thence
,
and
make
swift
preparation
,
and
look
to
be
soon
attacked
.
*NL*
So
Launcelot
sailed
to
his
Duchy
of
Guienne
with
his
following
,
and
*NL*
Gawaine
soon
followed
with
an
army
,
and
he
beguiled
Arthur
to
go
*NL*
with
him

Arthur
left
the
kingdom
in
Sir

hands

Yes

Sir
Mordred
set
himself
at
once
to
work
to
make
his
kingship

permanent

He
was
going
to
marry
Guenever
,
as
a
first
move
;
but

she
fled

shut
herself
up

Mordred

attacked

the
Bishop

dropped
down
on
him
with
the

The
king
returned
;
Mordred
fought
him
at
Dover
,
at
*NL*
Canterbury
,
and
again
at
Barham
Down

Then
there
was
talk
of
peace

Gawaine

Arthur
in

at

his
ghost
did

warned
him
to

refrain
from
conflict
for
a
month
,
let
the
delay
cost
what
it
might

*NL*
But
battle
was
precipitated
by
an
accident

Arthur
had
given
*NL*
order
that
if
a
sword
was
raised
during
the
consultation
over
*NL*
the
proposed
treaty
with
Mordred
,
sound
the
trumpet
and
fall
on
!

he
had
no
confidence

Mordred

Mordred
had
given
a
similar
*NL*
order
to

his

people

Well

by
and
by
an
adder
bit
a
knight
's
heel
;
*NL*
the
knight
forgot
all
about
the
order
,
and
made
a
slash
at
the
*NL*
adder
with
his
sword
.
Inside
of
half
a
minute
those
two
prodigious
*NL*
hosts
came
together
with
a
crash
!
They
butchered
away
all
day

*NL*
Then
the

God
speed
you
well

*NL*
said
Sir
Bedivere

Then
the
king
gat
his
spear
*NL*
in
both
his
hands
,
and
ran
toward
Sir
Mordred
*NL*
crying
,
Traitor
,
now
is
thy
death
day
come
.
And
*NL*
when
Sir
Mordred
heard
Sir
Arthur
,
he
ran
until
*NL*
him
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
.
And
then
*NL*
King
Arthur
smote
Sir
Mordred
under
the
shield
,
*NL*
with
a
foin
of
his
spear
throughout
the
body
more
*NL*
than
a
fathom
.
And
when
Sir
Mordred
felt
that
he
*NL*
had
his
death
's
wound
,
he
thrust
himself
,
with
*NL*
the
might
that
he
had
,
up
to
the
butt
of
King
*NL*
Arthur
's
spear
.
And
right
so
he
smote
his
father
*NL*
Arthur
with
his
sword
holden
in
both
his
hands
,
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
that
the
sword
pierced
*NL*
the
helmet
and
the
brain-pan
,
and
therewithal
*NL*
Sir
Mordred
fell
stark
dead
to
the
earth
.
And
*NL*
the
noble
Arthur
fell
in

swoon
to

there
he
swooned

was

managed

ship

I
have
never

I
gave
myself
two

to
hear

from

Then

resolved

send

There
was

a
reason

did

What
was
that
?

Our
navy
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
disappeared
!
Also
,
as
*NL*
suddenly
and
as
mysteriously
,
the
railway
and
telegraph
and
*NL*
telephone
service
ceased
,
the
men
all
deserted
,
poles
were
cut
*NL*
down
,
the
Church
laid
a
ban
upon
the
electric
light
!
I
had
to
be
*NL*
up
and
doing
--
and
straight
off
.
Your
life
was
safe
--
nobody
in
*NL*
these
kingdoms
but
Merlin
would
venture
to
touch
such
a
magician
*NL*
as
you
without
ten
thousand
men
at
his
back
--
I
had
nothing
to
*NL*
think
of
but
how
to
put
preparations
in
the
best
trim
against
your
*NL*
coming
.
I
felt
safe
myself
--
nobody
would
be
anxious
to
touch
*NL*
a
pet
of
yours
.
So
this
is
what
I
did
.
From
our
various
works
*NL*
I
selected
all
the
men
--
boys
I
mean
--
whose
faithfulness
under
*NL*
whatsoever
pressure
I
could
swear
to
,
and
I
called
them
together
*NL*
secretly
and
gave
them
their
instructions
.
There
are
fifty-two
of
*NL*
them
;
none
younger
than
fourteen
,
and
none
above
seventeen
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
select
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
all
the
others
were
born
in
an
atmosphere
of
superstition
*NL*
and
reared
in
it
.
It
is
in
their
blood
and
bones
.
We
imagined
*NL*
we
had
educated
it
out
of
them
;
they
thought
so
,
too
;
the
Interdict
*NL*
woke
them
up
like
a
thunderclap
!
It
revealed
them
to
themselves
,
*NL*
and
it
revealed
them
to
me
,
too
.
With
boys
it
was
different
.
Such
*NL*
as
have
been
under
our
training
from
seven
to
ten
years
have
had
*NL*
no
acquaintance
with
the
Church
's
terrors
,
and
it
was
among
these
*NL*
that
I
found
my
fifty-two
.
As
a
next
move
,
I
paid
a
private
visit
*NL*
to
that
old
cave
of
Merlin
's
--
not
the
small
one
--
the
big
one
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
one
where
we
secretly
established
our
first
great
electric
*NL*
plant
when
I
was
projecting
a
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
.
And
as
that
miracle
had
n't
become
necessary
then
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
utilize
the
plant
now
.
I
've
*NL*
provisioned
the
cave
for
a
siege
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
idea
,
a
first-rate
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
.
I
placed
four
of
my
boys
there
as
a
guard
--
inside
,
*NL*
and
out
of
sight
.
Nobody
was
to
be
hurt
--
while
outside
;
but
any
*NL*
attempt
to
enter
--
well
,
we
said
just
let
anybody
try
it
!
Then
*NL*
I
went
out
into
the
hills
and
uncovered
and
cut
the
secret
wires
*NL*
which
connected
your
bedroom
with
the
wires
that
go
to
the
dynamite
*NL*
deposits
under
all
our
vast
factories

mills
,
workshops
,
magazines
,
*NL*
etc.
,
and
about
midnight
I
and
my
boys
turned
out
and
connected
*NL*
that
wire
with
the
cave
,
and
nobody
but
you
and
I
suspects
where
*NL*
the
other
end
of
it
goes
to
.
We
laid
it
under
ground
,
of
course
,
and
*NL*
it
was
all
finished
in
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
.
We
sha
'n'

leave
our
fortress

we
want
to
blow
up
our
civilization

kind

``
Yes

They
came
to
command
us

We
sat
silent
awhile

thinking

my

was
made
up

I
said

CHAPTER
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BATTLE
OF
THE
SAND
BELT
*NL*
*NL*
In
Merlin
's
Cave
--
Clarence
and
I
and
fifty-two
fresh
,
bright
,
*NL*
well-educated
,
clean-minded
young
British
boys
.
At
dawn
I
sent
*NL*
an
order
to
the
factories
and
to
all
our
great
works
to
stop
*NL*
operations
and
remove
all
life
to
a
safe
distance
,
as
everything
*NL*
was
going
to
be
blown
up
by
secret
mines
,
''
_
and
no
telling
at
what
*NL*
moment
--
therefore
,
vacate
at
once
_
.
''
These
people
knew
me
,
and
*NL*
had
confidence
in
my
word
.
They
would
clear
out
without
waiting
*NL*
to
part
their
hair
,
and
I
could
take
my
own
time
about
dating
the
*NL*
explosion
.
You
could
n't
hire
one
of
them
to
go
back
during
the
*NL*
century
,
if
the
explosion
was
still
impending
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
week
of
waiting
.
It
was
not
dull
for
me
,
because
I
was
*NL*
writing
all
the
time
.
During
the
first
three
days
,
I
finished
*NL*
turning
my
old
diary
into
this
narrative
form
;
it
only
required
*NL*
a
chapter
or
so
to
bring
it
down
to
date
.
The
rest
of
the
week
*NL*
I
took
up
in
writing
letters
to
my
wife
.
It
was
always
my
habit
*NL*
to
write
to
Sandy
every
day
,
whenever
we
were
separate
,
and
now
*NL*
I
kept
up
the
habit
for
love
of
it
,
and
of
her
,
though
I
could
n't
*NL*
do
anything
with
the
letters
,
of
course
,
after
I
had
written
them
.
*NL*
But
it
put
in
the
time
,
you
see
,
and
was
almost
like
talking
;
*NL*
it
was
almost
as
if
I
was
saying
,
``
Sandy
,
if
you
and
Hello-Central
*NL*
were
here
in
the
cave
,
instead
of
only
your
photographs
,
what
*NL*
good
times
we
could
have
!
''
And
then
,
you
know
,
I
could
imagine
*NL*
the
baby
goo-gooing
something
out
in
reply
,
with
its
fists
in
its
*NL*
mouth
and
itself
stretched
across
its
mother
's
lap
on
its
back
,
*NL*
and
she
a-laughing
and
admiring
and
worshipping
,
and
now
and
then
*NL*
tickling
under
the
baby
's
chin
to
set
it
cackling
,
and
then
maybe
*NL*
throwing
in
a
word
of
answer
to
me
herself
--
and
so
on
and
so
on
*NL*
--
well
,
do
n't
you
know
,
I
could
sit
there
in
the
cave
with
my
pen
,
*NL*
and
keep
it
up
,
that
way
,
by
the
hour
with
them
.
Why
,
it
was
*NL*
almost
like
having
us
all
together
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
spies
out
every
night
,
of
course
,
to
get
news
.
Every
report
*NL*
made
things
look
more
and
more
impressive
.
The
hosts
were
gathering
,
*NL*
gathering
;
down
all
the
roads
and
paths
of
England
the
knights
were
*NL*
riding
,
and
priests
rode
with
them
,
to
hearten
these
original
*NL*
Crusaders
,
this
being
the
Church
's
war
.
All
the
nobilities
,
big
*NL*
and
little
,
were
on
their
way
,
and
all
the
gentry
.
This
was
all
*NL*
as
was
expected
.
We
should
thin
out
this
sort
of
folk
to
such
*NL*
a
degree
that
the
people
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
just
step
*NL*
to
the
front
with
their
republic
and
--
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
what
a
donkey
I
was
!
Toward
the
end
of
the
week
I
began
to
get
*NL*
this
large
and
disenchanting
fact
through
my
head
:
that
the
mass
*NL*
of
the
nation
had
swung
their
caps
and
shouted
for
the
republic
for
*NL*
about
one
day
,
and
there
an
end
!
The
Church
,
the
nobles
,
and
*NL*
the
gentry
then
turned
one
grand
,
all-disapproving
frown
upon
them
*NL*
and
shriveled
them
into
sheep
!
From
that
moment
the
sheep
had
*NL*
begun
to
gather
to
the
fold
--
that
is
to
say
,
the
camps
--
and
offer
*NL*
their
valueless
lives
and
their
valuable
wool
to
the
``
righteous
*NL*
cause
.
''
Why
,
even
the
very
men
who
had
lately
been
slaves
were
*NL*
in
the
``
righteous
cause
,
''
and
glorifying
it
,
praying
for
it
,
*NL*
sentimentally
slabbering
over
it
,
just
like
all
the
other
commoners
.
*NL*
Imagine
such
human
muck
as
this
;
conceive
of
this
folly
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
now
``
Death
to
the
Republic
!
''
everywhere
--
not
a
dissenting
*NL*
voice
.
All
England
was
marching
against
us
!
Truly
,
this
was
more
*NL*
than
I
had
bargained
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
watched
my
fifty-two
boys
narrowly
;
watched
their
faces
,
their
*NL*
walk
,
their
unconscious
attitudes
:
for
all
these
are
a
language
*NL*
--
a
language
given
us
purposely
that
it
may
betray
us
in
times
of
*NL*
emergency
,
when
we
have
secrets
which
we
want
to
keep
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
that
thought
would
keep
saying
itself
over
and
over
again
*NL*
in
their
minds
and
hearts
,
_
All
England
is
marching
against
us
!
_
*NL*
and
ever
more
strenuously
imploring
attention
with
each
repetition
,
*NL*
ever
more
sharply
realizing
itself
to
their
imaginations
,
until
*NL*
even
in
their
sleep
they
would
find
no
rest
from
it
,
but
hear
*NL*
the
vague
and
flitting
creatures
of
the
dreams
say
,
_
All
England
_
*NL*
--
ALL
ENGLAND
!
--
_
is
marching
against
you
_
!
I
knew
all
this
would
*NL*
happen
;
I
knew
that
ultimately
the
pressure
would
become
so
great
*NL*
that
it
would
compel
utterance
;
therefore
,
I
must
be
ready
with
an
*NL*
answer
at
that
time
--
an
answer
well
chosen
and
tranquilizing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
right
.
The
time
came
.
They
HAD
to
speak
.
Poor
lads
,
it
*NL*
was
pitiful
to
see
,
they
were
so
pale
,
so
worn
,
so
troubled
.
At
*NL*
first
their
spokesman
could
hardly
find
voice
or
words
;
but
he
*NL*
presently
got
both
.
This
is
what
he
said
--
and
he
put
it
in
the
*NL*
neat
modern
English
taught
him
in
my
schools
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
tried
to
forget
what
we
are
--
English
boys
!
We
have
tried
*NL*
to
put
reason
before
sentiment
,
duty
before
love
;
our
minds
*NL*
approve
,
but
our
hearts
reproach
us
.
While
apparently
it
was
*NL*
only
the
nobility
,
only
the
gentry
,
only
the
twenty-five
or
thirty
*NL*
thousand
knights
left
alive
out
of
the
late
wars
,
we
were
of
one
*NL*
mind
,
and
undisturbed
by
any
troubling
doubt
;
each
and
every
one
*NL*
of
these
fifty-two
lads
who
stand
here
before
you
,
said
,
`
They
*NL*
have
chosen
--
it
is
their
affair
.
'
But
think
!
--
the
matter
is
*NL*
altered
--
_
All
England
is
marching
against
us
_
!
Oh
,
sir
,
consider
!
*NL*
--
reflect
!
--
these
people
are
our
people
,
they
are
bone
of
our
bone
,
*NL*
flesh
of
our
flesh
,
we
love
them
--
do
not
ask
us
to
destroy
our
nation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
shows
the
value
of
looking
ahead
,
and
being
ready
for
*NL*
a
thing
when
it
happens
.
If
I
had
n't
foreseen
this
thing
and
been
*NL*
fixed
,
that
boy
would
have
had
me
!
--
I
could
n't
have
said
a
word
.
*NL*
But
I
was
fixed
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boys
,
your
hearts
are
in
the
right
place
,
you
have
thought
the
*NL*
worthy
thought
,
you
have
done
the
worthy
thing
.
You
are
English
*NL*
boys
,
you
will
remain
English
boys
,
and
you
will
keep
that
name
*NL*
unsmirched
.
Give
yourselves
no
further
concern
,
let
your
minds
be
*NL*
at
peace
.
Consider
this
:
while
all
England
is
marching
against
*NL*
us
,
who
is
in
the
van
?
Who
,
by
the
commonest
rules
of
war
,
will
*NL*
march
in
the
front
?
Answer
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mounted
host
of
mailed
knights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
They
are
thirty
thousand
strong
.
Acres
deep
they
will
march
.
*NL*
Now
,
observe
:
none
but
_
they
_
will
ever
strike
the
sand-belt
!
Then
*NL*
there
will
be
an
episode
!
Immediately
after
,
the
civilian
multitude
*NL*
in
the
rear
will
retire
,
to
meet
business
engagements
elsewhere
.
*NL*
None
but
nobles
and
gentry
are
knights
,
and
_
none
but
these
_
will
*NL*
remain
to
dance
to
our
music
after
that
episode
.
It
is
absolutely
*NL*
true
that
we
shall
have
to
fight
nobody
but
these
thirty
thousand
*NL*
knights
.
Now
speak
,
and
it
shall
be
as
you
decide
.
Shall
we
*NL*
avoid
the
battle
,
retire
from
the
field
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
NO
!!!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shout
was
unanimous
and
hearty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
--
are
you
--
well
,
afraid
of
these
thirty
thousand
knights
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
joke
brought
out
a
good
laugh
,
the
boys
'
troubles
vanished
*NL*
away
,
and
they
went
gaily
to
their
posts
.
Ah
,
they
were
a
darling
*NL*
fifty-two
!
As
pretty
as
girls
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
ready
for
the
enemy
now
.
Let
the
approaching
big
day
come
*NL*
along
--
it
would
find
us
on
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
day
arrived
on
time
.
At
dawn
the
sentry
on
watch
in
the
*NL*
corral
came
into
the
cave
and
reported
a
moving
black
mass
under
*NL*
the
horizon
,
and
a
faint
sound
which
he
thought
to
be
military
*NL*
music
.
Breakfast
was
just
ready
;
we
sat
down
and
ate
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
over
,
I
made
the
boys
a
little
speech
,
and
then
sent
out
*NL*
a
detail
to
man
the
battery
,
with
Clarence
in
command
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
rose
presently
and
sent
its
unobstructed
splendors
over
*NL*
the
land
,
and
we
saw
a
prodigious
host
moving
slowly
toward
us
,
*NL*
with
the
steady
drift
and
aligned
front
of
a
wave
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Nearer
and
nearer
it
came
,
and
more
and
more
sublimely
imposing
*NL*
became
its
aspect
;
yes
,
all
England
was
there
,
apparently
.
Soon
*NL*
we
could
see
the
innumerable
banners
fluttering
,
and
then
the
sun
*NL*
struck
the
sea
of
armor
and
set
it
all
aflash
.
Yes
,
it
was
a
fine
*NL*
sight
;
I
had
n't
ever
seen
anything
to
beat
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
could
make
out
details
.
All
the
front
ranks
,
no
telling
*NL*
how
many
acres
deep
,
were
horsemen
--
plumed
knights
in
armor
.
*NL*
Suddenly
we
heard
the
blare
of
trumpets
;
the
slow
walk
burst
into
*NL*
a
gallop
,
and
then
--
well
,
it
was
wonderful
to
see
!
Down
swept
*NL*
that
vast
horse-shoe
wave
--
it
approached
the
sand-belt
--
my
breath
*NL*
stood
still
;
nearer
,
nearer
--
the
strip
of
green
turf
beyond
the
*NL*
yellow
belt
grew
narrow
--
narrower
still
--
became
a
mere
ribbon
in
*NL*
front
of
the
horses
--
then
disappeared
under
their
hoofs
.
Great
*NL*
Scott
!
Why
,
the
whole
front
of
that
host
shot
into
the
sky
with
*NL*
a
thunder-crash
,
and
became
a
whirling
tempest
of
rags
and
fragments
;
*NL*
and
along
the
ground
lay
a
thick
wall
of
smoke
that
hid
what
was
*NL*
left
of
the
multitude
from
our
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
for
the
second
step
in
the
plan
of
campaign
!
I
touched
*NL*
a
button
,
and
shook
the
bones
of
England
loose
from
her
spine
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
explosion
all
our
noble
civilization-factories
went
up
in
*NL*
the
air
and
disappeared
from
the
earth
.
It
was
a
pity
,
but
it
*NL*
was
necessary
.
We
could
not
afford
to
let
the
enemy
turn
our
own
*NL*
weapons
against
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
ensued
one
of
the
dullest
quarter-hours
I
had
ever
endured
.
*NL*
We
waited
in
a
silent
solitude
enclosed
by
our
circles
of
wire
,
*NL*
and
by
a
circle
of
heavy
smoke
outside
of
these
.
We
could
n't
*NL*
see
over
the
wall
of
smoke
,
and
we
could
n't
see
through
it
.
But
*NL*
at
last
it
began
to
shred
away
lazily
,
and
by
the
end
of
another
*NL*
quarter-hour
the
land
was
clear
and
our
curiosity
was
enabled
*NL*
to
satisfy
itself
.
No
living
creature
was
in
sight
!
We
now
*NL*
perceived
that
additions
had
been
made
to
our
defenses
.
The
*NL*
dynamite
had
dug
a
ditch
more
than
a
hundred
feet
wide
,
all
around
*NL*
us
,
and
cast
up
an
embankment
some
twenty-five
feet
high
on
both
*NL*
borders
of
it
.
As
to
destruction
of
life
,
it
was
amazing
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
it
was
beyond
estimate
.
Of
course
,
we
could
not
_
count
_
the
dead
,
*NL*
because
they
did
not
exist
as
individuals
,
but
merely
as
homogeneous
*NL*
protoplasm
,
with
alloys
of
iron
and
buttons
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
life
was
in
sight
,
but
necessarily
there
must
have
been
some
*NL*
wounded
in
the
rear
ranks
,
who
were
carried
off
the
field
under
*NL*
cover
of
the
wall
of
smoke
;
there
would
be
sickness
among
the
*NL*
others
--
there
always
is
,
after
an
episode
like
that
.
But
there
*NL*
would
be
no
reinforcements
;
this
was
the
last
stand
of
the
chivalry
*NL*
of
England
;
it
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
order
,
after
the
recent
*NL*
annihilating
wars
.
So
I
felt
quite
safe
in
believing
that
the
*NL*
utmost
force
that
could
for
the
future
be
brought
against
us
*NL*
would
be
but
small
;
that
is
,
of
knights
.
I
therefore
issued
a
*NL*
congratulatory
proclamation
to
my
army
in
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
SOLDIERS
,
CHAMPIONS
OF
HUMAN
LIBERTY
AND
EQUALITY
:
*NL*
Your
General
congratulates
you
!
In
the
pride
of
his
*NL*
strength
and
the
vanity
of
his
renown
,
an
arrogant
*NL*
enemy
came
against
you
.
You
were
ready
.
The
conflict
*NL*
was
brief
;
on
your
side
,
glorious
.
This
mighty
*NL*
victory
,
having
been
achieved
utterly
without
loss
,
*NL*
stands
without
example
in
history
.
So
long
as
the
*NL*
planets
shall
continue
to
move
in
their
orbits
,
the
*NL*
BATTLE
OF
THE
SAND-BELT
will
not
perish
out
of
the
*NL*
memories
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BOSS
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
it
well
,
and
the
applause
I
got
was
very
gratifying
to
me
.
*NL*
I
then
wound
up
with
these
remarks
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
war
with
the
English
nation
,
as
a
nation
,
is
at
an
end
.
*NL*
The
nation
has
retired
from
the
field
and
the
war
.
Before
it
can
*NL*
be
persuaded
to
return
,
war
will
have
ceased
.
This
campaign
is
*NL*
the
only
one
that
is
going
to
be
fought
.
It
will
be
brief
*NL*
--
the
briefest
in
history
.
Also
the
most
destructive
to
life
,
*NL*
considered
from
the
standpoint
of
proportion
of
casualties
to
*NL*
numbers
engaged
.
We
are
done
with
the
nation
;
henceforth
we
deal
*NL*
only
with
the
knights
.
English
knights
can
be
killed
,
but
they
*NL*
can
not
be
conquered
.
We
know
what
is
before
us
.
While
one
of
*NL*
these
men
remains
alive
,
our
task
is
not
finished
,
the
war
is
not
*NL*
ended
.
We
will
kill
them
all
.
''
-LSB-
Loud
and
long
continued
applause
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
picketed
the
great
embankments
thrown
up
around
our
lines
by
*NL*
the
dynamite
explosion
--
merely
a
lookout
of
a
couple
of
boys
*NL*
to
announce
the
enemy
when
he
should
appear
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
I
sent
an
engineer
and
forty
men
to
a
point
just
beyond
*NL*
our
lines
on
the
south
,
to
turn
a
mountain
brook
that
was
there
,
*NL*
and
bring
it
within
our
lines
and
under
our
command
,
arranging
*NL*
it
in
such
a
way
that
I
could
make
instant
use
of
it
in
an
emergency
.
*NL*
The
forty
men
were
divided
into
two
shifts
of
twenty
each
,
and
*NL*
were
to
relieve
each
other
every
two
hours
.
In
ten
hours
the
*NL*
work
was
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nightfall
now
,
and
I
withdrew
my
pickets
.
The
one
who
*NL*
had
had
the
northern
outlook
reported
a
camp
in
sight
,
but
visible
*NL*
with
the
glass
only
.
He
also
reported
that
a
few
knights
had
been
*NL*
feeling
their
way
toward
us
,
and
had
driven
some
cattle
across
our
*NL*
lines
,
but
that
the
knights
themselves
had
not
come
very
near
.
*NL*
That
was
what
I
had
been
expecting
.
They
were
feeling
us
,
you
*NL*
see
;
they
wanted
to
know
if
we
were
going
to
play
that
red
terror
*NL*
on
them
again
.
They
would
grow
bolder
in
the
night
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
I
believed
I
knew
what
project
they
would
attempt
,
because
it
was
*NL*
plainly
the
thing
I
would
attempt
myself
if
I
were
in
their
places
*NL*
and
as
ignorant
as
they
were
.
I
mentioned
it
to
Clarence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
right
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
is
the
obvious
thing
for
*NL*
them
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
I
said
,
``
if
they
do
it
they
are
doomed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
have
the
slightest
show
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
dreadful
,
Clarence
.
It
seems
an
awful
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
disturbed
me
so
that
I
could
n't
get
any
peace
of
mind
*NL*
for
thinking
of
it
and
worrying
over
it
.
So
,
at
last
,
to
quiet
*NL*
my
conscience
,
I
framed
this
message
to
the
knights
:
*NL*
*NL*
TO
THE
HONORABLE
THE
COMMANDER
OF
THE
INSURGENT
*NL*
CHIVALRY
OF
ENGLAND
:
YOU
fight
in
vain
.
We
know
*NL*
your
strength
--
if
one
may
call
it
by
that
name
.
*NL*
We
know
that
at
the
utmost
you
can
not
bring
*NL*
against
us
above
five
and
twenty
thousand
knights
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
you
have
no
chance
--
none
whatever
.
*NL*
Reflect
:
we
are
well
equipped
,
well
fortified
,
we
*NL*
number
54
.
Fifty-four
what
?
Men
?
No
,
MINDS
--
the
*NL*
capablest
in
the
world
;
a
force
against
which
*NL*
mere
animal
might
may
no
more
hope
to
prevail
than
*NL*
may
the
idle
waves
of
the
sea
hope
to
prevail
*NL*
against
the
granite
barriers
of
England
.
Be
advised
.
*NL*
We
offer
you
your
lives
;
for
the
sake
of
your
*NL*
families
,
do
not
reject
the
gift
.
We
offer
you
*NL*
this
chance
,
and
it
is
the
last
:
throw
down
your
*NL*
arms
;
surrender
unconditionally
to
the
Republic
,
*NL*
and
all
will
be
forgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Signed
-RRB-
THE
BOSS
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
read
it
to
Clarence
,
and
said
I
proposed
to
send
it
by
a
flag
*NL*
of
truce
.
He
laughed
the
sarcastic
laugh
he
was
born
with
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somehow
it
seems
impossible
for
you
to
ever
fully
realize
what
*NL*
these
nobilities
are
.
Now
let
us
save
a
little
time
and
trouble
.
*NL*
Consider
me
the
commander
of
the
knights
yonder
.
Now
,
then
,
*NL*
you
are
the
flag
of
truce
;
approach
and
deliver
me
your
message
,
*NL*
and
I
will
give
you
your
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
humored
the
idea
.
I
came
forward
under
an
imaginary
guard
of
*NL*
the
enemy
's
soldiers
,
produced
my
paper
,
and
read
it
through
.
*NL*
For
answer
,
Clarence
struck
the
paper
out
of
my
hand
,
pursed
up
*NL*
a
scornful
lip
and
said
with
lofty
disdain
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dismember
me
this
animal
,
and
return
him
in
a
basket
to
the
*NL*
base-born
knave
who
sent
him
;
other
answer
have
I
none
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
empty
is
theory
in
presence
of
fact
!
And
this
was
just
fact
,
*NL*
and
nothing
else
.
It
was
the
thing
that
would
have
happened
,
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
around
that
.
I
tore
up
the
paper
and
granted
*NL*
my
mistimed
sentimentalities
a
permanent
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
to
business
.
I
tested
the
electric
signals
from
the
gatling
*NL*
platform
to
the
cave
,
and
made
sure
that
they
were
all
right
;
*NL*
I
tested
and
retested
those
which
commanded
the
fences
--
these
*NL*
were
signals
whereby
I
could
break
and
renew
the
electric
current
*NL*
in
each
fence
independently
of
the
others
at
will
.
I
placed
the
*NL*
brook-connection
under
the
guard
and
authority
of
three
of
my
*NL*
best
boys
,
who
would
alternate
in
two-hour
watches
all
night
and
*NL*
promptly
obey
my
signal
,
if
I
should
have
occasion
to
give
it
*NL*
--
three
revolver-shots
in
quick
succession
.
Sentry-duty
was
discarded
*NL*
for
the
night
,
and
the
corral
left
empty
of
life
;
I
ordered
that
*NL*
quiet
be
maintained
in
the
cave
,
and
the
electric
lights
turned
*NL*
down
to
a
glimmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
was
good
and
dark
,
I
shut
off
the
current
from
all
*NL*
the
fences
,
and
then
groped
my
way
out
to
the
embankment
bordering
*NL*
our
side
of
the
great
dynamite
ditch
.
I
crept
to
the
top
of
it
*NL*
and
lay
there
on
the
slant
of
the
muck
to
watch
.
But
it
was
*NL*
too
dark
to
see
anything
.
As
for
sounds
,
there
were
none
.
The
*NL*
stillness
was
deathlike
.
True
,
there
were
the
usual
night-sounds
*NL*
of
the
country
--
the
whir
of
night-birds
,
the
buzzing
of
insects
,
*NL*
the
barking
of
distant
dogs
,
the
mellow
lowing
of
far-off
kine
*NL*
--
but
these
did
n't
seem
to
break
the
stillness
,
they
only
intensified
*NL*
it
,
and
added
a
grewsome
melancholy
to
it
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
presently
gave
up
looking
,
the
night
shut
down
so
black
,
but
*NL*
I
kept
my
ears
strained
to
catch
the
least
suspicious
sound
,
for
*NL*
I
judged
I
had
only
to
wait
,
and
I
should
n't
be
disappointed
.
*NL*
However
,
I
had
to
wait
a
long
time
.
At
last
I
caught
what
you
*NL*
may
call
in
distinct
glimpses
of
sound
dulled
metallic
sound
.
*NL*
I
pricked
up
my
ears
,
then
,
and
held
my
breath
,
for
this
was
the
*NL*
sort
of
thing
I
had
been
waiting
for
.
This
sound
thickened
,
and
*NL*
approached
--
from
toward
the
north
.
Presently
,
I
heard
it
at
my
*NL*
own
level
--
the
ridge-top
of
the
opposite
embankment
,
a
hundred
*NL*
feet
or
more
away
.
Then
I
seemed
to
see
a
row
of
black
dots
appear
*NL*
along
that
ridge
--
human
heads
?
I
could
n't
tell
;
it
might
n't
be
*NL*
anything
at
all
;
you
ca
n't
depend
on
your
eyes
when
your
imagination
*NL*
is
out
of
focus
.
However
,
the
question
was
soon
settled
.
I
heard
*NL*
that
metallic
noise
descending
into
the
great
ditch
.
It
augmented
*NL*
fast
,
it
spread
all
along
,
and
it
unmistakably
furnished
me
this
*NL*
fact
:
an
armed
host
was
taking
up
its
quarters
in
the
ditch
.
Yes
,
*NL*
these
people
were
arranging
a
little
surprise
party
for
us
.
We
*NL*
could
expect
entertainment
about
dawn
,
possibly
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
groped
my
way
back
to
the
corral
now
;
I
had
seen
enough
.
I
went
*NL*
to
the
platform
and
signaled
to
turn
the
current
on
to
the
two
*NL*
inner
fences
.
Then
I
went
into
the
cave
,
and
found
everything
*NL*
satisfactory
there
--
nobody
awake
but
the
working-watch
.
I
woke
*NL*
Clarence
and
told
him
the
great
ditch
was
filling
up
with
men
,
*NL*
and
that
I
believed
all
the
knights
were
coming
for
us
in
a
body
.
*NL*
It
was
my
notion
that
as
soon
as
dawn
approached
we
could
expect
*NL*
the
ditch
's
ambuscaded
thousands
to
swarm
up
over
the
embankment
*NL*
and
make
an
assault
,
and
be
followed
immediately
by
the
rest
*NL*
of
their
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clarence
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
be
wanting
to
send
a
scout
or
two
in
the
dark
to
make
*NL*
preliminary
observations
.
Why
not
take
the
lightning
off
the
*NL*
outer
fences
,
and
give
them
a
chance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
already
done
it
,
Clarence
.
Did
you
ever
know
me
to
be
*NL*
inhospitable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
are
a
good
heart
.
I
want
to
go
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
a
reception
committee
?
I
will
go
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
crossed
the
corral
and
lay
down
together
between
the
two
inside
*NL*
fences
.
Even
the
dim
light
of
the
cave
had
disordered
our
eyesight
*NL*
somewhat
,
but
the
focus
straightway
began
to
regulate
itself
and
*NL*
soon
it
was
adjusted
for
present
circumstances
.
We
had
had
to
feel
*NL*
our
way
before
,
but
we
could
make
out
to
see
the
fence
posts
now
.
*NL*
We
started
a
whispered
conversation
,
but
suddenly
Clarence
broke
*NL*
off
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
thing
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
thing
--
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
beyond
you
a
little
piece
--
dark
something
--
a
dull
shape
*NL*
of
some
kind
--
against
the
second
fence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
gazed
and
he
gazed
.
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
it
be
a
man
,
Clarence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
not
.
If
you
notice
,
it
looks
a
lit
--
why
,
it
_
is
_
*NL*
a
man
!
--
leaning
on
the
fence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
believe
it
is
;
let
us
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
crept
along
on
our
hands
and
knees
until
we
were
pretty
close
,
*NL*
and
then
looked
up
.
Yes
,
it
was
a
man
--
a
dim
great
figure
in
armor
,
*NL*
standing
erect
,
with
both
hands
on
the
upper
wire
--
and
,
of
course
,
*NL*
there
was
a
smell
of
burning
flesh
.
Poor
fellow
,
dead
as
a
*NL*
door-nail
,
and
never
knew
what
hurt
him
.
He
stood
there
like
a
*NL*
statue
--
no
motion
about
him
,
except
that
his
plumes
swished
about
*NL*
a
little
in
the
night
wind
.
We
rose
up
and
looked
in
through
*NL*
the
bars
of
his
visor
,
but
could
n't
make
out
whether
we
knew
him
*NL*
or
not
--
features
too
dim
and
shadowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
heard
muffled
sounds
approaching
,
and
we
sank
down
to
the
ground
*NL*
where
we
were
.
We
made
out
another
knight
vaguely
;
he
was
coming
*NL*
very
stealthily
,
and
feeling
his
way
.
He
was
near
enough
now
for
*NL*
us
to
see
him
put
out
a
hand
,
find
an
upper
wire
,
then
bend
and
*NL*
step
under
it
and
over
the
lower
one
.
Now
he
arrived
at
the
*NL*
first
knight
--
and
started
slightly
when
he
discovered
him
.
He
*NL*
stood
a
moment
--
no
doubt
wondering
why
the
other
one
did
n't
move
*NL*
on
;
then
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Why
dreamest
thou
here
,
good
*NL*
Sir
Mar
--
''
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
corpse
's
shoulder
--
and
just
*NL*
uttered
a
little
soft
moan
and
sunk
down
dead
.
Killed
by
a
dead
*NL*
man
,
you
see
--
killed
by
a
dead
friend
,
in
fact
.
There
was
something
*NL*
awful
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
early
birds
came
scattering
along
after
each
other
,
about
*NL*
one
every
five
minutes
in
our
vicinity
,
during
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
They
brought
no
armor
of
offense
but
their
swords
;
as
a
rule
,
*NL*
they
carried
the
sword
ready
in
the
hand
,
and
put
it
forward
and
*NL*
found
the
wires
with
it
.
We
would
now
and
then
see
a
blue
spark
*NL*
when
the
knight
that
caused
it
was
so
far
away
as
to
be
invisible
*NL*
to
us
;
but
we
knew
what
had
happened
,
all
the
same
;
poor
fellow
,
*NL*
he
had
touched
a
charged
wire
with
his
sword
and
been
electrocuted
.
*NL*
We
had
brief
intervals
of
grim
stillness
,
interrupted
with
piteous
*NL*
regularity
by
the
clash
made
by
the
falling
of
an
iron-clad
;
and
*NL*
this
sort
of
thing
was
going
on
,
right
along
,
and
was
very
creepy
*NL*
there
in
the
dark
and
lonesomeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
concluded
to
make
a
tour
between
the
inner
fences
.
We
elected
*NL*
to
walk
upright
,
for
convenience
's
sake
;
we
argued
that
if
discerned
,
*NL*
we
should
be
taken
for
friends
rather
than
enemies
,
and
in
any
case
*NL*
we
should
be
out
of
reach
of
swords
,
and
these
gentry
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
have
any
spears
along
.
Well
,
it
was
a
curious
trip
.
Everywhere
*NL*
dead
men
were
lying
outside
the
second
fence
--
not
plainly
visible
,
*NL*
but
still
visible
;
and
we
counted
fifteen
of
those
pathetic
*NL*
statues
--
dead
knights
standing
with
their
hands
on
the
upper
wire
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
demonstrated
:
our
current
*NL*
was
so
tremendous
that
it
killed
before
the
victim
could
cry
out
.
*NL*
Pretty
soon
we
detected
a
muffled
and
heavy
sound
,
and
next
moment
*NL*
we
guessed
what
it
was
.
It
was
a
surprise
in
force
coming
!
I
whispered
*NL*
Clarence
to
go
and
wake
the
army
,
and
notify
it
to
wait
in
silence
*NL*
in
the
cave
for
further
orders
.
He
was
soon
back
,
and
we
stood
*NL*
by
the
inner
fence
and
watched
the
silent
lightning
do
its
awful
*NL*
work
upon
that
swarming
host
.
One
could
make
out
but
little
of
*NL*
detail
;
but
he
could
note
that
a
black
mass
was
piling
itself
up
*NL*
beyond
the
second
fence
.
That
swelling
bulk
was
dead
men
!
Our
*NL*
camp
was
enclosed
with
a
solid
wall
of
the
dead
--
a
bulwark
,
*NL*
a
breastwork
,
of
corpses
,
you
may
say
.
One
terrible
thing
about
*NL*
this
thing
was
the
absence
of
human
voices
;
there
were
no
cheers
,
*NL*
no
war
cries
;
being
intent
upon
a
surprise
,
these
men
moved
as
*NL*
noiselessly
as
they
could
;
and
always
when
the
front
rank
was
near
*NL*
enough
to
their
goal
to
make
it
proper
for
them
to
begin
to
get
*NL*
a
shout
ready
,
of
course
they
struck
the
fatal
line
and
went
down
*NL*
without
testifying
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sent
a
current
through
the
third
fence
now
;
and
almost
immediately
*NL*
through
the
fourth
and
fifth
,
so
quickly
were
the
gaps
filled
up
.
*NL*
I
believed
the
time
was
come
now
for
my
climax
;
I
believed
that
*NL*
that
whole
army
was
in
our
trap
.
Anyway
,
it
was
high
time
to
find
*NL*
out
.
So
I
touched
a
button
and
set
fifty
electric
suns
aflame
*NL*
on
the
top
of
our
precipice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Land
,
what
a
sight
!
We
were
enclosed
in
three
walls
of
dead
men
!
*NL*
All
the
other
fences
were
pretty
nearly
filled
with
the
living
,
*NL*
who
were
stealthily
working
their
way
forward
through
the
wires
.
*NL*
The
sudden
glare
paralyzed
this
host
,
petrified
them
,
you
may
say
,
*NL*
with
astonishment
;
there
was
just
one
instant
for
me
to
utilize
*NL*
their
immobility
in
,
and
I
did
n't
lose
the
chance
.
You
see
,
in
*NL*
another
instant
they
would
have
recovered
their
faculties
,
then
*NL*
they
'd
have
burst
into
a
cheer
and
made
a
rush
,
and
my
wires
*NL*
would
have
gone
down
before
it
;
but
that
lost
instant
lost
them
*NL*
their
opportunity
forever
;
while
even
that
slight
fragment
of
time
*NL*
was
still
unspent
,
I
shot
the
current
through
all
the
fences
and
*NL*
struck
the
whole
host
dead
in
their
tracks
!
_
There
_
was
a
groan
*NL*
you
could
_
hear
_
!
It
voiced
the
death-pang
of
eleven
thousand
men
.
*NL*
It
swelled
out
on
the
night
with
awful
pathos
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
showed
that
the
rest
of
the
enemy
--
perhaps
ten
thousand
*NL*
strong
--
were
between
us
and
the
encircling
ditch
,
and
pressing
*NL*
forward
to
the
assault
.
Consequently
we
had
them
_
all
!
_
and
had
*NL*
them
past
help
.
Time
for
the
last
act
of
the
tragedy
.
I
fired
*NL*
the
three
appointed
revolver
shots
--
which
meant
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
on
the
water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sudden
rush
and
roar
,
and
in
a
minute
the
mountain
*NL*
brook
was
raging
through
the
big
ditch
and
creating
a
river
a
*NL*
hundred
feet
wide
and
twenty-five
deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
to
your
guns
,
men
!
Open
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thirteen
gatlings
began
to
vomit
death
into
the
fated
ten
*NL*
thousand
.
They
halted
,
they
stood
their
ground
a
moment
against
*NL*
that
withering
deluge
of
fire
,
then
they
broke
,
faced
about
and
*NL*
swept
toward
the
ditch
like
chaff
before
a
gale
.
A
full
fourth
*NL*
part
of
their
force
never
reached
the
top
of
the
lofty
embankment
;
*NL*
the
three-fourths
reached
it
and
plunged
over
--
to
death
by
drowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
ten
short
minutes
after
we
had
opened
fire
,
armed
resistance
*NL*
was
totally
annihilated
,
the
campaign
was
ended
,
we
fifty-four
were
*NL*
masters
of
England
.
Twenty-five
thousand
men
lay
dead
around
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
treacherous
is
fortune
!
In
a
little
while
--
say
an
hour
*NL*
--
happened
a
thing
,
by
my
own
fault
,
which
--
but
I
have
no
heart
*NL*
to
write
that
.
Let
the
record
end
here
.

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
A
POSTSCRIPT
BY
CLARENCE
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
Clarence
,
must
write
it
for
him
.
He
proposed
that
we
two
*NL*
go
out
and
see
if
any
help
could
be
accorded
the
wounded
.
I
was
*NL*
strenuous
against
the
project
.
I
said
that
if
there
were
many
,
*NL*
we
could
do
but
little
for
them
;
and
it
would
not
be
wise
for
us
to
*NL*
trust
ourselves
among
them
,
anyway
.
But
he
could
seldom
be
turned
*NL*
from
a
purpose
once
formed
;
so
we
shut
off
the
electric
current
*NL*
from
the
fences
,
took
an
escort
along
,
climbed
over
the
enclosing
*NL*
ramparts
of
dead
knights
,
and
moved
out
upon
the
field
.
The
first
*NL*
wounded
mall
who
appealed
for
help
was
sitting
with
his
back
*NL*
against
a
dead
comrade
.
When
The
Boss
bent
over
him
and
spoke
*NL*
to
him
,
the
man
recognized
him
and
stabbed
him
.
That
knight
was
*NL*
Sir
Meliagraunce
,
as
I
found
out
by
tearing
off
his
helmet
.
He
*NL*
will
not
ask
for
help
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
carried
The
Boss
to
the
cave
and
gave
his
wound
,
which
was
*NL*
not
very
serious
,
the
best
care
we
could
.
In
this
service
we
had
*NL*
the
help
of
Merlin
,
though
we
did
not
know
it
.
He
was
disguised
*NL*
as
a
woman
,
and
appeared
to
be
a
simple
old
peasant
goodwife
.
*NL*
In
this
disguise
,
with
brown-stained
face
and
smooth
shaven
,
he
*NL*
had
appeared
a
few
days
after
The
Boss
was
hurt
and
offered
to
cook
*NL*
for
us
,
saying
her
people
had
gone
off
to
join
certain
new
camps
*NL*
which
the
enemy
were
forming
,
and
that
she
was
starving
.
The
Boss
*NL*
had
been
getting
along
very
well
,
and
had
amused
himself
with
*NL*
finishing
up
his
record
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
glad
to
have
this
woman
,
for
we
were
short
handed
.
We
*NL*
were
in
a
trap
,
you
see
--
a
trap
of
our
own
making
.
If
we
stayed
*NL*
where
we
were
,
our
dead
would
kill
us
;
if
we
moved
out
of
our
*NL*
defenses
,
we
should
no
longer
be
invincible
.
We
had
conquered
;
*NL*
in
turn
we
were
conquered
.
The
Boss
recognized
this
;
we
all
*NL*
recognized
it
.
If
we
could
go
to
one
of
those
new
camps
and
*NL*
patch
up
some
kind
of
terms
with
the
enemy
--
yes
,
but
The
Boss
*NL*
could
not
go
,
and
neither
could
I
,
for
I
was
among
the
first
that
*NL*
were
made
sick
by
the
poisonous
air
bred
by
those
dead
thousands
.
*NL*
Others
were
taken
down
,
and
still
others
.
To-morrow
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
To-morrow
.
_
It
is
here
.
And
with
it
the
end
.
About
midnight
*NL*
I
awoke
,
and
saw
that
hag
making
curious
passes
in
the
air
about
*NL*
The
Boss
's
head
and
face
,
and
wondered
what
it
meant
.
Everybody
*NL*
but
the
dynamo-watch
lay
steeped
in
sleep
;
there
was
no
sound
.
*NL*
The
woman
ceased
from
her
mysterious
foolery
,
and
started
tip-toeing
*NL*
toward
the
door
.
I
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
What
have
you
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
halted
,
and
said
with
an
accent
of
malicious
satisfaction
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
were
conquerors
;
ye
are
conquered
!
These
others
are
perishing
*NL*
--
you
also
.
Ye
shall
all
die
in
this
place
--
every
one
--
except
_
him
_
.
*NL*
He
sleepeth
now
--
and
shall
sleep
thirteen
centuries
.
I
am
Merlin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
such
a
delirium
of
silly
laughter
overtook
him
that
he
reeled
*NL*
about
like
a
drunken
man
,
and
presently
fetched
up
against
one
*NL*
of
our
wires
.
His
mouth
is
spread
open
yet
;
apparently
he
is
still
*NL*
laughing
.
I
suppose
the
face
will
retain
that
petrified
laugh
until
*NL*
the
corpse
turns
to
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Boss
has
never
stirred
--
sleeps
like
a
stone
.
If
he
does
not
*NL*
wake
to-day
we
shall
understand
what
kind
of
a
sleep
it
is
,
and
*NL*
his
body
will
then
be
borne
to
a
place
in
one
of
the
remote
recesses
*NL*
of
the
cave
where
none
will
ever
find
it
to
desecrate
it
.
As
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
us
--
well
,
it
is
agreed
that
if
any
one
of
us
ever
*NL*
escapes
alive
from
this
place
,
he
will
write
the
fact
here
,
and
*NL*
loyally
hide
this
Manuscript
with
The
Boss
,
our
dear
good
chief
,
*NL*
whose
property
it
is
,
be
he
alive
or
dead

FINAL
P.S.
BY
M.T.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dawn
was
come
when
I
laid
the
Manuscript
aside
.
The
rain
*NL*
had
almost
ceased
,
the
world
was
gray
and
sad
,
the
exhausted
storm
*NL*
was
sighing
and
sobbing
itself
to
rest
.
I
went
to
the
stranger
's
*NL*
room
,
and
listened
at
his
door
,
which
was
slightly
ajar
.
I
could
*NL*
hear
his
voice
,
and
so
I
knocked
.
There
was
no
answer
,
but
I
still
*NL*
heard
the
voice
.
I
peeped
in
.
The
man
lay
on
his
back
in
bed
,
*NL*
talking
brokenly
but
with
spirit
,
and
punctuating
with
his
arms
,
*NL*
which
he
thrashed
about
,
restlessly
,
as
sick
people
do
in
delirium
.
*NL*
I
slipped
in
softly
and
bent
over
him
.
His
mutterings
and
*NL*
ejaculations
went
on
.
I
spoke
--
merely
a
word
,
to
call
his
attention
.
*NL*
His
glassy
eyes
and
his
ashy
face
were
alight
in
an
instant
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
gratitude
,
gladness
,
welcome
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Sandy
,
you
are
come
at
last
--
how
I
have
longed
for
you
!
Sit
*NL*
by
me
--
do
not
leave
me
--
never
leave
me
again
,
Sandy
,
never
again
.
*NL*
Where
is
your
hand
?
--
give
it
me
,
dear
,
let
me
hold
it
--
there
*NL*
--
now
all
is
well
,
all
is
peace
,
and
I
am
happy
again
--
_
we
_
are
happy
*NL*
again
,
is
n't
it
so
,
Sandy
?
You
are
so
dim
,
so
vague
,
you
are
but
*NL*
a
mist
,
a
cloud
,
but
you
are
_
here
_
,
and
that
is
blessedness
sufficient
;
*NL*
and
I
have
your
hand
;
do
n't
take
it
away
--
it
is
for
only
a
little
*NL*
while
,
I
shall
not
require
it
long
...
Was
that
the
child
?
...
*NL*
Hello-Central
!
...
she
does
n't
answer
.
Asleep
,
perhaps
?
Bring
her
*NL*
when
she
wakes
,
and
let
me
touch
her
hands
,
her
face
,
her
hair
,
*NL*
and
tell
her
good-bye
...
Sandy
!
Yes
,
you
are
there
.
I
lost
*NL*
myself
a
moment
,
and
I
thought
you
were
gone
...
Have
I
been
*NL*
sick
long
?
It
must
be
so
;
it
seems
months
to
me
.
And
such
dreams
!
*NL*
such
strange
and
awful
dreams
,
Sandy
!
Dreams
that
were
as
real
*NL*
as
reality
--
delirium
,
of
course
,
but
_
so
_
real
!
Why
,
I
thought
*NL*
the
king
was
dead
,
I
thought
you
were
in
Gaul
and
could
n't
get
*NL*
home
,
I
thought
there
was
a
revolution
;
in
the
fantastic
frenzy
*NL*
of
these
dreams
,
I
thought
that
Clarence
and
I
and
a
handful
of
*NL*
my
cadets
fought
and
exterminated
the
whole
chivalry
of
England
!
*NL*
But
even
that
was
not
the
strangest
.
I
seemed
to
be
a
creature
*NL*
out
of
a
remote
unborn
age
,
centuries
hence
,
and
even
_
that
_
was
*NL*
as
real
as
the
rest
!
Yes
,
I
seemed
to
have
flown
back
out
of
that
*NL*
age
into
this
of
ours
,
and
then
forward
to
it
again
,
and
was
set
*NL*
down
,
a
stranger
and
forlorn
in
that
strange
England
,
with
an
*NL*
abyss
of
thirteen
centuries
yawning
between
me
and
you
!
between
*NL*
me
and
my
home
and
my
friends
!
between
me
and
all
that
is
dear
*NL*
to
me
,
all
that
could
make
life
worth
the
living
!
It
was
awful
*NL*
--
awfuler
than
you
can
ever
imagine
,
Sandy
.
Ah
,
watch
by
me
,
Sandy
*NL*
--
stay
by
me
every
moment
--
_
do
n't
_
let
me
go
out
of
my
mind
again
;
*NL*
death
is
nothing
,
let
it
come
,
but
not
with
those
dreams
,
not
with
*NL*
the
torture
of
those
hideous
dreams
--
I
can
not
endure
_
that
_
again
...
*NL*
Sandy
?

*NL*
He
lay
muttering
incoherently
some
little
time
;
then
for
a
time
he
*NL*
lay
silent
,
and
apparently
sinking
away
toward
death
.
Presently
*NL*
his
fingers
began
to
pick
busily
at
the
coverlet
,
and
by
that
sign
*NL*
I
knew
that
his
end
was
at
hand
with
the
first
suggestion
of
the
*NL*
death-rattle
in
his
throat
he
started
up
slightly
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
listen
:
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bugle
?
...
It
is
the
king
!
The
drawbridge
,
there
!
Man
the
*NL*
battlements
!
--
turn
out
the
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
getting
up
his
last
``
effect
''
;
but
he
never
finished
it
.
