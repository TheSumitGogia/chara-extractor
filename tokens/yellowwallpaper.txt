THE
YELLOW
WALLPAPER
*NL*
*NL*
By
Charlotte
Perkins
Gilman
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
seldom
that
mere
ordinary
people
like
John
and
myself
secure
*NL*
ancestral
halls
for
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
colonial
mansion
,
a
hereditary
estate
,
I
would
say
a
haunted
house
,
*NL*
and
reach
the
height
of
romantic
felicity
--
but
that
would
be
asking
too
*NL*
much
of
fate
!
*NL*
*NL*
Still
I
will
proudly
declare
that
there
is
something
queer
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Else
,
why
should
it
be
let
so
cheaply
?
And
why
have
stood
so
long
*NL*
untenanted
?
*NL*
*NL*
John
laughs
at
me
,
of
course
,
but
one
expects
that
in
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
is
practical
in
the
extreme
.
He
has
no
patience
with
faith
,
an
*NL*
intense
horror
of
superstition
,
and
he
scoffs
openly
at
any
talk
of
*NL*
things
not
to
be
felt
and
seen
and
put
down
in
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
is
a
physician
,
and
PERHAPS
--
-LRB-
I
would
not
say
it
to
a
living
*NL*
soul
,
of
course
,
but
this
is
dead
paper
and
a
great
relief
to
my
*NL*
mind
-RRB-
--
PERHAPS
that
is
one
reason
I
do
not
get
well
faster
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
see
he
does
not
believe
I
am
sick
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
can
one
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
physician
of
high
standing
,
and
one
's
own
husband
,
assures
friends
*NL*
and
relatives
that
there
is
really
nothing
the
matter
with
one
but
*NL*
temporary
nervous
depression
--
a
slight
hysterical
tendency
--
what
is
one
*NL*
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
is
also
a
physician
,
and
also
of
high
standing
,
and
he
says
*NL*
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
take
phosphates
or
phosphites
--
whichever
it
is
,
and
tonics
,
and
*NL*
journeys
,
and
air
,
and
exercise
,
and
am
absolutely
forbidden
to
``
work
''
*NL*
until
I
am
well
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Personally
,
I
disagree
with
their
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Personally
,
I
believe
that
congenial
work
,
with
excitement
and
change
,
*NL*
would
do
me
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
is
one
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
write
for
a
while
in
spite
of
them
;
but
it
DOES
exhaust
me
a
good
*NL*
deal
--
having
to
be
so
sly
about
it
,
or
else
meet
with
heavy
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
sometimes
fancy
that
in
my
condition
if
I
had
less
opposition
and
more
*NL*
society
and
stimulus
--
but
John
says
the
very
worst
thing
I
can
do
is
to
*NL*
think
about
my
condition
,
and
I
confess
it
always
makes
me
feel
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
will
let
it
alone
and
talk
about
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
beautiful
place
!
It
is
quite
alone
,
standing
well
back
from
the
*NL*
road
,
quite
three
miles
from
the
village
.
It
makes
me
think
of
English
*NL*
places
that
you
read
about
,
for
there
are
hedges
and
walls
and
gates
*NL*
that
lock
,
and
lots
of
separate
little
houses
for
the
gardeners
and
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
DELICIOUS
garden
!
I
never
saw
such
a
garden
--
large
and
shady
,
*NL*
full
of
box-bordered
paths
,
and
lined
with
long
grape-covered
arbors
*NL*
with
seats
under
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
greenhouses
,
too
,
but
they
are
all
broken
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
legal
trouble
,
I
believe
,
something
about
the
heirs
and
*NL*
coheirs
;
anyhow
,
the
place
has
been
empty
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
spoils
my
ghostliness
,
I
am
afraid
,
but
I
do
n't
care
--
there
is
*NL*
something
strange
about
the
house
--
I
can
feel
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
even
said
so
to
John
one
moonlight
evening
,
but
he
said
what
I
felt
*NL*
was
a
DRAUGHT
,
and
shut
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
get
unreasonably
angry
with
John
sometimes
.
I
'm
sure
I
never
used
to
*NL*
be
so
sensitive
.
I
think
it
is
due
to
this
nervous
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
John
says
if
I
feel
so
,
I
shall
neglect
proper
self-control
;
so
I
*NL*
take
pains
to
control
myself
--
before
him
,
at
least
,
and
that
makes
me
*NL*
very
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
like
our
room
a
bit
.
I
wanted
one
downstairs
that
opened
on
the
*NL*
piazza
and
had
roses
all
over
the
window
,
and
such
pretty
old-fashioned
*NL*
chintz
hangings
!
but
John
would
not
hear
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
there
was
only
one
window
and
not
room
for
two
beds
,
and
no
near
*NL*
room
for
him
if
he
took
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
very
careful
and
loving
,
and
hardly
lets
me
stir
without
special
*NL*
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
a
schedule
prescription
for
each
hour
in
the
day
;
he
takes
all
*NL*
care
from
me
,
and
so
I
feel
basely
ungrateful
not
to
value
it
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
we
came
here
solely
on
my
account
,
that
I
was
to
have
perfect
*NL*
rest
and
all
the
air
I
could
get
.
``
Your
exercise
depends
on
your
*NL*
strength
,
my
dear
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
your
food
somewhat
on
your
appetite
;
*NL*
but
air
you
can
absorb
all
the
time
.
''
So
we
took
the
nursery
at
the
top
*NL*
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
big
,
airy
room
,
the
whole
floor
nearly
,
with
windows
that
look
*NL*
all
ways
,
and
air
and
sunshine
galore
.
It
was
nursery
first
and
then
*NL*
playroom
and
gymnasium
,
I
should
judge
;
for
the
windows
are
barred
for
*NL*
little
children
,
and
there
are
rings
and
things
in
the
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
paint
and
paper
look
as
if
a
boys
'
school
had
used
it
.
It
is
*NL*
stripped
off
--
the
paper
--
in
great
patches
all
around
the
head
of
my
bed
,
*NL*
about
as
far
as
I
can
reach
,
and
in
a
great
place
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
room
low
down
.
I
never
saw
a
worse
paper
in
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
sprawling
flamboyant
patterns
committing
every
artistic
*NL*
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
dull
enough
to
confuse
the
eye
in
following
,
pronounced
enough
*NL*
to
constantly
irritate
and
provoke
study
,
and
when
you
follow
the
*NL*
lame
uncertain
curves
for
a
little
distance
they
suddenly
commit
*NL*
suicide
--
plunge
off
at
outrageous
angles
,
destroy
themselves
in
unheard
*NL*
of
contradictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
color
is
repellent
,
almost
revolting
;
a
smouldering
unclean
yellow
,
*NL*
strangely
faded
by
the
slow-turning
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
dull
yet
lurid
orange
in
some
places
,
a
sickly
sulphur
tint
in
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
the
children
hated
it
!
I
should
hate
it
myself
if
I
had
to
*NL*
live
in
this
room
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
John
,
and
I
must
put
this
away
,
--
he
hates
to
have
me
write
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
been
here
two
weeks
,
and
I
have
n't
felt
like
writing
before
,
*NL*
since
that
first
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sitting
by
the
window
now
,
up
in
this
atrocious
nursery
,
and
*NL*
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
my
writing
as
much
as
I
please
,
save
lack
of
*NL*
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
is
away
all
day
,
and
even
some
nights
when
his
cases
are
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
glad
my
case
is
not
serious
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
nervous
troubles
are
dreadfully
depressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
does
not
know
how
much
I
really
suffer
.
He
knows
there
is
no
REASON
*NL*
to
suffer
,
and
that
satisfies
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
is
only
nervousness
.
It
does
weigh
on
me
so
not
to
do
my
*NL*
duty
in
any
way
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
meant
to
be
such
a
help
to
John
,
such
a
real
rest
and
comfort
,
and
*NL*
here
I
am
a
comparative
burden
already
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
would
believe
what
an
effort
it
is
to
do
what
little
I
am
*NL*
able
,
--
to
dress
and
entertain
,
and
order
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
fortunate
Mary
is
so
good
with
the
baby
.
Such
a
dear
baby
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
I
CAN
NOT
be
with
him
,
it
makes
me
so
nervous
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
John
never
was
nervous
in
his
life
.
He
laughs
at
me
so
about
*NL*
this
wall-paper
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
meant
to
repaper
the
room
,
but
afterwards
he
said
that
I
*NL*
was
letting
it
get
the
better
of
me
,
and
that
nothing
was
worse
for
a
*NL*
nervous
patient
than
to
give
way
to
such
fancies
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
that
after
the
wall-paper
was
changed
it
would
be
the
heavy
*NL*
bedstead
,
and
then
the
barred
windows
,
and
then
that
gate
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
stairs
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
place
is
doing
you
good
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
really
,
dear
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
to
renovate
the
house
just
for
a
three
months
'
rental
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
let
us
go
downstairs
,
''
I
said
,
``
there
are
such
pretty
rooms
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
me
in
his
arms
and
called
me
a
blessed
little
goose
,
*NL*
and
said
he
would
go
down
to
the
cellar
,
if
I
wished
,
and
have
it
*NL*
whitewashed
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
is
right
enough
about
the
beds
and
windows
and
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
airy
and
comfortable
room
as
any
one
need
wish
,
and
,
of
course
,
*NL*
I
would
not
be
so
silly
as
to
make
him
uncomfortable
just
for
a
whim
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
really
getting
quite
fond
of
the
big
room
,
all
but
that
horrid
*NL*
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
one
window
I
can
see
the
garden
,
those
mysterious
deepshaded
*NL*
arbors
,
the
riotous
old-fashioned
flowers
,
and
bushes
and
gnarly
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
another
I
get
a
lovely
view
of
the
bay
and
a
little
private
wharf
*NL*
belonging
to
the
estate
.
There
is
a
beautiful
shaded
lane
that
runs
*NL*
down
there
from
the
house
.
I
always
fancy
I
see
people
walking
in
these
*NL*
numerous
paths
and
arbors
,
but
John
has
cautioned
me
not
to
give
way
to
*NL*
fancy
in
the
least
.
He
says
that
with
my
imaginative
power
and
habit
of
*NL*
story-making
,
a
nervous
weakness
like
mine
is
sure
to
lead
to
all
manner
*NL*
of
excited
fancies
,
and
that
I
ought
to
use
my
will
and
good
sense
to
*NL*
check
the
tendency
.
So
I
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
sometimes
that
if
I
were
only
well
enough
to
write
a
little
it
*NL*
would
relieve
the
press
of
ideas
and
rest
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
find
I
get
pretty
tired
when
I
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
so
discouraging
not
to
have
any
advice
and
companionship
about
*NL*
my
work
.
When
I
get
really
well
,
John
says
we
will
ask
Cousin
Henry
and
*NL*
Julia
down
for
a
long
visit
;
but
he
says
he
would
as
soon
put
fireworks
*NL*
in
my
pillow-case
as
to
let
me
have
those
stimulating
people
about
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
I
could
get
well
faster
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
not
think
about
that
.
This
paper
looks
to
me
as
if
it
KNEW
*NL*
what
a
vicious
influence
it
had
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
recurrent
spot
where
the
pattern
lolls
like
a
broken
neck
and
*NL*
two
bulbous
eyes
stare
at
you
upside
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
get
positively
angry
with
the
impertinence
of
it
and
the
*NL*
everlastingness
.
Up
and
down
and
sideways
they
crawl
,
and
those
absurd
,
*NL*
unblinking
eyes
are
everywhere
.
There
is
one
place
where
two
breadths
*NL*
did
n't
match
,
and
the
eyes
go
all
up
and
down
the
line
,
one
a
little
*NL*
higher
than
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
saw
so
much
expression
in
an
inanimate
thing
before
,
and
we
all
*NL*
know
how
much
expression
they
have
!
I
used
to
lie
awake
as
a
child
and
*NL*
get
more
entertainment
and
terror
out
of
blank
walls
and
plain
furniture
*NL*
than
most
children
could
find
in
a
toy
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
what
a
kindly
wink
the
knobs
of
our
big
,
old
bureau
used
to
*NL*
have
,
and
there
was
one
chair
that
always
seemed
like
a
strong
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
used
to
feel
that
if
any
of
the
other
things
looked
too
fierce
I
could
*NL*
always
hop
into
that
chair
and
be
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
furniture
in
this
room
is
no
worse
than
inharmonious
,
however
,
for
*NL*
we
had
to
bring
it
all
from
downstairs
.
I
suppose
when
this
was
used
*NL*
as
a
playroom
they
had
to
take
the
nursery
things
out
,
and
no
wonder
!
I
*NL*
never
saw
such
ravages
as
the
children
have
made
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall-paper
,
as
I
said
before
,
is
torn
off
in
spots
,
and
it
sticketh
*NL*
closer
than
a
brother
--
they
must
have
had
perseverance
as
well
as
*NL*
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
floor
is
scratched
and
gouged
and
splintered
,
the
plaster
*NL*
itself
is
dug
out
here
and
there
,
and
this
great
heavy
bed
which
is
all
*NL*
we
found
in
the
room
,
looks
as
if
it
had
been
through
the
wars
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
mind
it
a
bit
--
only
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
John
's
sister
.
Such
a
dear
girl
as
she
is
,
and
so
careful
of
*NL*
me
!
I
must
not
let
her
find
me
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
is
a
perfect
and
enthusiastic
housekeeper
,
and
hopes
for
no
better
*NL*
profession
.
I
verily
believe
she
thinks
it
is
the
writing
which
made
me
*NL*
sick
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
can
write
when
she
is
out
,
and
see
her
a
long
way
off
from
these
*NL*
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
that
commands
the
road
,
a
lovely
shaded
winding
road
,
and
*NL*
one
that
just
looks
off
over
the
country
.
A
lovely
country
,
too
,
full
of
*NL*
great
elms
and
velvet
meadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
wall-paper
has
a
kind
of
sub-pattern
in
a
different
shade
,
a
*NL*
particularly
irritating
one
,
for
you
can
only
see
it
in
certain
lights
,
*NL*
and
not
clearly
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
places
where
it
is
n't
faded
and
where
the
sun
is
just
so
--
I
*NL*
can
see
a
strange
,
provoking
,
formless
sort
of
figure
,
that
seems
to
*NL*
skulk
about
behind
that
silly
and
conspicuous
front
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
's
sister
on
the
stairs
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
Fourth
of
July
is
over
!
The
people
are
gone
and
I
am
tired
*NL*
out
.
John
thought
it
might
do
me
good
to
see
a
little
company
,
so
we
*NL*
just
had
mother
and
Nellie
and
the
children
down
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
did
n't
do
a
thing
.
Jennie
sees
to
everything
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
tired
me
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
says
if
I
do
n't
pick
up
faster
he
shall
send
me
to
Weir
Mitchell
in
*NL*
the
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
want
to
go
there
at
all
.
I
had
a
friend
who
was
in
his
hands
*NL*
once
,
and
she
says
he
is
just
like
John
and
my
brother
,
only
more
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
it
is
such
an
undertaking
to
go
so
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
feel
as
if
it
was
worth
while
to
turn
my
hand
over
for
anything
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
getting
dreadfully
fretful
and
querulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
cry
at
nothing
,
and
cry
most
of
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
do
n't
when
John
is
here
,
or
anybody
else
,
but
when
I
am
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
am
alone
a
good
deal
just
now
.
John
is
kept
in
town
very
often
by
*NL*
serious
cases
,
and
Jennie
is
good
and
lets
me
alone
when
I
want
her
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
walk
a
little
in
the
garden
or
down
that
lovely
lane
,
sit
on
the
*NL*
porch
under
the
roses
,
and
lie
down
up
here
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
getting
really
fond
of
the
room
in
spite
of
the
wall-paper
.
Perhaps
*NL*
BECAUSE
of
the
wall-paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
dwells
in
my
mind
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
lie
here
on
this
great
immovable
bed
--
it
is
nailed
down
,
I
*NL*
believe
--
and
follow
that
pattern
about
by
the
hour
.
It
is
as
good
as
*NL*
gymnastics
,
I
assure
you
.
I
start
,
we
'll
say
,
at
the
bottom
,
down
in
the
*NL*
corner
over
there
where
it
has
not
been
touched
,
and
I
determine
for
the
*NL*
thousandth
time
that
I
WILL
follow
that
pointless
pattern
to
some
sort
*NL*
of
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
a
little
of
the
principle
of
design
,
and
I
know
this
thing
was
*NL*
not
arranged
on
any
laws
of
radiation
,
or
alternation
,
or
repetition
,
or
*NL*
symmetry
,
or
anything
else
that
I
ever
heard
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
repeated
,
of
course
,
by
the
breadths
,
but
not
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looked
at
in
one
way
each
breadth
stands
alone
,
the
bloated
curves
and
*NL*
flourishes
--
a
kind
of
``
debased
Romanesque
''
with
delirium
tremens
--
go
*NL*
waddling
up
and
down
in
isolated
columns
of
fatuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
connect
diagonally
,
and
the
sprawling
*NL*
outlines
run
off
in
great
slanting
waves
of
optic
horror
,
like
a
lot
of
*NL*
wallowing
seaweeds
in
full
chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
thing
goes
horizontally
,
too
,
at
least
it
seems
so
,
and
I
*NL*
exhaust
myself
in
trying
to
distinguish
the
order
of
its
going
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
have
used
a
horizontal
breadth
for
a
frieze
,
and
that
adds
*NL*
wonderfully
to
the
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
end
of
the
room
where
it
is
almost
intact
,
and
there
,
when
*NL*
the
crosslights
fade
and
the
low
sun
shines
directly
upon
it
,
I
can
*NL*
almost
fancy
radiation
after
all
,
--
the
interminable
grotesques
seem
to
*NL*
form
around
a
common
centre
and
rush
off
in
headlong
plunges
of
equal
*NL*
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
makes
me
tired
to
follow
it
.
I
will
take
a
nap
I
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
write
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
feel
able
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
know
John
would
think
it
absurd
.
But
I
MUST
say
what
I
feel
and
*NL*
think
in
some
way
--
it
is
such
a
relief
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
effort
is
getting
to
be
greater
than
the
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
the
time
now
I
am
awfully
lazy
,
and
lie
down
ever
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
says
I
mus
n't
lose
my
strength
,
and
has
me
take
cod
liver
oil
and
*NL*
lots
of
tonics
and
things
,
to
say
nothing
of
ale
and
wine
and
rare
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
John
!
He
loves
me
very
dearly
,
and
hates
to
have
me
sick
.
I
tried
*NL*
to
have
a
real
earnest
reasonable
talk
with
him
the
other
day
,
and
tell
*NL*
him
how
I
wish
he
would
let
me
go
and
make
a
visit
to
Cousin
Henry
and
*NL*
Julia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
said
I
was
n't
able
to
go
,
nor
able
to
stand
it
after
I
got
there
;
*NL*
and
I
did
not
make
out
a
very
good
case
for
myself
,
for
I
was
crying
*NL*
before
I
had
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
getting
to
be
a
great
effort
for
me
to
think
straight
.
Just
this
*NL*
nervous
weakness
I
suppose
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
dear
John
gathered
me
up
in
his
arms
,
and
just
carried
me
upstairs
*NL*
and
laid
me
on
the
bed
,
and
sat
by
me
and
read
to
me
till
it
tired
my
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
I
was
his
darling
and
his
comfort
and
all
he
had
,
and
that
I
*NL*
must
take
care
of
myself
for
his
sake
,
and
keep
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
says
no
one
but
myself
can
help
me
out
of
it
,
that
I
must
use
my
will
*NL*
and
self-control
and
not
let
any
silly
fancies
run
away
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
's
one
comfort
,
the
baby
is
well
and
happy
,
and
does
not
have
to
*NL*
occupy
this
nursery
with
the
horrid
wall-paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
not
used
it
,
that
blessed
child
would
have
!
What
a
fortunate
*NL*
escape
!
Why
,
I
would
n't
have
a
child
of
mine
,
an
impressionable
little
*NL*
thing
,
live
in
such
a
room
for
worlds
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
thought
of
it
before
,
but
it
is
lucky
that
John
kept
me
here
*NL*
after
all
,
I
can
stand
it
so
much
easier
than
a
baby
,
you
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
never
mention
it
to
them
any
more
--
I
am
too
wise
,
--
but
I
*NL*
keep
watch
of
it
all
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
things
in
that
paper
that
nobody
knows
but
me
,
or
ever
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
that
outside
pattern
the
dim
shapes
get
clearer
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
always
the
same
shape
,
only
very
numerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
is
like
a
woman
stooping
down
and
creeping
about
behind
that
*NL*
pattern
.
I
do
n't
like
it
a
bit
.
I
wonder
--
I
begin
to
think
--
I
wish
John
*NL*
would
take
me
away
from
here
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
so
hard
to
talk
with
John
about
my
case
,
because
he
is
so
wise
,
*NL*
and
because
he
loves
me
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
tried
it
last
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
moonlight
.
The
moon
shines
in
all
around
just
as
the
sun
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hate
to
see
it
sometimes
,
it
creeps
so
slowly
,
and
always
comes
in
by
*NL*
one
window
or
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
was
asleep
and
I
hated
to
waken
him
,
so
I
kept
still
and
watched
*NL*
the
moonlight
on
that
undulating
wall-paper
till
I
felt
creepy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
faint
figure
behind
seemed
to
shake
the
pattern
,
just
as
if
she
*NL*
wanted
to
get
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
up
softly
and
went
to
feel
and
see
if
the
paper
DID
move
,
and
when
*NL*
I
came
back
John
was
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
little
girl
?
''
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
go
walking
about
like
*NL*
that
--
you
'll
get
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
though
it
was
a
good
time
to
talk
,
so
I
told
him
that
I
really
was
not
*NL*
gaining
here
,
and
that
I
wished
he
would
take
me
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
darling
!
''
said
he
,
``
our
lease
will
be
up
in
three
weeks
,
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
see
how
to
leave
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
repairs
are
not
done
at
home
,
and
I
can
not
possibly
leave
town
just
*NL*
now
.
Of
course
if
you
were
in
any
danger
,
I
could
and
would
,
but
you
*NL*
really
are
better
,
dear
,
whether
you
can
see
it
or
not
.
I
am
a
doctor
,
*NL*
dear
,
and
I
know
.
You
are
gaining
flesh
and
color
,
your
appetite
is
*NL*
better
,
I
feel
really
much
easier
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
weigh
a
bit
more
,
''
said
I
,
``
nor
as
much
;
and
my
appetite
may
be
*NL*
better
in
the
evening
when
you
are
here
,
but
it
is
worse
in
the
morning
*NL*
when
you
are
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
her
little
heart
!
''
said
he
with
a
big
hug
,
``
she
shall
be
as
sick
*NL*
as
she
pleases
!
But
now
let
's
improve
the
shining
hours
by
going
to
*NL*
sleep
,
and
talk
about
it
in
the
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
go
away
?
''
I
asked
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
can
I
,
dear
?
It
is
only
three
weeks
more
and
then
we
will
*NL*
take
a
nice
little
trip
of
a
few
days
while
Jennie
is
getting
the
house
*NL*
ready
.
Really
dear
you
are
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
in
body
perhaps
--
''
I
began
,
and
stopped
short
,
for
he
sat
up
*NL*
straight
and
looked
at
me
with
such
a
stern
,
reproachful
look
that
I
*NL*
could
not
say
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
beg
of
you
,
for
my
sake
and
for
our
child
's
*NL*
sake
,
as
well
as
for
your
own
,
that
you
will
never
for
one
instant
*NL*
let
that
idea
enter
your
mind
!
There
is
nothing
so
dangerous
,
so
*NL*
fascinating
,
to
a
temperament
like
yours
.
It
is
a
false
and
foolish
*NL*
fancy
.
Can
you
not
trust
me
as
a
physician
when
I
tell
you
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
of
course
I
said
no
more
on
that
score
,
and
we
went
to
sleep
before
*NL*
long
.
He
thought
I
was
asleep
first
,
but
I
was
n't
,
and
lay
there
for
*NL*
hours
trying
to
decide
whether
that
front
pattern
and
the
back
pattern
*NL*
really
did
move
together
or
separately
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
pattern
like
this
,
by
daylight
,
there
is
a
lack
of
sequence
,
a
*NL*
defiance
of
law
,
that
is
a
constant
irritant
to
a
normal
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
color
is
hideous
enough
,
and
unreliable
enough
,
and
infuriating
*NL*
enough
,
but
the
pattern
is
torturing
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
think
you
have
mastered
it
,
but
just
as
you
get
well
underway
in
*NL*
following
,
it
turns
a
back-somersault
and
there
you
are
.
It
slaps
you
*NL*
in
the
face
,
knocks
you
down
,
and
tramples
upon
you
.
It
is
like
a
bad
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outside
pattern
is
a
florid
arabesque
,
reminding
one
of
a
fungus
.
*NL*
If
you
can
imagine
a
toadstool
in
joints
,
an
interminable
string
of
*NL*
toadstools
,
budding
and
sprouting
in
endless
convolutions
--
why
,
that
is
*NL*
something
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
,
sometimes
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
marked
peculiarity
about
this
paper
,
a
thing
nobody
seems
*NL*
to
notice
but
myself
,
and
that
is
that
it
changes
as
the
light
changes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sun
shoots
in
through
the
east
window
--
I
always
watch
for
that
*NL*
first
long
,
straight
ray
--
it
changes
so
quickly
that
I
never
can
quite
*NL*
believe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
why
I
watch
it
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
moonlight
--
the
moon
shines
in
all
night
when
there
is
a
moon
--
I
*NL*
would
n't
know
it
was
the
same
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
in
any
kind
of
light
,
in
twilight
,
candle
light
,
lamplight
,
and
*NL*
worst
of
all
by
moonlight
,
it
becomes
bars
!
The
outside
pattern
I
mean
,
*NL*
and
the
woman
behind
it
is
as
plain
as
can
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
n't
realize
for
a
long
time
what
the
thing
was
that
showed
behind
,
*NL*
that
dim
sub-pattern
,
but
now
I
am
quite
sure
it
is
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
daylight
she
is
subdued
,
quiet
.
I
fancy
it
is
the
pattern
that
keeps
*NL*
her
so
still
.
It
is
so
puzzling
.
It
keeps
me
quiet
by
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lie
down
ever
so
much
now
.
John
says
it
is
good
for
me
,
and
to
sleep
*NL*
all
I
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
he
started
the
habit
by
making
me
lie
down
for
an
hour
after
each
*NL*
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
bad
habit
I
am
convinced
,
for
you
see
I
do
n't
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
cultivates
deceit
,
for
I
do
n't
tell
them
I
'm
awake
--
O
no
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
I
am
getting
a
little
afraid
of
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seems
very
queer
sometimes
,
and
even
Jennie
has
an
inexplicable
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
strikes
me
occasionally
,
just
as
a
scientific
hypothesis
,
--
that
*NL*
perhaps
it
is
the
paper
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
watched
John
when
he
did
not
know
I
was
looking
,
and
come
into
*NL*
the
room
suddenly
on
the
most
innocent
excuses
,
and
I
've
caught
him
*NL*
several
times
LOOKING
AT
THE
PAPER
!
And
Jennie
too
.
I
caught
Jennie
with
*NL*
her
hand
on
it
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
n't
know
I
was
in
the
room
,
and
when
I
asked
her
in
a
quiet
,
a
*NL*
very
quiet
voice
,
with
the
most
restrained
manner
possible
,
what
she
*NL*
was
doing
with
the
paper
--
she
turned
around
as
if
she
had
been
caught
*NL*
stealing
,
and
looked
quite
angry
--
asked
me
why
I
should
frighten
her
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
said
that
the
paper
stained
everything
it
touched
,
that
she
had
*NL*
found
yellow
smooches
on
all
my
clothes
and
John
's
,
and
she
wished
we
*NL*
would
be
more
careful
!
*NL*
*NL*
Did
not
that
sound
innocent
?
But
I
know
she
was
studying
that
pattern
,
*NL*
and
I
am
determined
that
nobody
shall
find
it
out
but
myself
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Life
is
very
much
more
exciting
now
than
it
used
to
be
.
You
see
I
have
*NL*
something
more
to
expect
,
to
look
forward
to
,
to
watch
.
I
really
do
eat
*NL*
better
,
and
am
more
quiet
than
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
is
so
pleased
to
see
me
improve
!
He
laughed
a
little
the
other
day
,
*NL*
and
said
I
seemed
to
be
flourishing
in
spite
of
my
wall-paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
it
off
with
a
laugh
.
I
had
no
intention
of
telling
him
it
was
*NL*
BECAUSE
of
the
wall-paper
--
he
would
make
fun
of
me
.
He
might
even
want
*NL*
to
take
me
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
now
until
I
have
found
it
out
.
There
is
a
week
*NL*
more
,
and
I
think
that
will
be
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
feeling
ever
so
much
better
!
I
do
n't
sleep
much
at
night
,
for
it
*NL*
is
so
interesting
to
watch
developments
;
but
I
sleep
a
good
deal
in
the
*NL*
daytime
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
daytime
it
is
tiresome
and
perplexing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
always
new
shoots
on
the
fungus
,
and
new
shades
of
yellow
*NL*
all
over
it
.
I
can
not
keep
count
of
them
,
though
I
have
tried
*NL*
conscientiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
strangest
yellow
,
that
wall-paper
!
It
makes
me
think
of
all
*NL*
the
yellow
things
I
ever
saw
--
not
beautiful
ones
like
buttercups
,
but
*NL*
old
foul
,
bad
yellow
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
is
something
else
about
that
paper
--
the
smell
!
I
noticed
it
*NL*
the
moment
we
came
into
the
room
,
but
with
so
much
air
and
sun
it
was
*NL*
not
bad
.
Now
we
have
had
a
week
of
fog
and
rain
,
and
whether
the
windows
*NL*
are
open
or
not
,
the
smell
is
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
creeps
all
over
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
find
it
hovering
in
the
dining-room
,
skulking
in
the
parlor
,
hiding
in
*NL*
the
hall
,
lying
in
wait
for
me
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gets
into
my
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
I
go
to
ride
,
if
I
turn
my
head
suddenly
and
surprise
*NL*
it
--
there
is
that
smell
!
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
peculiar
odor
,
too
!
I
have
spent
hours
in
trying
to
analyze
it
,
*NL*
to
find
what
it
smelled
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
bad
--
at
first
,
and
very
gentle
,
but
quite
the
subtlest
,
most
*NL*
enduring
odor
I
ever
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
damp
weather
it
is
awful
,
I
wake
up
in
the
night
and
find
it
*NL*
hanging
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
used
to
disturb
me
at
first
.
I
thought
seriously
of
burning
the
*NL*
house
--
to
reach
the
smell
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
am
used
to
it
.
The
only
thing
I
can
think
of
that
it
is
like
*NL*
is
the
COLOR
of
the
paper
!
A
yellow
smell
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
very
funny
mark
on
this
wall
,
low
down
,
near
the
mopboard
.
*NL*
A
streak
that
runs
round
the
room
.
It
goes
behind
every
piece
of
*NL*
furniture
,
except
the
bed
,
a
long
,
straight
,
even
SMOOCH
,
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
rubbed
over
and
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wonder
how
it
was
done
and
who
did
it
,
and
what
they
did
it
for
.
Round
*NL*
and
round
and
round
--
round
and
round
and
round
--
it
makes
me
dizzy
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
really
have
discovered
something
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
watching
so
much
at
night
,
when
it
changes
so
,
I
have
finally
*NL*
found
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
front
pattern
DOES
move
--
and
no
wonder
!
The
woman
behind
shakes
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
think
there
are
a
great
many
women
behind
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
only
one
,
and
she
crawls
around
fast
,
and
her
crawling
shakes
it
all
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
in
the
very
bright
spots
she
keeps
still
,
and
in
the
very
shady
*NL*
spots
she
just
takes
hold
of
the
bars
and
shakes
them
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
is
all
the
time
trying
to
climb
through
.
But
nobody
could
climb
*NL*
through
that
pattern
--
it
strangles
so
;
I
think
that
is
why
it
has
so
*NL*
many
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
get
through
,
and
then
the
pattern
strangles
them
off
and
turns
them
*NL*
upside
down
,
and
makes
their
eyes
white
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
those
heads
were
covered
or
taken
off
it
would
not
be
half
so
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
woman
gets
out
in
the
daytime
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
'll
tell
you
why
--
privately
--
I
've
seen
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
see
her
out
of
every
one
of
my
windows
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
same
woman
,
I
know
,
for
she
is
always
creeping
,
and
most
women
*NL*
do
not
creep
by
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
her
on
that
long
road
under
the
trees
,
creeping
along
,
and
when
a
*NL*
carriage
comes
she
hides
under
the
blackberry
vines
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
blame
her
a
bit
.
It
must
be
very
humiliating
to
be
caught
*NL*
creeping
by
daylight
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
always
lock
the
door
when
I
creep
by
daylight
.
I
ca
n't
do
it
at
night
,
*NL*
for
I
know
John
would
suspect
something
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
John
is
so
queer
now
,
that
I
do
n't
want
to
irritate
him
.
I
wish
he
*NL*
would
take
another
room
!
Besides
,
I
do
n't
want
anybody
to
get
that
woman
*NL*
out
at
night
but
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
often
wonder
if
I
could
see
her
out
of
all
the
windows
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
turn
as
fast
as
I
can
,
I
can
only
see
out
of
one
at
one
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
I
always
see
her
,
she
MAY
be
able
to
creep
faster
than
I
can
*NL*
turn
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
watched
her
sometimes
away
off
in
the
open
country
,
creeping
as
*NL*
fast
as
a
cloud
shadow
in
a
high
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
only
that
top
pattern
could
be
gotten
off
from
the
under
one
!
I
mean
*NL*
to
try
it
,
little
by
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
found
out
another
funny
thing
,
but
I
sha
n't
tell
it
this
time
!
It
*NL*
does
not
do
to
trust
people
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
only
two
more
days
to
get
this
paper
off
,
and
I
believe
John
*NL*
is
beginning
to
notice
.
I
do
n't
like
the
look
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
heard
him
ask
Jennie
a
lot
of
professional
questions
about
me
.
She
*NL*
had
a
very
good
report
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
I
slept
a
good
deal
in
the
daytime
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
knows
I
do
n't
sleep
very
well
at
night
,
for
all
I
'm
so
quiet
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
,
too
,
and
pretended
to
be
very
loving
*NL*
and
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
I
could
n't
see
through
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
I
do
n't
wonder
he
acts
so
,
sleeping
under
this
paper
for
three
*NL*
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
only
interests
me
,
but
I
feel
sure
John
and
Jennie
are
secretly
*NL*
affected
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Hurrah
!
This
is
the
last
day
,
but
it
is
enough
.
John
is
to
stay
in
town
*NL*
over
night
,
and
wo
n't
be
out
until
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jennie
wanted
to
sleep
with
me
--
the
sly
thing
!
but
I
told
her
I
should
*NL*
undoubtedly
rest
better
for
a
night
all
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
clever
,
for
really
I
was
n't
alone
a
bit
!
As
soon
as
it
was
*NL*
moonlight
and
that
poor
thing
began
to
crawl
and
shake
the
pattern
,
I
*NL*
got
up
and
ran
to
help
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pulled
and
she
shook
,
I
shook
and
she
pulled
,
and
before
morning
we
*NL*
had
peeled
off
yards
of
that
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strip
about
as
high
as
my
head
and
half
around
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
when
the
sun
came
and
that
awful
pattern
began
to
laugh
at
me
,
*NL*
I
declared
I
would
finish
it
to-day
!
*NL*
*NL*
We
go
away
to-morrow
,
and
they
are
moving
all
my
furniture
down
again
to
*NL*
leave
things
as
they
were
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jennie
looked
at
the
wall
in
amazement
,
but
I
told
her
merrily
that
I
*NL*
did
it
out
of
pure
spite
at
the
vicious
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
and
said
she
would
n't
mind
doing
it
herself
,
but
I
must
not
*NL*
get
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
she
betrayed
herself
that
time
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
am
here
,
and
no
person
touches
this
paper
but
me
--
not
ALIVE
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
get
me
out
of
the
room
--
it
was
too
patent
!
But
I
said
it
*NL*
was
so
quiet
and
empty
and
clean
now
that
I
believed
I
would
lie
down
*NL*
again
and
sleep
all
I
could
;
and
not
to
wake
me
even
for
dinner
--
I
would
*NL*
call
when
I
woke
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
now
she
is
gone
,
and
the
servants
are
gone
,
and
the
things
are
gone
,
*NL*
and
there
is
nothing
left
but
that
great
bedstead
nailed
down
,
with
the
*NL*
canvas
mattress
we
found
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
sleep
downstairs
to-night
,
and
take
the
boat
home
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
quite
enjoy
the
room
,
now
it
is
bare
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
those
children
did
tear
about
here
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
bedstead
is
fairly
gnawed
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
get
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
locked
the
door
and
thrown
the
key
down
into
the
front
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
go
out
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
have
anybody
come
in
,
till
*NL*
John
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
want
to
astonish
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
've
got
a
rope
up
here
that
even
Jennie
did
not
find
.
If
that
woman
*NL*
does
get
out
,
and
tries
to
get
away
,
I
can
tie
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
forgot
I
could
not
reach
far
without
anything
to
stand
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
bed
will
NOT
move
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
to
lift
and
push
it
until
I
was
lame
,
and
then
I
got
so
angry
I
*NL*
bit
off
a
little
piece
at
one
corner
--
but
it
hurt
my
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
peeled
off
all
the
paper
I
could
reach
standing
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
It
sticks
horribly
and
the
pattern
just
enjoys
it
!
All
those
strangled
*NL*
heads
and
bulbous
eyes
and
waddling
fungus
growths
just
shriek
with
*NL*
derision
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
getting
angry
enough
to
do
something
desperate
.
To
jump
out
of
the
*NL*
window
would
be
admirable
exercise
,
but
the
bars
are
too
strong
even
to
*NL*
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
I
would
n't
do
it
.
Of
course
not
.
I
know
well
enough
that
a
step
*NL*
like
that
is
improper
and
might
be
misconstrued
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
like
to
LOOK
out
of
the
windows
even
--
there
are
so
many
of
those
*NL*
creeping
women
,
and
they
creep
so
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wonder
if
they
all
come
out
of
that
wall-paper
as
I
did
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
am
securely
fastened
now
by
my
well-hidden
rope
--
you
do
n't
get
ME
*NL*
out
in
the
road
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
I
shall
have
to
get
back
behind
the
pattern
when
it
comes
*NL*
night
,
and
that
is
hard
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
so
pleasant
to
be
out
in
this
great
room
and
creep
around
as
I
*NL*
please
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
go
outside
.
I
wo
n't
,
even
if
Jennie
asks
me
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
outside
you
have
to
creep
on
the
ground
,
and
everything
is
green
*NL*
instead
of
yellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
I
can
creep
smoothly
on
the
floor
,
and
my
shoulder
just
fits
in
*NL*
that
long
smooch
around
the
wall
,
so
I
can
not
lose
my
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
there
's
John
at
the
door
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
use
,
young
man
,
you
ca
n't
open
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
he
does
call
and
pound
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
's
crying
for
an
axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
a
shame
to
break
down
that
beautiful
door
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
dear
!
''
said
I
in
the
gentlest
voice
,
``
the
key
is
down
by
the
front
*NL*
steps
,
under
a
plantain
leaf
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
silenced
him
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
said
--
very
quietly
indeed
,
``
Open
the
door
,
my
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
I.
``
The
key
is
down
by
the
front
door
under
a
plantain
*NL*
leaf
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
said
it
again
,
several
times
,
very
gently
and
slowly
,
and
*NL*
said
it
so
often
that
he
had
to
go
and
see
,
and
he
got
it
of
course
,
and
*NL*
came
in
.
He
stopped
short
by
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
cried
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
what
are
you
doing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
kept
on
creeping
just
the
same
,
but
I
looked
at
him
over
my
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
out
at
last
,
''
said
I
,
``
in
spite
of
you
and
Jane
.
And
I
've
*NL*
pulled
off
most
of
the
paper
,
so
you
ca
n't
put
me
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
why
should
that
man
have
fainted
?
But
he
did
,
and
right
across
my
*NL*
path
by
the
wall
,
so
that
I
had
to
creep
over
him
every
time
!
*NL*
*NL*
